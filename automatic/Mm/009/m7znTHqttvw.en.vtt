blue by them does a very good job in the

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.530 
blue by them does a very good job in the
beginning<00:01:10.260> I<00:01:10.680> used<00:01:10.920> to<00:01:11.070> use<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.640> gorilla<00:01:12.090> glue<00:01:12.360> a

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
beginning I used to use a gorilla glue a

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.870 
beginning I used to use a gorilla glue a
lot<00:01:12.720> because<00:01:13.530> well<00:01:13.860> it<00:01:14.220> says<00:01:14.520> it's<00:01:14.700> the

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
lot because well it says it's the

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.700 
lot because well it says it's the
toughest<00:01:15.270> fool<00:01:15.540> on<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:15.750> planet<00:01:16.170> Earth<00:01:16.320> and

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
toughest fool on the planet Earth and

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.830 
toughest fool on the planet Earth and
currently<00:01:17.580> that's<00:01:17.790> why<00:01:17.939> I'm<00:01:18.030> living<00:01:18.420> so<00:01:18.810> I

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
currently that's why I'm living so I

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.840 
currently that's why I'm living so I
thought<00:01:19.170> that's<00:01:19.350> why<00:01:19.560> I<00:01:19.619> use<00:01:19.650> it<00:01:20.040> but<00:01:20.610> to<00:01:20.759> be

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
thought that's why I use it but to be

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.429 
thought that's why I use it but to be
honest<00:01:21.119> with<00:01:21.270> you<00:01:21.330> in<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.659> beginning<00:01:21.780> my

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
honest with you in the beginning my

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.230 
honest with you in the beginning my
joints<00:01:22.799> were<00:01:22.920> kind<00:01:23.130> of<00:01:23.220> swampy<00:01:23.610> and<00:01:23.700> loose<00:01:23.939> and

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
joints were kind of swampy and loose and

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.390 
joints were kind of swampy and loose and
I<00:01:24.540> thought<00:01:24.720> because<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.259> stuff<00:01:25.500> expands<00:01:26.280> that

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
I thought because the stuff expands that

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.700 
I thought because the stuff expands that
would<00:01:27.000> make<00:01:27.180> for<00:01:27.210> a<00:01:27.420> better<00:01:27.509> joint<00:01:27.900> but<00:01:28.530> let's

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
would make for a better joint but let's

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.720 
would make for a better joint but let's
face<00:01:28.890> it<00:01:29.159> it's<00:01:29.549> all<00:01:29.759> in<00:01:29.909> your<00:01:29.939> workmanship

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:31.730 
face it it's all in your workmanship

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:34.990 
face it it's all in your workmanship
as<00:01:32.300> far<00:01:32.510> as<00:01:32.540> hide<00:01:32.870> glue<00:01:33.110> goes<00:01:33.410> I've<00:01:34.400> never<00:01:34.670> used

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
as far as hide glue goes I've never used

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.630 
as far as hide glue goes I've never used
it<00:01:35.270> I<00:01:35.450> know<00:01:35.780> some<00:01:36.140> people<00:01:36.200> I<00:01:36.590> do<00:01:36.650> you<00:01:37.340> got<00:01:37.490> to

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
it I know some people I do you got to

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.460 
it I know some people I do you got to
mix<00:01:37.820> it<00:01:38.030> just<00:01:38.270> right<00:01:38.570> and<00:01:38.600> then<00:01:38.960> you<00:01:39.080> get<00:01:39.200> it<00:01:39.320> to

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 
mix it just right and then you get it to

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.500 
mix it just right and then you get it to
the<00:01:39.530> right<00:01:39.590> temperature<00:01:40.280> and<00:01:40.460> then<00:01:41.030> you<00:01:41.210> apply

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:41.510 
the right temperature and then you apply

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:43.300 
the right temperature and then you apply
it<00:01:41.600> now<00:01:42.200> really<00:01:42.500> a<00:01:42.620> lot<00:01:42.860> of<00:01:43.010> them<00:01:43.100> don't

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
it now really a lot of them don't

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.160 
it now really a lot of them don't
realize<00:01:43.790> is<00:01:44.060> that<00:01:44.210> you<00:01:44.390> actually<00:01:44.570> have<00:01:44.960> to

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
realize is that you actually have to

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.890 
realize is that you actually have to
heat<00:01:45.380> the<00:01:45.620> wood<00:01:45.920> as<00:01:46.250> well<00:01:47.000> as<00:01:47.300> heating<00:01:47.750> the

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:47.900 
heat the wood as well as heating the

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.920 
heat the wood as well as heating the
glue<00:01:48.170> and<00:01:48.500> at<00:01:48.980> the<00:01:49.100> same<00:01:49.310> time<00:01:49.370> apply<00:01:50.210> them<00:01:50.450> so

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
glue and at the same time apply them so

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:52.180 
glue and at the same time apply them so
that<00:01:50.960> just<00:01:51.410> sounds<00:01:51.590> like<00:01:51.710> a<00:01:51.740> lot<00:01:51.920> of<00:01:51.950> work<00:01:52.160> for

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:52.190 
that just sounds like a lot of work for

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.030 
that just sounds like a lot of work for
