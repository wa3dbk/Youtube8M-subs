00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:11.650
 surely the first part to the 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.570
 points the palms has been better if 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:16.340
 let's talk about boxing 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:19.670
 with the palms is a good team that I 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:21.800
 I think he is a candidate beyond this 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:23.840
 stumbles surely achieve all black 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.210
 but it's a good team with a good 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:29.300
 coach a good template have done 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:31.279
 and they are having a great season 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.800
 and the first part I think they have 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:36.590
 It takes a little game we have been 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.800
 cost that last pass not what 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.540
 we found we did not know how to give 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.280
 we talked about that at the break 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.649
 we have put the lines together a little more 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.110
 so that the monkey could receive so 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:48.640
 free between lines and I think that that has 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.379
 been the key from there we 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.730
 we have come out with speed and we have 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:53.860
 successful the last pass which is what 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.120
 we were missing and the second part I think 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.820
 Sincerely, the Betis has been very 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:00.880
 superior with the first part the palms 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:04.660
 was had the option d 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:06.040
 to rest in front started 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.240
 telling you that in the first time I think 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.550
 that palms has made a very good 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:12.100
 work and that has surely deserved 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:14.610
 more what happens that the matches are 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.530
 until the 95th minute 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.390
 in the overall calculation at the end I do not know 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.830
 be fair the marker because that's what 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.060
 but I think the Betis has 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.480
 won because the second part has been 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.760
 better but we have a line of 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:28.050
 work calmly with tranquility 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.900
 because I imagine that as you know 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:33.510
 well every week we have a fire 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.490
 new and we try to make the footballers 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.229
 focus on how important they are 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.229
 doing 10 you have to give it the 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.690
 congratulations, it's very difficult to work 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.300
 week to week with different members 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.830
 of the team with a problem and yet 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.190
 they are giving a demonstration of 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:51.200
 tremendous professionalism 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:54.350
 and it's to be grateful for a coach is 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:57.620
 to thank we try to handle that more 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:01.490
 the role of psychologist and father confessor 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:03.170
 that of coach but at the moment the 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.500
 things go well and that's important 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:08.390
 this result reinforces us at expense 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.619
 of the next news the secret what 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.110
 what I told you are the players 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.540
 they know how to abstract from everything I 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.880
 I help as I can good together 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.400
 roberto ríos and amis gómez the body 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.860
 technical we are at your disposal les 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.750
 we help in everything we can 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.460
 we try to make them see that the most 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.110
 they have a profession that the most beautiful 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:29.060
 of the world and that they pay you for it and that 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.550
 therefore they have to enjoy it and 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.360
 that what goes on outside has to 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.100
 try to leave it aside 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.780
 and I think it is giving us results 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.700
 because every time the costumes of the betis 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.560
 it is stronger, it joins more every news 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.260
 that goes out that affects one of them 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.930
 they still join more and we are and we are more 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:48.450
 family and rubén castro is normal that 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:51.300
 have have swings and have different 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.620
 matches today I think I 've been good more 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.170
 Beyond that he has not made a goal 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.300
 participates in everything in many things is a 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:00.780
 important player for the betis from 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:03.300
 2010 and I think he's a player of the 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.370
 Canarian quarry that have the values 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:07.410
 within the field of Canarian football with 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:11.050
 that bit of goal that makes him so 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:12.760
 unpredictable the notes 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.430
 in the soccer course as in the 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:18.790
 academic are given in summer 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:20.890
 and what matters now is not already 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.569
 happened an hour ago what matters is 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.159
 what will happen next Saturday that 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:26.379
 we play again and what will happen on the 30th 

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:29.319
 of June but yes that's true I'm 

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:30.760
 comfortable with Alexis and continued with 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:33.280
 tino confronts me a lot of times 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.500
 in front of all the teams that has 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.409
 been here and with alexis I have a good 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.150
 tuning and hopefully we have to 

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:41.930
 prepare together next season 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.340
 in the first division 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.969
 and I wish the union good luck 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.969
 sporty too
