00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:06.089
 hello I am the people here is like that 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:09.740
 mister psycho a and today i wanted 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:12.780
 we show you the hack koopmann 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:16.049
 traditionally it's possible to gamble on the pc 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.940
 a hack of the pokÃ©mon edition and yes 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.070
 We start to the sides often you have to 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:24.570
 Of course I will give you all the pages in 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:28.710
 the description is only here 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.500
 not even on the gate then that's the end of it 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.739
 automatically then you go on the side 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:38.370
 click on their flum then it loads the ps 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.500
 that also down so that's just the 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.480
 tradition 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:45.379
 which is thus to the traditional fire-red 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.379
 to patch 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:54.790
 Here you see the woman now red 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:57.400
 edition down the page with her 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:01:00.160
 you the down and therapy are on 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.850
 patched and determined that all 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.770
 play 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.770
 do you still look forward to brussels? 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.130
 now on the strong opponent 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.930
 okay I already have it all 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:18.910
 So I do not have to do that now 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:20.470
 make more and I will give you short times 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:23.110
 but you have to stop the whole party 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.610
 Mostly know this from the winter time 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.860
 but pack it here with us and at 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:29.140
 You have to install us first 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:33.610
 It is not winter, you have to do it 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:36.580
 first installed those are just the 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:39.840
 All the heat you get out of the 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:46.770
 party out cult or has tuesday 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:51.100
 publicly ps as regards apps fed 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:54.550
 Now you always know what you are looking for 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:56.500
 specialized first you have to tackle something 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:58.440
 I am to be used for patching 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.280
 now such a tradition 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.240
 Now he wants to know what that is 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.950
 to be patched 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.570
 we want the tradition here on the 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.010
 fiery red to the patch because otherwise 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:09.310
 Can you mix the tradition together 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:11.440
 So we're going fire red now 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.920
 Relatively soon finally here again 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.510
 this warning compassion complete im 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.100
 development plan for the budget is still 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.760
 okay and it's done then he needs that 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.760
 program no longer 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.760
 yes, that actually would not have happened anymore 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.320
 So I could usually do that 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.390
 the trash because I have mine 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:36.790
 separate dollars 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:36.790
 and yes that 's the edition 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:44.330
 I would recommend you to rename 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.700
 if you have the fire-red edition 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.590
 to gamble under the pc 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.920
 that's a bit confusing if then 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:57.680
 here the tradition of 30 euro tredition 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:03:00.640
 fire red and yes there are already here 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:05.750
 but you have to be emulator first 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:08.570
 even type 128 katrin because otherwise not 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:11.480
 normal if you play from the whole network 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:14.240
 wanted to make the next problem bigger 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.700
 it's small with fraps of gold 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:18.320
 on video vienna on speaker way and 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:22.100
 As you can see, he is the girl too 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:23.959
 director and crepes and so is it 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:26.240
 if it is on the Rector if the 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:27.050
 it would have to direct3d or opengl 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:29.360
 to press 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:31.070
 I always do on opel money why too 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.709
 it just always makes it that way 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:37.880
 I could work there now 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:41.500
 The fire-red is looking forward to open 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:48.400
 edition ii zr edition out 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:49.750
 open up and that would be me 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:55.060
 can you show me that again 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:57.490
 a lot of that works very funny 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:01.000
 that through and from now you can see here 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:02.380
 the professor is different now 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.450
 example here too there are only young 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:06.930
 man are at the other boy from many 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:06.930
 situation 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.620
 that's the rival 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:22.600
 and as you can see , where does it start? 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:30.280
 I am very different again short state 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:32.260
 and then we show it starts 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:37.570
 every location and harms too 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:39.700
 at that time it was time to go to the 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:41.610
 example of one of the websites are already 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:46.270
 that we are not made of Dehrn 1 and 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:48.130
 yes that has the beginning and I think 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.600
 this edition is the most I have 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:50.740
 it still not said I'm going to 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:54.190
 soon probably the last of them 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:56.860
 but reinziehen in any case I hope 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:59.620
 that you liked if yes, I'm glad 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:02.710
 me on a thumbs up that pretty much 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:04.870
 Of course, I'm also happy to subscribe 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:07.479
 I am happy if you give feedback 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:09.370
 So do not just write now yes it was 

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:10.780
 well yes it was bad but want to know 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:12.790
 why that was good or why 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:15.600
 it bad what i could improve 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:18.760
 because otherwise I can not do anything 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:20.860
 and yes I would see then we saw 

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:22.979
 next time we will see it again 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:22.979
