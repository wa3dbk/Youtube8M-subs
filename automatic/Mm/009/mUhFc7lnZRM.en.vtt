00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:29.960 
reading and I think the video by Howard

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:31.990 
reading and I think the video by Howard
Lee<00:06:30.170> and<00:06:30.440> who<00:06:30.740> seems<00:06:31.310> to<00:06:31.400> be<00:06:31.460> able<00:06:31.760> to<00:06:31.850> play

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:32.000 
Lee and who seems to be able to play

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.050 
Lee and who seems to be able to play
pretty<00:06:32.750> well<00:06:32.870> anything<00:06:33.530> on<00:06:33.740> the<00:06:33.950> piano<00:06:34.310> she

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:35.060 
pretty well anything on the piano she

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:38.460 
pretty well anything on the piano she
can<00:06:35.210> also<00:06:35.710> sight<00:06:36.710> read<00:06:37.040> anything<00:06:37.670> and

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:38.470 
can also sight read anything and

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:42.750 
can also sight read anything and
transpose<00:06:39.470> and<00:06:39.890> I'd<00:06:40.490> so<00:06:40.850> she's<00:06:41.300> really<00:06:41.680> a

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:42.760
