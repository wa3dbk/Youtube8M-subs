this flat which I need a little more if
we<00:04:21.190> make<00:04:21.549> it<00:04:21.759> flat<00:04:22.060> like<00:04:22.090> this<00:04:24.120> make<00:04:25.120> it<00:04:25.150> a

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:25.419 
we make it flat like this make it a

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:35.610 
we make it flat like this make it a
circle<00:04:27.690> get<00:04:28.690> this<00:04:33.090> it<00:04:34.090> takes<00:04:34.599> the<00:04:34.870> edges<00:04:35.410> off

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
circle get this it takes the edges off

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:50.570 
circle get this it takes the edges off
kinda<00:04:43.530> just<00:04:44.530> no<00:04:44.830> flake<00:04:46.949> so<00:04:48.599> then<00:04:49.599> maybe<00:04:49.930> you

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
kinda just no flake so then maybe you

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.710 
kinda just no flake so then maybe you
could<00:04:51.580> put<00:04:51.849> here<00:04:52.300> and<00:04:52.509> Elsa<00:04:53.110> can<00:04:53.349> stand<00:04:53.740> on<00:04:54.099> it

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 
could put here and Elsa can stand on it

00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:00.420 
could put here and Elsa can stand on it
then<00:04:55.720> take<00:04:56.530> the<00:04:56.849> leftovers<00:04:57.900> and<00:04:58.900> put<00:04:59.860> some
