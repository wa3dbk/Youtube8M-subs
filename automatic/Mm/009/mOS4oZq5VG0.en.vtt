 in the viscount's farm then we 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.340
 we conclude that it should probably 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:32.039
 been born in this house but that he 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.039

 meetings to talk about the environment 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:57.170
 care is a concern 

00:05:54.410 --> 00:06:00.440
 very large that he already had with 

00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:02.770
 need to keep the soil covered 

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.770

 certain place of the woodpecker exists in the world 

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:16.050
 the most important of the imagination more 

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:21.990
 character actually lived here was flames 

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:23.580

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:37.040
 Brazil 

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:42.960
 today for me it's like going back there and 

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:45.000
 become a child because people 

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:47.370
 When we grow up, we can never let 

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.240
 this child spirit die within the 

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:52.400
 people 

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:52.400
 haste enters the story along with it 

00:06:54.180 --> 00:07:02.500
 No, I did not go too much.
