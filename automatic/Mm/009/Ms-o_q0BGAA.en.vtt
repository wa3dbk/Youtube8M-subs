00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:11.280
 there I am occasionally you one 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.320
 Snack recipe for those dogs 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.780
 cookies that you find in 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:19.830
 big malls for once in a while 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.330
 Well, to the joy of the bins, good is good. 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.609
 easy to do you will only need 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:27.269
 of two ingredients what I say 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:29.160
 Now, to you, what are these cups? 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.740
 of baby in pants 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.660
 here it comes this way and it is 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.989
 this for carrot but can use any 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.030
 Taste is - those who have some kind of 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.809
 onion or garlic captain 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:45.660
 only vegetables or fruits and 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:49.230
 whole meal is no longer flour of 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.370
 to integrate and a little bit of 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.140
 water too 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.230
 As we are studying 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:59.520
 audience was a little bit of water and 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:02.430
 also forms so it is to make the 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:07.680
 Cookies in case I bought a kit 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:10.650
 coming in at 4 had a little house that 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.890
 puppy but your direct you can 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.619
 do not matter so it does not matter 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.360
 Okay, so let's go, I 'll go to you. 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:22.170
 they will prepare 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:26.240
 So I got a gang here that we 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.240
 Let's put two cups of flour 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:39.290
 whole flour is one flour plus one 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:42.790
 Rosinho does not need to be crowded, is not it? 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.790
 more like this 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:07.350
 that's another cups 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:10.289
 I prefer obvious people who is the little girl. 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.840
 of baby the two pots concrete a total 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.850
 30 and 42 grams 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.590
 if you find a measure a little 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.650
 otherwise, no problem 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.270
 It's good because you can add water 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:40.769
 today I would not be able to reach the 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:41.640
 right point let's see box is one 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:45.600
 carrot 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:49.140
 tel I went I grew up with this flavor 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:52.050
 of carrots and also of groups is a 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.940
 healthy option is better because saying 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:57.780
 I think other things are coming 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:03:00.480
 mixtures that they can store 11 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:05.239
 animals from any other time 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:08.239
 kind of nutrient and then just mix 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:08.239
 mixture 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:28.420
 this texture of the mass you go 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:30.459
 adding water case after I have 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.290
 put all ingredients mixed 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:34.980
 it's still dry you can be a 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:37.660
 little water 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:40.420
 otherwise a little more flour 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:43.900
 case the other was very much but it is 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:48.360
 So now we're going to open up the mass 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.360
 to make the cookies 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:33.960
 and now you go pro was for 25 to 30 

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:37.900
 minutes 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:40.410
 so here we are ready to 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:43.960
 kill that crying because she wants 

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:48.970

00:05:48.970 --> 00:06:02.800
 Mother does not have to take a handle, you do not want 

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:12.960
