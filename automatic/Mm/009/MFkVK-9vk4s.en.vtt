00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.680
Hello friends welcome to Cosas del Jardin. For a few weeks I will not be able

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.000
to making videos so 
I asked a friend to prepare something for

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:09.859
you guys

00:00:09.859 --> 00:00:11.389
if you do not know Ivan

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:13.570
I recommend it. The channel is

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:16.980
La Huerta de Ivan and the content is very
interesting

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.769
will find tips not only

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:23.419
orchards, but also how to do useful things for the house

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:24.640
and in this video

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:31.640
we will tell you how to sow seeds
chili or pepper

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:37.100
very good my name is Ivan, and today I have had things to take care of the garden

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.180
in this video and teach them to plant
peppers and chilies in seedlings

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.180
first thing is to select a variety
grow well in the area

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.800
tell us this well since the
variety we sow will be adapted to

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.960
a climate and specific conditions

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.390
whatever the culture medium
remember what clean for

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.670
prevent fungus and disease in our
plants

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.800
in this case I have here as an example

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.260
a hotbed of cork and one of
plastic

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.590
We will use the plastic as it has fewer alveoli

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.890
and plants may be on the
time

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.360
the substrate will use a special substrate for nurseries sell well

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.240
already prepared, mixed

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.340
but we can also mix us so we get cheaper

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.020
we have to put parts of land and
parts of perlite

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:31.050
in some it is advisable to add coir I think you have

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:37.370
to resist moisture and not more
have to water it so long

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:39.120
if we want

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.390
germination peppers or chilies are more premature the'll have a

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.470
day soak

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.670
I've opened and

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.440
come in a pretty healthy container, airtight

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.060
and we proceed

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:03.640
fill the seed

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:10.640
fill all containers. always almost to the edge,

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.640
never get to the edge, otherwise

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:14.429
then the water

00:02:14.429 --> 00:02:17.799
will move the earth

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:24.799
and thereby the seeds

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.360
once we have the alveoli filled with substrate

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:47.539
proceed to place the seeds

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:49.439
and in my case

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:53.369
and on a personal level or advice only
place 2

00:02:53.369 --> 00:02:54.619
whereby

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:56.689
you warrant

00:02:56.689 --> 00:02:58.039
that any exit

00:02:58.039 --> 00:03:01.009
they

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:04.829
put into containers and now
proceed

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:11.829
sprinkle with a bit of substrate

00:03:18.719 --> 00:03:22.339
because dusting? because
Experience tells me what

00:03:22.339 --> 00:03:23.810
if buried

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.349
at very high depth this seed

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:34.349
does not usually born

00:03:35.279 --> 00:03:37.729
good in this case is already

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:42.469
if planteÃ¡semos else advisable
would put rods or stickers that

00:03:42.469 --> 00:03:46.669
They will tell us that we culture
These alveoli

00:03:46.669 --> 00:03:51.749
once marked would proceed to irrigation
a first irrigation is moist but

00:03:51.749 --> 00:03:53.059
I do not encharcado

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:57.459
and if we want to increase germination
We can cover with plastic

00:03:57.459 --> 00:03:59.729
and created as a greenhouse

00:03:59.729 --> 00:04:03.159
remember that at this stage the seed has to 4estar in a warm place

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:04.849
why am I doing at home

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:07.509
and that not of the sun directly

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:11.679
and that's all in about ten or fifteen days
will flow from the first

00:04:11.679 --> 00:04:15.199
remember that the plant has to be
developed for transplanting

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:17.289
the orchard or macetohuerto

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:21.029
I use a rule lei internet called 6x6. which are

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:22.240
6 inches

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:27.059
that are about 15 inches from the
plant stem

00:04:27.059 --> 00:04:28.800
and six weeks in the nursery

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.469
it did last year really
that was great

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:36.799
thank you very much for lending gabriel
