pulled the four traps and we had the
best<00:02:27.540> catch<00:02:27.959> that<00:02:28.769> we've<00:02:28.920> ever<00:02:29.069> done

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
best catch that we've ever done

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.289 
best catch that we've ever done
we<00:02:29.579> pulled<00:02:29.940> 118<00:02:30.930> crayfish<00:02:31.500> today<00:02:32.120> and<00:02:33.120> that

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
was with only four traps the best day we

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.430 
was with only four traps the best day we
had<00:02:35.129> done<00:02:35.280> previously<00:02:35.730> was<00:02:35.909> 115<00:02:36.720> using<00:02:37.110> six

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
had done previously was 115 using six

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.569 
had done previously was 115 using six
traps<00:02:37.739> so<00:02:38.670> using<00:02:39.329> the<00:02:39.510> the<00:02:40.230> grouses<00:02:40.890> that<00:02:41.459> we

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:41.579 
traps so using the the grouses that we

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:43.430 
traps so using the the grouses that we
used<00:02:41.819> for<00:02:42.030> bait<00:02:42.239> tying<00:02:42.569> it<00:02:42.750> to<00:02:42.840> the<00:02:42.870> top<00:02:43.140> worked

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
used for bait tying it to the top worked

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.910 
used for bait tying it to the top worked
real<00:02:43.709> well

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
real well

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.440 
real well
there<00:02:44.519> was<00:02:44.609> still<00:02:44.790> a<00:02:44.819> little<00:02:45.000> bit<00:02:45.209> of<00:02:45.329> meat

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
there was still a little bit of meat

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.089 
there was still a little bit of meat
left<00:02:45.629> on<00:02:45.810> solve<00:02:46.109> them<00:02:46.260> so<00:02:46.440> we<00:02:46.530> threw<00:02:46.739> all<00:02:46.859> four

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:47.099 
left on solve them so we threw all four

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:50.509 
left on solve them so we threw all four
traps<00:02:47.400> back<00:02:47.640> again<00:02:48.120> and<00:02:48.989> tomorrow<00:02:49.530> after<00:02:50.370> work

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 
traps back again and tomorrow after work

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:53.089 
traps back again and tomorrow after work
I'll<00:02:50.670> go<00:02:50.790> check<00:02:51.000> them<00:02:51.209> but<00:02:51.739> this<00:02:52.739> time<00:02:52.950> I<00:02:52.980> think

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:53.099 
I'll go check them but this time I think

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:54.710 
I'll go check them but this time I think
what<00:02:53.310> I'm<00:02:53.400> gonna<00:02:53.489> do<00:02:53.670> is<00:02:53.849> after<00:02:54.120> I<00:02:54.150> clean<00:02:54.420> me<00:02:54.569> is

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
what I'm gonna do is after I clean me is

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.530 
what I'm gonna do is after I clean me is
the<00:02:55.409> stuff<00:02:55.680> that<00:02:55.709> I<00:02:56.340> would<00:02:56.970> normally<00:02:57.090> go<00:02:57.390> into

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
the stuff that I would normally go into

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.330 
the stuff that I would normally go into
the<00:02:57.599> garbage<00:02:57.750> can<00:02:58.049> somebody<00:02:58.319> has<00:02:58.590> suggested

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
the garbage can somebody has suggested

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:00.680 
the garbage can somebody has suggested
that<00:02:59.400> they<00:02:59.609> use<00:02:59.819> that<00:03:00.060> as<00:03:00.269> bait

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
that they use that as bait

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.980 
that they use that as bait
so<00:03:00.840> I<00:03:00.870> think<00:03:01.230> I'm<00:03:01.349> gonna<00:03:01.440> give<00:03:01.620> that<00:03:01.650> a<00:03:01.799> try
