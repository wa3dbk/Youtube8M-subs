interesting<00:00:11.530> thing<00:00:11.920> is<00:00:12.130> is<00:00:12.370> one<00:00:13.240> over<00:00:13.389> you<00:00:13.480> can

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:13.570 
interesting thing is is one over you can

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:15.180 
interesting thing is is one over you can
see<00:00:13.719> this<00:00:13.929> bubble<00:00:14.259> plate<00:00:14.469> in<00:00:14.740> here<00:00:14.950> you<00:00:15.070> can

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:15.190 
see this bubble plate in here you can

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:17.760 
see this bubble plate in here you can
actually<00:00:15.280> take<00:00:15.700> off<00:00:16.140> there's<00:00:17.140> a<00:00:17.230> screw<00:00:17.470> so<00:00:17.500> you

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:17.770 
actually take off there's a screw so you

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:19.109 
actually take off there's a screw so you
can<00:00:17.920> clean<00:00:18.070> the<00:00:18.190> underneath<00:00:18.580> side<00:00:18.760> but<00:00:19.060> you

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:19.119 
can clean the underneath side but you

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:20.849 
can clean the underneath side but you
can't<00:00:19.359> get<00:00:19.539> down<00:00:19.720> the<00:00:19.960> out<00:00:20.439> of<00:00:20.560> the<00:00:20.619> skimmer

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:20.859 
can't get down the out of the skimmer

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:23.250 
can't get down the out of the skimmer
body<00:00:21.130> the<00:00:22.029> skimmer<00:00:22.270> body<00:00:22.480> obviously<00:00:22.720> doesn't

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:23.260 
body the skimmer body obviously doesn't

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:27.450 
body the skimmer body obviously doesn't
come<00:00:23.439> apart<00:00:23.560> here<00:00:24.160> so<00:00:25.199> we<00:00:26.199> say<00:00:26.380> yeah<00:00:27.250> it

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:27.460 
come apart here so we say yeah it

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:28.560 
come apart here so we say yeah it
doesn't<00:00:27.609> come<00:00:27.849> apart<00:00:27.970> it's<00:00:28.300> pretty<00:00:28.449> much

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:28.570 
doesn't come apart it's pretty much

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.390 
doesn't come apart it's pretty much
glued<00:00:28.750> together<00:00:28.960> but<00:00:29.890> you<00:00:29.980> can't<00:00:30.189> take<00:00:30.340> the

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:30.400 
glued together but you can't take the

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.830 
glued together but you can't take the
bubble<00:00:30.609> play<00:00:30.820> off<00:00:31.000> the<00:00:31.150> scrubber<00:00:31.480> it's<00:00:31.810> a

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:31.840 
bubble play off the scrubber it's a

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:32.940 
bubble play off the scrubber it's a
little<00:00:32.019> bit<00:00:32.110> challenging<00:00:32.290> because<00:00:32.710> it's

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:32.950 
little bit challenging because it's

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:35.400 
little bit challenging because it's
inside<00:00:33.280> the<00:00:33.430> body<00:00:33.809> but<00:00:34.809> the<00:00:34.870> body<00:00:34.899> is<00:00:35.170> big

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:35.410 
inside the body but the body is big

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.799 
inside the body but the body is big
enough<00:00:35.680> to<00:00:35.980> where<00:00:36.190> you<00:00:37.090> can<00:00:37.120> clean<00:00:37.390> the<00:00:37.510> inside

00:00:37.799 --> 00:00:37.809 
enough to where you can clean the inside

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:40.619 
enough to where you can clean the inside
real<00:00:37.989> good<00:00:38.170> if<00:00:38.290> you<00:00:38.379> wanted<00:00:38.620> to<00:00:39.300> this<00:00:40.300> thing<00:00:40.510> I

00:00:40.619 --> 00:00:40.629 
real good if you wanted to this thing I

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:42.630 
real good if you wanted to this thing I
don't<00:00:40.719> think<00:00:40.870> I've<00:00:41.440> cleaned<00:00:41.649> it<00:00:41.739> once<00:00:41.950> since

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:42.640 
don't think I've cleaned it once since

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.119 
don't think I've cleaned it once since
I've<00:00:42.820> had<00:00:43.000> it<00:00:43.210> not<00:00:44.140> too<00:00:44.320> bad<00:00:44.530> I<00:00:44.559> was<00:00:44.860> running

00:00:45.119 --> 00:00:45.129 
I've had it not too bad I was running

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:47.010 
I've had it not too bad I was running
running<00:00:45.370> kalkwasser<00:00:45.940> for<00:00:46.420> a<00:00:46.450> while<00:00:46.600> and<00:00:46.930> it

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:47.020 
running kalkwasser for a while and it

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.470 
running kalkwasser for a while and it
accumulated<00:00:48.010> all<00:00:48.100> sorts<00:00:48.340> of<00:00:48.430> chunky<00:00:48.789> chunks

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:49.480 
accumulated all sorts of chunky chunks

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.380 
accumulated all sorts of chunky chunks
in<00:00:49.629> there<00:00:49.890> deposits<00:00:50.890> in<00:00:51.010> there<00:00:51.160> which<00:00:51.390> I'm

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:52.390 
in there deposits in there which I'm

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:53.670 
in there deposits in there which I'm
completing<00:00:52.780> it<00:00:53.020> getting<00:00:53.410> away<00:00:53.500> from

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:53.680 
completing it getting away from

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.160 
completing it getting away from
kalkwasser<00:00:54.219> because<00:00:54.699> of<00:00:54.820> that<00:00:54.940> but<00:00:55.840> you<00:00:56.020> can

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170 
kalkwasser because of that but you can

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:01.040 
kalkwasser because of that but you can
see<00:00:56.699> it's<00:00:57.699> a<00:00:57.789> pretty<00:00:57.940> decent<00:00:58.449> sized<00:00:58.660> skimmer

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050

body wise it's is I would say it's the

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 
same size it's more volume because of

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.130 
same size it's more volume because of
the<00:01:09.610> shape<00:01:09.820> it's<00:01:10.119> just<00:01:10.360> a<00:01:10.450> cylinder<00:01:10.750> instead

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.140

really like it see how nice it spins
it's<00:01:26.650> really<00:01:26.890> nice<00:01:27.070> you<00:01:27.369> can't<00:01:27.700> be<00:01:28.689> some<00:01:28.869> other

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
it's really nice you can't be some other

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:30.569 
it's really nice you can't be some other
scheme<00:01:29.320> I<00:01:29.439> wasn't<00:01:29.740> able<00:01:29.799> to<00:01:29.920> take<00:01:30.100> it<00:01:30.250> off<00:01:30.400> I

don't<00:01:30.640> know<00:01:30.759> how<00:01:30.850> they<00:01:31.000> had<00:01:31.119> this<00:01:31.240> thing

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
don't know how they had this thing

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.080 
don't know how they had this thing
thread<00:01:31.720> on<00:01:31.900> here<00:01:32.170> but<00:01:32.409> you<00:01:32.680> basically<00:01:33.640> pull<00:01:34.030> it

this<00:01:47.439> down<00:01:47.680> so<00:01:47.920> it<00:01:48.250> doesn't<00:01:48.610> turn<00:01:48.810> there's<00:01:49.810> a

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930 
this down so it doesn't turn there's a

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:54.600 
this down so it doesn't turn there's a
spin<00:01:50.290> so<00:01:50.619> easily<00:01:52.710> so<00:01:53.710> that<00:01:53.890> you<00:01:53.979> can<00:01:54.130> just<00:01:54.369> lock

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
spin so easily so that you can just lock

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.859 
spin so easily so that you can just lock
it<00:01:54.790> down<00:01:55.649> to<00:01:56.649> inputs<00:01:57.070> I<00:01:57.399> I<00:01:57.700> would<00:01:57.969> imagine<00:01:58.180> it's

00:01:58.859 --> 00:01:58.869 
it down to inputs I I would imagine it's

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:00.780 
it down to inputs I I would imagine it's
kind<00:01:59.049> of<00:01:59.079> nice<00:01:59.229> to<00:01:59.290> have<00:01:59.590> these<00:01:59.740> two<00:02:00.009> I<00:02:00.219> think

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:00.790 
kind of nice to have these two I think

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:02.940 
kind of nice to have these two I think
you<00:02:01.420> know<00:02:01.509> if<00:02:01.630> I<00:02:01.780> were<00:02:01.990> I<00:02:02.290> seriously<00:02:02.619> thought

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
you know if I were I seriously thought

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.289 
you know if I were I seriously thought
about<00:02:03.009> like<00:02:03.460> I<00:02:03.549> said<00:02:04.140> getting<00:02:05.140> some<00:02:06.299> bubble

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:07.299 
about like I said getting some bubble

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:08.940 
about like I said getting some bubble
blasters<00:02:07.750> and<00:02:07.960> trying<00:02:08.200> it<00:02:08.349> out<00:02:08.440> on<00:02:08.500> this<00:02:08.709> body

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
blasters and trying it out on this body

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:10.499 
blasters and trying it out on this body
cuz<00:02:09.220> his<00:02:09.369> body's<00:02:09.700> pretty<00:02:09.970> social<00:02:10.209> tantrum

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
cuz his body's pretty social tantrum

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.270 
cuz his body's pretty social tantrum
size<00:02:10.780> of<00:02:10.899> the<00:02:10.989> bubble<00:02:11.230> plates<00:02:11.440> big

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
size of the bubble plates big

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.840 
size of the bubble plates big
one<00:02:13.970> thing<00:02:14.150> about<00:02:14.180> the<00:02:14.600> cedra<00:02:14.960> is<00:02:15.050> 7,000<00:02:15.850> is

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
one thing about the cedra is 7,000 is

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.780 
one thing about the cedra is 7,000 is
that<00:02:17.240> I<00:02:17.450> think<00:02:17.810> it<00:02:17.960> pumps<00:02:18.380> a<00:02:18.620> lot<00:02:18.890> of<00:02:19.010> water<00:02:19.280> as

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
that I think it pumps a lot of water as

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:26.620 
that I think it pumps a lot of water as
well<00:02:20.060> as<00:02:20.710> not<00:02:21.710> so<00:02:21.890> much<00:02:22.070> a<00:02:22.100> lot<00:02:22.370> of<00:02:22.490> air<00:02:22.780> so<00:02:25.630> what

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
well as not so much a lot of air so what

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.150 
well as not so much a lot of air so what
happens<00:02:26.990> is<00:02:27.080> a<00:02:27.110> lot<00:02:27.170> of<00:02:27.260> micro<00:02:27.590> bubbles<00:02:27.770> comes

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
happens is a lot of micro bubbles comes

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.730 
happens is a lot of micro bubbles comes
out<00:02:28.370> but<00:02:29.240> I<00:02:29.300> think<00:02:29.420> the<00:02:29.600> skimmer<00:02:30.020> itself<00:02:30.620> is

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:30.740 
out but I think the skimmer itself is

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:32.940 
out but I think the skimmer itself is
pretty<00:02:30.980> good<00:02:31.100> bubble<00:02:31.520> plates<00:02:31.730> nice<00:02:31.970> and<00:02:32.180> big

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
pretty good bubble plates nice and big

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.770 
pretty good bubble plates nice and big
you<00:02:33.950> know<00:02:34.040> there's<00:02:34.250> not<00:02:34.370> there's<00:02:34.780> probably

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
you know there's not there's probably

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.290 
you know there's not there's probably
not<00:02:35.900> as<00:02:36.050> nicely<00:02:36.350> design<00:02:37.280> as<00:02:37.550> this<00:02:37.760> there's<00:02:38.180> no

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
not as nicely design as this there's no

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.900 
not as nicely design as this there's no
like<00:02:38.600> the<00:02:38.870> outside<00:02:39.200> ring<00:02:39.410> here<00:02:39.680> but<00:02:40.670> I<00:02:40.700> don't

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
like the outside ring here but I don't

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.960 
like the outside ring here but I don't
know<00:02:41.030> how<00:02:41.450> necessary<00:02:42.050> that<00:02:42.230> is<00:02:42.380> actually<00:02:42.970> you

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
know how necessary that is actually you

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:45.940 
know how necessary that is actually you
can<00:02:44.030> see<00:02:44.300> inside<00:02:44.870> here<00:02:45.170> there's<00:02:45.560> quite<00:02:45.620> a<00:02:45.770> bit

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
can see inside here there's quite a bit

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.660 
can see inside here there's quite a bit
of<00:02:46.100> space<00:02:46.400> for<00:02:46.780> I<00:02:47.780> guess<00:02:48.410> water<00:02:48.770> flow<00:02:49.190> compared

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
of space for I guess water flow compared

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.400 
of space for I guess water flow compared
to<00:02:49.910> with<00:02:50.180> the<00:02:50.300> mobile<00:02:50.480> King<00:02:50.720> is<00:02:50.870> in<00:02:51.110> terms<00:02:51.320> of

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
to with the mobile King is in terms of

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:52.320 
to with the mobile King is in terms of
height<00:02:51.590> there

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
height there

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.770 
height there
likewise<00:02:53.330> the<00:02:53.959> similar<00:02:55.420> bubble<00:02:56.420> King<00:02:56.600> right

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
likewise the similar bubble King right

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.710 
likewise the similar bubble King right
now<00:02:56.810> looks<00:02:57.200> like<00:02:57.350> it's<00:02:57.500> a<00:02:57.590> little<00:02:57.740> bit<00:02:57.950> taller

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
now looks like it's a little bit taller

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.100 
now looks like it's a little bit taller
overall<00:03:00.100> and<00:03:01.100> I<00:03:01.130> think<00:03:01.370> part<00:03:01.640> of<00:03:01.670> it<00:03:01.820> is<00:03:02.110> this

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
overall and I think part of it is this

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.610 
overall and I think part of it is this
part<00:03:03.500> here<00:03:03.830> the<00:03:04.070> neck<00:03:04.250> is<00:03:04.459> definitely<00:03:05.320> I<00:03:06.320> think

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
part here the neck is definitely I think

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.740 
part here the neck is definitely I think
a<00:03:06.920> little<00:03:07.040> bit<00:03:07.160> taller<00:03:07.430> in<00:03:07.790> this<00:03:08.150> design<00:03:08.540> of

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
a little bit taller in this design of

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:13.270 
a little bit taller in this design of
the<00:03:08.840> bubble<00:03:09.080> King<00:03:10.090> two<00:03:11.500> air<00:03:12.500> silencer<00:03:13.160> of

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
the bubble King two air silencer of

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.880 
the bubble King two air silencer of
these<00:03:13.459> the<00:03:14.360> tube<00:03:14.750> here's<00:03:15.110> it's<00:03:15.410> pretty<00:03:15.620> wall

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
these the tube here's it's pretty wall

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:17.650 
these the tube here's it's pretty wall
design<00:03:16.280> in<00:03:16.550> my<00:03:16.700> mind<00:03:16.940> pretty<00:03:17.060> well<00:03:17.330> designed

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 
design in my mind pretty well designed

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.710 
design in my mind pretty well designed
skimmer<00:03:18.760> the<00:03:19.760> tubes<00:03:20.030> here's<00:03:20.360> a<00:03:20.420> little<00:03:20.630> bit

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
skimmer the tubes here's a little bit

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.890 
skimmer the tubes here's a little bit
small<00:03:20.959> I<00:03:20.989> think<00:03:21.440> if<00:03:21.980> you<00:03:22.610> if<00:03:23.030> you<00:03:23.360> were<00:03:23.570> to<00:03:23.630> put

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
small I think if you if you were to put

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.140 
small I think if you if you were to put
bubble<00:03:24.560> blasters<00:03:24.980> on<00:03:25.160> here<00:03:25.370> you<00:03:25.580> could<00:03:25.850> modify

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
bubble blasters on here you could modify

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:31.990 
bubble blasters on here you could modify
this<00:03:26.890> silencer<00:03:27.890> put<00:03:28.340> bigger<00:03:29.890> hole<00:03:31.000> bigger

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
this silencer put bigger hole bigger

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.930 
this silencer put bigger hole bigger
pipes<00:03:32.330> into<00:03:32.570> here<00:03:32.840> and<00:03:33.310> drill<00:03:34.310> this<00:03:34.430> out<00:03:34.640> and

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
pipes into here and drill this out and

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.229 
pipes into here and drill this out and
make<00:03:35.090> it<00:03:35.120> a<00:03:35.269> decent<00:03:36.140> size<00:03:36.500> built<00:03:36.800> on<00:03:36.980> silencer

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 
make it a decent size built on silencer

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:40.900 
make it a decent size built on silencer
I<00:03:38.269> think<00:03:39.080> if<00:03:39.709> nobody<00:03:40.010> buys<00:03:40.160> the<00:03:40.400> skimmer<00:03:40.670> from

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
I think if nobody buys the skimmer from

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:42.580 
I think if nobody buys the skimmer from
me<00:03:41.030> I<00:03:41.060> think<00:03:41.180> that's<00:03:41.480> I<00:03:41.720> may<00:03:41.989> eventually<00:03:42.320> do

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
me I think that's I may eventually do

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:43.930 
me I think that's I may eventually do
that<00:03:42.769> just<00:03:43.010> as<00:03:43.100> an<00:03:43.250> experiment

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
that just as an experiment

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.470 
that just as an experiment
why<00:03:44.840> because<00:03:45.200> I<00:03:45.320> can<00:03:45.620> I<00:03:45.650> guess<00:03:46.010> and<00:03:46.280> see<00:03:46.489> this

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
why because I can I guess and see this

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:48.759 
why because I can I guess and see this
is<00:03:47.600> it<00:03:47.690> really<00:03:47.900> that<00:03:48.170> big<00:03:48.380> of<00:03:48.530> a<00:03:48.590> difference

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:48.769 
is it really that big of a difference

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:51.610 
is it really that big of a difference
it's<00:03:49.100> probably<00:03:49.400> not<00:03:49.549> but<00:03:50.410> you<00:03:51.410> know<00:03:51.530> I<00:03:51.560> just

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
it's probably not but you know I just

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.850 
it's probably not but you know I just
like<00:03:51.860> to<00:03:51.980> play<00:03:52.100> around<00:03:53.110> so<00:03:54.110> two<00:03:54.320> pumps<00:03:54.650> here

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:54.860 
like to play around so two pumps here

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.940 
like to play around so two pumps here
and<00:03:55.510> you<00:03:56.510> can<00:03:56.630> see<00:03:56.810> the<00:03:57.110> size<00:03:57.350> of<00:03:57.560> it<00:03:57.680> it's<00:03:57.860> a

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
and you can see the size of it it's a

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.789 
and you can see the size of it it's a
good<00:03:58.130> it's<00:03:59.000> very<00:03:59.330> similar<00:03:59.900> in<00:04:00.140> size<00:04:00.320> and<00:04:00.709> very

00:04:00.789 --> 00:04:00.799 
good it's very similar in size and very

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:02.410 
good it's very similar in size and very
similar<00:04:01.130> in<00:04:01.340> design<00:04:01.459> I<00:04:01.670> mean<00:04:01.940> in<00:04:02.060> terms<00:04:02.209> of

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:02.420 
similar in design I mean in terms of

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:08.440 
similar in design I mean in terms of
this<00:04:03.410> is<00:04:03.590> a<00:04:03.620> general<00:04:03.950> concept<00:04:06.970> see<00:04:07.970> diameter

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:08.450 
this is a general concept see diameter

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:11.020 
this is a general concept see diameter
wise<00:04:08.660> the<00:04:09.290> lids<00:04:09.530> very<00:04:10.250> similar<00:04:10.640> I<00:04:10.760> can<00:04:10.910> almost

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
wise the lids very similar I can almost

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:14.289 
wise the lids very similar I can almost
think<00:04:11.470> it<00:04:12.470> much<00:04:13.340> swap<00:04:13.640> these<00:04:13.820> two<00:04:13.880> lids

00:04:14.289 --> 00:04:14.299 
think it much swap these two lids

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:17.229 
think it much swap these two lids
actually<00:04:15.070> and<00:04:16.070> you<00:04:16.190> and<00:04:16.640> that's<00:04:16.790> and<00:04:17.060> that's

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 
actually and you and that's and that's

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:18.699 
actually and you and that's and that's
that's<00:04:17.570> one<00:04:17.690> of<00:04:17.780> the<00:04:17.840> reasons<00:04:18.109> I<00:04:18.229> bought<00:04:18.470> this

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
that's one of the reasons I bought this

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:23.500 
that's one of the reasons I bought this
bubble<00:04:19.100> King<00:04:19.310> is<00:04:19.519> that<00:04:19.729> I<00:04:21.160> wanted<00:04:22.160> to<00:04:22.419> be<00:04:23.419> able

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.510 
bubble King is that I wanted to be able

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:26.090 
bubble King is that I wanted to be able
to<00:04:23.660> use<00:04:23.810> my<00:04:24.020> swabby<00:04:24.800> basically

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100 
to use my swabby basically

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:27.770 
to use my swabby basically
on<00:04:26.340> the<00:04:26.490> bubble<00:04:26.760> King<00:04:27.000> can<00:04:27.270> not<00:04:27.420> have<00:04:27.570> to<00:04:27.600> buy

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
on the bubble King can not have to buy

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:32.720 
on the bubble King can not have to buy
another<00:04:28.020> one<00:04:28.140> of<00:04:28.320> those<00:04:28.700> so<00:04:29.700> that's<00:04:30.450> it<00:04:31.730> and

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:32.730 
another one of those so that's it and

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:33.980 
another one of those so that's it and
say<00:04:32.970> I<00:04:33.000> don't<00:04:33.210> you<00:04:33.510> know<00:04:33.600> I<00:04:33.630> don't<00:04:33.750> necessarily

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
say I don't you know I don't necessarily

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.470 
say I don't you know I don't necessarily
expect<00:04:34.470> necessarily<00:04:35.010> a<00:04:35.040> huge<00:04:35.820> huge

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:36.480 
expect necessarily a huge huge

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.420 
expect necessarily a huge huge
improvement<00:04:37.230> although<00:04:37.770> I'll<00:04:37.950> probably<00:04:38.190> will

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
improvement although I'll probably will

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.730 
improvement although I'll probably will
get<00:04:38.580> it<00:04:38.700> with<00:04:38.790> a<00:04:38.880> bowl<00:04:39.030> King<00:04:39.380> in<00:04:40.380> terms<00:04:40.590> of

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
get it with a bowl King in terms of

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.100 
get it with a bowl King in terms of
skimming<00:04:41.100> but<00:04:42.030> efficiency<00:04:42.720> wise<00:04:42.870> I<00:04:42.900> think

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
skimming but efficiency wise I think

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:45.470 
skimming but efficiency wise I think
it's<00:04:43.380> probably<00:04:43.770> a<00:04:43.830> lot<00:04:43.950> better<00:04:44.010> and<00:04:44.520> then

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:45.480 
it's probably a lot better and then

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.380 
it's probably a lot better and then
noise<00:04:46.200> wise<00:04:46.530> I<00:04:46.830> can<00:04:47.730> expect<00:04:48.060> a<00:04:48.120> little<00:04:48.270> bit

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:48.390 
noise wise I can expect a little bit

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:52.490 
noise wise I can expect a little bit
better<00:04:48.720> performance<00:04:49.320> in<00:04:49.410> terms<00:04:49.560> of<00:04:49.710> noise<00:04:51.500> let

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 
better performance in terms of noise let

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.310 
better performance in terms of noise let
me<00:04:52.590> show<00:04:52.710> you<00:04:52.770> my<00:04:52.950> tank<00:04:53.250> real<00:04:53.460> quick<00:04:54.140> so<00:04:55.140> it's

tough to take pictures of this tank

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.110 
tough to take pictures of this tank

I've actually ordered some some
roller-blind<00:05:09.030> so<00:05:09.450> I<00:05:09.480> can<00:05:09.630> actually<00:05:09.780> pull<00:05:10.110> it

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:19.590 
don't know you can hear the noise I'm

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:22.610 
don't know you can hear the noise I'm
one<00:05:20.580> of<00:05:20.670> the<00:05:20.730> last<00:05:20.910> things<00:05:21.240> on<00:05:21.420> my<00:05:21.570> list<00:05:22.440> of

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:22.620

one of the last things on my list of
things<00:05:22.800> to<00:05:22.980> do<00:05:23.250> here<00:05:23.610> is<00:05:24.300> to<00:05:24.570> fix<00:05:24.750> the<00:05:24.840> overflow

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:25.380 
things to do here is to fix the overflow

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:27.830 
things to do here is to fix the overflow
in<00:05:26.160> general<00:05:26.640> my<00:05:26.790> overflow<00:05:27.240> is<00:05:27.300> pretty<00:05:27.600> quiet

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:27.840 
in general my overflow is pretty quiet

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.170 
in general my overflow is pretty quiet
but<00:05:28.680> occasionally<00:05:29.520> you<00:05:29.670> get<00:05:29.820> this<00:05:29.940> big

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:30.180 
but occasionally you get this big

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.480 
but occasionally you get this big
massive<00:05:30.480> gurgling<00:05:31.020> loins<00:05:31.230> and<00:05:32.160> I<00:05:32.220> believe

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:32.490 
massive gurgling loins and I believe

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:36.230 
massive gurgling loins and I believe
it's<00:05:32.700> because<00:05:32.910> my<00:05:33.390> um<00:05:33.600> my<00:05:34.820> awful<00:05:35.820> pipe<00:05:36.030> is<00:05:36.210> not

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:36.240 
it's because my um my awful pipe is not

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:39.620 
it's because my um my awful pipe is not
big<00:05:36.570> enough<00:05:36.600> it's<00:05:37.050> still<00:05:37.260> too<00:05:37.440> small<00:05:37.800> so<00:05:38.700> these

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:39.630 
big enough it's still too small so these

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:41.420 
big enough it's still too small so these
days<00:05:39.840> I'll<00:05:40.110> stop<00:05:40.410> being<00:05:40.650> lazy<00:05:40.830> and<00:05:41.100> drain<00:05:41.280> out

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:41.430 
days I'll stop being lazy and drain out

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:44.090 
days I'll stop being lazy and drain out
that<00:05:41.640> I<00:05:42.410> guess<00:05:43.410> that<00:05:43.440> section<00:05:43.920> of<00:05:44.070> the

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:44.100 
that I guess that section of the

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:47.600 
that I guess that section of the
overflow<00:05:44.580> and<00:05:44.790> put<00:05:44.940> in<00:05:45.060> a<00:05:45.150> new<00:05:45.300> sand<00:05:46.260> pipe<00:05:46.610> to

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:47.610 
overflow and put in a new sand pipe to

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:49.490 
overflow and put in a new sand pipe to
make<00:05:47.730> it<00:05:47.880> better<00:05:48.150> and<00:05:48.750> I<00:05:49.020> really<00:05:49.050> want<00:05:49.410> to

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:49.500 
make it better and I really want to

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.510 
make it better and I really want to
quiet<00:05:49.680> my<00:05:49.920> pup<00:05:50.430> my<00:05:50.880> tank<00:05:51.240> upstairs<00:05:51.690> is

mine<00:05:59.310> up<00:05:59.580> there<00:05:59.610> I<00:05:59.820> designed<00:06:00.300> it<00:06:00.480> and<00:06:00.660> built<00:06:01.380> it

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:01.560 
mine up there I designed it and built it

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.020 
mine up there I designed it and built it
and<00:06:01.800> the<00:06:01.980> part<00:06:02.310> of<00:06:02.370> the<00:06:02.430> requirement<00:06:02.910> there

the<00:06:11.610> water<00:06:11.790> so<00:06:12.350> that's<00:06:13.350> how<00:06:13.560> quiet<00:06:13.830> I've<00:06:14.010> been

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:14.130 
the water so that's how quiet I've been

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:15.920 
the water so that's how quiet I've been
able<00:06:14.250> to<00:06:14.370> get<00:06:14.550> it<00:06:14.640> so<00:06:14.790> I'm<00:06:15.210> hoping<00:06:15.690> to<00:06:15.810> be<00:06:15.900> able

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:15.930 
able to get it so I'm hoping to be able

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:17.240 
able to get it so I'm hoping to be able
to<00:06:16.080> do<00:06:16.170> the<00:06:16.260> same<00:06:16.440> thing<00:06:16.650> down<00:06:16.770> here<00:06:16.950> to<00:06:17.130> make

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:17.250 
to do the same thing down here to make

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:20.030 
to do the same thing down here to make
it<00:06:17.340> extremely<00:06:17.580> quiet<00:06:17.910> as<00:06:18.150> well<00:06:18.830> it's<00:06:19.830> kind<00:06:19.980> of

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:20.040 
it extremely quiet as well it's kind of

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:22.040 
it extremely quiet as well it's kind of
tough<00:06:20.220> to<00:06:20.340> see<00:06:20.520> if<00:06:20.640> this<00:06:21.060> that<00:06:21.330> what<00:06:21.720> the<00:06:21.840> tank

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:22.050 
tough to see if this that what the tank

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:25.880 
tough to see if this that what the tank
looks<00:06:22.230> like<00:06:23.090> with<00:06:24.090> the<00:06:24.240> lighting<00:06:24.600> but<00:06:25.530> anyways

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:25.890 
looks like with the lighting but anyways

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:28.880 
looks like with the lighting but anyways
so<00:06:26.660> what<00:06:27.660> we'll<00:06:27.810> do<00:06:27.900> now<00:06:28.020> is<00:06:28.260> clean<00:06:28.440> on<00:06:28.590> my<00:06:28.620> some

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:28.890 
so what we'll do now is clean on my some

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:31.070 
so what we'll do now is clean on my some
you<00:06:28.980> can<00:06:29.130> see<00:06:29.280> there<00:06:29.460> I<00:06:29.730> do<00:06:30.300> it<00:06:30.480> yourself<00:06:30.810> skim

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:31.080 
you can see there I do it yourself skim

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:33.710 
you can see there I do it yourself skim
8<00:06:31.260> volt<00:06:32.190> I<00:06:32.460> think<00:06:32.940> it<00:06:33.060> works<00:06:33.210> really<00:06:33.390> well<00:06:33.600> it's

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:33.720 
8 volt I think it works really well it's

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:36.159 
8 volt I think it works really well it's
easy<00:06:33.900> to<00:06:34.080> do<00:06:34.230> if<00:06:34.440> it's<00:06:34.590> a<00:06:34.650> basically<00:06:34.919> a<00:06:35.010> couple

00:06:36.159 --> 00:06:36.169 
easy to do if it's a basically a couple

00:06:36.169 --> 00:06:38.450 
easy to do if it's a basically a couple
pieces<00:06:37.169> Tupperware<00:06:37.800> the<00:06:37.890> top<00:06:38.100> there<00:06:38.370> is

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:38.460 
pieces Tupperware the top there is

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:39.600

the bottom is just a gallon gallon thing
a<00:06:41.979> temple<00:06:42.280> where<00:06:42.430> it's<00:06:42.550> kind<00:06:42.759> of<00:06:42.789> rectangular

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:43.500 
a temple where it's kind of rectangular

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:47.189 
a temple where it's kind of rectangular
flows<00:06:44.500> through<00:06:44.740> there<00:06:44.979> and<00:06:45.250> there's<00:06:45.430> the<00:06:46.199> this

00:06:47.189 --> 00:06:47.199 
flows through there and there's the this

00:06:47.199 --> 00:06:49.559 
flows through there and there's the this
the<00:06:47.500> overflow<00:06:47.919> will<00:06:48.099> float<00:06:48.310> switch<00:06:48.580> to<00:06:49.330> shut

00:06:49.559 --> 00:06:49.569 
the overflow will float switch to shut

00:06:49.569 --> 00:06:50.909 
the overflow will float switch to shut
off<00:06:49.659> the<00:06:49.840> skimmer<00:06:50.110> and<00:06:50.259> everything<00:06:50.650> when<00:06:50.800> it

off the skimmer and everything when it

00:06:50.919 --> 00:06:54.689 
off the skimmer and everything when it
down<00:06:51.159> overflows<00:06:51.669> but<00:06:52.599> very<00:06:52.810> easy<00:06:52.900> to<00:06:53.590> take<00:06:54.550> in

00:06:54.689 --> 00:06:54.699 
down overflows but very easy to take in

00:06:54.699 --> 00:06:58.589 
down overflows but very easy to take in
and<00:06:54.849> out<00:06:54.970> to<00:06:55.960> dump<00:06:56.310> so<00:06:57.310> makes<00:06:58.030> it<00:06:58.150> make

00:06:58.589 --> 00:06:58.599 
and out to dump so makes it make

00:06:58.599 --> 00:07:01.379 
and out to dump so makes it make
virtually<00:06:59.259> maintenance-free<00:06:59.819> anyways<00:07:00.819> I'm

00:07:01.379 --> 00:07:01.389 
virtually maintenance-free anyways I'm

00:07:01.389 --> 00:07:02.790 
virtually maintenance-free anyways I'm
going<00:07:01.659> to<00:07:01.720> clean<00:07:01.900> out<00:07:02.020> my<00:07:02.110> stuff<00:07:02.349> but<00:07:02.590> the
