00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.430
 good all attached to a new video 

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:06.410
 well it seems that it is already official 

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:08.540
 everything from the second hand of xbox one 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:11.240
 the subject of the permanent connection all 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:13.100
 this will explain what each point 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:15.110
 because the truth is that it is quite 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:17.270
 complicated the truth is that microsoft me 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:19.280
 I do not know if he wants to complicate life 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:21.110
 to the user what the fuck wants 

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:23.720
 but the truth is that they bother a little 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:24.980
 quite the truth, all this is 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.539
 official as I say you have it in the 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.160
 descriptions you have the description a 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:30.070
 link in Spanish in case someone wants 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:33.020
 read it in Spanish in a source 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:36.410
 alternative and then you have it also in 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.850
 the official page of xbox and good 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.380
 basically for you to see that it's true 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.450
 that they have turned me into a fucking shit and 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:44.809
 I really invite you to read it carefully 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:47.000
 all pick up the text in English and 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:48.559
 translate it into Spanish and read them sitting 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.020
 because the truth is that it does not have 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:53.329
 I waste some some good parts 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:55.910
 it seems that the need is confirmed 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:57.649
 that we need to connect every 24 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.930
 hours to play xbox games 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:02.329
 which are we connect once to the 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:05.030
 minimum day to play the games 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:06.500
 now how good that in the 21st century by 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.930
 it's not a big problem 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.310
 next we go to a town or something in the 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.260
 that there is no internet because it was a 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.330
 Fuck in case we go to 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.650
 house of a friend and let's start our 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.260
 session to be able to play in our 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.940
 games at home as this will be done every 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.550
 hour is not basically I guess it will be 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:25.010
 to protect that does not happen in the account 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.750
 your colleague and he will have all your games and 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:29.390
 both of you and playing this will be a kind 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.800
 of control not what will control who 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.720
 is playing each game and therefore 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.360
 of the connection every 24 hours and that's why 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.880
 the connection every hour at home of him in 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:41.210
 case of being in another console and also 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:43.550
 it seems that it should not be detailed that 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:46.220
 will not have from the start of departure 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:48.110
 rent video game rental no 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.060
 will be available during the departure of 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:53.000
 xbox what and how good they are going to try 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:56.000
 so do something alternatively we are going to 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.680
 see how they solve it in that case the 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.950
 subject of the second hand here the company 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.560
 editor can say 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.420
 and allow second-hand sale and 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.899
 well it seems that if this is so 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:10.479
 you will have to do it in establishments 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:12.370
 officers to allow this in 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.470
 microsoft we do not know what store will be 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.660
 or anything like that but let that 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.220
 neither is a quota said with which 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.080
 because the second one is more important 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.140
 still in the air and the truth is that 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:25.180
 it's still a nuisance not the one 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.500
 and publishing such decide because 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.849
 let's be what they are going to why they are going to 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.830
 decide the companies the number that 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:31.269
 they want is pasta and really because they 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.970
 he knew that something like that will happen and in 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:35.319
 If they allow it, it will be very 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.330
 controlled, we will not be able to sell it 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:38.650
 where we want microsoft to decide 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.790
 which stores in which shop you can 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.590
 sell and which not with which 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.200
 We will see again if they put a fee not 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.140
 put nothing we'll see what happens 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.220
 because that subject is still in the air 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.920
 ten members of your family come 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.630
 You can play your games from your 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.120
 library of games in any 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:57.700
 console and such and good are associated with your 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.650
 account we do not know how they will take 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.780
 the members of your family do not know if 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.860
 they will be distant close relatives or how 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.290
 they will do not know we have to 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.790
 put the ID we do not know if we have to 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.680
 put all the data and such 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.620
 in case of having thus facilities therefore 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:14.170
 would be added the truth would be a great 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.329
 surprise and I think that of the few 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:19.989
 good things that we could highlight from 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:22.329
 all this also seems to be that if 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:24.370
 we have a game we can give it away for 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:26.049
 example a friend but to give it away 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.700
 we have to good it has to be in 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:30.579
 our friends list at least 30 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.989
 days before we give it to you if 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:34.599
 it seems that you can only do this 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:36.069
 once with each game what is also not 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:38.200
 He explains that if for example it 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:40.840
 you give to a person because we do not know if 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.670
 will disappear from your list of games and 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.200
 only he will have it afterwards, yes it will be 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.090
 well because it's the most obvious thing because if not 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.709
 the sale to lower half no 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.660
 it evolves good way so it's 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:52.300
 because it will be that 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:54.100
 in that way and how it regulates 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:55.150
 licenses if we have to install the 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.710
 games in our console by 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.690
 they basically regulate it with that connection 

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:00.100
 permanent good permanent between 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:01.900
 quotes we do not have to update 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:05.290
 every time every 24 hours and well then 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.970
 so they will be controlling how good this is 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.710
 explain what happens if during those 24 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:10.570
 hours because you do not connect and it does not connect you 

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:11.680
 by basically can not play so 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:14.440
 you can watch TV and that kind of thing 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:17.560
 but you can not play any kind of 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:20.890
 games or anything like that, not if 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:26.010
 I'm leaving something else I do not know the 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:26.010
 I'm really going to go over all this a bit 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:30.569
 Let's see 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:32.190
 I do not leave I do not leave anything else but 

00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:33.930
 good just in case 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:35.970
 look at them the link you have from the 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.740
 description is to leave a few to 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:39.300
 that you go reading and so and good that 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:42.720
 all this appears because it seems like a 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:44.550
 great complication and good at the end of the 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.440
 text I think I read on the page 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:48.389
 xbox and is that everyone is subject to 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.190
 changes that can totally change it 

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:52.050
 and hopefully so I told 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:52.979
 just stop fooling because 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.470
 they are and they are putting it 

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:58.560
 easy if they are and does not do anything of this 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:00.419
 style because it's already there you have already 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.949
 given as say 50 percent 

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:03.150
 of sales because I believe that a 

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:05.340
 person who buys a console to 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:07.080
 not have to be aware of certain 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:08.940
 things not to buy a game of having it 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:11.099
 crystal of power things are not things that 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:14.400
 they pull back the console player 

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:16.740
 let's make it clearer not to say it 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:20.039
 good way so good almost everything 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:22.409
 well a little bit so resolved between 

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:24.960
 quotes we'll see well in the e3 they say something 

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:27.180
 more but for now well enough 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.250
 quite strange all the truth so 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:32.360
 well nothing more kids that all in the 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:32.360
 next videos to the next top
