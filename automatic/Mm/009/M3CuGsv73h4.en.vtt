00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:15.600
 Hello, good afternoon, today I am going to teach you 

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:19.500
 to do some centers with plants 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:21.510
 decorate your office tables or 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.050
 dinning room 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:29.240
 Here we have an assortment of seedlings that 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:33.140
 we have taken from mother plants these are 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:35.610
 what are the digits of the tapes 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:38.120
 these hanging 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.230
 we have taken off 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.880
 you see here is 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.400
 this what are the little children of the 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:48.250
 tapes that you then put them in water and 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:53.020
 chandra and you plant them again and here 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:55.300
 we have pineapple pineapples 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.680
 there they are that open and fall to 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.950
 ground 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:02.020
 we have a lot because I'm picking 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:05.590
 all for me are also worth to cast the 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:08.140
 fireplace because they do very well 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:11.170
 so what we do is 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.010
 planting catch the pineapple that is open and 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.080
 is at the same time 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:17.360
 we planted the little plants that we have 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:20.180
 cut from other plants some stems 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:23.870
 terminals that do not take us flower 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:27.680
 still and we have here about seven appointments 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:29.810
 ceramic that we have covered with a 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.850
 little bit of silicone down so it does not 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:35.060
 let the water come out because what we are going to 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:37.750
 do is going to be throwing water in the background and 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:42.450
 the pineapple with the plants that you like 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:45.860
 the water has to be here below 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.860
 then you put it like that 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.960
 each one its sad quote I look here 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.580
 she is also how beautiful with our 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.340
 templates these are like a pretty 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.780
 pendants that I have also in the 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.940
 planter 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.260
 and we have also put the pineapple to 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.780
 time is open 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.580
 the text is made water 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.729
 today you can decorate it of what you 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:08.069
 like any plant you always have to 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:10.769
 to go 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.440
 in a glass or in a container with 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:15.140
 plastic 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:19.340
 good ceramic plastic that has 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:21.020
 to go with water is to say that pineapples 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.010
 all sizes 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.980
 and accommodate them ice 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:29.030
 to your 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:32.549
 Wherever I like, I already have it 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:35.129
 from other days because this tomorrow in 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:37.500
 how much pineapple water throws what is going to 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:40.590
 do is going to be closed and what will happen 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.599
 that he has passed is what you see he has 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.849
 Closed damp the pineapple is 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:47.640
 closed and all the 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:49.530
 hooked plants 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.700
 then properties that the pineapple has 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.700
 What it does is 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:59.120
 that the little plants keep watching 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.120
 appointments here 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:02.970
 then you have it decorative in 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:06.030
 any place in any center that 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:08.810
 you want to put it that if you do not have to 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:11.120
 never miss water in the container 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:14.330
 because if it did not dry it would open the 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:17.090
 pineapple and the plant would dry this' no 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:20.420
 have land and having no nutrients 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:22.580
 the ideal would be to throw a little 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.290
 of nutrient the liquid in the water does not 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.490
 now because now it's winter and now 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:28.890
 the plants do not throw 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:31.800
 but come on if you see that they last you in 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:34.680
 spring and you see that they come out 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:36.870
 stems and pulling plant 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.110
 pour a little bit of liquid nutrient 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.980
 In the container 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:45.930
 so that the plant can live clear 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:48.030
 because only with water would not live 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:51.150
 you see then they would be good precious 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.560
 Look at this, it's true, Mariana, 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.180
 tea of ​​bread is closed and is in the 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.379
 pineapple you'll see how they stay 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.150
 hooked because aware of the 

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:59.750
 loose plants you see them good by 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:02.420
 tomorrow they are left to close in the pineapple 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:04.580
 what to do is stay all caught 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:07.110
 then even if it turns over and that's the 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:10.460
 plant does not come out 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:10.460
 well, this is a 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.420
 a little thing that I learned new and hello 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:18.000
 I wanted to share with you because 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:20.519
 come on, it's super curious and if we are 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.350
 pointed to a child you will see clearly when you see the 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:25.410
 pineapple open and then how it closes here 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:27.650
 and all the little plants are left 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:30.470
 the children are amazed 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:34.340
 good come see if you like the pineapple 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:35.990
 you see there you take them and for home to 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.690
 do experiments that we're going to 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:41.169
 be a beautiful decoration come a 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:41.169
 greeting everyone 

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:47.210
 Well look, I've had them in water 

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:49.719

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:53.080
 has already closed what more precious thing 

00:04:49.719 --> 00:04:56.289
 See how the plant was 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:59.139
 closed with a little water in the 

00:04:56.289 --> 00:05:01.960
 bottom does not need much water but 

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:04.780
 we're going to closed it was open and 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:07.169
 now let the whole plant get caught 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.169
 the same 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:12.460
 it is closing as it gets wet 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:14.320
 it is closing you can put it even 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:17.590
 in a smaller pot because now 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:19.300
 already even as now it is overturned 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:20.889
 I put it here under a 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:24.610
 little stone or something to stay 

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:26.770

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:31.599
 it's closed and look good to put mouth 

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:35.169
 down and the entire template has been 

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:37.000
 look how pretty to decorate everything 

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:39.400

00:05:56.529 --> 00:06:02.979
 icing sugar so back it's like it's 

00:05:59.199 --> 00:06:05.430
 precious snow are then this board 

00:06:02.979 --> 00:06:08.979
 to be able to put if you want in a center 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:11.080
 you take a glass or ceramic center 

00:06:08.979 --> 00:06:12.789
 of what you like and you can put them 

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:15.129
 together with a little water in the 

00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:18.099
 background and you are doing the 

00:06:15.129 --> 00:06:21.129
 composition that you want good I think 

00:06:18.099 --> 00:06:23.979
 that this is precious I tell you that 

00:06:21.129 --> 00:06:26.770
 it looks super nice, it does not carry earth 

00:06:23.979 --> 00:06:30.219
 just a little bit of water and the pineapple 

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:32.289
 let's go that then the pineapple if you leave it 

00:06:30.219 --> 00:06:35.650
 of case it returns to open again this pineapple 

00:06:32.289 --> 00:06:38.590
 the same thing that is closed then the 

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:40.750
 it would happen a bit like this 

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:43.150
 are left like this you can see the zygote down 

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:45.860
 that's where the water is like that was 

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:48.050
 view look at this era 

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:49.870
 this is how you have seen it before in the 

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:52.450
 video at the beginning 

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:54.340
 it was open and as it has been giving 

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:58.020
 the water is closing 

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:58.020
 and it has stayed that way 

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:02.880
 well this you put it in any of 

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:04.760
 this quote of ceramic or glass or of 

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:07.340
 plastic 

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:09.560
 where you want 

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:12.320
 Well, this was what I wanted 

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:14.419

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:16.270
 I put at the beginning if you see the video 

00:07:14.419 --> 00:07:20.419
 at the beginning I'm seeing how he's gone 

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:22.040
 changing the shape of the pineapple and so it 

00:07:20.419 --> 00:07:24.920
 can they keep for a lot of time 

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:27.409
 in water that we do not miss downhill 

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:31.509
 and to decorate what you want 

00:07:27.409 --> 00:07:31.509
