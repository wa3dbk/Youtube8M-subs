eyeshadow and then you also have this

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.200 
eyeshadow and then you also have this
darker<00:01:55.680> one<00:01:55.860> which<00:01:56.070> I've<00:01:56.399> used<00:01:56.460> on<00:01:56.939> the<00:01:57.060> outer

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
darker one which I've used on the outer

darker one which I've used on the outer
V<00:01:57.509> to<00:01:57.810> help<00:01:57.990> define<00:01:58.409> the<00:01:58.649> eye<00:01:58.680> look<00:01:59.070> to<00:01:59.280> create

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579

V to help define the eye look to create
some<00:01:59.880> depth<00:02:00.180> and<00:02:01.189> overall<00:02:02.189> I<00:02:02.219> thought<00:02:02.610> these

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
some depth and overall I thought these

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.720 
some depth and overall I thought these
were<00:02:02.909> quite<00:02:03.479> a<00:02:03.509> dry<00:02:04.200> and

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:04.730 
were quite a dry and

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:06.700 
were quite a dry and
they're<00:02:04.910> not<00:02:05.150> the<00:02:05.300> most<00:02:05.480> pigmented<00:02:06.320> and

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
they're not the most pigmented and

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.300 
they're not the most pigmented and
opaque<00:02:07.100> eyeshadows<00:02:07.880> and<00:02:08.570> I<00:02:09.230> have<00:02:09.740> tried<00:02:10.040> them

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
opaque eyeshadows and I have tried them

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.370 
opaque eyeshadows and I have tried them
you<00:02:10.580> have<00:02:11.090> tried<00:02:11.330> using<00:02:11.510> them<00:02:11.780> wet<00:02:12.050> and

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
you have tried using them wet and

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:13.810 
you have tried using them wet and
they're<00:02:12.590> a<00:02:12.620> little<00:02:12.770> bit<00:02:12.980> better<00:02:13.220> but<00:02:13.520> then<00:02:13.730> I

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:13.820 
they're a little bit better but then I

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.240 
they're a little bit better but then I
feel<00:02:14.060> that<00:02:14.530> there<00:02:15.530> are<00:02:15.560> a<00:02:15.620> little<00:02:15.830> bit<00:02:15.950> more

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
feel that there are a little bit more

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.490 
feel that there are a little bit more
difficult<00:02:16.760> to<00:02:16.820> blend<00:02:17.180> here<00:02:18.110> we<00:02:18.230> have<00:02:18.350> some

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
difficult to blend here we have some

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.650 
difficult to blend here we have some
swatches<00:02:18.770> the<00:02:19.520> lightest<00:02:19.910> one<00:02:20.060> shares<00:02:20.420> out

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
swatches the lightest one shares out

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.210 
swatches the lightest one shares out
quite<00:02:20.960> a<00:02:20.990> lot<00:02:21.200> when<00:02:21.320> you<00:02:21.380> put<00:02:21.590> it<00:02:21.680> on<00:02:21.770> the<00:02:21.920> skin

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
quite a lot when you put it on the skin

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.750 
quite a lot when you put it on the skin
and<00:02:23.020> the<00:02:24.020> orange<00:02:24.380> one<00:02:24.560> is<00:02:24.950> I<00:02:25.160> think<00:02:25.190> it's<00:02:25.580> quite

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
and the orange one is I think it's quite

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.490 
and the orange one is I think it's quite
nice<00:02:26.120> but<00:02:26.390> it<00:02:26.510> doesn't<00:02:26.810> have<00:02:26.900> as<00:02:26.990> much<00:02:27.140> pigment

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
nice but it doesn't have as much pigment

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.400 
nice but it doesn't have as much pigment
as<00:02:27.890> I<00:02:28.010> would<00:02:28.190> have<00:02:28.280> liked<00:02:28.520> it<00:02:28.700> to<00:02:28.760> and<00:02:29.480> the<00:02:30.230> two

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
as I would have liked it to and the two

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.170 
as I would have liked it to and the two
darkest<00:02:30.800> ones<00:02:30.980> I<00:02:31.100> think<00:02:31.160> are<00:02:31.430> the<00:02:31.550> nicest<00:02:31.760> ones

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
darkest ones I think are the nicest ones

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.360 
darkest ones I think are the nicest ones
of<00:02:32.450> these<00:02:32.630> four<00:02:33.040> especially<00:02:34.040> the<00:02:34.190> very

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
of these four especially the very

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:35.890 
of these four especially the very
darkest<00:02:34.880> one<00:02:35.090> which<00:02:35.270> I<00:02:35.390> thought<00:02:35.540> was<00:02:35.690> quite

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
darkest one which I thought was quite

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.860 
darkest one which I thought was quite
smooth<00:02:36.290> and<00:02:36.620> I<00:02:37.490> really<00:02:37.850> enjoy<00:02:38.120> that<00:02:38.150> one<00:02:38.540> and

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
smooth and I really enjoy that one and

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.680 
smooth and I really enjoy that one and
this<00:02:39.410> is<00:02:39.590> just<00:02:39.860> on<00:02:40.250> bare<00:02:40.850> skin<00:02:41.240> so<00:02:41.450> I<00:02:41.480> don't

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
this is just on bare skin so I don't

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.360 
this is just on bare skin so I don't
have<00:02:41.780> a<00:02:41.810> primer<00:02:42.140> of<00:02:42.410> base<00:02:42.590> or<00:02:42.800> anything<00:02:43.070> under

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
have a primer of base or anything under

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.640 
have a primer of base or anything under
overall<00:02:44.270> I<00:02:44.300> think<00:02:44.810> I<00:02:44.900> would<00:02:45.020> probably<00:02:45.140> give

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
overall I think I would probably give

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.040 
overall I think I would probably give
these<00:02:45.830> three<00:02:46.520> out<00:02:46.790> of<00:02:46.820> five<00:02:47.180> I<00:02:47.240> like<00:02:47.870> the

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.050 
these three out of five I like the

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.280 
these three out of five I like the
concept<00:02:48.320> I<00:02:48.770> like<00:02:48.980> the<00:02:49.190> colors<00:02:49.670> and<00:02:49.940> I<00:02:50.870> do<00:02:50.960> not

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
concept I like the colors and I do not

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:52.810 
concept I like the colors and I do not
like<00:02:51.350> that<00:02:51.770> they're<00:02:51.950> a<00:02:51.980> little<00:02:52.130> bit<00:02:52.370> more<00:02:52.400> dry

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:52.820 
like that they're a little bit more dry

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.350 
like that they're a little bit more dry
and<00:02:52.850> powdery<00:02:53.510> but<00:02:53.950> I<00:02:54.950> do<00:02:55.010> like<00:02:55.340> how<00:02:55.760> well<00:02:56.060> they

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
and powdery but I do like how well they

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.540 
and powdery but I do like how well they
go<00:02:56.540> together<00:02:56.600> they<00:02:57.350> create<00:02:57.680> a<00:02:57.770> very<00:02:58.100> sort<00:02:58.520> of

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.550 
go together they create a very sort of

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:01.360 
go together they create a very sort of
nice<00:02:59.360> neutral<00:02:59.990> everyday<00:03:00.470> look<00:03:00.770> and<00:03:01.040> all<00:03:01.220> the

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
nice neutral everyday look and all the

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.870 
nice neutral everyday look and all the
colors<00:03:01.790> suit<00:03:02.150> each<00:03:02.450> other<00:03:02.720> like<00:03:03.140> they<00:03:03.350> match

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
colors suit each other like they match

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.360 
colors suit each other like they match
in<00:03:04.880> a<00:03:04.970> very<00:03:05.150> flattering<00:03:05.450> way<00:03:06.070> if<00:03:07.070> you<00:03:07.220> have<00:03:07.340> a

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
in a very flattering way if you have a

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.430 
in a very flattering way if you have a
little<00:03:07.730> bit<00:03:07.850> more<00:03:08.030> a<00:03:08.090> darker<00:03:08.660> skin<00:03:08.840> tone<00:03:09.230> I

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
little bit more a darker skin tone I

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:10.960 
little bit more a darker skin tone I
don't<00:03:09.470> know<00:03:09.770> this<00:03:10.280> is<00:03:10.400> just<00:03:10.520> going<00:03:10.700> to<00:03:10.790> show

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
don't know this is just going to show

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.210 
don't know this is just going to show
off<00:03:11.120> the<00:03:11.270> shimmer<00:03:11.570> on<00:03:11.780> you<00:03:12.110> so<00:03:12.860> I<00:03:12.890> don't<00:03:13.100> think

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
off the shimmer on you so I don't think

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.100 
off the shimmer on you so I don't think
that<00:03:13.400> would<00:03:13.640> be<00:03:13.670> worth<00:03:14.000> it<00:03:14.240> I<00:03:14.450> mean<00:03:14.570> as<00:03:14.900> I<00:03:15.080> said

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.110 
that would be worth it I mean as I said

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:16.960 
that would be worth it I mean as I said
they're<00:03:15.350> not<00:03:15.470> overly<00:03:15.890> pigmented<00:03:16.490> for<00:03:16.760> fair

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
they're not overly pigmented for fair

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:18.880 
they're not overly pigmented for fair
people<00:03:17.209> like<00:03:17.510> me<00:03:17.720> and<00:03:17.900> perhaps<00:03:18.080> also<00:03:18.440> medium

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
people like me and perhaps also medium

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:20.740 
people like me and perhaps also medium
skin<00:03:19.250> I<00:03:19.520> think<00:03:19.850> these<00:03:20.150> would<00:03:20.330> look<00:03:20.390> very

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
skin I think these would look very

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.229 
skin I think these would look very
flattering<00:03:21.280> but<00:03:22.280> if<00:03:22.400> you're<00:03:22.520> any<00:03:22.700> darker<00:03:23.090> -

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
flattering but if you're any darker -

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:25.570 
flattering but if you're any darker -
like<00:03:23.390> a<00:03:23.420> medium<00:03:23.810> dark<00:03:24.020> or<00:03:24.290> dark<00:03:24.320> and<00:03:25.160> a<00:03:25.280> skin

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580 
like a medium dark or dark and a skin

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.510 
like a medium dark or dark and a skin
tone<00:03:25.790> and<00:03:26.470> these<00:03:27.470> are<00:03:27.650> just<00:03:27.800> not<00:03:28.190> going<00:03:28.370> to<00:03:28.430> be

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:28.520 
tone and these are just not going to be

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:33.220 
tone and these are just not going to be

through<00:06:01.720> the<00:06:01.810> lower<00:06:02.440> lash<00:06:02.770> line<00:06:03.010> as<00:06:03.190> well

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:09.150 

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:11.060 

we're<00:06:09.780> doing<00:06:10.080> this<00:06:10.200> to<00:06:10.380> sort<00:06:10.560> of<00:06:10.620> even<00:06:10.919> out

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:11.070 
we're doing this to sort of even out

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:13.400 
we're doing this to sort of even out
sort<00:06:11.550> of<00:06:11.669> so<00:06:11.910> top-heavy<00:06:12.300> even<00:06:13.290> though<00:06:13.380> I

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:13.410 
sort of so top-heavy even though I

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:15.920 
sort of so top-heavy even though I
really<00:06:13.650> quite<00:06:13.919> enjoy<00:06:14.310> that<00:06:14.610> my<00:06:15.270> classic

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:15.930 
really quite enjoy that my classic

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:18.650 
really quite enjoy that my classic
Marilyn<00:06:16.320> Monroe<00:06:16.770> top-heavy<00:06:17.430> look<00:06:17.850> I<00:06:18.120> really

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:18.660 
Marilyn Monroe top-heavy look I really

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:21.950 
Marilyn Monroe top-heavy look I really
think<00:06:18.900> that<00:06:18.960> a<00:06:19.919> little<00:06:20.700> bit<00:06:20.820> softer<00:06:21.300> smokey<00:06:21.930> I

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:21.960 
think that a little bit softer smokey I

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:24.530 
think that a little bit softer smokey I
think<00:06:22.410> it's<00:06:22.530> a<00:06:22.830> lot<00:06:23.400> nicer<00:06:23.430> looking<00:06:24.300> if<00:06:24.419> we

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:24.540 
think it's a lot nicer looking if we

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:26.300 
think it's a lot nicer looking if we
have<00:06:24.720> some<00:06:24.990> shadow<00:06:25.290> on<00:06:25.410> both<00:06:25.680> the<00:06:25.889> top<00:06:26.040> and<00:06:26.100> the

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:26.310 
have some shadow on both the top and the

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:28.700 
have some shadow on both the top and the
bottom<00:06:26.490> the<00:06:26.850> last<00:06:27.720> thing<00:06:28.110> we're<00:06:28.260> gonna<00:06:28.380> do<00:06:28.680> is
