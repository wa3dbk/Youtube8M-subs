00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:21.029
 Eye makeup that looks good on sunburn skin is a signal from gradation 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:24.240
 This time this 3 colors 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:29.580
 Brown and a little reddish 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:34.680
 Order curse Kobe and bright beige gold then 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:39.950
 Use the blue as Brown mistress shopkeeper and accent color 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:45.500
 I would like to use this to create Aizu from gradation 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:46.340
 First of all, this dark brown eye shadow is painted on the entire eyelash tree of the upper eyelids 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:52.430
 I will 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:55.390
 In a good feeling with the inner corner of the eye direction it if Once you take me cheon taking the chip from the corner of the eye side 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.390
 I will strike 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:04.720
 If the color is dropped enough to the eyelashes, it will be on the upper side 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.720
 Let's paint with a feeling of prosperity 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:16.780
 The width to be painted is about a little before the hollow of the eyehole 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:21.270
 In this way, the eyelash tree extends naturally from the eyehole direction 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.270
 It will be an effective source of gradation 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:32.650
 Next I will pull the brown eyeliner pencil 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:38.520
 This is okay from either side of the eyes 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:38.520
 Let's play so as not to go away from the root of eyelashes as much as possible 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:49.490
 And after playing it in its entirety, let it rub with a cotton swab 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:55.360
 To the corner of the eye direction we aim from the wo when the move 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:55.360
 If you move it while lightly swaying to the left and right, it will make you feel natural 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:03.740
 Brown eye shadow again after blurring the eye line 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:07.690
 More and to do so will not prevent only the value obtained by blurring the line 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.690
 It will be a deep eye of gradation 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:23.790
 Next, I will put this highlight color on the eyelid for the brush 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:29.840
 Put as little overlap on top of the First no pledge from the top from taking here on both sides 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:29.840
 Go and then go down to where you painted the eye shadow 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:44.320
 Next is the lower eyelid makeup and take a little bit of brown just like that and then 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:44.320
 Let's put it in the feeling that the end of the eyes is about 1/3 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:54.800
 Next the eyes head down this bright highlight roadway 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:57.489
 Head have taken to the chip until about people of 3 parts in the direction of fiddling from the teeth 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.489
 I will 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:08.940
 And with the finger at the tip of the eye, it feels like it 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.940
 I will lose 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:22.300
 Next, I will put pencils on the good side of the lower eyelid since accent color 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:27.210
 Let's make the scene at that time a little round and then pull 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:33.830
 Put it lightly at the base of the hair and pull it from side to side 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:33.830
 Blue color will show the entire says the very sunburn skin 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:45.860
 I heard the gradation in this way and with the color shadow 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:45.860
 It will be an eye makeup that matches the very open skin by putting an accent color 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.430
 Good Iiii
