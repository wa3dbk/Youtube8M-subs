00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.900
 start the step by step you go 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.470
 need for this bonding an enamel of the 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.330

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:29.420
 red half color 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:32.610
 Look, this color here is like the ex with the 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:37.350
 72 in 2011 these nodes for sure are 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:39.210
 expired but I do not mind great but 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.920
 you can choose any color from 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:45.630
 enamel you want 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:47.939
 're always extra shine of the Colorama 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.250
 I 'm using people here to be more 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.110
 easy toothpicks even with 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.020
 cotton I already left ready 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.670
 and for whoever I want I will not use more 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.520
 For those who want, you can use our 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.619
 Celso has to outline I've shown the 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.329
 video that we got hot there was 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.310
 used to make the drawings and can 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:08.250
 example go but I will not use to do 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.899
 direct with the brush in two malt I 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.100
 I think maybe it's even more space 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:15.310
 for everybody 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:18.790
 i it 's more practical of course i'll use that 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:23.290
 hit the post and then clean here 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:25.210
 I do not think to think it alone here. 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:29.620
 enamel with a little of us without 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:34.150
 keep the excess and then I'll make a 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:41.830
 I went back here on my fingernail to hire 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:43.060
 Enamel brush ready made a 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.380
 round trip 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.390
 do not worry about being totally 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:49.720
 perfect also did not stay because after 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.590
 We can get it right now in this 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.460
 nail 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:56.470
 the system is very simple it does the same 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:57.850
 thing takes a little bit of nail polish 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.970
 too much 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:04.300
 We're going to do a little pacaembu. 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:08.200
 This is a very simple boss, so try. 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:10.950
 pick up above the nozzle corner and 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.950
 pulls 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:21.480
 so pull here on the other side the same 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:21.480
 thing 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:39.980
 I also did a little hitch for sister 

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:42.769
 Scoreboard was thus ok 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:44.719
 well if we're going to let a 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:50.090
 a little and we're just going 

00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:52.040
 paint the other areas without trying not to 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:55.719
 to erase from the side who is denounced 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.719
 people to get easier 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:11.750
 Now I'm going to train this 

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:15.530
 right position to show you not 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:17.690
 It bothers me more, it almost worked out 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:20.690
 now I'm going to pass a second layer that 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:23.799
 I like the glaze well but I felt the color 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:23.799
 so strong 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:39.680
 now guide the corners of our 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:44.030
 our drawing is drying up and that 's it 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:46.030
 just to not have tried to forgive 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:49.220
 Now, we 'll do the following. 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:50.930
 comes with the brush without giving a signal is 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:52.669
 conquer subscribers blame with 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:55.759
 little reed 

00:04:52.669 --> 00:05:03.740
 with a little bit of cotton on the tip 

00:04:55.759 --> 00:05:06.050
 waters rise up is we will doing 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:09.110
 both mean to make this 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:11.380
 fitch little one ball to become more 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:13.960
 or less than the size you should be 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:18.349
 so we just go 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:24.249
 correcting the ball to let her 

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:28.809
 small but small 

00:05:24.249 --> 00:05:29.799
 will the little mouth get in the way 

00:05:28.809 --> 00:05:34.149
 we want 

00:05:29.799 --> 00:05:37.869
 it has to be a very subtle move and 

00:05:34.149 --> 00:05:42.429
 Quiet patient patient for what you are 

00:05:37.869 --> 00:05:48.399
 a good river does not have a double job and 

00:05:42.429 --> 00:05:52.649
 get well both 

00:05:48.399 --> 00:05:55.899
 Now we'll test it comes from right. 

00:05:52.649 --> 00:05:59.489
 now need it is very ready 

00:05:55.899 --> 00:06:04.499
 Dinho has to do the twirl of the mouth. 

00:05:59.489 --> 00:06:07.929
 So simple, what are we going to do? 

00:06:04.499 --> 00:06:10.149
 Give me that little one I'll leave 

00:06:07.929 --> 00:06:12.059
 here the opening of the mouth a little 

00:06:10.149 --> 00:06:18.249
 bigger 

00:06:12.059 --> 00:06:20.079
 so I 'm correcting it now because 

00:06:18.249 --> 00:06:23.229
 I made it higher I'll take some 

00:06:20.079 --> 00:06:32.979
 the cac button when you beat the 

00:06:23.229 --> 00:06:38.769
 another goal clash takes this strip 

00:06:32.979 --> 00:06:41.969
 tip leave but round zinc 

00:06:38.769 --> 00:06:41.969
 the mouth appears 

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:58.000
 Also, there was also a 

00:06:53.979 --> 00:07:02.669
 came back very simple now 

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:13.479
 we get here our extra bright 

00:07:02.669 --> 00:07:15.610
 passes a certain layer that I like 

00:07:13.479 --> 00:07:18.430
 do not start malt yet 

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:21.639
 down I think of the two extra layers 

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:27.160
 brightness so she really stayed in 

00:07:21.639 --> 00:07:29.889
 fight in this inertia here that the first 

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:31.900
 the layer of knowing that is getting more 

00:07:29.889 --> 00:07:34.630
 I do not know if it's the 

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:37.870
 color your all but do not stay so 

00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:40.180
 perfect for giving two layers if 

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:43.180
 Solve the problem 

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:47.680
 right now this ceiling already has enough 

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:49.180
 does not need brightness and it's these people 

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:52.030
 line is ready 

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:54.240
 our team had already done 

00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:57.789
 and look at the final result of the evaluation 

00:07:54.240 --> 00:08:00.580
 it's a mouthful people are not cute 

00:07:57.789 --> 00:08:04.020
 I thought it was very cute, I hope you 

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:09.210
 Did you like it and a kiss for you? 

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:09.210
