 seems to have orchestrated a large part 

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:57.929
 Of the crimes I believe so, why? 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.149
 the two sectors are investigating the 

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:01.469
 civilian police through when the case 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.299
 robbery assault followed by death which 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:05.969
 is investigating is the deic who investigates 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.590
 now when revenge exists is the 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.810
 homicide department and 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.940
 examines all cases in the 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.750
 then this case must know the right to 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.060
 a year later 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.580

 long-time police officers and military 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.650

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.540
 no longer walk even care 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.480
 tactically uniformed police officer did not pay

 driving was free neither did they 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.940
 want more 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.650
 now reverse this story a little 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.780
 it is not because the criminal has lost the 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.340
 respect for the police and justice I 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.540
 I'm going back to live with the Fabian reporter. 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.430
 passion that is accompanying this case 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.720
 from the early morning or the panachão 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.720

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.700
 Look, you have two men by now in the morning. 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.590

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:53.070

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:00.810
 A motorcycle and a weapon were seized. 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:03.150
 the police are also checking 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.290

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.989
