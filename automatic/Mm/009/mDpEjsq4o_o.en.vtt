00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
literally not locked in I mean I can

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.670 
literally not locked in I mean I can
push<00:02:34.440> it<00:02:34.590> as<00:02:34.740> far<00:02:34.770> as<00:02:35.280> it<00:02:35.400> can<00:02:35.490> go<00:02:35.960> and<00:02:36.960> it<00:02:37.350> still

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
push it as far as it can go and it still

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.130 
push it as far as it can go and it still
does<00:02:38.070> not<00:02:38.100> snap<00:02:38.910> which<00:02:39.540> is<00:02:39.660> a<00:02:39.690> surprise

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
does not snap which is a surprise

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.780 
does not snap which is a surprise
because<00:02:40.440> it's<00:02:40.710> got<00:02:40.800> notches<00:02:41.340> which<00:02:41.520> would

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
because it's got notches which would

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.080 
because it's got notches which would
seem<00:02:42.360> that<00:02:42.390> it<00:02:43.140> would<00:02:43.320> be<00:02:43.530> snappa<00:02:43.980> ball<00:02:44.280> but<00:02:45.000> it

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
seem that it would be snappa ball but it

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.390 
seem that it would be snappa ball but it
doesn't<00:02:45.390> snap<00:02:45.600> so<00:02:46.140> inevitably<00:02:46.590> when<00:02:47.070> I<00:02:47.130> put<00:02:47.340> it

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
doesn't snap so inevitably when I put it

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.050 
doesn't snap so inevitably when I put it
in<00:02:47.460> my<00:02:47.580> pocket<00:02:48.080> this<00:02:49.080> can<00:02:49.680> fall<00:02:49.890> off<00:02:50.000> okay<00:02:51.000> so

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
in my pocket this can fall off okay so

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.270 
in my pocket this can fall off okay so
let<00:02:51.390> me<00:02:51.420> remove<00:02:51.990> the<00:02:52.170> USB<00:02:52.290> cable<00:02:52.560> and<00:02:52.980> just<00:02:53.160> for

let me remove the USB cable and just for

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.880 
let me remove the USB cable and just for

there's got to be something better and I
know<00:05:30.370> I'm<00:05:30.520> going<00:05:30.670> to<00:05:30.790> be<00:05:30.880> looking<00:05:31.000> at<00:05:31.240> a<00:05:31.270> couple

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:31.420 
know I'm going to be looking at a couple

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:33.810 
know I'm going to be looking at a couple
of<00:05:31.630> other<00:05:31.780> similar<00:05:32.530> external<00:05:33.340> battery<00:05:33.610> packs

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:33.820 
of other similar external battery packs

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:35.640 
of other similar external battery packs
for<00:05:34.030> the<00:05:34.090> iphone<00:05:34.360> 3g<00:05:34.780> and<00:05:34.960> hopefully<00:05:35.530> the

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:35.650 
for the iphone 3g and hopefully the

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:36.990 
for the iphone 3g and hopefully the
other<00:05:35.770> ones<00:05:35.980> will<00:05:36.160> be<00:05:36.250> better<00:05:36.580> in<00:05:36.760> the<00:05:36.790> sense

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:37.000 
other ones will be better in the sense

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.300 
other ones will be better in the sense
that<00:05:37.090> they'll<00:05:37.540> go<00:05:37.690> in<00:05:37.870> they'll<00:05:38.530> stay<00:05:38.800> in<00:05:38.860> they

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:39.310 
that they'll go in they'll stay in they

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:40.790 
that they'll go in they'll stay in they
snap<00:05:39.550> in<00:05:39.790> and<00:05:39.940> that's<00:05:40.150> where<00:05:40.420> they<00:05:40.540> stay

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:40.800 
snap in and that's where they stay

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.890 
snap in and that's where they stay
unfortunately<00:05:41.800> I<00:05:41.980> cannot<00:05:42.820> I<00:05:43.300> despite<00:05:43.780> the

unfortunately I cannot I despite the

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:45.990 
unfortunately I cannot I despite the
fact<00:05:44.110> that<00:05:44.350> this<00:05:44.680> does<00:05:44.920> work<00:05:44.950> as<00:05:45.460> advertising

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:46.000 
fact that this does work as advertising

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.540

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:52.840 
it's going then the light should go blue

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.410 
it's going then the light should go blue
here<00:05:53.110> any<00:05:53.380> second<00:05:53.740> now<00:05:53.770> yeah<00:05:54.190> there<00:05:54.430> goes<00:05:54.610> you

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:56.650 
may not be able to tell the lightwind

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:58.920 
may not be able to tell the lightwind
blue<00:05:56.860> so<00:05:57.340> it<00:05:57.370> is<00:05:57.730> charging<00:05:58.480> so<00:05:58.510> I<00:05:58.690> know<00:05:58.810> that

00:05:58.920 --> 00:05:58.930 
blue so it is charging so I know that

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:01.530 
blue so it is charging so I know that
part<00:05:59.410> works<00:05:59.590> the<00:05:59.800> problem<00:06:00.160> is<00:06:00.280> is<00:06:00.520> that<00:06:01.180> it

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:01.540 
part works the problem is is that it

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:03.210 
part works the problem is is that it
