00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
overflow hole basically I was trying to

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.290 
overflow hole basically I was trying to
look<00:00:37.530> for<00:00:37.590> a<00:00:38.100> way<00:00:38.309> to<00:00:38.340> do<00:00:38.579> this<00:00:38.760> on<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.030> cheap

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
look for a way to do this on the cheap

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.850 
look for a way to do this on the cheap
just<00:00:39.629> to<00:00:39.719> try<00:00:39.899> it<00:00:39.930> out<00:00:40.110> that<00:00:40.260> I've<00:00:40.379> never<00:00:40.500> had<00:00:40.800> a

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
just to try it out that I've never had a

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.369 
just to try it out that I've never had a
North<00:00:41.250> bucket<00:00:41.670> and<00:00:42.059> I<00:00:42.540> figured<00:00:42.870> I'm<00:00:43.020> starting

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
North bucket and I figured I'm starting

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.139 
North bucket and I figured I'm starting
some<00:00:43.530> plans<00:00:43.800> so<00:00:44.100> why<00:00:44.430> not<00:00:44.610> try<00:00:44.879> with<00:00:45.059> the

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
some plans so why not try with the

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.270 
some plans so why not try with the
tomato<00:00:45.420> tomato<00:00:46.289> probably<00:00:46.620> outgrow<00:00:46.950> it<00:00:47.010> but

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
tomato tomato probably outgrow it but

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.569 
tomato tomato probably outgrow it but
you<00:00:48.120> know<00:00:48.379> if<00:00:49.379> it<00:00:49.559> works<00:00:49.800> that's<00:00:50.250> all<00:00:50.489> I'm

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
you know if it works that's all I'm

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.430 
you know if it works that's all I'm
interested<00:00:50.640> in<00:00:51.090> right<00:00:51.239> now<00:00:51.390> as<00:00:51.930> you<00:00:52.050> can<00:00:52.199> tell

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
I filled it to the fill hole and up to

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:57.709 
I filled it to the fill hole and up to
the<00:00:56.520> bottom<00:00:56.820> of<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:56.969> fill<00:00:57.149> hole<00:00:57.360> because

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
the bottom of the fill hole because

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.049 
the bottom of the fill hole because
that's<00:00:57.960> what<00:00:58.289> tells<00:00:58.559> you<00:00:58.789> when<00:00:59.789> you've

your<00:01:53.070> hole<00:01:53.369> that<00:01:53.640> you<00:01:53.729> drill<00:01:53.970> is<00:01:54.180> right<00:01:54.450> at

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
your hole that you drill is right at

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.889 
your hole that you drill is right at
that<00:01:54.780> edge<00:01:55.020> along<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.850> top<00:01:56.850> before<00:01:57.479> you<00:01:57.540> take

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
that edge along the top before you take

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.469 
that edge along the top before you take
the<00:01:58.020> bottle<00:01:58.320> apart<00:01:58.590> you're<00:01:59.250> going<00:01:59.399> to<00:01:59.579> draw<00:02:00.450> a

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
the bottle apart you're going to draw a

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.510 
the bottle apart you're going to draw a
series<00:02:00.930> of<00:02:00.960> holes<00:02:01.229> in<00:02:01.500> it<00:02:01.530> down<00:02:02.219> to<00:02:02.280> about

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
series of holes in it down to about

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.980 
series of holes in it down to about
right<00:02:02.579> there

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
right there

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.450 
right there
you<00:02:04.380> can<00:02:04.500> come<00:02:04.649> down<00:02:04.799> maybe<00:02:05.040> a<00:02:05.159> little<00:02:05.280> bit

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
you can come down maybe a little bit

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.039 
you can come down maybe a little bit
further<00:02:05.610> to<00:02:05.759> try<00:02:06.030> to<00:02:06.060> keep<00:02:06.360> it<00:02:06.509> right<00:02:06.780> about

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
further to try to keep it right about

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.169 
further to try to keep it right about
there<00:02:07.110> about<00:02:07.649> maybe<00:02:08.580> 1/2<00:02:09.149> inch

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179 
there about maybe 1/2 inch

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:12.750 
there about maybe 1/2 inch
a<00:02:10.209> little<00:02:10.509> more<00:02:10.689> above<00:02:11.439> the<00:02:11.590> sticker<00:02:11.859> line<00:02:12.099> and

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
a little more above the sticker line and

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.039 
a little more above the sticker line and
you're<00:02:13.000> just<00:02:13.150> going<00:02:13.329> to<00:02:13.359> draw<00:02:13.569> a<00:02:13.599> series<00:02:13.870> of

00:02:14.039 --> 00:02:14.049 
you're just going to draw a series of

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:16.110 
you're just going to draw a series of
holes<00:02:14.349> eight<00:02:14.680> inch<00:02:14.920> holes<00:02:15.310> all<00:02:15.909> the<00:02:15.969> way

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
holes eight inch holes all the way

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.140 
holes eight inch holes all the way
around<00:02:16.180> including<00:02:16.780> up<00:02:17.019> around<00:02:17.290> the<00:02:17.500> neck<00:02:17.709> and

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
around including up around the neck and

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.420 
around including up around the neck and
then<00:02:19.150> on<00:02:19.450> the<00:02:19.599> top<00:02:19.780> of<00:02:19.959> the<00:02:20.109> lid<00:02:20.920> here<00:02:21.250> you're

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
then on the top of the lid here you're

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:22.890 
then on the top of the lid here you're
going<00:02:21.640> to<00:02:21.760> drill<00:02:22.060> about<00:02:22.239> five<00:02:22.420> or<00:02:22.569> six<00:02:22.689> more

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
going to drill about five or six more

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.170 
going to drill about five or six more
holes<00:02:23.140> so<00:02:24.010> on<00:02:24.159> the<00:02:24.280> top<00:02:24.459> and<00:02:24.640> you<00:02:24.730> look<00:02:24.879> at<00:02:25.030> it's

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
holes so on the top and you look at it's

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.000 
holes so on the top and you look at it's
going<00:02:25.329> to<00:02:25.390> five<00:02:25.569> or<00:02:25.689> six<00:02:25.870> more<00:02:26.049> holes<00:02:26.319> okay<00:02:26.950> so

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
going to five or six more holes okay so

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.270 
going to five or six more holes okay so
when<00:02:27.280> you<00:02:27.370> get<00:02:27.489> done<00:02:27.700> doing<00:02:28.359> that<00:02:28.510> knuckles<00:02:28.930> up

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
when you get done doing that knuckles up

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.149 
when you get done doing that knuckles up
basically<00:02:30.280> a<00:02:30.700> hole<00:02:31.299> here<00:02:31.599> and<00:02:31.829> a<00:02:32.829> series<00:02:33.099> of

00:02:33.149 --> 00:02:33.159 
basically a hole here and a series of

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:35.819 
basically a hole here and a series of
holes<00:02:33.340> at<00:02:33.670> the<00:02:33.790> top<00:02:34.000> here<00:02:34.299> and<00:02:35.079> one<00:02:35.500> very<00:02:35.680> big

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:35.829 
holes at the top here and one very big

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:38.069 
holes at the top here and one very big
hole<00:02:36.040> and<00:02:36.280> that's<00:02:37.239> going<00:02:37.389> to<00:02:37.480> be<00:02:37.599> for<00:02:37.900> your

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:38.079 
hole and that's going to be for your

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:41.910 
hole and that's going to be for your
feeder<00:02:38.980> tip<00:02:39.280> over<00:02:39.730> here<00:02:39.909> and<00:02:40.739> you're<00:02:41.739> going<00:02:41.859> to

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
feeder tip over here and you're going to

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.349 
feeder tip over here and you're going to
have<00:02:42.010> a<00:02:42.250> series<00:02:42.579> of<00:02:42.669> holes<00:02:42.879> up<00:02:43.090> here<00:02:43.269> it

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:43.359 
have a series of holes up here it

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:44.970 
have a series of holes up here it
doesn't<00:02:43.569> have<00:02:43.780> to<00:02:43.870> be<00:02:43.959> perfect<00:02:44.379> just<00:02:44.470> have<00:02:44.709> to

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
doesn't have to be perfect just have to

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.860 
doesn't have to be perfect just have to
go<00:02:45.099> in<00:02:45.280> so<00:02:46.030> when<00:02:46.930> you<00:02:47.139> cut<00:02:47.650> this<00:02:48.040> at<00:02:48.459> the<00:02:49.030> label

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
go in so when you cut this at the label

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.190 
go in so when you cut this at the label
line<00:02:50.579> that's<00:02:51.579> how<00:02:52.209> big<00:02:52.419> this<00:02:52.599> is<00:02:52.780> going<00:02:52.989> to<00:02:53.079> be

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
line that's how big this is going to be

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.409 
line that's how big this is going to be
but<00:02:53.500> you'll<00:02:53.650> notice<00:02:53.859> it<00:02:54.760> doesn't<00:02:54.790> fit<00:02:55.239> all<00:02:55.329> the

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:55.419 
but you'll notice it doesn't fit all the

00:02:55.419 --> 00:02:57.509 
but you'll notice it doesn't fit all the
way<00:02:55.450> in<00:02:55.750> and<00:02:55.989> to<00:02:56.439> push<00:02:56.590> it<00:02:56.769> down<00:02:56.950> in<00:02:57.189> is<00:02:57.400> going

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:57.519 
way in and to push it down in is going

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:00.089 
way in and to push it down in is going
to<00:02:57.579> be<00:02:57.639> very<00:02:57.760> difficult<00:02:58.299> at<00:02:58.780> best<00:02:58.840> and<00:02:59.709> make

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:00.099 
to be very difficult at best and make

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:01.319 
to be very difficult at best and make
kink<00:03:00.430> or<00:03:00.639> bond

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:01.329 
kink or bond

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:03.750 
kink or bond
bend<00:03:01.719> in<00:03:01.959> make<00:03:02.560> a<00:03:02.590> hole<00:03:02.889> with<00:03:03.129> the<00:03:03.250> girls<00:03:03.459> okay

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
bend in make a hole with the girls okay

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.809 
bend in make a hole with the girls okay
so<00:03:04.510> what<00:03:04.659> I<00:03:04.689> decided<00:03:05.169> to<00:03:05.230> do<00:03:05.439> was<00:03:05.650> go<00:03:05.889> to<00:03:05.950> go

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:06.819 
so what I decided to do was go to go

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:09.449 
so what I decided to do was go to go
ahead<00:03:07.060> and<00:03:07.299> make<00:03:07.480> a<00:03:07.689> little<00:03:08.109> line<00:03:08.409> right<00:03:08.709> word

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
ahead and make a little line right word

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:11.490 
ahead and make a little line right word
meet<00:03:09.700> and<00:03:10.540> I<00:03:10.629> traced<00:03:10.900> up<00:03:11.049> with<00:03:11.169> a<00:03:11.200> sharpie

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
meet and I traced up with a sharpie

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.110 
meet and I traced up with a sharpie
marker<00:03:11.530> all<00:03:11.889> the<00:03:12.010> way<00:03:12.099> around<00:03:12.370> I<00:03:12.639> don't<00:03:13.030> have

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
marker all the way around I don't have

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.280 
marker all the way around I don't have
it<00:03:13.239> in<00:03:13.299> there<00:03:13.480> perfect<00:03:13.780> right<00:03:13.900> now<00:03:14.049> but<00:03:14.199> that's

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
it in there perfect right now but that's

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:15.960 
it in there perfect right now but that's
fine<00:03:14.500> and<00:03:14.769> you'll<00:03:15.280> have<00:03:15.430> about<00:03:15.519> that<00:03:15.790> much

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
fine and you'll have about that much

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.509 
fine and you'll have about that much
difference<00:03:16.449> Trace<00:03:17.319> that<00:03:17.349> out<00:03:17.799> I<00:03:17.829> use<00:03:18.220> a<00:03:18.250> piece

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:18.519 
difference Trace that out I use a piece

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:21.330 
difference Trace that out I use a piece
of<00:03:18.549> tape<00:03:18.729> on<00:03:19.599> all<00:03:19.720> four<00:03:19.989> sides<00:03:20.019> and<00:03:20.680> did<00:03:21.220> the

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
of tape on all four sides and did the

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:22.800 
of tape on all four sides and did the
sharpie<00:03:21.729> where<00:03:21.879> the<00:03:22.000> tape<00:03:22.180> wasn't<00:03:22.449> then<00:03:22.750> I

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
sharpie where the tape wasn't then I

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.360 
sharpie where the tape wasn't then I
pulled<00:03:23.019> the<00:03:23.139> tape<00:03:23.290> off<00:03:23.500> longer<00:03:23.829> time<00:03:24.069> did<00:03:24.280> the

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
pulled the tape off longer time did the

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
line so what I did I cut a series little

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.770 
line so what I did I cut a series little
slices<00:03:41.139> here<00:03:42.030> kind<00:03:43.030> of<00:03:43.090> like<00:03:43.180> something<00:03:43.479> to<00:03:43.629> do

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
slices here kind of like something to do

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.479 
slices here kind of like something to do
like<00:03:44.109> if<00:03:44.259> you<00:03:44.379> see<00:03:44.530> furnished<00:03:44.889> duct<00:03:45.099> work<00:03:45.280> or

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:45.489 
like if you see furnished duct work or

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:46.379 
like if you see furnished duct work or
anything<00:03:45.639> like<00:03:45.879> that

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:46.389 
anything like that

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:50.159 
anything like that
so<00:03:46.750> what<00:03:46.870> that'll<00:03:47.199> let<00:03:47.349> I<00:03:47.379> do<00:03:47.530> is<00:03:48.750> push<00:03:49.750> on<00:03:49.959> down

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:50.169 
so what that'll let I do is push on down

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:53.580 
so what that'll let I do is push on down
it<00:03:50.590> just<00:03:50.829> squishes<00:03:51.069> them<00:03:51.370> on<00:03:51.459> down<00:03:51.669> and<00:03:52.590> bring

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
it just squishes them on down and bring

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.140 
it just squishes them on down and bring
it<00:03:53.769> on<00:03:53.859> down<00:03:53.979> sometimes<00:03:54.579> it<00:03:54.729> doesn't<00:03:54.909> line<00:03:55.120> up

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
it on down sometimes it doesn't line up

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:59.339 
it on down sometimes it doesn't line up
the<00:03:55.389> best<00:03:55.620> pull<00:03:56.620> it<00:03:56.739> out<00:03:56.859> redo<00:03:57.250> it<00:03:57.370> again<00:03:58.349> till

00:03:59.339 --> 00:03:59.349 
the best pull it out redo it again till

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:01.110 
the best pull it out redo it again till
you<00:03:59.409> have<00:03:59.620> it<00:03:59.739> together<00:03:59.879> that's<00:04:00.879> what<00:04:01.030> it's
