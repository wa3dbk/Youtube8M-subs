00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:06.460
 Many people wonder how they will do 

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:08.559
 remove caffeine from coffee and it's a 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:11.889
 process so simple that it could even 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:15.009
 be done at home one way would be to catch 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:17.770
 the coffee beans moisten the and then 

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:19.800
 soak them in a solvent of 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:22.470
 paints 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.660
 this as chemistry experiment is 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.119
 very good but I guess the industry 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.730
 will not use this method 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.880
 with the coffee that we drink 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.730
 or if 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.730
 Welcome 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.670
 to the reef 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:42.309
 Methylene chloride also known 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.800
 as chlorine methane is usually found in 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:47.710
 pesticide sprays and even in the 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:50.530
 old spools of photos but where 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:53.440
 easier to find it is in 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.420
 any paint solvent since 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.880
 It is the most used in the industry 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.850
 chemistry 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:03.410
 this is the solvent used to extract 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:06.170
 of coffee caffeine 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:08.960
 the green coffee beans before toasting 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.960
 It is a well deserved for later 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:14.180
 let it soak in chlorine metal 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.400
 this is makes a temperature such that 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.369
 this solvent enters through the 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:22.100
 coffee pores completely soaking the 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:25.640
 grain inside leaving caffeine in 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:29.259
 the chloromethane then the coffee is taken out 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:32.479
 Drain evaporates the chloride and washes 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:34.630
 ready to put it in our sachet 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:37.180
 of decaffeinated 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:40.119
 no one in their right mind doubts the 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:42.549
 toxicity of methylene chloride so 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:45.880
 to explain here its effects on the 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:48.640
 health would be a obvious failure 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:53.610
 Hepatic respiratory problems failures 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:56.720
 organic malformations including cancer 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:59.340
 all the agencies of toxic substances 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:03.120
 the environmental and food 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:06.510
 recognizes and also warns 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:08.720
 then because this method is allowed 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:12.140
 in the cafe 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:15.350
 traces that is what according to the agencies 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:18.530
 of food safety remains of chlorine 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:20.810
 methane in coffee 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:24.860
 is the explanation they always give before 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:26.380
 the dangerous additives their quantity is 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.810
 very low 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:32.440
 but those traces as they call them 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.880
 how many parts per million contain the 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.180
 contact with methane chlorine 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.980
 concentrations of 800 parts per million 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:41.860
 can cause confusion weakness 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.270
 muscle tingling or feeling of 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.550
 drunkenness 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:48.880
 but higher concentrations of 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:51.700
 8,000 and 20,000 parts per million 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:54.400
 it can even cause death 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.280
 but between a simple dizziness and death 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.530
 there is a whole range of diseases 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:02.769
 Ailments or toxicity is what will depend 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:04.970
 of the parts per million that we 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:07.010
 let's see exposed 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.260
 who wants to check these effects 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.510
 just use a solvent of 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:14.770
 paintings in a room without ventilation 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:18.400
 You will see that the effects are immediate 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:22.560
 dizziness and disorientation 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:25.599
 that in a few minutes just by inhaling it 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.459
 It would be as easy as knowing from 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:30.760
 how many cups of decaffeinated coffee 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:32.829
 day there is a risk to avoid it but 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.620
 for that you would have to know how many parts 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:37.959
 per million chloromethane contain those 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:41.379
 traces that recognize that they exist in the 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:42.960
 final product but that information does not 

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:45.870
 we have it 

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:49.020
 We will have to trust the agencies of 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:51.390
 food security those agencies that 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:54.570
 they look at products like stevia 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:57.810
 and yet they qualify as traces the 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:59.670
 chloromethane in decaffeinated coffee will 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:02.550
 something to see that coffee is the second 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:04.720
 most consumed drink on the planet alone 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:07.330
 after the water 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:09.760
 will have something to do also that the 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:12.730
 coffee industry 9 million dollars 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:15.280
 being one of the raw materials with 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:18.970
 those that are most traded in the market of 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:21.970
 Wall Street futures I do not want to be bad 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:24.160
 thought but know that there are more methods 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:27.400
 safe and that are hardly used for their 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:29.530
 cost does not reassure and less when 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:32.500
 since the 19th century they know gone 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:33.710
 decaffeinating coffee one more way 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.200
 safe 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:40.220
 every time we warn about a product 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:43.340
 dangerous or doubtful people take the 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:46.400
 hands to the head and exclaims that we are going to 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:48.380
 eat in the worst case is killed at 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.360
 messenger that is nothing other than 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:53.050
 criticize those who denounce these 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:55.760
 practices call us alarmists 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:58.160
 conspiranoics throw us in the face that 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:00.120
 sheen trust us just do not 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:02.430
 would eat 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:04.650
 but the reality for it to change must 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:07.860
 be denounced because behind everything 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:09.430
 this hides the greed of the 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:11.680
 industry 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:14.230
 you can get caffeine simply 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:16.810
 with high pressure steam is the 

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:19.120
 known as swiss but clear method 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:20.860
 why are we going to warm up big 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:24.190
 amounts of water and spend time and 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:27.100
 energy if with a simple solvent what 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:29.110
 we do in half the time and by the 

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:31.750
 half of money 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:33.760
 and this is what you have to denounce 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:37.120
 can do it safely and in fact 

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:39.130
 some brands of coffee do other 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:42.490
 they have even patented their own method 

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:46.450
 to avoid chloromethane but the 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:49.720
 most of the industry is pulled to what 

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:52.930
 cheap the bad thing is that what they 

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:56.560
 they save what we pay with our 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:59.680
 health technological progress have 

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:02.890
 an aim to improve the quality of life of the 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:06.610
 population but the reality is fine 

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:09.430
 different in practice the technology is 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:12.580
 puts at the service of greed is not 

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:14.080
 innovate to improve it innovates for 

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:17.740
 save money 

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:21.400
 that's why the more we progress more 

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:25.270
 healthy foods become dangerous not 

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:28.150
 we progress in quality we progress in 

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:30.340
 greed if you have passed the decaffeinated 

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:33.280
 for health you will have to think 

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:36.310
 return to natural coffee or look for other 

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:39.219
 options for it we offer you our 

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:43.560
 next video where we will talk about the 

00:06:39.219 --> 00:06:46.000
 advantages and disadvantages of natural coffee 

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:48.849
 I hope you have been useful this 

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:52.259
 video and we wait for you as always here 

00:06:48.849 --> 00:06:52.259
 on the reef
