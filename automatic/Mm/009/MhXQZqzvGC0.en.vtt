00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:31.490 

there<00:04:29.580> this<00:04:29.760> part<00:04:30.060> is<00:04:30.270> basically<00:04:30.990> just<00:04:31.110> one

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
there this part is basically just one

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.870 
there this part is basically just one
movement<00:04:32.330> and<00:04:33.500> with<00:04:34.500> this<00:04:34.650> heel<00:04:34.920> you<00:04:35.610> have<00:04:35.670> to

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:39.440 
movement and with this heel you have to
just<00:04:36.390> pull<00:04:37.050> on<00:04:37.310> take<00:04:38.310> is<00:04:38.490> more<00:04:38.700> intermediate

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:39.450 
just pull on take is more intermediate

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:42.350 
just pull on take is more intermediate
and<00:04:39.660> then<00:04:39.900> go<00:04:40.200> again<00:04:40.320> very<00:04:40.920> far<00:04:41.220> to<00:04:42.030> another
