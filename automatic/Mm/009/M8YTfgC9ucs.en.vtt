 finish 

00:00:11.119 --> 00:00:14.320
 good magaly playing on rivera that in Argentina was very exciting 

00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:17.839
 It is an unforgettable experience 

00:00:17.839 --> 00:00:21.710
 then the most important scenario that this country has and one of the most 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:23.380
 important in Latin America 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.410
 so it's a great honor to have the opportunity to step on the stage of 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.519
 river where great Argentine artists have been 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.269
 and obviously sharing the stage with our friends, the other achievements that 

00:00:33.269 --> 00:00:34.820
 They are super good wave 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.730
 I am also very happy that we have been invited to part of the tour because 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.740
 besides argentina we were also in colombia and chile 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:46.120
 but playing on the river is a feeling without forgetting it's really hard 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.420
 explain it with words 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.340
 clorox a cinema we are friends of the llanos flores I knew them they were 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:53.760

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:54.659
 ac 

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:58.959
 four years I had the opportunity to be two consecutive years in two 

00:00:58.959 --> 00:01:02.420
 yen dimensions I knew these guys 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.250
 that are great and we keep seeing when the angels went to some 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.880
 interviewed when they traveled to Mexico and had to make the note 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.770
 so or we did not do a very good friendship we have friends in common but 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.680
 I believe that the goods aires 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:16.940
 p 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:22.120
 it was in a very nice program because not only in the heart of cc oo it starts 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.510
 also from other friends 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:25.620
 discard that of other countries 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:30.640
 I was even going to travel with them in the new year at Christmas and 10 to know 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:31.370
 people 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:35.410
 from all countries with another culture and also have something in 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:38.410
 common that is that I like it says that we like music and acting 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:43.370
 brenda what I like most about the psa finch this I feel at home 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.580
 I like very much to do the program and I have around these eight years 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.160
 that tension worked 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:54.300
 I like that I'm very relaxed that we have a script but for the other two 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.420
 in what we want to improvise very much and be among friends that stops 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.700
 me this is how the most important thing emphasized before the one that was formed 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:02.929
 as in a group with 

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:06.210
 namán double of people who want people who are your friends and who 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.809
 and that he liked the things that I feel comfortable at home 

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:14.579
 from my best friend I think the final payment but also because we share 

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:17.320
 many things in common she is Mexican too 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.769
 and he's living here in argentina just like me 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:23.449
 We do not have our families very close so I think we made ourselves 

00:02:23.969 --> 00:02:25.070
 very friends 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:29.000
 and also a very nice relationship we take care of ourselves and we help each other 

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:34.329

00:02:54.399 --> 00:02:58.309

00:02:58.309 --> 00:03:01.749

 because it was good for us 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:38.419
 in the channel they go four times that repeat it or still continue in the 

00:03:38.419 --> 00:03:42.129
