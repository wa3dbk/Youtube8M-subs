hair<00:02:58.050> to<00:02:58.080> the<00:02:58.380> middle<00:02:58.650> section<00:02:58.890> I'll<00:02:59.310> need<00:02:59.490> the

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
hair to the middle section I'll need the

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.699 
hair to the middle section I'll need the
two<00:02:59.790> sides<00:03:00.090> and<00:03:00.690> you<00:03:00.959> cross<00:03:01.170> them<00:03:01.320> over<00:03:01.470> the

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
two sides and you cross them over the

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:05.300 
two sides and you cross them over the
middle<00:03:02.270> okay<00:03:03.410> now<00:03:04.410> you<00:03:04.470> want<00:03:04.680> to<00:03:04.890> cheat<00:03:05.070> your

meaning<00:03:05.730> here<00:03:06.090> and<00:03:07.050> you<00:03:07.110> divide<00:03:07.440> it<00:03:07.590> into<00:03:07.709> two

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
meaning here and you divide it into two

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:15.699 
meaning here and you divide it into two
sections<00:03:08.340> so<00:03:09.150> it'll<00:03:09.360> be<00:03:09.450> easier<00:03:09.780> to<00:03:09.900> grab<00:03:14.540> okay

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
sections so it'll be easier to grab okay

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:20.630 
sections so it'll be easier to grab okay
and<00:03:16.709> then<00:03:16.920> to<00:03:17.220> the<00:03:17.310> skinnier<00:03:17.730> section<00:03:19.640> you

incorporate

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:19.100 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.700 

then<00:04:20.100> once<00:04:20.700> you<00:04:20.820> give<00:04:21.030> the<00:04:21.600> boat<00:04:21.810> down<00:04:22.500> like

then once you give the boat down like

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.610 
then once you give the boat down like
the<00:04:22.830> neckline<00:04:23.340> you<00:04:24.020> pull<00:04:25.020> it<00:04:25.110> down<00:04:25.320> with<00:04:25.560> a

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
the neckline you pull it down with a

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.159 
the neckline you pull it down with a
front<00:04:26.030> and<00:04:27.030> you<00:04:27.180> continue<00:04:27.840> with<00:04:27.990> an

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:28.169 
front and you continue with an

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:30.440 
front and you continue with an
integrated<00:04:28.680> braid<00:04:29.010> a<00:04:29.280> regular<00:04:30.120> braid<00:04:30.300> that

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:30.450 
integrated braid a regular braid that

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:32.330 
integrated braid a regular braid that
integrated<00:04:30.960> braids<00:04:31.110> are<00:04:31.260> different<00:04:31.740> because

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
integrated braids are different because

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.220 
integrated braids are different because
a<00:04:32.400> regular<00:04:32.820> braid<00:04:33.030> when<00:04:33.270> you're<00:04:33.450> done<00:04:33.990> doing

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260 
it you go into like a V with an

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.770 
it you go into like a V with an
integrative<00:04:37.800> Brady<00:04:38.220> two<00:04:38.460> of<00:04:38.550> them<00:04:38.639> a<00:04:38.820> so<00:04:39.690> like

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
integrative Brady two of them a so like

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.480 
integrative Brady two of them a so like
whereas<00:04:40.139> a<00:04:40.169> regular<00:04:40.620> braid<00:04:40.800> you<00:04:40.950> cross<00:04:41.220> over

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
whereas a regular braid you cross over

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.280 
whereas a regular braid you cross over
the<00:04:41.580> middle<00:04:41.669> section<00:04:42.150> here<00:04:42.389> is<00:04:43.020> where<00:04:43.200> you

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:43.290 
the middle section here is where you

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:44.840 
the middle section here is where you
bring<00:04:43.800> the<00:04:43.950> middle<00:04:44.070> section<00:04:44.340> and<00:04:44.610> cross<00:04:44.790> over

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:44.850 
bring the middle section and cross over

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:49.159 
bring the middle section and cross over
the<00:04:45.210> other<00:04:45.389> sections<00:04:45.900> kinda<00:04:46.590> like<00:04:46.740> this<00:04:48.169> that

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:49.169 
the other sections kinda like this that

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:50.629 
the other sections kinda like this that
makes<00:04:49.350> sense<00:04:49.620> I<00:04:49.860> have<00:04:49.950> a<00:04:50.010> tutorial<00:04:50.340> on

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:50.639 
makes sense I have a tutorial on

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:52.340 
makes sense I have a tutorial on
integrated<00:04:51.270> braids<00:04:51.510> too<00:04:51.840> if<00:04:52.020> you<00:04:52.140> need<00:04:52.260> to

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:25.690 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:29.100 

and<00:05:26.290> there<00:05:26.890> you<00:05:26.950> go<00:05:27.330> now<00:05:28.330> if<00:05:28.570> it's<00:05:28.750> a<00:05:28.870> little

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.110 
and there you go now if it's a little

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:40.870 
and there you go now if it's a little
twisted<00:05:29.730> in<00:05:30.730> the<00:05:30.820> back<00:05:31.060> just<00:05:32.340> straight<00:05:33.340> out

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:40.880 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:44.480 

there<00:05:41.880> you<00:05:42.030> go<00:05:42.290> one<00:05:43.290> thing<00:05:43.620> that<00:05:44.250> has<00:05:44.370> always

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:44.490 
there you go one thing that has always

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:47.240 
there you go one thing that has always
been<00:05:44.760> hard<00:05:44.970> for<00:05:45.210> me<00:05:45.360> is<00:05:45.960> that<00:05:46.200> my<00:05:46.350> arms<00:05:46.770> totally

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:47.250 
been hard for me is that my arms totally

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:49.190 
been hard for me is that my arms totally
killed<00:05:47.790> me<00:05:48.000> you<00:05:48.090> had<00:05:48.240> time<00:05:48.540> and<00:05:48.570> done<00:05:48.870> with<00:05:49.020> it

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:49.200 
killed me you had time and done with it

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.530 
killed me you had time and done with it
so<00:05:49.410> it<00:05:50.160> just<00:05:50.190> takes<00:05:50.460> practice<00:05:50.760> and<00:05:51.270> after<00:05:51.360> a

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:51.540 
so it just takes practice and after a
