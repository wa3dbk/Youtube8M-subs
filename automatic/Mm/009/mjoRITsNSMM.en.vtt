00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:11.040
 beauty people talk a little bit of cayman is 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:13.169
 kayak just released by some gone 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.059
 People asked me what you're doing. 

00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:17.010
 talking about him making an account 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.020
 that's enough to say a few things 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.870
 some observations that we made 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:25.230
 during the fishery is to see if it helps 

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:31.110
 personal at na in the decision there in the choice 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:31.950
 well let's go there I did not like the part of 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:33.600
 stand up 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:36.089
 I found it very fragile and gave me the impression 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.820
 that when I stood up he 

00:00:36.089 --> 00:00:40.620
 sit a little and sink a little then 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.510
 so I think what should be a 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.670
 little more reinforced but can do 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.819
 a reinforcement from below is not legal but has 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.530
 like the cover I had to change 

00:00:47.819 --> 00:00:52.230
 Rubber seal that the rubber is 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.059
 very thick that came in it original 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.999
 then this rubber because it is thick does not 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.679
 was closing tava not sealing I I 

00:00:56.999 --> 00:01:00.569
 I managed to find a finer rubber 

00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:02.129
 I put this one if I do not 

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:04.470
 6 anta cheating 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.380
 I put one with dynamics of 4 closed 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.360
 cool and did not get in the water did not look good 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.840
 Nice with easy closing I put in the 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.619
 two with easy closing is made bracket 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.930
 motor 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.210
 in fact it is not indicated is indicated is the 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.810
 own company support 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:24.659
 but as things take a lot from there I 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.789
 I decided to make one very nice. 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.009
 well done, well I believe that in a 

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:30.180
 must be very different from the original not 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.210
 huh 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:37.439
 The battery I added I put it there. 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:40.409
 under the chair it was cool, huh? 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.299
 It was really cool, space was good. 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.670
 but could also put back together 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.850
 with the rumors that the height of the kayak 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:52.079
 in the water it was very good I liked it a lot 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:53.939
 the height of it sunk the same as the 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.619
 Barracuda for me, for example, is almost 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.229
 Water coming in that I'm pretty heavy 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.039
 right then was really cool was well 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.969
 cool 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:04.590
 the quiet legends support the tape to 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.399
 help raise good as well 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.200
 bold 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:10.229
 I think he should have come with Lenny. 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.959
 if I had come with a helm and fell 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:15.209
 here would be a very large differential 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:16.260
 you might even be thinking about it 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:18.420
 suddenly put 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.280
 It's important to put the name on it but it 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:24.030
 himself without the rudder 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.049
 he follows the good legal course follows a 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.079
 cool 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:28.980
 has done well on both the engine and the 

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:31.799
 paddling 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:34.170
 I can not believe that it even paid off. 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:37.680
 stayed behind because there was little 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:40.500
 're generally well liked 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:45.060
 kayak is kayak has the particularity 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:46.739
 be of the following is good for me to 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.430
 Sometimes it's not good, but I liked it 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:50.190
 enough 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:53.129
 I have already found the chair very comfortable 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.200
 also equal to that of the course does not 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:56.819
 should not need to be imported 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.099
 chair matter 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:04.859
 I found this fragile a bit 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:06.989
 support but it must endure so it should not 

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:09.930
 hold should be a little more 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:12.810
 embedded also the chair I tartlet 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.909
 I think it's because she 's young. 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:18.000
 she should lean more closely on the 

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:20.879
 time fishing table of theirs neither supports the 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.449
 lateral nets to learn the suitcase 

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:26.340
 Legal also liked is the only thing 

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:29.519
 I really did not like 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:32.400
 It was the question of standing not 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:35.639
 feel firm but no more 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:38.760
 liked the kayaking is okay by me 

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:40.949
 I'm sure you'll have an opinion. 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.410
 different as I have opinions of 

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:45.030
 market is very different, is not it? 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.829
 passing that what they said 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.940
 not to carry on pec but here I 

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:50.489
 brought him up 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:55.620
 I tightened up and saw no problem of this. 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:59.489
 kind did not threaten the goal of good so I 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:02.609
 I eat as if fishing a kayak already there 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:05.159
 some time I think it will give a 

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:08.579
 good fight and with barracuda barracuda 

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:11.519
 professions with the safari 

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:13.919
 I think the good fight with him comes out and he 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:16.530
 went ahead in my opinion with 

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:17.880
 relation to this because he has some 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:22.199
 differential 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:24.330
 there are chairs the side loops of the 

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:26.130
 rails already paid to place support 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:29.700
 finally he went ahead with some 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:31.860
 things and the price is pretty cool right? 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:34.020
 It's very cool so it'll give a little 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:37.050
 work and manufacturers is even good that 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:39.120
 they scratch there to try it 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:43.230
 improve this issue of the 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:45.600
 prof chu shack the safari or better 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:48.930
 bid on another to be able to fight with 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:50.250
 this one that, in my opinion, in terms of 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.080
 note 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:53.820
 taking the matter of standing and I 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:57.120
 I found it a little fragile I would give a note 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:05:00.770
 9 for him it's beauty people I hope to have 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.770
 Helped there, thanks.
