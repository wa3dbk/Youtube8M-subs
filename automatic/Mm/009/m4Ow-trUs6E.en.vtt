00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
different things that that when you

different things that that when you
first<00:01:48.930> look<00:01:49.259> at<00:01:49.380> them<00:01:49.590> make<00:01:50.220> a<00:01:50.250> lot<00:01:50.490> of<00:01:50.520> sense

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:50.899 
first look at them make a lot of sense

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:54.170 
first look at them make a lot of sense
but<00:01:51.899> all<00:01:52.590> of<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:52.979> unevenness<00:01:53.909> of<00:01:54.119> the

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.120 
but all of the unevenness of the
bristles<00:01:55.820> means<00:01:56.820> that<00:01:57.060> they<00:01:57.210> work<00:01:57.649> well<00:01:58.649> if

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
bristles means that they work well if

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.399 
bristles means that they work well if
you<00:01:59.460> get<00:01:59.640> them<00:01:59.759> in<00:01:59.880> exactly<00:02:00.540> the<00:02:00.810> right<00:02:00.960> spot

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
you get them in exactly the right spot

own teeth to adequately use a toothbrush

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:21.009 
own teeth to adequately use a toothbrush
like<00:02:17.930> that<00:02:18.340> interestingly<00:02:19.340> enough<00:02:20.019> the

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:21.019 
like that interestingly enough the

like that interestingly enough the
electric<00:02:21.650> toothbrush<00:02:22.189> people<00:02:22.730> have<00:02:23.480> made<00:02:23.810> a

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
electric toothbrush people have made a

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.349 
electric toothbrush people have made a
brush<00:02:24.500> head<00:02:24.829> that's<00:02:25.129> very<00:02:25.549> very<00:02:25.909> small

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:26.359 
brush head that's very very small

00:02:26.359 --> 00:02:28.720 
brush head that's very very small
because<00:02:27.109> they<00:02:27.439> recognize<00:02:28.040> that<00:02:28.069> it's<00:02:28.430> much

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
because they recognize that it's much

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.589 
because they recognize that it's much
more<00:02:28.840> efficient<00:02:29.859> so<00:02:31.150> instead<00:02:32.150> of<00:02:32.209> using

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:32.599 
more efficient so instead of using

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:34.720 
more efficient so instead of using
something<00:02:32.959> that<00:02:33.290> looks<00:02:33.620> like<00:02:33.680> that<00:02:34.099> you'd<00:02:34.549> be

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
something that looks like that you'd be

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.610 
something that looks like that you'd be
far<00:02:35.000> better<00:02:35.060> off<00:02:35.540> using<00:02:35.870> something<00:02:36.319> that

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
far better off using something that

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.940 
far better off using something that
looks<00:02:36.859> like<00:02:37.099> that<00:02:37.900> the<00:02:38.900> best<00:02:39.139> toothbrush<00:02:39.709> is

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
looks like that the best toothbrush is

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.879 
looks like that the best toothbrush is
the<00:02:39.980> smallest<00:02:40.549> toothbrush<00:02:41.420> the<00:02:42.200> softest

the smallest toothbrush the softest
