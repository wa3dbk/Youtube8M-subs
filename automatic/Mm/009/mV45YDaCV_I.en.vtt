00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:44.440 
excellent for a laptop I see we have air

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.900 
excellent for a laptop I see we have air
intakes

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:46.910 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.680 

and<00:00:47.000> the<00:00:47.600> air<00:00:47.780> exhausts<00:00:49.210> all<00:00:50.210> right<00:00:50.360> we'll<00:00:50.480> do

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690 
and the air exhausts all right we'll do

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.300 
and the air exhausts all right we'll do
a<00:00:50.720> quick<00:00:50.810> boot<00:00:51.080> up<00:00:51.230> test<00:00:51.500> and<00:00:51.770> you<00:00:52.070> can<00:00:52.190> see

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:52.310 
a quick boot up test and you can see

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:53.620 
a quick boot up test and you can see
it's<00:00:52.460> very<00:00:52.489> difficult<00:00:52.910> to<00:00:53.030> open<00:00:53.120> it<00:00:53.330> with<00:00:53.420> just

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:53.630 
it's very difficult to open it with just

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:55.660 
it's very difficult to open it with just
one<00:00:53.690> hand<00:00:53.840> it<00:00:54.230> sort<00:00:54.590> of<00:00:54.710> carries<00:00:55.130> that<00:00:55.309> up<00:00:55.489> up

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
one hand it sort of carries that up up

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:02.780 
one hand it sort of carries that up up
before<00:00:56.030> it<00:00:56.150> splits<00:00:56.720> open

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:02.790 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.299 

as<00:01:03.420> she<00:01:03.720> mentioned<00:01:03.870> on<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.320> 15<00:01:04.769> inch<00:01:04.920> models

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
as she mentioned on the 15 inch models

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.850 
as she mentioned on the 15 inch models

you can change the SSD and the RAM

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:17.200 
you can change the SSD and the RAM
inside<00:01:08.250> just<00:01:08.700> using<00:01:09.030> a<00:01:09.120> Philips<00:01:09.450> screwdriver

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:25.390 

you

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.400 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:26.920 

and<00:01:25.520> the<00:01:25.970> shrimp<00:01:26.090> that's<00:01:26.300> really<00:01:26.570> good<00:01:26.720> once

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:26.930 
and the shrimp that's really good once

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:34.190 
and the shrimp that's really good once
you<00:01:26.990> object<00:01:27.140> the<00:01:27.350> software

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.270 

this<00:01:35.200> is<00:01:35.320> what<00:01:35.440> the<00:01:35.530> he<00:01:35.650> went<00:01:35.740> back<00:01:35.950> that<00:01:36.130> looks

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
this is what the he went back that looks

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.980 
this is what the he went back that looks
like<00:01:36.400> in<00:01:36.610> the<00:01:36.820> night<00:01:36.970> and<00:01:37.210> it's<00:01:37.360> pretty<00:01:37.780> good

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
like in the night and it's pretty good

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.740 
like in the night and it's pretty good
actually<00:01:38.670> like<00:01:39.670> it's<00:01:40.000> controlled<00:01:40.570> by<00:01:40.600> a<00:01:40.690> light

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
actually like it's controlled by a light

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.680 
actually like it's controlled by a light
census<00:01:41.320> we<00:01:41.500> can't<00:01:41.800> on<00:01:42.340> during<00:01:42.610> the<00:01:42.700> day

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:44.690 
census we can't on during the day

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:46.450 
census we can't on during the day
there<00:01:45.440> is<00:01:45.530> a<00:01:45.620> slight<00:01:45.830> problem<00:01:46.220> though<00:01:46.250> with

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
there is a slight problem though with

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.430 
there is a slight problem though with
the<00:01:46.580> spacing<00:01:47.060> for<00:01:47.240> instance<00:01:47.570> you<00:01:48.230> can<00:01:48.350> have

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:48.440 
the spacing for instance you can have

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:49.870 
the spacing for instance you can have
the<00:01:48.530> power<00:01:48.740> in<00:01:49.010> and<00:01:49.250> if<00:01:49.400> we<00:01:49.460> gonna<00:01:49.550> plug<00:01:49.760> a<00:01:49.790> USB

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
the power in and if we gonna plug a USB

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.780 
the power in and if we gonna plug a USB
and<00:01:50.360> right<00:01:50.540> next<00:01:50.660> to<00:01:50.810> it<00:01:50.960> it's<00:01:51.610> you<00:01:52.610> know<00:01:52.730> it

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 
and right next to it it's you know it

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.600 
and right next to it it's you know it
doesn't<00:01:53.000> really<00:01:53.090> fit<00:01:53.330> in<00:01:53.450> very<00:01:53.570> well

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
doesn't really fit in very well

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.090 
doesn't really fit in very well
so<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:56.730> pros<00:01:57.000> it's<00:01:57.360> really<00:01:57.870> thin<00:01:58.170> it's<00:01:58.650> great

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
so the pros it's really thin it's great

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.700 
so the pros it's really thin it's great
to<00:01:59.280> look<00:01:59.430> at<00:01:59.640> it's<00:02:00.450> incredibly<00:02:01.020> fast<00:02:01.260> a<00:02:01.500> boot

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
to look at it's incredibly fast a boot

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.970 
to look at it's incredibly fast a boot
has<00:02:02.430> great<00:02:02.850> speakers<00:02:03.390> three<00:02:04.200> USB<00:02:04.470> ports<00:02:04.590> which

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:04.980 
has great speakers three USB ports which

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:06.890 
has great speakers three USB ports which
I<00:02:05.040> think's<00:02:05.280> a<00:02:05.370> substantial<00:02:05.940> amount<00:02:06.180> the

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:06.900 
I think's a substantial amount the

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.450 
I think's a substantial amount the
trackpad<00:02:07.200> is<00:02:07.440> nice<00:02:07.560> to<00:02:07.770> use<00:02:07.890> after<00:02:08.070> you<00:02:08.310> update

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:08.460 
trackpad is nice to use after you update

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:10.340 
trackpad is nice to use after you update
the<00:02:08.790> software<00:02:09.210> and<00:02:09.810> doesn't<00:02:10.140> feel<00:02:10.260> like

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
the software and doesn't feel like

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.050 
the software and doesn't feel like
there's<00:02:10.530> a<00:02:10.560> cheap<00:02:10.830> feel<00:02:11.100> to<00:02:11.280> it<00:02:11.340> no<00:02:11.490> plastic

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
there's a cheap feel to it no plastic

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.170 
there's a cheap feel to it no plastic
crap<00:02:12.270> on<00:02:12.450> it<00:02:12.480> it's<00:02:12.690> a<00:02:12.870> nice<00:02:13.130> construction

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
crap on it it's a nice construction

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.160 
crap on it it's a nice construction
