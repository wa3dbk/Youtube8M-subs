 telling mask recipe in this mask 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:08.630
 I left one onion I did 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.080
 crushed and squeezed juice out of it 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.650
 cheesecloth 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:15.590
 mean how many bulbs do you need well 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:19.149
 Basically you I think it will be enough if 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:22.070
 here is one such bulb is average 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:23.840
 why because you are still in this mask 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:28.130
 add and oil and 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:30.920
 the amount will increase further that i 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:35.840
 did eat cured onion and pressed it 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:38.810
 through gauze after that I added there 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:44.119

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:46.670
 I added I added my own but also oil 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:51.200
 somewhere I added a dessert spoon 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:56.920
 so added flaxseed oil flow i 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:59.020
 added more olive oil all this 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:02.050
 unrefined of course 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:04.310
 I also added castor oil 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:07.569
 spoon and 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:13.430
 5 drops of fergie your favorite 

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:17.000
 ylang-ylang means after that i'm all 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:19.760
 stirred and the next step is 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.240
 prepare the hair for applying the mask as 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:27.380
 i do i mean i urinate hair first 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:29.599
 then squeeze the hair gently towels 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:33.880
 just wrapping your hair with a towel and 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:36.680
 press the towel tightly with my hands 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:41.319
 completely all the excess moisture soaked in 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:44.420
 towel further after that 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:49.610
 mix the mask thoroughly and apply 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:50.600
 on the hair from the top to the end 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.550
 hair tips 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:56.870
 since you have onion juice 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:03:00.920
 mixed badly that's what you need to put 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:02.660
 this mask using a spoon or else 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.670
 in some other way 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:08.030
 after all , in view of the fact that if you just 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:10.760
 take this mask with your hand and apply 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:13.220
 your hair will stick to your hand 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:16.760
 only onion butter will remain 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:20.380
 below so be sure to put everything 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:23.450
 I put together just a spoon 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:25.670
 after applying the mask on the hair dress 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:28.940
 cellophane cap on the head 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:30.310
 wrapping my head in something warm 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:35.200
 just dybala 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:38.060
 warm hat here and went 5 2 hours 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:43.160
 the sensations from this mask are so pleasant 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:46.130
 heat goes to the head warms but does not compare 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:48.950
 with a mustard mask that just bakes 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:52.640
 so it will warm your head but so 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:54.980
 ok pleasant feeling after i 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.720
 held for two hours well then I already went 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.910
 wash off this mask and 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:03.680
 At first I rinsed my hair 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:06.140
 warm water after that I already washed off 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:09.260
 in order to wash off the mask, I in advance 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:11.660
 prepared shampoo means what I washed off 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:13.030
 took 3 yolks added there a little 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:17.930
 lemon juice 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:22.130
 here and went to flush so these 3 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:25.729
 yolk i went upstairs on so 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:28.400
 say on the horn here on the top 

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:30.400
 hair because up to the top of the hair 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.990
 I do not touch shampoo 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.240
 and my hair is just something 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:39.520
 natural rest hair length 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:40.419
 I washed my hair with shampoo from my grandmother 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.539
 Agafi 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:45.280
 he seems kind of cheap though 

00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:49.090
 but still I got it and I 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:52.050
 I allow myself to wash lately 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:54.370
 hair them over oil from washing hair 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:57.970
 Agafya's grandmother's shampoo 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:05:01.690
 city â€‹â€‹i was washing my hair i first for a match 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:06.220
 his hair then I applied each and this 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:09.130
 shampoo on the head where the hair roots 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:12.870
 here it is the makosh next the rest 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:15.190
 part of the hair here from the neck and below i have already soap 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:19.030
 shampoo from grandmother agafya 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:22.330
 after I have already laundered the length in 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:24.639
 I washed my hair with this shampoo 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:26.979
 then rinsed your hair completely 

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:29.590
 the entire length starting from the top that is i already 

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:31.810
 from soap and yolks and this shampoo from 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:34.690
 grandmother gottlieb all completely washed away 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:38.229
 woke up in that warm water and after 

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:41.320
 this most certainly has slashed hair 

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:45.330
 water with vinegar means I have one 

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:49.599
 tablespoon of vinegar to 1 liter of water 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:55.389
 Moscow vinegar so I mean waist only 

00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:58.800
 the length of the hair on the scalp I do not pour 

00:05:55.389 --> 00:06:01.349
 water with vinegar because vinegar it can 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:04.300
 provoke hair loss 

00:06:01.349 --> 00:06:07.510
 I want to say that after this mask is not 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:10.030
 smell unpleasant no one was anything from 

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:13.260
 no smell left onion 

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:16.570
 absolutely think why well first 

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:18.630
 still wash your hair and smell 

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:21.490
 washed off secondly if you 

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:24.970
 rinse hair with vinegar 

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:26.860
 vinegar also removes the smell of onions still me 

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:29.440
 came across information that lemon juice 

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:32.289
 also removes the smell of onion immune juice 

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:32.740
 not present in the yolks so I 

00:06:32.289 --> 00:06:35.590
 I think 

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:38.319
 then he also helped me do so my 

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:40.360
 hair was there absolutely not late one 

00:06:38.319 --> 00:06:44.169
 a word after washing my hair 

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:46.870
 plow only shampoo and nothing else 

00:06:44.169 --> 00:06:48.940
 generally all right all right to 

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:52.180
 the next day when the wolf is no longer like that 

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:54.970
 clean they still don't smell like onions then 

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:57.099
 there is even the next day at 2 on 3 

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:59.289
 step smell of heat the stones will be so on 

00:06:57.099 --> 00:07:01.419
 I hope this information was all for you 

00:06:59.289 --> 00:07:03.750
 useful to everyone thanks for watching everyone 

00:07:01.419 --> 00:07:03.750
