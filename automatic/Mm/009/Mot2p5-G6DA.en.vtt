 It seems that it seems like I can do it in my everyday life with such experiences , I think it's surprisingly small 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.670

 I squeeze wisdom to create a tournament that I can be proud of in the world 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:17.810
 On the other hand, even those who have unexpectedly reunited through volunteers 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:26.060
 After all there are places where you want to feel with the skin that you are doing on that excitement or inspiring television and participate 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.060
 You can then continue to 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:34.290
 Mr. Hiroyuki Kameda who speaks like this 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:39.740
 I have participated in numerous tournaments as a runner until now 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:46.090
 Kameda, who say Tokyo marathon is not blessed with the participation opportunities 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:50.150
 Therefore I participated in the Tokyo marathon for the first time last year as a volunteer 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:53.569
 What was in charge was water supply at 40 km 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:56.660
 Pass the drinks to runners make a last spurt 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:04:02.650
 I send ale while making a voice 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:02.650
 Among them, Mr. Kameda says that he was waiting for a friend 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:14.200
 I tweeted on Twitter about talking about volunteering for water supply at 40km 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:15.430
 My friend who is 10 years old has been reacting for the first time in a while 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:19.350
 Be heard 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:23.920
 Then let's meet again at 40km 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:27.040
 It is said that I had not seen a friend for about 10 years 

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:30.760
 Friends are the camera's how much of the time 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:37.260
 Because we did not know reach 40 kilometers 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:45.360
 Mr. Kameda kept waiting for the arrival of his friends while working 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:49.439
 And about six hours after the start I met my friend for the first time in 10 years 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:54.070
 He also said that he was about 30km on the way, 

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:56.370
 I say that somehow it won't go away 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:05:01.639
 Because it seems to keep running for a long time 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:01.639
 When I really met, it was a reunion with each other 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:10.500

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:13.390
 We will meet Landers at the finish point 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:14.320

 Aiming for impression as a volunteer 

00:05:55.880 --> 00:06:03.880
