00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.610
 hello friends welcome to this lesson 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.260
 number two of the session dammert where 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.650
 let's talk about the progressions 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:22.050
 double hands we go there 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.880
 if you stop to analyze a battery only 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.710
 makes three types of blows throughout 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.169
 his life are the simple blows the 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.060
 double hits or triple hits few 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:31.740
 there are more things in the world of the battery 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.930
 therefore it is very important that 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.949
 we have controlled the technique of 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.949
 double hands 

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:43.539
 you will see that the hand doubles are very 

00:00:41.109 --> 00:00:46.379
 useful to build groups patterns 

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:46.379
 rhythms 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.830
 yes 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:51.910
 also to build a very thing 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.920
 pretty that we like to all 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:56.730
 batteries that are the 'goes' notes or the 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.730
 ghost notes 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:06.580
 the doubles are essential at the time 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:08.880
 to elaborate our feels break or re 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.880
 double 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.890
 and as it is not an essential element when 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.890
 we start doing battery solos 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.540
 in this election what we are going to learn 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.180
 is how to practice those double hits of 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.770
 hand there are nine basic figures in a 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.390
 exercise called progressions that 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.480
 We have to control with our 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.740
 double blows let's make different 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:40.080
 fingerings or hand arrangements 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.570
 let's learn to emphasize the no longer 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:45.060
 emphasize we're going to learn what the 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.950
 graph or the musical notation of each 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.479
 of the figures 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.520
 in this election we will work 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.740
 subgroups let's work laterality 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.289
 We will work control time 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.880
 concentration mobility speed 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:58.590
 we are also going to do one thing very 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.360
 important that is waking our hand 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.240
 silly in my case it was always the 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.159
 left 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:09.380
 so you already know double progressions of 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.380
 hand download it and enjoy it
