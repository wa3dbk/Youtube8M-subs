00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 how come your or how rate 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.879
 you for yourself this great balance in the 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.910
 Champions League third participation and 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.710
 for the third time in the finale 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:15.890
 yes I think that we in this 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:18.390
 season a team are the the 

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:20.310
 not only has great cohesion 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.850
 but the players are doing very well 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:26.010
 understand with all around the 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.980
 team we work outstanding 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.859
 together and I think that we all 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.270
 have great hunger for success and we 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.950
 are german masters we are now 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.399
 now stand champions league endgame 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:41.550
 went barcelona and i think that both 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.410
 games have shown that we are on one 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.640
 very high level football can play 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:53.309
 and above all things elements 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:55.140
 the sure yes so in the form rarely too 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.989
 have seen I was elements they mean 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.120
 yes, first the tactical 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.520
 Orientation the organization 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.739
 room layout and then that we then 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.430
 if it is necessary too 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:07.799
 playing high-speed football 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.990
 can and above all that we do 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.240
 Defensive superior work the whole 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.970
 Team does not matter who is in the field 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.189
 stands and yes that we just mature 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:22.080
 have become that we we a team 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:23.610
 are from front to back and that makes 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.680
 is extremely noticeable now 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.479
 It has always been a type of trainer 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.700
 wanted this balanced football 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.840
 a football with rhythm with mature etc 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.930
 how do you have that team? 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.750
 taught yes I think that the 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.780
 the daily training work safely 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.090
 the essential element is that 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.700
 the positional game of attack ashamed 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.920
 Walks and so on and mine 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.770
 Team of course, huge talent in 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.930
 the forward movement but backwards 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.640
 We have been in recent years 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.399
 or fc bavaria always certain 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.040
 problems and there were two groups 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.640
 and that's all gone and and I have to 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.759
 say that 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:06.530
 surely we are also unlikely 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:09.560
 meticulously prepare for the games 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:12.170
 team with the trainers team and that 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.520
 result you can see now they have 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.530
 Now you can say it honestly 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.030
 worried and the yellow endangered 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.020
 games 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.270
 No, of course I have been there 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:23.030
 acted on the games for a few days 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:25.130
 that you also play such a game 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.930
 can without yellow card 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.370
 and I think that's great for the guys 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.280
 made because I'm looking forward to 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:34.640
 Most about it that we are not just here 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.769
 13 o'clock won a great game 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:40.130
 but that we have too 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:42.019
 Although cleverly played in the 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.560
 Battles have gone defensive work 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:47.120
 done but very disciplined 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.340
 can not be provoked neither by 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.110
 players still from the audience with 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.269
 such left in peace 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.500
 So all that showed then that we no 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:56.510
 get yellow card 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.400
 which value has the topgame on 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.450
 saturday it is already a kind for you 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.700
 rehearsal 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:04.130
 no I do not think that one is his 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.600
 can speak general rehearsal because yes 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:08.750
 both teams also a bit 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.100
 to rotate and it is just like that 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:13.280
 one has also seen today 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:16.400
 I changed the players 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.950
 simply have a rhythm of play and that 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.720
 then does not make negative 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.329
 but rather positively noticeable 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.370
 and that's the good thing we have in this 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:28.970
 season to the big player caste poor and 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:30.890
 very good quality and therefore 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.660
 I think we're on all three in 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:33.980
 All three competitions also successful 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.200
 final question is this 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.609
 final balm for her 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:41.060
 friend jupp heynckes for the friend uli 

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:44.870
 hoeneß yes I think that the team 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:46.920
 and of course especially for holly 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:51.150
 have played because 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:54.410
 I think so recently 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:58.650
 unlikely earnings yet 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:04:01.650
 that is something that is usually something 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:03.630
 man can not stand and me 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.120
 I'm on the side of uli Hoeneß anyway 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:10.010
 and I have everything we did today 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.010
 and that we win the game for uni
