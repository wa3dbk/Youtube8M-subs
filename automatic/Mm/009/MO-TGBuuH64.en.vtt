00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.070 
unfortunately it's not going to fit him
um<00:02:23.340> so<00:02:24.340> let's<00:02:24.550> go<00:02:24.730> on<00:02:24.850> to<00:02:25.030> the<00:02:25.060> next<00:02:25.330> thing<00:02:25.450> the

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
um so let's go on to the next thing the

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.020 
um so let's go on to the next thing the
other<00:02:26.290> thing<00:02:26.410> which<00:02:26.950> I<00:02:27.100> was<00:02:27.250> hoping<00:02:27.640> will<00:02:27.820> fit

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
other thing which I was hoping will fit

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.729 
other thing which I was hoping will fit
him<00:02:28.060> but<00:02:28.570> I'm<00:02:28.870> thinking<00:02:29.260> because<00:02:29.530> of<00:02:29.650> the

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
him but I'm thinking because of the

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:32.460 
him but I'm thinking because of the
shirt<00:02:30.130> it's<00:02:30.610> not<00:02:30.910> going<00:02:31.150> to<00:02:31.239> fit<00:02:31.390> him<00:02:31.630> is<00:02:31.810> this

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
shirt it's not going to fit him is this

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.790 
shirt it's not going to fit him is this
sweatshirt<00:02:33.310> that<00:02:33.790> says<00:02:34.239> boy<00:02:34.810> and<00:02:35.290> I<00:02:35.440> got<00:02:35.650> it

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
sweatshirt that says boy and I got it

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.680 
sweatshirt that says boy and I got it
for<00:02:35.920> him<00:02:36.040> because<00:02:36.250> his<00:02:36.519> nickname<00:02:36.940> is<00:02:36.970> star<00:02:37.450> boy

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
for him because his nickname is star boy

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.009 
for him because his nickname is star boy
um<00:02:38.080> so<00:02:39.010> obviously<00:02:39.670> this<00:02:39.880> sweatshirt<00:02:40.840> would

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:41.019 
um so obviously this sweatshirt would

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:43.800 
um so obviously this sweatshirt would
have<00:02:41.140> been<00:02:41.260> perfect<00:02:41.739> but<00:02:42.160> again<00:02:42.730> the<00:02:43.330> sizing

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
have been perfect but again the sizing

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.690 
have been perfect but again the sizing
is<00:02:43.930> looking<00:02:44.230> a<00:02:44.350> little<00:02:44.470> bit<00:02:44.739> tricky<00:02:45.190> so<00:02:45.220> I'm
