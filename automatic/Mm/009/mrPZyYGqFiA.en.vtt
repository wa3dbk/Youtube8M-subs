00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 hello and happy new year to everything for this 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.629
 first panic nail art of 2014 I'm going 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.519
 show you how to make this ribbon 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.849
 with just two polishes and one 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.849
 needle 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:18.390
 so I first laid the base in one 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.859
 pink layer 2nd cosmetics then I 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.720
 am going to use this red varnish which you 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.369
 need only two polish that is 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.779
 quite separate colors 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.609
 so I then ask you the second 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.380
 coat of varnish I put it so 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.269
 enough ps the day before I'm going in 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.640
 to add three times is still necessary 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.380
 it's pretty thick so if your nail polish 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.730
 is very very liquid it's not going too well 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.219
 worked on the shield a texture 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.840
 normal then directly with the 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.030
 brush of the other polish I'm going 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.170
 draw like that a trait not very well 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.210
 do not care a bit 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.129
 and here I show you the pen that 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.450
 exist or can be made in 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.950
 does it's like a criterium 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.239
 except that instead that is a mine of 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.520
 pencil it's just a 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.050
 needle also you have it not you 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.309
 might surprise pearls 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.210
 classics as I'm going to show you 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:02.430
 here and then with this pin 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:04.979
 we are going to make lots of little ones 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.770
 eggs to make curls in fact the 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.450
 along this line so we wait mostly 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.040
 not that it's dry you have to do all 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.720
 the steps that I showed you so the 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.970
 post of the second layer laying the 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.740
 red varnish and loops one does it 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.570
 in the wake must not dry it 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.729
 otherwise the varnish will become pasty this 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.040
 will be impossible to do so there I 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.600
 scratch my angle so I touch with 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.729
 pin I touch 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.810
 my nail actually should not hesitate to 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:32.580
 press and then I added a few 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.930
 small dots to both types toolbox or 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.820
 if you have none you can take 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.470
 a toothpick or even remake with 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.420
 the eel to make poems with the 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.490
 varnish and that's so it's over 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.290
 it's super quick to do and there 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.659
 really you need almost 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.440
 nothing like material just two colors 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.090
 they are matched 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.740
 I hope you like this idea 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.210
 do not hesitate to always show your 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.140
 creations on facebook that makes me 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.119
 pleasure to see them 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.860
 I give you an appointment Friday 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.369
 next for a new video to 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.369
 soon
