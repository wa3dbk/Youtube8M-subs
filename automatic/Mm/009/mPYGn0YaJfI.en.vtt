00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.590
 hi to all today I present you in this 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:14.000
 video the parkside welder pls 48 b1 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:16.710
 bought at the lidl at 11 euros and 90 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:23.970
 soldering station with temperatures 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:29.429
 rather inexpensive adjustable we see 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:32.130
 the contents of the box were one 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:35.160
 once open 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:38.309
 I have of course already tried it see 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:42.800
 that there are not many 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:49.829
 many protection parts we find 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:55.649
 station is a chore of several 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:58.620
 languages ​​where it is explained anyway 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:05.010
 explains how to use the 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:06.420
 welder with also a thousand where it is 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.979
 he showed that there is also then 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:17.030
 the Italian one is indica nego 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:17.030
 indicate the operating temperatures 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.869
 I had a range of change saying that 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:25.080
 winning degrees up to 500 up even though 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:27.380
 I don't know how true these are 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:31.020
 temperatures 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:35.100
 the station is now supplied with one 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:37.110
 sponge rather small e 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.200
 inside we have this strength 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:45.240
 accessories that opens by pressing in this 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:50.610
 where we find a pond provided 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:54.540
 under a stadium from scratch from a 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:58.409
 millimeter and from one and a half this 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:02.759
 case it focuses on this according to him 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:05.659
 should be a 60 40 same thing for 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:10.910
 this other 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:11.599
 it's a second tip now a second one 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.950
 tip 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:18.640
 a little wider initially 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:28.549
 in this plastic container but 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:32.500
 the tax base in these comfortable compartments the 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:34.989
 ferrule and very similar to the previous one 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:38.390
 soldering iron sold by them without 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:41.480
 adjustable temperatures 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:45.049
 we also have a spring spring 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:47.569
 hidden and protected and no touches 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:52.819
 so don't burn yourself mental not 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:57.739
 replaceable now but let's go to 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:03:00.799
 show here we have an adjustment 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:03.140
 of temperature as he said go 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:10.010
 wander 100 degrees in 100 degrees as there is 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:13.930
 also written above there is little Luciano e 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.930
 now let's turn it on 

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:20.299
 placing it 300 degrees and lo 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:24.250
 let's compare with the soldering station of 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:31.299
 a little higher this case the uil in the vs 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:31.299
 919 we are going to light 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.159
 and warm up 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.200
 here in this moment is in 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:52.770
 heating 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:57.160
 we will use this spaghettino here 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:04:02.340
 just to test the times the time of 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:06.670
 heating is rather long compared 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:08.500
 my second station 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:13.330
 let's see the substantial differences a 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:15.459
 tip much bigger than respect 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:17.200
 to others a tip that replaces itself 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:21.459
 he had n't shown by screw now 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:24.820
 is no mean warming up while in 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:30.600
 this case we have a lot more tip 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:37.470
 complete here in this case is already hot 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:37.470
 now let's try to show that already hot 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:45.559
 indeed 

00:04:42.319 --> 00:04:45.559
 welds perfectly 

00:04:49.390 --> 00:05:00.460
 let's do the counter-check and then see 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:03.620
 nothing to do warm up times 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:09.080
 from my tests they turned out to be about 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:09.940
 on the 5 and 6 minutes to get to 300 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.950
 degrees 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:16.430
 I don't know how reliable the thermostat is 

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:22.340
 internal to this moment 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:25.040
 72 80 or so is definitely a 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:27.080
 economic purchase for those who do not have 

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:30.500
 need something a lot 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:33.500
 professional I can also 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:36.710
 advise even if I don't know how much it can 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:38.180
 to be reliable the regulation of the 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:41.890
 temperature 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:41.890
 a greeting and the next video
