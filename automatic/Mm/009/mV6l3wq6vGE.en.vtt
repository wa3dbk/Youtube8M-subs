what<00:00:21.970> I<00:00:22.000> really<00:00:22.360> enjoy<00:00:22.570> about<00:00:22.600> teaching

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:22.869 
what I really enjoy about teaching

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:26.099 
what I really enjoy about teaching
online<00:00:23.470> is<00:00:23.949> from<00:00:24.250> maybe<00:00:24.490> a<00:00:24.779> faculty<00:00:25.779> point<00:00:26.020> of

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:26.109 
online is from maybe a faculty point of

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:28.080 
online is from maybe a faculty point of
view<00:00:26.289> not<00:00:26.859> as<00:00:27.010> much<00:00:27.190> a<00:00:27.220> student<00:00:27.699> point<00:00:27.820> of<00:00:27.970> view

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:28.090 
view not as much a student point of view

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:29.939 
view not as much a student point of view
but<00:00:28.210> the<00:00:28.300> faculty<00:00:28.510> point<00:00:28.930> of<00:00:29.020> view<00:00:29.170> is<00:00:29.350> I<00:00:29.770> am

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:29.949 
but the faculty point of view is I am

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:32.099 
but the faculty point of view is I am
able<00:00:30.189> to<00:00:30.340> create<00:00:30.760> those<00:00:30.880> relationships<00:00:31.539> that

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:32.109 
able to create those relationships that

00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:33.869 
able to create those relationships that
we<00:00:32.320> grew<00:00:32.559> up<00:00:32.590> with<00:00:32.890> in<00:00:33.070> our<00:00:33.160> generation<00:00:33.579> and

00:00:33.869 --> 00:00:33.879 
we grew up with in our generation and

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:36.000 
we grew up with in our generation and
that<00:00:34.390> was<00:00:34.690> you<00:00:35.230> know<00:00:35.320> when<00:00:35.500> you're<00:00:35.620> sitting<00:00:35.920> in

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.010 
that was you know when you're sitting in

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:37.650 
that was you know when you're sitting in
a<00:00:36.100> chair<00:00:36.340> in<00:00:36.520> a<00:00:36.610> classroom<00:00:36.850> but<00:00:37.090> now<00:00:37.390> I'm<00:00:37.510> able

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:37.660 
a chair in a classroom but now I'm able

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.630 
a chair in a classroom but now I'm able
to<00:00:37.780> do<00:00:37.960> it<00:00:38.050> on<00:00:38.140> a<00:00:38.170> computer<00:00:38.380> and<00:00:38.800> I<00:00:39.220> think<00:00:39.460> most

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:39.640 
to do it on a computer and I think most

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.330 
to do it on a computer and I think most
people<00:00:39.790> don't<00:00:40.030> recognize<00:00:40.239> that<00:00:40.690> takes<00:00:40.899> place

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
people don't recognize that takes place

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.770 
people don't recognize that takes place
but<00:00:42.340> it<00:00:42.460> absolutely<00:00:42.579> does<00:00:42.940> it<00:00:43.270> does<00:00:43.450> because

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:43.780 
but it absolutely does it does because

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.990 
but it absolutely does it does because
we<00:00:44.020> have<00:00:44.200> the<00:00:44.290> same<00:00:44.500> challenges<00:00:45.040> just<00:00:45.880> a

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:46.000 
we have the same challenges just a

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.360 
we have the same challenges just a
different<00:00:46.450> median<00:00:47.050> and<00:00:47.230> and<00:00:47.980> so<00:00:48.129> we're<00:00:48.280> able

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:48.370 
different median and and so we're able

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.040 
different median and and so we're able
to<00:00:48.489> communicate<00:00:48.730> that<00:00:49.180> way<00:00:49.360> they're

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.050 
to communicate that way they're

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.229 
to communicate that way they're
supported<00:00:50.590> that<00:00:50.710> way<00:00:50.890> I'm<00:00:51.280> all<00:00:51.489> about<00:00:51.700> support

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:52.239 
supported that way I'm all about support

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:54.569 
supported that way I'm all about support
and<00:00:52.390> making<00:00:52.540> them<00:00:52.750> successful<00:00:53.320> and<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:54.489> I

00:00:54.569 --> 00:00:54.579 
and making them successful and and I

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:56.459 
and making them successful and and I
think<00:00:54.670> we<00:00:54.969> the<00:00:55.690> student<00:00:56.110> walks<00:00:56.289> away

00:00:56.459 --> 00:00:56.469 
think we the student walks away

00:00:56.469 --> 00:00:58.350 
think we the student walks away
recognizing<00:00:57.309> that<00:00:57.460> they're<00:00:57.670> successful<00:00:57.910> and

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:58.360 
recognizing that they're successful and

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.020 
recognizing that they're successful and
I<00:00:58.450> walk<00:00:58.690> away<00:00:58.840> feeling<00:00:59.140> fulfilled<00:00:59.760> the<00:01:00.760> advice

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.030 
I walk away feeling fulfilled the advice

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:02.760 
I walk away feeling fulfilled the advice
I'd<00:01:01.270> give<00:01:01.300> students<00:01:01.960> for<00:01:02.140> online<00:01:02.469> education

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:02.770 
I'd give students for online education

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:09.539 
I'd give students for online education
is<00:01:03.489> to<00:01:03.640> just<00:01:03.850> recognize<00:01:04.390> that<00:01:04.920> it<00:01:05.920> is<00:01:08.340> it<00:01:09.340> takes

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:09.549 
is to just recognize that it is it takes

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:11.879 
is to just recognize that it is it takes
a<00:01:09.670> little<00:01:09.819> bit<00:01:09.939> of<00:01:10.090> discipline<00:01:10.569> it<00:01:11.139> takes<00:01:11.380> the
