00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:10.049
 no to pause everyone pause there is something 

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:14.759
 does not come back to me 

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:16.920
 look in 2015 beef steals the almanac 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:20.520
 sporty and carries the time machine 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.980
 to 1955 to give it to the young man himself 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.529
 but the moment it does it changes the 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.740
 the future therefore 2015 in which it returns 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.990
 it would be a different 2015 not the one in 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.220
 which were marty and doc is the same 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.220
 controversy of a dive into the past 

00:00:35.269 --> 00:00:40.440
 if the old beef came back in 2015 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.720
 after giving the young man the almanac 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.530
 beef could return to 2015 where there 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.180
 I'm marty and doc 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.790
 this because only after his 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.949
 twenty-first birthday of the 1955 bis 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:52.229
 has placed the first bet is up 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:55.110
 statham has the right place you want 

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:57.000
 to say that he has placed is tense 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.440
 just for something that happened in the 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.820
 the future of a past more is the fact 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.970
 from an event of the future he could 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:10.070
 to place 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:12.439
 good boy good then and only after the 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.270
 his twenty-first birthday b would have 

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:16.130
 could place the first bet e 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.880
 make the millions and here that altered the 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:24.720
 timeline 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:27.210
 yes, but he could not have placed it 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.220
 unlike a dip in the past not 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.340
 could be simpler when vip 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.260
 takes the almanac in 1955 the future 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.390
 alternative that creates is not the one in which 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:38.100
 marty and doc brown use the 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.780
 time to go in 2015 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.520
 therefore in the new time line 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.500
 marty and doc did not bring the 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:51.120
 machine in the wait is right they have 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:57.350
 brought marty and doc they could not 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:02:00.750
 bring what I know I didn't start 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:02.550
 we say so marty and doc would not have 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.160
 could take the time machine to 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.930
 2015 this means that the buffet of 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:10.920
 2015 could not have brought 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:13.740
 the almanac to the vine of 1955 therefore the 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:16.020
 time line in which the 1955 bif 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.690
 takes the almanac is also the one in which 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:21.000
 the 1955 buffet does not take 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.980
 the almanac and not only does not take it but 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.730
 he does n't know he did n't have couldn't 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.730
 take it 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:37.530
 is right and then what kind of name is b 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:40.670
 looks like the sound of when he opened a 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.670
 finsbury do tin
