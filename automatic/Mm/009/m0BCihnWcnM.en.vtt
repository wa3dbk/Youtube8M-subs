00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:08.250
 we already know that three years ago the band 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.340
 rebel developer is 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.740
 working on a new destiny game 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.139
 is an expensive and ambitious project that 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.390
 promised to bring freshness to the genre 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.270
 saturated with games fps 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.369
 the game is not ready yet but the band 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.250
 offered a beta testing season 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.369
 for some bj players and us 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.199
 we tested this access version 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:32.009
 anticipates wants to know how the game goes 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.410
 to be 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:41.010
 find out as we pass on to you 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:43.440
 our impressions we call it or 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.200
 traveler the test story tells me 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.700
 with a sphere called the traveler took 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.610
 humanity for a time of 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.280
 prosperity and colonization of planets 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.640
 but all this ended when an entity 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.949
 malignant disease known as the devastation 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.800
 civilization and the few survivors 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:05.220
 took refuge in the city 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:08.640
 the last safe place in the solar system 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.619
 In the game you are one of the soldiers guardians. 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:15.439
 that protect the city from 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:18.240
 mysterious and hostile aliens to India 

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:20.759
 destiny differs as schutter from 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.430
 conventional fps games to bring 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:26.130
 RPG mechanics in gameplay and in 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.380
 progress of the character the use of 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.210
 special skills and vehicles 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.400
 of the first vision transmissions 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.159
 for third person also give a 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.700
 interesting dynamic to the game talking about 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.840
 Rough way it is as if the gameplay 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:44.119
 mix the best in 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.119
 landis in these ect and hailu 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:49.609
 you can set up your guardian in the 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:50.810
 beginning of the game in three titan classes 

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:53.450
 Hunter 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:56.240
 the arcane it is possible to evolve in 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:59.119
 subclasses in the final version of destiny 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.969
 but beta does not have this feature so 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:03.380
 the differences are not very 

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:05.990
 significant 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.450
 the beta brought in emissions in the 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.759
 cooperative multiplayer story and 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:13.340
 which has already given an idea of 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.620
 how everything will work when the game 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.319
 starts the player goes directly to the 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.420
 story mode with no option to wander through 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:23.450
 and this ends up working 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.730
 as a multiplayer training 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:29.090
 two modes are also available 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:31.310
 cooperative exploitation and robberies are 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.769
 missions that allow team of up to three 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.709
 players and gives a point of experiences 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:39.349
 and medals at the end at level 5 mode 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:41.120
 becomes accessible and everyone 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:43.879
 the levels are deactivated 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:47.720
 so all they play on equal terms and 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:50.450
 matches become more balanced 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:53.090
 The look of the game is I'm confident 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.819
 the scenarios are large and well detailed 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:58.180
 the costumes are complex and the faces 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:01.099
 have realistic features and vibrant colors 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:04.549
 one detail is that the beta is with 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:07.430
 resolution of only 720p and 30 frames 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:09.889
 per second on all platforms but 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:13.220
 the promise is that the end product has 

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:15.150
 the resolution of 1080p and 60 frames per 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.430
 second 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.870
 destiny has a sound ambiance 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:22.420
 absolutely striking and martin 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.400
 o'donnell takes part of that credit 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.650
 he is a songwriter of the game worked 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.110
 for over 20 years with the band 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:33.700
 besides composing the music of five 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:36.400
 hailu franchise games the trail has a 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:39.280
 unusual blend that o'donnell brand 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.560
 sweet voices mysterious melodies 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.870
 guitars orchestras 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:48.069
 Melancholy and Keyboards with Tones 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:50.530
 futuristic the decayed continue barking 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:51.930
 com will see virgin ect bring in beta already 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.340
 a version of the game totally 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:56.890
 regionalised was a surprise another 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.390
 dark world beyond all terms of 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:01.060
 names have gained a version 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:02.140
 the audio was all on the side in 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:05.080
 Portuguese 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:07.330
 the overall quality is good but the voice 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:09.819
 the male guardian you control. 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:11.530
 there is no expression the same 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:13.660
 happens with the voice that tells the 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:18.100
 multiplayer that looks like google voice 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:20.200
 enemy translator captured the lost zone 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:22.870
 the lead in the original audio version 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:25.360
 the ghost one of the characters that most 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:27.789
 talk the game is voiced by peter 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:31.200
 dinklage did not have a series western 

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:31.200
 game of thrones there for you 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:36.760
 destiny has not yet shown anything 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:39.370
 revolutionary or completely original 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:41.680
 but he was right in several respects 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:44.470
 interesting history the visual 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.630
 impresses the music is great and the 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:48.680
 gameplay is fluid and dynamic and very 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:50.930
 addictive 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.919
 of course he is not free of 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.570
 problems 

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:56.810
 the artificial intelligence of enemies 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:59.539
 as well as the dubbing in 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:01.820
 but the whole of the work has 

00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:03.560
 pleased more than expected 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:05.389
 we need to remember that we will still have 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:07.699
 lots of news 

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:10.190
 the band promises that the beta is only the tip 

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:13.300
 of the iceberg compared to the version that will be 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:16.039
 released on September 9th 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:17.870
 is that the game will be entitled to all 

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:20.360
 agitation that has caused since his 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:23.389
 announcement and will it become the game 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:25.430
 of the year it is impossible to be sure until you see 

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:27.860
 the end result but access 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:29.810
 anticipated undoubtedly caused great 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:32.720
 impressions
