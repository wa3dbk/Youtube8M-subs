00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
freighter I want you to think of it as

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
now full I no worry about it so the idea

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.780 
now full I no worry about it so the idea
is<00:01:22.590> you<00:01:22.920> have<00:01:23.130> to<00:01:23.220> get<00:01:23.340> into<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.580> freighter

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
is you have to get into the freighter

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.370 
is you have to get into the freighter
get<00:01:24.090> into<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.330> court<00:01:24.570> and<00:01:24.720> fly<00:01:24.900> it<00:01:24.930> out<00:01:25.080> a<00:01:25.140> set

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
get into the court and fly it out a set

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.830 
get into the court and fly it out a set
rules<00:01:26.189> are<00:01:26.280> as<00:01:26.369> falls<00:01:26.549> before<00:01:26.729> people<00:01:27.330> are<00:01:27.450> in

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
rules are as falls before people are in

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.030 
rules are as falls before people are in
the<00:01:27.900> freighter<00:01:28.110> so<00:01:28.290> if<00:01:28.470> there's<00:01:28.650> nobody<00:01:28.950> in

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
the freighter so if there's nobody in

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.289 
the freighter so if there's nobody in
the<00:01:29.130> core<00:01:29.280> of<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.400> freighter<00:01:29.610> right<00:01:29.909> you

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
the core of the freighter right you
