once upon a time some clever folks gave
birth<00:00:03.750> to<00:00:03.990> the<00:00:04.140> personal<00:00:04.620> computer<00:00:04.740> and

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
birth to the personal computer and

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.640 
birth to the personal computer and
pretty<00:00:05.970> soon<00:00:06.270> everybody<00:00:07.259> had<00:00:07.500> one<00:00:09.380> soon<00:00:10.380> after

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
pretty soon everybody had one soon after

pretty soon everybody had one soon after
that<00:00:10.800> the<00:00:11.400> internet<00:00:11.730> appeared<00:00:12.150> and<00:00:12.300> all<00:00:12.690> these

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
that the internet appeared and all these

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.350 
that the internet appeared and all these

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
with each other then bigger computers

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.630

started<00:00:18.900> popping<00:00:19.289> up<00:00:19.410> to<00:00:19.470> act<00:00:19.740> as<00:00:20.039> central
