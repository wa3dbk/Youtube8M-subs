pretty well with common setups such as

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.450 
pretty well with common setups such as

with<00:00:57.270> a<00:00:57.300> hotus<00:00:57.720> I<00:00:57.990> would<00:00:58.140> recommend<00:00:58.530> using

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
with a hotus I would recommend using

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.310 
with a hotus I would recommend using
your<00:00:58.890> stick<00:00:59.310> for<00:00:59.700> pitch<00:00:59.850> roll<00:01:00.120> and<00:01:00.150> yaw<00:01:00.480> and<00:01:00.750> a

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
your stick for pitch roll and yaw and a

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.860 
your stick for pitch roll and yaw and a
thumb<00:01:01.590> or<00:01:01.800> finger<00:01:01.860> hat<00:01:02.460> on<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:03.000> throttle<00:01:03.420> for

thumb or finger hat on the throttle for

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.800 
thumb or finger hat on the throttle for
your<00:01:04.050> lateral<00:01:04.440> and<00:01:04.650> vertical<00:01:04.680> thrusters<00:01:05.810> for

your lateral and vertical thrusters for

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.450 
your lateral and vertical thrusters for
a<00:01:06.870> gamepad<00:01:07.320> we<00:01:07.620> could<00:01:07.800> consider<00:01:08.130> my<00:01:08.400> two

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
a gamepad we could consider my two

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.490 
a gamepad we could consider my two
joysticks<00:01:08.880> as<00:01:09.360> matching<00:01:09.660> the<00:01:10.020> two<00:01:10.200> thumb

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
joysticks as matching the two thumb

four mouse keyboard users it will be a

four mouse keyboard users it will be a
little<00:01:15.950> different<00:01:16.460> I<00:01:16.610> recommend<00:01:17.420> setting<00:01:17.570> the

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
little different I recommend setting the

and then Q and E for roll throttle could

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.080 
and then Q and E for roll throttle could
be<00:01:27.320> increased<00:01:27.890> and<00:01:28.040> decreased<00:01:28.159> using<00:01:28.820> thumb

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
be increased and decreased using thumb

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.749
