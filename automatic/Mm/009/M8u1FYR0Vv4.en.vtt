00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.060 

so<00:00:11.600> this<00:00:11.750> is<00:00:11.780> about<00:00:12.170> making<00:00:12.410> different

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:13.070 
so this is about making different

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:15.879 
so this is about making different
fertilizers<00:00:13.840> so<00:00:14.840> we've<00:00:15.020> got<00:00:15.139> fertilizers

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:15.889 
fertilizers so we've got fertilizers

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:18.429 
fertilizers so we've got fertilizers
which<00:00:16.850> are<00:00:17.150> made<00:00:17.390> from<00:00:17.600> ammonia<00:00:17.930> and<00:00:18.260> they

00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:18.439 
which are made from ammonia and they

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:21.070 
which are made from ammonia and they
contain<00:00:18.920> nitrogen<00:00:19.540> ammonium<00:00:20.540> nitrate

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:21.080

sulfur<00:00:28.790> and<00:00:29.119> urea<00:00:29.540> contains<00:00:29.960> nitrogen<00:00:30.200> we

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:31.009 
sulfur and urea contains nitrogen we

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:33.670 
sulfur and urea contains nitrogen we
call<00:00:31.189> them<00:00:31.310> nitrogenous<00:00:32.180> fertilizers<00:00:32.930> and<00:00:33.560> of

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:33.680 
call them nitrogenous fertilizers and of

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.229 
call them nitrogenous fertilizers and of
course<00:00:33.860> there<00:00:34.010> are<00:00:34.130> other<00:00:34.220> fertilizers<00:00:34.579> like

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:35.239 
course there are other fertilizers like

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:38.139 
course there are other fertilizers like
potassium<00:00:35.930> phosphate<00:00:36.739> potassium<00:00:37.700> sulfate

00:00:38.139 --> 00:00:38.149

that<00:00:38.329> don't<00:00:38.540> contain<00:00:38.840> nitrogen<00:00:39.340> we<00:00:40.340> can<00:00:40.550> make

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:40.730 
that don't contain nitrogen we can make

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.030 
that don't contain nitrogen we can make
all<00:00:40.940> these<00:00:41.180> fertilizers<00:00:41.750> by<00:00:42.470> reacting<00:00:42.920> an

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:43.040 
all these fertilizers by reacting an

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.340 
all these fertilizers by reacting an
acid<00:00:43.460> together<00:00:43.850> with<00:00:44.030> an<00:00:44.120> alkali<00:00:44.600> to<00:00:45.170> make<00:00:45.320> a

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.350 
acid together with an alkali to make a

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.500 
acid together with an alkali to make a
salt<00:00:45.770> which<00:00:46.250> will<00:00:46.430> be<00:00:46.550> the<00:00:46.670> fertilizer<00:00:47.180> and

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
salt which will be the fertilizer and

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.940 
salt which will be the fertilizer and
water<00:00:48.640> so<00:00:49.640> for<00:00:49.790> example<00:00:50.320> phosphoric<00:00:51.320> acid<00:00:51.770> and

water so for example phosphoric acid and
potassium<00:00:52.100> hydroxide<00:00:53.290> make<00:00:54.290> potassium

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:55.160 
potassium hydroxide make potassium

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.650 
potassium hydroxide make potassium
phosphate<00:00:55.670> or<00:00:55.970> fertilizer<00:00:56.750> and<00:00:57.080> water

00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:58.660 
phosphate or fertilizer and water

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.300 
phosphate or fertilizer and water
ammonium<00:00:59.660> hydroxide<00:01:00.170> will<00:01:00.860> react<00:01:01.190> with

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:01.310 
ammonium hydroxide will react with

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:04.060 
ammonium hydroxide will react with
sulfuric<00:01:02.000> acid<00:01:02.660> to<00:01:02.930> make<00:01:03.079> ammonium<00:01:03.530> sulfate

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
sulfuric acid to make ammonium sulfate

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.569 
sulfuric acid to make ammonium sulfate
the<00:01:04.670> fertilizer<00:01:05.239> and<00:01:05.540> water<00:01:05.600> and<00:01:06.590> ammonium

00:01:07.569 --> 00:01:07.579 
the fertilizer and water and ammonium

00:01:07.579 --> 00:01:10.660 
the fertilizer and water and ammonium
hydroxide<00:01:08.090> will<00:01:09.079> react<00:01:09.320> with<00:01:09.380> nitric<00:01:09.920> acid<00:01:10.280> to

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
hydroxide will react with nitric acid to

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:18.490 
hydroxide will react with nitric acid to
make<00:01:10.820> ammonium<00:01:11.240> nitrate<00:01:11.780> and<00:01:11.960> water

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.140 

so<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.620> actual<00:01:19.800> reaction<00:01:20.310> we<00:01:20.610> do<00:01:20.820> to<00:01:21.000> make<00:01:21.120> a

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
so the actual reaction we do to make a

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.570 
so the actual reaction we do to make a
fertilizer<00:01:21.720> is<00:01:22.020> a<00:01:22.050> neutralization<00:01:22.890> reaction

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
fertilizer is a neutralization reaction

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.990 
fertilizer is a neutralization reaction
we<00:01:24.150> react<00:01:24.480> an<00:01:24.630> acid<00:01:25.110> with<00:01:25.560> an<00:01:25.680> alkali<00:01:26.130> and<00:01:26.400> for

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
we react an acid with an alkali and for

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.150 
we react an acid with an alkali and for
this<00:01:27.090> we<00:01:27.300> need<00:01:27.450> a<00:01:27.630> burette<00:01:28.110> a<00:01:28.440> measuring

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:29.160 
this we need a burette a measuring

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.500 
this we need a burette a measuring
cylinder<00:01:29.370> and<00:01:29.760> a<00:01:30.030> filter<00:01:30.270> funnel<00:01:31.070> step<00:01:32.070> one
