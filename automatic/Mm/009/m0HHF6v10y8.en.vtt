00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:11.059
 the ajax women went to visit on Sunday 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:14.209
 in the grolsch veste at fc twente for 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:16.760
 the semifinal of the NFL cup 

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:18.440
 a difficult draw, because it is a frontrunner 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.170
 in the bene league 

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:23.119
 tough opponent so but ajax too 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.310
 backed by the thought that rather this 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:27.679
 season here with four zero was won 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.300
 here the pass of van lunteren stands out 

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:30.890
 the head of claudia van den 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.990
 Heiligenberg and then it is already in the 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.990
 seventh minute a 0 for ajax 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.280
 van lunteren at the corner flag gets the 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.079
 ball still ahead 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.969
 sari van veenendaal not there and then 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:45.739
 van den holigenberg with the 

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:47.989
 opening goal 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:51.289
 corner for twente at the intersection and 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:54.260
 then on the head of Kerkdijk 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:55.670
 but close at hand next to the first one 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:01:01.460
 great opportunity for twente 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:05.210
 only in the 27th minute here then 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:07.610
 tessel midday tries it very far 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:12.110
 the keeper of twente expects that shot 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:14.840
 not a lot and that doesn't make much difference 20 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:17.540
 again then paul on head of pi jpl set the bar 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:20.000
 and then menu of the must but none 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:23.300
 penalty 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.540
 bad luck for twente second time it 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.540
 woodwork 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.080
 You take the place of sharp fast forward 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.940
 in the baker 's feet think about this 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:38.880
 the holy mountain that sweetly room for it 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:42.140
 shot only two meters 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.140
 so in the anal rest position 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:48.840
 and here shortly after rest with ashley baker 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:51.570
 shoot quickly and the ball just disappears 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.220
 in the far corner 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.360
 surprising shot of wesley baker and 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.360
 ajax on a 2 0 lead 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.259
 let the ball run well has a space 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.810
 for the shot and van veenendaal 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.640
 looks at it and from that we are with 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.619
 ajax much better here 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.390
 tessel afternoon with lots of room but headline 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:14.130
 suddenly 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:16.709
 good chance for the midfielder 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.880
 your tessel afternoon with the corner c man 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:19.140
 brings in 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.870
 and is not baking then has something whole 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:28.230
 beautiful in mind wants it with the heel 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:29.670
 but mr ball 20 for dangerous 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.850
 corners here got the ball off the line 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.810
 from the holy mountain then still anouk 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.239
 dekker 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.760
 I like to shot and then also a shot of 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:41.880
 you hear what does not go in and then 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:44.910
 fans of twente know enough because 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.320
 Ajax wins with 2 0 against FC Twente 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.600
 The place is so for the cup final 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.459
 on Monday, June 9 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.200
 and in that psv fc eindhoven is the 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.670
 opponent and can try ajax 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.739
 to get the first prize from the 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.660
 club history 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:59.370
 you want to reach that final you can 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.980
 historically the same for the club Ajax that 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.440
 than the better one can win 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:08.130
 and yes we are very satisfied 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:09.570
 yes they are very happy and i who i 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.130
 you have to say it is nice too 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:13.260
 see how they handle it again so it 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.459
 is beautiful we have realized ourselves 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.590
 Be matches that this is the last one 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:18.390
 chance is just to get another prize 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.070
 and yes I think that's on the field 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.500
 what to see was web there were really like 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:24.390
 team and yes we are very happy about it 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.780
 so the final may be unique 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.220
 I think 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.260
 we are in second years have us 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.510
 intended to take a number of steps 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.910
 in every three years 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.680
 case I have as well contract for 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:38.360
 walking on course I said 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.400
 and that camera always calls have years 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.810
 we can become models that was the 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.550
 objective in advance at very close 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.780
 sat in the championship 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:46.910
 I think that is now a bit further away 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.560
 this is very close and for it 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:49.730
 then you have to grab that because if 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.230
 you can win a prize must do so 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:52.790
 the vagueness of the week together one 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:55.190
 had a little bit about it you know you can now 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:57.860
 as a team writing history and the 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:59.480
 get first prize with ajax so women 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:03.100
 yes it would be nice if they were mine 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.100
 name the smoke in between is yes
