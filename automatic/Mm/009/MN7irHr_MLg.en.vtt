00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.020 
studio JPEG and in this video I will be
doing<00:00:06.299> a<00:00:06.660> demonstration<00:00:07.319> of<00:00:07.740> a<00:00:08.519> couple<00:00:08.849> of

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
doing a demonstration of a couple of

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.780 
doing a demonstration of a couple of
microphones<00:00:09.510> but<00:00:09.809> this<00:00:10.080> time<00:00:10.469> in<00:00:10.769> an<00:00:11.250> outside

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
microphones but this time in an outside

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.660 
microphones but this time in an outside
situation<00:00:12.690> to<00:00:13.469> see<00:00:13.650> how<00:00:13.799> much<00:00:14.009> ambient<00:00:14.340> noise

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
situation to see how much ambient noise

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.140 
situation to see how much ambient noise
they<00:00:14.910> pick<00:00:15.089> up<00:00:15.240> and<00:00:15.590> other<00:00:16.590> sounds<00:00:17.039> -<00:00:17.250> such<00:00:17.820> as

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
they pick up and other sounds - such as

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.590 
they pick up and other sounds - such as
the<00:00:18.660> sum<00:00:18.840> of<00:00:18.869> birds<00:00:19.230> or<00:00:20.119> anything<00:00:21.119> else<00:00:21.390> that

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
the sum of birds or anything else that

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.740 
the sum of birds or anything else that
might<00:00:22.050> be<00:00:22.080> in<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:22.380> background<00:00:22.820> so<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:24.330> first

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
might be in the background so the first

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.580 
might be in the background so the first
step<00:00:24.990> will<00:00:25.260> be<00:00:25.760> the<00:00:26.760> Canon<00:00:27.300> t2i<00:00:27.590> inboard

from it and this is the shure sm58
microphone<00:01:30.659> add<00:01:30.930> a<00:01:30.990> bit<00:01:31.470> more<00:01:31.500> distance

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:41.650 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:44.530 

this<00:01:42.650> is<00:01:42.950> the<00:01:43.280> Souris

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:44.540 
this is the Souris

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.890 
this is the Souris
microphone<00:01:45.020> without<00:01:45.380> the<00:01:46.010> wind<00:01:46.700> cover<00:01:46.970> on<00:01:47.570> top

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:47.900 
microphone without the wind cover on top

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.950 
microphone without the wind cover on top
of<00:01:48.080> it<00:01:48.220> it<00:01:49.220> already<00:01:49.490> comes<00:01:49.970> with<00:01:50.390> a<00:01:50.420> built-in

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
of it it already comes with a built-in

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.800 
of it it already comes with a built-in
windscreen<00:01:51.800> but<00:01:52.730> I<00:01:52.760> just<00:01:53.030> want<00:01:53.240> to<00:01:53.300> see<00:01:53.570> that

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
windscreen but I just want to see that

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.900 
windscreen but I just want to see that
comparison<00:01:54.260> so<00:01:54.650> again<00:01:54.920> this<00:01:55.070> is<00:01:55.280> that<00:01:55.430> a<00:01:55.490> few

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:55.910 
comparison so again this is that a few

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:59.440 
comparison so again this is that a few
inches<00:01:56.090> and<00:01:56.950> this<00:01:57.950> is<00:01:58.010> at<00:01:58.280> a<00:01:58.520> more<00:01:58.580> substantial

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
inches and this is at a more substantial

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.540 
inches and this is at a more substantial
distance<00:01:59.960> and<00:02:00.230> we'll<00:02:00.500> see<00:02:00.710> if<00:02:00.890> that<00:02:01.100> makes<00:02:01.340> any

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:01.550 
distance and we'll see if that makes any

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:02.200 
distance and we'll see if that makes any
difference

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
difference

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:14.860 
difference
in<00:02:02.690> the<00:02:03.410> outside<00:02:03.590> noise<00:02:04.070> and<00:02:05.770> last<00:02:06.770> up<00:02:12.340> is<00:02:13.870> the

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
in the outside noise and last up is the

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.340 
in the outside noise and last up is the
zoom<00:02:15.470> h4n<00:02:16.150> microphone<00:02:17.150> that's<00:02:17.570> a<00:02:17.780> built<00:02:18.050> up

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
zoom h4n microphone that's a built up

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:22.810 
zoom h4n microphone that's a built up
sir<00:02:19.150> and<00:02:20.150> last<00:02:20.870> up<00:02:21.110> is<00:02:21.320> the<00:02:22.130> zoom<00:02:22.490> h4n

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:22.820 
sir and last up is the zoom h4n

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.450 
sir and last up is the zoom h4n
microphone<00:02:23.720> and<00:02:23.960> that's<00:02:24.860> the<00:02:25.070> built-in

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:25.460 
microphone and that's the built-in

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.540 
microphone and that's the built-in
microphones<00:02:25.970> on<00:02:26.240> the<00:02:26.300> zoom<00:02:26.690> h4n<00:02:27.160> so<00:02:28.160> I'm<00:02:28.340> doing

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
microphones on the zoom h4n so I'm doing

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:31.920 
microphones on the zoom h4n so I'm doing
a<00:02:28.790> test<00:02:29.060> right<00:02:29.330> now<00:02:29.540> with<00:02:30.380> when<00:02:31.010> cover<00:02:31.400> on<00:02:31.640> that

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
a test right now with when cover on that

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.180 
a test right now with when cover on that
comes<00:02:32.930> with<00:02:33.290> the<00:02:33.440> zoom<00:02:33.650> h4n

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
comes with the zoom h4n

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.750 
comes with the zoom h4n
and<00:02:35.230> this<00:02:36.230> time<00:02:36.500> I'm<00:02:36.740> doing<00:02:36.980> a<00:02:37.220> test<00:02:37.490> without

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
and this time I'm doing a test without

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.000 
and this time I'm doing a test without
the<00:02:38.150> wind<00:02:38.390> cover<00:02:38.630> and<00:02:38.990> we'll<00:02:39.200> see<00:02:39.470> if<00:02:39.650> it<00:02:39.830> makes

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
the wind cover and we'll see if it makes

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.060 
the wind cover and we'll see if it makes
a<00:02:40.310> big<00:02:40.520> difference<00:02:40.970> in<00:02:41.300> how<00:02:42.290> much<00:02:42.500> wind<00:02:42.800> or

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070
