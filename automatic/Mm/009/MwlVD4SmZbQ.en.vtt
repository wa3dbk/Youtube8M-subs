00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:11.920
 with a point 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.450
 webber of pain means is that such 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.580
 how are you welcome in other languages 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:17.619
 the call of duty advanced warfare and 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.539
 I bring the simple trick of how to have a 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:21.100
 scope for playstation 4 totally 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:22.830
 free and without having to open the command 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:25.539
 inside we have to do 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.270
 combinations with cables and so on is 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:30.460
 simply a theme of adjustment of your 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:33.190
 playstation 4 that is so simple that what 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.870
 could explain in about 34 minutes 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.239
 first of all I explain that it is unesco 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:39.340
 A scoop is a control normally of 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:41.320
 several brands in normally the creator 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.480
 is scott gaming which is the best brand of 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.640
 good scope normally as you see here 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.899
 It has some levers I do not have it 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.309
 I'm going to buy shortly because 

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:50.140
 well before having this trick then 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:52.450
 I prefer to have the most comfortable levers 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.789
 they have to put their fingers here and 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:56.620
 squeeze and good leskov what makes you is 

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:58.690
 that instead of having to for example see 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.790
 to jump I have to hit the X and 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.530
 put your finger back here 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.510
 and therefore I lose the way 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.920
 while high aiming is lost 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:07.720
 a lot of time in the advance wars for 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.550
 doing this in other commodities not 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.680
 but in advance warfare especially yes 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:13.720
 therefore a scope what makes you is 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.430
 can have to jump while you're 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.900
 pointing would be something like this you can put 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:18.960
 the hands to a little odd pre it would be 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.610
 something like that you see 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.430
 I'm aiming and being able to shoot 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:26.050
 while jumping is worth then what you 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.930
 I'm going to teach today is simply to do 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:31.900
 this small step of transforming the 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:35.780
 X to this button here that is called 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:38.000
 the e3 if I'm not wrong no r3 sorry 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.400
 then what will happen is that this 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.770
 this button the squeeze so 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:46.159
 it's just to bend over 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:48.259
 jump function when we press like this 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:51.229
 this will jump and when we press the X 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:52.970
 the doll is going to slide so without 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:55.369
 more delay we go there to how to do the 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.460
 trick is worth it first of all we have to 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:00.830
 go here to adjustments we are going to 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:02.899
 accessibility is valid where it shows 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.490
 accessibility we create to assignment of 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:06.409
 buttons and we give to customize 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.190
 button assignments if you do not have 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:09.190
 this little box 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.080
 if you do not have this box mark it 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.940
 marked mark it because if it does not leave us 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.170
 change the buttons well as follows 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.830
 saying we have to change the function 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:22.390
 of x to pass it to the east button therefore 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.840
 we have to select the square of 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:28.390
 x and let's find the button of r3 in 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:31.300
 when we find it, we click x and you 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.100
 We give to confirm with the X is worth to 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.930
 from now on whenever we want 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.880
 select the game we're going to have to 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:41.069
 press this button you know that now 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:43.109
 the button on this is simply for 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:44.609
 and now when we do this the X 

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:46.739
 You see how he will be made a doll when 

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:49.049
 put the X on the other hand when I do so 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:51.510
 you can jump and you can stop at the same time 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:52.379
 while when I squeeze twice like that 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.180
 I hope you liked it 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:56.310
 very much the trick as you see when I do 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.500
 so I squeeze so the doll jumps and it's 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.900
 much more comfortable to be able to shoot 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.569
 so good to give you many thanks 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.219

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:06.840

00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:09.299
 doctor calls your channel will be in the
