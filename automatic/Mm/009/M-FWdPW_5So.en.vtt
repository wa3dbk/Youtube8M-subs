00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
after that in March and April a much

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.429 
after that in March and April a much
larger<00:01:19.170> beta<00:01:19.619> test<00:01:20.040> that<00:01:21.080> hopefully<00:01:22.080> a<00:01:22.110> large

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
larger beta test that hopefully a large

larger beta test that hopefully a large
audience<00:01:22.650> can<00:01:23.100> participate<00:01:23.580> in<00:01:23.790> so<00:01:24.180> let's

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
audience can participate in so let's

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.210 
audience can participate in so let's
let's<00:01:24.990> let's<00:01:25.140> talk<00:01:25.560> about<00:01:25.680> this<00:01:25.830> event<00:01:25.920> so<00:01:26.189> the

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
let's let's talk about this event so the

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.340 
let's let's talk about this event so the
the<00:01:27.000> media<00:01:27.150> event<00:01:27.720> that's<00:01:27.930> going<00:01:27.990> to<00:01:28.259> happen

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
the media event that's going to happen

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.490 
the media event that's going to happen
in<00:01:28.619> February<00:01:29.070> we<00:01:29.460> don't<00:01:29.700> have<00:01:29.909> information

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
in February we don't have information

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.560 
in February we don't have information
but<00:01:31.500> we<00:01:31.590> can<00:01:31.740> speculate<00:01:32.159> that<00:01:32.340> this<00:01:33.210> is<00:01:33.390> going

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
but we can speculate that this is going

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:34.609 
but we can speculate that this is going
to<00:01:33.689> be<00:01:33.960> there's<00:01:34.320> going<00:01:34.439> to<00:01:34.500> be<00:01:34.560> a

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
to be there's going to be a

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.499 
to be there's going to be a
nondisclosure<00:01:35.280> agreement<00:01:35.909> kind<00:01:36.090> of<00:01:36.180> in<00:01:36.299> place

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
nondisclosure agreement kind of in place

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:37.429 
nondisclosure agreement kind of in place
and<00:01:36.689> there's<00:01:36.810> probably<00:01:37.020> going<00:01:37.140> to<00:01:37.200> be<00:01:37.290> an

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
and there's probably going to be an

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.219 
and there's probably going to be an
embargo<00:01:38.009> period<00:01:38.040> where<00:01:38.700> these<00:01:39.240> are<00:01:39.299> these

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
embargo period where these are these

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.230 
embargo period where these are these
these<00:01:40.470> media<00:01:40.890> outlets<00:01:41.250> can<00:01:41.460> go<00:01:41.610> into<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:42.000> game

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
these media outlets can go into the game

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.810 
these media outlets can go into the game
and<00:01:42.509> play<00:01:43.439> it<00:01:43.470> and<00:01:43.829> then<00:01:44.040> start<00:01:44.399> creating

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
and play it and then start creating
