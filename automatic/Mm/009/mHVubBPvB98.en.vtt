 I wondered what kind of song is good 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:46.010
 When you are recording another song 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:50.030
 The melody of the rust comes out fat 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:51.400
 It's a common thing, but when you 're making that different song, it's different song coming out 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.090
 It is common but 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:58.820

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:07.870
 but 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:13.980
 Because it was the fact that songwriting to the eaves the first time that 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:16.110
 After making a song, I still have a little trouble until I get to the lyrics 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.190
 It was a good experience 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.970
 Next month 2 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:25.290
 Because I am in the year I can get married for 216 minutes 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:27.240
 But the marriage watch number is 30 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.760
 It's about age 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:32.190
 I got to say so far 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:37.120
