00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.280
 hello world then today these 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:15.880
 tutorials videos 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:19.060
 so I'm doing a tutorial 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:20.980
 on a product that I have recently 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.260
 I particularly appreciate 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:26.380
 and so I have not you I spoke to you 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:29.500
 excuse me in the video that needs to be 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:32.980
 just before normal and so that's 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.730
 on the illusion of darkness of an illusory 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.610
 from chanel 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:41.550
 so if you want to see this little 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:41.550
 makeup I make you a small number 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.780
 so if you want to see how we do 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:53.200
 this little makeup I leave you 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:57.580
 watch the video 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:01:00.220
 so we will start by applying a 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:02.470
 base like here that you apply on 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:04.449
 the entire eyelid as well as 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:06.189
 under the eyebrow and then we go 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:09.790
 take the main product that is 

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:12.509
 this is the illusion your chanel humor and 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:18.390
 this one is the illusory hue 1 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:18.390
 like this maybe do a little zoom 

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:31.140
 So here I go with his 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:31.140
 small brush rendered with illusion 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:39.700
 to deny enough walkers and you 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:42.749
 go lay it on the majority of the 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.749
 mobile eyelid has 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:55.350
 like this so never enough for this 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.840
 is quite intense because this shadow 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.630
 is very flexible so the leg is 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:04.979
 enough and then you will come 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:07.350
 take a black eye of the planet 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.840
 cosmetics dp or if you have a 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:15.030
 clasp turns out very well here 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:17.940
 88 matte colors so I take with a 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:21.630
 brush like these and I like 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:26.580
 applied in the outer corner of 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:29.209
 Montreal on the on the illusion of which 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.209
 excuse me 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:09.240
 so here I also worked 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:12.490
 shading then you have come 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:19.030
 always with the same bread sow take 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:22.240
 a rather clear color so here I 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:34.239
 will take a gray like this always 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:36.400
 the same palette here and there I'm going 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:38.830
 apply it in the inner corner of my eye 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.420
 and just above of course with the 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:42.989
 brush blurs hours to blur a 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.989
 little of that 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:02.270
 So here I am going to come and take 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:04.340
 a matte white pencil like this just 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:07.970
 to put a basic species 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:10.190
 me that's how I live so I have 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:20.560
 done below the hard ones does it have 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:26.600
 below that I'm going to fade 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:28.730
 delicately and then I erased all 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:31.360
 the same ends just below with 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:31.360
 different brushes 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.660
 at 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:13.310
 and so that's getting to the level 

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:16.090
 in low and then you go 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:19.640
 rework a little bit the details 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:25.460
 for example I'll come faded a little 

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:28.490
 more here in the corner and I'm going 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:33.040
 go down to fade 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:33.040
 below the material 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:49.630
 then you take a lighthouse rather 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:49.630
 clear here I'll take this one 

00:05:54.880 --> 00:06:00.020
 always with them a bucket and you 

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:03.790
 in the summer just below the eyebrow 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:03.790
 for a light touch 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:20.510
 you insist especially here here after 

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:22.960
 you can spend your eyelashes for water 

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:22.960
 fossil 

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:45.880
 before putting your mascara so that's it 

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:45.880
 is going to be hot here 

00:07:04.649 --> 00:07:09.879
 and finally I'm going to spend a little 

00:07:07.929 --> 00:07:11.589
 the brush stroke with the little ones 

00:07:09.879 --> 00:07:14.379
 bottle all provide docile for 

00:07:11.589 --> 00:07:17.079
 race is well brushed and then you 

00:07:14.379 --> 00:07:21.099
 to finish you take a kohl pencil 

00:07:17.079 --> 00:07:24.909
 black and you put it in will he have one 

00:07:21.099 --> 00:07:27.779
 scrap metal excuse me leash 

00:07:24.909 --> 00:07:27.779
 lower in the mucosa 

00:07:31.169 --> 00:07:34.929
 I did not want to the end it's the 

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:37.110
 air world by cons I do not come back 

00:07:34.929 --> 00:07:37.110

00:07:40.979 --> 00:07:53.469
