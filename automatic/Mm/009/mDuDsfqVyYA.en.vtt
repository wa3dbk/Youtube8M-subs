00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
really it's a beautiful song when I

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.580 
really it's a beautiful song when I
listen<00:01:28.700> to<00:01:28.729> it<00:01:28.970> it<00:01:29.210> seems<00:01:29.720> so<00:01:29.960> hard<00:01:30.200> to<00:01:30.380> play

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
listen to it it seems so hard to play

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.889 
listen to it it seems so hard to play
for<00:01:31.130> an<00:01:31.220> intermediate<00:01:31.940> player<00:01:32.360> like<00:01:32.660> myself

00:01:32.889 --> 00:01:32.899 
for an intermediate player like myself

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:35.880 
for an intermediate player like myself
but<00:01:33.530> it<00:01:33.950> was<00:01:34.490> really<00:01:34.759> not<00:01:35.030> that<00:01:35.180> hard<00:01:35.420> to<00:01:35.570> play

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
but it was really not that hard to play

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.719 
but it was really not that hard to play
so<00:01:36.890> I<00:01:36.920> thought<00:01:37.399> I<00:01:37.810> make<00:01:38.810> my<00:01:39.020> first<00:01:39.729> lesson

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
so I thought I make my first lesson

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:44.170 
so I thought I make my first lesson

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:49.550 
guys out on how to play when I play

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.120 
guys out on how to play when I play
guitar<00:01:49.700> I'm<00:01:50.179> not<00:01:50.440> too<00:01:51.440> concerned<00:01:52.039> about

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
guitar I'm not too concerned about

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.080 
guitar I'm not too concerned about
playing<00:01:52.580> every<00:01:53.210> note<00:01:53.500> right<00:01:54.500> and<00:01:55.030> I<00:01:56.030> don't

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
playing every note right and I don't

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.960 
playing every note right and I don't
think<00:01:56.810> people<00:01:57.619> should<00:01:57.800> do<00:01:57.950> that<00:01:57.979> either<00:01:58.369> do<00:01:58.850> it

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 
think people should do that either do it

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.139 
think people should do that either do it
your<00:01:59.240> way<00:01:59.270> I<00:01:59.750> mean<00:02:00.410> as<00:02:00.619> long<00:02:01.099> as<00:02:01.160> it<00:02:01.550> sounds

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:02.149 
your way I mean as long as it sounds

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:04.600 
your way I mean as long as it sounds
good<00:02:02.840> sounds<00:02:03.200> something<00:02:03.770> like<00:02:03.920> the<00:02:04.130> original

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
good sounds something like the original

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.359 
good sounds something like the original
I<00:02:04.759> think<00:02:05.030> it's<00:02:05.209> okay<00:02:05.630> so<00:02:06.619> I<00:02:06.649> might<00:02:06.979> be<00:02:07.160> cheating

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 
I think it's okay so I might be cheating

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:11.350 
I think it's okay so I might be cheating
here<00:02:07.729> and<00:02:07.849> there<00:02:08.000> but<00:02:08.209> if<00:02:08.590> you<00:02:09.590> want<00:02:09.800> to<00:02:10.360> play

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
here and there but if you want to play

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.640 
here and there but if you want to play
it<00:02:11.540> like<00:02:11.720> I<00:02:11.750> do<00:02:12.020> then<00:02:12.410> just<00:02:13.340> follow<00:02:13.610> along<00:02:14.650> it

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
it like I do then just follow along it

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:21.860 
it like I do then just follow along it
starts<00:02:16.040> out<00:02:16.190> with<00:02:16.459> an<00:02:16.730> a<00:02:16.910> minor<00:02:17.209> chord

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:33.949 

to<00:02:22.870> G<00:02:23.110> and<00:02:25.470> then<00:02:26.470> this

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:45.910 

gee

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.259 

actually<00:02:46.920> I've<00:02:47.010> showed<00:02:47.190> you<00:02:47.220> the<00:02:47.670> wrong<00:02:47.910> thing

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
actually I've showed you the wrong thing

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:52.220 
actually I've showed you the wrong thing
because<00:02:48.629> this<00:02:49.530> G<00:02:49.819> we<00:02:50.819> shifted<00:02:51.300> we<00:02:51.870> use<00:02:52.050> this

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
because this G we shifted we use this

00:02:52.230 --> 00:03:07.240 
because this G we shifted we use this
one<00:02:52.470> instead<00:02:52.680> it's<00:02:53.430> better<00:02:53.670> so<00:02:54.420> go<00:03:03.890> to<00:03:04.890> this

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:22.370 

f/e<00:03:08.660> a<00:03:09.890> mine<00:03:12.620> slide<00:03:20.240> the<00:03:21.240> next<00:03:21.420> part<00:03:21.810> starts

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
f/e a mine slide the next part starts

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.280 
f/e a mine slide the next part starts
with<00:03:22.590> a<00:03:22.620> D<00:03:23.520> minor<00:03:23.790> and<00:03:24.209> we're<00:03:24.870> going<00:03:25.050> to<00:03:25.110> move

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
with a D minor and we're going to move

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.790 
with a D minor and we're going to move
this<00:03:25.739> finger<00:03:25.950> one<00:03:26.940> step<00:03:27.239> up<00:03:27.480> and<00:03:27.750> then<00:03:28.560> move

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:28.800 
this finger one step up and then move

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.050 
this finger one step up and then move
this<00:03:28.980> whole<00:03:29.750> finger<00:03:30.750> setting<00:03:31.260> up<00:03:31.470> here<00:03:32.060> this

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
this whole finger setting up here this

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:38.210 
this whole finger setting up here this
finger<00:03:33.600> down<00:03:34.380> on<00:03:34.819> the<00:03:35.819> E<00:03:36.000> string<00:03:36.150> and<00:03:36.920> then<00:03:37.920> the

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
finger down on the E string and then the

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.060 
finger down on the E string and then the
correct<00:03:38.670> way<00:03:38.910> is<00:03:39.180> to<00:03:39.360> go<00:03:39.570> for<00:03:40.050> debt<00:03:40.290> discord

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
correct way is to go for debt discord

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:46.230 
correct way is to go for debt discord
I<00:03:42.890> think<00:03:43.890> it's<00:03:44.010> an<00:03:44.130> F

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:46.240 
I think it's an F

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:50.240 
I think it's an F
I<00:03:46.270> think<00:03:46.870> it's<00:03:47.050> easier<00:03:47.640> to<00:03:48.640> use<00:03:48.910> my<00:03:49.270> regular

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
I think it's easier to use my regular

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:56.840 
I think it's easier to use my regular
d-chord<00:03:51.250> setting<00:03:52.470> template<00:03:53.470> is<00:03:53.740> used<00:03:54.010> 2d<00:03:55.020> base

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
d-chord setting template is used 2d base

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:00.030 
d-chord setting template is used 2d base
and<00:03:57.850> it<00:03:58.090> doesn't<00:03:58.420> it's<00:03:59.170> not<00:03:59.290> that<00:03:59.620> much<00:03:59.830> of<00:03:59.860> a

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
and it doesn't it's not that much of a

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.280 
and it doesn't it's not that much of a
difference<00:04:00.460> so<00:04:01.150> I'm<00:04:01.420> happy<00:04:01.750> bleah

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
difference so I'm happy bleah

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:13.890 
difference so I'm happy bleah
so<00:04:02.860> and<00:04:03.459> we're<00:04:04.030> gonna<00:04:05.250> take<00:04:06.250> this<00:04:06.400> one<00:04:12.900> and

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 
so and we're gonna take this one and

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.060 
so and we're gonna take this one and
back<00:04:14.200> to<00:04:14.350> this<00:04:14.440> one

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
back to this one

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:26.910 
back to this one
and<00:04:20.200> n<00:04:21.200> to<00:04:21.440> the<00:04:21.470> G<00:04:22.660> you<00:04:23.660> got<00:04:23.840> that<00:04:25.630> and<00:04:26.630> then

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:26.920 
and n to the G you got that and then

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:31.120 
and n to the G you got that and then
it's<00:04:27.920> this<00:04:28.780> dramatic<00:04:29.780> change<00:04:29.810> in<00:04:30.440> the<00:04:30.560> song<00:04:30.800> I

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.130 
it's this dramatic change in the song I

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:32.680 
it's this dramatic change in the song I
think<00:04:31.670> I<00:04:31.850> think<00:04:32.150> it<00:04:32.270> kind<00:04:32.480> of<00:04:32.510> illustrates

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:32.690 
think I think it kind of illustrates

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:35.140 
think I think it kind of illustrates
being<00:04:33.560> in<00:04:33.770> a<00:04:33.860> storm<00:04:34.250> or<00:04:34.520> something<00:04:34.940> I<00:04:35.060> don't

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150 
being in a storm or something I don't

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:55.180 
being in a storm or something I don't
know<00:04:35.360> buddies<00:04:36.050> I<00:04:52.750> often<00:04:53.750> I<00:04:54.200> when<00:04:54.680> I<00:04:54.710> play<00:04:54.980> it

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:55.190 
know buddies I often I when I play it

00:04:55.190 --> 00:05:02.590 
know buddies I often I when I play it
myself<00:04:55.370> I<00:04:55.760> do<00:04:55.820> like<00:04:56.060> this<00:04:56.240> oh<00:04:57.760> no<00:04:58.760> I<00:05:01.330> think<00:05:02.330> it

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:02.600 
myself I do like this oh no I think it

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.950 
myself I do like this oh no I think it
sounds<00:05:02.720> better

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960
