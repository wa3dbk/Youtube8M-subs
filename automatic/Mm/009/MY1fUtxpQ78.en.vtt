00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
[Intro Music]

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:04.620
&gt;&gt;Jon: Hi everyone. It's Jon

00:00:04.629 --> 00:00:05.799
&gt;&gt;Ryan: And Ryan

00:00:05.799 --> 00:00:06.709
&gt;&gt;Jenna: And Jenna

00:00:06.709 --> 00:00:07.609
&gt;&gt;Bin: And Bin!

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:09.720
&gt;&gt;Jon: Look at all of this food!

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.370
What on earth are we doing this week?

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.470
&gt;&gt;Ryan: It looks like we are just having a
junk food buffet over here.

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.940
[Laughing]

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:16.609
I'm not complaining

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:20.619
&gt;&gt;Jon: This is something I came up with all
on my own.

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:21.240
&gt;&gt;Ryan: Okay.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.350
&gt;&gt;Jon: I'm serious if someone else has already
done this on YouTube I'll probably hear about

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:25.660
it.

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.619
&gt;&gt;Ryan: Oh yea. The whole Internet is going
to call you a liar.

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.230
&gt;&gt;Jon: I don't believe this has been done
before but I thought it was a fun idea. I

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:33.870
don't know.

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.170
I guess the viewers will be the judges of
that.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.740
&gt;&gt;Ryan: Right.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:43.260
&gt;&gt;Jon: We thought we would take a look at
the brand name products, like we have regular

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.940
frosted flakes and see if we can tell the
difference between Kellogg's frosted flakes

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.940
and the dollar store generic Frosted Flakes.

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:53.140
&gt;&gt;Ryan: The Malt-O-Meal

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:58.920
&gt;&gt;Jon: So we have eight different products
here. This might be spread out into two videos.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:05.700
For example we have chocolate cream cookies
from the dollar store vs. original Oreo's.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.400
&gt;&gt;Ryan: We love Oreo's here.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:07.799
[Laughing]

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.900
&gt;&gt;Jon: We can't go another week without Oreo's

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:10.390
&gt;&gt;Ryan: No!

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.240
&gt;&gt;Jon: So what we are going to do is get blindfolded
first.

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:19.850
Then Bin is going to give us a sample of each
one of these fine products and then the dollar

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.960
store equivalent. Then we will try to guess
which one was the brand name. Would it be

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.540
A or B.

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.160
&gt;&gt;Bin: I'm not going to do it the same every
single time.

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:30.220
&gt;&gt;Jon: Blindfolds on

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.259
&gt;&gt;Ryan: Blindfolds on!

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:37.320
What do we have here? I have a Mickey Mouse
comic strip this week.

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:37.979
&gt;&gt;Jon: I still have Ninja Turtles.

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.850
&gt;&gt;Ryan: (in Mickey Mouse Voice) "Oh boy, I've
got a swell idea!"

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.180
&gt;&gt;Jenna: I went back with the Kermit.

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:42.930
&gt;&gt;Bin: Blindfolds on!

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.040
&gt;&gt;Ryan: Is it time to blind your folds?

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.040
[Laughing]

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.619
&gt;&gt;Bin: Okay, you guys ready?

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:52.430
&gt;&gt;Ryan: This is A and this is B right?

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:52.860
&gt;&gt;Bin: Yes

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.570
Okay, you guys ready?

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.740
We are going to start with the Wheat thins
versus the Hearty Baked Wheat.

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:05.920
So here is A

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.820
&gt;&gt;Ryan: Are you giving us the generic or the name brand  first?

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.139
&gt;&gt;Bin: I'm not telling you.

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.780
&gt;&gt;Ryan: I tried to trick you but it didn't
work

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:15.109
[Laughing]

00:02:15.109 --> 00:02:16.680
They're both just original flavor right?

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:17.639
&gt;&gt;Bin: Yes.

00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:21.480
&gt;&gt;Jenna: Did you give us both of them?

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.609
&gt;&gt;Bin: No. I gave you just one

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.540
&gt;&gt;Ryan: So these are both the exact same?
From the same box.

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:30.590
&gt;&gt;Bin: Yes.

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:37.769
&gt;&gt;Ryan: They're pretty good. I don't know
why I don't eat Wheat Thins or the generic

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:39.699
equivalent.

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:42.859
&gt;&gt;Bin: You ready for the next sampling?

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.220
&gt;&gt;Jenna: Yup

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:45.920
&gt;&gt;Ryan: Mmm, these are pretty tasty!

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:51.229
&gt;&gt;Ryan: There's a little difference but also 
very good.

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:57.760
&gt;&gt;Bin: Okay, which one do you think is the
brand name? The Wheat Thins

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:05.180
&gt;&gt;Jenna: I have no idea

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:10.320
&gt;&gt;Bin: Jon, keep holding yours up.

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:19.299
Next up we have the Cheez Its or the Tangy
Cheddar Squares.

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:24.339
&gt;&gt;Ryan: I think I'll do okay on this because
I can tell the difference between Cheez Its

00:03:24.339 --> 00:03:24.999
and Cheese Nips.

00:03:24.999 --> 00:03:26.849
&gt;&gt;Jon: You're kind of a Cheez Its Connoisseur?

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:27.779
&gt;&gt;Ryan: Of sorts. Yes.

00:03:27.779 --> 00:03:29.919
&gt;&gt;Bin: Do you eat a lot of Cheez Its?

00:03:29.919 --> 00:03:35.209
&gt;&gt;Ryan: You know my favorite Cheez Its are
the reduced fat Cheez Its because they almost

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:41.129
taste like they're burnt like they have been
baked a little too long and I really like

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:42.189
the taste.

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:52.420
&gt;&gt;Jon: It's actually been a long time since
I've had a Cheez It.

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:53.930
&gt;&gt;Ryan: I had some this morning.

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:57.100
&gt;&gt;Jon: You have them for breakfast every morning?
(Laughs)

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:58.699
&gt;&gt;Ryan: No I had them for a snack.

00:03:58.699 --> 00:04:02.619
Again a very similar size.

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.189
&gt;&gt;Bin: Okay, which one do you think is the
brand named Cheez It.

00:04:12.189 --> 00:04:14.609
&gt;&gt;Ryan: I like these tasty challenges.

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:25.780
&gt;&gt;Bin: Okay, next up we have the Nutri Grain
Berry or the Mrs. Freshly's fruit and grain

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.699
mixed fruit cereal bar.

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:32.659
&gt;&gt;Ryan: Well Nutri Grain sounds like a good
thing but Mrs. Freshly's just sounds fantastic!

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:33.689
[Laughing]

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:36.639
With a name like Mrs. Freshly's it's got to
be good!

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:41.520
I think I might have done some Smucker's copyright
infringement.

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.349
&gt;&gt;Ryan: Oh I have one here on the table

00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:46.289
&gt;&gt;Bin: Yea. Sorry

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:48.810
&gt;&gt;Ryan: I was just sitting here with my hands
out like a dummy.

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:49.259
[Laughing]

00:04:49.259 --> 00:04:51.520
&gt;&gt;Bin: Sorry. My bad (Laughs)

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.129
(Laughs) Are you guys having issues opening
those?

00:04:55.129 --> 00:05:00.189
&gt;&gt;Jon: Well my hand still has some Cheez It
grease on there. (Laughs) All right I got

00:05:00.189 --> 00:05:00.770
it opened.

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:05.979
So is this Mrs. Freshly's or Nutri Grain?
Let's find out.

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:07.919
&gt;&gt;Ryan: It's good.

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:12.650
&gt;&gt;Bin: Okay, are you guys ready for the next
one?

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:15.719
&gt;&gt;Jon: It opened a lot easier.

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:29.389
&gt;&gt;Jon: This challenge is a lot harder than
you think.

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:35.389
&gt;&gt;Ryan: Everything has tasted very similar
so far.

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:37.889
&gt;&gt;Bin: Okay, are you ready?

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:40.560
Which one is the Nutri Grain Bar?

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.449
&gt;&gt;Ryan: Are these still in the right order?

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:43.969
&gt;&gt;Bin: Yes

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:48.289
&gt;&gt;Jenna: I don't know which one this is.

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:50.269
&gt;&gt;Bin: You guys ready for the next one?

00:05:50.269 --> 00:05:52.510
&gt;&gt;Jon: Number 4 the half way mark.

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:58.460
&gt;&gt;Bin: Half way mark! So we are going Frosted
Flakes versus Frosted Flakes

00:05:58.469 --> 00:05:59.289
[Laughing]

00:05:59.289 --> 00:06:03.449
So we have Kellogg's versus Malt-O-Meal.

00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:03.729
&gt;&gt;Ryan: Malt-O-Meal

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:05.189
&gt;&gt;Jon: Which one is great?

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:17.099
&gt;&gt;Ryan: Wow this is a tough one

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:22.420
&gt;&gt;Bin: Okay, which one is the Kellogg's Frosted
Flakes. A or B

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:24.530
&gt;&gt;Jon: Oh man!

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:26.979
&gt;&gt;Ryan: They both tasted very similar.

00:06:26.979 --> 00:06:32.919
&gt;&gt;Jon: They both tasted very similar but the
second sample of flakes felt a little smaller.

00:06:32.919 --> 00:06:34.300
You know smaller flakes.

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:37.759
&gt;&gt;Ryan: I didn't notice that but that's a
good point.

00:06:37.759 --> 00:06:39.139
&gt;&gt;Jenna: They're also thicker.

00:06:39.139 --> 00:06:44.159
&gt;&gt;Jon: All right well I'm just going to take
a shot in the dark here.

00:06:44.159 --> 00:06:45.210
&gt;&gt;Bin: Okay.

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:52.740
&gt;&gt;Jon: All right. How about we stop the video
for this week and get back to you guys next

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:54.499
week for part two.

00:06:54.499 --> 00:07:00.580
So we will be back next week with the conclusion
of our Dollar Store Challenge and be sure

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:04.139
to subscribe to our channel. Like and comment.
We'll see you next time everybody.

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:10.039
&gt;&gt;Ryan: All right so are we going to shoot
the next one for next week?

00:07:10.039 --> 00:07:13.759
[Sound of door shutting and crickets]

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:16.050
&gt;&gt;Ryan: Guys?

00:07:18.919 --> 00:07:21.539
Real Funny!

00:07:21.539 --> 00:07:23.889
