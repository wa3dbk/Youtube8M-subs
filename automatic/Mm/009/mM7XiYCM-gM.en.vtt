00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:10.769
 next here we have a kitchen 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:14.070
 of wall and that 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:17.750
 this type of kitchen or wall blog like 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:21.380
 he knows him normally 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:26.330
 in this case, this is this kitchen 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:28.430
 wall and that is why it is lined with a 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:30.890
 pvc product or with pvc doors 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:33.610
 however I would like to make the 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.610
 following observations 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:42.790
 the pvc for saying in this case they cover it 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:46.760
 in this case if we can see the lined 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:51.200
 this in this case is from a is from a 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:53.770
 thickness of 6 16 seven millimeters we're 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:56.329
 practically speaking 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:01:02.539
 and you can not see 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:05.299
 6 millimeters however we for 

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:08.790
 avoid that the one in this case is 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:13.530
 sliding where the drawers run 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:16.110
 the screw directly on what 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.380
 which is the plaster in this case, then with the 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.360
 use of the opening and closing movement of 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.000
 the drawers are made that these sliding 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.910
 hector that these screws are falling and 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.120
 it and the drawers fall is in this 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:29.120
 case 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.810
 we use a much more framework 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:38.270
 thickness in this case 20 millimeters and 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:42.409
 then we make an all that is a 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:45.679
 a structure to cover what is 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:48.710
 this let's see the inside the interior is 

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:51.350
 extremely thick yes then we are 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:54.799
 talking about 20 millimeters then and 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.329
 we also cover if we cover what is 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:58.520
 everything is the wall we lined 

00:01:56.329 --> 00:02:00.319
 PVC also this is so that no 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.030
 this occurs you will not drop it 

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:03.590
 that usually loosen what are the 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.990
 screws because remember that this is 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.780
 and that is not block is very are two 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:12.430
 different two different concepts the 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:15.049
 plaster is porous and then over time 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.060
 dry on the slides or the use 

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:19.760
 the screws fall dry and they fall 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:23.290
 the drawers then this is how 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:25.540
 should should be what is this 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:28.329
 the lining in case the customer already 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.670
 have this see my hands you do not know 

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:34.569
 can completely see that if it is or not 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:37.130
 and on the other hand 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:40.630
 in the case of 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.630
 let's see here what is a 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:47.819
 what we are going to open what is the door 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:50.549
 here we see that here what is this 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:52.560
 we see the same case, not the 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:55.650
 hinges are installed directly 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:58.439
 on the plaster yes although here they see it from 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:01.200
 another color color the chocolate without 

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:04.020
 However, this one 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.000
 this system tends to fall 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:09.140
 because with the use he spoke, we are talking 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:13.080
 the same thing they fall with using this kind of 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:14.340
 this type of hinge because it's 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.769
 directly is what has given you 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.840
 perforated directly to the plaster in this 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:22.380
 case here you can see a screw 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:24.480
 an additional screw that is therefore what 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:28.830
 they put precisely to avoid themselves in what 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:32.310
 that is the use of an interior reinforcement 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:36.300
 let's go back to the theme of the hinge 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:38.170
 we use this framework I do not know 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:42.880
 you can see 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:45.849
 this framework instead of this this by 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:49.540
 say that the thickness is 7 mm 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:51.690
 we use a 1 of 20 in this case the 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:55.410
 hinge will be placed directly 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:57.760
 it is a hinge of a shorter leg 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:02.360
 directly on what is the framework of 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:04.580
 pvc then we're going to prevent it from being 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.770
 well this situation where the 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:08.810
 doors today where the side what are the 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:10.310
 hinges are directly installed 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:15.160
 to the plaster 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:15.160
 and about what is this 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.170
 about what it is 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.930
 the screw that we are talking about right now 

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:26.910
 that screw is repeated as people 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:29.580
 Well, this is a home remedy that 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:33.330
 they use other companies and well this is 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:36.330
 the east in this case we use 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:40.110
 as an inner reinforcement this reinforcement 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:43.340
 interior is what gives it the rigidity this 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:45.980
 it's a hinge I brought this panel 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:48.410
 then this pvc reinforcement is what 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:49.960
 It completely gives the rigidity to 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:54.340
 product 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:56.470
 then at the time of for those 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:05:00.039
 people who already have their pvc kitchen 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:02.190
 a pardon of moore or plaster then well that 

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:04.870
 think well with how they will line or that 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:08.919
 the provider will use for the time 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:10.930
 of selecting is not the type of assembly 

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:14.470
 and the kind of materials that I was looking to use 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:17.319
 and then, since we are on that subject, let's see 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:20.800
 the differential this is when it is and that 

00:05:17.319 --> 00:05:23.470
 this is covered with pvc but not for 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.729
 the people who are thinking about using 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:26.969
 this 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:29.549
 well 

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:32.089
 or buy all of plaster they use all the 

00:05:29.549 --> 00:05:35.780
 structure to show the difference 

00:05:32.089 --> 00:05:39.470
 six centimeters thick plaster 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:41.360
 against 20 millimeters it is extremely the 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:44.240
 plaster takes away too much space what 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:46.940
 is the kitchen's functionality 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:49.550
 so then let's hope that with this 

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:51.350
 has become a little clearer what 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:53.930
 is the functionality and how it should be 

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:56.870
 lined what is the area of ​​the 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:06:01.220
 true then for those people who already 

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:04.100
 have already cast structure if it 

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:07.610
 is another also another other 

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:10.310
 hinge then economic as there are other 

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:13.340
 type of hinges for the doors this one 

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:15.950
 nl then of better quality then then 

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:17.900
 These are some of the tips that you 

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:19.820
 We can give you to improve the 

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:20.480
 durability of your product and its 

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:22.780
 investment 

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:28.010
 let's hope the concept was made clear 

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:29.220
 of at the time that they form their their kitchen 

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:33.170
 of 

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:33.170
 with plc no thanks
