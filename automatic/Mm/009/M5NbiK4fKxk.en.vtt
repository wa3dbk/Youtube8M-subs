00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 buds we 're going to go to the section of 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.029
 shore to my creativity and a lot 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.220
 I'm going to teach you how to make an imagination 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:11.070
 soup made with a square leaf 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.320
 you will learn how to make a very beautiful one 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:17.120
 through the art of origami where the 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.120
 imagination has no limit 

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:35.930
 little friends at home how to use 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.000
 of paper for a lot of attention good I want 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.700
 show you how beautiful you look or 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.040
 it is very nice to see there we have see 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:45.560
 how nice are little friends made through 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:48.350
 of the art of folding origami paper 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:50.570
 creativity and a lot of good imagination 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.700
 let's do it to work, look 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.640
 very well here I already have my square sheet 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:59.260
 let's start folding the paper 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.260
 we doubled to center 1 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:04.370
 after we doubled we doubled the four 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:07.750
 tips to center 2 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:07.750
 marking very well 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.260
 and 4 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.610
 since we bend the four points to 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:18.340
 center look what we're going to do 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:20.890
 little friends we fold perfectly 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.230
 that is very well marked in that doubles 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.420
 so that the figure has form since 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:28.450
 we fold our paper I turn my model 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:31.600
 and I have to double and I have to mark the 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.730
 line of the center I will comment on 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:37.440
 because here I have to give it shape 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:40.600
 to the body of the amiguito bear and double 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:42.760
 unfold and there is the line now what 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.350
 I have to do now and what I have to do 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:46.050
 to do at this moment is to turn towards 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:49.150
 center as if it were to make a kite 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:51.640
 the top line fold it towards the 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:54.670
 center is this line on the side 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.710
 left of your screen we turn towards 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.150
 the center of the middle line 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:01.210
 one 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:03.870
 if it's after we do the same thing 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:07.200
 another side the other line we doubled 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:09.720
 towards the center marking very well 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:13.349
 well the center marking perfectly 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:15.360
 well here it is since we doubled our 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:18.930
 paper what we 're going to do now is what 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:22.200
 next flips a model and doubled this 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:26.110
 point downwards is to say a 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:29.890
 fold of mountain I turn my model 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:32.170
 here I will open opens this side and here 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.510
 reported what I know 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:38.700
 the this is this basic model is called 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.700
 the basic model of the switch fish 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.400
 based on the weight I do the same for the other 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.640
 side 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:49.030
 on the other side marking very well so that 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:51.340
 the figure has form here is because 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:54.480
 we doubled our paper lifts this 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:58.970
 point and raise this point 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:02.210
 I open this side and I open this other side 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.860
 I open this side and already by your side this 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:06.320
 part is going to be the front of the 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.210
 bear this is going to be the back 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:11.510
 I open here and I put these folds here 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:15.019
 look here double meters 1 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:17.290
 I do the same thing on the other side I open meters 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:17.290
 double 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:23.730
 is this way perfect since 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:26.280
 I got the folds here let's do that 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.200
 in the back of the bear he bent 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.440
 above 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.190
 here he marked my role very well and then 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:36.290
 down 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:39.019
 down in this way 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:42.140
 perfect since double this way 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:44.560
 only half fold my half 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.560
 model 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:51.630
 little bit more here is perfect 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.880
 that double by half 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:56.100
 this is going to be the back this is going 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:58.260
 to be the ears and this is going to be what 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:00.150
 is the head of what I have to 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:03.120
 do is pull this part to give 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:06.060
 form to the body of the jaló this part 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.960
 slowly without despairing if I can not 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.800
 do what 

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:12.390
 I open it a little bit and not like that 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:14.610
 look how we look 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:17.330
 in this way marking very well the 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:22.910
 paper so that the figure has a form 

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:22.910
 look, it looks exactly like that 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:27.800
 they have to mark their role very well for 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:31.759
 that the figure has form here we have 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:34.550
 and what is the body of the bear and the 

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:35.990
 opposite in this way now 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:39.020
 what I'm going to do look good 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:41.479
 friends I have to bend the ears of 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:43.430
 I fold them this way up 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:46.100
 one 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:49.070
 and I repeat the same thing on the other side I turn 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:51.590
 my double model like I do the same 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:55.160
 fold as I did the previous one marking 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:57.620
 perfectly good one 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:00.540
 and two see and now what I'm going to do 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:03.840
 immediately think very good friends 

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:06.750
 we already have part the shape of the legs 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:08.730
 of the bear the body the ears here I am going to 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:10.710
 do a fold here I will do 

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:12.420
 activities as this progress is 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:14.490
 very nice here I have to make a 

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:17.120
 fold a fold in and 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:17.120
 outward 

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:27.430
 one and then two here is I'm 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:29.860

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:35.860
 Bear, look, the ears of the bear are gone 

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:39.460
 here has been shaped since my figure 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:42.310
 here I will be a zig zag fold that 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:45.620
 it is the nose the horn of the sovereigns 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:47.270
 one that is very good 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:50.560
 and here what I do is the following 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:53.410
 double points inwards I already have 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:57.169

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:10.430
 here I open a double leg a leg towards 

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:13.610
 forward is that of anti mount is 

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:15.530
 leaving the other side the other
