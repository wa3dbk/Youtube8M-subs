a lot drugs cards how general kim

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:44.149 
a lot drugs cards how general kim
informal<00:02:42.030> one<00:02:42.150> is<00:02:42.299> was<00:02:42.450> working<00:02:42.900> and<00:02:43.079> I<00:02:43.920> have<00:02:44.129> a

00:02:44.149 --> 00:02:44.159 
informal one is was working and I have a

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:45.800 
informal one is was working and I have a
little<00:02:44.519> bit<00:02:44.670> pressured<00:02:44.939> little<00:02:45.480> bit<00:02:45.659> of

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
little bit pressured little bit of

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.380 
little bit pressured little bit of
nervous<00:02:46.500> but<00:02:46.950> then<00:02:47.159> finally<00:02:47.760> I<00:02:47.790> find<00:02:48.180> the

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
nervous but then finally I find the

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.170 
nervous but then finally I find the
solution<00:02:48.840> how<00:02:49.439> to<00:02:49.500> go<00:02:49.799> and<00:02:49.980> I<00:02:50.099> think<00:02:50.400> it's

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
solution how to go and I think it's

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.000 
solution how to go and I think it's
working<00:02:51.420> so<00:02:51.810> next<00:02:52.170> season<00:02:52.470> it<00:02:52.590> will<00:02:52.709> be<00:02:52.860> more

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
working so next season it will be more

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.720 
working so next season it will be more
easy<00:02:53.129> for<00:02:53.220> me<00:02:53.489> and<00:02:54.590> which<00:02:55.590> Grand<00:02:55.890> Prix<00:02:56.099> did<00:02:56.610> you

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
easy for me and which Grand Prix did you

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.729

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
find the most satisfying in your first

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
and to go up against him was challenging

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:28.789 
and to go up against him was challenging
for<00:03:25.139> you<00:03:26.000> if<00:03:27.000> you<00:03:27.239> to<00:03:27.870> mate<00:03:28.079> with<00:03:28.109> robot<00:03:28.349> you

for you if you to mate with robot you

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:30.289 
for you if you to mate with robot you
can<00:03:28.980> to<00:03:29.159> learn<00:03:29.310> anything<00:03:29.430> from<00:03:29.760> him<00:03:30.150> because

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
can to learn anything from him because

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:33.530 
can to learn anything from him because
he<00:03:30.659> always<00:03:30.780> closed<00:03:31.500> person<00:03:31.799> so<00:03:32.730> you<00:03:32.790> just<00:03:32.940> can

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
he always closed person so you just can

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.410 
he always closed person so you just can
watch<00:03:33.989> his<00:03:34.290> data<00:03:34.530> how<00:03:35.400> he's<00:03:35.670> working<00:03:36.060> what<00:03:36.269> he

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
watch his data how he's working what he

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.640 
watch his data how he's working what he
said<00:03:36.629> to<00:03:36.659> engineer<00:03:37.260> and<00:03:37.500> that's<00:03:37.889> it<00:03:38.069> so

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
said to engineer and that's it so

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.839 
said to engineer and that's it so
apparently<00:03:40.650> I<00:03:40.980> didn't<00:03:41.310> learn<00:03:41.459> so<00:03:41.669> much<00:03:41.790> from

00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:41.849 
apparently I didn't learn so much from

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:44.839 
apparently I didn't learn so much from
him<00:03:42.269> but<00:03:42.540> I<00:03:42.780> learned<00:03:43.139> the<00:03:43.889> data<00:03:44.099> how<00:03:44.400> he<00:03:44.459> was

00:03:44.839 --> 00:03:44.849 
him but I learned the data how he was

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:47.930 
him but I learned the data how he was
way<00:03:45.540> of<00:03:45.690> his<00:03:45.930> driving<00:03:46.349> and<00:03:46.560> how<00:03:47.519> he<00:03:47.579> talked

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
way of his driving and how he talked

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.599 
way of his driving and how he talked
with<00:03:48.090> his<00:03:48.299> engineer<00:03:48.780> I<00:03:48.989> think<00:03:49.980> one<00:03:50.099> of<00:03:50.129> the<00:03:50.280> one

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:50.609 
with his engineer I think one of the one

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:52.699 
with his engineer I think one of the one
of<00:03:50.639> the<00:03:50.760> best<00:03:50.910> things<00:03:51.150> about<00:03:51.389> last<00:03:52.199> year<00:03:52.500> was

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
of the best things about last year was

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:55.729 
of the best things about last year was
in<00:03:53.220> Abu<00:03:53.609> Dhabi<00:03:53.720> when<00:03:54.720> he<00:03:54.810> had<00:03:54.959> Fernando<00:03:55.319> Alonso

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
in Abu Dhabi when he had Fernando Alonso

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:58.430 
in Abu Dhabi when he had Fernando Alonso
behind<00:03:56.190> you<00:03:56.370> and<00:03:56.629> he<00:03:57.629> couldn't<00:03:57.870> get<00:03:58.019> past<00:03:58.169> you

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
behind you and he couldn't get past you

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.559 
behind you and he couldn't get past you
and<00:03:59.099> at<00:03:59.220> the<00:03:59.310> end<00:03:59.340> he<00:03:59.609> was<00:03:59.790> shaking<00:04:00.209> his<00:04:00.299> fist

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:00.569 
and at the end he was shaking his fist

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:02.330 
and at the end he was shaking his fist
and<00:04:00.780> waving<00:04:01.139> his<00:04:01.260> head<00:04:01.440> and<00:04:01.650> I<00:04:01.859> thought<00:04:02.280> that

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
and waving his head and I thought that

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.879 
and waving his head and I thought that
was<00:04:02.489> really<00:04:02.699> funny<00:04:02.790> and<00:04:03.260> strange<00:04:04.260> that<00:04:04.680> he

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:04.889 
was really funny and strange that he

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:07.129 
was really funny and strange that he
expected<00:04:05.639> you<00:04:05.819> to<00:04:05.940> get<00:04:06.090> out<00:04:06.180> of<00:04:06.299> the<00:04:06.359> way<00:04:06.510> even

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:07.139 
expected you to get out of the way even

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:09.740 
expected you to get out of the way even
though<00:04:07.260> you<00:04:07.319> were<00:04:07.530> racing<00:04:07.709> him<00:04:08.540> no<00:04:09.540> of<00:04:09.720> course

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
though you were racing him no of course

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.080 
though you were racing him no of course
