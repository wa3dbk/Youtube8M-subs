00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 hello event born on minute tensions 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.609
 today I talk about a game of which you 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.740
 I had already spoken in a couple of years ago in 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.050
 that famous video the toys to bring you 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.120
 on the beach but then for a series of 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.710
 reasons you want because they come out junk want 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.389
 because things are being previewed 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.190
 etc. I never managed to put 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.240
 before the eyes of a real one 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.369
 review 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.720
 so the time to do it spoke to me 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.890
 of errors story cubes a game for one 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.320
 endless players of the duration of 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.260
 about all the minutes you want to 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.960
 errors or connor in Italy thanks to 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.969
 olyphant is a game that creates me 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.739
 all these doubts in the duration and in the 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:44.760
 players numbers because nothing 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:47.100
 let's find out reviews but that 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.430
 slams instructions if I deny them too much 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.079
 time to spend with the reviews you 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.510
 just look a few minutes or not 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.850
 read the regulation consists of three 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.550
 simple steps to launch the nine by 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.829
 look at what faces were obtained 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.110
 and connect all nine data into one 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.700
 story starting with once upon a time 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.430
 we want to give an example 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.720
 let's launch these nine data here 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.970
 I'd say 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.350
 once upon a time there was a little turtle 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.570
 noticed ruin that was a lot 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.850
 enterprising and wanted to see all the 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.560
 world and had decided to see all the 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.090
 world because one day one 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.280
 arrow that was planted in the ground 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.080
 right next to him he said look I have 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.119
 I have traveled far and wide 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.829
 launched from a lot of miles of 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.540
 distance I landed near you and you 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.100
 I can say that the world is beautiful 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.380
 think that there is even a 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.479
 great rainbow to see the 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.740
 then curious turtle started 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.380
 its slow journey 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.460
 he slowly chose a direction and said 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.259
 if I keep going in that 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.259
 sooner or later I will meet a manager 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.509
 rainbow through then a bridge e 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.729
 stop to gaze at the whole river that 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.950
 it flowed below to see the magnificence 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.439
 of water reflecting with the sun 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.790
 and then he saw a big building he didn't have 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.040
 never seen anything like her that 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.630
 he lived in his garden nearby 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.399
 to small rocks a palace 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.860
 very high and also remains there 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:07.110
 stunned and then begins to look 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.429
 above and above he saw land a 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.780
 parachutist 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.549
 this too seemed very strange to me 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.140
 because you had seen birds but 

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:14.670
 the birds wanted straight into the sky 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.439
 nothing going from above to 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.120
 low voluntarily and without 

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:20.069
 squash on the ground 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.079
 nothing to say the turtle was a lot 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:24.269
 happy with his journey he stops a 

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:26.250
 moment to have a fountain and yes 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:28.260
 refreshment to his astonishment from 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.420
 drinking fountain saw all these droplets 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.849
 and through the droplets looking at the 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.709
 sun finally found the rainbow that 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:36.810
 he had suggested his only arrow 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:38.700
 all here as you have seen more than one 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.019
 real game with a winner or 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.780
 however, a real regulation 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:45.060
 it is a gaming experience is a 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.950
 way to stimulate creativity for 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.750
 develop imagination or 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.650
 simply a way to learn to 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.359
 stay together 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.090
 in fact I believe that the imagination there 

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:55.439
 however, creativity should be exercised there 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.150
 they are the ones who say no I am not 

00:02:55.439 --> 00:02:59.340
 able to invent I'm not able to 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.439
 to tell etc. however this is a 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.209
 game that does not have a rhythm does not impose you 

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:04.709
 a victory does not impose a defeat on you 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:06.359
 if you play it with friends it's not 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:07.799
 It must be that you want to go wrong 

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:09.120
 at the bottom of the story someone can 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:11.909
 insert someone you can above all 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:14.639
 help and you will find that the more you play 

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:16.769
 with these cubes you will be faster 

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:18.479
 in finding a connection between them more 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:21.540
 you will eventually be able to decide 

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:23.129
 also the theme a little inspiration and with 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.620
 the cubes go to tell something 

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:27.479
 again with 9 six-sided cubes all 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.879
 different from each other for a total of 54 

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:31.169
 different faces launched each time vi 

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:32.699
 I just let you imagine how many there are 

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:34.560
 combinations that will present themselves 

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:36.750
 in front of you basically you will never have 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.729
 enough if you want to note 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.439
 exercise your imagination there 

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:42.599
 your ability also to speak or to 

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:44.699
 write why not it should be more 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:47.189
 that's enough but if you become a fan 

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:49.859
 as I am or whatever you still want 

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:51.359
 major challenges to report that 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:52.859
 there are also expansions of these 

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:55.799
 it did not remain closed in these little ones 

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:57.389
 auto confections or more teeth open up 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:59.669
 in this way it is inside they are all 

00:03:57.389 --> 00:04:00.659
 including three dice with even here if 

00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:03.540
 in fact different from each other 

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:05.549
 the expansion this rose is enchanted 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.919
 so everything in the kingdom a little fairy with 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:10.169
 fairies etc. we have expansion 

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:11.970
 prehistory with dinosaur vertices e 

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:13.739
 so you can pull out the whole 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:15.430
 prehistory that is in you and finally 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:17.919
 the expansion closed 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:20.500
 based more on the crime stories then 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:22.120
 there are clues like poison and these 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.530
 things here in conclusion I tell you that 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.780
 these closed every now and then he pulled out 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.370
 even just to throw them and watch the 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:29.770
 images to see which associations 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:32.020
 mental pulls my mind out try 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:33.729
 see if a stupid story succeeds one 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:36.280
 in short, an interesting story precisely for 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:36.669
 see to exercise to give food for the 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.680
 mind 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:40.030
 also promises part of the skill of 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.860
 improvisation that I can put 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.750
 in front of the camera can be 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.380
 due to the exercise of these rare 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.060
 store i tunes 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:47.830
 so if you also want to give by 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:50.199
 eat to your brain in one 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:52.030
 very nice and relaxed way vi 

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:54.310
 I recommend these store tunes with 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:56.970
 this finished greets you and I say hello and 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.970
 to the next
