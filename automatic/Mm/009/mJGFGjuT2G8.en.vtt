00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.930 
like that I think I would be kicking
myself<00:02:17.480> forever<00:02:18.080> if<00:02:18.470> I<00:02:18.560> didn't<00:02:18.860> at<00:02:18.920> least<00:02:18.950> give

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
myself forever if I didn't at least give

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:25.390 
myself forever if I didn't at least give
it<00:02:19.970> a<00:02:20.120> try
