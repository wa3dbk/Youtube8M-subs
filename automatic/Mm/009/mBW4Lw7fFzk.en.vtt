00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.340
 Today's videos let's see how to create lightning 

00:00:07.989 --> 00:00:10.989
 I have now created a new document 

00:00:11.649 --> 00:00:17.939
 of discharge 1200 for 800 pixel color rgb resolution 150 pixels per inch 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:19.849
 first of all 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:22.039
 I take the gradient tool 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:27.099
 verifying that you have a black sport in the foreground which color of 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:28.859
 White background 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.169
 I'm going to trace 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:34.800
 apply the shading supreme document 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.590
 affixed. varone - filter at the entry render selects clouds indifference 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.130
 now in the image menu 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:45.030
 I go 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.330
 under the heading adjustments 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.040
 to select 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.870
 levels 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:51.890
 or 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:57.910
 with the shortcut keyboard command allied against control l for pc 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:01.270
 here I have to make sure of 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:02.159
 remove 

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:03.350
 color 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.260
 let's say gray 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.010
 send me lightning around 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.560
 to counter it 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:10.880
 more and more 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:16.100
 so I go to take the cursor of lights that on the right I drag it 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.080
 to 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.080
 left 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:22.610
 Now 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.180
 I'm going to take the mid-tone cursor 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.040
 I also move it slightly to the left 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:34.950
 I click ok 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.920
 now go not even imagine 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.370
 adjustments 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:42.540
 fly selected inverts also uses a keyboard shortcut 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.540
 I command or against links for PC 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:47.210
 then 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.480
 I take the brush tool 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.480
 set controlled by normal 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:55.370
 I hold down 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:57.070
 option o 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:58.590
 high for PC 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.479
 and as you can see the dropper will appear 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:04.280
 to go and sample the background color 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.610
 which of course a black 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.690
 so I make a click 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.569
 per championship if you don't have one 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:13.259
 this color as a foreground color 

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:14.989
 and coli brush 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:18.419
 I'm going to correct any 

00:02:18.419 --> 00:02:21.159
 anomaly 

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:23.359
 then I take off 

00:02:23.359 --> 00:02:25.279
 the gray 

00:02:25.279 --> 00:02:27.360
 around the blazing messina 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.360
 forklift 

00:02:37.399 --> 00:02:39.969
 very well now this lightning 

00:02:39.969 --> 00:02:41.729
 I will go and insert it 

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:47.429
 inside a Chioggia image opened then it grain inside the 

00:02:47.429 --> 00:02:50.499
 document drag 

00:02:50.499 --> 00:02:53.389
 that I go on the label 

00:02:53.389 --> 00:02:55.249
 new hotmail document 

00:02:55.249 --> 00:02:57.949
 that I opened then I move 

00:02:57.949 --> 00:03:01.519
 in the middle of the release document as they say 

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:04.079
 I copied 

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:07.009
 the document where the lightning was created 

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:08.619
 try and select 

00:03:08.619 --> 00:03:11.309
 in casting methods 

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:13.479
 the discoloration voice 

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:17.339
 now with the key combination command to control t 

00:03:17.339 --> 00:03:20.589
 activate the free transformation and then go 

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:22.459
 Amber 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:25.459
 change to rootare 

00:03:26.619 --> 00:03:29.619
 to better position your lightning 

00:03:31.249 --> 00:03:35.340
 when you are satisfied with the result, press enter to confirm 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:37.179
 now padua 

00:03:37.179 --> 00:03:39.029
 delete the parts 

00:03:39.029 --> 00:03:41.549
 in excess of lightning 15 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:43.469
 selecting the level 

00:03:43.469 --> 00:03:46.659
 just lightning click on the add mask button 

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:49.769
 level 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:54.499
 I go again to learn the brush always set as the first color 

00:03:54.499 --> 00:03:56.149
 black piano 

00:03:56.149 --> 00:03:57.339
 and I go 

00:03:57.339 --> 00:04:00.539
 to mask 

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:03.539
 the area is that I don't care 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:07.459
 I love starting lightning 

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:11.609
 inside a cloud and go after this madman 

00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:14.709
 done 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:16.969
 artificial lightning 

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:19.969
 in this case 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:24.090
 inside the photo also a body of water 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:28.990
 for example, I can create the reflection so it dragged my level 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:31.930
 of lightning in the south add me level 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:35.430
 between new level but then duplicated lightning level 

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:38.699
 last below 

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:39.789
 manual - 

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:40.939
 modification 

00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:42.800
 the item transformat 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.759
 vertical reports 

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:46.550
 and dragged 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:48.749
 holding down the key 

00:04:48.749 --> 00:04:51.090
 upper case of the keyboard 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:54.150
 the Lightning 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:56.800
 where I think that 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.800
 it should happen 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.520
 so I lower the opacity 

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:08.199
 of the level 

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:13.849
 and I go to apply a filter not even filter 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.319
 at the item distortion select 

00:05:17.319 --> 00:05:20.319
 ocean ripple 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:24.430
 that I apply a slight ripple 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:28.490
 after you decide how to change this option click ok 

00:05:29.339 --> 00:05:31.370
 and that's it 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:33.889
 now experiments 

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:36.280
 for the moment all the salute to the next one
