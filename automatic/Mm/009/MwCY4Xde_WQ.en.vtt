00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:59.540 

yeah<00:01:47.040> there's<00:01:47.310> there<00:01:47.670> just<00:01:47.970> enough<00:01:58.370> and<00:01:59.370> this

00:01:59.540 --> 00:01:59.550 
yeah there's there just enough and this

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:01.330 
yeah there's there just enough and this
is<00:01:59.700> what<00:01:59.850> happens<00:02:00.150> if<00:02:00.330> she<00:02:00.450> pulled<00:02:00.720> down<00:02:00.960> there

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
is what happens if she pulled down there

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:10.969 
is what happens if she pulled down there
it<00:02:02.340> basically<00:02:02.580> stuck<00:02:03.510> in<00:02:05.540> the<00:02:06.540> map<00:02:09.680> changes<00:02:10.680> to

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
it basically stuck in the map changes to

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:32.170 
it basically stuck in the map changes to
do<00:02:11.130> this

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.860

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
so yeah then get trapped down the edge

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.860 
so yeah then get trapped down the edge
of<00:02:36.930> the<00:02:37.290> world<00:02:38.330> because<00:02:39.330> you<00:02:39.360> will<00:02:39.600> have<00:02:39.630> to
