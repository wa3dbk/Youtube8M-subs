00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:40.680
 the hours and two to start a 21 of 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:44.420
 October 1981 thanks to the idea of ​​my 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:48.059
 dad takes the drone is 82 years old and 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:50.970
 after a lifetime of being employed 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:53.760
 decided to start his own business and with 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:56.640
 many limitations formed what was 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.280
 back then I wanted the sport 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.650
 that was the initial name my dad was from 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.660
 those old heredianos of heart and 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:05.820
 so that's why he put the sport 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.500
 because he always talked about soccer and 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.840
 obviously he had many liguistas and 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.080
 many to precise to annoy it and 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.940
 then he said it was a 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.460
 technique to get customers to the 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:20.270
 business why he put the sports one was 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:25.290
 something very, very, very, very small, wooden 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:28.620
 in really very poor conditions 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:31.960
 somehow you had to start it 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:34.540
 and that says that can that way why 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.970
 I believe that when you never do 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:40.380
 I saw those things is when you value most 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:43.150
 day after day and nowadays because after 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:46.410
 32 years old 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.410
 what has changed the business 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:00.690
 after doing October 21 , 1981 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:04.430
 and my brother and I had to come 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:07.290
 as they say to agree to help you because 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:11.070
 he told us how fast he was going to 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:14.790
 start to have already some customers here 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:16.740
 in greece it was a sauce because it's a 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.830
 very consolidated company that has more than 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:22.170
 100 years of existence of a sauce or a cola 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:25.050
 and a sausage or a touch in the 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.760
 sports that were meat cakes that 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:30.000
 we still make them are homemade 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:32.850
 they take out tacos that were tiny because 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.280
 no factory made the tortilla 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:37.860
 big regardless if it was from 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.930
 corn wheat and sausages that was 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.060
 our great menu infinite thanks 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:45.690
 goodbye the business was growing very 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:48.120
 fast and my dad had it five years of 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.100
 that way until like a year later 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.819
 we managed to convince him that he had his 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:55.790
 first employee your first worker 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:59.060
 and then he realized that yes he 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:01.609
 not to basso and then one came after 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.620
 came two after three days the five 

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:05.810
 years my brother and I decided to buy him 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.959
 the business because I was already a little 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.489
 tired and it was a lot of work for him and 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:12.739
 then the business changed the 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:14.510
 sportsman breathes with his life because two 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:17.569
 lives two lives the nickname of 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:20.900
 us from my brother and me and the people 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:25.060
 started to deduce let's go where we 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.060
 ask and did not say let's go to the sports 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:37.850
 we my sister and I decided how 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:40.670
 says to get into debt with the idea of ​​continuing 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:43.040
 growing from continuing to bring day to day 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:45.530
 more customer business to follow 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.360
 expanding so that the client does not leave 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:50.140
 to another place but sits in a 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:53.900
 place each day more comfortable as much as possible 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:57.560
 and so that way was like 78 years 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:04:02.030
 then we could grow a little bit and 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:04.790
 then 78 years later another little bit more and 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:07.989
 now last year do it the way 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:07.989
 that is there today 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:13.730
 i 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:16.940
 the fact of growing and of continuing to aspire 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:19.640
 more gave us the idea of having another 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:22.760
 local more and it was when the idea of 

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:25.760
 it became the way in greece and it was a challenge 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:27.860
 very important, not because the 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:30.230
 transnational companies that someday had to 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:32.660
 reach Greece and that was such an impact 

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:35.750
 a shock that will happen we will have 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:39.200
 that close we are going to love we arrived 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:42.710
 we waited a year to see what happened and 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:46.540
 the business continued exactly the same 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:46.540
 it reduced sales for nothing 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:05:00.860
 the names of our menu do not invent 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:04.670
 the customers there are super anecdotes 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:09.170
 funny that one day came more feral 

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:11.300
 jean and brings him a Greek a few days to 

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:13.490
 your house of those exchanges that do 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:15.410
 the boy brings him to two pyre and the 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:17.060
 man delighted with the food of the 

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:20.360
 pirates when there were little 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:23.450
 cymbals not 156 only and he wanted 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:25.400
 try something totally different than him 

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:27.500
 I did not know was that there was never 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:30.530
 seen and we told him that there was 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:34.130
 sausage at the time it occurred to 

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:37.670
 he had not thought of anyone saying ok 

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:39.650
 in that little ball of the pib I want that 

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:41.900
 put the tacos that I gave me take the 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:43.760
 sausage and put the sausage and 

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:46.160
 then people were coming to me 

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:47.600
 ask him he did not know how to ask 

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:50.090
 they told me they are doing a 

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:52.700
 rooster with sausage with taco so yes 

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:55.100
 yes we do it and then this 

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:57.950
 boy after three months here in 

00:05:55.100 --> 00:06:00.860
 greece ate I do not know how long it lasts 

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:03.130
 and then says this rooster has to 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:05.900
 be on the menu and it will be called 

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:08.450
 Kangaroo because I'm from Australia like that 

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:11.360
 how that has been appearing 

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:13.610
 different dishes the mixtures between 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.290
 the different dishes and the same 

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:17.690
 client is the one who has invented his 

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:20.510
 own name and we like him 

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:23.020
 we have given ball and we are going for 18 

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:23.020
 saucers 

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:38.409
 look at thinking about satisfaction about 

00:06:35.289 --> 00:06:40.719
 aspires and really 

00:06:38.409 --> 00:06:43.809
 I believe that what satisfies me the most is 

00:06:40.719 --> 00:06:47.919
 remember the conditions in which I 

00:06:43.809 --> 00:06:50.249
 I was 32 years ago and my family and 

00:06:47.919 --> 00:06:54.429
 conditions that today that today 

00:06:50.249 --> 00:06:56.439
 we are seeing the business or see the 29 

00:06:54.429 --> 00:06:58.899
 families that we depend on this business 

00:06:56.439 --> 00:07:00.519
 know that we have 6 motorized in 

00:06:58.899 --> 00:07:05.369
 express and that can not cope with 

00:07:00.519 --> 00:07:08.979
 Nights see people as they stand in line 

00:07:05.369 --> 00:07:11.559
 having the transnationals and 

00:07:08.979 --> 00:07:13.869
 I sit around at a table in the 

00:07:11.559 --> 00:07:16.869
 Mobile over there really no other than just 

00:07:13.869 --> 00:07:20.169
 visualize nothing else where people leave 

00:07:16.869 --> 00:07:23.289
 of cinema and they do so and most of the 

00:07:20.169 --> 00:07:26.199
 people come back to see all of them all and see 

00:07:23.289 --> 00:07:29.619
 that there are people who are going to stand in line where 

00:07:26.199 --> 00:07:31.739
 all nationals are doing that in 

00:07:29.619 --> 00:07:31.739
 reality 

00:07:31.969 --> 00:07:35.169
 priceless
