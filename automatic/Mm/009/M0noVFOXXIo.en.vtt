I'd<00:00:00.269> weld<00:00:00.510> a<00:00:00.539> bunch<00:00:00.690> of<00:00:00.810> robots<00:00:01.170> for

00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:01.410 
I'd weld a bunch of robots for

Film<00:00:03.659> School<00:00:03.899> today<00:00:04.470> I'm<00:00:04.740> going<00:00:04.859> to<00:00:04.950> show<00:00:05.069> you

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
Film School today I'm going to show you

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.909 
Film School today I'm going to show you
how<00:00:05.220> to<00:00:05.310> build<00:00:05.430> this<00:00:05.819> one<00:00:06.540> that<00:00:07.350> I<00:00:07.379> never

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
how to build this one that I never

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:09.980 
how to build this one that I never
actually<00:00:08.220> named<00:00:08.970> so<00:00:09.450> I<00:00:09.480> don't<00:00:09.660> really<00:00:09.719> have<00:00:09.960> a

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
actually named so I don't really have a

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.200 
actually named so I don't really have a
real<00:00:10.170> plan<00:00:10.410> for<00:00:10.650> this<00:00:10.740> robot<00:00:11.130> basically<00:00:11.460> the

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
real plan for this robot basically the

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.289 
real plan for this robot basically the
storylines<00:00:12.780> called<00:00:13.200> for<00:00:13.679> a<00:00:13.710> robot<00:00:14.490> that<00:00:14.910> hung

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
storylines called for a robot that hung

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.439 
storylines called for a robot that hung
up<00:00:15.540> on<00:00:15.809> a<00:00:15.839> rack<00:00:16.139> in<00:00:16.470> the<00:00:16.619> background<00:00:17.160> and<00:00:17.490> could

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
up on a rack in the background and could

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.720 
up on a rack in the background and could
be<00:00:18.630> positioned<00:00:19.470> to<00:00:19.680> sit<00:00:19.920> on<00:00:19.949> a<00:00:20.100> chair<00:00:20.189> so<00:00:20.670> I

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
be positioned to sit on a chair so I

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.029 
be positioned to sit on a chair so I
built<00:00:20.910> this<00:00:20.970> one<00:00:21.150> out<00:00:21.300> of<00:00:21.330> foam<00:00:21.600> and<00:00:21.900> PVC<00:00:22.650> pipe

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039

I<00:00:38.309> made<00:00:38.460> most<00:00:38.610> this<00:00:38.820> out<00:00:39.030> of<00:00:39.210> Danny<00:00:39.570> VA<00:00:39.899> phones

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
I made most this out of Danny VA phones

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.260 
I made most this out of Danny VA phones
easier<00:00:40.590> to<00:00:40.710> cut<00:00:40.920> and<00:00:41.100> really<00:00:41.700> it's<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:42.059> kind

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
easier to cut and really it's the kind

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.790 
easier to cut and really it's the kind
of<00:00:42.360> foam<00:00:42.600> that<00:00:42.780> you<00:00:42.840> want<00:00:43.050> to<00:00:43.140> use<00:00:43.350> if<00:00:43.680> you're

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
of foam that you want to use if you're

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.319 
of foam that you want to use if you're
going<00:00:43.950> to<00:00:44.040> be<00:00:44.129> dishing<00:00:44.460> dishing<00:00:45.120> is<00:00:45.239> the

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
going to be dishing dishing is the

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.080 
going to be dishing dishing is the
process<00:00:45.870> of<00:00:46.140> cutting<00:00:47.039> a<00:00:47.219> circle<00:00:47.430> out<00:00:47.700> of<00:00:47.760> foam

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
process of cutting a circle out of foam

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.850 
process of cutting a circle out of foam
heating<00:00:48.690> it<00:00:48.780> up<00:00:48.899> with<00:00:49.050> your<00:00:49.140> heat<00:00:49.350> gun<00:00:49.620> and

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
heating it up with your heat gun and

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.340 
heating it up with your heat gun and
then<00:00:50.190> pressing<00:00:50.550> it<00:00:50.820> into<00:00:51.000> a<00:00:51.149> bowl<00:00:51.480> until<00:00:52.140> the

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
then pressing it into a bowl until the

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.290 
then pressing it into a bowl until the
heat<00:00:52.590> dissipates<00:00:53.160> and<00:00:53.460> it<00:00:53.610> can<00:00:53.760> retain<00:00:54.059> its

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
heat dissipates and it can retain its

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.490 
heat dissipates and it can retain its
shape<00:00:54.510> I<00:00:54.690> do<00:00:54.750> this<00:00:54.899> a<00:00:54.960> bunch<00:00:55.110> of<00:00:55.199> times<00:00:55.379> to

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
shape I do this a bunch of times to

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.450 
shape I do this a bunch of times to
create<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.129> shoulders<00:00:56.640> hips<00:00:57.390> feet<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:58.559> part

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
create the shoulders hips feet and part

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.369 
create the shoulders hips feet and part
of<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.609> head<00:00:59.850> of<00:01:00.090> this<00:01:00.239> robot<00:01:00.480> again<00:01:01.020> I<00:01:01.079> didn't

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
of the head of this robot again I didn't

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.139 
of the head of this robot again I didn't
really<00:01:01.440> do<00:01:01.649> any<00:01:01.829> planning<00:01:02.309> or<00:01:02.399> measurements<00:01:03.000> I

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
really do any planning or measurements I

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.969 
really do any planning or measurements I
just<00:01:03.359> used<00:01:03.600> a<00:01:03.750> paint<00:01:03.960> can<00:01:04.170> lid<00:01:04.470> for<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.739> bowls

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
just used a paint can lid for the bowls

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.679 
just used a paint can lid for the bowls
just<00:01:05.159> a<00:01:05.369> measuring<00:01:05.729> here<00:01:06.090> but<00:01:06.299> I<00:01:06.360> really<00:01:06.420> know

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
just a measuring here but I really know

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.350 
just a measuring here but I really know
what<00:01:06.720> I<00:01:06.869> was<00:01:07.049> doing<00:01:07.530> like<00:01:08.220> a<00:01:08.280> K<00:01:08.729> gonna<00:01:09.119> make<00:01:09.330> a

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
what I was doing like a K gonna make a

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.530 
what I was doing like a K gonna make a
torso<00:01:10.020> portion<00:01:10.860> so<00:01:11.280> let's<00:01:11.549> cut<00:01:11.760> out<00:01:11.909> this<00:01:12.150> part

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
torso portion so let's cut out this part

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.469 
torso portion so let's cut out this part
and<00:01:12.869> then<00:01:12.990> I'll<00:01:13.409> cut<00:01:13.950> a<00:01:14.220> slot<00:01:14.670> in<00:01:14.909> here<00:01:15.210> so<00:01:15.360> that

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
and then I'll cut a slot in here so that

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.050 
and then I'll cut a slot in here so that
I<00:01:15.540> can<00:01:15.600> glue<00:01:16.380> it<00:01:16.530> together<00:01:16.710> and<00:01:17.280> I<00:01:17.640> did<00:01:17.820> that

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
I can glue it together and I did that

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.640 
I can glue it together and I did that
and<00:01:18.299> then<00:01:18.509> curve<00:01:18.840> it<00:01:18.960> over<00:01:19.290> and<00:01:19.409> make<00:01:19.560> the

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
and then curve it over and make the

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.030 
and then curve it over and make the
torso<00:01:19.950> my<00:01:20.520> classmate<00:01:21.119> broke<00:01:21.479> his<00:01:21.659> headphones

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.040 
torso my classmate broke his headphones

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.609 
torso my classmate broke his headphones
accident<00:01:23.040> so<00:01:23.340> that<00:01:23.640> became<00:01:24.030> a<00:01:24.299> chest<00:01:24.960> piece<00:01:25.229> on

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
accident so that became a chest piece on

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.630 
accident so that became a chest piece on
the<00:01:25.830> robot<00:01:27.710> yeah

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
the robot yeah

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.460 
the robot yeah
oh<00:01:32.000> yeah<00:01:33.000> so<00:01:33.240> again<00:01:33.450> I<00:01:33.479> didn't<00:01:33.659> really<00:01:33.840> plan<00:01:34.110> I

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
oh yeah so again I didn't really plan I

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.710 
oh yeah so again I didn't really plan I
kind<00:01:34.680> of<00:01:34.710> just<00:01:34.890> cut<00:01:35.220> random<00:01:35.760> pieces<00:01:36.270> I<00:01:36.510> cut

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
kind of just cut random pieces I cut

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.870 
kind of just cut random pieces I cut
lengths<00:01:37.140> of<00:01:37.260> PVC<00:01:37.770> for<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.070> arms<00:01:38.460> cutting

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
lengths of PVC for the arms cutting

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.060 
lengths of PVC for the arms cutting
circles<00:01:39.060> of<00:01:39.330> foam<00:01:39.510> for<00:01:39.540> joints<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.500> spine<00:01:40.800> is

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
circles of foam for joints the spine is

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.070 
circles of foam for joints the spine is
a<00:01:41.100> bunch<00:01:41.310> of<00:01:41.369> little<00:01:41.490> pieces<00:01:41.729> of<00:01:41.940> PVC<00:01:42.270> if<00:01:42.900> one

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.080 
a bunch of little pieces of PVC if one

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.410 
a bunch of little pieces of PVC if one
of<00:01:43.170> those<00:01:43.290> end<00:01:43.770> pieces<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.580> puzzle<00:01:44.760> you<00:01:45.300> know

how<00:01:45.540> you<00:01:45.630> when<00:01:45.930> you<00:01:45.990> buy<00:01:46.140> Evie<00:01:46.530> a<00:01:46.560> foam<00:01:46.890> it<00:01:47.070> has

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:47.190 
how you when you buy Evie a foam it has

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.430 
how you when you buy Evie a foam it has
these<00:01:47.400> long<00:01:47.700> strips<00:01:48.240> on<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.479> edges<00:01:49.050> that<00:01:49.290> you

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:49.440 
these long strips on the edges that you

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.940 
these long strips on the edges that you
tear<00:01:49.710> off

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
tear off

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.520 
tear off
well<00:01:50.700> I<00:01:50.729> cut<00:01:51.210> off<00:01:51.330> all<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.570> puzzle<00:01:51.869> pieces<00:01:51.900> and

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
well I cut off all the puzzle pieces and

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.640 
well I cut off all the puzzle pieces and
threaded<00:01:53.369> a<00:01:53.550> bunch<00:01:53.729> of<00:01:53.820> PVC<00:01:54.030> pieces<00:01:54.810> across<00:01:55.350> it

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:55.650 
threaded a bunch of PVC pieces across it

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.350 
threaded a bunch of PVC pieces across it
to<00:01:55.740> make<00:01:55.890> a<00:01:55.920> spine<00:01:56.280> and<00:01:56.610> I<00:01:56.700> sort<00:01:56.909> of<00:01:57.000> built<00:01:57.240> the

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
to make a spine and I sort of built the

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.570 
to make a spine and I sort of built the
robot<00:01:57.720> out<00:01:57.930> from<00:01:58.470> there<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.979> top<00:01:59.159> of<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.400> head

robot out from there the top of the head

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.520 
robot out from there the top of the head
is<00:01:59.700> one<00:01:59.850> of<00:01:59.909> those<00:02:00.000> dished<00:02:00.270> foam<00:02:00.659> pieces<00:02:01.020> it

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
is one of those dished foam pieces it

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.109 
is one of those dished foam pieces it
has<00:02:01.710> holes<00:02:02.160> in<00:02:02.310> the<00:02:02.399> side<00:02:02.610> so<00:02:02.820> that<00:02:02.850> I<00:02:02.940> could

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
has holes in the side so that I could

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.210 
has holes in the side so that I could
run<00:02:03.300> chains<00:02:03.660> through<00:02:03.960> it<00:02:04.080> it's<00:02:04.320> hollow<00:02:04.710> and<00:02:05.160> I

sponge brush to paint the glue on you

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.670 
sponge brush to paint the glue on you
let<00:02:27.269> it<00:02:27.390> dry<00:02:27.630> then<00:02:27.989> you<00:02:28.080> paint<00:02:28.260> on<00:02:28.410> another

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680

something<00:02:31.019> that<00:02:31.110> you<00:02:31.170> can<00:02:31.290> actually<00:02:31.650> paint<00:02:31.890> on

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
something that you can actually paint on

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:33.710 
something that you can actually paint on
basically<00:02:32.430> what<00:02:32.640> I<00:02:32.670> just<00:02:32.880> did<00:02:33.030> is<00:02:33.209> a<00:02:33.239> really

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
basically what I just did is a really

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.380 
basically what I just did is a really
uneven<00:02:34.380> silver<00:02:35.310> coat<00:02:35.579> it<00:02:35.850> create<00:02:36.120> all<00:02:36.239> these

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
uneven silver coat it create all these

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.090 
uneven silver coat it create all these
streak<00:02:36.840> and<00:02:36.989> look<00:02:37.200> like<00:02:37.380> actual<00:02:37.829> metal

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
streak and look like actual metal

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.400 
streak and look like actual metal
additionally<00:02:38.880> to<00:02:39.120> help<00:02:39.329> sell<00:02:39.660> the<00:02:39.840> metal<00:02:40.019> I

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
additionally to help sell the metal I

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:41.479 
additionally to help sell the metal I
covered<00:02:40.769> up<00:02:40.829> some<00:02:41.070> of<00:02:41.130> the<00:02:41.190> more<00:02:41.310> obvious

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
covered up some of the more obvious

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:44.090 
covered up some of the more obvious
scenes<00:02:42.180> with<00:02:42.690> a<00:02:42.720> solid<00:02:43.230> line<00:02:43.440> of<00:02:43.680> hot<00:02:43.860> glue

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
scenes with a solid line of hot glue

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.789 
scenes with a solid line of hot glue
this<00:02:44.579> is<00:02:44.760> incredibly<00:02:45.750> wasteful<00:02:46.320> if<00:02:46.560> you<00:02:46.709> have

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:46.799 
this is incredibly wasteful if you have

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:48.229 
this is incredibly wasteful if you have
a<00:02:46.829> tight<00:02:47.100> budget<00:02:47.549> and<00:02:47.610> you're<00:02:47.760> using<00:02:47.910> hot<00:02:48.209> glue

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
a tight budget and you're using hot glue

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:50.600 
a tight budget and you're using hot glue
but<00:02:48.930> it'll<00:02:49.110> look<00:02:49.290> like<00:02:49.500> a<00:02:49.560> weld<00:02:49.920> line<00:02:50.220> if<00:02:50.489> you

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
but it'll look like a weld line if you

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.430 
but it'll look like a weld line if you
do<00:02:50.790> it<00:02:50.940> right<00:02:51.120> and<00:02:51.390> it<00:02:51.450> worked<00:02:51.660> because<00:02:51.840> most

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
do it right and it worked because most

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.500 
do it right and it worked because most
of<00:02:52.560> the<00:02:52.680> actors<00:02:53.130> you<00:02:53.310> saw<00:02:53.549> it<00:02:53.760> thought<00:02:54.239> it<00:02:54.390> was

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
of the actors you saw it thought it was

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.360 
of the actors you saw it thought it was
actual<00:02:54.870> metal<00:02:55.260> and<00:02:55.440> then<00:02:55.709> we<00:02:55.799> just<00:02:56.010> brought<00:02:56.190> it

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
actual metal and then we just brought it

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.850 
actual metal and then we just brought it
around<00:02:56.459> to<00:02:57.090> the<00:02:57.630> other<00:02:57.720> classmates<00:02:58.110> to<00:02:58.620> show

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
around to the other classmates to show

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:04.660 
around to the other classmates to show
my<00:02:59.340> epic<00:02:59.730> robot<00:03:00.239> building<00:03:00.660> skills

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:14.380 

ah<00:03:09.370> I<00:03:10.370> see<00:03:11.270> how<00:03:11.420> it<00:03:11.599> is<00:03:12.790> so<00:03:13.790> good<00:03:13.970> this<00:03:14.090> to<00:03:14.239> look

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
ah I see how it is so good this to look

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.050 
ah I see how it is so good this to look
really<00:03:14.720> slapped<00:03:15.410> together<00:03:15.830> and<00:03:16.250> barely

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
really slapped together and barely

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.540 
really slapped together and barely
functional<00:03:17.720> but<00:03:17.900> I'm<00:03:17.989> surprised<00:03:18.410> cuz<00:03:18.830> it<00:03:19.280> held

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:19.550 
functional but I'm surprised cuz it held

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:22.420 
functional but I'm surprised cuz it held
up<00:03:19.760> all<00:03:20.180> week<00:03:20.510> like<00:03:21.140> 14-hour<00:03:21.860> days<00:03:22.160> of

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
up all week like 14-hour days of

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.160 
up all week like 14-hour days of
shooting<00:03:22.700> I<00:03:23.000> mean<00:03:23.270> one<00:03:23.390> of<00:03:23.420> the<00:03:23.540> arms<00:03:23.870> fell<00:03:24.140> off

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
shooting I mean one of the arms fell off

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.250 
shooting I mean one of the arms fell off
but<00:03:25.060> literally<00:03:26.060> just<00:03:26.270> popped<00:03:26.660> it<00:03:26.870> back<00:03:26.900> in

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
but literally just popped it back in

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:28.570 
but literally just popped it back in
