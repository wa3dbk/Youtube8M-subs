00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
predict this this format but I predicted

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.229 
predict this this format but I predicted
that<00:03:41.560> last<00:03:41.950> format<00:03:42.489> because<00:03:42.940> it<00:03:43.000> was<00:03:43.150> like

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239 
that last format because it was like

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:45.660 
that last format because it was like
heroes<00:03:43.780> as<00:03:43.989> a<00:03:44.019> dead<00:03:44.320> deck<00:03:44.590> and<00:03:44.829> it<00:03:45.459> would

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
heroes as a dead deck and it would

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.849 
heroes as a dead deck and it would
promote<00:03:45.880> noble<00:03:46.630> knights<00:03:46.840> so<00:03:47.290> I<00:03:47.320> was<00:03:47.500> like<00:03:47.620> you

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:42.150 
other than that I mean I think they're
trying<00:04:41.020> to<00:04:41.050> promote<00:04:41.260> noble<00:04:41.740> knights<00:04:41.889> a<00:04:42.010> bit

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:42.160 
trying to promote noble knights a bit

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.260 
trying to promote noble knights a bit
more<00:04:42.310> and<00:04:42.430> I<00:04:42.460> think<00:04:42.490> that<00:04:42.790> that's<00:04:42.970> why<00:04:43.120> they

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
more and I think that that's why they

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:44.700 
more and I think that that's why they
pushed<00:04:43.479> it<00:04:43.630> I<00:04:43.780> mean<00:04:43.960> that's<00:04:44.110> why<00:04:44.229> I<00:04:44.260> predicted

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
pushed it I mean that's why I predicted

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:46.770 
pushed it I mean that's why I predicted
that<00:04:44.770> last<00:04:45.160> format<00:04:45.520> and<00:04:45.790> the<00:04:46.060> last<00:04:46.270> two<00:04:46.479> cards

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:46.780 
that last format and the last two cards

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:48.659 
that last format and the last two cards
to<00:04:46.870> get<00:04:46.960> semi<00:04:47.290> limited<00:04:47.620> which<00:04:47.770> I<00:04:47.919> called<00:04:48.250> both

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:48.669 
to get semi limited which I called both

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:51.810 
to get semi limited which I called both
of<00:04:48.880> them<00:04:49.030> Mir<00:04:49.720> wasn't<00:04:50.139> deep<00:04:50.260> risen<00:04:50.560> I<00:04:50.820> can't

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:51.820 
of them Mir wasn't deep risen I can't

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:53.670 
of them Mir wasn't deep risen I can't
see<00:04:51.940> many<00:04:52.120> people<00:04:52.300> using<00:04:52.840> three<00:04:53.050> Mir<00:04:53.229> forces

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680
