up with a smart robot based automation

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.170 
up with a smart robot based automation
solution<00:02:24.420> that<00:02:24.720> is<00:02:24.870> both<00:02:25.140> IOT<00:02:26.040> and<00:02:26.250> Industry

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
solution that is both IOT and Industry

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.900 
solution that is both IOT and Industry
four<00:02:27.420> point<00:02:27.690> already<00:02:28.110> the<00:02:28.829> solution<00:02:29.370> enables
