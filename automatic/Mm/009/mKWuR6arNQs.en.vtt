we've<00:03:39.580> been<00:03:39.670> crying<00:03:39.970> after<00:03:40.180> a<00:03:40.300> few<00:03:40.510> years<00:03:40.540> for

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:41.020 
we've been crying after a few years for

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:45.810 
we've been crying after a few years for
this<00:03:41.220> back-to-back<00:03:42.390> event<00:03:43.390> format<00:03:44.250> and<00:03:45.250> I

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:45.820 
this back-to-back event format and I

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:47.220 
this back-to-back event format and I
personally<00:03:46.150> think<00:03:46.330> definitely<00:03:46.570> there<00:03:46.960> is<00:03:47.200> a

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
personally think definitely there is a

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.680 
personally think definitely there is a
there's<00:03:47.860> room<00:03:48.040> or<00:03:48.310> we<00:03:48.820> could<00:03:49.000> have<00:03:49.150> a<00:03:49.180> full

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
there's room or we could have a full

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:51.900 
there's room or we could have a full
strongly<00:03:50.080> slept<00:03:50.320> or<00:03:50.470> tool<00:03:50.620> that<00:03:51.190> is<00:03:51.340> world

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 
strongly slept or tool that is world

00:03:51.910 --> 00:04:05.450 
strongly slept or tool that is world
ranking<00:03:52.450> snowboard<00:03:52.810> to<00:03:52.900> arrange

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:05.460 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:12.470 

I<00:04:10.040> think<00:04:11.040> there's<00:04:11.190> a<00:04:11.280> lot<00:04:11.520> of<00:04:11.550> people<00:04:12.090> that

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
I think there's a lot of people that

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.060 
I think there's a lot of people that
still<00:04:13.020> don't<00:04:13.200> even<00:04:13.350> know<00:04:13.530> there's<00:04:13.800> snow<00:04:14.040> in

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:14.070 
still don't even know there's snow in

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:17.510 
still don't even know there's snow in
Australia<00:04:14.630> so<00:04:15.630> as<00:04:15.990> a<00:04:16.050> foreigner<00:04:16.950> who<00:04:17.280> was
