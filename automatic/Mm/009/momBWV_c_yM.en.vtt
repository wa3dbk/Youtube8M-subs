00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.130 
what the idea was and so we built some
rails<00:01:47.280> on<00:01:47.459> top<00:01:47.640> of<00:01:47.789> the<00:01:47.850> boats<00:01:48.060> and<00:01:48.360> we're

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.410 
months ago and we designed you know the
rails<00:02:10.990> over<00:02:11.290> the<00:02:11.590> boats<00:02:11.800> and<00:02:12.150> you<00:02:13.150> know<00:02:13.240> just

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
rails over the boats and you know just

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:14.880
