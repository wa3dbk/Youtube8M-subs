00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.390
 all right 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.750
 ah 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.210
 from ancient times the ancient 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.399
 traditions of the world have come 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.320
 engineering various arts to choose 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:41.770
 the best places to get health 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.940
 prosperity and spiritual transcendence 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:46.670
 arts emerged from a wisdom 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.769
 ancestral founded on experiences and 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.350
 knowledge accumulated over thousands 

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:53.089
 of years of observing the world some 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.829
 of these arts continue to be very 

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:56.480
 popular today as is the 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:58.610
 case of the vast Indian disaster and for 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.140
 Of course Chinese feng shui is 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:02.510
 simply to find our place 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.309
 in the world and for what we know is something 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.920
 that we do all the organisms of the 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:09.860
 planet before locating a settlement 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.619
 human tent hut or house is vital 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.580
 importance knowing the typology 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:15.619
 bioenergetics of the area where it is going to 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.360
 make the settlement the correct 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:19.490
 choice of place is a factor that goes to 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.740
 directly influence the quality of 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.439
 Rest and the health of people 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.030
 who will live in that place in the world 

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:27.680
 from our origins we have followed 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.930
 our own instinct to find 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.310
 our perfect place or at least we have 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.259
 known to take advantage of instinct and 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.330
 nature of other travel companions 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:37.250
 the animals and plants with which 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.210
 we share habitat are a fabulous 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.630
 indicator for 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:43.520
 the good place of the bad place the towns 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.920
 nomads as is the case of the Indians 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.720
 Americans had their camps in 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.240
 the places where they decided to do 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.250
 your horses the Bedouin of Sahara 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.560
 they preferred the place chosen by their 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.540
 dogs to rest the favorite place 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.100
 of the dogs became the place 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:01.320
 where to put stores 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.330
 dogs are considered a sense 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.939
 able to find healthy places on 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:08.310
 the earth and its opposites the cats 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.750
 they seem to like the places that 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.330
 for us they would have a character 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.030
 insane 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.710
 in the 16th century Bavaria they were brought 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.170
 anthills to the place where you thought 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:20.870
 build if the ants stayed in 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.670
 the land is not built to the house if 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.190
 they left and moved the anthill 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:28.340
 the place promised health and luck to their 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:30.050
 future residents at present the 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.940
 scientists have been able to observe that 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.280
 that same species of ants that 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:37.010
 they took to the land they usually build 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.020
 its nests on geological faults and it 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.480
 study its behavior as a method of 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:43.250
 anticipation before earthquakes this is 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.930
 due to its special sensitivity to 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.210
 variations in the emission of gases from 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.370
 subsoil and the changes produced in 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:51.770
 the terrestrial magnetic field before 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.110
 occur a seismic movement 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:55.190
 ants and other insects 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.780
 traditionally they have been related to 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.600
 places and in healthy for the human being 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:02.660
 as it also happens with moles or 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.370
 storks the presence of fungi or the 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.350
 been in the health and growth of 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.600
 vegetation also provide a 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:11.000
 invaluable information just like 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.860
 us each organism be it plant or 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.230
 animal has its own bio needs 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:17.600
 energetic and thrive in places 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.560
 with those that come into resonance wildlife and 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.599
 flora 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.910
 reliable indicators of character 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:24.770
 geological of the places the observation 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:26.630
 of the activity of plants and animals and 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:28.700
 especially the attention to our 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:31.130
 own sensations are the origin of a 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.780
 ancestral art that for thousands of years 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:35.150
 has evolved as a tool for 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.830
 health prosperity and transcendence a 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.769
 art that is the origin of what today 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:42.610
 day we know as geology we know how 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:42.610
 It is our place in life
