00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:06.750
 hello and welcome to the video channel 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.830
 of the blog my child draws today 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.900
 I would like 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:13.210
 you present a drawing I made 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.460
 with my daughter around the theme of 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:18.280
 farm animals 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:20.410
 it's to show a method for 

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:23.650
 learn a five-year 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:25.779
 drawn many farm animals 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.960
 I just wanted to do a little 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:30.670
 accuracy I received a comment on 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:34.680
 a my learning videos and 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:36.300
 drawings or tell me but actually 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.490
 video is what they are really useful 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.610
 since my child he draws better 

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:43.360
 to me I draw and better at that age 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:46.360
 i wanted 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:48.690
 to point out to you that the purpose of these 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:52.840
 videos is not showing the result 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.770
 final drawing but rather the process 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.410
 learning 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:59.100
 so what's important is not 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:01.320
 did the child succeed 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.449
 more or less good at drawing 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.780
 but did he enjoy the 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.369
 make 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.560
 is that it has retained their method 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.530
 in 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.570
 in this work that will be able to reproduce 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:17.810
 in another drawing later and 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:20.119
 especially what is this 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:25.399
 activity encourage him to do more 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:27.649
 manual activities so today 

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:28.460
 which to do this drawing with the animals of 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:32.119
 the farm 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.829
 we took in part a little bit 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:35.630
 different from the last drawing that I you 

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:36.560
 had shown so the last time I did not 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.350
 do not know if you remember 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.149
 we made a collage of rabbit and 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.569
 to make this rabbit collage we had 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:47.600
 compounds the body of the rabbit shaped 

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:49.310
 simple ovals and wheels that 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.170
 had stuck on a sheet and then 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.090
 then we had unleashed detail at the 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.819
 hand adding the nose to the mouth and 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:58.939
 all this so today for this drawing 

00:01:55.819 --> 00:02:01.250
 we had a very different approach in 

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:04.369
 first discussed it was not said 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:07.269
 compose the shape of the formless animal 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:09.679
 simple that would be easy to draw but 

00:02:07.269 --> 00:02:12.200
 rather one took the time to discuss 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:15.370
 in the day and even the day 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:18.640
 more on the 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.150
 the typology the body morphology of the 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.659
 animals 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.129
 how are they what they are 

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:25.209
 stand up is what stands out 

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:26.860
 four legs 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:28.750
 is their body rather 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.849
 to change is rather round 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.200
 how is the head made what is it 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:34.420
 is drawn as 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.220
 and of the man ie a round with 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:39.500
 the mouth and the eyes the nose or is it 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:42.590
 that there another one another 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.300
 typology and so on the basis of these 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.780
 discussions 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:50.090
 the 5-year-old put on paper his 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.070
 reflections somewhere so here's this 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.260
 that she did first for the hen who 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:58.480
 probably the most successful element of the 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:00.709
 drawing so she drew a body 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.810
 that she had decided to do as a 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:04.160
 banana so there you see a body of 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:07.100
 hen that is a little thin perhaps 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.600
 but that's because in her head she 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:10.550
 had thought about the question she 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.230
 had told me the chicken body c like 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:14.959
 a banana so here he had signed a 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:17.930
 banana suite she added the head and 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:20.030
 the pecq with an eye and then she had 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.739
 thought about the question he told me about 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.420
 the hen we do not see both eyes in 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:25.489
 same time since the winch it is from 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:28.250
 the other side so indeed veraison 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:30.410
 she had also thought of drawing 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.209
 little details you see and then also 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.730
 she had reflected on the shape of 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:35.980
 feet since 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.989
 hens do not wear shoes and 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.870
 then they urged a little bit 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:42.129
 different from ours 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.590
 so that's when then started to 

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:47.590
 to color his little care of the feet 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:49.209
 and the body 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:51.700
 she used three colors 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:55.690
 different and then she told me 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:57.550
 but in fact the legs of the hen 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:01.480
 they are normally orange while 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:04.660
 there at home only one black and so I 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:07.480
 I suggested doubling the feature 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:10.780
 members to be colored by the 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:13.330
 continuation in orange and its mine of anything it is 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:15.430
 for me an important passage in which 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:17.290
 to her accepted the idea is the same said ah 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.109
 but yes it was my idea actually 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:21.489
 I just did not have time to say it 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:24.850
 so for me it's an important passage 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:27.280
 since it allows him to understand that 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:29.410
 the limbs have a thickness and when 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.940
 something a low volume we draw 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:33.300
 with two traits since it is not 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.300
 simply 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:38.039
 you're spinning after that she had 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.689
 a little bit of trouble drawing the 

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:40.889
 chicks so it's me who drew 

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:42.360
 finally all because she had 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:44.280
 started two and it was precisely 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.490
 deceived with the body had drawn 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.680
 like when we draw 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:50.330
 name so good after he had surrendered 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.250
 account that it was not going and then the stage 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:54.560
 do not kill sad and then we are 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:57.080
 gone to the same horse for the horse 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.729
 little mistake you see she was 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.949
 very well managed with the head 

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:03.229
 and neck the ears you see it and 

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:05.780
 that's the snout he's fine 

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:10.280
 drawn and subsequently she drew 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:12.380
 the body a little bit elongated then 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:14.120
 as you well know of horse is 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:15.860
 not actually his body he is lying 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:18.330
 but horizontally to have the 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:21.120
 four legs underneath so 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:22.650
 then we corrected we made a body 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:25.590
 lying down she was a little saddened but 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:28.020
 finally I tell them it was 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:29.550
 saw like that the front of the animal 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:30.960
 was there it was the side it's not 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:32.039
 starts to become a drawing on the right and 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:35.069
 this is not voluntary 

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:37.439
 it was just a mistake at first so 

00:05:35.069 --> 00:05:39.120
 Then she colored her horse 

00:05:37.439 --> 00:05:41.729
 actually looks like we grow to 1 year 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.529
 it does not matter 

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:45.030
 and then we drew some more 

00:05:43.529 --> 00:05:49.470
 other 

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:53.010
 - so we will go to a flower a sheep there 

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:55.020
 you see the sheep that he has a head 

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:56.250
 a little rabbit but good like this is 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.960
 no matter what's important it's 

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:58.800
 that she actually did not have you see 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:01.650
 still the same mistake 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:04.440
 the body lying down when it had to be 

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:05.970
 rather the horizontal yet one in 

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:07.740
 had played in the day but that's 

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:09.510
 just a reflex of what he designed 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:11.430
 a lot of man so after the 

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:14.040
 to think it is said and concrete then worse 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:16.530
 my chin he will sit so it's for 

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:19.850
 that he has his paws forward here and 

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:19.850
 then there you see a butterfly 

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:22.760
 much more smart with the 

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:27.620
 butterflies this case there draws us sparkle 

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:29.120
 and jerbi flowers here the head of the hen 

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:31.940
 which is a little bit evolved since by 

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:34.640
 the rest there again thought he has 

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:35.180
 wanted to make an open beak so she has 

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:38.950
 added 

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:41.790
 here the lower part 

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:46.900
 and then here is the death in the final so we 

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:52.460
 an'a hen for that the show should 

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:54.230
 quickly your and then here we have a tree 

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:55.640
 with fruits 

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:56.920
 and no point there are fruits with 

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:58.180
 their stems 

00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:00.660
 maj sun 

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:00.660
 At her place 

00:07:01.129 --> 00:07:03.990
 everyone here 

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:05.370
 and then his ship 

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:08.310
 here I thank you for your 

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:10.320
 attention and then one more time 

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:12.660
 I draw your attention to the fact that 

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:15.300
 what's important in this video this 

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:16.950
 is not the final result of the drawing 

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:19.080
 but the process 

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:20.790
 so it's about having on for 

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:21.120
 this race animal drawings of the 

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:23.430
 closed 

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:25.710
 having spoken with the child 

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:30.360
 in the day before a few days 

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:33.750
 before on the morphology of the body of 

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:36.120
 animals is the difference with the body 

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:38.050
 of the man who is standing and then 

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:40.000
 here again 

00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:41.909
 and thank you for your attention 

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.539
 and I remind you that for more 

00:07:41.909 --> 00:07:44.560
 information and more ideas 

00:07:43.539 --> 00:07:46.990
 of manual activities 

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:49.599
 you can come visit and make 

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:52.180
 draw tip as it's a blog where 

00:07:49.599 --> 00:07:55.509
 we talk a lot about drawings of 

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:57.490
 DIY painting collage with 

00:07:55.509 --> 00:08:00.280
 children from 1 year old up to 

00:07:57.490 --> 00:08:01.599
 the age of 6-7 years old here I find you 

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:02.199
 wish a very good day I you 

00:08:01.599 --> 00:08:04.620
 see you soon 

00:08:02.199 --> 00:08:04.620
 goodbye
