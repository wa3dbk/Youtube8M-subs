last through for steven gerrard was I

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.570 
last through for steven gerrard was I

long<00:03:57.350> and<00:03:57.650> and<00:03:58.010> yeah<00:03:58.549> I<00:03:58.579> think<00:03:58.850> the<00:03:59.209> same

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450 
long and and yeah I think the same

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:01.509 
long and and yeah I think the same
happened<00:03:59.900> with<00:03:59.989> Jared<00:04:00.470> maybe<00:04:00.769> the<00:04:01.130> owners

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 
happened with Jared maybe the owners

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:04.420 
happened with Jared maybe the owners
didn't<00:04:02.000> feel<00:04:02.209> that<00:04:02.480> Jared<00:04:02.989> deserves<00:04:03.440> as<00:04:03.709> big<00:04:04.310> a

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
didn't feel that Jared deserves as big a

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.319 
didn't feel that Jared deserves as big a
contract<00:04:05.079> as<00:04:06.079> he<00:04:06.560> was<00:04:06.739> already<00:04:07.310> on<00:04:07.489> and<00:04:08.000> maybe

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:08.329 
contract as he was already on and maybe

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:10.809 
contract as he was already on and maybe
they<00:04:08.630> didn't<00:04:09.019> want<00:04:09.260> him<00:04:09.500> didn't<00:04:10.190> want<00:04:10.400> to<00:04:10.639> give

00:04:10.809 --> 00:04:10.819 
they didn't want him didn't want to give

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:13.059 
they didn't want him didn't want to give
him<00:04:11.030> like<00:04:11.569> a<00:04:11.600> two-year<00:04:12.109> contract<00:04:12.139> maybe<00:04:12.829> they

00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:13.069 
him like a two-year contract maybe they

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:14.530 
him like a two-year contract maybe they
wanted<00:04:13.370> to<00:04:13.489> give<00:04:13.670> him<00:04:13.819> only<00:04:13.970> a<00:04:14.090> one-year

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540 
wanted to give him only a one-year

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:17.890 
wanted to give him only a one-year
rolling<00:04:15.260> contract<00:04:15.620> and<00:04:15.980> I<00:04:16.340> think<00:04:17.060> it<00:04:17.209> speaks

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
rolling contract and I think it speaks

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.500 
rolling contract and I think it speaks
volumes<00:04:18.560> that<00:04:18.889> they<00:04:19.039> waited<00:04:19.519> until<00:04:19.700> november

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:20.510 
volumes that they waited until november

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:22.520 
volumes that they waited until november
until<00:04:20.659> jarred<00:04:21.140> came<00:04:21.470> out<00:04:21.680> in<00:04:21.890> the<00:04:22.010> media

until jarred came out in the media

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:26.629 
until jarred came out in the media
to<00:04:23.340> complain<00:04:24.120> and<00:04:24.480> to<00:04:24.660> basically<00:04:25.639> wake

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:26.639 
to complain and to basically wake

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:28.730 
to complain and to basically wake
everyone<00:04:27.330> up<00:04:27.480> that<00:04:27.930> he<00:04:28.080> hasn't<00:04:28.230> been<00:04:28.530> offered

unacceptable<00:04:31.919> in<00:04:32.400> my<00:04:32.430> opinion<00:04:32.940> so<00:04:33.240> I'm<00:04:33.440> quite

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
unacceptable in my opinion so I'm quite

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.950

i think if this whole situation would

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.510 
i think if this whole situation would
