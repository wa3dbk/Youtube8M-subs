and it could be seven your custom MPC's
I<00:01:21.509> thought<00:01:22.200> wow<00:01:22.500> I<00:01:22.530> wonder<00:01:22.799> if<00:01:22.979> it<00:01:23.130> would<00:01:23.250> work

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
I thought wow I wonder if it would work

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.740 
I thought wow I wonder if it would work
on<00:01:23.720> non-custom<00:01:24.720> MPC<00:01:25.259> in<00:01:25.560> pcs<00:01:26.100> and<00:01:26.430> I<00:01:27.420> decided

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
on non-custom MPC in pcs and I decided

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.710 
on non-custom MPC in pcs and I decided
to<00:01:27.869> try<00:01:28.290> to<00:01:28.350> clone<00:01:28.619> a<00:01:28.650> Pokemon<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:29.720> sure

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
to try to clone a Pokemon and sure

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.960 
to try to clone a Pokemon and sure
enough<00:01:30.750> it<00:01:31.200> works<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:32.009> you<00:01:32.280> can<00:01:32.460> save<00:01:32.729> them

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
enough it works and you can save them

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.600 
enough it works and you can save them
and<00:01:33.350> spawn<00:01:34.350> them<00:01:34.470> back<00:01:34.650> over<00:01:34.680> here<00:01:35.130> with<00:01:35.640> the

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
and spawn them back over here with the

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.190 
and spawn them back over here with the
cloner<00:01:38.610> tool<00:01:38.820> which<00:01:39.210> is<00:01:39.240> really<00:01:39.509> cool<00:01:39.720> I<00:01:39.960> know

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
also after I realized I could do the

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.709 
also after I realized I could do the
pokemon<00:02:05.189> i<00:02:05.219> thought<00:02:05.430> wow<00:02:05.610> i<00:02:05.939> wonder<00:02:06.149> if<00:02:06.540> it's

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
pokemon i thought wow i wonder if it's

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
spawner that will spawn random random

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.539 
spawner that will spawn random random
level<00:02:58.209> trainers<00:02:58.709> it<00:02:59.709> will<00:02:59.980> be<00:03:00.100> the<00:03:00.130> same

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:00.549 
level trainers it will be the same

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:03.180 
level trainers it will be the same
texture<00:03:01.299> but<00:03:01.569> I<00:03:01.600> mean<00:03:01.870> if<00:03:02.019> you<00:03:02.140> have<00:03:02.350> you<00:03:03.160> know

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
texture but I mean if you have you know

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:04.890 
texture but I mean if you have you know
multiple<00:03:03.730> mob<00:03:04.030> spawners<00:03:04.330> you<00:03:04.569> can<00:03:04.720> get<00:03:04.870> a

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
multiple mob spawners you can get a

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.559 
multiple mob spawners you can get a
variety<00:03:05.410> of<00:03:05.440> trainer<00:03:05.709> spawning<00:03:06.420> and<00:03:07.420> it's

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:07.569 
variety of trainer spawning and it's

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:08.580 
variety of trainer spawning and it's
really<00:03:07.750> cool<00:03:07.870> because<00:03:07.930> I<00:03:08.140> think<00:03:08.319> it<00:03:08.410> could<00:03:08.530> be

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
really cool because I think it could be

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.039 
really cool because I think it could be
used<00:03:08.799> for<00:03:08.920> like<00:03:09.250> maybe<00:03:09.580> quest<00:03:10.030> lines<00:03:10.330> or<00:03:10.840> just

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:11.049 
used for like maybe quest lines or just

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:14.400 
used for like maybe quest lines or just
areas<00:03:11.470> for<00:03:11.739> for<00:03:12.220> trainers<00:03:12.640> to<00:03:12.880> chain<00:03:13.630> and<00:03:13.930> you

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
areas for for trainers to chain and you

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:15.720 
areas for for trainers to chain and you
know<00:03:14.530> just<00:03:14.709> kind<00:03:14.890> of<00:03:14.950> ground<00:03:15.220> out<00:03:15.430> some

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
know just kind of ground out some

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.910
