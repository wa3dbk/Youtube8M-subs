00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:16.390

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.540

 [Music] 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.340
 good partners we are here in my house 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.620
 I hope you like the tour 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.960
 because we're going to start here in the kitchen 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.089
 As you can see, I like a large kitchen 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.460
 because I like to cook a lot 

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:53.559
 also with a super nice bonsai 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:56.559
 wait because I like it also then 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:58.149
 the fridge is also good here 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:59.739
 happened also with my friends as they give 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:01.629
 you that I am a single man 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:03.850
 so I like to be here with my 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:05.259
 partners with my friends enjoying 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.479
 the free times here I was also 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:09.850
 preparing and cooking many easy 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:12.009

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.230

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:17.319
 [Music] 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.500
 well over here we went to the dining room 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.970
 where it seems super essential to be 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.580
 with me and my sister who are the ones 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.080
 They live with me for breakfast 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.030
 lunch and lunch because I think 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.799
 which is a super sacred moment too 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.049
 around here we have as a small dining room 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:36.640
 that is like the one outside is when 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:39.369
 I also want to have breakfast then 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.619
 early hours with I'll also do 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:43.990
 exercise here I have my bars with the 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:45.640
 that I keep in shape because I like it 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.250
 do a lot of exercise also there I have 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.140
 the treadmill I live here also with 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.030
 my dog ​​carat that is not in that 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.950
 moment because then take it to the 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.050
 hairdresser so that for the girl 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.869
 Larán but he also keeps it 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:02.760
 around here in this area I also have some 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:05.430
 romeo toys have here 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.410
 here is a romeo toys that 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.229
 It's my cousin who 's like my little brother 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:13.080
 also because it's a big part of my life 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.820
 my family also had a baby turtle 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.490
 over here I am a man who likes 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.780
 very much the animals and then it is 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.850
 based on exercise is also something 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:25.190
 very fundamental to me with what I 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.190
 I keep strong and informal 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.910
 now we are here in the part of the 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.209
 barbecue 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:36.340
 there is a jacuzzi over there that is like 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:37.720
 hidden but we can not use them 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.640
 because the lid really weighs a lot 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.440
 but then when we make the patch 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.750
 the jacuzzi we come here 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.730
 we cook healthy things because 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.489
 I also like to eat very healthy 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.959
 chick carnitas vegetables some 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:52.000
 cocktails that I also like 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:53.590
 invite my four to do the 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.390
 cocktails because for that I am bad 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.099
 but also the part of the kitchen 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.620
 I also custom when my family 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:01.239
 my mom loves to cook and then nothing 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.069
 This is my house, I hope it has 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:05.290
