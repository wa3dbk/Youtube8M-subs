lot of shrinkage and I didn't get a

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.629 
lot of shrinkage and I didn't get a
little<00:04:02.750> shrinkage<00:04:02.959> this<00:04:03.290> time<00:04:03.530> but<00:04:04.340> you<00:04:04.459> can

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:04.639

see I'll get up close you can see the
curl<00:04:07.430> pattern<00:04:08.180> so<00:04:09.169> that<00:04:09.199> was<00:04:09.739> just<00:04:10.040> by<00:04:10.250> leaving

00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:10.549 
curl pattern so that was just by leaving

curl pattern so that was just by leaving
and<00:04:10.879> I<00:04:10.940> just<00:04:11.060> thought<00:04:11.120> it<00:04:11.299> would<00:04:11.359> just<00:04:11.510> I<00:04:11.780> would

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:12.139
