00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:17.410
 on Saturday, borussia dortmund comes in 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:19.119
 the coface arena is sitting in a team bus 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.460
 Jürgen Klopp the former coach of the 0 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:22.779
 5 0 5 was the under Klopp still played 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.599
 one of the few is nikolce 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:26.949
 Hello hello, it's for you 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:32.050
 still special games against jürgen 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:33.610
 Klop always get upset when you go against 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.850
 extreme plays we already have 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:39.010
 mirror jürgen klop and I think that 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.750
 It is a difficult task for us 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.820
 but if we are our performance 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.520
 bring and when we reach our limits 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.710
 can go knocked out the dortmunder 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.899
 we have robert lewandowski mario 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.159
 Götze marco reus a relatively well-known 

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:53.620
 offensive division you as a defensive player 

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:56.319
 Will you do that then you prepare yourself 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:59.859
 because somehow special attention before not 

00:00:56.319 --> 00:01:02.140
 special as before every other game 

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:04.960
 i think that that you are good people 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:07.150
 have that wismar and if we are good as 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.970
 team then also chances 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.470
 against borussia dortmund if you thomas 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.450
 Tuchel and Jürgen Klopp compare as 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.610
 trainers as the two experienced something 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:19.480
 draw one then and what the 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:21.900
 other similar types of emotional 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:23.980
 but still have the themes 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.470
 differ from each other the 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:27.700
 thomas then i can jürgen now 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:28.360
 do not even compare with the 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:33.480
 Time 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:38.110
 was here and now we have now with 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:43.240
 Thomas a coach of football 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:45.340
 very emotional lives and works 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:50.880
 Every day I think that he 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:54.340
 one of his footballing qualities 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.170
 So we are and are very high 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.630
 glad that we are training under him 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.410
 You can be for eight and a half years 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.800
 here I believe 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:03.940
 his contract expires in the summer there are 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.440
 somehow the talks already have 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.090
 started or how it works 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.489
 the months before the contract expires 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:12.159
 I can not say anything about it now 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:14.140
 I still have a lot more service 

00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:16.360
 year then spent watch me here 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.930
 Eight years are a long one 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.690
 Time 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.550
 you are a very down to earth 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.660
 hometowned man is mainz 05 like that 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.330
 something like a second home for you 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:28.180
 indeed become I feel very 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:30.940
 well and are already eight and a half years 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:33.760
 over I think we are a great 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.770
 had time here in mainz and hope that 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.340
 this is still successful 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:41.230
 his will sound 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.190
 contract extension I can do that 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.170
 at least to say 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:47.350
 Christian Heidel told me that 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.180
 we also do not let ourselves go 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.500
 ask 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:57.310
 mainz 05 wins at the weekend 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:03:00.880
 dortmund because because we are our series too 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:03.430
 want to keep home and because we want the 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:06.300
 just need three points 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.300
