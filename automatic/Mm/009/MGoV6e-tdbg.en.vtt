00:00:00.076 --> 00:00:03.094
 Ok, so today we are going to make a Moleskine notebook wallet 

00:00:03.094 --> 00:00:06.027
 This brand new Moleskine notebook diary 

00:00:06.056 --> 00:00:10.010
 On the upper side of the other side, the week of the paper is lined 

00:00:11.015 --> 00:00:12.095
 .. for 2012 

00:00:13.007 --> 00:00:15.035
 I am not like last year, 

00:00:15.035 --> 00:00:19.085
 Use the part of the card, then a piece of money and train tickets 

00:00:19.085 --> 00:00:21.040
 Or whatever you need... 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:25.033
 The first thing, stick to the quality control sticker, the back pocket file 

00:00:26.093 --> 00:00:29.068
 Wow, there is something there, what is this? 

00:00:31.091 --> 00:00:34.021
 what? this is new 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:40.027
 There are some icons, emoji stickers, interesting 

00:00:40.027 --> 00:00:41.004
 Hehehe~ 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.035
 I will push it down here. 

00:00:45.086 --> 00:00:51.001
 For all cards, you can use this solid piece of paper/cardboard at the back 

00:00:51.058 --> 00:00:55.099
 You can tape the edges and then cut some incisions 

00:00:55.099 --> 00:00:58.025
 Go inside the card, 

00:00:58.025 --> 00:01:00.089
 Even, my old... 

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:04.074
 The last page is actually a solid piece of cardboard. 

00:01:11.066 --> 00:01:18.077
 Yes, this is definitely more paper this year 2012 

00:01:18.077 --> 00:01:20.011
 Moderately mentally handicapped dormitory, a bit embarrassing, 

00:01:20.011 --> 00:01:22.054
 But this, it will still work, I want to... 

00:01:22.054 --> 00:01:23.097
 What I did last year, 

00:01:23.097 --> 00:01:25.038
 It may not be a problem, right now, 

00:01:25.038 --> 00:01:28.042
 But - in my portfolio, when I put the coin in there, 

00:01:28.042 --> 00:01:31.036
 I always try to get rid of all my coins, 

00:01:31.036 --> 00:01:35.012
 Let them in the money jar, 

00:01:35.089 --> 00:01:38.022
 Because they are heavy and annoying... 

00:01:38.068 --> 00:01:42.067
 Yes, last year, my portfolio began to fall apart... 

00:01:44.058 --> 00:01:45.060
 (there are) 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.057
 So I put some tape on the duck to keep it closed. 

00:01:51.057 --> 00:01:54.001
 The two sides are completely ok, 

00:01:54.001 --> 00:01:57.008
 The beginning is just a part of this whole, so I glued the recording, 

00:01:57.008 --> 00:01:58.057
 With this part, 

00:01:58.057 --> 00:02:03.009
 But I think if you just started recording together with a strong sticky card section, 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:05.002
 It should stay together, 

00:02:05.002 --> 00:02:07.082
 At the same time, this is also a book, this is 18 months, 

00:02:07.082 --> 00:02:13.010
 Why is this a year, so I won’t have quite as long as this person 

00:02:13.044 --> 00:02:16.096
 The card fits in such a thing, 

00:02:16.096 --> 00:02:22.007
 The card should be inserted into some of the flags in the file. 

00:02:22.007 --> 00:02:24.017
 You need to cut, 

00:02:24.017 --> 00:02:25.049
 You have to leave some space between 42 00:02:25,049 --&gt; 00:02:26, ​​091 so you can tape 43 00:02:26, ​​091 --&gt; 00:02:30,048 I am just Do some lines, 

00:02:30.048 --> 00:02:32.001
 And make some incisions 

00:02:32.001 --> 00:02:35.025
 Make sure they don't cut through the whole thing 

00:02:41.022 --> 00:02:48.000
 Make sure your knife is sharp, otherwise it may start ripping files 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.083
 You can go to the top of the tape list here. 

00:03:10.045 --> 00:03:14.016
 You can try this to make up for the incision of this paper. 

00:03:14.016 --> 00:03:16.000
 So don't strip it 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.049
 Such a thing 

00:03:24.097 --> 00:03:29.062
 Just this middle position, so that the card does not pass RIP all the way through 

00:03:35.048 --> 00:03:36.065
 Now let's take it 

00:03:36.065 --> 00:03:40.018
