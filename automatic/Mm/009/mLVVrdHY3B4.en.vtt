actually<00:00:16.529> pretty<00:00:16.980> nice-looking<00:00:17.160> RV<00:00:17.760> park<00:00:18.029> a

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:20.689 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:23.470 

minor<00:00:21.689> to<00:00:21.840> check<00:00:22.050> it<00:00:22.170> out<00:00:22.289> part<00:00:22.769> of<00:00:22.830> the<00:00:22.890> actual

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:23.480 
minor to check it out part of the actual

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.480 
minor to check it out part of the actual
one<00:00:24.480> of<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:24.600> bike<00:00:24.750> looks<00:00:24.990> anyway<00:00:25.320> so<00:00:25.430> but<00:00:26.430> they

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
one of the bike looks anyway so but they

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:41.369 
one of the bike looks anyway so but they
have<00:00:26.609> this<00:00:26.699> bridge<00:00:26.970> here

00:00:41.369 --> 00:00:41.379 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:01:05.899 

or<00:00:42.379> goes

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.100 

assuming<00:01:06.909> this<00:01:07.000> is<00:01:07.180> a<00:01:07.210> nature<00:01:07.600> trail<00:01:07.780> of<00:01:07.930> some

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110 
assuming this is a nature trail of some

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.399 
assuming this is a nature trail of some
sort<00:01:08.409> since<00:01:08.710> I<00:01:08.770> don't<00:01:08.830> have<00:01:08.950> a<00:01:09.039> map<00:01:09.280> I<00:01:10.289> can<00:01:11.289> only

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:11.409 
sort since I don't have a map I can only

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:32.170 
sort since I don't have a map I can only
guess<00:01:11.649> that

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:33.950 

looks<00:01:33.180> like<00:01:33.299> this<00:01:33.420> might<00:01:33.600> just<00:01:33.630> be<00:01:33.810> an

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
looks like this might just be an

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.590 
looks like this might just be an
extended<00:01:34.290> abuse<00:01:34.590> area<00:01:35.060> some<00:01:36.060> picking<00:01:36.299> tables

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
extended abuse area some picking tables

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:57.599 
extended abuse area some picking tables
back<00:01:36.750> here

00:01:57.599 --> 00:01:57.609 

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:59.739 

yeah<00:01:58.609> if<00:01:58.880> the<00:01:58.999> trailer<00:01:59.210> goes<00:01:59.420> here<00:01:59.630> in<00:01:59.689> this

00:01:59.739 --> 00:01:59.749 
yeah if the trailer goes here in this

00:01:59.749 --> 00:02:09.160 
yeah if the trailer goes here in this
panel<00:01:59.990> OOP<00:02:06.670> no<00:02:07.670> it<00:02:07.759> doesn't<00:02:07.969> it<00:02:08.000> goes<00:02:08.149> out<00:02:08.989> to<00:02:09.049> a

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
panel OOP no it doesn't it goes out to a

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:31.910 
panel OOP no it doesn't it goes out to a
point<00:02:09.470> out<00:02:09.590> here<00:02:09.739> it<00:02:09.799> looks<00:02:09.920> like

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.740 

okay<00:02:32.490> so<00:02:32.580> it<00:02:32.760> comes<00:02:32.820> out<00:02:33.090> to<00:02:33.150> the<00:02:33.360> point<00:02:33.600> out

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
okay so it comes out to the point out

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.380 
okay so it comes out to the point out
here<00:02:34.670> and<00:02:35.670> you<00:02:35.760> get<00:02:35.820> a<00:02:35.880> good<00:02:36.060> shot<00:02:36.360> of

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
here and you get a good shot of

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.960 
here and you get a good shot of
Sebastian<00:02:37.140> on<00:02:38.010> the<00:02:38.130> other<00:02:38.220> side<00:02:38.490> of<00:02:38.700> the<00:02:38.820> lake

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
Sebastian on the other side of the lake

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:51.530 
Sebastian on the other side of the lake
here<00:02:39.300> or<00:02:39.450> lake<00:02:40.190> whatever<00:02:41.190> this<00:02:41.280> is

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.030 

they<00:02:52.020> don't<00:02:52.170> think<00:02:52.260> I<00:02:52.379> want<00:02:52.560> to<00:02:52.590> venture<00:02:52.920> out

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040

00:02:53.040 --> 00:03:08.240 
they don't think I want to venture out
on<00:02:53.220> that<00:02:56.420> dock<00:02:57.420> structure

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:14.190
