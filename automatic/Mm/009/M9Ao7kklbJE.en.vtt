you<00:01:38.880> don't<00:01:39.090> get<00:01:39.180> color<00:01:39.479> bleeding<00:01:39.750> or<00:01:40.049> anything

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
you don't get color bleeding or anything

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.530 
you don't get color bleeding or anything
like<00:01:40.380> that<00:01:40.500> well<00:01:41.310> to<00:01:41.700> help<00:01:41.880> this<00:01:42.060> one<00:01:42.299> get

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
like that well to help this one get

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.950 
like that well to help this one get
perfect<00:01:43.049> color<00:01:43.490> they've<00:01:44.490> decided<00:01:45.240> to<00:01:45.479> use<00:01:45.659> a

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
perfect color they've decided to use a

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.010 
perfect color they've decided to use a
primary<00:01:46.920> color<00:01:47.040> filter<00:01:47.670> now<00:01:48.299> that<00:01:48.659> helps<00:01:48.899> to

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
primary color filter now that helps to

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.569 
primary color filter now that helps to
filter<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.470> different<00:01:49.799> bands<00:01:49.979> of<00:01:50.159> color<00:01:50.310> to

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
filter the different bands of color to

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.069 
filter the different bands of color to
give<00:01:50.700> you<00:01:50.820> a<00:01:50.850> look<00:01:51.060> more<00:01:51.329> like<00:01:51.479> one<00:01:51.930> of<00:01:51.960> those

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
give you a look more like one of those

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.429 
give you a look more like one of those

without getting a blur now motion blur
let<00:02:23.320> me<00:02:23.380> talk<00:02:23.500> about<00:02:23.680> that<00:02:23.770> because<00:02:23.890> that's

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
let me talk about that because that's

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.830 
let me talk about that because that's
something<00:02:24.280> that's<00:02:24.490> big<00:02:25.000> on<00:02:25.120> camcorders<00:02:25.690> when

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
something that's big on camcorders when

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.020 
something that's big on camcorders when
you<00:02:25.900> move<00:02:26.080> around<00:02:26.320> a<00:02:26.500> lot<00:02:26.650> the<00:02:27.430> colors<00:02:27.730> tend<00:02:27.940> to

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
you move around a lot the colors tend to

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.580 
you move around a lot the colors tend to
bleed<00:02:28.240> together<00:02:28.480> and<00:02:28.900> make<00:02:29.020> lines<00:02:29.230> and<00:02:29.500> then

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
bleed together and make lines and then

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:30.720 
bleed together and make lines and then
when<00:02:29.680> you<00:02:29.770> stop<00:02:29.980> it<00:02:30.190> everything<00:02:30.460> comes<00:02:30.610> back

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
when you stop it everything comes back

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.400 
when you stop it everything comes back
together<00:02:31.120> well<00:02:31.720> this<00:02:31.870> one<00:02:32.020> as<00:02:32.170> you're<00:02:32.320> moving

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
together well this one as you're moving

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.380 
together well this one as you're moving
around<00:02:32.620> you<00:02:32.950> see<00:02:33.100> there's<00:02:33.490> there's<00:02:33.670> almost

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
around you see there's there's almost

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.120 
around you see there's there's almost
there's<00:02:34.870> no<00:02:34.990> motion<00:02:35.320> blur<00:02:35.620> at<00:02:35.740> all<00:02:35.860> really

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
there's no motion blur at all really

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:37.650 
there's no motion blur at all really
that's<00:02:36.280> because<00:02:36.520> it's<00:02:36.670> a<00:02:36.730> CMOS<00:02:37.120> sensor<00:02:37.480> and

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
that's because it's a CMOS sensor and

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.780 
that's because it's a CMOS sensor and
not<00:02:38.110> the<00:02:38.260> standard<00:02:38.500> ccd<00:02:39.160> sensor<00:02:39.520> these<00:02:39.670> are

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
not the standard ccd sensor these are

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.260 
not the standard ccd sensor these are
much<00:02:39.940> better<00:02:40.680> with<00:02:41.680> movement<00:02:42.130> than<00:02:42.640> the<00:02:42.790> ccd

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.270 
much better with movement than the ccd

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.570 
much better with movement than the ccd
sensor<00:02:43.660> so<00:02:43.840> that's<00:02:44.020> a<00:02:44.260> bonus<00:02:44.410> as<00:02:44.680> well<00:02:44.860> now<00:02:45.460> if

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
sensor so that's a bonus as well now if

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:46.770 
sensor so that's a bonus as well now if
you're<00:02:45.730> looking<00:02:45.970> at<00:02:46.060> the<00:02:46.150> screen<00:02:46.330> here<00:02:46.630> this

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
you're looking at the screen here this

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.860 
you're looking at the screen here this
is<00:02:46.900> a<00:02:46.930> 2.7<00:02:47.710> inch<00:02:47.770> widescreen<00:02:48.510> we<00:02:49.510> have<00:02:49.690> that

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
is a 2.7 inch widescreen we have that

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.020 
is a 2.7 inch widescreen we have that
here<00:02:50.080> not<00:02:50.890> another<00:02:51.220> touchscreen<00:02:51.700> like<00:02:51.850> some

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
here not another touchscreen like some

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.280 
here not another touchscreen like some
of<00:02:52.120> the<00:02:52.180> Sony<00:02:52.360> models<00:02:52.720> but<00:02:52.870> that<00:02:52.990> means<00:02:53.170> you're

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
of the Sony models but that means you're

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:54.330 
of the Sony models but that means you're
not<00:02:53.380> going<00:02:53.500> to<00:02:53.560> be<00:02:53.650> getting<00:02:53.740> smudges<00:02:54.220> all<00:02:54.310> over

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
not going to be getting smudges all over

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.640 
not going to be getting smudges all over
the<00:02:54.580> screen<00:02:54.760> so<00:02:55.390> that's<00:02:55.540> nice<00:02:55.750> as<00:02:55.960> well<00:02:56.140> we

have all the playback controls right

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.090 
have all the playback controls right
there<00:02:57.970> it's<00:02:58.120> upside<00:02:58.420> down<00:02:58.570> I<00:02:58.600> know<00:02:58.780> but<00:02:59.100> there

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
there it's upside down I know but there

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.070 
there it's upside down I know but there
we<00:03:00.220> go<00:03:00.340> how's<00:03:00.550> that<00:03:00.790> as<00:03:01.060> all<00:03:01.630> your<00:03:01.660> playback

you're in shutter priority it'll go as
low<00:05:01.630> as<00:05:01.660> a<00:05:01.840> half<00:05:02.229> second<00:05:02.650> all<00:05:02.800> the<00:05:02.979> way<00:05:03.070> up<00:05:03.160> to

low as a half second all the way up to
12<00:05:03.910> thousand<00:05:04.330> of<00:05:04.419> a<00:05:04.479> second<00:05:05.070> so<00:05:06.070> a<00:05:06.100> huge<00:05:06.370> range

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:06.700 
12 thousand of a second so a huge range

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:08.580 
12 thousand of a second so a huge range
there<00:05:06.940> a<00:05:07.120> half<00:05:07.690> second<00:05:07.960> looks<00:05:08.110> kind<00:05:08.260> of<00:05:08.320> kind

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:08.590 
there a half second looks kind of kind

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:10.560 
there a half second looks kind of kind
of<00:05:08.710> funky<00:05:09.010> but<00:05:09.190> if<00:05:09.880> you<00:05:10.000> want<00:05:10.150> to<00:05:10.210> run<00:05:10.330> it<00:05:10.450> in

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:10.570 
of funky but if you want to run it in

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:12.810 
of funky but if you want to run it in
like<00:05:10.780> one<00:05:11.530> sixtieth<00:05:11.979> of<00:05:12.190> a<00:05:12.310> second<00:05:12.639> shutter

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:12.820 
like one sixtieth of a second shutter

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:13.890 
like one sixtieth of a second shutter
that<00:05:13.030> will<00:05:13.120> help<00:05:13.240> for<00:05:13.479> some<00:05:13.600> low<00:05:13.690> light

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:13.900 
that will help for some low light

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:15.780 
that will help for some low light
situations<00:05:14.530> as<00:05:14.650> well<00:05:14.680> like<00:05:15.460> I<00:05:15.550> said<00:05:15.610> all

situations as well like I said all
around<00:05:16.090> this<00:05:16.300> one's<00:05:16.510> better<00:05:16.690> for<00:05:16.960> low-light<00:05:17.289> I

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:17.560 
around this one's better for low-light I

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.920 
around this one's better for low-light I
