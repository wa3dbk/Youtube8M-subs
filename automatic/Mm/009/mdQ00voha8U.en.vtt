00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
business audience I think personally I

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.330 
business audience I think personally I
do<00:01:16.200> think<00:01:16.530> that<00:01:16.590> there's<00:01:16.830> going<00:01:16.920> to<00:01:16.979> be<00:01:17.040> a

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
do think that there's going to be a

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.039 
do think that there's going to be a
broader<00:01:17.820> applicability<00:01:18.240> of<00:01:18.570> this<00:01:18.659> product

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
broader applicability of this product

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.600 
broader applicability of this product
but<00:01:19.200> let's<00:01:19.409> just<00:01:19.619> start<00:01:20.070> from<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.340> baseline

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
but let's just start from the baseline

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.630 
but let's just start from the baseline
and<00:01:20.939> say<00:01:21.119> that<00:01:21.299> as<00:01:21.509> compared<00:01:22.259> to<00:01:22.830> a<00:01:22.860> purely

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
and say that as compared to a purely

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.730 
and say that as compared to a purely
consumer<00:01:24.180> product<00:01:24.540> there<00:01:24.960> are<00:01:25.110> some<00:01:25.320> some

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
consumer product there are some some

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:26.870 
consumer product there are some some
additions<00:01:26.130> and<00:01:26.310> some<00:01:26.430> things<00:01:26.610> that<00:01:26.700> are<00:01:26.790> done

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
additions and some things that are done

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.149 
additions and some things that are done
differently<00:01:27.270> here<00:01:27.509> okay<00:01:27.810> right<00:01:28.159> primary

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
differently here okay right primary

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.160 
differently here okay right primary
among<00:01:29.340> them<00:01:29.549> is<00:01:29.759> you<00:01:30.060> it<00:01:30.329> is<00:01:30.360> I<00:01:30.540> think<00:01:30.720> bad<00:01:30.930> and

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
among them is you it is I think bad and

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.940 
among them is you it is I think bad and
it<00:01:31.290> has<00:01:31.409> TrackPoint

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
it has TrackPoint

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.249 
it has TrackPoint
so<00:01:32.850> there's<00:01:33.030> certainly<00:01:33.360> a<00:01:33.450> loyalist<00:01:33.960> group

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
so there's certainly a loyalist group

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.679 
so there's certainly a loyalist group
out<00:01:34.500> there<00:01:34.549> that<00:01:35.549> wants<00:01:35.820> that<00:01:36.000> whereas<00:01:36.450> you

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
out there that wants that whereas you

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.749

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:55.069 
is the differentiator as well a sim card
slot<00:02:54.000> because<00:02:54.299> we<00:02:54.390> do<00:02:54.510> have<00:02:54.629> built<00:02:54.930> in

is<00:03:20.459> or<00:03:20.639> so<00:03:21.060> to<00:03:21.389> cut<00:03:21.569> right<00:03:21.720> to<00:03:21.780> the<00:03:21.900> chase

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
is or so to cut right to the chase

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:24.080 
is or so to cut right to the chase
here's<00:03:22.769> the<00:03:22.889> key<00:03:23.040> difference<00:03:23.430> it<00:03:23.760> doesn't

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
here's the key difference it doesn't

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:25.400 
here's the key difference it doesn't
flip<00:03:24.239> all<00:03:24.420> the<00:03:24.540> way<00:03:24.630> over<00:03:24.870> around<00:03:24.989> backwards

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
flip all the way over around backwards

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.680 
flip all the way over around backwards
it<00:03:25.560> is<00:03:25.590> more<00:03:26.340> in<00:03:26.549> the<00:03:26.700> traditional<00:03:27.239> mold<00:03:27.389> of<00:03:27.599> a

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
it is more in the traditional mold of a

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.920 
it is more in the traditional mold of a
convertible<00:03:28.079> PC<00:03:28.349> in<00:03:28.709> that<00:03:29.010> it<00:03:29.220> spins<00:03:29.639> around

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
convertible PC in that it spins around

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.979 
convertible PC in that it spins around
folds<00:03:30.930> down<00:03:31.250> okay<00:03:32.280> not<00:03:32.940> unlike<00:03:33.269> something<00:03:33.599> pad

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
folds down okay not unlike something pad

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.289 
folds down okay not unlike something pad
X<00:03:34.260> series<00:03:34.739> models<00:03:35.670> that<00:03:35.790> we've<00:03:35.910> made<00:03:36.090> in<00:03:36.209> the

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:36.299 
X series models that we've made in the

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:38.150 
X series models that we've made in the
past<00:03:36.510> is<00:03:36.780> that<00:03:36.930> right<00:03:37.139> exactly<00:03:37.319> okay<00:03:37.980> exactly

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
past is that right exactly okay exactly

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.819 
past is that right exactly okay exactly
so<00:03:38.669> so<00:03:39.000> yoga<00:03:39.239> has<00:03:39.510> the<00:03:39.690> two<00:03:39.840> hinges<00:03:40.169> and<00:03:40.349> goes

all the way around this is a different

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.440 
all the way around this is a different
approach<00:03:43.470> right<00:03:43.859> right<00:03:44.040> right<00:03:44.250> it's<00:03:45.150> just<00:03:45.359> two

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
approach right right right it's just two

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:46.729 
approach right right right it's just two

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:10.950 
your traditional interface devices with

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:13.280 
your traditional interface devices with
your<00:06:10.979> touchpad<00:06:11.250> and<00:06:11.729> your<00:06:11.850> track<00:06:12.090> point<00:06:12.419> and

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:15.270 
then also wants all the the goodness

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:17.659 
then also wants all the the goodness
that<00:06:16.050> touchscreen<00:06:16.350> and<00:06:16.830> and<00:06:17.130> Windows<00:06:17.400> 8<00:06:17.550> will

00:06:17.659 --> 00:06:17.669 
that touchscreen and and Windows 8 will

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:21.290 
that touchscreen and and Windows 8 will
bring<00:06:17.850> right<00:06:18.150> right<00:06:18.810> so<00:06:19.400> you've<00:06:20.400> got<00:06:20.640> that<00:06:20.910> and

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:21.300 
bring right right so you've got that and

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:23.030 
bring right right so you've got that and
again<00:06:21.780> to<00:06:22.169> kind<00:06:22.320> of<00:06:22.350> go<00:06:22.440> back<00:06:22.470> to<00:06:22.650> do<00:06:22.740> start<00:06:22.979> to

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:23.040 
again to kind of go back to do start to

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:24.140 
again to kind of go back to do start to
differentiate<00:06:23.550> this<00:06:23.760> from<00:06:23.850> a<00:06:23.970> purely

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:24.150 
differentiate this from a purely

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:25.790 
differentiate this from a purely
consumer<00:06:24.600> product<00:06:24.900> you've<00:06:25.200> got<00:06:25.380> things<00:06:25.620> like

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:25.800 
consumer product you've got things like

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:28.130 
consumer product you've got things like
it's<00:06:26.460> simple<00:06:26.760> but<00:06:26.970> things<00:06:27.180> like<00:06:27.479> a<00:06:27.660> lock<00:06:27.870> slot

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:28.140 
it's simple but things like a lock slot

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:30.880 
it's simple but things like a lock slot
right<00:06:28.650> a<00:06:28.770> Kensington<00:06:29.220> lock<00:06:29.370> slot<00:06:29.610> your<00:06:30.120> TPM

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:30.890 
right a Kensington lock slot your TPM

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:34.700 
right a Kensington lock slot your TPM
you<00:06:31.890> know<00:06:31.979> things<00:06:32.190> that<00:06:32.400> are<00:06:32.490> going<00:06:32.640> to

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:34.710 
you know things that are going to

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:36.710 
you know things that are going to
differentiate<00:06:35.610> that<00:06:35.790> in<00:06:36.000> terms<00:06:36.270> of<00:06:36.390> use<00:06:36.510> case

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:36.720 
differentiate that in terms of use case

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:38.390 
differentiate that in terms of use case
so<00:06:36.840> I<00:06:36.870> think<00:06:37.110> it's<00:06:37.500> mostly<00:06:37.770> business<00:06:38.130> but<00:06:38.310> it

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:38.400 
so I think it's mostly business but it

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:39.650 
so I think it's mostly business but it
does<00:06:38.550> still<00:06:38.730> also<00:06:38.910> apply<00:06:39.240> to<00:06:39.270> a<00:06:39.420> certain

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:39.660 
does still also apply to a certain

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:41.330
