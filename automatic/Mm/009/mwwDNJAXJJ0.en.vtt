00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
gonna go now I'm gonna find like the

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.160 
gonna go now I'm gonna find like the
best<00:01:52.979> part<00:01:53.550> of<00:01:53.610> it<00:01:53.810> you're<00:01:54.810> actually<00:01:55.080> gonna

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
best part of it you're actually gonna

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.570 
best part of it you're actually gonna
use<00:01:55.290> this<00:01:55.470> because<00:01:55.680> it<00:01:55.770> already<00:01:55.890> dips<00:01:56.280> down<00:01:56.520> a

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:56.580 
use this because it already dips down a

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:10.270 
use this because it already dips down a
little<00:01:56.790> bit<00:01:57.000> and<00:01:57.300> I'm<00:01:57.420> just<00:01:57.570> going<00:01:57.780> to<00:01:58.130> put<00:01:59.130> it

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:12.770 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:16.060 

and<00:03:13.180> he's<00:03:14.180> not<00:03:14.840> going<00:03:15.140> to<00:03:15.290> be<00:03:15.380> perfect<00:03:15.830> at<00:03:16.040> all

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:16.070 
and he's not going to be perfect at all

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:19.720 
and he's not going to be perfect at all
I<00:03:16.870> was<00:03:17.870> going<00:03:18.170> to<00:03:18.470> pop<00:03:18.830> the<00:03:19.130> little<00:03:19.310> two

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
I was going to pop the little two

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:25.620 
I was going to pop the little two
carrots<00:03:20.150> lose

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:34.000 

my<00:03:26.630> little<00:03:26.840> mouse<00:03:29.980> can<00:03:30.980> see<00:03:31.340> him<00:03:33.010> that's

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
my little mouse can see him that's

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:38.860 
my little mouse can see him that's
because<00:03:34.430> he<00:03:34.550> wasn't<00:03:34.730> completely<00:03:35.570> dry<00:03:37.870> like

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
because he wasn't completely dry like

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:49.690 
because he wasn't completely dry like
white<00:03:39.170> and<00:03:39.590> get<00:03:39.770> him<00:03:39.860> on<00:03:39.950> the<00:03:40.100> table
