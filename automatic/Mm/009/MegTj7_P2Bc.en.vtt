00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:15.290
 completely forget the rumors that 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:17.060
 want dark souls two more accessible 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:19.130
 and easier than in the past 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:21.080
 the title is bastard 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.850
 unheard of in some ways even 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.890
 higher than its predecessors 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:26.720
 the main difference concerns the 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.609
 classes that in the first dark souls 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.800
 represented little more than a point of 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:32.750
 plasma departure gives you pleasure without 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.030
 special differentiations removed 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.160
 the initial equipment in this 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.630
 the following will no longer be the case and the classes 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.969
 will change based on the development of 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:42.950
 character giving him unique abilities 

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:45.559
 that will directly affect the style 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:47.660
 in short, freedom of development 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:49.399
 should be more or less the same but 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.260
 once a specific route has been taken 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:52.940
 the more difficult will make the system 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.920
 creating a character with more 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.850
 specializations accentuating the 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.949
 specific qualities 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.750
 the new importance of the classes yes 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:02.059
 translates into a more varied gameplay with 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.500
 more attack options for the player 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:05.420
 the weapons switch is practically 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.979
 instantaneous both for the shield and for 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.619
 the primary weapon and it is now possible 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:11.150
 fight with a true dual wield that 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:12.920
 it is not limited to counter with the sword 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.720
 short in the left but allows 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.799
 attacks with both hands and blows 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.390
 combined 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:19.549
 the differences in the 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.530
 mobility with classes like the Templar who 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:23.509
 they move slowly but use weapons 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.280
 huge from the high damage and remain 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:27.320
 stable under enemy blows while 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.920
 swordsman sorcerer moving with 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.360
 very agile leaps and sudden jerks 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.369
 you will probably think that in the face of 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.320
 improvements in gameplay the challenge is 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:38.270
 dropped but just a few minutes to 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.979
 realizing that even in dark souls two 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.680
 deaths come with a frequency 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:44.390
 unheard of all the merit of the anemic 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.280
 even more aggressive than the 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.799
 past is equipped with more batteries 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.450
 variable and difficult to predict some 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:51.979
 opponents such as a mighty one 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.320
 knight with a sort of shell 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:56.360
 metal from turtle also possess 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.920
 instinctive attacks on the shoulders for 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.630
 play those players suddenly 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.560
 who will try to use the usual 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.689
 tactic of lateral displacement 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.030
 already knows that we better clarify that 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.930
 even the almost automated backstab 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.670
 in the predecessor 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.590
 here they will not be feasible with the same 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.390
 frequency so don't expect to 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.940
 stabbing beautifully in the back 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.770
 all the beasts encountered by the point 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.360
 from a technical point of view we are similarly placed 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.590
 well with net improvements 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.410
 to lighting and retail 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.569
 general maps model the style of 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.190
 armor weapons is always exceptionally 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:28.769
 inspired between the dark and exaggeration 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.180
 typical of Japanese and non-Japanese fantasy 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:32.250
 looks compared to 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.160
 terrifying creatures come out of the minds 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.209
 of artists from software 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.190
 particularly impressive the 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:40.080
 gigantic knight is seen in the demo 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.640
 a brutal fight that even 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.260
 maintaining the typical characteristics 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.630
 clashes against huge beasts 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.940
 seen in the previous chapter adds 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.769
 to the formula million evoked and strikes c 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.989
 magic ready to fry our alter 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:54.769
 ego so what to say you really still have 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:54.769
 doubts about the difficulty
