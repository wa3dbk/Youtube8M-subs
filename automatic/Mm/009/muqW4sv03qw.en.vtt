beat up I've been using this woman for

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.750 
beat up I've been using this woman for
probably<00:00:28.109> over<00:00:28.199> six<00:00:28.590> months<00:00:28.769> now<00:00:29.039> surprised<00:00:29.730> I

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
probably over six months now surprised I

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.189 
probably over six months now surprised I
haven't<00:00:30.000> lost<00:00:30.179> yet<00:00:30.480> but<00:00:30.779> I<00:00:30.810> use<00:00:31.019> it<00:00:31.140> a<00:00:31.170> lot

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
haven't lost yet but I use it a lot

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.010 
haven't lost yet but I use it a lot
asphalt<00:00:31.980> and<00:00:32.340> pavement<00:00:33.149> a<00:00:33.300> nice<00:00:33.809> smooth

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
asphalt and pavement a nice smooth

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.470 
asphalt and pavement a nice smooth
surface<00:00:34.050> as<00:00:34.469> well<00:00:34.710> and<00:00:34.980> it<00:00:35.520> is<00:00:35.760> still<00:00:36.149> in<00:00:36.239> great

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
surface as well and it is still in great

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.590 
surface as well and it is still in great
condition<00:00:36.510> I<00:00:37.200> use<00:00:37.800> it<00:00:37.920> all<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.040> time<00:00:38.309> and<00:00:38.600> it's

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
condition I use it all the time and it's

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.270 
condition I use it all the time and it's
got<00:00:39.719> a<00:00:39.750> nice<00:00:39.899> durable<00:00:40.440> outer<00:00:40.620> core<00:00:40.980> so<00:00:41.190> it's

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
got a nice durable outer core so it's

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.040 
got a nice durable outer core so it's
gonna<00:00:41.370> last<00:00:41.579> for<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:41.879> long<00:00:41.969> time<00:00:42.210> as<00:00:42.750> far<00:00:42.809> as

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
gonna last for the long time as far as

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.950 
gonna last for the long time as far as
the<00:00:43.140> size<00:00:43.350> that<00:00:44.280> is<00:00:44.489> smaller<00:00:44.940> than<00:00:45.149> a<00:00:45.239> puck<00:00:45.480> so

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
the size that is smaller than a puck so

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.160 
the size that is smaller than a puck so
I<00:00:46.020> see<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.950> there<00:00:47.100> in<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.280> background

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.170 
I see the there in the background

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.799 
I see the there in the background
it's<00:00:49.170> also<00:00:49.379> taller<00:00:50.309> than<00:00:50.550> a<00:00:50.610> hockey<00:00:50.910> puck<00:00:51.059> but

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
it's also taller than a hockey puck but

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.130 
it's also taller than a hockey puck but
the<00:00:51.930> idea<00:00:52.230> is<00:00:52.320> that<00:00:53.010> line<00:00:53.219> right<00:00:53.489> there<00:00:53.550> is<00:00:54.140> the

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
the idea is that line right there is the

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.110 
the idea is that line right there is the
same<00:00:55.379> point<00:00:55.739> that<00:00:56.100> your<00:00:56.699> stick<00:00:56.910> is<00:00:57.030> gonna

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
same point that your stick is gonna

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.510 
same point that your stick is gonna
contact<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:57.809> puck<00:00:58.079> so<00:00:58.620> it<00:00:58.739> was<00:00:58.859> made<00:00:59.100> to<00:00:59.340> have

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
contact the puck so it was made to have

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.490 
contact the puck so it was made to have
the<00:00:59.550> same<00:00:59.850> contact<00:01:00.329> point<00:01:00.690> as<00:01:00.899> a<00:01:00.930> puck<00:01:01.230> and

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
the same contact point as a puck and

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.130 
the same contact point as a puck and
also<00:01:02.129> it's<00:01:02.370> a<00:01:02.430> bit<00:01:02.579> lighter<00:01:02.850> than<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.149> puck<00:01:03.359> but

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
also it's a bit lighter than a puck but

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.859 
also it's a bit lighter than a puck but
on<00:01:04.409> ice<00:01:04.830> a<00:01:05.159> puck<00:01:05.460> slides<00:01:06.030> really<00:01:06.360> easily

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
on ice a puck slides really easily

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.350 
on ice a puck slides really easily
so<00:01:07.350> it<00:01:07.470> feels<00:01:07.680> lighter<00:01:08.010> so<00:01:08.640> they<00:01:08.970> made<00:01:09.119> this<00:01:09.299> a

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
so it feels lighter so they made this a

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.260 
so it feels lighter so they made this a
bit<00:01:09.570> lighter<00:01:09.810> so<00:01:09.930> it<00:01:10.350> feels<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.920> same<00:01:11.189> as<00:01:11.520> a

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
bit lighter so it feels the same as a

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.270 
bit lighter so it feels the same as a
pock<00:01:12.510> would<00:01:12.689> feel<00:01:12.869> on<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.200> ice<00:01:13.320> so<00:01:13.920> that's

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
pock would feel on the ice so that's

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.679 
pock would feel on the ice so that's
sort<00:01:14.610> of<00:01:14.700> like<00:01:14.760> a<00:01:14.850> smart<00:01:15.150> design<00:01:15.420> that's<00:01:15.630> why

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
sort of like a smart design that's why

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.149 
sort of like a smart design that's why
they<00:01:15.780> call<00:01:15.900> it<00:01:15.990> I<00:01:16.049> guess<00:01:16.170> smart<00:01:16.409> hockey<00:01:16.560> and

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
they call it I guess smart hockey and

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.710
