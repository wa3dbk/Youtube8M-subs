we've<00:00:27.250> also<00:00:27.430> got<00:00:27.760> as<00:00:27.880> well<00:00:28.000> the<00:00:28.210> regulator<00:00:28.599> bag

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:28.869 
we've also got as well the regulator bag

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:30.990 
we've also got as well the regulator bag
from<00:00:29.050> apex<00:00:29.349> here<00:00:29.650> as<00:00:29.769> well<00:00:29.949> let's<00:00:30.849> go<00:00:30.939> ahead

and take a closer look at some of these

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.750 
and take a closer look at some of these
features<00:00:32.140> so<00:00:32.470> this<00:00:33.040> package<00:00:33.340> has<00:00:33.430> been<00:00:33.580> put

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:33.760 
features so this package has been put

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.060 
features so this package has been put
together<00:00:33.910> as<00:00:34.480> it's<00:00:34.690> a<00:00:34.870> real<00:00:35.260> workhorse<00:00:35.530> of<00:00:35.979> the

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:36.070 
together as it's a real workhorse of the

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.399 
together as it's a real workhorse of the
regulator<00:00:36.519> world<00:00:36.909> so<00:00:37.659> then<00:00:37.989> you've<00:00:38.229> had

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:38.409 
regulator world so then you've had

00:00:38.409 --> 00:00:40.200 
regulator world so then you've had
regulator<00:00:39.070> sets<00:00:39.370> in<00:00:39.519> the<00:00:39.610> past<00:00:39.850> I<00:00:40.059> haven't

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.210 
regulator sets in the past I haven't

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.299 
regulator sets in the past I haven't
really<00:00:40.479> met<00:00:40.600> up<00:00:40.780> to<00:00:40.900> your<00:00:41.019> expectations<00:00:41.830> and
