well strategy is extremely important in
a<00:01:17.500> team<00:01:17.740> battle<00:01:18.220> but<00:01:18.759> it<00:01:18.850> looks<00:01:19.030> like<00:01:19.240> there's

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
a team battle but it looks like there's

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.749 
a team battle but it looks like there's
a<00:01:19.479> lot<00:01:19.659> more<00:01:19.960> going<00:01:20.229> on<00:01:20.470> here<00:01:20.530> if<00:01:21.159> you're<00:01:21.490> not

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:21.759 
a lot more going on here if you're not

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:24.270 
a lot more going on here if you're not
going<00:01:22.090> to<00:01:22.180> make<00:01:22.330> a<00:01:22.360> move<00:01:22.689> then<00:01:22.899> I<00:01:23.110> will<00:01:23.500> let's

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.700 

attack<00:01:38.390> didn't<00:01:38.750> do<00:01:38.840> anything<00:01:39.080> at<00:01:39.350> all

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.940 

I<00:01:41.740> can't<00:01:42.580> believe<00:01:43.000> it<00:01:43.420> Pegasus<00:01:44.320> and<00:01:44.470> strikers

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
I can't believe it Pegasus and strikers

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:46.560 
I can't believe it Pegasus and strikers
moves<00:01:45.190> didn't<00:01:45.520> even<00:01:45.640> make<00:01:45.850> a<00:01:45.910> dent<00:01:46.210> on<00:01:46.390> their

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
moves didn't even make a dent on their

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:57.460 
moves didn't even make a dent on their
Bey's<00:01:46.840> at<00:01:47.110> all

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.470 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.510 

it's<00:01:58.070> no<00:01:58.340> use

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.609 

just<00:02:02.520> not<00:02:02.700> budging<00:02:03.149> at<00:02:03.240> all<00:02:03.420> it's<00:02:04.200> almost<00:02:04.409> like

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
just not budging at all it's almost like

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.560 
just not budging at all it's almost like
I'm<00:02:04.770> slamming<00:02:05.219> up<00:02:05.310> against<00:02:05.579> the<00:02:05.789> wall<00:02:06.030> here

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
I'm slamming up against the wall here

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.199 
I'm slamming up against the wall here
actually<00:02:07.289> grand<00:02:07.860> cetus<00:02:08.160> is<00:02:08.459> fusion<00:02:08.729> wheel<00:02:09.060> is

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
actually grand cetus is fusion wheel is

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.210 
actually grand cetus is fusion wheel is
just<00:02:09.239> like<00:02:09.660> a<00:02:09.690> wall<00:02:10.019> it<00:02:10.649> has<00:02:10.709> amazing

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
just like a wall it has amazing

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.940 
just like a wall it has amazing
defensive<00:02:12.060> power<00:02:12.300> that<00:02:13.260> may<00:02:13.470> be<00:02:13.530> true<00:02:13.920> but

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
defensive power that may be true but

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.770 
defensive power that may be true but
Pegasus<00:02:14.640> is<00:02:14.760> attack<00:02:15.090> should<00:02:15.330> be<00:02:15.480> able<00:02:15.720> to

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
Pegasus is attack should be able to

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.780 
Pegasus is attack should be able to
break<00:02:15.989> through<00:02:16.170> somehow<00:02:16.650> it's<00:02:17.340> some<00:02:17.550> over

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
break through somehow it's some over

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.600 
break through somehow it's some over
sharper<00:02:18.180> corners<00:02:18.360> dip<00:02:18.890> the<00:02:19.890> friction<00:02:20.340> power

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
sharper corners dip the friction power

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.790 
sharper corners dip the friction power
of<00:02:20.970> the<00:02:21.090> rubber<00:02:21.330> makes<00:02:21.930> it<00:02:22.080> harder<00:02:22.500> to<00:02:22.530> move

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
of the rubber makes it harder to move

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.699 
of the rubber makes it harder to move
plus<00:02:23.459> blue<00:02:24.180> see<00:02:24.480> this<00:02:24.630> is<00:02:24.780> spin<00:02:25.080> track<00:02:25.349> is<00:02:25.530> it's
