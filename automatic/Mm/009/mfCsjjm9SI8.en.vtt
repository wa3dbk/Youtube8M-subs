 I wish everyone could play the final 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:17.029

 I wish all penalties could enter 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:06.239
 but only the panthers took the 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.239
 ticket after eliminating the icesi you know 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.990

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.100

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:52.850
 schedules to be honest that 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:54.920
 We were a warrior, we did not give ourselves 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:58.429
 beaten until the last minute we fight 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.840
