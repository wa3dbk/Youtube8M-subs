with<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:38.969> flamenco<00:00:39.269> guitar<00:00:39.690> a<00:00:40.129> lot<00:00:41.129> of<00:00:41.249> times

00:00:41.419 --> 00:00:41.429 
with the flamenco guitar a lot of times

00:00:41.429 --> 00:00:43.099 
with the flamenco guitar a lot of times
that<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.909> melody<00:00:42.179> is<00:00:42.329> actually<00:00:42.629> in<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:42.929> bass

00:00:43.099 --> 00:00:43.109 
that the melody is actually in the bass

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:46.130 
that the melody is actually in the bass
line<00:00:43.699> which<00:00:44.699> is<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:45.030> two<00:00:45.239> strings<00:00:45.570> that<00:00:45.659> I'm

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
line which is the two strings that I'm

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.329 
line which is the two strings that I'm
missing<00:00:46.530> so<00:00:46.769> that<00:00:46.949> it<00:00:47.010> was<00:00:47.159> a<00:00:47.190> little

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:47.339 
missing so that it was a little

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:49.099 
missing so that it was a little
disconcerting<00:00:47.579> at<00:00:48.120> first<00:00:48.359> to<00:00:48.539> find<00:00:48.780> stuff

00:00:49.099 --> 00:00:49.109 
disconcerting at first to find stuff

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:51.709 
disconcerting at first to find stuff
that<00:00:49.320> was<00:00:49.469> working<00:00:49.859> but<00:00:50.369> all<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.939> rhythm<00:00:51.239> and

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
that was working but all the rhythm and

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.630 
that was working but all the rhythm and
all<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:54.500> totally<00:00:55.500> fit<00:00:55.739> great<00:00:56.039> on<00:00:56.339> the<00:00:56.430> youth

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
all the totally fit great on the youth

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.549 
all the totally fit great on the youth
as<00:00:56.909> well<00:00:57.180> as<00:00:57.359> some<00:00:57.750> of<00:00:57.839> the<00:00:57.869> thump<00:00:58.140> technique

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
as well as some of the thump technique

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.069 
as well as some of the thump technique
which<00:00:59.159> turned<00:00:59.609> out<00:00:59.820> being<00:01:00.179> very<00:01:00.629> helpful

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
which turned out being very helpful

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.499 
which turned out being very helpful
almost<00:01:01.799> in<00:01:01.979> bluegrass<00:01:02.399> since<00:01:02.939> I<00:01:03.179> was<00:01:03.299> doing

00:01:03.499 --> 00:01:03.509 
almost in bluegrass since I was doing

00:01:03.509 --> 00:01:11.359 
almost in bluegrass since I was doing
almost<00:01:03.629> a<00:01:03.839> hammer<00:01:04.049> claw<00:01:04.289> thing<00:01:10.159> that<00:01:11.159> worked

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
almost a hammer claw thing that worked

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.620 
almost a hammer claw thing that worked
wonderfully<00:01:12.500> as<00:01:13.500> long<00:01:13.740> as<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.340> top<00:01:15.270> end<00:01:15.479> was

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
wonderfully as long as the top end was

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.719 
wonderfully as long as the top end was
going<00:01:15.929> with<00:01:16.080> my<00:01:16.200> finger<00:01:19.190> when<00:01:20.190> I<00:01:20.280> started<00:01:20.610> to

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
going with my finger when I started to

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.279 
going with my finger when I started to
work<00:01:20.850> out<00:01:21.060> some<00:01:21.299> of<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.450> chord<00:01:21.720> patterns

00:01:22.279 --> 00:01:22.289 
work out some of the chord patterns

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:24.410 
work out some of the chord patterns
which<00:01:22.860> were<00:01:23.250> confusing<00:01:23.640> at<00:01:23.850> first<00:01:23.880> to<00:01:24.299> me

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
which were confusing at first to me

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.080 
which were confusing at first to me
because<00:01:24.600> when<00:01:24.750> you<00:01:24.840> play<00:01:24.990> a<00:01:25.459> D<00:01:26.459> on<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.819> guitar

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
because when you play a D on the guitar

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.940 
because when you play a D on the guitar
it's<00:01:27.299> actually<00:01:27.630> G<00:01:27.869> and<00:01:28.140> then<00:01:28.259> every<00:01:28.470> time<00:01:28.649> I

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
it's actually G and then every time I

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.320 
it's actually G and then every time I
was<00:01:29.190> reading<00:01:29.429> a<00:01:29.490> chart<00:01:29.700> I'd<00:01:29.880> be<00:01:30.000> playing<00:01:30.149> the

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:30.330 
was reading a chart I'd be playing the

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.649 
was reading a chart I'd be playing the
wrong<00:01:30.420> run<00:01:31.229> chords<00:01:31.679> over<00:01:31.830> and<00:01:32.009> over<00:01:32.299> but<00:01:33.299> for

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
wrong run chords over and over but for

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.649 
wrong run chords over and over but for
the<00:01:33.990> most<00:01:34.140> part<00:01:34.229> when<00:01:35.220> I<00:01:35.250> figured<00:01:35.700> out<00:01:35.819> that<00:01:35.880> if

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
the most part when I figured out that if

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.249 
the most part when I figured out that if
you<00:01:36.840> put<00:01:36.869> a<00:01:37.049> 5th<00:01:37.319> fret<00:01:38.149> capo<00:01:39.149> on<00:01:39.569> a<00:01:39.599> guitar<00:01:39.780> and

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
you put a 5th fret capo on a guitar and

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.869 
you put a 5th fret capo on a guitar and
then<00:01:40.470> take<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.739> two<00:01:40.890> strings<00:01:41.160> away<00:01:41.429> you're

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:41.879 
then take the two strings away you're

00:01:41.879 --> 00:01:43.880 
then take the two strings away you're
pretty<00:01:42.090> much<00:01:42.239> good<00:01:42.479> to<00:01:42.509> go<00:01:42.599> from<00:01:43.440> there<00:01:43.530> it<00:01:43.800> was

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
pretty much good to go from there it was

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.920 
pretty much good to go from there it was
great

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.480 

my<00:01:49.740> favorite<00:01:50.190> thing<00:01:50.400> in<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.640> world<00:01:50.880> to<00:01:51.180> learn

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
my favorite thing in the world to learn

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.250 
my favorite thing in the world to learn
the<00:01:53.490> relationship<00:01:54.120> between<00:01:54.690> your<00:01:54.930> hand<00:01:55.200> and

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:55.260 
the relationship between your hand and

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:56.540 
the relationship between your hand and
the<00:01:55.380> strings<00:01:55.650> it's<00:01:55.860> about<00:01:56.010> your<00:01:56.130> thumb<00:01:56.400> one

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:56.550

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:10.100 

arpeggios<00:02:08.240> most<00:02:09.240> classical<00:02:09.690> thing<00:02:09.840> you<00:02:09.960> can

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
arpeggios most classical thing you can

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.950 
arpeggios most classical thing you can
do<00:02:10.200> to<00:02:10.350> do<00:02:10.440> a<00:02:10.470> backward

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:14.960 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.900 

and<00:02:15.960> that<00:02:16.890> leads<00:02:17.190> to<00:02:17.310> everything<00:02:17.730> else<00:02:17.850> that

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
and that leads to everything else that

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.100 
and that leads to everything else that
you<00:02:18.090> need<00:02:18.240> to<00:02:18.330> know<00:02:18.450> whether<00:02:18.630> it's<00:02:18.840> a<00:02:18.900> bossa

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
you need to know whether it's a bossa

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:25.550 
you need to know whether it's a bossa
nova<00:02:19.230> strum<00:02:19.800> or<00:02:20.160> or<00:02:20.510> tremolo<00:02:24.080> all<00:02:25.080> that<00:02:25.290> stuff

nova strum or or tremolo all that stuff
comes<00:02:25.800> from<00:02:25.830> just<00:02:26.100> going<00:02:26.750> learning<00:02:27.750> where<00:02:27.900> the

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
comes from just going learning where the

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:29.810 
comes from just going learning where the
strings<00:02:28.260> are<00:02:28.470> and<00:02:29.040> letting<00:02:29.250> your<00:02:29.460> fingers

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
strings are and letting your fingers

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.220 
strings are and letting your fingers
walk<00:02:30.150> over<00:02:31.850> I<00:02:32.850> show<00:02:33.390> my<00:02:33.510> students<00:02:33.870> this<00:02:34.020> all

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
walk over I show my students this all

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.140 
walk over I show my students this all
the<00:02:34.380> time<00:02:34.590> even<00:02:35.190> the<00:02:35.430> bossa<00:02:35.580> nova<00:02:35.910> stuff

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
the time even the bossa nova stuff

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:46.850 
the time even the bossa nova stuff
you're<00:02:36.480> grabbing<00:02:36.660> the<00:02:36.840> strings<00:02:37.140> together<00:02:45.860> and

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
you're grabbing the strings together and

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.590 
you're grabbing the strings together and
that's<00:02:47.040> all<00:02:47.220> pretty<00:02:47.370> easy<00:02:47.640> stuff<00:02:48.030> as<00:02:48.210> long<00:02:48.420> as

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
that's all pretty easy stuff as long as

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.300 
that's all pretty easy stuff as long as
you<00:02:48.720> physically<00:02:49.710> can<00:02:49.890> feel<00:02:50.100> where<00:02:50.280> the

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
you physically can feel where the

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.190 
you physically can feel where the
strings<00:02:50.640> are<00:02:50.760> a<00:02:50.850> lot<00:02:51.000> of<00:02:51.090> people<00:02:51.300> end<00:02:51.630> up<00:02:51.780> doing

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
strings are a lot of people end up doing

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.200 
strings are a lot of people end up doing
a<00:02:52.290> lot<00:02:52.440> of<00:02:52.470> bouncy<00:02:53.010> stuff<00:02:53.280> when<00:02:53.820> you<00:02:53.910> keep<00:02:54.090> them

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:54.210 
a lot of bouncy stuff when you keep them

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:56.180 
a lot of bouncy stuff when you keep them
close<00:02:54.450> and<00:02:54.480> you<00:02:54.840> touch<00:02:55.050> them<00:02:55.260> that's<00:02:55.740> that's

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
close and you touch them that's that's

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.650 
close and you touch them that's that's
the<00:02:56.340> way<00:02:56.430> I<00:02:56.460> teach<00:02:56.580> is<00:02:57.090> to<00:02:57.150> learn<00:02:57.450> how<00:02:57.630> to

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
the way I teach is to learn how to

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.230 
the way I teach is to learn how to

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:17.490 
chord you're on I did write a couple of

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:18.890 
chord you're on I did write a couple of
songs<00:03:17.550> that<00:03:18.000> are<00:03:18.270> specifically<00:03:18.810> for

songs that are specifically for

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.510 
songs that are specifically for
reentrant<00:03:19.560> and<00:03:19.740> they<00:03:19.830> ended<00:03:20.010> up<00:03:20.160> kind<00:03:20.490> of

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:20.520 
reentrant and they ended up kind of

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.100 
reentrant and they ended up kind of
sounding<00:03:20.820> almost<00:03:20.970> Renaissance<00:03:21.600> like<00:03:21.870> lute

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
sounding almost Renaissance like lute

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.660 
sounding almost Renaissance like lute

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
for a drone sometimes and also against

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.200 
for a drone sometimes and also against
against<00:03:31.260> moving<00:03:31.500> part

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:34.210 

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:40.380
