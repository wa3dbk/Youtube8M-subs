00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:17.109 
mind I automatically sort those details

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:19.920 
mind I automatically sort those details
out<00:04:17.320> and<00:04:17.620> it's<00:04:18.250> like<00:04:18.430> oh<00:04:18.579> this<00:04:19.539> is<00:04:19.690> where<00:04:19.840> the

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930 
out and it's like oh this is where the

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:21.479 
out and it's like oh this is where the

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
guys are the sort of flow pattern is

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:23.700 
guys are the sort of flow pattern is
this<00:04:21.729> is<00:04:21.880> what<00:04:22.450> was<00:04:22.630> this<00:04:22.810> call-out<00:04:23.080> boom<00:04:23.470> I

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:23.710 
this is what was this call-out boom I

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:24.960 
this is what was this call-out boom I
mean<00:04:23.860> that's<00:04:23.979> pretty<00:04:24.250> much<00:04:24.310> the<00:04:24.370> extent<00:04:24.789> I

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:24.970 
mean that's pretty much the extent I

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:27.240 
mean that's pretty much the extent I
think<00:04:25.000> about<00:04:25.510> the<00:04:25.630> maps<00:04:25.870> or<00:04:26.680> games<00:04:27.039> in<00:04:27.220> general

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
think about the maps or games in general

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:30.480 
think about the maps or games in general
like<00:04:27.880> take<00:04:28.330> a<00:04:28.360> game<00:04:28.720> like<00:04:28.870> diablo<00:04:29.289> 3<00:04:29.590> I<00:04:29.770> don't

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
like take a game like diablo 3 I don't

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:31.810 
like take a game like diablo 3 I don't
look<00:04:30.610> at<00:04:30.729> the<00:04:30.789> background<00:04:31.210> environments

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:31.820 
look at the background environments

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:32.950 
look at the background environments
all<00:04:31.880> the<00:04:32.000> time<00:04:32.210> they<00:04:32.330> spent<00:04:32.570> the<00:04:32.660> veldt<00:04:32.840> in

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 
all the time they spent the veldt in

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.330 
all the time they spent the veldt in
that<00:04:33.080> back<00:04:33.200> rounded<00:04:33.350> environment<00:04:34.040> and<00:04:34.160> I

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
that back rounded environment and I

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.870 
that back rounded environment and I
automatically<00:04:35.090> just<00:04:35.360> phase<00:04:35.540> it<00:04:35.720> out<00:04:35.870> I<00:04:36.880> kind

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:37.880
