00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:14.059
 and we are in the week of 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:16.279
 xbox one launch and here's the first one 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:18.950
 review of titles from ninety for the 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:24.470
 long awaited console this is dead 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:26.599
 rising 3 and what to do when your own 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.760
 city ​​is completely invaded by 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:31.310
 zombies and we are only seven days of 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:34.100
 long before the army places it at 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:37.030
 soil is what you ask for nick ramos 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.030
 while trying to escape 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:45.710
 I have to get out of this city ​​the municipalities 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:47.120
 remo all before fleeing nick yes 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.070
 allies with a handful of characters 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.050
 eccentric and you see and it gets 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.730
 thicker while the events around 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.050
 to him they become more and more grotesque and 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.520
 out of mind 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.410
 just like in the other episodes of the 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:01.570
 series only that here it takes everything to a 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.570
 highest level chaotic and destructive 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.190
 immediately one of the jumps to the eye 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.960
 most important changes have been made 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.210
 the structure of the gameplay ie 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.100
 the suffocating time limit in which 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.170
 it was necessary to bring them to completion 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.910
 missions submissions if you want is 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.910
 was very much mitigated 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:31.580
 this aspect of the game has been a lot 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.990
 mitigated in the basic mode it is 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.910
 divided into eight chapters that go 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.130
 completed before the last one expires 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:39.110
 day the game proceeds along two tracks 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.580
 the quest is tied to the plot 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.160
 principal that do not expire 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.900
 thunderstorm except general week e 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.880
 optional ones that have a timer 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.980
 well in evidence but that is much less 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.050
 suffocating compared to the past rendering 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:53.450
 dead rising 3 much more similar to gta 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.710
 or an unhealthy and full free roaming 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.540
 of fights 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.280
 capcom however forgot about the fans 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.440
 of the first hour foreseeing sin 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.360
 from the beginning the nightmare mode that 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.220
 restores the fees to those typical of the 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.080
 series and which obliges the player to 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.510
 save only at set points e 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.220
 not where he believes he is not alone though 

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:12.830
 the less pressing given by the flow 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.570
 of the time in dead rising 3 nickels from bravo 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.490
 a mechanic can assemble items for 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:18.290
 create deadly absurd weapons 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:20.750
 but now he can do it wherever he needs it 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.730
 the same screens apply to 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.709
 the vehicles you park next to one another 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.650
 to the other they can be combined with 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:29.390
 truly pyrotechnic results born to rise 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.130
 level can also unlock new ones 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.900
 combos and skill points to see 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.550
 increase its characteristics and for 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.720
 being able to more easily combine with 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.640
 objects between them 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.680
 this causes dead rising 3 to become 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.540
 a real orgy of absurd weapons from 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.430
 continually assemble use as 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.560
 it is best believed giving the player 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.090
 a real and satisfying reason for 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.610
 go and look for as many screens 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.410
 possible submissions come 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.000
 collected by nick via mobile thanks 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.519
 one of the first characters that yes 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.709
 meet and more important are those 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:59.360
 connected to the psychos or humans 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:01.760
 survivors of the epidemic but they are 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.410
 completely crazy capcom va 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.060
 truly out of all logic and 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:07.790
 has at least a couple of characters 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.380
 that to define memorable is to say the least 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.420
 the others below these are all linked 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:12.709
 to survivors who once saved yes 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.360
 add to the nick party 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:15.110
 accompanying him until he does 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.880
 they die 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:18.320
 pity the game always asks us to 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.540
 find to bring back a series of objects 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.920
 or destroy a number of goals e 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.660
 if it were not for the carnival of 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.630
 massacre all around and for the 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.620
 lots of secrets hidden everywhere 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:29.550
 it would hardly be possible in the long run 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.650
 driven to continue to deal with it 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:33.570
 the map of dead rising 3 pales 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.430
 in front of that of gta 5 per 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:37.560
 dimensions there is the possibility of 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.510
 explore a myriad of interiors all 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.070
 decorated and furnished differently 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.410
 without forgetting that it is possible 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:45.210
 also explore it vertically since 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:47.640
 nick can climb a little everywhere for 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:49.440
 look for these and objects there is so much to 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.310
 in short, between main missions and 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.080
 secondary 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.000
 it is not difficult to imagine cultivating 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.800
 all the subquests and finding all the 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.390
 secrets can be spent up to over 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.950
 30 hours of play 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.900
 something far from trivial for a title 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.820
 of launching a new console without 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.920
 forget that there is also for the toughest 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:07.200
 the nightmare mode and the possibility 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.260
 to play online and the possibility of 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:12.060
 play online with another player 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:14.430
 definitely the successful implementation 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:16.230
 kinect the very precise voice commands 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.730
 in Italian they are used to navigate 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:20.010
 through all the menus and for the 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:21.600
 saves but also to play 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:23.640
 kinect is useful for recalling 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.040
 the attention of the zombies to provoke 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:27.720
 the taiko making them more vulnerable 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:29.430
 pronouncing pre-established sentences but also 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.770
 to manage the party by telling him if 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:33.990
 attack follow nic or rummage in 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:36.950
 backdrop to find food to eat or 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.950
 drinks really 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:43.790
 it is evident how the dry one is interested in 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:46.010
 a product halfway between new and 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:48.889
 old generation of consoles but when 

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:52.630
 on the screen there are thousands of zombies and 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:52.630
 all really spectacular 

00:04:56.569 --> 00:05:01.270
 we have to 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:03.370
 zombies are the real stars 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:05.080
 especially at night when you do 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:07.510
 even more aggressive and that make the 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:08.890
 game sometimes really distressing 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:10.660
 on the other hand cross one in the dark 

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:12.670
 road or sewer the only light 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:14.560
 flickering of a torch chased by a 

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:17.380
 Undead army is an experience 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:19.090
 really distressing funny depending 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:21.520
 of four hair on the stomach is the 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:23.470
 720 pixel resolution and one framerate 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.970
 which can go down to 20 frames 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:27.370
 per second when on the screen yes 

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:28.960
 unleash hell I 'm compromising that 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:30.490
 does not prevent you from fully enjoying 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:32.620
 what it allows the title the most 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:34.980
 rich in contents of the xbox launch 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:34.980
 one 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:49.900
 apart from the ocean of dead undead 

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:52.240
 rising 3 is perhaps not the launch title 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:54.250
 which drives xbox one more from the point of 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:55.720
 technical view but beyond this though 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:57.820
 so much to play 

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:59.170
 the os perdidos can be wandered for now 

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:01.090
 thanks to a well done title and 

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:02.620
 adrenaline that allows lovers 

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:06.600
 of free roaming to live an adventure 

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:06.600
 full of madness and blood 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:10.560
 wow 

00:06:11.219 --> 00:06:15.340
 let's face it we wouldn't have done it 

00:06:12.969 --> 00:06:17.590
 displease a greater variety of 

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:19.860
 quest but makes the arsenal available i 

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:22.150
 disguises in the many things to do 

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:24.159
 throwing yourself into this slaughter is one of the 

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:25.689
 things we recommend for the next 

00:06:24.159 --> 00:06:27.819
 22 November 

00:06:25.689 --> 00:06:29.740
 the fans of the saga certainly 

00:06:27.819 --> 00:06:32.650
 will appreciate us while we go to 

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:35.909
 see how polite dead rising is 36 

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:35.909
 the boss arrives 

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:55.080
 look look
