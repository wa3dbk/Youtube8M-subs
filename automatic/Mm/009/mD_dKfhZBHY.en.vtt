00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 hi today i have one for you 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:04.859
 tutorial of something I've been around for a while 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.120
 playing with it 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.670
 I was actually good at it 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.969
 you can find what I think it is 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:14.610
 I prefer or say no, no 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.770
 I say wrong that I think this is 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.320
 is the best when it comes to my head 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.840
 for fits and not just save indian 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.269
 people so I'm going to show you how 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:28.170
 slept tight can make her back 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:31.230
 without that it looks too fat or too 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.430
 too much to say, but it is whole 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.020
 very trendy you see a lot at the 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.820
 catwalk 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.380
 ai file I pour over a year or 2 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.050
 the catwalk sees so that says my shell 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.610
 put her sleek back 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.309
 sometimes you see with on the street I want me too 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.420
 sometimes ask on the street but sit 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.969
 quite intense 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.250
 and now I have some sort of dry 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.539
 dry hair play look and i hear too 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.399
 from floor 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.199
 my teachers' family that that's what 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.780
 what a little yes now 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.420
 so trendy is that you are not wet but dry 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.550
 backwards and is the practice I have this 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.229
 and try the tutorial video today 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.489
 I used to wash my hair and this 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.290
 is how it looks i've got it all 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.729
 nothing done I washed and on 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.860
 let the air dry 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:14.670
 so this is my natural hair shape 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.920
 it is very boring and actually closes 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.990
 and so if you want to wear it backwards 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.409
 no more back than you can of course 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.600
 do this so but remains completely 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.030
 don't mind that jokers will come crazy 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.070
 flap to the front and even though you brush 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.350
 behind it 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.210
 then of course it will not stay that way 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.390
 how to make sure it stays put 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.939
 and beautiful and stylish looks like you 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:42.720
 need is the following we start 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:44.579
 with the tools and hair dryer and hairbrush it 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.790
 preferably with soft hair a la mason 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:50.640
 pearson or and lookalike in or something with 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:55.200
 gentle harbor and proposes terms 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.200
 products and its oil and had to and and 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.880
 her stay 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.890
 the first thing you are going to do is preppen 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.439
 and i know i always do this i have 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:05.079
 here on toriel of even have concerns 

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:07.329
 sure your hair and something 

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:08.830
 leaving it in the model 

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:10.300
 what you create afterwards makes your hair 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.319
 somewhat thicker 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.840
 it ensures that we have that and for it 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:16.720
 is ready to style so shit not like that 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.459
 then it drops out after an hour of too 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.410
 not good but if you do then 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:21.760
 just stays solid all day long 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.769
 or place 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.200
 I mean the park with mouss and I add 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:28.120
 a little bit of oil little bit because 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.349
 oil makes hair very smooth and that is 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:39.280
 the effect we are going for is not 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:41.110
 fill the wax year very fat with the must 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.019
 I have my focus on the top and 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:46.260
 now I put a little oil in the bottom 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:46.260
 from her 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.440
 then in time to talk and it comes 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.630
 actually blow dry more on your hair with 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.130
 a soft brush 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.360
 it doesn't have to be very specific 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.020
 what they have my try it one 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.020
 a little smooth 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.140
 the forest you target I already brush it 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:12.090
 little spicy or I enjoy going forward 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.090
 but just behind it 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.950
 and don't talk the house as you have 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.130
 I've seen it on dry pleasant you 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:36.900
 can also just had her do it but me 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:39.750
 would say do it on wet hair if you like 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:43.110
 really curls have a wavy hair view 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:45.690
 for which one theme and if you 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:47.610
 just as I almost have straight hair than I can 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.500
 You also just have to do glasses for this 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.490
 that's how i do it every time 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.590
 then we will continue with the following 

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:54.690
 step here is already well behind 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:57.360
 then I'm going to style it now 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.980
 to the straightener and I stick half 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:01.790
 up and just adjust the tufts 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.790
 completely straight 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:16.310
 I've done the bottom up that's it 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:18.260
 very easiest actually and you take care of it 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:20.359
 before the hair goes back in this 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.980
 Imagine that he is 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:23.450
 set up that way and or now the 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:25.820
 top and most important thing is that you like this 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:27.800
 all backwards you can say so 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.920
 just brush it backwards 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.920
 then 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:42.639
 I have now postponed this is 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.740
 what it looks like and the final step 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:46.300
 in her spray and then it doesn't just go 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.380
 to win over it 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.509
 no i had a little a little bit 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:51.490
 apply and then gently brush on 

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:53.889
 and you brush that spray and watched you see 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:56.800
 here for example in it or celebrates may 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:57.910
 see here with your kind of hairs that 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:03.669
 sticking out 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:05.440
 what do you brush my brush like that and 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:06.849
 hair spray you do not make her person 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.069
 furthermore it just ensures that something 

00:05:06.849 --> 00:05:14.889
 stays in shape so you don't have to worry 

00:05:09.069 --> 00:05:16.060
 to be able to use something more so me 

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:17.800
 I learned from you during my education 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:19.810
 keep spraying a bunch of brush that had 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:22.060
 again hair spray away so I suggest stay 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:23.470
 you only have a little left over 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:29.620
 then do this just as long until it 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:31.120
 see how you want it to be 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:32.770
 already different from this what I just have 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.750
 done with spray and this 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:37.139
 you camp is good but just not 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:37.139
 perfect 

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:51.280
 and voila this is it that he is not there 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:54.610
 From it is from sludge to 

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:55.240
 and it just stays like 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:56.680
 you see 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:59.500
 Normally if you have an I do not want a helmet 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:01.300
 her but in this case it is not 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:04.240
 very if a bit hard this is not 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:06.699
 really hard but it stays that way 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:08.379
 and it looks dry so not greasy 

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:10.330
 or crazy or so it just 

00:06:08.379 --> 00:06:12.220
 well cared for and my favorite way around this 

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:13.840
 to wear the moisture is a bright lips 

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:14.860
 and well give what you see now this whole 

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:17.020
 good 

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:19.900
 and yes this is really something very now 

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:21.940
 is in and this is and when you get me right 

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:23.349
 works and I hope you like it 

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:24.699
 liked thanks for watching and 

00:06:23.349 --> 00:06:26.979
 see you again soon 

00:06:24.699 --> 00:06:28.810
 goodbye hi i just got back from 

00:06:26.979 --> 00:06:31.720
 vacation and I am now something for me 

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:35.020
 Brown and I was busy with makeup and 

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:37.139
