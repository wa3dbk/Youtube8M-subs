00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
he has won the raid and now we can end

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:34.949

it<00:03:33.579> but<00:03:33.940> icing<00:03:34.209> and<00:03:34.299> see<00:03:34.480> since<00:03:34.690> he<00:03:34.840> isn't

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
it but icing and see since he isn't

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:36.569 
it but icing and see since he isn't
tight<00:03:35.260> in<00:03:35.440> three<00:03:35.650> he<00:03:35.829> is<00:03:35.859> actually<00:03:36.070> attacking

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:36.579 
tight in three he is actually attacking

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:38.940 
tight in three he is actually attacking
someone<00:03:36.940> in<00:03:37.120> Champions<00:03:37.810> three<00:03:38.140> so<00:03:38.620> he<00:03:38.709> won't

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
someone in Champions three so he won't

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:40.860 
someone in Champions three so he won't
probably<00:03:39.220> get<00:03:39.489> a<00:03:39.519> lot<00:03:39.790> of<00:03:39.820> trophies<00:03:40.329> from<00:03:40.660> this

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870
