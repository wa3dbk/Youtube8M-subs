hi<00:00:02.460> everyone<00:00:02.820> today's<00:00:03.510> topic<00:00:04.049> is<00:00:04.080> going<00:00:04.410> to<00:00:04.470> be

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
hi everyone today's topic is going to be

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:07.070 
hi everyone today's topic is going to be
protein<00:00:05.069> I'm<00:00:05.549> just<00:00:06.000> going<00:00:06.180> to<00:00:06.270> briefly<00:00:06.569> talk

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
protein I'm just going to briefly talk

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.900 
protein I'm just going to briefly talk
about<00:00:07.140> it<00:00:07.529> because<00:00:07.799> it's<00:00:07.980> such<00:00:08.130> a<00:00:08.160> huge<00:00:08.550> topic

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
about it because it's such a huge topic

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.080 
about it because it's such a huge topic
and<00:00:09.420> I<00:00:10.170> just<00:00:10.500> have<00:00:10.679> time<00:00:10.889> just<00:00:10.920> to<00:00:11.370> cover<00:00:11.849> the

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
and I just have time just to cover the

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.299 
and I just have time just to cover the
basis<00:00:12.570> so<00:00:12.990> there's<00:00:13.740> a<00:00:13.769> couple<00:00:13.980> key<00:00:14.280> things

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
basis so there's a couple key things

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.689 
basis so there's a couple key things
that<00:00:14.700> I<00:00:14.880> want<00:00:15.269> to<00:00:15.330> talk<00:00:15.509> about<00:00:15.540> so<00:00:16.699> protein

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
that I want to talk about so protein

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.970 
that I want to talk about so protein
it's<00:00:17.970> important<00:00:18.630> it's<00:00:18.779> essential<00:00:19.680> to<00:00:19.859> our

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
it's important it's essential to our

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.160 
it's important it's essential to our
body<00:00:20.279> it<00:00:20.609> is<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:21.150> building<00:00:21.330> blocks<00:00:21.720> of<00:00:22.050> our

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
body it is the building blocks of our

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.490 
body it is the building blocks of our
body<00:00:22.380> it<00:00:22.680> is<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:23.670> protein<00:00:24.539> creates<00:00:24.960> muscles

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
body it is the protein creates muscles

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.429 
body it is the protein creates muscles
in<00:00:25.590> our<00:00:25.680> body<00:00:25.740> and<00:00:26.130> don't<00:00:27.090> forget<00:00:27.630> muscle

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
in our body and don't forget muscle

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.220 
in our body and don't forget muscle
burns<00:00:28.800> calories<00:00:29.310> so<00:00:30.090> it's<00:00:30.269> really<00:00:30.510> important

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
burns calories so it's really important

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.979 
burns calories so it's really important
that<00:00:31.289> we<00:00:31.500> get<00:00:31.650> protein<00:00:32.130> in<00:00:32.630> protein<00:00:33.630> is<00:00:33.780> very

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
that we get protein in protein is very

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.750 
that we get protein in protein is very
good<00:00:34.290> there's<00:00:35.040> a<00:00:35.160> number<00:00:35.520> of<00:00:35.670> different

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
good there's a number of different

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.910 
good there's a number of different
sources<00:00:36.329> that<00:00:36.630> you<00:00:36.750> can<00:00:36.930> get<00:00:37.050> protein<00:00:37.410> from<00:00:37.469> I

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
sources that you can get protein from I

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.119 
sources that you can get protein from I
know<00:00:38.579> that<00:00:39.000> a<00:00:39.030> lot<00:00:39.120> of<00:00:39.329> you<00:00:39.600> want<00:00:39.989> to<00:00:40.170> just<00:00:40.410> make

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
know that a lot of you want to just make

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.790 
know that a lot of you want to just make
yourself<00:00:41.550> a<00:00:41.640> protein<00:00:42.030> shake<00:00:42.320> which<00:00:43.320> is<00:00:43.500> fine

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
yourself a protein shake which is fine

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.520 
yourself a protein shake which is fine
if<00:00:44.129> you<00:00:44.430> get<00:00:44.610> a<00:00:44.640> good<00:00:44.879> protein<00:00:45.270> shake<00:00:45.719> that<00:00:46.260> has

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
if you get a good protein shake that has

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.360 
if you get a good protein shake that has
a<00:00:46.559> lot<00:00:46.860> of<00:00:46.920> really<00:00:47.340> good<00:00:48.000> ingredients<00:00:48.180> and

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
a lot of really good ingredients and

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.340 
a lot of really good ingredients and
doesn't<00:00:50.370> have<00:00:50.489> any<00:00:50.610> hidden<00:00:50.850> sugars<00:00:51.199> so<00:00:52.199> make

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
doesn't have any hidden sugars so make

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.869 
doesn't have any hidden sugars so make
sure<00:00:52.379> you<00:00:52.649> watch<00:00:52.890> your<00:00:53.160> protein<00:00:53.579> shake

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
sure you watch your protein shake

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.130 
sure you watch your protein shake
ingredients<00:00:55.850> the<00:00:56.850> problem<00:00:57.449> I<00:00:57.719> have<00:00:57.780> with

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
ingredients the problem I have with

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.490 
ingredients the problem I have with
protein<00:00:58.649> shakes<00:00:58.920> is<00:00:59.309> that<00:01:00.210> it<00:01:00.510> is<00:01:00.960> processed

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
protein shakes is that it is processed

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.219 
protein shakes is that it is processed
to<00:01:02.309> some<00:01:02.579> degree<00:01:02.789> and<00:01:03.329> whenever<00:01:03.629> you<00:01:03.989> have<00:01:04.170> a

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
to some degree and whenever you have a

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.740 
to some degree and whenever you have a
processed<00:01:04.860> food<00:01:04.860> to<00:01:05.850> some<00:01:06.060> degree<00:01:06.210> you<00:01:06.450> don't

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
processed food to some degree you don't

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.200 
processed food to some degree you don't
know<00:01:07.020> what<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:08.100> steps<00:01:08.400> went<00:01:08.790> through<00:01:09.030> to

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
know what the steps went through to

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.560 
know what the steps went through to
process<00:01:09.720> it<00:01:09.930> so<00:01:10.460> although<00:01:11.460> I<00:01:11.700> do<00:01:11.909> drink

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
process it so although I do drink

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.070 
process it so although I do drink
protein<00:01:12.840> shakes<00:01:13.520> occasionally<00:01:14.520> I<00:01:15.360> don't<00:01:15.960> do

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
protein shakes occasionally I don't do

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.960 
protein shakes occasionally I don't do
it<00:01:16.170> every<00:01:16.380> day<00:01:16.409> I<00:01:16.920> mostly<00:01:17.430> do<00:01:17.610> it<00:01:17.700> when<00:01:17.820> I'm

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
it every day I mostly do it when I'm

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.499 
it every day I mostly do it when I'm
done<00:01:18.150> with<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.390> workout<00:01:18.780> I<00:01:19.080> always<00:01:20.150> try<00:01:21.150> and

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
done with the workout I always try and

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.270 
done with the workout I always try and
get<00:01:21.720> my<00:01:21.869> protein<00:01:22.049> from<00:01:22.409> other<00:01:22.619> sources<00:01:22.860> which

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
get my protein from other sources which

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.890 
get my protein from other sources which
I'll<00:01:23.460> talk<00:01:23.640> about<00:01:23.700> in<00:01:24.000> a<00:01:24.240> minute<00:01:24.360> so<00:01:24.659> I<00:01:24.689> just

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
I'll talk about in a minute so I just

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.890 
I'll talk about in a minute so I just
want<00:01:25.110> you<00:01:25.200> just<00:01:25.350> to<00:01:25.439> think<00:01:25.680> about<00:01:26.390> your<00:01:27.390> amount

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
want you just to think about your amount

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.160 
want you just to think about your amount
of<00:01:28.110> protein<00:01:28.320> shakes<00:01:28.770> you<00:01:29.009> drink<00:01:29.340> in<00:01:29.579> a<00:01:29.880> week<00:01:30.170> or

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
of protein shakes you drink in a week or

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.890 
of protein shakes you drink in a week or
mixing<00:01:31.650> your<00:01:31.770> Greek<00:01:32.040> yogurt<00:01:32.630> whatever<00:01:33.630> it<00:01:33.780> is

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
mixing your Greek yogurt whatever it is

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.539 
mixing your Greek yogurt whatever it is
you<00:01:34.020> do<00:01:34.170> when<00:01:34.530> you<00:01:34.619> get<00:01:34.740> your<00:01:34.799> protein<00:01:35.040> shakes

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
you do when you get your protein shakes

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.789 
you do when you get your protein shakes
in<00:01:35.759> that<00:01:36.450> it's<00:01:36.630> it's<00:01:36.930> good<00:01:37.290> as<00:01:37.409> long<00:01:37.439> as<00:01:37.710> you

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
in that it's it's good as long as you

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.859 
in that it's it's good as long as you
have<00:01:37.890> a<00:01:37.979> good<00:01:38.130> protein<00:01:38.490> shake<00:01:38.790> but<00:01:39.150> it's

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
have a good protein shake but it's

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.840 
have a good protein shake but it's
better<00:01:40.020> to<00:01:40.470> get<00:01:40.619> it<00:01:40.770> from<00:01:41.009> from<00:01:41.400> natural

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
better to get it from from natural

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.870 
better to get it from from natural
sources<00:01:41.880> rather<00:01:42.600> than<00:01:42.990> man-made<00:01:43.979> sources<00:01:44.460> or

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
sources rather than man-made sources or

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.429 
sources rather than man-made sources or
process<00:01:45.390> sources<00:01:46.430> um<00:01:47.689> the<00:01:48.689> couple<00:01:49.079> of<00:01:49.200> things

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
process sources um the couple of things

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.560 
process sources um the couple of things
that<00:01:49.770> you<00:01:50.610> know<00:01:50.759> I<00:01:50.790> talk<00:01:51.090> about<00:01:51.119> what's

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
that you know I talk about what's

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.240 
that you know I talk about what's
getting<00:01:51.840> protein<00:01:52.140> and<00:01:52.470> from<00:01:52.649> natural<00:01:53.220> sources

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
getting protein and from natural sources

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.810 
getting protein and from natural sources
is<00:01:53.820> a<00:01:54.780> lot<00:01:55.079> of<00:01:55.229> you<00:01:55.350> think<00:01:55.619> okay<00:01:56.100> i<00:01:56.130> need<00:01:56.430> to<00:01:56.700> get

is a lot of you think okay i need to get

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.240 
is a lot of you think okay i need to get
my<00:01:56.880> protein<00:01:57.210> in<00:01:57.600> i<00:01:57.810> need<00:01:58.049> to<00:01:58.170> eat<00:01:58.740> a<00:01:58.770> chicken

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
my protein in i need to eat a chicken

those<00:02:02.369> are<00:02:02.520> all<00:02:02.549> really<00:02:02.820> great<00:02:03.299> sources<00:02:03.780> for

vegetables and getting your protein that
way<00:03:25.850> over<00:03:26.420> a<00:03:26.660> meat<00:03:27.530> source<00:03:27.860> and<00:03:28.220> especially

over a protein source is definitely the

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.210 
over a protein source is definitely the

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
way to go vegetables have way more

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.870 
way to go vegetables have way more
higher<00:03:34.670> nutrients<00:03:35.330> and<00:03:36.400> and<00:03:37.400> it's<00:03:37.700> just

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 
higher nutrients and and it's just

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.720 
higher nutrients and and it's just
really<00:03:38.120> good<00:03:38.360> source<00:03:38.630> of<00:03:38.810> protein<00:03:38.990> so<00:03:39.730> when

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
really good source of protein so when

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:42.760 
really good source of protein so when
you<00:03:40.850> are<00:03:40.880> counting<00:03:41.630> your<00:03:41.720> protein<00:03:42.230> and<00:03:42.440> adding

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:42.770 
you are counting your protein and adding

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:46.120 
you are counting your protein and adding
up<00:03:42.890> your<00:03:43.070> daily<00:03:43.430> protein<00:03:43.820> intake<00:03:44.890> that's<00:03:45.890> the
