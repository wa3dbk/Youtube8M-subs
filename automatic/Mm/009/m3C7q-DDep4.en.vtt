whoa all right when you unbox this thing
you<00:00:21.320> want<00:00:21.470> to<00:00:21.500> be<00:00:21.560> careful<00:00:21.740> because<00:00:22.010> there's

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:22.369 
you want to be careful because there's

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:24.160 
you want to be careful because there's
carbon<00:00:22.700> rods<00:00:23.030> in<00:00:23.390> there<00:00:23.570> I<00:00:23.600> always<00:00:23.900> forget

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:24.170 
carbon rods in there I always forget

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:25.450 
carbon rods in there I always forget
they're<00:00:24.380> in<00:00:24.470> there<00:00:24.680> and<00:00:24.830> it's<00:00:24.980> like<00:00:25.100> booby

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:25.460 
they're in there and it's like booby

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:30.349 
it's the only way to get them in the box

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:32.380 
it's the only way to get them in the box
alright<00:00:31.250> we're<00:00:31.490> going<00:00:31.550> to<00:00:31.670> take<00:00:31.820> a<00:00:31.849> look<00:00:32.090> at

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:50.780 
kit and a lot of good stuff this is our

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.990 
kit and a lot of good stuff this is our
main<00:00:50.930> fuselage<00:00:51.649> everything<00:00:52.370> gets<00:00:52.579> glued

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 
main fuselage everything gets glued

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.420 
main fuselage everything gets glued
together<00:00:53.360> it<00:00:54.079> is<00:00:54.260> cut<00:00:54.559> and<00:00:54.649> separating<00:00:55.280> it's

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:55.430 
together it is cut and separating it's

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.130 
together it is cut and separating it's
nice<00:00:55.610> because<00:00:55.820> you<00:00:55.910> can<00:00:56.000> hack<00:00:56.329> out<00:00:56.570> for<00:00:56.989> your

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
nice because you can hack out for your

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.560 
nice because you can hack out for your
battery<00:00:57.320> bay<00:00:57.800> you've<00:00:58.100> got<00:00:58.250> lots<00:00:58.460> of<00:00:58.640> space<00:00:58.880> as

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
battery bay you've got lots of space as

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.420 
battery bay you've got lots of space as
well<00:00:59.840> for<00:01:00.079> putting<00:01:00.290> all<00:01:00.500> your<00:01:00.530> gear<00:01:00.980> in<00:01:01.040> and

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
well for putting all your gear in and

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.459 
well for putting all your gear in and
then<00:01:01.850> the<00:01:01.969> nose<00:01:02.149> cap<00:01:02.510> and<00:01:02.750> cone<00:01:02.930> gets<00:01:03.230> sealed

00:01:03.459 --> 00:01:03.469 
then the nose cap and cone gets sealed

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:06.820 
then the nose cap and cone gets sealed
up<00:01:03.729> black<00:01:04.729> is<00:01:04.910> pretty<00:01:05.210> slick<00:01:05.600> so<00:01:06.560> we've<00:01:06.680> got

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830 
up black is pretty slick so we've got

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:08.889 
up black is pretty slick so we've got
our<00:01:06.860> carbon<00:01:07.369> rods<00:01:07.580> we've<00:01:08.030> got<00:01:08.149> our<00:01:08.270> tail<00:01:08.570> and

00:01:08.889 --> 00:01:08.899 
our carbon rods we've got our tail and

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:11.020 
our carbon rods we've got our tail and
then<00:01:09.440> you're<00:01:10.160> probably<00:01:10.280> wondering<00:01:10.820> if<00:01:10.910> you

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
then you're probably wondering if you

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:12.430 
then you're probably wondering if you
open<00:01:11.270> this<00:01:11.300> kit<00:01:11.660> while<00:01:11.899> you've<00:01:12.050> got<00:01:12.080> three

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:12.440 
open this kit while you've got three

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.529 
open this kit while you've got three
tail<00:01:12.649> section<00:01:13.160> well<00:01:13.310> Alex<00:01:13.940> thought<00:01:14.180> ahead<00:01:14.300> of

00:01:14.529 --> 00:01:14.539 
tail section well Alex thought ahead of

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:16.690 
tail section well Alex thought ahead of
time<00:01:14.720> and<00:01:15.280> anticipated<00:01:16.280> that<00:01:16.340> you<00:01:16.460> might

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
time and anticipated that you might

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.070 
time and anticipated that you might
crash<00:01:16.970> and<00:01:17.240> mess<00:01:17.360> when<00:01:17.570> up<00:01:17.690> so<00:01:17.810> you<00:01:17.899> got<00:01:18.050> it

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
crash and mess when up so you got it

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.290 
crash and mess when up so you got it
back<00:01:18.320> up<00:01:18.530> and<00:01:18.680> here<00:01:19.430> we<00:01:19.550> go<00:01:19.580> we've<00:01:19.910> got<00:01:19.940> our<00:01:20.270> uh

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:20.300 
back up and here we go we've got our uh

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.120 
back up and here we go we've got our uh
our<00:01:20.690> booms<00:01:21.110> you're<00:01:21.350> just<00:01:21.470> going<00:01:21.590> to<00:01:21.649> pop<00:01:21.890> these

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
our booms you're just going to pop these

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.460 
our booms you're just going to pop these
out<00:01:22.429> of<00:01:22.490> the<00:01:23.209> epp<00:01:24.140> and<00:01:24.880> start<00:01:25.880> installation

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:26.470 
out of the epp and start installation

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.609 
out of the epp and start installation
the<00:01:27.470> kit<00:01:27.709> also<00:01:27.950> comes<00:01:28.220> with<00:01:28.720> blue<00:01:29.720> hardware

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
the kit also comes with blue hardware

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:32.469 
the kit also comes with blue hardware
motor<00:01:31.039> mount<00:01:31.369> everything<00:01:32.179> you<00:01:32.270> need

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
motor mount everything you need

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:35.710 
motor mount everything you need
basically<00:01:32.929> to<00:01:33.229> get<00:01:33.440> set<00:01:33.770> up<00:01:33.800> here<00:01:34.009> and<00:01:34.720> it's

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 
basically to get set up here and it's

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.800 
basically to get set up here and it's
got<00:01:35.990> control<00:01:36.319> horns<00:01:36.950> and<00:01:37.220> in<00:01:38.000> our<00:01:38.360> custom

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
got control horns and in our custom

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:39.969 
got control horns and in our custom
builds<00:01:39.170> and<00:01:39.289> what<00:01:39.380> we're<00:01:39.560> doing<00:01:39.590> I<00:01:39.920> don't

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:39.979 
builds and what we're doing I don't

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:41.440 
builds and what we're doing I don't
really<00:01:40.310> recommend<00:01:40.640> it<00:01:40.849> the<00:01:41.060> mounting

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
really recommend it the mounting

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.660 
really recommend it the mounting
hardware<00:01:41.630> to<00:01:42.050> mount<00:01:42.200> the<00:01:42.470> wing<00:01:42.770> or<00:01:43.340> i<00:01:43.369> should

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
hardware to mount the wing or i should

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.910 
hardware to mount the wing or i should
say<00:01:43.849> mount<00:01:44.330> the<00:01:44.450> fuselage<00:01:44.959> to<00:01:45.349> the<00:01:45.500> wing<00:01:45.709> and

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
say mount the fuselage to the wing and

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.650 
say mount the fuselage to the wing and
bolt<00:01:46.160> it<00:01:46.250> in<00:01:46.369> place<00:01:46.610> we<00:01:46.819> recommend<00:01:47.300> gluing

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:47.660 
bolt it in place we recommend gluing

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:49.870 
bolt it in place we recommend gluing
everything<00:01:47.780> seems<00:01:48.470> to<00:01:48.560> do<00:01:48.740> a<00:01:48.770> lot<00:01:49.039> better<00:01:49.250> but

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
everything seems to do a lot better but

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.609 
everything seems to do a lot better but
if<00:01:50.060> you<00:01:50.209> want<00:01:50.390> to<00:01:50.420> have<00:01:50.569> the<00:01:50.720> capability<00:01:51.590> to

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 
if you want to have the capability to

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:55.150 
if you want to have the capability to
