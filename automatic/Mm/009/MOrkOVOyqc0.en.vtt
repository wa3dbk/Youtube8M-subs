00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.630 
think it's important on Erica standpoint
of<00:03:09.970> our<00:03:10.060> kids<00:03:10.269> learning<00:03:10.720> a<00:03:11.019> system<00:03:11.560> and<00:03:11.829> when

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
of our kids learning a system and when

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.099 
of our kids learning a system and when
we<00:03:12.730> get<00:03:12.819> into<00:03:12.970> the<00:03:13.209> huddle<00:03:13.390> we<00:03:13.510> call<00:03:13.810> our

we get into the huddle we call our

we get into the huddle we call our
offensive<00:03:14.829> pass<00:03:15.310> plays<00:03:15.700> they're<00:03:16.690> learning

the<00:03:17.200> coverages<00:03:17.709> gets<00:03:18.519> three<00:03:18.970> different

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
the coverages gets three different

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.420 
the coverages gets three different
opponents<00:03:20.079> every<00:03:20.350> week<00:03:20.500> and<00:03:20.709> I<00:03:21.069> think<00:03:21.280> that's

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
opponents every week and I think that's

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:22.949 
opponents every week and I think that's
huge<00:03:21.700> because<00:03:21.790> different<00:03:22.329> people<00:03:22.510> run

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
huge because different people run

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:24.330 
huge because different people run
different<00:03:23.319> systems<00:03:23.709> and<00:03:23.890> run<00:03:24.010> different

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
different systems and run different

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.789 
different systems and run different
routes<00:03:24.569> they<00:03:25.569> run<00:03:25.750> different<00:03:26.079> coverages<00:03:26.470> I

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:26.799 
routes they run different coverages I

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:28.440 
routes they run different coverages I
think<00:03:27.160> it's<00:03:27.280> good<00:03:27.519> for<00:03:27.549> everybody<00:03:27.850> involved

see how your players match up to the
speed<00:03:59.560> so<00:03:59.800> I<00:03:59.830> mean<00:04:00.040> that<00:04:00.190> 707<00:04:00.880> is<00:04:00.940> great<00:04:01.209> I

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:01.239 
speed so I mean that 707 is great I

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:03.059 
speed so I mean that 707 is great I
think<00:04:01.420> across<00:04:01.720> the<00:04:01.900> country<00:04:02.410> it's<00:04:02.860> really

00:04:03.059 --> 00:04:03.069 
think across the country it's really

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:05.790 
think across the country it's really
taken<00:04:03.430> off<00:04:03.520> the<00:04:03.670> last<00:04:03.819> 15<00:04:04.300> 16<00:04:04.660> years<00:04:05.050> and<00:04:05.590> it

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:05.800 
taken off the last 15 16 years and it

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.020 
taken off the last 15 16 years and it
helps<00:04:06.040> you<00:04:06.130> develop<00:04:06.280> your<00:04:06.519> kids<00:04:06.790> in<00:04:06.970> the

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
helps you develop your kids in the

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:08.190 
helps you develop your kids in the
summer<00:04:07.269> and<00:04:07.360> it<00:04:07.480> gives<00:04:07.630> a<00:04:07.690> chance<00:04:07.720> for<00:04:08.019> the

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 
summer and it gives a chance for the

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.600 
summer and it gives a chance for the
kids<00:04:08.380> to<00:04:08.470> get<00:04:08.590> out<00:04:08.739> and<00:04:08.860> do<00:04:08.950> something<00:04:08.980> in<00:04:09.370> some

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:09.610 
kids to get out and do something in some

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:11.580 
kids to get out and do something in some
also<00:04:10.000> personally<00:04:10.630> I<00:04:10.690> think<00:04:10.720> our<00:04:11.050> team<00:04:11.260> showed

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
also personally I think our team showed

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.380 
also personally I think our team showed
some<00:04:11.800> makes<00:04:12.220> them<00:04:12.340> step<00:04:12.580> forward<00:04:12.970> because<00:04:13.269> we

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:13.390 
some makes them step forward because we

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:15.360 
some makes them step forward because we
had<00:04:13.480> a<00:04:13.510> long<00:04:13.750> way<00:04:13.900> to<00:04:13.959> go<00:04:14.140> with<00:04:14.739> all<00:04:14.980> the

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
had a long way to go with all the

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.580 
had a long way to go with all the
offensive<00:04:15.970> skill<00:04:16.269> kids<00:04:16.630> would<00:04:16.810> work<00:04:17.049> we're

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:17.590 
offensive skill kids would work we're

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.140 
offensive skill kids would work we're
not<00:04:17.769> there<00:04:18.370> last<00:04:18.669> year<00:04:18.790> they<00:04:19.090> were

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
not there last year they were

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:20.490 
not there last year they were
inexperienced<00:04:19.600> and<00:04:19.900> whatnot<00:04:20.169> so<00:04:20.200> we're

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
inexperienced and whatnot so we're

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.100 
inexperienced and whatnot so we're
starting<00:04:20.889> off<00:04:20.950> new<00:04:21.220> it's<00:04:21.430> like<00:04:21.549> teaching<00:04:21.760> a<00:04:22.389> JV

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
starting off new it's like teaching a JV

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.020 
starting off new it's like teaching a JV
team<00:04:23.320> the<00:04:23.530> plays<00:04:23.770> and<00:04:23.800> whatnot<00:04:24.310> so<00:04:24.790> that's

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 
team the plays and whatnot so that's
