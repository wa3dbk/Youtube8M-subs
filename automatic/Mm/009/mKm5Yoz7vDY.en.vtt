you've got a hole and then you've got

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.370 
you've got a hole and then you've got
this<00:01:16.830> patch<00:01:17.070> sitting<00:01:17.460> over<00:01:17.640> top<00:01:17.670> of<00:01:18.030> it<00:01:18.150> and<00:01:18.689> it

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
I found that to be a problem with the

that I use the patch is on I followed

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.920 
that I use the patch is on I followed
the<00:01:29.369> stick<00:01:29.640> and<00:01:29.790> flick<00:01:30.060> rules<00:01:31.280> instructions

backing stick to shoe and apply pressure

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:49.039 
backing stick to shoe and apply pressure
and<00:01:43.979> go<00:01:44.159> skate<00:01:45.590> it<00:01:46.590> worked<00:01:47.689> but<00:01:48.689> it<00:01:48.750> could<00:01:48.930> have

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
and go skate it worked but it could have

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.950 
and go skate it worked but it could have
worked<00:01:49.229> better<00:01:50.119> what<00:01:51.119> I<00:01:51.149> would<00:01:51.360> suggest<00:01:51.570> doing

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
worked better what I would suggest doing

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.289 
worked better what I would suggest doing
is<00:01:52.369> obviously<00:01:53.369> you<00:01:53.549> still<00:01:53.729> need<00:01:53.909> to<00:01:54.000> clean<00:01:54.119> the

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299

is obviously you still need to clean the
shoe<00:01:54.450> it's<00:01:54.630> it's<00:01:55.200> really<00:01:55.500> really<00:01:56.040> sticky

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.230 
adhesive I was actually really impressed
with<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:59.009> level<00:01:59.310> of<00:01:59.520> quality<00:01:59.729> in<00:02:00.149> the

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
with the level of quality in the

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.950 
with the level of quality in the
adhesive<00:02:00.719> and<00:02:01.520> it<00:02:02.520> will<00:02:02.670> stick<00:02:02.969> but<00:02:03.719> the<00:02:03.780> thing

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
adhesive and it will stick but the thing

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.410 
adhesive and it will stick but the thing
is<00:02:03.990> because<00:02:04.409> this<00:02:04.590> suede<00:02:04.890> is<00:02:05.159> so<00:02:05.399> thick<00:02:05.790> every

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
is because this suede is so thick every

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.529 
is because this suede is so thick every
time<00:02:06.600> you<00:02:06.689> do<00:02:06.780> a<00:02:06.810> flip<00:02:07.110> trick<00:02:07.789> it<00:02:08.789> tries<00:02:09.360> to

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
time you do a flip trick it tries to

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.330 
time you do a flip trick it tries to
catch<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:09.899> edge<00:02:10.020> of<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:10.259> suede<00:02:10.590> so<00:02:11.099> you<00:02:11.190> need

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
catch the edge of the suede so you need

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.670 
catch the edge of the suede so you need
to<00:02:11.430> trim<00:02:11.819> the<00:02:12.060> edges<00:02:12.180> of<00:02:12.540> the<00:02:12.629> suede

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
to trim the edges of the suede

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.740 
to trim the edges of the suede
an<00:02:13.859> angle<00:02:14.280> maybe<00:02:14.519> sand<00:02:15.030> it<00:02:15.180> down<00:02:15.209> and<00:02:15.390> do

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
an angle maybe sand it down and do

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:16.970 
an angle maybe sand it down and do
whatever<00:02:15.900> you<00:02:16.109> need<00:02:16.170> to<00:02:16.349> do<00:02:16.500> to<00:02:16.620> get<00:02:16.709> it<00:02:16.859> so

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
whatever you need to do to get it so

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.619 
whatever you need to do to get it so
that<00:02:17.129> there's<00:02:17.310> not<00:02:17.549> so<00:02:17.879> much<00:02:18.000> of<00:02:18.060> a<00:02:18.209> lip<00:02:18.450> on

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:18.629 
that there's not so much of a lip on

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:20.630 
that there's not so much of a lip on
there<00:02:18.870> for<00:02:19.500> your<00:02:19.590> griptape<00:02:19.950> to<00:02:20.129> catch<00:02:20.340> every

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
there for your griptape to catch every

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.649 
there for your griptape to catch every
time<00:02:20.790> you<00:02:20.879> do<00:02:20.969> a<00:02:21.000> flip<00:02:21.239> trick<00:02:22.489> and<00:02:23.659> they

00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:24.659 
time you do a flip trick and they

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:27.170 
time you do a flip trick and they
they've<00:02:25.439> kind<00:02:25.650> of<00:02:25.769> mentioned<00:02:26.099> it<00:02:26.219> in<00:02:26.370> videos

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
they've kind of mentioned it in videos

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.599 
they've kind of mentioned it in videos
or<00:02:27.650> something<00:02:28.650> I'm<00:02:28.739> not<00:02:28.769> sure<00:02:29.099> where<00:02:29.340> I<00:02:29.370> heard

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:29.609 
or something I'm not sure where I heard

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:31.129 
or something I'm not sure where I heard
it<00:02:29.730> but<00:02:29.819> somebody<00:02:30.150> suggested<00:02:30.659> sanding<00:02:31.049> the

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:31.139 
it but somebody suggested sanding the

00:02:31.139 --> 00:02:34.399 
it but somebody suggested sanding the
edges<00:02:31.170> and<00:02:31.849> I<00:02:32.849> didn't<00:02:33.659> think<00:02:33.780> about<00:02:33.959> it<00:02:34.079> until

00:02:34.399 --> 00:02:34.409 
edges and I didn't think about it until

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:35.509 
edges and I didn't think about it until
I<00:02:34.469> already<00:02:34.739> had<00:02:34.859> him<00:02:35.010> on<00:02:35.099> my<00:02:35.189> shoe<00:02:35.370> and<00:02:35.459> I

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
I already had him on my shoe and I

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:36.500 
I already had him on my shoe and I
wasn't<00:02:35.730> gonna<00:02:35.879> peel<00:02:36.060> it<00:02:36.120> off<00:02:36.269> and<00:02:36.389> try<00:02:36.480> to

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
wasn't gonna peel it off and try to

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:43.550 
wasn't gonna peel it off and try to
stick<00:02:36.750> it<00:02:36.900> back<00:02:36.930> on<00:02:38.269> so<00:02:41.840> in<00:02:42.840> a<00:02:42.959> way<00:02:43.079> it's<00:02:43.409> really

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
stick it back on so in a way it's really

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.559 
stick it back on so in a way it's really
really<00:02:44.010> good<00:02:44.189> that<00:02:44.400> the<00:02:44.549> suede<00:02:44.879> is<00:02:44.939> so<00:02:45.150> thick

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
really good that the suede is so thick

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:47.539 
really good that the suede is so thick
because<00:02:45.780> obviously<00:02:46.560> you're<00:02:47.069> putting<00:02:47.310> it<00:02:47.400> in<00:02:47.489> a

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:47.549 
because obviously you're putting it in a

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:48.890 
because obviously you're putting it in a
high<00:02:47.700> wear<00:02:48.000> part<00:02:48.269> of<00:02:48.329> your<00:02:48.450> shoe<00:02:48.629> if<00:02:48.750> you've

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
high wear part of your shoe if you've

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.809 
high wear part of your shoe if you've
already<00:02:49.049> worn<00:02:49.349> it<00:02:49.470> out<00:02:49.620> but<00:02:50.159> at<00:02:50.280> the<00:02:50.400> same<00:02:50.579> time

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
already worn it out but at the same time

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:52.759 
already worn it out but at the same time
it<00:02:51.030> makes<00:02:51.150> it<00:02:51.269> really<00:02:51.480> difficult<00:02:51.599> to<00:02:52.139> cut<00:02:52.650> it

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
it makes it really difficult to cut it

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:54.770 
it makes it really difficult to cut it
at<00:02:52.889> an<00:02:53.010> angle<00:02:53.180> because<00:02:54.180> the<00:02:54.359> suede<00:02:54.599> is<00:02:54.629> so

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
at an angle because the suede is so

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.809 
at an angle because the suede is so
thick<00:02:55.169> and<00:02:55.409> the<00:02:55.590> adhesive<00:02:56.040> is<00:02:56.159> so<00:02:56.310> sticky<00:02:56.579> and

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
thick and the adhesive is so sticky and

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:58.490 
thick and the adhesive is so sticky and
it's<00:02:56.909> just<00:02:57.090> it's<00:02:57.389> kind<00:02:57.720> of<00:02:57.840> a<00:02:57.900> bitch<00:02:58.139> to<00:02:58.169> deal

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
it's just it's kind of a bitch to deal

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.379 
it's just it's kind of a bitch to deal
with<00:03:00.950> but<00:03:01.950> again<00:03:02.219> you<00:03:02.790> get<00:03:02.909> three<00:03:03.209> of<00:03:03.239> these

to ship these out they come in all kinds
of<00:03:20.040> colors<00:03:20.310> I<00:03:20.430> just<00:03:20.699> told<00:03:20.819> them<00:03:20.970> to<00:03:21.120> send<00:03:21.329> me

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:21.449 
of colors I just told them to send me

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:23.089 
of colors I just told them to send me
the<00:03:21.629> color<00:03:21.959> that<00:03:22.169> they<00:03:22.319> sell<00:03:22.560> the<00:03:22.680> least<00:03:22.889> of

00:03:23.089 --> 00:03:23.099 
the color that they sell the least of

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:26.360 
the color that they sell the least of
which<00:03:23.760> is<00:03:24.000> I<00:03:24.329> guess<00:03:25.169> this<00:03:25.349> would<00:03:25.470> be<00:03:25.620> great<00:03:25.769> but

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
which is I guess this would be great but

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.710 
which is I guess this would be great but
they've<00:03:26.519> also<00:03:26.639> got<00:03:26.819> navy<00:03:27.180> dark<00:03:28.109> navy<00:03:28.340> grey

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
they've also got navy dark navy grey

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:34.670 
they've also got navy dark navy grey
darker<00:03:30.720> grey<00:03:30.989> black<00:03:31.919> and<00:03:32.930> brown<00:03:33.930> I<00:03:34.319> think<00:03:34.590> they

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
darker grey black and brown I think they

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.229 
darker grey black and brown I think they
don't<00:03:34.769> have<00:03:34.859> any<00:03:35.069> really<00:03:35.340> weird<00:03:35.579> colors<00:03:36.030> like

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
don't have any really weird colors like

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:38.780 
don't have any really weird colors like
the<00:03:36.419> royal<00:03:36.629> blues<00:03:36.959> or<00:03:37.229> purple<00:03:37.620> or<00:03:37.739> red<00:03:37.799> or<00:03:38.280> you

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
the royal blues or purple or red or you

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.330 
the royal blues or purple or red or you
know<00:03:38.879> anything<00:03:39.120> like<00:03:39.329> that<00:03:40.189> but<00:03:41.189> I'm<00:03:41.310> sure

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
know anything like that but I'm sure

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.809 
know anything like that but I'm sure
they<00:03:41.579> will<00:03:41.699> in<00:03:41.819> the<00:03:41.849> future<00:03:41.909> maybe<00:03:42.540> maybe<00:03:43.019> not

00:03:43.809 --> 00:03:43.819 
they will in the future maybe maybe not

suggest<00:05:27.720> is<00:05:30.080> when<00:05:31.080> you<00:05:31.170> put<00:05:31.350> the<00:05:31.440> patch<00:05:31.620> on

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:32.030 
suggest is when you put the patch on

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:34.160 
suggest is when you put the patch on
apply<00:05:33.030> some<00:05:33.210> heat<00:05:33.360> with<00:05:33.390> like<00:05:33.690> a<00:05:33.720> blow<00:05:33.900> dryer

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:34.170 
apply some heat with like a blow dryer

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:36.170 
apply some heat with like a blow dryer
or<00:05:34.350> something<00:05:34.410> it<00:05:35.100> just<00:05:35.340> makes<00:05:35.520> that<00:05:35.790> adhesive

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:36.180 
or something it just makes that adhesive

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.360 
or something it just makes that adhesive
even<00:05:36.660> stickier<00:05:36.930> and<00:05:37.230> make<00:05:37.920> sure<00:05:38.070> you<00:05:38.190> really

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:38.370 
even stickier and make sure you really

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:39.770 
even stickier and make sure you really
press<00:05:38.640> it<00:05:38.760> down<00:05:38.850> make<00:05:39.060> sure<00:05:39.090> it<00:05:39.420> sticks

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:39.780 
press it down make sure it sticks

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:42.470 
press it down make sure it sticks
because<00:05:40.290> if<00:05:40.500> it<00:05:40.560> doesn't<00:05:40.830> stick<00:05:41.100> and<00:05:41.580> you

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:42.480 
because if it doesn't stick and you

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:43.940 
because if it doesn't stick and you
don't<00:05:42.630> have<00:05:42.750> the<00:05:42.870> edges<00:05:43.140> properly<00:05:43.590> sanded

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:43.950 
don't have the edges properly sanded

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:46.700 
don't have the edges properly sanded
down<00:05:43.980> and<00:05:44.340> tapered<00:05:44.730> off<00:05:44.850> then<00:05:45.420> you<00:05:46.170> you're

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:46.710 
down and tapered off then you you're

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:49.130
