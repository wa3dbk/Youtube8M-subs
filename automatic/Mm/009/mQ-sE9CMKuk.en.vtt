from the jump I can't let you know that
the<00:01:16.250> closure<00:01:16.550> was<00:01:16.970> way<00:01:18.250> more<00:01:19.250> defined<00:01:19.759> as<00:01:20.000> far

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210 
the closure was way more defined as far

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.150 
the closure was way more defined as far
as<00:01:20.330> with<00:01:20.539> the<00:01:20.570> wave<00:01:20.869> pattern<00:01:21.440> and<00:01:21.649> then<00:01:22.039> the

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:22.160 
as with the wave pattern and then the

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.810 
as with the wave pattern and then the
actual<00:01:22.460> bundles<00:01:22.910> were<00:01:23.270> a<00:01:23.479> lot<00:01:23.720> looser<00:01:24.259> and<00:01:24.820> I

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
actual bundles were a lot looser and I

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.990 
actual bundles were a lot looser and I
actually<00:01:26.420> made<00:01:26.810> this<00:01:26.960> on<00:01:27.200> a<00:01:27.229> 4<00:01:27.680> week<00:01:28.220> so<00:01:28.670> that

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
actually made this on a 4 week so that

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.630 
actually made this on a 4 week so that
is<00:01:29.149> what<00:01:29.360> I<00:01:29.390> actually<00:01:29.690> have<00:01:30.170> one<00:01:30.440> now<00:01:30.830> I<00:01:31.130> did

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
is what I actually have one now I did

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.370 
is what I actually have one now I did
not<00:01:32.170> bleach<00:01:33.170> the<00:01:33.860> knots<00:01:34.640> being<00:01:35.539> too<00:01:35.869> lazy<00:01:36.140> and

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
not bleach the knots being too lazy and

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.760 
not bleach the knots being too lazy and
I<00:01:37.220> didn't<00:01:37.580> put<00:01:37.759> any<00:01:37.970> concealer<00:01:38.090> on<00:01:38.930> it<00:01:39.080> as<00:01:39.320> yet

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
I didn't put any concealer on it as yet

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.980 
I didn't put any concealer on it as yet
so<00:01:40.310> you<00:01:40.369> can't<00:01:40.490> really<00:01:40.910> see<00:01:41.060> a<00:01:41.090> defined<00:01:41.539> apart

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
so you can't really see a defined apart

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.919 
so you can't really see a defined apart
but<00:01:42.679> this<00:01:43.340> is<00:01:43.610> the<00:01:43.850> hair<00:01:44.119> and<00:01:44.420> this<00:01:44.600> is<00:01:44.750> how

00:01:44.919 --> 00:01:44.929 
but this is the hair and this is how

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:46.870 
but this is the hair and this is how

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:48.799 
show you real quick but it is curls so

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:54.039 
show you real quick but it is curls so
if<00:01:49.490> you<00:01:49.729> go<00:01:50.150> up<00:01:50.180> just<00:01:50.750> a<00:01:50.900> little<00:01:50.930> bit<00:01:51.200> but<00:01:53.049> it

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:54.049 
if you go up just a little bit but it

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:57.460 
if you go up just a little bit but it
comes<00:01:54.729> like<00:01:55.729> underneath<00:01:56.360> my<00:01:56.750> boob<00:01:56.990> but<00:01:57.259> if<00:01:57.350> it

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.470 
comes like underneath my boob but if it

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.109 
comes like underneath my boob but if it
wasn't<00:01:57.619> curled<00:01:57.979> it<00:01:58.130> comes<00:01:58.369> down<00:01:58.759> a<00:01:58.820> little

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
wasn't curled it comes down a little

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:01.749 
wasn't curled it comes down a little
further<00:01:59.420> as<00:01:59.780> you<00:02:00.020> can<00:02:00.290> see<00:02:00.650> and<00:02:00.979> I<00:02:01.250> actually

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:01.759 
further as you can see and I actually

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:03.969 
further as you can see and I actually
achieved<00:02:02.720> these<00:02:02.840> curls<00:02:03.140> by<00:02:03.259> using<00:02:03.470> my<00:02:03.650> thirty

a lot of shedding now there was some but

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.500 
a lot of shedding now there was some but
not<00:03:18.560> a<00:03:18.740> lot<00:03:18.860> I<00:03:19.310> want<00:03:19.640> to<00:03:19.700> say<00:03:19.760> like<00:03:20.120> Oh<00:03:20.270> watch<00:03:20.480> it

there<00:03:20.840> might<00:03:21.050> have<00:03:21.200> been<00:03:21.350> about<00:03:21.590> six<00:03:21.980> or<00:03:22.160> seven

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:25.180 
there might have been about six or seven
strands<00:03:23.120> so<00:03:23.960> I<00:03:23.990> don't<00:03:24.230> think<00:03:24.350> that's<00:03:24.590> too<00:03:24.980> bad

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190

strands so I don't think that's too bad
that<00:03:25.580> was<00:03:25.700> like<00:03:25.790> the<00:03:26.000> entire<00:03:26.060> wig<00:03:26.800> and<00:03:27.800> then

when I actually was making my unit I

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.450 
when I actually was making my unit I
might<00:03:30.140> have<00:03:30.260> got<00:03:30.380> a<00:03:30.410> couple<00:03:30.650> strands<00:03:31.010> do<00:03:31.220> the

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:31.460 
might have got a couple strands do the

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:33.880 
might have got a couple strands do the
fact<00:03:31.640> that<00:03:31.730> I<00:03:31.880> did<00:03:32.120> cut<00:03:32.450> some<00:03:32.810> of<00:03:33.080> my<00:03:33.260> West<00:03:33.530> and

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:02.560 
guess I never really noticed because I'm
trying<00:04:01.459> to<00:04:01.520> remember<00:04:01.730> but<00:04:01.880> I<00:04:02.030> don't<00:04:02.360> think
