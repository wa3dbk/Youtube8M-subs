00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
some of them not all of them I did it a

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.770 
some of them not all of them I did it a
couple<00:02:01.860> of<00:02:02.040> different<00:02:02.189> ways<00:02:02.520> these<00:02:03.509> are<00:02:03.570> the

couple of different ways these are the

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.910 
couple of different ways these are the
ones<00:02:03.990> that<00:02:04.140> I<00:02:04.229> did<00:02:04.500> don't<00:02:05.460> they<00:02:05.549> look<00:02:05.700> great

ones that I did don't they look great
does<00:02:07.920> they<00:02:08.069> look<00:02:08.220> just<00:02:08.399> like<00:02:08.520> the<00:02:08.729> stuff<00:02:08.940> you'd

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
does they look just like the stuff you'd

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.790 
does they look just like the stuff you'd
buy<00:02:09.300> at<00:02:09.479> my<00:02:09.629> site<00:02:09.899> they're<00:02:10.229> a<00:02:10.259> little<00:02:10.410> bit<00:02:10.619> less

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
buy at my site they're a little bit less

glossing<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:11.459> reason<00:02:11.700> is<00:02:11.819> because<00:02:11.970> the

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
glossing the reason is because the

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.860 
glossing the reason is because the
gunmen

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
gunmen

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.680 
gunmen
that<00:02:13.080> we<00:02:13.799> carry<00:02:14.129> at<00:02:14.310> the<00:02:14.459> site<00:02:14.730> is<00:02:14.970> lacquered<00:02:15.569> I

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
that we carry at the site is lacquered I

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.809 
that we carry at the site is lacquered I
did<00:02:15.900> that<00:02:16.140> to<00:02:16.349> kind<00:02:16.980> of<00:02:17.129> lessen<00:02:17.610> the

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
did that to kind of lessen the

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:20.660 
did that to kind of lessen the
hypoallergenic<00:02:19.190> quality<00:02:20.190> so<00:02:20.400> you<00:02:20.430> have<00:02:20.640> a

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
hypoallergenic quality so you have a

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.710 
hypoallergenic quality so you have a
little<00:02:20.909> protection<00:02:21.349> there<00:02:22.849> but<00:02:23.849> anyway<00:02:24.510> these

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
little protection there but anyway these

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:25.970 
little protection there but anyway these
aren't<00:02:25.019> so<00:02:25.230> they're<00:02:25.379> a<00:02:25.409> little<00:02:25.620> bit<00:02:25.739> less

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
aren't so they're a little bit less

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.449 
aren't so they're a little bit less
glossy<00:02:26.340> and<00:02:27.290> what<00:02:28.290> I<00:02:28.319> did<00:02:28.560> is<00:02:28.709> I<00:02:28.860> used<00:02:29.129> this

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
glossy and what I did is I used this

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:31.399 
glossy and what I did is I used this
finding<00:02:30.000> which<00:02:30.150> was<00:02:30.329> pre<00:02:30.629> plated<00:02:31.110> pewter

00:02:31.399 --> 00:02:31.409 
finding which was pre plated pewter

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:32.660 
finding which was pre plated pewter
rocks<00:02:31.590> which<00:02:31.799> were<00:02:31.950> also<00:02:32.220> not<00:02:32.370> carrying

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
rocks which were also not carrying

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:33.830 
rocks which were also not carrying
anymore<00:02:33.060> because<00:02:33.150> his<00:02:33.329> nickel<00:02:33.659> content

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
anymore because his nickel content

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.170 
anymore because his nickel content
filling<00:02:34.650> up<00:02:34.739> in<00:02:34.860> these<00:02:35.010> Lindsay<00:02:35.489> I<00:02:35.670> went<00:02:36.120> too

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
filling up in these Lindsay I went too

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.670 
filling up in these Lindsay I went too
happy<00:02:36.390> that<00:02:36.480> much<00:02:36.659> it's<00:02:36.870> just<00:02:36.989> what<00:02:37.140> I<00:02:37.170> had<00:02:37.440> for

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
happy that much it's just what I had for

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.149 
happy that much it's just what I had for
an<00:02:37.769> example<00:02:38.280> I<00:02:38.400> would<00:02:38.730> recommend<00:02:39.480> finding

00:02:40.149 --> 00:02:40.159 
an example I would recommend finding

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:42.319 
an example I would recommend finding
maybe<00:02:41.159> something<00:02:41.549> if<00:02:41.640> you<00:02:41.730> wanted<00:02:42.030> to<00:02:42.150> go<00:02:42.299> over

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:42.329 
maybe something if you wanted to go over

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:44.930 
maybe something if you wanted to go over
plating<00:02:43.049> get<00:02:43.230> a<00:02:43.260> brass<00:02:43.560> ox<00:02:43.950> piece<00:02:44.370> there's<00:02:44.700> no

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
plating get a brass ox piece there's no

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.410 
plating get a brass ox piece there's no
nickel<00:02:45.480> and<00:02:45.720> brass<00:02:45.750> ox<00:02:46.230> plating<00:02:47.060> and<00:02:48.060> the

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
nickel and brass ox plating and the

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.150 
nickel and brass ox plating and the
reason<00:02:48.780> I<00:02:48.840> did<00:02:49.019> a<00:02:49.049> plated<00:02:49.500> piece<00:02:49.680> under<00:02:49.980> here

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
reason I did a plated piece under here

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.920 
reason I did a plated piece under here
is<00:02:50.220> because<00:02:50.489> it<00:02:50.640> gives<00:02:50.879> this<00:02:51.150> the<00:02:51.359> spray<00:02:51.690> paint

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
is because it gives this the spray paint

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.039 
is because it gives this the spray paint
a<00:02:52.170> little<00:02:52.319> bit<00:02:52.560> of<00:02:52.709> tooth<00:02:52.950> and<00:02:53.340> I<00:02:54.269> just<00:02:54.629> kind<00:02:54.870> of

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:55.049 
a little bit of tooth and I just kind of

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:58.069 
a little bit of tooth and I just kind of
liked<00:02:55.260> it<00:02:55.470> so<00:02:56.390> that's<00:02:57.390> why<00:02:57.599> I<00:02:57.629> did<00:02:57.840> it<00:02:57.870> so

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:58.079 
liked it so that's why I did it so

00:02:58.079 --> 00:02:59.960 
liked it so that's why I did it so
that's<00:02:58.260> one<00:02:58.530> way<00:02:58.709> you<00:02:58.769> can<00:02:59.099> do<00:02:59.280> it<00:02:59.310> and<00:02:59.609> on

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
that's one way you can do it and on

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.619 
that's one way you can do it and on
these<00:03:00.329> now<00:03:01.109> they're<00:03:01.290> very<00:03:01.560> matte<00:03:02.060> so<00:03:03.060> I<00:03:03.090> kind

00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:03.629 
these now they're very matte so I kind

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:05.869 
these now they're very matte so I kind
of<00:03:03.720> thought<00:03:03.930> that<00:03:03.989> it<00:03:04.349> might<00:03:04.829> benefit<00:03:05.459> from<00:03:05.519> a

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:05.879 
of thought that it might benefit from a

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:08.390 
of thought that it might benefit from a
little<00:03:06.150> bit<00:03:06.390> of<00:03:06.450> sponge<00:03:06.989> diamond<00:03:07.950> glaze<00:03:08.129> over

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
little bit of sponge diamond glaze over

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.819 
little bit of sponge diamond glaze over
top<00:03:08.790> so<00:03:09.780> this<00:03:09.930> might<00:03:10.170> see<00:03:10.379> I<00:03:10.409> got<00:03:10.620> a<00:03:10.650> little

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:10.829 
top so this might see I got a little

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:13.160 
top so this might see I got a little
high<00:03:11.010> place<00:03:11.340> I<00:03:11.549> need<00:03:11.760> to<00:03:12.000> catch<00:03:12.780> this<00:03:12.989> little

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
high place I need to catch this little

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.750 
high place I need to catch this little
ding<00:03:13.530> there<00:03:13.769> so<00:03:14.010> I'm<00:03:14.129> going<00:03:14.220> to<00:03:14.280> do<00:03:14.400> it<00:03:14.489> on<00:03:14.609> this

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
ding there so I'm going to do it on this

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:21.710 
ding there so I'm going to do it on this
one<00:03:15.200> but<00:03:16.489> basically<00:03:19.069> you<00:03:20.069> see<00:03:20.250> this<00:03:20.730> is<00:03:21.389> almost

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
one but basically you see this is almost

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.979 
one but basically you see this is almost
like<00:03:21.840> we're<00:03:22.169> lacquering<00:03:22.590> it<00:03:23.630> some<00:03:24.630> kind<00:03:24.780> of<00:03:24.900> a

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
like we're lacquering it some kind of a

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:27.289 
like we're lacquering it some kind of a
fuzzy<00:03:25.290> thing<00:03:25.680> but<00:03:25.859> on<00:03:26.010> the<00:03:26.130> back<00:03:26.370> but<00:03:27.120> it'll

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
fuzzy thing but on the back but it'll

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:33.110 
fuzzy thing but on the back but it'll
give<00:03:27.480> it<00:03:27.510> a<00:03:27.630> gloss<00:03:27.930> and<00:03:29.750> then<00:03:30.750> that<00:03:31.019> way<00:03:32.120> you

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
give it a gloss and then that way you

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.490 
give it a gloss and then that way you
know<00:03:33.239> when<00:03:33.359> it<00:03:33.480> cures<00:03:33.780> I<00:03:33.930> guess<00:03:34.109> there's<00:03:34.319> some

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
know when it cures I guess there's some

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.000 
know when it cures I guess there's some
fuzz<00:03:34.829> but<00:03:35.099> on<00:03:35.250> here<00:03:36.290> that's<00:03:37.290> given<00:03:37.650> me<00:03:37.680> some

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
fuzz but on here that's given me some

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.979 
fuzz but on here that's given me some
fits<00:03:39.590> it<00:03:40.590> will<00:03:40.709> give<00:03:40.859> it<00:03:40.980> a<00:03:41.040> gloss<00:03:41.340> and<00:03:41.989> this

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
fits it will give it a gloss and this

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:45.050 
fits it will give it a gloss and this
won't<00:03:43.260> take<00:03:43.560> a<00:03:43.769> real<00:03:44.040> long<00:03:44.250> time<00:03:44.489> to<00:03:44.669> cure<00:03:44.879> now

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
won't take a real long time to cure now

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.800 
won't take a real long time to cure now
ultimately<00:03:46.819> I'd<00:03:47.819> rather<00:03:48.060> see<00:03:48.329> you<00:03:48.449> do<00:03:48.599> ice

now<00:05:53.870> sometimes<00:05:54.380> what<00:05:54.650> I<00:05:54.710> do<00:05:54.830> when<00:05:55.729> I'm<00:05:55.880> trying

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:56.090 
now sometimes what I do when I'm trying

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:58.140 
now sometimes what I do when I'm trying
to<00:05:56.180> make<00:05:56.330> a<00:05:56.360> gun<00:05:56.630> metal<00:05:56.780> painted<00:05:57.350> tight<00:05:57.620> finish

00:05:58.140 --> 00:05:58.150 
to make a gun metal painted tight finish

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:00.640 
to make a gun metal painted tight finish
this<00:05:59.150> is<00:05:59.390> really<00:05:59.690> more<00:05:59.870> what<00:06:00.050> like<00:06:00.290> what<00:06:00.500> they

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:00.650 
this is really more what like what they

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:03.010 
this is really more what like what they
call<00:06:00.680> Japan<00:06:01.550> black<00:06:01.970> which<00:06:02.300> is<00:06:02.330> like<00:06:02.600> a<00:06:02.630> lacquer

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:03.020 
call Japan black which is like a lacquer

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:05.980 
call Japan black which is like a lacquer
not<00:06:03.380> so<00:06:03.650> much<00:06:03.830> gunmo<00:06:04.220> gunmetal<00:06:05.060> a<00:06:05.570> real

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:05.990 
not so much gunmo gunmetal a real

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:08.140 
not so much gunmo gunmetal a real
gunmetal<00:06:06.440> has<00:06:06.800> a<00:06:06.830> little<00:06:07.310> silver<00:06:07.760> so<00:06:07.910> I<00:06:07.940> have

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:08.150 
gunmetal has a little silver so I have

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:10.210 
gunmetal has a little silver so I have
my<00:06:08.300> Lumiere<00:06:08.840> paints<00:06:09.320> which<00:06:09.440> we<00:06:09.590> do<00:06:09.770> carry<00:06:10.070> on

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:10.220 
my Lumiere paints which we do carry on

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:16.880 
my Lumiere paints which we do carry on
this<00:06:10.370> site<00:06:10.640> and<00:06:10.850> I<00:06:11.690> mix<00:06:11.960> a<00:06:12.229> little<00:06:12.620> bit

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:16.890 

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:20.100 

and<00:06:17.890> you<00:06:18.160> just<00:06:18.400> get<00:06:18.640> a<00:06:18.700> little<00:06:19.090> bit<00:06:19.240> more<00:06:19.720> I

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:20.110 
and you just get a little bit more I

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:22.230 
and you just get a little bit more I
might<00:06:20.950> even<00:06:21.040> take<00:06:21.220> just<00:06:21.460> some<00:06:21.580> silver<00:06:22.000> on<00:06:22.090> its

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:22.240 
might even take just some silver on its

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:25.100 
might even take just some silver on its
own<00:06:22.480> a<00:06:22.860> little<00:06:23.860> bit<00:06:24.010> more<00:06:24.310> of<00:06:24.430> an<00:06:24.550> authentic

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:25.110 
own a little bit more of an authentic

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:28.440 
own a little bit more of an authentic
gunmetal<00:06:26.110> look<00:06:26.470> because<00:06:26.680> gunmetal<00:06:27.250> is<00:06:27.670> not

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:28.450 
gunmetal look because gunmetal is not

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:30.510 
gunmetal look because gunmetal is not
really<00:06:28.990> black<00:06:29.380> black<00:06:29.770> all<00:06:29.950> this<00:06:30.070> sometimes

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:30.520 
really black black all this sometimes

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:31.800 
really black black all this sometimes
some<00:06:30.730> of<00:06:30.760> the<00:06:30.880> stuff<00:06:31.090> we've<00:06:31.270> got<00:06:31.300> back<00:06:31.630> of<00:06:31.750> the

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:31.810 
some of the stuff we've got back of the

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:34.110 
some of the stuff we've got back of the
players<00:06:32.020> is<00:06:32.170> black<00:06:32.470> as<00:06:32.680> night<00:06:33.000> but<00:06:34.000> it

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:34.120 
players is black as night but it

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:37.080 
players is black as night but it
actually<00:06:34.300> has<00:06:34.780> tiny<00:06:35.350> elements<00:06:36.190> of<00:06:36.340> brown<00:06:36.730> and

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:37.090 
actually has tiny elements of brown and

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:39.810 
actually has tiny elements of brown and
silver<00:06:37.660> so<00:06:38.230> you<00:06:38.770> might<00:06:39.070> want<00:06:39.340> to<00:06:39.400> experiment

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:39.820 
silver so you might want to experiment

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:41.010 
silver so you might want to experiment
with<00:06:40.240> your<00:06:40.270> pinks

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:41.020 
with your pinks

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:43.980 
with your pinks
I<00:06:41.050> would<00:06:41.650> suggest<00:06:41.860> brown<00:06:42.790> dark<00:06:43.150> dark<00:06:43.450> deepest

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:43.990 
I would suggest brown dark dark deepest

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:47.040 
I would suggest brown dark dark deepest
chocolate<00:06:44.470> brown<00:06:44.910> black<00:06:45.910> is<00:06:46.090> night<00:06:46.300> black<00:06:46.660> and

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:47.050 
chocolate brown black is night black and

chocolate brown black is night black and
a<00:06:47.410> little<00:06:47.680> bit<00:06:47.800> of<00:06:47.920> silver<00:06:48.220> mixed<00:06:48.790> together

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:48.940 
a little bit of silver mixed together

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:51.060 
a little bit of silver mixed together
and<00:06:49.480> see<00:06:49.780> what<00:06:49.930> you<00:06:50.050> come<00:06:50.230> up<00:06:50.380> with<00:06:50.620> and<00:06:50.860> then

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:51.070 
and see what you come up with and then

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:53.520 
and see what you come up with and then
what<00:06:51.280> you<00:06:51.460> do<00:06:51.730> after<00:06:52.300> this<00:06:52.480> is<00:06:52.660> dry<00:06:52.990> very<00:06:53.410> dry

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:53.530 
what you do after this is dry very dry

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:56.310 
what you do after this is dry very dry
as<00:06:54.070> a<00:06:54.100> bone<00:06:54.390> what<00:06:55.390> you're<00:06:55.600> going<00:06:55.750> to<00:06:55.810> do<00:06:56.050> then

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:56.320 
as a bone what you're going to do then

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:59.160 
as a bone what you're going to do then
you<00:06:56.650> could<00:06:56.920> use<00:06:57.160> the<00:06:57.430> Jew<00:06:57.670> deacons<00:06:58.170> diamond

00:06:59.160 --> 00:06:59.170 
you could use the Jew deacons diamond

00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:00.990 
you could use the Jew deacons diamond
glaze<00:06:59.320> but<00:06:59.620> it's<00:06:59.800> filigree<00:07:00.310> so<00:07:00.550> it<00:07:00.670> may<00:07:00.820> not

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:01.000 
glaze but it's filigree so it may not

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.870 
glaze but it's filigree so it may not
fill<00:07:01.210> in<00:07:01.390> well<00:07:01.750> I<00:07:02.050> would<00:07:02.980> in<00:07:03.310> this<00:07:03.580> case

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:03.880 
fill in well I would in this case

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:06.320 
fill in well I would in this case
because<00:07:04.150> it's<00:07:04.300> filigree<00:07:04.780> do<00:07:05.290> a<00:07:05.320> clear<00:07:05.770> acrylic

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:06.330 
because it's filigree do a clear acrylic

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:10.380 
because it's filigree do a clear acrylic
sealer<00:07:07.330> in<00:07:07.510> a<00:07:07.930> matte<00:07:08.200> finish<00:07:08.770> and<00:07:09.250> then<00:07:10.210> that

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:10.390 
sealer in a matte finish and then that

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:13.320 
sealer in a matte finish and then that
one<00:07:10.930> painted<00:07:11.440> look<00:07:11.620> at<00:07:11.740> that<00:07:11.950> and<00:07:12.250> then<00:07:12.820> and

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:13.330 
one painted look at that and then and

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:15.600 
one painted look at that and then and
then<00:07:13.600> you<00:07:14.110> know<00:07:14.230> let<00:07:14.470> it<00:07:14.590> dry<00:07:14.890> and<00:07:15.250> you<00:07:15.460> should

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:15.610 
then you know let it dry and you should

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:18.180 
then you know let it dry and you should
be<00:07:15.700> good<00:07:15.880> the<00:07:16.060> only<00:07:16.150> thing<00:07:16.480> is<00:07:16.750> the<00:07:17.590> same<00:07:17.860> as

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:18.190 
be good the only thing is the same as

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:22.110 
be good the only thing is the same as
with<00:07:19.030> gunmetal<00:07:19.810> that<00:07:20.440> we<00:07:20.980> have<00:07:21.220> plated<00:07:21.640> or

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:22.120 
with gunmetal that we have plated or

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:25.710 
with gunmetal that we have plated or
that<00:07:22.420> you<00:07:22.660> paint<00:07:23.220> it<00:07:24.220> does<00:07:24.610> not<00:07:24.880> manipulate

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:25.720 
that you paint it does not manipulate

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:27.810 
that you paint it does not manipulate
really<00:07:26.110> well<00:07:26.290> so<00:07:26.650> you're<00:07:27.250> going<00:07:27.430> to<00:07:27.460> have<00:07:27.640> to

00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:27.820 
really well so you're going to have to

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:29.490 
really well so you're going to have to
be<00:07:27.940> careful<00:07:28.210> when<00:07:28.630> you<00:07:28.780> manipulated<00:07:29.470> the

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:29.500 
be careful when you manipulated the

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:31.680 
be careful when you manipulated the
doesn't<00:07:29.980> chip<00:07:30.160> if<00:07:30.700> you<00:07:30.940> manipulate<00:07:31.120> in<00:07:31.600> a

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:31.690 
doesn't chip if you manipulate in a

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:33.120 
doesn't chip if you manipulate in a
chips<00:07:31.960> though<00:07:32.230> and<00:07:32.500> it's<00:07:32.650> a<00:07:32.740> painted<00:07:33.100> surface

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:33.130 
chips though and it's a painted surface

00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:35.670 
chips though and it's a painted surface
guess<00:07:33.730> what<00:07:33.940> you<00:07:34.120> can<00:07:34.330> do<00:07:34.480> you<00:07:35.200> could<00:07:35.350> just<00:07:35.530> go

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:35.680 
guess what you can do you could just go

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:37.380 
guess what you can do you could just go
back<00:07:35.860> in<00:07:36.160> and<00:07:36.310> paint<00:07:36.550> it<00:07:36.670> and<00:07:36.790> cover<00:07:37.090> it<00:07:37.300> again

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:37.390 
back in and paint it and cover it again
