00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
would have come up with something a bit

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.380 
would have come up with something a bit
more<00:00:46.649> exciting<00:00:47.520> than<00:00:47.670> these<00:00:47.879> so<00:00:48.120> we've<00:00:48.239> got

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
more exciting than these so we've got

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.380 
more exciting than these so we've got
one<00:00:48.570> called<00:00:48.840> water<00:00:49.280> mobile<00:00:50.280> southport<00:00:51.239> and

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
one called water mobile southport and

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.779 
one called water mobile southport and
playing<00:00:51.800> so<00:00:52.800> these<00:00:52.949> are<00:00:53.010> all<00:00:53.190> to<00:00:53.430> me<00:00:53.579> very

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
playing so these are all to me very

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.160 
playing so these are all to me very
boring<00:00:54.180> name<00:00:54.360> for<00:00:54.600> maps<00:00:54.809> i<00:00:54.960> would<00:00:55.079> have

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
boring name for maps i would have

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.720 
boring name for maps i would have
thought<00:00:55.199> of<00:00:55.410> something<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:55.860> bit<00:00:55.980> more<00:00:56.039> exciting

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
thought of something a bit more exciting

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.580 
thought of something a bit more exciting
but<00:00:56.910> for<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.270> zombies<00:00:57.570> map<00:00:57.780> we've<00:00:58.140> got<00:00:58.350> dead

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
but for the zombies map we've got dead

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.020 
but for the zombies map we've got dead
high<00:00:58.770> which<00:00:59.010> again<00:00:59.250> that's<00:00:59.460> actually<00:00:59.820> quite<00:00:59.940> a

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
high which again that's actually quite a

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.549 
high which again that's actually quite a
cool<00:01:00.300> name<00:01:00.539> and<00:01:00.809> then<00:01:00.989> we've<00:01:01.140> got<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.320> gun

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
cool name and then we've got the gun

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.139 
cool name and then we've got the gun
which<00:01:01.770> actually<00:01:02.010> does<00:01:02.520> not<00:01:02.730> have<00:01:02.910> a<00:01:02.940> name

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
which actually does not have a name

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.990 
which actually does not have a name
because<00:01:03.449> we<00:01:03.570> can't<00:01:03.809> see<00:01:03.930> it<00:01:04.309> so<00:01:05.309> water<00:01:05.610> looks

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
because we can't see it so water looks

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.240 
because we can't see it so water looks
to<00:01:06.180> be<00:01:06.299> like<00:01:06.330> a<00:01:06.570> kind<00:01:06.960> of<00:01:07.049> watery<00:01:07.619> map<00:01:07.950> again

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
to be like a kind of watery map again

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.100 
to be like a kind of watery map again
it's<00:01:08.430> quite<00:01:08.610> a<00:01:08.640> good<00:01:08.880> photoshop<00:01:09.390> if<00:01:09.780> this<00:01:09.930> was

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
it's quite a good photoshop if this was

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.109 
it's quite a good photoshop if this was
photo<00:01:10.380> shot<00:01:10.740> by<00:01:10.890> someone<00:01:11.159> that<00:01:11.700> looks<00:01:11.909> like<00:01:12.030> a

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
photo shot by someone that looks like a

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.969 
photo shot by someone that looks like a
quite<00:01:12.420> a<00:01:12.450> cool<00:01:12.720> map<00:01:12.990> image<00:01:13.350> again<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.740> names

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
quite a cool map image again the names

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.580 
quite a cool map image again the names
not<00:01:14.280> too<00:01:14.430> exciting<00:01:15.060> now<00:01:15.570> for<00:01:15.840> mobile<00:01:16.229> it<00:01:16.409> just

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
not too exciting now for mobile it just

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:17.570 
not too exciting now for mobile it just
looks<00:01:16.770> like<00:01:16.830> we've<00:01:17.009> got<00:01:17.040> some<00:01:17.159> blue

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
looks like we've got some blue

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.010 
looks like we've got some blue
background<00:01:18.060> than<00:01:18.210> with<00:01:18.330> someone<00:01:18.360> holding<00:01:18.900> the

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
background than with someone holding the

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.899 
background than with someone holding the
gun<00:01:19.110> it's<00:01:19.290> kind<00:01:19.500> of<00:01:19.560> blurry<00:01:19.860> so<00:01:20.189> hard<00:01:20.460> to<00:01:20.670> see

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
gun it's kind of blurry so hard to see

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.030 
gun it's kind of blurry so hard to see
doesn't<00:01:21.810> look<00:01:21.900> like<00:01:22.110> a<00:01:22.140> very<00:01:22.380> interesting

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
doesn't look like a very interesting

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.100 
doesn't look like a very interesting
image<00:01:23.430> again<00:01:23.580> if<00:01:23.820> this<00:01:23.939> was<00:01:24.119> official<00:01:24.150> I<00:01:24.689> would

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
image again if this was official I would

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.510 
image again if this was official I would
think<00:01:25.140> they<00:01:25.530> would<00:01:25.680> put<00:01:25.890> something<00:01:26.280> better

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
think they would put something better

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.999 
think they would put something better
for<00:01:26.850> that<00:01:27.150> image<00:01:27.479> next<00:01:28.140> we've<00:01:28.259> got<00:01:28.290> South<00:01:28.710> Pole

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
for that image next we've got South Pole

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.560 
for that image next we've got South Pole
which<00:01:29.189> is<00:01:29.310> actually<00:01:29.549> a<00:01:29.790> name<00:01:30.030> for<00:01:30.270> one<00:01:30.360> of<00:01:30.479> the

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
which is actually a name for one of the

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.050 
which is actually a name for one of the
controller<00:01:31.409> settings<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:32.159> call<00:01:32.340> of<00:01:32.490> duty<00:01:32.880> and

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
controller settings and call of duty and

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.700 
controller settings and call of duty and
it<00:01:33.689> looks<00:01:33.869> like<00:01:33.960> we've<00:01:34.140> got<00:01:34.170> kind<00:01:34.560> of<00:01:34.619> a

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
it looks like we've got kind of a

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.380 
it looks like we've got kind of a
village<00:01:34.920> about<00:01:35.159> girl<00:01:35.549> maybe<00:01:35.759> I<00:01:35.850> can't<00:01:36.210> really

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
village about girl maybe I can't really

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.999 
village about girl maybe I can't really
be<00:01:36.570> sure<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:37.049> then<00:01:37.140> finally<00:01:37.470> we've<00:01:37.560> got<00:01:37.710> plane

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
be sure and then finally we've got plane

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.890 
be sure and then finally we've got plane
we've<00:01:38.460> got<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.850> plane<00:01:39.210> in<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.479> background

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
we've got the plane in the background

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:40.880 
we've got the plane in the background
we've<00:01:40.020> got<00:01:40.140> some<00:01:40.290> seats<00:01:40.560> and<00:01:40.710> then<00:01:40.799> we<00:01:40.860> just

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
we've got some seats and then we just

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.920 
we've got some seats and then we just
got<00:01:41.040> a<00:01:41.159> character<00:01:41.430> standing<00:01:42.060> there<00:01:42.180> again<00:01:42.450> not

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
got a character standing there again not

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.469 
got a character standing there again not
really<00:01:43.259> interesting<00:01:43.890> images<00:01:44.310> then<00:01:45.149> of<00:01:45.270> course

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
really interesting images then of course

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:46.760 
really interesting images then of course
we<00:01:45.630> got<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.840> gun<00:01:45.990> it<00:01:46.079> looks<00:01:46.229> like<00:01:46.380> a<00:01:46.409> really

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
we got the gun it looks like a really

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.620 
we got the gun it looks like a really
interesting<00:01:47.130> gonna<00:01:47.579> cans<00:01:47.909> it's<00:01:48.180> kind<00:01:48.450> of<00:01:48.479> got

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
interesting gonna cans it's kind of got

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.539 
interesting gonna cans it's kind of got
the<00:01:48.659> mag<00:01:48.930> of<00:01:49.140> an<00:01:49.229> LMG<00:01:49.829> something<00:01:50.250> like<00:01:50.399> that

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
the mag of an LMG something like that

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.429 
the mag of an LMG something like that
maybe<00:01:50.729> and<00:01:51.060> it's<00:01:51.420> kind<00:01:51.630> of<00:01:51.689> got<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:51.960> scope<00:01:52.259> of

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
maybe and it's kind of got the scope of

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.440 
maybe and it's kind of got the scope of
a<00:01:52.530> sniper<00:01:52.920> so<00:01:53.250> maybe<00:01:53.490> again<00:01:53.820> it's<00:01:53.970> a<00:01:54.060> hybrid

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
a sniper so maybe again it's a hybrid

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.020 
a sniper so maybe again it's a hybrid
between<00:01:54.570> an<00:01:54.899> LMG<00:01:55.290> and<00:01:55.470> a<00:01:55.500> sniper<00:01:55.799> not<00:01:56.579> really

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
between an LMG and a sniper not really

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.910 
between an LMG and a sniper not really
too<00:01:57.270> sure<00:01:57.299> time<00:01:57.810> what<00:01:57.960> you<00:01:58.140> guys<00:01:58.320> think<00:01:58.740> about

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
too sure time what you guys think about

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.830 
too sure time what you guys think about
that<00:01:59.159> gun<00:01:59.369> it's<00:01:59.549> got<00:01:59.700> no<00:01:59.850> name<00:02:00.090> there<00:02:00.360> again<00:02:00.659> so

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
that gun it's got no name there again so

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.660 
that gun it's got no name there again so
we<00:02:00.960> can't<00:02:01.200> be<00:02:01.680> sure<00:02:01.710> of<00:02:02.040> what<00:02:02.189> this<00:02:02.310> gun<00:02:02.520> will

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
we can't be sure of what this gun will

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.910 
we can't be sure of what this gun will
be<00:02:02.759> called<00:02:03.090> and<00:02:03.899> again<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.350> background<00:02:04.740> for

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
be called and again the background for

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.520 
be called and again the background for
this<00:02:05.009> sir<00:02:05.250> whole<00:02:05.610> map<00:02:05.969> is<00:02:06.210> actually<00:02:06.840> blue

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
this sir whole map is actually blue

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:08.990 
this sir whole map is actually blue
which<00:02:07.740> is<00:02:07.860> kind<00:02:08.069> of<00:02:08.099> cool<00:02:08.160> it's<00:02:08.520> different

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
which is kind of cool it's different

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.699 
which is kind of cool it's different
from<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.300> red<00:02:09.539> that<00:02:09.720> we<00:02:09.840> got<00:02:09.989> with<00:02:10.110> revolution

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
from the red that we got with revolution

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.680 
from the red that we got with revolution
and<00:02:10.860> again<00:02:11.310> the<00:02:11.430> maps<00:02:11.610> called<00:02:11.819> orientation

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
and again the maps called orientation

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.360 
and again the maps called orientation
which<00:02:12.840> is<00:02:12.959> kind<00:02:13.110> of

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
which is kind of

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.250 
which is kind of
strange<00:02:13.580> name<00:02:13.819> now<00:02:14.659> finally<00:02:15.049> we've<00:02:15.140> got

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
strange name now finally we've got

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.110 
strange name now finally we've got
zombies<00:02:15.500> map<00:02:15.890> it's<00:02:16.040> called<00:02:16.220> dead<00:02:16.430> hi<00:02:16.640> so<00:02:16.879> maybe

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
zombies map it's called dead hi so maybe

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.550 
zombies map it's called dead hi so maybe
that<00:02:17.330> suggesting<00:02:17.810> it<00:02:17.900> could<00:02:17.930> be<00:02:18.170> set<00:02:18.379> in<00:02:18.470> a

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
that suggesting it could be set in a

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.979 
that suggesting it could be set in a
high<00:02:18.769> school<00:02:18.830> we've<00:02:19.430> got<00:02:19.549> zombies<00:02:19.819> hunt<00:02:20.269> again

blue background the background actually
looks<00:02:29.150> very<00:02:29.390> similar<00:02:29.599> to<00:02:29.810> die<00:02:30.110> reise<00:02:30.379> so<00:02:30.620> maybe

00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:30.799 
looks very similar to die reise so maybe

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:32.440 
looks very similar to die reise so maybe
that's<00:02:30.980> just<00:02:31.099> another<00:02:31.370> photoshop<00:02:32.030> thing<00:02:32.269> but

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
that's just another photoshop thing but

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.030 
that's just another photoshop thing but
yeah<00:02:32.569> that's<00:02:32.780> basically<00:02:32.959> it<00:02:33.290> for<00:02:33.500> this<00:02:33.860> video

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
yeah that's basically it for this video

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.490 
yeah that's basically it for this video
if<00:02:34.430> we<00:02:34.790> did<00:02:34.970> have<00:02:35.150> dlc<00:02:35.540> that<00:02:35.930> i'm<00:02:35.989> gonna<00:02:36.200> see<00:02:36.409> it

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
if we did have dlc that i'm gonna see it

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.449 
if we did have dlc that i'm gonna see it
becoming<00:02:36.829> what<00:02:37.730> may<00:02:38.569> be<00:02:38.629> late<00:02:38.959> May<00:02:39.230> June<00:02:40.010> time

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
becoming what may be late May June time

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:42.130 
becoming what may be late May June time
around<00:02:40.790> then<00:02:41.060> so<00:02:41.299> that's<00:02:41.690> when<00:02:41.930> we<00:02:41.959> could

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
around then so that's when we could

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.930 
around then so that's when we could
expect<00:02:42.409> the<00:02:42.530> next<00:02:42.560> piece<00:02:43.040> of<00:02:43.190> DLC<00:02:43.700> whether

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
expect the next piece of DLC whether

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.640 
expect the next piece of DLC whether
it's<00:02:44.150> this<00:02:44.329> map<00:02:44.510> orientation<00:02:45.290> or<00:02:45.410> not

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
it's this map orientation or not

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.800 
it's this map orientation or not
personally<00:02:46.220> I<00:02:46.400> probably<00:02:47.150> don't<00:02:47.420> think<00:02:47.540> it

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
personally I probably don't think it

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.180 
personally I probably don't think it
will<00:02:47.930> be<00:02:48.109> this<00:02:48.260> map<00:02:48.470> I<00:02:48.590> think<00:02:48.769> it's<00:02:48.920> a<00:02:49.010> very

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
will be this map I think it's a very
