00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:07.010
 we will draw here a 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.500
 illustration for halloween 

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:11.429
 we will start with pumpkins 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.259
 started by doing a trapeze for 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:18.779
 delimit the size and shape of your 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:22.310
 pumpkin then makes the shape of the 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.310
 pumpkin inside the trapeze 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.000
 then make curved lines like 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:32.920
 those who go to the left on the 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.329
 left part and to the right on the 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.579
 right side to create the 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:38.530
 prospects of the pumpkin does well 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:40.660
 bring out each curve on the top and 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.940
 the bottom like this to show the 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:52.949
 relief of the pumpkin erase the 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:52.949
 unnecessary lines black outlines 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:01:03.430
 then made the pumpkin stalk 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:06.690
 like these and then draw his eyes here 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.690
 drawing them with this form 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.360
 then mouth by making him 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.360
 pointy teeth 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.770
 add a rectangle in each eye 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.350
 to finalize the shape of your 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.890
 first pumpkin 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.570
 now we are going to make a 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.890
 second pumpkin whose shape will be 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.009
 a little different as you go on the 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.009
 see 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.360
 we make him different eyes and 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:45.049
 the teeth in his mouth are not 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:47.259
 represented in the same way we 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:49.490
 add a leaf on the stem 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:54.049
 use an ink pen to blacken 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:55.909
 outlines like this be careful 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:59.600
 passing on the eyes not to do 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:00.679
 the top of the rectangle you have to draw to 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.190
 the pumpkin as if it had been 

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:03.190
 carved 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:13.820
 do the same thing for the second 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.330
 while paying attention to the eyes but 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.330
 also to the teeth 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:28.450
 then erase the pencil to color 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.820
 the pumpkin we will use some 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:34.320
 classic color pencils start 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.320
 by colorful pumpkin in orange 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:43.270
 went well everywhere then brown 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:45.730
 for the stem and glass for the leaf 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:46.990
 of the second pumpkin used from 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.610
 yellow to do the inside of the 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:51.090
 pumpkin as if there was some 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.090
 light inside 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:58.080
 then use red and brown 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.080
 to make the contrasts 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:23.580
 to give them a little cute side 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:24.900
 we add redness on the cheeks on 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:27.000
 will use a black inked pencil 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.540
 to make the contours and so do 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.769
 bring out the drawing thanks to the contrasts 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.510
 for the mouth and the eyes it is better 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:35.780
 use a black pencil to do the 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.780
 shading
