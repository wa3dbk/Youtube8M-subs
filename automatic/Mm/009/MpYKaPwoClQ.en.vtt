00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.259 
lot of you have a device like this
called<00:02:15.910> the<00:02:16.120> chimney<00:02:17.640> what<00:02:18.640> I<00:02:18.670> do<00:02:18.820> is<00:02:18.970> just

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:19.269 
called the chimney what I do is just

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:33.680 
called the chimney what I do is just
dump<00:02:19.540> some<00:02:19.750> on<00:02:19.780> the<00:02:20.019> ground<00:02:22.950> take<00:02:23.950> my<00:02:24.160> lighter

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.710 

in<00:02:34.020> this<00:02:34.380> chimney<00:02:34.710> I<00:02:34.860> have<00:02:35.010> 50<00:02:35.400> briquettes<00:02:35.720> the

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
in this chimney I have 50 briquettes the

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.410 
in this chimney I have 50 briquettes the
standard<00:02:37.140> briquettes<00:02:37.790> then<00:02:38.790> I<00:02:38.910> just<00:02:39.120> place<00:02:39.390> it

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
standard briquettes then I just place it

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.410 
standard briquettes then I just place it
right<00:02:39.750> over<00:02:39.990> the<00:02:40.140> insta<00:02:40.530> fire<00:02:41.270> rather<00:02:42.270> than

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
right over the insta fire rather than

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.350 
right over the insta fire rather than
crumpling<00:02:42.930> paper<00:02:43.100> or<00:02:44.100> starting<00:02:44.610> a<00:02:44.670> fire<00:02:44.880> under

crumpling paper or starting a fire under
the<00:02:45.510> chimney<00:02:45.960> I<00:02:46.140> just<00:02:46.920> simply<00:02:47.220> put<00:02:47.430> the<00:02:47.550> insta

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
the chimney I just simply put the insta

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:54.540 
the chimney I just simply put the insta
fire<00:02:48.090> on<00:02:48.330> there

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:59.610 

you

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:08.560 

15<00:03:00.620> minutes<00:03:04.750> see<00:03:05.750> red<00:03:06.380> hot<00:03:06.650> coals<00:03:06.980> I<00:03:07.480> wanted<00:03:08.480> to

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:08.570 
15 minutes see red hot coals I wanted to

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:10.300 
15 minutes see red hot coals I wanted to
show<00:03:08.720> you<00:03:08.750> how<00:03:09.020> easy<00:03:09.050> it<00:03:09.470> is<00:03:09.530> to<00:03:09.590> start<00:03:09.980> a<00:03:10.040> fire

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
show you how easy it is to start a fire

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.490 
show you how easy it is to start a fire
using<00:03:10.700> insta<00:03:11.300> fire<00:03:11.570> as<00:03:11.870> your<00:03:12.830> fuel<00:03:13.520> source

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
using insta fire as your fuel source

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.370 
using insta fire as your fuel source
just<00:03:15.500> take<00:03:15.709> a<00:03:15.740> little<00:03:15.920> bit<00:03:16.190> of<00:03:16.250> mystifier<00:03:17.380> put

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
just take a little bit of mystifier put

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:23.500 
just take a little bit of mystifier put
it<00:03:18.470> on<00:03:18.590> the<00:03:18.709> ground<00:03:20.170> take<00:03:21.170> a<00:03:21.200> match<00:03:21.530> like<00:03:22.510> the

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
it on the ground take a match like the

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:47.750 
it on the ground take a match like the
white<00:03:26.200> noise

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.520 

then<00:03:48.760> what<00:03:48.910> I<00:03:48.970> do<00:03:49.060> is<00:03:49.240> I<00:03:49.480> just<00:03:49.540> take<00:03:49.720> a<00:03:49.870> few<00:03:50.170> logs

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
then what I do is I just take a few logs

00:03:52.530 --> 00:04:11.559 
then what I do is I just take a few logs
you<00:03:53.530> don't<00:03:53.710> want<00:03:53.890> to<00:03:54.010> smother<00:03:54.280> it

00:04:11.559 --> 00:04:11.569 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:18.050 

just<00:04:12.569> give<00:04:12.870> it<00:04:12.990> a<00:04:13.050> minute<00:04:16.609> that's<00:04:17.609> a<00:04:17.760> beautiful

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
just give it a minute that's a beautiful

thing you can see we use no can lean
just<00:04:23.730> use<00:04:23.910> the<00:04:24.030> insta<00:04:24.270> fire<00:04:24.450> has<00:04:24.660> the<00:04:24.870> kindling

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:25.290 
just use the insta fire has the kindling

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:34.909 
just use the insta fire has the kindling
and<00:04:25.970> just<00:04:26.970> made<00:04:27.180> a<00:04:27.210> nice<00:04:27.480> little<00:04:27.780> campfire<00:04:33.919> so

what we're going to demonstrate now is

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:49.930 
what we're going to demonstrate now is
how<00:04:48.210> to<00:04:48.270> use<00:04:48.480> insta<00:04:48.810> fire<00:04:49.020> as<00:04:49.200> a<00:04:49.230> firestarter

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:49.940 
how to use insta fire as a firestarter

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:53.600 
how to use insta fire as a firestarter
I'll<00:04:50.940> take<00:04:51.710> approximately<00:04:52.710> four<00:04:52.980> ounces<00:04:53.550> of

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
I'll take approximately four ounces of

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.440 
I'll take approximately four ounces of
in<00:04:54.240> sapphire<00:04:54.870> place<00:04:55.260> it<00:04:55.470> in<00:04:55.590> the<00:04:55.620> fire<00:04:55.950> pit

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:56.450

we've<00:04:57.450> made<00:04:57.690> a<00:04:57.750> log<00:04:58.080> cabin<00:04:58.620> fire<00:04:58.830> you<00:04:59.190> can<00:04:59.370> use

00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 
we've made a log cabin fire you can use

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:04.280 
we've made a log cabin fire you can use
a<00:04:59.550> link<00:04:59.910> to<00:05:00.120> fire<00:05:00.419> you<00:05:00.840> can<00:05:01.580> TP<00:05:02.580> fire<00:05:03.060> a<00:05:03.750> lot<00:05:04.169> of

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:04.290 
a link to fire you can TP fire a lot of

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:07.970 
a link to fire you can TP fire a lot of
different<00:05:04.320> fires<00:05:04.830> you<00:05:05.070> can<00:05:05.330> make<00:05:06.380> but<00:05:07.380> will

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:07.980 
different fires you can make but will

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:09.710 
different fires you can make but will
just<00:05:08.160> light<00:05:08.370> it<00:05:08.400> and<00:05:08.700> then<00:05:09.330> we'll<00:05:09.510> show<00:05:09.690> you

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:09.720 
just light it and then we'll show you

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.590 
just light it and then we'll show you
how<00:05:09.900> easy<00:05:09.960> it<00:05:10.380> is<00:05:10.530> to<00:05:10.590> get<00:05:11.580> it<00:05:11.730> started<00:05:12.000> and<00:05:12.390> to
