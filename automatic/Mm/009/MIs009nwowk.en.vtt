full performance exhaust from VW audi

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.330 
full performance exhaust from VW audi
and<00:02:51.120> it<00:02:51.330> does<00:02:51.540> have<00:02:51.780> the<00:02:52.080> resonator<00:02:52.680> way<00:02:53.010> back

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
and it does have the resonator way back

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.070 
and it does have the resonator way back
there<00:02:53.520> you<00:02:53.610> can<00:02:53.760> see<00:02:53.790> much<00:02:54.390> larger<00:02:54.810> than<00:02:54.840> the

there you can see much larger than the
stock<00:02:55.290> resonator<00:02:56.000> it's<00:02:57.000> 2.5<00:02:57.630> all<00:02:57.750> the<00:02:57.840> way

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:08.099 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:10.619 

and<00:03:09.099> it's<00:03:09.430> in<00:03:09.519> high<00:03:09.670> definition<00:03:09.909> there's<00:03:10.480> the

and it's in high definition there's the

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:12.390 
and it's in high definition there's the
cross<00:03:10.900> drilled<00:03:11.109> and<00:03:11.319> slotted<00:03:11.349> rotors<00:03:11.920> we've

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
cross drilled and slotted rotors we've

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:18.839 
cross drilled and slotted rotors we've
had<00:03:12.579> tons<00:03:12.849> of<00:03:13.060> rain<00:03:13.590> and<00:03:15.120> no<00:03:16.120> rust<00:03:17.370> so<00:03:18.370> doing

had tons of rain and no rust so doing

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:22.770 
had tons of rain and no rust so doing
good<00:03:19.030> those<00:03:19.749> are<00:03:19.900> my<00:03:19.930> 0<00:03:19.989> Z<00:03:20.260> Wave<00:03:20.439> wheels<00:03:21.510> in<00:03:22.510> my

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
good those are my 0 Z Wave wheels in my

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.899 
good those are my 0 Z Wave wheels in my
heart<00:03:23.049> they<00:03:23.349> look<00:03:23.560> like<00:03:23.590> the<00:03:23.950> poof<00:03:24.310> isin<00:03:24.730> so

00:03:24.899 --> 00:03:24.909 
heart they look like the poof isin so

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:29.129 
heart they look like the poof isin so
that's<00:03:25.120> why<00:03:25.299> I<00:03:25.569> bought<00:03:26.079> them<00:03:27.299> and<00:03:28.299> they're

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:29.139 
that's why I bought them and they're

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:31.589 
that's why I bought them and they're
definitely<00:03:29.670> reminiscent<00:03:30.670> of<00:03:31.000> the<00:03:31.060> stock

00:03:31.589 --> 00:03:31.599 
definitely reminiscent of the stock

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:33.720 
definitely reminiscent of the stock
wheels<00:03:31.810> only<00:03:32.049> a<00:03:32.200> little<00:03:32.319> bit<00:03:32.609> fancier<00:03:33.609> and<00:03:33.639> I

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
wheels only a little bit fancier and I

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.459 
wheels only a little bit fancier and I
almost<00:03:33.879> like<00:03:34.150> The<00:03:34.359> Maltese<00:03:34.750> Falcon<00:03:34.780> or<00:03:35.379> the

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:35.469 
almost like The Maltese Falcon or the

00:03:35.469 --> 00:03:37.459 
almost like The Maltese Falcon or the

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:37.469 
maltese cross design you can almost see

00:03:37.469 --> 00:03:41.899 
maltese cross design you can almost see
mixed<00:03:38.469> in<00:03:38.590> there<00:03:38.620> the<00:03:38.889> hiring<00:03:39.129> across<00:03:39.400> look<00:03:39.989> so
