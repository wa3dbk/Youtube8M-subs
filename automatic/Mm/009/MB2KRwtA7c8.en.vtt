into<00:00:50.160> it<00:00:50.309> and<00:00:50.520> you<00:00:50.610> just<00:00:50.760> pretty<00:00:51.030> much<00:00:51.180> can

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
into it and you just pretty much can

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.360 
into it and you just pretty much can
drop<00:00:51.539> it<00:00:51.690> anywhere<00:00:51.840> it<00:00:52.320> doesn't<00:00:52.710> go<00:00:53.129> it

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.240 
doesn't budge at all which is really
nice<00:00:54.809> and<00:00:55.079> of<00:00:55.469> course<00:00:55.530> because<00:00:55.980> there<00:00:56.100> aren't

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.490 
ensuing and to me it's sort of a bother
to<00:01:29.250> constantly<00:01:29.970> have<00:01:30.030> to<00:01:30.210> put<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:31.140> labels

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
to constantly have to put the labels

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.990 
to constantly have to put the labels
inside<00:01:31.860> of<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.040> top<00:01:32.220> of<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.430> talent<00:01:32.790> as<00:01:32.880> to

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
inside of the top of the talent as to

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.819 
inside of the top of the talent as to
what<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.210> colors<00:01:33.570> are<00:01:33.720> so<00:01:34.350> I<00:01:34.380> thought<00:01:34.650> that's

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
what the colors are so I thought that's

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.440 
what the colors are so I thought that's
a<00:01:34.979> great<00:01:35.189> idea<00:01:35.310> i'm<00:01:35.549> going<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:35.759> actually<00:01:35.880> mark

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
a great idea i'm going to actually mark

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.719 
a great idea i'm going to actually mark
all<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.750> rest<00:01:37.020> of<00:01:37.170> my<00:01:37.290> eye<00:01:37.320> shadow<00:01:37.740> so<00:01:38.130> i<00:01:38.340> don't

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
all the rest of my eye shadow so i don't

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.219 
all the rest of my eye shadow so i don't
really<00:01:38.759> I'm<00:01:39.180> not<00:01:39.390> really<00:01:39.570> that<00:01:39.750> interested<00:01:40.200> in

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
really I'm not really that interested in

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.630

seeing<00:01:40.500> with<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.680> name<00:01:40.860> is<00:01:41.040> of<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:41.400> shadow

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
seeing with the name is of the shadow

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.069 
seeing with the name is of the shadow
when<00:01:41.880> I'm<00:01:41.970> using<00:01:42.150> it<00:01:42.360> I<00:01:42.420> pretty<00:01:42.630> much<00:01:42.720> know

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
when I'm using it I pretty much know

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.300
