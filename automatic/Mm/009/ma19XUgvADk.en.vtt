00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.009 
fortunately we do manage to get on a bit
of<00:03:09.310> a<00:03:09.550> break<00:03:09.880> and<00:03:10.090> I<00:03:10.180> was<00:03:10.330> really<00:03:10.540> hoping<00:03:10.780> for

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:11.019 
of a break and I was really hoping for

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:12.600 
of a break and I was really hoping for
something<00:03:11.350> like<00:03:11.500> this<00:03:11.560> we<00:03:12.130> manage<00:03:12.489> to

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 
something like this we manage to

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:14.910 
something like this we manage to
actually<00:03:12.640> pull<00:03:13.060> off<00:03:13.420> getting<00:03:14.050> a<00:03:14.440> penalty

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
actually pull off getting a penalty

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.009 
actually pull off getting a penalty
which<00:03:15.069> is<00:03:15.160> really<00:03:15.489> really<00:03:16.330> fortunate<00:03:16.720> because

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
which is really really fortunate because

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:19.229 
which is really really fortunate because
when<00:03:17.320> things<00:03:17.590> like<00:03:17.769> this<00:03:17.799> happen<00:03:17.920> it<00:03:18.880> kind<00:03:19.180> of

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
when things like this happen it kind of

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:20.940 
when things like this happen it kind of
just<00:03:19.420> changes<00:03:19.959> the<00:03:19.989> game<00:03:20.140> a<00:03:20.380> bit<00:03:20.709> and<00:03:20.860> you<00:03:20.920> can

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
just changes the game a bit and you can

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.520 
just changes the game a bit and you can
really<00:03:21.400> feel<00:03:21.549> it<00:03:21.820> like<00:03:22.120> you<00:03:22.720> have<00:03:22.959> a<00:03:22.989> chance<00:03:23.350> of

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
really feel it like you have a chance of

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.199 
really feel it like you have a chance of
getting<00:03:23.560> back<00:03:23.980> into<00:03:24.220> it<00:03:24.400> I<00:03:24.459> kind<00:03:24.549> of<00:03:24.760> did<00:03:25.030> and

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209 
getting back into it I kind of did and

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:27.330 
getting back into it I kind of did and
we<00:03:25.870> do<00:03:26.110> that<00:03:26.290> storage<00:03:26.650> take<00:03:26.890> this<00:03:27.040> so<00:03:27.190> if<00:03:27.280> he

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
we do that storage take this so if he

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.400 
we do that storage take this so if he
does<00:03:27.549> get<00:03:27.700> us<00:03:27.850> in<00:03:28.000> the<00:03:28.390> back<00:03:28.570> of<00:03:28.690> the<00:03:28.750> net<00:03:28.900> it'll

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
xbox froze and just stayed on the screen

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.740 
xbox froze and just stayed on the screen
for<00:03:55.720> ages<00:03:56.230> until<00:03:56.410> a<00:03:56.560> dashboard<00:03:56.859> and<00:03:57.400> I<00:03:58.269> had<00:03:58.600> to

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
for ages until a dashboard and I had to

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.080 
for ages until a dashboard and I had to
load<00:03:58.959> up<00:03:59.109> the<00:03:59.230> game<00:03:59.440> again<00:03:59.890> but<00:04:00.220> we<00:04:00.700> do<00:04:00.820> send

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
load up the game again but we do send

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:02.759 
load up the game again but we do send
over<00:04:01.390> the<00:04:01.480> course<00:04:01.720> we've<00:04:01.959> got<00:04:02.079> a<00:04:02.109> fairly<00:04:02.350> big

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:02.769 
over the course we've got a fairly big

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:05.819 
over the course we've got a fairly big
total<00:04:03.250> again<00:04:03.670> got<00:04:04.239> enough<00:04:04.510> to<00:04:04.959> get<00:04:05.170> probably<00:04:05.739> a

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:05.829 
total again got enough to get probably a

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:07.710 
total again got enough to get probably a
decent<00:04:06.280> player<00:04:06.430> but<00:04:06.850> I<00:04:07.060> think<00:04:07.480> I<00:04:07.660> should

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
decent player but I think I should

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.380 
decent player but I think I should
probably<00:04:07.930> save<00:04:08.260> my<00:04:08.470> coins<00:04:08.799> for<00:04:09.549> maybe<00:04:09.790> someone

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390 
probably save my coins for maybe someone

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:12.240 
probably save my coins for maybe someone
like<00:04:10.570> Suarez<00:04:10.930> or<00:04:11.380> Rooney<00:04:11.769> someone<00:04:12.100> that's

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
like Suarez or Rooney someone that's

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.400 
like Suarez or Rooney someone that's
really<00:04:12.700> gonna<00:04:12.850> change<00:04:13.090> the<00:04:13.329> game<00:04:13.480> up<00:04:13.690> in<00:04:13.840> the
