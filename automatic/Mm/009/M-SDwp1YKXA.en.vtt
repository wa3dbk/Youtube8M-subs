00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
take that on there so I can so it

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.149 
take that on there so I can so it
wouldn't<00:03:16.069> come<00:03:16.400> apart<00:03:17.180> and<00:03:17.569> then<00:03:18.230> there<00:03:19.069> you

00:03:19.149 --> 00:03:19.159 
wouldn't come apart and then there you

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:21.900 
wouldn't come apart and then there you
go

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:27.090
