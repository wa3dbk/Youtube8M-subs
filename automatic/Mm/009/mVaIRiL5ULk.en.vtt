think the whites are at about i'm going
to<00:06:47.240> say<00:06:47.390> seventy-five<00:06:48.140> percent<00:06:49.210> the<00:06:50.210> Blues

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:50.540 
to say seventy-five percent the Blues

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:55.540 
to say seventy-five percent the Blues
are<00:06:51.340> about<00:06:52.930> 50<00:06:53.930> or<00:06:54.169> forty<00:06:54.620> percent<00:06:54.980> something

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:55.550 
are about 50 or forty percent something

00:06:55.550 --> 00:07:00.909 
are about 50 or forty percent something
like<00:06:55.700> that<00:06:56.500> so<00:06:57.500> I<00:06:57.530> have<00:06:57.860> plenty<00:06:58.160> of<00:06:59.620> light<00:07:00.620> to

00:07:00.909 --> 00:07:00.919 
like that so I have plenty of light to

00:07:00.919 --> 00:07:04.540 
like that so I have plenty of light to
provide<00:07:01.400> in<00:07:01.790> the<00:07:02.750> future<00:07:03.229> if<00:07:03.530> they<00:07:03.890> need<00:07:04.130> more
