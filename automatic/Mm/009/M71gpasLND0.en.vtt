right there right there like that so we

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.420 
right there right there like that so we
get<00:01:14.840> that<00:01:15.020> in<00:01:15.170> there<00:01:15.350> that's<00:01:15.530> your<00:01:15.680> setup<00:01:16.040> so

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
and that's it you're done so then you

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.389 
and that's it you're done so then you

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
can you can go up to 12 so I'll just do

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.420 
can you can go up to 12 so I'll just do
I<00:02:18.370> guess<00:02:19.370> I'll<00:02:19.520> do<00:02:19.610> that<00:02:19.730> mini<00:02:20.560> like<00:02:21.560> that<00:02:22.010> so

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
I guess I'll do that mini like that so

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.550 
I guess I'll do that mini like that so
you<00:02:22.520> can<00:02:22.640> go<00:02:22.760> up<00:02:22.819> to<00:02:22.940> 12<00:02:23.240> blocks<00:02:23.540> this<00:02:23.720> way<00:02:23.780> once

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
you can go up to 12 blocks this way once

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:25.750 
you can go up to 12 blocks this way once
you<00:02:24.650> get<00:02:24.800> to<00:02:24.890> the<00:02:24.980> end<00:02:25.160> you<00:02:25.400> want<00:02:25.490> to<00:02:25.580> make<00:02:25.670> sure

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
you get to the end you want to make sure

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.050 
you get to the end you want to make sure
you<00:02:25.970> put<00:02:26.150> that<00:02:26.180> piston<00:02:26.980> to<00:02:27.980> 2<00:02:28.430> away<00:02:28.700> from<00:02:28.880> that

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
you put that piston to 2 away from that

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.110 
you put that piston to 2 away from that
facing<00:02:29.720> in<00:02:29.900> like<00:02:30.110> that<00:02:30.350> and<00:02:30.730> it's<00:02:31.730> basically

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
facing in like that and it's basically

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.860 
facing in like that and it's basically
the<00:02:32.300> same<00:02:32.480> principle

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
the same principle

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.089 
the same principle
put<00:02:33.989> your<00:02:34.140> blocks<00:02:34.290> down<00:02:34.530> like<00:02:34.650> that<00:02:34.830> come

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.099 
put your blocks down like that come

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:42.140 
put your blocks down like that come
around<00:02:35.280> the<00:02:35.430> back<00:02:36.950> torch<00:02:40.010> torch<00:02:41.010> and<00:02:41.580> then<00:02:41.819> run

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
around the back torch torch and then run

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.140 
around the back torch torch and then run
your<00:02:42.180> dust<00:02:42.599> going<00:02:43.019> down<00:02:43.260> there<00:02:43.470> and<00:02:44.150> then

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
your dust going down there and then

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.100 
your dust going down there and then
you're<00:02:45.300> going<00:02:45.390> to<00:02:45.450> want<00:02:45.629> to<00:02:45.750> put<00:02:45.930> in<00:02:46.080> your

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
you're going to want to put in your

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.380 
you're going to want to put in your
pistons<00:02:46.739> make<00:02:47.370> sure<00:02:47.489> it's<00:02:47.640> one<00:02:47.910> away<00:02:48.150> from

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
pistons make sure it's one away from

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.300 
pistons make sure it's one away from
each<00:02:48.510> piston<00:02:48.780> so<00:02:49.200> your<00:02:49.379> first<00:02:49.560> sticky<00:02:49.920> piston

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
each piston so your first sticky piston

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:56.619 
each piston so your first sticky piston
would<00:02:51.060> go<00:02:52.280> right<00:02:53.280> here<00:02:53.910> and<00:02:54.769> then<00:02:55.769> you<00:02:55.920> just

00:02:56.619 --> 00:02:56.629 
would go right here and then you just

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:59.150 
would go right here and then you just
count<00:02:57.629> two<00:02:57.810> away<00:02:58.019> from<00:02:58.170> that<00:02:58.349> put<00:02:58.709> another<00:02:58.890> one

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
count two away from that put another one

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.619 
count two away from that put another one
and<00:02:59.430> two<00:02:59.580> away<00:02:59.670> from<00:02:59.760> that<00:03:00.060> one<00:03:00.239> put<00:03:00.390> another

00:03:00.619 --> 00:03:00.629 
and two away from that one put another

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:03.500 
and two away from that one put another
one<00:03:00.870> so<00:03:01.709> it's<00:03:01.830> like<00:03:01.950> that<00:03:02.220> and<00:03:02.489> then<00:03:03.209> you<00:03:03.330> come

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
one so it's like that and then you come

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.180 
one so it's like that and then you come
back<00:03:03.540> around<00:03:03.810> the<00:03:04.019> back<00:03:04.260> put<00:03:05.190> in<00:03:05.370> your<00:03:07.190> we're

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
back around the back put in your we're

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:09.470 
back around the back put in your we're
going<00:03:08.310> to<00:03:08.400> go<00:03:08.519> right<00:03:08.730> on<00:03:08.760> top<00:03:09.000> of<00:03:09.180> this<00:03:09.269> and

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
going to go right on top of this and

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.750 
going to go right on top of this and
grab<00:03:09.630> the<00:03:09.750> signal<00:03:10.049> from<00:03:10.170> here<00:03:10.440> and<00:03:10.650> then<00:03:11.489> just

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
grab the signal from here and then just

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.559 
grab the signal from here and then just
go<00:03:12.420> up<00:03:12.690> one<00:03:13.079> from<00:03:13.319> there<00:03:13.500> and<00:03:13.799> bring<00:03:14.280> it<00:03:14.400> over

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:14.569 
go up one from there and bring it over

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:17.569 
go up one from there and bring it over
to<00:03:15.569> the<00:03:15.660> top<00:03:15.840> of<00:03:15.989> that<00:03:16.110> last<00:03:16.349> piston<00:03:16.920> putting<00:03:17.519> a

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:17.579 
to the top of that last piston putting a

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:20.420 
to the top of that last piston putting a
repeater<00:03:17.940> right<00:03:18.299> there<00:03:18.680> with<00:03:19.680> dust<00:03:20.040> running

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
repeater right there with dust running

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.390 
repeater right there with dust running
along<00:03:20.730> like<00:03:21.720> that<00:03:21.920> so<00:03:22.920> now<00:03:23.069> it's<00:03:23.099> the<00:03:23.220> same

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
along like that so now it's the same

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:30.050 
along like that so now it's the same
thing<00:03:23.730> just<00:03:24.290> put<00:03:25.290> in<00:03:25.440> your<00:03:25.560> wall<00:03:27.590> and<00:03:28.640> then<00:03:29.640> of

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
thing just put in your wall and then of

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.759 
thing just put in your wall and then of
course<00:03:30.299> you<00:03:30.420> cover<00:03:30.959> it<00:03:31.079> up<00:03:31.170> here<00:03:31.379> real<00:03:31.560> quick

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
course you cover it up here real quick

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:34.130 
course you cover it up here real quick
and<00:03:31.950> then<00:03:32.670> put<00:03:33.000> your<00:03:33.120> button<00:03:33.420> in<00:03:33.569> you<00:03:33.900> can<00:03:34.049> do

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
and then put your button in you can do

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:35.690 
and then put your button in you can do
anywhere<00:03:34.560> you<00:03:34.680> want<00:03:34.920> you<00:03:35.069> can<00:03:35.160> put<00:03:35.340> any<00:03:35.519> of

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
anywhere you want you can put any of

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.300 
anywhere you want you can put any of
these<00:03:35.819> in<00:03:36.230> doesn't<00:03:37.230> matter<00:03:37.379> anywhere<00:03:38.069> along

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
these in doesn't matter anywhere along

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.400 
these in doesn't matter anywhere along
that<00:03:38.519> dust<00:03:38.790> where<00:03:39.389> to<00:03:39.690> send<00:03:39.930> that<00:03:40.079> signal<00:03:40.230> to

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
that dust where to send that signal to

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.569 
that dust where to send that signal to
that<00:03:40.530> dust<00:03:40.889> will<00:03:41.160> be<00:03:41.190> good<00:03:41.489> and<00:03:41.850> then<00:03:42.780> hit<00:03:43.019> it

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:43.579 
that dust will be good and then hit it

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:47.000 
that dust will be good and then hit it
you<00:03:44.579> can<00:03:44.700> see<00:03:44.880> it<00:03:44.940> I<00:03:45.000> swap<00:03:45.239> it<00:03:45.389> out<00:03:45.769> of<00:03:46.769> course

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
you can see it I swap it out of course

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.390 
you can see it I swap it out of course
you<00:03:47.130> can<00:03:47.250> do<00:03:47.370> glowstone<00:03:47.910> if<00:03:48.450> you<00:03:48.660> wanted

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
you can do glowstone if you wanted

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:54.740 
you can do glowstone if you wanted
instead<00:03:51.380> for<00:03:52.380> lighting<00:03:53.389> so<00:03:54.389> that's<00:03:54.540> a<00:03:54.630> good

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
instead for lighting so that's a good

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.289 
instead for lighting so that's a good
way<00:03:54.900> to<00:03:54.930> do<00:03:55.170> a<00:03:55.200> side<00:03:55.590> proof<00:03:56.430> for<00:03:56.790> the<00:03:56.849> wall<00:03:57.030> for

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:57.299 
way to do a side proof for the wall for

00:03:57.299 --> 00:03:58.640 
way to do a side proof for the wall for
the<00:03:57.359> ground<00:03:57.750> you're<00:03:58.079> going<00:03:58.170> to<00:03:58.260> want<00:03:58.500> it

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
the ground you're going to want it

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.620 
the ground you're going to want it
you're<00:03:58.799> gonna<00:03:58.889> have<00:03:58.980> to<00:03:59.160> dig<00:03:59.430> but<00:03:59.700> it's<00:04:00.510> the

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
you're gonna have to dig but it's the

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:02.150 
you're gonna have to dig but it's the
same<00:04:00.840> thing<00:04:00.900> you're<00:04:01.410> going<00:04:01.530> to<00:04:01.620> dig<00:04:01.980> down

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
same thing you're going to dig down

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.960 
same thing you're going to dig down
three<00:04:03.060> I'm<00:04:04.019> sorry<00:04:04.349> too<00:04:04.769> and<00:04:05.069> put<00:04:05.579> down<00:04:05.730> these

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
three I'm sorry too and put down these

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.300 
three I'm sorry too and put down these
pistons<00:04:06.480> and<00:04:06.660> then<00:04:07.560> put<00:04:07.739> in<00:04:07.829> your<00:04:07.859> whatever

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
pistons and then put in your whatever

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.780 
pistons and then put in your whatever
blocks<00:04:08.669> you<00:04:08.819> want<00:04:09.030> however<00:04:09.870> long<00:04:10.200> you<00:04:10.380> want

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:10.790 
blocks you want however long you want

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:14.390 
blocks you want however long you want
we'll<00:04:11.790> do<00:04:12.500> that<00:04:13.500> like<00:04:13.680> that<00:04:13.919> would<00:04:14.099> be<00:04:14.190> good

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
we'll do that like that would be good

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.920 
we'll do that like that would be good
and<00:04:14.639> then<00:04:15.410> now<00:04:16.410> put<00:04:16.739> in<00:04:16.859> your<00:04:17.070> regular<00:04:17.459> piston

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 
and then now put in your regular piston

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.050 
and then now put in your regular piston
and<00:04:18.930> count<00:04:19.229> three<00:04:19.620> and<00:04:19.829> put<00:04:20.400> it<00:04:20.519> facing<00:04:20.910> in

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
and count three and put it facing in

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.110 
and count three and put it facing in
like<00:04:21.239> that<00:04:21.950> now<00:04:22.950> for<00:04:23.550> the<00:04:23.639> ground<00:04:23.910> you're

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
like that now for the ground you're

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.360 
like that now for the ground you're
going<00:04:24.270> to<00:04:24.330> have<00:04:24.479> to<00:04:24.599> put<00:04:24.810> your<00:04:25.710> sticky<00:04:26.010> pistons

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
going to have to put your sticky pistons

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:28.150 
going to have to put your sticky pistons
facing<00:04:26.520> up<00:04:26.940> right<00:04:27.330> there

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 
facing up right there

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:33.230 
facing up right there
like<00:04:29.160> that<00:04:29.400> not<00:04:29.639> up<00:04:30.450> for<00:04:31.020> is<00:04:31.200> not<00:04:31.380> sideways<00:04:32.240> so

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
like that not up for is not sideways so

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.620 
like that not up for is not sideways so
like<00:04:33.510> that<00:04:33.810> so<00:04:34.710> to<00:04:34.770> get<00:04:35.010> the<00:04:35.160> signal<00:04:35.580> for<00:04:36.300> that

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 
like that so to get the signal for that

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:42.619 
like that so to get the signal for that
you're<00:04:37.050> going<00:04:37.229> to<00:04:37.260> put<00:04:37.560> it<00:04:37.710> on<00:04:37.979> a<00:04:39.020> block<00:04:40.020> right

00:04:42.619 --> 00:04:42.629 
you're going to put it on a block right

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:46.739 

here<00:04:43.629> underneath<00:04:43.990> it<00:04:44.259> with<00:04:44.889> a<00:04:45.330> torch<00:04:46.330> on<00:04:46.479> this

00:04:46.739 --> 00:04:46.749 
here underneath it with a torch on this

00:04:46.749 --> 00:04:49.469 
here underneath it with a torch on this
side<00:04:47.020> the<00:04:47.620> block<00:04:48.030> since<00:04:49.030> we're<00:04:49.180> on<00:04:49.270> the<00:04:49.360> ground

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:49.479 
side the block since we're on the ground

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:51.209 
side the block since we're on the ground
it<00:04:49.749> doesn't<00:04:49.780> matter<00:04:50.169> which<00:04:50.379> side<00:04:50.409> and<00:04:50.979> then

00:04:51.209 --> 00:04:51.219 
it doesn't matter which side and then

00:04:51.219 --> 00:04:53.369 
it doesn't matter which side and then
put<00:04:51.400> a<00:04:51.430> torch<00:04:51.729> there<00:04:51.969> with<00:04:52.120> a<00:04:52.150> block<00:04:52.419> and<00:04:52.960> come

00:04:53.369 --> 00:04:53.379 
put a torch there with a block and come

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:55.050 
put a torch there with a block and come
around<00:04:53.469> the<00:04:53.680> other<00:04:53.800> side<00:04:54.129> put<00:04:54.490> dust<00:04:54.879> down

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:55.060 
around the other side put dust down

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:56.790 
around the other side put dust down
there<00:04:55.330> on<00:04:55.539> each<00:04:55.689> side<00:04:55.990> of<00:04:56.110> the<00:04:56.199> block<00:04:56.409> and<00:04:56.650> then

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:56.800 
there on each side of the block and then

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.399 
there on each side of the block and then
dig<00:04:57.039> our<00:04:57.219> trench<00:04:57.610> right<00:04:57.969> here<00:04:58.379> with<00:04:59.379> a

00:04:59.399 --> 00:04:59.409 
dig our trench right here with a

00:04:59.409 --> 00:05:01.200 
dig our trench right here with a
repeater<00:04:59.830> facing<00:05:00.189> and<00:05:00.610> each<00:05:00.789> one<00:05:01.060> of<00:05:01.090> those

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.210 
repeater facing and each one of those

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:05.040 
repeater facing and each one of those
dusts<00:05:01.749> and<00:05:01.900> then<00:05:02.590> line<00:05:03.219> that<00:05:03.490> with<00:05:03.639> dust<00:05:04.050> now

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.050 
dusts and then line that with dust now

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:08.369 
dusts and then line that with dust now
on<00:05:05.229> this<00:05:05.409> side<00:05:05.650> you're<00:05:05.949> just<00:05:05.979> going<00:05:06.400> to<00:05:07.379> grab

00:05:08.369 --> 00:05:08.379 
on this side you're just going to grab

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:09.629 
on this side you're just going to grab
the<00:05:08.499> signal<00:05:08.800> from<00:05:08.889> that<00:05:08.979> torch<00:05:09.400> with<00:05:09.580> a

00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:09.639 
the signal from that torch with a

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:12.089 
the signal from that torch with a
repeater<00:05:09.999> right<00:05:10.270> there<00:05:10.719> and<00:05:11.590> then<00:05:11.979> you're

00:05:12.089 --> 00:05:12.099 
repeater right there and then you're

00:05:12.099 --> 00:05:14.189 
repeater right there and then you're
going<00:05:12.219> to<00:05:12.279> put<00:05:12.520> two<00:05:12.789> blocks<00:05:12.969> or<00:05:13.689> mean<00:05:13.900> line

00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:14.199 
going to put two blocks or mean line

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:16.490 
going to put two blocks or mean line
that<00:05:14.469> will<00:05:14.620> block<00:05:14.800> so<00:05:15.069> it<00:05:15.189> hits<00:05:15.400> each<00:05:15.580> piston

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:16.500 
that will block so it hits each piston

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.019 
that will block so it hits each piston
like<00:05:17.500> that<00:05:17.770> and<00:05:18.069> then<00:05:18.340> you<00:05:18.520> line<00:05:18.729> that<00:05:18.879> with

00:05:19.019 --> 00:05:19.029 
like that and then you line that with

00:05:19.029 --> 00:05:22.640 
like that and then you line that with
dust<00:05:19.650> now<00:05:20.650> you're<00:05:20.860> done<00:05:21.069> so<00:05:21.430> just<00:05:21.460> put<00:05:21.849> in<00:05:21.969> your

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:22.650 
dust now you're done so just put in your

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:24.899 
dust now you're done so just put in your
button<00:05:23.650> your<00:05:23.889> input<00:05:24.250> would<00:05:24.340> be<00:05:24.460> that<00:05:24.610> line<00:05:24.759> of

00:05:24.899 --> 00:05:24.909 
button your input would be that line of

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:26.390 
button your input would be that line of
dust<00:05:25.120> right<00:05:25.300> there<00:05:25.479> so<00:05:25.719> just<00:05:25.870> put<00:05:26.139> in<00:05:26.319> your

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 
dust right there so just put in your

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:31.860 
dust right there so just put in your
button<00:05:27.400> and<00:05:28.680> then<00:05:29.680> there<00:05:29.889> you<00:05:29.979> go<00:05:30.840> so<00:05:31.840> that

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:31.870 
button and then there you go so that

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:34.469 
button and then there you go so that
would<00:05:32.169> be<00:05:32.289> your<00:05:32.469> floor<00:05:32.770> right<00:05:33.129> there<00:05:33.419> so<00:05:34.419> you

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:34.479 
would be your floor right there so you

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:36.320 
would be your floor right there so you
get<00:05:34.689> floor<00:05:34.930> lighting<00:05:35.319> or<00:05:35.589> whatever<00:05:35.889> you<00:05:36.009> want

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:36.330 
get floor lighting or whatever you want

it's going to be two up from the ceiling
you're<00:05:45.669> going<00:05:45.819> to<00:05:45.879> put<00:05:46.060> in<00:05:46.210> regular<00:05:46.659> pistons

00:05:47.189 --> 00:05:47.199 
you're going to put in regular pistons

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:48.089 
you're going to put in regular pistons
facing<00:05:47.409> each<00:05:47.710> other

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:11.250 
torch run your redstone signal like this

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:13.800 
torch run your redstone signal like this
all<00:06:12.250> the<00:06:12.399> way<00:06:12.430> over<00:06:12.759> like<00:06:12.789> that<00:06:13.149> and<00:06:13.509> put

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:13.810 
all the way over like that and put

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:16.200 
all the way over like that and put
another<00:06:13.899> torch<00:06:14.550> and<00:06:15.550> you're<00:06:15.819> just<00:06:15.909> gonna<00:06:16.060> line

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:16.210 
another torch and you're just gonna line

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:18.659 
another torch and you're just gonna line
that<00:06:16.389> with<00:06:16.509> dust<00:06:16.830> and<00:06:17.830> your<00:06:17.949> pistons<00:06:18.370> they<00:06:18.520> got

00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:18.669 
that with dust and your pistons they got

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:23.159 
that with dust and your pistons they got
to<00:06:18.789> be<00:06:18.939> right<00:06:20.430> here<00:06:21.430> so<00:06:21.669> get<00:06:22.539> up<00:06:22.719> and<00:06:22.930> put<00:06:23.139> a

00:06:23.159 --> 00:06:23.169 
to be right here so get up and put a

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:25.939 
to be right here so get up and put a
sticky<00:06:24.009> piston<00:06:24.159> facing<00:06:24.430> down<00:06:24.879> right<00:06:25.389> there<00:06:25.659> I

00:06:25.939 --> 00:06:25.949 
sticky piston facing down right there I

00:06:25.949 --> 00:06:27.959 
sticky piston facing down right there I
don't<00:06:26.949> know<00:06:27.069> why<00:06:27.339> it<00:06:27.399> does<00:06:27.639> that<00:06:27.849> it's

00:06:27.959 --> 00:06:27.969 
don't know why it does that it's

00:06:27.969 --> 00:06:32.610 
don't know why it does that it's
glitched<00:06:28.270> out<00:06:28.449> but<00:06:28.870> yeah<00:06:29.020> it<00:06:29.080> is<00:06:29.289> down<00:06:29.849> so<00:06:31.620> yeah

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:32.620 
glitched out but yeah it is down so yeah

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:35.700 
glitched out but yeah it is down so yeah
right<00:06:32.889> like<00:06:33.189> that<00:06:33.750> put<00:06:34.750> another<00:06:35.050> one<00:06:35.319> and

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:35.710 
right like that put another one and

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:38.850 
right like that put another one and
another<00:06:36.699> one<00:06:37.050> so<00:06:38.050> you're<00:06:38.229> good<00:06:38.439> right<00:06:38.469> there

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:38.860 
another one so you're good right there

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:40.679 
another one so you're good right there
now<00:06:39.279> to<00:06:39.339> get<00:06:39.580> the<00:06:39.669> signal<00:06:40.060> from<00:06:40.210> that<00:06:40.419> torch

00:06:40.679 --> 00:06:40.689 
now to get the signal from that torch

00:06:40.689 --> 00:06:43.999 
now to get the signal from that torch
just<00:06:41.199> put<00:06:42.159> a<00:06:42.219> block<00:06:42.430> there<00:06:42.639> with<00:06:42.849> dust<00:06:43.149> and

00:06:43.999 --> 00:06:44.009 
just put a block there with dust and

00:06:44.009 --> 00:06:46.920 
just put a block there with dust and
then<00:06:45.009> you're<00:06:45.189> going<00:06:45.279> to<00:06:45.370> run<00:06:46.180> it<00:06:46.330> over<00:06:46.509> one

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:46.930 
then you're going to run it over one

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:50.129 
then you're going to run it over one
with<00:06:47.439> a<00:06:47.469> repeater<00:06:47.889> and<00:06:48.149> then<00:06:49.149> from<00:06:49.479> that<00:06:49.509> just

00:06:50.129 --> 00:06:50.139 
with a repeater and then from that just

00:06:50.139 --> 00:06:51.899 
with a repeater and then from that just
run<00:06:50.680> this<00:06:50.860> all<00:06:51.009> the<00:06:51.069> way<00:06:51.190> over<00:06:51.430> to<00:06:51.550> that<00:06:51.580> last

00:06:51.899 --> 00:06:51.909 
run this all the way over to that last

00:06:51.909 --> 00:06:54.210 
run this all the way over to that last
piston<00:06:52.389> and<00:06:52.659> then<00:06:52.750> line<00:06:52.930> that<00:06:53.110> with<00:06:53.229> dust

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:54.220 
piston and then line that with dust

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:56.130 
piston and then line that with dust
now<00:06:54.670> your<00:06:54.820> inputs<00:06:55.210> this<00:06:55.390> lino<00:06:55.660> dust<00:06:55.960> right

00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:56.140 
now your inputs this lino dust right

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:57.690 
now your inputs this lino dust right
here<00:06:56.320> so<00:06:56.560> you<00:06:56.620> can<00:06:56.800> we<00:06:57.070> can<00:06:57.190> put<00:06:57.340> a<00:06:57.370> button

00:06:57.690 --> 00:06:57.700 
here so you can we can put a button

00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:01.260 
here so you can we can put a button
right<00:06:57.730> there<00:06:57.910> and<00:06:59.610> you<00:07:00.610> see<00:07:00.790> it<00:07:00.880> swaps<00:07:01.150> them

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:01.270 
right there and you see it swaps them

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:01.710 
right there and you see it swaps them
out

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:01.720 
out

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:08.330 
out
so<00:07:02.290> there's<00:07:02.470> your<00:07:02.620> ceiling<00:07:03.780> right<00:07:04.780> like<00:07:04.960> that

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:08.340 

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:13.950 

don't<00:07:09.340> need<00:07:09.460> them<00:07:09.670> here<00:07:09.880> we<00:07:10.390> go<00:07:12.660> so<00:07:13.660> but<00:07:13.870> your

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:13.960 
don't need them here we go so but your

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:15.600 
don't need them here we go so but your
ceiling<00:07:14.320> up<00:07:14.440> there<00:07:14.680> of<00:07:14.890> course<00:07:15.130> you<00:07:15.250> get<00:07:15.490> the

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:15.610 
ceiling up there of course you get the

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:17.730 
ceiling up there of course you get the
signal<00:07:16.030> put<00:07:16.840> a<00:07:16.870> button<00:07:17.140> somewhere<00:07:17.440> else

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:17.740 
signal put a button somewhere else

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:19.290 
signal put a button somewhere else
obviously<00:07:18.340> but<00:07:18.550> just<00:07:18.580> lead<00:07:18.880> the<00:07:19.000> button

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:19.300 
obviously but just lead the button

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:22.740 
obviously but just lead the button
signal<00:07:19.690> to<00:07:20.700> that<00:07:21.700> line<00:07:21.880> of<00:07:21.910> dust<00:07:22.270> right<00:07:22.480> there

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:22.750 
signal to that line of dust right there

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:24.990 
signal to that line of dust right there
and<00:07:23.080> you<00:07:23.830> get<00:07:24.040> that<00:07:24.250> so<00:07:24.460> that<00:07:24.610> should<00:07:24.790> cover

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:25.000 
and you get that so that should cover

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.180 
and you get that so that should cover
all<00:07:25.120> of<00:07:25.420> them<00:07:25.600> on<00:07:25.780> the<00:07:25.810> floor<00:07:26.170> ceiling<00:07:26.860> and

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:27.190 
all of them on the floor ceiling and

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:30.780 
all of them on the floor ceiling and
wall<00:07:27.630> swappers<00:07:28.630> so<00:07:29.440> I<00:07:29.470> hope<00:07:29.650> you<00:07:29.770> enjoyed<00:07:30.100> if

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:30.790 
wall swappers so I hope you enjoyed if

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:32.370 
wall swappers so I hope you enjoyed if
