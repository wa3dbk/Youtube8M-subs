00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
there really and so it has an arrow on

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.190 
there really and so it has an arrow on
it<00:01:54.930> and<00:01:56.119> that's<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.329> inside<00:01:57.630> that<00:01:57.780> plugs<00:01:58.020> into

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
it and that's the inside that plugs into

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.790 
it and that's the inside that plugs into
here<00:01:58.290> so<00:01:59.130> you<00:01:59.219> want<00:01:59.340> to<00:01:59.490> put<00:01:59.670> the<00:01:59.790> arrow

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:02.800 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.350 

so<00:02:03.800> you're<00:02:03.920> going<00:02:04.040> to<00:02:04.130> put<00:02:04.370> the<00:02:04.520> arrow<00:02:05.860> towards

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
so you're going to put the arrow towards

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.290 
so you're going to put the arrow towards
the<00:02:08.360> black<00:02:08.770> ground<00:02:09.770> wire<00:02:10.009> that's<00:02:10.850> the<00:02:11.030> only

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
the black ground wire that's the only

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:16.510 
the black ground wire that's the only
way<00:02:11.420> it'll<00:02:11.570> work<00:02:12.790> so<00:02:13.790> all<00:02:14.330> you<00:02:14.480> do<00:02:14.660> is<00:02:15.490> push<00:02:16.490> it

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
way it'll work so all you do is push it

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.449 
way it'll work so all you do is push it
down<00:02:17.650> make<00:02:18.650> sure<00:02:18.680> it's<00:02:18.830> all<00:02:19.010> the<00:02:19.100> way<00:02:19.130> and<00:02:19.400> you

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
down make sure it's all the way and you

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:22.660 
down make sure it's all the way and you
want<00:02:19.640> to<00:02:19.730> make<00:02:19.880> sure<00:02:20.110> this<00:02:21.110> covers<00:02:21.830> everything

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
want to make sure this covers everything

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.760 
want to make sure this covers everything
because<00:02:23.300> you<00:02:23.390> don't<00:02:23.600> want<00:02:23.780> any<00:02:24.050> water<00:02:24.320> to<00:02:24.650> get

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 
because you don't want any water to get

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:30.910 
because you don't want any water to get
in<00:02:24.890> there<00:02:29.080> see<00:02:30.080> how<00:02:30.140> it's<00:02:30.290> kind<00:02:30.500> of<00:02:30.590> over<00:02:30.860> it

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
in there see how it's kind of over it

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.199 
in there see how it's kind of over it
right<00:02:31.070> there<00:02:31.250> you<00:02:31.580> just<00:02:31.700> want<00:02:31.790> to<00:02:31.940> pull<00:02:32.120> it

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
right there you just want to pull it

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:35.650 
right there you just want to pull it
over<00:02:32.330> and<00:02:33.250> make<00:02:34.250> sure<00:02:34.430> it<00:02:34.550> seals<00:02:34.790> up<00:02:35.030> nice<00:02:35.420> and

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
over and make sure it seals up nice and

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.340 
over and make sure it seals up nice and
good<00:02:35.750> now<00:02:36.530> what<00:02:37.100> you<00:02:37.190> can<00:02:37.400> do<00:02:37.670> is<00:02:37.940> you<00:02:38.750> also<00:02:39.020> can

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
good now what you can do is you also can

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.620 
good now what you can do is you also can
get<00:02:39.470> some<00:02:39.620> electrical<00:02:40.130> tape<00:02:40.420> and<00:02:41.420> put<00:02:41.600> it

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
get some electrical tape and put it

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.830 
get some electrical tape and put it
around<00:02:41.780> it<00:02:42.170> just<00:02:42.920> so<00:02:43.130> it<00:02:43.730> seals<00:02:44.330> that<00:02:44.420> nothing

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
around it just so it seals that nothing

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.900 
around it just so it seals that nothing
gets<00:02:45.020> in<00:02:45.140> there<00:02:45.320> but<00:02:45.620> this<00:02:46.010> works<00:02:46.610> pretty<00:02:46.760> well

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
gets in there but this works pretty well

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:52.690 
gets in there but this works pretty well
so<00:02:47.209> it's<00:02:47.840> all<00:02:47.989> the<00:02:48.110> way<00:02:48.140> on<00:02:48.230> there<00:02:48.550> and<00:02:50.770> now<00:02:51.770> you

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
so it's all the way on there and now you

00:02:52.700 --> 00:03:01.840 
so it's all the way on there and now you
put<00:02:52.910> your<00:02:52.940> light<00:02:53.180> bulb<00:02:53.420> in<00:02:54.100> this<00:02:55.100> part<00:03:00.850> just

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:01.850 
put your light bulb in this part just

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.870 
put your light bulb in this part just
like<00:03:01.940> so<00:03:02.150> and<00:03:02.330> then<00:03:02.930> you<00:03:03.140> put<00:03:03.739> this<00:03:03.920> back<00:03:04.610> in

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 
like so and then you put this back in

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.720 
like so and then you put this back in
the<00:03:05.060> housing<00:03:05.390> and<00:03:05.860> then<00:03:06.860> you<00:03:07.130> just<00:03:07.310> kind<00:03:07.549> of

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
the housing and then you just kind of

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.539 
the housing and then you just kind of
suck<00:03:08.330> it<00:03:08.450> down<00:03:08.600> out<00:03:08.870> of<00:03:08.989> the<00:03:09.049> way<00:03:09.080> and<00:03:09.709> you<00:03:10.370> put

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:10.549 
suck it down out of the way and you put

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:12.910 
suck it down out of the way and you put
the<00:03:10.640> plastic<00:03:10.820> cover<00:03:11.180> back<00:03:11.269> on<00:03:11.630> and<00:03:12.019> you're

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
the plastic cover back on and you're

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.750 
the plastic cover back on and you're
done

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760
