00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.249 
blogging for a while so I wore the grape
here<00:02:05.549> a<00:02:05.579> couple<00:02:05.820> years<00:02:06.030> back<00:02:06.270> and<00:02:06.930> I'll

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
here a couple years back and I'll

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.260 
here a couple years back and I'll
probably<00:02:07.500> linked<00:02:07.890> to<00:02:08.009> that<00:02:08.069> post<00:02:08.459> as<00:02:08.759> well<00:02:09.000> and

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
probably linked to that post as well and

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.020 
probably linked to that post as well and
the<00:02:10.110> black<00:02:10.349> pair<00:02:10.679> popped<00:02:11.069> up<00:02:11.310> on<00:02:11.520> gilt<00:02:11.819> groupe

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
the black pair popped up on gilt groupe

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.090 
the black pair popped up on gilt groupe
or<00:02:12.209> somewhere<00:02:12.629> for<00:02:12.900> a<00:02:12.930> ridiculously

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
or somewhere for a ridiculously

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.300 
or somewhere for a ridiculously
price<00:02:14.460> and<00:02:14.910> I<00:02:15.750> knew<00:02:15.900> the<00:02:16.080> value<00:02:16.290> of<00:02:16.800> the<00:02:16.950> pants

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
price and I knew the value of the pants

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.880 
price and I knew the value of the pants
themselves<00:02:18.030> or<00:02:18.270> the<00:02:18.390> leggings<00:02:18.840> I<00:02:19.110> knew<00:02:19.770> they

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
themselves or the leggings I knew they

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.800 
themselves or the leggings I knew they
were<00:02:19.950> really<00:02:20.160> nice<00:02:20.400> and<00:02:20.460> they're<00:02:21.060> a<00:02:21.090> cozy<00:02:21.630> and

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
were really nice and they're a cozy and

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.450 
were really nice and they're a cozy and
they're<00:02:21.930> not<00:02:22.080> too<00:02:22.290> tight<00:02:22.590> so<00:02:22.620> I<00:02:23.220> definitely

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
they're not too tight so I definitely

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.430 
they're not too tight so I definitely
snagged<00:02:24.060> him<00:02:24.210> at<00:02:24.330> the<00:02:24.450> lower<00:02:24.630> price<00:02:24.960> on<00:02:25.170> gilt

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
snagged him at the lower price on gilt

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.920 
snagged him at the lower price on gilt
groupe<00:02:25.650> so<00:02:26.040> I<00:02:26.310> wouldn't<00:02:27.120> recommend<00:02:27.390> always

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
groupe so I wouldn't recommend always

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.690 
groupe so I wouldn't recommend always
getting<00:02:28.470> things<00:02:28.740> in<00:02:28.920> every<00:02:29.190> different<00:02:29.340> color

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
getting things in every different color

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.490 
getting things in every different color
because<00:02:30.270> usually<00:02:30.450> if<00:02:30.750> you<00:02:30.900> see<00:02:31.170> it<00:02:31.260> once

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
because usually if you see it once

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.170 
because usually if you see it once
you're<00:02:31.800> like<00:02:32.040> you<00:02:32.580> don't<00:02:32.760> really<00:02:32.880> want<00:02:33.150> to

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
you're like you don't really want to

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.610 
you're like you don't really want to
wear<00:02:33.330> the<00:02:33.450> other<00:02:33.540> color<00:02:33.870> you<00:02:34.080> usually<00:02:34.230> pick

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
wear the other color you usually pick

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.310 
wear the other color you usually pick
one<00:02:34.800> or<00:02:34.830> the<00:02:35.040> other<00:02:35.100> but<00:02:35.580> in<00:02:35.940> this<00:02:36.840> case<00:02:37.080> I'm

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
one or the other but in this case I'm

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.960 
one or the other but in this case I'm
wearing<00:02:37.620> a<00:02:37.710> both<00:02:37.890> because<00:02:38.340> I<00:02:38.460> own<00:02:38.640> them<00:02:38.790> both

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
wearing a both because I own them both

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.070 
wearing a both because I own them both
so<00:02:39.450> then<00:02:40.320> I<00:02:40.350> went<00:02:40.650> to<00:02:40.800> the<00:02:40.920> shoes<00:02:41.220> um<00:02:42.030> last<00:02:42.840> time

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
so then I went to the shoes um last time

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.810 
so then I went to the shoes um last time
I<00:02:43.260> wore<00:02:43.470> these<00:02:43.620> pants<00:02:43.950> since<00:02:44.310> they<00:02:44.460> were<00:02:44.520> gray

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
I wore these pants since they were gray

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.790 
I wore these pants since they were gray
i<00:02:44.850> paired<00:02:45.270> them<00:02:45.390> with<00:02:45.480> black<00:02:45.870> shoes<00:02:46.230> so<00:02:46.620> this

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
i paired them with black shoes so this

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.460 
i paired them with black shoes so this
time<00:02:47.040> I<00:02:47.100> went<00:02:47.400> with<00:02:47.610> some<00:02:47.790> gray<00:02:48.000> shoes<00:02:48.470> these

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
time I went with some gray shoes these

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.250 
time I went with some gray shoes these
are<00:02:49.680> the<00:02:49.800> christian<00:02:50.220> louboutin<00:02:50.700> lady<00:02:51.660> derby

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
lot of different variations I think they

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.410

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
of flannel material so these are really

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.700 
of flannel material so these are really
cool<00:03:05.700> they<00:03:06.060> just<00:03:06.300> look<00:03:06.540> like<00:03:06.570> an<00:03:06.930> Oxford<00:03:07.500> with

the peep toe and the flannel the only

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.870 
the peep toe and the flannel the only
bad<00:03:10.380> thing<00:03:10.680> about<00:03:10.710> flannel<00:03:11.400> is<00:03:11.520> it<00:03:11.700> can

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
bad thing about flannel is it can
