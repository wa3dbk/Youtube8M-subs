looked at we have twin cars they're
totally<00:02:06.229> different<00:02:06.289> but<00:02:06.710> they<00:02:06.920> have<00:02:07.610> the<00:02:07.789> same

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
totally different but they have the same

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.330 
totally different but they have the same
they're<00:02:08.720> totally<00:02:09.049> different<00:02:09.080> minds<00:02:09.950> are<00:02:10.160> and

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
they're totally different minds are and

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.690 
they're totally different minds are and
her<00:02:10.459> American<00:02:11.060> but<00:02:11.720> they're<00:02:11.870> identical

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
her American but they're identical

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:18.190 
her American but they're identical
because<00:02:14.019> they<00:02:15.019> had<00:02:15.200> the<00:02:15.319> same<00:02:15.530> part<00:02:17.019> my<00:02:18.019> dad

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
because they had the same part my dad

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.070 
because they had the same part my dad
said<00:02:18.500> literally<00:02:18.860> my<00:02:19.310> the<00:02:19.670> inside<00:02:20.030> of<00:02:20.209> person

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
said literally my the inside of person

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.039 
said literally my the inside of person
inside<00:02:21.500> of<00:02:21.560> mine<00:02:21.799> are<00:02:22.540> identical<00:02:23.540> so

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:24.049 
inside of mine are identical so

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:26.800 
inside of mine are identical so
therefore<00:02:25.010> its<00:02:25.370> lucky<00:02:25.580> we<00:02:26.180> have<00:02:26.209> identical

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
therefore its lucky we have identical

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:36.250 
therefore its lucky we have identical
