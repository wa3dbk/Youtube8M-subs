00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 yes very good people I am daniel and today 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.020
 I come with the tips of the game lifting 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.429
 league of legends warning is 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.559
 it requires a lot of skill to play with 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.900
 leasing is good use of your skill 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.150
 burst so you will use the full potential of the 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.800
 leasing this skill will be used in the 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.220
 jungle to receive the least damage 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.619
 possible and quickly do it in addition 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.619
 1 versus 1 battles will give you an advantage 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:28.170
 significant the course of the battle 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.760
 could be changed by a sonic wave 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.399
 a sonic wave allows us the greatest 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.630
 maneuverability with our listing with 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.000
 this skill we can achieve 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.070
 distant objectives do not matter if there is 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.710
 obstacle with the exception of 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.230
 minions jungle monsters or pets 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.230
 of champions what matters is to throw 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.239
 in the right direction this skill 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.010
 it has a quite low cooling down 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.920
 what will allow us to use it several times 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.500
 within a group battle 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:58.100
 wait a second before using the blow 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.600
 resonant because it's very common that when 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.909
 a listing is approaching a 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.909
 enemy champion that moves away this 

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:06.590
 begins to make zigzag movements 

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:11.110
 that's why you should only wait a bit 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.110
 thus, greater accuracy is achieved 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:16.510
 your skills will allow you to travel 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:18.650
 great distances if in our desire 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:20.690
 they reached a very distant goal 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.010
 our skills will not allow it 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.960
 with good use of them 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:27.090
 three of the four skills he possesses 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.680
 the leasing will allow you to escape from 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.630
 any danger 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.270
 one of these escapes is making use of 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.040
 dragon's anger this is to do 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.930
 use of dragon's anger before the 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.580
 enemy use your skills to 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.640
 incapacitate the 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:45.120
 mobility combo safeguard more 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.440
 guard minion ally or champion this is 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.870
 based on using the combination of 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:51.270
 safeguard more an ally guard minion 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:53.280
 or champion in the case of a guard we have 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.350
 to place it and immediately use 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.980
 safeguard to do this is 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.570
 needs a lot of agility in the fingers 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:01.900
 escape of a champion making use of the 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.120
 sonic wave 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:06.100
 As I mentioned, the sonic wave can 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:08.410
 collide against minions monsters of 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.180
 jungle or mascots of champions 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.020
 this should be used to escape from 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:14.210
 any danger 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.790
 it is beneficial to sometimes move away 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:17.829
 to all of me 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.530
 it's beneficial to take it away because 

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:23.409
 we can use our ability q one and 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:26.579
 twice so finish doing the damage 

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:30.430
 we need and do not receive us 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:32.709
 divide the enemy and you will win with a list 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.810
 It's a brilliant idea to make them separate 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:37.329
 to the enemy group because we 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.590
 we can take advantage of this since 

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:39.730
 this champion and his set of 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.060
 skills were created for 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:45.310
 face this reality under the same 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.680
 order of ideas we know that it's more than 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.190
 convenient to apply against jungle 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.410
 from the beginning of the game 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.940
 your well-used dragon's anger could 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.610
 leave the entire team disabled 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.140
 enemy clearly this one would generate a 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.240
 enormous advantage for the start of the 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.940
 group battles and would allow to get 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.260
 much sooner to victory well 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.540
 we know that every minute of play 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.940
 elapsed will make our listing 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.780
 lose all its effectiveness reaching a 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:14.630
 problematic end of game 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.490
 its resonant beat will allow you to ignore 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:17.959
 enemy skills 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:19.610
 we know that the resonant blow is the 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:22.040
 skill that I told the sonic wave 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:24.410
 this will allow us to ignore certain 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:27.890
 enemy moves like a flash a 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:29.750
 jump drive or a combo weapon it 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:32.750
 The only thing that should be considered is that 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:35.090
 we must use the skill just before 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:38.690
 that goes into cooling or according to the 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:42.170
 case when it merits protect the s with your 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:44.630
 safeguard and all your skills if 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:47.209
 read 50 with all your skills 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:49.700
 it seemed almost impossible to overcome all his 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:51.410
 defense and if this is done by taking care of 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:55.160
 champion of the team that has more damage 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:58.040
 It will be worth always insect combo 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:59.959
 for group battles this consists of 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.360
 move quickly behind a champion 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:04.970
 enemy and throw it with the skill will go 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:07.640
 of dragon towards our allies of this 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:10.460
 way to make a focus is insurmountable and 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:13.550
 guide the team towards victory 

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:15.560
 as for June objectives the combo 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:18.140
 what is done in this case would be given 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:21.080
 by a resonant wave more crush more 

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:21.860
 resonant blow in short would be to sink 

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:24.440
 what else 

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:26.900
 efe more q and this assuming we have 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.640
 the crush on the key f 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:31.490
 in this way we would do the greatest damage 

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:34.460
 possible and we would win that precious 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:36.830
 jungle monster as leasing more 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:39.410
 crush though I never succeeded 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:41.480
 this play based on videos from the network and 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:44.180
 in coincidences of life we can 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:46.520
 make use of the crush to remove a 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:48.410
 obstacle of our path we are 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:51.290
 talking about a minion or a monster of 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:53.900
 jungle and so get the kill or the 

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:56.330
 position that we wanted at that moment 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:58.760
 So far the video has arrived if it has 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:00.950
 I like to like it and subscribe for 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:03.320
 that you are attentive to any other of my 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:05.540
 videos that can serve you on screen 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:07.820
 in the links of the tips made 

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:10.550
 before and at the end of the video 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:12.620
 will be the making of which will serve as 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:15.330
 support for the management of this champion 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:18.500
 see you soon people 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:18.500
 and see you
