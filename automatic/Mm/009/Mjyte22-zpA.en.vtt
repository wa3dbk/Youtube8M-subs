living like anyone else he's not an
aggressive<00:02:15.810> or<00:02:16.440> confronting<00:02:16.950> person<00:02:17.340> but<00:02:18.210> a

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
aggressive or confronting person but a

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.970 
aggressive or confronting person but a
lot<00:02:18.450> of<00:02:18.480> terrors<00:02:18.840> actually<00:02:18.990> ignore<00:02:19.440> them<00:02:19.710> or<00:02:19.920> a

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
lot of terrors actually ignore them or a

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.520 
lot of terrors actually ignore them or a
quite<00:02:20.280> disrespectful<00:02:21.090> and<00:02:21.180> rude<00:02:21.240> to<00:02:22.020> him<00:02:22.230> I

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
quite disrespectful and rude to him I

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:23.960 
quite disrespectful and rude to him I
think<00:02:23.040> that's<00:02:23.220> more<00:02:23.430> about<00:02:23.670> our<00:02:23.850> own

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
think that's more about our own

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.180 
think that's more about our own
awkwardness<00:02:24.420> than<00:02:24.870> anything<00:02:25.500> that<00:02:25.710> he<00:02:25.980> does

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
awkwardness than anything that he does

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.610 
awkwardness than anything that he does
or<00:02:26.550> puts<00:02:27.000> on<00:02:27.150> us<00:02:27.300> as<00:02:27.510> such<00:02:27.720> and<00:02:27.990> I<00:02:28.080> think<00:02:28.320> that's

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
or puts on us as such and I think that's

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.530 
or puts on us as such and I think that's
quite<00:02:28.890> unfortunate<00:02:29.190> and<00:02:29.910> quite<00:02:30.300> telling

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
quite unfortunate and quite telling

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.920 
quite unfortunate and quite telling
about<00:02:31.160> Western<00:02:32.160> society<00:02:32.700> and<00:02:32.820> what<00:02:33.240> we<00:02:33.390> put<00:02:33.660> on
