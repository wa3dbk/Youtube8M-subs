00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.400 
actually surprised about the the you
know<00:00:59.129> how<00:00:59.430> slow<00:01:00.239> these<00:01:00.539> players<00:01:00.870> are<00:01:01.020> taken<00:01:01.379> to

know how slow these players are taken to
grow<00:01:01.710> I<00:01:01.739> guess<00:01:02.010> I<00:01:02.039> mean<00:01:02.370> I<00:01:02.460> know<00:01:02.520> we're<00:01:03.270> only<00:01:03.420> a

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
grow I guess I mean I know we're only a

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.270 
grow I guess I mean I know we're only a
few<00:01:03.809> months<00:01:03.960> in<00:01:04.229> by<00:01:04.409> remember<00:01:04.830> in<00:01:04.920> fifa<00:01:05.250> 13

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
few months in by remember in fifa 13

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.880 
few months in by remember in fifa 13
that<00:01:06.150> you<00:01:06.299> know<00:01:06.420> they<00:01:06.570> were<00:01:06.630> growing<00:01:07.020> a<00:01:07.470> little

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
that you know they were growing a little

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.170 
that you know they were growing a little
bit<00:01:08.100> quicker<00:01:08.280> than<00:01:08.549> this<00:01:08.700> but<00:01:08.880> maybe<00:01:09.060> i<00:01:09.150> just

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
bit quicker than this but maybe i just

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.340 
bit quicker than this but maybe i just
got<00:01:09.450> to<00:01:09.479> give<00:01:09.630> them<00:01:09.689> a<00:01:09.780> bit<00:01:09.930> more<00:01:09.960> time<00:01:10.260> maybe

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
got to give them a bit more time maybe

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.500 
got to give them a bit more time maybe
I'm<00:01:10.619> my<00:01:11.280> expectations<00:01:12.030> are<00:01:12.150> a<00:01:12.180> little<00:01:12.210> too<00:01:12.479> I

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
I'm my expectations are a little too I

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.840 
I'm my expectations are a little too I
think<00:01:12.810> it'd<00:01:13.110> be<00:01:13.140> best<00:01:13.470> to<00:01:13.619> reevaluate<00:01:14.189> their

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
think it'd be best to reevaluate their

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.399 
think it'd be best to reevaluate their
sort<00:01:15.119> of<00:01:15.180> growth<00:01:15.450> towards<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.140> end<00:01:16.259> of<00:01:16.320> the

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
sort of growth towards the end of the

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.469 
sort of growth towards the end of the
season<00:01:16.619> or<00:01:16.920> maybe<00:01:17.100> even<00:01:17.220> halfway<00:01:17.610> through<00:01:18.060> but

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
season or maybe even halfway through but

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.679 
season or maybe even halfway through but

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
environment so this could turn out

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.320 
environment so this could turn out
pretty<00:02:26.440> funny<00:02:26.860> and<00:02:27.100> some<00:02:27.670> weird<00:02:27.970> comes

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
pretty funny and some weird comes

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.270 
pretty funny and some weird comes
out<00:02:28.480> of<00:02:28.570> my<00:02:28.630> mouth<00:02:28.660> sometimes<00:02:29.080> when<00:02:29.530> I'm<00:02:29.710> doing

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
out of my mouth sometimes when I'm doing

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.310 
out of my mouth sometimes when I'm doing
things<00:02:30.670> live<00:02:30.910> so<00:02:31.300> it<00:02:31.660> should<00:02:31.900> be<00:02:31.930> good<00:02:32.020> but

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
things live so it should be good but

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:33.840 
things live so it should be good but
yeah<00:02:32.470> that's<00:02:32.650> the<00:02:32.830> reason<00:02:33.100> why<00:02:33.130> today's<00:02:33.610> one

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850

lead and a beautiful literally that is

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.500 
lead and a beautiful literally that is
just<00:03:56.500> an<00:03:56.650> orgasmic<00:03:57.100> ball<00:03:57.670> played<00:03:58.060> through<00:03:58.300> to

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
just an orgasmic ball played through to

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.050 
just an orgasmic ball played through to
Lallana<00:03:59.020> and<00:03:59.380> he<00:03:59.860> finishes<00:04:00.370> that<00:04:00.520> very<00:04:00.760> nicely

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
Lallana and he finishes that very nicely

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.120 
Lallana and he finishes that very nicely
actually<00:04:01.360> it<00:04:01.870> was<00:04:02.080> a<00:04:02.230> a<00:04:02.260> finesse<00:04:02.680> shot<00:04:02.710> on<00:04:03.010> the

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.130 
actually it was a a finesse shot on the

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:04.800 
actually it was a a finesse shot on the
near<00:04:03.370> post<00:04:03.610> of<00:04:03.820> the<00:04:03.910> keeper<00:04:04.270> so<00:04:04.480> I<00:04:04.510> guess

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
near post of the keeper so I guess

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:06.480 
near post of the keeper so I guess
that's<00:04:04.990> a<00:04:05.110> worthy<00:04:05.590> keepers<00:04:06.100> fault<00:04:06.340> than

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:06.490 
that's a worthy keepers fault than

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:09.390 
that's a worthy keepers fault than
anything<00:04:06.850> but<00:04:07.180> it<00:04:07.300> was<00:04:07.450> 22<00:04:07.900> 90th<00:04:08.740> minute<00:04:08.770> three

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
anything but it was 22 90th minute three

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.520 
anything but it was 22 90th minute three
minutes<00:04:09.730> to<00:04:09.820> go<00:04:09.940> could<00:04:10.630> we<00:04:10.840> get<00:04:11.110> the<00:04:11.170> winner

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530 
minutes to go could we get the winner

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:13.500

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 
Southampton's thought process was behind

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:57.420 
Southampton's thought process was behind
that<00:04:56.200> I<00:04:56.470> would<00:04:56.860> have<00:04:56.920> said<00:04:57.100> you<00:04:57.220> know<00:04:57.310> maybe
