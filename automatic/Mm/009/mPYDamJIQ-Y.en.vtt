stay<00:00:48.320> ahead<00:00:48.440> of<00:00:48.590> the<00:00:48.770> curve<00:00:49.010> so<00:00:49.400> my<00:00:50.300> little

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:50.710 
stay ahead of the curve so my little

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.410 
stay ahead of the curve so my little
strategy<00:00:51.710> for<00:00:52.010> maximizing<00:00:52.850> my<00:00:52.970> ammo<00:00:53.360> two

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:53.420 
strategy for maximizing my ammo two

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.570 
strategy for maximizing my ammo two
points<00:00:53.900> is<00:00:54.050> I<00:00:54.290> try<00:00:54.680> and<00:00:54.740> get<00:00:54.920> them<00:00:55.010> to<00:00:55.070> group<00:00:55.370> up

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:55.580 
points is I try and get them to group up

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:58.210 
points is I try and get them to group up
behind<00:00:55.940> me<00:00:56.120> and<00:00:56.360> i<00:00:56.990> will<00:00:57.050> just<00:00:57.470> spray<00:00:57.860> the<00:00:58.040> hell

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:58.220 
behind me and i will just spray the hell

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.280 
behind me and i will just spray the hell
out<00:00:58.370> of<00:00:58.400> them<00:00:58.610> with<00:00:58.790> every<00:00:59.450> magazine<00:00:59.690> i<00:01:00.080> got

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:00.290 
out of them with every magazine i got

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:01.750 
out of them with every magazine i got
when<00:01:00.500> they're<00:01:00.650> in<00:01:00.740> a<00:01:00.800> crowd<00:01:01.100> like<00:01:01.130> that<00:01:01.370> watch

when they're in a crowd like that watch

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.280 
when they're in a crowd like that watch
i'll<00:01:02.030> just<00:01:02.210> turn<00:01:02.360> around<00:01:02.540> and<00:01:02.810> dump<00:01:03.080> the<00:01:03.260> whole

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:03.290 
i'll just turn around and dump the whole

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:05.679 
i'll just turn around and dump the whole
clip<00:01:03.920> in<00:01:04.100> tool<00:01:04.339> look<00:01:05.150> at<00:01:05.239> all<00:01:05.299> those<00:01:05.420> points

00:01:05.679 --> 00:01:05.689 
clip in tool look at all those points

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:07.390 
clip in tool look at all those points
racking<00:01:06.259> up<00:01:06.350> that's<00:01:06.650> the<00:01:06.920> way<00:01:07.070> to<00:01:07.130> maximize

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:07.400 
racking up that's the way to maximize

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.480 
racking up that's the way to maximize
