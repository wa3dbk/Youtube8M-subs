00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:35.580 
and it may not be as difficult as you

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.509 
and it may not be as difficult as you
might<00:00:35.850> imagine<00:00:36.500> he<00:00:37.500> or<00:00:37.559> she<00:00:37.769> explains<00:00:38.220> how<00:00:38.460> to

really fascinating research coming out
looking<00:00:46.080> at<00:00:46.290> using<00:00:47.100> mental<00:00:47.610> strategies<00:00:47.879> to

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
help people relieve both acute pain and

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.020 
help people relieve both acute pain and
chronic<00:00:52.140> pain<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:52.860> this<00:00:53.610> comes<00:00:53.820> from<00:00:53.879> an

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
chronic pain and this comes from an

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.189 
chronic pain and this comes from an
understanding<00:00:54.180> of<00:00:54.720> the<00:00:54.780> different<00:00:55.049> systems

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
understanding of the different systems

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.649 
understanding of the different systems
that<00:00:55.799> are<00:00:55.949> involved<00:00:56.430> in<00:00:56.549> in<00:00:56.879> pain<00:00:57.360> in<00:00:57.570> the

00:00:57.649 --> 00:00:57.659 
that are involved in in pain in the

00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:00.140 
that are involved in in pain in the
brain<00:00:57.930> so<00:00:58.500> obviously<00:00:58.920> areas<00:00:59.820> of<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.030> brain

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:00.150 
brain so obviously areas of the brain

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:01.969 
brain so obviously areas of the brain
that<00:01:00.239> are<00:01:00.510> related<00:01:00.960> to<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.409> body<00:01:01.619> are

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:01.979 
that are related to the body are

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:04.579 
that are related to the body are
involved<00:01:02.519> to<00:01:02.850> sensation<00:01:03.449> but<00:01:04.290> very

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
involved to sensation but very

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:05.899 
involved to sensation but very
interestingly<00:01:04.799> there<00:01:05.309> is<00:01:05.339> an<00:01:05.580> area<00:01:05.790> of<00:01:05.850> the

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
interestingly there is an area of the

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.370 
interestingly there is an area of the
brain<00:01:06.030> called<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.479> anterior<00:01:06.840> cingulate

Stanford and he was able to use
real-time<00:01:31.430> fMRI<00:01:32.430> feedback<00:01:32.910> so<00:01:33.360> you<00:01:33.450> know<00:01:33.510> we

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
real-time fMRI feedback so you know we

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.810 
real-time fMRI feedback so you know we
talk<00:01:33.780> a<00:01:33.810> lot<00:01:34.020> about<00:01:34.050> brain<00:01:34.920> scans<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:35.640> there's

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
talk a lot about brain scans and there's

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.640 
talk a lot about brain scans and there's
actually<00:01:36.090> technology<00:01:36.330> that<00:01:36.690> allows<00:01:36.960> you<00:01:37.230> to

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
actually technology that allows you to

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.170 
actually technology that allows you to
show<00:01:37.860> people<00:01:38.040> what's<00:01:38.400> happening<00:01:38.909> in<00:01:39.030> their

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
people into the lab who had chronic pain

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.399 
people into the lab who had chronic pain
and<00:01:46.400> showed<00:01:47.400> them<00:01:47.670> this<00:01:48.600> region<00:01:49.110> of<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.290> brain

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
and showed them this region of the brain

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.770 
and showed them this region of the brain
that<00:01:49.770> seems<00:01:49.950> to<00:01:50.100> be<00:01:50.190> so<00:01:50.430> important<00:01:51.000> for<00:01:51.600> both

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
that seems to be so important for both

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.719 
that seems to be so important for both
the<00:01:52.110> experience<00:01:52.740> of<00:01:52.860> pain<00:01:53.070> and<00:01:53.310> also<00:01:53.460> the

the experience of pain and also the

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.060 
the experience of pain and also the
regulation<00:01:54.360> of<00:01:54.479> pan<00:01:54.750> so<00:01:55.110> that<00:01:55.260> we<00:01:55.710> can<00:01:55.860> cope

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
regulation of pan so that we can cope

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.950 
regulation of pan so that we can cope
with<00:01:56.100> it<00:01:56.280> better<00:01:56.520> show<00:01:57.390> them<00:01:57.570> this<00:01:57.659> area<00:01:57.900> of

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
with it better show them this area of

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.570 
with it better show them this area of
the<00:01:58.020> brain<00:01:58.200> and<00:01:58.530> show<00:01:58.680> them<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:58.979> activation

00:01:59.570 --> 00:01:59.580 
the brain and show them the activation

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.580 
the brain and show them the activation
and<00:01:59.820> gave<00:02:00.570> them<00:02:00.750> a<00:02:00.810> few<00:02:01.020> different<00:02:01.260> mental

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
and gave them a few different mental

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.770 
and gave them a few different mental
strategies<00:02:01.860> to<00:02:02.520> try<00:02:02.729> to<00:02:02.790> control<00:02:03.240> this<00:02:03.420> region

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
strategies to try to control this region

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.840 
strategies to try to control this region
of<00:02:03.870> the<00:02:03.960> brain<00:02:04.080> and<00:02:04.470> these<00:02:05.100> strategies<00:02:05.280> are

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
of the brain and these strategies are

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.210 
of the brain and these strategies are
actually<00:02:06.240> they're<00:02:06.479> pretty<00:02:06.690> similar<00:02:06.930> to

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
actually they're pretty similar to

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.800 
actually they're pretty similar to
mindfulness<00:02:08.220> strategies<00:02:08.879> and<00:02:09.209> reappraisal

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
mindfulness strategies and reappraisal

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.410 
mindfulness strategies and reappraisal
strategies<00:02:10.289> so<00:02:11.069> one<00:02:11.430> strategy<00:02:11.700> would<00:02:12.180> be<00:02:12.239> to

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
strategies so one strategy would be to

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.860 
strategies so one strategy would be to
practice<00:02:13.140> attentional<00:02:14.010> flexibility<00:02:14.760> so<00:02:15.450> this

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
practice attentional flexibility so this

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.320 
practice attentional flexibility so this
is<00:02:16.020> maybe<00:02:16.200> a<00:02:16.319> pain<00:02:16.730> patient<00:02:17.730> who<00:02:17.880> has<00:02:18.060> chronic

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
is maybe a pain patient who has chronic

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.920 
is maybe a pain patient who has chronic
back<00:02:18.600> pain

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
back pain

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.080 
back pain
they<00:02:19.590> may<00:02:19.920> be<00:02:19.980> asked<00:02:20.459> to<00:02:20.609> really<00:02:20.819> pay

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
they may be asked to really pay

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.420 
they may be asked to really pay
attention<00:02:21.569> to<00:02:22.109> the<00:02:22.379> pain<00:02:22.590> in<00:02:22.620> their<00:02:22.799> back<00:02:22.950> what

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
attention to the pain in their back what

attention to the pain in their back what
does<00:02:23.489> it<00:02:23.609> feel<00:02:23.730> like<00:02:23.790> now<00:02:24.719> can<00:02:24.959> you<00:02:25.049> shift<00:02:25.319> your

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
does it feel like now can you shift your

something<00:02:37.799> that<00:02:37.920> you<00:02:37.980> might<00:02:38.099> practice<00:02:38.489> in<00:02:38.579> a

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:38.639 
something that you might practice in a

something that you might practice in a
mindfulness<00:02:39.120> training<00:02:39.530> they<00:02:40.530> also<00:02:40.680> were

mindfulness training they also were

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.550 
mindfulness training they also were
given<00:02:41.540> cognitive<00:02:42.540> reappraisal<00:02:42.659> strategies

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
given cognitive reappraisal strategies

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.099 
given cognitive reappraisal strategies
like<00:02:43.920> to<00:02:44.310> imagine<00:02:44.760> that<00:02:45.090> the<00:02:45.870> pain<00:02:46.079> that

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:46.109 
like to imagine that the pain that

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:47.990 
like to imagine that the pain that
you're<00:02:46.319> feeling<00:02:46.760> although<00:02:47.760> it<00:02:47.879> may<00:02:47.969> be

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
you're feeling although it may be

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.780 
you're feeling although it may be
intense<00:02:48.510> is<00:02:48.840> actually<00:02:49.500> safe<00:02:49.769> right<00:02:50.459> to<00:02:50.579> try<00:02:50.760> to

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
intense is actually safe right to try to

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.819 
intense is actually safe right to try to
take<00:02:51.060> away<00:02:51.209> the<00:02:51.569> the<00:02:51.840> feeling<00:02:52.169> of<00:02:52.230> danger<00:02:52.439> that

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:52.829 
take away the the feeling of danger that

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:54.860 
take away the the feeling of danger that
we<00:02:52.889> often<00:02:53.250> layer<00:02:53.579> on<00:02:53.879> top<00:02:54.359> of<00:02:54.540> physical

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
we often layer on top of physical

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.890 
we often layer on top of physical
sensation<00:02:55.470> that<00:02:55.950> increases<00:02:56.459> our<00:02:56.579> pan<00:02:56.900> and

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
sensation that increases our pan and

sensation that increases our pan and
sees<00:02:58.079> given<00:02:58.319> strategies<00:02:58.799> like<00:02:59.010> that<00:02:59.310> to

00:02:59.869 --> 00:02:59.879 
sees given strategies like that to

more<00:03:02.489> intense<00:03:03.290> just<00:03:04.290> different<00:03:04.590> ways<00:03:04.769> of

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
more intense just different ways of

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.699 
more intense just different ways of
paying<00:03:05.760> attention<00:03:06.269> but<00:03:06.989> importantly<00:03:07.530> not

wasn't<00:03:09.510> about<00:03:09.780> trying<00:03:10.049> to<00:03:10.230> get<00:03:10.409> away<00:03:10.530> from<00:03:10.680> the

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:10.889 
wasn't about trying to get away from the

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:12.800 
wasn't about trying to get away from the
pain<00:03:11.069> and<00:03:11.370> people<00:03:12.180> were<00:03:12.419> allowed<00:03:12.569> to<00:03:12.599> use

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
pain and people were allowed to use

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.770 
pain and people were allowed to use
whatever<00:03:13.079> strategy<00:03:13.650> works<00:03:13.859> best<00:03:14.129> and

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
whatever strategy works best and

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.780 
whatever strategy works best and
everyone<00:03:15.780> was<00:03:16.079> able<00:03:16.500> to<00:03:16.530> basically<00:03:17.040> control

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
everyone was able to basically control

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.259 
everyone was able to basically control
this<00:03:18.150> region<00:03:18.480> of<00:03:18.599> the<00:03:18.629> brain<00:03:18.780> that<00:03:19.260> so<00:03:20.269> affects

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
this region of the brain that so affects

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:22.909 
this region of the brain that so affects
our<00:03:21.510> experience<00:03:21.900> of<00:03:22.019> pain<00:03:22.230> they<00:03:22.560> were<00:03:22.650> able<00:03:22.769> to

our experience of pain they were able to
learn<00:03:23.220> it<00:03:23.400> in<00:03:23.489> a<00:03:23.579> single<00:03:23.760> session<00:03:24.090> and<00:03:25.340> not

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:27.949 
learn it in a single session and not
only<00:03:26.430> were<00:03:26.669> they<00:03:26.790> able<00:03:26.819> to<00:03:27.120> decrease<00:03:27.780> their

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959
