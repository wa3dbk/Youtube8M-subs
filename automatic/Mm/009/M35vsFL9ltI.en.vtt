across<00:02:06.689> this<00:02:07.079> foreground<00:02:07.560> and<00:02:07.770> I'll<00:02:07.920> take<00:02:08.190> the

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
across this foreground and I'll take the

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.880 
across this foreground and I'll take the
saturation<00:02:09.479> and<00:02:09.660> I'm<00:02:10.110> going<00:02:10.229> to<00:02:10.259> increase<00:02:10.709> the

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
saturation and I'm going to increase the

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.369 
saturation and I'm going to increase the
saturation<00:02:11.069> quite<00:02:11.970> a<00:02:12.000> bit<00:02:12.299> I<00:02:12.480> really<00:02:13.200> want

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:13.379 
saturation quite a bit I really want

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:15.380 
saturation quite a bit I really want
that<00:02:13.500> sand<00:02:14.340> to<00:02:14.519> come<00:02:14.700> up<00:02:14.819> through<00:02:15.060> the<00:02:15.090> water

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
that sand to come up through the water

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.930 
that sand to come up through the water
area<00:02:15.810> if<00:02:15.959> you<00:02:15.989> will<00:02:16.170> and<00:02:16.530> i'll<00:02:17.250> also<00:02:17.430> increase

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
area if you will and i'll also increase

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.130 
area if you will and i'll also increase
the<00:02:18.090> contrast<00:02:18.890> now<00:02:19.890> i<00:02:19.920> notice<00:02:20.310> that<00:02:20.489> the

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
the contrast now i notice that the

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.780 
the contrast now i notice that the
reflection<00:02:22.140> of<00:02:22.260> the<00:02:22.410> child<00:02:22.709> came<00:02:23.099> up<00:02:23.310> quite<00:02:23.730> a

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
reflection of the child came up quite a

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.569 
reflection of the child came up quite a
bit<00:02:24.120> warmer<00:02:24.739> here's<00:02:25.739> the<00:02:25.799> before<00:02:26.040> and<00:02:26.340> after

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:26.579 
bit warmer here's the before and after

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:29.000 
bit warmer here's the before and after
and<00:02:26.790> if<00:02:27.450> i<00:02:27.540> want<00:02:27.720> to<00:02:27.780> protect<00:02:28.140> that<00:02:28.379> and<00:02:28.620> not

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
and if i want to protect that and not

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.039 
and if i want to protect that and not
have<00:02:29.250> it<00:02:29.280> come<00:02:29.579> up<00:02:29.730> i<00:02:29.910> can<00:02:30.329> just<00:02:30.480> simply<00:02:30.780> take<00:02:30.989> a

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:31.049 
have it come up i can just simply take a

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:33.610 
have it come up i can just simply take a
control<00:02:31.590> point<00:02:31.799> again<00:02:32.220> and<00:02:32.430> place<00:02:32.609> it<00:02:32.819> right

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
control point again and place it right

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.849 
control point again and place it right
here<00:02:34.620> and<00:02:34.799> I've<00:02:35.310> just<00:02:35.340> protected<00:02:36.060> the<00:02:36.150> child

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:36.859 
here and I've just protected the child

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:40.430 
here and I've just protected the child
from<00:02:37.859> being<00:02:38.280> affected<00:02:38.970> by<00:02:39.000> this

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
from being affected by this

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.250 
from being affected by this
control<00:02:41.250> point<00:02:41.490> on<00:02:41.640> the<00:02:41.730> left<00:02:41.940> so<00:02:42.780> it's<00:02:42.930> very

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
control point on the left so it's very

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.290 
control point on the left so it's very
simple<00:02:43.770> and<00:02:44.010> very<00:02:44.070> quick<00:02:44.670> and<00:02:44.850> clever<00:02:45.030> way<00:02:45.270> to

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
simple and very quick and clever way to

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.480 
simple and very quick and clever way to
work<00:02:45.540> I<00:02:45.780> can<00:02:46.290> also<00:02:46.440> place<00:02:46.590> a<00:02:46.800> control<00:02:47.220> point<00:02:47.370> on

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:47.490 
work I can also place a control point on

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:49.700 
work I can also place a control point on
the<00:02:47.550> background<00:02:47.760> here<00:02:48.120> on<00:02:48.330> the<00:02:48.420> mountains<00:02:48.750> on

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:49.710 
the background here on the mountains on

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:51.410 
the background here on the mountains on
the<00:02:49.860> edge<00:02:50.010> of<00:02:50.130> the<00:02:50.220> hill<00:02:50.370> the<00:02:50.550> cliff<00:02:50.790> and<00:02:51.000> I<00:02:51.270> can

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
the edge of the hill the cliff and I can

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.950 
the edge of the hill the cliff and I can
drop<00:02:51.660> that<00:02:51.950> brightness<00:02:52.950> down<00:02:53.160> a<00:02:53.220> bit<00:02:53.520> and

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:53.960 
drop that brightness down a bit and

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.120 
drop that brightness down a bit and
increase<00:02:54.960> a<00:02:54.990> little<00:02:55.140> contrast<00:02:55.680> it<00:02:55.890> looks<00:02:56.040> a

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
increase a little contrast it looks a

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.270 
increase a little contrast it looks a
little<00:02:56.370> flat<00:02:56.700> back<00:02:56.910> there<00:02:57.150> and<00:02:58.280> maybe

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
little flat back there and maybe

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.010 
little flat back there and maybe
desaturate<00:03:00.000> that<00:03:00.180> just<00:03:00.360> a<00:03:00.450> little<00:03:00.690> it<00:03:00.780> picked

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.020 
desaturate that just a little it picked

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:03.530 
desaturate that just a little it picked
up<00:03:01.110> a<00:03:01.200> little<00:03:01.260> bit<00:03:01.470> of<00:03:01.530> color<00:03:01.740> back<00:03:01.980> there<00:03:02.160> so

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
up a little bit of color back there so

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.720 
up a little bit of color back there so
so<00:03:04.500> now<00:03:04.680> our<00:03:04.709> before<00:03:05.189> and<00:03:05.219> after<00:03:05.519> it<00:03:05.579> looks

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
so now our before and after it looks

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.420 
so now our before and after it looks
sort<00:03:05.939> of<00:03:05.969> like<00:03:06.030> this<00:03:06.469> and<00:03:07.469> we've<00:03:07.650> really<00:03:08.099> spent

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
sort of like this and we've really spent

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.640 
sort of like this and we've really spent
sent<00:03:09.180> more<00:03:09.510> of<00:03:09.599> the<00:03:09.719> tension<00:03:10.079> in<00:03:10.200> here<00:03:10.469> and

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
sent more of the tension in here and

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.890 
sent more of the tension in here and
then<00:03:11.219> to<00:03:11.459> make<00:03:11.640> that<00:03:11.819> point<00:03:12.480> a<00:03:12.629> little<00:03:12.810> bit

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
then to make that point a little bit

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.660 
then to make that point a little bit
stronger<00:03:13.140> will<00:03:13.439> add<00:03:13.590> one<00:03:13.799> last<00:03:13.950> control<00:03:14.400> point

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
stronger will add one last control point

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.580 
stronger will add one last control point
in<00:03:14.879> the<00:03:15.540> water<00:03:15.780> right<00:03:15.900> in<00:03:16.109> front<00:03:16.409> of<00:03:16.469> this

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
in the water right in front of this

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:17.899 
in the water right in front of this
child<00:03:16.859> and<00:03:17.189> I'm<00:03:17.310> going<00:03:17.459> to<00:03:17.519> take<00:03:17.700> the

00:03:17.899 --> 00:03:17.909 
child and I'm going to take the

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:20.700 
child and I'm going to take the
brightness<00:03:18.390> down<00:03:18.510> quite<00:03:18.870> a<00:03:18.900> bit

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:20.710 
brightness down quite a bit

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:23.310 
brightness down quite a bit
so<00:03:21.340> that<00:03:21.550> the<00:03:21.670> viewers<00:03:22.000> attention<00:03:22.320> cannot

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
so that the viewers attention cannot

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:24.990 
so that the viewers attention cannot
help<00:03:23.530> but<00:03:23.740> go<00:03:23.920> right<00:03:24.130> to<00:03:24.310> that<00:03:24.430> child<00:03:24.700> and

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
help but go right to that child and

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.830 
help but go right to that child and
that's<00:03:25.930> what<00:03:26.140> we<00:03:26.260> are<00:03:26.500> goal<00:03:26.710> is<00:03:26.890> here<00:03:27.160> and

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
that's what we are goal is here and

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.950 
that's what we are goal is here and
again<00:03:28.840> we<00:03:29.020> can<00:03:29.170> take<00:03:29.350> a<00:03:29.380> look<00:03:29.500> at<00:03:29.920> the<00:03:30.960> selected

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:31.960 
again we can take a look at the selected

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:35.310 
again we can take a look at the selected
areas<00:03:32.820> here's<00:03:33.820> the<00:03:34.060> white<00:03:34.480> area<00:03:34.840> that's<00:03:35.050> being

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:35.320 
areas here's the white area that's being

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.440 
areas here's the white area that's being
shown<00:03:35.680> is<00:03:35.890> all<00:03:36.340> the<00:03:36.490> blue<00:03:36.730> tonality<00:03:37.090> in<00:03:37.360> the

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
shown is all the blue tonality in the

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:40.800 
shown is all the blue tonality in the
sky<00:03:37.750> from<00:03:38.350> the<00:03:38.530> first<00:03:38.770> control<00:03:39.160> point<00:03:39.810> here's

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
sky from the first control point here's

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.210 
sky from the first control point here's
the<00:03:41.910> mountains<00:03:42.910> in<00:03:43.030> the<00:03:43.060> background<00:03:43.150> and

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
the mountains in the background and

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.710 
the mountains in the background and
here's<00:03:45.220> this<00:03:45.370> last<00:03:45.670> area<00:03:45.940> right<00:03:46.210> here<00:03:46.240> you<00:03:46.540> can

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
here's this last area right here you can

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.860 
here's this last area right here you can
see<00:03:47.280> where<00:03:48.280> it's<00:03:48.550> just<00:03:48.640> affected<00:03:49.300> this<00:03:49.480> area

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
see where it's just affected this area

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.610 
see where it's just affected this area
right<00:03:50.140> in<00:03:50.170> here<00:03:50.380> in<00:03:50.800> tonality<00:03:52.230> so<00:03:53.230> it's<00:03:53.380> a<00:03:53.470> real

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
right in here in tonality so it's a real

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.200 
right in here in tonality so it's a real
clever<00:03:53.920> way<00:03:54.070> to<00:03:54.100> work<00:03:54.370> there's<00:03:54.610> no<00:03:54.910> jagged

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:55.210 
clever way to work there's no jagged

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:57.990 
clever way to work there's no jagged
edges<00:03:55.570> as<00:03:55.990> you<00:03:56.140> can<00:03:56.290> see<00:03:56.530> it<00:03:57.460> does<00:03:57.640> a<00:03:57.670> brilliant

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
edges as you can see it does a brilliant

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.020 
edges as you can see it does a brilliant
job<00:03:58.240> it's<00:03:58.600> very<00:03:58.960> photographic<00:03:59.650> in<00:03:59.770> nature

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
job it's very photographic in nature

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.020 
job it's very photographic in nature
and<00:04:01.150> here's<00:04:01.720> our<00:04:01.840> before<00:04:02.200> and<00:04:02.230> after<00:04:02.620> and<00:04:03.340> I

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
and here's our before and after and I

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:05.250 
and here's our before and after and I
think<00:04:04.240> it<00:04:04.330> makes<00:04:04.450> the<00:04:04.569> picture<00:04:04.750> look<00:04:04.870> stronger

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
think it makes the picture look stronger

think it makes the picture look stronger
