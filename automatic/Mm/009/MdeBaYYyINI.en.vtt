00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
which is a pretty cool feature the doors

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.789 
which is a pretty cool feature the doors
though<00:02:34.140> are<00:02:35.540> strongly<00:02:36.540> hinged<00:02:37.200> enough<00:02:37.470> so

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:37.799 
though are strongly hinged enough so

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:39.199 
though are strongly hinged enough so
that<00:02:37.829> the<00:02:38.250> missile<00:02:38.579> will<00:02:38.700> not<00:02:38.819> shoot<00:02:39.060> the

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
that the missile will not shoot the

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:41.300 
that the missile will not shoot the
doors<00:02:39.420> open<00:02:39.780> which<00:02:39.930> is<00:02:40.140> kind<00:02:41.099> of<00:02:41.159> too<00:02:41.280> bad

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
doors open which is kind of too bad

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:42.920 
doors open which is kind of too bad
because<00:02:41.670> it<00:02:41.849> would<00:02:41.940> be<00:02:42.060> pretty<00:02:42.569> cool<00:02:42.690> if<00:02:42.900> we

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
because it would be pretty cool if we

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.569 
because it would be pretty cool if we
could<00:02:42.989> do<00:02:43.170> that<00:02:43.519> but<00:02:44.690> there<00:02:45.690> you<00:02:45.780> go<00:02:46.400> then<00:02:47.400> over

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:47.579 
could do that but there you go then over

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:50.300 
could do that but there you go then over
here<00:02:47.870> you<00:02:48.870> have<00:02:48.989> the<00:02:49.079> tumbler<00:02:49.410> this<00:02:50.190> is<00:02:50.280> a

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
here you have the tumbler this is a

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.339 
here you have the tumbler this is a
really<00:02:50.519> cool<00:02:50.700> looking<00:02:50.879> set<00:02:51.180> I<00:02:51.569> kind<00:02:52.140> of<00:02:52.170> like

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:52.349 
really cool looking set I kind of like

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:56.390 
really cool looking set I kind of like
the<00:02:53.450> jagged<00:02:54.450> edges<00:02:54.629> and<00:02:55.140> the<00:02:55.319> Oh<00:02:55.650> doesn't

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
the jagged edges and the Oh doesn't

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.349 
the jagged edges and the Oh doesn't
really<00:02:56.519> look<00:02:56.730> like<00:02:56.940> something<00:02:57.239> you'd

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:57.359 
really look like something you'd

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:00.500 
really look like something you'd
normally<00:02:57.480> see<00:02:58.879> you<00:02:59.879> have<00:02:59.970> these<00:03:00.090> little<00:03:00.329> flick

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
normally see you have these little flick

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.319 
normally see you have these little flick
fire<00:03:00.690> missiles<00:03:01.079> on<00:03:01.200> the<00:03:01.230> side<00:03:02.000> I'm<00:03:03.000> just<00:03:03.120> kind

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:03.329 
fire missiles on the side I'm just kind

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:05.319 
fire missiles on the side I'm just kind
of<00:03:03.359> cooking<00:03:03.599> it<00:03:03.870> there<00:03:04.079> again<00:03:04.410> on<00:03:04.650> both<00:03:04.829> sides

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:05.329 
of cooking it there again on both sides

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:09.530 
of cooking it there again on both sides
it's<00:03:06.329> a<00:03:06.359> great-looking<00:03:06.629> set<00:03:08.209> we<00:03:09.209> should<00:03:09.390> have

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
it's a great-looking set we should have

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.080 
it's a great-looking set we should have
a<00:03:09.569> little<00:03:09.959> more<00:03:10.200> functionality<00:03:10.950> but<00:03:11.730> it<00:03:11.940> is

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
a little more functionality but it is

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.309 
a little more functionality but it is
still<00:03:12.299> really<00:03:12.510> cool<00:03:12.660> looks<00:03:12.900> really<00:03:13.079> good<00:03:13.200> from

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 
still really cool looks really good from

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:15.890 
still really cool looks really good from
the<00:03:13.470> back<00:03:13.650> too<00:03:13.890> with<00:03:14.069> the<00:03:14.190> huge<00:03:14.489> tires<00:03:14.900> it

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
the back too with the huge tires it

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.170 
the back too with the huge tires it
doesn't<00:03:16.200> have<00:03:16.319> suspension<00:03:16.919> in<00:03:17.040> it<00:03:17.160> but<00:03:17.430> it's

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
doesn't have suspension in it but it's

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.530 
doesn't have suspension in it but it's
because<00:03:18.569> the<00:03:18.930> tires<00:03:19.169> are<00:03:19.319> so<00:03:19.380> big<00:03:19.880> it's<00:03:20.880> it's

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
because the tires are so big it's it's

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.500 
because the tires are so big it's it's
pretty<00:03:21.810> solid

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
pretty solid

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.930 
pretty solid
so<00:03:24.709> that<00:03:25.709> has<00:03:25.950> these<00:03:26.040> little<00:03:26.160> flaps<00:03:26.489> that<00:03:26.730> pop

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
so that has these little flaps that pop

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.900 
so that has these little flaps that pop
up<00:03:27.200> and<00:03:28.200> I<00:03:28.950> kind<00:03:29.160> of<00:03:29.190> wish<00:03:29.310> they<00:03:29.459> had<00:03:29.579> a<00:03:29.609> couple

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
up and I kind of wish they had a couple

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.059 
up and I kind of wish they had a couple
more<00:03:30.060> these<00:03:30.470> just<00:03:31.470> to<00:03:31.530> make<00:03:31.680> it<00:03:31.769> look<00:03:31.919> a<00:03:31.950> little

00:03:32.059 --> 00:03:32.069 
more these just to make it look a little

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:35.330 
more these just to make it look a little
more<00:03:32.959> like<00:03:33.959> the<00:03:34.109> movie<00:03:34.410> version<00:03:34.590> but<00:03:35.069> that's

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
more like the movie version but that's

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.670 
more like the movie version but that's
still<00:03:35.549> pretty<00:03:35.609> cool<00:03:35.970> on<00:03:36.720> the<00:03:37.200> inside<00:03:37.790> you<00:03:38.790> have

right<00:05:03.200> there<00:05:06.070> see<00:05:07.070> it's<00:05:07.160> all<00:05:07.280> whites<00:05:07.550> but<00:05:07.820> if

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:07.940 
right there see it's all whites but if

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:13.030 
right there see it's all whites but if
you<00:05:08.030> take<00:05:08.210> off<00:05:09.010> his<00:05:10.010> cowl<00:05:11.710> he<00:05:12.710> still<00:05:12.919> has<00:05:13.010> a

you take off his cowl he still has a
face<00:05:13.310> and<00:05:13.370> then<00:05:13.669> he<00:05:13.730> has<00:05:13.880> white<00:05:14.150> mark<00:05:14.450> on<00:05:14.780> his

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:21.730 
face and then he has white mark on his
head<00:05:17.229> so<00:05:18.229> it's<00:05:19.190> pretty<00:05:19.340> cool<00:05:19.610> idea<00:05:20.500> so<00:05:21.500> you<00:05:21.530> get

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:21.740 
head so it's pretty cool idea so you get

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:24.370 
head so it's pretty cool idea so you get
both<00:05:21.889> faces<00:05:22.340> in<00:05:22.460> one<00:05:22.669> not<00:05:23.600> having<00:05:23.810> to<00:05:24.020> turn<00:05:24.200> it

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:24.380

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:29.020 
both faces in one not having to turn it
around<00:05:24.470> so<00:05:26.169> there<00:05:27.169> is<00:05:27.350> that<00:05:27.669> this<00:05:28.669> is<00:05:28.790> a<00:05:28.820> really

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:29.030 
around so there is that this is a really

around so there is that this is a really
good<00:05:29.120> set<00:05:29.390> I<00:05:29.419> would<00:05:29.630> definitely<00:05:30.260> recommend<00:05:30.350> it
