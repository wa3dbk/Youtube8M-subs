hey<00:00:08.790> guys<00:00:09.030> this<00:00:09.330> is<00:00:09.389> thorne<00:00:09.780> welcome<00:00:10.200> back<00:00:10.440> and

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
hey guys this is thorne welcome back and

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.620 
hey guys this is thorne welcome back and
this<00:00:11.130> episode<00:00:11.550> we<00:00:11.700> are<00:00:11.730> going<00:00:12.000> to<00:00:12.090> look<00:00:12.210> at<00:00:12.420> the

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
this episode we are going to look at the

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.330 
this episode we are going to look at the
effective<00:00:13.170> command<00:00:13.500> so<00:00:13.740> let's<00:00:14.009> look<00:00:14.130> at<00:00:14.280> the

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
effective command so let's look at the

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.090 
effective command so let's look at the
syntax<00:00:14.549> for<00:00:15.030> the<00:00:15.240> effective<00:00:15.630> man<00:00:15.890> just<00:00:16.890> type

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
syntax for the effective man just type

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.790 
syntax for the effective man just type
in<00:00:17.279> effect<00:00:17.640> and<00:00:18.119> we<00:00:18.869> can<00:00:19.020> see<00:00:19.199> we've<00:00:19.439> got<00:00:19.470> the

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
in effect and we can see we've got the

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.000 
in effect and we can see we've got the
imports<00:00:20.250> here<00:00:20.520> of<00:00:20.789> player<00:00:21.449> effect<00:00:22.380> and<00:00:22.740> then

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
imports here of player effect and then

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.910 
imports here of player effect and then
optional<00:00:23.550> imports<00:00:23.970> of<00:00:24.180> seconds<00:00:24.920> amplifier

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
optional imports of seconds amplifier

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.849 
optional imports of seconds amplifier
and<00:00:26.279> hide<00:00:26.640> particles<00:00:27.269> so<00:00:27.990> high<00:00:28.109> particles<00:00:28.680> is

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
and hide particles so high particles is

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.420 
and hide particles so high particles is
something<00:00:29.220> new<00:00:29.490> as<00:00:29.849> of<00:00:30.060> Minecraft<00:00:31.019> 1.8<00:00:31.590> where

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
something new as of Minecraft 1.8 where

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.459 
something new as of Minecraft 1.8 where
we<00:00:32.910> can<00:00:33.059> now<00:00:33.210> hide<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:33.690> particles<00:00:34.110> acquired

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
we can now hide the particles acquired

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.910 
we can now hide the particles acquired
to<00:00:34.860> apply<00:00:35.399> or<00:00:35.670> mob<00:00:35.910> or<00:00:36.510> an<00:00:36.660> entity<00:00:36.960> when<00:00:37.770> we

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
to apply or mob or an entity when we

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.610 
to apply or mob or an entity when we
give<00:00:38.160> them<00:00:38.399> an<00:00:39.059> effect<00:00:39.450> so<00:00:39.899> an<00:00:40.170> effect<00:00:40.500> is

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
give them an effect so an effect is

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.069 
give them an effect so an effect is
basically<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.190> same<00:00:41.399> as<00:00:41.640> giving<00:00:42.390> something<00:00:42.840> a

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
basically the same as giving something a

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.290 
basically the same as giving something a
potions<00:00:43.530> I<00:00:43.680> think<00:00:43.890> of<00:00:43.980> it<00:00:44.100> as<00:00:44.219> throwing<00:00:45.000> a

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
potions I think of it as throwing a

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.510 
potions I think of it as throwing a
splash<00:00:46.110> potions<00:00:46.590> all<00:00:46.739> around<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.070> place<00:00:47.280> and

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
splash potions all around the place and

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.130 
splash potions all around the place and
applying<00:00:47.940> it<00:00:48.090> to<00:00:48.149> whatever<00:00:48.660> you<00:00:48.870> want<00:00:48.989> to

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
applying it to whatever you want to

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.380 
applying it to whatever you want to
apply<00:00:49.469> so<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.219> effect<00:00:50.550> amount<00:00:50.879> could<00:00:51.030> be<00:00:51.090> very

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
apply so the effect amount could be very

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.209 
apply so the effect amount could be very
specific<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.110> you<00:00:52.170> can<00:00:52.379> target<00:00:52.559> individual

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
specific and you can target individual

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.299 
specific and you can target individual
players<00:00:53.520> a<00:00:53.760> group<00:00:54.210> of<00:00:54.329> mobs<00:00:54.600> etc<00:00:54.980> so<00:00:55.980> let's

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
players a group of mobs etc so let's

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.180 
players a group of mobs etc so let's
look<00:00:57.270> at<00:00:57.390> an<00:00:57.480> example<00:00:57.750> here<00:00:58.079> so<00:00:58.170> let's<00:00:58.890> bring

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
look at an example here so let's bring

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.580 
look at an example here so let's bring
in<00:00:59.340> a<00:00:59.430> couple<00:00:59.670> more<00:00:59.789> chickens<00:01:00.149> and<00:01:00.840> now<00:01:01.320> let's

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
in a couple more chickens and now let's

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.009 
in a couple more chickens and now let's
give<00:01:01.770> these<00:01:01.890> chickens<00:01:02.340> a<00:01:02.609> speed<00:01:03.149> boost<00:01:03.390> so

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
give these chickens a speed boost so

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.770 
give these chickens a speed boost so
let's<00:01:04.379> type<00:01:04.589> in<00:01:04.830> effect

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
let's type in effect

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.560 
let's type in effect
we'll<00:01:06.780> use<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:07.140> @<00:01:07.290> symbol<00:01:07.530> for<00:01:08.570> selecting

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
we'll use the @ symbol for selecting

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.359 
we'll use the @ symbol for selecting
entities<00:01:10.020> and<00:01:10.439> we're<00:01:10.560> going<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:10.860> narrow<00:01:11.070> down

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
entities and we're going to narrow down

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.310 
entities and we're going to narrow down
a<00:01:11.729> selection<00:01:12.420> to<00:01:12.780> be<00:01:12.810> of<00:01:13.140> type<00:01:13.500> chicken<00:01:13.920> and

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
a selection to be of type chicken and

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.210 
a selection to be of type chicken and
let's<00:01:16.320> say<00:01:16.650> we<00:01:17.610> give<00:01:17.820> them<00:01:18.180> speed<00:01:18.960> one<00:01:19.409> so<00:01:19.830> the

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
let's say we give them speed one so the

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.600 
let's say we give them speed one so the
effect<00:01:20.640> for<00:01:20.850> speed<00:01:21.119> is<00:01:21.509> ID<00:01:21.780> one<00:01:22.400> duration<00:01:23.400> is

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
effect for speed is ID one duration is

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.810 
effect for speed is ID one duration is
give<00:01:23.850> it<00:01:23.970> for<00:01:24.210> 15<00:01:24.630> seconds<00:01:25.490> amplifier<00:01:26.490> let's

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
give it for 15 seconds amplifier let's

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.819 
give it for 15 seconds amplifier let's
just<00:01:27.180> say<00:01:27.360> zero<00:01:27.720> so<00:01:27.810> that's<00:01:27.990> regular<00:01:28.500> speed

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
just say zero so that's regular speed

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.850 
just say zero so that's regular speed
and<00:01:29.189> hide<00:01:30.000> particles<00:01:30.570> let's<00:01:30.869> save<00:01:31.140> also<00:01:31.799> I

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
and hide particles let's save also I

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.950 
and hide particles let's save also I
want<00:01:32.100> to<00:01:32.189> see<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.430> particles<00:01:32.909> so<00:01:33.150> that

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
want to see the particles so that

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.960 
want to see the particles so that
command<00:01:34.290> is<00:01:34.439> R<00:01:34.470> and<00:01:34.710> now<00:01:35.009> for<00:01:35.400> every<00:01:35.700> chicken

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
command is R and now for every chicken

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.640 
command is R and now for every chicken
that's<00:01:36.210> on<00:01:36.360> this<00:01:36.479> island<00:01:36.750> and<00:01:37.079> it's<00:01:37.409> given

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
that's on this island and it's given

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.100 
that's on this island and it's given
them<00:01:37.740> all<00:01:37.920> regular<00:01:38.490> speed<00:01:38.840> so<00:01:39.840> it<00:01:39.930> all<00:01:40.079> just

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
them all regular speed so it all just

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.080 
them all regular speed so it all just
got<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.740> base<00:01:40.920> speed<00:01:41.250> effect<00:01:41.610> applied<00:01:41.939> to

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
got the base speed effect applied to

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.749 
got the base speed effect applied to
them<00:01:42.710> but<00:01:43.710> we<00:01:43.860> can<00:01:44.070> go<00:01:44.250> a<00:01:44.280> little<00:01:44.460> bit<00:01:44.670> more

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
them but we can go a little bit more

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.249 
them but we can go a little bit more
creative<00:01:45.149> than<00:01:45.270> that<00:01:45.420> let's<00:01:45.840> give<00:01:46.079> them<00:01:46.320> speed

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:48.259 
creative than that let's give them speed

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:51.800 
creative than that let's give them speed
so<00:01:49.259> amplify<00:01:50.250> of<00:01:50.490> one<00:01:50.729> is<00:01:50.880> speed<00:01:51.149> too<00:01:51.390> so<00:01:51.630> let's

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
so amplify of one is speed too so let's

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.260 
so amplify of one is speed too so let's
give<00:01:51.990> them<00:01:52.110> speed<00:01:52.500> three<00:01:52.950> let's<00:01:53.729> change<00:01:53.970> that

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
give them speed three let's change that

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.410 
give them speed three let's change that
to<00:01:54.570> two<00:01:55.040> let's<00:01:56.040> how<00:01:56.219> fast<00:01:56.549> these<00:01:56.729> guys<00:01:57.000> are<00:01:57.210> now

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
to two let's how fast these guys are now

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.910 
to two let's how fast these guys are now
oh<00:01:58.670> yeah<00:01:59.670> they're<00:01:59.850> a<00:01:59.880> little<00:02:00.000> bit<00:02:00.180> faster<00:02:00.719> I

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
oh yeah they're a little bit faster I

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.350 
oh yeah they're a little bit faster I
think<00:02:01.920> there<00:02:02.040> is<00:02:02.130> a<00:02:02.159> cap<00:02:02.430> limit<00:02:02.729> of<00:02:02.880> how<00:02:03.119> hard

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
think there is a cap limit of how hard

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.480 
think there is a cap limit of how hard
the<00:02:03.509> amplifier<00:02:03.930> you<00:02:03.960> can<00:02:04.290> go<00:02:04.469> but<00:02:04.829> let's<00:02:05.280> try

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
the amplifier you can go but let's try

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.080 
the amplifier you can go but let's try

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
to go for a flyer you gonna do nothing

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.140 
to go for a flyer you gonna do nothing
whoa<00:02:19.080> okay<00:02:20.130> you<00:02:21.130> guys<00:02:21.250> are<00:02:21.400> a<00:02:21.580> hazard<00:02:21.910> to<00:02:21.940> your

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
whoa okay you guys are a hazard to your

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.990 
whoa okay you guys are a hazard to your
own<00:02:22.270> health<00:02:22.510> I<00:02:22.690> think<00:02:23.250> okay<00:02:24.250> so<00:02:24.310> as<00:02:24.790> you<00:02:24.850> can

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
own health I think okay so as you can

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.720 
own health I think okay so as you can
see<00:02:25.120> you<00:02:25.330> can<00:02:25.450> apply<00:02:25.750> the<00:02:25.810> effect<00:02:26.290> to<00:02:26.410> mobs<00:02:27.220> now

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
see you can apply the effect to mobs now

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.250 
see you can apply the effect to mobs now
what<00:02:27.940> I<00:02:27.970> could<00:02:28.180> do<00:02:28.360> is<00:02:28.630> apply<00:02:29.520> effects<00:02:30.520> to

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
what I could do is apply effects to

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.710 
what I could do is apply effects to
other<00:02:32.260> types<00:02:32.590> so<00:02:32.830> maybe<00:02:33.040> I<00:02:33.130> say<00:02:33.720> everything

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
other types so maybe I say everything

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.780 
other types so maybe I say everything
other<00:02:35.110> than<00:02:35.470> a<00:02:35.500> chicken<00:02:35.800> which<00:02:36.340> will<00:02:36.550> include

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
other than a chicken which will include

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.260 
other than a chicken which will include
myself<00:02:37.150> and<00:02:37.750> I'm<00:02:37.870> just<00:02:38.050> gonna<00:02:38.260> give<00:02:39.270> let's

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 
myself and I'm just gonna give let's

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:43.620 
myself and I'm just gonna give let's
just<00:02:40.480> regular<00:02:41.080> speed<00:02:41.819> so<00:02:42.819> now<00:02:43.000> I've<00:02:43.239> got<00:02:43.510> this

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
just regular speed so now I've got this

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:45.960 
just regular speed so now I've got this
speed<00:02:43.870> effect<00:02:44.230> pigs<00:02:45.010> have<00:02:45.250> the<00:02:45.370> speed<00:02:45.610> effect

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
speed effect pigs have the speed effect

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.449 
speed effect pigs have the speed effect
but<00:02:46.720> the<00:02:46.840> chickens<00:02:47.230> will<00:02:47.440> not<00:02:47.650> have<00:02:47.920> speed

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
but the chickens will not have speed

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:49.770 
but the chickens will not have speed
effect<00:02:48.730> you<00:02:48.880> can<00:02:49.030> see<00:02:49.180> they<00:02:49.300> don't<00:02:49.450> have<00:02:49.660> the

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
effect you can see they don't have the

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.540 
effect you can see they don't have the
particles<00:02:50.230> anymore<00:02:50.560> so<00:02:50.830> the<00:02:51.040> effect<00:02:51.310> they<00:02:51.400> had

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
particles anymore so the effect they had

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:53.100 
particles anymore so the effect they had
applied<00:02:51.790> to<00:02:51.850> them<00:02:52.090> previously<00:02:52.300> has<00:02:52.750> worn<00:02:53.019> off

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
applied to them previously has worn off

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.759 
applied to them previously has worn off
and<00:02:53.709> they<00:02:54.310> no<00:02:54.459> longer<00:02:54.489> have<00:02:54.910> speed<00:02:55.239> so<00:02:55.769> the

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:56.769 
and they no longer have speed so the

00:02:56.769 --> 00:02:59.640 
and they no longer have speed so the
selection<00:02:57.459> of<00:02:57.780> the<00:02:58.780> target<00:02:59.140> can<00:02:59.319> be<00:02:59.440> very

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
selection of the target can be very

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.500 
selection of the target can be very
specific<00:03:00.220> so<00:03:00.430> let's<00:03:00.640> now<00:03:00.850> just<00:03:01.120> narrow<00:03:01.360> down

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
specific so let's now just narrow down

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.540 
specific so let's now just narrow down
to<00:03:01.810> players<00:03:02.140> and<00:03:02.560> the<00:03:02.800> nearest<00:03:03.069> player<00:03:03.310> which

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:03.550 
to players and the nearest player which

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.990 
to players and the nearest player which
is<00:03:03.580> myself<00:03:03.910> I'm<00:03:04.750> in<00:03:04.900> single<00:03:05.230> player<00:03:05.350> here<00:03:05.769> and

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
is myself I'm in single player here and

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.800 
is myself I'm in single player here and
let's<00:03:07.000> give<00:03:07.209> myself

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
let's give myself

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:12.330 
let's give myself
I<00:03:07.930> think<00:03:08.410> hunger<00:03:08.950> is<00:03:09.780> effect<00:03:10.780> ID<00:03:11.019> 10<00:03:11.620> let's<00:03:12.100> try

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
I think hunger is effect ID 10 let's try

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.300 
I think hunger is effect ID 10 let's try
that<00:03:12.550> and<00:03:13.260> let's<00:03:14.260> hide<00:03:14.560> the<00:03:14.709> particles<00:03:15.190> so

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
that and let's hide the particles so

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.420 
that and let's hide the particles so
let's<00:03:15.549> say<00:03:15.730> it<00:03:15.850> true<00:03:16.500> let's<00:03:17.500> check<00:03:17.769> here<00:03:17.980> so<00:03:18.340> oh

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
let's say it true let's check here so oh

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.180 
let's say it true let's check here so oh
it's<00:03:18.850> regeneration<00:03:19.470> so<00:03:20.470> the<00:03:20.620> effect<00:03:20.890> ID

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
it's regeneration so the effect ID

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.490 
it's regeneration so the effect ID
tenens<00:03:21.670> regeneration<00:03:22.420> I<00:03:22.690> will<00:03:22.870> leave<00:03:23.079> a<00:03:23.110> link

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
tenens regeneration I will leave a link

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.590 
tenens regeneration I will leave a link
in<00:03:23.650> the<00:03:23.739> video<00:03:23.829> description<00:03:24.070> where<00:03:24.670> all<00:03:25.299> the

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
in the video description where all the

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.449 
in the video description where all the
effect<00:03:25.930> ID<00:03:26.140> is<00:03:26.320> I<00:03:26.470> listed<00:03:26.769> out<00:03:26.920> so<00:03:27.190> you<00:03:27.280> can

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
effect ID is I listed out so you can

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:30.270 
effect ID is I listed out so you can
look<00:03:27.970> at<00:03:28.090> those<00:03:28.269> and<00:03:28.329> read<00:03:28.660> up<00:03:28.780> on<00:03:28.900> those<00:03:29.280> it's

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
look at those and read up on those it's

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:31.680 
look at those and read up on those it's
pretty<00:03:30.489> hard<00:03:30.700> to<00:03:30.790> remember<00:03:31.209> and<00:03:31.390> they<00:03:31.570> are

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
pretty hard to remember and they are

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.870 
pretty hard to remember and they are
just<00:03:31.959> a<00:03:32.049> number<00:03:32.200> so<00:03:32.680> it's<00:03:32.860> not<00:03:33.010> a<00:03:33.070> name<00:03:33.610> or<00:03:33.850> a

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
just a number so it's not a name or a

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.330 
just a number so it's not a name or a
descriptor<00:03:34.390> it's<00:03:34.600> just<00:03:35.170> an<00:03:35.290> ID<00:03:35.470> to<00:03:35.890> represent

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
descriptor it's just an ID to represent

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.319 
descriptor it's just an ID to represent
the<00:03:36.459> effect<00:03:36.730> so<00:03:37.600> I<00:03:37.630> do<00:03:37.870> know<00:03:38.320> though<00:03:38.590> that

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 
the effect so I do know though that

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:42.720 
the effect so I do know though that
effect<00:03:40.329> 15<00:03:40.870> is<00:03:41.170> blindness<00:03:41.769> so<00:03:42.250> let's<00:03:42.489> give

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
effect 15 is blindness so let's give

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:47.460 
effect 15 is blindness so let's give
myself<00:03:42.970> blindness<00:03:45.930> yeah<00:03:46.930> it's<00:03:47.079> pretty<00:03:47.230> cool

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
myself blindness yeah it's pretty cool

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:49.349 
myself blindness yeah it's pretty cool
and<00:03:47.680> I'm<00:03:47.920> glad<00:03:47.950> you<00:03:48.790> probably<00:03:49.090> can't<00:03:49.299> make

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:49.359 
and I'm glad you probably can't make

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:50.520 
and I'm glad you probably can't make
this<00:03:49.600> in<00:03:49.750> game<00:03:49.900> it's<00:03:50.049> probably<00:03:50.410> pretty

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
this in game it's probably pretty

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.410 
this in game it's probably pretty
useless<00:03:50.859> in<00:03:51.160> single-player<00:03:51.670> might<00:03:51.970> be<00:03:52.090> useful

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
useless in single-player might be useful

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.960 
useless in single-player might be useful
on<00:03:52.480> multiplayer<00:03:52.840> on<00:03:53.410> venture<00:03:54.370> maps<00:03:54.790> or

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
on multiplayer on venture maps or

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.360 
on multiplayer on venture maps or
something<00:03:55.269> like<00:03:55.390> that<00:03:55.769> but<00:03:56.769> yeah<00:03:56.950> you<00:03:57.010> can<00:03:57.190> see

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
something like that but yeah you can see

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.819 
something like that but yeah you can see
tour<00:03:57.609> just<00:03:57.850> made<00:03:58.000> no<00:03:58.150> difference<00:03:58.359> and<00:03:58.829> it's

00:03:59.819 --> 00:03:59.829 
tour just made no difference and it's

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:02.090 
tour just made no difference and it's
just<00:04:00.040> one-off<00:04:00.280> and<00:04:00.640> I<00:04:00.910> can<00:04:01.090> see<00:04:01.269> again<00:04:01.510> yay

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
just one-off and I can see again yay

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:05.729 
just one-off and I can see again yay
okay<00:04:03.100> so<00:04:03.269> that's<00:04:04.269> pretty<00:04:04.540> interesting<00:04:04.709> now<00:04:05.709> I

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:05.739 
okay so that's pretty interesting now I

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:08.550 
okay so that's pretty interesting now I
did<00:04:06.160> want<00:04:06.430> to<00:04:06.489> experiment<00:04:07.030> with<00:04:07.359> an<00:04:07.810> ocelot<00:04:08.290> as

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
did want to experiment with an ocelot as

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.670 
did want to experiment with an ocelot as
ocelots<00:04:09.100> by<00:04:09.370> default<00:04:09.780> very<00:04:10.780> fast<00:04:11.140> these<00:04:11.380> cats

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 
ocelots by default very fast these cats

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.160 
ocelots by default very fast these cats
so<00:04:12.640> I<00:04:12.670> wanted<00:04:12.910> to<00:04:12.970> see<00:04:13.150> how<00:04:13.420> fast<00:04:13.720> these<00:04:13.930> guys

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.170 
so I wanted to see how fast these guys

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:17.099 
so I wanted to see how fast these guys
go<00:04:14.530> when<00:04:15.459> you<00:04:15.579> give<00:04:15.700> them<00:04:15.820> a<00:04:15.940> speed<00:04:16.269> boost<00:04:16.510> so

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:17.109 
go when you give them a speed boost so

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:19.979 
go when you give them a speed boost so
I've<00:04:17.229> spawned<00:04:17.470> a<00:04:17.620> whole<00:04:17.739> bunch<00:04:18.010> here<00:04:18.989> some

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
I've spawned a whole bunch here some

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:21.719 
I've spawned a whole bunch here some
babies<00:04:20.289> in<00:04:20.440> there<00:04:20.590> some<00:04:20.799> adults<00:04:21.099> well<00:04:21.340> that's

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:21.729 
babies in there some adults well that's

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:23.580 
babies in there some adults well that's
a<00:04:21.880> lot<00:04:22.000> of<00:04:22.060> cats<00:04:22.330> a<00:04:22.570> bit<00:04:22.750> of<00:04:22.840> an<00:04:22.930> invasion<00:04:23.169> going

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
a lot of cats a bit of an invasion going

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:25.440 
a lot of cats a bit of an invasion going
on<00:04:23.710> here<00:04:23.979> so<00:04:24.640> let's<00:04:24.849> give<00:04:25.060> these

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.450 
on here so let's give these

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:28.950 
on here so let's give these
guys<00:04:25.600> a<00:04:26.080> speed<00:04:26.560> boost<00:04:26.800> so<00:04:27.280> let's<00:04:27.580> say<00:04:27.960> entities

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
guys a speed boost so let's say entities

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.190 
guys a speed boost so let's say entities
and<00:04:29.770> I'm<00:04:30.070> going<00:04:30.340> to<00:04:30.460> say<00:04:30.670> type<00:04:31.030> is<00:04:31.420> equal<00:04:31.810> to<00:04:31.990> I

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:32.200 
and I'm going to say type is equal to I

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.580 
and I'm going to say type is equal to I
so<00:04:32.380> what<00:04:33.720> Ocelot<00:04:34.750> I<00:04:34.930> think<00:04:35.290> this<00:04:35.410> how<00:04:35.530> you

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:35.590 
so what Ocelot I think this how you

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:41.990 
so what Ocelot I think this how you
spell<00:04:35.830> it<00:04:35.860> and<00:04:36.930> let's<00:04:37.930> give<00:04:38.410> them<00:04:39.540> speed<00:04:40.710> is

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
spell it and let's give them speed is

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.640 
spell it and let's give them speed is
how<00:04:43.000> long<00:04:43.210> let's<00:04:43.450> give<00:04:43.690> it<00:04:43.720> for<00:04:44.020> ten<00:04:44.260> seconds

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650 
how long let's give it for ten seconds

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:52.160 
how long let's give it for ten seconds
and<00:04:45.360> let's<00:04:46.360> just<00:04:46.540> give<00:04:46.720> them<00:04:46.960> speed<00:04:48.300> -<00:04:50.790> okay

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:52.170 
and let's just give them speed - okay

00:04:52.170 --> 00:05:00.600 
and let's just give them speed - okay
does<00:04:53.170> that<00:04:53.200> do<00:04:53.530> anything<00:04:58.320> I'd<00:04:59.320> -<00:04:59.530> no<00:04:59.680> I<00:05:00.010> don't

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:00.610 
does that do anything I'd - no I don't

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:02.100 
does that do anything I'd - no I don't
think<00:05:00.790> I<00:05:01.000> spelt<00:05:01.300> their<00:05:01.420> name<00:05:01.600> right<00:05:01.810> how<00:05:02.050> do

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.110 
think I spelt their name right how do

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:06.030 
think I spelt their name right how do
you<00:05:02.200> spell<00:05:02.470> their<00:05:02.620> name<00:05:02.800> I'll<00:05:03.400> say<00:05:04.270> a<00:05:04.300> lot<00:05:05.040> but

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:06.040 
you spell their name I'll say a lot but

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:07.890 
you spell their name I'll say a lot but
I<00:05:06.100> think<00:05:06.310> you<00:05:06.460> write<00:05:06.730> it<00:05:06.820> in<00:05:06.940> command<00:05:07.510> I<00:05:07.690> think

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:07.900 
I think you write it in command I think

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.070 
I think you write it in command I think
it's<00:05:08.020> Zed

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 
it's Zed

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:19.440 
it's Zed
let's<00:05:11.080> try<00:05:11.320> that<00:05:16.620> they<00:05:17.620> faster<00:05:18.040> now<00:05:18.270> it's<00:05:19.270> hard

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:19.450 
let's try that they faster now it's hard

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:23.630 
let's try that they faster now it's hard
to<00:05:19.510> tell

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:23.640 

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:32.719 

try<00:05:24.640> again

00:05:32.719 --> 00:05:32.729 

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:36.510 

mmm<00:05:34.229> hard<00:05:35.229> to<00:05:35.349> tell<00:05:35.590> so<00:05:35.860> let's<00:05:36.069> crank<00:05:36.310> up<00:05:36.460> the

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:36.520 
mmm hard to tell so let's crank up the

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:41.040 
mmm hard to tell so let's crank up the
speed<00:05:36.699> let's<00:05:37.150> go<00:05:37.360> to<00:05:37.419> amplify<00:05:38.020> of<00:05:38.379> 10<00:05:40.050> now

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.050 
speed let's go to amplify of 10 now

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:46.710 
speed let's go to amplify of 10 now
crazy<00:05:41.379> you<00:05:41.620> guys<00:05:41.740> now<00:05:45.000> yeah<00:05:46.000> I<00:05:46.030> think<00:05:46.479> they<00:05:46.569> are

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:46.720 
crazy you guys now yeah I think they are

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.059 
crazy you guys now yeah I think they are
running<00:05:46.930> a<00:05:46.990> bit<00:05:47.110> faster<00:05:47.500> let's<00:05:47.680> spawn<00:05:47.889> a<00:05:47.949> whole

00:05:48.059 --> 00:05:48.069 
running a bit faster let's spawn a whole

00:05:48.069 --> 00:05:52.350 
running a bit faster let's spawn a whole
bunch<00:05:48.250> more<00:05:49.620> as<00:05:50.849> you<00:05:51.849> can<00:05:52.000> tell<00:05:52.180> you<00:05:52.270> could

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:52.360 
bunch more as you can tell you could

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:53.730 
bunch more as you can tell you could
have<00:05:52.509> fun<00:05:52.750> with<00:05:52.780> this<00:05:53.020> for<00:05:53.289> hours<00:05:53.560> I<00:05:53.680> think

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:53.740 
have fun with this for hours I think

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:55.200 
have fun with this for hours I think
just<00:05:54.099> mucking<00:05:54.430> around<00:05:54.520> with<00:05:54.699> the<00:05:54.879> different

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:55.210 
just mucking around with the different

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:57.210 
just mucking around with the different
models<00:05:55.569> and<00:05:55.720> the<00:05:55.810> different<00:05:56.199> potion<00:05:56.889> effects

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:57.220 
models and the different potion effects

00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:59.369 
models and the different potion effects
and<00:05:57.490> just<00:05:57.520> giving<00:05:57.909> them<00:05:58.060> all<00:05:58.180> different<00:05:58.569> belly

00:05:59.369 --> 00:05:59.379 
and just giving them all different belly

00:05:59.379 --> 00:06:03.390 
and just giving them all different belly
is<00:05:59.590> wow<00:06:00.460> that's<00:06:00.879> a<00:06:00.969> lot<00:06:01.120> of<00:06:01.680> random<00:06:02.680> cats<00:06:02.889> okay

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:03.400 
is wow that's a lot of random cats okay

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:06.119 
is wow that's a lot of random cats okay
it's<00:06:03.879> definitely<00:06:04.030> working<00:06:04.750> so<00:06:05.379> the<00:06:05.710> the<00:06:05.919> name

00:06:06.119 --> 00:06:06.129 
it's definitely working so the the name

00:06:06.129 --> 00:06:08.700 
it's definitely working so the the name
for<00:06:06.430> these<00:06:06.550> guys<00:06:06.819> in<00:06:07.240> game<00:06:07.509> is<00:06:08.169> with<00:06:08.409> a<00:06:08.469> Z

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:08.710 
for these guys in game is with a Z

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:11.070 
for these guys in game is with a Z
rather<00:06:08.919> than<00:06:09.190> a<00:06:09.250> C<00:06:09.509> even<00:06:10.509> though<00:06:10.690> you<00:06:10.810> can<00:06:10.930> see

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:11.080 
rather than a C even though you can see

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:13.950 
rather than a C even though you can see
the<00:06:11.169> description<00:06:11.440> is<00:06:12.069> C<00:06:12.669> so<00:06:13.449> that's<00:06:13.659> just<00:06:13.780> the

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:13.960 
the description is C so that's just the

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:15.540 
the description is C so that's just the
way<00:06:14.080> the<00:06:14.259> name<00:06:14.469> of<00:06:14.650> the<00:06:14.800> mob<00:06:14.979> is<00:06:15.129> defined

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:15.550 
way the name of the mob is defined

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:17.790 
way the name of the mob is defined
within<00:06:15.819> the<00:06:15.940> game<00:06:16.180> so<00:06:17.020> there<00:06:17.409> you<00:06:17.469> go<00:06:17.590> that's

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:17.800 
within the game so there you go that's

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.439 
within the game so there you go that's
pretty<00:06:18.159> much<00:06:18.370> the<00:06:18.699> way<00:06:18.819> that<00:06:18.849> you<00:06:19.090> can<00:06:19.180> apply

00:06:19.439 --> 00:06:19.449 
pretty much the way that you can apply

00:06:19.449 --> 00:06:22.649 
pretty much the way that you can apply
effects<00:06:20.050> to<00:06:20.169> mobs<00:06:20.620> and<00:06:20.860> players<00:06:21.129> and<00:06:21.550> she<00:06:22.389> can

00:06:22.649 --> 00:06:22.659 
effects to mobs and players and she can

00:06:22.659 --> 00:06:24.209 
effects to mobs and players and she can
clear<00:06:22.990> an<00:06:23.110> effect<00:06:23.469> so<00:06:23.680> let's<00:06:23.860> give<00:06:24.039> myself

00:06:24.209 --> 00:06:24.219 
clear an effect so let's give myself

00:06:24.219 --> 00:06:28.010 
clear an effect so let's give myself
blindness<00:06:24.849> again<00:06:25.800> so<00:06:26.800> this<00:06:26.979> is<00:06:27.190> giving<00:06:27.639> myself

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:28.020 
blindness again so this is giving myself

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:31.140 
blindness again so this is giving myself
blindness<00:06:29.020> for<00:06:29.169> 15<00:06:29.560> seconds<00:06:30.099> what<00:06:30.729> you<00:06:30.849> can<00:06:31.000> do

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:31.150 
blindness for 15 seconds what you can do

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:32.850 
blindness for 15 seconds what you can do
is<00:06:31.300> you<00:06:31.449> can<00:06:31.599> just<00:06:31.630> change<00:06:32.020> the<00:06:32.229> duration<00:06:32.529> by

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:32.860 
is you can just change the duration by
