now<00:03:07.900> what<00:03:08.140> I<00:03:08.170> recommend<00:03:08.739> that<00:03:08.829> there's<00:03:09.010> your

00:03:09.119 --> 00:03:09.129 
now what I recommend that there's your

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:11.400 
now what I recommend that there's your
ballistic<00:03:09.549> scope<00:03:09.760> definitely<00:03:10.690> there<00:03:11.110> is<00:03:11.140> no

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
ballistic scope definitely there is no

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:12.900 
ballistic scope definitely there is no
such<00:03:11.650> thing<00:03:11.829> as<00:03:11.920> one<00:03:12.160> scope<00:03:12.430> better<00:03:12.610> than<00:03:12.819> the

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
such thing as one scope better than the

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.059 
such thing as one scope better than the
other<00:03:13.090> whatever<00:03:13.750> appeals<00:03:14.140> to<00:03:14.349> you<00:03:14.470> and<00:03:14.680> makes

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:15.069 
other whatever appeals to you and makes

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:16.500 
other whatever appeals to you and makes
you<00:03:15.190> perform<00:03:15.549> better<00:03:15.579> is<00:03:15.879> the<00:03:16.060> best<00:03:16.269> thing<00:03:16.480> for

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
you perform better is the best thing for

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:17.039 
you perform better is the best thing for
you

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:17.049 
you

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:18.809 
you
I<00:03:17.079> like<00:03:17.500> the<00:03:17.590> desert<00:03:17.859> ballistics<00:03:18.250> so<00:03:18.430> much<00:03:18.609> it

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:18.819 
I like the desert ballistics so much it

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:20.009 
I like the desert ballistics so much it
doesn't<00:03:19.120> mean<00:03:19.209> that<00:03:19.239> it's<00:03:19.510> better<00:03:19.690> than<00:03:19.780> the

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:20.019 
doesn't mean that it's better than the

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:22.440 
doesn't mean that it's better than the
pen<00:03:20.200> Thera<00:03:20.470> ranges<00:03:20.980> or<00:03:21.370> the<00:03:21.519> Vulcan<00:03:21.880> that<00:03:22.030> I<00:03:22.060> if

pen Thera ranges or the Vulcan that I if

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:23.759 
pen Thera ranges or the Vulcan that I if
you're<00:03:22.780> willing<00:03:22.989> to<00:03:23.049> throw<00:03:23.260> a<00:03:23.319> bit<00:03:23.500> of<00:03:23.590> cash

you're willing to throw a bit of cash

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:25.920 
you're willing to throw a bit of cash
around<00:03:23.980> the<00:03:24.459> scope<00:03:24.700> is<00:03:24.880> a<00:03:24.940> good<00:03:25.239> one<00:03:25.389> if<00:03:25.569> you're

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
around the scope is a good one if you're

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.050 
around the scope is a good one if you're
uncertain<00:03:26.230> about<00:03:26.470> it<00:03:26.799> rent<00:03:27.220> the<00:03:27.340> m95<00:03:27.730> for<00:03:28.030> a

same reticle and same zoom if you like
that<00:03:33.280> you<00:03:33.519> can<00:03:33.700> buy<00:03:33.790> the<00:03:33.849> desert<00:03:34.239> ballistic

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
that you can buy the desert ballistic

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.420 
that you can buy the desert ballistic
you<00:03:34.959> get<00:03:35.139> the<00:03:35.260> same<00:03:35.530> thing<00:03:35.799> with<00:03:36.010> the<00:03:36.069> addition

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
you get the same thing with the addition

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:37.830 
you get the same thing with the addition
of<00:03:36.459> an<00:03:36.730> additional<00:03:37.150> nine<00:03:37.299> point<00:03:37.510> four<00:03:37.690> three

skin<00:03:40.810> do<00:03:41.109> I<00:03:41.139> think<00:03:41.260> the<00:03:41.470> desert<00:03:41.620> ballistic<00:03:42.069> is

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
skin do I think the desert ballistic is

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:43.949 
skin do I think the desert ballistic is
useful<00:03:42.549> or<00:03:42.669> useless<00:03:42.700> it<00:03:43.359> depends<00:03:43.780> on<00:03:43.840> the

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
useful or useless it depends on the

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:45.449 
useful or useless it depends on the
weapons<00:03:44.290> of<00:03:44.650> course<00:03:44.919> you<00:03:45.010> don't<00:03:45.190> want<00:03:45.220> to<00:03:45.370> be

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
weapons of course you don't want to be

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:47.610

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
using it on the VSS vintorez because of

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.050 
using it on the VSS vintorez because of
its<00:03:47.739> effect<00:03:48.040> at<00:03:48.160> range<00:03:48.370> there's<00:03:48.669> no<00:03:48.790> point

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
its effect at range there's no point

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:50.280 
its effect at range there's no point
it's<00:03:49.510> better<00:03:49.720> to<00:03:49.870> use<00:03:49.900> the<00:03:50.139> lower

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
it's better to use the lower

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.229 
it's better to use the lower
magnification<00:03:50.650> sight<00:03:51.220> if<00:03:51.489> you're<00:03:51.880> going<00:03:52.030> to
