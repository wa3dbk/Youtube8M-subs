00:05:19.939 --> 00:05:21.879 
her in a sit back there um the reason I
actually<00:05:20.119> put<00:05:20.449> her<00:05:20.569> bite<00:05:20.779> by<00:05:21.229> a<00:05:21.259> dog<00:05:21.619> is

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:21.889 
actually put her bite by a dog is

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:25.089 
actually put her bite by a dog is
because<00:05:22.449> she's<00:05:23.449> easier<00:05:23.899> than<00:05:24.110> her<00:05:24.169> brother<00:05:24.319> so

00:05:25.089 --> 00:05:25.099 
because she's easier than her brother so

00:05:25.099 --> 00:05:27.729 
because she's easier than her brother so
her<00:05:25.819> brother<00:05:26.149> is<00:05:26.479> is<00:05:26.689> way<00:05:27.019> more<00:05:27.199> intense<00:05:27.469> about

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:27.739 
her brother is is way more intense about

00:05:27.739 --> 00:05:31.299 
her brother is is way more intense about
it<00:05:27.919> so<00:05:28.039> he's<00:05:28.189> not<00:05:28.309> ready<00:05:28.550> for<00:05:28.759> that<00:05:29.139> but<00:05:30.139> she<00:05:30.439> is

00:05:31.299 --> 00:05:31.309 
it so he's not ready for that but she is

00:05:31.309 --> 00:05:34.119 
it so he's not ready for that but she is
ready<00:05:31.610> she's<00:05:32.539> not<00:05:32.779> freaked<00:05:33.589> out<00:05:33.709> by<00:05:33.889> the<00:05:33.949> dog

00:05:34.119 --> 00:05:34.129 
ready she's not freaked out by the dog

00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:36.159 
ready she's not freaked out by the dog
she's<00:05:34.369> excited<00:05:34.969> she<00:05:35.149> wants<00:05:35.539> to<00:05:35.659> go<00:05:35.779> get<00:05:35.989> them

00:05:36.159 --> 00:05:36.169 
she's excited she wants to go get them

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:38.739 
she's excited she wants to go get them
go<00:05:36.439> play<00:05:36.649> with<00:05:36.679> him<00:05:36.949> so<00:05:37.639> we're<00:05:38.449> dealing<00:05:38.569> with

00:05:38.739 --> 00:05:38.749 
go play with him so we're dealing with

00:05:38.749 --> 00:05:40.359 
go play with him so we're dealing with
an<00:05:38.929> easier<00:05:39.349> thing<00:05:39.409> for<00:05:39.739> her<00:05:39.860> so<00:05:40.009> that's<00:05:40.159> why<00:05:40.339> I
