00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
here's the case itself it's actually

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
thick but it's durable i guess i should

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.289 
thick but it's durable i guess i should
say<00:01:48.869> it's<00:01:49.049> it's<00:01:49.320> very<00:01:49.530> thin<00:01:49.860> and<00:01:50.130> very<00:01:50.299> durable

white<00:02:21.930> iphones<00:02:22.380> I<00:02:22.560> think<00:02:22.770> are<00:02:22.890> a<00:02:22.920> little<00:02:23.069> bit

white iphones I think are a little bit

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.280 
white iphones I think are a little bit
thicker<00:02:23.459> I'm<00:02:23.730> sure<00:02:24.000> we've<00:02:24.150> all<00:02:24.270> kind<00:02:25.020> of<00:02:25.170> heard

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
thicker I'm sure we've all kind of heard

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:26.870 
thicker I'm sure we've all kind of heard
the<00:02:25.560> what<00:02:25.980> they've<00:02:26.130> said<00:02:26.250> about<00:02:26.310> these<00:02:26.640> being

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
the what they've said about these being

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.699 
the what they've said about these being
thicker<00:02:27.120> and<00:02:27.300> I<00:02:27.360> do<00:02:27.600> believe<00:02:27.780> it<00:02:27.989> to<00:02:28.050> be<00:02:28.080> true<00:02:28.170> I

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
thicker and I do believe it to be true I

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.740 
thicker and I do believe it to be true I
think<00:02:29.610> if<00:02:29.700> this<00:02:29.819> was<00:02:29.970> a<00:02:30.030> black<00:02:30.239> iphone<00:02:30.480> it

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
think if this was a black iphone it

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.270 
think if this was a black iphone it
would<00:02:30.840> snap<00:02:31.170> right<00:02:31.380> in<00:02:31.560> on<00:02:31.709> this<00:02:31.800> one<00:02:31.980> I<00:02:32.010> have

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
would snap right in on this one I have

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.530 
would snap right in on this one I have
to<00:02:32.370> work<00:02:32.520> a<00:02:32.640> little<00:02:32.760> bit<00:02:32.880> but<00:02:33.060> it's<00:02:33.209> not<00:02:33.330> a<00:02:33.360> big

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
to work a little bit but it's not a big

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.510 
to work a little bit but it's not a big
deal<00:02:33.569> it<00:02:34.140> does<00:02:34.319> go<00:02:34.530> right<00:02:34.709> and<00:02:34.860> eventually<00:02:35.340> and

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
deal it does go right and eventually and

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.430 
deal it does go right and eventually and
get<00:02:36.180> all<00:02:36.270> production<00:02:36.780> now<00:02:36.900> this<00:02:37.110> is<00:02:37.260> actually

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
get all production now this is actually

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.040 
get all production now this is actually
a<00:02:37.680> this<00:02:38.489> case<00:02:38.700> is<00:02:38.850> actually<00:02:39.150> a<00:02:39.180> on<00:02:39.630> the<00:02:39.780> table

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
a this case is actually a on the table

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:41.990 
a this case is actually a on the table

really<00:03:14.370> getting<00:03:14.549> scratches<00:03:14.910> glass<00:03:15.269> is<00:03:15.510> pretty

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
really getting scratches glass is pretty

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.750 
really getting scratches glass is pretty
durable<00:03:15.930> it's<00:03:16.260> just<00:03:16.470> it's<00:03:17.070> still<00:03:17.310> glass<00:03:17.549> they

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
durable it's just it's still glass they

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:18.949 
durable it's just it's still glass they
can<00:03:17.910> be<00:03:18.000> careful<00:03:18.299> but<00:03:18.450> I<00:03:18.480> think<00:03:18.750> in<00:03:18.810> this<00:03:18.900> case

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
can be careful but I think in this case

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.050 
can be careful but I think in this case

drop<00:03:21.329> like<00:03:21.540> that<00:03:21.780> on<00:03:22.079> the<00:03:22.140> corners<00:03:22.560> and<00:03:23.220> it

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
drop like that on the corners and it

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.039 
drop like that on the corners and it
doesn't<00:03:23.910> cover<00:03:24.030> the<00:03:24.180> top<00:03:24.329> and<00:03:24.510> bottoms<00:03:24.810> here

doesn't cover the top and bottoms here

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:26.990 
doesn't cover the top and bottoms here

here<00:03:31.980> does<00:03:32.220> actually<00:03:32.430> sit<00:03:33.239> just<00:03:33.480> a<00:03:33.600> little<00:03:33.810> bit

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
here does actually sit just a little bit

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.390 
here does actually sit just a little bit
higher<00:03:34.079> than<00:03:34.110> the<00:03:34.410> edge<00:03:34.500> of<00:03:34.590> the<00:03:34.680> case<00:03:34.859> but<00:03:35.100> it

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
higher than the edge of the case but it

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.030 
higher than the edge of the case but it
depresses<00:03:36.239> you<00:03:36.450> know<00:03:36.989> it<00:03:37.320> pushes<00:03:37.650> down<00:03:37.769> so<00:03:37.980> i

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
depresses you know it pushes down so i

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.440 
depresses you know it pushes down so i
think<00:03:38.130> it<00:03:38.519> would<00:03:38.640> go<00:03:38.820> down<00:03:38.850> in<00:03:39.120> that<00:03:39.239> case<00:03:39.390> you

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
think it would go down in that case you

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:40.819 
think it would go down in that case you
wouldn't<00:03:39.660> see<00:03:39.840> any<00:03:39.959> damage<00:03:40.260> that<00:03:40.290> may<00:03:40.620> be<00:03:40.680> it

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:40.829 
wouldn't see any damage that may be it

may be Isis kept on the top I'm not too
