00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.719
 a greeting to all friends 

00:00:07.709 --> 00:00:13.660
 androidworld.it focus on multitasking 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:16.180
 multi windows how you want to call it di 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.949
 pro 12.2 notes because they were made 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.769
 still steps forward then 

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:22.960
 quickly things the functions that 

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:25.720
 they were already present in the past 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:29.829
 well for example the possibility of 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:36.730
 bring bring the videos into one 

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:41.140
 window excused this form of key 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:43.269
 wrong then already this is some 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.699
 kind of multitasking this video remains 

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:48.699
 here we can interact with the rest 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:51.730
 of the system below without any 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:53.530
 slow down you see the system is fluid 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:59.469
 exactly the same way 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:01:01.359
 in addition we have this function that is 

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:03.940
 call pen functions according to me the name 

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:06.450
 less apt than history 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.619
 allows you to open small ups 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.829
 inside a window then for 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:13.900
 example now for ton a file manager 

00:01:10.829 --> 00:01:16.750
 what I design is what then 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.520
 it will be the space where the will open up 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.890
 window because in this case it was more 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.360
 great than what I designed 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.570
 because that specific application 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:28.860
 he needed more space 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.860
 I can for example video files 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:40.510
 I can go on world that I will have 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:44.190
 need a little bit of me that space 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:48.490
 sa ok 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:51.340
 here is our world and we can 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.990
 interact with all these windows 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.610
 if I press this second key the 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.040
 full screen andrea window 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.750
 if instead I press the first the application 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.210
 will become an icon 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:05.619
 and these are these and I can bring them 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:07.270
 I appreciate that now the metopes here and there 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:09.550
 I show the real muti windows in 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.440
 weight the samp a is prey to the right towards 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.019
 left I can also do it with my finger 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.769
 so there is no need necessarily 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:16.540
 of the aspen 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:18.390
 these are the applications if I press here 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:22.360
 we have additional options where 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:24.790
 we can choose what to pull in 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:27.670
 out of the list we see here 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:31.650
 list here is a bit more restrained either 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:35.380
 for example to these I want to add 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:38.410
 I do n't know for some absurd reason 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:41.650
 samsung ex here it is here then we can also 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:43.180
 create couplings that though 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.160
 coupled is not the right word now 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.489
 you will understand why for example now to pro 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.489
 music 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:03:07.220
 ok and i also open samsung app on note io 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:11.310
 I can do this thing 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:15.000
 let's say upload because ops can 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:16.890
 send it full screen and I can 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.830
 send it too full screen ho 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:22.020
 made a mistake but we do so here it is 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:24.600
 here because you see that if I press badly a 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:26.370
 brain window if you drag me instead 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:29.040
 create the multi windows you are 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.910
 used for example on the known on the axis 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.920
 iv 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.520
 but it's not over we can go 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.630
 forward 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:37.290
 so we can for example also open 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:41.010
 s not 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:42.060
 here it is we are 3 and I can open too 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.040
 android world 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.020
 here it is and we are at 4 then we have 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.970
 four applications open 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:50.400
 at the same time some will render a 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.020
 a bit worse obviously samsun is 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.520
 difficult to navigate 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:57.120
 here too the front space to that 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:59.310
 which is however the applications work e 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.980
 if I hold this record down here I can 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.450
 resize the four applications e 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.090
 give more space to one rather than one 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:08.070
 there is no other fluidity than maybe 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.260
 someone could imagine but in the 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:11.250
 meaning it costs nothing to wait and half 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.020
 second 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.610
 so we have four applications that 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:19.470
 they are going simultaneously i do 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:21.630
 share the music for example and I can 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.820
 but also to reopen these applications 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:26.160
 that I kept here so it was filter 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.470
 environment keep an incredible number of 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:34.950
 software open at the same time 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:37.760
 here it is and then the will open 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:37.760
 small keyboard 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:55.350
 here I am writing a text a text 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:57.690
 world are open while it is under other 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:05:02.690
 ops but it's not over on earth I'd say that 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:05.040
 I make converted with another 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:06.630
 very large number of applications that 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:08.700
 if I had n't thrown away suffering whole 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:11.130
 would have been simple, I would say okay 

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:13.950
 that I close it here among other things 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:15.810
 these videos are then animated on 

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:19.440
 the voices office you can imagine 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:21.180
 really very high a use of the 

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:24.330
 musil windows left to the user 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:26.640
 choice remains totally with the user who 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:30.450
 can split the screen use on 

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:33.060
 12 chickens in the way you prefer for 

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:35.700
 this focus on multi windows and the 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:39.950
 not pro multitasking is all about greeting 

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:39.950
 from but it is not cisotti for androidworld.it
