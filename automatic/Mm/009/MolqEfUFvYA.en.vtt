in<00:02:32.600> my<00:02:32.720> opinion<00:02:33.040> just<00:02:34.040> because<00:02:34.250> everything<00:02:34.639> is

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
in my opinion just because everything is

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.819 
in my opinion just because everything is
just<00:02:34.880> like<00:02:34.970> real<00:02:35.480> time<00:02:35.780> and<00:02:36.139> like<00:02:36.260> right<00:02:36.560> there

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:36.829 
just like real time and like right there

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:38.890 
just like real time and like right there

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
within within the game so it doesn't

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.220 
within within the game so it doesn't
really<00:02:38.959> like<00:02:39.200> take<00:02:39.470> you<00:02:39.650> out<00:02:39.829> of<00:02:40.160> the<00:02:40.639> action

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
gravity I believe they played without a

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.910 
gravity I believe they played without a
little<00:03:54.000> bit<00:03:54.150> in<00:03:54.270> the<00:03:54.390> first<00:03:54.720> one<00:03:54.959> I<00:03:55.230> can't

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920

take me on crowds like this so you saw

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.140 
take me on crowds like this so you saw
that<00:05:28.230> little<00:05:28.410> stasis<00:05:29.010> thing<00:05:29.220> before<00:05:29.639> he<00:05:29.910> has

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:30.150 
that little stasis thing before he has

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:32.240 
that little stasis thing before he has
his<00:05:30.330> ability<00:05:30.810> where<00:05:30.960> he<00:05:31.050> kind<00:05:31.350> of<00:05:31.380> like<00:05:31.530> freeze

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:32.250 
his ability where he kind of like freeze

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:35.540 
his ability where he kind of like freeze
time<00:05:33.150> for<00:05:33.570> a<00:05:33.630> second<00:05:34.020> I<00:05:34.680> guess<00:05:35.040> that's<00:05:35.220> some

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:35.550 
time for a second I guess that's some

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:37.610 
time for a second I guess that's some
special<00:05:36.060> mining<00:05:36.419> technique<00:05:36.840> of<00:05:36.990> the<00:05:37.050> future<00:05:37.410> I

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:37.620 
special mining technique of the future I

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:40.550 
special mining technique of the future I
don't<00:05:37.860> really<00:05:37.980> know<00:05:38.930> but<00:05:39.930> besides<00:05:40.260> kind<00:05:40.470> of

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:40.560 
don't really know but besides kind of

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.590 
don't really know but besides kind of
pausing<00:05:40.980> things<00:05:41.220> he<00:05:41.430> also<00:05:41.610> has<00:05:41.910> this<00:05:42.120> new<00:05:42.389> kind

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:42.600 
pausing things he also has this new kind

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.930 
pausing things he also has this new kind
of<00:05:42.750> like<00:05:42.900> gravity<00:05:43.470> gun<00:05:43.830> thing<00:05:44.280> kinda<00:05:44.910> like

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:44.940 
of like gravity gun thing kinda like

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:49.250 
of like gravity gun thing kinda like
suction<00:05:45.360> items<00:05:46.550> and<00:05:47.550> then<00:05:47.610> repel<00:05:48.120> them<00:05:48.300> so<00:05:49.169> it

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:49.260 
suction items and then repel them so it

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:50.960 
suction items and then repel them so it
looks<00:05:49.290> like<00:05:49.470> they're<00:05:49.740> kind<00:05:49.889> of<00:05:50.100> mixing<00:05:50.820> and

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:50.970 
looks like they're kind of mixing and

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:52.400 
looks like they're kind of mixing and
matching<00:05:51.090> his<00:05:51.419> abilities<00:05:51.900> a<00:05:51.930> little<00:05:52.169> bit<00:05:52.260> more

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:52.410 
matching his abilities a little bit more

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:55.659 
matching his abilities a little bit more
to<00:05:52.470> to<00:05:53.250> add<00:05:53.400> to<00:05:53.730> the<00:05:53.910> puzzle<00:05:54.690> solving<00:05:55.290> and

00:05:55.659 --> 00:05:55.669 
to to add to the puzzle solving and

00:05:55.669 --> 00:05:58.250 
to to add to the puzzle solving and
platforming<00:05:56.669> and<00:05:56.790> that<00:05:56.910> kind<00:05:57.120> of<00:05:57.150> thing<00:05:57.260> so

00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:58.260 
platforming and that kind of thing so

00:05:58.260 --> 00:05:59.690 
platforming and that kind of thing so
the<00:05:58.350> game<00:05:58.500> looks<00:05:58.740> looks<00:05:58.979> pretty<00:05:59.220> promising<00:05:59.370> it
