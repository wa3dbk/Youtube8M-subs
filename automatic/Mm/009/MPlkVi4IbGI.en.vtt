 of the poles, however, to the thirty-second 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.000
 when Scotland granted another

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.610
 condition 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:23.850

 cesarini area a second time 

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:27.150
 exciting 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:30.060
 I tried the new one within 22 meters 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:33.210
