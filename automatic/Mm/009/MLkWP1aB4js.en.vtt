and and and hinges on all limbs except
the<00:02:26.460> right<00:02:26.700> limb<00:02:27.000> so<00:02:27.360> I'm<00:02:27.480> pretty<00:02:27.780> glad<00:02:27.990> it's

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
the right limb so I'm pretty glad it's

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:30.170 
the right limb so I'm pretty glad it's
kind<00:02:28.890> of<00:02:28.950> worried<00:02:29.190> the<00:02:29.370> this<00:02:29.760> figure<00:02:29.910> would

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
kind of worried the this figure would

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.820 
kind of worried the this figure would
would<00:02:30.420> have<00:02:30.510> the<00:02:30.660> same<00:02:30.840> faith<00:02:31.110> but<00:02:31.320> it<00:02:31.440> then<00:02:31.650> it
