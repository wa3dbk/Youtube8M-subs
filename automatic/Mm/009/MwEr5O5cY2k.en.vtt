00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 hello everyone today i'm going to decide 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.839
 one of the most global problems 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.030
 minecraft remember when we start 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.460
 craft any workbench usually 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.799
 how are we going to let them be scrapped 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.660
 something accidentally put extra stuff 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.170
 let's just such a way did 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.140
 pickaxe 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.570
 clicked mgu and and forgot what we lay 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.449
 6011 and so iron it turns out that they 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.910
 fall near the workbench and they can even 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.380
 chasms some sense however i 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.869
 came up with a mechanism that allows 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.149
 do so that they find themselves in it 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.860
 the chest and in no case did not fall 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:38.040
 in general how should I this mechanism 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.809
 just once I scored gold myself 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.480
 apple and I forgot that I have golden blocks 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:45.480
 lay here near this workbench from 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.640
 time gone yes there are blocks of gold 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.180
 that's pretty much so i decided 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.039
 rid of you this problem and decided 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.570
 you show this mechanism well let's 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.800
 now I will show you how it is built like this 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.239
 let's go to the construction 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.920
 in order to start building it on 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.449
 need to forge an area of ​​3 by 3 if you 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.430
 want that the bark began on this here 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.290
 level so let's get on there black 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.720
 put a comparator here then 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.720
 redstone here 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.790
 comparator and in subtraction mode three more 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.439
 a piece of Rostov-on and Redstone gave a way 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.939
 here we have to put the ejector and 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.869
 frames will look up and have 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.520
 connect hobby 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:21.060
 but it must be connected 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.070
 to the comparator next we have everything here 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.950
 close like we're used to it all 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.939
 do further we need to write feathers 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:33.030
 the forest further into the cart with a funnel 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:35.180
 remove this rail take the piston 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.520
 put it here 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.860
 Then put the workbench and opposite 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.650
 piston and damage should push it in 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.660
 the place where our trolley with a funnel 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.090
 Now in this way further then we 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:50.510
 pick up the piston also remove and here 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:52.850
 put the chest all on this mechanism is ready 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:55.670
 endure the temple here will throw out 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.470
 fall into the chest but she is my tutorial 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.760
 ends thank you very much for

 I get interesting every week 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.280
 tutorial on Redstone until all
