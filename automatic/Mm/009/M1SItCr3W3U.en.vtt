00:00:09.579 --> 00:00:12.579
 aqua ford welcomes you 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.709
 in the modern world drinking water is very 

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:17.310
 rarely clean 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.060
 for this reason we are forced 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:20.580
 use various means 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.999
 clean years 

00:00:22.999 --> 00:00:25.499
 the most modern method of water purification 

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:28.699
 is reverse cosmos 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:31.579
 inverse space is a filtering method under 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:33.309
 pressure through a special membrane 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:35.829
 permeable water molecules and 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:37.489
 fully delaying 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:39.840
 solutes 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.510
 use of reverse osmosis 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.190
 allows you to purify water from all harmful 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.180
 impurities of bacteria and viruses as well 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.840
 public part of her 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.000
 such a nearly perfect way 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.270
 water purification is widely used in 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:54.620
 modern world 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.470
 modern technology allowed 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:59.140
 and reduce the size and cost of the membrane 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.620
 there are so many of us that the reverse of space has become 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.920
 available not only in industry but also 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.740
 on the usual kitchen 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.350
 however traditional household membrane 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:09.619
 filters has a number of significant 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:11.530
 deficiencies 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:12.520
 have to use 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.780
 cumulative capacity for clean 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.890
 waters larger than myself 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:17.450
 filter 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.460
 water pressure should 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.120
 be at least three and a half atmospheres 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.490
 large amount of water drains into 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:25.910
 sewage system 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:28.420
 plenty of control valves and tubes 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.340
 makes the filter very bulky 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.550
 so is there a way aqua ford represents 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:36.790
 back osmotic water purifier 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:39.100
 new generation of innovative 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.480
 aqua forms aqua water treatment system 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.290
 different from ordinary back osmotic 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:46.550
 filters highly efficient system 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:47.460
 automatics 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.490
 and storage capacity of a new type 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.360
 the main difference from valve armavia is it from ordinary 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.710
 systems consists in a special design 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.220
 storage tank 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.330
 ordinary park has two lanes 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.270
 divided elastic 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.630
 septum one cavity for clean 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.720
 other water sealed 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.120
 filled with air when filling tanks 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.260
 the air is worn out if you open the faucet clean 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.520
 water reaps air pushes 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.389
 stored water 

00:02:16.389 --> 00:02:18.439
 in the tank and filter aqua ford 

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:19.959
 volume divided 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:21.739
 partition into two cavities 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:24.589
 funded and managing 

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:26.679
 clean water is in accumulative 

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:30.039
 and control the cavity through the automation blog 

00:02:30.039 --> 00:02:32.279
 from connected to the water supply 

00:02:32.279 --> 00:02:34.449
 during operation of the filter clean water 

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:35.909
 fills cumulative 

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:38.649
 cavity we push water out of the control 

00:02:38.649 --> 00:02:40.039
 our three 

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:42.219
 when opening the tap tap water 

00:02:42.219 --> 00:02:45.059
 starts to flow into the control cavity and 

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:47.829
 pushes clear water 

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:49.659
 in the usual osmotic back 

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:51.109
 filter at maximum 

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:52.839
 filling storage tank 

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:55.619
 one third takes the air which leads to 

00:02:55.619 --> 00:02:57.279
 increase in size 

00:02:57.279 --> 00:02:59.629
 at the entrance to the water tanks of the aqua form system 

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:02.639
 Orion the whole volume is occupied by clean water 

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:06.089
 as far as filling with pressure in 

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:07.509
 ordinary accumulative packs 

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:09.469
 rising leading to a fall and 

00:03:09.469 --> 00:03:11.499
 system efficiency rate 

00:03:11.499 --> 00:03:13.589
 filtering falls a quantity 

00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:16.659
 discharged water training grows in case 

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:19.359
 aqua water system aqua forms 

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:21.839
 the water from the control is completely drained 

00:03:21.839 --> 00:03:24.089
 henceforth creating backpressure at 

00:03:24.089 --> 00:03:25.989
 this speed filling tank 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:28.469
 remains constantly high 

00:03:28.469 --> 00:03:31.199
 why do you choose aqua leon form 

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:34.469
 compactness aquaphor marion takes three 

00:03:34.469 --> 00:03:36.639
 times less space in the kitchen 

00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:38.759

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:41.699
 system window form orion ten minutes 

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:43.689

 system 20 minutes water flow on 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:49.499

00:03:49.499 --> 00:03:50.330

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:51.379
 five liters 

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:54.049
 10 liters standard system 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:56.519
 while saving water up to 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:58.299
 nine tons per year 

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:00.569
 due to the smaller load on the blog when 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:01.360
 filtering 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.240
 service life of the membrane and filter module 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:07.370
 aqua forms Orion twice as much and costs 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:09.750
 for service is less than half 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.760
 normal system minimum 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.170
 water pressure in the water pipe 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:15.600
 necessary for the operation of the aqua system 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.320

 water storage tanks from platforms 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.550
 Orion is always at least five liters 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.580
 while u ordinary system depends on pressure in 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.430
 plumbing efficiency 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:35.620
