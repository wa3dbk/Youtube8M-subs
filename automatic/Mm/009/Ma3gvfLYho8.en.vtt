or<00:01:12.479> other<00:01:12.810> mice<00:01:13.080> I<00:01:13.380> must<00:01:14.100> say<00:01:14.340> that<00:01:15.090> some<00:01:15.570> of

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
or other mice I must say that some of

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.840 
or other mice I must say that some of
the<00:01:15.930> Logitech<00:01:16.409> mice<00:01:16.680> tyv<00:01:17.009> used<00:01:17.220> previously

the Logitech mice tyv used previously

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.719 
the Logitech mice tyv used previously
have<00:01:18.330> got<00:01:18.540> quite<00:01:18.869> a<00:01:18.900> high<00:01:19.229> profile<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:20.159> this

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
have got quite a high profile and this

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.390 
have got quite a high profile and this
is<00:01:20.909> certainly<00:01:21.299> a<00:01:21.630> lower<00:01:22.049> profile<00:01:22.710> so<00:01:23.159> it<00:01:23.280> is

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
is certainly a lower profile so it is

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.789 
is certainly a lower profile so it is
definitely<00:01:23.700> noticeable<00:01:24.360> they<00:01:24.810> have<00:01:25.080> given

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
definitely noticeable they have given

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.280 
definitely noticeable they have given
this<00:01:25.890> a<00:01:25.950> really<00:01:26.549> low<00:01:26.850> profile<00:01:27.540> design<00:01:27.570> and

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
this a really low profile design and

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.260 
this a really low profile design and
they<00:01:28.860> mention<00:01:29.220> about<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.670> lightweight

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
they mention about the lightweight

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.899 
they mention about the lightweight
materials<00:01:30.960> now<00:01:31.619> I<00:01:31.680> was<00:01:32.220> concerned<00:01:32.610> that<00:01:32.790> this

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
materials now I was concerned that this

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.030 
materials now I was concerned that this
would<00:01:33.090> be<00:01:33.210> too<00:01:33.570> light<00:01:33.840> then<00:01:34.380> it<00:01:34.530> is<00:01:34.650> a<00:01:34.680> very

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
would be too light then it is a very

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.819 
would be too light then it is a very
light<00:01:35.310> mouse<00:01:35.579> but<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.720> grade<00:01:37.140> of<00:01:37.170> materials

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
light mouse but the grade of materials

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.109 
light mouse but the grade of materials
is<00:01:37.950> very<00:01:37.979> good<00:01:38.400> so<00:01:38.430> they're<00:01:38.670> not<00:01:38.820> cheap

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
is very good so they're not cheap

this<00:02:03.899> a<00:02:03.960> tiny<00:02:04.409> bit<00:02:04.680> higher<00:02:04.890> but<00:02:05.670> it<00:02:06.000> is<00:02:06.180> still

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
this a tiny bit higher but it is still

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.770 
this a tiny bit higher but it is still
very<00:02:06.780> comfortable<00:02:07.079> to<00:02:07.530> use<00:02:07.740> and<00:02:08.009> the

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
very comfortable to use and the

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.230 
very comfortable to use and the
cracking<00:02:09.170> is<00:02:09.470> very<00:02:09.830> very<00:02:10.130> smooth<00:02:10.490> these<00:02:10.729> low

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:11.240 
cracking is very very smooth these low

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.690 
cracking is very very smooth these low
friction<00:02:11.510> feet<00:02:12.020> are<00:02:12.230> very<00:02:12.709> low<00:02:12.950> friction<00:02:13.250> and

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
friction feet are very low friction and

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.480 
friction feet are very low friction and
they<00:02:14.120> do<00:02:14.180> a<00:02:14.300> great<00:02:14.750> job<00:02:15.080> of<00:02:15.290> making<00:02:16.100> the<00:02:16.340> mouse

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
they do a great job of making the mouse

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.520 
they do a great job of making the mouse
glide<00:02:16.850> across<00:02:17.060> multiple<00:02:17.690> different<00:02:18.110> types<00:02:18.350> of

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770

surface really nicely decent length
cable<00:02:22.280> would<00:02:22.400> have<00:02:22.520> liked<00:02:22.760> to<00:02:22.850> have<00:02:22.940> seen<00:02:23.000> a

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
cable would have liked to have seen a

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:25.780 
cable would have liked to have seen a
bit<00:02:23.600> longer<00:02:23.900> maybe<00:02:24.620> even<00:02:24.950> a<00:02:25.010> braided<00:02:25.400> cable

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
bit longer maybe even a braided cable

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.280 
bit longer maybe even a braided cable
would<00:02:26.030> have<00:02:26.150> added<00:02:26.300> on<00:02:26.510> an<00:02:26.660> air<00:02:26.840> of<00:02:27.080> sort

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
would have added on an air of sort

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.220 
would have added on an air of sort
quality<00:02:27.800> to<00:02:28.370> the<00:02:28.489> mouse<00:02:28.670> but<00:02:29.390> if<00:02:29.510> we<00:02:29.660> take<00:02:30.080> that

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
quality to the mouse but if we take that

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:31.990 
quality to the mouse but if we take that
out<00:02:30.410> of<00:02:30.440> the<00:02:30.650> equation<00:02:31.130> and<00:02:31.280> just<00:02:31.340> look<00:02:31.760> at

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
out of the equation and just look at

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.120 
out of the equation and just look at
what<00:02:32.030> you're<00:02:32.330> going<00:02:32.450> to<00:02:32.510> be<00:02:32.600> using<00:02:32.900> it<00:02:33.590> really

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
what you're going to be using it really

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.190 
what you're going to be using it really
is<00:02:34.280> very<00:02:34.310> very<00:02:35.090> comfortable<00:02:35.360> to<00:02:35.780> use<00:02:35.810> for<00:02:36.170> a

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
is very very comfortable to use for a

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.530 
is very very comfortable to use for a
prolonged<00:02:36.410> period<00:02:36.950> of<00:02:37.040> time<00:02:37.130> now<00:02:38.120> if<00:02:38.360> you're

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
prolonged period of time now if you're

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.390 
prolonged period of time now if you're
into<00:02:38.989> your<00:02:39.080> gaming<00:02:39.500> and<00:02:39.620> you're<00:02:39.950> looking<00:02:40.190> for

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
into your gaming and you're looking for

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.009 
into your gaming and you're looking for
a<00:02:40.430> wired<00:02:40.700> solution<00:02:40.940> without<00:02:41.420> spending<00:02:41.870> too

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:42.019 
a wired solution without spending too

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:43.570 
a wired solution without spending too
much<00:02:42.260> money<00:02:42.500> because<00:02:43.010> you<00:02:43.100> can't<00:02:43.280> obviously

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
much money because you can't obviously

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.630 
much money because you can't obviously
spend<00:02:43.850> more<00:02:44.090> than<00:02:44.720> this<00:02:44.900> g40<00:02:45.830> -<00:02:45.890> will<00:02:46.190> cost<00:02:46.370> you

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
spend more than this g40 - will cost you

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.479 
spend more than this g40 - will cost you
then<00:02:47.180> I<00:02:47.630> think<00:02:47.780> this<00:02:48.170> is<00:02:48.320> a<00:02:48.350> great<00:02:48.800> choice<00:02:49.130> it's

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:49.489 
then I think this is a great choice it's

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:51.790 
then I think this is a great choice it's
quite<00:02:49.700> simple<00:02:50.150> in<00:02:50.269> its<00:02:50.390> operation<00:02:50.930> the<00:02:51.440> button

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
quite simple in its operation the button

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.040 
quite simple in its operation the button
placement<00:02:52.070> is<00:02:52.489> really<00:02:53.000> good<00:02:53.180> a<00:02:53.390> nice<00:02:53.780> amount

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 
placement is really good a nice amount

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.140 
placement is really good a nice amount
of<00:02:54.170> feedback<00:02:54.620> as<00:02:54.800> well<00:02:54.950> on<00:02:55.190> those<00:02:55.580> left<00:02:55.910> and

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
of feedback as well on those left and

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.360

right<00:02:56.330> mouse<00:02:56.540> buttons<00:02:57.019> not<00:02:57.260> too<00:02:57.560> much<00:02:57.890> travel

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
right mouse buttons not too much travel

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.490 
right mouse buttons not too much travel
on<00:02:58.580> these<00:02:59.239> they've<00:02:59.569> done<00:02:59.720> a<00:02:59.750> really<00:03:00.230> good<00:03:00.440> job

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
on these they've done a really good job

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.309 
on these they've done a really good job
