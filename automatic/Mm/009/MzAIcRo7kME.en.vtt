physical business card I just think it

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.179 
physical business card I just think it
adds<00:01:15.450> a<00:01:15.600> personal<00:01:15.780> touch<00:01:16.020> and<00:01:16.710> you<00:01:16.890> can<00:01:17.040> hand

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189

it out wherever you go and it's

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.140
