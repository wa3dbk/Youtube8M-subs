one<00:00:14.460> of<00:00:14.490> the<00:00:14.639> topics<00:00:15.030> I<00:00:15.120> wanted<00:00:15.450> to<00:00:15.570> tackle<00:00:15.750> I

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
one of the topics I wanted to tackle I

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.099 
one of the topics I wanted to tackle I
get<00:00:16.139> this<00:00:16.230> question<00:00:16.440> all<00:00:16.920> the<00:00:16.980> time<00:00:17.779> what<00:00:18.779> if<00:00:18.990> I

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
get this question all the time what if I

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.859 
get this question all the time what if I
want<00:00:19.350> to<00:00:19.439> eat<00:00:19.710> less<00:00:20.100> animal<00:00:20.760> protein<00:00:21.210> how<00:00:21.570> can

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
want to eat less animal protein how can

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.599 
want to eat less animal protein how can
I<00:00:21.960> make<00:00:22.140> sure<00:00:22.500> that<00:00:22.529> I'm<00:00:22.980> getting<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.310> protein

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
I make sure that I'm getting the protein

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.939 
I make sure that I'm getting the protein
that<00:00:23.970> my<00:00:24.090> body<00:00:24.300> needs<00:00:24.449> well<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.500> first<00:00:25.740> thing

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
that my body needs well the first thing

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.609 
that my body needs well the first thing
to<00:00:26.099> think<00:00:26.130> about<00:00:26.400> is<00:00:26.849> how<00:00:27.720> do<00:00:27.779> animals<00:00:28.109> get

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
to think about is how do animals get

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.429 
to think about is how do animals get
their<00:00:28.769> protein<00:00:28.980> interestingly<00:00:29.910> they<00:00:30.900> eat<00:00:31.199> a

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
their protein interestingly they eat a

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.250 
their protein interestingly they eat a
lot<00:00:31.470> of<00:00:32.099> plants<00:00:32.700> and<00:00:32.910> that's<00:00:33.390> exactly<00:00:33.750> what<00:00:34.110> we

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
lot of plants and that's exactly what we

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.049 
lot of plants and that's exactly what we
need<00:00:34.440> to<00:00:34.559> be<00:00:34.680> doing<00:00:34.829> too<00:00:35.160> so<00:00:35.370> today<00:00:35.730> I'm<00:00:35.880> going

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
need to be doing too so today I'm going

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.880 
need to be doing too so today I'm going
to<00:00:36.149> tell<00:00:36.360> you<00:00:36.480> what<00:00:36.660> you<00:00:36.750> absolutely<00:00:36.930> have<00:00:37.860> to

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
to tell you what you absolutely have to

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.400 
to tell you what you absolutely have to
get<00:00:38.190> there<00:00:38.760> are<00:00:39.000> what<00:00:39.239> we<00:00:39.270> call<00:00:39.410> essential

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
get there are what we call essential

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.400 
get there are what we call essential
amino<00:00:40.829> acids<00:00:41.579> they<00:00:42.120> are<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.570> building<00:00:43.110> blocks

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
amino acids they are the building blocks

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.740 
amino acids they are the building blocks
of<00:00:43.680> protein<00:00:44.280> so<00:00:44.820> when<00:00:45.059> we<00:00:45.180> bring<00:00:45.510> those

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
of protein so when we bring those

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.229 
of protein so when we bring those
essential<00:00:46.200> amino<00:00:46.379> acids<00:00:46.890> into<00:00:47.219> our<00:00:47.370> diet<00:00:47.670> and

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
essential amino acids into our diet and

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.270 
essential amino acids into our diet and
would<00:00:48.420> bring<00:00:48.570> them<00:00:48.840> into<00:00:48.989> our<00:00:49.140> body<00:00:49.530> our<00:00:50.070> body

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
would bring them into our body our body

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.939 
would bring them into our body our body
gets<00:00:50.670> what<00:00:51.000> it<00:00:51.120> needs<00:00:51.149> to<00:00:51.690> make<00:00:52.050> proteins<00:00:52.710> and

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
gets what it needs to make proteins and

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.680 
gets what it needs to make proteins and
that's<00:00:53.100> important<00:00:53.640> for<00:00:53.789> our<00:00:53.850> muscles<00:00:54.449> our

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
that's important for our muscles our

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.410 
that's important for our muscles our
hormones<00:00:55.110> etc<00:00:55.680> there<00:00:56.010> are<00:00:56.039> nine<00:00:56.670> essential

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
hormones etc there are nine essential

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.830 
hormones etc there are nine essential
amino<00:00:57.960> acids<00:00:58.829> that<00:00:59.010> means<00:00:59.670> that<00:01:00.059> we<00:01:00.210> have<00:01:00.570> to

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
amino acids that means that we have to

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.930 
amino acids that means that we have to
get<00:01:00.989> these<00:01:01.260> amino<00:01:01.859> acids<00:01:02.340> these<00:01:02.489> protein

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
get these amino acids these protein

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.270 
get these amino acids these protein
building<00:01:03.329> blocks<00:01:03.570> in<00:01:03.840> through<00:01:04.619> our<00:01:04.650> diets<00:01:05.129> so

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
building blocks in through our diets so

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.289 
building blocks in through our diets so
I'm<00:01:05.430> going<00:01:05.580> to<00:01:05.610> go<00:01:05.729> through<00:01:05.939> them<00:01:06.090> really

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
I'm going to go through them really

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.510 
I'm going to go through them really

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
easy food ideas so the first ones there

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.850 
easy food ideas so the first ones there
-<00:01:11.729> together<00:01:12.200> histidine<00:01:13.200> and<00:01:13.409> phenylalanine

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
- together histidine and phenylalanine

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.730 
- together histidine and phenylalanine
and<00:01:14.400> we<00:01:14.610> can<00:01:14.790> find<00:01:15.060> those<00:01:15.240> in<00:01:15.479> tofu<00:01:16.080> so<00:01:16.530> how<00:01:16.680> do

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
and we can find those in tofu so how do

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.469 
and we can find those in tofu so how do
you<00:01:16.890> read<00:01:17.070> tofu<00:01:17.490> well<00:01:17.759> when<00:01:18.180> you're<00:01:18.299> eating

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479

eating quinoa because you knew it was a
great<00:01:35.220> source<00:01:35.549> of<00:01:35.700> protein<00:01:35.880> but<00:01:36.540> did<00:01:36.689> you<00:01:36.780> know

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
great source of protein but did you know

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.420 
great source of protein but did you know
that<00:01:37.049> it<00:01:37.290> was<00:01:37.409> delivering<00:01:37.890> that<00:01:38.040> very

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430

seeds are a really important source of
several<00:01:47.369> essential<00:01:47.820> amino<00:01:48.119> acids<00:01:48.630> but<00:01:48.990> the

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
several essential amino acids but the

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.270 
several essential amino acids but the
one<00:01:49.229> that<00:01:49.380> I'm<00:01:49.470> gonna<00:01:49.590> highlight<00:01:49.860> here<00:01:50.220> is

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
one that I'm gonna highlight here is

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.569 
one that I'm gonna highlight here is

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
leucine leucine you can get in by making

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.819 
leucine leucine you can get in by making
you<00:01:54.240> can<00:01:54.390> use<00:01:54.509> your<00:01:54.689> protein<00:01:55.259> powder<00:01:55.439> to<00:01:55.619> make

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
you can use your protein powder to make

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.620 
you can use your protein powder to make
different<00:01:56.219> proteins<00:01:56.640> you<00:01:56.850> can<00:01:56.880> sprinkle<00:01:57.299> hemp

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
different proteins you can sprinkle hemp

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.300

I<00:01:59.340> travel<00:02:00.090> with<00:02:00.119> these<00:02:00.270> I<00:02:00.479> like<00:02:00.600> to<00:02:00.719> mix<00:02:00.899> them

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
I travel with these I like to mix them

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:01.999 
I travel with these I like to mix them
with<00:02:01.140> a<00:02:01.200> little<00:02:01.409> bit<00:02:01.500> of<00:02:01.530> honey<00:02:01.770> it's

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
with a little bit of honey it's

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:02.749 
with a little bit of honey it's
delicious

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
so moving on did you know that mushrooms

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.690 
so moving on did you know that mushrooms
are<00:02:05.759> a<00:02:05.790> source<00:02:06.090> of<00:02:06.240> amino<00:02:06.450> acids<00:02:07.020> that's

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
are a source of amino acids that's

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.120 
are a source of amino acids that's
right<00:02:07.850> mushrooms<00:02:08.810> actually<00:02:09.080> provide<00:02:09.890> you

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
right mushrooms actually provide you

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.370 
right mushrooms actually provide you
with<00:02:10.369> protein<00:02:10.580> and<00:02:11.060> did<00:02:11.420> you<00:02:11.510> also<00:02:11.780> know<00:02:12.170> that

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
with protein and did you also know that

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:13.780 
with protein and did you also know that
there<00:02:12.530> are<00:02:12.590> actually<00:02:12.980> great<00:02:13.280> ways<00:02:13.520> that<00:02:13.550> you

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
there are actually great ways that you

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.640 
there are actually great ways that you
can<00:02:14.000> get<00:02:14.120> mushrooms<00:02:14.569> in<00:02:14.720> really<00:02:15.050> easily<00:02:15.410> for

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
can get mushrooms in really easily for

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.830 
can get mushrooms in really easily for
example<00:02:16.370> you<00:02:16.550> could<00:02:16.670> get<00:02:16.849> it<00:02:16.970> in<00:02:17.120> with<00:02:17.630> this

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
example you could get it in with this

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.140 
example you could get it in with this
bar<00:02:18.200> yup<00:02:18.650> and<00:02:18.830> on<00:02:19.010> the<00:02:19.190> Go<00:02:19.310> bar<00:02:19.520> I<00:02:19.819> actually

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
bar yup and on the Go bar I actually

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.449 
bar yup and on the Go bar I actually
will<00:02:20.569> grind<00:02:20.900> up<00:02:21.110> or<00:02:21.349> crumble<00:02:22.040> up<00:02:22.130> some<00:02:22.340> of

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
will grind up or crumble up some of

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:23.979 
will grind up or crumble up some of
these<00:02:22.550> dried<00:02:22.940> mushrooms<00:02:23.390> and<00:02:23.599> put<00:02:23.690> them<00:02:23.840> into

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:23.989 
these dried mushrooms and put them into

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:26.050 
these dried mushrooms and put them into
my<00:02:24.170> smoothies<00:02:24.650> and<00:02:25.010> I<00:02:25.190> also<00:02:25.400> use<00:02:25.730> them<00:02:25.910> and

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
my smoothies and I also use them and

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.750 
my smoothies and I also use them and
when<00:02:26.150> I<00:02:26.209> make<00:02:26.800> veggie<00:02:27.800> burgers<00:02:28.250> at<00:02:28.400> home<00:02:28.550> and

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
when I make veggie burgers at home and

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.280 
when I make veggie burgers at home and
that's<00:02:28.880> sort<00:02:29.030> of<00:02:29.150> a<00:02:29.270> thing<00:02:29.450> and<00:02:29.600> so<00:02:29.780> here<00:02:30.080> we're

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
that's sort of a thing and so here we're

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.470 
that's sort of a thing and so here we're
getting<00:02:30.410> a<00:02:30.650> great<00:02:30.860> source<00:02:31.160> of<00:02:31.340> lysine<00:02:31.910> another
