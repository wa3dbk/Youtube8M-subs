 ah 

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:15.900
 Y 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.140
 air 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:24.150
 definition of the air the air is the mixture 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.150
 of gases that form the atmosphere 

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:30.630
 and physical properties of the air despite 

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:32.940
 of being tasteless painless and colorless 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.030
 we perceive the air through winds 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.250
 airplanes and birds in which he floats and 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.560
 move we also feel its impact on 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.200
 our body we easily conclude that 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:45.270
 the air has real and concrete existence 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:49.770
 occupying place in the space that we 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:52.980
 surrounds chemical properties reacts with 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:56.160
 the temperature condensing on ice to 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.949
 low temperatures and produces currents 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.739
 of air is composed of several 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.320
 elements including oxygen and 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:08.460
 carbon dioxide basic elements 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:11.040
 for life air components the 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.770
 clean air components and pure form 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.500
 one layer approximately 500 thousand 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:21.049
 million tons surrounding the 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:27.659
 earth its composition is as follows 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:31.409
 nitrogen 78.0 3 in volume oxygen 20 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:36.350
 points 99 percent in volume dioxide 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:40.679
 of carbon 0.03 percent by volume 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:45.090
 hydrogen 0.01 percent by volume 

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:47.759
 Water vapor is somewhat variable 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:51.270
 that ozone and have particles 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:53.580
 variable air pollution is 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.549
 the one that occurs as a result of 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:58.799
 the emission of toxic substances the 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.979
 Air pollution can cause 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:05.099
 disorders such as burning eyes 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:08.519
 and irritation and itching on the nose 

00:02:05.099 --> 00:02:10.769
 throat and lower respiratory problems 

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:12.870
 certain circumstances some 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:15.860
 chemical substances found in the 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:18.480
 polluted air can cause cancer 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:21.329
 congenital malformations brain damage 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.370
 and nervous system disorders as well 

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:26.080
 as lung and pathway injuries 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.090
 respiratory at a certain level 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.580
 concentration and after a certain time 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.860
 of exposure to certain pollutants 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:35.590
 air are extremely dangerous and can 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.900
 cause certain disorders and even the 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.550
 death of the different components 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.410
 variables that exist in the different 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.870
 places you can find elements 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:46.030
 that will contaminate the same and these 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:50.040
 elements can be carbon monoxide 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:52.600
 carbon dioxide chlorofluorocarbons 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:56.310
 hazardous air pollutants 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.310
 lead ozone and so on
