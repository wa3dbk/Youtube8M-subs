00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
it yet what multiclassing is is when you

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.410 
it yet what multiclassing is is when you
start<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.399> game<00:00:59.609> there's<00:01:00.059> eight<00:01:00.239> different

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:02.299 
long sort and when he uses the halberd

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:04.450 
long sort and when he uses the halberd
he<00:02:02.659> can<00:02:02.810> use<00:02:02.990> these<00:02:03.140> big<00:02:03.439> room<00:02:03.860> sweeping

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460

down on the ground and create a

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:10.029 
down on the ground and create a
shockwave<00:02:08.569> but<00:02:09.289> when<00:02:09.410> he<00:02:09.470> switches<00:02:09.739> to<00:02:10.009> the

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
shockwave but when he switches to the

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.520 
shockwave but when he switches to the
longsword<00:02:10.580> his<00:02:10.940> abilities<00:02:11.599> change<00:02:12.050> and<00:02:12.260> he

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
longsword his abilities change and he

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.170 
longsword his abilities change and he
can<00:02:12.680> then<00:02:12.830> base<00:02:13.130> it<00:02:13.340> basically<00:02:13.670> be<00:02:13.880> able<00:02:14.060> to

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
can then base it basically be able to

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.270 
can then base it basically be able to
attack<00:02:14.720> a<00:02:14.750> single<00:02:15.200> thing<00:02:15.380> and<00:02:15.620> do<00:02:15.890> a<00:02:15.920> lot<00:02:16.160> of

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:25.549 
to fit that class and the abilities on

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:27.400 
to fit that class and the abilities on
those<00:02:25.730> weapons<00:02:25.940> are<00:02:26.269> different<00:02:26.810> so<00:02:27.140> as<00:02:27.260> you
