00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.920
 hello friends in this video we will try 

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:07.529
 to solve many of the doubts that still 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.830
 have about the bypass process right 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:09.830
 life 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:19.360
 this process works since they 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.760
 they have a server where they have the 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:24.730
 validation files that's why 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:27.430
 they provide an ip s &amp; p us 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:31.119
 we place it in the hot file either in 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:33.970
 windows or mac what they occupy and what 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:36.790
 will do is redirect the itunes in 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:39.280
 instead of redirecting it to the servers 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:42.670
 of apple directing towards 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:46.059
 servers where they request the 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:48.309
 certification files and perform the 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:49.460
 validation of our device and the 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:53.590
 iTunes 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.590
 the way it works 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:02.380
 the icloud account is deleted when 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:05.290
 the bypass has been done in fact 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:07.810
 we can access the account of 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:10.180
 icloud and we see that it will not be active 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.550
 no fact we can enter our 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:15.640
 account and synchronize our device 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:17.950
 but yes, if you update us 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.710
 restore this device goes back to 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:23.080
 block with the original account due 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.870
 that the apple servers are going to 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:28.390
 send the verification that's why it 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:29.950
 Lock again with the original account 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:33.810
 so be careful not to 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.810
 update the restored on your device 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:42.590
 the device in the case of the ipad and 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.870
 the ipad are completely 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:49.980
 functional unless the ipads in 3g 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:52.650
 or 4g that part will not work and in the 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:56.280
 case of the iphones these remain so 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:58.530
 While there is putt there is no solution 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.230
 still for that to fix the 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.590
 carrier though and it's a great 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:03.590
 advantage 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.250
 the developers tell us what is 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:17.470
 fully compatible with betas that 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.470
 the favorites of 28 have left 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:27.569
 these processes do not work because 

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:29.610
 they are using a code that 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:33.239
 redirects to a local server 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:35.549
 they and they do not send verification 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:37.620
 towards the device that's why 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:39.599
 although the iTunes already comes out 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:43.830
 features and capacity 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:47.129
 device on the phone in the table 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:50.489
 the ipod is still blocked 

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:52.739
 processes do not work do not trust those 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:57.620
 people and wait for it to be published 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:57.620
 the ip of the original developers 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.840
 some of my followers have 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:08.090
 commented that it did not work them 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.430
 video before 15 to jump the loop 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.980
 of the bypass however is not that no 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:15.170
 work is that they have used 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:18.200
 applications as type rate 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:20.330
 until home of the wave where the only thing 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.850
 do these applications is missing the 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:25.730
 activation of itunes however not the 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:27.800
 of the device and so that my video 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.080
 work have to perform the bypass 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:33.500
 correctly both on the device 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:36.170
 as in the iTunes and that will be with the 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:38.810
 server that I posted here below the 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:42.160
 video or on my social networks once 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.160
 the server is active 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:50.459
 the developers are working 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:52.739
 in the old methods of the ip however 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:55.019
 have had enough problems since 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:57.420
 paypal has blocked their accounts together 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:59.370
 with their money then they have not 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:01.829
 could buy that server for 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:04.290
 have it active are also 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:06.870
 developing an application which we 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:09.689
 will allow automate all this process 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:12.959
 however, he mentions a code of 

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:14.849
 activation where we do not know if it goes to 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:17.609
 charge for each device that 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:20.250
 we unlock this we will know until we 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:21.549
 let us know the application by 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:24.039
 full 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:26.110
 and good friends, I hope and helped you 

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:29.050
 and you have already solved many of your doubts 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:31.659
 Do not hesitate to leave some other question 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:34.270
 that have doubt here below with pleasure 

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:36.639
 I answer it and add it to their networks 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:39.009
 I leave them here in the box 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:41.470
 information or right here on the screen 

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:44.669
 and good they have an excellent day and 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:44.669
 Thanks for seeing me
