even<00:01:26.340> know<00:01:26.549> when<00:01:26.759> it's<00:01:27.030> been<00:01:27.180> a<00:01:27.210> long<00:01:27.420> time<00:01:27.659> so

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
even know when it's been a long time so

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:29.990 
even know when it's been a long time so
we're<00:01:28.860> talking<00:01:28.979> about<00:01:29.189> valuable<00:01:29.670> information

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
we're talking about valuable information

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.240 
we're talking about valuable information
that<00:01:30.299> could<00:01:30.540> be<00:01:30.689> potentially<00:01:31.320> lost<00:01:31.710> right

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
that could be potentially lost right

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.069 
that could be potentially lost right
it's<00:01:32.850> always<00:01:33.030> a<00:01:33.150> good<00:01:33.299> idea<00:01:33.360> say<00:01:33.930> you're

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
it's always a good idea say you're

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.539 
it's always a good idea say you're
working<00:01:34.200> on<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:34.439> college<00:01:34.829> paper<00:01:34.979> like<00:01:35.250> our<00:01:35.369> last

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
working on a college paper like our last

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.160 
working on a college paper like our last
segment<00:01:35.790> we<00:01:36.060> talked<00:01:36.299> about<00:01:36.360> okay<00:01:36.750> so<00:01:36.810> you<00:01:36.960> got

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
segment we talked about okay so you got

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.749 
segment we talked about okay so you got
this<00:01:37.290> new<00:01:37.470> computer<00:01:37.770> now<00:01:38.310> you're<00:01:38.460> typing

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
this new computer now you're typing

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.429 
this new computer now you're typing
these<00:01:38.970> important<00:01:39.570> documents<00:01:39.659> what<00:01:40.170> happens

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
these important documents what happens

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.170 
these important documents what happens
if<00:01:40.590> you<00:01:40.680> lose<00:01:40.920> them<00:01:41.159> it's<00:01:41.700> always<00:01:41.880> a<00:01:41.970> good<00:01:42.150> idea

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
if you lose them it's always a good idea

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.240 
if you lose them it's always a good idea
to<00:01:42.540> have<00:01:42.659> them<00:01:42.780> on<00:01:42.930> a<00:01:42.960> flash<00:01:43.409> drive<00:01:43.619> and<00:01:43.829> a<00:01:44.009> CD

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
to have them on a flash drive and a CD

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.740 
to have them on a flash drive and a CD
so<00:01:44.430> you<00:01:44.460> have<00:01:44.640> them<00:01:44.759> in<00:01:44.820> three<00:01:45.060> locations<00:01:45.390> so

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
so you have them in three locations so

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.420 
so you have them in three locations so
let's<00:01:45.930> say<00:01:46.110> your<00:01:46.649> house<00:01:46.829> were<00:01:47.009> to<00:01:47.130> catch<00:01:47.280> on

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
let's say your house were to catch on

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.249 
let's say your house were to catch on
fire<00:01:47.610> you<00:01:47.880> lose<00:01:48.060> your<00:01:48.270> computer<00:01:48.630> and<00:01:48.780> your<00:01:48.899> CD

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
fire you lose your computer and your CD

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.410 
fire you lose your computer and your CD
but<00:01:49.920> you<00:01:50.040> still<00:01:50.250> have<00:01:50.369> that<00:01:50.460> other<00:01:50.610> backup<00:01:51.210> at

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
but you still have that other backup at

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.539 
but you still have that other backup at
another<00:01:51.840> remote<00:01:52.200> location<00:01:52.740> so<00:01:53.340> if<00:01:53.399> it's

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
another remote location so if it's

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:54.920 
another remote location so if it's
really<00:01:53.729> something<00:01:54.090> important<00:01:54.570> make<00:01:54.689> sure<00:01:54.720> to

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
really something important make sure to

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.780 
really something important make sure to
have<00:01:55.049> multiple<00:01:55.530> backup<00:01:55.829> well<00:01:56.219> often<00:01:56.610> should

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
have multiple backup well often should

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.760 
have multiple backup well often should
you<00:01:56.850> backup<00:01:57.180> your<00:01:57.390> computer<00:01:57.990> it<00:01:58.469> really

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
you backup your computer it really

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.410 
you backup your computer it really
depends<00:01:59.189> on<00:01:59.250> how<00:01:59.430> much<00:01:59.610> stuff<00:01:59.969> you<00:02:00.149> have<00:02:00.180> on

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
depends on how much stuff you have on

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.120 
depends on how much stuff you have on
your<00:02:00.570> computer<00:02:00.659> if<00:02:01.049> you<00:02:01.200> have<00:02:01.229> really

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
your computer if you have really

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.319 
your computer if you have really
important<00:02:02.490> pictures<00:02:02.790> that<00:02:02.909> you<00:02:03.000> don't<00:02:03.180> want

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
important pictures that you don't want

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.420 
important pictures that you don't want
to<00:02:03.420> lose<00:02:03.570> probably<00:02:03.869> every<00:02:04.380> day<00:02:04.560> you<00:02:05.189> won't

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
to lose probably every day you won't

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.459 
to lose probably every day you won't
lose<00:02:05.850> space<00:02:06.210> backing<00:02:06.630> up<00:02:06.750> every<00:02:06.990> day<00:02:07.140> because

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
lose space backing up every day because

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.139 
lose space backing up every day because
it'll<00:02:07.710> just<00:02:07.740> overwrite<00:02:08.399> what<00:02:08.819> you've<00:02:09.000> already

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
it'll just overwrite what you've already

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.119 
it'll just overwrite what you've already
done<00:02:09.360> it<00:02:09.420> won't<00:02:09.660> take<00:02:09.869> up<00:02:09.989> any<00:02:10.110> more<00:02:10.410> space<00:02:10.619> all

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
done it won't take up any more space all

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.200 
done it won't take up any more space all
right<00:02:11.280> let's<00:02:11.610> move<00:02:11.819> on<00:02:12.000> to<00:02:12.209> the<00:02:12.660> tablet

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
right let's move on to the tablet

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
as easy as a couple of click correct

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:37.830 
as easy as a couple of click correct
apps<00:02:36.370> I<00:02:36.580> should<00:02:36.760> correct<00:02:36.880> so<00:02:37.210> it's<00:02:37.450> really

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
apps I should correct so it's really

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.060 
apps I should correct so it's really
simple<00:02:38.140> something<00:02:38.650> that<00:02:38.770> you<00:02:38.860> should<00:02:39.040> just

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
simple something that you should just

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:41.010 
simple something that you should just
take<00:02:39.310> the<00:02:39.460> time<00:02:39.610> out<00:02:39.640> to<00:02:39.790> do<00:02:40.060> because<00:02:40.750> if<00:02:40.960> you

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.020 
take the time out to do because if you

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.200 
take the time out to do because if you
lose<00:02:41.380> your<00:02:41.530> information<00:02:42.070> chances<00:02:42.910> are<00:02:43.030> if<00:02:43.150> you

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:43.210 
lose your information chances are if you

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:44.910 
lose your information chances are if you
haven't<00:02:43.510> backed<00:02:43.630> up<00:02:43.780> your<00:02:43.900> computer<00:02:44.320> is<00:02:44.500> it

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
haven't backed up your computer is it

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:45.630 
haven't backed up your computer is it
gone<00:02:45.070> forever

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
gone forever

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.760 
gone forever
there<00:02:46.180> are<00:02:46.330> some<00:02:46.570> recovery<00:02:47.050> tools<00:02:47.380> that<00:02:47.590> can

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 
there are some recovery tools that can

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:50.490 
there are some recovery tools that can
recover<00:02:48.640> data<00:02:49.060> but<00:02:49.300> they<00:02:49.420> can<00:02:49.630> be<00:02:49.780> costly<00:02:50.260> so

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
recover data but they can be costly so

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.950 
recover data but they can be costly so
