 that is the petit had a resort 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.730
 a tool very similar to the part of a doctor for the good part to try 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:21.520
 you create resize delete nine participants 

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:23.869
 come on 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:26.880
 until 20 that with windows xp 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.880
 in the sector 

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:32.430
 the tout here 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.450
 what are you waiting for? 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.330
 the actor told that to know the country Mayan boot that I do not want to show how 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:39.800
 Is it in the disk drive for you right my accountant? 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.150
 to manage 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.550
 disk management 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.330
 is what I can visualize with the speech was was the only part are of 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:53.810
 16 gigas today the girl wanted to break the serve in two factions papi an image 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:57.740
 on the other side back up the files before formatting the english something 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:58.420
 of the type 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.059
 it is possible to shrink the partition if you create another partition on the 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:03.420
 with this procedure 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.190
 and to lusa the country to this tool is part of an insulator 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.280
 stays within the most many 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.280
 remembering that down but death 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.350
 you come here on the site aries bul doctoral thesis 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.960
 a qimonda other 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
 then the 13 point 0 version 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.010
 you have here 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.580
 the file there or t 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.000
 3 and 1 77m flow to this after you record quit this 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:42.730
 on the saber to be able to use the format 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:46.080
 and that other quiet place in luck professor let's 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.250
 or even touched how real you are going to get there other classes about more 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.250
 boot 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:59.270
 Come back here now. 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:00.710
 Let's wait 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.740
 along with the cd round I'll start my brand 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:04.990
 cida 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.310
 and closes 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.310
 I'll go into this step and configure multiple September 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:12.439
 so many 

00:02:12.439 --> 00:02:14.559
 lots of fathers art 

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:16.549
 first went wrong 

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:17.849
 after 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:21.449
 Abbot said that the machine shortage gave more boot 

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:24.729
 and now travel with ketap hole 

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:27.729
 and in this they are a machine designed to listen 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:35.410
 among the various small options 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.410
 the choice is the least you expect 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:43.299
 it will load the windows home server 

00:02:44.919 --> 00:02:47.829
 the country change already loaded on my machine reminded that if windows 

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:51.589
 and windows live and flavor packed with tech tools that on the side of 

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:53.399
 Watch that at least this 

00:02:53.399 --> 00:02:55.089
 similar to other versions 

00:02:55.089 --> 00:02:57.989
 or you can call the menu here too I feel good 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:00.109
 hbc of minor 

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:02.629
 the glass that shocks me more practical 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:05.629
 I heard here included 1 

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:13.589
 to tite the buff and I'm here to choose the tool that both now 

00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:16.589
 that the petit tiuí santigo menditto 

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:28.919
 is a well-updated and very interesting tool is showing 

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:33.719
 honey and 2 points I'm going to give a right here I'll choose option at the end of 

00:03:33.719 --> 00:03:35.529
 silas fact 

00:03:35.529 --> 00:03:40.309
 or after tea also the mime up here the musician option of salts 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:46.329
 now simply as together injected into nothing the cliq ensure in the star 

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:48.379
 to decrease 

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:50.839
 the English partition 

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:54.250
 photo file decreases to the well of mine this partition until that space 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.950
 is marked because they have filed after working where they have a 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:59.069
 free space 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:01.459
 where my more or less in the middle 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:03.879
 when yesterday 

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:05.699
 but it did not happen 

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:09.309
 to happen until clicking the apply button is the panic eating everyone 

00:04:09.309 --> 00:04:14.059
 you who make a change apply fasano appeal at stake I make one 

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:17.900
 lot of operations and apply that sometimes can cause some kind day 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.849
 so I'm going to apply this professional attraction now and they 

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:23.849
 which has reduced the size of the partition 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:36.520
 so that's where the procedure ends ok 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.740
 now I will create a new team partition in the right decathlon 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:44.009
 customer or simply 

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:47.099
 click the create button above 

00:04:47.099 --> 00:04:50.099
 I can not miss to apportion 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.020
 thereafter having almost a primary logical unit for primary 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:00.629
 the case 

00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:04.159
 the type of formatting and the fateh the forehead on three fronts 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:07.650
 the letter assigns to the unit 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:10.650
 standard size 

00:05:11.309 --> 00:05:14.309
 and now apply 

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:28.310
 make the beer create another passage to mention this 

00:05:28.309 --> 00:05:29.250
 to move 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:32.530
 the sauber rider made a chorus with sizing this promotion tool 

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:33.120
 to move 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.069
 that is very interesting 

00:05:35.069 --> 00:05:37.710
 Let's have municipal here 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:40.509
 It diminishes a little bit of this one here ok. 

00:05:40.509 --> 00:05:42.389
 to apply 

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:45.389
 and they 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:54.389
 look how interesting a movie was also decided so it's very simple 

00:05:54.389 --> 00:05:57.389
 work comparisons create erase a faith 

00:05:58.259 --> 00:06:01.189
 all kinds of action that many times is not something very simple 

00:06:01.189 --> 00:06:04.669
 realized until possible with the tools of the windows itself 

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:08.669
 in the case of man and injuring 

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:14.129
 a part - are now going to see a small part are simple acts 

00:06:14.689 --> 00:06:18.469
 borges arraes the applies guradas such play 

00:06:18.469 --> 00:06:21.309
 passing everywhere 

00:06:21.309 --> 00:06:24.460
 to apply 

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:27.460
 with the tuning fork from one side to the other 

00:06:32.219 --> 00:06:35.219
 and to finish now I'm going to create another partition here 

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:39.900
 what was left 

00:06:45.589 --> 00:06:48.589
 to apply 

00:06:53.289 --> 00:06:55.699
 and now they will vote as cranes to know 

00:06:55.699 --> 00:06:58.160
 of the initial logical butiá rais 

00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:59.669
 one of these changes 

00:06:59.669 --> 00:07:01.469
 occurred without any problem 

00:07:01.469 --> 00:07:03.569
 close with an application 

00:07:03.569 --> 00:07:06.569
 no initial march 

00:07:17.569 --> 00:07:21.009
 it was again how I despaired 

00:07:21.009 --> 00:07:23.770
 the attack is my computer 

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:25.419
 all units are 

00:07:25.419 --> 00:07:28.039
 this process we will divide 

00:07:28.039 --> 00:07:32.169
 homero says cintra exports in the year add now that also right 

00:07:32.169 --> 00:07:35.169
 managing a disk management does not despair 

00:07:38.479 --> 00:07:40.379
 click here 7 

00:07:40.379 --> 00:07:42.089
 effect 

00:07:42.089 --> 00:07:43.399
 three productions 

00:07:43.399 --> 00:07:47.549
 and now I could get the archives of cecompi the priority given to me is a 

00:07:47.549 --> 00:07:50.959
 another unit f then format your spouse the new system 

00:07:51.779 --> 00:07:54.989
 note that the procedure is very simple and common the technicians 

00:07:55.629 --> 00:07:58.629
 I remember being deaf at 8pm 

00:08:00.339 --> 00:08:02.639
 you will see in luck 

00:08:02.639 --> 00:08:04.550
 human teacher dotcom 

00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:06.089
 sharing knowledge
