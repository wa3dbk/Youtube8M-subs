00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:06.069
 and healthy grayer for it in papillot 

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:09.240
 with olive oil lemon 

00:00:06.069 --> 00:00:09.240
 capers and pastis 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:13.090
 being a judge is not only healthy but 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:15.309
 is also very simple to make it is 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:16.330
 so this recipe is for 4 people 4 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:19.980
 trout 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:19.980
 little spring lemon 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.040
 green beans 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.320
 and then our black olives 100 grams 

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:34.690
 to be precise 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.690
 capers and our pastis natural 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.100
 We are going to take some potato to 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.850
 and we will start with you 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.070
 to put 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.900
 first wash well because we are going to 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.660
 serve in the peel and then it is 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:48.430
 important that they are nice and clean 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.280
 you set up some salted water and we 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.510
 are going to cook nicely 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.610
 the beans that must of course also 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.360
 be crossed very easy trick 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:57.010
 before 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.960
 put them all next to each other in the same 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.160
 direction and we just fight it 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.220
 stalk off 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:07.900
 the other side that can stay there to 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:10.360
 we cook them in salted water and 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:17.440
 in the meantime I am already setting up the head 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:19.180
 the over I am about 180 degrees and 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.790
 then the hitherto work 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.869
 papillot I do that with silver 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.970
 paper 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:26.830
 go and fold them double so that a nice one 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:31.810
 stiff is that they certainly open 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:33.610
 during baking and thus papillotes 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.280
 actually an ideal dish for them 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.820
 barbecue oh okay it's not great 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.619
 weather 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.410
 so replace our barbecue with 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:43.450
 my about our trouts you need the 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:44.890
 tasty crackers are fresh of course 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.170
 and we are not going to spice either 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.920
 inside and outside 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.920
 pepper and salt 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:57.990
 and then you just shoot at us 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.990
 sheet of silver paper 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:07.360
 the fresh herbal thyme that just got 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:10.300
 fine shredding and that region over our 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.459
 fish and medical actually do not meet this 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:15.450
 dish so fill the papillots and 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:15.450
 now bake the over 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.140
 blantyre 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:25.819
 the shed to the trot of course and me 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.530
 go anyway with my hands so that 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:29.530
 the sand due to the small loss that there is 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.750
 is still hanging around that that has disappeared 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:36.760
 finely chop and then sprinkle it 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.760
 spring onions just about our fish 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.260
 olives 100 grams approximately 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.260
 and add it to the papillots 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.120
 I left the capers for a while 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.510
 click and we distribute it there 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.510
 about 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:12.620
 simply cut lemon into slices 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.620
 two discs with person 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:21.380
 and then our potato has that moment 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:24.110
 he his pretty done we pour it off 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:26.580
 and we are going to cut it into nice discs 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:28.410
 the boats are cooking the potatoes 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.650
 are cooked so they can also be divided 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.650
 to become 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:41.099
 add the potatoes to add snow 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.099
 to it 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.599
 and then it is very simple 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.879
 actually we are just going to have a few more 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:52.470
 pour drops of olive oil 

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:52.470
 and season well with pepper and salt 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.690
 make sure especially a papillot that looks good 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:04.140
 is seasoned 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:05.670
 that is really very important and then the 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:09.210
 secret ingredients 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:11.930
 a little pastis not too much but still 

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:11.930
 not a few 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:16.170
 and then a little chopped flat 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:19.040
 before parsley 

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:19.040
 close the papillots 

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:33.450
 and that's it we're going to be beautiful now 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:33.450
 fold tightly 

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:45.030
 and then they go into the oven in about 25 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.030
 minutes at 180 degrees 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:54.590

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:59.120
 to serve 

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:01.580
 just put it on a plate porridge kept open 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:03.410
 folds and then the smell that comes out 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:05.720
