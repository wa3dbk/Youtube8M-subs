00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.310 
guys can see and the other thing that I

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.490 
guys can see and the other thing that I
do<00:04:54.370> like<00:04:54.640> is<00:04:54.820> a<00:04:54.850> lot<00:04:55.090> of<00:04:55.180> silicone<00:04:55.450> cases<00:04:55.780> when

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:56.500 
do like is a lot of silicone cases when

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.080 
do like is a lot of silicone cases when
they<00:04:56.590> come<00:04:56.800> up<00:04:56.830> to<00:04:57.040> the<00:04:57.160> to<00:04:57.430> the<00:04:57.460> border<00:04:57.880> they

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.090 
they come up to the to the border they

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:00.450 
they come up to the to the border they
just<00:04:58.420> kind<00:04:58.570> of<00:04:58.630> go<00:04:58.990> and<00:04:59.140> they<00:04:59.200> stop<00:04:59.560> so<00:05:00.160> it<00:05:00.250> kind

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460 
just kind of go and they stop so it kind

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:01.620 
just kind of go and they stop so it kind
of<00:05:00.490> leaves<00:05:00.640> like<00:05:00.760> a<00:05:00.850> little<00:05:01.090> bit<00:05:01.180> of<00:05:01.270> a<00:05:01.360> cliff

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:01.630 
of leaves like a little bit of a cliff

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:03.180 
of leaves like a little bit of a cliff
and<00:05:01.900> this<00:05:02.320> actually<00:05:02.560> what<00:05:02.830> it<00:05:02.860> does<00:05:03.010> is<00:05:03.160> it

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:03.190 
and this actually what it does is it

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:05.010 
and this actually what it does is it
kind<00:05:03.430> of<00:05:03.460> falls<00:05:03.790> down<00:05:04.120> so<00:05:04.360> it<00:05:04.420> kind<00:05:04.570> of<00:05:04.630> slams

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:05.020 
kind of falls down so it kind of slams

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:07.950 
kind of falls down so it kind of slams
down<00:05:05.430> once<00:05:06.430> it<00:05:06.580> hits<00:05:06.820> the<00:05:07.000> screen<00:05:07.330> so<00:05:07.930> you

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:07.960 
down once it hits the screen so you

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.060 
down once it hits the screen so you
don't<00:05:08.140> feel<00:05:08.260> like<00:05:08.290> you're<00:05:08.500> actually<00:05:08.620> in<00:05:08.950> a

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:09.070 
don't feel like you're actually in a

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:10.560 
don't feel like you're actually in a
border<00:05:09.430> it<00:05:09.550> just<00:05:09.700> kind<00:05:09.850> of<00:05:09.910> feels<00:05:10.060> like<00:05:10.270> you

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:10.570 
border it just kind of feels like you

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:12.210 
border it just kind of feels like you
know<00:05:10.600> it's<00:05:10.840> just<00:05:10.930> slants<00:05:11.560> down<00:05:11.590> and<00:05:11.980> it<00:05:12.040> just

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:12.220 
know it's just slants down and it just

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:14.160 
know it's just slants down and it just
kind<00:05:12.400> of<00:05:12.460> evens<00:05:13.300> out<00:05:13.390> the<00:05:13.450> case<00:05:13.780> and<00:05:13.900> becomes

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:14.170 
kind of evens out the case and becomes

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:16.620 
kind of evens out the case and becomes
flush<00:05:14.530> for<00:05:14.770> a<00:05:14.830> good<00:05:15.040> like<00:05:15.570> millisecond<00:05:16.570> and

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:16.630 
flush for a good like millisecond and

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:17.910 
flush for a good like millisecond and
then<00:05:16.750> it<00:05:16.810> goes<00:05:16.900> right<00:05:17.080> back<00:05:17.230> up<00:05:17.440> into<00:05:17.650> the

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:17.920 
then it goes right back up into the

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:20.850 
then it goes right back up into the
actual<00:05:18.250> silicone<00:05:19.090> case<00:05:19.330> it<00:05:20.170> is<00:05:20.290> a<00:05:20.320> very<00:05:20.650> very

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:20.860 
actual silicone case it is a very very

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:23.280 
actual silicone case it is a very very
it's<00:05:21.310> a<00:05:21.460> it's<00:05:21.700> like<00:05:21.820> okay<00:05:22.150> here<00:05:22.360> we<00:05:22.450> go<00:05:22.480> so<00:05:23.140> it's

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:23.290 
it's a it's like okay here we go so it's

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:26.100 
it's a it's like okay here we go so it's
a<00:05:23.440> slightly<00:05:24.040> thicker<00:05:24.550> case<00:05:24.880> yet<00:05:25.390> it<00:05:25.540> does<00:05:25.810> keep

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:26.110 
a slightly thicker case yet it does keep

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:27.960 
a slightly thicker case yet it does keep
