got up
yeah<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:35.910> radiator<00:00:36.390> went<00:00:36.600> in<00:00:36.719> alright

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
yeah the radiator went in alright

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.530 
yeah the radiator went in alright
the<00:00:39.030> only<00:00:39.210> problem<00:00:39.780> now<00:00:39.809> is<00:00:39.989> this<00:00:40.530> oil<00:00:41.540> cooler

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
the only problem now is this oil cooler

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.290 
the only problem now is this oil cooler
line<00:00:43.100> for<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.160> transmission<00:00:44.670> that<00:00:45.000> connects

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
line for the transmission that connects

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.400 
line for the transmission that connects
to<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.570> radiator<00:00:46.110> it<00:00:46.649> pulls<00:00:47.219> off<00:00:47.460> like<00:00:47.730> this

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:48.410 
to the radiator it pulls off like this

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.850 
to the radiator it pulls off like this
and<00:00:49.410> it<00:00:49.950> pushes<00:00:50.190> on<00:00:50.489> yeah<00:00:51.420> it's<00:00:51.570> on<00:00:51.780> that<00:00:52.620> one

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
and it pushes on yeah it's on that one

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.069 
and it pushes on yeah it's on that one
leaks<00:00:53.219> because<00:00:53.820> I<00:00:54.120> started<00:00:54.449> up<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.690> engine

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
leaks because I started up the engine

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.279 
leaks because I started up the engine
took<00:00:55.590> it<00:00:55.800> so<00:00:56.010> I<00:00:56.039> can<00:00:56.309> get<00:00:56.460> some<00:00:57.020> pressure<00:00:58.020> and

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
took it so I can get some pressure and

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.799 
took it so I can get some pressure and
Alliance<00:00:58.770> for<00:00:59.070> what<00:00:59.370> fluid<00:00:59.789> see<00:01:00.329> if<00:01:00.420> they<00:01:00.539> leak

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
Alliance for what fluid see if they leak

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:06.170 
Alliance for what fluid see if they leak
that<00:01:01.440> one<00:01:01.680> leaks<00:01:02.359> that<00:01:03.359> one's<00:01:03.629> okay<00:01:04.070> and<00:01:05.180> yeah

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
that one leaks that one's okay and yeah

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.420 
that one leaks that one's okay and yeah
I<00:01:06.210> got<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.600> radiator<00:01:06.930> hose<00:01:07.280> hoses<00:01:08.280> and

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
I got the radiator hose hoses and

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.020 
I got the radiator hose hoses and
everything<00:01:08.850> I<00:01:09.030> got<00:01:09.210> I<00:01:09.360> went<00:01:09.600> to<00:01:09.659> Autozone<00:01:09.810> so<00:01:10.530> I

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
everything I got I went to Autozone so I

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.640 
everything I got I went to Autozone so I
haven't<00:01:12.030> put<00:01:12.180> those<00:01:12.330> on<00:01:12.630> yet<00:01:12.930> but<00:01:13.229> as<00:01:13.380> soon<00:01:13.409> as

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
I get that oil cooler hole is fixed that

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.679 
I get that oil cooler hole is fixed that
fitting<00:01:17.900> I<00:01:18.900> was<00:01:19.650> told<00:01:19.920> on<00:01:20.310> Yahoo<00:01:20.850> Answers<00:01:21.240> that

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
fitting I was told on Yahoo Answers that

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:22.910 
fitting I was told on Yahoo Answers that
they<00:01:21.780> sell<00:01:22.020> them<00:01:22.170> at<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.350> auto<00:01:22.500> parts<00:01:22.890> store

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
they sell them at the auto parts store

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.490 
they sell them at the auto parts store
I'll<00:01:23.880> go<00:01:24.090> to<00:01:24.180> Napa<00:01:24.450> they<00:01:24.750> got<00:01:24.900> everything<00:01:25.170> up

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
I'll go to Napa they got everything up

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.050 
I'll go to Napa they got everything up
there<00:01:25.770> but<00:01:26.100> yeah<00:01:27.290> this<00:01:28.290> is<00:01:28.530> a<00:01:28.880> one<00:01:29.880> of<00:01:30.000> the

major<00:01:30.299> things<00:01:30.720> that<00:01:30.900> I<00:01:31.079> got<00:01:31.259> done<00:01:31.470> today

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
major things that I got done today

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.469 
major things that I got done today
it's<00:01:32.430> a<00:01:32.549> little<00:01:32.820> chilly<00:01:33.060> but<00:01:33.540> not<00:01:33.750> really<00:01:34.380> bad

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
it's a little chilly but not really bad

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:38.420 
it's a little chilly but not really bad
yeah<00:01:36.479> I<00:01:37.049> just<00:01:37.290> started<00:01:37.650> up<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:37.950> engine<00:01:38.250> from

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
yeah I just started up the engine from

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.060 
yeah I just started up the engine from
like<00:01:38.579> maybe<00:01:38.729> like<00:01:39.119> a<00:01:39.420> few<00:01:39.960> seconds<00:01:40.740> and<00:01:40.860> then<00:01:40.950> I

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
like maybe like a few seconds and then I

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.950 
like maybe like a few seconds and then I
shut<00:01:41.280> it<00:01:41.340> off<00:01:41.549> and<00:01:42.000> then<00:01:42.270> there<00:01:42.450> was<00:01:42.600> just<00:01:42.630> like

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
shut it off and then there was just like

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.889 
shut it off and then there was just like
fluid<00:01:43.500> burping<00:01:43.920> out<00:01:44.070> of<00:01:44.189> that<00:01:44.280> fitting<00:01:44.899> so

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
fluid burping out of that fitting so

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.069 
fluid burping out of that fitting so
yeah<00:01:46.380> I<00:01:46.409> gotta<00:01:46.740> fix<00:01:46.979> that<00:01:47.540> and<00:01:48.540> I'm<00:01:48.750> not<00:01:48.780> too

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
yeah I gotta fix that and I'm not too

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.020 
yeah I gotta fix that and I'm not too
worried<00:01:49.380> about<00:01:49.439> that<00:01:49.619> that's<00:01:50.070> normal<00:01:50.820> I

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
worried about that that's normal I

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.850 
worried about that that's normal I
expected<00:01:51.720> that<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:51.869> happen<00:01:52.259> cuz<00:01:52.560> there<00:01:52.710> was<00:01:52.770> a

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
expected that to happen cuz there was a

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.910 
expected that to happen cuz there was a
lot<00:01:53.070> of<00:01:53.100> slack<00:01:53.549> in<00:01:53.579> that<00:01:53.970> one<00:01:54.590> leaves<00:01:55.590> a<00:01:55.649> lot<00:01:55.799> of

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
lot of slack in that one leaves a lot of

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.020 
lot of slack in that one leaves a lot of
slack<00:01:57.619> but<00:01:58.619> that<00:01:58.770> one<00:01:58.979> is<00:01:59.159> pretty<00:01:59.219> tight<00:01:59.700> you

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
slack but that one is pretty tight you

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.730 
slack but that one is pretty tight you
can<00:02:00.420> move<00:02:00.570> it<00:02:00.689> around<00:02:00.780> but<00:02:01.079> it's<00:02:01.229> pretty<00:02:01.469> tight

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
can move it around but it's pretty tight

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.219 
can move it around but it's pretty tight
so<00:02:02.130> there's<00:02:02.490> no<00:02:02.909> fluid<00:02:03.240> leakage<00:02:03.659> and<00:02:03.840> then<00:02:03.960> and

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
so there's no fluid leakage and then and

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.170 
so there's no fluid leakage and then and
that<00:02:04.409> one<00:02:04.619> either

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
that one either

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.730 
that one either
but<00:02:06.180> no<00:02:06.509> I'm<00:02:06.659> not<00:02:06.719> too<00:02:06.990> worried<00:02:07.229> about<00:02:07.290> it<00:02:07.500> I've

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
but no I'm not too worried about it I've

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.600 
but no I'm not too worried about it I've
done<00:02:07.920> that<00:02:08.310> before<00:02:08.959> yeah<00:02:10.520> yeah<00:02:11.520> I

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
done that before yeah yeah I

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:12.920 
done that before yeah yeah I
haven't<00:02:11.790> changed<00:02:12.180> the<00:02:12.270> water<00:02:12.420> pump

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
haven't changed the water pump

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.380 
haven't changed the water pump
probably
