now I tried not to touch the rotors too
much<00:00:04.020> it<00:00:04.259> was<00:00:04.380> a<00:00:04.410> pretty<00:00:04.710> clean<00:00:05.069> job<00:00:06.000> but<00:00:06.240> I

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
much it was a pretty clean job but I

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.210 
much it was a pretty clean job but I
also<00:00:06.480> like<00:00:06.720> to<00:00:06.750> take<00:00:06.870> some<00:00:07.140> brake<00:00:07.890> parts

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220

cleaner<00:00:08.660> just<00:00:09.660> make<00:00:09.840> sure<00:00:09.870> everything's

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
cleaner just make sure everything's

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
clean just make sure when you're using

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.200 
clean just make sure when you're using
this<00:00:13.019> stuff<00:00:13.380> that<00:00:13.410> you<00:00:13.920> don't<00:00:14.519> use<00:00:14.820> it<00:00:14.969> to<00:00:15.089> the

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
this stuff that you don't use it to the

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.050 
this stuff that you don't use it to the
exposed<00:00:15.870> o<00:00:16.170> rings<00:00:16.529> on<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:16.859> caliper<00:00:17.400> Pistons

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
exposed o rings on the caliper Pistons

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.929 
exposed o rings on the caliper Pistons
because<00:00:18.859> that's<00:00:19.859> probably<00:00:20.189> not<00:00:20.340> very<00:00:20.400> good

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
because that's probably not very good

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
of try to get some of the fingerprints

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.170

snug and then make sure you torque them
down<00:01:00.449> correctly<00:01:01.020> with<00:01:01.379> a<00:01:01.410> torque<00:01:02.129> wrench<00:01:02.190> and

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:03.229 
down correctly with a torque wrench and

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:05.450 
down correctly with a torque wrench and
what<00:01:04.229> I<00:01:04.260> like<00:01:04.439> to<00:01:04.589> do<00:01:04.710> is<00:01:04.860> get<00:01:05.010> them<00:01:05.129> on<00:01:05.280> here

what I like to do is get them on here
with<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.700> gun<00:01:05.909> and<00:01:06.150> then<00:01:06.840> lower<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.740> car<00:01:07.950> to

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
with the gun and then lower the car to

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.560 
with the gun and then lower the car to
the<00:01:08.340> point<00:01:08.580> where<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.820> wheel<00:01:09.000> just<00:01:09.210> barely

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
the point where the wheel just barely

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.060 
the point where the wheel just barely
touches<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.110> ground<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:10.530> it's<00:01:10.650> not<00:01:10.830> going<00:01:10.979> to

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
touches the ground and it's not going to

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.550 
touches the ground and it's not going to
move<00:01:11.250> but<00:01:12.180> it<00:01:12.299> still<00:01:12.570> doesn't<00:01:13.020> have<00:01:13.290> a<00:01:13.350> lot<00:01:13.530> of

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
move but it still doesn't have a lot of

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.770 
move but it still doesn't have a lot of
pressure<00:01:13.860> on<00:01:13.979> it<00:01:14.250> then<00:01:14.850> torque<00:01:15.180> them<00:01:15.330> down<00:01:15.360> and

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
pressure on it then torque them down and

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.469 
pressure on it then torque them down and
then<00:01:16.770> retorque<00:01:17.220> them<00:01:17.369> once<00:01:18.299> they're

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
then retorque them once they're

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.550 
then retorque them once they're
completely<00:01:18.990> on<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.259> ground<00:01:21.110> so<00:01:22.110> as<00:01:22.350> you<00:01:22.470> can

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
completely on the ground so as you can

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.160 
completely on the ground so as you can
see<00:01:22.770> i<00:01:22.799> put<00:01:23.130> my<00:01:23.369> good<00:01:24.119> old<00:01:24.330> textbook<00:01:24.960> back

see i put my good old textbook back
under<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.560> wheel<00:01:25.740> just<00:01:26.700> because<00:01:27.060> i<00:01:27.180> was<00:01:27.330> using

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
under the wheel just because i was using

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.920 
under the wheel just because i was using
my<00:01:28.290> craftsman<00:01:28.799> jack<00:01:29.329> make<00:01:30.329> sure<00:01:30.360> that<00:01:30.540> there's

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
my craftsman jack make sure that there's

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.929 
my craftsman jack make sure that there's
nothing<00:01:31.409> left<00:01:31.650> underneath<00:01:32.100> here<00:01:32.520> especially

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
the bucket that you might have used to

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.620

rest<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.210> brake<00:01:36.450> caliper<00:01:36.930> off<00:01:36.960> and<00:01:38.450> make<00:01:39.450> sure

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
rest the brake caliper off and make sure

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.960 
rest the brake caliper off and make sure
no<00:01:39.890> children<00:01:40.890> are<00:01:41.009> under<00:01:41.189> them<00:01:41.340> very<00:01:41.729> gently

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
no children are under them very gently

clean<00:02:06.230> then<00:02:06.500> I'm<00:02:07.190> going<00:02:07.340> to<00:02:07.400> pump<00:02:07.700> the<00:02:07.940> brakes

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
clean then I'm going to pump the brakes

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.860 
clean then I'm going to pump the brakes
a<00:02:08.630> few<00:02:08.810> times<00:02:09.020> and<00:02:10.360> hopefully<00:02:11.360> that<00:02:11.540> level

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
a few times and hopefully that level

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.180 
a few times and hopefully that level
will<00:02:11.990> be<00:02:12.020> pretty<00:02:12.350> close<00:02:12.590> to<00:02:12.770> where<00:02:12.860> we<00:02:12.980> want<00:02:13.160> it

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
will be pretty close to where we want it

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.860 
will be pretty close to where we want it
if<00:02:13.340> not<00:02:13.520> we<00:02:13.700> can<00:02:13.730> continue<00:02:14.270> to<00:02:14.420> siphon<00:02:14.810> a

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
if not we can continue to siphon a

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.210 
if not we can continue to siphon a
little<00:02:15.110> bit<00:02:15.260> more<00:02:15.410> out<00:02:17.620> okay<00:02:18.620> so<00:02:18.680> now<00:02:18.950> that<00:02:19.100> we

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
little bit more out okay so now that we

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.820 
little bit more out okay so now that we
have<00:02:19.250> our<00:02:19.400> cat<00:02:19.760> back<00:02:19.970> on<00:02:20.180> the<00:02:20.300> top<00:02:20.590> I'm<00:02:21.590> just

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
have our cat back on the top I'm just

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.170 
have our cat back on the top I'm just
going<00:02:22.010> to<00:02:22.040> get<00:02:22.160> in<00:02:22.310> the<00:02:22.400> car<00:02:22.640> and<00:02:24.790> I've<00:02:25.790> gotten

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
going to get in the car and I've gotten

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:27.730 
going to get in the car and I've gotten
pretty<00:02:26.210> cleaned<00:02:26.750> up<00:02:26.900> sense<00:02:27.170> which<00:02:27.590> i'd

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.740 
pretty cleaned up sense which i'd

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:28.930 
pretty cleaned up sense which i'd
recommend<00:02:28.250> so<00:02:28.400> you're<00:02:28.520> not<00:02:28.610> getting<00:02:28.850> your

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
recommend so you're not getting your

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.050 
recommend so you're not getting your
coral<00:02:29.330> dirty<00:02:29.540> and<00:02:29.810> then<00:02:30.380> just<00:02:30.790> push<00:02:31.790> on<00:02:31.940> the

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
coral dirty and then just push on the

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.160 
coral dirty and then just push on the
brake<00:02:32.240> you'll<00:02:32.450> notice<00:02:32.660> will<00:02:32.780> go<00:02:32.870> all<00:02:33.020> the<00:02:33.140> way

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
brake you'll notice will go all the way

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.410 
brake you'll notice will go all the way
to<00:02:33.290> the<00:02:33.410> floor<00:02:33.500> push<00:02:34.400> it<00:02:34.520> a<00:02:34.580> second<00:02:34.940> time<00:02:35.000> it

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
to the floor push it a second time it

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.360 
to the floor push it a second time it
gets<00:02:35.540> a<00:02:35.570> little<00:02:35.660> better<00:02:35.900> and<00:02:36.080> the<00:02:36.200> better<00:02:36.440> push

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
gets a little better and the better push

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:42.700 
gets a little better and the better push
about<00:02:37.640> maybe<00:02:38.210> five<00:02:38.480> times<00:02:38.780> or<00:02:39.050> so<00:02:40.180> and<00:02:41.710> once

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:42.710 
about maybe five times or so and once

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:46.090 
about maybe five times or so and once
it's<00:02:42.920> firmed<00:02:43.220> up<00:02:43.310> pretty<00:02:43.580> good<00:02:44.890> come<00:02:45.890> check

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
it's firmed up pretty good come check

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
it's firmed up pretty good come check
the<00:02:46.280> fluid<00:02:46.580> level<00:02:46.850> again<00:02:47.380> and<00:02:48.380> we're<00:02:48.740> actually

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
the fluid level again and we're actually

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.330 
the fluid level again and we're actually
pretty<00:02:50.120> much<00:02:50.300> right<00:02:50.570> on<00:02:50.600> the<00:02:50.750> line<00:02:50.990> so<00:02:51.470> looks

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
pretty much right on the line so looks

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.430 
pretty much right on the line so looks
like<00:02:52.400> we<00:02:52.640> siphoned<00:02:53.060> about<00:02:53.330> about<00:02:53.930> the<00:02:54.080> perfect

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
like we siphoned about about the perfect

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.920 
like we siphoned about about the perfect
amount<00:02:54.650> out<00:02:55.250> of<00:02:55.520> the<00:02:55.730> out<00:02:55.970> of<00:02:56.120> there<00:02:56.270> and

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
amount out of the out of there and

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.100 
amount out of the out of there and
remember<00:02:57.200> i<00:02:57.380> only<00:02:57.500> had<00:02:58.540> excess<00:02:59.540> in<00:02:59.810> here

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
remember i only had excess in here

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:01.930 
remember i only had excess in here
because<00:03:00.290> the<00:03:00.620> brakes<00:03:00.830> had<00:03:01.010> worn<00:03:01.250> down<00:03:01.489> to<00:03:01.850> the

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
because the brakes had worn down to the

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.229 
because the brakes had worn down to the
point<00:03:02.209> where<00:03:02.360> it<00:03:02.450> past<00:03:02.660> the<00:03:02.900> line<00:03:03.110> the

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
point where it past the line the

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:06.100 
point where it past the line the
traction<00:03:05.239> control<00:03:05.390> lights<00:03:05.780> and<00:03:06.050> everything

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
traction control lights and everything

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:08.410 
traction control lights and everything
came<00:03:06.500> on<00:03:06.739> so<00:03:06.980> I<00:03:07.040> I<00:03:07.430> knew<00:03:07.580> my<00:03:07.730> brakes<00:03:08.000> needed<00:03:08.360> to

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
came on so I I knew my brakes needed to

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.120 
came on so I I knew my brakes needed to
be<00:03:08.540> changed<00:03:08.780> and<00:03:09.050> i<00:03:09.110> just<00:03:09.290> added<00:03:09.470> it<00:03:09.709> back<00:03:09.920> to

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
be changed and i just added it back to

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:12.550 
be changed and i just added it back to
the<00:03:10.280> fill<00:03:10.520> line<00:03:10.790> and<00:03:11.360> so<00:03:11.780> i<00:03:11.810> knew<00:03:12.050> i<00:03:12.080> had<00:03:12.350> some

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
the fill line and so i knew i had some

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.740 
the fill line and so i knew i had some
extra<00:03:12.920> in<00:03:13.130> there<00:03:13.250> that<00:03:13.459> i<00:03:13.489> was<00:03:13.700> going<00:03:13.910> to<00:03:13.940> have

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
extra in there that i was going to have

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.199 
extra in there that i was going to have
to<00:03:14.959> siphon<00:03:15.320> out<00:03:15.410> eventually<00:03:15.709> but<00:03:16.190> it's<00:03:17.000> better

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.209 
to siphon out eventually but it's better

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:18.850 
to siphon out eventually but it's better
to<00:03:17.420> have<00:03:17.570> extra<00:03:17.930> in<00:03:18.170> here<00:03:18.440> because<00:03:18.560> if<00:03:18.739> the

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860 
to have extra in here because if the

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:20.770 
to have extra in here because if the
fluid<00:03:19.100> level<00:03:19.400> drops<00:03:19.610> to<00:03:19.850> loan<00:03:20.090> you<00:03:20.270> get<00:03:20.420> air<00:03:20.630> in

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
fluid level drops to loan you get air in

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.300 
fluid level drops to loan you get air in
the<00:03:20.930> system<00:03:21.110> and<00:03:21.440> you're<00:03:21.560> pumping<00:03:21.890> air<00:03:22.070> then

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
the system and you're pumping air then

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:23.940 
the system and you're pumping air then
you're<00:03:22.459> going<00:03:22.550> to<00:03:22.640> need<00:03:22.820> to<00:03:22.910> bleed<00:03:23.390> the<00:03:23.540> brakes

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
you're going to need to bleed the brakes

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.340 
you're going to need to bleed the brakes
but<00:03:24.950> just<00:03:25.430> make<00:03:25.580> sure<00:03:25.610> that<00:03:25.880> you're<00:03:26.000> on<00:03:26.120> your

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.350 
but just make sure that you're on your

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:29.790 
but just make sure that you're on your
your<00:03:27.350> max<00:03:27.590> level<00:03:27.890> when<00:03:28.130> you're<00:03:28.160> done<00:03:28.489> and

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:29.800 
your max level when you're done and

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.430 
your max level when you're done and
that's<00:03:31.270> pretty<00:03:32.270> much<00:03:32.450> it<00:03:32.600> for<00:03:32.840> now<00:03:33.140> on<00:03:33.290> the

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 
that's pretty much it for now on the

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.520 
that's pretty much it for now on the
front<00:03:33.709> so<00:03:33.860> i'm<00:03:33.950> going<00:03:34.040> to<00:03:34.160> do<00:03:34.489> the<00:03:34.610> rears<00:03:35.180> and

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
front so i'm going to do the rears and

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.600 
front so i'm going to do the rears and
hopefully<00:03:36.530> i'll<00:03:36.620> do<00:03:36.739> a<00:03:36.769> video<00:03:36.950> for<00:03:37.250> that<00:03:37.400> if

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:37.610 
hopefully i'll do a video for that if

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:40.000 
hopefully i'll do a video for that if
it's<00:03:37.760> any<00:03:37.910> good
