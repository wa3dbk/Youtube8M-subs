00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.420
 more than the internet, you have to give them 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.820

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:56.500
 surprised 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:00.130
 I will continue to teach you more material 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.720
 in news the stagnant vision that 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.350
 it's a latin channel you can see there 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.420
 novels 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:08.840
 there are more 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:13.230
 there are some that are live 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:16.200
 to these that are saved contents 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.519
 it's a streaming but we've had a 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.920
 little of problems with controlling what 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:21.989
 it may seem that lately the 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.849
 new firmware has been giving quite 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:24.989
 problems but you can despite 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:26.909
 contents 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:29.610
 we recommend you look for this channel 

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:31.920
 it has very good content I make them a 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.269
 7-day free trial period 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.739
 nothing else they have to activate the 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:35.670
 computer and it's very important that you do not 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:36.930
 forget that you have to activate the 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.000
 following our indications of 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.640
 our website was scripted 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.049
 rock must type freely because if not 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.310
 they are not going to be able to enjoy this 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:46.860
 channel 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.019
 I think the monthly payment is 20 dollars 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.220
 by account and in addition to that which is 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:54.269
 important you can add the 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:56.280
 package hb or what is the channel 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:58.810
 Slim TV when you add it more to 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:03.140
 can see all the series 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:05.269
 we had commented on what it is I see 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:08.829
 how good in the trial period is not 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:14.329
 but it is included, so the 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:16.040
 family adding more channels or packages 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:17.379
 that have an additional cost so already 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.230
