00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.640
 Hi there, you are watching a video on the channel 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:08.389
 varus my name is Stepan 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.920
 today decided to take his lunch and 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:13.709
 more accurately change the bearings in the front 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.980
 the wheel because in general it is necessary 

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:15.980
 see 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:29.460
 light rustle of the body of Odessa 

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:36.280
 everything else is a crash this bearing 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:38.860
 or rather the bearings in the room launching 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:41.440
 shaggy's bearings didn't change it 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.820
 although it was worth doing right away but this 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:47.519
 the operation is not complicated so now 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:50.140
 let's get down very much I took off the front wheel 

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:52.510
 processes show we are busy you miss 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:56.469
 wheel nut down fall in old 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:59.229
 bearings on the left and in between the sleeve 

00:00:56.469 --> 00:01:01.000
 which actually prevents one from drinking 

00:00:59.229 --> 00:01:06.600
 the bearings were today can kill 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.600
 immediately remembered 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:19.600
 . here he began to burn already 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.710
 a little more 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:39.640
 well who 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.640
 no bearing at all just cosmically 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:47.050
 three just a lot 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.050
 lots of grease 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:54.050
 the authors fix it all easier 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.940
 here it is what's the trouble 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:18.050
 a little bit he is 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:22.390
 not a single inscription 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.390
 I bought a pop such here 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.879
 they are deshmansky 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:32.329
 30 got two bearings 600 rubles 

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:34.840
 that is, 300 rubles a little thing but on them 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:36.829
 there are even inscriptions unlike those 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.870
 The problem is the same here as it is impossible 

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:40.280
 just use spacers instead of spacers 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.629
 old bearing 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.870
 because of the seats is very 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:47.989
 long and he will score on top 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:51.370
 itâ€™s like nothing for us therefore 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:51.370
 MSU will have to find this golovochku 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:55.599
 small 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.490
 skin more bearing 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:04.900
 very found 

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:14.300
 now heard only 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:16.750
 shuffling is this important for the disc 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.750
 pads 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:25.940
 subscribe to the channel put likes 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:28.940
 bye everyone 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:28.940
 pants 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:42.120
 just shook they also merge new 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:42.120
 although in one place I do not understand 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:47.880
 superfluous principle because when you are without 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:47.880
 perhaps
