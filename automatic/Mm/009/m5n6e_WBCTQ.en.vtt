25<00:01:04.289> years<00:01:04.470> I<00:01:04.920> think<00:01:05.039> is<00:01:05.250> a<00:01:05.280> guarantee<00:01:05.759> or

00:01:05.779 --> 00:01:05.789 
25 years I think is a guarantee or

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:07.999 
25 years I think is a guarantee or
something<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:07.080> garden<00:01:07.470> check<00:01:07.680> out<00:01:07.830> what's

on<00:03:12.670> the<00:03:13.060> watch<00:03:13.269> I<00:03:13.769> show<00:03:14.769> you<00:03:14.799> the<00:03:14.920> watch<00:03:15.069> itself

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
on the watch I show you the watch itself

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.039 
on the watch I show you the watch itself
this<00:03:15.639> one<00:03:15.849> hasn't<00:03:16.060> got<00:03:16.269> a<00:03:16.299> karna<00:03:16.690> graphene

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:17.049 
this one hasn't got a karna graphene

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:19.830 
this one hasn't got a karna graphene
it's<00:03:17.829> just<00:03:18.040> the<00:03:18.190> Doyles<00:03:18.579> all<00:03:19.239> the<00:03:19.389> numbers<00:03:19.720> are

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
it's just the Doyles all the numbers are

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.520 
it's just the Doyles all the numbers are
black<00:03:20.049> and<00:03:20.379> there's<00:03:20.590> the<00:03:20.799> light<00:03:20.980> tubes<00:03:22.530> right

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
black and there's the light tubes right

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.649 
black and there's the light tubes right
then<00:03:24.159> I've<00:03:24.280> heard<00:03:24.459> Wendy's<00:03:24.819> glow<00:03:25.090> that<00:03:25.299> that

00:03:25.649 --> 00:03:25.659 
then I've heard Wendy's glow that that

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:27.539 
then I've heard Wendy's glow that that
glow<00:03:25.870> pretty<00:03:26.139> bright<00:03:26.470> I<00:03:26.769> mean<00:03:27.250> they've<00:03:27.370> got<00:03:27.400> a

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:27.549 
glow pretty bright I mean they've got a

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:31.920 
glow pretty bright I mean they've got a
25<00:03:28.150> year<00:03:28.450> guarantee<00:03:28.870> on<00:03:29.639> also<00:03:30.639> this<00:03:30.879> the<00:03:31.480> bezel

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
25 year guarantee on also this the bezel

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:37.199 
25 year guarantee on also this the bezel
will<00:03:32.829> only<00:03:33.040> turn<00:03:33.489> anti-clockwise<00:03:35.519> and<00:03:36.519> the

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
will only turn anti-clockwise and the

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:39.379 
will only turn anti-clockwise and the
reason<00:03:37.540> for<00:03:37.660> that<00:03:37.720> is<00:03:37.989> if<00:03:38.410> you<00:03:38.650> as<00:03:38.799> an<00:03:38.919> American

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:39.389 
reason for that is if you as an American

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:43.199 
reason for that is if you as an American
Navy<00:03:40.389> SEAL<00:03:40.599> diver<00:03:41.310> and<00:03:42.310> you<00:03:42.459> went<00:03:42.639> to<00:03:42.669> time<00:03:42.940> how

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:43.209 
Navy SEAL diver and you went to time how

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:45.449 
Navy SEAL diver and you went to time how
long<00:03:43.269> I<00:03:43.480> mean<00:03:43.810> it<00:03:43.930> was<00:03:44.109> for<00:03:44.769> your<00:03:44.919> air<00:03:45.099> tank

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
long I mean it was for your air tank

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:49.020 
long I mean it was for your air tank
over<00:03:46.120> intake<00:03:46.660> of<00:03:46.870> it<00:03:47.049> then<00:03:47.949> that's<00:03:48.609> how<00:03:48.849> long

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
over intake of it then that's how long

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.000 
over intake of it then that's how long
it<00:03:49.180> would<00:03:49.269> be<00:03:49.329> and<00:03:50.230> the<00:03:50.379> reason<00:03:50.500> it<00:03:50.709> doesn't<00:03:50.829> go

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
it would be and the reason it doesn't go

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:52.530 
it would be and the reason it doesn't go
this<00:03:51.160> way<00:03:51.370> so<00:03:51.430> it<00:03:51.730> doesn't<00:03:51.760> knock<00:03:52.150> it<00:03:52.359> and

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
this way so it doesn't knock it and

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.349 
this way so it doesn't knock it and
basically<00:03:53.340> doesn't<00:03:54.340> potentially<00:03:54.970> harm<00:03:55.180> the

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:55.359 
basically doesn't potentially harm the

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:58.470 
basically doesn't potentially harm the
diver<00:03:55.599> it<00:03:56.319> can<00:03:56.500> only<00:03:56.650> go<00:03:57.280> anti-clockwise<00:03:57.730> by

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
diver it can only go anti-clockwise by

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.409 
diver it can only go anti-clockwise by
accident<00:03:59.049> really<00:03:59.230> if<00:03:59.889> it<00:04:00.459> does<00:04:00.669> then<00:04:01.120> he's

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:01.419 
accident really if it does then he's

00:04:01.419 --> 00:04:03.270 
accident really if it does then he's
fine<00:04:01.720> it<00:04:01.930> just<00:04:01.959> shows<00:04:02.349> that<00:04:02.379> there's<00:04:02.739> less<00:04:02.919> air

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
fine it just shows that there's less air

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.640 
fine it just shows that there's less air
intake<00:04:03.760> so<00:04:04.449> the<00:04:04.540> doctor<00:04:04.840> can<00:04:04.959> get<00:04:05.199> up<00:04:05.349> to<00:04:05.379> the

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
intake so the doctor can get up to the

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.930 
intake so the doctor can get up to the
surface<00:04:05.859> quicker<00:04:06.459> rather<00:04:06.790> than<00:04:07.000> later<00:04:07.239> right

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
surface quicker rather than later right

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.490 
surface quicker rather than later right
as<00:04:09.940> you<00:04:10.060> can<00:04:10.209> see<00:04:10.389> there<00:04:10.599> on<00:04:10.780> the<00:04:10.870> strap<00:04:11.169> metal

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500 
as you can see there on the strap metal

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.559 
as you can see there on the strap metal

00:04:13.559 --> 00:04:13.569 
bit there's also a Luminox Luminox badge

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:16.800 
bit there's also a Luminox Luminox badge

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519 
just these little two triangle bitch to

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:21.089 
just these little two triangle bitch to
hold<00:04:18.699> this<00:04:18.849> here<00:04:19.440> very<00:04:20.440> very<00:04:20.500> detail

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 
it's also got the date on I mean is it's

very<00:04:29.289> durable<00:04:29.650> very<00:04:30.159> long<00:04:31.060> I've<00:04:31.240> got<00:04:31.389> a<00:04:31.419> size

00:04:31.649 --> 00:04:31.659 
very durable very long I've got a size

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:34.520 
very durable very long I've got a size
one<00:04:31.870> little<00:04:32.110> Augie<00:04:32.199> swatches<00:04:32.740> I've<00:04:32.860> ever<00:04:32.979> seen

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
one little Augie swatches I've ever seen

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:39.610 
one little Augie swatches I've ever seen
it's<00:04:35.530> also<00:04:35.680> carbon<00:04:36.460> ream<00:04:37.030> for<00:04:37.860> you

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:39.620 
it's also carbon ream for you

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:42.460 
it's also carbon ream for you
which<00:04:39.710> is<00:04:39.800> the<00:04:39.949> plastic<00:04:40.190> around<00:04:40.790> here<00:04:41.199> so<00:04:42.199> yeah

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:42.470 
which is the plastic around here so yeah

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:44.310 
which is the plastic around here so yeah
that<00:04:42.650> I<00:04:42.680> think<00:04:42.979> that's<00:04:43.100> why<00:04:43.370> it's<00:04:43.520> so<00:04:43.580> light

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:44.320 
that I think that's why it's so light

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.050 
that I think that's why it's so light
but<00:04:45.320> it's<00:04:45.440> also<00:04:45.590> got<00:04:46.040> a<00:04:46.070> scratch<00:04:46.400> resistant

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.060 
but it's also got a scratch resistant

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:50.230 
but it's also got a scratch resistant
mineral<00:04:47.570> crystal<00:04:48.199> on<00:04:48.620> the<00:04:49.310> front<00:04:49.699> face<00:04:49.940> of<00:04:50.150> the

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:50.240 
mineral crystal on the front face of the

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.050 
mineral crystal on the front face of the
watch<00:04:50.389> so<00:04:50.780> as<00:04:50.840> you<00:04:50.930> can<00:04:51.050> see<00:04:51.110> I<00:04:51.320> don't<00:04:51.560> think

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.060 
watch so as you can see I don't think

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.159 
watch so as you can see I don't think
don't<00:04:53.060> think<00:04:53.120> you<00:04:53.270> get<00:04:53.419> any<00:04:53.570> scratches<00:04:53.840> on

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:54.169 
don't think you get any scratches on

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:57.610 
don't think you get any scratches on
there<00:04:54.320> in<00:04:54.440> the<00:04:54.530> eye<00:04:54.910> and<00:04:55.910> also<00:04:56.479> the<00:04:57.199> trinium

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:57.620 
there in the eye and also the trinium

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.000 
there in the eye and also the trinium
light<00:04:57.860> tubes<00:04:58.220> inside<00:04:58.669> they<00:05:00.010> illuminate

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:01.010 
light tubes inside they illuminate

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:03.790 
light tubes inside they illuminate
themselves<00:05:01.820> and<00:05:02.060> they<00:05:02.870> don't<00:05:02.990> use<00:05:03.229> any<00:05:03.500> of<00:05:03.650> the

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:03.800 
themselves and they don't use any of the

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.320 
themselves and they don't use any of the
battery<00:05:04.070> power<00:05:04.310> or<00:05:04.610> they<00:05:04.850> don't<00:05:04.970> require<00:05:05.240> any

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:05.330 
battery power or they don't require any
