00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:09.000
 hello one more spontaneous such 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:12.090
 video about my favorite knife which 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.460
 for some reason almost half a year already 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:19.080
 wants to leave his pocket he's all 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:21.810
 time walks with me everywhere here and why 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.550
 so as it turns out that the other us 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.680
 and which I buy some time I 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.880
 found then still starting to wear 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:32.869
 again this knife and such ordinary legs 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.869
 ganzo 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:49.860
 Hansa modelc g700 8 that's what he told me 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:53.730
 like vodka it would seem I actually 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:56.000
 I donâ€™t know who will tell me what 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.980
 he is 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.520
 This is the bottom development nig factory 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:07.979
 for anyone from somewhere I copied 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:09.890
 I know how to honestly admit 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.790
 First of all 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:15.950
 thanks to this here 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:19.640
 the hole can be made very cool 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:23.280
 for the year to turn karate nothing to do 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.720
 birch on the finger and twist the most useful 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.750
 the function of this knife 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:31.680
 just kidding thanks to this hole 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:35.280
 you can always without error 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:39.329
 determine its position in your pocket 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.460
 I do not wear our music in my pocket 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:45.000
 clip 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:48.960
 here and when so here you can pocket 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:52.920
 and you can immediately determine that is, where 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:55.259
 there is no hole here it means it is not here 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.899
 she is that is like he is there 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:02.490
 twisted immediately clearly understand here 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:04.829
 hole peg this well somehow very 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.800
 convenient i don't know if k this situation then 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:10.530
 you can get a knife there like something else 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:13.590
 1 and this one is just right in your pocket there 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:18.440
 you can flip as you wish 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:24.540
 and deliver this first thing I like 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:25.800
 second this knife is missing this 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.600
 bolt or screw 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:32.040
 how to say that fastens 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:34.640
 blade handle them ie instead 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:42.000
 here are two pucks 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:44.510
 who spin to sleep his hand they 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.310
 rotate on the thread 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.560
 that is, it has never been 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.900
 I got out of my pocket somewhere 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.700
 or account to get lost from the beginning 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.860
 wanted on some kind of thread lock them 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.960
 put in that changed my mind changed my mind 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:02.310
 what reason is it really 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:07.800
 with her fingers you can let them go a little 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:10.530
 from the blade becomes very easy as well 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.700
 the most can be right here with one hand it 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:16.080
 pull a little 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:21.080
 and already under the blade becomes quite 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:26.220
 to others if there is a leg on both sides 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:29.459
 preload it already so you can not throw one 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:31.920
 hand that is to regulate 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:36.750
 without any screwdrivers there 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:41.130
 just let go a little bit all 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:43.050
 pursed again you can disassemble without 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:47.430
 some extra tools 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:54.260
 just pulled the blade out with his hands 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:57.660
 took off the square here the blade took off 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:04:00.270
 washed brushed back it's all spun 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:03.090
 very comfortable note sat and 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:04.850
 one hand just 2 hold the phone with 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:08.909
 camera 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:13.000
 that is, like 

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:16.060
 Well, do not really like what you see 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:21.100
 so that's going through it 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:24.310
 installation as it is very easy to clean on 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:29.229
 something to the bottom is streaked so forth and 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:32.500
 that sort of thing is just like me 

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:36.610
 seems like a drawback for a city knife 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:39.880
 this blade thickness is not needed by the city 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:42.250
 here is such a blade because when you 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:46.000
 cut out and some kind of cucumber 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:48.550
 when you cut it the blade cuts it 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.840
 now the thickness I just breaks further 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.240
 when will you lose 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:58.210
 so if he was just that it was 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:05:04.570
 Only only plus would be well here again 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:07.110
 again, again on the issue of price 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:13.479
 there is it quite inexpensive 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:16.229
 so much 440c which is enough here 

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:17.949
 a knife on my pocket every day 

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:20.789
 thank you all very much 

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:20.789
 until
