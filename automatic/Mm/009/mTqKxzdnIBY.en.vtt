00:05:32.779 --> 00:05:32.789 
and maybe that's what prompted the rep

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:34.760 
and maybe that's what prompted the rep
to<00:05:32.910> say<00:05:33.060> hey<00:05:33.240> wait<00:05:33.599> if<00:05:33.900> he<00:05:34.020> goes<00:05:34.229> down<00:05:34.259> on<00:05:34.590> that
