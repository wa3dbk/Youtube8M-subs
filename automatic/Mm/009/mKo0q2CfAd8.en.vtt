00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:19.520 
if we take my edges like this and now

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.859 
if we take my edges like this and now
pop<00:00:20.520> them<00:00:21.300> as<00:00:21.650> we're<00:00:22.650> making<00:00:23.600> it's<00:00:24.600> not<00:00:24.840> a

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
pop them as we're making it's not a

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:33.080 
pop them as we're making it's not a
sleepy<00:00:25.460> hearing<00:00:27.529> so<00:00:30.439> the<00:00:31.439> lid<00:00:31.619> that<00:00:32.610> you<00:00:32.759> have

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
sleepy hearing so the lid that you have

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.780 
sleepy hearing so the lid that you have
should<00:00:33.690> be<00:00:33.719> big<00:00:34.290> enough<00:00:34.440> to<00:00:34.649> fit<00:00:35.070> a<00:00:35.489> door

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
should be big enough to fit a door

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.220 
should be big enough to fit a door
handle<00:00:36.559> so<00:00:37.559> we're<00:00:38.370> going<00:00:38.550> to<00:00:38.670> do<00:00:38.879> only<00:00:39.390> around

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
handle so we're going to do only around

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.520 
handle so we're going to do only around
on<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.649> buffing<00:00:41.070> this<00:00:41.309> and<00:00:42.149> and<00:00:43.160> the<00:00:44.210> circle

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 
on the buffing this and and the circle

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.180 
on the buffing this and and the circle
thing<00:00:46.530> goes<00:00:47.280> into<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.450> loop<00:00:48.890> like<00:00:49.890> this<00:00:49.920> and

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
thing goes into the loop like this and

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.700 
thing goes into the loop like this and
now<00:00:50.879> play<00:00:51.870> so<00:00:52.230> you'll<00:00:52.379> have<00:00:52.590> any<00:00:52.920> like<00:00:53.850> this

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:54.710 
now play so you'll have any like this

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.869 
now play so you'll have any like this
which<00:00:55.710> is<00:00:55.920> big<00:00:56.100> enough<00:00:56.309> to<00:00:56.370> fit<00:00:56.670> a<00:00:56.699> door<00:00:57.000> handle

00:00:58.869 --> 00:00:58.879 
which is big enough to fit a door handle

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:09.370 
which is big enough to fit a door handle
now<00:00:59.879> kind<00:01:00.510> of<00:01:00.600> her<00:01:03.589> everything<00:01:06.350> opposite<00:01:08.180> so

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
now kind of her everything opposite so

in the big opposite so we're gonna start
with<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.110> pin<00:01:19.409> and<00:01:21.979> the<00:01:22.979> pin<00:01:23.009> is<00:01:23.820> going<00:01:24.479> to<00:01:24.720> go

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
with the pin and the pin is going to go

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:31.960 
with the pin and the pin is going to go
over<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.650> right<00:01:25.830> hand<00:01:26.130> side<00:01:26.400> petal<00:01:29.360> like<00:01:30.950> this

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
over the right hand side petal like this

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:37.069 
over the right hand side petal like this
now<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.030> powerful<00:01:35.119> then<00:01:36.119> you<00:01:36.270> put<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.689> peanut

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
like this now the other piece goes over

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.899 
like this now the other piece goes over
the<00:01:46.590> last<00:01:47.509> purple<00:01:48.509> and<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.530> last<00:01:49.710> papal<00:01:50.220> goes

right this okay I squeeze dogs as we
started<00:02:19.500> last<00:02:19.910> slide<00:02:20.910> not<00:02:21.600> strongly<00:02:21.959> with<00:02:22.320> the

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
started last slide not strongly with the

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.090 
started last slide not strongly with the
pink<00:02:23.870> we're<00:02:24.870> gonna<00:02:25.050> start<00:02:25.350> with<00:02:25.440> the<00:02:25.530> family

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
pink we're gonna start with the family

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
pink leap these over the other powerful

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:35.949 
pink leap these over the other powerful
blue

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:35.959 
blue

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:38.750 
blue
now<00:02:36.959> the<00:02:37.020> pebble<00:02:37.440> loop<00:02:37.620> because<00:02:38.130> it's<00:02:38.400> pink

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
now the pebble loop because it's pink

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.910 
now the pebble loop because it's pink
and<00:02:39.720> the<00:02:40.140> pink<00:02:40.500> goes<00:02:41.340> into<00:02:42.120> the<00:02:42.959> first<00:02:43.410> pepper

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
and the pink goes into the first pepper

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:53.270 
and the pink goes into the first pepper
wave<00:02:44.310> and<00:02:44.970> then<00:02:47.450> we<00:02:48.450> oh<00:02:51.620> you<00:02:52.620> can<00:02:52.800> bet<00:02:52.950> it<00:02:53.100> one

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
wave and then we oh you can bet it one

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:58.540 
wave and then we oh you can bet it one
by<00:02:53.520> one<00:02:53.760> or<00:02:54.000> you<00:02:54.030> can<00:02:54.390> pull<00:02:54.540> it<00:02:54.660> all<00:02:54.900> together

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.550 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:08.390 

like<00:02:59.550> this<00:03:01.640> then<00:03:02.640> you<00:03:02.790> carry<00:03:03.180> on<00:03:03.830> with<00:03:07.400> the

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
like this then you carry on with the

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.740 
like this then you carry on with the
pink<00:03:09.360> and<00:03:09.660> then<00:03:10.440> pink<00:03:11.280> starts<00:03:12.000> and<00:03:12.239> then<00:03:12.510> the

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
pink and then pink starts and then the

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.530 
pink and then pink starts and then the
puppy<00:03:13.019> starts<00:03:13.590> and<00:03:13.799> then<00:03:13.920> pink<00:03:14.250> repelled<00:03:14.910> so

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
puppy starts and then pink repelled so

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.460 
puppy starts and then pink repelled so
guys<00:03:15.810> like<00:03:16.170> a<00:03:16.470> pattern<00:03:17.390> then<00:03:18.390> when<00:03:18.750> you

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
guys like a pattern then when you

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:25.430 
guys like a pattern then when you
finished<00:03:20.900> the<00:03:21.900> sample<00:03:23.900> it<00:03:24.900> looks<00:03:25.170> something

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
finished the sample it looks something

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:31.789 
finished the sample it looks something
like<00:03:26.299> this<00:03:28.250> with<00:03:29.250> and<00:03:29.900> as<00:03:30.900> you<00:03:31.170> can<00:03:31.350> see<00:03:31.410> I've

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
like this with and as you can see I've

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:36.710 
like this with and as you can see I've
done<00:03:32.010> a<00:03:32.040> little<00:03:33.620> loop<00:03:34.620> at<00:03:35.579> the<00:03:35.910> end<00:03:36.209> it<00:03:36.480> says

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
done a little loop at the end it says

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.069 
done a little loop at the end it says
big<00:03:37.049> enough<00:03:37.320> to<00:03:37.709> pick<00:03:37.920> a<00:03:38.190> door<00:03:38.489> handle<00:03:39.030> bye<00:03:40.019> see

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:40.079 
big enough to pick a door handle bye see

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:43.310 
big enough to pick a door handle bye see
you<00:03:40.739> next<00:03:40.769> time
