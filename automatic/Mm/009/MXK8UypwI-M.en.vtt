00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.440
 Gunpla Kit Review of Mobile Suit Gundam Gundam Model Collection Deluxe 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:12.120
 Mass production type Gergug 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:13.290
 Gunpla Collection Deluxe is for ladies and gentlemen, who were released for 400 yen in 2007 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.910
 It is a gunpla of 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.570
 The package and features of the Mobile Suit Gundam old kit released at the time of the gun plastic boom 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.810
 Leave 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:27.890
 This is a plastic model series reproduced in half size of 1/144 scale . 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:29.240
 Lineup, such as MSN-02 ZEONG and Zokku is larger in size than vol 1 vol 2 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.270
 Target for cancer 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:35.660
 By'm the size of the box is the size of half of the old kit 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:36.960
 If you collect the kit box, you can create a diorama of the Gunpla sales department. 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:41.309
 Hey there is no path 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:45.059
 I feel like I'm looking forward to Morinaga chocolate snacks rather than gunpla 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:49.110
 Nowadays it is surely also earnestly marked with Premier by Te those days Norma 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:54.180
 Although it is an acoustic product of the blind specification, it is an old modeler who experienced the gun plastic boom 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.750
 Taken'm looks likely release was a very happy surprise at this price Nairn 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.980
 Noodle 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:01.210
 Young people who have not experienced the gun plastic boom 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:02.050
 It is a mountain of Seki which can not keep up with the mysterious design of the old mobile suit 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.909
 I will 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:10.710
 Since the goodness of the kit is not known to Oko like Arinsuyo 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:14.969
 The pell tool is a high-performance mobile suit developed by the Zeon Army at the end of the yearly war 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:20.609
 Implements the first portable beam rifle and beam saber in the Zeon mobile suit 

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:21.929
 It is also said that its performance is comparable to the Earth Federation Army rx series in 

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:25.900
 If it is earlier 

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:26.440
 I excellent airframe enough is said to Zeon might be or not to win 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:31.180
 Oh you the crust the crust the crust 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:34.000
 It looks like this from the perspective of the Commonwealth Army, who is the victor . 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:37.030
 If you explain from the viewpoint from the losing Zeon side 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:41.800
 Initially Saishi independently war Zeon has caused 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:46.180
 The Earth Federation Forces, which had been outnumbered for the Zeon Mobile Suit, mass produced Earth Federation System 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.430
 We mass-produced the type mobile suit and made a big offensive . 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.240
 number 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:55.160
 If it is weak to the state federal army , it will become clearly lack of power 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:59.140
 Zion forces develop a new flagship mobile suit to compete with the mobile suit's performance here 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.140
 Is why standing is promoting at a rapid pace the 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:06.600
 Development progressed slowly and was remodeled for ground dom large pillars and as a temporary main mobile suit 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:11.880
 How to use 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:13.170
 When the Mobile Suit Gerugg with the expected performance is finally completed , the defeat is almost complete 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.550
 I was never there 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.930
 Chan 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:22.080
 The end of the show was decided and there was no end of the show 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:25.950
 I did not Nante mobile suit of turn not entangled in the story 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.580
 I such want to suspicious have been the final mobile suits if there is no truncation to say whether 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:31.260
 Ne 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:34.540
 The end of the Gundam was just a scene of good weather that was exploding 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:38.710
 The cut of the suit itself is too small and the budget and time are not enough 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:43.360
 Hey I had been down is 彦先students who were not thin be 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:46.600
 Say Toka was riding a boy soldiers shop Shinpe of those not only a Choi is in the play 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:50.950
 Japanese people born in Showa have settings that they like more than rice 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:52.090
 I've loved the old man I like the tragic battle of the scene of the Toka Byakkotai whether Zero Fighter 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:57.160
 I airframe 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:03:01.480
 Since full-scale activity is entrusted to subsequent Zeon remnant forces 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:02.110
 Speaking of mass production type Gergug kit, it was a difficult kit to obtain at the time of gun plastic boom 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.680
 The 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:09.580
 There were a lot of people who had not seen the main anime at that time, so it was natural 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:11.440
 I'm a not choose to surely look at the package it looks like narrowing shaving and of some of the eyes 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:16.960
 I hope you like beer 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:17.150
 The track was cool and it was popular, so it was because of the characteristic shield 

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:20.569
 Ah 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:25.670
 I was reminded of the tribe of liquors 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:27.049
 Although Gunpla is not good enough for all products, mass production type mobile suits are popular anyway 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:31.730
 Challenge that there is 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:37.099
 If you like the mobile suit of the Zeon army, it's a rush to get around, but at that time 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:39.240
 Even if the shoulder armor did not move, the torso was easy to come off, and there were many troubled difficult kits. 

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:43.650
 That's right 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:48.750
 The Gunpla Collection version Gerugugu is a masterpiece that reproduces its flaws 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:49.980
 I reproduce the proportions of the old kit street with the latest technology of Ulsan at that time 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:54.180
 There is 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:57.450
 Nopperi was not to move begins to detail or Tama off easy body 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:59.260
 Mounting position is fleeing, such as such as something funny shield 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:03.640
 That's right I did not like this 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:04.900
 What's a lot of points that evoke memories of the times of the gun plastic boom 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:06.340
 It's a kit so 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.760
 Panaine 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:13.420
 Dare dare do so to the shoulder joint is a ball joint 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:18.310
 Integral molding of the shoulder armor and the back mud to kill moving parts 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:21.340
 Speaking of the biggest feature of the old kit Peg It is out of place and how good or unusual features stand out 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:25.870
 I'm letting me go 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:31.330
 This is an essential element in correctly reproducing the old kit gel gug. 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:32.620
 Even if you think about it, it's so easy for you to reproduce the movable shape as you set it. 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:37.510
 Healed 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:41.950
 Morinaga person and was a chocolate snack of bonus surely is there than was running 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:46.490
 What is the feeling of cheap of Mr. Gerugug 's 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:51.590
 This cheap feeling has been bought with force but what is it? 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:52.370
 Painful and I am an essential element in recalling the memories of those days when I was overwhelmed 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:57.229
 Follow 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:58.520
 Trauma at that time The difference is the acoustical sound that Enoyama worked to remind us 

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:02.150
 I'm sorry so I will 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:06.510
 This is exactly what the old kit Gergug's trauma is still 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:09.009
 Positive as a point to reaffirm the fact that it is deeply inscribed in the mind of the modeler 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:15.969
 Selection of the Daaa 

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:18.129
 To fish sake, so in Nante evil ways likely to be what about I'm all Shu-kun crackling to recover the disadvantage 

00:05:15.969 --> 00:05:21.550
 It is the correct usage to do 

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:27.950
 The divorced woman modeler I really'll you about this kit is just good 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:31.390
 It is surprisingly difficult to obtain these days, so if you buy it as a set, it may get cheaper. 

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:31.390
 Hey do not really apparent in the belly
