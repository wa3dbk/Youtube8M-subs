smash<00:04:25.810> bros<00:04:26.110> I<00:04:26.380> mean<00:04:26.560> I<00:04:26.710> think<00:04:26.949> if<00:04:27.340> you<00:04:27.430> look<00:04:27.580> at

00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:27.729 
smash bros I mean I think if you look at

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:30.420 
smash bros I mean I think if you look at
characters<00:04:28.360> like<00:04:28.630> zero<00:04:29.139> suit<00:04:29.440> samus<00:04:29.740> you<00:04:30.280> can

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:30.430 
characters like zero suit samus you can

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:31.560 
characters like zero suit samus you can
look<00:04:30.580> at<00:04:30.699> something<00:04:30.789> like<00:04:30.970> that<00:04:31.270> that<00:04:31.300> would

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:31.570 
look at something like that that would

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:33.960 
look at something like that that would
be<00:04:31.599> similar<00:04:32.440> not<00:04:32.919> just<00:04:33.099> because<00:04:33.250> of<00:04:33.370> aesthetic

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970 
be similar not just because of aesthetic

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:35.550 
be similar not just because of aesthetic
just<00:04:34.150> because<00:04:34.449> of<00:04:34.599> the<00:04:34.750> you<00:04:35.199> know<00:04:35.320> the<00:04:35.440> way

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
just because of the you know the way

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.350 
just because of the you know the way
they<00:04:35.710> move<00:04:36.039> their<00:04:36.400> body<00:04:36.610> structure<00:04:37.060> temper

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 
they move their body structure temper

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.019 
they move their body structure temper
that<00:04:37.510> so<00:04:37.810> if<00:04:38.229> they<00:04:38.440> put<00:04:38.710> Bayonetta<00:04:39.250> in<00:04:39.490> super

00:04:40.019 --> 00:04:40.029 
that so if they put Bayonetta in super

00:04:40.029 --> 00:04:41.119 
that so if they put Bayonetta in super
