00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.510 

all<00:00:14.410> right<00:00:14.530> so<00:00:14.650> what's<00:00:14.830> the<00:00:14.950> tool<00:00:15.130> we<00:00:15.250> have<00:00:15.280> in

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:15.520 
all right so what's the tool we have in

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:26.950 
all right so what's the tool we have in
there<00:00:15.670> right<00:00:15.760> now<00:00:15.820> this<00:00:16.660> is<00:00:16.900> a<00:00:19.260> wmg<00:00:20.279> skin<00:00:21.279> sir

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:26.960 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.550 

the<00:00:27.260> negative<00:00:27.800> rate<00:00:28.070> tool

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.799 

there's<00:00:31.830> six<00:00:32.220> usable

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
there's six usable

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.090 
there's six usable
Edge's<00:00:34.710> for<00:00:35.370> each<00:00:35.550> answer

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:37.100 
Edge's for each answer

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.400 
Edge's for each answer
triangular<00:00:38.060> sheet<00:00:38.360> you<00:00:38.720> can<00:00:38.870> flip<00:00:39.170> it<00:00:39.320> over

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410 
triangular sheet you can flip it over

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.770 
triangular sheet you can flip it over
and<00:00:39.620> use<00:00:39.860> the<00:00:40.010> other<00:00:40.040> side

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:43.780 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:49.270 

so<00:00:44.170> this<00:00:44.560> is<00:00:44.770> a<00:00:45.540> 12/14<00:00:46.540> let<00:00:47.230> it<00:00:47.410> steal

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280 
so this is a 12/14 let it steal

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.910 
so this is a 12/14 let it steal
the<00:00:50.120> surface<00:00:50.570> finish<00:00:50.990> that<00:00:51.260> you<00:00:51.410> get<00:00:51.650> here

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
the surface finish that you get here

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.340 
the surface finish that you get here
doesn't<00:00:52.310> look<00:00:52.460> too<00:00:52.700> bad<00:00:52.940> especially<00:00:53.600> if<00:00:54.230> you

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
doesn't look too bad especially if you

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.630 
doesn't look too bad especially if you
compared<00:00:54.800> it<00:00:54.980> against<00:00:55.340> 1018<00:00:56.530> 1018<00:00:57.530> would<00:00:58.430> have

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 
compared it against 1018 1018 would have

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:06.910 
compared it against 1018 1018 would have
a<00:00:58.670> much<00:00:59.060> great<00:00:59.690> year

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.789 

now<00:01:07.490> let's<00:01:07.880> go<00:01:08.060> back<00:01:08.360> and<00:01:08.390> replace<00:01:09.200> this<00:01:09.590> tool

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:11.799 
now let's go back and replace this tool

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:21.510 
now let's go back and replace this tool
with<00:01:12.130> the<00:01:12.310> shear<00:01:12.609> tool

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.289 

through<00:01:21.820> the<00:01:22.030> combination<00:01:22.840> of<00:01:22.960> lard<00:01:23.320> and

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
through the combination of lard and

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:57.410 
through the combination of lard and
Malini

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.910 

that'll<00:01:57.870> show<00:01:58.050> up<00:01:58.290> on<00:01:58.500> camera

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
that'll show up on camera

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.580 
that'll show up on camera
it's<00:02:00.430> actually<00:02:00.760> almost<00:02:01.150> too<00:02:01.450> fine<00:02:01.660> to<00:02:01.840> see<00:02:02.050> the

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
it's actually almost too fine to see the

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.580 
it's actually almost too fine to see the
gossamer<00:02:03.130> script

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.529 

home<00:02:07.010> zoom<00:02:07.250> in<00:02:07.430> when<00:02:07.640> we've<00:02:08.119> got<00:02:08.270> to<00:02:08.360> follow

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
home zoom in when we've got to follow

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.900 
home zoom in when we've got to follow
that<00:02:08.780> here<00:02:08.960> in<00:02:09.020> a<00:02:09.080> second

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.479 

stop<00:02:13.570> it<00:02:13.720> about<00:02:13.960> half<00:02:14.200> way<00:02:14.440> and<00:02:14.470> then<00:02:14.710> along

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
stop it about half way and then along

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:18.650 
stop it about half way and then along
clean<00:02:16.000> it<00:02:16.150> up

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:38.009 

see<00:02:19.200> how<00:02:19.350> it<00:02:19.500> compares

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:38.019 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:40.030 

so<00:02:39.019> it<00:02:39.110> might<00:02:39.230> be<00:02:39.290> a<00:02:39.410> little<00:02:39.560> hard<00:02:39.739> to<00:02:39.860> see<00:02:40.010> on

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
so it might be a little hard to see on

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.500 
so it might be a little hard to see on
the<00:02:40.250> video<00:02:40.370> but<00:02:40.580> you<00:02:40.849> can<00:02:40.970> feel<00:02:41.330> a<00:02:41.360> difference

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
the video but you can feel a difference

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.320 
the video but you can feel a difference
when<00:02:41.989> we're<00:02:42.920> with<00:02:43.129> your<00:02:43.310> finger<00:02:43.700> now<00:02:43.849> you<00:02:43.910> can

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
when we're with your finger now you can

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.180 
when we're with your finger now you can
feel<00:02:44.599> the<00:02:44.810> difference<00:02:45.200> yes<00:02:45.440> yeah<00:02:45.860> when<00:02:46.069> we

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
feel the difference yes yeah when we

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.580 
feel the difference yes yeah when we
were<00:02:46.250> doing<00:02:46.459> this<00:02:46.610> earlier<00:02:46.970> we<00:02:47.150> were<00:02:47.269> a<00:02:47.590> little

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
were doing this earlier we were a little

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.440 
were doing this earlier we were a little
hard<00:02:48.739> to<00:02:48.830> see<00:02:49.069> the<00:02:49.190> difference<00:02:49.310> but<00:02:49.880> maybe

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
hard to see the difference but maybe

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.380 
hard to see the difference but maybe
with<00:02:50.690> my<00:02:51.640> still<00:02:52.640> camera<00:02:52.670> I'll<00:02:53.090> be<00:02:53.209> able<00:02:53.300> to

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
with my still camera I'll be able to

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:54.670 
with my still camera I'll be able to
take<00:02:53.569> a<00:02:53.599> photo<00:02:53.870> that'll<00:02:54.170> show<00:02:54.290> the<00:02:54.410> difference

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
take a photo that'll show the difference

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:00.420 
take a photo that'll show the difference
a<00:02:54.769> little<00:02:54.860> better<00:02:57.190> but<00:02:58.190> that's<00:02:58.340> pretty<00:02:58.640> cool

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
a little better but that's pretty cool

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:06.750 
a little better but that's pretty cool
there<00:03:01.430> are<00:03:01.459> the<00:03:01.670> chips<00:03:02.530> you<00:03:03.530> zoom<00:03:03.709> back<00:03:03.739> out

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.900

was called a what again it's a
tangential<00:03:18.620> shear<00:03:19.190> tool<00:03:19.720> shear<00:03:20.720> tool<00:03:20.959> okay

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
tangential shear tool shear tool okay

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.250 
tangential shear tool shear tool okay
yeah<00:03:21.769> but<00:03:22.099> I<00:03:22.400> have<00:03:22.880> a<00:03:22.970> tangential<00:03:23.569> tool<00:03:23.930> holder

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
yeah but I have a tangential tool holder

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.009 
yeah but I have a tangential tool holder
I've<00:03:24.410> got<00:03:24.680> the<00:03:25.360> diamond<00:03:26.360> tool<00:03:26.510> holder<00:03:26.840> by

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:27.019 
I've got the diamond tool holder by

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:29.229 
I've got the diamond tool holder by
eccentric<00:03:27.530> engineering<00:03:28.069> but<00:03:28.730> you<00:03:28.849> made<00:03:29.060> your

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239 
eccentric engineering but you made your

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:32.800 
eccentric engineering but you made your
own<00:03:29.269> here<00:03:31.180> if<00:03:32.180> you<00:03:32.329> had<00:03:32.450> it<00:03:32.569> to<00:03:32.660> do<00:03:32.780> over

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
own here if you had it to do over

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:34.479 
own here if you had it to do over
anything<00:03:33.349> you'd<00:03:33.470> change<00:03:33.709> on<00:03:33.890> your<00:03:33.980> design<00:03:34.310> Oh

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489 
anything you'd change on your design Oh

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:38.500 
anything you'd change on your design Oh
probably<00:03:35.030> yeah<00:03:35.660> but<00:03:36.500> this<00:03:37.010> is<00:03:37.280> this<00:03:38.150> is<00:03:38.359> the

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
probably yeah but this is this is the

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:41.680 
probably yeah but this is this is the
go-to<00:03:38.750> tool<00:03:39.200> this<00:03:39.530> is<00:03:39.709> what<00:03:39.920> I<00:03:39.950> use<00:03:40.340> for<00:03:40.600> 80%<00:03:41.600> of

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
go-to tool this is what I use for 80% of

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:43.750 
go-to tool this is what I use for 80% of
the<00:03:41.750> work<00:03:41.930> yeah<00:03:42.769> I<00:03:42.799> have<00:03:42.950> noticed<00:03:43.250> I<00:03:43.370> get<00:03:43.579> a

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
the work yeah I have noticed I get a

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.259 
the work yeah I have noticed I get a
much<00:03:44.510> better<00:03:44.690> finish<00:03:45.139> using<00:03:45.440> that<00:03:45.769> than<00:03:46.269> your

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:47.269 
much better finish using that than your

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:49.599 
much better finish using that than your
regular<00:03:47.480> high<00:03:48.109> speed<00:03:48.380> steel<00:03:48.620> tool<00:03:48.859> but<00:03:49.220> I'm

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:49.609 
regular high speed steel tool but I'm

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:52.229 
regular high speed steel tool but I'm
gonna<00:03:49.730> have<00:03:49.880> to<00:03:49.940> go<00:03:50.030> home<00:03:50.180> and<00:03:50.329> grind<00:03:50.540> myself<00:03:50.959> a

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:52.239 
gonna have to go home and grind myself a

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:57.400
