it<00:02:30.180> do<00:02:30.299> you<00:02:30.329> think<00:02:30.420> that<00:02:30.810> there's<00:02:30.989> just<00:02:31.230> an

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
it do you think that there's just an

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:33.589 
it do you think that there's just an
attention<00:02:32.010> paid<00:02:32.430> to<00:02:32.459> the<00:02:32.609> arts<00:02:32.939> now<00:02:33.150> and<00:02:33.450> and

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:33.599 
attention paid to the arts now and and

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:36.229 
attention paid to the arts now and and
what<00:02:34.109> do<00:02:34.170> you<00:02:34.260> think<00:02:34.500> the<00:02:34.620> the<00:02:35.340> deficit<00:02:36.120> that

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
what do you think the the deficit that

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:38.300 
what do you think the the deficit that
children<00:02:36.629> will<00:02:36.840> be<00:02:36.959> missing<00:02:37.859> what<00:02:38.069> will<00:02:38.189> they

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
children will be missing what will they

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.740 
children will be missing what will they
miss<00:02:38.519> if<00:02:38.700> they<00:02:38.819> don't<00:02:39.030> learn<00:02:39.180> more<00:02:39.420> about<00:02:39.510> them

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
miss if they don't learn more about them

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.569 
miss if they don't learn more about them
I<00:02:39.840> think<00:02:40.139> there's<00:02:40.349> a<00:02:40.439> lot<00:02:40.739> of<00:02:40.769> programs<00:02:41.370> that

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:41.579 
I think there's a lot of programs that

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:43.550 
I think there's a lot of programs that
encourage<00:02:42.000> children<00:02:42.689> to<00:02:42.900> make<00:02:43.169> parts<00:02:43.439> of

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
encourage children to make parts of

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.059
