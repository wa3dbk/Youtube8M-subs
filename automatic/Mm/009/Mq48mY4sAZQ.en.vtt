00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:08.540 
that I do that is just slice it really

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:11.400 
that I do that is just slice it really
thin<00:00:08.660> I<00:00:09.170> take<00:00:09.799> it<00:00:09.950> anything<00:00:10.400> that's<00:00:10.669> like<00:00:10.879> a

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:11.410 
thin I take it anything that's like a

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:14.190 
thin I take it anything that's like a
congealed<00:00:12.410> blood<00:00:12.620> or<00:00:13.400> anything<00:00:13.580> that<00:00:13.879> looks

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:14.200 
congealed blood or anything that looks

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.830 
congealed blood or anything that looks
really<00:00:15.200> strange<00:00:15.499> but<00:00:15.860> the<00:00:16.610> texture<00:00:17.210> remember

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:17.840 
really strange but the texture remember

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.300 
really strange but the texture remember
was<00:00:17.960> it<00:00:18.080> like<00:00:18.200> prime<00:00:18.440> rib<00:00:18.470> what<00:00:18.890> was<00:00:19.040> it<00:00:19.160> like

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:19.310 
was it like prime rib what was it like

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.210 
was it like prime rib what was it like
when<00:00:19.880> he<00:00:20.000> did<00:00:20.150> it<00:00:20.180> as<00:00:20.420> a<00:00:20.450> roast<00:00:21.040> disgusting

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:22.220 
when he did it as a roast disgusting

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:28.930 
when he did it as a roast disgusting

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:28.940 
yeah can I know can I pan to you a shape

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:33.610 
yeah can I know can I pan to you a shape
more<00:00:29.270> appropriate<00:00:29.960> yeah<00:00:30.340> um<00:00:32.050> it<00:00:33.050> was<00:00:33.200> a<00:00:33.230> little

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:33.620 
more appropriate yeah um it was a little

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.520 
more appropriate yeah um it was a little
tougher<00:00:34.190> it<00:00:34.460> was<00:00:34.610> more<00:00:34.820> like<00:00:35.000> a<00:00:35.030> sirloin<00:00:35.960> steak

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:36.530 
tougher it was more like a sirloin steak

tougher it was more like a sirloin steak
tonight<00:00:37.490> I<00:00:37.520> remember<00:00:38.150> thinking<00:00:38.540> it<00:00:38.720> was<00:00:38.810> the

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:38.840 
tonight I remember thinking it was the

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.800 
tonight I remember thinking it was the
nicest<00:00:39.110> texture<00:00:39.680> I<00:00:40.120> but<00:00:41.120> what<00:00:41.450> did<00:00:41.630> it<00:00:41.720> remind

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:41.810 
nicest texture I but what did it remind

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:46.620 
nicest texture I but what did it remind
me<00:00:42.079> of<00:00:43.060> it<00:00:44.060> has<00:00:44.840> texture<00:00:45.440> it's<00:00:46.040> not

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:46.630 
me of it has texture it's not

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:48.970 
me of it has texture it's not
necessarily<00:00:47.630> fall<00:00:47.930> apart<00:00:48.260> in<00:00:48.380> your<00:00:48.410> mouth<00:00:48.530> but

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:48.980 
necessarily fall apart in your mouth but

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.810 
necessarily fall apart in your mouth but
it's<00:00:49.160> a<00:00:49.310> very<00:00:49.840> concentrated<00:00:50.840> texture<00:00:51.710> and<00:00:51.950> it

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
it's a very concentrated texture and it

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.139 
it's a very concentrated texture and it
picks<00:00:53.030> up<00:00:53.180> flavors<00:00:53.420> really<00:00:53.870> nice<00:00:54.050> so<00:00:55.090> do<00:00:56.090> you

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:56.149 
picks up flavors really nice so do you

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:57.250 
picks up flavors really nice so do you
want<00:00:56.270> to<00:00:56.360> hold<00:00:56.450> the<00:00:56.570> camera<00:00:56.720> for<00:00:56.870> me

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
want to hold the camera for me

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.000 
want to hold the camera for me
just<00:00:58.070> keep<00:00:58.850> it<00:00:58.970> on<00:00:59.090> then<00:00:59.300> keep<00:00:59.540> it<00:00:59.660> on<00:00:59.750> the<00:01:00.010> road

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
you see there's no fat or anything in it

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.609 
you see there's no fat or anything in it
it's<00:01:10.670> like<00:01:11.469> very<00:01:12.469> condensed<00:01:13.429> and<00:01:13.549> it's<00:01:13.670> chewy

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:14.619 
it's like very condensed and it's chewy

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:17.559 
it's like very condensed and it's chewy
so<00:01:15.619> I'm<00:01:15.679> gonna<00:01:15.920> fry<00:01:16.789> those<00:01:16.969> in<00:01:17.179> some<00:01:17.389> butter

00:01:17.559 --> 00:01:17.569 
so I'm gonna fry those in some butter

00:01:17.569 --> 00:01:19.870 
so I'm gonna fry those in some butter
with<00:01:17.810> some<00:01:18.109> salt<00:01:18.380> and<00:01:19.280> when<00:01:19.399> I'm<00:01:19.490> talking

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
with some salt and when I'm talking

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.219 
with some salt and when I'm talking
about<00:01:20.060> what<00:01:20.209> I'm<00:01:20.299> saying<00:01:20.509> congealed<00:01:20.869> blood<00:01:21.020> is

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 
about what I'm saying congealed blood is

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:25.289 
about what I'm saying congealed blood is
that<00:01:21.469> in<00:01:21.950> these<00:01:22.549> spaces<00:01:23.090> in<00:01:23.539> here<00:01:23.569> sometimes

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:25.299 
that in these spaces in here sometimes

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:28.719 
that in these spaces in here sometimes
the<00:01:26.299> blood<00:01:26.600> congealed<00:01:27.409> is<00:01:27.590> all<00:01:28.039> and<00:01:28.249> but<00:01:28.549> the

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:28.729 
the blood congealed is all and but the

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:30.849 
the blood congealed is all and but the
texture<00:01:29.329> on<00:01:29.359> this<00:01:29.569> is<00:01:29.749> incredibly<00:01:30.439> nice<00:01:30.619> I'm

00:01:30.849 --> 00:01:30.859 
texture on this is incredibly nice I'm

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:32.590 
texture on this is incredibly nice I'm
not<00:01:31.130> particularly<00:01:31.579> a<00:01:31.850> huge<00:01:32.119> fan<00:01:32.299> of<00:01:32.329> liver

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
not particularly a huge fan of liver

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.550 
not particularly a huge fan of liver
unless<00:01:32.990> it's<00:01:33.139> really<00:01:34.209> really<00:01:35.209> fresh<00:01:35.569> but<00:01:35.929> as

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
unless it's really really fresh but as

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.279 
unless it's really really fresh but as
far<00:01:36.770> as<00:01:36.799> heart<00:01:37.069> goes<00:01:37.279> especially<00:01:38.119> if<00:01:38.539> mr.<00:01:39.109> dirt

00:01:39.279 --> 00:01:39.289 
far as heart goes especially if mr. dirt

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:42.550 
far as heart goes especially if mr. dirt
does<00:01:39.560> it<00:01:39.740> it's<00:01:40.549> pretty<00:01:40.819> good<00:01:40.880> so<00:01:41.240> this<00:01:41.990> might

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
does it it's pretty good so this might

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.449 
does it it's pretty good so this might
give<00:01:42.889> some<00:01:42.920> people<00:01:43.459> the<00:01:43.549> heebie-jeebies

00:01:45.449 --> 00:01:45.459 
give some people the heebie-jeebies

00:01:45.459 --> 00:01:46.629 
give some people the heebie-jeebies
centralism

00:01:46.629 --> 00:01:46.639 
centralism

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:49.480 
centralism
well<00:01:47.119> the<00:01:47.270> fat<00:01:47.539> and<00:01:47.869> yeah<00:01:48.319> and<00:01:48.590> the<00:01:48.979> tubing<00:01:49.399> and

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
well the fat and yeah and the tubing and

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.219 
well the fat and yeah and the tubing and
everything<00:01:49.939> but<00:01:50.569> there's<00:01:50.810> still<00:01:51.020> a<00:01:51.049> little

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
everything but there's still a little

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:53.830 
everything but there's still a little
bit<00:01:51.469> of<00:01:51.560> good<00:01:51.679> meat<00:01:52.130> in<00:01:52.159> here<00:01:52.579> that's<00:01:53.539> not

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
bit of good meat in here that's not

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.809 
bit of good meat in here that's not
necessarily<00:01:54.380> heebie-jeebie<00:01:57.429> but<00:01:58.429> the<00:01:58.609> top

00:01:58.809 --> 00:01:58.819 
necessarily heebie-jeebie but the top

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:00.339 
necessarily heebie-jeebie but the top
you<00:01:59.029> should<00:01:59.240> probably<00:01:59.450> just<00:01:59.719> give<00:01:59.869> to<00:02:00.079> an

00:02:00.339 --> 00:02:00.349 
you should probably just give to an

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:02.230 
you should probably just give to an
animal<00:02:00.740> but<00:02:00.889> see<00:02:01.069> that's<00:02:01.549> how<00:02:01.819> much<00:02:01.969> you<00:02:02.090> have

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
animal but see that's how much you have

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.940 
animal but see that's how much you have
left<00:02:02.450> it's<00:02:02.689> not<00:02:02.869> that<00:02:03.289> much<00:02:03.469> meat<00:02:03.679> when<00:02:03.859> you

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
left it's not that much meat when you

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.980 
left it's not that much meat when you
get<00:02:04.099> to<00:02:04.249> that<00:02:04.399> point<00:02:04.669> and<00:02:04.939> you<00:02:05.450> could<00:02:05.630> cook<00:02:05.869> it

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
get to that point and you could cook it

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.639 
get to that point and you could cook it
and<00:02:06.139> somebody<00:02:06.439> could<00:02:06.619> shoo<00:02:06.829> it<00:02:06.950> out<00:02:08.110> um<00:02:09.110> but

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
and somebody could shoo it out um but

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:11.380 
and somebody could shoo it out um but

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
this well let's see the heart is really

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.850 
this well let's see the heart is really
good<00:02:26.780> for<00:02:28.660> it's<00:02:29.660> an<00:02:29.960> organ<00:02:30.410> meat<00:02:30.560> but<00:02:30.740> it's

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
good for it's an organ meat but it's

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.260 
good for it's an organ meat but it's
actually<00:02:31.190> a<00:02:31.220> muscle<00:02:31.550> of<00:02:31.670> course<00:02:31.880> because<00:02:32.150> it's

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.270 
actually a muscle of course because it's

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.150 
actually a muscle of course because it's
always<00:02:32.600> just<00:02:32.780> feeding<00:02:33.170> so<00:02:33.470> it<00:02:33.650> ends<00:02:33.950> up<00:02:33.980> being

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
always just feeding so it ends up being

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.780 
always just feeding so it ends up being
very<00:02:34.250> tough<00:02:34.730> so<00:02:35.360> which<00:02:35.990> naturally<00:02:36.580> you<00:02:37.580> just

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
very tough so which naturally you just

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.660 
very tough so which naturally you just
need<00:02:37.940> to<00:02:38.030> slow<00:02:38.240> cook<00:02:38.450> it<00:02:38.600> um<00:02:38.830> so<00:02:39.830> what<00:02:40.220> I<00:02:40.250> did<00:02:40.400> is

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
need to slow cook it um so what I did is

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.510 
need to slow cook it um so what I did is
I<00:02:40.760> stuffed<00:02:41.060> it<00:02:41.150> full<00:02:41.209> of<00:02:41.360> bell<00:02:41.540> peppers<00:02:41.930> onions

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.840 
we ended up with a beef oh-oh diddly
okay<00:02:53.840> so<00:02:54.170> well<00:02:54.560> either<00:02:54.830> way<00:02:55.100> even<00:02:55.310> the<00:02:55.550> wood

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
okay so well either way even the wood

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:57.640 
okay so well either way even the wood
stoves<00:02:56.150> kind<00:02:56.450> of<00:02:56.510> a<00:02:56.570> lower<00:02:56.750> temperature<00:02:57.170> so<00:02:57.530> it

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
stoves kind of a lower temperature so it

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.870 
stoves kind of a lower temperature so it
is<00:02:57.709> only<00:02:57.830> 200<00:02:58.370> to<00:02:58.489> 250<00:02:58.850> um<00:02:59.800> and<00:03:00.800> so<00:03:01.160> that's<00:03:01.610> when

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
is only 200 to 250 um and so that's when

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.979 
is only 200 to 250 um and so that's when
it<00:03:01.970> ends<00:03:02.180> up<00:03:02.270> being<00:03:02.450> very<00:03:02.540> tender<00:03:04.989> texture

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:05.989 
it ends up being very tender texture

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:07.150 
it ends up being very tender texture
