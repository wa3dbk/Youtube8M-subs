00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399

fabulous job and we watched that there

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.420 
fabulous job and we watched that there
was<00:00:52.170> sort<00:00:52.440> of<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.710> tough<00:00:52.980> act<00:00:53.250> to<00:00:53.340> follow

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
was sort of the tough act to follow

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.920 
was sort of the tough act to follow
because<00:00:54.030> they<00:00:54.149> did<00:00:54.360> a<00:00:54.390> great<00:00:54.600> job<00:00:54.719> of
