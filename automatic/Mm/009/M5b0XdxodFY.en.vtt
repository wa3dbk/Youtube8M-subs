00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.089 
that
I<00:00:09.750> thought<00:00:09.929> we<00:00:10.080> were<00:00:10.170> too<00:00:10.349> slow<00:00:10.530> with<00:00:10.800> it<00:00:10.889> first

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
I thought we were too slow with it first

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.640 
I thought we were too slow with it first
stuff<00:00:11.630> but<00:00:12.630> we've<00:00:12.780> been<00:00:12.929> given<00:00:13.110> a<00:00:13.290> test<00:00:13.500> to

baby beside that okay we're going to

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.130 
baby beside that okay we're going to
finish<00:00:22.260> with<00:00:22.380> main<00:00:23.369> cast<00:00:23.640> of<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:24.539> game<00:00:24.750> even

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
though it's the final game we've learnt

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.870 
though it's the final game we've learnt
things<00:00:26.730> today<00:00:26.939> which<00:00:28.130> was<00:00:29.130> important<00:00:29.609> to<00:00:29.730> us

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
things today which was important to us

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.820 
things today which was important to us
you<00:00:30.300> know<00:00:30.449> we've<00:00:30.990> done<00:00:31.019> certain<00:00:31.470> things<00:00:31.500> today

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.850 
that we needed answers for and we got
them<00:00:35.630> so<00:00:36.630> I<00:00:36.660> thought<00:00:36.809> it<00:00:36.930> was<00:00:37.230> perfect<00:00:37.680> for<00:00:37.710> us

the<00:00:40.230> second<00:00:40.800> half<00:00:40.890> was<00:00:40.950> better<00:00:41.160> let's<00:00:41.370> quick

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
the second half was better let's quick

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.619 
the second half was better let's quick
up<00:00:41.640> a<00:00:41.730> block<00:00:41.910> as<00:00:42.059> well<00:00:42.090> that<00:00:42.420> could<00:00:42.510> have<00:00:42.600> been

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
up a block as well that could have been

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.450 
up a block as well that could have been
a<00:00:42.719> few<00:00:42.870> mortals<00:00:43.079> down<00:00:43.410> so<00:00:43.620> yeah<00:00:43.890> I<00:00:43.920> thought<00:00:44.309> we

a few mortals down so yeah I thought we

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.250 
a few mortals down so yeah I thought we

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
the game second half where first half we

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.779 
the game second half where first half we
were<00:00:49.200> to<00:00:49.350> spread<00:00:49.739> and

00:00:51.779 --> 00:00:51.789 
were to spread and

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:54.590 
were to spread and
not<00:00:52.570> quick<00:00:52.899> enough<00:00:52.929> not<00:00:53.379> quick<00:00:53.589> enough<00:00:53.679> temper

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600
