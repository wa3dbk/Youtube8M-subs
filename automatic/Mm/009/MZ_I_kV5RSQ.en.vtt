 integral not open helmet him 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:16.830
 talk about the pros and cons and how to 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:18.380
 choose if we start the helmet arai rx-7 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:28.349
 gp 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:32.690
 integral masthead helmet from arai series that 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:36.899
 on the pluses he has a good windshield 

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:40.670
 quality stuff i'm actually up 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.809
 so far I can not get enough of how 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.890
 quality work was done 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:49.789
 Interested in a helmet going hands 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:52.260
 means very well thought out 

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:56.190
 airing that is so that your type does not 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:01:01.219
 sweat so that the glass does not sweat thought out 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:04.939
 helmet ventilation system 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:08.189
 on chin ventilation on top of head 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:11.820
 three holes and such 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:15.810
 figurative eyebrows on the visor 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.520
 so that the leader is not for party vol and yours 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.180
 the head is not sweating and that the payment is not 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.820
 caught a cold 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.409
 Generally helmet has a big era of dynamic 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.439
 coefficient 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:30.030
 this helmet is a racing use it on 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:31.979
 racing moto gp and to enhance 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.040
 aerodynamic properties was coined 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:41.040
 such a spoiler, you see it for yourself 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:44.040
 goes here here why is it needed 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:48.420
 when you ride a motorbike for a spa for 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:50.930
 sports and to the difference i see also in 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:56.159
 export you drive 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:59.130
 crouching behind the fairing this you see 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:01.030
 damp the air from the fairing passes 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.479
 on top of your helmet 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:06.970
 and here already joins the work itself 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:10.140
 he used regular and aerial 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:12.520
 streams adapts to them and 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.220
 stabilizes your head that is not 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.170
 gives and goes to stagger 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.860
 hang out so on to the inner 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:22.480
 helmet trim 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:25.959
 here we have of course material in very 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:28.770
 nice pulled out cheeks pulled out 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:34.780
 all the beer to wash 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:38.380
 such a helmet head sweats and well, how would 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.320
 sometimes you have to erase it for this 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:47.640
 done everything can be pulled out and washed 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:47.640
 there are no comments on this 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:53.650
 in appearance looks very cool 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.590
 in general, it is very large headlamp 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:59.950
 Color palette 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:02.530
 different coloring and and we are not in this plan 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.670
 no matter how much it takes 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.209
 took your black white 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:11.130
 now the muddy jagger cool helmet times 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:15.130
 thefts in different colors are noticeable on the road 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:18.390
 therefore a very large selection is presented 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:21.010
 paradise and of course it's high quality 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:23.250
 the quality of them is top notch 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.250
 take away 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.500
 in general, in my opinion the safest 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.709
 slam it 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.660
 integral why because corpus 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:33.930
 performed and 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:37.080
 apparently poured that is, the whole body is one 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:39.390
 something a little bit that this one is all one 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:41.730
 and the students are not there are not bound not 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:45.060
 connects during an accident 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:50.910
 there are chances to get off 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:57.660
 much easier than here in this helmet's 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:04:05.570
 what else to say on it go on the Internet 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:07.430
 farther on arai helmet 

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:14.010
 ram for 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:18.590
 that is, with z ram for again with z wounds 4 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:21.720
 for dull open helmet 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:27.750
 also from the company aray 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:28.910
 performed almost the same as Rexi 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:32.610
 same 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:36.290
 fairing but since this version is more 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:39.870
 budget on it 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:45.090
 idle spoiler installed 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:50.000
 that is, such a spoiler model like that 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:53.220
 welded here soldered does not work in general 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:56.910
 from this overdrive at 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:05:00.750
 you head goes and terrible aerodynamics 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:05.580
 terrible windshield all noise hums 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:08.580
 can not hear anything absolutely air you 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.660
 somewhere in the middle of 10 whether the local mass 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:13.260
 even whirling 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:16.800
 and just can not hear anything in it is the same 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:20.090
 clasp like on all schemes areia up 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:21.240
 more simple that is, two ringlets 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:25.919
 strap 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:29.220
 We pass through two ringlets a strap then through 

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:31.610
 one ring back if you need to pull 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:35.330
 pull up stand for the same strap 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:39.380
 pulling on and already shot directly 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:39.380
 in this place so she does not hang out 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:50.160
 fasten if you need to stretch take over 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:52.080
 red flag they want this 

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:56.460
 fastener is one of the easiest and most 

00:05:52.080 --> 00:06:01.890
 reliable should not invent engineer 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:04.890
 area of ​​the road put so simple and 

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:06.570
 technological fastener what else on it 

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:09.680
 say the same way all the materials are removed 

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:09.680
 all erased 

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:15.840
 appearance is very cool of course but i'm on 

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:18.780
 doesn't really support such a helmet in 

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:22.880
 as the main helmet well, what are we 

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:26.990
 insecure original to nikakuschaya 

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:32.220
 here and there and how as 

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:34.470
 I do not use all my extra 

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:37.170
 I advise anyone to buy as well in general 

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:39.960
 Of course you Russia interesting such 

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:43.500
 slam purchase policy 

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:45.450
 i have there 4000 there is there sports and 

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:48.120
 plus more and start all and thousands 

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:51.050
 helmet and I will not steal the whole experience 

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:53.280
 ok actually this is all bullshit 

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:56.280
 stitches to buy and better quality helmet 

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:58.950
 better save up and buy yourself a good one 

00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:01.650
 branded helmet at least you me 

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:04.290
 be sure and never buy with 

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:07.520
 than with this whole bad deal is not 

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:11.280
 it is known that he fell there with him did not fall 

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:15.110
 maybe he already has an inside 

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:15.110
 this is the most important she is already there 

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:21.000
 deformed and no longer him 

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:25.530
 safety loft is not worth it therefore 

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:28.340
 guys, the buyer is good noise with you 

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:31.080
