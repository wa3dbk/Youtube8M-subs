00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
we do not have an unripe UV so we aren't

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.250 
we do not have an unripe UV so we aren't
exactly<00:00:59.039> sure<00:00:59.520> what<00:01:00.329> this<00:01:00.510> ride<00:01:00.750> will<00:01:00.930> be<00:01:01.050> like

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
exactly sure what this ride will be like

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.229 
exactly sure what this ride will be like
but<00:01:01.710> at<00:01:01.859> least<00:01:02.010> we<00:01:02.280> have<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.609> layout<00:01:03.000> and

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
but at least we have the layout and

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.270 
but at least we have the layout and
looking<00:01:03.960> at<00:01:04.110> it<00:01:04.229> it<00:01:04.409> looks<00:01:04.650> like<00:01:04.739> a<00:01:04.860> fairly

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
looking at it it looks like a fairly

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.670 
looking at it it looks like a fairly
intense<00:01:05.909> layout<00:01:06.510> I<00:01:06.840> think<00:01:07.260> that<00:01:07.409> for<00:01:07.590> this

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
intense layout I think that for this

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.140 
intense layout I think that for this
coaster<00:01:08.040> you're<00:01:08.159> gonna<00:01:08.310> get<00:01:08.520> a<00:01:08.580> similar<00:01:08.820> ride

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
coaster you're gonna get a similar ride

land<00:01:21.000> but<00:01:21.479> like<00:01:21.600> I<00:01:21.720> said<00:01:21.780> this<00:01:22.110> is<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.320> first

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
land but like I said this is the first

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.880 
land but like I said this is the first
infinity<00:01:23.369> coaster<00:01:23.880> in<00:01:24.060> North<00:01:24.750> America<00:01:25.470> heck

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
infinity coaster in North America heck

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.830 
infinity coaster in North America heck
it's<00:01:26.280> even<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.700> first<00:01:26.909> one<00:01:27.150> in<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.390> Western

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
it's even the first one in the Western

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.929 
it's even the first one in the Western
Hemisphere<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.890> it's<00:01:29.310> all<00:01:29.430> coming<00:01:29.759> to<00:01:29.909> a

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
Hemisphere and it's all coming to a

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.840 
Hemisphere and it's all coming to a
small<00:01:30.360> Park<00:01:30.930> in<00:01:31.140> Iowa<00:01:31.740> which<00:01:31.950> is<00:01:31.979> really<00:01:32.549> cool

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
small Park in Iowa which is really cool

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.490 
small Park in Iowa which is really cool
the<00:01:33.210> main<00:01:33.390> downside<00:01:33.869> for<00:01:34.140> gaining<00:01:34.320> this

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
the main downside for gaining this

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.170 
the main downside for gaining this
coaster<00:01:34.829> is<00:01:35.100> that<00:01:35.369> you<00:01:35.490> do<00:01:35.670> have<00:01:35.790> to<00:01:35.939> remove

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
coaster is that you do have to remove

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.390 
coaster is that you do have to remove
the<00:01:36.420> log<00:01:36.630> flume<00:01:36.840> which<00:01:37.439> I<00:01:37.650> mean<00:01:37.829> there's<00:01:38.009> a<00:01:38.070> lot

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
the log flume which I mean there's a lot

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.700 
the log flume which I mean there's a lot
of<00:01:38.549> people<00:01:38.880> who<00:01:39.000> really<00:01:39.420> love<00:01:39.780> log<00:01:40.079> flume<00:01:40.439> and

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
of people who really love log flume and

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.830 
of people who really love log flume and
this<00:01:41.189> one<00:01:41.340> has<00:01:41.490> been<00:01:41.520> around<00:01:41.700> for<00:01:42.210> a<00:01:42.240> long<00:01:42.479> time

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
this one has been around for a long time

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.990 
this one has been around for a long time
so<00:01:43.350> if<00:01:43.439> you're<00:01:43.590> a<00:01:43.619> big<00:01:43.860> fan<00:01:44.100> of<00:01:44.130> log<00:01:44.430> flume<00:01:44.790> so

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
so if you're a big fan of log flume so

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.010 
so if you're a big fan of log flume so
you<00:01:45.090> should<00:01:45.210> probably<00:01:45.270> get<00:01:45.600> to<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:45.720> park

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
you should probably get to the park

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.929 
you should probably get to the park
because<00:01:46.110> that<00:01:46.409> one<00:01:46.619> won't<00:01:46.890> be<00:01:47.100> around<00:01:47.340> for<00:01:47.670> too

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
because that one won't be around for too

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.090 
because that one won't be around for too
much<00:01:48.149> longer<00:01:48.210> but<00:01:49.140> generally<00:01:49.619> people<00:01:49.799> would

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
much longer but generally people would

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.190 
much longer but generally people would
rather<00:01:50.369> have<00:01:50.670> a<00:01:50.700> coaster<00:01:51.390> than<00:01:51.570> a<00:01:51.600> log<00:01:51.930> flume

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
rather have a coaster than a log flume

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.260 
rather have a coaster than a log flume
so<00:01:52.829> I<00:01:52.860> think<00:01:52.979> that<00:01:53.280> this<00:01:53.399> is<00:01:53.490> gonna<00:01:53.610> be<00:01:53.700> a<00:01:53.820> good

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
so I think that this is gonna be a good

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.090 
so I think that this is gonna be a good
fit<00:01:54.570> it<00:01:54.780> looks<00:01:55.049> like<00:01:55.259> it's<00:01:55.470> gonna<00:01:55.619> be<00:01:55.799> a<00:01:55.829> very

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
fit it looks like it's gonna be a very

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.969 
fit it looks like it's gonna be a very
solid<00:01:56.549> ride<00:01:57.060> experience<00:01:57.799> overall<00:01:58.799> look

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
solid ride experience overall look

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.289 
solid ride experience overall look
forward<00:01:59.250> to<00:01:59.369> seeing<00:01:59.549> how<00:01:59.610> the<00:01:59.670> construction

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
forward to seeing how the construction

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.359 
forward to seeing how the construction
of<00:02:00.329> this<00:02:00.570> coaster<00:02:00.990> goes<00:02:01.229> and<00:02:01.530> then<00:02:01.890> finally

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
of this coaster goes and then finally

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.439 
of this coaster goes and then finally
what<00:02:02.549> people<00:02:02.850> think<00:02:03.090> of<00:02:03.270> it<00:02:03.420> once<00:02:03.659> it<00:02:03.899> opens
