00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
opposite way the next step would be to

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.700 
opposite way the next step would be to
loosen<00:01:31.520> this<00:01:31.610> bolt<00:01:31.670> here<00:01:32.180> by<00:01:33.080> a<00:01:33.110> flathead

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
there'll be another one over here then

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:52.570 
there'll be another one over here then
pull<00:01:48.440> this<00:01:48.560> clip<00:01:48.770> off<00:01:50.320> and<00:01:51.320> undo<00:01:51.590> the<00:01:51.740> in<00:01:52.070> take

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
right a little bit in so it goes around

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:20.190 
right a little bit in so it goes around
the<00:04:15.250> lip<00:04:15.600> take<00:04:16.600> your<00:04:16.780> screwdriver<00:04:17.519> and<00:04:19.200> secure

comes<00:04:24.070> later

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:34.760 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:40.190 

next<00:04:35.760> step<00:04:35.910> is<00:04:36.060> to<00:04:36.120> take<00:04:36.450> your<00:04:36.800> new<00:04:37.800> tube<00:04:39.200> and

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:40.200 
next step is to take your new tube and

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.880 
next step is to take your new tube and
secure<00:04:40.710> that<00:04:40.950> to<00:04:41.250> the<00:04:42.240> silicon<00:04:42.840> body<00:04:43.560> but

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:43.890 
secure that to the silicon body but

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:52.490 
secure that to the silicon body but
loosen<00:04:44.280> your<00:04:44.370> hose<00:04:44.550> clamp

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:05:30.640 

let's<00:04:53.310> take<00:04:53.490> this<00:04:56.510> put<00:04:57.510> your<00:04:57.720> hose<00:04:57.840> clamp<00:04:58.140> on

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:30.650 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:38.330 

now<00:05:31.650> that's<00:05:31.979> secure<00:05:32.370> the<00:05:32.490> next<00:05:32.759> step<00:05:33.979> okay<00:05:37.340> and

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:38.340 
now that's secure the next step okay and

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:41.779 
now that's secure the next step okay and
it<00:05:38.550> should<00:05:38.729> slip<00:05:39.150> right<00:05:39.389> on<00:05:39.590> if<00:05:40.590> not<00:05:41.490> you<00:05:41.669> got

00:05:41.779 --> 00:05:41.789 
it should slip right on if not you got

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:43.610 
it should slip right on if not you got
to<00:05:41.910> loosen<00:05:42.090> the<00:05:42.419> clamp<00:05:42.660> a<00:05:42.780> little<00:05:42.810> but<00:05:43.380> as<00:05:43.500> you

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:43.620 
to loosen the clamp a little but as you

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:49.490 
to loosen the clamp a little but as you
can<00:05:43.740> see<00:05:43.889> it<00:05:43.979> slides<00:05:44.190> right<00:05:44.370> on<00:05:46.370> and<00:05:48.289> sign<00:05:49.289> that

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:49.500 
can see it slides right on and sign that

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:58.460 
can see it slides right on and sign that
down<00:05:49.710> as<00:05:49.860> well<00:05:56.750> the<00:05:57.750> next<00:05:57.900> step<00:05:58.139> would<00:05:58.259> be<00:05:58.320> to

00:05:58.460 --> 00:05:58.470 
down as well the next step would be to

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:07.100 
down as well the next step would be to
plug<00:05:58.949> in<00:05:59.130> your<00:06:00.470> sensor<00:06:01.470> plug<00:06:05.509> you<00:06:06.509> then<00:06:06.720> put<00:06:06.990> on

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:07.110 
plug in your sensor plug you then put on

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:09.620 
plug in your sensor plug you then put on

looks in the engine bay in future videos

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:53.580 
looks in the engine bay in future videos
we'll<00:06:52.360> be<00:06:52.390> building<00:06:52.810> a<00:06:52.990> heat<00:06:53.200> shield<00:06:53.440> to

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:53.590 
we'll be building a heat shield to

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:55.050 
we'll be building a heat shield to
protect<00:06:53.920> it<00:06:54.100> from<00:06:54.130> the<00:06:54.310> heat<00:06:54.610> of<00:06:54.790> the<00:06:54.850> motor

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:55.060 
protect it from the heat of the motor

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:58.920 
protect it from the heat of the motor
but<00:06:56.670> this<00:06:57.670> is<00:06:57.820> have<00:06:58.000> this<00:06:58.180> for<00:06:58.570> your<00:06:58.750> labor
