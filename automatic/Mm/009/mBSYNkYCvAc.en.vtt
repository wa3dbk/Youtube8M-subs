today I'm going to be talking about the
snow<00:00:06.990> shield<00:00:07.379> rib<00:00:07.740> guard<00:00:08.160> this<00:00:09.120> snow<00:00:09.389> guard

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
snow shield rib guard this snow guard

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.160 
snow shield rib guard this snow guard
comes<00:00:10.050> in<00:00:10.410> two<00:00:10.740> different<00:00:10.920> sizes<00:00:11.750> one<00:00:12.750> with<00:00:13.049> an

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
comes in two different sizes one with an

comes in two different sizes one with an
opening<00:00:13.530> for<00:00:13.769> standing<00:00:14.219> seams<00:00:14.580> of<00:00:15.150> one<00:00:16.109> and

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
opening for standing seams of one and

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.830 
opening for standing seams of one and
five-eighths<00:00:16.770> of<00:00:16.949> an<00:00:17.039> inch<00:00:17.220> or<00:00:17.699> shorter<00:00:18.660> and

inches or shorter the strength for the
snow<00:00:26.699> stopping<00:00:27.150> power<00:00:27.330> in<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.689> rib<00:00:27.840> guard<00:00:28.109> is

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
snow stopping power in the rib guard is

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.790 
snow stopping power in the rib guard is
derived<00:00:28.980> from<00:00:29.160> its<00:00:29.609> large<00:00:30.000> face<00:00:30.750> this<00:00:31.470> large

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
derived from its large face this large

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.350 
derived from its large face this large
face<00:00:32.160> provides<00:00:32.579> a<00:00:32.700> good<00:00:32.850> amount<00:00:33.000> of<00:00:33.149> surface

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
face provides a good amount of surface

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.440 
face provides a good amount of surface
area<00:00:33.719> to<00:00:33.960> literally<00:00:34.590> catch<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.460> snow<00:00:35.790> as<00:00:36.270> it's

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
area to literally catch the snow as it's

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.650 
area to literally catch the snow as it's
sliding<00:00:36.750> off<00:00:37.140> of<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.440> roof<00:00:37.649> at<00:00:38.329> the<00:00:39.329> bottom

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
sliding off of the roof at the bottom

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.229 
sliding off of the roof at the bottom
center<00:00:40.260> of<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.530> face<00:00:40.739> there's<00:00:41.129> an<00:00:41.280> art<00:00:41.610> shaped

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
center of the face there's an art shaped

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.590 
center of the face there's an art shaped
area<00:00:42.690> this<00:00:43.620> arch<00:00:44.010> provides<00:00:44.730> two<00:00:45.149> purposes

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
area this arch provides two purposes

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.799 
area this arch provides two purposes
first<00:00:46.309> this<00:00:47.309> allows<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.910> rib<00:00:48.090> guard<00:00:48.360> to<00:00:48.600> fit

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
first this allows the rib guard to fit

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.660 
first this allows the rib guard to fit
over<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.140> top<00:00:49.469> of<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.800> standing<00:00:50.250> seam<00:00:50.460> of<00:00:50.610> the

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
over the top of the standing seam of the

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.540 
over the top of the standing seam of the
metal<00:00:51.000> roof<00:00:51.210> and<00:00:51.510> then<00:00:52.079> second<00:00:52.590> this<00:00:53.100> provides

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
metal roof and then second this provides

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.560 
metal roof and then second this provides
a<00:00:53.910> small<00:00:54.750> drain<00:00:55.199> for<00:00:55.680> snow<00:00:56.190> or<00:00:56.670> I<00:00:56.789> guess<00:00:57.300> water

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
a small drain for snow or I guess water

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.479 
a small drain for snow or I guess water
as<00:00:57.920> it<00:00:58.920> as<00:00:59.100> it<00:00:59.340> melts<00:00:59.820> helping<00:01:00.809> to<00:01:00.989> reduce<00:01:01.489> ice

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
as it as it melts helping to reduce ice

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.579 
as it as it melts helping to reduce ice
dams<00:01:03.059> from<00:01:03.390> setting<00:01:03.719> up<00:01:03.840> on<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.110> top<00:01:04.290> of<00:01:04.320> your

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
dams from setting up on the top of your

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.539 
dams from setting up on the top of your
roof<00:01:05.540> one<00:01:06.540> advantage<00:01:07.049> to<00:01:07.080> using<00:01:07.530> a<00:01:07.979> clamp<00:01:08.340> on

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
roof one advantage to using a clamp on

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.570 
roof one advantage to using a clamp on
snow<00:01:08.909> guard<00:01:09.330> such<00:01:10.049> as<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.530> rib<00:01:10.920> guard<00:01:11.189> is<00:01:11.400> that

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
snow guard such as the rib guard is that

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.670 
snow guard such as the rib guard is that
they<00:01:11.760> they<00:01:12.150> don't<00:01:12.360> put<00:01:12.570> a<00:01:12.630> hole<00:01:12.960> in<00:01:13.409> the

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
they they don't put a hole in the

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.289 
they they don't put a hole in the
roofing<00:01:14.010> panel<00:01:14.460> there's<00:01:14.760> two<00:01:15.000> set<00:01:15.270> screws

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
roofing panel there's two set screws

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.480 
roofing panel there's two set screws
that<00:01:16.049> clamp<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.710> snow<00:01:16.920> guard<00:01:17.220> to<00:01:17.369> the

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
that clamp the snow guard to the

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.030 
that clamp the snow guard to the
standing<00:01:17.909> seam<00:01:18.240> which<00:01:18.780> gives<00:01:19.080> it<00:01:19.229> strength<00:01:19.560> to

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
standing seam which gives it strength to

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.660 
standing seam which gives it strength to
stay<00:01:20.340> on<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:21.000> roof<00:01:21.240> and<00:01:22.250> that's<00:01:23.250> really<00:01:23.460> nice

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
stay on the roof and that's really nice

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.270 
stay on the roof and that's really nice
because<00:01:23.970> there's<00:01:24.270> no<00:01:24.509> messy<00:01:24.930> adhesives<00:01:25.860> to

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
because there's no messy adhesives to

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.770 
because there's no messy adhesives to
deal<00:01:26.520> with<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.390> screw<00:01:27.920> closest<00:01:28.920> to<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.189> face
