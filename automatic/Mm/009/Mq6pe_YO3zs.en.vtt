00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.270 
to be doing a to hook rig today because
I<00:02:55.180> find<00:02:55.420> it<00:02:55.540> better<00:02:55.720> better<00:02:56.500> chance<00:02:56.830> catching

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
I find it better better chance catching

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.740 
I find it better better chance catching
fish<00:02:57.460> depending<00:02:57.790> on<00:02:58.000> what<00:02:58.180> levels<00:02:58.510> are<00:02:58.630> at

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
fish depending on what levels are at

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.140 
fish depending on what levels are at
right<00:02:59.080> so<00:02:59.680> you<00:02:59.740> have<00:02:59.860> one<00:03:00.040> hook<00:03:00.280> yet<00:03:00.820> and<00:03:01.030> make

sure you have lots of line then get your
second<00:03:05.860> hook<00:03:06.070> and<00:03:07.170> then<00:03:08.170> you<00:03:08.260> tie<00:03:08.440> another

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
second hook and then you tie another

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.160 
second hook and then you tie another
Palomar<00:03:09.220> knot<00:03:09.480> but<00:03:10.480> when<00:03:10.630> you're<00:03:10.750> tying<00:03:10.990> this

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
Palomar knot make it as far away as from

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.930 
Palomar knot make it as far away as from
the<00:03:17.020> top<00:03:17.260> hook<00:03:17.560> as<00:03:17.770> you<00:03:17.950> want<00:03:18.130> so<00:03:18.340> maybe<00:03:18.580> I

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.090 
don't know about six inches seven inches
right<00:03:23.950> so<00:03:24.310> make<00:03:24.520> it<00:03:24.700> at<00:03:24.820> that<00:03:25.090> level<00:03:26.100> alright

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.100

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:30.630 
right so make it at that level alright
so<00:03:27.670> now<00:03:27.880> that<00:03:28.770> you<00:03:29.770> have<00:03:29.920> your<00:03:30.070> second<00:03:30.520> hook

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
tied this is just an example it's about

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.340 
tied this is just an example it's about
12<00:03:34.180> or<00:03:34.420> 13<00:03:34.450> inches<00:03:35.080> away

each hook from each other this is just

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:39.690 
each hook from each other this is just
an<00:03:38.020> example<00:03:38.560> not<00:03:38.710> actually<00:03:39.100> using<00:03:39.250> this<00:03:39.490> one

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
an example not actually using this one

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.020

tight<00:05:11.040> so<00:05:11.670> the<00:05:11.820> Bell<00:05:11.970> sinker<00:05:12.330> just<00:05:12.510> sits<00:05:12.720> on

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840 
tight so the Bell sinker just sits on

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.390 
tight so the Bell sinker just sits on
the<00:05:12.960> bottom<00:05:13.080> and<00:05:13.530> all<00:05:13.950> the<00:05:14.070> hooks<00:05:14.250> are

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 
standing up nicely and then what got

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:24.230 
standing up nicely and then what got
email<00:05:20.660> what's<00:05:21.660> basically<00:05:21.870> happening<00:05:22.230> is<00:05:23.240> all

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240 
email what's basically happening is all

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.380 
email what's basically happening is all
the<00:05:24.480> hooks<00:05:24.660> are<00:05:24.810> standing<00:05:25.200> up<00:05:25.290> and<00:05:26.180> the<00:05:27.180> fish

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:27.390 
the hooks are standing up and the fish

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:30.530 
the hooks are standing up and the fish
whatever<00:05:27.750> depth<00:05:28.170> are<00:05:28.410> on<00:05:28.530> they<00:05:29.010> see<00:05:29.070> it<00:05:29.540> then

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:30.540 
whatever depth are on they see it then

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:33.950 
whatever depth are on they see it then
they<00:05:30.660> eat<00:05:30.840> it<00:05:31.910> this<00:05:32.910> the<00:05:33.240> reason<00:05:33.390> why<00:05:33.570> you<00:05:33.660> need

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:33.960 
they eat it this the reason why you need

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:35.840 
they eat it this the reason why you need
a<00:05:34.020> really<00:05:34.410> light<00:05:34.680> weight<00:05:34.710> is<00:05:35.250> so<00:05:35.490> the<00:05:35.610> perch

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:35.850 
a really light weight is so the perch

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:37.790 
a really light weight is so the perch
don't<00:05:36.210> feel<00:05:36.540> it<00:05:36.720> when<00:05:36.810> they<00:05:36.990> grab<00:05:37.260> that<00:05:37.530> Meno

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:37.800 
don't feel it when they grab that Meno

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.950 
don't feel it when they grab that Meno
you<00:05:38.400> want<00:05:38.550> them<00:05:38.670> to<00:05:38.820> take<00:05:39.090> it<00:05:39.330> until<00:05:39.840> they

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:39.960 
you want them to take it until they

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.620 
you want them to take it until they
swallow<00:05:40.380> it<00:05:40.590> and<00:05:40.620> just<00:05:40.860> set<00:05:41.040> the<00:05:41.070> hook<00:05:41.630> alright

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:42.630 
swallow it and just set the hook alright

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:45.860 
swallow it and just set the hook alright
so<00:05:43.170> with<00:05:43.560> a<00:05:43.590> couple<00:05:43.890> of<00:05:44.190> tries<00:05:44.880> you'll<00:05:45.690> get

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:45.870 
so with a couple of tries you'll get

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:48.500 
so with a couple of tries you'll get
this<00:05:46.050> perfect<00:05:46.650> depth<00:05:47.460> you<00:05:47.730> want<00:05:47.910> whatever

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:48.510 
this perfect depth you want whatever

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:51.230 
this perfect depth you want whatever
should<00:05:49.320> be<00:05:49.440> down<00:05:50.130> pat<00:05:50.490> and<00:05:50.730> you'll<00:05:51.120> be

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:51.240 
should be down pat and you'll be

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.660 
should be down pat and you'll be
catching<00:05:51.660> fish<00:05:51.930> I'd<00:05:52.680> recommend<00:05:53.250> this<00:05:53.340> over<00:05:53.640> a

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:53.670 
catching fish I'd recommend this over a

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:55.640 
catching fish I'd recommend this over a
pickerel<00:05:54.090> rig<00:05:54.420> or<00:05:54.750> a<00:05:54.780> perch<00:05:55.020> Ridge<00:05:55.290> whatever

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:55.650 
pickerel rig or a perch Ridge whatever

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:58.340 
pickerel rig or a perch Ridge whatever
