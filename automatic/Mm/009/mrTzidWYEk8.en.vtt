screws through the side we're going to

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:04.539 
screws through the side we're going to
need<00:02:01.700> a<00:02:01.759> little<00:02:01.969> help<00:02:02.289> okay<00:02:03.289> so<00:02:03.979> what<00:02:04.130> I<00:02:04.159> did<00:02:04.369> is

need a little help okay so what I did is

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:07.510 
need a little help okay so what I did is
I<00:02:04.670> use<00:02:04.909> the<00:02:05.060> C<00:02:05.270> clamp<00:02:05.570> to<00:02:06.229> pull<00:02:07.130> that<00:02:07.280> heat

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
I use the C clamp to pull that heat

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.670 
I use the C clamp to pull that heat
shield<00:02:07.549> together<00:02:08.180> and<00:02:08.479> then<00:02:09.170> you<00:02:09.320> send<00:02:09.590> your

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:09.680 
shield together and then you send your

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:13.390 
shield together and then you send your
Allen<00:02:10.009> screw<00:02:10.280> through<00:02:10.690> and<00:02:11.690> just<00:02:12.310> get<00:02:13.310> it

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
Allen screw through and just get it

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.240 
Allen screw through and just get it
started<00:02:13.910> with<00:02:14.569> one<00:02:15.019> of<00:02:15.050> the<00:02:15.230> nuts<00:02:15.560> provided<00:02:15.709> on

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250

but don't tighten them all the way down

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.630 
but don't tighten them all the way down
yet<00:02:20.500> because<00:02:20.770> we<00:02:21.040> want<00:02:21.190> to<00:02:21.250> be<00:02:21.340> able<00:02:21.400> to<00:02:21.490> move

yet because we want to be able to move
this<00:02:21.850> still<00:02:30.600> after<00:02:31.600> you<00:02:31.840> do<00:02:31.960> that<00:02:32.170> just<00:02:32.500> remove

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
this still after you do that just remove

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.830 
this still after you do that just remove
the<00:02:32.950> c-clamp<00:02:33.430> and<00:02:33.670> send<00:02:34.390> the<00:02:34.510> other<00:02:34.540> one

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
the c-clamp and send the other one

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.720 
the c-clamp and send the other one
through<00:02:35.020> you<00:02:35.260> typically<00:02:35.650> won't<00:02:36.310> need<00:02:36.580> the

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
through you typically won't need the

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:42.840 
through you typically won't need the
c-clamp<00:02:37.180> after<00:02:37.630> that<00:02:40.740> okay<00:02:41.740> as<00:02:42.010> you<00:02:42.460> can<00:02:42.490> see

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
c-clamp after that okay as you can see

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.750 
c-clamp after that okay as you can see

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:48.490 
barely started that this heat shield can

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:51.210 
barely started that this heat shield can
still<00:02:48.760> move<00:02:48.970> freely<00:02:49.270> about<00:02:49.570> the<00:02:49.900> barrel<00:02:50.260> and

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
still move freely about the barrel and

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:52.560 
still move freely about the barrel and
that's<00:02:51.340> important<00:02:51.850> for<00:02:51.940> this<00:02:52.030> next<00:02:52.330> part

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.570 
that's important for this next part

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:53.820 
that's important for this next part
we're<00:02:52.720> going<00:02:52.840> to<00:02:52.900> install<00:02:53.200> the<00:02:53.380> barrel<00:02:53.620> back

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
we're going to install the barrel back

00:02:53.830 --> 00:03:09.490 
we're going to install the barrel back
onto<00:02:54.100> the<00:02:54.310> firearm

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.350 

and<00:03:10.500> here's<00:03:11.310> the<00:03:11.490> important<00:03:11.970> part<00:03:12.210> about

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
and here's the important part about

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.260 
and here's the important part about
still<00:03:12.930> having<00:03:13.350> that<00:03:13.530> heat<00:03:14.400> shield<00:03:14.430> able<00:03:15.150> to

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.270 
still having that heat shield able to

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:17.750 
still having that heat shield able to
move<00:03:15.420> freely<00:03:15.810> as<00:03:16.140> we<00:03:16.890> place<00:03:17.130> the<00:03:17.310> barrel<00:03:17.580> back

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
move freely as we place the barrel back

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.630 
move freely as we place the barrel back
on<00:03:18.030> to<00:03:18.360> the<00:03:18.570> firearm<00:03:19.230> if<00:03:19.500> this<00:03:20.040> heat<00:03:20.250> shield<00:03:20.520> is

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
on to the firearm if this heat shield is

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.930 
on to the firearm if this heat shield is
tightened<00:03:21.060> down<00:03:21.240> and<00:03:21.570> it's<00:03:21.690> too<00:03:21.930> far<00:03:22.620> back

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
tightened down and it's too far back

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.940 
tightened down and it's too far back
it'll<00:03:23.940> prevent<00:03:24.210> the<00:03:24.450> barrel<00:03:24.870> from<00:03:25.500> seating

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
it'll prevent the barrel from seating

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.180 
it'll prevent the barrel from seating
correctly

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.290 

what<00:03:29.310> we'll<00:03:29.460> do<00:03:29.670> is<00:03:31.910> we're<00:03:32.910> going<00:03:33.000> to<00:03:33.060> make

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300 
what we'll do is we're going to make

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:38.000 
what we'll do is we're going to make
sure<00:03:33.480> that<00:03:33.630> we<00:03:33.750> push<00:03:36.140> push<00:03:37.140> that<00:03:37.350> heat<00:03:37.650> shield

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
sure that we push push that heat shield

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.560 
sure that we push push that heat shield
as<00:03:38.760> far<00:03:39.420> forward<00:03:39.690> as<00:03:39.900> we<00:03:40.080> can<00:03:40.670> and<00:03:41.670> then<00:03:42.510> make

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
as far forward as we can and then make

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:46.960 
as far forward as we can and then make
sure<00:03:42.750> that<00:03:42.930> we<00:03:43.170> seat<00:03:43.470> that<00:03:43.650> barrel<00:03:44.780> from<00:03:45.780> there

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
sure that we seat that barrel from there

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.610 
sure that we seat that barrel from there
reinstall<00:03:47.970> the<00:03:48.690> cap<00:03:48.960> on<00:03:49.260> the<00:03:49.380> end<00:03:49.500> of<00:03:49.560> the

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
reinstall the cap on the end of the

00:03:49.620 --> 00:04:03.680 
reinstall the cap on the end of the
magazine<00:03:50.100> tube<00:04:02.120> with<00:04:03.120> the<00:04:03.150> barrel<00:04:03.540> in<00:04:03.660> place

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
magazine tube with the barrel in place

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.200 
magazine tube with the barrel in place
now<00:04:04.440> you<00:04:04.500> can<00:04:04.770> just<00:04:05.070> move<00:04:05.490> your<00:04:05.640> heat<00:04:05.880> shield

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:06.210 
now you can just move your heat shield

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:07.820 
now you can just move your heat shield
into<00:04:06.600> the<00:04:06.720> position<00:04:07.140> where<00:04:07.320> you<00:04:07.350> want<00:04:07.620> it<00:04:07.740> and

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:07.830 
into the position where you want it and

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:17.240 
into the position where you want it and
then<00:04:08.220> tighten<00:04:08.610> it<00:04:08.670> down<00:04:14.750> and<00:04:15.980> then<00:04:16.980> for<00:04:17.190> the

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
then tighten it down and then for the

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.820 
then tighten it down and then for the
last<00:04:17.489> step<00:04:17.790> I'm<00:04:18.000> going<00:04:18.239> to<00:04:18.470> reinstall<00:04:19.470> my
