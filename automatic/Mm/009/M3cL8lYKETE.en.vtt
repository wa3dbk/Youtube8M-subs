fried now these are the empanadas I
fried<00:00:19.760> at<00:00:20.760> first<00:00:21.210> when<00:00:21.779> I<00:00:22.109> decided<00:00:22.920> I<00:00:23.130> would

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
fried at first when I decided I would

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.640 
fried at first when I decided I would
multitask<00:00:24.000> and<00:00:24.269> walk<00:00:24.480> away<00:00:24.750> from<00:00:24.930> my<00:00:25.109> oil<00:00:25.380> and

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
multitask and walk away from my oil and

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.560 
multitask and walk away from my oil and
let<00:00:25.859> it<00:00:25.890> get<00:00:26.130> too<00:00:26.369> hot<00:00:26.640> and<00:00:26.910> you<00:00:27.210> know<00:00:27.300> things

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
let it get too hot and you know things

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.019 
let it get too hot and you know things
like<00:00:27.660> that<00:00:28.019> deep<00:00:28.859> frying<00:00:29.099> is<00:00:29.340> definitely<00:00:29.849> not

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
like that deep frying is definitely not

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.930 
like that deep frying is definitely not
one<00:00:30.359> of<00:00:30.390> those<00:00:31.309> operations<00:00:32.309> where<00:00:32.579> you<00:00:32.730> can

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
one of those operations where you can

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.680 
one of those operations where you can
just<00:00:33.210> sit<00:00:34.050> and<00:00:34.260> wait<00:00:34.440> it<00:00:34.790> it's<00:00:35.790> boring<00:00:36.270> but<00:00:36.510> you

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
just sit and wait it it's boring but you

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.380 
just sit and wait it it's boring but you
got<00:00:36.870> to<00:00:36.989> be<00:00:37.110> present<00:00:37.590> so<00:00:38.370> at<00:00:38.670> any<00:00:38.820> rate<00:00:38.940> here

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
got to be present so at any rate here

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.709 
got to be present so at any rate here
we're<00:00:39.600> going<00:00:39.780> to<00:00:40.790> my<00:00:41.790> pot<00:00:42.120> of<00:00:42.950> preheated<00:00:43.950> oil<00:00:44.219> I

00:00:44.709 --> 00:00:44.719 
we're going to my pot of preheated oil I

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:47.869 
we're going to my pot of preheated oil I
think<00:00:45.719> it's<00:00:45.930> probably<00:00:46.170> around<00:00:46.680> 350<00:00:47.370> degrees<00:00:47.670> I

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
think it's probably around 350 degrees I

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.660 
think it's probably around 350 degrees I
know<00:00:47.940> I<00:00:48.059> said<00:00:48.360> 375<00:00:48.570> but<00:00:49.260> 350<00:00:49.800> is<00:00:50.160> probably

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
know I said 375 but 350 is probably

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.970 
know I said 375 but 350 is probably
better<00:00:50.940> and<00:00:51.300> when<00:00:52.170> you<00:00:52.289> put<00:00:52.500> your<00:00:52.649> empanada

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
better and when you put your empanada

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.610 
better and when you put your empanada
you<00:00:53.430> don't<00:00:53.579> want<00:00:53.820> it<00:00:53.940> to<00:00:54.059> sizzle<00:00:54.329> so<00:00:54.960> much<00:00:55.289> that

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
you don't want it to sizzle so much that

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.830 
you don't want it to sizzle so much that
it's<00:00:55.770> making<00:00:56.010> huge<00:00:56.610> bubbles<00:00:57.149> that<00:00:57.390> you<00:00:57.539> do

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
it's making huge bubbles that you do

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.950 
it's making huge bubbles that you do
want<00:00:58.260> some<00:00:58.980> sizzle<00:00:59.489> when<00:01:00.329> you<00:01:00.480> put<00:01:00.780> the

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
want some sizzle when you put the

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.329 
want some sizzle when you put the
empanada<00:01:01.379> in<00:01:02.960> because<00:01:03.960> if<00:01:04.229> it's<00:01:04.409> not<00:01:04.530> sizzling

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
empanada in because if it's not sizzling

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.149 
empanada in because if it's not sizzling
or<00:01:05.640> bubbling<00:01:06.180> like<00:01:06.450> that<00:01:06.720> when<00:01:07.530> you<00:01:07.650> put<00:01:07.680> it<00:01:07.979> in

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
or bubbling like that when you put it in

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.120 
or bubbling like that when you put it in
that<00:01:09.060> means<00:01:09.479> that<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:10.200> crust<00:01:10.530> isn't<00:01:10.799> being

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
that means that the crust isn't being

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.070 
that means that the crust isn't being
formed<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:11.880> this<00:01:12.030> goes<00:01:12.270> for<00:01:12.510> anything<00:01:12.750> that's

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
formed and this goes for anything that's

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.469 
formed and this goes for anything that's
deep<00:01:13.320> frying<00:01:13.560> crust<00:01:14.310> isn't<00:01:14.520> being<00:01:14.790> formed<00:01:15.270> and

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
deep frying crust isn't being formed and

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.080 
deep frying crust isn't being formed and
your<00:01:15.810> food<00:01:16.080> is<00:01:16.350> absorbing<00:01:17.100> all<00:01:17.369> kinds<00:01:18.240> of<00:01:18.330> oil

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
your food is absorbing all kinds of oil

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.810 
your food is absorbing all kinds of oil
I'm<00:01:21.090> doing<00:01:21.509> four<00:01:21.810> at<00:01:21.930> a<00:01:22.049> time<00:01:22.290> and<00:01:22.770> these<00:01:23.670> are

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
I'm doing four at a time and these are

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.260 
I'm doing four at a time and these are
taking<00:01:24.270> me<00:01:24.450> about<00:01:25.009> three<00:01:26.270> three-and-a-half

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
taking me about three three-and-a-half

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.310 
taking me about three three-and-a-half
minutes<00:01:27.840> per<00:01:28.140> side<00:01:28.439> and<00:01:29.180> I'm<00:01:30.180> doing<00:01:30.750> kind<00:01:31.110> of<00:01:31.229> a

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
minutes per side and I'm doing kind of a

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.670 
minutes per side and I'm doing kind of a
shallow<00:01:31.590> fry<00:01:32.070> it's<00:01:32.640> about<00:01:32.939> an<00:01:33.210> inch<00:01:33.329> of<00:01:33.750> oil<00:01:34.259> or

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
shallow fry it's about an inch of oil or

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.380 
shallow fry it's about an inch of oil or
an<00:01:34.799> inch<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:35.040> a<00:01:35.130> half<00:01:35.159> maybe<00:01:35.250> three<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:36.119> four

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
an inch and a half maybe three to four

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.859 
an inch and a half maybe three to four
cups<00:01:36.689> so<00:01:37.680> I<00:01:37.979> have<00:01:38.400> to<00:01:38.579> keep<00:01:38.790> it<00:01:39.000> moving<00:01:39.180> if<00:01:39.720> I

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
cups so I have to keep it moving if I

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.120 
cups so I have to keep it moving if I
don't<00:01:40.140> keep<00:01:40.409> it<00:01:40.590> moving<00:01:41.040> it<00:01:41.850> is<00:01:42.680> it's<00:01:43.680> going<00:01:44.009> to

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
don't keep it moving it is it's going to

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.600 
don't keep it moving it is it's going to
get<00:01:44.280> burn<00:01:44.820> spots

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
get burn spots

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.950 
get burn spots
so<00:01:47.610> just<00:01:48.000> put<00:01:48.420> a<00:01:48.450> man<00:01:48.690> set<00:01:49.200> your<00:01:49.380> timer<00:01:49.710> to

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
so just put a man set your timer to

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.219 
so just put a man set your timer to
about<00:01:51.960> three<00:01:52.350> minutes<00:01:52.530> at<00:01:53.010> first<00:01:53.340> and<00:01:54.229> keep

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
about three minutes at first and keep

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.260 
about three minutes at first and keep
them<00:01:55.440> moving<00:01:56.240> if<00:01:57.240> you<00:01:57.450> have<00:01:57.720> a<00:01:57.960> fried<00:01:58.440> daddy

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
them moving if you have a fried daddy

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.310 
them moving if you have a fried daddy
then<00:02:00.270> of<00:02:00.540> course<00:02:00.750> you're<00:02:00.930> going<00:02:01.080> to<00:02:01.200> be

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
then of course you're going to be

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.960 
then of course you're going to be
completely<00:02:01.979> immersing<00:02:02.460> it<00:02:02.550> you<00:02:02.700> don't<00:02:02.880> have

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
completely immersing it you don't have

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.780 
completely immersing it you don't have
to<00:02:03.210> flip<00:02:03.450> it<00:02:03.509> it'll<00:02:04.200> probably<00:02:04.650> be<00:02:05.160> about<00:02:05.340> three

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
to flip it it'll probably be about three

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.219 
to flip it it'll probably be about three
minutes<00:02:05.940> total<00:02:06.360> and<00:02:06.600> you<00:02:06.750> don't<00:02:06.960> have<00:02:07.110> to

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
minutes total and you don't have to

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.889 
minutes total and you don't have to
worry<00:02:07.410> about<00:02:07.610> the<00:02:08.610> burning<00:02:08.850> because<00:02:09.300> it's<00:02:09.630> not

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
worry about the burning because it's not

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.790 
worry about the burning because it's not
touching<00:02:10.860> it's<00:02:11.700> not<00:02:12.030> making<00:02:12.300> direct<00:02:12.800> contact

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
touching it's not making direct contact

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.210 
touching it's not making direct contact
with<00:02:13.890> the<00:02:14.400> heating<00:02:14.790> surface<00:02:15.650> so<00:02:16.650> just<00:02:16.890> keep<00:02:17.069> it

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
with the heating surface so just keep it

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.280 
with the heating surface so just keep it
moving<00:02:17.550> around<00:02:17.790> and<00:02:18.330> for<00:02:18.690> those<00:02:18.810> of<00:02:18.870> you<00:02:19.140> who

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
moving around and for those of you who

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.960 
moving around and for those of you who
already<00:02:19.380> know<00:02:19.650> how<00:02:19.680> to<00:02:19.830> deep-fry<00:02:20.130> even<00:02:20.790> for

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
already know how to deep-fry even for

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.790 
already know how to deep-fry even for
those<00:02:21.090> of<00:02:21.270> you<00:02:21.390> who<00:02:21.630> don't<00:02:21.930> or<00:02:22.260> you<00:02:22.560> know<00:02:22.650> a

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
those of you who don't or you know a

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.750 
those of you who don't or you know a
shallow<00:02:23.310> fry<00:02:23.640> whatever<00:02:24.320> this<00:02:25.320> for<00:02:25.890> this<00:02:26.489> video

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
shallow fry whatever this for this video

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.970 
shallow fry whatever this for this video
is<00:02:27.060> probably<00:02:27.840> going<00:02:28.050> to<00:02:28.200> bore<00:02:28.410> you<00:02:28.590> to<00:02:28.769> tears

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
is probably going to bore you to tears

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.940 
is probably going to bore you to tears
but<00:02:29.400> I<00:02:29.459> do<00:02:29.580> want<00:02:29.970> to<00:02:30.030> show<00:02:30.269> you<00:02:30.330> how<00:02:30.840> to<00:02:31.320> just

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
but I do want to show you how to just

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:41.509 
but I do want to show you how to just
keep<00:02:32.850> it<00:02:33.000> going<00:02:34.160> so<00:02:35.160> that<00:02:36.350> it's<00:02:38.120> not<00:02:40.160> it's<00:02:41.160> so

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
keep it going so that it's not it's so

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:43.220 
keep it going so that it's not it's so
it<00:02:41.640> doesn't<00:02:41.910> get<00:02:42.000> a<00:02:42.030> burn<00:02:42.269> spot<00:02:42.420> obviously<00:02:43.200> I

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
it doesn't get a burn spot obviously I

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.140 
it doesn't get a burn spot obviously I
can't<00:02:43.830> tape<00:02:44.280> and<00:02:44.580> talk<00:02:44.790> at<00:02:45.000> the<00:02:45.120> same<00:02:45.269> time

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
can't tape and talk at the same time

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.520 
can't tape and talk at the same time
okay<00:02:48.150> this<00:02:48.360> has<00:02:48.480> been<00:02:48.660> going<00:02:49.019> I<00:02:49.110> think<00:02:49.320> for

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
okay this has been going I think for

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.789 
okay this has been going I think for
about<00:02:49.739> a<00:02:50.190> minute<00:02:51.000> or<00:02:51.360> so<00:02:51.840> it's<00:02:52.350> going<00:02:52.530> to<00:02:52.590> need

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799 
about a minute or so it's going to need

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:54.740 
about a minute or so it's going to need
another<00:02:52.980> couple<00:02:53.489> minutes<00:02:53.850> and<00:02:54.090> you're<00:02:54.720> going

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
another couple minutes and you're going

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.190 
another couple minutes and you're going
to<00:02:54.930> need<00:02:55.170> to<00:02:55.290> just<00:02:55.560> keep<00:02:55.829> it<00:02:56.070> moving<00:02:56.930> you<00:02:57.930> could

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
to need to just keep it moving you could

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.069 
to need to just keep it moving you could
just<00:02:59.040> flip<00:02:59.579> it<00:02:59.610> over<00:02:59.910> and<00:03:00.150> then<00:03:00.510> flip<00:03:00.840> it<00:03:00.930> over

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:01.079 
just flip it over and then flip it over

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:05.840 
just flip it over and then flip it over
but<00:03:01.590> for<00:03:02.100> purposes<00:03:02.400> of<00:03:02.670> timing<00:03:04.400> it's<00:03:05.400> easier

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
but for purposes of timing it's easier

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.030 
but for purposes of timing it's easier
just<00:03:05.940> to<00:03:06.209> keep<00:03:06.450> it<00:03:06.630> on<00:03:06.720> one<00:03:06.989> side<00:03:07.290> so<00:03:07.650> you<00:03:07.709> know

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
just to keep it on one side so you know

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.039 
just to keep it on one side so you know
how<00:03:08.280> long<00:03:08.459> you've<00:03:08.640> kept<00:03:08.880> it<00:03:08.970> on<00:03:09.090> that<00:03:09.299> side<00:03:09.570> for

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049 
how long you've kept it on that side for

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:11.420 
how long you've kept it on that side for
people<00:03:10.380> who<00:03:10.470> are<00:03:10.560> just<00:03:10.680> kind<00:03:10.829> of<00:03:10.950> new<00:03:11.130> to<00:03:11.310> it

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
people who are just kind of new to it

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.240 
people who are just kind of new to it
and<00:03:11.579> don't<00:03:11.790> know<00:03:12.000> and<00:03:12.329> don't<00:03:13.290> yet<00:03:13.530> get<00:03:14.100> the

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
and don't know and don't yet get the

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.199 
and don't know and don't yet get the
feel<00:03:14.519> of<00:03:14.549> how<00:03:14.850> to<00:03:14.910> fry<00:03:15.209> these<00:03:15.269> things<00:03:15.750> so<00:03:17.209> we're

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
feel of how to fry these things so we're

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.030 
feel of how to fry these things so we're
going<00:03:18.450> probably<00:03:18.810> about<00:03:19.079> on<00:03:19.230> a<00:03:19.440> minute<00:03:19.890> and<00:03:20.010> a

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
going probably about on a minute and a

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:28.500 
going probably about on a minute and a
half<00:03:20.070> now<00:03:20.670> I'm<00:03:21.420> going<00:03:21.570> to<00:03:21.660> set<00:03:21.840> the<00:03:21.959> timer

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.449 

for<00:03:29.510> another<00:03:29.660> minute<00:03:29.959> and<00:03:30.110> a<00:03:30.200> half<00:03:30.349> and<00:03:30.830> we're

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
for another minute and a half and we're

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:33.699 
for another minute and a half and we're
just<00:03:31.700> going<00:03:31.880> to<00:03:31.940> sit<00:03:32.239> here<00:03:32.540> and<00:03:32.780> watch<00:03:33.290> these

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:33.709 
just going to sit here and watch these

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:44.949 
just going to sit here and watch these
empanadas<00:03:34.580> fry<00:03:37.239> fascinating<00:03:38.239> isn't<00:03:38.569> it

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:47.440 

and<00:03:45.500> I'll<00:03:45.620> just<00:03:45.799> show<00:03:46.040> you<00:03:46.069> until<00:03:46.519> we<00:03:46.909> flip<00:03:47.209> and

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
and I'll just show you until we flip and

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:49.720 
and I'll just show you until we flip and
you'll<00:03:47.569> see<00:03:47.870> at<00:03:48.560> that<00:03:48.739> point<00:03:49.069> how<00:03:49.219> brown<00:03:49.489> they

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:49.730 
you'll see at that point how brown they

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.429 
you'll see at that point how brown they
get<00:03:49.939> and<00:03:50.150> this<00:03:50.269> is<00:03:50.329> about<00:03:50.689> the<00:03:50.750> temperature<00:03:51.349> at

00:03:51.429 --> 00:03:51.439 
get and this is about the temperature at

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:53.860 
get and this is about the temperature at
which<00:03:51.560> you<00:03:51.890> want<00:03:52.430> to<00:03:52.609> fry<00:03:52.849> I'm<00:03:53.299> not<00:03:53.569> a<00:03:53.599> very

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
which you want to fry I'm not a very

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:56.229 
which you want to fry I'm not a very
precise<00:03:54.379> cook<00:03:54.769> I<00:03:54.950> don't<00:03:55.219> often<00:03:55.519> use<00:03:55.730> things

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 
precise cook I don't often use things

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:58.360 
precise cook I don't often use things
like<00:03:56.390> thermometers<00:03:56.900> and<00:03:57.469> in<00:03:57.829> the<00:03:57.980> end<00:03:58.129> I<00:03:58.310> think

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
like thermometers and in the end I think

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:00.699 
like thermometers and in the end I think
it's<00:03:58.640> kind<00:03:58.849> of<00:03:58.909> better<00:03:59.120> for<00:03:59.900> people<00:04:00.230> to<00:04:00.469> know

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
it's kind of better for people to know

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:05.619 
it's kind of better for people to know
how<00:04:00.980> to<00:04:01.040> get<00:04:01.310> a<00:04:01.489> feel<00:04:02.019> for<00:04:04.239> what<00:04:05.239> is<00:04:05.389> the<00:04:05.599> right

00:04:05.619 --> 00:04:05.629 
how to get a feel for what is the right

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:07.809 
how to get a feel for what is the right
temperature<00:04:06.409> what<00:04:06.889> is<00:04:07.040> the<00:04:07.069> right<00:04:07.340> technique

00:04:07.809 --> 00:04:07.819 
temperature what is the right technique

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:10.479 
temperature what is the right technique
by<00:04:08.180> looking<00:04:09.079> at<00:04:09.319> the<00:04:09.680> product<00:04:10.099> and<00:04:10.310> and

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:10.489 
by looking at the product and and

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:12.849 
by looking at the product and and
knowing<00:04:11.090> when<00:04:11.540> it<00:04:11.659> looks<00:04:11.989> right<00:04:12.230> feels<00:04:12.650> right

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:12.859 
knowing when it looks right feels right

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:17.340 
knowing when it looks right feels right
smells<00:04:13.280> right

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:17.350 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:22.510 

what<00:04:18.350> is<00:04:18.530> going<00:04:18.860> on<00:04:19.010> over<00:04:19.310> there<00:04:19.610> oh<00:04:21.280> my<00:04:22.280> god

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.350 

and<00:04:29.350> just<00:04:29.590> keep<00:04:29.800> it<00:04:29.919> moving<00:04:30.250> so<00:04:30.760> you<00:04:30.820> don't<00:04:31.210> get

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
and just keep it moving so you don't get

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.900 
and just keep it moving so you don't get
too<00:04:31.570> much<00:04:31.750> of<00:04:31.780> our<00:04:32.080> brown<00:04:32.320> spot<00:04:32.710> and<00:04:33.010> here<00:04:33.730> you

can see pretty nice and even unlike

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:52.530 
can see pretty nice and even unlike
these<00:04:40.919> these<00:04:41.919> are<00:04:42.130> doing<00:04:42.370> better

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:52.540

you're doing there goes the timer let's

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.660 
you're doing there goes the timer let's
see<00:05:01.390> how<00:05:01.630> we<00:05:01.690> did<00:05:01.930> it<00:05:02.050> three<00:05:02.230> minutes<00:05:02.670> it's

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:03.670 
see how we did it three minutes it's

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:06.750 
see how we did it three minutes it's
nice<00:05:03.910> and<00:05:04.120> golden-brown<00:05:05.220> I'm<00:05:06.220> going<00:05:06.550> to<00:05:06.610> let

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:06.760 
nice and golden-brown I'm going to let

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:12.600 
nice and golden-brown I'm going to let
it<00:05:06.880> go<00:05:07.000> maybe<00:05:07.240> another<00:05:07.710> 20<00:05:08.710> seconds<00:05:11.400> before<00:05:12.400> I

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:12.610 
it go maybe another 20 seconds before I

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:14.340 
it go maybe another 20 seconds before I
flip<00:05:12.910> them<00:05:13.120> and<00:05:13.390> do<00:05:13.540> the<00:05:13.690> same<00:05:13.870> thing<00:05:14.080> on<00:05:14.200> the

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:14.350 
flip them and do the same thing on the

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:16.710 
flip them and do the same thing on the
other<00:05:14.380> side<00:05:14.560> so<00:05:15.190> that<00:05:15.220> was<00:05:15.490> probably<00:05:15.910> just

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:16.720 
other side so that was probably just

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.150 
other side so that was probably just
like<00:05:16.900> I<00:05:16.960> said<00:05:17.260> about<00:05:17.470> three<00:05:17.800> and<00:05:17.920> a<00:05:17.980> half

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:18.160 
like I said about three and a half

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.580 
like I said about three and a half
minutes<00:05:18.610> these<00:05:19.240> empanadas<00:05:19.810> have<00:05:19.990> been<00:05:20.170> in<00:05:20.410> the

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:23.710 
freezer you know for at least a good 10

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:25.440 
freezer you know for at least a good 10
minutes<00:05:23.740> for<00:05:24.370> the<00:05:24.520> dough<00:05:24.730> to<00:05:24.790> set<00:05:25.270> before

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:25.450 
minutes for the dough to set before

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:28.560 
minutes for the dough to set before
frying<00:05:25.960> and<00:05:26.290> if<00:05:26.980> you<00:05:27.160> want<00:05:27.400> to<00:05:27.670> bake<00:05:28.000> them<00:05:28.300> it's
