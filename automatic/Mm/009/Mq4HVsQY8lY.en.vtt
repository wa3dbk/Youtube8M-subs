it didn't take me long to call them

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:33.730 
it didn't take me long to call them
because<00:05:29.090> because<00:05:29.990> the<00:05:31.180> Infinity<00:05:32.229> core<00:05:33.229> secret

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:33.740 
because because the Infinity core secret

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:36.189 
because because the Infinity core secret
here<00:05:34.039> was<00:05:34.490> my<00:05:34.759> secret<00:05:35.000> weapon<00:05:35.539> to<00:05:35.719> cut<00:05:36.020> my

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:40.370 
curling time in half and so either I can

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:41.980 
curling time in half and so either I can
just<00:05:40.610> lose<00:05:40.819> them<00:05:41.060> leave<00:05:41.330> them<00:05:41.569> loose<00:05:41.719> like

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:41.990 
just lose them leave them loose like

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:45.550 
just lose them leave them loose like

00:05:55.029 --> 00:05:55.039 
like right there and at this point I'm

00:05:55.039 --> 00:05:57.339 
like right there and at this point I'm
not<00:05:55.189> using<00:05:55.400> any<00:05:55.669> brush<00:05:56.330> or<00:05:56.569> comb<00:05:56.900> or<00:05:57.169> anything

don't<00:06:00.849> open<00:06:01.849> and<00:06:02.150> I<00:06:03.009> just<00:06:04.120> use<00:06:05.120> a<00:06:05.300> little<00:06:05.389> pin

00:06:05.709 --> 00:06:05.719 
don't open and I just use a little pin

00:06:05.719 --> 00:06:09.010 
don't open and I just use a little pin
like<00:06:05.900> that<00:06:06.460> so<00:06:07.460> it's<00:06:07.580> just<00:06:07.759> like<00:06:07.969> a<00:06:08.000> little<00:06:08.360> up

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:09.020 
like that so it's just like a little up

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:13.990 
like that so it's just like a little up
-<00:06:09.500> down<00:06:10.069> -<00:06:10.430> together<00:06:11.860> or<00:06:12.860> there's<00:06:13.460> another<00:06:13.729> way

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:14.000 
- down - together or there's another way

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.320 
- down - together or there's another way
I<00:06:14.029> do<00:06:14.180> usually<00:06:14.509> when<00:06:14.930> I<00:06:15.050> call<00:06:15.259> my<00:06:15.469> hair<00:06:16.330> these

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:17.330 
I do usually when I call my hair these

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:20.399 
I do usually when I call my hair these
twisty<00:06:17.900> little<00:06:18.169> pins<00:06:18.409> you<00:06:18.650> see<00:06:18.830> right<00:06:19.009> there

00:06:20.399 --> 00:06:20.409 
twisty little pins you see right there

00:06:20.409 --> 00:06:23.409 
twisty little pins you see right there
yeah<00:06:21.409> so<00:06:21.650> it's<00:06:21.800> like<00:06:21.919> they<00:06:22.909> go<00:06:23.089> in<00:06:23.210> one

00:06:23.409 --> 00:06:23.419 
yeah so it's like they go in one

00:06:23.419 --> 00:06:24.939 
yeah so it's like they go in one
direction<00:06:23.569> and<00:06:24.080> they<00:06:24.199> go<00:06:24.349> inside<00:06:24.650> like<00:06:24.919> a

00:06:24.939 --> 00:06:24.949 
direction and they go inside like a

00:06:24.949 --> 00:06:27.999 
direction and they go inside like a
screw<00:06:25.370> I<00:06:25.879> think<00:06:26.659> these<00:06:26.750> are<00:06:26.900> also<00:06:27.080> corneal<00:06:27.860> and

00:06:27.999 --> 00:06:28.009 
screw I think these are also corneal and

00:06:28.009 --> 00:06:31.829 
screw I think these are also corneal and
I<00:06:28.099> got<00:06:28.310> them<00:06:28.580> from<00:06:29.089> a<00:06:29.180> dog<00:06:29.509> store<00:06:29.810> I<00:06:30.080> guess<00:06:30.699> but

00:06:31.829 --> 00:06:31.839 
I got them from a dog store I guess but

00:06:31.839 --> 00:06:37.619
