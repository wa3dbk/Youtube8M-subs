00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.110 
on the opposite of the table so they are

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.140 
on the opposite of the table so they are
really<00:01:03.260> facing<00:01:03.620> the<00:01:04.159> area<00:01:04.370> like<00:01:04.550> blowing<00:01:05.000> up

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.080 

that's<00:01:11.210> why<00:01:11.390> a<00:01:11.420> lot<00:01:11.570> of<00:01:11.800> a<00:01:12.800> live<00:01:13.430> chat<00:01:13.700> is<00:01:13.880> used

counter-strike by the way is still
ongoing<00:02:57.420> as<00:02:57.810> well<00:02:57.989> and<00:02:58.680> it's<00:02:59.519> already<00:02:59.849> in<00:03:00.000> its

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
ongoing as well and it's already in its

tournament has two group stages so

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.229 
tournament has two group stages so
really<00:03:06.569> a<00:03:06.599> lot<00:03:06.840> of<00:03:06.959> matches<00:03:07.640> are<00:03:08.640> getting<00:03:08.969> laid

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
their effect that the determinant

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.470 
their effect that the determinant
probably<00:03:13.530> could<00:03:13.709> not<00:03:13.889> afford<00:03:14.219> given<00:03:15.150> the

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
probably could not afford given the

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:21.110 
probably could not afford given the
