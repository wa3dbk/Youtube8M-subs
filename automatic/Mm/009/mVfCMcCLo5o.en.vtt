00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.400 
and flow i think we've got these huge
phones<00:00:37.790> now<00:00:38.000> i<00:00:38.210> think<00:00:38.240> would<00:00:38.900> not<00:00:39.079> surprise<00:00:39.379> me

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410

phones now i think would not surprise me
in<00:00:39.590> the<00:00:39.649> least<00:00:39.739> in<00:00:40.039> the<00:00:40.129> next<00:00:40.340> year<00:00:40.520> or<00:00:40.550> two<00:00:40.610> if

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820 
in the least in the next year or two if

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.340 
in the least in the next year or two if
we<00:00:40.910> see<00:00:41.059> them<00:00:41.239> shrink<00:00:41.539> back<00:00:41.690> to<00:00:41.840> a<00:00:41.870> more

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
we see them shrink back to a more

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.260 
we see them shrink back to a more
manageable<00:00:42.410> size<00:00:43.010> but<00:00:43.699> i<00:00:43.730> remember<00:00:44.090> my<00:00:44.210> very

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:44.270 
manageable size but i remember my very

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:45.639 
manageable size but i remember my very
first<00:00:44.600> time<00:00:44.719> in<00:00:44.870> New<00:00:44.930> York<00:00:45.140> for<00:00:45.260> this<00:00:45.350> business

00:00:45.639 --> 00:00:45.649 
first time in New York for this business

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:48.010 
first time in New York for this business
was<00:00:45.800> for<00:00:46.010> a<00:00:46.039> 4.3<00:00:46.670> inch<00:00:46.789> phone<00:00:47.030> and<00:00:47.270> that<00:00:47.870> was

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:48.020 
was for a 4.3 inch phone and that was

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:49.779 
was for a 4.3 inch phone and that was
considered<00:00:48.440> huge<00:00:48.829> now<00:00:49.190> it's<00:00:49.399> considered

00:00:49.779 --> 00:00:49.789 
considered huge now it's considered

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:52.389 
considered huge now it's considered
small<00:00:50.090> so<00:00:50.420> I<00:00:50.600> think<00:00:51.079> there<00:00:51.410> is<00:00:51.440> some<00:00:51.949> room<00:00:52.160> for

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:52.399 
small so I think there is some room for

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:53.830 
small so I think there is some room for
adjustment<00:00:52.489> there<00:00:53.059> and<00:00:53.269> you<00:00:53.329> will<00:00:53.480> see<00:00:53.750> it

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:53.840 
adjustment there and you will see it

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.810 
adjustment there and you will see it
kind<00:00:53.989> of<00:00:54.109> wax<00:00:54.440> and<00:00:54.680> wane<00:00:54.829> with<00:00:54.890> you<00:00:55.280> toward<00:00:55.730> the

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:25.940 
the future we can't working on it so you

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.220

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:29.300 
we're not going to know it's a risk I

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.510 
we're not going to know it's a risk I
always<00:01:29.690> say<00:01:29.840> actually<00:01:30.140> the<00:01:30.290> biggest<00:01:30.680> issue

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:45.550 
it two technologies have surely evolved
in<00:01:44.120> three<00:01:44.330> years<00:01:44.570> and<00:01:44.840> yet<00:01:45.110> where<00:01:45.290> are<00:01:45.410> they

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
in three years and yet where are they

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.080 
in three years and yet where are they
today<00:01:45.710> there's<00:01:46.250> a<00:01:46.310> lot<00:01:46.340> of<00:01:46.490> companies<00:01:46.880> i<00:01:46.940> can

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
today there's a lot of companies i can

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:48.850 
today there's a lot of companies i can
put<00:01:47.240> technology<00:01:47.450> into<00:01:48.050> phones<00:01:48.290> but<00:01:48.500> not<00:01:48.650> many

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
put technology into phones but not many

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.500 
put technology into phones but not many
are<00:01:48.950> making<00:01:49.310> a<00:01:49.460> product<00:01:50.030> that<00:01:50.270> actually

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:50.510 
are making a product that actually

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:51.700 
are making a product that actually
people<00:01:50.840> want<00:01:51.080> to<00:01:51.170> use<00:01:51.410> with<00:01:51.590> those

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
people want to use with those

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.710 
people want to use with those
technologies<00:01:52.070> like<00:01:52.700> 3d<00:01:53.120> phones<00:01:53.390> or

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
technologies like 3d phones or

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.810 
technologies like 3d phones or
biometrics<00:01:54.530> it's<00:01:54.740> just<00:01:54.920> it's<00:01:55.160> there<00:01:55.430> to<00:01:55.640> be

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
biometrics it's just it's there to be

biometrics it's just it's there to be
there<00:01:56.060> it's<00:01:56.210> not<00:01:56.300> there<00:01:56.360> to<00:01:56.660> start<00:01:56.840> I<00:01:56.900> tell<00:01:57.110> you

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:57.230 
there it's not there to start I tell you

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:00.910 
there it's not there to start I tell you

we're at least wireless charging I
understand<00:02:13.160> that<00:02:13.489> the<00:02:13.940> mobile<00:02:14.599> industry

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
understand that the mobile industry

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.200 
understand that the mobile industry
can't<00:02:15.500> invent<00:02:15.920> an

better battery technology the whole
world<00:02:18.160> is<00:02:18.370> is<00:02:18.580> toying<00:02:19.360> with<00:02:19.600> that<00:02:19.690> but<00:02:19.990> we<00:02:20.140> have

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
world is is toying with that but we have

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.050 
world is is toying with that but we have
wireless<00:02:21.750> charging<00:02:22.750> technology<00:02:23.280> why<00:02:24.280> Phil<00:02:24.760> is

wireless charging technology why Phil is
it<00:02:25.210> not<00:02:25.450> in<00:02:25.480> every<00:02:26.170> phone<00:02:26.440> it's<00:02:27.340> there<00:02:28.030> are

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:28.210 
it not in every phone it's there are

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:31.260 
it not in every phone it's there are
standards<00:02:28.750> here<00:02:29.020> and<00:02:29.170> like<00:02:29.890> any<00:02:30.130> product<00:02:31.090> out

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
standards here and like any product out

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.150 
standards here and like any product out
there<00:02:31.450> the<00:02:31.630> standards<00:02:32.080> don't<00:02:32.260> always<00:02:32.770> match

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
there the standards don't always match

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.790 
there the standards don't always match
and<00:02:33.550> there's<00:02:34.300> a<00:02:34.390> lot<00:02:34.570> of<00:02:34.630> money<00:02:34.780> from<00:02:35.440> certain

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
and there's a lot of money from certain

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.680 
and there's a lot of money from certain
companies<00:02:36.190> giving<00:02:36.790> money<00:02:37.000> to<00:02:37.090> other<00:02:37.300> certain

companies giving money to other certain
companies<00:02:38.050> to<00:02:38.200> use<00:02:38.230> their<00:02:38.530> product<00:02:38.980> and<00:02:39.070> maybe

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
companies to use their product and maybe

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:40.950 
companies to use their product and maybe
that's<00:02:39.790> not<00:02:39.910> where<00:02:40.090> the<00:02:40.210> market<00:02:40.540> went<00:02:40.750> and

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:40.960 
that's not where the market went and

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.660 
that's not where the market went and
unfortunately<00:02:41.620> that's<00:02:41.800> just<00:02:42.280> the<00:02:42.400> way<00:02:42.520> it<00:02:42.640> is

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
unfortunately that's just the way it is

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.210 
unfortunately that's just the way it is
let's<00:02:43.300> move<00:02:43.510> on<00:02:43.720> from<00:02:43.960> Hardware<00:02:44.560> cuz<00:02:44.920> we<00:02:45.100> got

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
let's move on from Hardware cuz we got

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.820 
let's move on from Hardware cuz we got
it<00:02:45.340> I<00:02:45.940> know<00:02:46.030> hardware's<00:02:46.660> a<00:02:46.720> great<00:02:46.990> topic<00:02:47.290> but

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
it I know hardware's a great topic but

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:49.830 
it I know hardware's a great topic but
we<00:02:48.190> also<00:02:48.340> got<00:02:48.580> to<00:02:48.670> talk<00:02:48.820> about<00:02:48.940> software<00:02:49.450> since

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
we also got to talk about software since

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.420 
we also got to talk about software since
it's<00:02:49.990> what<00:02:50.140> we<00:02:50.260> use<00:02:50.290> every<00:02:51.010> day<00:02:51.040> we<00:02:51.250> want<00:02:51.370> to

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
it's what we use every day we want to

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:52.650 
it's what we use every day we want to
look<00:02:51.520> at<00:02:51.580> the<00:02:51.670> future<00:02:51.940> you<00:02:52.180> kind<00:02:52.420> of<00:02:52.480> gotta

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
look at the future you kind of gotta

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.990 
look at the future you kind of gotta
look<00:02:52.810> at<00:02:52.960> the<00:02:52.990> past<00:02:53.290> I<00:02:53.560> think<00:02:53.800> and<00:02:53.980> look<00:02:54.850> what

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
look at the past I think and look what

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.670 
look at the past I think and look what
Apple<00:02:55.270> did<00:02:55.360> with<00:02:55.480> the<00:02:55.570> first<00:02:55.720> iphone<00:02:55.960> they

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
Apple did with the first iphone they

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.530 
Apple did with the first iphone they
made<00:02:56.890> a<00:02:56.920> smartphone<00:02:57.580> and<00:02:57.820> their<00:02:58.090> smartphones

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
made a smartphone and their smartphones

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.630 
made a smartphone and their smartphones
before<00:02:58.900> that<00:02:59.080> but<00:03:00.070> you<00:03:00.130> kinda<00:03:00.340> had<00:03:00.430> to<00:03:00.460> be<00:03:00.610> a

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
before that but you kinda had to be a

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.490 
before that but you kinda had to be a
smart<00:03:00.910> person<00:03:01.090> to<00:03:01.330> use<00:03:01.450> earlier<00:03:02.050> smartphones

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
smart person to use earlier smartphones

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.100 
smart person to use earlier smartphones
right<00:03:02.830> apple<00:03:03.820> with<00:03:03.910> the<00:03:04.240> iphone<00:03:04.570> creates<00:03:04.990> a

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
right apple with the iphone creates a

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.290 
right apple with the iphone creates a
phone<00:03:05.320> that<00:03:05.650> a<00:03:05.920> three-year-old<00:03:06.760> can<00:03:06.910> use<00:03:07.060> an

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:07.300 
phone that a three-year-old can use an

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.390 
phone that a three-year-old can use an
83<00:03:07.690> year<00:03:07.750> old<00:03:07.840> Cajun<00:03:08.140> empowered<00:03:08.800> users<00:03:09.100> versus

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
83 year old Cajun empowered users versus

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.310 
83 year old Cajun empowered users versus
powered<00:03:09.700> you<00:03:09.820> exactly<00:03:10.360> but<00:03:10.510> now<00:03:10.720> how<00:03:11.260> many

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320 
powered you exactly but now how many

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.350 
powered you exactly but now how many
years<00:03:11.680> later<00:03:11.830> right<00:03:12.310> yeah<00:03:12.640> five<00:03:13.000> years<00:03:13.270> is

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
years later right yeah five years is

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.880 
years later right yeah five years is
basically<00:03:14.170> the<00:03:14.290> same<00:03:14.440> thing<00:03:14.710> and<00:03:14.800> they

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
basically the same thing and they

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.100 
basically the same thing and they
haven't<00:03:15.160> evolved<00:03:15.580> it<00:03:15.670> at<00:03:15.790> all<00:03:15.910> but<00:03:16.150> why<00:03:16.330> my

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.110 
haven't evolved it at all but why my

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.290 
haven't evolved it at all but why my
mother<00:03:17.530> the<00:03:17.860> ipad<00:03:18.340> is<00:03:18.370> the<00:03:18.580> best<00:03:18.850> computer

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:19.300 
mother the ipad is the best computer

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.060 
mother the ipad is the best computer
she's<00:03:19.450> ever<00:03:19.630> owned<00:03:19.870> an<00:03:20.050> ipad<00:03:20.500> can't<00:03:20.830> do<00:03:20.950> as

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.070 
she's ever owned an ipad can't do as

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:22.830 
she's ever owned an ipad can't do as
much<00:03:21.100> as<00:03:21.280> a<00:03:21.430> mac<00:03:21.670> but<00:03:22.120> she<00:03:22.300> can<00:03:22.450> do<00:03:22.570> so<00:03:22.600> much

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
desktop OS eventually on the phone i

positioned<00:03:37.150> to<00:03:37.750> do<00:03:37.960> this<00:03:38.080> and<00:03:38.290> maybe<00:03:38.710> google

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640
