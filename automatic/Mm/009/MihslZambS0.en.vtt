now the beauty of a 12-meter single of

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:47.650 
now the beauty of a 12-meter single of
course<00:01:45.250> all<00:01:46.250> the<00:01:46.340> 7-inch<00:01:46.790> of<00:01:47.300> any<00:01:47.450> one

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:47.660 
course all the 7-inch of any one

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.070 
course all the 7-inch of any one
measurements<00:01:48.110> confused<00:01:49.660> is<00:01:50.660> that<00:01:50.870> you<00:01:50.960> can

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080 
measurements confused is that you can

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.810 
measurements confused is that you can
actually<00:01:51.230> find<00:01:53.650> an<00:01:54.650> approximation<00:01:55.490> of<00:01:55.700> the

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
actually find an approximation of the

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:03.609 
actually find an approximation of the
center<00:01:58.660> now<00:01:59.660> that<00:01:59.810> we've<00:01:59.930> got<00:02:00.140> our<00:02:02.619> circle

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:03.619 
center now that we've got our circle

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:10.210 
center now that we've got our circle
marked<00:02:03.979> out<00:02:05.080> I'm<00:02:06.080> going<00:02:06.350> to<00:02:06.410> soak<00:02:08.800> the<00:02:09.800> correct

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
marked out I'm going to soak the correct

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.780 
marked out I'm going to soak the correct
in<00:02:10.540> lubricant<00:02:11.680> and<00:02:12.680> the<00:02:13.070> lubricant<00:02:13.640> is

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
in lubricant and the lubricant is

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.460 
in lubricant and the lubricant is
basically<00:02:14.239> a<00:02:15.010> slurp<00:02:16.010> of<00:02:16.280> turpentine<00:02:17.470> and

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
basically a slurp of turpentine and

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.670 
basically a slurp of turpentine and
sewing<00:02:19.040> machine<00:02:19.370> oil<00:02:19.959> but<00:02:20.959> a<00:02:20.989> piece<00:02:21.230> of<00:02:21.380> felt

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
okay so I've just cut the glass down to

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.170 
okay so I've just cut the glass down to
something<00:03:12.470> a<00:03:12.590> little<00:03:12.770> bit<00:03:12.860> more<00:03:13.010> manageable

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.760 

enough<00:03:17.180> there<00:03:17.810> to<00:03:17.930> do<00:03:18.020> a<00:03:18.050> couple<00:03:18.410> in<00:03:18.530> case<00:03:18.740> I

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:18.770 
enough there to do a couple in case I

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:21.640

no sir what that which could possibly be

no sir what that which could possibly be
a<00:03:58.050> total<00:03:58.440> disaster

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.090

probably<00:04:18.530> would<00:04:18.680> have<00:04:18.769> been<00:04:19.040> a<00:04:19.310> better<00:04:19.549> option

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:20.080 
probably would have been a better option

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:22.000 
probably would have been a better option
because<00:04:21.080> then<00:04:21.200> you<00:04:21.260> can<00:04:21.380> just<00:04:21.410> roll<00:04:21.680> it<00:04:21.830> up<00:04:21.890> and

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.010 
because then you can just roll it up and

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:27.480 
because then you can just roll it up and
throw<00:04:22.250> it<00:04:22.280> away

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.710 

one<00:04:28.490> advantage<00:04:28.730> of<00:04:29.000> working<00:04:29.330> on<00:04:29.390> the<00:04:29.480> floor

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 
one advantage of working on the floor

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.960 
one advantage of working on the floor
like<00:04:29.960> I<00:04:30.140> am<00:04:30.290> is<00:04:31.250> that<00:04:31.310> I<00:04:31.490> can<00:04:31.670> actually<00:04:31.790> put

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:31.970 
like I am is that I can actually put

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:46.420 
like I am is that I can actually put
pressure<00:04:32.420> start<00:04:32.780> over<00:04:32.930> the<00:04:33.050> top<00:04:44.980> then<00:04:45.980> also<00:04:46.280> my

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
pressure start over the top then also my

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:59.080 
pressure start over the top then also my
phone<00:04:46.700> even<00:04:50.320> when<00:04:51.320> I'm<00:04:51.530> shopping<00:04:51.740> I<00:04:58.090> probably

nothing<00:06:35.460> I'm<00:06:35.550> gonna<00:06:35.700> crack<00:06:35.910> this<00:06:36.000> one<00:06:36.210> so<00:06:36.540> I

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:37.340 
nothing I'm gonna crack this one so I

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:41.780 
nothing I'm gonna crack this one so I
cut<00:06:38.340> it<00:06:38.370> back<00:06:38.610> this<00:06:38.820> way<00:06:40.400> with<00:06:41.400> the<00:06:41.520> running

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:41.790 
cut it back this way with the running

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:53.480 
cut it back this way with the running
bars<00:06:51.350> let's<00:06:52.350> see<00:06:52.470> how<00:06:52.590> this<00:06:52.740> one<00:06:52.920> goes

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:53.490 
bars let's see how this one goes

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:56.720 
bars let's see how this one goes
I<00:06:54.290> simply<00:06:55.290> getting<00:06:55.620> better<00:06:55.800> at<00:06:55.950> my<00:06:56.160> cutting

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:56.730 
I simply getting better at my cutting

00:06:56.730 --> 00:07:02.210 
I simply getting better at my cutting
speed<00:07:00.140> now<00:07:01.140> if<00:07:01.230> I<00:07:01.290> had<00:07:01.440> a<00:07:01.470> growing<00:07:01.740> stone<00:07:02.010> I'll

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:02.220 
speed now if I had a growing stone I'll

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:04.790 
speed now if I had a growing stone I'll
take<00:07:02.400> a<00:07:02.430> few<00:07:02.700> of<00:07:02.760> these<00:07:02.850> which<00:07:03.090> changes<00:07:03.800> the

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:04.800 
take a few of these which changes the

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:09.830 
take a few of these which changes the
budget<00:07:05.100> doesn't<00:07:05.250> stretch<00:07:05.580> that<00:07:05.760> far<00:07:08.840> not

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:09.840 
budget doesn't stretch that far not

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:15.700 
budget doesn't stretch that far not
something<00:07:10.230> I<00:07:10.350> do<00:07:10.410> on<00:07:10.680> a<00:07:11.030> hugely<00:07:12.030> regular<00:07:12.570> basis

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:15.710 

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:20.270 

but<00:07:16.710> that's<00:07:17.190> how<00:07:17.400> to<00:07:17.460> cut<00:07:17.730> glass<00:07:18.770> to<00:07:19.770> walk<00:07:20.160> it

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:20.280 
but that's how to cut glass to walk it

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:24.500 
but that's how to cut glass to walk it
over<00:07:21.530> you<00:07:22.530> can<00:07:22.590> use<00:07:22.770> whatever<00:07:23.120> glass<00:07:24.120> cleaning

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:24.510 
over you can use whatever glass cleaning

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:29.480 
over you can use whatever glass cleaning
a<00:07:24.660> lot<00:07:25.760> but<00:07:26.760> I<00:07:26.970> always<00:07:27.180> use<00:07:28.100> the<00:07:29.100> piece<00:07:29.310> of
