this in some obscure group of organisms

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.490 
this in some obscure group of organisms
we're<00:00:23.910> talking<00:00:24.269> a<00:00:24.359> taxon<00:00:24.900> that<00:00:25.109> contains

we're talking a taxon that contains

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.560 
we're talking a taxon that contains
hundreds<00:00:26.039> of<00:00:26.160> different<00:00:26.310> species<00:00:26.789> and<00:00:27.300> they

hundreds of different species and they

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.150 
hundreds of different species and they
can<00:00:27.720> be<00:00:27.810> found<00:00:27.990> all<00:00:28.230> over<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.500> world<00:00:28.619> though

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
for land and others for freshwater so

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.319 
for land and others for freshwater so
based<00:00:35.190> on<00:00:35.340> their<00:00:35.489> appearance<00:00:35.910> you<00:00:36.059> can<00:00:36.120> go

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
based on their appearance you can go

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:37.700 
based on their appearance you can go
ahead<00:00:36.540> and<00:00:36.660> call<00:00:36.809> them<00:00:36.899> ribbon<00:00:37.230> worms<00:00:37.380> or

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
ahead and call them ribbon worms or

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.560 
ahead and call them ribbon worms or
provisos<00:00:38.399> worms<00:00:38.610> because<00:00:39.149> what<00:00:39.300> sets<00:00:39.480> them

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
provisos worms because what sets them

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.209 
provisos worms because what sets them
apart<00:00:39.719> is<00:00:40.020> that<00:00:40.050> extendable<00:00:40.680> tube<00:00:40.920> thingy

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
apart is that extendable tube thingy

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.130 
apart is that extendable tube thingy
that<00:00:41.640> can<00:00:41.730> be<00:00:41.820> fired<00:00:42.059> and<00:00:42.300> retracted<00:00:42.809> at<00:00:42.899> will

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
that can be fired and retracted at will

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.139 
that can be fired and retracted at will
it<00:00:43.920> works<00:00:44.100> kind<00:00:44.430> of<00:00:44.460> like<00:00:44.520> a<00:00:44.610> rubber<00:00:44.850> glove

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
it works kind of like a rubber glove

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.549 
it works kind of like a rubber glove
that<00:00:45.480> is<00:00:45.629> pushed<00:00:45.870> out<00:00:46.079> through<00:00:46.110> muscle

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
that is pushed out through muscle

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.410 
that is pushed out through muscle
contraction<00:00:47.340> then<00:00:47.520> sucked<00:00:47.850> back<00:00:48.000> in<00:00:48.239> with

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
contraction then sucked back in with

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.600 
contraction then sucked back in with
hydrostatic<00:00:49.110> pressure<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:49.680> of<00:00:50.070> course<00:00:50.340> this

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
hydrostatic pressure and of course this

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:51.889 
hydrostatic pressure and of course this
should<00:00:50.670> keep<00:00:50.940> all<00:00:51.149> those<00:00:51.329> little<00:00:51.510> branch

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
should keep all those little branch

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.380 
should keep all those little branch
roots<00:00:52.079> nice<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:52.860> tidy<00:00:53.100> and<00:00:53.640> praise<00:00:54.030> where

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
roots nice and tidy and praise where

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.270 
roots nice and tidy and praise where
praise<00:00:54.420> is<00:00:54.930> due<00:00:54.960> cuz<00:00:55.440> this<00:00:55.590> guy<00:00:55.800> here<00:00:56.129> is<00:00:56.160> a

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
praise is due cuz this guy here is a

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.069 
praise is due cuz this guy here is a
pretty<00:00:56.610> special<00:00:57.030> case<00:00:57.270> considering<00:00:57.960> most

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
pretty special case considering most

pretty special case considering most
Shooter<00:00:58.500> worms<00:00:58.710> don't<00:00:59.039> have<00:00:59.219> such<00:00:59.399> complex

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
Shooter worms don't have such complex

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.000 
Shooter worms don't have such complex
appendages<00:01:00.600> but<00:01:01.199> still<00:01:01.440> their<00:01:01.620> function

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
appendages but still their function

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.709 
appendages but still their function
remains<00:01:02.309> more<00:01:02.640> or<00:01:02.699> less<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.120> same<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:03.660> that's

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
remains more or less the same and that's

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.929 
remains more or less the same and that's
the<00:01:03.960> capture<00:01:04.379> prey<00:01:04.650> so<00:01:05.309> depending<00:01:05.700> on<00:01:05.760> what

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939

group<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.390> worm<00:01:06.570> falls<00:01:06.900> into<00:01:07.200> there's<00:01:07.710> two

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
group the worm falls into there's two

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.520 
group the worm falls into there's two
basic<00:01:08.100> strategies<00:01:08.520> employed<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:10.020> weaponized

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
basic strategies employed the weaponized

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.530 
basic strategies employed the weaponized
ones<00:01:10.830> actually<00:01:11.100> have<00:01:11.340> a<00:01:11.460> sharp<00:01:11.790> spike<00:01:12.030> at<00:01:12.420> the

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
ones actually have a sharp spike at the

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.690 
ones actually have a sharp spike at the
tip<00:01:12.750> of<00:01:12.780> their<00:01:13.049> proboscis<00:01:13.530> and<00:01:14.100> this<00:01:14.310> thing<00:01:14.549> is

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
tip of their proboscis and this thing is

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.149 
tip of their proboscis and this thing is
soaking<00:01:15.000> in<00:01:15.330> toxins<00:01:15.869> all<00:01:16.110> day<00:01:16.409> so<00:01:16.799> that<00:01:16.920> it<00:01:17.040> can

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
soaking in toxins all day so that it can

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.580 
soaking in toxins all day so that it can
pierce<00:01:17.520> then<00:01:17.820> immobilize<00:01:18.390> its<00:01:18.659> target<00:01:19.140> other

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
pierce then immobilize its target other

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.649 
pierce then immobilize its target other
ones<00:01:19.920> like<00:01:20.100> our<00:01:20.250> friend<00:01:20.520> here<00:01:20.640> rely<00:01:21.180> more<00:01:21.450> on<00:01:21.509> a

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
ones like our friend here rely more on a

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.660 
ones like our friend here rely more on a
sticky<00:01:22.140> mucus<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:22.770> help<00:01:22.890> trap<00:01:23.280> and<00:01:23.520> hold

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
sticky mucus to help trap and hold

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.249 
sticky mucus to help trap and hold
theirs<00:01:24.030> down<00:01:24.299> you<00:01:24.810> know<00:01:24.900> how<00:01:24.990> they<00:01:25.080> like<00:01:25.110> to

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
theirs down you know how they like to

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.219 
theirs down you know how they like to
say<00:01:25.590> life<00:01:25.860> finds<00:01:26.189> away<00:01:26.549> well<00:01:27.090> yeah<00:01:27.330> this<00:01:27.960> sure

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
say life finds away well yeah this sure

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.140 
say life finds away well yeah this sure
is<00:01:28.380> one<00:01:28.619> hell<00:01:28.829> of<00:01:28.860> a<00:01:29.040> way<00:01:29.220> but<00:01:29.850> no<00:01:29.909> matter<00:01:30.030> how

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
is one hell of a way but no matter how

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.539 
is one hell of a way but no matter how
cool<00:01:30.630> this<00:01:30.840> hunting<00:01:31.200> method<00:01:31.500> is<00:01:31.650> it<00:01:31.950> serves<00:01:32.430> a

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
cool this hunting method is it serves a

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.850 
cool this hunting method is it serves a
purpose<00:01:32.759> far<00:01:33.270> beyond<00:01:33.600> our<00:01:33.810> amusement<00:01:34.140> because

purpose far beyond our amusement because

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.770 
purpose far beyond our amusement because
all<00:01:35.009> predators<00:01:35.369> like<00:01:35.729> these<00:01:36.000> guys<00:01:36.299> help

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
all predators like these guys help

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.800 
all predators like these guys help
balance<00:01:37.170> out<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.500> population<00:01:38.220> of<00:01:38.340> clams
