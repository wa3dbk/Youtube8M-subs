00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:16.410
 hello friends my name is see or ramirez 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.240
 national technical in the factor and I'm going 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.090
 to present a design with our kit 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.960
 Artists using stylus and ink 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:27.239
 china join me well here I have to 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.279
 create our base 5 teaspoons 

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:31.500
 crystal acrylic and I'm going to add the 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:35.280
 silver color which is pigment number 4 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:38.550
 half a teaspoon and then a pinch 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.700
 of pigment number 5 is a pink tone 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.670
 so you can create any tone that 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:48.440
 you want to mix perfectly and I 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.440
 Acrylic is ready for application 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:54.039
 we apply the mixture we carry 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.320
 all around the almond for 

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:59.190
 create the free edge with a structure 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.190
 square 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:09.430
 encapsulates mos with acrylic glass in 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.350
 our basic technique applying the 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.900
 first pearl in tension area 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.860
 We lateral covering and fades 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:19.560
 towards the tip 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.260
 We apply the second pearl in the area of 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:26.810
 cuticle perfectly sealing the 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.810
 outline and join with the first leg 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.820
 the third pearl we apply in the 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:36.710
 free edge an abundant pearl for 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.710
 cover to the tip 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:43.000
 already once the acrylic enters 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:49.260
 point of reticle we are going to place 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.260
 the point 6 tweezers to create pinch 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:54.030
 we continue I will perform the 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.670
 filing procedure beginning with 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.579
 minimum pink edge at once to the lime 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.509
 green edge and we finish with edge file 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.509
 blue and buffer 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:07.620
 we start with our design using 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:10.250
 Chinese ink from our artists kit 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:12.990
 before using it I will mix well 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:16.080
 beating the container 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:19.670
 we put a drop on the lace of the 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:22.130
 graphic style sliding towards the tip 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.770
 and we start our design we are going to 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:28.390
 make the outline of a eiffel tower 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:31.750
 and we started to shape it 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:34.450
 it's an abstract design so it's not 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:37.209
 let's detail a lot we create some 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:39.840
 crossed lines and so we continue in 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:39.840
 the whole tower 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:55.960
 and then using Chinese ink 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:58.500
 white we will give light effects on 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.500
 the eiffel tower 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:04.780
 supporting me with a raised hand brush 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:08.470
 we make the effects of light in the 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:12.300
 contours and slightly lines 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.300
 between the grid 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:27.230
 to continue we use white inks 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:30.709
 and a little red ink to achieve a 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:35.010
 pink tone and we form circles in the 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:37.459
 lower part of the nail and cuticle 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:40.849
 this is to fill spaces 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:40.849
 making flowers 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:47.850
 to create effects on the flower I'm going to 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.150
 use a more intense pink and let's 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:55.070
 make lines we make lines found 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:55.070
 a circle in the center 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:05.750
 and using white ink we make the 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:05.750
 same lines to create light effect 

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:14.970
 using green and white ink 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:17.599
 we make the sheets to each of 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.599
 our flowers 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:24.170
 To finish our design we use 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:29.380
 the style graph with brown ink and 

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:29.380
 we outline the flower and its leaves 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:36.710
 to finish our application he applied 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:39.470
 a layer of easyjet 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:41.560
 and introduce to the lamp for about 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:41.560
 minutes 

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:54.520
 well we finished the application 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:54.520
 using oil to hydrate cuticle 

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:04.250
 good friends, we have finished our 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:06.120
 design I hope you liked it
