00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.790
 secrets to make a good lamb 

00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:08.570
 well I would dare to say that there is no 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.700
 only one I think are two main 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:13.889
 I believe the main principal is the 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.289
 animal is the lamb is the quality of 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.880
 lamb I think that a bet that you 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.850
 guarantees almost already a good barbecue is a 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.380
 good lamb almost 80% and then the 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.650
 method but the method I think it's so 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.840
 simple that the ingredient that I would say 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.670
 what is more important is the oven 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.279
 is to do it in a wood oven with 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:35.040
 over Castilian very quiet 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:38.270
 very fondly and then water hoisted by 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.270
 so there are not many secrets 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:48.539
 I of everything I said before 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.670
 as important issues I will highlight 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.520
 one as a key to preparation and if we 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.250
 we refer to the method 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.410
 Tranquility is patience and it is 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.900
 Maybe the love is to be done very 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:05.040
 slowly more than two hours two hours and 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:07.020
 medium I repeat in a furnace that very strong 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.760
 not very soft I think it's the 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:13.310
 main ingredient which is the 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:17.160
 quiet then very simple 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:19.380
 especially I would not dare say 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:23.700
 Aranda de Duero as lechazo 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.740
 talking about the poor animal is the key 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.780
 be it from aranda de duero 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.600
 I believe there is an important area in 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.490
 castilla and lion where the lamb on 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.369
 all the lamb churro has its 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.350
 production and it's more important that it be 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.550
 churro that is from aranda that I think 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.830
 that wants to demythologize a little the 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:43.290
 but it has been shown that 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.690
 there are certain areas in the south of burgos 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.790
 part of segovia and part of soria where 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.820
 for the theme of grass and race 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.659
 churra especially wanted a lamb 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.909
 exquisite 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.850
 especially for what he told me before 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:02:01.409
 especially the race and the selection of 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.969
 cattle selected for coexistence as 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.829
 I think that to eat lamb in Aranda 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:07.409
 of duero if I have to choose the best 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:11.009
 accompaniment I would not hesitate talking about 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:13.590
 drink from a Ribera del Duero wine with 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.720
 all the offer we have right now 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.280
 as extensive and as high quality as 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.140
 we have there I think there's no need 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.030
 doubt it but evidently yes there 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.340
 to accompany him also with food 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.440
 We have quantity of products and 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.690
 byproducts of the suckling lamb that as 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.030
 in these days we present are a 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.220
 excellent accompaniment for the best 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.920
 companion primarily as a good 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.780
 salad a good wine from the riverbank and 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.200
 then a few small entries per day and 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.200
 sausages
