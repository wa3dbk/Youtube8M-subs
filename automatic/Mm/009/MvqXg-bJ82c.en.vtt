00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
three colors black which I have here the

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.920 
three colors black which I have here the
purple<00:01:37.229> and<00:01:37.619> like<00:01:38.340> a<00:01:38.369> light<00:01:38.700> blue<00:01:38.939> all<00:01:39.540> of

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
purple and like a light blue all of

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.859 
purple and like a light blue all of
which<00:01:40.110> have<00:01:40.460> white<00:01:41.460> lines<00:01:41.729> going<00:01:42.030> across<00:01:42.240> it's

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
which have white lines going across it's

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.609 
which have white lines going across it's
just<00:01:43.140> whether<00:01:43.590> or<00:01:43.860> not<00:01:44.009> i<00:01:44.700> mean<00:01:45.119> what<00:01:45.960> color<00:01:46.200> it

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
just whether or not i mean what color it

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.399 
just whether or not i mean what color it
is<00:01:46.820> substituting<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:47.909> black<00:01:48.119> here<00:01:48.479> i<00:01:48.659> think

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
is substituting the black here i think

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.910

00:03:48.539 --> 00:03:48.549 
can see are pretty much perfect as far

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:51.270

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
as the headphones go it is wide enough

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.460 
as the headphones go it is wide enough
that<00:03:51.430> pretty<00:03:52.060> much<00:03:52.239> any<00:03:52.510> headphone<00:03:52.989> I<00:03:53.290> have

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
that pretty much any headphone I have

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.650 
that pretty much any headphone I have
tried<00:03:53.859> can<00:03:54.340> fit<00:03:54.579> in<00:03:54.700> there<00:03:54.880> and<00:03:55.209> it<00:03:55.540> is<00:03:55.630> a

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:55.660 
tried can fit in there and it is a

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.259 
tried can fit in there and it is a
silicon<00:03:56.230> case<00:03:56.290> so<00:03:56.859> it<00:03:57.370> can<00:03:57.639> stretch<00:03:57.970> a<00:03:58.030> little

00:03:58.259 --> 00:03:58.269 
silicon case so it can stretch a little

00:03:58.269 --> 00:03:59.550 
silicon case so it can stretch a little
bit<00:03:58.420> and<00:03:58.690> if<00:03:58.780> you<00:03:58.900> have<00:03:58.989> a<00:03:59.049> really<00:03:59.410> big

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
bit and if you have a really big

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.460 
bit and if you have a really big
headphone<00:04:00.329> jack<00:04:01.329> you<00:04:01.780> really<00:04:02.079> wanted<00:04:02.319> to<00:04:02.349> you

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
headphone jack you really wanted to you

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:05.300 
headphone jack you really wanted to you
could<00:04:02.709> probably<00:04:02.889> mod<00:04:03.190> this<00:04:03.430> or<00:04:03.670> cut<00:04:03.880> it<00:04:04.030> um

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
could probably mod this or cut it um

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.949 
could probably mod this or cut it um
I've<00:04:06.310> had<00:04:06.670> this<00:04:06.819> case<00:04:07.000> by<00:04:07.209> the<00:04:07.269> way<00:04:07.450> for<00:04:07.660> about

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 
I've had this case by the way for about

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
four months I just never got around to

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:14.400 
four months I just never got around to
viewing<00:04:10.139> reviewing<00:04:11.139> it<00:04:11.290> on<00:04:11.790> the<00:04:12.790> bottom<00:04:13.180> so<00:04:14.169> I

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
viewing reviewing it on the bottom so I

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:15.870 
viewing reviewing it on the bottom so I

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:15.880 
what I was going to say about that is

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.569 
what I was going to say about that is
when<00:04:16.660> i<00:04:16.720> bought<00:04:17.049> it<00:04:17.079> it<00:04:17.349> was<00:04:17.380> like<00:04:17.739> thirty<00:04:18.370> or

is now but you can check it will be in
the<00:04:21.640> description<00:04:22.200> the<00:04:23.200> bottom<00:04:23.560> cutouts<00:04:23.950> are

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 
the description the bottom cutouts are

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:27.350 
the description the bottom cutouts are
perfect<00:04:24.669> um<00:04:25.470> don't<00:04:26.470> really

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
perfect um don't really

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.439

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:30.449 
there really aren't any errors in that

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:33.570 
there really aren't any errors in that
all<00:04:31.449> the<00:04:31.660> cutouts<00:04:31.990> are<00:04:32.169> really<00:04:32.470> nice<00:04:32.680> the<00:04:33.310> only

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580 
all the cutouts are really nice the only

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.969 
all the cutouts are really nice the only
thing<00:04:33.820> that<00:04:33.970> you<00:04:34.000> do<00:04:34.330> get<00:04:34.600> in<00:04:34.810> a<00:04:35.050> lot<00:04:35.680> of<00:04:35.740> the

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:35.979 
thing that you do get in a lot of the

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:37.650 
thing that you do get in a lot of the
silicone<00:04:36.430> cases<00:04:36.669> that<00:04:37.060> you<00:04:37.090> do<00:04:37.270> get<00:04:37.449> in<00:04:37.540> this

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:37.660 
silicone cases that you do get in this

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:40.439 
silicone cases that you do get in this
is<00:04:37.900> that<00:04:38.590> thin<00:04:38.949> line<00:04:38.979> that<00:04:39.790> just<00:04:40.000> goes<00:04:40.240> around

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:40.449 
is that thin line that just goes around

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:43.560 
is that thin line that just goes around
the<00:04:40.690> edge<00:04:40.960> which<00:04:41.770> doesn't<00:04:42.669> really<00:04:42.880> look<00:04:43.150> bad

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:43.570 
the edge which doesn't really look bad

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:46.770 
the edge which doesn't really look bad
it<00:04:43.900> would<00:04:44.050> look<00:04:44.169> nicer<00:04:44.620> without<00:04:44.740> it<00:04:45.130> but<00:04:45.780> you

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:46.780 
it would look nicer without it but you

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:47.909 
it would look nicer without it but you
can't<00:04:47.020> really<00:04:47.110> find<00:04:47.410> a<00:04:47.500> silicone<00:04:47.889> case

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:47.919 
can't really find a silicone case

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:49.680 
can't really find a silicone case
without<00:04:48.250> that<00:04:48.580> that's<00:04:48.850> just<00:04:49.030> for<00:04:49.210> the<00:04:49.360> two

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:49.690 
without that that's just for the two

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:52.710 
without that that's just for the two
pieces<00:04:49.960> of<00:04:50.139> silicone<00:04:50.740> meet<00:04:51.000> on<00:04:52.000> the<00:04:52.570> edge

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
pieces of silicone meet on the edge

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.939 
pieces of silicone meet on the edge
right<00:04:52.750> here<00:04:55.020> some<00:04:56.020> people<00:04:56.320> do<00:04:56.500> get<00:04:56.650> annoyed

00:04:56.939 --> 00:04:56.949 
right here some people do get annoyed

00:04:56.949 --> 00:05:01.140 
right here some people do get annoyed
with<00:04:57.280> the<00:04:57.570> home<00:04:58.570> button<00:04:59.610> like<00:05:00.610> you<00:05:00.880> have<00:05:00.970> to

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:01.150 
with the home button like you have to

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:05.320 
click the the rubber silicone case

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:08.070 
click the the rubber silicone case
actually<00:05:05.830> goes<00:05:06.280> over<00:05:06.820> the<00:05:07.360> home<00:05:07.540> button<00:05:07.780> I

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.080 
actually goes over the home button I

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.620 
actually goes over the home button I
don't<00:05:08.919> know<00:05:08.979> I<00:05:09.010> kind<00:05:09.430> of<00:05:09.460> like<00:05:09.669> it<00:05:09.700> it<00:05:10.150> just

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:10.630 
don't know I kind of like it it just

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:12.450 
don't know I kind of like it it just
doesn't<00:05:11.470> really<00:05:11.500> matter<00:05:11.800> to<00:05:12.010> me<00:05:12.160> because

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:12.460 
doesn't really matter to me because

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:16.129 
doesn't really matter to me because
doesn't<00:05:13.389> make<00:05:13.479> a<00:05:13.510> difference<00:05:13.690> I<00:05:14.139> don't<00:05:14.350> know

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:16.139 
doesn't make a difference I don't know

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:20.820 
doesn't make a difference I don't know
here<00:05:17.910> on<00:05:18.910> the<00:05:19.090> top<00:05:19.300> you<00:05:19.600> do<00:05:19.750> still<00:05:20.440> get<00:05:20.590> like

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:20.830 
here on the top you do still get like

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:22.950 
here on the top you do still get like
the<00:05:21.010> large<00:05:21.250> border<00:05:21.610> on<00:05:21.700> the<00:05:21.789> sides<00:05:22.030> however

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:22.960 
the large border on the sides however

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:26.340 
the large border on the sides however
the<00:05:23.500> case<00:05:23.830> it<00:05:24.220> doesn't<00:05:25.210> cut<00:05:25.539> off<00:05:25.690> any<00:05:26.050> of<00:05:26.139> the

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:26.350 
the case it doesn't cut off any of the

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:29.159 
the case it doesn't cut off any of the
screen<00:05:26.740> but<00:05:27.490> the<00:05:27.760> screen<00:05:28.090> does<00:05:28.360> stop<00:05:28.780> right

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:29.169 
screen but the screen does stop right

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:30.659 
screen but the screen does stop right
where<00:05:29.350> the<00:05:29.470> rubber<00:05:29.620> starts<00:05:30.130> and<00:05:30.340> that's<00:05:30.460> one

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:30.669 
where the rubber starts and that's one

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:32.790 
where the rubber starts and that's one
of<00:05:30.699> the<00:05:30.820> disadvantages<00:05:31.120> it<00:05:31.960> you<00:05:32.500> don't<00:05:32.650> get

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:32.800 
of the disadvantages it you don't get

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.770 
of the disadvantages it you don't get
that<00:05:32.860> border<00:05:33.460> all<00:05:33.669> the<00:05:33.700> way<00:05:33.910> around<00:05:34.150> without

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:34.780 
that border all the way around without

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:37.140 
that border all the way around without
having<00:05:35.440> like<00:05:36.340> if<00:05:36.490> you<00:05:36.610> were<00:05:36.700> to<00:05:36.820> take<00:05:36.940> that

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:37.150 
having like if you were to take that

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:39.510 
having like if you were to take that
silicone<00:05:37.660> part<00:05:37.900> out<00:05:38.080> but<00:05:38.770> also<00:05:38.919> it<00:05:39.190> helps<00:05:39.310> the

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:39.520 
silicone part out but also it helps the

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.820 
silicone part out but also it helps the
case<00:05:39.729> stay<00:05:39.970> on<00:05:40.060> better<00:05:40.240> so<00:05:40.690> you<00:05:41.380> have<00:05:41.470> ups<00:05:41.680> and

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:41.830 
case stay on better so you have ups and

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:45.240 
case stay on better so you have ups and
downs<00:05:42.039> there<00:05:42.340> but<00:05:43.270> it<00:05:43.990> does<00:05:44.289> not<00:05:44.530> cut<00:05:44.800> off<00:05:44.919> any

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:45.250 
downs there but it does not cut off any

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:49.469 
downs there but it does not cut off any
of<00:05:45.340> the<00:05:45.490> screen<00:05:45.910> on<00:05:46.150> the<00:05:46.389> edge<00:05:46.860> so<00:05:48.090> overall<00:05:49.090> I

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:49.479 
of the screen on the edge so overall I

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:51.120 
of the screen on the edge so overall I
would<00:05:49.539> definitely<00:05:49.960> recommend<00:05:50.289> this<00:05:50.710> case<00:05:50.950> the

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:51.130 
would definitely recommend this case the

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:53.190 
would definitely recommend this case the
only<00:05:51.490> con<00:05:51.760> about<00:05:52.090> this<00:05:52.270> case<00:05:52.510> I<00:05:52.780> would<00:05:52.900> have<00:05:53.020> to

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:53.200 
only con about this case I would have to

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:56.730 
only con about this case I would have to
say<00:05:53.229> is<00:05:53.800> the<00:05:54.460> switch<00:05:55.300> right<00:05:55.570> here<00:05:55.810> you<00:05:56.410> kind<00:05:56.620> of

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:56.740 
say is the switch right here you kind of

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:58.680 
say is the switch right here you kind of
do<00:05:56.979> have<00:05:57.220> to<00:05:57.400> dig<00:05:57.639> your<00:05:57.820> finger<00:05:58.180> in<00:05:58.300> a<00:05:58.419> little

00:05:58.680 --> 00:05:58.690 
do have to dig your finger in a little

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:02.219 
do have to dig your finger in a little
you<00:05:58.900> can't<00:05:59.200> just<00:05:59.380> like<00:06:00.030> flick<00:06:01.030> it<00:06:01.240> you<00:06:01.720> really

00:06:02.219 --> 00:06:02.229 
you can't just like flick it you really

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:04.230 
you can't just like flick it you really
have<00:06:02.440> to<00:06:02.620> stick<00:06:03.520> your<00:06:03.639> finger<00:06:03.940> in<00:06:03.970> there<00:06:04.210> and

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:04.240 
have to stick your finger in there and

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.810 
have to stick your finger in there and
push<00:06:04.539> it<00:06:04.750> which<00:06:05.500> kind<00:06:06.190> of<00:06:06.310> can<00:06:06.430> be<00:06:06.550> annoying

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:06.820 
push it which kind of can be annoying

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:09.240 
push it which kind of can be annoying
and<00:06:07.180> especially<00:06:08.139> when<00:06:08.440> it's<00:06:08.620> on<00:06:08.740> the<00:06:08.860> unlock

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:09.250 
and especially when it's on the unlock

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:12.360 
and especially when it's on the unlock
position<00:06:09.780> then<00:06:10.780> you<00:06:10.990> really<00:06:11.410> have<00:06:11.530> to<00:06:11.710> stick

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:12.370 
position then you really have to stick

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:13.529 
position then you really have to stick
your<00:06:12.460> finger<00:06:12.789> nail<00:06:12.940> in<00:06:13.090> there<00:06:13.210> because<00:06:13.330> it

00:06:13.529 --> 00:06:13.539 
your finger nail in there because it

00:06:13.539 --> 00:06:16.620 
your finger nail in there because it
does<00:06:13.770> go<00:06:14.770> under<00:06:15.039> the<00:06:15.700> silicone<00:06:16.180> a<00:06:16.210> little<00:06:16.479> bit

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:16.630 
does go under the silicone a little bit

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:20.610 
does go under the silicone a little bit
but<00:06:17.260> that<00:06:17.560> can<00:06:18.010> get<00:06:18.099> annoying<00:06:18.220> but<00:06:19.139> overall<00:06:20.139> I

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:20.620 
but that can get annoying but overall I

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:22.860 
but that can get annoying but overall I
don't<00:06:21.220> really<00:06:21.520> use<00:06:21.789> that<00:06:21.820> switch<00:06:22.300> a<00:06:22.479> lot<00:06:22.630> so<00:06:22.780> it

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:22.870 
don't really use that switch a lot so it

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:24.150 
don't really use that switch a lot so it
doesn't<00:06:23.139> matter<00:06:23.229> for<00:06:23.500> me<00:06:23.530> if<00:06:23.620> you<00:06:23.740> use<00:06:24.130> that

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:24.160 
doesn't matter for me if you use that

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.460 
doesn't matter for me if you use that
switch<00:06:24.639> a<00:06:24.789> ton<00:06:25.210> like<00:06:25.660> are<00:06:25.840> using<00:06:26.139> it<00:06:26.229> every

00:07:05.969 --> 00:07:05.979 
in here for when I'm using it and then

00:07:05.979 --> 00:07:09.139 
in here for when I'm using it and then
it<00:07:06.249> just<00:07:06.429> goes<00:07:06.639> inside<00:07:07.029> my<00:07:07.209> netbook<00:07:07.419> case<00:07:07.839> and
