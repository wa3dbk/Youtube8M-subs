 For those of here Well, It is action of entering the person of the bar code 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:34.410
 I think the number of the bar code and つ つ 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:57.700
 It is the case of Well this did hit it is by Oh Well lowland and this doing out I mistake 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:01.140

 I hit it exactly and this 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.680
 This is a major product wearing 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:12.360
 It came out, but 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:18.090
 I think that the form that exhibited by this well towards the exhibition screen in 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:21.299
 If it is this, it is one four a little, and it is Uchida and a mistake like the previous one 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:24.570
 Because it takes a lot of time, if it was 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:28.590
 Even though I'm also using wintering Kyubei 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.780

 This you have to scan the earlier of the bar code 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:41.080
 It is such a thing, but it is usable to most PC as we connect to usb 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.350
 I think 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.909

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.250
