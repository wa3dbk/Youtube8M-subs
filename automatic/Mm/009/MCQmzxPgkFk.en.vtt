00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
gone but the whole thing is is we could

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.149 
gone but the whole thing is is we could
have<00:01:23.970> done<00:01:24.119> it<00:01:24.270> differently<00:01:24.659> and<00:01:25.290> we<00:01:25.950> saw<00:01:26.130> how

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
have done it differently and we saw how

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.520 
have done it differently and we saw how
could<00:01:26.490> we<00:01:26.640> have<00:01:26.729> done<00:01:26.820> it<00:01:26.970> differently

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
could we have done it differently

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.950 
could we have done it differently
ignoring<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.729> Pakistani<00:01:29.729> government

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
ignoring the Pakistani government

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.030 
ignoring the Pakistani government
doesn't<00:01:30.960> help<00:01:31.170> us<00:01:31.320> at<00:01:31.380> all<00:01:31.619> it<00:01:31.799> looks<00:01:31.920> like

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
doesn't help us at all it looks like

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.069 
doesn't help us at all it looks like
we're<00:01:32.310> trying<00:01:32.640> to<00:01:32.820> be<00:01:33.180> more<00:01:33.390> antagonistic

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
we're trying to be more antagonistic

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.020 
we're trying to be more antagonistic
toward<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.710> Pakistani<00:01:35.310> they<00:01:35.520> have<00:01:35.640> helped<00:01:35.970> us

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
toward the Pakistani they have helped us

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.840 
toward the Pakistani they have helped us
in<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.270> past<00:01:36.360> to<00:01:37.200> catch<00:01:37.590> many<00:01:37.890> terrorists<00:01:38.610> and

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
in the past to catch many terrorists and

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.550 
in the past to catch many terrorists and
I<00:01:39.000> will<00:01:39.180> see<00:01:39.329> any<00:01:39.450> reason<00:01:39.630> why<00:01:39.810> we<00:01:39.960> can't<00:01:40.110> do

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
I will see any reason why we can't do

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.140 
I will see any reason why we can't do
that<00:01:40.829> but<00:01:41.220> you<00:01:41.369> would<00:01:41.490> have<00:01:41.520> taken<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:42.000> risk

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
that but you would have taken the risk

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.819 
that but you would have taken the risk
so<00:01:42.450> I<00:01:42.479> think<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.810> process<00:01:43.049> is<00:01:43.229> definitely

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
so I think the process is definitely

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.760 
so I think the process is definitely
different<00:01:43.979> if<00:01:44.640> you<00:01:44.939> if<00:01:45.149> you<00:01:45.240> compare<00:01:45.750> what<00:01:46.740> we

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
different if you if you compare what we

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.380 
different if you if you compare what we
did<00:01:47.040> after<00:01:47.220> world<00:01:47.549> war<00:01:47.670> two<00:01:47.790> think<00:01:48.210> of<00:01:48.299> the

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
did after world war two think of the

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.010

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
settles they might say well you know it

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:07.790 
settles they might say well you know it
could<00:02:06.869> have<00:02:06.990> been<00:02:07.049> a<00:02:07.110> better<00:02:07.259> way

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800 
could have been a better way

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.770 
could have been a better way
the<00:02:07.980> other<00:02:08.100> thing<00:02:08.370> is<00:02:08.670> is<00:02:08.940> is<00:02:09.150> to<00:02:09.420> make<00:02:09.750> a

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
the other thing is is is to make a

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.900 
the other thing is is is to make a
decision<00:02:10.020> on<00:02:10.500> this<00:02:10.710> whole<00:02:10.979> process<00:02:11.310> is<00:02:11.640> a

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
decision on this whole process is a

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.490 
decision on this whole process is a
little<00:02:12.180> premature<00:02:12.660> every<00:02:12.930> day<00:02:13.080> we<00:02:13.260> hear<00:02:13.440> a

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
little premature every day we hear a

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.590 
little premature every day we hear a
different<00:02:14.010> different<00:02:14.520> story<00:02:14.880> about<00:02:15.180> exactly

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
different different story about exactly

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.570 
different different story about exactly
what<00:02:15.780> happened<00:02:16.230> so<00:02:16.590> I<00:02:16.620> was<00:02:16.950> asked<00:02:17.310> whether<00:02:17.460> I

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
what happened so I was asked whether I

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.220 
what happened so I was asked whether I
could<00:02:17.880> do<00:02:18.000> it<00:02:18.090> differently<00:02:18.450> and<00:02:18.660> I<00:02:18.780> said<00:02:19.020> yes

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
could do it differently and I said yes

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.070 
could do it differently and I said yes
and<00:02:19.530> I<00:02:19.980> think<00:02:20.040> that<00:02:20.420> the<00:02:21.420> goals<00:02:21.690> and<00:02:21.990> the

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
and I think that the goals and the

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.750 
and I think that the goals and the
results<00:02:22.500> would<00:02:22.590> have<00:02:22.650> been<00:02:22.740> better<00:02:23.040> but<00:02:23.640> I'm

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
results would have been better but I'm

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.780 
results would have been better but I'm
really<00:02:24.270> worried<00:02:24.690> about<00:02:24.860> you<00:02:25.860> know<00:02:26.010> building

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
really worried about you know building

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.940 
really worried about you know building
this<00:02:26.970> animosity<00:02:27.480> with<00:02:27.930> the<00:02:28.020> Pakistanis<00:02:28.770> right

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
this animosity with the Pakistanis right

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.650 
this animosity with the Pakistanis right
now<00:02:29.160> I'm<00:02:29.490> for<00:02:29.730> all<00:02:29.880> cutting<00:02:30.210> the<00:02:30.300> four<00:02:30.510> and

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
now I'm for all cutting the four and

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.360 
now I'm for all cutting the four and
eight<00:02:30.780> like<00:02:31.080> I<00:02:31.320> would<00:02:31.650> have<00:02:31.740> never<00:02:31.860> given<00:02:32.160> them

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
eight like I would have never given them

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.090 
eight like I would have never given them
any<00:02:32.550> money<00:02:32.640> but<00:02:33.360> I'm<00:02:33.540> afraid<00:02:33.720> we're<00:02:34.680> we've

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
any money but I'm afraid we're we've

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.520 
any money but I'm afraid we're we've
already<00:02:35.280> expanded<00:02:36.000> the<00:02:36.060> war<00:02:36.270> into<00:02:36.990> Pakistan

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
already expanded the war into Pakistan

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.260 
already expanded the war into Pakistan
we've<00:02:38.100> been<00:02:38.250> bombing<00:02:38.550> them<00:02:38.850> at<00:02:38.970> the<00:02:39.030> same<00:02:39.120> time

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
we've been bombing them at the same time

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.530 
we've been bombing them at the same time
we<00:02:39.450> bomb<00:02:39.750> them<00:02:40.140> we<00:02:40.740> we<00:02:41.070> give<00:02:41.280> them<00:02:41.430> for<00:02:41.790> an<00:02:41.910> a<00:02:42.030> so

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
we bomb them we we give them for an a so

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.170 
we bomb them we we give them for an a so
I<00:02:42.570> think<00:02:42.750> the<00:02:43.530> whole<00:02:43.680> process<00:02:43.950> now<00:02:44.370> is<00:02:44.790> to

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
I think the whole process now is to

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.130 
I think the whole process now is to
build<00:02:45.510> up<00:02:45.780> the<00:02:46.130> enemy<00:02:47.130> in<00:02:48.120> Pakistan<00:02:48.660> so<00:02:48.960> that

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
build up the enemy in Pakistan so that

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.990 
build up the enemy in Pakistan so that
we<00:02:49.320> have<00:02:49.500> a<00:02:49.530> massive<00:02:49.890> invasion<00:02:50.340> there<00:02:50.760> and

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
we have a massive invasion there and

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.400 
we have a massive invasion there and

asked<00:02:59.760> do<00:02:59.820> you<00:02:59.880> think<00:03:00.150> everyone<00:03:00.420> should<00:03:00.570> just

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
asked do you think everyone should just

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490 
be responsible for themselves and if a

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.490 
sink or swim yeah I think that's the way

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:10.160 
sink or swim yeah I think that's the way
a<00:03:08.580> free<00:03:08.850> society<00:03:09.060> works<00:03:09.630> and<00:03:09.900> that's<00:03:10.020> the<00:03:10.080> way

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
a free society works and that's the way

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.650
