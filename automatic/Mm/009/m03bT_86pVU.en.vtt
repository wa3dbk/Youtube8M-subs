that<00:05:28.180> she<00:05:28.419> loves<00:05:28.659> it<00:05:28.870> I<00:05:29.080> shouldn't<00:05:29.650> give<00:05:29.740> it<00:05:29.770> to

00:05:29.939 --> 00:05:29.949 
that she loves it I shouldn't give it to

00:05:29.949 --> 00:05:30.960 
that she loves it I shouldn't give it to
her<00:05:30.009> at<00:05:30.099> night<00:05:30.250> so<00:05:30.370> it<00:05:30.460> does<00:05:30.580> give<00:05:30.759> her<00:05:30.820> more

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:30.970 
her at night so it does give her more

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:34.710 
her at night so it does give her more

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:36.460 
be seen from me when I thought it's the

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:39.749 
be seen from me when I thought it's the
fact<00:05:36.669> that<00:05:36.789> i<00:05:37.150> like<00:05:38.020> the<00:05:38.460> insoluble<00:05:39.460> and

00:05:39.749 --> 00:05:39.759 
fact that i like the insoluble and

00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:43.260 
fact that i like the insoluble and
soluble<00:05:40.180> fiber<00:05:40.599> that's<00:05:41.289> kind<00:05:41.530> of<00:05:41.590> like<00:05:41.710> I<00:05:42.270> love

soluble fiber that's kind of like I love

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:46.649 
soluble fiber that's kind of like I love
this<00:05:43.389> analogy<00:05:43.810> that<00:05:43.930> I<00:05:44.110> use<00:05:45.180> the<00:05:46.180> insoluble

00:05:46.649 --> 00:05:46.659 
this analogy that I use the insoluble

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:49.219 
this analogy that I use the insoluble
and<00:05:46.960> soluble<00:05:47.259> fibers<00:05:47.680> like<00:05:47.740> a<00:05:47.860> sponge<00:05:48.340> so<00:05:48.909> the

00:05:49.219 --> 00:05:49.229 
and soluble fibers like a sponge so the

00:05:49.229 --> 00:05:52.020 
and soluble fibers like a sponge so the
soluble<00:05:50.229> right<00:05:50.800> the<00:05:50.949> insula<00:05:51.490> fires<00:05:51.729> like<00:05:51.970> a

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:52.030 
soluble right the insula fires like a

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:52.530 
soluble right the insula fires like a
green

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:52.540 
green

scrubs your intestines out in my the
yellow<00:05:55.240> part<00:05:55.540> it's<00:05:55.990> a<00:05:56.110> soluble<00:05:56.350> so<00:05:56.710> it<00:05:56.770> just

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:57.040 
yellow part it's a soluble so it just

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:00.900 
yellow part it's a soluble so it just
absorbs<00:05:57.700> all<00:05:58.210> the<00:05:58.590> stuff<00:05:59.590> that's<00:05:59.920> in<00:06:00.730> your

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:08.170 
the heck no I'm like it because when i

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:10.410 
the heck no I'm like it because when i
first<00:06:08.470> started<00:06:08.680> taking<00:06:08.980> this<00:06:09.240> it<00:06:10.240> just

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:10.420 
first started taking this it just

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:12.570 
first started taking this it just
basically<00:06:10.570> cleared<00:06:11.290> me<00:06:11.560> out<00:06:11.680> and<00:06:12.010> it<00:06:12.160> really

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:12.580 
basically cleared me out and it really

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:14.460 
basically cleared me out and it really
helped<00:06:13.030> with<00:06:13.180> my<00:06:13.360> weight<00:06:13.720> loss<00:06:13.750> I<00:06:14.200> was

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:14.470 
helped with my weight loss I was

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:16.560 
helped with my weight loss I was
thinking<00:06:14.800> that's<00:06:15.580> final<00:06:16.060> look<00:06:16.180> this<00:06:16.300> kind<00:06:16.510> of

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:16.570 
thinking that's final look this kind of

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:18.390 
thinking that's final look this kind of
room<00:06:16.690> I<00:06:16.840> was<00:06:17.110> reliving<00:06:17.500> this<00:06:17.770> conversation<00:06:18.310> I

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:18.400 
room I was reliving this conversation I

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.340 
room I was reliving this conversation I
had<00:06:18.550> with<00:06:18.580> the<00:06:18.790> coach<00:06:18.970> of<00:06:19.000> mine<00:06:19.270> and<00:06:19.630> I<00:06:20.050> said

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:20.350 
had with the coach of mine and I said

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:22.500

it's<00:06:20.530> kind<00:06:20.740> of<00:06:20.800> like<00:06:20.950> a<00:06:21.010> loofah<00:06:21.520> for<00:06:22.240> the

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:22.510 
it's kind of like a loofah for the

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:24.390 
it's kind of like a loofah for the
inside<00:06:22.870> of<00:06:22.900> your<00:06:23.140> body<00:06:23.320> when<00:06:23.950> you<00:06:24.040> drink<00:06:24.220> it

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:24.400 
inside of your body when you drink it

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.280 
inside of your body when you drink it
you<00:06:24.430> have<00:06:24.760> you<00:06:25.330> know<00:06:25.420> your<00:06:25.630> workout<00:06:25.990> does<00:06:26.260> a

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:26.290 
you have you know your workout does a
