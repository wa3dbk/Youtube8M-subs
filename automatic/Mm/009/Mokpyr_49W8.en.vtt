00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:08.860
 is in the final phase of construction the malá hydroelectric plant located in 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:13.130
 river between the Paraense municipalities of Telêmaco Borba and 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:14.209
 ortigueira 

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:18.550
 the total installed power will be released at 61 megabytes 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:23.980
 has 350 in the power plant of the main plant and we finish in the house of 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.980
 secondary force that implanted near the dam 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.380
 the hardest case is compacted concrete with roller 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.110
 after 75 meters high a week 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.110
 I made about 70 meters wide also the mafia 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:39.679
 is 

00:00:39.679 --> 00:00:43.230
 this dam is not directly supported by the rock 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.710
 her instability is what I think she has 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:47.910
 in concrete 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.790
 so there is no guts in creating something compacted concrete with the 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.790
 red socks sit on the rock 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.170
 the method of construction also 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.170
 despite knowing how to use document 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.600
 even more effective 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.729
 is the increase of productivity without the victory to know of the fame to be done 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.740
 many actions of the state 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.070
 about 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.070
 then every 8 ccr palm 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.450
 each of the twenty fires that is compacted 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:22.009
 is required 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:24.880
 of these 6 6th ancestors 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.710
 to take the water from the reservoir to the powerhouse to get into the matter 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:31.799
 gross of 120 meters 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:37.210
 was built a circuit composed of low-pressure water outlet tunnel 

00:01:37.209 --> 00:01:41.009
 adopted rock excavated about two kilometers long 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.730
 the cargo chamber 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:48.370
 high pressure water and three forced tunnels in the final stretch 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.690
 the powerhouse will be sheltered and will have three turbines of the type 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.160
 francis each with 119 reached 5 megawatts of power 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:05.230
 the Mauá hydroelectric power plant is budgeted at about 30 million reais and should 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:07.850
 to start commercial operation in 2011
