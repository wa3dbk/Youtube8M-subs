that keep it dark for them and you can
see<00:00:36.070> some<00:00:36.309> sprouts<00:00:36.640> are<00:00:36.820> starting<00:00:37.090> to<00:00:37.180> cling

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:37.450

00:00:48.119 --> 00:00:48.129 
and I changed the water in the base of

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:50.549 
and I changed the water in the base of
each<00:00:48.400> one<00:00:48.850> and<00:00:49.180> I<00:00:49.269> did<00:00:49.480> that<00:00:49.660> every<00:00:50.080> day<00:00:50.260> since

each one and I did that every day since
we've<00:00:50.769> had<00:00:50.949> these<00:00:51.839> so<00:00:52.839> this<00:00:53.019> is<00:00:53.170> what<00:00:53.290> the

we've had these so this is what the
sunflower<00:00:53.920> guys<00:00:54.220> look<00:00:54.519> like<00:00:54.699> at<00:00:54.909> this<00:00:55.059> point

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:55.390 
sunflower guys look like at this point

sunflower guys look like at this point
they<00:00:56.290> have<00:00:56.320> not<00:00:56.830> gotten<00:00:57.190> very<00:00:57.460> far<00:00:57.790> in

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:57.970 
they have not gotten very far in

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.660 
they have not gotten very far in
sprouting<00:00:58.480> but<00:00:58.659> they<00:00:58.839> are<00:00:59.050> sprouting<00:00:59.670> then

the bean mixture is getting pretty crazy
it's<00:01:04.030> all<00:01:04.180> tangled<00:01:04.449> up<00:01:04.750> with<00:01:04.809> their<00:01:05.170> sprout

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:05.560 
it's all tangled up with their sprout

long white tails but they also have a
little<00:01:12.310> bit<00:01:12.430> of<00:01:12.550> fuzz<00:01:12.909> which<00:01:13.900> I<00:01:14.140> feel<00:01:14.680> like

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890 
little bit of fuzz which I feel like

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.690 
little bit of fuzz which I feel like
it's<00:01:15.130> mold<00:01:15.490> although<00:01:15.850> it<00:01:16.000> could<00:01:16.420> just<00:01:16.659> be<00:01:16.870> more

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
it's mold although it could just be more

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.950 
it's mold although it could just be more
root<00:01:18.960> fuzziness<00:01:19.960> I<00:01:20.290> was<00:01:21.219> told<00:01:21.689> now<00:01:22.689> we<00:01:22.750> have

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:22.960 
root fuzziness I was told now we have

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.569 
root fuzziness I was told now we have
the<00:01:23.110> mung<00:01:23.350> bean<00:01:23.590> sprouts<00:01:23.619> that<00:01:24.280> have<00:01:24.430> a

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:24.579 
the mung bean sprouts that have a

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:27.630 
the mung bean sprouts that have a
starting<00:01:25.090> to<00:01:25.240> get<00:01:25.329> like<00:01:25.540> a<00:01:25.570> purpley<00:01:26.290> pink<00:01:27.009> hue

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 
starting to get like a purpley pink hue

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.359 
starting to get like a purpley pink hue
to<00:01:28.090> their<00:01:28.320> faces<00:01:29.320> and<00:01:29.860> then<00:01:29.979> they're<00:01:30.130> having

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:30.369 
to their faces and then they're having

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:31.889 
to their faces and then they're having
nice<00:01:30.520> white<00:01:30.820> tails<00:01:31.119> that<00:01:31.299> are<00:01:31.360> actually

00:01:31.889 --> 00:01:31.899 
nice white tails that are actually

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:35.330 
nice white tails that are actually
lifting<00:01:32.500> them<00:01:32.680> off<00:01:32.890> the<00:01:33.130> tray<00:01:33.430> at<00:01:33.729> this<00:01:33.880> point

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
lifting them off the tray at this point

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.300 
lifting them off the tray at this point
here's<00:01:36.340> the<00:01:36.610> fenugreek<00:01:36.939> and<00:01:37.509> that<00:01:38.159> to<00:01:39.159> me

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
here's the fenugreek and that to me

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:40.560 
here's the fenugreek and that to me
looks<00:01:39.549> like<00:01:39.610> there<00:01:39.850> was<00:01:39.939> just<00:01:40.119> too<00:01:40.360> many

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:40.570 
looks like there was just too many

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.560 
looks like there was just too many
fenugreek<00:01:41.020> seeds<00:01:41.409> on<00:01:41.680> the<00:01:42.039> tray<00:01:42.460> so<00:01:43.420> I<00:01:43.479> would

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
fenugreek seeds on the tray so I would

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.950 
fenugreek seeds on the tray so I would
probably<00:01:43.689> do<00:01:43.990> less<00:01:44.200> next<00:01:44.770> time<00:01:44.979> and<00:01:45.960> finally

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
probably do less next time and finally

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.830 
probably do less next time and finally
over<00:01:47.469> here<00:01:47.740> are<00:01:48.539> our<00:01:49.539> alfalfa<00:01:50.469> and<00:01:50.619> clover

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
over here are our alfalfa and clover

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.709 
over here are our alfalfa and clover
sprouting<00:01:52.840> mix<00:01:54.090> so<00:01:55.090> everything's<00:01:55.539> looking

00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:55.719 
sprouting mix so everything's looking

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:58.770 
sprouting mix so everything's looking
good<00:01:56.109> for<00:01:56.890> mold<00:01:57.159> problems<00:01:57.700> I<00:01:57.850> did<00:01:58.090> read<00:01:58.359> that

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
good for mold problems I did read that

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.389 
good for mold problems I did read that
you<00:01:59.049> can<00:01:59.350> add<00:02:00.929> some<00:02:01.929> hydrogen<00:02:02.380> peroxide<00:02:02.649> up<00:02:03.250> to

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:03.399 
you can add some hydrogen peroxide up to

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:07.319 
you can add some hydrogen peroxide up to
half<00:02:03.609> a<00:02:03.789> cup<00:02:03.820> in<00:02:04.420> the<00:02:05.109> bottom<00:02:05.530> water<00:02:06.329> reservoir

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:07.329 
half a cup in the bottom water reservoir

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:12.990 
half a cup in the bottom water reservoir
there<00:02:07.600> and<00:02:07.920> then<00:02:08.920> you<00:02:09.070> can<00:02:09.250> also<00:02:09.460> add<00:02:12.000> grape

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
there and then you can also add grape

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.380 
there and then you can also add grape
seed<00:02:13.420> extract<00:02:13.630> a<00:02:14.320> few<00:02:14.350> 10<00:02:15.280> 5<00:02:15.610> to<00:02:15.760> 10<00:02:15.940> drops<00:02:16.180> of

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
seed extract a few 10 5 to 10 drops of

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.150 
seed extract a few 10 5 to 10 drops of
grape<00:02:16.600> seed<00:02:16.630> extract<00:02:16.930> into<00:02:17.530> the<00:02:17.620> bottoms<00:02:17.950> if

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
grape seed extract into the bottoms if

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.410 
grape seed extract into the bottoms if
you<00:02:18.280> do<00:02:18.580> have<00:02:18.820> problems<00:02:19.180> with<00:02:19.300> moles<00:02:20.160> so<00:02:21.420> they

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
you do have problems with moles so they

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.420 
you do have problems with moles so they
say<00:02:22.750> to<00:02:22.780> keep<00:02:23.200> these<00:02:23.580> black

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
say to keep these black

see<00:02:51.049> the<00:02:51.230> Sun<00:02:51.620> so<00:02:52.099> that<00:02:52.129> they<00:02:52.370> can<00:02:52.579> start<00:02:52.819> to

00:02:52.869 --> 00:02:52.879 
see the Sun so that they can start to

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:56.289 
see the Sun so that they can start to
turn<00:02:53.209> green<00:02:53.480> but<00:02:54.790> following<00:02:55.790> the<00:02:55.939> manual

00:02:59.259 --> 00:02:59.269 
instructions for the first experiment we

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:04.500 
instructions for the first experiment we
can<00:02:59.480> kind<00:03:00.440> of<00:03:00.500> adjust<00:03:00.650> after<00:03:01.340> that<00:03:01.930> and<00:03:03.190> then

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
can kind of adjust after that and then

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:10.599 
can kind of adjust after that and then
once<00:03:05.510> I<00:03:06.730> have<00:03:07.730> all<00:03:07.940> those<00:03:08.180> set<00:03:08.629> I<00:03:09.250> can<00:03:10.250> just

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:10.609 
once I have all those set I can just

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:14.679 
once I have all those set I can just
grab<00:03:10.819> the<00:03:11.060> tops<00:03:11.329> and<00:03:11.810> again<00:03:13.150> the<00:03:14.150> sprinklers

00:03:14.679 --> 00:03:14.689 
grab the tops and again the sprinklers

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:19.920 
grab the tops and again the sprinklers
will<00:03:15.049> be<00:03:15.230> set<00:03:15.560> up<00:03:15.790> to<00:03:16.790> water<00:03:17.090> my<00:03:17.389> sprout<00:03:17.750> babies

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
will be set up to water my sprout babies

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:32.670 
will be set up to water my sprout babies
in<00:03:22.239> the<00:03:23.239> fresh<00:03:23.659> life<00:03:24.459> automatic<00:03:25.459> routers

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.670 

so<00:03:33.340> you<00:03:33.430> can<00:03:33.819> see<00:03:34.150> some<00:03:35.049> of<00:03:35.079> these<00:03:35.290> sprouts

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
so you can see some of these sprouts

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.530 
so you can see some of these sprouts
have<00:03:35.920> actually<00:03:36.340> pushed<00:03:36.640> the<00:03:36.849> tray<00:03:37.120> way<00:03:37.329> up

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
have actually pushed the tray way up

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.449 
have actually pushed the tray way up
there's<00:03:37.750> only<00:03:37.840> that<00:03:38.170> much<00:03:38.349> tubing<00:03:38.890> left<00:03:39.129> and

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
there's only that much tubing left and

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:41.789 
there's only that much tubing left and
whereas<00:03:40.450> this<00:03:40.599> one<00:03:40.840> hasn't<00:03:41.079> been<00:03:41.319> pushed<00:03:41.590> up

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:41.799 
whereas this one hasn't been pushed up

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:43.949 
whereas this one hasn't been pushed up
so<00:03:41.829> high<00:03:42.220> and<00:03:42.459> it's<00:03:42.579> actually<00:03:43.030> the<00:03:43.569> sprouts

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
so high and it's actually the sprouts

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:47.610 
so high and it's actually the sprouts

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
you can tell from the picture growing

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.360 
you can tell from the picture growing
and<00:03:47.860> pushing<00:03:48.310> the<00:03:48.459> top<00:03:48.670> tray<00:03:48.970> upwards<00:03:50.220> and<00:03:51.220> a

and pushing the top tray upwards and a
lot<00:03:51.549> of<00:03:51.700> these<00:03:51.849> barrels<00:03:52.409> so<00:03:53.409> now<00:03:53.590> we<00:03:53.650> can

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
lot of these barrels so now we can

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.390 
lot of these barrels so now we can
remove<00:03:54.250> the<00:03:54.579> top<00:03:54.790> trays<00:03:55.180> and<00:03:55.599> see<00:03:56.040> what<00:03:57.040> sprout

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
remove the top trays and see what sprout

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.420 
remove the top trays and see what sprout
surprises<00:03:58.150> we<00:03:58.299> have<00:03:58.510> to<00:03:58.930> look<00:03:59.079> at<00:03:59.290> today<00:03:59.500> yes

guys<00:04:19.539> are<00:04:19.840> slowing<00:04:21.630> sprouting<00:04:22.630> here<00:04:24.270> and<00:04:25.270> that

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:25.510 
guys are slowing sprouting here and that

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:27.029 
guys are slowing sprouting here and that
actually<00:04:25.870> means<00:04:26.050> they<00:04:26.199> can<00:04:26.380> probably<00:04:26.500> keep

00:04:27.029 --> 00:04:27.039 
actually means they can probably keep

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:28.860 
actually means they can probably keep
their<00:04:27.250> top<00:04:27.490> tray<00:04:27.729> on<00:04:27.880> a<00:04:28.060> little<00:04:28.210> bit<00:04:28.360> longer<00:04:28.570> so

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
their top tray on a little bit longer so

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:30.689 
their top tray on a little bit longer so
I'm<00:04:28.960> gonna<00:04:29.080> put<00:04:29.320> that<00:04:29.470> back<00:04:29.800> on<00:04:29.830> the<00:04:30.220> sunflower

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:30.699 
I'm gonna put that back on the sunflower

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:35.490 
I'm gonna put that back on the sunflower
ones<00:04:31.650> so<00:04:32.650> they<00:04:32.830> get<00:04:33.039> bigger<00:04:34.320> you're<00:04:35.320> the

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:35.500 
ones so they get bigger you're the

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:42.089 
ones so they get bigger you're the
slowest<00:04:35.979> sprouting<00:04:36.639> so<00:04:36.880> far<00:04:40.800> there's<00:04:41.800> the

00:04:42.089 --> 00:04:42.099 
slowest sprouting so far there's the
