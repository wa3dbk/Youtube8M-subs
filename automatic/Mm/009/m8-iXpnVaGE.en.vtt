00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
classification and see how I go but I've

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.080 
classification and see how I go but I've
never<00:01:04.110> I've<00:01:04.710> never<00:01:04.769> ridden<00:01:05.159> that<00:01:05.519> this<00:01:05.850> sort

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
never I've never ridden that this sort

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.380 
never I've never ridden that this sort
of<00:01:06.180> level<00:01:06.390> in<00:01:06.780> March<00:01:07.049> or<00:01:07.470> februari<00:01:08.369> in<00:01:09.000> Europe

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
of level in March or februari in Europe

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.760 
of level in March or februari in Europe
so<00:01:09.900> it's<00:01:10.049> definitely<00:01:10.290> going<00:01:10.409> to<00:01:10.470> be<00:01:10.530> a<00:01:10.590> big

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
so it's definitely going to be a big

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.679 
so it's definitely going to be a big
test<00:01:10.950> for<00:01:11.100> me<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:11.549> so<00:01:11.939> far<00:01:12.150> it's<00:01:12.299> going<00:01:12.479> well

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
test for me and so far it's going well

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.210 
test for me and so far it's going well
and<00:01:12.869> hopefully<00:01:13.080> I<00:01:13.260> can<00:01:13.350> continue<00:01:13.619> that<00:01:14.040> over

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
and hopefully I can continue that over

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.890 
and hopefully I can continue that over
the<00:01:14.310> next<00:01:14.340> couple<00:01:14.610> of<00:01:14.729> days<00:01:14.880> how<00:01:15.540> do<00:01:15.630> you<00:01:15.689> feel

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900

with the whole GC tag as well giving

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.859 
with the whole GC tag as well giving
that<00:01:19.950> you<00:01:20.250> know<00:01:20.400> you're<00:01:20.700> essentially<00:01:21.270> going

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
that you know you're essentially going

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.380 
that you know you're essentially going
to<00:01:22.350> be<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.560> guy<00:01:22.710> at<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:22.920> pointy<00:01:23.369> end<00:01:23.400> as<00:01:24.330> it

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
to be the guy at the pointy end as it

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.840 
to be the guy at the pointy end as it
sit<00:01:24.780> with<00:01:24.900> you<00:01:25.670> it's<00:01:26.670> definitely

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
sit with you it's definitely

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.940 
sit with you it's definitely
nerve-racking<00:01:27.180> and<00:01:27.840> it's<00:01:28.500> a<00:01:28.530> lot<00:01:28.710> of<00:01:28.799> hard

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
nerve-racking and it's a lot of hard

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.710 
nerve-racking and it's a lot of hard
work<00:01:29.040> every<00:01:29.490> single<00:01:29.640> day<00:01:29.820> you<00:01:29.970> even<00:01:30.420> on<00:01:30.659> the

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
work every single day you even on the

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.149 
work every single day you even on the
sprint<00:01:30.960> stages<00:01:31.320> you<00:01:31.409> can't<00:01:31.650> lose<00:01:31.829> time<00:01:32.130> and

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
sprint stages you can't lose time and

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.190 
sprint stages you can't lose time and
then<00:01:32.520> when<00:01:33.390> you<00:01:33.479> hit<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.720> mountains<00:01:34.079> you

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
then when you hit the mountains you

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.480 
then when you hit the mountains you
still<00:01:34.439> got<00:01:34.560> to<00:01:34.650> stay<00:01:34.799> with<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.009> front<00:01:35.220> groups

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
still got to stay with the front groups

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.780 
still got to stay with the front groups
so<00:01:35.850> it's<00:01:36.450> a<00:01:36.630> little<00:01:37.170> bit<00:01:37.290> new<00:01:37.560> to<00:01:37.590> me<00:01:37.860> and<00:01:38.130> I've

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
so it's a little bit new to me and I've

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.420 
so it's a little bit new to me and I've

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
of big mountains and I believe what it

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:51.679 
of big mountains and I believe what it
was<00:01:50.700> saying<00:01:50.850> that<00:01:50.970> you're<00:01:51.149> a<00:01:51.180> couple<00:01:51.450> of<00:01:51.509> kilos

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
was saying that you're a couple of kilos

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.450 
was saying that you're a couple of kilos
lighter<00:01:52.110> than<00:01:52.409> this<00:01:52.530> time<00:01:52.740> last<00:01:52.799> year<00:01:53.189> what

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
lighter than this time last year what

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.280 
lighter than this time last year what
have<00:01:53.549> you<00:01:53.640> done<00:01:53.820> differently<00:01:54.659> to<00:01:54.750> get

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
have you done differently to get

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.219 
have you done differently to get
yourself<00:01:55.409> in<00:01:55.680> this<00:01:55.740> sort<00:01:55.920> of<00:01:55.979> shape<00:01:57.049> yeah<00:01:58.049> I'm

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229
