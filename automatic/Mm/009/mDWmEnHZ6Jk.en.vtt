vertical bike storage rack this is all

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.049 
vertical bike storage rack this is all
fine<00:00:10.530> and<00:00:10.559> dandy<00:00:10.710> the<00:00:10.980> way<00:00:11.070> it<00:00:11.190> is<00:00:11.340> but<00:00:11.849> we<00:00:11.940> can

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
fine and dandy the way it is but we can

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:13.700 
fine and dandy the way it is but we can
actually<00:00:12.179> save<00:00:12.509> some<00:00:12.540> room<00:00:12.750> by<00:00:13.230> rotating<00:00:13.590> it

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
actually save some room by rotating it

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.709 
actually save some room by rotating it
to<00:00:13.860> the<00:00:13.950> side<00:00:14.190> as<00:00:14.849> you<00:00:15.059> can<00:00:15.089> see<00:00:15.330> we<00:00:15.509> can<00:00:15.630> go

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
to the side as you can see we can go

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.359 
to the side as you can see we can go
ahead<00:00:15.839> and<00:00:16.080> rotate<00:00:16.350> it<00:00:16.500> to<00:00:16.680> one<00:00:16.800> side<00:00:16.830> or<00:00:17.250> the

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
ahead and rotate it to one side or the

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.420 
ahead and rotate it to one side or the
other<00:00:17.400> this<00:00:18.029> saves<00:00:18.330> us<00:00:18.480> a<00:00:18.600> lot<00:00:18.750> of<00:00:18.779> space<00:00:19.430> in

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
other this saves us a lot of space in

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.189 
other this saves us a lot of space in
fact<00:00:20.609> the<00:00:20.730> difference<00:00:21.029> between<00:00:21.150> was<00:00:21.930> just

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
fact the difference between was just

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.920 
fact the difference between was just
under<00:00:22.410> 14<00:00:23.039> inches<00:00:23.369> now<00:00:24.119> visible<00:00:24.420> vary<00:00:24.750> between

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
under 14 inches now visible vary between

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.500 
under 14 inches now visible vary between
different<00:00:25.170> sizes<00:00:25.830> of<00:00:25.859> bikes<00:00:26.160> as<00:00:26.400> well<00:00:26.510> fewer

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
different sizes of bikes as well fewer

bike against the wall well go ahead and

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.760 
bike against the wall well go ahead and
put<00:01:26.909> our<00:01:27.000> front<00:01:27.180> wheel<00:01:27.390> into<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.990> rack<00:01:28.170> let's

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
put our front wheel into the rack let's

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.710 
put our front wheel into the rack let's
go<00:01:28.890> to<00:01:29.009> rack<00:01:29.189> up<00:01:29.220> far<00:01:29.610> forward<00:01:30.060> as<00:01:30.150> possible<00:01:30.210> to

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
go to rack up far forward as possible to

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.590 
go to rack up far forward as possible to
take<00:01:30.900> up<00:01:31.049> as<00:01:31.140> much<00:01:31.290> slack<00:01:32.180> bill<00:01:33.180> measure<00:01:33.479> from

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
take up as much slack bill measure from

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.749 
take up as much slack bill measure from
the<00:01:33.720> top<00:01:33.900> mounting<00:01:34.290> hole<00:01:34.500> back<00:01:35.189> to<00:01:35.430> our<00:01:35.549> wall

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
the top mounting hole back to our wall

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.060 
the top mounting hole back to our wall
in<00:01:36.570> this<00:01:36.750> case<00:01:37.020> our<00:01:37.320> measurements<00:01:37.890> going<00:01:37.950> to

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
in this case our measurements going to

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.010 
in this case our measurements going to
be<00:01:38.130> 63<00:01:38.610> inches<00:01:38.970> now<00:01:39.329> this<00:01:39.509> will<00:01:39.659> vary<00:01:39.840> from

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
be 63 inches now this will vary from

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.499 
be 63 inches now this will vary from
bike<00:01:40.259> to<00:01:40.439> bike<00:01:40.619> of<00:01:40.799> course<00:01:41.000> on<00:01:42.000> top<00:01:42.030> of<00:01:42.420> this

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
bike to bike of course on top of this

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.149 
bike to bike of course on top of this
measurement<00:01:43.049> you<00:01:43.140> want<00:01:43.290> to<00:01:43.350> add<00:01:43.500> a<00:01:43.530> distance

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
measurement you want to add a distance

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.920 
measurement you want to add a distance
so<00:01:44.340> at<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.640> back<00:01:44.820> wheel<00:01:45.060> can<00:01:45.390> clear<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.689> floor

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
so at the back wheel can clear the floor

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.109 
so at the back wheel can clear the floor
in<00:01:46.439> this<00:01:46.530> case<00:01:46.770> we<00:01:46.890> want<00:01:47.040> a<00:01:47.100> fair<00:01:47.250> amount<00:01:47.399> so

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
in this case we want a fair amount so

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.069 
in this case we want a fair amount so
we're<00:01:48.240> actually<00:01:48.390> going<00:01:48.630> to<00:01:48.689> run<00:01:48.869> it<00:01:48.960> up<00:01:49.020> to

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
we're actually going to run it up to

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.990 
we're actually going to run it up to
about<00:01:49.259> 70<00:01:49.680> inches<00:01:49.950> now<00:01:50.610> we<00:01:50.670> have<00:01:50.970> a

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
about 70 inches now we have a

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.609 
about 70 inches now we have a
measurement<00:01:51.329> we<00:01:51.540> can<00:01:51.659> go<00:01:51.750> ahead<00:01:51.899> and<00:01:52.049> separate

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
measurement we can go ahead and separate

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.620 
measurement we can go ahead and separate
the<00:01:52.649> bike<00:01:52.860> rack<00:01:53.100> and<00:01:53.130> bike<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:54.149> go<00:01:54.360> ahead<00:01:54.479> and

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
the bike rack and bike and go ahead and

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:55.850 
the bike rack and bike and go ahead and
transfer<00:01:54.869> our<00:01:54.899> measurement<00:01:55.470> to<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:55.649> wall

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
transfer our measurement to the wall

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.800 
transfer our measurement to the wall
once<00:01:56.549> we<00:01:56.640> find<00:01:56.820> our<00:01:56.880> location<00:01:57.360> on<00:01:57.479> our<00:01:57.630> wall

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
once we find our location on our wall

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.510 
once we find our location on our wall
we'll<00:01:58.110> go<00:01:58.229> ahead<00:01:58.350> and<00:01:58.590> mark<00:01:58.829> now<00:01:59.250> you<00:01:59.310> also

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
we'll go ahead and mark now you also

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.190 
we'll go ahead and mark now you also
want<00:01:59.759> to<00:01:59.790> make<00:01:59.909> sure<00:01:59.939> that<00:02:00.509> there's<00:02:00.719> a<00:02:00.810> stud

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
want to make sure that there's a stud

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.319 
want to make sure that there's a stud
behind<00:02:01.649> the<00:02:01.979> wall<00:02:02.159> on<00:02:02.430> the<00:02:02.820> location<00:02:03.240> you're
