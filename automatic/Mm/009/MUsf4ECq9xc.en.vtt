00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:10.320
 It was okay to think you guys know that 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.849
 new fashion flying decoration 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.610
 the lenses that are arriving in brazil 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:19.170
 Now is the paper flower. 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.760
 Look, it's rice paper. It 's super easy. 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.210
 to do 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:27.210
 It's super high. Let's learn how to 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.279
 to make all the sun you need is 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.099
 of rice paper sheets and water 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:37.050
 filtered because it is a flower 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:39.719
 edible sun on a leaf 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.840
 I did some circles you can do. 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.860
 these circles with one is a well 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.379
 great 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.390
 or so I did here the model has 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.800
 about five centimeters 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.000
 diameter 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:58.739
 I put it here and I controlled it 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.460
 thus left to those who know no paper 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.699
 rice 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.760
 it has a smooth part that is the one that 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:08.610
 has more expense 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:12.890
 Let's start here to make a hobby. 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.890
 which will need eight vehicles 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:21.540
 to start with so you do not get a 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:26.310
 brush the look this is the smooth part ok 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:30.390
 this is the smooth part of the sheet and now 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:48.509
 You will look at the brush here with water. 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:49.950
 take away the excess and where each has a 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.170
 different format 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.259
 after you wet I 'll leave her 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:58.830
 sinning now the more they accept 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:01.709
 better it will take a 10 minutes to 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:05.549
 dry in the meantime we'll get some more 

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:07.740
 two petals that piece I'm going to use now 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.929
 that part that is thick 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:19.019
 I do not know if I can see it on the camera, but I'm going 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:21.950
 pick up the paper you can see and cut 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:21.950
 even the same 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:33.560
 and go get the brush water water here 

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:33.560
 pc of b 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:10.800
 so let's continue now I'll get 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:14.810
 with that extended part up and I'm going 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:17.760
 to cut the spiritist council member 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.800
 soltra traffic we are going to make a 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.970
 cone 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.970
 it's always difficult 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:53.820
 the rice leaf she is super delicate 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:55.050
 So who has to take care of us? 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:57.900
 Continue 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:04:03.870
 Now I'm going to leave a part if you think outside. 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:05.580
 and turn around making a straw to 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:09.200
 No need to go inside we'll stay 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.200
 spinning until it forms a straw 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:34.370
 good people we will use the brush and 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:40.790

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:43.070
 safe water a little necklace for not 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:47.420

 will give the grace of the rose she get a one 

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:54.280
 Little far from the other, you see. 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:05:00.650
 right above the petals 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:05:02.710
 plus a little water holds a 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:02.710
 little 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:13.650
 the last these here are the four 

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:13.650
 first of people 

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:25.300
 Good people know that guy one day in 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:27.970
 I told you I do 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:31.480
