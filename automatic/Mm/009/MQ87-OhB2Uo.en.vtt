pulpitis in the early stage we can see

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.609 
pulpitis in the early stage we can see

the terminology of hot tooth the hard

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.240 
the terminology of hot tooth the hard
truth<00:02:04.950> is<00:02:05.460> because<00:02:05.820> pain<00:02:06.659> is<00:02:06.990> caused<00:02:07.590> by<00:02:07.920> heat

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
truth is because pain is caused by heat

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.339 
truth is because pain is caused by heat
and<00:02:08.550> relieved<00:02:08.940> by<00:02:09.179> cold<00:02:10.220> heat<00:02:11.220> is<00:02:11.550> caused<00:02:11.940> by

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:12.349 
and relieved by cold heat is caused by

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:13.760 
and relieved by cold heat is caused by
vasodilatation<00:02:13.349> of

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
vasodilatation of

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.540 
vasodilatation of
vessels<00:02:14.130> and<00:02:14.400> expansion<00:02:15.270> of<00:02:15.390> fluids<00:02:15.900> which

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
vessels and expansion of fluids which

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.750 
vessels and expansion of fluids which
increases<00:02:17.550> which<00:02:17.940> increase<00:02:18.390> the<00:02:18.690> pressure

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
increases which increase the pressure

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.480 
increases which increase the pressure
called<00:02:20.760> causes<00:02:21.750> vasoconstriction<00:02:22.490> and

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
called causes vasoconstriction and

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.280 
called causes vasoconstriction and
contraction<00:02:24.150> of<00:02:24.210> fluids<00:02:24.690> therefore<00:02:25.110> it

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
contraction of fluids therefore it

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.680 
contraction of fluids therefore it
decreases<00:02:25.770> the<00:02:25.800> pressure<00:02:26.090> therefore<00:02:27.090> it

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
decreases the pressure therefore it

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.710 
decreases the pressure therefore it
decreases<00:02:28.260> pain<00:02:28.530> so<00:02:29.520> it's<00:02:29.910> common<00:02:30.360> to<00:02:30.390> see

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
decreases pain so it's common to see

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.540 
decreases pain so it's common to see
