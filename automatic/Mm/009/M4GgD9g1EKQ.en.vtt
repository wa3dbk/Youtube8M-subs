the<00:00:00.480> bits<00:00:00.719> of<00:00:00.840> experience<00:00:01.350> their<00:00:01.560> team<00:00:01.829> in<00:00:02.460> the

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:02.550 
the bits of experience their team in the

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:03.830 
the bits of experience their team in the
last<00:00:02.730> couple<00:00:02.909> of<00:00:03.030> days<00:00:03.210> and<00:00:03.419> I<00:00:03.480> think<00:00:03.689> that's

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 
last couple of days and I think that's

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.869 
last couple of days and I think that's
played<00:00:04.680> a<00:00:04.710> big<00:00:04.920> part<00:00:04.950> and<00:00:05.339> making<00:00:05.640> them<00:00:05.700> so

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
played a big part and making them so

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:07.909 
played a big part and making them so
resolute<00:00:06.299> and<00:00:06.509> credit<00:00:07.259> to<00:00:07.350> them<00:00:07.500> difficult

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
resolute and credit to them difficult

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.190 
resolute and credit to them difficult
they<00:00:08.189> made<00:00:08.370> it<00:00:08.490> for<00:00:08.700> us<00:00:08.870> but<00:00:09.870> we<00:00:09.960> needed

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
they made it for us but we needed

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.720 
they made it for us but we needed
patients<00:00:10.620> and<00:00:10.740> we<00:00:10.769> needed<00:00:11.040> the<00:00:11.190> crowd<00:00:11.580> to

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
patients and we needed the crowd to

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.240 
patients and we needed the crowd to
understand<00:00:12.530> what<00:00:13.530> we<00:00:13.620> were<00:00:13.650> playing<00:00:13.920> against

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
understand what we were playing against

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.410 
understand what we were playing against
I<00:00:14.340> probably<00:00:14.549> did<00:00:14.759> that<00:00:14.790> least<00:00:15.120> up<00:00:15.240> of<00:00:15.360> the

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
I probably did that least up of the

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.260 
I probably did that least up of the
players<00:00:15.630> and<00:00:16.010> thankfully<00:00:17.010> we<00:00:17.190> saw<00:00:18.029> the<00:00:18.090> game

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
players and thankfully we saw the game

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.620 
players and thankfully we saw the game
at<00:00:18.390> the<00:00:18.420> end<00:00:18.660> and<00:00:19.230> the<00:00:20.119> pools<00:00:21.119> were<00:00:21.240> doing<00:00:21.449> to

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
at the end and the pools were doing to

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.000 
at the end and the pools were doing to
go<00:00:21.689> up<00:00:21.779> about<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.140> first<00:00:22.350> goal<00:00:22.619> did<00:00:22.769> you<00:00:22.859> get<00:00:22.980> a

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
go up about the first goal did you get a

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.470 
go up about the first goal did you get a
good<00:00:23.189> view<00:00:23.340> of<00:00:23.460> Josh<00:00:23.640> I<00:00:23.939> thought<00:00:24.150> he's<00:00:24.269> fine

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
good view of Josh I thought he's fine

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.480 
good view of Josh I thought he's fine
yeah<00:00:25.050> that's<00:00:25.619> fine<00:00:25.769> for<00:00:25.830> my<00:00:26.070> viewer<00:00:26.340> for

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
yeah that's fine for my viewer for

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.820 
yeah that's fine for my viewer for
justify<00:00:26.910> his<00:00:27.060> chest

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
justify his chest

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.370 
justify his chest
just<00:00:29.039> a<00:00:29.130> really<00:00:29.280> good<00:00:29.430> call<00:00:29.580> for<00:00:29.789> grabs<00:00:30.539> until

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
just a really good call for grabs until

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.800 
just a really good call for grabs until
I<00:00:31.440> see<00:00:31.619> it<00:00:31.680> again<00:00:31.740> that<00:00:32.009> we<00:00:32.130> might<00:00:32.340> be<00:00:32.369> enough

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:32.810 
I see it again that we might be enough

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:34.970 
I see it again that we might be enough
were<00:00:33.810> you<00:00:33.900> pleased<00:00:34.140> with<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.380> reaction<00:00:34.739> of

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
were you pleased with the reaction of

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.500 
were you pleased with the reaction of
the<00:00:35.100> crowd<00:00:35.220> that<00:00:35.520> they<00:00:35.670> sort<00:00:36.120> of<00:00:36.150> stuck<00:00:36.360> with

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
the crowd that they sort of stuck with

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.510 
the crowd that they sort of stuck with
you<00:00:36.630> and<00:00:36.840> I<00:00:37.020> think<00:00:37.830> hopefully<00:00:37.980> they<00:00:38.250> can<00:00:38.309> see

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
you and I think hopefully they can see

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.280 
you and I think hopefully they can see
what<00:00:38.640> we're<00:00:38.730> trying<00:00:38.850> to<00:00:38.940> do<00:00:39.230> very<00:00:40.230> good

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
what we're trying to do very good

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.360 
what we're trying to do very good
football<00:00:40.470> is<00:00:40.680> in<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:40.830> team<00:00:41.010> you're<00:00:41.100> trying<00:00:41.309> to

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
football is in the team you're trying to

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.220 
football is in the team you're trying to
play<00:00:41.489> a<00:00:41.520> certain<00:00:41.700> way<00:00:41.970> we<00:00:42.870> want<00:00:43.080> to<00:00:43.170> be

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
play a certain way we want to be

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.600 
play a certain way we want to be
progressively<00:00:43.680> want<00:00:43.890> to<00:00:43.950> score<00:00:44.100> goals<00:00:44.160> want

progressively want to score goals want
to<00:00:44.670> create<00:00:44.820> chances<00:00:45.949> back<00:00:46.949> teams<00:00:47.280> can<00:00:47.489> try<00:00:47.730> and

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:47.790 
to create chances back teams can try and

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:49.250 
to create chances back teams can try and
stop<00:00:47.970> you<00:00:48.059> that's<00:00:48.330> their<00:00:48.570> right<00:00:48.750> and<00:00:48.930> they

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
stop you that's their right and they

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.750 
stop you that's their right and they
will<00:00:49.410> do<00:00:49.530> whatever<00:00:49.860> they<00:00:50.070> can<00:00:50.160> to<00:00:50.400> try<00:00:50.730> and

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
will do whatever they can to try and

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.110 
will do whatever they can to try and
combat<00:00:51.350> our<00:00:52.350> style<00:00:52.650> of<00:00:52.710> play<00:00:52.890> so<00:00:53.190> what's<00:00:53.970> worse

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
combat our style of play so what's worse

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.340 
combat our style of play so what's worse
at<00:00:54.300> d<00:00:54.650> six<00:00:55.650> of<00:00:55.769> their<00:00:55.860> players<00:00:56.040> didn't<00:00:56.340> move

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
at d six of their players didn't move

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.200 
at d six of their players didn't move
from<00:00:58.800> protecting<00:00:59.070> their<00:00:59.340> goal<00:00:59.489> and<00:00:59.730> it<00:01:00.090> was

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
from protecting their goal and it was

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.849 
from protecting their goal and it was
difficult<00:01:00.359> to<00:01:00.600> break<00:01:00.780> down<00:01:00.989> perhaps<00:01:01.680> at<00:01:01.829> times

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
difficult to break down perhaps at times

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.429 
difficult to break down perhaps at times
we<00:01:02.390> we<00:01:03.390> chose<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.719> wrong<00:01:03.809> box<00:01:03.960> from<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.229> vinyl

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
we we chose the wrong box from the vinyl

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:05.600 
we we chose the wrong box from the vinyl
third<00:01:04.680> probably<00:01:04.979> didn't<00:01:05.129> put<00:01:05.250> enough<00:01:05.309> balls

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
third probably didn't put enough balls

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.399 
third probably didn't put enough balls
in<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.790> box<00:01:05.970> first<00:01:06.150> half<00:01:06.450> try<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.229> rectify

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
in the box first half try to rectify

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.710 
in the box first half try to rectify
that<00:01:07.740> second<00:01:08.070> half<00:01:08.250> and<00:01:08.430> thank<00:01:09.270> move<00:01:09.420> on<00:01:09.600> again

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
that second half and thank move on again

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.420 
that second half and thank move on again
do<00:01:10.080> you<00:01:10.170> think<00:01:10.320> that<00:01:10.440> could<00:01:10.470> be<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.860> tone<00:01:11.130> from

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
do you think that could be the tone from

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.280 
do you think that could be the tone from
here<00:01:11.640> on<00:01:11.759> in<00:01:11.909> at<00:01:12.000> home<00:01:12.210> I<00:01:12.479> think<00:01:13.049> it's<00:01:13.170> been<00:01:13.259> a

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
here on in at home I think it's been a

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.660 
here on in at home I think it's been a
tow<00:01:13.500> for<00:01:13.530> a<00:01:13.770> while<00:01:13.920> I<00:01:13.950> don't<00:01:14.310> think<00:01:14.490> it's<00:01:14.610> just

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
tow for a while I don't think it's just

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.160 
tow for a while I don't think it's just
Portsmouth<00:01:15.360> I<00:01:15.450> think<00:01:15.600> a<00:01:15.630> lot<00:01:15.780> of<00:01:15.810> teams<00:01:16.020> have

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
Portsmouth I think a lot of teams have

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.080 
Portsmouth I think a lot of teams have
done<00:01:16.229> that<00:01:16.409> to<00:01:16.470> us<00:01:16.710> I'm<00:01:17.340> sure<00:01:17.610> plenty<00:01:17.789> more

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
done that to us I'm sure plenty more

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.120 
done that to us I'm sure plenty more
