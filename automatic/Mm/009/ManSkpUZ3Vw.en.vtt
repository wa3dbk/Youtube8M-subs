sedan version of that coupe
so<00:00:16.619> here<00:00:16.800> we<00:00:16.890> are<00:00:16.920> the<00:00:17.310> 2015<00:00:18.000> BMW<00:00:18.529> 428<00:00:19.529> i<00:00:19.560> grand

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
so here we are the 2015 BMW 428 i grand

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.040 
so here we are the 2015 BMW 428 i grand
coupe<00:00:20.310> we're<00:00:21.029> wondering<00:00:21.210> what's<00:00:21.539> the<00:00:21.660> point

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
coupe we're wondering what's the point

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.540 
coupe we're wondering what's the point
let's<00:00:22.410> hop<00:00:22.529> behind<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:22.920> wheel<00:00:23.039> and<00:00:23.220> see<00:00:23.400> if<00:00:23.460> we

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
let's hop behind the wheel and see if we

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:32.280 
let's hop behind the wheel and see if we
can't<00:00:23.760> figure<00:00:23.880> it<00:00:24.150> out

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:32.290 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.479 

now<00:00:33.290> the<00:00:33.350> key<00:00:33.559> feature<00:00:33.829> is<00:00:34.010> gonna<00:00:34.190> keep<00:00:34.430> the

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:34.489 
now the key feature is gonna keep the

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:36.280 
now the key feature is gonna keep the
grand<00:00:34.850> coupe<00:00:35.090> from<00:00:35.270> being<00:00:35.480> redundant<00:00:36.050> to<00:00:36.200> the

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:36.290 
grand coupe from being redundant to the

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:38.619 
grand coupe from being redundant to the
sedan<00:00:36.680> it's<00:00:37.160> gonna<00:00:37.309> be<00:00:37.489> this<00:00:37.730> rear<00:00:38.360> power

00:00:38.619 --> 00:00:38.629 
sedan it's gonna be this rear power

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:39.700 
sedan it's gonna be this rear power
opening<00:00:39.170> liftgate

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 
opening liftgate

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:41.260 
opening liftgate
it's<00:00:40.070> gonna<00:00:40.160> give<00:00:40.340> you<00:00:40.430> a<00:00:40.489> much<00:00:40.699> larger

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:41.270 
it's gonna give you a much larger

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.119 
it's gonna give you a much larger
opening<00:00:41.720> than<00:00:41.870> a<00:00:41.900> trunk<00:00:42.290> and<00:00:42.710> get<00:00:42.829> some

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:43.129 
opening than a trunk and get some

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:44.979 
opening than a trunk and get some
bulkier<00:00:43.610> items<00:00:43.640> in<00:00:44.120> there<00:00:44.329> you<00:00:44.660> can<00:00:44.809> even

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:44.989 
bulkier items in there you can even

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:47.020 
bulkier items in there you can even
knock<00:00:45.170> those<00:00:45.379> seats<00:00:45.710> down<00:00:45.949> to<00:00:46.280> get<00:00:46.430> really<00:00:46.850> big

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 
knock those seats down to get really big

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:48.460 
knock those seats down to get really big
items<00:00:47.390> in<00:00:47.600> and<00:00:47.809> I<00:00:47.839> think<00:00:47.900> that's<00:00:48.170> gonna<00:00:48.260> give

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:48.470 
items in and I think that's gonna give

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:50.560 
items in and I think that's gonna give
this<00:00:48.589> vehicle<00:00:48.980> a<00:00:49.070> lot<00:00:49.250> more<00:00:49.460> utility<00:00:50.059> without

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570 
this vehicle a lot more utility without

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.390 
this vehicle a lot more utility without
looking<00:00:50.930> like<00:00:50.960> a<00:00:51.110> hatchback<00:00:51.410> I<00:00:51.949> really<00:00:52.250> like

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:52.400 
looking like a hatchback I really like

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.700 
looking like a hatchback I really like
this<00:00:52.780> now<00:00:53.780> here<00:00:53.960> in<00:00:54.050> the<00:00:54.110> cabin<00:00:54.440> we've<00:00:54.559> got

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:54.710 
this now here in the cabin we've got

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.530 
this now here in the cabin we've got
this<00:00:54.829> really<00:00:55.190> nice<00:00:55.489> red<00:00:55.879> interior<00:00:56.329> that<00:00:56.449> I

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:56.540 
this really nice red interior that I

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.420 
this really nice red interior that I
think<00:00:56.750> contrasts<00:00:57.379> nicely<00:00:57.500> with<00:00:58.070> the<00:00:58.159> blue

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:58.430 
think contrasts nicely with the blue

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:00.250 
think contrasts nicely with the blue
exterior<00:00:58.850> the<00:00:59.540> fit<00:00:59.750> and<00:00:59.870> finish<00:00:59.960> is<00:01:00.230> really

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
exterior the fit and finish is really

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.130 
exterior the fit and finish is really
good<00:01:00.800> in<00:01:01.010> the<00:01:01.190> cabin<00:01:01.489> here<00:01:01.699> but<00:01:02.269> the<00:01:02.600> dashboard

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 
good in the cabin here but the dashboard

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.770 
good in the cabin here but the dashboard
tech<00:01:03.350> is<00:01:03.530> a<00:01:03.589> little<00:01:04.100> bit<00:01:04.220> disappointing<00:01:05.059> for

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
tech is a little bit disappointing for

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.510 
tech is a little bit disappointing for
example<00:01:06.080> we've<00:01:06.200> got<00:01:06.380> over<00:01:06.470> $10,000<00:01:07.369> in

sometimes this is an interface that's a

sometimes this is an interface that's a
little<00:01:23.539> maddening<00:01:24.050> and<00:01:24.200> sometimes<00:01:24.619> it<00:01:24.770> just

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
we got the iDrive controller right here

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.150 
we got the iDrive controller right here
that<00:01:29.780> you'll<00:01:29.929> control<00:01:30.259> everything<00:01:30.530> with<00:01:30.740> and

that you'll control everything with and

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:32.710 
that you'll control everything with and
right<00:01:31.399> here<00:01:31.640> next<00:01:31.880> to<00:01:32.030> the<00:01:32.210> transmission

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 
right here next to the transmission

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.109 
right here next to the transmission
we've<00:01:33.320> got<00:01:33.500> a<00:01:33.530> couple<00:01:33.800> of<00:01:33.950> other<00:01:34.100> controls<00:01:34.580> for

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
we've got a couple of other controls for

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:36.640 
we've got a couple of other controls for
one<00:01:35.240> of<00:01:35.360> our<00:01:35.479> only<00:01:35.630> safety<00:01:35.900> features<00:01:36.409> that's

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.650 
one of our only safety features that's

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.130 
one of our only safety features that's
gonna<00:01:36.770> be<00:01:37.040> this<00:01:37.460> sort<00:01:37.670> of<00:01:37.759> camera<00:01:38.030> system<00:01:38.600> so

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
gonna be this sort of camera system so
