in a container and I preferred it in a

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.120 
in a container and I preferred it in a
bigger<00:02:30.390> container<00:02:30.840> so<00:02:31.170> all<00:02:31.560> we<00:02:31.769> would<00:02:31.800> have<00:02:32.010> to

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.479 
bigger container so all we would have to
do<00:02:32.310> is<00:02:32.670> microwave<00:02:33.450> it<00:02:33.630> and<00:02:34.160> it<00:02:35.160> would<00:02:35.310> already

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
do is microwave it and it would already

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:38.809 
do is microwave it and it would already
be<00:02:35.670> cut<00:02:35.910> up<00:02:35.940> actually<00:02:36.660> so<00:02:37.610> microwave<00:02:38.610> it<00:02:38.730> and
