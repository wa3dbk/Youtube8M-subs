which is a big drifting air to fakie off

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.289 
which is a big drifting air to fakie off
the<00:00:13.469> first<00:00:13.740> hit<00:00:13.950> into<00:00:14.400> her<00:00:14.519> first<00:00:14.790> big<00:00:14.969> spin

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.219 

to<00:00:53.230> point<00:00:53.469> out<00:00:53.649> to<00:00:53.829> everyone<00:00:54.870> you<00:00:55.870> might<00:00:56.050> not

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.030 
think that it was that gnarly because

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.389 
think that it was that gnarly because
she<00:00:58.539> wasn't<00:00:58.719> sketching<00:00:59.379> because<00:00:59.649> she<00:00:59.949> was<00:01:00.100> so

00:01:00.389 --> 00:01:00.399 
she wasn't sketching because she was so

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:02.729 
she wasn't sketching because she was so
rock<00:01:00.699> solid<00:01:01.030> sometimes<00:01:01.989> that<00:01:02.199> will<00:01:02.320> throw<00:01:02.559> the
