and he was interested in how chimps

and he was interested in how chimps
think<00:00:52.680> why<00:00:53.040> because<00:00:53.550> chimps<00:00:53.850> are<00:00:53.970> our<00:00:54.090> closest

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:54.650 
think why because chimps are our closest

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:58.670 
think why because chimps are our closest
ancestor<00:00:55.700> yes<00:00:56.750> through<00:00:57.750> shared<00:00:58.140> derived

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
closest living relatives you can argue

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.820 
closest living relatives you can argue
about<00:01:05.150> whether<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.720> small<00:01:07.110> chimps<00:01:07.560> that<00:01:07.740> are

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
about whether the small chimps that are

about whether the small chimps that are
a<00:01:07.860> different<00:01:08.070> species<00:01:08.520> are<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.299> same<00:01:09.509> we're

a different species are the same we're

a different species are the same we're

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
not going to have that argument but that

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.590 
not going to have that argument but that
group<00:01:14.009> is<00:01:14.219> certainly<00:01:14.579> our<00:01:14.759> closest<00:01:15.210> relative

of how complex your thought process is

of how complex your thought process is
is<00:01:26.819> what<00:01:27.060> you<00:01:27.179> can<00:01:27.390> communicate<00:01:27.960> about

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
is what you can communicate about

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.249 
is what you can communicate about
something<00:01:28.590> that's<00:01:28.740> hidden<00:01:29.719> you<00:01:30.719> communicate

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
something that's hidden you communicate

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.319 
something that's hidden you communicate
about<00:01:31.350> hidden<00:01:31.590> stuff<00:01:31.859> all<00:01:32.039> the<00:01:32.189> time<00:01:32.329> every

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
about hidden stuff all the time every

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.980 
about hidden stuff all the time every
time<00:01:33.359> you<00:01:33.840> ask<00:01:34.049> somebody<00:01:34.499> where<00:01:34.859> is<00:01:35.990> you

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
time you ask somebody where is you

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.709 
time you ask somebody where is you
communicated<00:01:37.590> about<00:01:37.649> something<00:01:38.069> hidden<00:01:38.719> you

00:01:39.709 --> 00:01:39.719 
communicated about something hidden you

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:41.059 
communicated about something hidden you
know<00:01:39.810> I<00:01:39.840> had<00:01:40.079> to<00:01:40.170> ask<00:01:40.200> five<00:01:40.530> people<00:01:40.859> where<00:01:40.979> the

00:01:41.059 --> 00:01:41.069 
know I had to ask five people where the

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:42.739 
know I had to ask five people where the
bathrooms<00:01:41.490> were<00:01:41.670> I<00:01:41.939> got<00:01:42.179> five<00:01:42.569> different

00:01:42.739 --> 00:01:42.749 
bathrooms were I got five different

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:44.359 
bathrooms were I got five different
answers<00:01:43.020> by<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.439> way<00:01:43.590> none<00:01:43.920> of<00:01:43.950> which<00:01:44.159> were

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
answers by the way none of which were

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.449 
answers by the way none of which were
correct<00:01:44.700> but<00:01:45.600> so<00:01:46.109> they<00:01:46.259> remained<00:01:46.710> hidden

00:01:47.449 --> 00:01:47.459 
correct but so they remained hidden

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:51.020 
correct but so they remained hidden
but<00:01:48.740> you<00:01:49.740> communicate<00:01:50.280> about<00:01:50.399> hidden<00:01:50.700> stuff

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
but you communicate about hidden stuff

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.660 
but you communicate about hidden stuff
all<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.389> time<00:01:51.950> that's<00:01:52.950> a<00:01:53.159> pretty<00:01:53.369> hard<00:01:53.639> thing

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
all the time that's a pretty hard thing

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.879 
all the time that's a pretty hard thing
to<00:01:53.969> communicate<00:01:54.600> because<00:01:54.929> it<00:01:55.079> requires<00:01:55.499> the

00:01:55.879 --> 00:01:55.889 
to communicate because it requires the

00:01:55.889 --> 00:01:58.399 
to communicate because it requires the
understanding<00:01:56.759> of<00:01:56.939> the<00:01:57.209> abstract<00:01:57.780> state<00:01:58.109> and

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
understanding of the abstract state and

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.340 
understanding of the abstract state and
the<00:01:58.829> ability<00:01:59.429> to<00:01:59.700> give<00:02:00.240> cohesive<00:02:00.869> directions

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
the ability to give cohesive directions

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.379 
the ability to give cohesive directions
when<00:02:01.529> there<00:02:01.679> is<00:02:01.799> no<00:02:01.920> map<00:02:02.569> so<00:02:03.569> it's<00:02:03.719> complex<00:02:04.159> and

00:02:05.379 --> 00:02:05.389 
when there is no map so it's complex and

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:07.399 
when there is no map so it's complex and
they<00:02:06.389> decided<00:02:06.810> that<00:02:06.840> they<00:02:07.049> would<00:02:07.200> look<00:02:07.350> for

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
they decided that they would look for

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.020 
they decided that they would look for
the<00:02:07.649> ability<00:02:07.829> to<00:02:08.069> communicate<00:02:08.640> about<00:02:08.729> him

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
the ability to communicate about him

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.270 
the ability to communicate about him
stuff<00:02:09.360> and<00:02:09.509> chimps<00:02:09.840> and<00:02:10.619> the<00:02:10.770> question<00:02:11.160> was

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
stuff and chimps and the question was

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.679 
stuff and chimps and the question was
raised<00:02:11.490> by<00:02:11.670> somebody<00:02:11.970> in<00:02:12.060> the<00:02:12.120> lab<00:02:12.300> well<00:02:12.540> what

00:02:12.679 --> 00:02:12.689 
raised by somebody in the lab well what

00:02:12.689 --> 00:02:13.940 
raised by somebody in the lab well what
if<00:02:12.780> it's<00:02:12.930> not<00:02:13.110> through<00:02:13.470> shared<00:02:13.709> derived

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
if it's not through shared derived

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.559 
if it's not through shared derived
character<00:02:14.459> traits<00:02:14.730> what<00:02:15.090> if<00:02:15.239> this<00:02:15.420> is

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
character traits what if this is

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.059 
character traits what if this is
something<00:02:15.900> that<00:02:15.930> you<00:02:16.170> learn<00:02:16.439> by<00:02:16.709> living<00:02:17.040> with

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
something that you learn by living with

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:17.920 
something that you learn by living with
you

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
you

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.420 
you
so<00:02:18.930> they<00:02:19.080> decided<00:02:19.350> to<00:02:19.470> work<00:02:19.620> on<00:02:19.770> domestic<00:02:20.220> dogs

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
so they decided to work on domestic dogs

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.700 
so they decided to work on domestic dogs
also<00:02:20.790> and<00:02:21.690> then<00:02:21.810> somebody<00:02:22.110> else<00:02:22.320> in<00:02:22.500> the<00:02:22.560> lab

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
also and then somebody else in the lab

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:29.270 
also and then somebody else in the lab
said<00:02:24.800> what<00:02:25.800> if<00:02:25.950> it's<00:02:26.540> really<00:02:27.540> you<00:02:28.260> know<00:02:28.290> we're

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
said what if it's really you know we're

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.350 
said what if it's really you know we're
using<00:02:29.930> humans<00:02:30.930> as<00:02:31.110> the<00:02:31.260> control<00:02:31.650> for<00:02:31.890> chimps

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
using humans as the control for chimps

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.550 
using humans as the control for chimps
what<00:02:33.360> are<00:02:33.420> we<00:02:33.510> gonna<00:02:33.600> use<00:02:33.690> is<00:02:34.020> the<00:02:34.050> control<00:02:34.530> for

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
what are we gonna use is the control for

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.500 
what are we gonna use is the control for
domestic<00:02:35.310> dogs<00:02:35.550> I<00:02:35.820> mean<00:02:35.850> what<00:02:36.120> if<00:02:36.210> this<00:02:36.360> is

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
domestic dogs I mean what if this is

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:37.850 
domestic dogs I mean what if this is
just<00:02:36.630> a<00:02:36.930> canine<00:02:37.320> thing

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
just a canine thing

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.310 
just a canine thing

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
so they used hand rude walls they've now

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.200 
so they used hand rude walls they've now
got<00:02:40.470> hand<00:02:40.680> rolls<00:02:41.040> domestic<00:02:41.520> dogs<00:02:41.730> and<00:02:41.940> chimps

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.210 
got hand rolls domestic dogs and chimps

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:44.240 
got hand rolls domestic dogs and chimps
and<00:02:42.390> they're<00:02:43.050> going<00:02:43.230> to<00:02:43.410> hide<00:02:43.680> something<00:02:44.220> that

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
and they're going to hide something that

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:45.800 
and they're going to hide something that
those<00:02:44.460> animals<00:02:44.700> would<00:02:45.060> want<00:02:45.300> but<00:02:45.510> cannot

those animals would want but cannot

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:46.910 
those animals would want but cannot
smell<00:02:46.170> because<00:02:46.470> of<00:02:46.500> the<00:02:46.620> way<00:02:46.710> they've<00:02:46.890> handled

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
smell because of the way they've handled

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.510 
smell because of the way they've handled
it<00:02:47.460> and<00:02:47.640> a<00:02:48.210> human<00:02:48.570> is<00:02:48.720> going<00:02:48.990> to<00:02:49.110> signal<00:02:49.520> where

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
it and a human is going to signal where

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.340 
it and a human is going to signal where
the<00:02:50.910> stuff<00:02:51.150> is<00:02:51.300> hitting<00:02:51.600> by<00:02:51.750> doing<00:02:52.110> one<00:02:52.320> of

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
the stuff is hitting by doing one of

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.470 
the stuff is hitting by doing one of
three<00:02:52.650> things<00:02:52.830> the<00:02:53.250> human<00:02:53.550> is<00:02:53.670> going<00:02:53.730> to<00:02:54.150> walk

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
three things the human is going to walk

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.000 
three things the human is going to walk
up<00:02:54.690> to<00:02:54.720> the<00:02:54.840> box<00:02:55.110> their<00:02:55.320> box<00:02:55.530> it's<00:02:55.710> everywhere

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
up to the box their box it's everywhere

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.530 
up to the box their box it's everywhere
they're<00:02:56.460> going<00:02:56.580> to<00:02:56.640> walk<00:02:56.790> up<00:02:56.970> to<00:02:57.090> the<00:02:57.180> box<00:02:57.360> and

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
they're going to walk up to the box and

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.620 
they're going to walk up to the box and
they're<00:02:57.660> gonna<00:02:57.750> go<00:02:58.790> okay<00:02:59.790> most<00:03:00.180> of<00:03:00.330> you<00:03:00.480> would

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
they're gonna go okay most of you would

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.780 
they're gonna go okay most of you would
probably<00:03:00.810> open<00:03:01.500> the<00:03:01.620> lid<00:03:01.800> then<00:03:02.040> they're<00:03:02.670> at<00:03:02.760> a

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
probably open the lid then they're at a

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.080 
probably open the lid then they're at a
point<00:03:04.070> you<00:03:05.070> might<00:03:05.220> expect<00:03:05.550> a<00:03:05.640> dogs<00:03:05.820> could<00:03:05.970> do

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
point you might expect a dogs could do

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:12.020 
point you might expect a dogs could do
that<00:03:06.240> because<00:03:06.450> they're<00:03:07.260> pointers<00:03:09.950> bird<00:03:11.030> there

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
that because they're pointers bird there

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:52.420 
one of those three species who was able
to<00:03:49.290> do<00:03:49.500> all<00:03:49.680> of<00:03:49.709> those<00:03:49.980> was<00:03:50.220> the<00:03:50.250> domestic<00:03:50.760> dog

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
to do all of those was the domestic dog

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.040 
to do all of those was the domestic dog
domestic<00:03:53.430> dog<00:03:53.640> share<00:03:54.180> our<00:03:54.510> cognitive

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.050 
domestic dog share our cognitive

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:57.350 
domestic dog share our cognitive
processes<00:03:55.920> in<00:03:56.190> ways<00:03:56.370> we<00:03:56.580> cannot<00:03:56.850> even<00:03:57.150> begin

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 
processes in ways we cannot even begin

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:58.520 
processes in ways we cannot even begin
to<00:03:57.540> understand

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
to understand

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.240 
to understand
and<00:03:58.980> I<00:03:59.970> argue<00:04:00.240> and<00:04:00.750> I<00:04:00.990> can't<00:04:01.230> prove<00:04:01.410> it<00:04:01.530> yet<00:04:01.740> but

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
and I argue and I can't prove it yet but

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.460 
and I argue and I can't prove it yet but
I've<00:04:02.520> certainly<00:04:02.730> spurred<00:04:03.420> on<00:04:03.570> Adamek<00:04:04.170> Losey

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
I've certainly spurred on Adamek Losey

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.290 
I've certainly spurred on Adamek Losey
and<00:04:04.740> hungry<00:04:05.160> to<00:04:05.250> begin<00:04:05.490> to<00:04:05.610> think<00:04:05.790> about<00:04:06.090> this

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:06.300 
and hungry to begin to think about this

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.840 
and hungry to begin to think about this
I<00:04:06.540> think<00:04:07.230> that<00:04:07.530> we<00:04:07.620> probably<00:04:07.800> coevals<00:04:08.640> with

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:08.850 
I think that we probably coevals with

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:14.540 
I think that we probably coevals with
dogs<00:04:09.090> I<00:04:09.570> think<00:04:10.050> that<00:04:10.860> I<00:04:13.310> think<00:04:14.310> there<00:04:14.430> are<00:04:14.459> a

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:14.550 
dogs I think that I think there are a

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:15.830 
dogs I think that I think there are a
lot<00:04:14.580> of<00:04:14.700> things<00:04:14.940> going<00:04:15.090> on<00:04:15.239> that<00:04:15.300> we<00:04:15.450> can't

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
lot of things going on that we can't

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.900 
lot of things going on that we can't
understand<00:04:16.590> most<00:04:17.190> people<00:04:17.520> would<00:04:17.640> argue<00:04:17.700> that

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
understand most people would argue that

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.610 
understand most people would argue that
yes<00:04:18.150> dogs<00:04:18.480> are<00:04:18.660> domesticated<00:04:19.140> I<00:04:19.350> think<00:04:19.560> it

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
yes dogs are domesticated I think it

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:20.690 
yes dogs are domesticated I think it
goes<00:04:19.770> further<00:04:19.950> than<00:04:20.070> that<00:04:20.340> I<00:04:20.370> think<00:04:20.459> we

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
goes further than that I think we

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.360 
goes further than that I think we
co-evolved<00:04:21.419> with<00:04:21.480> them<00:04:21.720> I<00:04:21.930> think<00:04:22.320> that<00:04:22.800> human

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
co-evolved with them I think that human

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.550 
co-evolved with them I think that human
brains<00:04:23.640> and<00:04:23.910> dog<00:04:24.180> brains<00:04:24.540> work<00:04:24.870> more<00:04:25.200> alike

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
brains and dog brains work more alike

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.070 
brains and dog brains work more alike
than<00:04:25.590> any<00:04:26.160> other<00:04:26.400> two<00:04:26.669> species<00:04:27.090> out<00:04:27.270> there

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 
than any other two species out there

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.010 
than any other two species out there
and<00:04:28.409> I<00:04:29.340> think<00:04:29.699> that's<00:04:29.940> because<00:04:30.210> we<00:04:30.690> were<00:04:30.810> able

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
and I think that's because we were able

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.860 
and I think that's because we were able
to<00:04:31.050> recognize<00:04:31.620> a<00:04:31.650> like<00:04:31.979> social<00:04:32.400> system<00:04:32.870> dogs

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
to recognize a like social system dogs

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:35.390 
to recognize a like social system dogs
were<00:04:34.080> able<00:04:34.319> to<00:04:34.349> recognize<00:04:34.889> our<00:04:35.069> vocalizations

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
were able to recognize our vocalizations

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.070 
were able to recognize our vocalizations
because<00:04:36.030> actually<00:04:36.360> they're<00:04:36.509> very<00:04:36.539> much<00:04:36.840> like

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.080 
because actually they're very much like

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:38.450 
because actually they're very much like
theirs<00:04:37.319> and<00:04:37.500> I<00:04:37.560> give<00:04:37.740> all<00:04:37.860> the<00:04:37.889> credit<00:04:38.009> to<00:04:38.310> the

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
theirs and I give all the credit to the

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.010 
theirs and I give all the credit to the
dog<00:04:38.669> in<00:04:38.699> this<00:04:39.000> relationship<00:04:39.629> because<00:04:39.750> I'm<00:04:39.930> not

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
dog in this relationship because I'm not

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:41.719 
dog in this relationship because I'm not
sure<00:04:40.229> humans<00:04:40.740> would<00:04:40.889> have<00:04:40.919> taken<00:04:41.190> the<00:04:41.370> first

00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:41.729 
sure humans would have taken the first

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:44.600 
sure humans would have taken the first
step<00:04:42.229> we<00:04:43.229> certainly<00:04:43.650> recognize<00:04:44.039> that<00:04:44.430> dogs

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
step we certainly recognize that dogs

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.189 
step we certainly recognize that dogs
could<00:04:44.849> keep<00:04:45.030> us<00:04:45.180> warm<00:04:45.389> and<00:04:45.629> I<00:04:45.690> think<00:04:45.900> that<00:04:46.050> was

00:04:46.189 --> 00:04:46.199 
could keep us warm and I think that was

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:48.260 
could keep us warm and I think that was
one<00:04:46.379> of<00:04:46.409> the<00:04:46.560> prime<00:04:46.979> functions<00:04:47.580> of<00:04:47.759> early<00:04:48.060> dogs

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
one of the prime functions of early dogs

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:51.770 
one of the prime functions of early dogs
and<00:04:48.509> no<00:04:48.690> one<00:04:48.870> talks<00:04:49.080> about<00:04:49.229> it<00:04:49.610> yet<00:04:50.610> in<00:04:51.150> very

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780 
and no one talks about it yet in very

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:56.719 
and no one talks about it yet in very
ancient<00:04:52.699> cave<00:04:53.699> dwellings<00:04:55.430> canine<00:04:56.430> fur<00:04:56.669> is

00:04:56.719 --> 00:04:56.729 
ancient cave dwellings canine fur is

00:04:56.729 --> 00:04:59.719 
ancient cave dwellings canine fur is
often<00:04:57.330> found<00:04:57.569> with<00:04:58.020> human<00:04:58.470> skeletons<00:04:58.979> so<00:04:59.669> I

00:04:59.719 --> 00:04:59.729 
often found with human skeletons so I

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:03.559 
often found with human skeletons so I
think<00:04:59.819> that<00:05:00.150> that<00:05:00.389> was<00:05:00.599> important<00:05:01.199> and<00:05:02.569> we

00:05:03.559 --> 00:05:03.569 
think that that was important and we

00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:04.909 
think that that was important and we
rely<00:05:03.870> on<00:05:03.900> them<00:05:04.199> for<00:05:04.379> all<00:05:04.440> sorts<00:05:04.469> of<00:05:04.800> other

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:04.919 
rely on them for all sorts of other

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:06.800 
rely on them for all sorts of other
things<00:05:05.039> and<00:05:05.490> we<00:05:05.639> Co<00:05:05.819> evolved<00:05:06.270> in<00:05:06.389> part<00:05:06.629> because

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:06.810 
things and we Co evolved in part because

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:09.350 
things and we Co evolved in part because
we<00:05:07.409> shared<00:05:07.680> a<00:05:07.800> social<00:05:08.159> system<00:05:08.340> so<00:05:09.030> this<00:05:09.090> is<00:05:09.210> the

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 
we shared a social system so this is the

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.510 
we shared a social system so this is the
first<00:05:09.509> piece<00:05:09.750> of<00:05:09.780> work<00:05:09.930> that<00:05:10.259> said<00:05:10.500> mmm<00:05:10.889> your

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 
first piece of work that said mmm your

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.159 
first piece of work that said mmm your
dog<00:05:11.729> may<00:05:11.969> be<00:05:12.000> a<00:05:12.120> lot<00:05:12.330> smarter<00:05:12.539> than<00:05:12.690> you<00:05:12.870> think

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:13.169 
dog may be a lot smarter than you think

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:15.920 
dog may be a lot smarter than you think
the<00:05:14.129> second<00:05:14.520> piece<00:05:14.699> came<00:05:15.270> out<00:05:15.419> in<00:05:15.599> June<00:05:15.780> of

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:15.930 
the second piece came out in June of

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:18.860 
the second piece came out in June of
2004<00:05:16.740> and<00:05:16.830> it's<00:05:16.979> only<00:05:17.129> one<00:05:17.520> dog<00:05:17.789> but<00:05:18.539> this<00:05:18.659> is<00:05:18.840> a

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:18.870 
2004 and it's only one dog but this is a

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:23.120 
2004 and it's only one dog but this is a
dog<00:05:19.139> a<00:05:19.409> border<00:05:19.710> collie<00:05:19.860> of<00:05:20.250> course<00:05:20.639> by<00:05:21.060> the
