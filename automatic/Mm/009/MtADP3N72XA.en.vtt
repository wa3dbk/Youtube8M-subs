00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
see like with mine I need to cut it a

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:11.440 
see like with mine I need to cut it a
little<00:03:05.209> more<00:03:05.660> because<00:03:06.260> not<00:03:06.650> wide<00:03:06.950> enough<00:03:10.450> see

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
little more because not wide enough see

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:17.530 
to this thing up here to the part where

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:18.960 
to this thing up here to the part where
you're<00:04:17.680> going<00:04:17.829> to<00:04:17.889> put<00:04:17.919> the<00:04:18.190> tape<00:04:18.430> in<00:04:18.459> a<00:04:18.729> sec

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970 
you're going to put the tape in a sec

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.240 
you're going to put the tape in a sec
okay<00:04:19.840> now<00:04:20.199> you're<00:04:20.349> going<00:04:20.470> to<00:04:20.560> slide<00:04:20.949> your

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250

okay now you're going to slide your
finger<00:04:21.549> down<00:04:21.579> just<00:04:22.030> a<00:04:22.150> little<00:04:22.330> and<00:04:22.660> then

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
finger down just a little and then

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:28.320 
finger down just a little and then
you're<00:04:24.250> going<00:04:24.490> to<00:04:26.250> target<00:04:27.250> it<00:04:27.520> as<00:04:27.639> centered<00:04:28.210> as

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.330 
you're going to target it as centered as

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.020 
you're going to target it as centered as
possible<00:04:28.949> okay<00:04:29.949> then<00:04:30.610> you're<00:04:30.699> going<00:04:30.849> to<00:04:30.910> get

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
possible okay then you're going to get

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.409 
possible okay then you're going to get
some<00:04:31.300> tape<00:04:31.599> doesn't<00:04:32.410> matter<00:04:32.680> what's<00:04:32.919> kind

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:33.419 
some tape doesn't matter what's kind

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:36.570 
some tape doesn't matter what's kind
just<00:04:34.419> try<00:04:34.930> to<00:04:34.960> get<00:04:35.259> a<00:04:35.500> stronger<00:04:35.919> tight<00:04:36.250> because

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580 
just try to get a stronger tight because

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.930 
just try to get a stronger tight because
these<00:04:37.210> can<00:04:37.990> get<00:04:38.169> quite<00:04:39.039> a<00:04:39.099> bit<00:04:39.220> of<00:04:39.460> pressure<00:04:39.729> on

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:39.940 
these can get quite a bit of pressure on

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:47.040 
these can get quite a bit of pressure on
them<00:04:40.240> so<00:04:41.199> then<00:04:42.690> you<00:04:43.690> wrap<00:04:44.199> it<00:04:44.229> around<00:04:45.840> wrap<00:04:46.840> it

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
them so then you wrap it around wrap it

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.680 
them so then you wrap it around wrap it
around<00:04:47.370> wrap<00:04:48.370> it<00:04:48.550> on<00:04:48.669> a<00:04:48.699> few<00:04:49.030> times<00:04:49.800> but<00:04:50.800> then

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:51.690 
around wrap it on a few times but then

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:55.680 
around wrap it on a few times but then
when<00:04:52.690> you<00:04:53.199> wrapped<00:04:53.470> it<00:04:53.620> around<00:04:53.740> at<00:04:54.130> least<00:04:54.690> six

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:55.690 
when you wrapped it around at least six

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:58.770 
when you wrapped it around at least six
or<00:04:55.930> seven<00:04:56.289> times<00:04:56.320> at<00:04:57.240> least<00:04:58.240> you<00:04:58.419> can<00:04:58.539> do<00:04:58.660> as

00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:58.780 
or seven times at least you can do as

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.409 
or seven times at least you can do as
much<00:04:58.960> as<00:04:58.990> you<00:04:59.139> want<00:04:59.440> get<00:05:00.250> a<00:05:00.280> long<00:05:00.639> strip<00:05:01.270> of

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:01.419 
much as you want get a long strip of

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:07.230 
much as you want get a long strip of
tape<00:05:01.660> and<00:05:02.310> then<00:05:03.310> rip<00:05:03.639> it<00:05:03.669> and<00:05:05.909> you'll<00:05:06.909> end<00:05:07.090> up

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.240 
tape and then rip it and you'll end up

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:11.219 
tape and then rip it and you'll end up
like<00:05:07.389> that<00:05:07.810> and<00:05:08.370> then<00:05:09.370> you<00:05:09.580> gotta<00:05:10.020> undo<00:05:11.020> it

00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:11.229 
like that and then you gotta undo it

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:17.129 
like that and then you gotta undo it
okay<00:05:12.210> and<00:05:13.210> then<00:05:14.460> you<00:05:15.460> will<00:05:15.940> untangle<00:05:16.599> it<00:05:16.930> and

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:17.139 
okay and then you will untangle it and

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:19.740 
okay and then you will untangle it and
try<00:05:17.320> to<00:05:17.349> get<00:05:17.530> it<00:05:17.560> straight<00:05:17.680> again<00:05:18.340> and<00:05:18.750> then

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:19.750 
try to get it straight again and then

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:33.860 
try to get it straight again and then
you'll<00:05:20.020> wrap<00:05:20.349> it<00:05:20.530> around<00:05:20.620> the<00:05:21.099> rest<00:05:21.490> of<00:05:21.759> it<00:05:22.830> and

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:33.870 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:38.130 

yeah<00:05:34.870> perfect<00:05:35.770> and<00:05:36.390> you<00:05:37.390> might<00:05:37.630> want<00:05:37.900> to<00:05:37.990> end

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:38.140 
yeah perfect and you might want to end

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:41.810 
yeah perfect and you might want to end
up<00:05:38.290> some<00:05:38.590> usually<00:05:39.310> with<00:05:40.000> thinner<00:05:40.470> than<00:05:41.470> this

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:41.820 
up some usually with thinner than this

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:44.670 
up some usually with thinner than this
but<00:05:42.820> you<00:05:43.180> just<00:05:43.480> try<00:05:43.720> to<00:05:43.780> get<00:05:44.080> it<00:05:44.200> to<00:05:44.350> where<00:05:44.530> it

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:44.680 
but you just try to get it to where it

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:47.310 
but you just try to get it to where it
will<00:05:44.770> support<00:05:45.190> it<00:05:45.340> and<00:05:45.490> then<00:05:46.180> you<00:05:46.330> slide<00:05:46.780> the

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:47.320 
will support it and then you slide the

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:50.370 
will support it and then you slide the
thing<00:05:48.280> down<00:05:48.760> there<00:05:49.150> or<00:05:49.810> whatever<00:05:50.140> you're

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:50.380 
thing down there or whatever you're

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:52.740 
thing down there or whatever you're
using<00:05:50.410> and<00:05:51.130> then<00:05:51.880> you<00:05:52.030> try<00:05:52.240> to<00:05:52.270> get<00:05:52.480> it<00:05:52.660> to

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:52.750 
using and then you try to get it to

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:54.930 
using and then you try to get it to
stand<00:05:53.110> in<00:05:53.320> there<00:05:53.500> like<00:05:53.650> i<00:05:53.830> said<00:05:54.100> but<00:05:54.580> let<00:05:54.910> it

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:54.940 
stand in there like i said but let it

00:05:54.940 --> 00:06:00.750 
stand in there like i said but let it
wobble<00:05:55.330> just<00:05:55.840> a<00:05:55.990> little<00:05:57.510> and<00:05:59.250> then<00:06:00.250> you<00:06:00.550> want

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:00.760 
wobble just a little and then you want

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:03.270 
wobble just a little and then you want
it<00:06:00.970> to<00:06:01.210> be<00:06:01.240> sticking<00:06:01.960> out<00:06:02.170> at<00:06:02.410> least<00:06:02.650> a<00:06:02.860> little

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:03.280 
it to be sticking out at least a little

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.490 
it to be sticking out at least a little
and<00:06:04.120> i'm<00:06:04.330> not<00:06:04.450> gonna<00:06:04.660> shoot<00:06:04.810> it<00:06:04.930> into<00:06:05.080> the<00:06:05.170> log

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:05.500 
and i'm not gonna shoot it into the log

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:09.030 
and i'm not gonna shoot it into the log
in<00:06:05.860> but<00:06:06.760> then<00:06:07.210> it<00:06:07.810> should<00:06:08.050> end<00:06:08.170> up<00:06:08.350> like<00:06:08.560> jet

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:09.040 
in but then it should end up like jet

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:13.890 
in but then it should end up like jet
and<00:06:09.730> it<00:06:10.660> will<00:06:10.780> fire<00:06:11.050> and<00:06:12.480> that's<00:06:13.480> how<00:06:13.630> you<00:06:13.690> do

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:13.900 
and it will fire and that's how you do

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:16.980 
and it will fire and that's how you do
it<00:06:14.070> so<00:06:15.070> your<00:06:15.520> outcome<00:06:15.940> should<00:06:16.210> look<00:06:16.450> like<00:06:16.480> this

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:16.990 
it so your outcome should look like this

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:23.010 
it so your outcome should look like this
or<00:06:19.080> you<00:06:20.080> can<00:06:20.320> use<00:06:20.940> preferably<00:06:21.940> use<00:06:22.270> a<00:06:22.300> thicker

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:23.020 
or you can use preferably use a thicker

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:27.840 
or you can use preferably use a thicker
rubber<00:06:23.500> band<00:06:23.860> such<00:06:24.700> as<00:06:24.880> this<00:06:25.150> and<00:06:26.430> then<00:06:27.430> see

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:27.850 
rubber band such as this and then see

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:31.920 
rubber band such as this and then see
use<00:06:28.480> a<00:06:28.510> longer<00:06:29.080> stem<00:06:29.740> for<00:06:30.220> the<00:06:30.430> thing<00:06:31.330> watch

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:31.930 
use a longer stem for the thing watch

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:37.110 
use a longer stem for the thing watch
how<00:06:32.170> much<00:06:32.230> faster<00:06:32.920> this<00:06:33.100> shoots<00:06:35.340> look<00:06:36.340> that

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:37.120 
how much faster this shoots look that

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:43.080 
how much faster this shoots look that
messed<00:06:37.390> up

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:43.090 

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:46.230 

see<00:06:43.840> it<00:06:44.230> will<00:06:44.470> end<00:06:44.620> up<00:06:44.770> like<00:06:44.980> that<00:06:45.220> and<00:06:45.490> it'll

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:46.240 
see it will end up like that and it'll

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:49.050 
see it will end up like that and it'll
be<00:06:46.510> a<00:06:46.540> bigger<00:06:46.870> rubber<00:06:47.169> band<00:06:47.500> and<00:06:47.910> then<00:06:48.910> you'll

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:49.060 
be a bigger rubber band and then you'll

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:52.050 
be a bigger rubber band and then you'll
end<00:06:49.210> up<00:06:49.300> shooting<00:06:50.280> like<00:06:51.280> that<00:06:51.490> whole<00:06:51.820> lot

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:52.060 
end up shooting like that whole lot

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:57.390 
end up shooting like that whole lot
faster<00:06:52.740> so<00:06:53.910> if<00:06:54.910> you<00:06:55.090> liked<00:06:55.270> it<00:06:55.300> subscribe<00:06:56.400> and

00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:57.400 
faster so if you liked it subscribe and

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:59.010 
faster so if you liked it subscribe and

00:06:59.010 --> 00:06:59.020 
maybe I'll come out with some more stuff

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:01.890 
maybe I'll come out with some more stuff
