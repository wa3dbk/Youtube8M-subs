cloud<00:05:31.009> will<00:05:31.610> there<00:05:31.759> be<00:05:31.789> bigger<00:05:32.270> meteors

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:32.810 
cloud will there be bigger meteors

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:35.620 
cloud will there be bigger meteors
asteroids<00:05:33.740> that<00:05:34.130> then<00:05:34.430> come<00:05:35.180> meteorites

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:35.630 
asteroids that then come meteorites
