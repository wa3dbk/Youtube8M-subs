00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
automatically and then if you want to

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.620 
automatically and then if you want to
like<00:02:23.650> this<00:02:23.890> is<00:02:24.040> it<00:02:24.160> recommended<00:02:24.340> but<00:02:24.940> I<00:02:25.270> found

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
like this is it recommended but I found

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.480 
like this is it recommended but I found
it<00:02:25.720> really<00:02:25.750> easy<00:02:26.020> to<00:02:26.140> do<00:02:26.320> like<00:02:26.950> run<00:02:27.190> them<00:02:27.370> over

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490 
it really easy to do like run them over

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:29.130 
it really easy to do like run them over
I<00:02:27.880> didn't<00:02:28.270> do<00:02:28.330> that<00:02:28.450> right<00:02:28.570> now<00:02:28.630> I<00:02:28.750> kept<00:02:29.050> on

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
I didn't do that right now I kept on

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.479 
I didn't do that right now I kept on
shooting<00:02:29.350> them<00:02:29.590> with<00:02:29.739> the<00:02:29.950> machine<00:02:30.310> gun

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
shooting them with the machine gun

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:32.130 
shooting them with the machine gun
because<00:02:30.700> you<00:02:30.880> get<00:02:31.000> an<00:02:31.150> automatic<00:02:31.390> machine<00:02:31.959> gun

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
because you get an automatic machine gun

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.160 
because you get an automatic machine gun
when<00:02:32.260> you<00:02:32.290> get<00:02:32.440> the<00:02:32.530> car<00:02:32.709> and<00:02:32.940> when<00:02:33.940> you<00:02:34.170> get

when you get the car and when you get

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.080 
when you get the car and when you get
when<00:02:35.530> you<00:02:35.650> kill<00:02:35.860> some<00:02:36.130> of<00:02:36.160> them<00:02:36.370> get<00:02:36.730> out<00:02:36.910> and
