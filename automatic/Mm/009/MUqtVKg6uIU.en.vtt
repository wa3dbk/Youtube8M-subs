right<00:01:57.060> on<00:01:57.210> there<00:01:57.600> it's<00:01:57.810> made<00:01:58.020> out<00:01:58.140> of<00:01:58.290> kind<00:01:58.530> of

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
right on there it's made out of kind of

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.840 
right on there it's made out of kind of
like<00:01:58.710> a<00:01:59.329> hard<00:02:00.329> rubber<00:02:00.750> and<00:02:01.680> it<00:02:01.920> works<00:02:02.310> fine<00:02:02.549> but

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
like a hard rubber and it works fine but

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.190 
like a hard rubber and it works fine but
I'm<00:02:02.969> not<00:02:03.060> gonna<00:02:03.180> talk<00:02:03.420> about<00:02:03.479> this<00:02:03.840> too<00:02:04.020> much

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
I'm not gonna talk about this too much

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.959 
I'm not gonna talk about this too much
what<00:02:04.469> I<00:02:04.500> really<00:02:04.860> want<00:02:05.040> to<00:02:05.100> talk<00:02:05.280> about<00:02:05.579> is<00:02:05.790> this

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
what I really want to talk about is this

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.510 
what I really want to talk about is this
mount<00:02:06.270> so<00:02:06.840> as<00:02:07.409> you<00:02:07.680> can<00:02:07.799> see<00:02:07.860> it's<00:02:08.190> got<00:02:08.369> this

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
mount so as you can see it's got this

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.339 
mount so as you can see it's got this
little<00:02:08.700> quarter-twenty<00:02:09.390> screw<00:02:09.959> here<00:02:10.170> it

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
little quarter-twenty screw here it

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.050 
little quarter-twenty screw here it
should<00:02:10.590> be<00:02:10.709> noted<00:02:11.069> that<00:02:11.099> this<00:02:11.400> quarter-twenty

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
should be noted that this quarter-twenty

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.460 
should be noted that this quarter-twenty
screw

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
screw

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.890 
screw
is<00:02:13.530> a<00:02:13.590> fairly<00:02:14.010> standard<00:02:14.340> screw<00:02:14.790> so<00:02:15.030> even<00:02:15.780> if

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
is a fairly standard screw so even if

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.720 
is a fairly standard screw so even if
you<00:02:16.080> don't<00:02:16.320> want<00:02:16.620> this<00:02:16.860> to<00:02:17.070> connect<00:02:17.370> your

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
you don't want this to connect your

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.120 
you don't want this to connect your
connect<00:02:18.270> to<00:02:18.480> the<00:02:18.570> top<00:02:18.780> of<00:02:18.900> your<00:02:18.930> TV<00:02:19.350> you<00:02:19.950> can

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
connect to the top of your TV you can

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.460 
connect to the top of your TV you can
actually<00:02:20.400> use<00:02:20.910> this<00:02:21.150> for<00:02:21.210> other<00:02:21.780> cameras<00:02:22.320> like

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
actually use this for other cameras like

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.150 
actually use this for other cameras like
web<00:02:22.680> cameras<00:02:23.250> or<00:02:23.790> even<00:02:24.060> a<00:02:24.150> DSLR<00:02:24.750> or<00:02:25.290> any<00:02:25.740> other

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
web cameras or even a DSLR or any other

web cameras or even a DSLR or any other
type<00:02:26.430> of<00:02:26.610> camera<00:02:26.880> that<00:02:27.000> has<00:02:27.180> this

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
type of camera that has this

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.600 
type of camera that has this
quarter-twenty<00:02:27.810> mounts<00:02:28.230> very<00:02:28.530> standard<00:02:29.010> so

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
quarter-twenty mounts very standard so

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.280 
quarter-twenty mounts very standard so
when<00:02:30.000> you<00:02:30.150> want<00:02:30.330> to<00:02:30.390> hook<00:02:30.510> this<00:02:30.690> thing<00:02:30.750> up<00:02:31.020> all

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
when you want to hook this thing up all

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.800 
when you want to hook this thing up all
you<00:02:31.440> do<00:02:32.030> put<00:02:33.030> it<00:02:33.120> on<00:02:33.210> the<00:02:33.330> bottom<00:02:33.510> of<00:02:33.750> your

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
you do put it on the bottom of your

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.020 
you do put it on the bottom of your
Kinect<00:02:34.320> and<00:02:34.530> screw<00:02:34.980> it<00:02:35.130> in<00:02:35.280> using<00:02:35.640> that<00:02:35.670> little

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
Kinect and screw it in using that little

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.700 
Kinect and screw it in using that little
thumb<00:02:36.270> screw<00:02:36.570> there<00:02:36.780> let<00:02:37.020> me<00:02:37.080> get<00:02:37.290> that<00:02:37.440> out<00:02:37.500> of

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710 
thumb screw there let me get that out of

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:39.560 
thumb screw there let me get that out of
the<00:02:37.770> way<00:02:37.920> I'm<00:02:38.400> sorry<00:02:38.640> that's<00:02:38.820> really<00:02:39.060> loud<00:02:39.390> it

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
the way I'm sorry that's really loud it

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:43.400 
the way I'm sorry that's really loud it
is<00:02:39.720> a<00:02:40.370> really<00:02:41.370> really<00:02:42.120> kind<00:02:42.810> of<00:02:42.960> difficult

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
is a really really kind of difficult

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:44.690 
is a really really kind of difficult
adjustment<00:02:43.980> but<00:02:44.130> once<00:02:44.280> you<00:02:44.400> have<00:02:44.520> it<00:02:44.610> adjusted

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
adjustment but once you have it adjusted

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.160 
adjustment but once you have it adjusted
you<00:02:45.060> really<00:02:45.270> shouldn't<00:02:45.480> have<00:02:45.540> to<00:02:45.750> move<00:02:45.930> it<00:02:46.050> too

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
you really shouldn't have to move it too

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.560 
you really shouldn't have to move it too
much<00:02:46.350> anymore<00:02:46.920> so<00:02:47.790> as<00:02:47.970> you<00:02:48.120> can<00:02:48.240> see<00:02:48.300> I've<00:02:48.540> just

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
much anymore so as you can see I've just

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:51.620 
much anymore so as you can see I've just
screwed<00:02:49.110> that<00:02:49.320> in<00:02:50.120> when<00:02:51.120> you<00:02:51.209> look<00:02:51.420> at<00:02:51.540> the

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
screwed that in when you look at the

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.330 
screwed that in when you look at the
front<00:02:51.870> you<00:02:52.020> might<00:02:52.170> have<00:02:52.320> to<00:02:52.470> make<00:02:53.010> sure<00:02:53.220> that

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
front you might have to make sure that

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.340 
front you might have to make sure that
that's<00:02:53.520> adjusted<00:02:54.060> properly<00:02:54.270> and<00:02:54.750> it<00:02:54.959> is<00:02:55.080> right

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
that's adjusted properly and it is right

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:56.960 
that's adjusted properly and it is right
now<00:02:55.560> and<00:02:55.830> that's<00:02:56.580> it

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
now and that's it

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.850 
now and that's it
you<00:02:57.060> know<00:02:57.150> once<00:02:57.390> you<00:02:57.510> have<00:02:57.690> that<00:02:57.930> set<00:02:58.350> up<00:02:58.560> you

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
you know once you have that set up you

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.980 
you know once you have that set up you
just<00:02:59.310> mount<00:02:59.430> it<00:02:59.550> to<00:02:59.610> the<00:02:59.730> top<00:02:59.970> of<00:03:00.150> the<00:03:00.209> TV<00:03:00.450> and

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:00.990 
just mount it to the top of the TV and

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:03.860 
just mount it to the top of the TV and
you're<00:03:01.590> good<00:03:01.740> to<00:03:01.770> go<00:03:02.030> so<00:03:03.030> here<00:03:03.300> I<00:03:03.330> just<00:03:03.420> wanted

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
you're good to go so here I just wanted

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.810 
you're good to go so here I just wanted
to<00:03:03.990> demonstrate<00:03:04.170> what<00:03:04.740> the<00:03:04.860> issue<00:03:05.070> was<00:03:05.550> that<00:03:05.580> I

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
to demonstrate what the issue was that I

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.270 
to demonstrate what the issue was that I
was<00:03:05.970> having<00:03:06.150> with<00:03:06.330> the<00:03:06.570> Kinect<00:03:06.990> and<00:03:07.220> how<00:03:08.220> the

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
was having with the Kinect and how the

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.520 
was having with the Kinect and how the
setup<00:03:08.880> went<00:03:09.270> and<00:03:09.450> how<00:03:09.600> well<00:03:09.870> the<00:03:10.050> product<00:03:10.410> a

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
setup went and how well the product a

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.320 
setup went and how well the product a
cloture<00:03:10.740> actually<00:03:11.400> worked<00:03:11.670> so<00:03:11.910> here<00:03:12.120> you<00:03:12.209> can

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
cloture actually worked so here you can

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:13.970 
cloture actually worked so here you can
see<00:03:12.510> what<00:03:12.780> the<00:03:12.930> problem<00:03:13.260> is<00:03:13.320> with<00:03:13.500> the<00:03:13.650> Kinect

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
see what the problem is with the Kinect

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.460 
see what the problem is with the Kinect
the<00:03:14.760> TV<00:03:15.090> was<00:03:15.240> just<00:03:15.420> too<00:03:15.630> thin<00:03:15.959> to<00:03:16.170> put<00:03:16.350> the

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
the TV was just too thin to put the

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.259 
the TV was just too thin to put the
Kinect<00:03:16.770> on<00:03:16.950> the<00:03:17.190> top<00:03:17.430> of<00:03:17.640> it<00:03:17.790> even<00:03:18.120> though<00:03:18.209> it

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
Kinect on the top of it even though it

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:20.390 
Kinect on the top of it even though it
was<00:03:18.360> a<00:03:18.390> nice<00:03:18.690> flat<00:03:19.050> surface<00:03:19.080> it<00:03:19.950> was<00:03:20.100> very

you<00:03:21.690> can<00:03:21.810> see<00:03:21.900> the<00:03:22.019> difference<00:03:22.290> here<00:03:22.440> I

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
you can see the difference here I

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.110 
you can see the difference here I
actually<00:03:22.950> show<00:03:23.130> off<00:03:23.280> the<00:03:23.459> PlayStation<00:03:24.090> 4

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
actually show off the PlayStation 4

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.750 
actually show off the PlayStation 4
camera<00:03:24.870> the<00:03:25.530> PlayStation<00:03:26.010> 4<00:03:26.040> camera<00:03:26.519> comes

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
camera the PlayStation 4 camera comes

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.240 
camera the PlayStation 4 camera comes
with<00:03:26.880> that<00:03:27.120> holder<00:03:27.630> already<00:03:28.080> and<00:03:28.860> it's<00:03:29.040> pretty

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
with that holder already and it's pretty

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.070 
with that holder already and it's pretty
secure<00:03:29.459> the<00:03:29.820> playstation<00:03:30.300> 4<00:03:30.510> camera<00:03:30.810> is<00:03:30.870> also

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
secure the playstation 4 camera is also

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.410 
secure the playstation 4 camera is also
a<00:03:31.110> lot<00:03:31.290> smaller<00:03:31.830> so<00:03:32.250> it's<00:03:32.670> not<00:03:32.880> as<00:03:33.090> big<00:03:33.300> a<00:03:33.330> deal

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
a lot smaller so it's not as big a deal

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.240 
a lot smaller so it's not as big a deal
it's<00:03:33.780> not<00:03:34.019> as<00:03:34.200> top-heavy<00:03:34.680> so<00:03:34.920> you<00:03:34.980> don't<00:03:35.130> have

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
it's not as top-heavy so you don't have

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.670 
it's not as top-heavy so you don't have
to<00:03:35.340> worry<00:03:35.550> about<00:03:35.820> it<00:03:35.940> as<00:03:36.060> much<00:03:36.320> so<00:03:37.320> here<00:03:37.590> I'm

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
to worry about it as much so here I'm

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.000 
to worry about it as much so here I'm
gonna<00:03:37.769> set<00:03:38.160> up<00:03:38.459> the<00:03:38.790> new<00:03:39.209> Kinect<00:03:39.810> mount<00:03:40.170> and

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
gonna set up the new Kinect mount and

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.280 
gonna set up the new Kinect mount and
ease<00:03:41.190> as<00:03:41.400> you<00:03:41.790> can<00:03:41.910> see<00:03:42.060> it's<00:03:42.180> much<00:03:42.540> easier<00:03:43.200> to

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
ease as you can see it's much easier to

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.530 
ease as you can see it's much easier to
set<00:03:43.739> this<00:03:43.920> thing<00:03:44.160> up<00:03:44.310> without<00:03:44.760> the<00:03:45.090> Kinect

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
set this thing up without the Kinect

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.720 
set this thing up without the Kinect
attached<00:03:45.959> so<00:03:46.590> that's<00:03:46.799> what<00:03:46.950> I<00:03:46.980> did<00:03:47.220> is<00:03:47.340> I<00:03:47.459> set

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
attached so that's what I did is I set

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.460 
attached so that's what I did is I set
it<00:03:47.850> up<00:03:47.970> I<00:03:48.120> got<00:03:48.239> it<00:03:48.390> all<00:03:48.510> adjusted<00:03:49.019> so<00:03:49.170> it<00:03:49.260> felt

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
it up I got it all adjusted so it felt

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.710 
it up I got it all adjusted so it felt
pretty<00:03:49.590> stable<00:03:49.980> and<00:03:50.340> then<00:03:50.850> later<00:03:51.180> I<00:03:51.330> actually

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
pretty stable and then later I actually

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.500 
pretty stable and then later I actually
added<00:03:52.290> the<00:03:52.410> Kinect<00:03:52.860> it<00:03:53.459> works<00:03:53.760> pretty<00:03:54.060> well<00:03:54.209> on

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
added the Kinect it works pretty well on

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.830 
added the Kinect it works pretty well on
this<00:03:54.630> TV<00:03:54.989> this<00:03:55.560> TV<00:03:56.010> has<00:03:56.310> a<00:03:56.340> very<00:03:56.640> flat<00:03:57.030> back<00:03:57.510> and

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
this TV this TV has a very flat back and

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.220 
this TV this TV has a very flat back and
a<00:03:58.200> flat<00:03:58.530> top<00:03:59.400> so<00:03:59.790> this<00:03:59.940> Kinect<00:04:00.390> mount<00:04:00.660> it<00:04:01.110> was

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
a flat top so this Kinect mount it was

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:04.340 
a flat top so this Kinect mount it was
very<00:04:01.440> easy<00:04:01.769> to<00:04:02.010> get<00:04:02.130> this<00:04:02.340> to<00:04:02.519> mount<00:04:02.730> I<00:04:03.230> dug<00:04:04.230> it

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
very easy to get this to mount I dug it

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:05.690 
very easy to get this to mount I dug it
on<00:04:04.470> the<00:04:04.560> core<00:04:04.830> do<00:04:04.920> you<00:04:04.980> see<00:04:05.160> me<00:04:05.280> tug<00:04:05.489> on<00:04:05.580> the

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
on the core do you see me tug on the

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.539 
on the core do you see me tug on the
cord<00:04:05.940> a<00:04:06.030> few<00:04:06.239> times<00:04:06.540> and<00:04:07.290> does<00:04:07.980> not<00:04:08.130> feel<00:04:08.400> like

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:08.549 
cord a few times and does not feel like

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:10.430 
cord a few times and does not feel like
it's<00:04:08.700> gonna<00:04:08.820> come<00:04:09.060> off<00:04:09.239> the<00:04:09.390> back<00:04:09.600> if<00:04:10.140> it's

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
it's gonna come off the back if it's

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.229 
it's gonna come off the back if it's
gonna<00:04:10.650> fall<00:04:11.010> it's<00:04:11.340> gonna<00:04:11.459> fall<00:04:11.730> off<00:04:11.760> the<00:04:11.910> front

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
gonna fall it's gonna fall off the front

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:13.880 
gonna fall it's gonna fall off the front
but<00:04:12.510> hopefully<00:04:12.840> that<00:04:12.989> cord<00:04:13.320> will<00:04:13.530> kind<00:04:13.739> of

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:13.890 
but hopefully that cord will kind of

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:16.610 
but hopefully that cord will kind of
keep<00:04:14.459> it<00:04:14.610> from<00:04:14.760> going<00:04:14.940> up<00:04:15.209> the<00:04:15.390> front<00:04:15.630> and<00:04:16.080> it

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
keep it from going up the front and it

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.080 
keep it from going up the front and it
will<00:04:16.680> kind<00:04:16.919> of<00:04:16.979> hook<00:04:17.220> using<00:04:17.519> that<00:04:17.790> little

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
will kind of hook using that little

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:22.640 
will kind of hook using that little

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:08.220 
it would have been without the mount and

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:11.990 
it would have been without the mount and
