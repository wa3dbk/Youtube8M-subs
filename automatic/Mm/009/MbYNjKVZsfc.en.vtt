00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:09.240
 hello everyone today came to me 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:14.360
 such a parcel can make 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:22.490
 the long-awaited package here is in Kiev with 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:33.840
 Ukraine from Fedor walked on a stone for 27 days 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:36.050
 here is like abrasive to me six 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.050
 pieces 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:46.620
 well let's open and see how 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:49.500
 Immediately wants to say to Fedor 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:53.840
 thanks for being pretty quick 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.840
 promptly sent these stones 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.430
 all is well packed 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.120
 stone mushroom 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:48.350
 but they own the stones will 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:02:08.620
 neatly open so that nothing 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:02:08.620
 hurt me this masterpiece all open 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:38.660
 but such stones here means they are to me 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:41.920
 the error is 400 600000 from 3000 5 10 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.920
 six stones 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:51.560
 never held their hands 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:58.390
 I do not know how they work very interesting 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:58.390
 will try here well in appearance as if 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:05.260
 that's what they look like 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:14.690
 I'll put it right next to it 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:25.870
 the thicker veins are slightly different 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:45.760
 and so the first impression is not bad 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:52.379
 only here here there are such 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:52.379
 risks hint at stone 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.920
 a little bit noticeable 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:07.780
 corners well how to equate them anyway 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:11.459
 will have to lie and so basically a favor 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:16.320
 about the same about millimeters 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:19.600
 6 thick 6 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:26.949
 definitely not for measure so by the eye saying 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:34.930
 size here if you look like that 

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:37.020
 as if all about the same 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.020
 thickness 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:45.440
 or exactly of course put well so 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:49.200
 thickness 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:51.780
 by eye they are the same as the best house 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.340
 did not ask in several kinds 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:56.280
 comments for what here these forms 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:05:00.900
 we need these forms for this purpose 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:04.310
 to stick the stones for sharpening here 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.310
 these specifically for apex 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:14.100
 exactly that stone falls on the blank form 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:18.960
 and 

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:22.590
 addition renderman these here link to 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:24.830
 the seller I took these cards here, too, will give 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:24.830
 under the video 

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:35.640
 but if that's so that you spend your finger 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:38.070
 these corners are felt very 

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:43.250
 cool as if they are a little straight 

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:48.930
 sticks out but it's okay through the handle 

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:53.280
 here such there came to me now 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:57.060
 stick them on the form and further 

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:59.840
 I will try to thank you all for watching 

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:59.840
 bye everyone
