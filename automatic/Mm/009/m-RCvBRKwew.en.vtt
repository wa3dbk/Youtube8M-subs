00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.720 
hi I'm dr. Joe Falvo and I want to spend

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.260 
hi I'm dr. Joe Falvo and I want to spend
just<00:00:03.840> a<00:00:04.080> few<00:00:04.110> moments<00:00:04.680> with<00:00:04.799> you<00:00:04.950> today

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:05.270 
just a few moments with you today

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:08.980 
just a few moments with you today
talking<00:00:06.270> about<00:00:06.649> amblyopia<00:00:07.649> or<00:00:08.250> lazy<00:00:08.370> eye

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:08.990 
talking about amblyopia or lazy eye

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:13.129 
talking about amblyopia or lazy eye
there<00:00:09.990> are<00:00:10.139> two<00:00:10.469> main<00:00:11.280> reasons<00:00:11.809> that<00:00:12.809> a

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
there are two main reasons that a

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.950 
there are two main reasons that a
student<00:00:13.590> gets<00:00:13.650> amblyopia<00:00:14.130> the<00:00:15.089> first<00:00:15.450> one<00:00:15.719> is

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
student gets amblyopia the first one is

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.680 
student gets amblyopia the first one is
a<00:00:16.260> little<00:00:16.619> easier<00:00:16.920> to<00:00:17.070> understand<00:00:17.520> we<00:00:18.180> call<00:00:18.420> it

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
a little easier to understand we call it

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.920 
a little easier to understand we call it
Straub<00:00:19.140> is<00:00:19.380> m'q<00:00:19.650> amblyopia<00:00:20.510> quite<00:00:21.510> simply

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
Straub is m'q amblyopia quite simply

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.620 
Straub is m'q amblyopia quite simply
that<00:00:22.439> just<00:00:22.710> means<00:00:22.949> that<00:00:23.220> if<00:00:23.699> my<00:00:24.000> hands

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
that just means that if my hands

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.279 
that just means that if my hands
represent<00:00:25.560> the<00:00:25.650> students<00:00:26.070> eyes<00:00:26.779> one<00:00:27.779> of<00:00:28.019> the

represent the students eyes one of the
eyes<00:00:28.429> turns<00:00:29.429> in<00:00:29.730> as<00:00:30.689> a<00:00:30.750> cross<00:00:31.080> dye<00:00:31.349> or<00:00:32.189> turns

eyes turns in as a cross dye or turns

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.930 
eyes turns in as a cross dye or turns
out<00:00:33.180> as<00:00:33.480> a<00:00:34.050> wandering<00:00:34.620> eye<00:00:34.829> now<00:00:35.700> if<00:00:35.820> this

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
out as a wandering eye now if this

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.510 
out as a wandering eye now if this
occurs<00:00:36.390> where<00:00:37.170> an<00:00:37.260> eye<00:00:37.350> turns<00:00:37.680> in<00:00:37.920> or<00:00:38.219> turns

occurs where an eye turns in or turns

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.600 
occurs where an eye turns in or turns
out<00:00:38.930> what<00:00:39.930> happens<00:00:40.410> for<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.680> student<00:00:41.070> is<00:00:41.219> as

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
out what happens for the student is as

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.319 
out what happens for the student is as
they<00:00:42.120> look<00:00:42.360> at<00:00:42.510> you<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:43.590> left<00:00:43.890> eye<00:00:44.270> is<00:00:45.270> on

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
they look at you the left eye is on

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.869 
they look at you the left eye is on
target<00:00:45.930> and<00:00:46.230> seizure<00:00:46.440> face<00:00:46.739> and<00:00:47.039> takes<00:00:47.700> that

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
target and seizure face and takes that

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.029 
target and seizure face and takes that
image<00:00:48.210> back<00:00:48.390> to<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.690> brain<00:00:48.930> but<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.829> right

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
image back to the brain but the right

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.029 
image back to the brain but the right
eye<00:00:50.070> has<00:00:50.489> turned<00:00:51.120> in<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:51.719> is<00:00:52.260> not<00:00:52.410> pointed<00:00:52.949> at

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
eye has turned in and is not pointed at

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.459 
eye has turned in and is not pointed at
your<00:00:53.160> face<00:00:53.219> so<00:00:54.149> it<00:00:54.239> takes<00:00:54.449> an<00:00:54.600> image<00:00:54.719> from

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
your face so it takes an image from

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.350 
your face so it takes an image from
something<00:00:56.160> over<00:00:56.370> there<00:00:56.579> back<00:00:56.850> to<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.120> brain

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
something over there back to the brain

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.869 
something over there back to the brain
now<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.079> brain<00:00:58.350> knows<00:00:58.620> right<00:00:58.859> away<00:00:58.890> that<00:00:59.730> of

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
now the brain knows right away that of

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.389 
now the brain knows right away that of
these<00:01:00.059> two<00:01:00.270> images<00:01:00.690> it<00:01:01.109> can't<00:01:01.530> take<00:01:01.770> too

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
these two images it can't take too

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.539 
these two images it can't take too
unlike<00:01:02.940> images<00:01:03.390> and<00:01:03.510> put<00:01:03.629> them<00:01:03.750> together<00:01:04.549> so

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
unlike images and put them together so

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.100 
unlike images and put them together so
the<00:01:05.670> brain<00:01:05.909> will<00:01:06.119> take<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.479> image<00:01:06.869> of<00:01:07.020> your

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
the brain will take the image of your

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.179 
the brain will take the image of your
face<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:07.799> use<00:01:08.549> it<00:01:08.820> but<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:09.900> image<00:01:10.350> from<00:01:11.070> the

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
face and use it but the image from the

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.719 
face and use it but the image from the
right<00:01:11.430> eye<00:01:11.780> from<00:01:12.780> over<00:01:13.140> there<00:01:13.439> that<00:01:14.310> doesn't

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
right eye from over there that doesn't

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.649 
right eye from over there that doesn't
match<00:01:14.909> and<00:01:15.509> it'll<00:01:15.990> turn<00:01:16.229> that<00:01:16.560> image<00:01:16.890> off<00:01:17.659> now

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
match and it'll turn that image off now

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.460 
match and it'll turn that image off now

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
the amblyopia is pretty embedded so we

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.020 
the amblyopia is pretty embedded so we
have<00:01:39.509> an<00:01:39.600> eye<00:01:39.780> that<00:01:39.990> crosses<00:01:40.530> an<00:01:40.790> image<00:01:41.790> that

the<00:01:42.390> brain<00:01:42.659> doesn't<00:01:42.930> want<00:01:43.229> so<00:01:44.009> it<00:01:44.100> turns<00:01:44.310> off

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610

at<00:01:56.610> all<00:01:56.930> similar<00:01:57.930> to<00:01:58.110> a<00:01:58.290> young<00:01:58.560> student<00:01:58.890> that

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
at all similar to a young student that

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.789 
at all similar to a young student that
breaks<00:01:59.579> his<00:01:59.790> arm<00:02:00.000> and<00:02:00.210> has<00:02:00.869> it<00:02:01.049> in<00:02:01.140> a<00:02:01.200> cast<00:02:01.500> and

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
breaks his arm and has it in a cast and

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.620 
breaks his arm and has it in a cast and
then<00:02:02.369> six<00:02:02.640> weeks<00:02:02.700> later<00:02:03.000> has<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.390> cast

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
then six weeks later has the cast

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.230 
then six weeks later has the cast
removed<00:02:04.049> when<00:02:04.979> the<00:02:05.009> cast<00:02:05.430> is<00:02:05.610> removed<00:02:05.969> what<00:02:06.180> do

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
removed when the cast is removed what do

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.410 
removed when the cast is removed what do
we<00:02:06.360> see<00:02:06.710> the<00:02:07.710> muscles<00:02:08.129> are<00:02:08.250> atrophied<00:02:08.910> they're

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
we see the muscles are atrophied they're

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.119 
we see the muscles are atrophied they're
much<00:02:09.599> weaker<00:02:09.869> they're<00:02:10.379> thinner

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
much weaker they're thinner

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.729

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599 
eye internally is much weaker so what do

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:27.289 
eye internally is much weaker so what do
we<00:02:24.659> need<00:02:24.840> to<00:02:25.019> do<00:02:25.170> we<00:02:25.980> need<00:02:26.010> to<00:02:26.219> help<00:02:26.370> align<00:02:26.969> that

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:27.299 
we need to do we need to help align that

we need to do we need to help align that
I<00:02:27.359> properly<00:02:27.840> and<00:02:28.500> then<00:02:29.400> we<00:02:29.549> have<00:02:29.730> have<00:02:30.180> to

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:30.389 
I properly and then we have have to

00:02:30.389 --> 00:02:33.770 
I properly and then we have have to
stimulate<00:02:31.109> the<00:02:31.889> inside<00:02:32.549> of<00:02:32.730> that<00:02:32.760> eye<00:02:33.090> to

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
stimulate the inside of that eye to

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.020 
stimulate the inside of that eye to
develop<00:02:34.200> now<00:02:34.349> and<00:02:34.530> catch<00:02:34.709> up<00:02:34.889> to<00:02:35.040> the<00:02:35.129> left<00:02:35.340> how

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
develop now and catch up to the left how

do<00:02:36.090> we<00:02:36.269> do<00:02:36.420> that<00:02:36.680> there<00:02:37.680> are<00:02:37.709> a<00:02:37.799> number<00:02:37.859> of

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
do we do that there are a number of

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:40.940 
do we do that there are a number of
techniques<00:02:38.540> we<00:02:39.540> use<00:02:39.870> over<00:02:40.200> 50<00:02:40.919> different

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:38.449 
results now I told you there were two

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:42.319 
results now I told you there were two
types<00:03:39.449> of<00:03:39.659> amblyopia<00:03:40.189> number<00:03:41.189> two<00:03:41.459> the<00:03:41.790> second

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:47.809 
type of amblyopia is refractive
amblyopia<00:03:45.319> quite<00:03:46.319> simply<00:03:46.739> that<00:03:47.310> just<00:03:47.609> means

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:47.819 
amblyopia quite simply that just means

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:50.960 
amblyopia quite simply that just means
of<00:03:48.000> the<00:03:48.120> two<00:03:48.299> eyes<00:03:48.590> one<00:03:49.590> eye<00:03:49.650> has<00:03:50.609> a<00:03:50.639> much

this<00:04:15.599> type<00:04:15.810> of<00:04:15.840> amblyopia<00:04:16.340> refractive

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
this type of amblyopia refractive

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.939 
this type of amblyopia refractive
amblyopia<00:04:17.609> well<00:04:18.539> we<00:04:19.169> need<00:04:19.320> to<00:04:19.409> correct<00:04:19.739> the

00:04:19.939 --> 00:04:19.949 
amblyopia well we need to correct the

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:22.820 
amblyopia well we need to correct the
vision<00:04:20.250> first<00:04:20.519> so<00:04:21.209> I<00:04:21.479> glasses<00:04:22.139> or<00:04:22.349> contact

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
vision first so I glasses or contact

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:24.100 
vision first so I glasses or contact
lenses<00:04:22.919> out<00:04:23.310> front

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
lenses out front

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.379 
lenses out front
to<00:04:24.349> make<00:04:24.500> the<00:04:24.650> image<00:04:24.830> good<00:04:25.099> but<00:04:25.759> remember<00:04:26.180> that

00:04:26.379 --> 00:04:26.389 
to make the image good but remember that

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:28.450 
to make the image good but remember that
raita<00:04:26.990> has<00:04:27.259> been<00:04:27.439> blurry<00:04:27.800> for<00:04:28.099> a<00:04:28.159> number<00:04:28.370> of

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460 
raita has been blurry for a number of

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.510 
raita has been blurry for a number of
years<00:04:28.669> and<00:04:28.879> not<00:04:29.449> used<00:04:29.780> so<00:04:30.139> the<00:04:30.949> brain<00:04:31.250> has

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520 
years and not used so the brain has

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:32.679 
years and not used so the brain has
turned<00:04:32.120> it<00:04:32.270> off

00:04:32.679 --> 00:04:32.689 
turned it off

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:36.219 
turned it off
it<00:04:33.139> has<00:04:33.379> atrophied<00:04:34.250> inside<00:04:34.729> so<00:04:35.659> after<00:04:36.080> getting

00:04:36.219 --> 00:04:36.229 
it has atrophied inside so after getting

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:37.779 
it has atrophied inside so after getting
a<00:04:36.469> good<00:04:36.620> correction<00:04:37.099> with<00:04:37.219> glasses<00:04:37.520> or

00:04:37.779 --> 00:04:37.789 
a good correction with glasses or

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:41.110 
a good correction with glasses or
contact<00:04:38.300> lenses<00:04:38.389> we<00:04:39.259> need<00:04:39.409> again<00:04:39.949> to<00:04:40.759> use<00:04:40.879> one

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
contact lenses we need again to use one

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.610 
contact lenses we need again to use one
of<00:04:41.150> the<00:04:41.300> strategies<00:04:41.870> that<00:04:41.900> I<00:04:42.110> just<00:04:42.409> spoke

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.620 
of the strategies that I just spoke

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.830 
of the strategies that I just spoke
about<00:04:42.650> to<00:04:43.550> stimulate<00:04:44.030> it<00:04:44.150> through<00:04:44.389> vision

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:44.840 
about to stimulate it through vision

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:49.000 
about to stimulate it through vision
therapy<00:04:45.050> I<00:04:45.439> hope<00:04:46.430> this<00:04:46.580> helped<00:04:46.849> you
