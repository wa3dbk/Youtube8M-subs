00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.610
 well it's him at all and like cruzy 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.230
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:20.790
 new video a pretty special video 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.500
 because I take book face to face two 

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:23.970
 week vs the week so 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.010
 I started a series for us 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.610
 that he is for those who do not know 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.470
 no sorry where I had or game where each 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:34.500
 week I was doing face to face of 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:37.710
 game so as I did before call 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.559
 of duty vs battlefield or what it 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.050
 up this gta and so today is it 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:46.079
 will see the new face to face of the 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.870
 week so assassin's creed assassin's 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.659
 creed sensors including black flag leaves 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:53.489
 batman arkam origin 

00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:56.640
 so it's on the side of the graphics 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:59.460
 advantage to assassin's creed cats who 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.019
 with August 6 it is under this pardon it is 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.429
 also in which extends by far these 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:04.800
 storms these forests six cities and 

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:07.680
 villages full of life assassin's creed 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:09.840
 4 Black Club Black Flag Heals His 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.730
 environmental storytelling to dive 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.080
 the player in a world of piracy 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:15.450
 and on next gen 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.570
 the effect is even more pronounced in 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:21.030
 comparison batman arkam origins seems 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.550
 just more beautiful quarter city cam with 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.010
 its nocturnal urban environments and 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:28.080
 under the snow 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:31.770
 on the playability side advantage to batman 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:34.050
 arkam origins murdered four have 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.360
 multiplied the possibilities of interaction 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.850
 and it is always difficult for him to 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:42.240
 measure with the fluid combat system 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.740
 perfect and accurate batman in addition to 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.160
 small recurring problems of the series 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.840
 ubisoft should still be the only one to 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.360
 serve on this episode apple 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.580
 finally note the will of warner 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.030
 improve the investigation phases of 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.840
 Batman 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:00.090
 she deserved it greatly we go from 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.360
 lifetime side benefit to assassin's 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.670
 creed iv 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.410
 Duelists have a lot of the 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.989
 propose an open world that of 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:12.209
 assassin's creed seems premium first 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.350
 bigger deeper more varied in 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:16.710
 its operations at 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:19.230
 it's gone on land or at sea nevertheless 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:21.600
 this batman incorporating the batwing for himself 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.450
 move quickly we can imagine that 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:27.960
 gotham will be sufficiently large and dense 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:31.020
 to hold 20 to 30 hours of play on the side 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:33.240
 originality equality so as it is 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.280
 here of franchise episodes well 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:39.620
 installed hard to find an ounce 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:41.610
 authority of the multi or 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.860
 further investigations on batman 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.840
 a more nautical orientation will be 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.480
 are registered yes but these two titles 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.820
 continue in already tried ways 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.620
 without questioning their foundation 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:55.470
 at best we will find the near ubisoft 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.030
 a little riskier here is their 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:01.350
 today's winners and assassin's 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:06.090
 creed 4 black flag who is ahead when 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:08.160
 even largely batman of my opinion and 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.420
 so here I hope that this week of 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:13.550
 the week will have you more secular and 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.550
