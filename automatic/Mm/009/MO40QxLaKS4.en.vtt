00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
described saw the importance of recovery

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.519 
described saw the importance of recovery
time<00:00:14.849> and<00:00:15.000> why<00:00:15.089> you<00:00:15.150> need<00:00:15.389> to<00:00:15.540> do<00:00:15.690> it<00:00:15.839> and<00:00:16.020> I<00:00:16.080> was

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
to look at your muscle cell after

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.820 
to look at your muscle cell after
exercise<00:00:21.359> whatever<00:00:21.779> it<00:00:22.020> might<00:00:22.140> be<00:00:22.199> cycling

exercise whatever it might be cycling

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.390 
exercise whatever it might be cycling
running<00:00:22.949> weights<00:00:23.480> whatever<00:00:24.480> go<00:00:24.720> into<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:24.990> gym

running weights whatever go into the gym

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.790 
running weights whatever go into the gym
it<00:00:26.400> looks<00:00:26.789> like<00:00:26.970> a<00:00:27.000> bomb<00:00:27.240> site<00:00:27.539> there<00:00:28.320> you<00:00:28.680> know

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
it looks like a bomb site there you know

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.950 
it looks like a bomb site there you know
dragon<00:00:29.730> age<00:00:29.789> is<00:00:29.939> everywhere<00:00:30.330> it's<00:00:30.510> torn<00:00:30.779> to

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
dragon age is everywhere it's torn to

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.720 
dragon age is everywhere it's torn to
pieces<00:00:30.990> it<00:00:31.590> just<00:00:31.740> looks<00:00:32.009> an<00:00:32.099> absolute<00:00:32.520> mess

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
pieces it just looks an absolute mess

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.920 
pieces it just looks an absolute mess
and<00:00:33.230> that<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.980> recovery<00:00:35.399> time<00:00:35.690> allows<00:00:36.690> that

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
and that the recovery time allows that

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.170 
and that the recovery time allows that
muscle<00:00:37.320> cell<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:37.890> repair<00:00:38.250> itself<00:00:38.610> and<00:00:38.940> when<00:00:39.090> it

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
muscle cell to repair itself and when it

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.450 
muscle cell to repair itself and when it
repairs<00:00:39.480> itself<00:00:39.480> it<00:00:40.170> overcompensates<00:00:40.739> and

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
repairs itself it overcompensates and

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.250 
repairs itself it overcompensates and
makes<00:00:41.700> itself<00:00:42.059> stronger<00:00:42.570> so<00:00:42.780> that's<00:00:42.989> where

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
makes itself stronger so that's where

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.440 
makes itself stronger so that's where
the<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:44.129> increase<00:00:44.489> of<00:00:44.520> fitness<00:00:44.910> comes<00:00:45.180> from

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
the the increase of fitness comes from

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.709 
the the increase of fitness comes from
now<00:00:46.289> how<00:00:47.219> much<00:00:47.430> recovery<00:00:47.879> time<00:00:48.120> is<00:00:48.300> too<00:00:48.510> much

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
now how much recovery time is too much

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.690 
now how much recovery time is too much
and<00:00:48.960> how<00:00:49.079> much<00:00:49.230> is<00:00:49.410> not<00:00:49.559> enough<00:00:49.620> that<00:00:50.190> sort<00:00:50.610> of

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
and how much is not enough that sort of

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.319 
and how much is not enough that sort of
that's<00:00:51.300> another<00:00:51.480> big<00:00:51.809> question<00:00:52.079> is<00:00:52.500> of<00:00:53.329> of

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
that's another big question is of of

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.560 
that's another big question is of of
clients<00:00:54.840> that<00:00:54.899> I<00:00:55.020> that<00:00:55.559> I<00:00:55.590> work<00:00:55.890> with<00:00:55.920> and<00:00:56.570> you

clients that I that I work with and you
know<00:00:57.690> just<00:00:57.870> just<00:00:58.260> general<00:00:58.590> questions<00:00:58.620> that<00:00:59.100> I

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
know just just general questions that I

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.070 
know just just general questions that I
get<00:00:59.219> asked<00:00:59.550> as<00:00:59.670> well<00:00:59.899> so<00:01:02.600> as<00:01:03.600> soon<00:01:03.840> as<00:01:03.930> you

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
get asked as well so as soon as you

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.200 
get asked as well so as soon as you
finish<00:01:04.229> exercising<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:05.610> sort<00:01:05.880> of<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.000> growth

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
finish exercising the sort of the growth

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.100 
finish exercising the sort of the growth
and<00:01:06.360> repair<00:01:06.689> process<00:01:07.260> begins<00:01:07.920> there's<00:01:08.549> no<00:01:09.110> it

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
and repair process begins there's no it

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.450 
and repair process begins there's no it
doesn't<00:01:10.350> wait<00:01:10.500> an<00:01:10.650> hour<00:01:10.740> is<00:01:11.010> succeed<00:01:11.369> you

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
doesn't wait an hour is succeed you

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.120 
doesn't wait an hour is succeed you
finish<00:01:11.760> it<00:01:11.970> starts<00:01:12.299> to<00:01:12.390> repair<00:01:12.689> itself<00:01:13.130> after

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
finish it starts to repair itself after

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.899 
finish it starts to repair itself after
I<00:01:15.060> things<00:01:15.630> up<00:01:15.750> to<00:01:15.840> four<00:01:16.110> hours<00:01:16.530> that<00:01:17.520> growth

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
I things up to four hours that growth

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.090 
I things up to four hours that growth
and<00:01:18.090> repair<00:01:18.360> process<00:01:18.869> increases<00:01:19.259> by<00:01:19.680> fifty

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
and repair process increases by fifty

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.830 
and repair process increases by fifty
percent<00:01:20.250> so<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.090> amount<00:01:21.299> of<00:01:21.330> work<00:01:21.570> that's

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
percent so the amount of work that's

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.020 
percent so the amount of work that's
going<00:01:22.080> into<00:01:22.439> it<00:01:22.560> is<00:01:22.710> increased<00:01:23.460> by<00:01:23.580> fifty

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
going into it is increased by fifty

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.179 
going into it is increased by fifty
percent<00:01:24.150> to<00:01:24.479> repair<00:01:24.750> that<00:01:24.869> muscle<00:01:25.200> cell<00:01:25.409> then

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
percent to repair that muscle cell then

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.469 
percent to repair that muscle cell then
24<00:01:26.759> hours<00:01:26.820> after<00:01:28.369> exercise<00:01:29.369> its<00:01:29.850> increased<00:01:30.329> by

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
24 hours after exercise its increased by

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.690 
24 hours after exercise its increased by
one<00:01:30.600> hundred<00:01:30.720> nine<00:01:31.259> percent<00:01:31.799> so<00:01:32.340> it's<00:01:32.549> now

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
one hundred nine percent so it's now

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.609 
one hundred nine percent so it's now
working<00:01:33.090> even<00:01:33.450> harder<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:33.990> start<00:01:34.259> repairing

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
working even harder to start repairing

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.719 
working even harder to start repairing
itself<00:01:34.860> and<00:01:35.310> by<00:01:36.409> 36<00:01:37.409> hours<00:01:37.740> after<00:01:38.130> its<00:01:38.369> return

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
itself and by 36 hours after its return

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.090 
itself and by 36 hours after its return
back<00:01:39.000> to<00:01:39.030> normal<00:01:39.210> so<00:01:40.079> that's<00:01:40.320> when<00:01:40.560> they<00:01:40.770> say

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
back to normal so that's when they say

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.300 
back to normal so that's when they say
it's<00:01:41.840> that<00:01:42.840> sort<00:01:43.140> of<00:01:43.259> long<00:01:43.409> enough<00:01:43.710> to<00:01:43.950> repair

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
it's that sort of long enough to repair

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.090 
it's that sort of long enough to repair
so<00:01:44.850> whatever<00:01:45.509> exercise<00:01:45.960> you're<00:01:46.290> doing<00:01:46.680> you

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
so whatever exercise you're doing you

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.950 
so whatever exercise you're doing you
want<00:01:47.310> to<00:01:47.369> give<00:01:47.520> yourself<00:01:47.640> 36<00:01:48.540> hours<00:01:48.840> in

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
want to give yourself 36 hours in

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.410 
want to give yourself 36 hours in
between<00:01:49.110> now<00:01:50.009> with<00:01:50.729> regards<00:01:51.119> to<00:01:51.149> weight

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
between now with regards to weight

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.420 
between now with regards to weight
training<00:01:51.810> and<00:01:52.140> sort<00:01:52.470> of<00:01:52.530> exercising<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.159> gym

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
training and sort of exercising the gym

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.149 
training and sort of exercising the gym
you<00:01:53.640> can<00:01:54.000> you<00:01:54.329> can<00:01:54.479> get<00:01:54.630> away<00:01:54.750> with<00:01:55.200> doing<00:01:55.470> less

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
you can you can get away with doing less

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.770 
you can you can get away with doing less
because<00:01:56.490> what<00:01:56.700> you<00:01:56.820> can<00:01:56.969> do<00:01:57.149> is<00:01:57.299> you<00:01:57.360> can<00:01:57.420> split

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
because what you can do is you can split

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.899 
because what you can do is you can split
your<00:01:57.899> your<00:01:58.680> weight<00:01:58.890> training<00:01:59.280> program<00:01:59.670> so<00:01:59.820> you

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
your your weight training program so you

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.749 
your your weight training program so you
could<00:02:00.060> split<00:02:00.360> it<00:02:00.390> to<00:02:00.750> a<00:02:01.280> pushing<00:02:02.280> session<00:02:02.640> and

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
could split it to a pushing session and

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.310 
could split it to a pushing session and
a<00:02:02.820> pulling<00:02:03.119> session<00:02:03.540> so<00:02:03.659> you're<00:02:03.780> not<00:02:03.840> working

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
a pulling session so you're not working

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.130 
a pulling session so you're not working
the<00:02:04.439> same<00:02:04.649> muscles<00:02:05.100> in<00:02:06.030> consecutive<00:02:06.509> work<00:02:06.899> out

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
the same muscles in consecutive work out

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.419 
the same muscles in consecutive work out
so<00:02:07.320> there<00:02:07.469> there<00:02:07.649> are<00:02:07.680> different<00:02:08.160> ways<00:02:08.250> around

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
so there there are different ways around

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.830 
so there there are different ways around
it<00:02:09.319> if<00:02:10.319> you<00:02:10.500> were<00:02:10.649> to<00:02:10.950> say<00:02:11.459> go<00:02:11.970> out<00:02:12.120> on<00:02:12.300> a<00:02:12.330> hard

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
it if you were to say go out on a hard

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.869 
it if you were to say go out on a hard
run<00:02:12.989> or<00:02:13.260> a<00:02:13.290> heart<00:02:13.530> cycle<00:02:14.040> that<00:02:14.550> you<00:02:14.670> want<00:02:14.819> to

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:14.879 
run or a heart cycle that you want to

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:18.430 
run or a heart cycle that you want to
give<00:02:15.060> yourself<00:02:15.150> a<00:02:15.720> good<00:02:16.290> 36<00:02:16.950> hours<00:02:17.280> in<00:02:17.370> between

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
give yourself a good 36 hours in between

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.300 
give yourself a good 36 hours in between
now<00:02:19.440> that's<00:02:19.680> not<00:02:19.890> going<00:02:19.980> to<00:02:20.069> be<00:02:20.099> possible

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
now that's not going to be possible

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.170 
now that's not going to be possible
every<00:02:21.150> single<00:02:21.330> time<00:02:22.250> but<00:02:23.250> you<00:02:23.370> need<00:02:23.610> to<00:02:23.910> you

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
every single time but you need to you

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.199 
every single time but you need to you
need<00:02:24.209> to<00:02:24.540> know<00:02:24.750> that's<00:02:25.260> the<00:02:25.980> time<00:02:26.250> that<00:02:26.670> that's

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
need to know that's the time that that's

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:28.910 
need to know that's the time that that's
sort<00:02:27.510> of<00:02:27.569> time<00:02:27.810> frames<00:02:28.170> what<00:02:28.349> the<00:02:28.440> body<00:02:28.650> gives

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
sort of time frames what the body gives

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.460 
sort of time frames what the body gives
itself<00:02:29.540> and<00:02:30.540> obviously<00:02:30.840> in<00:02:30.989> the<00:02:31.049> real<00:02:31.230> world

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
itself and obviously in the real world

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.890 
itself and obviously in the real world
you<00:02:31.920> know<00:02:32.190> you've<00:02:32.910> gotta<00:02:33.030> give<00:02:33.239> or<00:02:33.330> take<00:02:33.540> a<00:02:33.599> bit

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
you know you've gotta give or take a bit

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.050 
you know you've gotta give or take a bit
but<00:02:34.110> just<00:02:34.650> realize<00:02:34.860> if<00:02:35.220> you<00:02:35.280> do<00:02:35.459> say<00:02:35.730> three<00:02:36.030> or

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.509 
but just realize if you do say three or
four<00:02:36.330> back<00:02:36.629> to<00:02:36.810> back<00:02:36.840> day<00:02:37.290> after<00:02:37.319> day<00:02:37.620> then
