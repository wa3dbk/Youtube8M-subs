to take a hat on your trip which one
like<00:00:23.740> this<00:00:23.920> I<00:00:24.160> totally<00:00:25.029> recommend<00:00:25.359> I<00:00:25.689> just

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:26.109 
like this I totally recommend I just

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:28.290 
like this I totally recommend I just
think<00:00:26.289> it<00:00:26.439> makes<00:00:26.769> the<00:00:27.250> look<00:00:27.400> right<00:00:27.849> gives<00:00:28.179> it

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:28.300 
think it makes the look right gives it

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.630 
think it makes the look right gives it
an<00:00:28.390> extra<00:00:28.480> pop<00:00:28.839> where<00:00:29.470> it<00:00:29.679> you<00:00:30.099> don't<00:00:30.339> want<00:00:30.519> to

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:30.640 
an extra pop where it you don't want to

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.580 
an extra pop where it you don't want to
risk<00:00:30.789> crushing<00:00:31.330> it<00:00:31.419> in<00:00:31.509> your<00:00:31.660> suitcase<00:00:31.929> now

risk crushing it in your suitcase now

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:34.710 
risk crushing it in your suitcase now
when<00:00:32.770> it<00:00:32.890> comes<00:00:33.070> to<00:00:33.220> packing<00:00:33.550> I<00:00:34.000> think<00:00:34.570> it's

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:34.720 
when it comes to packing I think it's

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.720 
when it comes to packing I think it's
important<00:00:35.200> to<00:00:35.260> have<00:00:35.350> one<00:00:35.650> standout<00:00:36.430> piece

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:36.730 
important to have one standout piece

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:38.640 
important to have one standout piece
that<00:00:37.000> really<00:00:37.270> works<00:00:37.660> for<00:00:38.050> an<00:00:38.110> evening<00:00:38.380> event

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:38.650 
that really works for an evening event

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:40.860 
that really works for an evening event
but<00:00:39.130> that<00:00:39.880> you<00:00:39.970> could<00:00:40.180> wear<00:00:40.390> in<00:00:40.540> the<00:00:40.630> day<00:00:40.750> if

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:40.870

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:43.150 
you needed to as well for example a

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:45.480 
you needed to as well for example a
printed<00:00:43.930> maxi<00:00:44.170> I<00:00:44.530> could<00:00:44.740> wear<00:00:44.920> that<00:00:44.950> out<00:00:45.310> in
