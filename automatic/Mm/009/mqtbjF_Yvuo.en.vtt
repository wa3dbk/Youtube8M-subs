 laurent koubiche a horse that is 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.260
 now and since the beginning of the year 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.780

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.850
 ridiculous success of saved facility 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.590
 recently on the hippodrome du mans 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.199
 in this lot he should be able to confirm 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.539
 he is a serious opponent for the 3 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.850
 had notice on the 3rd and 5th then I 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.880
 hold number 7 very well throws horse 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.130
 of true quality that there is particular has been 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.090

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.460
 know also that the horse that the 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.930
 horse fades a good commitment to 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.060
 first step that it will be 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.810
 four for the occasion in this lot he 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.180
 credit merit 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.860
 even if the regularity is not part 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.540
 of its main qualities 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.590
 will deny it highness of mirel attention 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.850
 she is always presented wisely 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.320
 Besides, she already has two 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.140
 victories in just seventeen races 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.240
 run more than 50% success at 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.530
 the winner in this lot she must be able 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.180
 also fight for the first 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.159
 places she who ranked 4th 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.770
 recently for his return to the

 albert demarcq price 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.829
 just in the wake of avé opinion it's 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.520
 that gives him a first chance 

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:52.399
 theoretical 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.140
 the number 2 these tropics had to be 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:55.759
 always a big despite the weight of 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.429
 years the horse nothing to win a 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:00.110
 quinted over at 25 this time the lot me 

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:01.429
 seems to compose better but the horse is 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.890
 strapless four feet again 

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:05.509
 is also entrusted to eric raffin de 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.039
 which is worth to him many praises of 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:09.530
 support it is also remember the 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:11.569

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.180
 drive our favorite with 10 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:17.000
 the horse has already arrived in this 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:19.130
 gnt 2015 ranked in particular 2nd of 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.599
 the disputed stage at marseille-borély in 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.709
 this lot a place is in his ropes on 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:22.819
 short distance performance just 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:25.130
 upset his plans 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:26.510
 the eighth high of carli horse which is 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.920
 to win a quinté more like this 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.540
 time last year on the racecourse of 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.190
 pontchâteau a horse hard to the effort 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.349
 able if the need arises 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.150
 to animate the race and to print a 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:36.950
 Selective look at this little game there it 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.890
 can keep a nice attentionit attention 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:42.260
 also number 6 and a verrine from 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.910
 lodging that comes during his last 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.170
 exit to finish third behind a

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.049
 wrong to take revenge on the protected 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.880
 from matthieu abrivard 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:57.109
 but a fourth place fifth that 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.220
 him back a choice that rarely wins 

00:02:57.109 --> 00:03:01.579
 he did not pass the pole anymore 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:03.410
 since the month of February 2014 so that 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:04.940
 over a year without success for this issue 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:07.579
 6 he wants rings the cottage summary 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:12.170
 numbered for that three three five seven 

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:13.520
 as 2 12 8 and 6 1 a test of the gnt 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.580
 book again 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:18.500
 keep all its promises regarding the 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:19.970
 Following the program that cross-Laroche 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.190
 I like Antillean 205 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.930
 the family where she likes from them 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.280
 she is late for earnings and revives if 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.920
 the opportunity to fill a good part 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.320
 the places will ask 204.1 useful tracks 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.940
 or who stays on two podiums in the 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:34.700
 discipline ie the mounted trot of 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:36.800
 105 200 4 in the third I will do 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.780
 very careful with the 304 delval a 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.550
 Scandinavian that starts on our soil 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.230
 driver francois lecanu I looked at a 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:43.790
 little bit its losses a priori it must 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:45.860
 suffice to shine immediately in 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:49.310
 the hexagon 304 valves gate to its 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:51.140
 beginnings in France the name the 6th attention 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.370
 609 bassoon tenors his three 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.530
 last outings in such a society 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:56.540
 that of reserved races other winter 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:58.130
 enthusiasts have been successful a 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.530
 confirmation is expected at on 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:02.870
 also 616 tarmac that comes from the 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:05.900
 move ahead recently to saint-omer 609 and 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:08.690
 616 in the seventh I really like the 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.560
 702 haruna jackets who is undefeated 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:11.810
 in two outings this year 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.670
 the only downside is that it is not his 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:16.160
 reference request rope left he has 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.580
 especially shone in the immediate rope to 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.900
 right 

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:22.310
 I will ask the 705 in this 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:24.380
 competition service iad always 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:26.300
 Presented wisely already laureate on 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.860
 this track of the crusader laroche is 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.940
 present and especially déferré of the four 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:31.670
 feet for the first time from his 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:33.830
 career it smells trust the 713 

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:35.810
 zen australia should only leave to a 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:37.880
 outsider rating but beware it's a 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:39.380
 quality filly according to his 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.060
 entourage is behind earnings and in 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:43.529
 this lot it seems to me able to integrate 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:46.279
 the trio has a speculative rating 

00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:48.749
 702 705 and for the coast 713

00:05:02.489 --> 00:05:06.239
 last month deserves credit 

00:05:04.559 --> 00:05:07.889
 but in this test attention to 

00:05:06.239 --> 00:05:08.939

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:09.689
 in the morning and in any case she gives 

00:05:08.939 --> 00:05:15.059
 satisfaction 

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:16.499
 it's the 705 the training boy set

 program 

00:05:31.379 --> 00:05:35.609
 with three horses which in my opinion 

00:05:33.059 --> 00:05:37.769
 seem to stand out from the crowd on 707 

00:05:35.609 --> 00:05:40.679
 ending spirit who is close to his 

00:05:37.769 --> 00:05:42.149
