00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.610
 this time from android go from the middle 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.619
 overwhelmed because I'm capturing 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.300
 directly on the device in the 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.600
 neighborhood of the safe poet and shitting are 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:24.450
 good 48-point coreses myths is 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.520

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:29.460
 Caixa is a game made by an Argentine 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:32.220

 free simple ray playability there 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:37.280
 to touch only the cost with the 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.280
 little arrow from the other planet 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:43.920
 if you want to apply but that's how 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.809
 parts so there 's no stopping and there 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.809
 that overcoming the biggest record is 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.480
 reminder to remember that you are the 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.629

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.629

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:04.129
 while you are in the bathroom or traveling 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:07.070

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:09.409
 in drying there is already the most 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:12.280
 little dots so there it is convenient that 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:15.079

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.570

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.800

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.750

 multiplayer version of the slender class and 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:56.640

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:21.330
 what happens and does not happen does not happen but the 18 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.330
 points is the maximum gay score 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.830
 although it may not seem so 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:32.750
 it is not easy to point out how far 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.750
