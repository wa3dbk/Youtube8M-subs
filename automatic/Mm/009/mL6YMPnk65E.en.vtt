00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.299
 who sees her so silent with a smile 

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:09.240
 serene broad you can never imagine that 

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:11.280
 when one of your classmates competes 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.289
 so the days of Carla Macri or with 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.450
 the acarigua doll that hits 

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:17.039
 hard in the 51 kilograms of boxing 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.200
 feminine and who lives his first 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.110
 Olympic games characterize me by 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:25.380
 support my colleagues and in a way 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:28.769
 quite particular I scream 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.320
 love to scream this auparlo because I know 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.900
 that is up there and then when 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.540
 you support him one as he feels 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:38.520
 more strength and goes with more enthusiasm towards 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.010
 the opponent so 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.650
 I try to spend all my energy 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.170
 positive it to transmit all that 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:47.310
 so that they give their best there 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.900
 above 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:50.940
 since he arrived at the place where he 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:53.010
 dispute boxing in the excel complex 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.050
 Carla has not stopped encouraging the cold 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.570
 london that although it is in 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.340
 full summer and in Olympic games not 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.360
 ends up facing the maximum 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.360
 universal sport appointment 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.440
 and I say that the same passion towards 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.750
 sport that makes boxing 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:12.420
 that feeling that I have was a 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.910
 ring that moved me and was the way 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.680
 involuntary innate is not that I 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:19.500
 planned to me and scream I'm going to 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.060
 do you that, but I see my 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.490
 partner and fighting against the 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.280
 opposite and it seems like 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:29.430
 I was there and he starts to tell 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.800
 thing and support it in such a way to 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.260
 that they feel that they are not alone 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.270
 there 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.740
 for their peers the encouragement that 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.540
 provides more crazy from the stands is 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.920
 fundamental in its aspirations of 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.090
 get good results in 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.470
 london-2012 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:46.400
 it is a support that we owe very good 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.930
 is excellent is well carla really 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.210
 thank you very much for the good support and so 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.560
 also be made to the public a lot since 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.330
 Well the public could not give us 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.820
 another Venezuelan and well I hope he said 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.650
 and why not for the train with that 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.870
 indisputable feature of the 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:03.040
 idiosyncrasy of who wears a flag 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:03.040
 of three colors and others
