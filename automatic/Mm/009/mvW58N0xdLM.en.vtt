what's interesting is this guy was never
obviously<00:00:36.960> Boba<00:00:37.230> Fett<00:00:37.380> was<00:00:37.410> never<00:00:37.680> in<00:00:37.829> new

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
obviously Boba Fett was never in new

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.520 
obviously Boba Fett was never in new
hope<00:00:38.190> so<00:00:39.000> that<00:00:39.210> was<00:00:39.360> though<00:00:39.719> strange<00:00:40.110> now<00:00:40.410> if

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
hope so that was though strange now if

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:41.690 
hope so that was though strange now if
it<00:00:40.620> looks<00:00:40.770> a<00:00:40.800> lot<00:00:40.860> more<00:00:40.950> colorful<00:00:41.460> than<00:00:41.489> you

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
it looks a lot more colorful than you

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.760 
it looks a lot more colorful than you
remember<00:00:42.059> from<00:00:42.239> movies<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:43.050> reason<00:00:43.350> being<00:00:43.379> is

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
remember from movies the reason being is

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.250 
remember from movies the reason being is
because<00:00:43.829> if<00:00:44.370> you<00:00:44.460> were<00:00:44.579> coming<00:00:44.730> back<00:00:44.850> here<00:00:45.260> it

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
because if you were coming back here it

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.029 
because if you were coming back here it
was<00:00:46.440> figure<00:00:47.219> so<00:00:47.550> yeah<00:00:47.760> okay<00:00:48.210> they<00:00:48.329> go<00:00:48.800> 1979<00:00:49.800> is

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
was figure so yeah okay they go 1979 is

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.439
