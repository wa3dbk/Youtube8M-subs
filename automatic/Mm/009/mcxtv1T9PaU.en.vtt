just like original PSP I'm going to look

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.369 
just like original PSP I'm going to look
at<00:01:03.120> a<00:01:03.149> bit<00:01:03.329> of<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.510> touchscreen<00:01:04.019> that<00:01:04.170> sort<00:01:04.350> of

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
at a bit of the touchscreen that sort of

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.550 
at a bit of the touchscreen that sort of
screen<00:01:04.589> is<00:01:04.710> really<00:01:04.949> reactive<00:01:05.600> it<00:01:06.600> reminds<00:01:07.409> me

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
screen is really reactive it reminds me

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.010 
screen is really reactive it reminds me
of<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:08.310> iphone<00:01:08.700> you<00:01:09.330> see<00:01:09.570> all<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.780> games

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
of the iphone you see all the games

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.539 
of the iphone you see all the games
though<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.439> games<00:01:10.650> come<00:01:10.860> up<00:01:10.950> with<00:01:11.130> like<00:01:11.310> up

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
though the games come up with like up

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.109 
though the games come up with like up
basic<00:01:12.000> I<00:01:12.090> think<00:01:12.270> it's<00:01:12.420> more<00:01:12.479> apt<00:01:12.900> based<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:14.119> I

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
basic I think it's more apt based and I

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.359 
basic I think it's more apt based and I
was<00:01:15.509> a<00:01:15.810> little<00:01:16.140> bit<00:01:16.259> naughty<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:16.920> went<00:01:17.100> into

was a little bit naughty and went into

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.499 
was a little bit naughty and went into
the<00:01:17.549> settings<00:01:17.970> of<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.479> PlayStation<00:01:19.790> Vita<00:01:20.790> to

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
the settings of the PlayStation Vita to

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
I don't know if that's a new feature or

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.980 
I don't know if that's a new feature or
not<00:01:28.740> because<00:01:28.920> I<00:01:29.130> wasn't<00:01:29.310> really<00:01:29.549> up<00:01:29.790> on<00:01:30.000> new

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
not because I wasn't really up on new

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.780 
not because I wasn't really up on new
things<00:01:31.290> for<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.650> original<00:01:32.130> PSP<00:01:32.369> cuz<00:01:32.729> I

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
things for the original PSP cuz I

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.210 
things for the original PSP cuz I
stopped<00:01:33.090> playing<00:01:33.210> it<00:01:33.659> but<00:01:34.350> that's<00:01:34.530> new<00:01:34.829> as<00:01:35.040> far

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
stopped playing it but that's new as far

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.640 
stopped playing it but that's new as far
as<00:01:35.310> I'm<00:01:35.430> concerned<00:01:35.460> and<00:01:36.270> you've<00:01:37.259> got<00:01:37.439> ad<00:01:37.619> on

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
as I'm concerned and you've got ad on

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.030 
as I'm concerned and you've got ad on
data<00:01:38.040> so<00:01:38.310> I'm<00:01:38.400> guessing<00:01:38.579> this<00:01:38.790> is<00:01:38.939> all<00:01:39.060> DLC

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 
data so I'm guessing this is all DLC

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.280 
data so I'm guessing this is all DLC
stuff<00:01:41.040> like<00:01:41.220> that<00:01:41.250> these<00:01:42.030> are<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.390> games<00:01:42.899> that

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
stuff like that these are the games that

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.230 
stuff like that these are the games that
are<00:01:44.220> currently<00:01:44.520> on<00:01:44.670> this<00:01:44.939> PS<00:01:45.899> Vita<00:01:45.930> which<00:01:46.740> I

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
are currently on this PS Vita which I

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:53.620 
are currently on this PS Vita which I
was<00:01:48.240> playing<00:01:48.600> and<00:01:50.360> I<00:01:51.360> think<00:01:52.020> if<00:01:52.380> you<00:01:52.560> click<00:01:52.740> on

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
was playing and I think if you click on

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.819 
was playing and I think if you click on
everybody's<00:01:54.630> golf<00:01:54.869> though<00:01:55.049> there's<00:01:55.200> no<00:01:55.320> dlc

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
everybody's golf though there's no dlc

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.590 
everybody's golf though there's no dlc
for<00:01:55.979> that<00:01:56.159> song<00:01:56.520> and<00:01:57.210> there's<00:01:57.540> no<00:01:57.600> save<00:01:57.990> data

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
for that song and there's no save data

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.569 
for that song and there's no save data
so<00:02:00.600> is<00:02:00.899> sound<00:02:01.200> and<00:02:01.350> display<00:02:01.770> you<00:02:02.369> got<00:02:02.490> the

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
so is sound and display you got the

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.359 
so is sound and display you got the
brightness<00:02:03.770> probably<00:02:04.770> should<00:02:04.920> have<00:02:05.009> kept<00:02:05.219> it

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
brightness probably should have kept it

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.999 
brightness probably should have kept it
down<00:02:05.549> for<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.030> garden<00:02:06.420> of<00:02:06.509> this<00:02:06.689> video<00:02:07.009> but

here and system information systems
software<00:02:33.870> 1.51<00:02:34.680> obviously<00:02:35.340> and<00:02:35.720> memory<00:02:36.720> card

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
software 1.51 obviously and memory card

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.940 
software 1.51 obviously and memory card
capacity<00:02:37.350> 14<00:02:37.620> gig<00:02:38.160> and<00:02:38.660> 6000<00:02:39.660> megabytes<00:02:40.380> is

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
capacity 14 gig and 6000 megabytes is

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.850 
capacity 14 gig and 6000 megabytes is
free<00:02:41.430> so<00:02:42.000> six<00:02:42.240> gigs<00:02:42.450> free<00:02:42.720> I<00:02:42.810> think<00:02:43.280> and<00:02:44.540> also

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
free so six gigs free I think and also

another<00:04:01.470> thing<00:04:01.650> i<00:04:01.800> found<00:04:02.070> was<00:04:02.460> when<00:04:03.060> you<00:04:03.180> slide

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540

another thing i found was when you slide
or<00:04:04.110> put<00:04:04.560> stirs<00:04:04.890> up<00:04:05.100> you<00:04:05.730> can<00:04:05.880> old<00:04:06.000> trophies<00:04:06.480> but

or put stirs up you can old trophies but

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.630 
or put stirs up you can old trophies but
the<00:04:06.990> truth<00:04:07.200> when<00:04:07.530> you<00:04:07.560> click<00:04:07.890> trophies<00:04:08.340> its

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 
the truth when you click trophies its

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.150 
the truth when you click trophies its
start<00:04:09.060> so<00:04:09.720> and<00:04:09.990> even<00:04:10.200> when<00:04:10.440> settings<00:04:10.980> as<00:04:11.130> well

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
start so and even when settings as well

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.340 
start so and even when settings as well
when<00:04:11.430> you<00:04:11.490> go<00:04:11.610> into<00:04:11.730> settings<00:04:12.260> obviously<00:04:13.260> I've

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350 
when you go into settings obviously I've

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:14.810 
when you go into settings obviously I've
got<00:04:13.440> no<00:04:13.530> trophies<00:04:13.950> but<00:04:14.100> when<00:04:14.250> you<00:04:14.340> go<00:04:14.459> into<00:04:14.610> the

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
got no trophies but when you go into the

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:19.130 
got no trophies but when you go into the
settings<00:04:15.030> its<00:04:16.040> start<00:04:17.299> these<00:04:18.299> settings<00:04:18.750> so

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:19.140 
settings its start these settings so

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:21.140 
settings its start these settings so
everything<00:04:19.650> is<00:04:19.830> application-based<00:04:20.459> I<00:04:20.910> think

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
everything is application-based I think

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.570 
everything is application-based I think
this<00:04:21.840> is<00:04:22.049> another<00:04:22.530> application<00:04:23.190> that<00:04:23.460> was

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
this is another application that was

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.780 
this is another application that was
mentioned<00:04:23.850> about<00:04:24.000> on<00:04:24.300> which<00:04:25.110> was<00:04:25.380> near

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:26.790 
mentioned about on which was near

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:28.250 
mentioned about on which was near
and<00:04:26.880> the<00:04:27.390> whole<00:04:27.540> idea<00:04:27.600> of<00:04:27.930> this<00:04:28.050> application

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:28.260 
and the whole idea of this application

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:29.750 
and the whole idea of this application
is<00:04:28.710> so<00:04:28.890> you<00:04:28.950> can<00:04:29.100> find<00:04:29.310> out<00:04:29.400> what<00:04:29.550> people

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:29.760 
is so you can find out what people

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.580

stuff<00:05:10.410> I<00:05:10.710> can<00:05:10.830> imagine<00:05:10.950> this<00:05:11.190> being<00:05:11.250> played

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 
stuff I can imagine this being played

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.850 
stuff I can imagine this being played
with<00:05:11.760> like<00:05:11.910> street<00:05:12.330> fighter<00:05:12.360> or<00:05:12.930> tacking<00:05:13.650> out

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:13.860 
with like street fighter or tacking out

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:16.120 
with like street fighter or tacking out
that<00:05:14.160> I<00:05:14.190> think<00:05:14.490> that'd<00:05:14.610> be<00:05:14.760> really<00:05:14.970> good<00:05:15.240> and

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:16.130 
that I think that'd be really good and

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:20.360 
that I think that'd be really good and
you<00:05:17.130> move<00:05:17.370> the<00:05:17.550> camera<00:05:18.440> to<00:05:19.440> follow<00:05:20.070> the

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.370 
you move the camera to follow the

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:22.160 
you move the camera to follow the
fighters<00:05:20.820> like<00:05:21.150> the<00:05:21.510> camera<00:05:22.020> doesn't

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:22.170 
fighters like the camera doesn't

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:23.660 
fighters like the camera doesn't
automatically<00:05:22.710> move<00:05:22.980> you<00:05:23.130> have<00:05:23.190> to<00:05:23.250> move<00:05:23.520> the

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:23.670 
automatically move you have to move the

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:26.000 
automatically move you have to move the
PS<00:05:23.880> pieces<00:05:24.300> Pierce<00:05:24.720> of<00:05:24.870> the<00:05:25.020> system<00:05:25.650> can<00:05:25.920> get

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.010 
PS pieces Pierce of the system can get

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:28.460 
PS pieces Pierce of the system can get
used<00:05:26.160> to<00:05:26.250> playing<00:05:26.340> psv<00:05:26.990> but<00:05:27.990> you<00:05:28.080> have<00:05:28.200> to<00:05:28.320> move

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:28.470 
used to playing psv but you have to move

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:31.850 
used to playing psv but you have to move
a<00:05:28.530> ps3<00:05:28.890> system<00:05:29.400> to<00:05:30.290> follow<00:05:31.290> the<00:05:31.470> fighters

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:31.860 
a ps3 system to follow the fighters

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:34.160 
a ps3 system to follow the fighters
instead<00:05:32.280> of<00:05:32.400> the<00:05:32.580> screen<00:05:33.450> just<00:05:33.690> doing<00:05:33.900> it<00:05:34.050> for

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:34.170 
instead of the screen just doing it for

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:35.780 
instead of the screen just doing it for
you<00:05:34.320> which<00:05:34.830> i<00:05:34.920> think<00:05:34.950> is<00:05:35.160> really<00:05:35.460> really<00:05:35.580> nice

at the technology that you can play with
with<00:05:40.560> that<00:05:40.710> is<00:05:40.800> really<00:05:41.160> really<00:05:41.310> exciting<00:05:41.840> so

second analog stick on which will be

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:13.780 
second analog stick on which will be
