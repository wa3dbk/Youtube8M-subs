00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.149
 hello francisco people I hope you know 

00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:05.520
 find very well since in this 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:10.400
 on occasion we are going to talk about the new 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.400
 disney pixar intensely 

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:21.310
 this new animated movie is 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:23.140
 directed by pete docter and surely to 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:24.750
 sometimes we do not know very well the name of 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:28.269
 the directors of animated films 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.550
 but this man has been the mind 

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:33.250
 bright behind trig the monsters 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:35.080
 inc or also wrote for example the 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.690
 first and second part of toy story 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:40.120
 and is currently developing 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.519
 the fourth really is a very person 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.980
 incredible and now brings us the new 

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:46.090
 film intensely before 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.590
 start talking about this 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:50.109
 I want to share some movie with you 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:51.789
 more personal the truth to me from the entrance 

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:53.320
 I was not struck by this movie 

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:54.840
 when I saw the trailer when I go to the 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.210
 images 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.190
 I did not do anything interesting or anything 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.680
 again I did not want to see the movie the 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.630
 true but thanks to no undertaking I had 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.320
 the opportunity to see this movie makes 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:09.240
 some months in pixar in san francisco 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.610
 this wonderful study where they have 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.800
 made many of the great movies 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.380
 that have marked good to me yes the 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.340
 truth and apart from this allegedly 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.380
 there was the opportunity also of 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.000
 interview the director the producer of 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.820
 I will also share this movie 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.500
 soon these videos of course 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.290
 that this experience generated a 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.360
 perception of the tape in my head and 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.560
 I thought that's why it could be a little 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.360
 blurred 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.460
 my rating so to speak but 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.950
 now that he again with other 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.560
 people in a normal room with friends 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.149
 I realized that everything that I 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.160
 I perceived from the movie they too 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:46.410
 vision in this way so here 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.330
 what I thought intensely 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:50.940
 as you will have seen in some trailers or 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.170
 posters we have emotions that do not 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:56.880
 they are the protagonists of this movie 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:59.820
 they are joy, sadness, anger, disgust and 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.159
 and these characters are going to live inside 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.259
 the head of wylie that is a small 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.960
 girl who has just moved from minnesota 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:09.899
 to san francisco and this city ​​change 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.989
 of new friends from home school is 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.760
 making a mess within your 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:17.370
 brain of course where are we going to 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.560
 have these hilarious characters 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.750
 What really catches my attention is that 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:25.110
 regularly in pixar we have 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:27.260
 very imaginative situations or atmospheres 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.760
 we have monsters talking toys 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.760
 characters in space or rats that 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:35.880
 they want to be a chef etc. but here's what 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.920
 that we have are human if we have a 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.140
 emotions is inside the head 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.400
 talking in a control center but 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.950
 who are controlling are controlling 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.110
 to the humans that are going through 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.540
 different problems and not just the 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.690
 human beings but to a girl the fact that 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.370
 are touching these topics I think it's very 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:56.130
 interesting and really I think that 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.140
 christopher nolan the director of the 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:01.380
 trilogy of batman and inception 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:03.870
 specifically I would be very proud 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:06.690
 the work of pete docter because because 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.730
 achieved in a very concise way and very 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:11.520
 smart explain the different 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.530
 stages of brain thinking how 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.330
 connects to the different situations to 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.790
 the ones we face and how they are going to 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.110
 react in different ways 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:22.080
 just the joy the sadness the 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:23.160
 anger, disgust and fear and not only that 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.320
 but we also have the 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.840
 characters out there going into different 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:29.820
 stages of our mind to different 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.850
 recesses that are not only 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:35.280
 interesting but very fun and 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:38.040
 talking funny this movie of 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:40.380
 really long time since I laughed so 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.600
 the more a film has many 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.340
 funny situations there are times in the 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.860
 that the movies want to make us laugh 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.390
 especially in the case of animations 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:51.870
 things a little more directed to the public 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:53.280
 children have moments that are supposed 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:55.740
 we would have to laugh but not 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:59.400
 they are so funny here, really, not 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:02.160
 happens that 90-95 maybe for me almost 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.290
 100% the moments and all 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.790
 truly fun if I had the 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.530
 opportunity to see her in English 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:10.560
 as in Spanish and I must say that the 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:12.030
 Latin dubbing is very well done 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.700
 the truth that the jokes also 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.500
 they work very well something interesting is 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:19.019
 that even though we have emotions or 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:21.239
 characters as so unilateral is 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:25.080
 say is angry is happy is 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:26.910
 sad still they have a lot of volume the 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.830
 way they interact with each other 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:31.320
 and the actions they carry out to 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:34.320
 that the girl reacts in a certain way 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:35.430
 They are not only fun but very 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.170
 interesting and I think that even 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:39.480
 seeing her again is finding 

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:41.610
 very good little details and talking about 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:43.080
 detallitos if the truck is to 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:45.600
 this planet that appears in all 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:47.910
 specific pixar movies in the 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:50.040
 memories is where it's going to appear is 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:51.540
 It is also why they put a lot 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:53.370
 attention I did not see it I hope you 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:55.470
 yes you know where it is for me to 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:57.180
 then count clear when dealing with a 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:58.830
 animated film how is the 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:01.200
 animation the truth is pretty good 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:03.000
 I was not convinced by the characters 

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:05.070
 much of the mind because I felt like that 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.639
 they lacked a layer and like I did not know 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:07.889
 do 

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:10.169
 but that's because in the real world in 

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:12.120
 the human world everything is more complex the 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:13.919
 details are more specific more 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:16.199
 exquisite so to speak even if 

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:19.199
 that like quesadillas with an envelope 

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:20.849
 technical but I do not mean that the 

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:22.499
 animation is handled differently from within and 

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:25.110
 outside the head which is very good 

00:05:22.499 --> 00:05:27.330
 and what I loved about the human world is 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:29.819
 which is very realistic do not try to do it 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:31.349
 that is beautiful that looks perfect is not 

00:05:29.819 --> 00:05:34.110
 see how they are francisco as is 

00:05:31.349 --> 00:05:36.560
 really with trash in the streets or with 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:39.120
 a very nice golden gate but with 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:42.479
 trash in the street then it remains 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:44.669
 pretty good but beyond all 

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:46.800
 these things what I loved and what 

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:49.379
 it really deserves a very good feeling 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:52.139
 of the movie is the message that has 

00:05:49.379 --> 00:05:53.909
 the message at the end of the movie is no 

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:55.460
 only one of the best that I have 

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:58.500
 seen in some animated film 

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:59.990
 but in the whole family cinema in general 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:02.459
 it really is 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:04.379
 nice and good I guess a question 

00:06:02.459 --> 00:06:06.209
 basic is this movie works for 

00:06:04.379 --> 00:06:08.580
 children I think it is a formula 

00:06:06.209 --> 00:06:11.520
 fun although I think that suddenly 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:13.169
 because of the subject that is handled, a 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:14.789
 understand it better and that 

00:06:13.169 --> 00:06:17.189
 It usually happens to us when we see a 

00:06:14.789 --> 00:06:18.869
 animated film of children and adults 

00:06:17.189 --> 00:06:20.939
 we see her again we did not have 

00:06:18.869 --> 00:06:22.409
 understood this from the movie without 

00:06:20.939 --> 00:06:24.179
 But here I do not believe that the message 

00:06:22.409 --> 00:06:26.069
 be direct but it's a very message 

00:06:24.179 --> 00:06:27.599
 direct but that the children have not 

00:06:26.069 --> 00:06:29.429
 crossed so much by that kind of 

00:06:27.599 --> 00:06:31.559
 situations like to understand it from 

00:06:29.429 --> 00:06:33.089
 such a strong way but if you 

00:06:31.559 --> 00:06:35.969
 they are family parents they will love them 

00:06:33.089 --> 00:06:37.169
 are young people adults children yo 

00:06:35.969 --> 00:06:39.509
 I think it's a movie extremely 

00:06:37.169 --> 00:06:41.969
 enjoyable the only thing would be that the 

00:06:39.509 --> 00:06:43.979
 Dancing character is not that endearing 

00:06:41.969 --> 00:06:46.819
 for saying compared to but the 

00:06:43.979 --> 00:06:50.459
 monsters inc but out of that the truth 

00:06:46.819 --> 00:06:52.439
 this is my favorite pixar movie 

00:06:50.459 --> 00:06:54.809
 after the first part of toy story 

00:06:52.439 --> 00:06:55.920
 and how can you imagine this 

00:06:54.809 --> 00:06:57.889
 movie I give 

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:59.749
 5 stars 

00:06:57.889 --> 00:07:01.460
