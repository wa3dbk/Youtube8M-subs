 Aachen 

00:00:16.499 --> 00:00:20.059
 Water friends I'm full of Benni and today there is the first gameplay that 

00:00:20.059 --> 00:00:24.070
 work is faster and that of the dear LPX Worms 2 I hope I got it 

00:00:24.069 --> 00:00:25.960
 reasonably correct 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:31.499
 but he has filmed a nice HD 16 to 9 formatted it percent 

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:34.560
 ND show receives team-deathmatch on the card 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.500
 with watches JÃ¶rg go for the on the right side 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.620
 and more DLP Tom is now leading either 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.290
 and when he links description again 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.480
 and or 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.830
 in which or in the picture below left and right or of course quite 2 5 m 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:51.560
 I was also able to do EW Bullinger Twitter 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.260
 but also promises 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.950
 that's why i miss it so i get right to the point 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.170
 So far, the doku-soap was what I now Blatter noticed 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.580
 where nobody leads blame does oak not because I immediately Kampen and a bit 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:06.300
 lazy 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.080
 there is always a topic 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.020
 and the topic is spoken by really almost EU comes Arte Lounge 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.210
 and then if everyone was already fed so everyone has to live 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.060
 then I come it's about it is one of them 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.040
 and that's how it is today and I think most of us know it 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.230
 Drums goes and he goes again to the the YouTube partnership 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:26.550
 be beaten 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:27.800
 we will 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.380
 no the door partner 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.310
 not at the moment I do not know how the whole looks in the six months but 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.740
 Percent you can get on it is also a nice movie next 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.210
 Months next two months this may not be a youtube partner 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.860
 It is so that we did not hold the offer we had the offer 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.240
 on Friday 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.450
 It would have said on Friday yes I want to be the partner then 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.110
 Friday would have been so wonderful advertising Fund as well as enjoy 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.890
 but Donath Reitemann is not concerned about the coal 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.080
 yes cool thing about so horny effect can find pocket money us 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.950
 Schmettow spring clearly do not have a problem 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.210
 and he meant when their guests 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.880
 and second Greece back for what pretty much the case in two weeks 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:09.539
 will be 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.749
 then we are the partners and then it's cool 

00:02:11.749 --> 00:02:14.549
 I am clearly not a problem I speech that 

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:17.920
 "But then I thought about it with no end, with just about everyone 

00:02:17.919 --> 00:02:21.159
 Comment on the typical throb of hearing his opinion 

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:23.499
 and the stress itself 

00:02:23.499 --> 00:02:26.579
 m if result did not come the goutierten these partners will be 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:30.939
 there is a video by Max f he probably understands what 

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:34.989
 many have seen what but still often left to he has one 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:36.990
 little something tells about the whole 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:40.459
 Lagerkoller great scene when all partners are then 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:44.110
 I am really his opinion because we have that day 

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:47.450
 even a one-and-a-half-hour Skype conversation and exactly over 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:48.909
 this theme 

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:51.889
 if you want to watch then we also get into the description or now 

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:54.889
 the screen then it will also be up from the left 

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:59.549
 the story is possible because we said exactly what he said is just under 20 minutes 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:00.529
 on 

00:03:00.529 --> 00:03:02.109
 but 

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:05.729
 but she gets the bulk of what he says when I do 

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:08.200
 agree or percent cannes 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.629
 also confirm 

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:12.629
 to look at the annoyance just paint on the left click 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:16.460
 Well, good that the BaFin already leads to the end 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:19.840
 I have 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.250
 I never said that the project partners somehow 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.050
 that now at Fach- or so I find quite 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:28.509
 for which it takes a cool thing I have my payton order 

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:30.029
 and therefore 

00:03:30.029 --> 00:03:33.019
 is not a problem for me so I do not find it reprehensible or 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:34.349
 bad about 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:37.449
 OK for me it is not a problem now partners I really have no 

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:40.689
 Problem with that has understood so that now denied the other university 

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:43.199
 or that's the moralist now. No 

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:46.059
 I do not think it's bad I think it's good for you they earn a little 

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:50.209
 Pocket money is not bad is also quite legitimate for their work 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:51.959
 that's why BusinessWorld comes across
