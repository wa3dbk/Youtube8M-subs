00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:07.020
 with this lesson we try to build 1 cube using the software of 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.939
 geogebra 

00:00:08.939 --> 00:00:14.679
 from the currents ci 10 we choose the driver tool let's click of a 

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:16.309
 mouse 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:21.169
 in the window that opens in place of the letter we type the topa 

00:00:21.909 --> 00:00:26.329
 in the interval we type for the minimum 1 mass 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:28.110
 v10 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:30.789
 increase d 1 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:32.780
 and click on apply 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.580
 we have our now white Rome - let's try to move it 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.540
 put it in a scooter 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.530
 bother 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.960
 the incintri icon 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.960
 we choose feeling of nanny lengths. 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.410
 we are cool on the plan 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.550
 working wife in the window that opens type side 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.160
 we do ok 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.460
 we therefore have our segment abb 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.780
 whose berair length to vary the point on the last idea 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.950
 then we find we bury the bury tool from the icon in c1 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.370
 we bring 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:16.380
 point on the deckchair 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.380
 emilian than the length of ours 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:25.190
 nightmare in fact the Mariella edge from a centimeter to a maximum of 10 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.710
 we report ours 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:28.780
 cube 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.780
 don't download me cd 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.570
 with the tbc icon 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:40.680
 5 regular polygon then we take the regular polygon tool we click 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:41.820
 on the point year 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.160
 sup. you 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.810
 in the window that opens ciencias 4 then we click ok 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.510
 we have our own 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:51.530
 square 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.890
 dolly cool and awake the pc 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.780
 we choose a carrier tele2.it 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.729
 we are here with the mouse 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.510
 sheet from, moro 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:04.770
 and let's draw you 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.859
 our victor 1 

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:09.999
 who is given by segment b 

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:16.049
 now we must translate the vertices of the square according to this love there 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:21.539
 so don't cuncheddi I cook a nice, let's choose from the sound of a vector 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:25.269
 I'll call you soon. years 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:29.269
 and then on the liquid carrier by e-mail. Apennines 

00:02:30.419 --> 00:02:32.809
 click on point b 

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:35.329
 i then on the carrier 

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:37.649
 sup. db 

00:02:37.649 --> 00:02:39.929

00:02:39.929 --> 00:02:43.059
 they beat you the operation. of

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:06.219
 now we just have to onload not the tool olycom ilary kunai c5 

00:03:06.219 --> 00:03:11.539
 connect the vertices of all the faces of the cube monster then we start with d 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:15.609

00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:43.179
 to see it 

00:03:43.179 --> 00:03:47.729
 the movement we take is beautiful the icon lecce 1 new new I love the tip of the 

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:49.809
 our slideshare 

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:51.429
 and we come 

00:03:51.429 --> 00:03:56.189
 so the first of our readers we see how me north roccobarocco we are 

00:03:56.189 --> 00:03:57.779
 to rotate 

00:03:57.779 --> 00:03:59.199
 in 

00:03:59.199 --> 00:04:01.949
 Ugh we notice that there is 

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:04.760
 a track that we have not connected 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.459
 so at this point we sell 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:10.619

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:15.459
 let's go to connect 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:17.049
 have a nice evening 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:19.590

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:35.379
 we move from new we believe that now all faces 

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:36.900
 have been 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.520

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.819
 also because we leave our position of another 

00:04:43.819 --> 00:04:45.129
 reading now 

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:48.660
 we just have to format our audience 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:50.029
 going to choose 

00:04:50.029 --> 00:04:55.099
