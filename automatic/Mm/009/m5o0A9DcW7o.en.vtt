so you can see the focus is hunting a
little<00:00:02.550> bit<00:00:02.790> actually<00:00:03.480> a<00:00:03.689> fair<00:00:03.899> bit<00:00:04.339> but

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
little bit actually a fair bit but

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:06.769 
little bit actually a fair bit but
that's<00:00:05.520> typical<00:00:05.730> a<00:00:06.180> New<00:00:06.299> Yorker<00:00:06.569> to<00:00:06.660> get

that's typical a New Yorker to get

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:08.690 
that's typical a New Yorker to get
anything<00:00:06.960> better<00:00:07.200> not<00:00:07.470> on<00:00:07.589> a<00:00:07.680> DSLR<00:00:07.890> except

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
anything better not on a DSLR except

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.509 
anything better not on a DSLR except
maybe<00:00:08.880> the<00:00:09.000> 70d<00:00:09.860> so<00:00:10.860> that's<00:00:11.010> just<00:00:11.070> curious

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
maybe the 70d so that's just curious

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.070 
maybe the 70d so that's just curious
what<00:00:11.700> would<00:00:11.849> happen<00:00:12.240> if<00:00:12.360> I<00:00:12.480> just<00:00:12.509> monkied

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
what would happen if I just monkied

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.340 
what would happen if I just monkied
around<00:00:13.440> here<00:00:13.769> and<00:00:14.009> did<00:00:14.969> some<00:00:15.260> letting<00:00:16.260> the

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
around here and did some letting the

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.380 
around here and did some letting the
camera<00:00:16.830> set<00:00:17.070> the<00:00:17.190> exposure<00:00:17.640> because<00:00:17.970> I'm<00:00:18.180> just

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
camera set the exposure because I'm just

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:19.939 
camera set the exposure because I'm just
controlling<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:18.960> shutter<00:00:19.230> speed<00:00:19.590> because

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
controlling the shutter speed because

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.540 
controlling the shutter speed because
that's<00:00:20.160> important<00:00:21.029> for<00:00:21.180> video<00:00:22.340> Penny's<00:00:23.340> like

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
what are you doing let's do a okay so to

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.089 
what are you doing let's do a okay so to
take<00:00:28.920> a<00:00:29.420> picture<00:00:30.420> it's<00:00:31.080> not<00:00:31.320> clicking<00:00:31.740> one

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099

when I push the shutter button so I have

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.290 
when I push the shutter button so I have
to<00:00:34.860> check<00:00:35.100> on<00:00:35.280> that<00:00:35.340> maybe<00:00:35.670> it's<00:00:36.030> a<00:00:36.120> different

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
to check on that maybe it's a different

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.790 
to check on that maybe it's a different
way<00:00:36.630> to<00:00:36.660> do<00:00:36.930> a<00:00:36.960> photo<00:00:37.200> while<00:00:37.500> you're<00:00:37.649> shooting

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
video because i'm looking down at it

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.429 
video because i'm looking down at it
instead<00:01:15.180> of<00:01:15.240> having<00:01:15.450> to<00:01:15.540> squat<00:01:15.840> down<00:01:16.170> behind

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
instead of having to squat down behind

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.429 
instead of having to squat down behind
the<00:01:16.799> camera<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:17.450> there's<00:01:18.450> penny<00:01:18.840> up<00:01:19.049> close

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
the camera and there's penny up close

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.850 
the camera and there's penny up close
let's<00:01:19.740> see<00:01:19.920> how<00:01:20.009> fast<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.610> camera<00:01:20.939> will<00:01:21.860> they

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
let's see how fast the camera will they

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.429 
let's see how fast the camera will they
were<00:01:22.979> coming<00:01:23.310> into<00:01:23.520> focus<00:01:23.729> i<00:01:24.150> suspect<00:01:25.110> that<00:01:25.229> a

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
were coming into focus i suspect that a

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.160 
were coming into focus i suspect that a
faster<00:01:25.890> lens<00:01:26.159> like<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.880> f2<00:01:27.330> 8<00:01:27.479> 24<00:01:27.960> would

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
faster lens like the f2 8 24 would

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.350 
faster lens like the f2 8 24 would
probably<00:01:28.530> focus<00:01:28.890> faster<00:01:29.310> on<00:01:29.490> this<00:01:29.670> perhaps

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
probably focus faster on this perhaps

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.630 
probably focus faster on this perhaps
even<00:01:30.750> a<00:01:32.030> fast<00:01:33.030> Prime<00:01:33.360> with<00:01:33.720> 35<00:01:34.409> or<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.860> 50<00:01:35.610> or

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
even a fast Prime with 35 or the 50 or

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.350 
even a fast Prime with 35 or the 50 or
something<00:01:36.979> so<00:01:37.979> anyways<00:01:38.369> that's<00:01:38.640> Betty<00:01:39.030> to<00:01:39.180> boa
