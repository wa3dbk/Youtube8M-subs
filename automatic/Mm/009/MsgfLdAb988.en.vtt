was<00:01:56.479> the<00:01:56.600> first<00:01:56.780> person<00:01:57.140> I<00:01:57.229> saw<00:01:57.439> kind<00:01:57.979> of<00:01:58.130> off

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
was the first person I saw kind of off

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.639 
was the first person I saw kind of off
the<00:01:58.759> boat<00:01:59.090> when<00:01:59.270> I<00:01:59.329> got<00:01:59.509> to<00:01:59.630> LA<00:01:59.750> and<00:02:00.200> took<00:02:00.500> me

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:00.649 
the boat when I got to LA and took me

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:02.380 
the boat when I got to LA and took me
under<00:02:00.770> his<00:02:00.920> wing<00:02:01.189> it's<00:02:01.579> just<00:02:01.729> a<00:02:01.820> couple<00:02:02.240> years

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
under his wing it's just a couple years

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.099 
under his wing it's just a couple years
older<00:02:03.340> but<00:02:04.340> um<00:02:04.520> I<00:02:04.819> think<00:02:05.479> again<00:02:05.659> was<00:02:05.840> a<00:02:05.869> very

00:02:06.099 --> 00:02:06.109 
older but um I think again was a very

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
older but um I think again was a very
inspired<00:02:06.789> casting<00:02:07.789> choice<00:02:08.470> not<00:02:09.470> just<00:02:09.769> because

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:10.129 
inspired casting choice not just because

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:12.369 
inspired casting choice not just because
he's<00:02:10.340> on<00:02:10.519> everyone's<00:02:10.940> lips<00:02:11.599> and<00:02:11.840> minds<00:02:11.989> again

he's on everyone's lips and minds again

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:15.250 
he's on everyone's lips and minds again
you<00:02:12.769> know<00:02:12.950> for<00:02:13.220> reasons<00:02:14.000> obvious<00:02:14.840> with<00:02:15.080> this

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
you know for reasons obvious with this

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.250 
you know for reasons obvious with this
show<00:02:16.000> but<00:02:17.000> also<00:02:17.150> that<00:02:17.510> he's<00:02:17.720> just<00:02:17.989> he<00:02:18.230> really

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
show but also that he's just he really

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.400 
show but also that he's just he really
is<00:02:18.620> a<00:02:18.650> bit<00:02:18.860> of<00:02:18.950> an<00:02:19.040> American<00:02:19.489> treasure<00:02:19.730> and

is a bit of an American treasure and

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.550 
is a bit of an American treasure and
I've<00:02:21.410> certainly<00:02:22.420> borrowed<00:02:23.420> from<00:02:24.019> his<00:02:24.260> style

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:30.270 
I've certainly borrowed from his style
more<00:02:25.130> than<00:02:25.340> a<00:02:25.400> few<00:02:25.579> times<00:02:25.819> over<00:02:26.060> the<00:02:26.239> years

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.670 

it's<00:02:30.850> a<00:02:31.000> global<00:02:31.480> property<00:02:32.110> really<00:02:32.440> and<00:02:32.590> I

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
it's a global property really and I

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.010 
it's a global property really and I
think<00:02:32.920> it<00:02:33.070> was<00:02:33.310> the<00:02:34.000> responsible<00:02:34.570> thing<00:02:34.750> to<00:02:34.870> do

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
think it was the responsible thing to do

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:36.480 
think it was the responsible thing to do
is<00:02:35.230> to<00:02:35.410> branch<00:02:35.740> out<00:02:35.890> and<00:02:36.010> do<00:02:36.100> stuff<00:02:36.280> there's

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:36.490 
is to branch out and do stuff there's

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:38.430 
is to branch out and do stuff there's
also<00:02:36.640> something<00:02:36.910> much<00:02:37.120> more<00:02:37.330> authentic<00:02:38.110> about

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
also something much more authentic about

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.740 
also something much more authentic about
when<00:02:39.190> there's<00:02:39.550> not<00:02:39.700> just<00:02:39.730> a<00:02:40.030> felt<00:02:40.300> sense<00:02:40.570> of

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
when there's not just a felt sense of

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.060 
when there's not just a felt sense of
somewhere<00:02:41.110> but<00:02:41.350> okay<00:02:41.710> they're<00:02:41.920> there<00:02:42.510> and<00:02:44.070> I'm

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.070 
somewhere but okay they're there and I'm

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.010 
somewhere but okay they're there and I'm
certainly<00:02:45.550> glad<00:02:45.700> it<00:02:45.880> happened<00:02:46.030> and<00:02:46.420> it<00:02:46.750> seems

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
certainly glad it happened and it seems

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.150 
certainly glad it happened and it seems
like<00:02:47.140> it's<00:02:47.290> really<00:02:47.350> adding<00:02:47.890> to<00:02:47.920> the<00:02:48.130> overall

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
like it's really adding to the overall

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:53.320 
like it's really adding to the overall
scope<00:02:48.820> of<00:02:49.000> the<00:02:49.060> thing

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.090 

he's<00:02:53.660> just<00:02:53.810> really<00:02:53.960> smart<00:02:54.380> and<00:02:54.680> he<00:02:54.800> thinks

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100 
he's just really smart and he thinks

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.300 
he's just really smart and he thinks
stuff<00:02:55.310> through<00:02:55.610> I<00:02:56.620> remember<00:02:57.620> sometimes<00:02:57.860> the

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
stuff through I remember sometimes the

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:59.860 
stuff through I remember sometimes the
joy<00:02:58.490> of<00:02:58.520> things<00:02:58.910> was<00:02:59.120> we<00:02:59.300> are<00:02:59.330> kind<00:02:59.750> of

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
joy of things was we are kind of

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.630 
joy of things was we are kind of
creating<00:03:00.320> things<00:03:00.500> as<00:03:00.740> we<00:03:00.890> went<00:03:01.100> along<00:03:01.190> or

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
creating things as we went along or

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.250 
creating things as we went along or
within<00:03:01.820> the<00:03:01.970> context<00:03:02.450> the<00:03:02.600> story<00:03:02.870> we<00:03:03.110> were

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
within the context the story we were

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:04.840 
within the context the story we were
really<00:03:03.440> figuring<00:03:03.830> out<00:03:03.950> what<00:03:04.130> frequency

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
really figuring out what frequency

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.060 
really figuring out what frequency
should<00:03:05.090> the<00:03:05.240> scene<00:03:05.510> be<00:03:05.750> and<00:03:05.990> Josh<00:03:06.650> tends<00:03:06.920> to

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.070 
should the scene be and Josh tends to

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:08.830 
should the scene be and Josh tends to
already<00:03:07.340> be<00:03:07.430> a<00:03:07.580> couple<00:03:07.970> of<00:03:08.060> steps<00:03:08.360> along<00:03:08.510> in

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
already be a couple of steps along in

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.080 
already be a couple of steps along in
that<00:03:08.960> process<00:03:09.020> which<00:03:09.740> occasionally<00:03:10.700> can<00:03:10.970> make

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
that process which occasionally can make

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.810 
that process which occasionally can make
you<00:03:11.210> feel<00:03:11.420> like<00:03:11.840> like<00:03:12.800> oh<00:03:12.980> well<00:03:13.310> what<00:03:13.580> am<00:03:13.670> i

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:13.820 
you feel like like oh well what am i

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:15.340 
you feel like like oh well what am i
bringing<00:03:13.880> but<00:03:14.330> there's<00:03:14.510> always<00:03:14.630> other<00:03:14.990> steps

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
bringing but there's always other steps

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:20.860 
bringing but there's always other steps
that<00:03:15.560> can<00:03:15.710> go<00:03:15.920> and<00:03:16.330> so<00:03:18.310> it<00:03:19.310> makes<00:03:19.670> it<00:03:19.850> easier<00:03:20.390> to

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
that can go and so it makes it easier to

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.120 
that can go and so it makes it easier to
get<00:03:21.020> to<00:03:21.140> the<00:03:21.260> best<00:03:21.470> version<00:03:21.830> of<00:03:21.920> something

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
get to the best version of something

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:23.950 
get to the best version of something
because<00:03:22.430> he's<00:03:22.790> practically<00:03:23.480> there<00:03:23.660> already

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:23.960 
because he's practically there already

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.710 
because he's practically there already
most<00:03:24.320> of<00:03:24.440> the<00:03:24.530> time
