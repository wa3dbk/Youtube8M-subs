00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.809

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.750
 My cousin from Japan then talk to me. 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:16.350

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:22.650
 speaking little of them to her ending 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:25.740
 some to try is and say what 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:29.070
 I think these products are relatively 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.810
 the market we will say if I have 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.510
 multinational corporation that 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.510
 call to see some of you go 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:39.719
 To know here in Brazil is very little. 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.120
 known let's say but in japan he 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.730
 it is already so popular is not so much in the 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:50.039
 How are you in the United States? 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:53.430
 It's in Brazil, it was sixteen points. 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:56.340
 I have here some of them which is kind 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:01:02.100
 an energy drink, let's say the 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:03.329
 monavie some sheik to prepare and 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:09.630
 such 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:13.890
 cereal bars and juice is a good uncle 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:16.799
 Big has letters from the woman and also the 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.080
 products are all below fruit and 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.790
 mainly on the basis of the fruit 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.630
 We Brazilians already know a lot 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:27.810
 that the aÃ§aÃ­ are are totally products 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.070
 that will help your health and 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.619
 in well-being, right? 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.420
 it 's not that thing that makes gym goes 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.130
 take the monavie projects nor 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.600
 You do not even have to cut it. 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.420
 or you want to have a feed 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.100
 healthier you resort to producing 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.399
 see for those who like to have a 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.530
 well balanced feed is cobain is 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.520
 consuming natural products they are 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.040
 great 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.530
 the great differential of the company is 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.540
 how the products are distributed 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.909
 the products are distributed in a 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:00.539
 of modern business you enter 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:03.090
 the company invests a certain amount 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:06.000
 they will give you a certain amount of 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.710
 products that is so pretty here goes 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.370
 to do with these products that they 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:14.250
 They will help you sell or will you go is 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.810
 consume alone but left five 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.410
 national commissions will suffer 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:22.260
 because it is the purpose of this mode of 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.000
 distribution is you calling more 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.760
 people for your business 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.150
 so what you do you're down 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:33.360
 the company buys its part of the module there 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.079
 live to say there you catch another flame 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.610
 person 

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:37.980
 that other person will enter the 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.470
 company for you too and make it 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.390
 part of your team and so on. 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.030
 then you can call other 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.129
 as many people as you want and 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.629
 is also and selling or consuming 

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:50.849
 products alone 

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:53.760
 the more people you call to 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:56.700
 This business is better because of you. 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:59.160
 will be kind all right credit how much 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.209
 the more people you call the more money 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.970
 you will win 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:04.170
 if you win company giveaways in 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.530
 money 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:09.209
 who does not want poison also wants you 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:12.209
 You can make a mistake because you want a friend. 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:15.239
 familiar for what it was that you're going 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:16.980
 earn commission on top of that 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:21.359
 of that person consuming these products 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:23.430
 on top of it is entering the business 

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:25.500
 also she will not need to pay 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.239
 everything will have anything to anyone goin to 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.970
 person will win because the company she 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:32.040
 come to her she's going to win the kind 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.470
 company becoming popularizing let's say 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.359
 more and you and the company does not 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.669
 earn it 

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:41.220
 I will not speak to any players in the video 

00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:44.160
 because I'm not behind as soon as 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:46.889
 explain a man about it here in the 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:49.260
 link of this video I'll leave the link 

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:50.730
 another video that is where my cousin 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.340
 Jennifer, who is already in that 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.889
 business explains right how you do 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:58.200
 to participate what you want a 

00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:59.660
 video medium long but she has a girl 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.510
 beautiful then it is 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:03.890
 Let's listen and she explains it well. 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:05.810
 so it's like I said 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:08.270
 You'll call people and you'll 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:11.330
 winning more and more with that said 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:14.300
 you receive the products you consume or 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:16.250
 So you sell it, it's there, it's you. 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:18.920
 earning money from it 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:21.500
 When I said the values were not 

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:22.580
 a video that Jennifer, my cousin 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.800
 explains 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:26.420
 Then you ask, in the area I want 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.910
 participate as I do 

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:30.350
 There you go and talk to my 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:31.640
 also press that it will take all 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:33.590

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:41.840
 any doubt, talk to her, and if 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:44.090
 by chance I wanted to find the 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.830
 products to experiment with or just 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:47.750

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:49.340

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:51.470

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:54.830
 she told me that from now 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:57.950
 Try it and I loved it very much 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:05:00.110
 Good, I fucking liked it, and that 's it. 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:03.260
 This is what I'm going to make a video for. 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:05.720
 also encourage and show you 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:08.300

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:10.400
 very high quality and healthy because 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:11.750
 so I like to eat fast food the 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.510
 I like to eat something I do not

 Lend me but I also worry about the 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:18.770
 My food worries me with 

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:21.590
 my health so I always buy 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:22.970
 natural products and I always go sometimes 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:25.430

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:28.250

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:43.870
