 ready and sling yes okay there I have 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:12.660
 I've been a stranger recently 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:14.759
 must you bois winkler 321 should warmly 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:25.500
 Welcome format additive which the 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:27.740
 we only climb for you in the 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.740
 was out 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.360
 pass by red here 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:47.550
 but I'm the first one to stop, I say 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:48.600
 times it stops so 2000 runs jato 1 game 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.379
 again power so we have to 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.930
 equal to really get through to 25 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.469
 compact compact why right 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.469
 is bad 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:05.760
 I tie service super cool 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.710
 super horny we here the first round 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.689
 again very short noticeable 900 tickets 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.460
 but this is a server where others too 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.600
 maps are in there but of course we have 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:17.250
 luck just that it almost completely 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:22.650
 finished is measured schwabe length degrees 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:27.200
 was criminal i did not have the time 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.200
 if you have eternity with you 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:33.259
 why do not they even go why? 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:37.229
 again I do not have a bell sign 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:39.050
 as number 1 runs here every snapple 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.210
 had behind it really felt 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.860
 it was going on again he is behind me 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:54.080
 and managed to kill me 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:55.760
 he comes in when she's from behind me 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.260
 just had the bad start because 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.970
 i had no ingame sound whatsoever 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:12.620
 I did not find my one on the 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:14.270
 to swallow the wheel with the dgb spd only 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.700
 top nothing the house is not out so me 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.500
 I have never played. I have 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:28.010
 no single essay on that 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:30.230
 I've been awake you're done again 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.120
 Blue onesie by the 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:36.080
 territory 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:37.430
 but that is blue yes that may be yes 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.430
 but now it's back on it 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.800
 ok so I have the setup now 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.880
 Here rather the mp 7 with muffler where 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:49.970
 you remove it 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:58.070
 not even a breath I was even 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:03:08.090
 I do not have a guy with the mask 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:10.100
 the man with the mask is so i have 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:25.600
 an irony shield when playing streams 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:28.640
 actually doing the whole thing 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.709
 had so many claims for my deep 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.000
 Me too and we've had that before 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:33.110
 There are also a few things that 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.030
 already been demanded as 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:37.030
 for example, fuck fuck but fuck 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:47.560
 It's easy but I still have it 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:47.560
 not taken care of 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.190
 I come the pwr in battlefield 3 too 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:02.900
 not really clear but I have mine 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:06.050
 let say of our pro players 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:14.510
 watch that the weapon totally cool 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:27.200
 so should be the episode of the hammer 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:28.820
 but at least I never say that on 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.010
 to get second weapon but I had 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:42.440
 Also in the back of my mind that I have the g 17 c 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:42.890
 this is actually short round crisp 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:53.539
 round 

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:56.330
 Round but really for that is one 

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:57.830
 a bit longer that was an exciting one 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.870
 Round says stop and I will 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:01.490
 Remember your suggestion again 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:06.770
 I do not use the setup in the title 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:08.390
 thank you so much for this 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:13.910
 this episode will be called a chimpanzee 

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:15.800
 killed two times you have with me with me 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:18.050

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:20.030
