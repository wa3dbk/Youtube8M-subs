00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.700
 hello gemma youtuber welcome 

00:00:01.079 --> 00:00:06.330
 again to my channel we continue with the 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:09.059
 mini cooper assembly tutorial 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:12.240
 x 250 mini we already have it practically 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.980
 armed only we need to mount the 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.220
 flight controller in this video les 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.529
 I will teach how to connect all 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.510
 cables to this mini controller before 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.269
 install it since in the next video 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:27.689
 I will show you how to configure it then 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:31.080
 it is very important to know that he is the 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:34.410
 mini controller that reference acs 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.750
 3d has an arrow up here 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.820
 arrow we should always identify it and 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.460
 should be pointing towards the direction in the 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.680
 that will go the quad counter in this case 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.690
 we said that this was not this was our 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.210
 tail and that was our forehead so he 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.390
 should go in this direction although by 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:54.000
 programming by mistake we ride from 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.460
 another way this because of our 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.250
 wiring by programming can be 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.760
 indicate which side I can make you 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.170
 90 degree turn programming but in 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.270
 this case we are not going to do that 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.780
 we're just going to ride it in 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.420
 sense 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.850
 indicates the arrow forward and here 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.860
 the most important connectors that 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.890
 we must keep in mind are these that 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.409
 they are here that are numbered from 1 to 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:24.000
 6 we are only going to use 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:27.800
 from 1 to 4 for each engine in the 1 lower 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.800
 the engine 1 that is here 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:34.680
 the 2 is the engine that goes here the 3 is 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.900
 this engine and the 4 is this engine as you see 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.440
 in the image that I am showing there in 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.440
 screen 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:46.650
 considering that in that order 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:50.070
 we connect the cables then this one that 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:53.400
 corresponds to 1 goes this way 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.740
 remember that black is earth and 1 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:58.020
 it's a sign and here we can see a card 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:03.000
 that is not indicating that the one that was 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:05.550
 more here is positive ground and signal there 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.410
 three cables three personal connectors 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:09.930
 sorry but these controllers 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:12.450
 it only has two and it's because there 

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:15.270
 other type of motor controllers 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.760
 that come like this with three wires per 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:21.000
 example this other that is of another type 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:24.290
 against another manufacturer are very good 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:28.590
 it also has the advantage that it has 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:31.040
 earth plus 5 volts and signal is to say 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.850
 that I can feed the card 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:36.590
 controller with one of these 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.590
 motor controllers 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.819
 in this case that those controllers of 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.610
 motors only have two cables 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:49.010
 I have to draw from another side of another 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.830
 form the 5 volts to power this 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.989
 flight controller and that's why I made this 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:56.329
 another connection that I had already shown you 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:58.370
 in previous videos of this I'm going to 

00:02:56.329 --> 00:03:00.550
 use as a feed here I have 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:03.240
 marked my land 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:07.120
 what is this then we can for example 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:09.760
 go connecting this so it would be like a 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:12.700
 example but then it will disconnect 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:15.850
 to assemble what you see 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.710
 simply here would go the 1 we look for the 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:20.610
 2 cable 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:20.610
 I wanted here 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:26.110
 and so on until the fourth 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:28.330
 engine and then feeding another 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:30.280
 very important connector of this 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:32.620
 Flight controller is the one we have 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:35.980
 here on the left here where is it going to 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:38.640
 enter the signal of the remote control and 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:41.920
 then from top to bottom 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.940
 we have as we can see in this cable 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.760
 what's here 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:48.510
 this is the cable that goes here connects 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.510
 thus 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:56.870
 this usually comes with cables 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:04:00.739
 colors indicating the first one that is 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:02.569
 earth the second is plus 5 with which 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:04.790
 is going to power the remote control 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:08.690
 sorry the remote control receiver and 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:12.050
 then follow the channels of each of the 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:13.400
 remote control either lifting twist of 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:15.410
 power and the rest 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:18.590
 we basically need both of 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:20.840
 land and food and four others are 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:23.360
 they use and suddenly if we are going to use 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:24.919
 a gear lever we use 5 and 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.110
 the others that are left over we can leave 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:29.840
 offline or just bring the 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:31.130
 remote control also what you have to 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.800
 see with the connection to the control 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:35.840
 remote will be shown later will be 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:39.380
 a chapter solely dedicated to 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:41.720
 remote control then I will proceed to 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:44.000
 mount the controller and wire it 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:46.270
 so you can see how to get down to 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.270
 final 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:56.500
 Well, I've just put together the controller 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:59.140
 of flight is already completely wired 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:02.680
 as I said this cable here is the 

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:06.040
 that goes to the radio control receiver the 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:09.370
 remote control that is down here on the day 

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:11.980
 come back here like this if we can tire 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:14.470
 see I came here or here and go down here 

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:18.210
 down where is the radio module 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:20.200
 control the cables that are on this side 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:26.169
 correspond to each of the engines 

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:29.169
 counting between 1 to 4 that is 1 2 3 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:31.150
 4 I'm watching the rear is 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:32.500
 the front one two three four 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:34.480
 they go in that order 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:36.790
 one two three four taking the arrow 

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:40.930
 forward and then feeding 

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:42.970
 that are 5 volts that I took it from the place 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:46.000
 of distribution of the woman then 

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:47.350
 is correctly all connected and they 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.440
 I will recommend that before 

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:52.030
 arm all this as I did not know 

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:54.850
 will you forget that I am 

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:56.439
 forgot to put it right you're 

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:59.840
 correct are 

00:05:56.439 --> 00:06:02.689
 double-sided adhesives as you can see 

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:05.270
 here this helps hold the battery and 

00:06:02.689 --> 00:06:10.210
 also the battery we should put 

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:12.919
 these stickers to increase also 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:15.800
 reduce the risk of dropping the 

00:06:12.919 --> 00:06:18.650
 battery and that we run out of energy 

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:23.110
 on the flight it is practically ready 

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:26.090
 the copper quad only continues and is missing 

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:28.129
 check the driver software 

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:29.569
 flight that we'll see in the next 

00:06:28.129 --> 00:06:31.909
 video that basically is the 

00:06:29.569 --> 00:06:34.310
 flight controller configuration 

00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:36.740
 it's about that it's very easy 

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:40.330
 we just connect here has a 

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:43.039
 usb connector connect to the computer 

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:45.439
 we download the software and it will take us 

00:06:43.039 --> 00:06:48.800
 step by step through the options of 

00:06:45.439 --> 00:06:51.199
 configuration to to configure this 

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:53.240
 drone is mostly perceived do not forget 

00:06:51.199 --> 00:06:55.279
 subscribe to my channel and share the 

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:57.879
 video and be aware of the following 

00:06:55.279 --> 00:06:57.879
 tutorial
