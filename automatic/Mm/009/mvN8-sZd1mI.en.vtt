because of rust and stuff so patching it
up<00:00:20.910> cleaning<00:00:21.510> it<00:00:21.630> up<00:00:21.779> and<00:00:22.619> now<00:00:22.859> I'm<00:00:23.070> starting

on<00:00:23.670> working<00:00:24.449> on<00:00:24.539> some<00:00:24.779> gussets<00:00:25.320> for<00:00:25.949> these

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:27.199 
on working on some gussets for these

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:30.019 
on working on some gussets for these
four<00:00:28.199> link<00:00:28.439> mounts<00:00:28.859> gonna<00:00:29.460> gusset<00:00:29.880> these

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
four link mounts gonna gusset these

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.770 
four link mounts gonna gusset these
uppers<00:00:30.449> up<00:00:30.689> and<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.679> lowers<00:00:32.009> -<00:00:32.279> and<00:00:32.940> what's

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
uppers up and the lowers - and what's

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.990 
uppers up and the lowers - and what's
the<00:00:33.899> purpose<00:00:34.230> of<00:00:34.350> your<00:00:34.530> gusset<00:00:34.710> kinds<00:00:35.219> of<00:00:35.370> well

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
the purpose of your gusset kinds of well

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.979 
the purpose of your gusset kinds of well
the<00:00:36.239> idea<00:00:36.600> is<00:00:36.780> if<00:00:37.850> this<00:00:38.850> stuff<00:00:39.239> tweaks<00:00:39.629> that

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
the idea is if this stuff tweaks that

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.500 
the idea is if this stuff tweaks that
lets<00:00:40.680> your<00:00:40.770> axle<00:00:41.160> just<00:00:41.399> walk<00:00:41.700> all<00:00:42.000> over<00:00:42.030> the

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
lets your axle just walk all over the

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.260 
lets your axle just walk all over the
place<00:00:42.950> send<00:00:43.950> in<00:00:44.070> your<00:00:44.160> car<00:00:44.399> all<00:00:44.640> over<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.059> road

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
place send in your car all over the road

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.029 
place send in your car all over the road
so<00:00:45.719> we're<00:00:46.140> gonna<00:00:46.230> try<00:00:46.469> to<00:00:46.530> prevent<00:00:46.860> that

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
so we're gonna try to prevent that

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.830 
so we're gonna try to prevent that
because<00:00:47.610> this<00:00:47.820> cars<00:00:48.090> gonna<00:00:48.300> be<00:00:48.420> getting<00:00:48.660> some

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
because this cars gonna be getting some

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.560 
because this cars gonna be getting some
serious<00:00:48.989> pop<00:00:49.350> just<00:00:49.950> lower<00:00:50.190> mount<00:00:50.520> here<00:00:50.850> which

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
right that's just one vertical piece of

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.020 
right that's just one vertical piece of
steel<00:00:55.590> welded<00:00:56.039> into<00:00:56.190> there<00:00:56.430> yeah<00:00:56.730> and<00:00:56.940> it

put something in that is to kind of get
something<00:01:10.670> triangulating<00:01:11.670> all<00:01:12.119> this

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:13.580 
something triangulating all this

exhausts and everything else that's got

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.710 
exhausts and everything else that's got
to<00:01:37.229> go<00:01:37.320> through<00:01:37.619> there<00:01:38.000> we're<00:01:39.000> gonna<00:01:39.090> work<00:01:39.540> on

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
to go through there we're gonna work on

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.780 
to go through there we're gonna work on
some<00:01:39.750> structure<00:01:40.439> to<00:01:40.470> tie<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:41.310> two<00:01:41.490> sides

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
some structure to tie the the two sides

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.880 
some structure to tie the the two sides
of<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.030> frame<00:01:42.270> together<00:01:42.450> what<00:01:43.140> exactly<00:01:43.170> not

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
of the frame together what exactly not

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.550 
of the frame together what exactly not
entirely<00:01:44.159> sure<00:01:44.310> right<00:01:44.640> now<00:01:44.820> but<00:01:45.560> we're

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
entirely sure right now but we're

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.840 
entirely sure right now but we're
planning<00:01:46.920> on<00:01:47.040> it<00:01:47.189> because<00:01:47.520> these<00:01:47.640> non

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
planning on it because these non

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.179 
planning on it because these non
convertible<00:01:48.450> frames<00:01:48.689> are<00:01:49.380> pretty<00:01:49.649> flimsy<00:01:49.890> if

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
convertible frames are pretty flimsy if

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.460 
convertible frames are pretty flimsy if
you<00:01:50.280> look<00:01:50.430> at<00:01:50.610> them<00:01:50.729> yeah<00:01:51.270> you<00:01:51.299> you<00:01:51.840> lose<00:01:52.110> a<00:01:52.170> lot

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
you look at them yeah you you lose a lot

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.950 
you look at them yeah you you lose a lot
of<00:01:52.500> strength<00:01:53.360> between<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.479> convertible

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
of strength between the convertible

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.929 
of strength between the convertible
frames<00:01:55.290> and<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:55.829> heart<00:01:56.009> out<00:01:56.219> frames<00:01:56.549> just

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
frames and the heart out frames just

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.330 
frames and the heart out frames just
because<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:58.140> convertible<00:01:58.680> frames<00:01:59.009> are<00:01:59.189> all

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
because the convertible frames are all

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.340 
because the convertible frames are all
boxed<00:01:59.850> in<00:02:00.000> here<00:02:00.329> and<00:02:00.450> this<00:02:00.570> is<00:02:00.719> all<00:02:00.869> open<00:02:01.049> on

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
boxed in here and this is all open on

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.580 
boxed in here and this is all open on
our<00:02:01.380> hardtop<00:02:02.250> very<00:02:03.180> interesting<00:02:03.689> well<00:02:04.560> I

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
our hardtop very interesting well I

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:05.840 
our hardtop very interesting well I
think<00:02:04.740> Nick<00:02:05.070> is<00:02:05.219> working<00:02:05.520> on<00:02:05.640> some
