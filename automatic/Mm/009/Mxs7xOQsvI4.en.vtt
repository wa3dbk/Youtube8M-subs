00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:07.190
 hello in this video we're going to show you 

00:00:03.509 --> 00:00:09.950
 make a carved cake of the poussin cat 

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:13.340
 we have used two 20 x molds 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:17.060
 30 centimeters and we will use two biscuits 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:19.430
 of 600 grams of flour each 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:21.890
 we remove the top part to each 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:24.939
 cake and place one on top of the other 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.939
 thus 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:33.050
 then we put this oval mold made 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:36.250
 turn butter on the cake 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.250
 and we started cutting 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.210
 to start we're just going to cut the 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.210
 mold shape 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:59.430
 then we round up and we give it shape 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:59.430
 for that we are guided by an image 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:23.620
 the part of the face should be more 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.620
 flat and not rounded 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.200
 for the ears we take a portion of 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:33.250
 cake that we cut before and we give 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.250
 pyramid shape 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:49.140
 to fill in the first thing we separate 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.140
 the two parts and we add syrup 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.600
 then we put a little delicacy 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.600
 White 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.950
 we mix a bit of sponge cake with cream 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.920
 of butter to create a paste 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:10.030
 then we put it around the edge to 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.030
 that we are not given that mark 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.500
 we return the other cake to its place and 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:21.100
 we continue to cover this division with 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.100
 this pasta 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:34.670
 now we put the ears with a little 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.670
 butter cream 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:39.980
 and then we completely cover the 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:42.860
 sponge cake with this cream 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.930
 once we put the cream we have up to 10 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.120
 minutes to cover the past that time 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:50.180
 and start to dry and it will not stick 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:53.560
 fondant here let's put a base 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.560
 oval under the biscuit 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:02.500
 to cover ourselves we need 1.2 kilos of 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.500
 lead color fondant 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.700
 we analyze and make small tweaks and 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.950
 what's left over we cut it with a 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.730
 cortapisa to use them later in their 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.730
 legs and tail 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.750
 now let's put it on a base 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.150
 technopor lined with colored rubber paste 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.709
 stick rose we put a little bit of 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.319
 glue that is made from water 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:26.940
 with a pinch of song cometra and 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:29.350
 we put the cake on the place 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.960
 indicated 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:33.670
 for the tail we take a little fondant 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:35.320
 and we add some rubber after the 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:39.720
 edge to harden faster 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:39.720
 we form a ball and then we stretch it 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:56.800
 we put a bit of the same glue and 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.800
 we put the tail in its place 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:02.409
 for the front legs we do what 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.569
 same we take a little fondant him 

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:09.050
 we add a little rubber will bring singing and 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:12.320
 we give it shape after that we paste 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:16.019
 and with that we already finished the whole base 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:18.239
 now let's start with the details 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:20.220
 for the two spots that have the spine 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:22.199
 we stretch some rubber paste 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:25.289
 dark lead color and cut two 

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:28.520
 rectangles round the corners and 

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:28.520
 we paste them in this way 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:33.330
 likewise we make the spots of the 

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:34.889
 tail 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.159
 then we cut what's left over with a 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:37.159
 scalpel 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:54.220
 for the stains on his head 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:54.220
 We cut three strips and put them on 

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:12.869
 for the eyes we cut two small 

00:05:09.839 --> 00:05:15.989
 circles and for the mouth we cut from this 

00:05:12.869 --> 00:05:18.379
 way we use the circle cutter and 

00:05:15.989 --> 00:05:18.379
 a scalpel 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:29.349
 and for the whiskers we cut 4 strips of 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:29.349
 this form 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:39.479
 after that we put each piece in its 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:39.479
 place 

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:44.829
 now we put a horizontal ribbon 

00:05:42.399 --> 00:05:47.379
 and another vertical with pink rubber paste 

00:05:44.829 --> 00:05:49.849
 and a little bit of glue 

00:05:47.379 --> 00:05:52.819
 finally we put the tie in three 

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:55.720
 parts the two largest weigh 65 

00:05:52.819 --> 00:05:55.720
 grams each 

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:02.980
 and as glue we use a little bit of 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.980
 rubber paste mixed with water 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:10.020
 we put a cake that is also 

00:06:08.009 --> 00:06:12.280
 made with rubber paste and with that 

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:14.470
 we would finish this model 

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:17.920
