00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.560 
incredible rides I went with a nostalgia
for<00:03:44.070> myself<00:03:44.549> on<00:03:44.730> that<00:03:44.760> and<00:03:45.030> chose<00:03:45.180> pirates

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:45.570 
for myself on that and chose pirates

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:47.630 
for myself on that and chose pirates
another<00:03:45.959> really<00:03:46.799> tough<00:03:47.040> one<00:03:47.220> for<00:03:47.250> me<00:03:47.459> was

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
another really tough one for me was

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:52.370 
another really tough one for me was
choosing<00:03:48.650> Radiator<00:03:49.650> Springs<00:03:49.739> over<00:03:51.350> fantasmic

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
choosing Radiator Springs over fantasmic

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.410 
choosing Radiator Springs over fantasmic
I<00:03:52.590> mean<00:03:52.830> why<00:03:53.519> did<00:03:53.730> I<00:03:53.850> do<00:03:53.910> that

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
I mean why did I do that

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.289 
I mean why did I do that
fantasmic<00:03:55.049> brings<00:03:55.290> me<00:03:55.470> such<00:03:55.650> joy<00:03:55.680> but<00:03:56.250> also

00:03:56.289 --> 00:03:56.299 
fantasmic brings me such joy but also

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:59.300 
fantasmic brings me such joy but also
Radiator<00:03:57.299> Springs<00:03:57.769> the<00:03:58.769> feeling<00:03:59.070> I<00:03:59.130> get<00:03:59.280> when

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
Radiator Springs the feeling I get when

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.100 
Radiator Springs the feeling I get when
I<00:03:59.400> look<00:03:59.730> at<00:03:59.850> the<00:03:59.970> mountain<00:04:00.360> range<00:04:00.660> when<00:04:00.870> I'm<00:04:00.959> on

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 
I look at the mountain range when I'm on

00:04:51.809 --> 00:04:51.819 
in the entire world actually I think it

00:04:51.819 --> 00:04:53.309
