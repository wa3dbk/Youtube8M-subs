00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 Hello everyone, Sanya, and today is the corner 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:08.040
 understand that you have a broken starter 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.280
 or flew wiring for this 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:14.059
 is necessary 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:17.520
 I have a breakdown caused artificially 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:22.460
 could have been the same turn 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:24.480
 ignition nothing happens 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:29.039
 arrow voltmeter 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.369
 if I fell immediately to minus 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.780
 you 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:37.110
 him somewhere you and the end of the network either 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:40.829
 I flew a dream but a percentage now 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:45.230
 check I have collected is worth 2 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:48.890
 don't be surprised one of them i tried 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.890
 unplug relay chips 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:58.090
 courtyards collected and parallel 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.500
 Further 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:08.150
 piri flight modules for this i have 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:19.220
 Here is a bun connects to the most 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:23.870
 bottom cool that happens 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:25.660
 it means you have 101 reasons either 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:33.130
 more 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:37.250
 himself or in liner from the ignition 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:42.229
 that when the ignition switch plug this 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:47.020
 contact and this or multimeter 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:51.170
 either light bulb and turn on the ignition 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:54.740
 turn on the starter yourself if the light bulb 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:02:00.170
 lights up it means everything works 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:01.039
 the only problem is the role of dad 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.250
 said second 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:09.050
 Ivan also advise you to put 2 relays 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:14.030
 buy a chip with wires and connect 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:18.500
 Everything is parallel so that the current is already shared 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:24.350
 led him on the problem Glushakov forget 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:29.440
 forever failures and go to our group 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:29.440
