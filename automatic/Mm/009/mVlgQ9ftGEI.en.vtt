00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:11.639
 Once the video I 'm excited about Brad 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:14.910
 It's like riding up to post that's 40 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.750
 even because I had a campus team that is 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.990
 a truce 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.189
 she had to give more just appeared and she 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.029
 turned up here back 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:26.010
 The first piece there is like I said no. 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.359
 I still know this is the first game that 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.730
 counted on the same pistol 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.830
 you can not change but if you change you will be 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.809
 there inside the gnr they become that 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.980
 house he can be so on or 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.110
 underneath move 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.030
 Yeah you can see that same one that I do not 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.010

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.920

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:47.280

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.390

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.940
 I will not be cutting the video like this 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.820
 Like the way to shorten the time to 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.890
 I make the video because if I go 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.539

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.850

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.549
 They will understand my way of singing a song.

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.500

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.520

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.400
 entered that door on the table and had 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.430
 that door will have your part I'll go 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:45.299

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:47.430
 Riding her is can notice so much on this table 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.810
 as on the other Tuesday it is said that 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.540
 It's in the previous video that I was 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.119
 talking about what I did about riding the 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.219
 turbine can be on the table of the 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.860
 turbine also and if you have another table I 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:00.689
 I think you can go back there too, I'll go. 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.950
 show you now that this piece 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:06.570
 Could this piece be where it is? 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.610
 this piece right there on the same line 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:12.130
 is this piece that was now going to be 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:14.320
 here where you are very confused right? 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.450
 It is that I ended up changing place do 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.310
 what the two pieces are on top with 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.380
 sure you will locate it 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.750
 It is at least the configuration that was 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:26.320
 I do not know if it changes but if it changes it will 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:29.530
 It's in there, relax, and then just come 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:33.610
 here and put the piece back into our 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:37.450

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:40.630

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.970

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.280
