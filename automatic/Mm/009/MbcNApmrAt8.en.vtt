00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:26.780
 Give me strength, 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.360
 give me the belief 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.960
 To get back home 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:36.480
 Because I lost my soul, mom, my soul mom 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.100
 my soul mom 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.820
 I have long traveled the earth 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.260
 It's the dark night in my soul 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.740
 My path 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.600
 I have long traveled the earth 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.800
 It's the dark night in my soul 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.440
 My path 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.980
 I was looking for mom, freedom 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.400
 But I found loneliness 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.040
 My path 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.860
 I was looking for mom, freedom 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.060
 But I found loneliness 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.740
 My path 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.280
 I have long traveled the earth 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.800
 It's the dark night in my soul 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.180
 My path 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.300
 The path, my path 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.020
 The path of summer 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.940
 And as a vagabond 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.420
 I'm leaving this world 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.120
 The path, my path 

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:10.460
 The path of summer 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.100
 And as a vagabond 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.780
 I'm leaving this world 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.660
 If only I could go 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.040
 And to be able to recover my soul 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.000
 The path... 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.540
 If only I could go 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.820
 And to be able to recover my soul 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:48.600
 The path 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.980
 The path, my path 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.400
 The path of summer 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.380
 And as a vagabond 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:24.060
 I'm leaving this world 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.400
 The path, my path 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.240
 The path of summer 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:32.160
 And as a vagabond 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:36.940
 I'm leaving this world 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:47.380
 Because I lost, mom, my soul 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:03.440
 Because I lost, mom, my soul
