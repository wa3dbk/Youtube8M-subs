this is a bit with two wings on it and
it's<00:00:27.240> going<00:00:27.480> to<00:00:27.539> cut<00:00:29.240> a<00:00:30.240> slot<00:00:31.790> that<00:00:32.790> looks<00:00:33.180> like

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:34.100 
it's going to cut a slot that looks like

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.740 
it's going to cut a slot that looks like
that<00:00:35.100> you<00:00:35.489> can<00:00:35.700> see<00:00:35.880> this<00:00:36.030> one's<00:00:36.329> been<00:00:36.480> cut<00:00:36.719> on

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
that you can see this one's been cut on

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.610 
that you can see this one's been cut on
the<00:00:36.989> other<00:00:37.020> side<00:00:39.079> and<00:00:40.079> that's<00:00:40.230> what<00:00:40.410> that

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
the other side and that's what that

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.040 
the other side and that's what that
looks<00:00:40.829> like<00:00:41.010> so<00:00:41.370> we<00:00:41.520> go<00:00:42.420> ahead<00:00:42.570> and<00:00:42.719> lay<00:00:42.989> this

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
looks like so we go ahead and lay this

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.619 
looks like so we go ahead and lay this
down<00:00:44.270> and<00:00:45.270> cut<00:00:46.110> that<00:00:46.289> rabbit<00:00:47.120> I've<00:00:48.120> said<00:00:48.480> it

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
down and cut that rabbit I've said it

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.160 
down and cut that rabbit I've said it
for<00:00:49.370> about<00:00:50.370> a<00:00:50.700> quarter<00:00:51.270> of<00:00:51.300> an<00:00:51.570> inch<00:00:51.750> that's

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
for about a quarter of an inch that's

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.220 
for about a quarter of an inch that's
about<00:00:52.530> as<00:00:52.710> much<00:00:52.949> as<00:00:53.129> you<00:00:53.280> want<00:00:53.520> to<00:00:53.780> try<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:54.840> cut

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
about as much as you want to try to cut

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.439 
about as much as you want to try to cut
in<00:00:55.530> one<00:00:55.860> pass<00:00:56.190> with<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.640> router<00:00:56.879> so<00:00:57.059> if<00:00:57.300> you'll

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
in one pass with the router so if you'll

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.180 
in one pass with the router so if you'll
want<00:00:57.629> to<00:00:57.690> put<00:00:57.870> a<00:00:57.899> thicker<00:00:58.260> bottom<00:00:58.739> in<00:00:58.890> it<00:00:58.920> and

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
want to put a thicker bottom in it and

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.790 
want to put a thicker bottom in it and
you<00:00:59.670> want<00:00:59.879> that<00:01:00.059> slot<00:01:00.359> to<00:01:00.539> be<00:01:00.660> deeper<00:01:01.079> do<00:01:01.530> it<00:01:01.710> a

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
you want that slot to be deeper do it a

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.799 
you want that slot to be deeper do it a
quarter<00:01:02.160> of<00:01:02.280> an<00:01:02.430> inch<00:01:02.520> at<00:01:02.760> a<00:01:02.879> time<00:01:02.910> but<00:01:03.780> a

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
quarter of an inch at a time but a

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.560 
quarter of an inch at a time but a
quarter<00:01:04.170> of<00:01:04.260> inch<00:01:04.379> will<00:01:04.589> be<00:01:05.360> quite<00:01:06.360> sufficient

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
quarter of inch will be quite sufficient

00:01:06.570 --> 00:02:03.270 
quarter of inch will be quite sufficient
for<00:01:06.960> our<00:01:07.170> purposes<00:01:07.740> today

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:14.020 

let's<00:02:07.030> have<00:02:08.030> some<00:02:08.300> dusty<00:02:08.959> business<00:02:12.280> now<00:02:13.280> we

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
let's have some dusty business now we

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:19.509 
let's have some dusty business now we
look<00:02:14.239> at<00:02:14.360> our<00:02:14.510> depth<00:02:14.810> here<00:02:18.280> that's<00:02:19.280> a<00:02:19.489> good

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:19.519 
look at our depth here that's a good

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:22.660 
look at our depth here that's a good
depth<00:02:20.030> that's<00:02:20.959> going<00:02:21.260> to<00:02:21.349> fit<00:02:21.590> our<00:02:22.069> next<00:02:22.459> step

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
depth that's going to fit our next step

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.210 
depth that's going to fit our next step
then<00:02:22.940> is<00:02:23.150> to<00:02:23.180> make<00:02:23.569> these<00:02:24.349> corners<00:02:24.709> square

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
then is to make these corners square

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.309 
then is to make these corners square
because<00:02:25.670> since<00:02:25.940> the<00:02:26.150> bit<00:02:26.360> on<00:02:26.540> our<00:02:26.720> router<00:02:26.989> is

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
because since the bit on our router is

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:29.500 
because since the bit on our router is
round<00:02:28.069> when<00:02:28.670> you<00:02:28.819> come<00:02:29.030> around<00:02:29.120> this<00:02:29.450> corner

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
round when you come around this corner

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.680 
round when you come around this corner
it<00:02:30.080> cuts<00:02:30.560> around<00:02:30.739> corner<00:02:31.430> so<00:02:32.150> unless<00:02:32.390> you<00:02:32.540> want

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
it cuts around corner so unless you want

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.150 
it cuts around corner so unless you want
to<00:02:32.750> go<00:02:32.870> through<00:02:33.080> all<00:02:33.200> the<00:02:33.319> trouble<00:02:33.739> of<00:02:33.829> trying

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
to go through all the trouble of trying

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.250 
to go through all the trouble of trying
to<00:02:34.220> make<00:02:34.459> these<00:02:34.670> corners<00:02:35.030> exactly<00:02:35.870> the<00:02:36.019> same

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
to make these corners exactly the same

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.280 
to make these corners exactly the same
shape<00:02:36.560> as<00:02:36.799> this<00:02:37.040> the<00:02:37.730> easiest<00:02:38.090> way<00:02:38.390> is<00:02:38.690> to<00:02:38.900> grab

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
shape as this the easiest way is to grab

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:40.960 
shape as this the easiest way is to grab
your<00:02:39.530> chisel<00:02:39.920> and<00:02:40.069> make<00:02:40.430> these<00:02:40.670> corners

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
your chisel and make these corners

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.089 
your chisel and make these corners
square<00:02:41.510> and<00:02:41.989> I'll<00:02:42.110> show<00:02:42.319> you<00:02:42.380> how<00:02:42.560> we're<00:02:42.950> doing

00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:43.099 
square and I'll show you how we're doing

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:47.800 
square and I'll show you how we're doing
to<00:02:43.310> do<00:02:43.400> that<00:02:45.670> we've<00:02:46.670> got<00:02:46.790> our<00:02:46.910> trusty<00:02:47.180> chisel

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
to do that we've got our trusty chisel

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.190 
to do that we've got our trusty chisel
it<00:02:48.250> should<00:02:49.250> be<00:02:49.400> pretty<00:02:49.640> good<00:02:49.730> and<00:02:50.060> sharp<00:02:50.299> test

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
it should be pretty good and sharp test

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.380 
it should be pretty good and sharp test
it<00:02:51.349> against<00:02:51.739> your<00:02:51.860> thumbnail<00:02:52.370> if<00:02:52.579> it<00:02:53.060> sticks

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
it against your thumbnail if it sticks

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.560 
it against your thumbnail if it sticks
it's<00:02:53.660> sharp<00:02:53.930> enough<00:02:54.049> to<00:02:54.260> go
