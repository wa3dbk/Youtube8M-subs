00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.730 
and I figured by putting the two
together<00:02:39.780> we'd<00:02:40.780> get<00:02:40.990> the<00:02:41.110> lift<00:02:41.320> and<00:02:41.500> price

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:41.740 
together we'd get the lift and price

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:43.590 
together we'd get the lift and price
that<00:02:41.770> I<00:02:42.010> spoke<00:02:42.250> about<00:02:42.310> getting<00:02:42.940> a<00:02:43.030> triple<00:02:43.270> in<00:02:43.510> a

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
that I spoke about getting a triple in a

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.230 
that I spoke about getting a triple in a
share<00:02:43.840> price<00:02:43.960> so<00:02:44.860> right<00:02:45.850> now<00:02:46.710> disappointing

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
share price so right now disappointing

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:53.130 
share price so right now disappointing
numbers<00:02:49.240> from<00:02:49.870> the<00:02:50.110> majors<00:02:50.740> you<00:02:51.640> have<00:02:51.970> and<00:02:52.930> you

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
numbers from the majors you have and you

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.140 
numbers from the majors you have and you
say<00:02:53.320> well<00:02:53.500> why<00:02:53.770> is<00:02:53.830> that<00:02:54.040> one<00:02:54.610> might<00:02:54.820> be<00:02:55.000> the

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
say well why is that one might be the

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.860 
say well why is that one might be the
ETF<00:02:56.430> cannibalizing<00:02:57.430> part<00:02:58.090> of<00:02:58.210> the<00:02:58.270> market<00:02:58.630> if

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
ETF cannibalizing part of the market if

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:59.940 
ETF cannibalizing part of the market if
you<00:02:59.050> took<00:02:59.200> all<00:02:59.350> the<00:02:59.470> money<00:02:59.590> that<00:02:59.650> went<00:02:59.860> into

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
you took all the money that went into

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.030 
you took all the money that went into
the<00:03:00.190> ETF<00:03:00.550> and<00:03:00.940> pushed<00:03:01.240> it<00:03:01.420> back<00:03:01.739> into<00:03:02.739> the

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
the ETF and pushed it back into the

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.270 
the ETF and pushed it back into the
market<00:03:03.400> you'd<00:03:04.239> double<00:03:04.540> the<00:03:04.630> share<00:03:04.780> prices

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
market you'd double the share prices

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.300 
market you'd double the share prices
because<00:03:06.280> the<00:03:06.489> ETF<00:03:06.880> right<00:03:07.090> now<00:03:07.270> the<00:03:07.690> ETF

it's<00:03:18.610> huge<00:03:19.150> the<00:03:19.930> the<00:03:20.200> ETF<00:03:20.680> was<00:03:20.920> created<00:03:21.550> by<00:03:22.090> the

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
it's huge the the ETF was created by the

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.510 
it's huge the the ETF was created by the
World<00:03:22.420> Gold<00:03:22.660> Council<00:03:22.810> which<00:03:23.709> were<00:03:23.980> all<00:03:24.250> the

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:24.520 
World Gold Council which were all the

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.600 
World Gold Council which were all the
senior<00:03:24.790> gold<00:03:25.000> stocks<00:03:25.300> that<00:03:25.540> hedged<00:03:25.840> gold<00:03:26.610> to

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
senior gold stocks that hedged gold to

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.820 
senior gold stocks that hedged gold to
stabilize<00:03:28.360> the<00:03:28.510> gold<00:03:28.690> market<00:03:28.870> they<00:03:29.530> wanted<00:03:29.769> to

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:29.830 
stabilize the gold market they wanted to

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:32.100 
stabilize the gold market they wanted to
add<00:03:29.980> eight<00:03:30.400> for<00:03:30.760> ten<00:03:30.940> dollars<00:03:31.330> and<00:03:31.959> they

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110 
add eight for ten dollars and they

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.590 
add eight for ten dollars and they
thought<00:03:32.260> the<00:03:32.440> ETF<00:03:32.920> would<00:03:33.130> do<00:03:33.250> that<00:03:33.400> the<00:03:34.180> ETF

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
thought the ETF would do that the ETF

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:38.729 
thought the ETF would do that the ETF
has<00:03:34.780> had<00:03:34.930> them<00:03:35.080> for<00:03:35.260> lunch<00:03:35.290> and<00:03:36.780> has<00:03:37.780> it's<00:03:38.560> an

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739 
has had them for lunch and has it's an

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:42.730 
has had them for lunch and has it's an
easier<00:03:39.160> way<00:03:39.340> to<00:03:39.370> buy<00:03:40.620> so

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:42.740 
easier way to buy so

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:45.610 
easier way to buy so
what<00:03:43.550> I<00:03:43.580> think<00:03:43.940> if<00:03:44.240> the<00:03:44.690> major<00:03:44.870> started<00:03:45.410> paying

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
what I think if the major started paying

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.980 
what I think if the major started paying
more<00:03:45.740> in<00:03:46.250> dividends<00:03:46.850> so<00:03:47.270> increasing<00:03:47.840> their

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:47.990 
more in dividends so increasing their

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:53.500 
more in dividends so increasing their
yield<00:03:48.260> they<00:03:48.920> attract<00:03:49.670> a<00:03:50.000> larger<00:03:50.600> audience<00:03:52.510> but

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
yield they attract a larger audience but

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:57.030 
yield they attract a larger audience but
we're<00:03:53.690> also<00:03:53.870> looking<00:03:54.230> at<00:03:54.500> a<00:03:54.590> point<00:03:54.800> where<00:03:55.330> the

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
we're also looking at a point where the

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.890 
we're also looking at a point where the
senior<00:03:58.040> gold<00:03:58.190> stocks<00:03:58.460> relative<00:03:59.000> to<00:03:59.120> gold<00:03:59.300> are

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
senior gold stocks relative to gold are

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:05.770 
senior gold stocks relative to gold are
trading<00:04:00.800> at<00:04:00.950> a<00:04:00.980> level<00:04:03.550> unknown<00:04:04.550> in<00:04:05.420> the<00:04:05.570> last

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780 
trading at a level unknown in the last

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.980 
trading at a level unknown in the last
28<00:04:06.170> years<00:04:06.310> it's<00:04:07.310> way<00:04:07.700> down<00:04:08.000> there<00:04:08.060> so<00:04:08.840> I<00:04:08.870> think

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:08.990 
28 years it's way down there so I think

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:11.980 
28 years it's way down there so I think
it's<00:04:09.490> in<00:04:10.490> the<00:04:10.580> course<00:04:10.760> of<00:04:10.910> this<00:04:11.000> year<00:04:11.060> if<00:04:11.840> you

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:11.990 
it's in the course of this year if you

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:15.310 
it's in the course of this year if you
go<00:04:12.110> long<00:04:12.350> gold<00:04:12.740> stocks<00:04:13.120> you're<00:04:14.120> it's<00:04:14.930> a<00:04:15.080> better

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:15.320 
go long gold stocks you're it's a better

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:18.190 
go long gold stocks you're it's a better
value<00:04:15.920> investment<00:04:16.730> than<00:04:17.330> buying<00:04:17.570> gold<00:04:17.900> right

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:18.200 
value investment than buying gold right

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.220 
value investment than buying gold right
now<00:04:18.380> because<00:04:19.190> on<00:04:19.760> a<00:04:19.820> relative<00:04:20.239> basis<00:04:20.570> so<00:04:21.050> much

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:21.230 
now because on a relative basis so much

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:23.530 
now because on a relative basis so much
cheaper
