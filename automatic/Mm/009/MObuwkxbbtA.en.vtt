00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 and today I 'm going to teach you how to do this 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:09.300
 flower look how pretty that is left 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:11.930
 made in crepe paper cut the measure 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:15.460
 of the paper you think you want 

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:15.460
 let's do it in this size 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:22.500
 you do at the beginning good to do the 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.760
 little part of the flower the middle part 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.869
 rounding a little bit and then 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:31.359
 we started producing 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:34.050
 before all this I expected that I had 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:37.150
 forgotten you have the edge stretch it 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.780
 a little stretch without tearing go 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:42.090
 stretching them a little bit 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.239
 It is a detail that gives the flower 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:50.070
 of this other aspect that you are pulling 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:52.310
 slowly, slowly until you reach 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.670
 the tip of the paper 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:58.970
 now if we go back to the beginning we start 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:03.350
 to roll the center of the flower like this and 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:06.409
 start this to go 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:09.249
 doing so and circling 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:09.249
 there is 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.250
 let's do it neatly 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:17.890
 I'm doing a sample so you can see 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.890
 how are things going there you're crumpling 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.050
 A) Yes 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:33.479
 give a little more volume wrinkling 

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:33.479
 here below we give you more volumes 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:51.119
 we are making the feeling 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:53.549
 to be staying but nice is 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:56.149
 very true that with simple and very 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.149
 pretty 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.590
 to be 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:08.819
 Now all that's left is to match a 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.120
 bit 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:14.040
 We open it a little bit more here by 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.730
 reverse a snap stick with a 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:20.310
 little piece of green paper that I'm going to 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:23.700
 put here the flower we are with thread 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.860
 the same color red thread you pass 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.840
 enough turns 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:31.620
 to secure it 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.409
 altar 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:38.690
 and I look says two leaves that are 

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:38.690
 I plan to paste here with vinyl cola
