deforestation a key part of the work is

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.380 
deforestation a key part of the work is
reduced<00:00:25.769> demand<00:00:26.070> for<00:00:26.279> charcoal<00:00:26.730> through<00:00:27.240> the

reduced demand for charcoal through the

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
the main cause of deforestation is

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.610 
the main cause of deforestation is
basically<00:00:36.480> combination<00:00:37.020> between<00:00:37.200> silikal

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
basically combination between silikal

basically combination between silikal
looking<00:00:37.920> and<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:38.430> charcoal<00:00:38.790> production<00:00:39.079> in

looking and the charcoal production in
96<00:00:41.489> 27<00:00:42.420> I<00:00:42.629> passed<00:00:43.379> this<00:00:43.620> this<00:00:44.100> area<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:44.750> this

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
96 27 I passed this this area and this

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.990 
96 27 I passed this this area and this
area<00:00:45.809> was<00:00:46.320> forest<00:00:46.770> I<00:00:47.039> didn't<00:00:47.730> know<00:00:47.820> what

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
area was forest I didn't know what

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.700 
area was forest I didn't know what
happened<00:00:48.149> during<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.690> last<00:00:48.840> ten<00:00:49.020> years<00:00:49.050> but<00:00:49.410> I

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
happened during the last ten years but I

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.310 
happened during the last ten years but I
presumably<00:00:50.399> this<00:00:50.700> because<00:00:51.030> of<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.390> logging

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
presumably this because of the logging

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.500 
presumably this because of the logging
and<00:00:52.649> also<00:00:53.280> because<00:00:53.640> of<00:00:53.820> this<00:00:54.030> charcoal

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
and also because of this charcoal

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.910 
and also because of this charcoal
production<00:00:55.940> people<00:00:56.940> cut<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.140> trees<00:00:58.440> and<00:00:58.739> then

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
production people cut the trees and then

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.240 
production people cut the trees and then
they<00:00:59.399> make<00:00:59.640> charcoal<00:01:00.090> and<00:01:00.359> then<00:01:00.980> as<00:01:01.980> you<00:01:02.100> can

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
they make charcoal and then as you can

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.189 
they make charcoal and then as you can
see<00:01:02.309> is<00:01:02.520> no<00:01:03.120> more<00:01:03.300> forest<00:01:03.600> here<00:01:03.809> the

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
see is no more forest here the

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.320 
see is no more forest here the
consumption<00:01:04.739> in<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.070> in<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.430> urban<00:01:05.760> areas<00:01:06.119> is

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
consumption in the in the urban areas is

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.350 
consumption in the in the urban areas is
quite<00:01:06.540> high<00:01:06.780> it<00:01:07.619> is<00:01:07.830> about<00:01:08.189> ninety<00:01:08.880> thousand

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
quite high it is about ninety thousand

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.000 
quite high it is about ninety thousand
ton<00:01:09.540> only<00:01:10.320> for<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.619> Phnom<00:01:10.770> Penh

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.890 
efficient device to cook currently there
is<00:01:19.860> no<00:01:19.890> realistic<00:01:20.700> alternative<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:21.450> charcoal

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.100 
is no realistic alternative to charcoal
for<00:01:22.049> cooking<00:01:22.409> so<00:01:23.130> CF<00:01:23.610> SP<00:01:24.090> have<00:01:24.420> redesigned<00:01:24.810> the

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
for cooking so CF SP have redesigned the

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.960 
for cooking so CF SP have redesigned the
traditional<00:01:25.590> stove<00:01:25.890> making<00:01:26.610> it<00:01:26.790> more

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
traditional stove making it more

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.940 
traditional stove making it more
efficient<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:27.689> cutting<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.560> amount<00:01:28.799> of

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
efficient and cutting the amount of

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.280 
efficient and cutting the amount of
charcoal<00:01:29.430> used<00:01:29.700> by<00:01:29.909> 22%

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
charcoal used by 22%

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.660 
charcoal used by 22%
most<00:01:32.189> of<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.460> families<00:01:32.850> day<00:01:33.420> they<00:01:34.020> use<00:01:34.670> this

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
most of the families day they use this

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.090 
most of the families day they use this
stove<00:01:35.939> we<00:01:36.930> consider<00:01:37.500> it<00:01:37.619> as<00:01:37.740> a<00:01:37.890> traditional

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
stove we consider it as a traditional

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.179 
stove we consider it as a traditional
stove<00:01:38.729> then<00:01:39.270> based<00:01:39.659> on<00:01:39.869> this<00:01:40.049> we<00:01:40.189> introduce

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
stove then based on this we introduce

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.990 
stove then based on this we introduce
new<00:01:41.430> design<00:01:42.390> adopted<00:01:43.200> from<00:01:43.380> Thailand<00:01:43.950> this<00:01:44.850> is

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
new design adopted from Thailand this is

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.359 
new design adopted from Thailand this is
combustion<00:01:45.420> chamber<00:01:45.720> we<00:01:46.560> forced<00:01:46.950> to<00:01:47.189> make

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
combustion chamber we forced to make

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.940 
combustion chamber we forced to make
this<00:01:47.610> smaller<00:01:47.909> so<00:01:48.240> then<00:01:49.079> you<00:01:49.200> cannot<00:01:49.500> put<00:01:49.740> big

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
this smaller so then you cannot put big

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.880 
this smaller so then you cannot put big
quantity<00:01:50.280> of<00:01:50.310> charcoal<00:01:51.259> we<00:01:52.259> make<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.649> great

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
quantity of charcoal we make the great

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.880 
quantity of charcoal we make the great
with<00:01:53.220> 37<00:01:54.000> holes<00:01:54.240> distributed<00:01:55.229> evenly

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
with 37 holes distributed evenly

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.880 
with 37 holes distributed evenly
so<00:01:56.520> then<00:01:56.729> distribution<00:01:57.570> of<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:58.079> air<00:01:58.259> gives

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
so then distribution of the air gives

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.830 
so then distribution of the air gives
you<00:01:59.070> better<00:01:59.340> combustion

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
you better combustion

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.649 
you better combustion
the<00:02:01.380> metal<00:02:01.710> cover<00:02:01.920> is<00:02:02.369> up<00:02:02.729> to<00:02:02.909> the<00:02:03.149> top<00:02:03.299> of<00:02:03.450> the

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
the metal cover is up to the top of the

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.929 
the metal cover is up to the top of the
edge<00:02:03.990> of<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.200> stove<00:02:04.470> then<00:02:05.130> it<00:02:05.430> is<00:02:05.640> more

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
edge of the stove then it is more

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.169 
edge of the stove then it is more
durable<00:02:06.090> stronger<00:02:07.079> and<00:02:07.290> we<00:02:08.190> put<00:02:08.429> a<00:02:08.459> refractory

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
durable stronger and we put a refractory

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.130 
durable stronger and we put a refractory
liner<00:02:09.450> made<00:02:10.050> of<00:02:10.289> rice<00:02:10.800> husk<00:02:11.130> s<00:02:11.640> mix<00:02:12.599> with<00:02:12.959> clay

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
liner made of rice husk s mix with clay

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.800 
liner made of rice husk s mix with clay
so<00:02:13.739> the<00:02:14.099> heat<00:02:14.520> here<00:02:14.849> will<00:02:15.060> be<00:02:15.180> reflecting<00:02:15.690> a

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
so the heat here will be reflecting a

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.339 
so the heat here will be reflecting a
packet<00:02:16.260> inside<00:02:16.910> this<00:02:17.910> insulator<00:02:18.420> is<00:02:18.780> made<00:02:19.080> of

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 
packet inside this insulator is made of

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:22.580 
packet inside this insulator is made of
