that's a quite pronounced rockin about
food

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.340 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:05.080 

yeah<00:01:01.690> well<00:01:02.690> this<00:01:02.960> is<00:01:03.110> a<00:01:03.140> tricky<00:01:03.500> one<00:01:04.030> I've<00:01:05.030> got

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:05.090 
yeah well this is a tricky one I've got

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:11.110 
yeah well this is a tricky one I've got
the<00:01:05.420> backed<00:01:05.660> back<00:01:05.990> gauge<00:01:06.260> and<00:01:09.730> the<00:01:10.730> back<00:01:10.910> to

the backed back gauge and the back to

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.800 
the backed back gauge and the back to
backs<00:01:11.330> are<00:01:11.690> fine<00:01:13.060> while<00:01:14.060> I<00:01:14.090> have<00:01:14.330> it<00:01:14.450> upside

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
backs are fine while I have it upside

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.920 
backs are fine while I have it upside

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 
down in the servicing cradle you can see

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:23.860 
down in the servicing cradle you can see
the<00:01:20.200> paper<00:01:21.200> clip<00:01:21.940> that's<00:01:22.940> attached<00:01:23.330> onto<00:01:23.600> the

anything that's um in between the tracks
and<00:01:44.869> is<00:01:45.110> sticking<00:01:45.770> up<00:01:45.860> lucky<00:01:46.130> bit<00:01:46.310> so<00:01:46.430> you<00:01:46.520> can

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
and is sticking up lucky bit so you can

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.830 
and is sticking up lucky bit so you can
see<00:01:46.760> how<00:01:46.970> I've<00:01:47.090> filed<00:01:47.390> off<00:01:48.310> a<00:01:49.390> little<00:01:50.390> bit<00:01:50.690> of

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
see how I've filed off a little bit of

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.040 
see how I've filed off a little bit of
that<00:01:51.460> plastic<00:01:52.460> there<00:01:52.670> to<00:01:53.479> give<00:01:53.630> it<00:01:53.690> a<00:01:53.750> bit<00:01:53.869> more

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.050 
that plastic there to give it a bit more

00:01:54.050 --> 00:02:00.900 
that plastic there to give it a bit more
clearance<00:01:54.350> because<00:01:55.130> in<00:01:55.400> fact<00:01:57.130> that<00:01:58.930> is<00:01:59.930> at<00:02:00.200> or

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:00.910 
clearance because in fact that is at or

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.980 
clearance because in fact that is at or
possibly<00:02:01.910> even<00:02:02.210> a<00:02:02.600> touch<00:02:02.869> above<00:02:03.080> rail<00:02:03.530> height

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
possibly even a touch above rail height

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:10.900 
possibly even a touch above rail height
in<00:02:05.990> the<00:02:06.170> middle<00:02:06.440> on<00:02:07.340> that<00:02:08.440> we<00:02:09.440> look<00:02:09.619> down<00:02:09.910> to

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
in the middle on that we look down to

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.830 
in the middle on that we look down to
the<00:02:10.940> side<00:02:13.030> it's<00:02:14.030> about<00:02:14.120> the<00:02:14.300> same<00:02:14.420> types<00:02:14.690> of

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
the side it's about the same types of

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.220 
the side it's about the same types of
changes<00:02:15.230> so<00:02:16.060> upside<00:02:17.060> down<00:02:17.270> in<00:02:17.540> the<00:02:17.660> cradle

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
changes so upside down in the cradle

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.400 
changes so upside down in the cradle
there<00:02:18.440> is<00:02:18.560> nothing<00:02:18.890> obvious<00:02:19.520> to<00:02:19.730> see<00:02:20.020> in<00:02:21.020> terms

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
there is nothing obvious to see in terms

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.059 
there is nothing obvious to see in terms
of<00:02:22.420> misalignment<00:02:23.420> of<00:02:23.720> the<00:02:24.200> wheels<00:02:24.410> that<00:02:24.650> would

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069 
of misalignment of the wheels that would

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:27.610 
of misalignment of the wheels that would
be<00:02:25.220> causing<00:02:25.850> that<00:02:26.090> rocking<00:02:26.930> motion<00:02:26.960> from<00:02:27.440> the

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
be causing that rocking motion from the

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.120 
be causing that rocking motion from the
jerky<00:02:28.069> movement<00:02:29.530> so<00:02:30.530> this<00:02:30.680> is<00:02:30.800> going<00:02:30.920> to<00:02:30.980> be<00:02:31.069> a

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
jerky movement so this is going to be a

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:51.380 
jerky movement so this is going to be a
very<00:02:31.310> tricky<00:02:31.520> one

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:03:00.040 

it's<00:02:51.900> no<00:02:52.050> good

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.050 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:07.220 

you

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:23.450 

you

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:23.460 

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:26.750 

ok<00:03:23.730> all<00:03:24.270> right<00:03:25.100> I've<00:03:26.100> taken<00:03:26.310> the<00:03:26.460> bottom<00:03:26.700> I've

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
ok all right I've taken the bottom I've

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.680 
ok all right I've taken the bottom I've
just<00:03:27.150> propped<00:03:27.540> it<00:03:27.750> up<00:03:27.990> on<00:03:28.380> the<00:03:28.500> plastic<00:03:28.950> there

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
just propped it up on the plastic there

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:32.510 
just propped it up on the plastic there
so<00:03:30.690> that<00:03:30.840> I<00:03:30.990> can<00:03:31.170> get<00:03:31.320> the<00:03:31.440> gauging<00:03:31.860> without

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:32.520 
so that I can get the gauging without

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.260 
so that I can get the gauging without
using<00:03:33.420> two<00:03:33.600> hands<00:03:33.870> and<00:03:34.670> I<00:03:35.670> think<00:03:35.820> what<00:03:36.030> you<00:03:36.120> can

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:36.270 
using two hands and I think what you can

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:39.260 
using two hands and I think what you can
see<00:03:36.450> is<00:03:36.600> that<00:03:37.670> the<00:03:38.670> gauge<00:03:38.850> goes<00:03:39.090> in<00:03:39.240> very

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:39.270 
see is that the gauge goes in very

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:46.220 
see is that the gauge goes in very
easily<00:03:39.690> there<00:03:41.270> but<00:03:42.270> is<00:03:44.600> tight<00:03:45.600> that<00:03:45.810> side<00:03:46.050> it

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
easily there but is tight that side it

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:55.090 
easily there but is tight that side it
won't<00:03:46.320> go<00:03:46.500> in<00:03:46.620> so<00:03:50.120> the<00:03:51.120> wheels<00:03:51.330> are<00:03:53.960> squiffy

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:55.100 
won't go in so the wheels are squiffy

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:59.030 
won't go in so the wheels are squiffy
and<00:03:56.100> that's<00:03:56.400> all<00:03:56.610> down<00:03:56.790> to<00:03:57.000> this<00:03:57.440> plastic<00:03:58.440> axle

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
and that's all down to this plastic axle

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.900 
and that's all down to this plastic axle
in<00:03:59.160> the<00:03:59.250> middle<00:03:59.520> I<00:03:59.640> have<00:04:00.570> tried<00:04:00.840> just<00:04:01.910> easing

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
in the middle I have tried just easing

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.170 
in the middle I have tried just easing
the<00:04:03.000> wheels<00:04:03.180> a<00:04:03.360> little<00:04:03.390> bit<00:04:03.630> with<00:04:03.870> my<00:04:04.020> fingers

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.180 
the wheels a little bit with my fingers

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.820 
the wheels a little bit with my fingers
but<00:04:06.180> I'm<00:04:06.270> afraid<00:04:06.420> if<00:04:06.720> I<00:04:06.810> press<00:04:07.110> too<00:04:07.350> hard

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:07.830 
but I'm afraid if I press too hard

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:12.560 
but I'm afraid if I press too hard
alright<00:04:08.160> break<00:04:08.820> or<00:04:09.000> split<00:04:09.330> that<00:04:09.480> axle<00:04:11.240> that<00:04:12.240> I

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:12.570 
alright break or split that axle that I

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:17.420 
alright break or split that axle that I
suspect<00:04:13.350> is<00:04:13.650> the<00:04:13.890> cause<00:04:14.130> the<00:04:14.160> problem<00:04:16.430> the

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
suspect is the cause the problem the

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:27.230 
suspect is the cause the problem the
difficulty<00:04:17.970> now<00:04:18.000> is<00:04:18.330> finding<00:04:18.720> a<00:04:18.780> solution

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.480 

the<00:04:27.720> reason<00:04:27.960> I<00:04:28.050> like<00:04:28.259> this<00:04:28.470> loco<00:04:28.919> is<00:04:29.130> because

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
the reason I like this loco is because

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:37.070 
the reason I like this loco is because
it's<00:04:31.039> rough<00:04:32.039> to<00:04:32.250> good<00:04:32.430> or<00:04:32.550> slow<00:04:32.940> running<00:04:36.080> it's

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.080 
it's rough to good or slow running it's

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:44.650 
it's rough to good or slow running it's
better

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:44.660 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:49.500 

but<00:04:45.290> for<00:04:45.500> how<00:04:45.590> long<00:04:45.760> it's<00:04:46.760> a<00:04:46.880> split<00:04:47.180> chassis

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:49.510 
but for how long it's a split chassis

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:53.210 
but for how long it's a split chassis
engine

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.730 

that<00:04:53.790> certainly<00:04:54.180> isn't<00:04:54.420> as<00:04:54.690> jerky<00:04:55.380> as<00:04:55.470> it<00:04:55.620> was

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740

that certainly isn't as jerky as it was
before<00:04:55.980> I'm<00:04:56.670> not<00:04:56.940> sure<00:04:57.150> if<00:04:57.270> that<00:04:57.450> shows<00:04:57.960> up

00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:58.200 
before I'm not sure if that shows up

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:02.090 
before I'm not sure if that shows up
here<00:04:58.700> but<00:04:59.700> it<00:04:59.910> still<00:05:00.360> isn't<00:05:01.100> absolutely

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:02.100 
here but it still isn't absolutely

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:12.010 
here but it still isn't absolutely
smooth<00:05:05.990> all<00:05:06.990> I've<00:05:07.350> done<00:05:07.560> is<00:05:09.320> tried<00:05:10.320> to<00:05:10.710> bend

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:12.020 
smooth all I've done is tried to bend

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:17.300 
smooth all I've done is tried to bend
their<00:05:14.690> axle<00:05:15.690> I<00:05:15.870> bend<00:05:16.320> the<00:05:16.440> wheels<00:05:16.620> back<00:05:17.010> to<00:05:17.280> a

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:17.310 
their axle I bend the wheels back to a

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:22.850 
their axle I bend the wheels back to a
better<00:05:17.580> shape<00:05:20.900> so<00:05:21.900> the<00:05:22.050> gauge<00:05:22.290> is<00:05:22.560> the<00:05:22.650> same

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:22.860 
better shape so the gauge is the same

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:40.950 
better shape so the gauge is the same
all<00:05:23.040> the<00:05:23.070> way<00:05:23.190> around

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:40.960 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.680 

I<00:05:40.990> think<00:05:41.770> yes<00:05:42.009> very<00:05:42.729> suddenly<00:05:43.150> you<00:05:43.360> can<00:05:43.509> see

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:43.690 
I think yes very suddenly you can see

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:48.110 
I think yes very suddenly you can see
there<00:05:43.900> there's<00:05:44.139> a<00:05:44.229> little<00:05:44.350> bit<00:05:44.500> of<00:05:44.650> them

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:48.120 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:52.700 

hesitation<00:05:49.120> one<00:05:49.600> point<00:05:49.900> of<00:05:50.050> its<00:05:50.370> rotation<00:05:51.539> and

hesitation one point of its rotation and
