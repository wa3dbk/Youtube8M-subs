much<00:00:33.720> I<00:00:33.870> just<00:00:33.900> didn't<00:00:34.559> like<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.680> fact<00:00:34.980> that<00:00:35.130> he

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
much I just didn't like the fact that he

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.979 
much I just didn't like the fact that he
lost<00:00:35.700> a<00:00:35.879> lot<00:00:35.910> which<00:00:36.210> is<00:00:36.300> funny<00:00:36.510> because<00:00:36.660> I<00:00:36.809> like

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
lost a lot which is funny because I like

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.500 
lost a lot which is funny because I like
it<00:00:37.140> to<00:00:37.230> Gaia<00:00:37.410> I<00:00:37.770> know<00:00:38.700> that<00:00:39.059> makes<00:00:39.210> no<00:00:39.330> sense

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
it to Gaia I know that makes no sense

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.750 
it to Gaia I know that makes no sense
anyway<00:00:40.110> well<00:00:40.800> that<00:00:40.980> being<00:00:41.190> said<00:00:41.400> just<00:00:41.640> gonna

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
be a rather short review because I feel

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:44.660 
be a rather short review because I feel
like<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.920> only<00:00:43.980> things<00:00:44.309> that<00:00:44.430> I<00:00:44.460> need<00:00:44.550> to

discuss<00:00:45.180> in<00:00:45.390> this<00:00:45.629> chapter<00:00:46.020> review<00:00:46.440> is

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
discuss in this chapter review is

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.850 
discuss in this chapter review is
Reggie's<00:00:47.489> bankai<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:49.199> formations<00:00:49.739> that

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
Reggie's bankai and the formations that

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.090 
Reggie's bankai and the formations that
it<00:00:50.100> takes<00:00:50.339> now<00:00:51.110> honestly<00:00:52.110> after<00:00:52.350> seeing<00:00:52.800> this

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
it takes now honestly after seeing this

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.610 
it takes now honestly after seeing this
performance<00:00:53.909> I<00:00:54.059> think<00:00:54.390> Reggie's<00:00:54.870> bankai<00:00:55.350> is

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
performance I think Reggie's bankai is

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.549 
performance I think Reggie's bankai is
probably<00:00:56.220> one<00:00:56.790> of<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:57.300> most<00:00:57.540> if<00:00:57.780> not<00:00:57.839> the<00:00:58.379> most

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
probably one of the most if not the most

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.820 
probably one of the most if not the most
useful<00:00:59.519> bankai<00:01:00.330> in<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.750> entire<00:01:01.050> series<00:01:01.409> that

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:01.830 
useful bankai in the entire series that

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:04.100 
useful bankai in the entire series that
we've<00:01:02.070> seen<00:01:02.339> so<00:01:02.850> far<00:01:03.089> now<00:01:03.570> of<00:01:03.690> course<00:01:03.750> it's<00:01:04.019> a

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
we've seen so far now of course it's a

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.360 
we've seen so far now of course it's a
couple<00:01:04.500> of<00:01:04.559> characters<00:01:04.739> we<00:01:04.949> haven't<00:01:05.159> seen<00:01:05.309> yet

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:05.370 
couple of characters we haven't seen yet

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:08.510 
couple of characters we haven't seen yet
like<00:01:06.060> ichigo's<00:01:06.420> new<00:01:06.810> bankai<00:01:07.260> and<00:01:07.650> aizen's

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
like ichigo's new bankai and aizen's

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.570 
like ichigo's new bankai and aizen's
bankai<00:01:09.090> and<00:01:09.510> things<00:01:09.780> of<00:01:09.870> that<00:01:09.900> nature<00:01:10.580> however

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
bankai and things of that nature however

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.420 
bankai and things of that nature however
out<00:01:12.270> of<00:01:12.690> all<00:01:12.870> the<00:01:13.110> bank<00:01:13.320> as<00:01:13.530> we've<00:01:13.740> seen<00:01:13.920> so<00:01:14.190> far

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
out of all the bank as we've seen so far

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.600 
out of all the bank as we've seen so far
Reggie's<00:01:15.030> bankai<00:01:15.450> is<00:01:15.780> most<00:01:16.710> likely<00:01:16.920> one<00:01:17.580> of

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
Reggie's bankai is most likely one of

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.930 
Reggie's bankai is most likely one of
the<00:01:18.060> if<00:01:18.360> not<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.750> most<00:01:19.010> useful<00:01:20.010> now<00:01:20.640> I'm<00:01:20.790> not

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:20.940 
the if not the most useful now I'm not

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:22.760 
the if not the most useful now I'm not
saying<00:01:21.150> useful<00:01:21.570> as<00:01:21.630> it<00:01:21.660> is<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.080> best<00:01:22.320> it's<00:01:22.650> the

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
saying useful as it is the best it's the

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.510 
saying useful as it is the best it's the
strongest<00:01:23.480> know<00:01:24.530> so<00:01:25.530> don't<00:01:26.130> drop<00:01:26.340> those

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
strongest know so don't drop those

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.250 
strongest know so don't drop those
comments<00:01:27.000> like<00:01:27.150> Joe<00:01:27.510> time<00:01:27.750> what<00:01:28.140> are<00:01:28.200> you

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:28.260 
comments like Joe time what are you

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.650 
comments like Joe time what are you
talking<00:01:28.590> about<00:01:28.650> no<00:01:29.550> none<00:01:29.790> of<00:01:29.820> that<00:01:29.910> I<00:01:30.180> mean

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:30.660 
talking about no none of that I mean

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.110 
talking about no none of that I mean
useful<00:01:31.110> as<00:01:31.260> in<00:01:31.530> it<00:01:31.740> just<00:01:32.130> fits<00:01:32.460> so<00:01:32.790> many

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:33.120 
useful as in it just fits so many

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.330 
useful as in it just fits so many
different<00:01:33.390> situations<00:01:33.660> that<00:01:34.290> it's<00:01:34.980> actually

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
different situations that it's actually

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.190 
different situations that it's actually
useful<00:01:35.430> though<00:01:36.300> that's<00:01:36.720> why<00:01:36.780> useful<00:01:37.050> means

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
useful though that's why useful means

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.280 
useful though that's why useful means
it's<00:01:37.440> useful<00:01:38.250> because<00:01:38.400> it<00:01:38.910> takes<00:01:39.360> on<00:01:39.570> so<00:01:40.020> many

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
it's useful because it takes on so many

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.050 
it's useful because it takes on so many
different<00:01:40.740> forms<00:01:41.400> it<00:01:41.580> can<00:01:41.820> be<00:01:41.910> used

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
different forms it can be used

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.760 
different forms it can be used
offensively<00:01:42.390> you<00:01:42.750> can<00:01:42.900> be<00:01:42.960> used<00:01:43.140> offensively

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
offensively you can be used offensively

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.400 
offensively you can be used offensively
it<00:01:44.310> can<00:01:44.520> have<00:01:45.030> a<00:01:45.060> quick<00:01:45.390> attack<00:01:45.690> it<00:01:45.900> can<00:01:46.020> have<00:01:46.200> a

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:46.410 
it can have a quick attack it can have a

power attack it's just it's ridiculous
and<00:01:49.670> Renji<00:01:50.670> uses<00:01:51.570> these<00:01:51.720> different<00:01:52.760> callings

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:53.760

the<00:03:47.820> way<00:03:48.000> I<00:03:48.030> used<00:03:48.150> to<00:03:48.450> when<00:03:48.600> I<00:03:48.720> first<00:03:48.989> already

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
the way I used to when I first already

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.349 
the way I used to when I first already
in<00:03:49.799> the<00:03:49.859> beginning<00:03:50.010> a<00:03:50.250> bleach<00:03:50.430> and<00:03:50.700> then<00:03:51.269> he

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:51.359 
in the beginning a bleach and then he

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:52.940 
in the beginning a bleach and then he
fell<00:03:51.480> off<00:03:51.540> anyway<00:03:52.019> all<00:03:52.260> that<00:03:52.440> being<00:03:52.620> said<00:03:52.739> I
