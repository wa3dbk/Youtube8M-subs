surprise for us folks what is it jug
it's<00:00:25.849> the<00:00:26.150> new<00:00:26.329> prototype<00:00:26.900> of<00:00:27.230> the<00:00:27.619> hyper

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:27.800 
it's the new prototype of the hyper

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.709 
it's the new prototype of the hyper
frames<00:00:28.129> uh<00:00:28.369> really<00:00:29.149> don't<00:00:29.270> even<00:00:29.329> have<00:00:29.509> a<00:00:29.540> name

00:00:29.709 --> 00:00:29.719 
frames uh really don't even have a name

00:00:29.719 --> 00:00:31.450 
frames uh really don't even have a name
for<00:00:29.779> them<00:00:30.050> yet<00:00:30.140> this<00:00:30.619> is<00:00:30.800> the<00:00:30.950> one<00:00:31.309> of<00:00:31.399> the

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:31.460 
for them yet this is the one of the

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.000 
for them yet this is the one of the
first<00:00:31.669> ones<00:00:31.989> it's<00:00:32.989> got<00:00:33.170> to<00:00:33.290> have<00:00:33.440> a<00:00:33.469> few<00:00:33.860> more

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.010 
first ones it's got to have a few more

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.459 
first ones it's got to have a few more
changes<00:00:34.399> before<00:00:34.550> its<00:00:34.850> final<00:00:34.969> hook<00:00:35.300> can<00:00:36.230> I<00:00:36.289> can

00:00:36.459 --> 00:00:36.469 
changes before its final hook can I can

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:38.709 
changes before its final hook can I can
I<00:00:36.500> show<00:00:36.649> the<00:00:36.739> world<00:00:36.920> in<00:00:37.129> yes<00:00:37.489> it's<00:00:37.820> alright

00:00:38.709 --> 00:00:38.719 
I show the world in yes it's alright

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:40.750 
I show the world in yes it's alright
it's<00:00:39.110> just<00:00:39.230> get<00:00:39.710> out<00:00:39.829> let's<00:00:40.190> check<00:00:40.399> this<00:00:40.520> out

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:40.760 
it's just get out let's check this out

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.270 
it's just get out let's check this out
all<00:00:41.000> hydroformed<00:00:41.870> tubing<00:00:42.289> square<00:00:42.860> like<00:00:43.129> the

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.280 
all hydroformed tubing square like the

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.550 
all hydroformed tubing square like the
old<00:00:43.399> box<00:00:43.640> to<00:00:43.879> rear<00:00:44.030> ends<00:00:44.270> new<00:00:44.570> drop<00:00:44.900> out<00:00:45.200> all

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:45.560 
old box to rear ends new drop out all

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:49.120 
old box to rear ends new drop out all
new<00:00:45.860> geometry<00:00:47.140> just<00:00:48.140> a<00:00:48.260> completely<00:00:48.680> different

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:49.130 
new geometry just a completely different

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.090 
new geometry just a completely different
bike<00:00:49.280> don't<00:00:50.090> forget<00:00:50.270> about<00:00:50.390> the<00:00:50.480> person<00:00:51.100> and

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100 
bike don't forget about the person and

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.650 
bike don't forget about the person and
then<00:00:52.310> the<00:00:52.460> cruiser<00:00:52.730> is<00:00:52.970> very<00:00:53.180> similar<00:00:53.390> to<00:00:53.510> the

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:53.660 
then the cruiser is very similar to the

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:54.940 
then the cruiser is very similar to the
same<00:00:53.960> tubing<00:00:54.350> is<00:00:54.470> definitely<00:00:54.890> different

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:54.950 
same tubing is definitely different

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:59.770 
same tubing is definitely different
dimension

00:00:59.770 --> 00:00:59.780 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.660 

I<00:01:00.820> must<00:01:01.820> say<00:01:02.030> judge<00:01:02.420> you<00:01:03.410> almost<00:01:03.920> make<00:01:04.250> me<00:01:04.280> want

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
I must say judge you almost make me want

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.810 
I must say judge you almost make me want
to<00:01:04.729> get<00:01:04.909> one<00:01:05.710> once<00:01:06.710> the<00:01:06.950> finals<00:01:07.520> are<00:01:07.640> done

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 
to get one once the finals are done

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.460 
to get one once the finals are done
we're<00:01:08.330> going<00:01:08.420> to<00:01:08.509> spread<00:01:08.780> this<00:01:08.930> out<00:01:09.110> of<00:01:09.290> it<00:01:09.409> so

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 
we're going to spread this out of it so

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:10.899 
we're going to spread this out of it so
you<00:01:09.500> have<00:01:09.619> a<00:01:09.650> little<00:01:09.770> more<00:01:09.860> clearance<00:01:10.220> we're

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:10.909 
you have a little more clearance we're

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:12.789 
you have a little more clearance we're
probably<00:01:11.060> going<00:01:11.240> to<00:01:11.299> go<00:01:11.450> and<00:01:11.690> so<00:01:11.869> the<00:01:12.080> internal

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:12.799 
probably going to go and so the internal

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:14.050 
probably going to go and so the internal
head<00:01:12.950> tubes<00:01:13.190> are<00:01:13.280> going<00:01:13.400> to<00:01:13.520> integrated<00:01:13.940> head

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
head tubes are going to integrated head

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.540 
head tubes are going to integrated head
tube<00:01:14.270> smart<00:01:14.780> move<00:01:14.930> so<00:01:15.530> just<00:01:16.190> a<00:01:16.280> few<00:01:16.310> more

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:16.550 
tube smart move so just a few more

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:17.830 
tube smart move so just a few more
changes<00:01:16.970> and<00:01:17.180> Leighton<00:01:17.540> them<00:01:17.630> up<00:01:17.720> a<00:01:17.810> little

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
changes and Leighton them up a little

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.620 
changes and Leighton them up a little
bit<00:01:18.170> and<00:01:18.350> they'll<00:01:18.890> be<00:01:19.009> ready<00:01:19.159> to<00:01:19.340> go<00:01:19.490> but<00:01:19.729> with

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
bit and they'll be ready to go but with

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.260 
bit and they'll be ready to go but with
the<00:01:21.560> dimensions<00:01:22.100> the<00:01:22.430> bottom<00:01:22.729> brackets<00:01:23.090> got

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
the dimensions the bottom brackets got

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:24.910 
the dimensions the bottom brackets got
lower<00:01:23.479> the<00:01:23.690> rear<00:01:23.840> ends<00:01:24.020> are<00:01:24.170> shorter<00:01:24.590> and<00:01:24.740> the

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
lower the rear ends are shorter and the

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.370 
lower the rear ends are shorter and the
top<00:01:25.549> tubes<00:01:25.850> on<00:01:26.090> the<00:01:26.270> probe<00:01:26.600> excels<00:01:26.930> are<00:01:27.080> tiny

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
top tubes on the probe excels are tiny

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:28.930 
top tubes on the probe excels are tiny
bit<00:01:27.619> shorter<00:01:28.040> there<00:01:28.190> one<00:01:28.340> in<00:01:28.369> an<00:01:28.549> eighth<00:01:28.700> noun

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:28.940 
bit shorter there one in an eighth noun

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.669 
bit shorter there one in an eighth noun
so<00:01:29.210> 121<00:01:30.080> and<00:01:30.200> 821<00:01:31.070> recorder<00:01:31.490> so<00:01:32.420> we're<00:01:32.679> we're

00:01:33.669 --> 00:01:33.679 
so 121 and 821 recorder so we're we're

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:35.139 
so 121 and 821 recorder so we're we're
getting<00:01:33.860> close<00:01:34.070> these<00:01:34.369> are<00:01:34.550> the<00:01:34.759> first<00:01:34.940> round

00:01:35.139 --> 00:01:35.149 
getting close these are the first round

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:36.700 
getting close these are the first round
of<00:01:35.270> prototypes<00:01:35.720> a<00:01:35.869> one<00:01:36.229> more<00:01:36.380> round<00:01:36.560> of

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
of prototypes a one more round of

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.620 
of prototypes a one more round of
prototypes<00:01:37.160> come<00:01:37.399> in<00:01:37.520> hopefully<00:01:38.149> they'll<00:01:38.600> be

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
prototypes come in hopefully they'll be

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.389 
prototypes come in hopefully they'll be
spot-on<00:01:39.530> and<00:01:39.830> then<00:01:39.950> we<00:01:40.009> go<00:01:40.130> into<00:01:40.159> production

00:01:40.389 --> 00:01:40.399 
spot-on and then we go into production

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:43.540 
spot-on and then we go into production
okay<00:01:41.210> so<00:01:41.270> when<00:01:41.929> I<00:01:41.960> move<00:01:42.229> up<00:01:42.380> to<00:01:42.830> vet<00:01:43.039> pro<00:01:43.340> does

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:43.550 
okay so when I move up to vet pro does

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:44.859 
okay so when I move up to vet pro does
