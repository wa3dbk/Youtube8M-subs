00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:04.280
 do not 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.880
 is one of those brown dogs rather 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:12.840
 pulling small 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.640
 I was so tired to the owner from inside to 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.900
 ask for reasons 

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:22.560
 saying I do not explain a book to me 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.780
 You explained why you cut me 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.050
 the tail when I was a girl 

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:31.470
 give me just one single explanation 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:34.050
 I was insulting that you were bothered by 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.890
 I did not have the line 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.960
 pretension so inhumanly 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.670
 correct him bye bye the flat the king of the 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.420
 creation 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:50.010
 to the consummate right I will move on to another 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:52.979
 thing but all as hateful as those 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.979
 that they mentioned the other night I went out with 

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:58.519
 heading to the bottom barking I thought that 

00:00:55.979 --> 00:01:01.199
 they were stealing by the bochinche that today 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:03.510
 and how I woke you, you threw me in a 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.800
 shoe that looks in boxes and the cat 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.410
 because I receive 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:12.950
 the night of the haze of that storm 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:16.010
 so ugly I feel the cackling 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:19.810
 they stole the chickens and the other days 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:22.580
 because I did not bark that dawn you gave me 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.190
 so many kicks that I'll never forget 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.950
 you decide 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:31.150
 tell me it is not absurd that you walk me to 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:34.990
 holy in suspense but thief did not come 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:39.670
 and if thief because a turdÃ³ but gives you ri 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:43.270
 brother when there are visits present me 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:46.690
 flames for me to feel that I greet and 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:49.720
 bad candle gets fucked the patota of the 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:52.570
 chin corner you send me to the 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:55.660
 career that steals the ball and you have to 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:58.720
 See how he quarrels many times without measure 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:02.980
 if I do not show up right away every time 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:06.190
 euphoric flames I run to the flight believing 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:09.190
 find good empathy me why you 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:11.890
 I fill the pants but if I get to 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:14.020
 entering the room for outside runs me and 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:17.020
 it's weird that you do not give me something for the 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:19.780
 head and immediately you hear this 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:23.319

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:26.810
 that kill him walks out 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:30.709
 where will I put my noses 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:34.880
 so that I can be calm if I go out to 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:38.150
 the street you said a truck stomps on me and 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:41.360
 If he professed me there, I made myself under 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:44.360
 the same thinking that in one of those 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:47.200
 I can link some bone also in that 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:50.989
 read also in that read it because there 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:54.709
 thing that bursts a bad smell that 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:57.349
 feel there you have to be expert and already 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:59.510
 kick me out and unable to argue 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:03.140
 because who I'm going to ask 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.799
 confirm your suspicions envious as 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:08.590
 canine 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:12.230
 to the wild dogs he said in his 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:18.610
 reflections the dog of my neighbors 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:18.610
