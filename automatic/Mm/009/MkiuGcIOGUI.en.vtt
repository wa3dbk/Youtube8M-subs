00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
let me just use a little quick measure

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.990 
let me just use a little quick measure
tool<00:00:39.180> and<00:00:39.950> it<00:00:40.950> looks<00:00:41.160> like<00:00:41.219> they're<00:00:41.489> container

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
tool and it looks like they're container

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.779 
tool and it looks like they're container
here<00:00:42.450> their<00:00:42.629> parent<00:00:43.020> container<00:00:43.550> it<00:00:44.550> looks

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
here their parent container it looks

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.869 
here their parent container it looks
like<00:00:44.910> around<00:00:45.379> 1212<00:00:46.379> about<00:00:46.860> 1200<00:00:47.309> pixels<00:00:47.670> wide

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.359 
the 1200 pixels for my width margin zero
picks<00:01:03.750> Auto<00:01:04.019> is<00:01:04.290> going<00:01:04.470> to<00:01:04.559> horizontally

Center<00:01:05.820> that<00:01:05.970> on<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.270> page<00:01:06.510> which<00:01:06.810> is<00:01:06.960> pretty

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
Center that on the page which is pretty

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.270 
Center that on the page which is pretty
normal<00:01:07.500> thing<00:01:07.830> to<00:01:07.979> do

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
normal thing to do

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.500 
normal thing to do
and<00:01:10.549> since<00:01:11.549> we've<00:01:11.700> got<00:01:11.880> our<00:01:12.000> three<00:01:12.330> basic

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
and since we've got our three basic

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.330 
and since we've got our three basic
columns<00:01:13.229> here<00:01:13.439> and<00:01:13.530> let's<00:01:13.740> kind<00:01:13.920> of<00:01:13.979> ignore

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
columns here and let's kind of ignore

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.160 
columns here and let's kind of ignore
the<00:01:14.549> header<00:01:14.790> first<00:01:15.060> I<00:01:15.479> guess<00:01:15.780> we<00:01:15.930> shouldn't

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
the header first I guess we shouldn't

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.300 
the header first I guess we shouldn't
really<00:01:16.320> ignore<00:01:16.680> that<00:01:16.830> header<00:01:17.009> because<00:01:17.189> that

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
really ignore that header because that

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.010 
really ignore that header because that
header<00:01:17.460> is<00:01:17.580> pretty<00:01:17.820> critical<00:01:18.000> so<00:01:18.689> let's<00:01:18.840> do

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
header is pretty critical so let's do

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.420 
header is pretty critical so let's do
that<00:01:19.049> let's<00:01:19.320> assume<00:01:19.590> this<00:01:19.860> header<00:01:20.100> is<00:01:20.310> it

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
that let's assume this header is it

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.440 
that let's assume this header is it
looks<00:01:20.580> like<00:01:20.700> it's<00:01:20.820> stretching<00:01:21.180> all<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.299> way

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
looks like it's stretching all the way

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.760 
looks like it's stretching all the way
across<00:01:21.689> with<00:01:22.049> their<00:01:22.170> cool<00:01:22.409> little<00:01:22.590> effect

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
across with their cool little effect

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.249 
across with their cool little effect
here<00:01:23.280> and<00:01:23.430> then<00:01:24.330> we've<00:01:24.479> got<00:01:24.689> our<00:01:24.720> three

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
here and then we've got our three

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.550 
here and then we've got our three
columns<00:01:25.619> after<00:01:25.950> that<00:01:26.100> so<00:01:27.229> we've<00:01:28.229> got<00:01:28.409> the

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
columns after that so we've got the

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.160 
columns after that so we've got the
header<00:01:29.600> then<00:01:30.600> we've<00:01:30.720> got<00:01:31.700> sidebar<00:01:32.700> left<00:01:33.170> and

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
header then we've got sidebar left and

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:41.020 
header then we've got sidebar left and
then<00:01:34.470> we<00:01:34.619> have<00:01:34.770> our<00:01:34.890> main<00:01:35.100> content

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:46.900 

and<00:01:41.780> of<00:01:42.110> course<00:01:42.350> our<00:01:42.590> sidebar<00:01:43.130> right<00:01:45.730> so<00:01:46.730> those

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:46.910 
and of course our sidebar right so those

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.000 
and of course our sidebar right so those
are<00:01:47.000> the<00:01:47.090> three<00:01:47.450> really<00:01:48.020> noticeable<00:01:48.500> sections

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:49.010 
are the three really noticeable sections

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:50.140 
are the three really noticeable sections
what<00:01:49.160> about<00:01:49.340> all<00:01:49.520> the<00:01:49.700> way<00:01:49.790> at<00:01:49.880> the<00:01:49.970> very

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:50.150 
what about all the way at the very

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.440 
what about all the way at the very
bottom<00:01:50.330> what<00:01:50.630> if<00:01:50.720> they<00:01:50.810> got<00:01:50.960> four<00:01:51.140> footer

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
bottom what if they got four footer

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.070 
bottom what if they got four footer
looks<00:01:53.450> like<00:01:53.540> they've<00:01:53.660> got<00:01:53.780> a<00:01:53.810> few<00:01:53.960> little

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
looks like they've got a few little

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.200 
looks like they've got a few little
jQuery<00:01:54.770> things<00:01:55.040> going<00:01:55.310> on<00:01:55.400> it's<00:01:55.640> kind<00:01:55.970> of<00:01:56.030> like

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
jQuery things going on it's kind of like

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.310 
jQuery things going on it's kind of like
an<00:01:56.330> endless<00:01:56.630> scroll<00:01:57.140> effect<00:01:57.560> here<00:01:58.450> but<00:01:59.450> it

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
an endless scroll effect here but it

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.140 
an endless scroll effect here but it
looks<00:02:00.619> like<00:02:00.680> I<00:02:00.920> guess<00:02:01.130> their<00:02:01.340> footer<00:02:01.670> is<00:02:01.880> over

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:02.150 
looks like I guess their footer is over

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.210 
looks like I guess their footer is over
here<00:02:02.450> I<00:02:02.630> guess<00:02:02.840> just<00:02:02.869> tacked<00:02:03.470> at<00:02:03.680> the<00:02:03.770> bottom

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
here I guess just tacked at the bottom

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.400 
here I guess just tacked at the bottom
of<00:02:04.460> this<00:02:05.119> right<00:02:05.420> column<00:02:05.900> which<00:02:06.050> doesn't

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:06.410 
of this right column which doesn't

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:07.630 
of this right column which doesn't
scroll<00:02:06.650> any<00:02:06.830> further<00:02:06.979> so<00:02:07.220> that's<00:02:07.400> kind<00:02:07.580> of

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
scroll any further so that's kind of

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.940 
scroll any further so that's kind of
limited<00:02:07.970> there<00:02:08.289> so<00:02:09.289> it's<00:02:09.440> kind<00:02:09.560> of<00:02:09.709> an<00:02:09.830> unusual

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
limited there so it's kind of an unusual

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.370 
limited there so it's kind of an unusual
design<00:02:10.820> I<00:02:10.850> don't<00:02:11.060> go<00:02:11.150> to<00:02:11.209> Yahoo<00:02:11.450> too<00:02:11.780> often<00:02:12.230> so

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
design I don't go to Yahoo too often so

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.080 
design I don't go to Yahoo too often so
I<00:02:12.410> was<00:02:12.830> a<00:02:12.860> little<00:02:13.070> unfamiliar<00:02:13.640> with<00:02:13.760> how<00:02:13.940> they

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
I was a little unfamiliar with how they

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.540 
I was a little unfamiliar with how they
had<00:02:14.270> stuff<00:02:14.930> laid<00:02:15.110> out<00:02:15.320> on<00:02:15.440> there<00:02:15.620> but<00:02:16.430> we'll

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
had stuff laid out on there but we'll

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:17.860 
had stuff laid out on there but we'll
still<00:02:16.760> use<00:02:16.940> them<00:02:17.060> as<00:02:17.180> our<00:02:17.270> three<00:02:17.540> column

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
still use them as our three column

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.600 
still use them as our three column
example<00:02:18.350> but<00:02:18.739> I<00:02:18.800> think<00:02:18.920> we've<00:02:19.040> got<00:02:19.190> enough<00:02:19.430> to

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
example but I think we've got enough to

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.080 
example but I think we've got enough to
try<00:02:20.090> this<00:02:20.150> out<00:02:20.390> here<00:02:20.770> now<00:02:21.770> our<00:02:21.950> header<00:02:22.220> like

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
try this out here now our header like

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.030 
try this out here now our header like
all<00:02:23.300> block<00:02:23.570> elements<00:02:24.140> is<00:02:24.260> going<00:02:24.470> to<00:02:24.530> naturally

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
all block elements is going to naturally

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.710 
all block elements is going to naturally
be<00:02:25.160> as<00:02:25.370> wide<00:02:25.610> as<00:02:25.820> it<00:02:25.940> can<00:02:26.090> be<00:02:26.239> so<00:02:26.420> I<00:02:26.480> don't<00:02:26.510> even

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
be as wide as it can be so I don't even

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.810 
be as wide as it can be so I don't even
have<00:02:26.930> to<00:02:27.020> set<00:02:27.230> the<00:02:27.380> width<00:02:27.530> for<00:02:27.860> it<00:02:27.980> but<00:02:28.489> I<00:02:28.520> will

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
have to set the width for it but I will

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.420 
have to set the width for it but I will
set<00:02:29.090> a<00:02:29.120> min<00:02:29.390> height<00:02:29.630> of<00:02:29.989> about<00:02:30.230> 50<00:02:30.709> pixels<00:02:31.160> just

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
set a min height of about 50 pixels just

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.370 
set a min height of about 50 pixels just
so<00:02:31.489> we<00:02:31.610> can<00:02:31.730> visualize<00:02:31.790> it<00:02:32.450> and<00:02:33.080> give<00:02:33.230> it<00:02:33.320> a

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
so we can visualize it and give it a

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:38.470 
so we can visualize it and give it a
background<00:02:33.560> color<00:02:34.100> so<00:02:35.110> we<00:02:36.110> can<00:02:36.260> see<00:02:36.440> that<00:02:37.480> now

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
background color so we can see that now

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.840 
background color so we can see that now
for<00:02:38.540> my<00:02:39.020> sidebar<00:02:42.100> sidebar<00:02:43.100> left<00:02:43.400> I'll<00:02:43.610> set

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
for my sidebar sidebar left I'll set

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:45.610 
for my sidebar sidebar left I'll set
that<00:02:44.000> to<00:02:44.060> betta<00:02:44.420> width<00:02:44.989> of<00:02:45.140> a<00:02:45.200> hundred<00:02:45.530> and

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
that to betta width of a hundred and

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.619 
that to betta width of a hundred and
fifty<00:02:45.890> pixels

00:02:50.619 --> 00:02:50.629 

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:57.750 

and<00:02:51.549> let's<00:02:52.549> do<00:02:52.700> a<00:02:52.730> background<00:02:52.969> color<00:02:53.390> and

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.890 

where<00:02:58.760> they<00:02:58.879> I'll<00:02:59.180> do<00:02:59.329> green<00:02:59.719> here<00:03:01.569> and<00:03:02.569> a<00:03:02.689> min

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
where they I'll do green here and a min

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:03.839 
where they I'll do green here and a min
height

00:03:03.839 --> 00:03:03.849 
height

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:09.369 
height
let's<00:03:04.849> do<00:03:04.999> 500<00:03:05.510> pixels<00:03:07.090> okay<00:03:08.090> now<00:03:08.810> this<00:03:09.319> is

00:03:09.369 --> 00:03:09.379 
let's do 500 pixels okay now this is

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:10.809 
let's do 500 pixels okay now this is
always<00:03:09.709> the<00:03:09.829> trickiest<00:03:10.219> part<00:03:10.579> when<00:03:10.730> you're

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:10.819 
always the trickiest part when you're

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:12.819 
always the trickiest part when you're
working<00:03:11.120> on<00:03:11.180> a<00:03:11.239> three<00:03:11.510> column<00:03:11.719> layout<00:03:11.870> really

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:12.829 
working on a three column layout really

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:15.129 
working on a three column layout really
come<00:03:13.159> what<00:03:13.489> comes<00:03:13.819> next<00:03:14.180> and<00:03:14.840> I've<00:03:14.959> actually

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:15.139 
come what comes next and I've actually

00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:16.929 
come what comes next and I've actually
got<00:03:15.409> this<00:03:15.590> a<00:03:15.650> little<00:03:16.099> bit<00:03:16.219> backward<00:03:16.669> here<00:03:16.849> in

00:03:16.929 --> 00:03:16.939 
got this a little bit backward here in

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:18.369 
got this a little bit backward here in
the<00:03:17.030> main<00:03:17.209> area<00:03:17.419> this<00:03:17.659> might<00:03:17.840> be<00:03:17.959> our<00:03:17.989> first

00:03:18.369 --> 00:03:18.379 
the main area this might be our first

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:20.890 
the main area this might be our first
instinct<00:03:18.859> to<00:03:18.950> go<00:03:18.980> sidebar<00:03:19.669> on<00:03:19.790> the<00:03:19.819> left<00:03:19.909> main

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
instinct to go sidebar on the left main

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.869 
instinct to go sidebar on the left main
content<00:03:21.499> sidebar<00:03:21.919> on<00:03:22.010> the<00:03:22.069> right<00:03:22.159> however

content sidebar on the right however

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:24.729 
content sidebar on the right however
it's<00:03:23.209> gonna<00:03:23.450> be<00:03:23.629> better<00:03:23.870> for<00:03:24.200> us<00:03:24.260> to<00:03:24.560> actually

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
it's gonna be better for us to actually

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:29.709 
it's gonna be better for us to actually
have<00:03:25.219> our<00:03:25.280> main<00:03:25.730> content<00:03:26.409> as<00:03:27.939> the<00:03:28.939> as<00:03:29.359> the

third out of these three as the third
key<00:03:32.359> element<00:03:32.780> we<00:03:33.169> go<00:03:33.319> sidebar<00:03:33.650> left<00:03:34.129> sidebar

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
key element we go sidebar left sidebar

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:39.550 
key element we go sidebar left sidebar
right<00:03:35.120> then<00:03:35.599> main<00:03:35.840> content<00:03:38.109> so<00:03:39.109> I've<00:03:39.260> got<00:03:39.409> my

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
right then main content so I've got my

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:40.569 
right then main content so I've got my
sidebar<00:03:40.040> left

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:40.579 
sidebar left

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:42.750 
sidebar left
I'm<00:03:40.790> gonna<00:03:40.909> go<00:03:41.030> ahead<00:03:41.090> and<00:03:41.180> copy<00:03:41.510> all<00:03:41.810> of<00:03:41.840> this

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
I'm gonna go ahead and copy all of this

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:49.899 
I'm gonna go ahead and copy all of this
and<00:03:44.379> paste<00:03:46.209> then<00:03:47.209> we'll<00:03:47.359> do<00:03:48.879> sidebar<00:03:49.879> right

00:03:49.899 --> 00:03:49.909 
and paste then we'll do sidebar right

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:52.119 
and paste then we'll do sidebar right
and<00:03:50.629> the<00:03:50.900> width<00:03:51.049> of<00:03:51.079> that<00:03:51.199> right<00:03:51.530> sidebar<00:03:51.799> is

00:03:52.119 --> 00:03:52.129 
and the width of that right sidebar is

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:55.210 
and the width of that right sidebar is
kind<00:03:52.370> of<00:03:52.430> big<00:03:52.639> so<00:03:53.239> go<00:03:53.599> ahead<00:03:53.750> and<00:03:53.840> do<00:03:53.959> a<00:03:54.220> 350

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
kind of big so go ahead and do a 350

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.179 
kind of big so go ahead and do a 350
pixels<00:03:55.419> maybe<00:03:56.419> it's<00:03:56.629> a<00:03:56.659> little<00:03:56.750> aggressive

00:03:57.179 --> 00:03:57.189 
pixels maybe it's a little aggressive

00:03:57.189 --> 00:04:00.309 
pixels maybe it's a little aggressive
250<00:03:58.189> and<00:03:58.519> we'll<00:03:59.120> do<00:03:59.239> background<00:03:59.750> color<00:03:59.959> yellow

00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:00.319 
250 and we'll do background color yellow

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:02.890 
250 and we'll do background color yellow
and<00:04:00.709> a<00:04:01.609> min<00:04:01.759> height<00:04:01.939> five<00:04:02.150> hundred<00:04:02.509> is<00:04:02.599> fine

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
and a min height five hundred is fine

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:07.229 
and a min height five hundred is fine
but<00:04:03.680> very<00:04:04.069> important<00:04:04.609> sidebar<00:04:05.239> left<00:04:05.739> needs<00:04:06.739> to

but very important sidebar left needs to
float<00:04:08.239> to<00:04:08.269> the<00:04:08.569> left<00:04:09.009> sidebar<00:04:10.009> right<00:04:10.639> needs<00:04:11.389> to

float<00:04:12.620> to<00:04:13.459> the<00:04:13.489> right<00:04:13.819> and<00:04:14.150> then<00:04:14.840> that<00:04:15.049> leaves

00:04:15.369 --> 00:04:15.379 
float to the right and then that leaves

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:18.430 
float to the right and then that leaves
us<00:04:15.590> with<00:04:15.769> our<00:04:15.979> main<00:04:16.220> content<00:04:16.880> area<00:04:17.440> main

and<00:05:03.500> if<00:05:03.590> everything<00:05:04.010> works<00:05:04.250> our<00:05:04.790> main<00:05:05.120> content

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:05.660 
and if everything works our main content

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:07.690 
and if everything works our main content
should<00:05:05.900> slide<00:05:06.290> right<00:05:06.860> up<00:05:06.980> in<00:05:07.130> between<00:05:07.370> those

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:07.700 
should slide right up in between those

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:09.700 
should slide right up in between those
two<00:05:07.940> let<00:05:08.570> me<00:05:08.630> go<00:05:08.720> ahead<00:05:08.810> and<00:05:08.960> save<00:05:09.230> that<00:05:09.260> jump

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:09.710 
two let me go ahead and save that jump

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:13.150 
two let me go ahead and save that jump
over<00:05:09.890> to<00:05:09.980> my<00:05:10.010> browser<00:05:11.110> refresh<00:05:12.110> and<00:05:12.800> there<00:05:13.130> we

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:13.160 
over to my browser refresh and there we

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.430 
over to my browser refresh and there we
go<00:05:13.370> so<00:05:13.610> I<00:05:13.640> think<00:05:13.880> I<00:05:14.000> think<00:05:14.300> I<00:05:14.360> need<00:05:14.570> this<00:05:15.140> so<00:05:15.350> you

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:15.440 
go so I think I think I need this so you

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:16.840 
go so I think I think I need this so you
can<00:05:15.590> visualize<00:05:15.920> this<00:05:16.130> I<00:05:16.280> need<00:05:16.460> some<00:05:16.700> of<00:05:16.790> that

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:16.850 
can visualize this I need some of that

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:18.490 
can visualize this I need some of that
min<00:05:17.120> height<00:05:17.360> on<00:05:17.540> there<00:05:17.750> so<00:05:17.960> it<00:05:18.080> looks<00:05:18.140> a<00:05:18.350> little

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:18.500 
min height on there so it looks a little

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:21.190 
min height on there so it looks a little
more<00:05:18.620> realistic<00:05:18.980> and<00:05:19.600> put<00:05:20.600> a<00:05:20.630> min<00:05:20.840> height<00:05:21.050> of

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:21.200 
more realistic and put a min height of

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:24.280 
more realistic and put a min height of
500<00:05:21.650> pixels<00:05:22.100> and<00:05:22.630> there<00:05:23.630> we<00:05:23.720> go<00:05:23.870> and<00:05:24.080> there's

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:24.290 
500 pixels and there we go and there's

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:26.230 
500 pixels and there we go and there's
our<00:05:24.440> three<00:05:24.830> column<00:05:25.340> layout<00:05:25.370> and<00:05:25.970> of<00:05:26.030> course

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:26.240 
our three column layout and of course

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:27.790 
our three column layout and of course
this<00:05:26.390> is<00:05:26.540> a<00:05:26.570> fixed<00:05:26.960> layout<00:05:27.140> because<00:05:27.470> I've<00:05:27.590> set

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:27.800 
this is a fixed layout because I've set

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.370 
this is a fixed layout because I've set
the<00:05:27.920> width<00:05:28.070> to<00:05:28.190> about<00:05:28.400> 1200<00:05:28.940> pixels<00:05:29.380> you

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:30.380 
the width to about 1200 pixels you

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:32.170 
the width to about 1200 pixels you
notice<00:05:30.650> I<00:05:30.770> didn't<00:05:31.040> have<00:05:31.220> to<00:05:31.370> really<00:05:31.670> set<00:05:32.000> the

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:32.180 
notice I didn't have to really set the

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:34.180 
notice I didn't have to really set the
width<00:05:32.330> of<00:05:32.570> that<00:05:32.810> main<00:05:33.080> content<00:05:33.770> I<00:05:33.800> set<00:05:34.070> the

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:34.190 
width of that main content I set the

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:35.350 
width of that main content I set the
width<00:05:34.370> of<00:05:34.490> the<00:05:34.610> sidebars

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:35.360 
width of the sidebars

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:38.560 
width of the sidebars
but<00:05:36.050> the<00:05:36.290> main<00:05:36.740> content<00:05:37.370> just<00:05:37.730> took<00:05:38.270> up<00:05:38.420> as

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:38.570 
but the main content just took up as

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:40.930 
but the main content just took up as
much<00:05:38.750> space<00:05:39.020> as<00:05:39.080> possible<00:05:39.710> making<00:05:39.920> this<00:05:40.160> three

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:40.940 
much space as possible making this three

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:43.060 
much space as possible making this three
column<00:05:41.270> layout<00:05:41.300> also<00:05:42.050> pretty<00:05:42.440> easy<00:05:42.530> to

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:43.070 
column layout also pretty easy to

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:45.460 
column layout also pretty easy to
develop
