00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
so yeah and this is just to confirm this

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.240 
so yeah and this is just to confirm this
is<00:01:46.979> not<00:01:47.280> creative<00:01:48.000> this<00:01:48.180> is<00:01:48.329> survival<00:01:49.040> so<00:01:50.040> and

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
is not creative this is survival so and

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.590 
is not creative this is survival so and
this<00:01:50.280> also<00:01:50.490> works<00:01:50.700> with<00:01:50.880> infinite<00:01:51.270> durability

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
this also works with infinite durability

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.249 
this also works with infinite durability
but<00:01:52.729> kind<00:01:53.729> of<00:01:53.790> just<00:01:54.030> decided<00:01:54.689> not<00:01:54.810> to<00:01:54.990> do<00:01:55.079> it<00:01:55.170> on

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
but kind of just decided not to do it on

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.700 
but kind of just decided not to do it on
infant<00:01:55.530> durability<00:01:55.740> so<00:01:56.070> yeah<00:01:56.329> so<00:01:57.409> here's<00:01:58.409> this

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
infant durability so yeah so here's this

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.850 
infant durability so yeah so here's this
I<00:01:59.640> think<00:02:00.420> it's<00:02:00.540> pretty<00:02:00.750> nice<00:02:00.990> nucor<00:02:01.409> thanks<00:02:01.740> to

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
with it I mean just like and I mean it's

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.460 
with it I mean just like and I mean it's
pretty<00:02:15.030> quick<00:02:15.330> yeah<00:02:15.720> the<00:02:15.900> service<00:02:16.200> starting

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
pretty quick yeah the service starting

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.310 
pretty quick yeah the service starting
to<00:02:16.530> lag<00:02:16.710> now<00:02:16.890> because<00:02:17.160> of<00:02:17.190> all<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:17.460> drops<00:02:18.320> but

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
to lag now because of all the drops but

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.280 
to lag now because of all the drops but
um<00:02:19.530> so<00:02:20.400> and<00:02:21.270> I<00:02:21.420> even<00:02:21.630> going<00:02:21.780> to<00:02:21.840> be<00:02:21.900> resetting

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
um so and I even going to be resetting

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.860 
um so and I even going to be resetting
the<00:02:22.740> render<00:02:23.430> on<00:02:23.610> it<00:02:23.760> or<00:02:24.270> not<00:02:24.420> render<00:02:24.720> the

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
the render on it or not render the

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.200 
the render on it or not render the
distance<00:02:25.440> on<00:02:25.560> it<00:02:25.590> so<00:02:25.980> it<00:02:26.310> won't<00:02:26.550> lag<00:02:26.820> as<00:02:27.030> much

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210 
distance on it so it won't lag as much

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.420 
distance on it so it won't lag as much
because<00:02:27.500> sometimes<00:02:28.500> I've<00:02:28.650> actually<00:02:28.800> earlier

because sometimes I've actually earlier

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:30.980 
because sometimes I've actually earlier

hand or any air diamond sword it would
have<00:03:45.870> gone<00:03:45.900> faster<00:03:46.110> so<00:03:46.500> that's<00:03:46.680> that<00:03:46.860> um<00:03:47.160> insta

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
of third person I mean it's got pretty

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.490 
of third person I mean it's got pretty
much<00:03:58.980> no<00:03:59.160> leg<00:03:59.340> to<00:03:59.370> it<00:03:59.640> at<00:03:59.700> all<00:03:59.790> so<00:04:00.390> and<00:04:00.660> this<00:04:01.380> is

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
much no leg to it at all so and this is

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:02.990 
much no leg to it at all so and this is
with<00:04:01.620> gold<00:04:01.920> tool<00:04:02.160> so<00:04:02.370> I<00:04:02.400> mean<00:04:02.550> it<00:04:02.640> is<00:04:02.730> a<00:04:02.760> little

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
with gold tool so I mean it is a little

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.699 
with gold tool so I mean it is a little
bit<00:04:03.180> quicker<00:04:03.360> but<00:04:03.690> I<00:04:03.750> mean<00:04:03.930> still<00:04:04.260> a<00:04:04.290> diamond

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
bit quicker but I mean still a diamond

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:07.270 
bit quicker but I mean still a diamond
be<00:04:04.980> the<00:04:05.100> same

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
be the same

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.410 
be the same
let's<00:04:07.970> see<00:04:08.300> speed<00:04:08.900> is<00:04:09.200> just<00:04:09.980> under<00:04:10.430> where<00:04:11.390> it

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420 
let's see speed is just under where it

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.780 
let's see speed is just under where it
would<00:04:11.900> be<00:04:12.380> detected<00:04:13.010> by<00:04:13.040> no<00:04:13.160> cheat<00:04:13.550> so<00:04:13.760> that's

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 
would be detected by no cheat so that's

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:17.860 
would be detected by no cheat so that's
cool<00:04:14.090> so<00:04:14.300> I<00:04:14.330> can<00:04:14.510> have<00:04:14.660> it<00:04:14.780> on<00:04:15.940> no<00:04:16.940> fall<00:04:17.209> has<00:04:17.540> a

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
cool so I can have it on no fall has a

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.379 
cool so I can have it on no fall has a
bypass<00:04:18.410> for<00:04:18.709> no<00:04:18.859> cheats<00:04:19.160> so<00:04:19.489> it<00:04:19.760> works<00:04:20.060> it's

00:04:20.379 --> 00:04:20.389 
bypass for no cheats so it works it's

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:22.629 
bypass for no cheats so it works it's
actually<00:04:20.660> the<00:04:20.780> same<00:04:20.810> one<00:04:21.169> that<00:04:21.200> well<00:04:22.070> semi

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:26.210 
I mean I guess I don't know I'll go with

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:27.790 
I mean I guess I don't know I'll go with
it<00:05:26.510> as<00:05:26.630> long<00:05:26.750> as<00:05:26.900> I<00:05:26.990> can<00:05:27.050> until<00:05:27.440> it<00:05:27.650> gets

cracked I don't know I'm sure that will

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.320 
cracked I don't know I'm sure that will
be<00:05:30.470> fast<00:05:31.430> because<00:05:31.669> I'm<00:05:31.880> sure<00:05:32.030> that's<00:05:32.150> gonna<00:05:32.240> be

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:32.330
