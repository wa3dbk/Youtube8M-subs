we're<00:01:04.589> not<00:01:04.739> top<00:01:05.100> there's<00:01:06.000> some<00:01:06.210> on<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.420> bottom

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:06.799 
we're not top there's some on the bottom

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:12.920

going<00:01:07.799> on<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.010> side<00:01:08.280> here<00:01:09.260> down<00:01:10.260> there<00:01:11.930> anyway

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
going on the side here down there anyway

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.530 
going on the side here down there anyway
so<00:01:13.549> and<00:01:14.549> then<00:01:14.700> you<00:01:14.790> start<00:01:15.030> running<00:01:15.119> your<00:01:15.299> hands

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
so and then you start running your hands

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.590 
so and then you start running your hands
along<00:01:15.869> everything<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.650> I<00:01:17.299> feels<00:01:18.299> pretty

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
along everything and I feels pretty

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.840 
along everything and I feels pretty
substantial<00:01:20.210> but<00:01:21.210> on<00:01:21.450> this<00:01:21.720> side<00:01:22.520> this<00:01:23.520> piece

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
substantial but on this side this piece

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.630 
substantial but on this side this piece
comes<00:01:24.600> right<00:01:24.869> on<00:01:24.900> out<00:01:25.229> and<00:01:27.590> there's<00:01:28.590> a<00:01:28.680> new

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
comes right on out and there's a new

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.990 
comes right on out and there's a new
magnet<00:01:30.270> with<00:01:30.810> a<00:01:30.869> nail<00:01:31.079> through<00:01:31.320> it<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:32.000> washer

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
magnet with a nail through it and washer

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.280 
magnet with a nail through it and washer
that's<00:01:33.720> what<00:01:33.990> holds<00:01:34.170> it<00:01:34.320> in<00:01:34.439> place<00:01:34.590> there

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290 
that's what holds it in place there

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.780 
that's what holds it in place there
anyway<00:01:37.290> so<00:01:37.320> then<00:01:37.680> hopefully<00:01:38.430> they'll<00:01:38.579> start

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
anyway so then hopefully they'll start

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.990 
anyway so then hopefully they'll start
trying<00:01:39.030> two<00:01:39.360> different<00:01:39.689> holes<00:01:40.310> and<00:01:41.310> I<00:01:41.640> think

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
trying two different holes and I think

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.850 
trying two different holes and I think
they'll<00:01:42.119> probably<00:01:42.150> go<00:01:42.479> to<00:01:42.540> this<00:01:42.689> first<00:01:43.049> just

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
they'll probably go to this first just

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.770 
they'll probably go to this first just
because<00:01:44.549> it<00:01:44.670> fits<00:01:44.939> them<00:01:45.149> nicely<00:01:47.479> but<00:01:48.479> nothing

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
because it fits them nicely but nothing

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.690 
because it fits them nicely but nothing
really<00:01:48.930> happens<00:01:49.380> when<00:01:49.710> you<00:01:49.829> twist<00:01:50.189> it<00:01:50.369> move<00:01:50.549> it

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
really happens when you twist it move it

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.660 
really happens when you twist it move it
around<00:01:50.759> home<00:01:51.770> then<00:01:52.770> you<00:01:53.220> know<00:01:53.310> just<00:01:53.490> kind<00:01:53.640> of

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
around home then you know just kind of

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.620 
around home then you know just kind of
process<00:01:54.180> of<00:01:54.299> elimination<00:01:56.299> there<00:01:57.299> nothing

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
process of elimination there nothing

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.639 
process of elimination there nothing
here<00:01:59.600> this<00:02:00.600> one<00:02:00.780> on<00:02:00.899> this<00:02:01.079> side<00:02:01.290> nothing

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
here this one on this side nothing

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.569 
here this one on this side nothing
happens

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.920 

once<00:02:06.579> up<00:02:06.790> top<00:02:06.970> there's<00:02:07.210> a<00:02:07.270> few<00:02:07.420> up<00:02:07.509> top<00:02:07.689> but

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:07.930 
once up top there's a few up top but

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.050 
once up top there's a few up top but
this<00:02:08.140> one<00:02:08.410> right<00:02:08.920> here<00:02:09.310> when<00:02:09.489> they<00:02:09.580> put<00:02:09.759> it<00:02:09.849> in

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
this one right here when they put it in

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.089 
this one right here when they put it in
and<00:02:10.989> they'll<00:02:11.140> feel<00:02:11.349> something<00:02:11.770> when<00:02:11.980> they

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:12.099 
and they'll feel something when they

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:15.870 
and they'll feel something when they
give<00:02:12.280> it<00:02:12.400> a<00:02:12.489> nice<00:02:13.300> little<00:02:13.450> push<00:02:14.730> the<00:02:15.730> door
