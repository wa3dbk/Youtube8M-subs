00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:04.779
 The Caribbean is there for a few days a new fun steamers on the way 

00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:06.650
 Oasis of the Seas 

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:12.340
 the largest passenger ship of all time longer than the Queen Mary 2 and 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:17.280
 at full occupancy with over 6000 guests on board and over 2000 men 

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.650
 crew 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.640
 as announced by the American shipping company Royal Caribbean Cruise Line 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.099
 with an unprecedented entertainment offer 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.409
 you have the feeling that you are still on the high seas 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:33.349
 That's just a piece of Las Vegas 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.810
 we are now in a luxury hotel 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:40.810
 on a fairground 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.440
 in a botanical garden 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.440
 or in a huge shopping murder 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.580
 we wanted to go to a ship 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.510
 The elevator takes us to the sixteenth floor 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.550
 So a high-rise 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:00.380
 arrived at the top left the impression we landed in a city, however 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.760
 send in a kind of folk festival 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.210
 then finally the sea 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.150
 and the feeling on the pool deck 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.500
 here are on cruise even if the ship is as wide as one 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.980
 aircraft carrier 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:19.280
 all of these could be problematic in the long run 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.409
 no wonder that the trip is already offered in the supermarket for under 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:26.409
 thousand euros including flight 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.130
 What you would probably distribute on land on several weekends 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.719
 Guests can experience the sport deck in one day and still in good condition 

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:37.590
 sea ​​air 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.280
 a game of golf then a round of basketball and then a try in the 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.280
 surfing 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:03.270
 the leisure offer is overwhelming but it also beats in its fullness 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.520
 the actual sea voyage only secondary the ship itself is the destination 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.420
 even cruise Kemmer was impressed 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.989
 partly also critical 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:15.219
 this ship the US rhein-main 

00:02:15.219 --> 00:02:19.159
 Schaefer was pleased that the first row was the centerpiece 

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:20.479
 becomes 

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:22.359
 of the world 

00:02:22.359 --> 00:02:25.709
 However, there is such an entertainment offer to optimally 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:29.209
 now lead 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:31.269
 Prussia 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:35.330
 i am since be backdeschel heidi cable local old and 

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:38.750
 Normally you go on a cruise and do spontaneously what you feel like 

00:02:38.749 --> 00:02:43.230
 özat it is not for much like the shows you have to register and that 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.469
 I guess they had to do it because there is no other way around so many people 

00:02:46.469 --> 00:02:49.839
 that but that is I think I want to move something tourists first 

00:02:49.839 --> 00:02:53.609
 unfortunately, today we have to get used to seeing six of them in the series the ship is 

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:54.659
 not important 

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:56.239
 that made modern 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:59.799
 Pröll the typical thing one finds in America from to American publishers 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:01.209
 namely not at all 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:03.199
 at the small ones 

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:05.569
 December died on board 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:08.849
 what a little bit bad the rest is for me quite a few meters 

00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:15.009
 Whether the scene is different or not everyone feels different 

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:18.869
 Definitely the boardwalk on Deck 6 is the amusement park for the 

00:03:18.869 --> 00:03:20.769
 whole family designed 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:24.299
 Model are the promenades in English seaside resorts 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:27.109
 Overall, the crowds are distributed on the ship 

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:28.419
 surprisingly good 

00:03:28.419 --> 00:03:31.739
 At lunchtime she gets on board Warg with his various 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:33.919
 Restaurants but quite full 

00:03:33.919 --> 00:03:35.139
 and darts 

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:39.259
 There are 24 different local choices on the Oasis 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:44.029
 The main restaurant serves a set menu every evening 

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:49.929
 good international cuisine is included in the passage price except in the 

00:03:49.929 --> 00:03:52.929
 gourmet-restaurants 

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:56.919
 In fact, there are also areas where the hype is largely 

00:03:56.919 --> 00:04:00.809
 Central Park on Deck 8 is one of them 

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:04.959
 the first garden with real plants on a cruise ship 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:09.829
 Over 2000, they are using a sophisticated irrigation system 

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:12.549
 Kept alive 

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:17.769
 from the bow to the stern, it is over 360 meters as it is called in a labyrinth 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:22.490
 Almost 3,000 cabins to navigate and be good on foot 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:26.949
 The size also has advantages that the cabins show two thirds 

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:28.879
 a balcony 

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:33.229
 if you are lost you will find help on all decks and in an emergency 

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:36.309
 After all, you need lifeboats for almost ten thousand 

00:04:36.309 --> 00:04:40.519
 People Mike Schmid the sizes Klugar security improvements 

00:04:40.519 --> 00:04:41.440
 brought 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:45.210
 they have not just the usual small lifeboats but important ones 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:49.920
 Key players in about 15 feet long five meters wide they move here already 

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:52.840
 16 tons with dry sump lubrication are two engines 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.800
 equipped so it is not really high the efficient ships this 

00:04:58.099 --> 00:05:01.099
 that holds 4 flowers 

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:07.080
 new and unique on a ship is the three are not an issue the way 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.250
 the name suggests 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:11.740
 with rising tide floats up to the next Beck 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:16.720
 though geared towards Earth, the Oasis's outfit has blown class 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:28.740
 In the evening, the pleasure is continued with Broadway Musical 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:31.970
 wants to run with us or is the seventies party 

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:46.490
 when everyone is party downstairs 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:49.000
 then this is the right moment for the project 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.759
 I am very happy 

00:05:50.759 --> 00:05:53.409
 you have that almost for yourself now 

00:05:53.409 --> 00:05:57.119
 barely a trace from the remaining five or six thousand
