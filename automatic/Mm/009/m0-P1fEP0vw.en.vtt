00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:30.860
 an acrobat for nothing is a person 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:32.960
 who has gone into the famous living 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.820
 we saw just before battery cover 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.300
 who made some nice improvements 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:41.239
 I love her image she is fantastic 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:43.520
 it is unfortunately one of the adc of a 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:45.329
 Champions including two shooters the 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.179

 it's bodies who rash gunners 

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:58.199
 so as I said previously it's a 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:00.619
 shooting and uses these little machines 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:04.949
 here it was a flying machine for 

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:08.850
 so shoot him and fight his 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:13.020
 skills sound bal extec bombs at 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.390
 phosphor walkyrie gatling dam of 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.640
 shots 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:20.430
 the latter launching 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.159
 missiles that are very fun to 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.550
 the taught so we start his 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.550
 history 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.960
 for 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:53.210
 his name and corky he is death come 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.430
 from above when hemmerdinger and his 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:58.010
 colleagues yordle quick parts savior 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:00.530
 and devoted themselves to science without 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:02.540
 restriction and immediately brought 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:07.010
 a great contribution to the progress of 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:07.730
 mastures gic layher dle his little them 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:11.030
 have ideas 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:12.680
 korpi the reckless gunner got his 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.380
 title by testing one of their 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.360
 inventions the destructive machine you of 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:20.060
 reconnaissance an assault device 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:23.180
 air become the backbone of 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:26.900
 expeditionary bundle forces between 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:29.420
 parentheses fb the little acronym pretty 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.970
 funny body which is his squadron of 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.580
 snakes flying and humming the eyes of 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:37.310
 valora overseeing the surroundings and 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:42.440
 future acrobatics to great joy 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:44.360
 spectators of all snakes 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.250
 flying body which is the most famous 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.650
 for his bravery and his coolness at 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.900
 fight before the creation of the league 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.700
 he chained the guard towers himself 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.250
 regularly wore volunteers for 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.660
 collect information to deliver 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.810
 messages behind the lines 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:02.360
 enemies he loved the danger is jumped 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.610
 without hesitation at breakfast finally the 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:07.190
 joke to deliver two or three fights 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.630
 morning pilot emeritus body that has 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.750
 also brought several 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:14.870
 changes to his device all of which 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.340
 an arsenal that according to some serves more 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.160
 to impress the gallery because actually 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:21.140
 fight at the creation of the league the 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.640
 hostilities ceased gap which had 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.870
 to retire 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.659
 shut off the engine 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:30.080
 parenthesis as he said he tried to 

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:31.970
 live other thrills by 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:35.000
 just doing acrobatics or 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:36.799
 races in your canyon but nothing 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.349
 could make him forget the sweet scent 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:41.870
 powder on the day hemmerdinger 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:43.549
 joined the league of legends corps 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.920
 who followed him naturally in a hurry 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:53.360
 to compete with the best warriors of the 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:54.500
 world then of all the bins round of 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.660
 characters that I read up 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.879
 now I think this one is the 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:02.390
 more off the mark than anything we've seen 

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:04.400
 here in fact we have a kind of pilot 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:07.190
 in fact so I summarize a little bit 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:09.340
 body that goes out yordle two bundles 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:11.690
 you can see on the map 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.609
 and from what I understand so in 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:18.410
 did he went to battery tower with 

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:21.320
 erding hours so and his colleagues for 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:23.390
 so with ideas for building 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:26.330
 things to help them fight when 

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:28.400
 during rune wars I do not know 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:32.810
 which region they represent between 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:34.400
 tower or yordle batteries finally bundle 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:37.460
 sorry I do not know 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:40.420
 it's to see and so in fact he has 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:42.740
 built him a plane to fly and 

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:44.960
 so he designed a squadron 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:47.840
 seemingly nonstop and that's called 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:49.610
 the snakes flying and so they 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.210
 skim the heavens you can see 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:53.190
 by the way on that 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:56.430
 first pages are first skins you 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:59.970
 can see behind a zeppelin 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:02.310
 which by the way thorns I do not think 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:05.009
 that there was in valora finally side 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:06.750
 we do not know but you can finally see 

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:08.490
 I do not know if his squadron those who 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:09.660
 pull behind it makes me think a 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:12.389
 little bit to the second world war 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:13.800
 and all that finally it's surely wanted and 

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:17.160
 my favorite movie you will understand 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:19.590
 these bodies that I love her dragon 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:21.389
 that's all so unfortunately I did 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:22.740
 not a lot of information about him 

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:24.599
 because it's one of the characters where we 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:27.030
 has the least information it is a 

00:05:24.599 --> 00:05:28.919
 character who is very discreet I can 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:31.740
 tell you for example sometimes he says 

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:35.060
 foxtrot as charlie foxtrot 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:37.889
 in fact these are aviator quotes 

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:39.860
 of argol arcaut airmen who are 

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:42.690
 many used 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:44.370
 I'm done for this champion then been 

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:47.280
 mainly that body that knows it 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:49.020
 there is an aviator who love the sensations 

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:50.729
 strong and the audience 

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:52.199
 so he's served in the league of 

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:53.520
 legends since you know that league of 

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:56.340
 legends it's a bit like in ringer 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:59.099
 games or else it's an arena where the 

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:01.380
 public look I wish you a 

00:05:59.099 --> 00:06:04.880
 good day and see you soon for a 

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:04.880
 next champion that ubaye
