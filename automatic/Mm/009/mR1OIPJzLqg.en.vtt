know<00:00:20.330> about<00:00:21.330> our<00:00:21.510> hurricane<00:00:22.199> to<00:00:22.710> be<00:00:22.830> Paula

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:23.750 
know about our hurricane to be Paula

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.140 
know about our hurricane to be Paula
it's<00:00:24.750> a<00:00:24.810> tropical<00:00:25.019> storm<00:00:25.380> that<00:00:26.099> they<00:00:26.519> say<00:00:26.789> and

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
it's a tropical storm that they say and

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.540 
it's a tropical storm that they say and
I<00:00:27.990> think<00:00:28.199> it<00:00:28.320> probably<00:00:28.349> is<00:00:28.949> but<00:00:29.160> it's<00:00:29.310> very

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
I think it probably is but it's very

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.490 
I think it probably is but it's very
close<00:00:29.820> to<00:00:29.849> becoming<00:00:30.300> a<00:00:30.449> hurricane<00:00:30.900> so<00:00:31.260> let's

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
close to becoming a hurricane so let's

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.170 
close to becoming a hurricane so let's
get<00:00:31.679> right<00:00:31.890> to<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.189> maps<00:00:32.399> and<00:00:32.730> take<00:00:32.910> a<00:00:32.940> look

i<00:00:59.820> would<00:01:00.059> have<00:01:00.149> I<00:01:00.270> would<00:01:00.449> imagine<00:01:00.960> that

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
i would have I would imagine that

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.850 
i would have I would imagine that
tonight<00:01:02.219> it's<00:01:02.430> going<00:01:02.640> to<00:01:02.850> become<00:01:03.000> a<00:01:03.149> hurricane

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
tonight it's going to become a hurricane

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.010 
tonight it's going to become a hurricane
that's<00:01:04.860> what<00:01:05.010> I<00:01:05.070> believes<00:01:05.339> gonna<00:01:05.460> happen<00:01:06.020> ok

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
that's what I believes gonna happen ok

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.250 
that's what I believes gonna happen ok
let's<00:01:07.260> go<00:01:07.439> on<00:01:07.619> and<00:01:07.799> look<00:01:07.920> at<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.310> current

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:09.260 
let's go on and look at the current

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.010 
let's go on and look at the current
infrared<00:01:10.260> satellite<00:01:11.130> picture<00:01:11.460> of<00:01:11.580> it<00:01:11.810> ok<00:01:12.810> the

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
infrared satellite picture of it ok the

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.330 
infrared satellite picture of it ok the
center<00:01:13.439> is<00:01:13.770> roughly<00:01:14.580> right<00:01:14.850> in<00:01:15.060> here<00:01:16.100> ok<00:01:17.100> or

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
center is roughly right in here ok or

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.980 
center is roughly right in here ok or
even<00:01:17.729> a<00:01:17.790> little<00:01:17.939> bit<00:01:18.030> further<00:01:18.270> south<00:01:18.600> maybe

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
even a little bit further south maybe

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.749 
even a little bit further south maybe
right<00:01:19.229> here<00:01:19.259> it's<00:01:19.680> it's<00:01:19.890> close<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.610> coast

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
right here it's it's close to the coast

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.929 
right here it's it's close to the coast
and<00:01:21.290> but<00:01:22.290> it's<00:01:22.409> it's<00:01:22.799> quickly<00:01:23.100> moving<00:01:23.460> up<00:01:23.790> in

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
and but it's it's quickly moving up in

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.929 
and but it's it's quickly moving up in
this<00:01:24.090> direction<00:01:24.270> and<00:01:25.310> will<00:01:26.310> come<00:01:26.490> very<00:01:26.670> close

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
this direction and will come very close

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.469 
this direction and will come very close
to<00:01:27.500> Cozumel<00:01:28.500> and<00:01:29.060> that<00:01:30.060> general<00:01:30.390> area

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
to Cozumel and that general area

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.179 
to Cozumel and that general area
probably<00:01:30.990> as<00:01:31.770> my<00:01:32.280> guess<00:01:32.549> is<00:01:32.790> as<00:01:33.150> a<00:01:33.770> category<00:01:34.770> 2

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
probably as my guess is as a category 2

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.969 
probably as my guess is as a category 2
or<00:01:35.460> 3<00:01:35.729> hurricane<00:01:36.079> by<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.170> time<00:01:37.409> it<00:01:37.560> gets<00:01:37.650> up<00:01:37.829> in

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
or 3 hurricane by the time it gets up in

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.690 
or 3 hurricane by the time it gets up in
their<00:01:38.100> area<00:01:39.170> ok<00:01:40.170> let<00:01:40.799> me<00:01:40.829> see<00:01:41.189> let<00:01:41.220> me<00:01:41.430> take

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
their area ok let me see let me take

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.039 
their area ok let me see let me take
these<00:01:41.880> off<00:01:42.270> of<00:01:42.509> here<00:01:42.720> and<00:01:44.270> let's<00:01:45.270> move<00:01:45.509> on<00:01:45.750> to

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
these off of here and let's move on to

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.850 
these off of here and let's move on to
our<00:01:46.500> next<00:01:46.619> map<00:01:47.100> and<00:01:48.020> this<00:01:49.020> is<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.350> water<00:01:49.560> vapor

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
our next map and this is the water vapor

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.969 
our next map and this is the water vapor
imagery<00:01:50.399> and<00:01:50.790> it<00:01:51.750> does<00:01:51.990> look<00:01:52.259> like<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.649> center

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
imagery and it does look like the center

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.789 
imagery and it does look like the center
is<00:01:53.509> trades<00:01:54.509> trying<00:01:54.810> to<00:01:54.960> develop<00:01:55.170> an<00:01:55.380> eye<00:01:55.500> right

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
is trades trying to develop an eye right

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.969 
is trades trying to develop an eye right
in<00:01:55.860> this<00:01:56.040> area<00:01:57.259> roughly<00:01:58.259> I'm<00:01:58.590> not<00:01:58.710> very<00:01:58.860> good

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
in this area roughly I'm not very good

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.179 
in this area roughly I'm not very good
at<00:01:59.100> drawing<00:01:59.340> these<00:01:59.549> things<00:02:00.439> ok<00:02:01.439> Josh<00:02:01.740> was<00:02:01.979> much

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
at drawing these things ok Josh was much

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.859 
at drawing these things ok Josh was much
better<00:02:02.369> than<00:02:02.579> I<00:02:02.700> am<00:02:02.880> at<00:02:03.000> this<00:02:03.149> that's<00:02:03.509> better

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
better than I am at this that's better

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.440 
better than I am at this that's better
ok<00:02:04.399> anyway<00:02:05.399> it<00:02:05.520> looks<00:02:05.579> like<00:02:05.880> it's<00:02:06.060> forming<00:02:06.360> an

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
ok anyway it looks like it's forming an

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.010 
ok anyway it looks like it's forming an
eye<00:02:06.540> and<00:02:07.610> I<00:02:08.610> always<00:02:09.060> like<00:02:09.179> looking<00:02:09.360> into<00:02:09.750> water

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
eye and I always like looking into water

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.080 
eye and I always like looking into water
vapor<00:02:10.349> imagery<00:02:11.009> because<00:02:11.310> it<00:02:11.730> gives<00:02:11.849> you<00:02:12.030> a

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
vapor imagery because it gives you a

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.620 
vapor imagery because it gives you a
better<00:02:12.300> picture<00:02:12.660> of<00:02:12.870> what's<00:02:13.230> going<00:02:13.290> on

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
better picture of what's going on

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.900 
better picture of what's going on
in<00:02:13.810> the<00:02:13.900> overall<00:02:14.350> structure<00:02:15.160> of<00:02:15.310> the<00:02:15.580> storm

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
in the overall structure of the storm

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.530 
in the overall structure of the storm
with<00:02:16.870> the<00:02:16.900> moisture<00:02:17.710> content<00:02:17.920> etc<00:02:18.400> and<00:02:19.090> as<00:02:19.420> you

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
with the moisture content etc and as you

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:20.690 
with the moisture content etc and as you
can<00:02:19.660> see<00:02:19.690> it<00:02:19.990> has<00:02:20.080> plenty<00:02:20.440> of<00:02:20.500> moisture

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
can see it has plenty of moisture

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.540 
can see it has plenty of moisture
wrapped<00:02:21.700> well<00:02:21.970> around<00:02:22.240> the<00:02:22.360> center<00:02:22.690> and

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
wrapped well around the center and

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.280 
wrapped well around the center and
outflow<00:02:24.550> is<00:02:24.580> going<00:02:25.090> is<00:02:25.270> going<00:02:25.630> very<00:02:25.900> well<00:02:26.080> for

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
outflow is going is going very well for

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.580 
outflow is going is going very well for
for<00:02:26.920> this<00:02:27.040> storm<00:02:27.340> and<00:02:28.110> everything<00:02:29.110> is<00:02:29.320> is

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
for this storm and everything is is

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.290 
for this storm and everything is is
favorable<00:02:30.220> for<00:02:30.250> this<00:02:30.550> to<00:02:30.700> continue<00:02:30.880> to

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
favorable for this to continue to

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.980 
favorable for this to continue to
strengthen<00:02:32.820> ok<00:02:33.820> let's<00:02:34.120> go<00:02:34.300> on<00:02:34.330> and<00:02:34.720> look<00:02:34.840> at

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:34.990 
strengthen ok let's go on and look at

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:38.100 
strengthen ok let's go on and look at
the<00:02:35.370> projected<00:02:36.370> path<00:02:36.610> by<00:02:37.030> the<00:02:37.110> National

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
the projected path by the National

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.800 
the projected path by the National
Hurricane<00:02:38.290> Center<00:02:38.880> as<00:02:39.880> you<00:02:40.090> can<00:02:40.270> see<00:02:40.510> they

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
Hurricane Center as you can see they

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.750 
Hurricane Center as you can see they
don't<00:02:41.200> have<00:02:41.500> a<00:02:41.530> whole<00:02:41.860> lot<00:02:41.890> of<00:02:42.130> a<00:02:42.190> clue<00:02:42.430> where

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
don't have a whole lot of a clue where

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.630 
don't have a whole lot of a clue where
it's<00:02:42.940> going<00:02:43.090> to<00:02:43.120> go<00:02:43.890> this<00:02:44.890> is<00:02:45.070> pretty<00:02:45.280> certain

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
it's going to go this is pretty certain

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.710 
it's going to go this is pretty certain
up<00:02:46.420> in<00:02:46.660> here<00:02:47.490> this<00:02:48.490> part<00:02:48.760> is<00:02:48.850> very<00:02:48.940> certain<00:02:49.480> up

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
to go if I lived in the very southern

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.790 
to go if I lived in the very southern
most<00:02:57.520> part<00:02:57.880> of<00:02:58.000> south<00:02:58.660> florida<00:02:58.690> in<00:02:59.380> that

general area of miami southward to the
keys<00:03:02.890> i<00:03:03.190> would<00:03:03.370> keep<00:03:03.790> a<00:03:03.940> very<00:03:04.090> close<00:03:04.390> eye<00:03:04.630> on

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
keys i would keep a very close eye on

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.270 
keys i would keep a very close eye on
this<00:03:04.900> baby<00:03:05.110> because<00:03:05.470> it's<00:03:05.500> it<00:03:05.920> could<00:03:06.100> very

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
this baby because it's it could very

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.910 
this baby because it's it could very
well<00:03:06.340> be<00:03:06.700> at<00:03:07.480> least<00:03:07.810> a<00:03:07.930> category<00:03:08.410> three<00:03:08.710> when

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
well be at least a category three when

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.400 
well be at least a category three when
it<00:03:09.040> hits<00:03:09.190> that<00:03:09.340> area<00:03:09.930> all<00:03:10.930> the<00:03:11.200> water

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
it hits that area all the water

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.240 
it hits that area all the water
temperatures<00:03:11.950> are<00:03:12.160> still<00:03:12.580> very<00:03:12.790> warm<00:03:13.120> and

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
temperatures are still very warm and

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:19.080 
temperatures are still very warm and
let's<00:03:15.250> see<00:03:15.490> let's<00:03:15.760> go<00:03:15.910> ahead<00:03:16.030> and<00:03:16.150> look<00:03:16.360> at<00:03:18.090> let

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
let's see let's go ahead and look at let

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.050 
let's see let's go ahead and look at let
me<00:03:19.270> see<00:03:19.540> which<00:03:19.750> one<00:03:19.960> we<00:03:20.050> want<00:03:20.080> to<00:03:20.290> look<00:03:20.350> at<00:03:20.530> next

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
me see which one we want to look at next

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.820 
me see which one we want to look at next
okay<00:03:22.060> yeah<00:03:22.270> here's<00:03:22.510> the<00:03:22.570> projected<00:03:23.170> path<00:03:23.440> put

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:23.830 
okay yeah here's the projected path put

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:25.140 
okay yeah here's the projected path put
out<00:03:23.950> by<00:03:24.130> the<00:03:24.160> weather<00:03:24.610> on<00:03:24.850> the<00:03:24.910> weather

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
out by the weather on the weather

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:26.880 
out by the weather on the weather
channel<00:03:25.240> which<00:03:26.020> I<00:03:26.200> believe<00:03:26.410> they<00:03:26.530> get<00:03:26.710> from

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
channel which I believe they get from

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.720 
channel which I believe they get from
the<00:03:26.980> National<00:03:27.280> Hurricane<00:03:27.400> Center<00:03:27.610> they<00:03:28.270> do<00:03:28.620> as

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
the National Hurricane Center they do as

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.100 
the National Hurricane Center they do as
you<00:03:30.730> can<00:03:30.850> see<00:03:31.120> they're<00:03:31.360> thinking<00:03:31.750> winds<00:03:31.960> are

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110 
you can see they're thinking winds are

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:33.780 
you can see they're thinking winds are
going<00:03:32.230> to<00:03:32.290> be<00:03:32.410> relatively<00:03:32.830> weak<00:03:33.160> 80<00:03:33.460> miles<00:03:33.670> per

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
going to be relatively weak 80 miles per

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.900 
going to be relatively weak 80 miles per
hour<00:03:34.000> blah<00:03:34.540> blah<00:03:34.920> but<00:03:35.920> it's<00:03:36.400> going<00:03:36.550> to<00:03:36.670> be<00:03:36.730> hard

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
hour blah blah but it's going to be hard

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:38.790 
hour blah blah but it's going to be hard
to<00:03:37.030> tell<00:03:37.270> exactly<00:03:37.570> what<00:03:38.230> the<00:03:38.260> strength<00:03:38.650> of

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:38.800 
to tell exactly what the strength of

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:43.730 
to tell exactly what the strength of
this<00:03:38.950> is<00:03:39.280> going<00:03:39.580> to<00:03:39.700> be<00:03:39.880> in<00:03:40.540> all<00:03:41.170> eventualities

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:43.740 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:46.590 

because<00:03:44.740> the<00:03:45.340> steering<00:03:46.000> currents<00:03:46.330> are<00:03:46.480> rather

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:46.600 
because the steering currents are rather

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.510 
because the steering currents are rather
waking<00:03:47.110> here<00:03:47.290> right<00:03:47.500> now<00:03:47.740> but<00:03:48.130> the<00:03:48.280> water

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:48.520 
waking here right now but the water

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.699 
waking here right now but the water
temperatures<00:03:49.030> in<00:03:49.240> this<00:03:49.420> whole<00:03:49.660> area<00:03:50.020> are

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
temperatures in this whole area are

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:54.440 
temperatures in this whole area are
still<00:03:51.459> in<00:03:51.760> the<00:03:51.880> mid-80s<00:03:52.209> ok<00:03:53.050> very<00:03:53.380> warm<00:03:53.770> and

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
still in the mid-80s ok very warm and

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.360 
still in the mid-80s ok very warm and
can<00:03:55.450> easily<00:03:55.750> sustain<00:03:56.290> this<00:03:56.680> this<00:03:57.010> thing<00:03:57.040> and

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
can easily sustain this this thing and

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.760 
can easily sustain this this thing and
help<00:03:57.459> it<00:03:57.640> strengthen<00:03:57.840> so<00:03:58.840> i<00:03:59.140> won't<00:03:59.410> imagine

00:03:59.760 --> 00:03:59.770 
help it strengthen so i won't imagine

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:00.690 
help it strengthen so i won't imagine
winds<00:03:59.980> are<00:04:00.040> going<00:04:00.100> to<00:04:00.220> be<00:04:00.280> much<00:04:00.400> higher<00:04:00.640> than

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
winds are going to be much higher than

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.130 
winds are going to be much higher than
what<00:04:01.060> they're<00:04:01.209> showing<00:04:01.240> here<00:04:01.690> up<00:04:01.870> in<00:04:02.020> this

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.140 
what they're showing here up in this

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.620 
what they're showing here up in this
area<00:04:02.970> they're<00:04:03.970> going<00:04:04.090> to<00:04:04.150> be<00:04:04.240> higher<00:04:04.420> than

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630 
area they're going to be higher than

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:09.690 
area they're going to be higher than
that<00:04:04.810> and<00:04:05.820> i<00:04:06.820> believe<00:04:07.770> that<00:04:08.770> we<00:04:09.370> will<00:04:09.490> have<00:04:09.550> a

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
that and i believe that we will have a

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.270 
that and i believe that we will have a
whole<00:04:09.940> bunch<00:04:10.090> a<00:04:10.360> whole<00:04:10.540> lot<00:04:10.780> of<00:04:10.810> excuse<00:04:11.680> me<00:04:11.890> a

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 
thing is going to eventually go there is

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:23.070 
thing is going to eventually go there is
a<00:04:20.830> trough<00:04:21.310> coming<00:04:21.760> down<00:04:22.000> in<00:04:22.330> the<00:04:22.479> United

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
a trough coming down in the United

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.380 
a trough coming down in the United

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:25.390 
States I don't have that map on here but

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:26.930 
States I don't have that map on here but
there<00:04:25.990> is<00:04:26.110> a<00:04:26.140> trough

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
there is a trough

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:28.520 
there is a trough
trough<00:04:27.180> coming<00:04:27.540> down<00:04:27.690> the<00:04:28.050> United<00:04:28.350> States

trough coming down the United States

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.650 
trough coming down the United States
it's<00:04:28.800> going<00:04:28.950> to<00:04:29.010> probably<00:04:29.250> move<00:04:29.940> it<00:04:30.180> is<00:04:30.330> going

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 
it's going to probably move it is going

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.330 
it's going to probably move it is going
to<00:04:30.810> move<00:04:30.930> into<00:04:31.110> the<00:04:31.290> Gulf<00:04:31.590> of<00:04:31.710> Mexico<00:04:32.130> not

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
to move into the Gulf of Mexico not

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.000 
to move into the Gulf of Mexico not
probably<00:04:32.760> and<00:04:33.120> but<00:04:34.050> how<00:04:34.200> far<00:04:34.530> south<00:04:34.770> that

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.010 
probably and but how far south that

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:36.470 
probably and but how far south that
comes<00:04:35.190> in<00:04:35.310> the<00:04:35.370> Gulf<00:04:35.610> will<00:04:35.760> happen<00:04:36.030> just<00:04:36.180> see

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:36.480 
comes in the Gulf will happen just see

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:39.650 
comes in the Gulf will happen just see
and<00:04:36.810> if<00:04:37.800> this<00:04:38.250> grabs<00:04:38.640> it<00:04:38.940> and<00:04:38.970> picks<00:04:39.360> it<00:04:39.510> up

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.660 
and if this grabs it and picks it up

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:43.270 
and if this grabs it and picks it up
once<00:04:40.410> it<00:04:40.590> gets<00:04:40.770> up<00:04:40.950> in<00:04:41.130> this<00:04:41.280> area<00:04:41.660> up<00:04:42.660> in<00:04:42.900> here

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:43.280 
once it gets up in this area up in here

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:46.370 
once it gets up in this area up in here
that's<00:04:44.280> when<00:04:44.520> the<00:04:44.700> trough<00:04:44.940> could<00:04:45.380> start

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380 
that's when the trough could start

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.380 
that's when the trough could start
tugging<00:04:46.620> on<00:04:46.860> it<00:04:46.920> and<00:04:47.250> that's<00:04:47.760> when<00:04:48.000> I<00:04:48.030> believe

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:48.390 
tugging on it and that's when I believe

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:49.790 
tugging on it and that's when I believe
that<00:04:48.600> it<00:04:48.690> can<00:04:48.840> head<00:04:48.990> off<00:04:49.020> towards<00:04:49.560> South

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
that it can head off towards South

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.560 
that it can head off towards South
Florida<00:04:50.340> and<00:04:50.520> then<00:04:50.670> of<00:04:50.760> course<00:04:50.790> across<00:04:51.210> South

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:51.570 
Florida and then of course across South

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:53.780 
Florida and then of course across South
Florida<00:04:51.600> out<00:04:52.230> into<00:04:52.500> the<00:04:52.620> Atlantic<00:04:53.040> and<00:04:53.190> then

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:53.790 
Florida out into the Atlantic and then

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:58.430 
Florida out into the Atlantic and then
go<00:04:54.000> bye-bye<00:04:54.360> and<00:04:54.570> be<00:04:54.660> a<00:04:54.690> fish<00:04:54.960> storm<00:04:57.170> but<00:04:58.170> that

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.440 
go bye-bye and be a fish storm but that

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.310 
go bye-bye and be a fish storm but that
remains<00:04:58.740> to<00:04:58.950> be<00:04:58.980> seen<00:04:59.310> and<00:05:00.240> I<00:05:00.510> apologize<00:05:01.080> for

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.320

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:16.290 
included in that which they should be

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:18.710 
included in that which they should be
and<00:05:16.560> what<00:05:17.280> really<00:05:17.550> surprises<00:05:17.970> me<00:05:18.180> about<00:05:18.330> this

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 
and what really surprises me about this

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:21.870 
storm is that are actually about the the

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:23.360 
storm is that are actually about the the
National<00:05:22.260> Hurricane<00:05:22.440> Center<00:05:22.680> and<00:05:23.070> I<00:05:23.100> don't

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370 
National Hurricane Center and I don't

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:25.370 
National Hurricane Center and I don't
understand<00:05:23.880> why<00:05:24.030> they<00:05:24.210> do<00:05:24.270> this<00:05:24.600> but<00:05:25.260> they

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:25.380 
understand why they do this but they

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:26.390 
understand why they do this but they
should<00:05:25.620> have<00:05:25.740> sent<00:05:25.950> a<00:05:26.040> reconnaissance

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 
should have sent a reconnaissance

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.000 
should have sent a reconnaissance
aircraft<00:05:26.820> out<00:05:27.300> there<00:05:27.330> yesterday<00:05:27.740> the<00:05:28.740> moment

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:29.010 
aircraft out there yesterday the moment

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:31.130 
aircraft out there yesterday the moment
they<00:05:29.250> they<00:05:29.730> tell<00:05:30.180> us<00:05:30.300> anything<00:05:30.570> it<00:05:30.960> goes

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:31.140 
they they tell us anything it goes

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:32.630 
they they tell us anything it goes
straight<00:05:31.440> from<00:05:31.620> just<00:05:31.919> being<00:05:32.100> a<00:05:32.250> low-pressure

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:32.640 
straight from just being a low-pressure

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:36.260 
straight from just being a low-pressure
area<00:05:33.120> to<00:05:33.330> almost<00:05:33.780> a<00:05:33.960> hurricane<00:05:34.970> that's<00:05:35.970> just

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:36.270 
area to almost a hurricane that's just

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:38.810 
area to almost a hurricane that's just
ridiculous<00:05:36.810> in<00:05:37.230> my<00:05:37.260> book<00:05:37.620> they<00:05:38.490> should<00:05:38.730> have

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:38.820 
ridiculous in my book they should have

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:40.010 
ridiculous in my book they should have
been<00:05:38.850> out<00:05:39.090> there<00:05:39.120> yesterday<00:05:39.540> with<00:05:39.990> the

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:40.020 
been out there yesterday with the

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:41.540 
been out there yesterday with the
reconnaissance<00:05:40.440> aircraft<00:05:40.860> and<00:05:41.460> they

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:41.550 
reconnaissance aircraft and they

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:42.890 
reconnaissance aircraft and they
probably<00:05:41.820> would<00:05:42.180> have<00:05:42.240> found<00:05:42.480> that<00:05:42.780> it<00:05:42.870> was

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:42.900 
probably would have found that it was

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:44.870 
probably would have found that it was
already<00:05:43.320> a<00:05:43.470> minimal<00:05:43.860> tropical<00:05:44.310> storm<00:05:44.580> or<00:05:44.820> a

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:44.880 
already a minimal tropical storm or a

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:49.970 
already a minimal tropical storm or a
depression<00:05:46.190> so<00:05:48.080> why<00:05:49.080> they<00:05:49.290> keep<00:05:49.470> doing<00:05:49.680> that

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:49.980 
depression so why they keep doing that

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:51.560 
depression so why they keep doing that
why<00:05:50.280> they've<00:05:50.460> been<00:05:50.580> doing<00:05:50.820> that<00:05:50.880> all<00:05:50.940> all<00:05:51.270> of

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:51.570 
why they've been doing that all all of

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:53.090 
why they've been doing that all all of
this<00:05:51.720> hurricane<00:05:52.110> season<00:05:52.500> I<00:05:52.560> haven't<00:05:52.919> haven't

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:53.100 
this hurricane season I haven't haven't

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:56.680 
this hurricane season I haven't haven't
a<00:05:53.220> clue<00:05:53.340> I<00:05:53.640> don't<00:05:54.000> understand<00:05:54.540> it<00:05:54.720> but<00:05:55.470> anyway

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:56.690 
a clue I don't understand it but anyway

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:59.030 
a clue I don't understand it but anyway
that's<00:05:57.690> about<00:05:58.080> it<00:05:58.110> for<00:05:58.260> our<00:05:58.440> tropical<00:05:58.680> update

00:05:59.030 --> 00:05:59.040 
that's about it for our tropical update
