00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
the army back then let's try this other

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:29.930 
the army back then let's try this other
accessory<00:04:27.140> and<00:04:28.140> then<00:04:29.070> this<00:04:29.190> other<00:04:29.400> accessory

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940

Thor<00:04:30.180> comes<00:04:30.420> with<00:04:30.630> is<00:04:30.840> this<00:04:31.050> lightning

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
Thor comes with is this lightning

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.320 
Thor comes with is this lightning
launcher<00:04:32.190> what<00:04:32.370> I<00:04:32.520> guess<00:04:32.790> it's<00:04:33.000> better<00:04:33.150> at

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
launcher what I guess it's better at

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.630 
launcher what I guess it's better at
launching<00:04:33.660> lightning<00:04:33.990> at<00:04:34.110> his<00:04:34.260> butt<00:04:34.530> so<00:04:35.130> let's

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:35.640 
launching lightning at his butt so let's

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.970 
launching lightning at his butt so let's
see<00:04:35.790> how<00:04:36.240> this<00:04:36.420> works<00:04:36.720> I<00:04:36.930> guess<00:04:37.110> it<00:04:37.260> snaps<00:04:37.650> onto

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:37.980 
see how this works I guess it snaps onto

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:41.750 
see how this works I guess it snaps onto
his<00:04:38.450> forearm<00:04:39.450> here<00:04:39.840> and<00:04:40.560> then<00:04:40.710> you<00:04:40.860> you<00:04:41.520> put

this simulated lightning bolt into the
launcher<00:04:45.510> and<00:04:45.860> now<00:04:46.860> he's<00:04:47.160> ready<00:04:47.400> to<00:04:47.460> lots<00:04:47.730> my
