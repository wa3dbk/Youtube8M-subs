00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.210
 the truth 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:11.129
 in this second arpeggios video we go 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:15.030
 to work the sixteenths and the six and 

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:17.160
 the semicorcheas are four notes in 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.960
 one time and the six children are six 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.210
 notes in a while let's do the 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.950
 exercise on the flamenco cadence in 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.349
 hue of talant ah but let's 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:28.079
 do it with open chords of the 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:31.919
 minor position on the fret 7 the 

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:35.850
 we will do open without the 

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:39.060
 position of the major on the 5th fret the 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.850
 we will open also without a nut 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:44.910
 from the position on the 3rd fret of sun 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.340
 we will do it the same without a nut and 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.040
 the position of F held higher the 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.720
 we will also do without a broom with these 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.850
 four positions we have the cadence 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:56.469
 flamenco with open chords 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.449
 I will first make the example of 

00:00:56.469 --> 00:01:01.420
 sixteenths and we will do it in the same way 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:04.180
 that in video 1 annul in the first 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:07.280
 medium in the second index in the third 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:12.799
 and thumb in the sixth 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:17.540
 thumb index finger in the fifth 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:21.680
 the same middle ring thumb and on the 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:25.210
 fourth the same place annular mean 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:28.100
 index and on the fifth ring thumb 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:31.120
 medium 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:34.230
 we will do the same in the lab 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:37.320
 in the sun and in the sharp f 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:39.770
 the second combination we will make it 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:46.700
 same way but 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:52.159
 thumb and half descendant have hello 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:54.610
 in the fifth vulgar and half annular the 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:54.610
 quarter 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:59.259
 and in the fifth thumb 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.509
 the same in the four positions of the 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:10.739
 flamenco cadence I will explain now 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:13.379
 the six seals of the same form the annular 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:15.840
 in the first medium in the second index 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:18.640
 in the third and thumb in the sixth now 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:24.900
 we have to make six notes 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:30.720
 in each time thumb index and annular 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:30.720
 medium and the same with the fifth 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.439
 the same with the 4th 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:49.620
 and the same with the fifth again and this 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.470
 we will do it in the four 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:55.340
 positions of the flamenco cadence 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:03:01.580
 what marks the times is the thumb 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:01.580
 four times four thumbs one 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:05.489
 two 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:12.490
 4 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:19.180
 I will now make some examples with 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.180
 metronome 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.980
 2. 3 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:14.130
 all right 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:54.490
 in 23 

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:43.330
 1 2 3 and 1 2 3 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:55.670
 and 

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:01.030
 d 

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:21.050
 1 2 3 and 1 2 3 

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:29.060
 m 

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:40.870
 d 

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:47.070
 d 

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.870
 that is to say
