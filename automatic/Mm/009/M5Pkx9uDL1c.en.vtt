in<00:02:59.810> a<00:02:59.870> video<00:03:00.040> this<00:03:01.040> is<00:03:01.099> definitely<00:03:01.489> compatible

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
in a video this is definitely compatible

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.240 
in a video this is definitely compatible
with<00:03:02.150> all<00:03:02.269> the<00:03:02.390> devices<00:03:02.660> all<00:03:03.650> right<00:03:03.860> we<00:03:04.069> are<00:03:04.220> in

with all the devices all right we are in
agree<00:03:04.549> to<00:03:04.610> now<00:03:04.819> with<00:03:05.299> another<00:03:05.810> adapter<00:03:06.319> that

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
agree to now with another adapter that

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.410 
agree to now with another adapter that
sort<00:03:06.769> of<00:03:06.860> looks<00:03:07.069> a<00:03:07.220> little<00:03:07.310> weird<00:03:07.610> I<00:03:07.880> know<00:03:08.239> how

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
sort of looks a little weird I know how

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:09.850 
sort of looks a little weird I know how
to<00:03:08.510> call<00:03:08.690> this<00:03:08.750> one<00:03:08.900> but<00:03:09.140> this<00:03:09.260> is<00:03:09.410> the<00:03:09.530> one<00:03:09.650> for

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:09.860 
to call this one but this is the one for

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:11.710 
to call this one but this is the one for
Europe<00:03:10.250> so<00:03:11.000> this<00:03:11.209> is<00:03:11.329> the<00:03:11.420> one<00:03:11.540> that's

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
Europe so this is the one that's

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.080

to go to Europe the summer so I had to
bring<00:03:22.549> a<00:03:22.670> power<00:03:22.819> adapter<00:03:23.299> because<00:03:23.510> it<00:03:23.660> is

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
bring a power adapter because it is

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.930 
bring a power adapter because it is
different<00:03:23.989> over<00:03:24.500> there<00:03:24.530> so<00:03:25.340> once<00:03:25.579> we<00:03:25.700> go<00:03:25.819> ahead

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
different over there so once we go ahead

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.170 
different over there so once we go ahead
and<00:03:26.060> bring<00:03:26.180> this<00:03:26.450> it<00:03:27.019> just<00:03:27.079> takes<00:03:27.650> a<00:03:27.739> little

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
and bring this it just takes a little

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.460 
and bring this it just takes a little
first<00:03:29.180> time<00:03:29.480> it's<00:03:29.660> a<00:03:29.720> little<00:03:29.930> hard<00:03:30.110> to<00:03:30.200> get<00:03:30.319> off

first time it's a little hard to get off

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:31.690 
first time it's a little hard to get off
but<00:03:30.739> then<00:03:30.890> we're<00:03:31.040> agreed<00:03:31.160> with<00:03:31.489> another

card power adapter however it is quite
small<00:05:09.349> I<00:05:09.620> think<00:05:10.430> you<00:05:10.550> can<00:05:10.699> say<00:05:10.909> it's<00:05:11.120> a<00:05:11.210> good<00:05:11.419> 5

00:05:11.649 --> 00:05:11.659 
small I think you can say it's a good 5

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:14.200 
small I think you can say it's a good 5
inches<00:05:12.110> by<00:05:12.889> about<00:05:13.159> an<00:05:13.280> inch<00:05:13.430> it's<00:05:13.729> not<00:05:13.909> big<00:05:14.090> at

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:14.210 
inches by about an inch it's not big at

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:16.929 
inches by about an inch it's not big at
all<00:05:14.330> so<00:05:15.110> there<00:05:15.620> it<00:05:15.740> is<00:05:15.860> very<00:05:16.129> much<00:05:16.580> here's<00:05:16.849> a

all so there it is very much here's a
live<00:05:17.180> view<00:05:17.500> on<00:05:18.500> the<00:05:18.770> inside<00:05:19.099> there's<00:05:19.370> our

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:19.610 
live view on the inside there's our

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:21.129 
live view on the inside there's our
Lightning<00:05:19.909> port<00:05:20.090> where<00:05:20.240> we<00:05:20.360> insert<00:05:20.659> our<00:05:20.750> SD

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:21.139 
Lightning port where we insert our SD

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:23.619 
Lightning port where we insert our SD
card<00:05:21.379> and<00:05:21.560> then<00:05:22.069> we<00:05:22.189> have<00:05:22.460> the<00:05:22.729> little<00:05:23.090> SD<00:05:23.389> card
