00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
calories I mean like if you'll I

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.160 
calories I mean like if you'll I
understand<00:01:06.119> why<00:01:06.299> some<00:01:06.390> of<00:01:06.659> these<00:01:06.750> like

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
understand why some of these like

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.750 
understand why some of these like
berries<00:01:07.530> and<00:01:07.560> a<00:01:07.799> six-pack<00:01:08.040> berries<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:08.640> that

berries and a six-pack berries and that

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.399 
berries and a six-pack berries and that
I<00:01:09.000> recommend<00:01:09.689> you're<00:01:09.840> restricting<00:01:10.290> calories

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
I recommend you're restricting calories

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.920 
I recommend you're restricting calories
because<00:01:11.250> you<00:01:11.880> have<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:12.450> when<00:01:12.659> you're<00:01:12.780> eating

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
because you have to when you're eating

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.810 
because you have to when you're eating
meat<00:01:13.260> and<00:01:13.290> dairy<00:01:13.619> because<00:01:14.159> it's<00:01:14.310> not<00:01:14.490> designed

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
meat and dairy because it's not designed

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.600 
meat and dairy because it's not designed
to<00:01:15.000> be<00:01:15.090> in<00:01:15.299> your<00:01:15.420> body<00:01:15.600> so<00:01:16.439> when<00:01:17.220> you<00:01:17.340> restrict

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
to be in your body so when you restrict

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.880 
to be in your body so when you restrict
those<00:01:17.850> calories<00:01:18.180> you<00:01:19.020> are<00:01:19.229> going<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:19.770> get

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
those calories you are going to get

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.010 
those calories you are going to get
leaner<00:01:20.220> but<00:01:20.640> you're<00:01:20.820> going<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.180> also<00:01:21.450> feel<00:01:21.990> a

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
leaner but you're going to also feel a

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.840 
leaner but you're going to also feel a
bit<00:01:22.200> crazy<00:01:22.590> it's<00:01:23.369> not<00:01:23.580> going<00:01:23.729> to<00:01:23.790> be

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
bit crazy it's not going to be

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.270 
bit crazy it's not going to be
sustainable<00:01:24.570> and<00:01:24.750> it<00:01:24.869> gonna<00:01:24.960> binge<00:01:25.290> out<00:01:25.470> so
