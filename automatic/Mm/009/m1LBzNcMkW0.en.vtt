00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.189
 hello everyone when i put the taps and 

00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:12.240
 then grind them in order not to 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:15.089
 scratch the heel itself be it 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:18.150
 painted or leather-covered java 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:25.740
 I tape with adhesive tape for this I use us 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:26.130
 and scotch either 18 millimeters wide or 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.359
 take 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:34.440
 wide and cut it in order for it 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:37.800
 cut there are several technologies 1 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.450
 the simple one is rather laborious i take 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.090
 lining of that thickness 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:49.700
 to which I need to cut iron on 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:54.120
 new knife and so turning it around 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:56.219
 Scotch tape roll Well, it turns out pretty 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.899
 sure but long laborious 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:02.359
 Now I will show the second option 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.359
 which i have been using lately 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:28.310
 mean for that i use my 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:34.220
 wood lathe and 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:39.729
 ordinary shoe knife scotch roll i 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:44.000
 I clamp on the machine on the lathe chuck 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:48.259
 Vrazhin fists what to do if not 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.869
 lathe with chuck well then 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:52.069
 you need at least a drill 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:54.440
 and the drill should be power 

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:58.840
 somewhere in from five hundred to seven hundred usually 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:03.049
 the mechanics of their drills allows you to give 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:06.459
 such loads are very much taken from wood 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:11.600
 cut a circle drill and take 

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:14.480
 trimming threaded stud 3 guy and and a couple 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:17.720
 washers two more nuts on return the back and 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:21.530
 hold together then put on the part and 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.549
 hold 3 why 2 so in the process how 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.160
 you will grind 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:28.510
 you have not started all this construction 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:31.760
 screwed on studs 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.299
 means to clamp the drill somehow to 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.160
 workbench 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:38.450
 here with clamps or where to make 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:41.540
 fixtures and holding your cartridge 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.670
 harvesting and pre-made 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.010
 some kind of handler can be like that 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:50.180
 principle a piece of doses and 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:54.410
 it is a hole for the structure to press it to 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:03:00.280
 the table and the usual chisel machin 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:03:00.280
 made this item round 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:18.700
 here I already machined the disc put on him 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:25.209
 Scotch here is one thing boring 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:25.959
 wear so that he was on edge 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:29.170
 rotation 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:33.610
 otherwise when you will cut you put on 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:35.880
 and consider the roll and now you can 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:35.880
 cut 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:53.170
 here is ready the second ring like this 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:56.580
 uncomplicated method you can cut the tape on 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:04:00.220
 strips of width 8 10 millimeters and 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:05.410
 use it to protect the heel when 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:06.720
 turning and when painting on this on 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:09.820
 today everything 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:14.770
