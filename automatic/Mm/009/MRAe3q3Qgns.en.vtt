this<00:00:01.140> is<00:00:01.319> probably<00:00:01.770> not<00:00:02.330> something<00:00:03.330> that<00:00:03.419> you

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:03.570 
this is probably not something that you

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.240 
this is probably not something that you
should<00:00:03.600> just<00:00:03.840> go<00:00:04.140> out<00:00:04.319> and<00:00:04.470> attempt<00:00:04.859> yourself

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
should just go out and attempt yourself

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:06.769 
should just go out and attempt yourself
if<00:00:05.370> you<00:00:05.490> don't<00:00:05.609> have<00:00:05.819> any<00:00:05.970> experience<00:00:06.600> and

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
understanding in the way that that a

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.629 
understanding in the way that that a
horse<00:00:09.000> relates<00:00:09.450> to<00:00:09.630> pressure<00:00:09.929> the<00:00:10.889> whole<00:00:11.070> the

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
whole practicality of it to me is that

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.279 
whole practicality of it to me is that
if<00:00:14.219> I<00:00:14.580> put<00:00:14.849> my<00:00:15.000> horse<00:00:15.150> in<00:00:15.420> a<00:00:15.509> bond<00:00:15.780> I<00:00:15.990> want<00:00:16.199> to

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
if I put my horse in a bond I want to

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.200 
if I put my horse in a bond I want to
teach<00:00:16.440> him<00:00:16.590> to<00:00:16.740> seek<00:00:16.980> relief<00:00:17.340> and<00:00:17.670> find<00:00:17.970> what<00:00:18.180> I

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
teach him to seek relief and find what I

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.099 
teach him to seek relief and find what I
want<00:00:18.480> him<00:00:18.600> to<00:00:18.690> do<00:00:18.869> and<00:00:19.520> in<00:00:20.779> that<00:00:21.779> in<00:00:22.050> that

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
want him to do and in that in that

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.109 
want him to do and in that in that
respect<00:00:22.470> you<00:00:23.130> know<00:00:23.250> you<00:00:23.310> can't<00:00:23.820> just<00:00:23.880> go<00:00:24.029> out

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
respect you know you can't just go out

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.700 
respect you know you can't just go out
there<00:00:24.449> and<00:00:24.570> pull<00:00:24.720> on<00:00:24.869> his<00:00:25.050> leg<00:00:25.230> and<00:00:25.380> pull<00:00:25.590> on

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
there and pull on his leg and pull on

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.800 
there and pull on his leg and pull on
his<00:00:25.890> head<00:00:26.070> and<00:00:26.220> expect<00:00:26.580> him<00:00:26.670> to<00:00:26.760> lay<00:00:26.970> down<00:00:27.000> you

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
his head and expect him to lay down you

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:34.250 
his head and expect him to lay down you
have<00:00:27.930> to<00:00:28.080> let<00:00:28.320> him<00:00:28.470> find<00:00:28.740> it<00:00:29.070> and<00:00:30.289> so<00:00:32.540> but<00:00:33.540> again

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
have to let him find it and so but again

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.650 
have to let him find it and so but again
I<00:00:34.469> reiterate<00:00:35.100> that<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:36.059> whole<00:00:38.270> principle<00:00:39.270> of

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
I reiterate that the whole principle of

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.110 
I reiterate that the whole principle of
the<00:00:40.200> deal<00:00:40.410> is<00:00:40.590> is<00:00:40.829> to<00:00:41.070> make<00:00:41.100> sure<00:00:41.309> that<00:00:41.550> that

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
the deal is is to make sure that that

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.690 
the deal is is to make sure that that
your<00:00:42.300> horse<00:00:42.540> is<00:00:42.750> soft<00:00:43.079> and<00:00:43.379> relaxed<00:00:43.950> and<00:00:44.160> the

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
your horse is soft and relaxed and the

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.369 
your horse is soft and relaxed and the
more<00:00:44.879> things<00:00:45.180> that<00:00:45.300> you<00:00:45.390> do<00:00:45.719> whether<00:00:46.140> it's

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
more things that you do whether it's

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.920 
more things that you do whether it's
time<00:00:46.680> laying<00:00:47.219> him<00:00:47.489> down<00:00:47.719> teaching<00:00:48.719> him<00:00:48.809> to

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
time laying him down teaching him to

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.790 
time laying him down teaching him to
lead<00:00:49.370> backwards<00:00:50.370> forwards<00:00:50.850> left<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:51.300> right

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 
lead backwards forwards left and right

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.260 
lead backwards forwards left and right
it<00:00:52.800> just<00:00:53.039> builds<00:00:53.309> more<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:53.610> more<00:00:53.730> confidence

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
it just builds more and more confidence

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.670 
it just builds more and more confidence
into<00:00:54.480> your<00:00:54.570> horse<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:54.960> where<00:00:55.110> you're<00:00:55.320> a<00:00:55.350> leader

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
into your horse to where you're a leader

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.950 
into your horse to where you're a leader
and<00:00:56.100> your<00:00:56.489> horses<00:00:56.969> follow<00:00:57.870> up<00:00:59.239> earlier<00:01:00.239> we

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
and your horses follow up earlier we

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.789 
and your horses follow up earlier we
talked<00:01:01.230> about<00:01:02.090> a<00:01:03.090> trained<00:01:03.899> response<00:01:04.110> or<00:01:04.739> a

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
talked about a trained response or a

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.899 
talked about a trained response or a
conditioned<00:01:05.460> reflex<00:01:07.010> you<00:01:08.010> usually<00:01:08.610> you<00:01:08.790> know

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
conditioned reflex you usually you know

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.390 
conditioned reflex you usually you know
if<00:01:09.299> you<00:01:09.510> put<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:09.750> horse<00:01:10.049> in<00:01:10.229> enough<00:01:10.500> of<00:01:10.770> a<00:01:11.070> bond

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
if you put a horse in enough of a bond

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.969 
if you put a horse in enough of a bond
he's<00:01:12.270> going<00:01:12.479> to<00:01:12.570> try<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:13.110> find<00:01:13.320> a<00:01:13.470> way<00:01:13.619> out<00:01:13.830> of

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
he's going to try and find a way out of

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.240 
he's going to try and find a way out of
it<00:01:14.070> and<00:01:14.450> the<00:01:15.450> best<00:01:15.689> way<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:15.930> to<00:01:16.530> do<00:01:16.710> that<00:01:16.890> is<00:01:17.070> is

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
it and the best way to to do that is is

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.690 
it and the best way to to do that is is
to<00:01:17.640> give<00:01:18.630> him<00:01:18.810> an<00:01:18.960> outlet<00:01:19.409> and<00:01:19.619> put<00:01:20.280> it<00:01:20.400> in<00:01:20.549> your

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
to give him an outlet and put it in your

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.300 
to give him an outlet and put it in your
direction<00:01:20.939> that<00:01:21.360> you<00:01:21.540> want<00:01:21.780> so<00:01:22.770> like<00:01:23.009> if<00:01:23.159> I

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
reward him if he takes a step forward

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.600 
reward him if he takes a step forward
there<00:01:33.630> he's<00:01:33.869> already<00:01:34.170> this<00:01:34.680> horse<00:01:34.890> is<00:01:35.100> so<00:01:35.340> soft

there he's already this horse is so soft
that<00:01:35.759> he's<00:01:36.030> already<00:01:36.210> figured<00:01:36.659> out<00:01:36.780> that<00:01:36.840> when

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
that he's already figured out that when

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.890 
that he's already figured out that when
I<00:01:37.259> go<00:01:37.500> to<00:01:37.560> reach<00:01:37.829> for<00:01:37.860> that<00:01:38.130> halter<00:01:38.579> I<00:01:38.820> want<00:01:39.780> him

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
to back up that's what I would call a

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.760 
to back up that's what I would call a
trained<00:01:43.979> response<00:01:44.159> now<00:01:45.149> if<00:01:45.329> he<00:01:45.479> doesn't<00:01:45.930> if<00:01:46.140> he

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
trained response now if he doesn't if he

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.100 
trained response now if he doesn't if he
doesn't<00:01:47.159> go<00:01:47.280> to<00:01:47.310> back<00:01:47.579> up<00:01:47.820> I'll<00:01:48.210> go<00:01:48.600> ahead<00:01:48.720> and

doesn't go to back up I'll go ahead and
and<00:01:49.290> put<00:01:50.280> some<00:01:50.460> more<00:01:50.579> pressure<00:01:50.909> on<00:01:51.030> him<00:01:51.299> to<00:01:51.869> let

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
and put some more pressure on him to let

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.010 
and put some more pressure on him to let
him<00:01:52.140> figure<00:01:52.530> it<00:01:52.560> out<00:01:52.799> and<00:01:53.220> just<00:01:53.479> show<00:01:54.479> him<00:01:54.810> that

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.020 
him figure it out and just show him that
that<00:01:55.320> if<00:01:55.500> he<00:01:55.680> doesn't<00:01:55.920> respond<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.880> way<00:01:56.909> I

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
that if he doesn't respond the way I

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.999 
that if he doesn't respond the way I
want<00:01:57.360> him<00:01:57.479> to<00:01:57.689> that<00:01:58.469> there's<00:01:58.710> going<00:01:58.860> to<00:01:58.920> be

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
want him to that there's going to be

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.450 
want him to that there's going to be
more<00:01:59.880> pressure<00:02:00.329> increased<00:02:00.899> and<00:02:01.320> that's<00:02:02.280> the

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
more pressure increased and that's the

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.300 
more pressure increased and that's the
same<00:02:02.729> thing<00:02:03.000> with<00:02:03.240> with<00:02:04.200> like<00:02:04.770> yuning

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
same thing with with like yuning

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.910 
same thing with with like yuning
yielding<00:02:05.969> to<00:02:06.119> your<00:02:06.299> leg<00:02:06.540> if<00:02:07.079> you<00:02:07.380> have<00:02:07.619> a<00:02:07.649> horse

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
yielding to your leg if you have a horse

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.360 
yielding to your leg if you have a horse
that<00:02:08.129> you<00:02:08.340> want<00:02:09.020> to<00:02:10.020> get<00:02:10.560> off<00:02:10.679> of<00:02:10.860> your<00:02:10.979> leg<00:02:11.160> or

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.860 
whatever
you<00:02:12.870> know<00:02:12.989> I'm<00:02:13.110> going<00:02:13.230> to<00:02:13.319> go<00:02:13.470> ahead

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
you know I'm going to go ahead

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.509 
you know I'm going to go ahead
and<00:02:14.709> put<00:02:15.280> pressure<00:02:16.030> on<00:02:16.300> the<00:02:16.480> side<00:02:16.750> here<00:02:17.340> now<00:02:18.340> if

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:18.519 
and put pressure on the side here now if

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:20.070 
and put pressure on the side here now if
he<00:02:18.700> if<00:02:18.910> he<00:02:19.180> doesn't<00:02:19.569> move<00:02:19.690> I'm<00:02:19.900> going<00:02:20.019> to

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
he if he doesn't move I'm going to

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.690 
he if he doesn't move I'm going to
increase<00:02:20.470> that<00:02:20.500> pressure<00:02:20.920> now<00:02:21.099> when<00:02:21.340> he<00:02:21.430> moves

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
increase that pressure now when he moves

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.360 
increase that pressure now when he moves
I<00:02:22.090> take<00:02:22.720> that<00:02:22.870> pressure<00:02:23.110> away<00:02:23.560> so<00:02:24.160> what<00:02:24.280> I'm

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
I take that pressure away so what I'm

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.130 
I take that pressure away so what I'm
doing<00:02:24.430> is<00:02:24.730> I'm<00:02:24.910> tipped<00:02:25.150> I'm<00:02:25.390> teaching<00:02:25.870> him<00:02:26.080> a

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
doing is I'm tipped I'm teaching him a

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.009 
doing is I'm tipped I'm teaching him a
conditioned<00:02:26.890> response<00:02:27.569> when<00:02:28.569> he<00:02:28.599> feels

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:29.019 
conditioned response when he feels

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:31.979 
conditioned response when he feels
pressure<00:02:29.349> on<00:02:29.650> his<00:02:29.800> side<00:02:30.069> he's<00:02:31.030> gonna<00:02:31.269> move<00:02:31.599> and

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
pressure on his side he's gonna move and

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:36.240 
pressure on his side he's gonna move and
seek<00:02:32.560> relief<00:02:32.950> now<00:02:33.819> after<00:02:34.239> a<00:02:34.269> while<00:02:34.599> it<00:02:35.250> becomes

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
seek relief now after a while it becomes

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.580 
seek relief now after a while it becomes
lighter<00:02:36.640> and<00:02:36.910> lighter<00:02:37.150> and<00:02:37.360> lighter<00:02:37.420> yeah<00:02:38.349> and

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
lighter and lighter and lighter yeah and

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:39.990 
lighter and lighter and lighter yeah and
not<00:02:38.650> saying<00:02:38.980> that<00:02:39.129> I'll<00:02:39.220> never<00:02:39.459> have<00:02:39.549> to<00:02:39.700> put<00:02:39.940> a

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
not saying that I'll never have to put a

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.970 
not saying that I'll never have to put a
lot<00:02:40.209> of<00:02:40.299> pressure<00:02:40.510> on<00:02:40.660> him<00:02:40.870> if<00:02:41.049> he<00:02:41.739> doesn't

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
lot of pressure on him if he doesn't

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.979 
lot of pressure on him if he doesn't
understand<00:02:42.610> it<00:02:42.790> if<00:02:42.879> he<00:02:43.030> doesn't<00:02:43.450> if<00:02:43.629> he's<00:02:43.840> not

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
understand it if he doesn't if he's not

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:45.930 
understand it if he doesn't if he's not
looking<00:02:44.200> for<00:02:44.410> it<00:02:44.739> or<00:02:45.040> if<00:02:45.160> he's<00:02:45.310> not<00:02:45.489> figuring

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
looking for it or if he's not figuring

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.199 
looking for it or if he's not figuring
it<00:02:46.090> out<00:02:46.209> I'll<00:02:47.079> go<00:02:47.290> ahead<00:02:47.440> and<00:02:47.799> and<00:02:47.980> poke<00:02:48.910> him<00:02:49.180> a

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
it out I'll go ahead and and poke him a

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:51.240 
it out I'll go ahead and and poke him a
little<00:02:49.420> bit<00:02:49.510> with<00:02:49.720> it<00:02:49.750> and<00:02:49.989> move<00:02:50.140> him<00:02:50.380> but<00:02:51.069> when

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
little bit with it and move him but when

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.789 
little bit with it and move him but when
he's<00:02:51.459> moving<00:02:51.730> I<00:02:52.180> don't<00:02:53.019> want<00:02:53.260> to<00:02:53.349> keep<00:02:53.500> poking

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:53.799 
he's moving I don't want to keep poking

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:56.250 
he's moving I don't want to keep poking
him<00:02:54.069> it's<00:02:54.849> like<00:02:55.120> a<00:02:55.360> lady<00:02:55.599> asked<00:02:55.959> me<00:02:56.079> the<00:02:56.200> other

lope and I said well you need to find a

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:10.140 
lope and I said well you need to find a
starting<00:03:06.610> point<00:03:06.819> somewhere<00:03:07.739> and<00:03:09.030> you<00:03:10.030> know

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.550 
that that if they can teach their horses
to<00:03:42.910> seek<00:03:43.239> relief<00:03:43.480> there's<00:03:43.900> really<00:03:44.109> nothing

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
to seek relief there's really nothing

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.050 
to seek relief there's really nothing
that<00:03:44.590> you<00:03:44.709> can't<00:03:44.980> teach<00:03:45.250> them<00:03:45.430> to<00:03:45.549> do<00:03:45.730> within

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
that you can't teach them to do within

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.629 
that you can't teach them to do within
within<00:03:46.510> reason<00:03:47.169> so<00:03:48.010> what<00:03:48.160> I'm<00:03:48.280> going<00:03:48.430> to<00:03:48.489> do

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:48.639 
within reason so what I'm going to do

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:50.670 
within reason so what I'm going to do
here<00:03:48.940> again<00:03:49.180> is<00:03:49.329> just<00:03:49.359> get<00:03:49.750> him<00:03:49.870> to<00:03:49.989> side<00:03:50.380> pass

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
here again is just get him to side pass

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.589 
here again is just get him to side pass

off with his stick this is a trained

00:03:52.599 --> 00:04:00.599 
off with his stick this is a trained
response<00:03:57.569> if<00:03:58.569> he<00:03:58.750> doesn't<00:03:59.139> move<00:03:59.290> I'll<00:03:59.799> put

response if he doesn't move I'll put
more<00:04:00.730> pressure<00:04:01.000> on<00:04:01.299> it<00:04:01.450> if<00:04:02.380> he<00:04:03.040> does<00:04:03.280> move<00:04:03.489> I'll
