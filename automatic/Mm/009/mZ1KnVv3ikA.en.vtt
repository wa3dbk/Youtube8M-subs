00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:07.220
 the little raven is once 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:10.190
 Perez that was a little mouse of 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:12.349
 city lived with his family in a 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:15.320
 hole in the wall of a building 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:17.960
 the hole was not very big but it was 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:21.830
 very comfortable and there they did not lack 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:24.620
 food they lived next to a bakery by 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:27.020
 the night he and his father were going to catch 

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:28.190
 flour and everything they found to 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:31.340
 eat 

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:33.980
 one day pepito heard a big fuss 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:36.950
 on the floor above and as a mouse 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:39.320
 curious that he was climbing and climbed 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.810
 pipes until you reach the first 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.170
 plant 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:47.080
 there were a lot of devices 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:49.570
 picture flower armchairs looked like 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:52.690
 someone was going to settle there 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:56.800
 the next day pepito went back up 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:59.980
 that was all that and discovered something 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:02.610
 that he liked a lot on the floor of 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:06.130
 upstairs they had put a dental clinic 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:08.650
 from then on every day I went up 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.890
 to look at everything Doctor Jose did 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:13.430
 Mary 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:15.710
 I watched and I learned I looked again and 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.850
 pointed to everything he could in a 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:21.970
 small cardboard notepad 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:25.180
 then practiced with your family everything 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:28.659
 what he knew and that's how the little mouse 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:32.200
 Perez became very famous came mice 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:35.380
 from everywhere for them to heal 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:39.490
 but then mice started coming 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:43.140
 Elderly people with bigger problems do not 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:47.400
 They had teeth and they wanted to eat 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:50.550
 nougat walnuts almonds and everything that does not 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:54.810
 they could eat since they were young the 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:57.180
 little mouse in his and he thought how could 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:01.290
 help these mice that they trusted 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:04.900
 him and as always when I had a doubt 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:07.960
 went up to the clinic 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:10.600
 He looked at what he could do 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:14.210
 He saw Dr. Jose Maria putting 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:17.580
 Great teeth to an old man 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:20.520
 but those teeth were from people 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:23.240
 they made them in a very large factory 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.240
 for dentists 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:30.049
 then when I was going to go to his 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:32.959
 house without finding the solution appeared 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:35.060
 in a clinic a boy with his mom the 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:37.430
 child wanted the doctor to take away a 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:40.609
 milk tooth to come out 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:43.609
 fast the strong and big tooth the 

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:46.959
 Doctor took it off and gave him a memory 

00:02:43.609 --> 00:02:50.599
 the little mouse Perez found the solution 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:54.139
 ideal to that child's house and I'll buy him 

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:56.959
 the tooth thought followed him throughout the 

00:02:54.139 --> 00:03:00.560
 city and when he finally came to the house 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:03.919
 he found a huge cat and could not 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:07.219
 enter the little mouse was waiting for 

00:03:03.919 --> 00:03:09.560
 that everything fell asleep and then he entered 

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:13.700
 the child's room 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:15.740
 the boy had fallen asleep watching and 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.960
 looking at his tooth 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:20.020
 and he had put it under his 

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:20.020
 pillow 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:30.269
 the poor little rag doll suffered a lot 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:33.150
 to get his tooth then when 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:34.900
 finally found him he left the child a 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.540
 nice gift 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:40.840
 the next morning the boy saw the 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:43.780
 gift and he was very happy and 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:46.599
 He told all his friends from school 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:48.730
 from that day all children leave 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:52.870
 their baby teeth under the 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:55.439
 pillow and the little mouse picks them up 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:59.250
 and leave them a nice gift in return 

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:59.250
