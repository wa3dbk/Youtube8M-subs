00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:50.710 
all we can put that on one side the true
story<00:02:48.650> is<00:02:48.860> that<00:02:48.890> hydrogen<00:02:49.250> peroxide<00:02:49.580> on<00:02:50.239> its

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
story is that hydrogen peroxide on its

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.580 
story is that hydrogen peroxide on its
own<00:02:51.190> does<00:02:52.190> decompose<00:02:52.760> to<00:02:52.790> form<00:02:53.379> oxygen<00:02:54.379> and

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
own does decompose to form oxygen and

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.100 
own does decompose to form oxygen and
water<00:02:55.099> but<00:02:55.730> it<00:02:55.910> needs<00:02:56.090> a<00:02:56.239> catalyst<00:02:56.870> under

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
water but it needs a catalyst under

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.650 
water but it needs a catalyst under
normal<00:02:57.379> conditions<00:02:57.860> to<00:02:58.010> do<00:02:58.400> that<00:02:58.610> this<00:02:59.360> black

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
normal conditions to do that this black

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.380 
normal conditions to do that this black
powder<00:02:59.959> here<00:03:00.349> is<00:03:00.500> a<00:03:00.830> catalyst<00:03:01.459> it's<00:03:02.030> not<00:03:02.269> the

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
powder here is a catalyst it's not the

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.059 
powder here is a catalyst it's not the
catalyst<00:03:02.810> that<00:03:02.900> the<00:03:02.989> bombardier<00:03:03.379> beetle<00:03:03.440> uses

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:04.069 
catalyst that the bombardier beetle uses

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:05.289 
catalyst that the bombardier beetle uses
the<00:03:04.190> bombardier<00:03:04.549> beetle<00:03:04.849> does<00:03:05.030> use<00:03:05.269> a

the bombardier beetle does use a

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:08.350 
the bombardier beetle does use a
catalyst<00:03:05.840> and<00:03:06.019> it<00:03:06.110> does<00:03:06.290> in<00:03:06.470> fact<00:03:06.620> squirt<00:03:07.370> this

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
catalyst and it does in fact squirt this

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.830 
catalyst and it does in fact squirt this
hot<00:03:08.599> substance<00:03:09.110> into<00:03:09.440> the<00:03:09.530> face<00:03:09.709> of<00:03:09.950> its<00:03:10.430> enemy

hot substance into the face of its enemy

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.220 
hot substance into the face of its enemy
but<00:03:11.840> if<00:03:12.079> you<00:03:12.290> put<00:03:12.440> a<00:03:12.470> catalyst<00:03:12.980> into<00:03:13.310> a<00:03:13.340> weak

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
but if you put a catalyst into a weak

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.650 
but if you put a catalyst into a weak
solution<00:03:15.230> of<00:03:15.440> hydrogen<00:03:16.310> peroxide<00:03:16.660> then

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 
solution of hydrogen peroxide then

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.400 
solution of hydrogen peroxide then
you're<00:03:18.110> going<00:03:18.290> to<00:03:18.349> get<00:03:18.530> a<00:03:18.739> little<00:03:19.549> bit<00:03:19.700> of

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
you're going to get a little bit of

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:24.910 
you're going to get a little bit of
bubbling<00:03:21.410> and<00:03:22.840> it's<00:03:23.840> a<00:03:23.900> little<00:03:24.019> bit<00:03:24.260> warm<00:03:24.500> that

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
bubbling and it's a little bit warm that

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.830 
bubbling and it's a little bit warm that
might<00:03:25.160> have<00:03:25.700> some<00:03:26.000> effect<00:03:26.120> on<00:03:26.420> the<00:03:26.540> predator

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
might have some effect on the predator

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.839 
might have some effect on the predator
that<00:03:26.959> might<00:03:27.349> slightly<00:03:27.680> to<00:03:27.920> deter<00:03:28.310> a<00:03:28.340> predator

00:03:28.839 --> 00:03:28.849 
that might slightly to deter a predator

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:32.199 
that might slightly to deter a predator
and<00:03:29.230> it<00:03:30.230> would<00:03:30.440> be<00:03:30.819> not<00:03:31.819> particularly

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
and it would be not particularly

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:33.819 
and it would be not particularly
dangerous<00:03:32.390> to<00:03:32.690> the<00:03:32.780> beetle<00:03:33.079> now<00:03:33.590> we've<00:03:33.709> got<00:03:33.799> a

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:33.829 
dangerous to the beetle now we've got a

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:37.449 
dangerous to the beetle now we've got a
smooth<00:03:34.129> gradient<00:03:34.459> a<00:03:35.319> bit<00:03:36.319> more<00:03:36.590> concentration

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459 
smooth gradient a bit more concentration

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:39.160 
smooth gradient a bit more concentration
of<00:03:37.519> hydrogen<00:03:37.849> peroxide<00:03:37.970> and<00:03:38.690> that's

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
of hydrogen peroxide and that's

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:41.410 
of hydrogen peroxide and that's
distinctly<00:03:39.829> warm<00:03:40.160> that<00:03:40.910> would<00:03:41.060> work<00:03:41.239> more

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420 
distinctly warm that would work more

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.660 
distinctly warm that would work more
effectively<00:03:41.900> against<00:03:42.260> a<00:03:42.350> predator<00:03:42.530> and<00:03:43.040> by

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
effectively against a predator and by

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.900 
effectively against a predator and by
moving<00:03:43.970> gradually<00:03:44.690> up<00:03:44.810> the<00:03:44.989> slope<00:03:45.910> gradually

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:46.910 
moving gradually up the slope gradually

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:49.180 
moving gradually up the slope gradually
increasing<00:03:47.569> the<00:03:47.690> concentration<00:03:47.900> of<00:03:48.829> hydrogen

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190 
increasing the concentration of hydrogen

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:50.580 
increasing the concentration of hydrogen
peroxide

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
peroxide

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:56.180 
peroxide
we<00:03:51.590> can<00:03:51.739> end<00:03:51.889> up<00:03:52.040> with

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.520 

so<00:03:57.190> there<00:03:57.340> is<00:03:57.490> a<00:03:57.760> smooth<00:03:58.330> slope<00:03:58.690> all<00:03:59.020> the<00:03:59.380> way

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
so there is a smooth slope all the way

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.910 
so there is a smooth slope all the way
up<00:04:00.520> to<00:04:00.790> the<00:04:00.910> effective<00:04:01.660> deterrent<00:04:02.320> against<00:04:02.710> a

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920 
up to the effective deterrent against a

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.640 
up to the effective deterrent against a
predator
