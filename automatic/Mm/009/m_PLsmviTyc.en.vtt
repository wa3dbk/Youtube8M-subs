spaghetti chin up so right here only
five<00:00:47.140> really<00:00:47.649> really<00:00:47.890> thin<00:00:48.130> ropes<00:00:48.399> and<00:00:48.640> then

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.030 
five really really thin ropes and then

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:50.430 
five really really thin ropes and then
when<00:00:49.210> you<00:00:49.300> hold<00:00:49.510> on<00:00:49.690> to<00:00:49.840> this<00:00:49.960> you<00:00:50.170> can't

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:50.440 
when you hold on to this you can't

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:52.329 
imagine how it changes me when I did

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:54.479 
imagine how it changes me when I did
this<00:00:52.450> the<00:00:52.630> first<00:00:52.870> time<00:00:53.110> today<00:00:53.350> I<00:00:53.620> thought<00:00:54.250> a

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:54.489 
this the first time today I thought a

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:55.860 
this the first time today I thought a
I've<00:00:54.640> done<00:00:54.820> tile<00:00:55.059> chin-ups<00:00:55.450> I've<00:00:55.570> been<00:00:55.719> real

I've done tile chin-ups I've been real

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:57.690 
I've done tile chin-ups I've been real
chips<00:00:56.110> when<00:00:56.469> you<00:00:56.620> go<00:00:56.770> to<00:00:56.829> the<00:00:56.980> spaghetti<00:00:57.219> chin

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:57.700 
chips when you go to the spaghetti chin

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.940 
chips when you go to the spaghetti chin
up<00:00:57.820> it's<00:00:58.059> going<00:00:58.420> to<00:00:58.510> freak<00:00:58.809> you<00:00:58.989> out<00:00:59.050> now<00:00:59.739> we're

00:00:59.940 --> 00:00:59.950 
up it's going to freak you out now we're

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:01.170 
up it's going to freak you out now we're
going<00:01:00.040> to<00:01:00.100> do<00:01:00.250> that<00:01:00.370> for<00:01:00.550> three<00:01:00.820> so<00:01:01.000> it's<00:01:01.090> going

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:01.180 
going to do that for three so it's going

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.209 
going to do that for three so it's going
to<00:01:01.239> be<00:01:01.329> 12<00:01:01.660> total<00:01:01.960> reps<00:01:02.290> in<00:01:02.500> the<00:01:02.620> circuit<00:01:03.070> and

00:01:03.209 --> 00:01:03.219 
to be 12 total reps in the circuit and

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:06.240 
to be 12 total reps in the circuit and
then<00:01:03.879> max<00:01:04.540> is<00:01:04.750> going<00:01:04.930> to<00:01:04.989> show<00:01:05.140> off<00:01:05.320> his<00:01:05.770> mega

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.250 
then max is going to show off his mega

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.940 
then max is going to show off his mega
heart<00:01:06.850> rate<00:01:07.090> for<00:01:07.780> our<00:01:07.959> coordination<00:01:08.709> and

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:08.950 
heart rate for our coordination and

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.190 
heart rate for our coordination and
focus<00:01:09.310> challenge<00:01:09.549> the<00:01:10.359> monkey<00:01:10.719> bars<00:01:10.899> but

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
focus challenge the monkey bars but

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.949 
focus challenge the monkey bars but
we're<00:01:11.409> going<00:01:11.530> to<00:01:11.590> start<00:01:11.799> with<00:01:11.889> this<00:01:12.069> one<00:01:12.130> first

00:01:15.949 --> 00:01:15.959 

00:01:15.959 --> 00:01:21.709 

so<00:01:16.959> against<00:01:17.289> why<00:01:17.409> grip<00:01:18.450> max<00:01:19.450> get<00:01:19.689> full<00:01:20.079> formed

00:01:21.709 --> 00:01:21.719 
so against why grip max get full formed

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:30.899 
so against why grip max get full formed
since<00:01:22.719> is<00:01:22.929> five<00:01:29.219> these<00:01:30.219> are<00:01:30.399> way<00:01:30.549> harder<00:01:30.789> than

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:30.909 
since is five these are way harder than

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:33.359 
since is five these are way harder than
you<00:01:31.119> think<00:01:31.329> max<00:01:32.139> now<00:01:32.409> could<00:01:32.649> start<00:01:32.920> up<00:01:33.009> on<00:01:33.159> his

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:33.369 
you think max now could start up on his

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:39.629 
you think max now could start up on his
pipes<00:01:36.509> now<00:01:37.509> he's<00:01:37.719> going<00:01:37.929> right<00:01:38.109> into<00:01:38.289> a<00:01:38.409> gym<00:01:38.920> so

00:01:39.629 --> 00:01:39.639 
pipes now he's going right into a gym so

00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:43.859 
pipes now he's going right into a gym so
if<00:01:39.759> cheater<00:01:39.999> up<00:01:41.249> it<00:01:42.249> does<00:01:42.459> feet<00:01:42.700> wide<00:01:42.969> speak

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:43.869 
if cheater up it does feet wide speak

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:46.639 
if cheater up it does feet wide speak
together<00:01:44.189> he's<00:01:45.189> getting<00:01:45.369> fancy<00:01:46.060> right<00:01:46.299> now

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
together he's getting fancy right now

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.209 
together he's getting fancy right now
the<00:01:47.649> guy's<00:01:47.829> a<00:01:47.859> machine<00:01:49.439> this<00:01:50.439> grip<00:01:50.740> man<00:01:50.919> is

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:51.219 
the guy's a machine this grip man is

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:55.709 
the guy's a machine this grip man is
thicker<00:01:51.549> than<00:01:51.669> you<00:01:51.909> think<00:01:52.119> for<00:01:52.959> your<00:01:53.079> up<00:01:54.719> it's

00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:55.719 
thicker than you think for your up it's

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:57.920 
thicker than you think for your up it's
not

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
not

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.190 
not
let's<00:01:58.920> test<00:01:59.250> with<00:01:59.580> the<00:01:59.730> mic<00:01:59.970> them<00:02:00.270> actually

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
let's test with the mic them actually

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.670 
let's test with the mic them actually
did<00:02:01.500> nothing<00:02:01.800> which<00:02:01.920> is<00:02:01.950> breathing<00:02:02.960> and<00:02:03.960> for
