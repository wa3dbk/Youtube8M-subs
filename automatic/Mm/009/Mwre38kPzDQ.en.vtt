00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:13.880 
I'm going to show you how to make this

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.779 
I'm going to show you how to make this
piece<00:00:14.150> of<00:00:14.269> paper<00:00:14.420> double-sided

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.870 

here<00:00:18.390> I<00:00:18.419> have<00:00:18.749> a<00:00:18.779> piece<00:00:19.079> as<00:00:19.769> you<00:00:19.890> can<00:00:20.130> see<00:00:20.369> this

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
here I have a piece as you can see this

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.689 
here I have a piece as you can see this
is<00:00:21.060> a<00:00:21.089> piece<00:00:21.300> of<00:00:21.329> basic<00:00:21.839> gray<00:00:22.109> and<00:00:22.439> if<00:00:23.339> I<00:00:23.460> flip

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
is a piece of basic gray and if I flip

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.419 
is a piece of basic gray and if I flip
it<00:00:23.730> over<00:00:23.970> it's<00:00:24.300> normally<00:00:24.779> white<00:00:25.189> but<00:00:26.189> as<00:00:26.309> you

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:26.429 
it over it's normally white but as you

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:29.209 
it over it's normally white but as you
can<00:00:26.579> see<00:00:26.640> I<00:00:27.090> have<00:00:27.300> chosen<00:00:27.660> some<00:00:28.230> similar

00:00:29.209 --> 00:00:29.219 
can see I have chosen some similar

00:00:29.219 --> 00:00:33.829 
can see I have chosen some similar
colors<00:00:29.789> and<00:00:31.430> created<00:00:32.430> another<00:00:33.149> side<00:00:33.449> to<00:00:33.480> this

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:33.839 
colors and created another side to this

00:00:33.839 --> 00:00:38.540 
colors and created another side to this
so<00:00:34.350> that<00:00:36.079> it<00:00:37.079> is<00:00:37.260> complementary<00:00:37.680> on<00:00:38.220> the<00:00:38.370> other

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
so that it is complementary on the other

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.509 
so that it is complementary on the other
side<00:00:39.199> tips<00:00:40.199> use<00:00:41.180> bigger<00:00:42.589> stamps<00:00:43.589> first<00:00:43.920> and<00:00:44.280> in

00:00:44.509 --> 00:00:44.519 
side tips use bigger stamps first and in

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:47.270 
side tips use bigger stamps first and in
fill<00:00:44.850> with<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.149> smaller<00:00:45.449> ones<00:00:45.750> and<00:00:46.100> always<00:00:47.100> go

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
fill with the smaller ones and always go

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.280 
fill with the smaller ones and always go
off<00:00:47.339> the<00:00:47.489> sides<00:00:47.729> because<00:00:48.360> I<00:00:48.659> don't<00:00:49.050> know<00:00:49.140> why

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:49.290 
off the sides because I don't know why

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:50.899 
off the sides because I don't know why
but<00:00:49.469> it<00:00:49.589> always<00:00:49.769> looks<00:00:49.920> better<00:00:50.339> because<00:00:50.790> it

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:50.909 
but it always looks better because it

00:00:50.909 --> 00:00:52.460 
but it always looks better because it
looks<00:00:51.119> like<00:00:51.210> it's<00:00:51.479> been<00:00:51.659> cut<00:00:51.869> from<00:00:52.140> a<00:00:52.259> bigger

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:52.470 
looks like it's been cut from a bigger

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:57.979 
looks like it's been cut from a bigger
piece<00:00:53.960> so<00:00:54.960> let<00:00:55.140> me<00:00:55.229> just<00:00:55.379> show<00:00:55.589> you<00:00:56.689> I've<00:00:57.689> used
