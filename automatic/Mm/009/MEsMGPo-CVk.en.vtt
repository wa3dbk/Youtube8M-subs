00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.700
you immediately get him out of here

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.500
but grandfather are days he wanders around here and he is also without plate

00:01:17.618 --> 00:01:19.618

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.260
Can we keep it ?

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:31.580

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.200
but grandpa you would hold ihim with you but we would think everything else

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.540
give him food , clean him

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.960

You know those days when everything goes wrong ?

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.320

00:02:43.758 --> 00:02:45.578

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:41.960

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.900

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:04.980
right? I will look beyond

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:14.380
hey grandpa , do you said to grandmather about Lucky?

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.560
no...I have not yet had the courage

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.160
grandpa..you have to tell her!

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.360
(voice over) AAAAH!Henry!

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:28.240
omg..I think that there will be no more need

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:35.720
and when exactly were you planning to tell me ?

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:40.840
so...I know you hate dogs and guys made ​​me tenderness

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:43.440
Henry..but I do not hate dogs!

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:47.560
no?So why don't you  have to want one?

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:52.600
well...when I was young I had a dog called Sissi

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:57.520
I loved her and she was a loyal and loving friend

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:00.380
But one day she fell ill and died

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:06.340
I have been so bad that I promised myself  to not get attached to any other animal

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:08.920
oh Mery but so it is not right

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:18.580
if all of us stop  to love and give love for fear of losing people and animals  we would lose many occasions to be happy

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:23.320
and then...the boys could use a little bit of responsibility

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:24.840
come on grandma!

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:26.300
please!

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:28.060
pleaaaase!

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:35.360
okay...but you 'll have to take care of him

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:39.500
give him food , clean him and get him out to play and needs

00:06:39.611 --> 00:06:41.611
and to avoid that he combines trouble

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:45.840
dont' worry Mery, Lucky is a a very obedient dog

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:49.340
right Lucky? sitting Lucky,sitting!

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:55.300
hey Lucky where are you going?

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:59.700
Lucky,I said sitting! Lucky SITTING SITTING!
