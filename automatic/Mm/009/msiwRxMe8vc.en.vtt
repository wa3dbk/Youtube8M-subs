00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
what it does the cool thing about is

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.640 
what it does the cool thing about is
this<00:01:12.180> thing<00:01:12.390> is<00:01:12.540> it's<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:12.990> stickers<00:01:13.439> down

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
this thing is it's the stickers down

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.219 
this thing is it's the stickers down
there<00:01:13.890> yeah<00:01:14.850> because<00:01:15.060> they're<00:01:15.810> pretty<00:01:15.990> much

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
there yeah because they're pretty much

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.679 
there yeah because they're pretty much
like<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.740> show<00:01:16.979> and<00:01:17.280> also<00:01:17.820> makes<00:01:18.150> it<00:01:18.330> me

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
like the show and also makes it me

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.230 
like the show and also makes it me
easier<00:01:19.320> for<00:01:19.799> me<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:19.950> do<00:01:20.250> those<00:01:20.490> action<00:01:20.850> figures

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
easier for me to do those action figures

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.179 
easier for me to do those action figures
because<00:01:21.780> originally<00:01:21.990> I<00:01:22.229> was<00:01:22.500> going<00:01:22.619> to<00:01:22.710> use<00:01:22.890> it

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
because originally I was going to use it

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.080 
because originally I was going to use it
going<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:23.880> use<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.119> old<00:01:24.150> transporter<00:01:24.990> set<00:01:26.090> for

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
going to use the old transporter set for

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.109 
going to use the old transporter set for
the<00:01:27.270> psychs<00:01:28.140> grave<00:01:28.650> ranch<00:01:28.890> for<00:01:29.189> set<00:01:29.460> but<00:01:29.909> now

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
since I got this it looks a hell a lot

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.840 
since I got this it looks a hell a lot
better<00:01:33.000> and<00:01:33.500> since<00:01:34.500> I<00:01:34.710> yeah<00:01:35.280> here's<00:01:35.520> my<00:01:35.579> new

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
better and since I yeah here's my new

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.690 
better and since I yeah here's my new
psych<00:01:36.630> action<00:01:37.079> figure<00:01:37.380> with<00:01:37.470> new<00:01:37.700> possibility

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
psych action figure with new possibility

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.179 
psych action figure with new possibility
at<00:01:39.030> least<00:01:39.210> effing<00:01:39.840> all<00:01:40.020> fits<00:01:40.350> now<00:01:40.590> so<00:01:40.920> tails

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
at least effing all fits now so tails

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.880 
at least effing all fits now so tails
will<00:01:41.450> teleport<00:01:42.450> sonic<00:01:42.960> away<00:01:43.110> and<00:01:43.320> speaking

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
will teleport sonic away and speaking

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.800 
will teleport sonic away and speaking
teleporting<00:01:44.579> I'll<00:01:44.790> show<00:01:45.210> you<00:01:45.270> how<00:01:45.479> it<00:01:45.600> works

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
teleporting I'll show you how it works

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.050 
teleporting I'll show you how it works
because<00:01:46.470> there's<00:01:46.920> a<00:01:47.009> switch<00:01:47.280> over<00:01:47.460> here<00:01:50.060> you

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
because there's a switch over here you

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.600 
because there's a switch over here you
see<00:01:51.240> everything<00:01:51.689> turns<00:01:51.930> on<00:01:52.369> now<00:01:53.369> they<00:01:53.549> were

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
see everything turns on now they were

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.200 
see everything turns on now they were
just<00:01:53.909> turn<00:01:54.420> off<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.659> light<00:01:54.840> and<00:01:56.000> you<00:01:57.000> can

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
just turn off the light and you can

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.209 
just turn off the light and you can
still<00:01:57.420> see<00:01:57.450> and<00:01:57.750> there's<00:01:58.200> a<00:01:58.259> little<00:01:58.439> door<00:01:58.799> over

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
still see and there's a little door over

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.600 
still see and there's a little door over
here<00:01:59.780> however<00:02:00.780> you<00:02:01.200> can<00:02:01.770> see<00:02:01.860> that<00:02:01.890> my<00:02:02.189> hand<00:02:02.430> is

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
here however you can see that my hand is

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.179 
here however you can see that my hand is
like<00:02:02.790> trans<00:02:03.090> burn<00:02:03.360> I'm<00:02:03.659> like<00:02:03.810> a<00:02:03.840> ghost<00:02:04.229> so

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
like trans burn I'm like a ghost so

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.789
