00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
dirty around the bottom but got tons of

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.770 
dirty around the bottom but got tons of
riding<00:00:43.370> so<00:00:44.370> far<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.789> robbers<00:00:45.090> not<00:00:45.270> even<00:00:45.510> torn

riding so far the robbers not even torn

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.310 
riding so far the robbers not even torn
yet<00:00:45.989> I<00:00:46.200> mean<00:00:46.739> if<00:00:47.340> you<00:00:47.489> look<00:00:47.670> at<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:48.059> front<00:00:48.780> it's

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
yet I mean if you look at the front it's

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.279 
yet I mean if you look at the front it's
a<00:00:49.410> little<00:00:49.770> like<00:00:50.480> scraped<00:00:51.480> up<00:00:51.629> there<00:00:51.899> but

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
a little like scraped up there but

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.080 
a little like scraped up there but
barely<00:00:53.039> but<00:00:53.969> you<00:00:54.090> can't<00:00:54.329> even<00:00:54.449> really<00:00:54.629> tell

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:56.090 
barely but you can't even really tell

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.709 
barely but you can't even really tell
did<00:00:57.090> have<00:00:57.270> one<00:00:57.840> rip<00:00:58.079> on<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.379> other<00:00:58.530> shoe<00:00:59.719> from

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
did have one rip on the other shoe from

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.950 
did have one rip on the other shoe from
when<00:01:00.870> I<00:01:00.899> was<00:01:01.020> skateboarding<00:01:02.449> right<00:01:03.449> there<00:01:03.719> I

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
when I was skateboarding right there I

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.130 
when I was skateboarding right there I
do<00:01:04.920> find<00:01:05.369> that<00:01:05.610> this<00:01:05.909> leather<00:01:06.420> so<00:01:06.750> far<00:01:06.990> this

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
do find that this leather so far this

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.690 
do find that this leather so far this
leather<00:01:07.439> doesn't<00:01:07.860> seem<00:01:08.130> like<00:01:08.280> it's<00:01:08.400> too<00:01:08.520> tough

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
leather doesn't seem like it's too tough

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.570 
leather doesn't seem like it's too tough
I<00:01:09.000> mean<00:01:09.780> I<00:01:09.960> was<00:01:10.110> thinking<00:01:10.710> that<00:01:10.920> when<00:01:11.250> I<00:01:11.310> first

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
I mean I was thinking that when I first

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.010 
I mean I was thinking that when I first
got<00:01:11.760> it<00:01:11.939> I<00:01:12.030> was<00:01:12.150> thinking<00:01:12.479> it<00:01:12.600> would<00:01:12.689> be<00:01:12.840> really

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
got it I was thinking it would be really

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.480 
got it I was thinking it would be really
strong<00:01:13.380> because<00:01:13.770> it's<00:01:13.950> going<00:01:14.040> to<00:01:14.100> reinforce

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
strong because it's going to reinforce

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.480 
strong because it's going to reinforce
it<00:01:14.670> rather<00:01:14.820> than<00:01:15.090> just<00:01:15.330> having<00:01:16.490> stitching

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
it rather than just having stitching

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.260 
it rather than just having stitching
along<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.909> side<00:01:18.119> like<00:01:18.840> a<00:01:19.320> lot<00:01:19.560> of<00:01:19.680> shoes<00:01:19.860> have

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
along the side like a lot of shoes have

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.929 
along the side like a lot of shoes have
but<00:01:21.530> it's<00:01:22.530> really<00:01:22.740> not<00:01:22.920> doing<00:01:23.130> making<00:01:23.820> that

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
but it's really not doing making that

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.990 
but it's really not doing making that
much<00:01:24.119> of<00:01:24.240> a<00:01:24.299> difference<00:01:24.330> but<00:01:24.689> I<00:01:25.229> mean<00:01:26.070> it<00:01:26.670> is<00:01:26.970> a

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
much of a difference but I mean it is a

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.420 
much of a difference but I mean it is a
little<00:01:27.210> bit<00:01:27.390> better<00:01:27.540> but<00:01:27.869> it<00:01:28.680> really<00:01:29.189> doesn't

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
little bit better but it really doesn't

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.100 
little bit better but it really doesn't
make<00:01:29.610> a<00:01:29.670> big<00:01:29.880> difference<00:01:30.060> but<00:01:30.540> it<00:01:30.630> does<00:01:30.750> look<00:01:30.780> a

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
make a big difference but it does look a

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.630 
make a big difference but it does look a
lot<00:01:31.259> cooler<00:01:31.520> so<00:01:33.530> yeah<00:01:34.530> so<00:01:34.799> there's<00:01:35.189> there

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
lot cooler so yeah so there's there

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.450 
lot cooler so yeah so there's there
they're<00:01:36.470> standing<00:01:37.470> up<00:01:37.590> to<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.829> whole<00:01:38.009> grip

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
they're standing up to the whole grip

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.060 
they're standing up to the whole grip
tape<00:01:38.670> and<00:01:38.960> there<00:01:39.960> they're<00:01:40.500> doing<00:01:40.710> pretty<00:01:40.890> good

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
tape and there they're doing pretty good

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.719 
tape and there they're doing pretty good
they're<00:01:41.280> not<00:01:41.400> ripping<00:01:41.899> you're<00:01:42.899> not<00:01:43.729> wearing

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
they're not ripping you're not wearing

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.969 
they're not ripping you're not wearing
down<00:01:44.880> on<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.180> rubber<00:01:45.360> at<00:01:45.630> all<00:01:45.780> so<00:01:46.770> so<00:01:46.950> far

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
down on the rubber at all so so far

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.149 
down on the rubber at all so so far
they're<00:01:47.340> pretty<00:01:47.520> good<00:01:47.700> for<00:01:47.909> durability

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:49.159 
they're pretty good for durability

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:51.830 
they're pretty good for durability
they're<00:01:50.159> still<00:01:50.399> really<00:01:50.520> comfortable<00:01:51.119> they

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
they're still really comfortable they

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.649 
they're still really comfortable they
haven't<00:01:51.990> changed<00:01:52.439> from<00:01:52.530> that<00:01:52.710> yet<00:01:52.890> the

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 
haven't changed from that yet the

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:56.529 
haven't changed from that yet the
uh<00:01:53.689> it<00:01:54.590> still<00:01:54.979> feels<00:01:55.009> like<00:01:55.369> walking<00:01:55.909> around<00:01:56.119> in

00:01:56.529 --> 00:01:56.539 
uh it still feels like walking around in

00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:00.249 
uh it still feels like walking around in
brand-new<00:01:57.499> shoe<00:01:58.450> isn't<00:01:59.450> a<00:01:59.810> hundred<00:02:00.170> percent

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:00.259 
brand-new shoe isn't a hundred percent

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:02.139 
brand-new shoe isn't a hundred percent
broken<00:02:00.740> in<00:02:00.859> yet<00:02:01.009> I<00:02:01.219> mean<00:02:01.640> like<00:02:01.789> they're<00:02:01.939> still

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:02.149 
broken in yet I mean like they're still

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:04.539 
broken in yet I mean like they're still
there<00:02:02.210> pretty<00:02:02.509> good<00:02:02.689> but<00:02:03.560> I<00:02:03.799> haven't<00:02:04.009> broken

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:04.549

know about anybody else but like if you
look<00:02:42.950> at<00:02:43.099> it<00:02:43.129> that's<00:02:44.000> the<00:02:44.360> top<00:02:44.840> soul<00:02:45.190> it's

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
look at it that's the top soul it's

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.250 
look at it that's the top soul it's
pretty<00:02:46.459> thin<00:02:46.790> and<00:02:46.970> then<00:02:47.540> you<00:02:47.720> go<00:02:47.840> right<00:02:47.870> down

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
pretty thin and then you go right down

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.580 
pretty thin and then you go right down
to<00:02:48.790> the<00:02:49.790> bottom<00:02:50.000> right<00:02:50.359> which<00:02:50.989> is<00:02:51.109> still<00:02:51.530> a

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
to the bottom right which is still a

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:52.750 
to the bottom right which is still a
little<00:02:51.739> bit<00:02:51.920> cushiony<00:02:52.220> but<00:02:52.370> he<00:02:52.430> goes<00:02:52.549> right

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
little bit cushiony but he goes right

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.580 
little bit cushiony but he goes right
after<00:02:52.970> that<00:02:53.239> it's<00:02:53.390> the<00:02:53.480> rubber<00:02:53.660> so<00:02:54.290> you<00:02:54.319> don't

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
after that it's the rubber so you don't

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.740 
after that it's the rubber so you don't
have<00:02:54.769> too<00:02:55.010> much<00:02:55.040> protection<00:02:55.489> so<00:02:56.480> when<00:02:56.690> you

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
have too much protection so when you

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.280 
have too much protection so when you
step<00:02:56.930> on<00:02:57.079> a<00:02:57.109> rock<00:02:57.319> you<00:02:57.500> do<00:02:57.620> feel<00:02:57.859> it<00:02:58.040> but

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
step on a rock you do feel it but

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.349 
step on a rock you do feel it but
personally<00:03:00.290> I<00:03:00.650> would<00:03:01.250> like<00:03:01.430> to<00:03:01.459> get<00:03:01.730> a<00:03:01.790> thicker

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:02.359 
personally I would like to get a thicker

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:06.430 
personally I would like to get a thicker
soul<00:03:02.750> for<00:03:03.620> this<00:03:03.739> because<00:03:04.840> yeah<00:03:05.840> it<00:03:06.019> does

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
soul for this because yeah it does

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.490 
soul for this because yeah it does
bother<00:03:06.739> my<00:03:07.010> feet<00:03:07.220> a<00:03:07.250> little<00:03:07.459> bit<00:03:07.609> and<00:03:07.880> it's<00:03:08.500> it

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
guess it gets hard after you're pushing

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.170 
guess it gets hard after you're pushing
on<00:03:11.569> a<00:03:11.630> longboard<00:03:12.260> for<00:03:12.680> I<00:03:12.889> mean<00:03:13.340> I<00:03:13.430> go<00:03:13.609> for<00:03:13.760> hours
