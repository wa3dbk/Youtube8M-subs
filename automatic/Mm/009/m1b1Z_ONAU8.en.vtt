00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.810 
some boric acid now I've heard that you
can<00:00:30.510> get<00:00:30.720> boric<00:00:31.050> acid<00:00:31.170> at<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:31.890> pharmacies<00:00:32.610> I

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
can get boric acid at the pharmacies I

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.090 
can get boric acid at the pharmacies I
got<00:00:33.390> mana<00:00:33.600> off<00:00:33.870> a<00:00:33.899> special<00:00:34.230> chemistry<00:00:34.710> store

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
got mana off a special chemistry store

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.770 
got mana off a special chemistry store
but<00:00:35.370> I<00:00:35.579> think<00:00:35.880> you<00:00:35.969> can<00:00:36.090> get<00:00:36.210> I<00:00:36.239> bet<00:00:36.570> you<00:00:36.660> can

can off a website so go ahead and try

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.690 
can off a website so go ahead and try
that<00:00:41.870> you're<00:00:42.870> also<00:00:42.989> going<00:00:43.110> to<00:00:43.260> need<00:00:43.379> some

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:43.700 
that you're also going to need some

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.930 
that you're also going to need some
methanol<00:00:44.700> or<00:00:44.969> methyl<00:00:45.570> alcohol<00:00:46.280> now<00:00:47.280> you<00:00:47.789> can

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
methanol or methyl alcohol now you can

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.540 
methanol or methyl alcohol now you can
get<00:00:48.059> this<00:00:48.239> at<00:00:48.510> an<00:00:48.690> auto<00:00:48.960> store<00:00:49.350> but<00:00:50.100> they

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
get this at an auto store but they

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.040 
get this at an auto store but they
probably<00:00:50.820> won't<00:00:51.120> know<00:00:51.329> what<00:00:51.510> as<00:00:51.629> methyl

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
probably won't know what as methyl

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.750 
probably won't know what as methyl
alcohol<00:00:52.230> or<00:00:52.649> methanol<00:00:53.039> because<00:00:53.100> I've<00:00:53.520> already

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
alcohol or methanol because I've already

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:54.979 
alcohol or methanol because I've already
tried<00:00:53.969> that<00:00:54.239> they'll<00:00:54.420> probably<00:00:54.600> know<00:00:54.840> it

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
tried that they'll probably know it

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.619 
tried that they'll probably know it
better<00:00:55.110> as<00:00:55.550> gasline<00:00:56.550> antifreeze<00:00:57.300> and<00:00:57.360> water

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
better as gasline antifreeze and water

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.930 
better as gasline antifreeze and water
remover<00:00:58.350> now<00:00:59.100> make<00:00:59.309> sure<00:00:59.340> to<00:00:59.520> say

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
remover now make sure to say

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.209 
remover now make sure to say
specifically<00:01:00.449> gasline<00:01:01.230> antifreeze<00:01:01.890> because

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
specifically gasline antifreeze because

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.160 
specifically gasline antifreeze because
gasoline<00:01:02.460> antifreeze<00:01:03.120> and<00:01:03.180> antifreeze<00:01:03.870> for

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
gasoline antifreeze and antifreeze for

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.080 
gasoline antifreeze and antifreeze for
cars<00:01:04.379> is<00:01:04.650> different<00:01:05.189> stuff<00:01:05.400> so<00:01:05.640> make<00:01:05.880> sure<00:01:05.909> you

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
cars is different stuff so make sure you

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.630 
cars is different stuff so make sure you
they<00:01:06.540> know<00:01:06.689> what<00:01:06.810> you're<00:01:06.930> talking<00:01:07.200> about

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
they know what you're talking about

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.530 
they know what you're talking about
and<00:01:08.640> also<00:01:08.850> you<00:01:09.000> could<00:01:09.119> you're<00:01:09.240> just<00:01:09.420> gonna

and also you could you're just gonna

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.670 
and also you could you're just gonna
need<00:01:09.689> a<00:01:09.750> fire<00:01:09.990> source<00:01:10.290> I'm<00:01:10.470> choosing<00:01:10.860> matches

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
need a fire source I'm choosing matches

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.710 
need a fire source I'm choosing matches
what<00:01:13.680> you're<00:01:13.799> gonna<00:01:13.890> do<00:01:14.010> first<00:01:14.250> is<00:01:14.520> pour<00:01:15.509> some

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
what you're gonna do first is pour some

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.170 
what you're gonna do first is pour some
boric<00:01:16.080> acid<00:01:16.259> into<00:01:16.710> a<00:01:16.799> container<00:01:17.189> now<00:01:17.970> make

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
boric acid into a container now make

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.880 
boric acid into a container now make
sure<00:01:18.210> this<00:01:18.360> containers<00:01:18.840> not<00:01:19.049> react<00:01:19.439> with<00:01:19.590> fire

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
sure this containers not react with fire

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.830 
sure this containers not react with fire
this<00:01:20.400> doesn't<00:01:20.729> burn<00:01:20.939> or<00:01:21.119> melt<00:01:21.150> or<00:01:21.479> anything

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
this doesn't burn or melt or anything

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.280 
this doesn't burn or melt or anything
and<00:01:22.259> also<00:01:23.040> though<00:01:23.610> I'm<00:01:23.880> just<00:01:23.939> using<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.479> cap

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
and also though I'm just using the cap

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.490 
and also though I'm just using the cap
of<00:01:25.470> a<00:01:25.619> can<00:01:26.240> and<00:01:27.240> just<00:01:27.479> because<00:01:27.659> I<00:01:27.930> only<00:01:28.229> need<00:01:28.470> a

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
of a can and just because I only need a

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.679 
of a can and just because I only need a
little<00:01:28.799> bit<00:01:28.890> of<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.040> flame<00:01:29.310> you<00:01:29.610> can<00:01:30.090> go<00:01:30.240> ahead

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
little bit of the flame you can go ahead

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.679 
little bit of the flame you can go ahead
and<00:01:30.900> use<00:01:31.020> pan<00:01:31.409> or<00:01:31.799> a<00:01:32.130> pan<00:01:32.820> or<00:01:33.000> something<00:01:33.450> else

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
and use pan or a pan or something else

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.450 
and use pan or a pan or something else
bigger<00:01:34.079> than<00:01:34.290> this<00:01:34.439> so<00:01:34.710> you<00:01:34.740> can<00:01:34.890> get<00:01:35.070> a<00:01:35.100> bigger

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
bigger than this so you can get a bigger

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.539 
bigger than this so you can get a bigger
and<00:01:35.700> longer<00:01:35.850> flame<00:01:36.299> but<00:01:37.200> beware<00:01:37.619> that<00:01:37.860> after

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
and longer flame but beware that after

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.730 
and longer flame but beware that after
you<00:01:38.640> if<00:01:38.850> you<00:01:39.180> use<00:01:39.450> a<00:01:39.479> pan<00:01:40.110> or<00:01:40.140> something<00:01:40.590> else

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
you if you use a pan or something else

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.590 
you if you use a pan or something else
that<00:01:40.890> you<00:01:40.950> used<00:01:41.130> to<00:01:41.250> cook<00:01:41.430> food<00:01:41.759> or<00:01:42.030> eat<00:01:42.270> food

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
that you used to cook food or eat food

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.620 
that you used to cook food or eat food
in<00:01:42.840> don't<00:01:43.740> ever<00:01:44.040> eat<00:01:44.460> food<00:01:44.850> out<00:01:45.030> of<00:01:45.090> that<00:01:45.210> again

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
in don't ever eat food out of that again

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.690 
in don't ever eat food out of that again
because<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:46.380> antifreeze<00:01:47.040> and<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.399> boric

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
because the antifreeze and the boric

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.639 
because the antifreeze and the boric
acid<00:01:47.820> no<00:01:48.540> matter<00:01:48.720> how<00:01:48.930> well<00:01:49.140> you<00:01:49.170> wash<00:01:49.439> it<00:01:49.590> it

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
acid no matter how well you wash it it

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.190 
acid no matter how well you wash it it
still<00:01:49.920> will<00:01:50.159> remain<00:01:50.939> in<00:01:51.119> there<00:01:51.270> and<00:01:51.479> you

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
still will remain in there and you

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.539 
still will remain in there and you
definitely<00:01:52.530> don't<00:01:52.860> want<00:01:53.009> that<00:01:53.070> stuff<00:01:53.340> in<00:01:53.430> your

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
definitely don't want that stuff in your

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.240 
definitely don't want that stuff in your
food<00:01:54.290> so<00:01:55.290> let<00:01:55.619> me<00:01:55.680> get<00:01:55.829> a<00:01:55.860> little<00:01:55.979> bit<00:01:56.100> the

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
food so let me get a little bit the

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.310 
food so let me get a little bit the
boric<00:01:56.759> acid<00:01:56.880> and<00:01:57.270> pour<00:01:57.869> a<00:01:57.930> little<00:01:58.049> bit<00:01:58.229> in

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
boric acid and pour a little bit in

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:06.000 
boric acid and pour a little bit in
there<00:02:00.140> not<00:02:01.140> too<00:02:01.320> much

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.010 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:12.100 

then<00:02:07.600> get<00:02:08.600> the<00:02:08.840> anti<00:02:09.740> freeze<00:02:10.060> anti<00:02:11.060> freeze<00:02:11.300> and

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
then get the anti freeze anti freeze and

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:27.199 
then get the anti freeze anti freeze and
for<00:02:12.380> some<00:02:12.560> that<00:02:12.800> in<00:02:12.950> there

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.059 

alright<00:02:27.840> the<00:02:27.959> antifreeze<00:02:28.260> actually<00:02:28.799> burns

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
alright the antifreeze actually burns

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:32.959 
alright the antifreeze actually burns
pretty<00:02:29.790> long<00:02:30.090> so<00:02:30.569> don't<00:02:31.159> you<00:02:32.159> know<00:02:32.340> you<00:02:32.670> just

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:32.969 
pretty long so don't you know you just

00:02:32.969 --> 00:02:35.240 
pretty long so don't you know you just
thought<00:02:33.120> I<00:02:33.269> did<00:02:33.420> not<00:02:33.569> pour<00:02:33.840> that<00:02:34.019> much<00:02:34.349> and

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
thought I did not pour that much and

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.699 
thought I did not pour that much and
that<00:02:35.579> well<00:02:35.969> what<00:02:36.150> I<00:02:36.180> just<00:02:36.420> poured<00:02:36.689> the<00:02:37.140> burns

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
that well what I just poured the burns

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:40.490 
that well what I just poured the burns
for<00:02:38.040> maybe<00:02:38.219> a<00:02:38.310> minute<00:02:38.549> or<00:02:38.730> so<00:02:39.060> or<00:02:39.959> two<00:02:40.170> anyway

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
for maybe a minute or so or two anyway

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.000 
for maybe a minute or so or two anyway
it<00:02:40.739> burns<00:02:40.920> for<00:02:41.250> a<00:02:41.280> good<00:02:41.609> amount<00:02:41.819> of<00:02:41.939> time<00:02:43.010> let

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
it burns for a good amount of time let

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.449 
it burns for a good amount of time let
me<00:02:44.099> get<00:02:44.280> that<00:02:44.459> out<00:02:44.519> of<00:02:44.700> the<00:02:44.760> way<00:02:45.650> yeah<00:02:46.650> mix<00:02:47.340> it

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
me get that out of the way yeah mix it

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.660 
me get that out of the way yeah mix it
up<00:02:47.579> mix<00:02:47.609> it<00:02:47.939> in<00:02:48.090> a<00:02:48.150> little<00:02:48.359> bit<00:02:48.450> then<00:02:49.670> just

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
up mix it in a little bit then just

00:02:50.670 --> 00:03:04.250 
up mix it in a little bit then just
light<00:02:51.030> it<00:02:51.209> on<00:02:51.269> fire

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.570 

again<00:03:05.260> please<00:03:05.500> be<00:03:05.530> very<00:03:05.830> careful<00:03:06.070> the<00:03:06.370> green

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.580 
again please be very careful the green

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:12.840 
again please be very careful the green
flame<00:03:06.850> is<00:03:07.180> very<00:03:07.630> intense<00:03:11.130> let<00:03:12.130> me<00:03:12.220> just<00:03:12.370> let

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
flame is very intense let me just let

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:34.000 
flame is very intense let me just let
you<00:03:12.970> enjoy<00:03:13.240> that<00:03:13.420> for<00:03:13.570> a<00:03:13.600> little<00:03:13.690> bit

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:35.770 

now<00:03:34.550> you're<00:03:34.700> probably<00:03:34.849> wondering<00:03:35.510> why<00:03:35.720> does

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
now you're probably wondering why does

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:37.869 
now you're probably wondering why does
it<00:03:36.050> burn<00:03:36.230> green<00:03:36.650> and<00:03:36.830> not<00:03:36.950> any<00:03:37.159> other<00:03:37.280> color

00:03:37.869 --> 00:03:37.879 
it burn green and not any other color

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:41.289 
it burn green and not any other color
well<00:03:38.720> the<00:03:39.200> anti<00:03:39.860> freeze<00:03:40.129> anti<00:03:40.790> freeze<00:03:41.000> just

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:41.299 
well the anti freeze anti freeze just

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:44.080 
well the anti freeze anti freeze just
acts<00:03:41.569> as<00:03:41.780> a<00:03:41.840> good<00:03:42.260> fuel<00:03:42.739> so<00:03:43.610> that<00:03:43.640> will<00:03:43.940> burn

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 
acts as a good fuel so that will burn

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.580 
acts as a good fuel so that will burn
long<00:03:44.360> and<00:03:44.599> the<00:03:45.560> boron<00:03:46.010> in<00:03:46.459> the<00:03:46.790> boric<00:03:47.330> acid

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
long and the boron in the boric acid

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.600 
long and the boron in the boric acid
makes<00:03:48.590> the<00:03:48.709> fire<00:03:48.890> actually<00:03:49.129> green<00:03:50.950> so<00:03:51.950> even

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:52.610 
makes the fire actually green so even

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:54.009 
makes the fire actually green so even
now<00:03:52.640> you'll<00:03:52.970> see<00:03:53.150> the<00:03:53.239> little<00:03:53.360> flashes<00:03:53.840> of<00:03:53.930> it

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:54.019 
now you'll see the little flashes of it

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:56.259 
now you'll see the little flashes of it
here<00:03:54.170> and<00:03:54.230> there<00:03:54.290> but<00:03:54.500> eventually<00:03:54.739> as<00:03:55.640> the

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:56.269 
here and there but eventually as the

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:57.789 
here and there but eventually as the
flame<00:03:56.599> burns<00:03:56.840> longer<00:03:57.080> you'll<00:03:57.379> see<00:03:57.530> more<00:03:57.739> and

00:03:57.789 --> 00:03:57.799 
flame burns longer you'll see more and

00:03:57.799 --> 00:03:59.770 
flame burns longer you'll see more and
more<00:03:58.010> of<00:03:58.129> little<00:03:58.430> red<00:03:58.670> flashes<00:03:59.360> of<00:03:59.510> flame

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
more of little red flashes of flame

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.410 
more of little red flashes of flame
that's<00:04:00.739> because<00:04:01.099> the<00:04:01.250> actual<00:04:01.610> boron<00:04:01.970> is<00:04:02.180> just

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:02.420 
that's because the actual boron is just

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:05.050 
that's because the actual boron is just
burning<00:04:02.870> out<00:04:03.019> and<00:04:03.049> leaving<00:04:03.799> just<00:04:03.829> the<00:04:04.129> anti

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060 
burning out and leaving just the anti

00:04:05.060 --> 00:05:37.680 
burning out and leaving just the anti
freeze<00:04:05.299> which<00:04:05.510> burns<00:04:05.810> red

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:37.690 

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:39.480 

alright<00:05:38.350> bye<00:05:38.590> now<00:05:38.740> you're<00:05:38.920> starting<00:05:39.220> to<00:05:39.310> see<00:05:39.460> a

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:39.490 
alright bye now you're starting to see a

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:41.850 
alright bye now you're starting to see a
lot<00:05:39.760> of<00:05:39.790> red<00:05:40.390> fire<00:05:40.720> flashing<00:05:41.440> here<00:05:41.650> and<00:05:41.740> there

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:41.860 
lot of red fire flashing here and there

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:44.370 
lot of red fire flashing here and there
and<00:05:42.430> that<00:05:42.580> just<00:05:42.820> means<00:05:42.970> that<00:05:43.150> the<00:05:43.300> barn<00:05:44.200> is

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:44.380 
and that just means that the barn is

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:48.780 
and that just means that the barn is
burning<00:05:44.410> out<00:05:46.110> so<00:05:47.110> you<00:05:47.680> just<00:05:47.860> saw<00:05:48.040> that<00:05:48.340> the

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:48.790 
burning out so you just saw that the

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:52.800 
burning out so you just saw that the
flame<00:05:49.360> just<00:05:50.020> burned<00:05:50.290> for<00:05:50.590> a<00:05:50.620> good<00:05:51.040> maybe<00:05:51.970> three

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:52.810 
flame just burned for a good maybe three

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:55.380 
flame just burned for a good maybe three
or<00:05:52.840> four<00:05:53.020> minutes<00:05:53.560> now<00:05:53.620> and<00:05:54.220> I<00:05:54.700> just<00:05:54.910> put<00:05:55.120> just

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:55.390 
or four minutes now and I just put just

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:57.270 
or four minutes now and I just put just
a<00:05:55.540> tiny<00:05:55.780> bit<00:05:55.960> of<00:05:56.080> one<00:05:56.290> on<00:05:56.500> a<00:05:56.590> tiny<00:05:56.860> bit<00:05:57.130> of

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:57.280 
a tiny bit of one on a tiny bit of

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:59.460 
a tiny bit of one on a tiny bit of
antifreeze<00:05:57.700> so<00:05:58.270> you<00:05:58.750> don't<00:05:58.930> need<00:05:59.050> much<00:05:59.290> to

00:05:59.460 --> 00:05:59.470 
antifreeze so you don't need much to

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:03.200 
antifreeze so you don't need much to
make<00:05:59.620> a<00:05:59.650> blonde<00:06:00.010> flame<00:06:00.430> a<00:06:00.760> long-lasting<00:06:01.690> flame

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:03.210 
make a blonde flame a long-lasting flame

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:13.000 
make a blonde flame a long-lasting flame
now<00:06:04.210> it's<00:06:04.360> just<00:06:04.450> dying<00:06:04.780> it<00:06:04.960> out

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:13.010 

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:16.630
