later<00:01:38.920> in<00:01:39.070> this<00:01:39.159> video<00:01:39.340> will<00:01:39.729> demonstrate<00:01:39.909> the

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:40.300 
later in this video will demonstrate the

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:46.170 
later in this video will demonstrate the
practicality<00:01:41.170> of<00:01:41.200> these<00:01:41.440> features

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.180 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.060 

let's<00:01:46.840> begin<00:01:47.020> with<00:01:47.200> the<00:01:47.410> fuselage<00:01:47.830> of<00:01:47.860> the

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
let's begin with the fuselage of the

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.340 
let's begin with the fuselage of the
aircraft<00:01:48.160> and<00:01:48.760> specifically<00:01:49.570> the<00:01:49.750> engine<00:01:50.170> and

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
aircraft and specifically the engine and

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.950 
aircraft and specifically the engine and
its<00:01:50.470> compartment<00:01:50.910> we<00:01:51.910> begin<00:01:52.270> treating<00:01:52.750> our

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 
its compartment we begin treating our

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.170 
its compartment we begin treating our
engine<00:01:53.320> and<00:01:53.440> make<00:01:53.800> an<00:01:53.950> attempt<00:01:54.310> to<00:01:54.490> reach<00:01:54.910> all

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:55.180 
engine and make an attempt to reach all

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.100 
engine and make an attempt to reach all
areas<00:01:57.060> moving<00:01:58.060> to<00:01:58.390> the<00:01:58.510> other<00:01:58.660> side<00:01:58.900> of<00:01:58.930> the

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
areas moving to the other side of the

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:11.320 
areas moving to the other side of the
engine<00:01:59.260> we've<00:01:59.920> continued<00:02:00.370> the<00:02:00.490> process

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.840 

let's<00:02:12.020> now<00:02:12.260> go<00:02:12.530> to<00:02:12.560> the<00:02:12.740> nose<00:02:12.980> gear<00:02:13.310> and<00:02:13.550> wheel

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
let's now go to the nose gear and wheel

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.170 
let's now go to the nose gear and wheel
well<00:02:14.150> again<00:02:14.960> the<00:02:15.440> process<00:02:15.680> is<00:02:16.100> simplified<00:02:16.550> by

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
well again the process is simplified by

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.840 
well again the process is simplified by
using<00:02:17.210> a<00:02:17.630> wand<00:02:17.870> and<00:02:18.230> letting<00:02:18.830> the<00:02:18.950> spray<00:02:19.280> do

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
using a wand and letting the spray do

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:22.000 
using a wand and letting the spray do
the<00:02:19.970> work<00:02:20.150> the<00:02:20.930> amount<00:02:21.230> of<00:02:21.290> material<00:02:21.740> used

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
the work the amount of material used

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.130 
the work the amount of material used
will<00:02:22.370> vary<00:02:22.670> depending<00:02:22.940> on<00:02:23.450> the<00:02:23.570> condition<00:02:23.600> of

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
will vary depending on the condition of

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.740 
will vary depending on the condition of
the<00:02:24.230> aircraft<00:02:24.910> now<00:02:25.910> moving<00:02:26.180> to<00:02:26.420> the<00:02:26.510> cockpit

remember<00:02:28.100> we're<00:02:28.550> first<00:02:28.880> fogging<00:02:29.180> all<00:02:29.540> areas

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
remember we're first fogging all areas

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.560 
remember we're first fogging all areas
through<00:02:30.740> the<00:02:30.860> access<00:02:31.340> plates<00:02:31.670> into<00:02:32.000> the<00:02:32.390> belly

inspection ports and all areas of the

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.940 
inspection ports and all areas of the
aircraft<00:03:47.330> should<00:03:47.780> be<00:03:47.930> treated<00:03:48.290> because<00:03:48.470> all

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
aircraft should be treated because all

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.820 
aircraft should be treated because all
