00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:05.760
 the fifth part of this mini is worth 

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:10.900
 gameplay of gru my favorite villain 

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:13.380
 cameras but get away a little and focused 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.150
 well, not this 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.640
 I did not have more details about the incident 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.970
 apart to emphasize that the building does not 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.300
 it's not a bank that has said anything about 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.759
 from a bank 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.769
 an object that seemed to be the engine of a 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:28.599
 rocket has been seen through the streets of 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:31.329
 center led by what witnesses 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:37.500
 describe as a group of plumbers 

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:41.900
 were the concepts available 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:44.960
 good to paste our guido 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:47.320
 is going to make one 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.150
 OK OK 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:54.800
 today is joy 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:59.150
 ok so let's make one more level of 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:01.820
 more than the social level of the den of 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:03.530
 vector and I think it's going to cut the 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.010
 instep I know how many parts will last 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:09.510
 this but good to see 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.510
 your uncle 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:17.490
 we need a coating not 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.490
 existing for the rocket 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:32.799
 do not even think about touching the mobile with 

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:36.630
 the house vector fingers the lab 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:36.630
 of languages 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.549
 good 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.210
 questions and I arrived 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:58.040
 what more adriÃ¡n thing that I have said to you 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:07.260
 we are in the vector den the 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:09.740
 archenemy of the group that you see there 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:12.780
 adriano is recording well is the brou 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:16.640
 but I'm recording well take everything is 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:19.640
 promised it's worth and now what weapon do we have 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.640
 we follow 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.560
 that has been the vector voice 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.800
 to freeze 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.120
 and there we see 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:26.870
 just after the day before but that 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.870
 if not 

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:38.040
 at last 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.560
 something like that 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:57.280
 it already 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:03.530
 today he told us the story 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:07.099
 that you 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:22.650
 but in the series 

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:37.570
 and now 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:37.570
 or I will do 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.560
 but same 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:53.410
 but let's see what the hell is burning me
