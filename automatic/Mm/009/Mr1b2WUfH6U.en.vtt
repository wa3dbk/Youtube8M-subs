packaging you can see it's it's all it's

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.350 
packaging you can see it's it's all it's
different<00:01:20.580> than<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.790> memory<00:01:21.060> gadget

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
different than the memory gadget

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.910 
different than the memory gadget
packaging<00:01:21.720> it's<00:01:21.840> not<00:01:21.930> a<00:01:21.960> box<00:01:22.290> it's<00:01:22.560> like<00:01:22.770> in

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
packaging it's not a box it's like in

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.160 
packaging it's not a box it's like in
this<00:01:23.070> thing<00:01:23.759> here<00:01:24.090> you<00:01:24.119> like<00:01:24.450> you<00:01:24.840> slip<00:01:25.080> the

this thing here you like you slip the
back<00:01:25.320> and<00:01:25.560> it<00:01:25.680> folds<00:01:26.100> open<00:01:26.420> and<00:01:27.420> I<00:01:27.750> just<00:01:27.960> pulled

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
back and it folds open and I just pulled

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.020 
back and it folds open and I just pulled
over<00:01:28.409> on<00:01:28.530> one<00:01:28.680> side<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.250> pull<00:01:29.579> this<00:01:29.700> stuff<00:01:29.909> out

over on one side and pull this stuff out

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.230 
over on one side and pull this stuff out
of<00:01:30.090> it<00:01:30.470> so<00:01:31.470> it's<00:01:31.619> kind<00:01:31.799> of<00:01:31.829> like<00:01:32.070> it<00:01:32.790> reminds<00:01:33.090> me

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
of it so it's kind of like it reminds me

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.100 
of it so it's kind of like it reminds me
of<00:01:33.420> like<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:34.619> SI<00:01:35.280> c<00:01:35.340> ome<00:01:36.090> tamashii<00:01:36.570> packaging

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
of like the SI c ome tamashii packaging

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.200 
of like the SI c ome tamashii packaging
type<00:01:37.320> thing<00:01:37.560> so<00:01:37.799> that's<00:01:38.490> kind<00:01:38.759> of<00:01:38.790> nice<00:01:38.939> it's

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
type thing so that's kind of nice it's

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.819 
type thing so that's kind of nice it's
different<00:01:39.570> it's<00:01:39.780> cheaper<00:01:40.170> i<00:01:40.200> guess<00:01:40.470> i<00:01:40.619> think

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
different it's cheaper i guess i think

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.520 
different it's cheaper i guess i think
or<00:01:41.420> their<00:01:42.420> neck<00:01:42.570> a<00:01:42.600> little<00:01:42.720> easier<00:01:43.170> to<00:01:43.200> ship<00:01:44.149> so

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
or their neck a little easier to ship so

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.200 
or their neck a little easier to ship so
here<00:01:46.530> we<00:01:46.649> have<00:01:46.680> when<00:01:47.520> it<00:01:47.549> comes<00:01:47.640> with<00:01:48.000> the

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
here we have when it comes with the

here we have when it comes with the
topic<00:01:48.600> android<00:01:49.049> and<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.380> cell<00:01:49.829> metal<00:01:50.299> so

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
topic android and the cell metal so

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.539 
topic android and the cell metal so
let's<00:01:51.450> look<00:01:51.540> at<00:01:51.659> this<00:01:51.750> in<00:01:51.810> can<00:01:52.140> mode<00:01:52.439> we<00:01:53.310> see

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
let's look at this in can mode we see

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.460 
let's look at this in can mode we see
all<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:54.060> way<00:01:54.149> around<00:01:54.240> is<00:01:54.630> this<00:01:54.780> gray<00:01:55.140> color

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.210 
writing so here we have the talk I sell
metal<00:02:24.340> I<00:02:24.970> see<00:02:25.900> the<00:02:26.020> taka<00:02:26.290> design<00:02:26.709> and<00:02:26.920> it's<00:02:27.010> all

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
metal I see the taka design and it's all

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.790 
metal I see the taka design and it's all
silver<00:02:28.209> on<00:02:28.390> the<00:02:28.480> back<00:02:28.630> it's<00:02:28.900> got<00:02:29.080> the<00:02:29.320> the<00:02:29.620> X

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
silver on the back it's got the the X

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.590 
silver on the back it's got the the X
design<00:02:32.430> like<00:02:33.430> the<00:02:33.550> cell<00:02:33.760> metals<00:02:34.090> have<00:02:34.270> and

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
design like the cell metals have and

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.800 
design like the cell metals have and
like<00:02:34.720> you<00:02:34.870> saw<00:02:35.170> on<00:02:35.500> the<00:02:35.560> little<00:02:35.890> fund

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
like you saw on the little fund

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.960 
like you saw on the little fund
foundation<00:02:37.810> XP<00:02:38.230> da<00:02:38.410> and<00:02:38.709> double<00:02:39.100> episode<00:02:39.220> 47

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
foundation XP da and double episode 47

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.040 
foundation XP da and double episode 47
so<00:02:40.450> that's<00:02:40.600> cool<00:02:40.720> and<00:02:42.390> let's<00:02:43.390> see<00:02:43.600> where<00:02:43.750> is<00:02:43.870> it

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050 
so that's cool and let's see where is it

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:50.130 
so that's cool and let's see where is it
here<00:02:44.530> yeah<00:02:46.140> here's<00:02:47.140> the<00:02:47.610> core<00:02:48.610> metal<00:02:48.970> for<00:02:49.870> taco

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
here yeah here's the core metal for taco

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.130 
here yeah here's the core metal for taco
from<00:02:50.820> the<00:02:51.820> O's<00:02:51.970> driver<00:02:52.420> and<00:02:52.720> then<00:02:52.810> we<00:02:52.870> have<00:02:53.019> the

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
from the O's driver and then we have the

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:54.630 
from the O's driver and then we have the
cell<00:02:53.380> metal<00:02:53.650> next<00:02:53.920> to<00:02:54.040> it<00:02:54.160> so<00:02:54.190> it's<00:02:54.430> got<00:02:54.550> the

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
cell metal next to it so it's got the

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.030 
cell metal next to it so it's got the
same<00:02:54.820> design<00:02:55.530> the<00:02:56.530> back<00:02:57.060> obviously<00:02:58.060> different

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
same design the back obviously different

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.040 
same design the back obviously different
this<00:03:00.040> one<00:03:00.310> is<00:03:00.550> quite<00:03:01.239> heavy<00:03:01.450> because<00:03:01.720> of<00:03:01.930> the

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.050 
this one is quite heavy because of the

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.190 
this one is quite heavy because of the
diecast<00:03:02.709> this<00:03:03.400> one<00:03:03.610> is<00:03:03.820> just<00:03:03.850> all<00:03:04.239> plastic<00:03:05.019> so

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
diecast this one is just all plastic so

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:11.370 
diecast this one is just all plastic so
it's<00:03:05.380> really<00:03:05.739> light<00:03:06.010> and<00:03:09.959> there's<00:03:10.959> not<00:03:11.140> a<00:03:11.170> lot

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
it's really light and there's not a lot

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.850 
it's really light and there's not a lot
to<00:03:11.410> it<00:03:12.510> still<00:03:13.510> has<00:03:13.660> the<00:03:13.780> chip<00:03:13.989> inside<00:03:14.320> it<00:03:14.620> just

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:14.860 
to it still has the chip inside it just

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.670 
to it still has the chip inside it just
doesn't<00:03:15.220> have<00:03:15.340> the<00:03:15.370> weight<00:03:15.700> behind<00:03:16.209> it<00:03:16.680> so

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
doesn't have the weight behind it so

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.380 
doesn't have the weight behind it so
let's<00:03:17.950> go<00:03:18.100> ahead<00:03:18.130> and<00:03:18.340> take<00:03:18.489> this<00:03:18.820> can<00:03:19.090> draw<00:03:19.269> it

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
let's go ahead and take this can draw it

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.470 
let's go ahead and take this can draw it
and<00:03:19.510> transform<00:03:19.840> it<00:03:20.290> into<00:03:20.500> a<00:03:20.739> hawk<00:03:21.400> so<00:03:22.390> what

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
and transform it into a hawk so what

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:23.729 
and transform it into a hawk so what
we're<00:03:22.570> going<00:03:22.690> to<00:03:22.780> do<00:03:22.900> is<00:03:23.019> we're<00:03:23.170> going<00:03:23.290> to<00:03:23.350> pop

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739 
we're going to do is we're going to pop

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:25.670 
we're going to do is we're going to pop
the<00:03:23.920> top<00:03:24.100> and<00:03:24.610> flip<00:03:24.910> it<00:03:25.030> all<00:03:25.150> the<00:03:25.239> way<00:03:25.329> over

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
the top and flip it all the way over

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.430 
the top and flip it all the way over
turn<00:03:26.680> it<00:03:26.799> upside<00:03:26.950> down<00:03:27.750> and<00:03:28.750> then<00:03:28.989> you<00:03:29.110> can<00:03:29.260> see

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
turn it upside down and then you can see

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.110 
turn it upside down and then you can see
where<00:03:29.680> it's<00:03:29.829> all<00:03:29.950> connected<00:03:30.310> at<00:03:30.670> right<00:03:30.850> here

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
where it's all connected at right here

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.840 
where it's all connected at right here
so<00:03:31.329> we're<00:03:31.510> just<00:03:31.540> going<00:03:31.810> to<00:03:32.190> grab<00:03:33.190> both<00:03:33.519> sides

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:33.850 
so we're just going to grab both sides

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:39.840 
so we're just going to grab both sides
and<00:03:34.269> pull<00:03:35.230> and<00:03:37.680> pull<00:03:38.680> the<00:03:38.799> side<00:03:39.040> and<00:03:39.459> up<00:03:39.549> these

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850 
and pull and pull the side and up these

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:44.460 
and pull and pull the side and up these
are<00:03:40.000> the<00:03:40.060> wings<00:03:40.470> here<00:03:41.470> you<00:03:41.650> can<00:03:41.799> see<00:03:42.840> then<00:03:43.840> take

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
are the wings here you can see then take

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.979 
are the wings here you can see then take
the<00:03:44.620> head<00:03:44.829> fold<00:03:45.220> the<00:03:45.340> head<00:03:45.549> down<00:03:45.790> this<00:03:46.750> whole

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
the head fold the head down this whole

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:50.460 
the head fold the head down this whole
piece<00:03:47.230> is<00:03:47.440> the<00:03:47.560> tail<00:03:47.799> fold<00:03:48.280> it<00:03:48.489> back<00:03:49.260> the<00:03:50.260> tail

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
piece is the tail fold it back the tail

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:54.210 
piece is the tail fold it back the tail
splits<00:03:50.950> open<00:03:51.130> like<00:03:51.820> this<00:03:52.950> that<00:03:53.950> now<00:03:54.100> looks

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
splits open like this that now looks

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.910 
splits open like this that now looks
like<00:03:54.370> this<00:03:54.579> on<00:03:54.700> the<00:03:54.730> top<00:03:55.000> and<00:03:55.870> we<00:03:56.049> have<00:03:56.320> this

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920 
like this on the top and we have this

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.990 
like this on the top and we have this

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 
up so that it clicks into place and then

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.810 
up so that it clicks into place and then
just<00:04:51.229> pop<00:04:52.229> the<00:04:52.410> tab<00:04:52.590> back<00:04:52.830> over<00:04:53.160> which<00:04:53.610> will

a<00:05:06.120> you<00:05:06.900> can<00:05:07.050> see<00:05:07.260> here<00:05:08.210> when<00:05:09.210> I<00:05:09.240> click<00:05:09.840> the<00:05:09.990> tab

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:10.490 
a you can see here when I click the tab

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:15.830 
a you can see here when I click the tab
these<00:05:11.490> two<00:05:11.639> little<00:05:11.760> pieces<00:05:12.030> come<00:05:12.419> up<00:05:14.840> which

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 
these two little pieces come up which

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:17.420 
these two little pieces come up which
when<00:05:16.020> these<00:05:16.169> are<00:05:16.289> up<00:05:16.440> it<00:05:16.680> keeps<00:05:16.919> them<00:05:17.190> from

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:17.430 
when these are up it keeps them from

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:20.120 
when these are up it keeps them from
opening<00:05:18.199> so<00:05:19.199> that's<00:05:19.410> why<00:05:19.560> these<00:05:19.620> have<00:05:19.889> to<00:05:20.010> go

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:20.130 
opening so that's why these have to go

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:24.400 
opening so that's why these have to go
up<00:05:20.250> last<00:05:20.550> to<00:05:21.240> lock<00:05:22.199> into<00:05:22.500> place<00:05:22.800> because<00:05:23.370> see

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:24.410 
up last to lock into place because see

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:27.050 
up last to lock into place because see
there's<00:05:25.410> this<00:05:25.710> tab<00:05:26.010> and<00:05:26.370> that<00:05:26.580> goes<00:05:26.760> inside

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060 
there's this tab and that goes inside

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.170 
there's this tab and that goes inside
the<00:05:27.270> tail<00:05:27.570> so<00:05:28.380> it<00:05:28.410> all<00:05:28.710> everything<00:05:29.460> locks<00:05:29.910> in

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:30.180 
the tail so it all everything locks in

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:34.089 
the tail so it all everything locks in
and<00:05:30.360> it<00:05:30.419> stayed<00:05:30.690> nice<00:05:30.960> and<00:05:30.990> snug<00:05:31.740> and<00:05:32.070> secure

00:05:34.089 --> 00:05:34.099 
and it stayed nice and snug and secure

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:38.510 
and it stayed nice and snug and secure
when<00:05:35.099> it's<00:05:35.220> like<00:05:35.340> this<00:05:36.470> so<00:05:37.470> that's<00:05:38.340> it<00:05:38.490> for

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:38.520 
when it's like this so that's it for

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:46.659 
when it's like this so that's it for
this<00:05:38.729> guy<00:05:38.940> let's<00:05:39.210> take<00:05:39.419> this<00:05:41.300> metal<00:05:42.300> scanner

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:46.669 

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:49.250 

closed<00:05:47.669> driver<00:05:48.090> we<00:05:48.360> can<00:05:48.510> stick<00:05:48.750> it<00:05:48.870> in<00:05:48.960> here<00:05:49.169> if

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:49.260 
closed driver we can stick it in here if

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.189 
closed driver we can stick it in here if
we<00:05:49.410> want<00:05:49.650> we<00:05:49.949> don't<00:05:50.580> need<00:05:50.910> to<00:05:51.150> we<00:05:51.990> can<00:05:52.020> just

00:05:52.189 --> 00:05:52.199 
we want we don't need to we can just

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:54.020 
we want we don't need to we can just
scan<00:05:52.560> it<00:05:52.620> and<00:05:52.860> then<00:05:53.159> scan<00:05:53.460> the<00:05:53.610> chip<00:05:53.820> at<00:05:53.940> the

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:54.030 
scan it and then scan the chip at the

00:05:54.030 --> 00:06:09.609 
scan it and then scan the chip at the
end<00:05:54.150> here

00:06:09.609 --> 00:06:09.619 

00:06:09.619 --> 00:06:11.689 

since<00:06:10.619> we<00:06:10.710> only<00:06:10.770> scanned<00:06:11.159> one<00:06:11.339> they'll<00:06:11.490> just

00:06:11.689 --> 00:06:11.699 
since we only scanned one they'll just

00:06:11.699 --> 00:06:13.969 
since we only scanned one they'll just
have<00:06:11.759> one<00:06:12.059> light<00:06:12.270> instead<00:06:12.599> of<00:06:12.659> three<00:06:13.020> but<00:06:13.800> it
