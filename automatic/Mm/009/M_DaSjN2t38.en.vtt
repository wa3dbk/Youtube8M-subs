00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.260
 m 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.260
 after 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.640
 there's everybody it's great that they have 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.500
 other ideas today we get 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.250
 find for a new video so 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.830
 adapt a little 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.270
 since I'm doing g5 slows down a 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:51.000
 little on which the team and returns 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.620
 in force on some 6 4 modern warfare 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.530
 so today a new gameplay to 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.780
 propose to you so it'll be a little 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.059
 in domination of canes MP5 verma 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.500
 it's a lot of weapons to do especially 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.390
 that the mp5 you will see during 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.010
 sporty the connection was not too much 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.300
 with module it brings innovative you 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.450
 see I put balls but that 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:11.310
 do not learn too much so I did not pick up 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.660
 bad money on the floor and it's going very 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.600
 to finish well at the end of the game so 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:16.860
 stay until the end of the game 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.840
 so for this gameplay that I have to you 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.700
 propose today I'm going to address a 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.039
 subject to present it to the big hits 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:27.729
 in qg to the seven listed titles as I have 

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:31.149
 used to say it the subject I have 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:33.490
 addressed for this new video this is 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:36.340
 the arrival of the new service 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.390
 playstation that will be available from 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.909
 of 2015 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.740
 so this service is so it can 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:44.950
 already hot runway of water something 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:47.680
 now it's a boss of 500 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.840
 entry 10 years French but since 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:53.079
 that's what it means so this service 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.759
 will actually constitute to take back to ea 

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:56.320
 we propose is actually young people and 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:58.149
 pretty dematerialize the game 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.909
 dematerialized that is to say already knows 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:03.970
 we download directly we pay by

 credit card or by psn cards when 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.390
 you have some habit of doing 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.580
 talk because xbox on the points and 10 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.110
 of auonne so that's exactly the 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.519
 same thing so you pay them you are 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.920
 just to download them so that's it 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:17.350
 dematerialized games and from 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.210
 early 2015 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.160
 stephen will pool to be in 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:23.830
 service playstation we who will 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.350
 consist in then proposing the 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.290
 old games 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:32.040
 but I have the famous playstation game 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.810
 playstation 2 and playstation 3 so that 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.970
 will do a lot of back to basics 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.260
 a lot of 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.030
 memories in some of you 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:43.230
 who played the playstation and 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:46.320
 playstation 2 so for me what this 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.940
 I would love it we see reassured 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.670
 six reviews it is well introduced the return 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.890
 of the elders therefore leads the Africans 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.010
 to use schools which included in 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.540
 does an icon and when how 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.450
 and all politicians know 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:02.750
 on old hinders so ps2 for 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:04.760
 back on girlfriend 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:07.430
 and from four mistral because of 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.440
 of them so all that is on ps3 so 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.330
 everyone knows and from 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.670
 2015 so some beatty schools I 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:16.610
 do not think he can hand over all 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:18.200
 call of duty in place and he will hand the 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:20.810
 sale that it costs quite a bit of 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.250
 is to not put back into service the 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.070
 remedies offered for sale 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.000
 they will see offer to download 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:27.320
 your listening pretty expensive so that 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.370
 surprise me that there are all 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:32.990
 duty people have proposed for sale but 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:36.020
 I think they will choose they will 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:37.760
 do or do a little vision in 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:39.430
 general because activation 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.590
 who confuses activision and treyarch 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.300
 activision blizzard 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:47.260
 big box that has right 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:49.500
 activision-blizzard makes your debut at 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:53.830
 right very treyarch and left 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:56.739
 infinity ward so I think they're going 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:58.239
 a survey to choose them 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:02.709
 in fact what are the codes of ethics 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:04.860
 we will see you again on this service doxi 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:07.989
 only you will have the choice between 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:09.549
 two or three policies will be what 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:10.980
 will be the votes of opti do not hesitate to 

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:14.860
 tell me in the comments 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:18.010
 to enter the code return 4 well 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:20.350
 obviously especially I think they 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:21.760
 game that would make furious about loing this 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:24.850
 would really be the return of modern 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:27.070
 warfare 2 or black ops 1 that's what 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:29.290
 is really about doing not hurt 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:31.750
 damage if there is that which comes back 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:33.820
 on on playstation 4 from 2015 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.350
 so it would really make 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:35.900
 to do very badly 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:37.699
 messi 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:40.340
 I think this is what notice please 

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:42.590
 no coke bias is your opinion to 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:45.320
 you if we should choose 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:48.110
 however, no choice but to have a 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:50.800
 only case tools they would come back ben 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:53.949
 me personally it would be open to 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:56.240
 high it would be black ops so will 

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:58.210
 after the return of any 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:01.360
 shop at the tiber 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:03.160
 actually more fun than the ghost that 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:06.160
 we currently know who did not 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:07.169
 sadly disappointed unfortunately as at 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.400
 sales level 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:10.729
 some of you let them 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.860
 had come for a rendering 

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:15.400
 the isolated act about a billion of 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:17.020
 sales after one week of 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:19.030
 the exit of the game and this is the first 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:20.820
 year when as a tool is in the process of 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:22.630
 go back down in sales 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:24.960
 so we will see in the layers and 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:27.360
 milk are starting to wonder and 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.940
 and to see if they will succeed we 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:31.380
 propose type school for the next gen 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:34.229
 but a former communist on the next 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:36.120
 gen so as you see I'm 

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:37.470
 already in series of quests and with 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:41.460
 butter it's already starting to be a little 

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:44.550
 tense so sent on the gameplay so 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:46.650
 for the playstation whose elders 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:48.460
 play games than to be proposed these are 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:53.479
 Games 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:57.580
 from the firm sony saw that sony not bad 

00:05:53.479 --> 00:06:00.070
 of exclusive com 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:02.160
 I want if I 

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:03.160
 one of the six 

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:06.340
 purist me 

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:08.110
 will fall on me other charters 

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:10.330
 ide who are really not bad the 

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:12.850
 trilogy may return to the sale its 

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:15.160
 will not extend to me at all after all 

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:16.240
 is rydell fantasy on playstation 2 

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:18.370
 two years ago I know there is not bad 

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:21.910
 of us who love this kind of 

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:25.540
 game after of course the old clubs 

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:28.780
 of ciqi that was just inescapable 

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:30.700
 on playstation 2 with robert bareille 

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:33.070
 maybe medal of honor also a 

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:34.740
 excellent fps who at the time was at 

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:37.180
 above of call of duty 

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:38.650
 names I do not even remember the 

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:40.330
 everything but it was really above 

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:44.590
 15 missions were talking about that at the time 

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:46.420
 sure it would be on ps1 psp ps2 that 

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:49.270
 really made mini moke board 

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:50.350
 monumental from codes 4 la 

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:54.100
 trend reversed like you 

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:56.080
 then know the other games that who 

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:59.409
 risk of arriving I think there will be 

00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:01.669
 other firms other 

00:06:59.409 --> 00:07:04.099
 exclusive to this guide you see I am 

00:07:01.669 --> 00:07:07.610
 arrived with yves in a row I'm funny 

00:07:04.099 --> 00:07:08.870
 is that 195 points of which 6.562 stupidly 

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:10.289
 and that they risk rather simple a 

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:12.979
 return of li na 6 

00:07:10.289 --> 00:07:16.289
 as soon as I reboot one day and 

00:07:12.979 --> 00:07:18.119
 daniel jeandupeux third 

00:07:16.289 --> 00:07:19.949
 one hundred and ninety teams I arrive 

00:07:18.119 --> 00:07:21.869
 24th what will I succeed in 

00:07:19.949 --> 00:07:24.149
 do the series of 25 and one year it's 

00:07:21.869 --> 00:07:27.899
 ends with a frontside to the board 

00:07:24.149 --> 00:07:28.949
 become cap that alarm with some 

00:07:27.899 --> 00:07:30.869
 clips so that would have been almost 

00:07:28.949 --> 00:07:33.089
 nuclear alain monard by sureties 

00:07:30.869 --> 00:07:34.439
 four bunkers unfortunately the game has 

00:07:33.089 --> 00:07:38.099
 been faster than me and it's over 

00:07:34.439 --> 00:07:39.689
 rather planned so hoping that this 

00:07:38.099 --> 00:07:41.279
 gameplay you would have more and the subject 

00:07:39.689 --> 00:07:42.749
 that I approached you liked so do not hesitate 

00:07:41.279 --> 00:07:45.289
 not to subscribe and we 'll say 

00:07:42.749 --> 00:07:45.289
 next tome
