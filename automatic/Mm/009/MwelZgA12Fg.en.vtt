00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:22.750
 those games these here are just one 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:25.060
 small shows the amplitude of magic 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:26.020
 from that time of that time form 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.350
 gigas 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:33.910
 I want to teach the many games 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:36.700
 so that I played because I already played 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.120
 all the games and this is a small 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.219
 sample of 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.789
 that magic I'm grateful I'm 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:42.789

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:52.809
 very good gentlemen today I am going to open my 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:56.500
 heart because to talk about sonny that is 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:58.980
 talk about the memories of a child those 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:02.680
 whole afternoons daydreaming 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:05.770
 playing the blue spell game so much 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.780
 vivacity in my hands so good control 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:11.200
 of a game like this from the master 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:14.009
 system my dearest 10-bit console 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:17.020
 that competed face to face with the game boy 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:19.990
 I remember how they had just thrown him there 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:23.500
 for the year 93 when I just had 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:26.619
 three years to take it with my brothers and 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.660
 filming it in colors we did not know if 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:31.869
 it would work because it was second-rate 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:34.390
 hand and the cde was a little scratched but 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:37.119
 when we saw the sega hero running 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:40.660
 for those wonderful worlds we were 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:43.840
 all afternoon playing sometimes changed and 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:47.140
 I took his partner always faithful as 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.250
 good dog that is that he could fly when 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.430
 I lived yes 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:54.190
 for the first time felipe in color is that 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:57.250
 dog with its innumerable tails by 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:59.880
 those worlds but always my favorite 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:04.030
 it will be the creation of miyamoto's genius 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:07.150
 sonic song and that represents my childhood the 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:10.179
 happiness of a child who played and played 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:12.520
 that game and he never tired me 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:15.850
 I will have spent that game a hundred times 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.740
 and today I feel the chills of 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:21.250
 unforgettable memories that come to me 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:24.010
 namely learned mind spending money 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.900
 collecting coins with sonic for later 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:29.230
 spend them in the store within the game 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:32.620
 to buy me special items thanks 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:35.040
 sonic thank you yes thank you 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:39.610
 I grew up with a little magic in my heart 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:42.640
 fly jump roll but you made me 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:46.180
 and dream and not want to play more games 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:48.630
 for a long time I learned until 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:52.390
 the last corner of that singular world 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:54.730
 there were no secrets for me so many hours 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.480
 in front of the screen they did that already 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.349
 the game 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:01.480
 I know through my veins I have something of 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:05.200
 supersonic thanks to him we all 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:07.569
 we did supersonic though of saying that 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.239
 I hated the evil doctor Robotnik 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:12.810
 always robbed the princess and her 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:15.430
 Emeralds at the most inopportune moment 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:18.280
 the worst thing is that after the end to 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:21.610
 beat him was always in another castle 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:24.430
 the princess but I'm going to tell you 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:28.239
 you who do not know all truth 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:31.860
 we have gone through the same thing until then 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:35.230
 friends, I say goodbye with my master system 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:41.049
 my sonic and this indelible memory of 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:44.920
 childhood of innocence and fun of the 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:49.030
 videogames in short these are one of the 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:51.950
 best memories of my childhood 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:54.879
 and one last thing 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.879
 I'm manco
