00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:36.270 
but for a beta ROM this ROM works very
well<00:03:34.480> and<00:03:34.900> it<00:03:35.170> is<00:03:35.200> very<00:03:35.320> smooth<00:03:35.769> for<00:03:36.010> the<00:03:36.040> most

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
well and it is very smooth for the most

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.090 
well and it is very smooth for the most
part<00:03:36.640> yes<00:03:37.570> the<00:03:37.810> frame<00:03:38.079> rates<00:03:38.320> do<00:03:38.620> drop<00:03:38.890> at

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
part yes the frame rates do drop at

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:40.949 
part yes the frame rates do drop at
times<00:03:39.400> and<00:03:39.700> the<00:03:39.820> phone<00:03:40.060> isn't<00:03:40.480> very<00:03:40.690> snappy

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:40.959 
times and the phone isn't very snappy

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:43.860 
times and the phone isn't very snappy
but<00:03:41.829> considering<00:03:42.400> this<00:03:42.609> is<00:03:42.820> a<00:03:42.880> fire<00:03:43.209> old<00:03:43.570> phone

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
but considering this is a fire old phone

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.530 
but considering this is a fire old phone
and<00:03:44.079> the<00:03:44.380> experimental<00:03:45.040> stage<00:03:45.310> of<00:03:45.549> the<00:03:45.670> ROM<00:03:45.850> it

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
and the experimental stage of the ROM it

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.110 
and the experimental stage of the ROM it
is<00:03:46.720> quite<00:03:46.959> stable<00:03:47.230> to<00:03:47.560> use<00:03:47.739> maybe<00:03:48.400> even<00:03:48.880> as<00:03:49.090> a

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
is quite stable to use maybe even as a

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.890 
is quite stable to use maybe even as a
daily<00:03:49.390> driver

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
daily driver

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.559 
daily driver
