the thing about barefoot running it's
good<00:00:37.860> in<00:00:38.010> theory<00:00:38.430> because<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.570> foot<00:00:39.870> should

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
good in theory because the foot should

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.650 
good in theory because the foot should
normally<00:00:41.070> be<00:00:41.100> kind<00:00:41.520> of<00:00:41.610> arched<00:00:42.149> in<00:00:42.329> shape

we've got all these little bones that
are<00:00:45.570> designed<00:00:45.930> to<00:00:46.079> be<00:00:46.289> in<00:00:46.440> an<00:00:46.559> arch<00:00:46.829> shape<00:00:47.430> and

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:47.840 
are designed to be in an arch shape and

when<00:00:48.840> you<00:00:49.020> run<00:00:49.350> barefoot<00:00:49.980> technically<00:00:50.579> you're

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
when you run barefoot technically you're

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.549 
when you run barefoot technically you're
strengthening<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.629> muscles<00:00:52.050> that<00:00:52.199> hold

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559
