and that's really the only difference
between<00:02:20.660> the<00:02:21.020> Quran<00:02:21.380> and<00:02:23.230> and<00:02:24.230> the<00:02:25.070> Bible<00:02:25.459> cuz

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
between the Quran and and the Bible cuz

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:26.979 
between the Quran and and the Bible cuz
both<00:02:25.790> make<00:02:26.030> me<00:02:26.180> hard<00:02:26.420> but<00:02:26.600> the<00:02:26.690> thing<00:02:26.840> about

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:26.989 
both make me hard but the thing about

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:31.570 
both make me hard but the thing about
the<00:02:27.110> Quran<00:02:27.410> is<00:02:29.140> it<00:02:30.140> borrowed<00:02:30.860> so<00:02:31.160> much<00:02:31.190> from

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
the Quran is it borrowed so much from

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.130 
the Quran is it borrowed so much from
the<00:02:31.670> Bible<00:02:32.060> but<00:02:32.150> no<00:02:32.300> the<00:02:32.420> Bible<00:02:32.780> was<00:02:32.930> there

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140
