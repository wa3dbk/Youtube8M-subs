hello<00:00:01.860> everyone<00:00:02.250> this<00:00:02.280> is<00:00:02.490> Stan<00:00:02.850> from<00:00:03.120> tidal

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:03.360 
hello everyone this is Stan from tidal

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.690 
hello everyone this is Stan from tidal
Gardens<00:00:03.629> and<00:00:04.110> in<00:00:04.650> this<00:00:04.770> video<00:00:05.009> I<00:00:05.370> will<00:00:05.490> be

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
Gardens and in this video I will be

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.519 
Gardens and in this video I will be
demonstrating<00:00:05.850> two<00:00:06.480> methods<00:00:06.899> that<00:00:07.020> we<00:00:07.350> use<00:00:07.500> to

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
demonstrating two methods that we use to

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.180 
demonstrating two methods that we use to
propagate<00:00:08.189> mushroom<00:00:08.670> coral<00:00:08.880> morphs<00:00:10.190> the

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
propagate mushroom coral morphs the

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.370 
propagate mushroom coral morphs the
first<00:00:11.460> method<00:00:11.880> I<00:00:11.969> will<00:00:12.030> show<00:00:12.389> is<00:00:12.780> our<00:00:12.929> favorite

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
first method I will show is our favorite

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.900 
first method I will show is our favorite
because<00:00:13.559> it<00:00:13.830> addresses<00:00:14.040> the<00:00:14.309> problem<00:00:14.759> of

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
because it addresses the problem of

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.990 
because it addresses the problem of
attaching<00:00:15.269> mushrooms<00:00:15.929> once<00:00:16.230> they're<00:00:16.440> cut

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:17.000 
attaching mushrooms once they're cut

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.450 
attaching mushrooms once they're cut
mushrooms<00:00:18.000> heal<00:00:18.449> really<00:00:18.690> well<00:00:18.810> from<00:00:19.289> cuts<00:00:19.560> but

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
mushrooms heal really well from cuts but

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.340 
mushrooms heal really well from cuts but
don't<00:00:21.000> do<00:00:21.180> so<00:00:21.420> if<00:00:21.570> they're<00:00:21.720> floating<00:00:21.930> on<00:00:22.199> the

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
don't do so if they're floating on the

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:28.310 
don't do so if they're floating on the
tank<00:00:26.210> notice<00:00:27.210> I<00:00:27.359> picked<00:00:27.570> out<00:00:27.689> a<00:00:27.720> mushroom<00:00:28.170> that

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
tank notice I picked out a mushroom that

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.980 
tank notice I picked out a mushroom that
was<00:00:28.439> attached<00:00:28.769> to<00:00:28.920> a<00:00:28.980> small<00:00:29.130> piece<00:00:29.429> of<00:00:29.460> rubble

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:29.990 
was attached to a small piece of rubble

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:32.269 
was attached to a small piece of rubble
when<00:00:30.990> I<00:00:31.019> make<00:00:31.230> my<00:00:31.380> cut<00:00:31.619> I<00:00:31.859> want<00:00:32.009> to<00:00:32.160> be<00:00:32.250> sure

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
when I make my cut I want to be sure

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.160 
when I make my cut I want to be sure
that<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.820> two<00:00:33.000> cuttings<00:00:33.420> are<00:00:33.570> still<00:00:33.840> attached

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
that the two cuttings are still attached

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.280 
that the two cuttings are still attached
to<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.440> rock

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:36.290 
to the rock

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:38.330 
to the rock
although<00:00:37.290> mushrooms<00:00:37.829> will<00:00:37.980> heal<00:00:38.190> through

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
although mushrooms will heal through

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.369 
although mushrooms will heal through
almost<00:00:38.489> anything<00:00:38.969> it's<00:00:39.690> good<00:00:39.930> practice<00:00:40.110> to

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
almost anything it's good practice to

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:41.840 
almost anything it's good practice to
cut<00:00:40.620> through<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:40.860> mouth<00:00:41.070> of<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.370> polyp<00:00:41.700> in

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
cut through the mouth of the polyp in

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.729 
cut through the mouth of the polyp in
the<00:00:41.940> center<00:00:42.239> that<00:00:43.140> speeds<00:00:43.469> up<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.710> healing

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
the center that speeds up the healing

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.330 
the center that speeds up the healing
process

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:49.340 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.250 

now<00:00:49.910> that<00:00:50.060> the<00:00:50.180> flesh<00:00:50.450> of<00:00:50.570> the<00:00:50.690> polyp<00:00:50.990> has<00:00:51.110> been

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
now that the flesh of the polyp has been

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.170 
now that the flesh of the polyp has been
cut<00:00:51.500> I'm<00:00:52.040> going<00:00:52.340> to<00:00:52.400> use<00:00:52.490> a<00:00:52.520> bone<00:00:52.760> cutter<00:00:53.030> to

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:53.180 
cut I'm going to use a bone cutter to

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.750 
cut I'm going to use a bone cutter to
cut<00:00:53.330> the<00:00:53.480> rock<00:00:53.690> in<00:00:53.930> half<00:00:54.250> the<00:00:55.250> reason<00:00:55.520> I<00:00:55.580> want

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
cut the rock in half the reason I want

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.310 
cut the rock in half the reason I want
to<00:00:55.820> cut<00:00:56.000> the<00:00:56.090> rock<00:00:56.270> is<00:00:56.540> so<00:00:56.900> that<00:00:57.080> I<00:00:57.110> can

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320 
to cut the rock is so that I can

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.510 
to cut the rock is so that I can
separate<00:00:57.710> the<00:00:57.860> two<00:00:57.890> cuttings

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:58.520 
separate the two cuttings

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.970 
separate the two cuttings
if<00:00:58.880> you<00:00:59.390> don't<00:00:59.660> separate<00:01:00.140> them<00:01:00.350> sometimes<00:01:00.860> the

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:00.980 
if you don't separate them sometimes the

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:02.920 
if you don't separate them sometimes the
two<00:01:01.130> parts<00:01:01.520> will<00:01:01.640> fuse<00:01:01.880> back<00:01:02.090> together<00:01:02.300> which

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:02.930 
two parts will fuse back together which

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:04.960 
two parts will fuse back together which
kind<00:01:03.530> of<00:01:03.680> defeats<00:01:03.830> the<00:01:04.130> purpose<00:01:04.220> of<00:01:04.670> cutting

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
kind of defeats the purpose of cutting

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.200 
kind of defeats the purpose of cutting
them<00:01:05.059> in<00:01:05.180> the<00:01:05.239> first<00:01:05.390> place<00:01:06.760> these<00:01:07.760> mushroom

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
them in the first place these mushroom

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:09.880 
them in the first place these mushroom
frags<00:01:08.510> are<00:01:08.660> not<00:01:08.810> ready<00:01:09.050> to<00:01:09.110> go<00:01:09.290> back<00:01:09.500> into<00:01:09.710> the

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
frags are not ready to go back into the

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.520 
frags are not ready to go back into the
tank<00:01:10.210> just<00:01:11.210> to<00:01:11.330> clarify<00:01:11.570> I'm<00:01:12.140> showing

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
tank just to clarify I'm showing

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:13.870 
tank just to clarify I'm showing
techniques<00:01:13.010> here<00:01:13.280> to<00:01:13.370> speed<00:01:13.640> up<00:01:13.760> the

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 
techniques here to speed up the

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.600 
techniques here to speed up the
propagation<00:01:14.450> of<00:01:14.690> mushrooms<00:01:15.490> mushrooms<00:01:16.490> will

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
propagation of mushrooms mushrooms will

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.130 
propagation of mushrooms mushrooms will
divide<00:01:16.880> on<00:01:17.030> their<00:01:17.150> own<00:01:17.360> through<00:01:17.660> a<00:01:17.690> process

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
divide on their own through a process

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.590 
divide on their own through a process
called<00:01:18.170> pita<00:01:18.650> laceration<00:01:19.430> where<00:01:20.120> they<00:01:20.270> slowly

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
called pita laceration where they slowly

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.630 
called pita laceration where they slowly
scoot<00:01:21.080> around<00:01:21.200> the<00:01:21.410> tank<00:01:21.619> and<00:01:21.830> leave<00:01:22.250> behind

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
scoot around the tank and leave behind

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.300 
scoot around the tank and leave behind
small<00:01:23.000> pieces<00:01:23.420> of<00:01:23.540> their<00:01:23.660> foot<00:01:23.979> these<00:01:24.979> pieces

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
small pieces of their foot these pieces

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.630 
small pieces of their foot these pieces
will<00:01:25.790> grow<00:01:26.060> into<00:01:26.210> full-sized<00:01:26.660> mushrooms<00:01:27.229> and

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 
will grow into full-sized mushrooms and

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.370 
will grow into full-sized mushrooms and
if<00:01:28.640> you're<00:01:28.790> patient<00:01:29.000> mushrooms<00:01:29.930> will<00:01:30.140> pretty

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
if you're patient mushrooms will pretty

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.230 
if you're patient mushrooms will pretty
much<00:01:30.619> fill<00:01:30.950> a<00:01:31.160> good<00:01:31.400> amount<00:01:31.670> of<00:01:31.729> tank<00:01:32.000> space

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
much fill a good amount of tank space

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.040 
much fill a good amount of tank space
all<00:01:32.570> on<00:01:32.720> their<00:01:32.869> own

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:33.050 
all on their own

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:36.730 
all on their own
I<00:01:34.180> promise<00:01:35.180> two<00:01:35.360> techniques<00:01:35.810> so<00:01:36.320> here<00:01:36.590> is<00:01:36.710> a

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
I promise two techniques so here is a

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.469 
I promise two techniques so here is a
method<00:01:37.010> where<00:01:37.369> you<00:01:37.520> do<00:01:37.640> not<00:01:37.790> have<00:01:37.970> the<00:01:38.060> benefit

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
method where you do not have the benefit

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:40.180 
method where you do not have the benefit
of<00:01:38.510> the<00:01:38.720> mushroom<00:01:39.050> cuttings<00:01:39.470> being<00:01:39.830> attached

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:40.190 
of the mushroom cuttings being attached

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.990 
of the mushroom cuttings being attached
to<00:01:40.369> rubble<00:01:40.850> already<00:01:41.530> I'm<00:01:43.000> intentionally

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
to rubble already I'm intentionally

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.880 
to rubble already I'm intentionally
cutting<00:01:44.660> this<00:01:44.780> mushroom<00:01:45.229> through<00:01:45.530> its<00:01:45.650> mouth

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
cutting this mushroom through its mouth

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.980 
cutting this mushroom through its mouth
the<00:01:46.100> same<00:01:46.280> as<00:01:46.430> last<00:01:46.610> time<00:01:46.759> but<00:01:47.210> as<00:01:47.720> you<00:01:47.840> can<00:01:47.930> see

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
the same as last time but as you can see

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.170 
the same as last time but as you can see
it's<00:01:48.530> a<00:01:48.619> loose<00:01:48.830> frag

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
it's a loose frag

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.720 
it's a loose frag
the<00:01:50.780> nice<00:01:50.990> thing<00:01:51.230> about<00:01:51.290> this<00:01:51.560> method<00:01:51.770> is<00:01:52.250> that

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:52.730 
the nice thing about this method is that

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:55.390 
the nice thing about this method is that
you<00:01:52.790> can<00:01:52.940> cut<00:01:53.180> a<00:01:53.210> single<00:01:53.630> mushroom<00:01:54.200> into<00:01:54.620> four

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:55.400 
you can cut a single mushroom into four

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.100 
you can cut a single mushroom into four
or<00:01:55.430> eight<00:01:55.940> pieces<00:01:56.210> if<00:01:56.630> you're<00:01:56.750> not<00:01:56.870> really

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110 
or eight pieces if you're not really

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.200 
or eight pieces if you're not really
worried<00:01:57.470> about<00:01:57.560> every<00:01:58.370> single<00:01:58.700> piece<00:01:58.880> being

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
worried about every single piece being

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.500 
worried about every single piece being
stuck<00:01:59.570> to<00:01:59.750> a<00:01:59.780> piece<00:01:59.930> of<00:02:00.050> rubble<00:02:01.330> as<00:02:02.330> I

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:02.510 
stuck to a piece of rubble as I

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:04.720 
stuck to a piece of rubble as I
mentioned<00:02:02.900> earlier<00:02:03.290> mushrooms<00:02:04.010> heal<00:02:04.340> really

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:04.730 
mentioned earlier mushrooms heal really

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:07.360 
mentioned earlier mushrooms heal really
well<00:02:04.910> from<00:02:05.030> being<00:02:05.240> cut<00:02:05.600> the<00:02:06.500> problem<00:02:06.920> is<00:02:07.130> they

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:07.370 
well from being cut the problem is they

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:08.740 
well from being cut the problem is they
blow<00:02:07.700> around<00:02:08.000> the<00:02:08.119> tank<00:02:08.360> if<00:02:08.509> they're<00:02:08.630> not

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
blow around the tank if they're not

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.220 
blow around the tank if they're not
attached<00:02:09.170> to<00:02:09.380> anything<00:02:10.000> what<00:02:11.000> I<00:02:11.030> do<00:02:11.180> is<00:02:11.600> to

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
attached to anything what I do is to

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.380 
attached to anything what I do is to
place<00:02:12.470> them<00:02:12.710> in<00:02:12.770> a<00:02:12.950> special<00:02:13.160> tank<00:02:13.580> with<00:02:14.090> very

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
place them in a special tank with very

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.230 
place them in a special tank with very
low<00:02:14.600> flow<00:02:14.930> and<00:02:15.260> a<00:02:15.590> Rubble<00:02:15.980> substrate<00:02:16.550> to<00:02:17.060> make

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.240 
low flow and a Rubble substrate to make

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.030 
low flow and a Rubble substrate to make
it<00:02:17.390> as<00:02:17.540> easy<00:02:18.050> as<00:02:18.170> possible<00:02:18.290> for<00:02:18.860> them<00:02:19.010> to

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
it as easy as possible for them to

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.780 
it as easy as possible for them to
attach<00:02:20.170> what<00:02:21.170> some<00:02:21.380> people<00:02:21.500> do<00:02:21.830> is<00:02:22.010> put<00:02:22.610> some

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
attach what some people do is put some

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.220 
attach what some people do is put some
rubble<00:02:23.150> into<00:02:23.300> a<00:02:23.360> plastic<00:02:23.540> container<00:02:23.810> and

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
rubble into a plastic container and

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.080 
rubble into a plastic container and
cover<00:02:24.650> it<00:02:24.860> with<00:02:24.920> a<00:02:25.040> mesh<00:02:25.340> material<00:02:25.370> like

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
cover it with a mesh material like

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.540 
cover it with a mesh material like
wedding<00:02:26.510> veil<00:02:26.660> for<00:02:26.870> example<00:02:27.320> this<00:02:28.130> technique

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
wedding veil for example this technique

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.430 
wedding veil for example this technique
is<00:02:28.730> good<00:02:29.030> for<00:02:29.300> preventing<00:02:29.840> loose<00:02:30.020> cuttings

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
is good for preventing loose cuttings

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.230 
is good for preventing loose cuttings
from<00:02:30.680> floating<00:02:30.950> on<00:02:31.130> the<00:02:31.280> tank<00:02:31.580> but<00:02:32.030> I

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:32.240 
from floating on the tank but I

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.550 
from floating on the tank but I
personally<00:02:32.600> do<00:02:32.810> not<00:02:32.840> like<00:02:32.959> to<00:02:33.170> do<00:02:33.350> this

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
personally do not like to do this

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.460 
personally do not like to do this
because<00:02:33.910> it<00:02:34.910> can<00:02:35.209> take<00:02:35.510> up<00:02:35.720> to<00:02:35.750> two<00:02:36.050> weeks<00:02:36.350> for

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
because it can take up to two weeks for

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.380 
because it can take up to two weeks for
loose<00:02:36.800> mushrooms<00:02:37.250> to<00:02:37.370> attach<00:02:37.670> to<00:02:37.910> substrate

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
loose mushrooms to attach to substrate

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.540 
loose mushrooms to attach to substrate
and<00:02:38.600> in<00:02:39.200> that<00:02:39.350> time<00:02:39.560> a<00:02:39.590> great<00:02:39.890> deal<00:02:40.100> of<00:02:40.220> algae

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
and in that time a great deal of algae

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.480 
and in that time a great deal of algae
can<00:02:40.790> grow<00:02:41.209> on<00:02:41.390> that<00:02:41.420> mesh<00:02:41.810> screen<00:02:42.230> that<00:02:43.130> algae

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:43.490 
can grow on that mesh screen that algae

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:45.870 
can grow on that mesh screen that algae
does<00:02:43.670> suffocate<00:02:44.209> your<00:02:44.300> mushroom<00:02:44.630> frags

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
does suffocate your mushroom frags

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.860 
does suffocate your mushroom frags
alright<00:02:46.880> that<00:02:47.090> does<00:02:47.120> it<00:02:47.390> for<00:02:47.420> mushroom

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
alright that does it for mushroom

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.520 
alright that does it for mushroom
propagation<00:02:48.500> thanks<00:02:48.860> again<00:02:48.980> for<00:02:49.130> watching
