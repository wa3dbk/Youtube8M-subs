00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
duplicated this because the device is

on<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.390> device<00:01:42.689> you<00:01:42.899> can<00:01:42.960> try<00:01:43.350> to<00:01:43.409> mesh<00:01:43.740> them

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
on the device you can try to mesh them

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:44.389 
on the device you can try to mesh them
together

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
together

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.510 
together
for<00:01:45.360> example<00:01:45.750> this<00:01:45.840> two<00:01:46.049> here<00:01:46.320> so<00:01:47.040> what<00:01:47.250> we<00:01:47.369> do

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
for example this two here so what we do

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.730 
for example this two here so what we do
is<00:01:47.700> we<00:01:47.850> tap<00:01:48.030> on<00:01:48.149> more<00:01:48.390> then<00:01:49.110> tap<00:01:49.380> and<00:01:49.530> merge

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
is we tap on more then tap and merge

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.460 
is we tap on more then tap and merge
contacts<00:01:50.310> and<00:01:50.520> you<00:01:51.270> can<00:01:51.420> see<00:01:51.600> here<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.259> phone

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
contacts and you can see here the phone

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.859 
contacts and you can see here the phone
detects<00:01:52.829> there<00:01:53.100> are<00:01:53.220> some<00:01:53.399> to<00:01:53.640> placate<00:01:53.820> so<00:01:54.750> we

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
detects there are some to placate so we

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.780 
detects there are some to placate so we
can<00:01:55.049> choose<00:01:55.290> this<00:01:55.439> one<00:01:55.649> here<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:56.100> we<00:01:56.310> can<00:01:56.549> tap

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
can choose this one here and we can tap

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.170 
can choose this one here and we can tap
on<00:01:56.939> much<00:01:57.240> and<00:01:58.110> it<00:01:58.950> has<00:01:59.130> much<00:01:59.369> into<00:01:59.670> one<00:01:59.850> as<00:02:00.060> you
