00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
or something like that and I thought

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.960 
or something like that and I thought
this<00:02:07.140> would<00:02:07.200> be<00:02:07.530> an<00:02:08.069> appropriate<00:02:08.250> kind<00:02:08.879> of

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
this would be an appropriate kind of

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.270 
this would be an appropriate kind of
video<00:02:09.149> for<00:02:09.390> you<00:02:09.450> guys<00:02:09.479> it<00:02:09.840> also<00:02:10.259> to<00:02:10.319> check<00:02:11.099> out

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.330 
content I think that also satisfies not
just<00:03:18.390> myself<00:03:18.540> but<00:03:18.840> other<00:03:19.109> people<00:03:19.440> that<00:03:19.590> that

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340
