00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:19.369
 hi all this fps goal today we 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:21.470
 is found for a small tutorial I 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:22.970
 will show how to have the three 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:26.420
 characters of gta 5 that is to say 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:28.130
 franklin michael is very strong in at 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.900
 same place so yes even put them 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.340
 in the same room 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:35.000
 you'll see that for that it's going to be 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:37.489
 pretty easy so first of all actually 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.280
 you will take I advise you to 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:43.220
 start taking part finally take 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:46.280
 trevor anyway you'll go to the 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.750
 franklin house so she will be 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.239
 unblockable in the show for those who 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.909
 do not have to be right here so 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:55.729
 it's normal that who has nothing that makes 

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:58.370
 since it's not his house here at trevor 

00:00:55.729 --> 00:01:01.629
 it's franklin's house so it's 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:05.560
 for that it does not show up next 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:09.170
 blocked what he does she raises you 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:13.369
 then I feel you here 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:14.770
 pool and you will go back by the 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:20.750
 glass door 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:23.450
 then what are you going to do what they 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.369
 would then you went up in the 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.750
 House 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:29.030
 take the stairs and you go in 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:34.159
 done puts you as far as possible 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:38.570
 story that that trevor does not happen 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:43.219
 in fact out of the room you put 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:46.249
 for example here here you are fooled by a 

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:47.780
 bailiff is referred to like that so he 

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:49.850
 will have to go a long way 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.020
 go out and you'll have enough time to 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.130
 go get the other characters 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.640
 so that they will be able to 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.590
 meet 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.319
 so here now I'm doing down arrow 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.539
 I am going to choose 

00:01:56.319 --> 00:02:00.859
 michael and we'll do exactly the 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:05.899
 same thing so what are we going to do 

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:07.789
 by the way we will take michael and we will 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:11.510
 go directly to the master at home 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:14.750
 from franklin where I had a small landmark 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:18.100
 which ended the yperite so the house 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.100
 style right here 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.950
 here I want to speed up video and then we 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.950
 finds himself live after 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.390
 here we arrived at the house of 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:39.070
 franklin so we'll go the way we 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.070
 takes here to down the steps 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:45.020
 Then you go down arrow 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:47.480
 as soon as you see very hard and you 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.680
 go take franklin advise you to 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.960
 do not get too close to what 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.730
 I did the test just before and I 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.630
 be prefect too close to Trier tear off 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.000
 they did not want to change 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:58.400
 character of the coup I do not know if 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.200
 it was a bug or if it was 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.400
 normal that it was done on purpose but I 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.420
 could not change a character 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.420
 do not advise you to approach 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:09.530
 too close to very good so after soon 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:13.270
 that you have franklin we go again 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.270
 we will go to his house 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:19.989
 for the little piece that's there I'm going 

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:23.060
 pass a landmark directly story of 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:24.829
 8000 euros per grid of new games 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:32.989
 will further accelerate the video and we will 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:37.519
 find right after we are here 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:38.439
 with franklin and we're going down 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:41.030
 directly 

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:43.150
 we can already see trevor that is always 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.150
 the 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.489
 help 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:04:01.010
 we're going to go upstairs to go 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:03.220
 meet the poles this to the Russians who 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.220
 are 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.780
 very strong and there 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:17.270
 but franck where is he michael ritchie 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:33.740
 so here in fact I'm hungry I see you 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.930
 not felt 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:38.140
 i do not find michael but he was everything 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:40.400
 simply in the garden or who was 

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:43.540
 little wine was gone went into 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:47.450
 look so here I'm going to find 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:50.420
 we have a Frank Lin following us 

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:53.420
 normally what is it right there and we 

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:55.900
 is very strong that just tries on 

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:59.570
 video we will go get it 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:00.860
 here is very strong escaped too so 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:02.830
 that's my fault because I years 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:05.560
 have zapped friends inside the house 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:08.620
 and here I have managed to 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:12.350
 find a curiosity right in the 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:15.320
 tank there right next so 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:17.300
 it was not really far and can 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:19.910
 noticed that there was a big bug in 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:21.650
 as much as franklin has been 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:25.370
 duplicated here we have twice 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:27.410
 franklin sits down so I'm trying 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:30.140
 laugh to find out how I did to 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:32.060
 duplicate duplicate franklin anyway 

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:35.630
 it's pretty funny to have two 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:37.310
 franklin for the price of one so in all 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:40.280
 case here on this video it was good 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:42.380
 to show you how to bring together 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:44.090
 three characters anyway I hope 

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:46.250
 do you like this video what we 

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:47.990
 do not forget to shoot just 

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:52.480
 underneath the video and do next 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:52.480
 for a next video is Breton 

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:08.210
 chenault 

00:06:22.169 --> 00:06:24.169
