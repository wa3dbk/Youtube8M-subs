00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.330 
and I was practicing kind of

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.950 
and I was practicing kind of
embarrassing<00:01:32.020> at<00:01:32.140> first<00:01:33.480> gaining<00:01:34.480> from<00:01:34.720> where

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 
embarrassing at first gaining from where

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.520

because<00:01:35.470> I<00:01:35.740> barely<00:01:36.460> knew<00:01:36.760> that

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 
because I barely knew that

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.070 
because I barely knew that
eventually<00:01:39.369> I<00:01:39.430> got<00:01:39.549> more<00:01:39.940> comfortable<00:01:40.570> and<00:01:40.930> I

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.080 
eventually I got more comfortable and I

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.410 
eventually I got more comfortable and I
got<00:01:41.320> a<00:01:41.350> little<00:01:41.590> bit<00:01:41.799> better<00:01:41.979> I<00:01:42.460> would<00:01:42.940> kick<00:01:43.240> my

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
got a little bit better I would kick my

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.120 
got a little bit better I would kick my
board<00:01:43.750> around<00:01:43.990> and<00:01:44.320> eventually<00:01:44.500> I<00:01:44.799> was

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
board around and eventually I was

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.300 
board around and eventually I was
learning<00:01:45.909> how<00:01:46.270> to<00:01:46.330> apply<00:01:47.020> pressure<00:01:47.440> or<00:01:48.100> how<00:01:48.250> to

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
learning how to apply pressure or how to

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.609 
learning how to apply pressure or how to
kick<00:01:48.549> it<00:01:48.670> in<00:01:48.790> the<00:01:48.820> right<00:01:49.000> spot<00:01:49.060> and<00:01:49.690> eventually

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:50.619 
kick it in the right spot and eventually

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:52.320 
kick it in the right spot and eventually
it<00:01:50.740> was<00:01:50.799> people<00:01:51.009> just<00:01:51.400> doing<00:01:51.759> what<00:01:51.909> I<00:01:51.940> wanted

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:52.330 
it was people just doing what I wanted

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.139 
it was people just doing what I wanted
it<00:01:52.509> to<00:01:52.690> do<00:01:52.869> and<00:01:53.200> that's<00:01:53.759> pretty<00:01:54.759> much<00:01:54.880> how<00:01:55.119> I

00:01:55.139 --> 00:01:55.149 
it to do and that's pretty much how I

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:57.300 
it to do and that's pretty much how I
learned<00:01:55.479> learning<00:01:56.470> something<00:01:56.710> you<00:01:57.009> want<00:01:57.220> to

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
learned learning something you want to

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.730 
learned learning something you want to
skate<00:01:57.520> what<00:01:57.990> was<00:01:59.159> the<00:02:00.159> best<00:02:00.369> feeling<00:02:01.200> and<00:02:02.200> I

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
skate what was the best feeling and I

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.420 
skate what was the best feeling and I
think<00:02:03.070> that's<00:02:03.369> correct<00:02:04.119> made<00:02:04.720> me<00:02:05.280> want<00:02:06.280> to

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 
think that's correct made me want to

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.219 
think that's correct made me want to
keep<00:02:06.580> state<00:02:06.850> morning<00:02:07.299> even<00:02:07.750> when<00:02:07.869> I<00:02:07.899> fall<00:02:08.200> down

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
keep state morning even when I fall down
