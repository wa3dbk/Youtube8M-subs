00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:18.700 
this game is actually I think pretty

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.479 
this game is actually I think pretty
damn<00:00:18.880> cool<00:00:19.320> so<00:00:20.320> we'll<00:00:20.470> do<00:00:20.619> one<00:00:20.649> player<00:00:21.040> start

00:00:21.479 --> 00:00:21.489 
damn cool so we'll do one player start

00:00:21.489 --> 00:00:24.540 
damn cool so we'll do one player start
and<00:00:22.360> basically<00:00:22.930> this<00:00:23.140> little<00:00:23.349> ball<00:00:23.800> guy<00:00:24.160> and

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:24.550 
and basically this little ball guy and

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.030 
and basically this little ball guy and
you<00:00:24.669> have<00:00:24.820> to<00:00:24.970> go<00:00:25.119> around<00:00:25.419> here<00:00:26.020> swinging<00:00:26.770> on

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:27.040 
you have to go around here swinging on

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:32.880 
you have to go around here swinging on
these<00:00:27.250> pegs<00:00:27.610> to<00:00:28.509> reveal<00:00:28.930> gems<00:00:29.820> and<00:00:31.890> what

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:32.890 
these pegs to reveal gems and what

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:34.680 
these pegs to reveal gems and what
you're<00:00:33.010> trying<00:00:33.340> to<00:00:33.399> do<00:00:33.670> is<00:00:33.969> actually<00:00:34.180> reveal<00:00:34.660> a

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:34.690 
you're trying to do is actually reveal a

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:39.960 
you're trying to do is actually reveal a
shape<00:00:37.710> so<00:00:38.710> this<00:00:38.860> little<00:00:39.160> guy<00:00:39.310> has<00:00:39.460> little<00:00:39.730> arms

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:39.970 
shape so this little guy has little arms

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:42.930 
shape so this little guy has little arms
that<00:00:40.060> poke<00:00:40.390> out<00:00:40.600> and<00:00:41.230> you<00:00:42.190> basically<00:00:42.430> just

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:42.940 
that poke out and you basically just

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.270 
that poke out and you basically just
make<00:00:43.150> him<00:00:43.480> when<00:00:43.960> he<00:00:44.050> goes<00:00:44.230> through<00:00:44.280> and

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:45.280 
make him when he goes through and

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.680 
make him when he goes through and
between<00:00:45.430> pegs<00:00:45.940> and<00:00:46.120> if<00:00:46.210> there's<00:00:46.420> a<00:00:46.480> hidden

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:46.690 
between pegs and if there's a hidden

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.230 
between pegs and if there's a hidden
jewel<00:00:47.020> there<00:00:47.350> it<00:00:47.530> will<00:00:47.710> appear<00:00:48.130> and<00:00:48.579> we're

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:49.240 
jewel there it will appear and we're

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:53.730 
jewel there it will appear and we're
basically<00:00:49.570> trying<00:00:49.840> to<00:00:50.079> make<00:00:50.260> a<00:00:50.560> shape<00:00:52.740> picture

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:53.740 
basically trying to make a shape picture

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:55.560 
basically trying to make a shape picture
you're<00:00:53.890> like<00:00:54.010> a<00:00:54.100> tree<00:00:54.460> or<00:00:54.760> a<00:00:54.790> plane<00:00:55.210> or

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:55.570 
you're like a tree or a plane or

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:01.590 
you're like a tree or a plane or
whatever<00:00:59.970> so<00:01:00.970> it<00:01:01.030> looks<00:01:01.180> like<00:01:01.270> up<00:01:01.570> here

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:01.600 
whatever so it looks like up here

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:08.480 
whatever so it looks like up here
there's<00:01:02.050> something

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.650 

and<00:01:09.490> the<00:01:09.970> game<00:01:10.150> is<00:01:10.180> actually<00:01:10.450> pretty

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:10.660 
and the game is actually pretty

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:12.030 
and the game is actually pretty
challenging<00:01:10.990> because<00:01:11.290> there's<00:01:11.530> a<00:01:11.590> time<00:01:11.890> limit

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:12.040 
challenging because there's a time limit

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.120 
challenging because there's a time limit
up<00:01:13.000> top<00:01:13.240> you<00:01:13.390> can<00:01:13.540> see<00:01:13.750> I<00:01:13.990> have<00:01:14.260> a<00:01:14.290> finite

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130 
up top you can see I have a finite

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.560 
up top you can see I have a finite
amount<00:01:15.190> of<00:01:15.520> time<00:01:15.690> to<00:01:16.690> reveal<00:01:17.280> all<00:01:18.280> of<00:01:18.790> the

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
amount of time to reveal all of the

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.450 
amount of time to reveal all of the
jewels<00:01:20.020> and<00:01:20.500> the<00:01:20.620> jewels<00:01:20.979> kind<00:01:21.250> of<00:01:21.310> like

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.180 
like I got 200 go the guy's not easy to

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.510 
like I got 200 go the guy's not easy to
control<00:02:01.390> so<00:02:01.479> I<00:02:01.600> ran<00:02:01.750> out<00:02:01.869> of<00:02:01.930> time<00:02:02.020> so<00:02:02.520> my

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
control so I ran out of time so my

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.730 
control so I ran out of time so my
second<00:02:03.910> life<00:02:04.060> and<00:02:05.020> it's<00:02:05.229> actually<00:02:05.530> pretty

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
second life and it's actually pretty

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.389 
second life and it's actually pretty
tricky<00:02:06.009> to<00:02:06.160> control<00:02:06.580> this<00:02:06.700> guy

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:12.100 

because<00:02:10.970> he's<00:02:11.090> just<00:02:11.269> always<00:02:11.569> moving<00:02:11.870> you

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
because he's just always moving you

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.589 
because he's just always moving you
can't<00:02:12.349> make<00:02:12.560> him<00:02:12.680> stop<00:02:13.010> and<00:02:13.640> see<00:02:14.120> basic<00:02:14.390> at<00:02:14.480> the

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:14.599 
can't make him stop and see basic at the

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:17.800 
can't make him stop and see basic at the
time<00:02:14.870> it<00:02:15.790> where<00:02:16.790> his<00:02:16.879> arm<00:02:17.120> to<00:02:17.360> come<00:02:17.540> out<00:02:17.659> and

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
time it where his arm to come out and

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:26.589 
time it where his arm to come out and
swing<00:02:24.670> alright<00:02:25.670> so<00:02:25.790> we<00:02:25.879> made<00:02:25.909> our<00:02:26.150> heart<00:02:26.360> so

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:26.599 
swing alright so we made our heart so

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:28.539 
swing alright so we made our heart so
that's<00:02:26.750> the<00:02:26.900> first<00:02:27.110> level<00:02:27.440> and<00:02:27.590> the<00:02:28.280> shapes

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:28.549 
that's the first level and the shapes

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:32.319 
that's the first level and the shapes
are<00:02:28.730> always<00:02:28.909> random<00:02:29.269> too<00:02:29.480> so<00:02:30.849> you<00:02:31.849> do<00:02:32.180> the

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:32.329 
are always random too so you do the

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:33.880 
are always random too so you do the
first<00:02:32.540> level<00:02:32.810> is<00:02:32.930> it<00:02:33.049> always<00:02:33.170> a<00:02:33.319> heart<00:02:33.590> it

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
first level is it always a heart it

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.440 
first level is it always a heart it
changes<00:02:34.519> every<00:02:34.700> time<00:02:34.879> isn't<00:02:35.360> it<00:02:35.450> cool<00:02:35.840> okay

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
changes every time isn't it cool okay

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.910 
changes every time isn't it cool okay
all<00:02:38.450> right<00:02:38.599> so<00:02:38.750> let's<00:02:38.959> move<00:02:39.079> on<00:02:39.290> to<00:02:39.409> the<00:02:39.560> second

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
all right so let's move on to the second

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.680 
all right so let's move on to the second
level<00:02:40.040> the<00:02:40.340> second<00:02:41.090> level<00:02:41.120> they've<00:02:41.360> added

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
level the second level they've added

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.869 
level the second level they've added
these<00:02:41.780> little<00:02:41.840> drains<00:02:42.500> here<00:02:43.099> so<00:02:43.310> if<00:02:43.400> I<00:02:43.519> go<00:02:43.760> into

00:02:43.869 --> 00:02:43.879 
these little drains here so if I go into

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:45.910 
these little drains here so if I go into
them<00:02:44.120> I<00:02:44.299> will<00:02:44.450> die<00:02:44.660> and<00:02:45.109> there's<00:02:45.560> also<00:02:45.680> gonna

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
them I will die and there's also gonna

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.500 
them I will die and there's also gonna
