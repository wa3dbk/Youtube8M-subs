00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:13.500
 Hello Guitars station here of the guitar where I am this time to introduce 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:18.780
 fender custom shop custom deluxe strat 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:22.360
 Caster quilted maple top body color has adopted the pink transformer 

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:25.030
 master built by Koror This is one by hand 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:31.300
 The so-called custom deluxe stratocaster is a fender 

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:37.120
 I think that it is a form of Stratocaster which is the latest evolved form of the present progressive form to think 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:40.300
 But this model was released in 2011 at Fender Custom Shop 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.350
 custom deluxe master worth the Stratocaster 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:47.690
 And produced by the hand of a master builder 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:50.840
 It will be Japan made based on the concept of putting out 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:55.250
 It was well received when it was released at that time 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:59.360
 It is this guitar, but a vivid quilt top is adopted for the top 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.589
 But this is a pretty gorgeous top that can be said to be a master build spec 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:07.710
 It has become 

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:11.790
 And I have adopted the same foot body in the body bag, but a thin heel system 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:15.210
 For the specs of such places or the upper emperor, etc. custom deluxe 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.540
 Inheriting the 2011 custom deluxe Stratocaster 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.540
 is 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:30.490
 As for the person in the assembly, it is also equipped with a master design pickup 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:36.640
 Fender's strat is just like adopting a so-called two- point support arm unit 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:40.840
 The Stratocaster produced in the 50's and produced in the 50's this 2012 and 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:45.340
 Playability when replaced with 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:48.579
 One is to improve the quality of the so-called arm and to increase the stability of tuning 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:51.600
 Is generously what has been adopted as an evaluation of 

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:51.600
 Is adopted 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:59.659
 Of course the finger board 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:05.420
 We adopt 9.5 inches of large dias selling big fret or 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:08.190
 Racer natto to increase tuning stability even for Nacky 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:11.890
 Also with respect to or peg 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:16.180
 It is equipped with the locker style of Schiller 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.959
 Has inherited the custom deluxe strat released in 2011 completely 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.569
 But 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.989
 a 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:26.450
 It is selected because it becomes a master build specification 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:31.189
 The material and fine side of this body top that is neck and selected 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:33.500
 Edge finish and frets are the whole built-in technology package 

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:37.940
 To the hands of the master build 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:41.990
 Therefore, one artist gets it by being created 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:46.310
 I think it is finished in the same spec as Japan 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:48.370
 I would like to confirm the power of this guitar with sound samples 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.370
