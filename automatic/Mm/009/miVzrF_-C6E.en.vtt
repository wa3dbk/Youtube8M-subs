00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.970
 so it's asking today I decided 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:04.920
 to show you what there is to 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.870
 inside a handbag at the 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.110
 last I did a lot of time 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.920
 now I think because we have a name of 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.809
 perhaps 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.299
 frankly it goes so fast you 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.970
 know that's going on so I got 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:21.210
 said today I refined and I 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.160
 will have to film a video actually and I 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.779
 can not for reasons that are 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.670
 complicated today I can not so 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.380
 the six-fours I smoke to something else and from 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.060
 blow I'm for buddies what is my 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.949
 baby our part i know there are some who 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.540
 has a lot of their videos me I you 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.219
 admit that I do not like it happened 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:39.629
 the day of idiots that I never look 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:41.340
 and that I lose I never look past 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.780
 it does not interest me frankly ugly I 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.640
 know that there are some who like a lot 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.629
 so it's worth it for all tastes and 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.920
 so today I want to show this 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.809
 that there is in my bag and I'm going 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.410
 start by getting my bag 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.239
 already passed a first kamikaze like this 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.789
 if you followed a little bit 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.680
 but video you knew a good 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.449
 birthday I had in September so 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.250
 this year by my father who gave it to me 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.979
 offered so it's a radical link up 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.950
 it's the mini mac etc the head i got 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.770
 more common is called falling I do not know 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.080
 anyway it's a kind of 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.939
 gray selling very pastel tools 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.439
 sweet it's a color to its original I 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.150
 finds both very born two 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.549
 boats with lots of stuff so at 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.250
 chain level it's golden you have 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.320
 part of the nièvre did it is 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.030
 in front of you have a clip that perso 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.799
 I never have and you can 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.329
 remove and underneath there is also a 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.500
 other 

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:33.840
 our wallet to start with a 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.369
 fat sadr you imagine that I do not 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.110
 no door to my house in my bag 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.060
 for me I loved the most essential thing 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.430
 is more basic so it's not 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.229
 necessarily crazy stuff that to 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.390
 inside I think everyone 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.610
 in more or less door to one or two 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.680
 stuff created 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.180
 so start to begin 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.700
 Dumps and always my phone 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.020
 in it's the iphone 5 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.550
 there are many people who tell me 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.220
 that it's fun 6 but I swear to you that 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.780
 no it's the iphone 5g not changed and 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.700
 it's always with the coop kate spade 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.100
 I had a good birthday too 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.620
 I also have my wallet that I have 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:09.410
 read this one at christmas and led by my mother 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:10.820
 and who is also worried and I you 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.470
 do in close up so that the drawer 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:14.360
 but it's the prettiest buggy 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.640
 that I have never owned in the nose and 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.459
 rose gold and he stayed there two 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.980
 billion golden glitter 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:23.360
 go up by month it's a killing and he 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.060
 is as ample and very pretty 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.440
 practice often like this and after the ag 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.850
 I can put all my cards 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.190
 I like past always has to work 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:32.720
 to put a picture and it's too 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.250
 stupid but me when jean germain 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.590
 wallet if there is no plant 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.360
 the location for a photo that does it 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.350
 less because here is a picture of my 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.120
 grandfather but I like a lot 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:43.610
 a lot and I love seeing her in the bag 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.870
 then I have this little pouch where I 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.270
 do not put my foot either 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.830
 passport that I had bought h &amp; m this 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:50.480
 year and at least one other reason that they 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:51.500
 make it more expensive in pet and I find that 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.880
 super cool not 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.380
 not only this meeting with the 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.320
 little draw but it is also very convenient 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.820
 and after best my passport which I 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:01.010
 does not need it next month since 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.870
 Thursday on a trip so the wide or renounces 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.130
 to whom sometimes I happen to forget my 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.530
 my ID 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.880
 short yes I know it happens so me 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.560
 blow I have all their passports on me 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.630
 and his accomplice of ID so 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.330
 these practices that they will let go quay 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:16.070
 I also have an external charger can 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:17.810
 to be that I had bought on us so 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:19.370
 loaded my phone so here I have not the 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.709
 son because he is on the desk 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.209
 and if not I take the thread in fact you 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:24.860
 have if you have an iphone you know 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:26.840
 how much the battery and not necessarily 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:28.220
 hyper hyper hanging father 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.140
 they are discharged very quickly 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.240
 to see this charger always with me at 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.770
 just the loaded at home before well 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:35.030
 heard after you can charge of 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:36.500
 even for everyone so sit down a little 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.290
 few davis what kind of stuff then i 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.740

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:41.660
 perfume 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:43.010
 in fact what's too cool is that 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:45.500
 you can put any perfume 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:47.750

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:50.060
 put it on the pump and bombay in 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:51.440
 made and the scent of the interior and the 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.180
 blow you have your perfume in your 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.640
 bag and you can doubt it 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:58.880
 as many times as you want this one 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:01.190
 a simple one that I had bought in a 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:03.230
 store here at then 7 and tati or 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:04.910

 more where and whatever it is you in 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.709
 find more and more everywhere and that's 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:14.900
 super convenient this stuff then 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:16.700
 that's the function it's the practical part 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:19.400
 I always say my prophecy about me 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:19.820
 I have plenty of cash and good space 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.790
 coffee 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:25.370
 I came to be parent and instigation 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:27.890
 do you see for all possible value 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:29.810
 25 and a small inner pocket so 

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:31.940
 and I always put a little mirror 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:34.130
 quillan from power to be one they have 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:35.390
 do they have plenty of always who 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:37.070
 costs one in league 2 3 euros 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:38.750
 they are super nice very practical of the 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:39.680
 spent a part you feel a 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:41.210
 normal part 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.040
 I also created matte paper 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:45.260
 good students that I have for ages 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.669
 but that kind of thing is the same thing 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:49.280
 evening a little bit of big English 32 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:50.750
 photos and you have areas a 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.970
 little bit too much in your taste 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:55.250
 it's super nice that it's nothing 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:57.320
 background but I adhere gisèle a lot 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:59.390
 more collective aka jean goals conceded 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:01.250
 kleenex who does this and where at this game me 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:03.350
 talked about kleenex handkerchiefs I buy 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:05.330
 the right whale I took them to the 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:07.370
 devil but full of reasons and inevitably 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:08.720
 I have my placement the apps for any 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:10.130
 the house and I recalled the whole 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.510
 particle cake and I go everywhere in 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:13.760
 my room and in my bag 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:17.390
 then I have a pen of course and 

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:18.860
 I even have another genre both and 

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:20.630
 you too much that not enough in his scene 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:22.460
 never leave my bag a knowing 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:23.810
 changes lived and I always have a 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:25.310
 mini I like this tray you have to mater the 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:27.560
 york fashion was going by the way I love it 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:29.030
 I think I have a big illness 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:30.310
 with that I love collecting them 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:31.960
 January 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:33.100
 the rooms there are at least three in 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:35.020
 my room as much in the room 

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:38.680
 of honor as much in the kitchen everywhere 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:40.750
 and so there a berry shortcake dryer and 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:42.460
 it smells too good and you see that I have 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:44.800
 still well used and this is the 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:46.750
 kind of stuff we always need in 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:49.540
 public transport circles in 

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:51.670
 shops or touching arms 

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:53.080
 it's hyper month and finally the last ones 

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:54.580
 stuff that's the makeup you go 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:55.990
 see that it's nothing at all because 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:57.820
 no I do not put a kit in 

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:59.860
 make-up inside for the simple 

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:01.240
 and good reason that I already have the most 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:03.130
 obvious is that we do not have any more 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:04.330
 of places after and the second is that 

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:05.470
 even if I did not know I do not know 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:07.660
 will take very honestly 

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:09.460
 because when I leave it's 

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:10.900
 often for the day or for a few 

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:12.670
 hours and I do not feel the need to 

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:14.440
 see a shoot on the spot I take 

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:16.720
 just but essential for the lips by 

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:18.490
 example today games per year 

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:21.010
 next so I take the lipstick 

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:24.070
 that I have today who is the brand 

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:24.760
 bugatti and it was a little jean jumbo 

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:26.650
 on your mind 

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:28.450
 bergin if they wanted to know everything I 

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:29.470
 always take the product as soon as I 

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:31.810
 about me now 

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:33.640
 and sometimes we announced I practically 

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:37.180
 all the time a block and that's very 

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:39.790
 often this one home chanel is the 

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:40.360
 number 189 of the lady lips 

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:42.970
 sparkling 

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:44.980
 justin is pale rose for both 

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:47.320
 retouching and after their finished match of 

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:48.520
 letac is completely empty you 

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:50.560
 can see so we have the impression 

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:52.540
 that they round that does not have a lot of room 

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:54.100

 despite everything he is not hyper 

00:06:56.170 --> 00:07:00.340
 hyper margin but enough for 

00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:01.960
 carry the essentials of my thing 

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:04.960

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:06.550

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:08.470
 sacred that's what I carry very 

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:11.380
