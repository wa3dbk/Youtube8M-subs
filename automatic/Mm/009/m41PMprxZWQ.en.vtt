scissor audio and it's time to replace
the<00:00:05.580> rear<00:00:05.730> ones<00:00:06.000> and<00:00:06.779> I've<00:00:06.990> already<00:00:07.109> raised

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
the rear ones and I've already raised

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.100 
the rear ones and I've already raised

the vehicle and support it it on jack
stands<00:00:10.380> by<00:00:11.250> placing<00:00:11.670> them<00:00:11.820> under<00:00:11.969> the<00:00:12.300> rear

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
stands by placing them under the rear

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.049 
stands by placing them under the rear
axle<00:00:13.099> you<00:00:14.099> definitely<00:00:14.610> want<00:00:14.759> to<00:00:14.790> make<00:00:14.880> sure

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
axle you definitely want to make sure

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.380 
axle you definitely want to make sure
that<00:00:15.269> your<00:00:15.420> rear<00:00:15.630> actually<00:00:16.109> supported<00:00:17.390> before

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
that your rear actually supported before

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.460 
that your rear actually supported before
we<00:00:18.570> try<00:00:18.779> to<00:00:18.840> take<00:00:19.260> the<00:00:19.410> shocks<00:00:19.650> out<00:00:21.410> now<00:00:22.410> I've

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
we try to take the shocks out now I've

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.580 
we try to take the shocks out now I've
already<00:00:22.680> replaced<00:00:22.890> at<00:00:23.130> least<00:00:24.289> the<00:00:25.289> shock<00:00:25.560> on

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
already replaced at least the shock on

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:26.390 
already replaced at least the shock on
the<00:00:25.800> driver's<00:00:26.160> side

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
the driver's side

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.179 
the driver's side
guess<00:00:26.880> it's<00:00:27.090> nice<00:00:27.240> and<00:00:27.449> shiny<00:00:27.769> and<00:00:28.769> I'm<00:00:29.010> gonna

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
guess it's nice and shiny and I'm gonna

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.730 
guess it's nice and shiny and I'm gonna
do<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:29.760> passenger<00:00:30.240> side<00:00:30.480> and<00:00:30.869> show<00:00:31.529> you<00:00:31.590> how

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
do the passenger side and show you how

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.620 
do the passenger side and show you how
to<00:00:31.830> do<00:00:31.949> that<00:00:32.040> because<00:00:32.279> they<00:00:32.579> are<00:00:32.610> identical

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
to do that because they are identical

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.580 
to do that because they are identical
first<00:00:34.320> I'm<00:00:34.410> gonna<00:00:34.530> unscrew<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:36.050> bottom<00:00:37.050> mount

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
first I'm gonna unscrew the bottom mount

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.130 
first I'm gonna unscrew the bottom mount
nut<00:00:37.890> which<00:00:38.550> is<00:00:38.610> a<00:00:38.730> 19<00:00:39.120> millimeter<00:00:39.329> nut<00:00:39.780> and

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
nut which is a 19 millimeter nut and

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.500 
nut which is a 19 millimeter nut and
then<00:00:40.350> us<00:00:41.309> were<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.670> one<00:00:41.820> on<00:00:41.940> top<00:00:42.120> which<00:00:42.329> is<00:00:42.360> a

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
then us were the one on top which is a

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.400 
then us were the one on top which is a
14<00:00:43.050> millimeter<00:00:43.879> so<00:00:44.879> I'm<00:00:45.180> now<00:00:45.510> under<00:00:46.260> the

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
14 millimeter so I'm now under the

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.520 
14 millimeter so I'm now under the
vehicle<00:00:46.800> and<00:00:47.539> that's<00:00:48.539> where<00:00:48.840> that<00:00:49.020> top<00:00:49.260> mount

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
vehicle and that's where that top mount

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.510 
vehicle and that's where that top mount
is<00:00:49.890> right<00:00:50.520> on<00:00:50.700> top<00:00:50.879> there<00:00:52.190> what's<00:00:53.190> kind<00:00:53.430> of

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
is right on top there what's kind of

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.740 
is right on top there what's kind of
annoying<00:00:53.820> because<00:00:53.969> you<00:00:54.120> can't<00:00:54.329> get<00:00:54.449> a<00:00:54.510> socket

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
annoying because you can't get a socket

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.790 
annoying because you can't get a socket
wrench<00:00:54.930> in<00:00:55.260> there<00:00:57.230> you<00:00:58.230> have<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:58.410> use<00:00:58.500> one<00:00:58.770> of

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
wrench in there you have to use one of

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.189 
wrench in there you have to use one of
these<00:00:58.949> guys<00:00:59.129> here<00:00:59.399> and<00:00:59.609> it<00:00:59.730> takes<00:00:59.910> a<00:01:00.030> while<00:01:00.199> the

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
these guys here and it takes a while the

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.049 
these guys here and it takes a while the
top<00:01:01.590> nut<00:01:01.800> on<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.070> other<00:01:02.250> shock<00:01:02.789> I<00:01:02.820> just

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
top nut on the other shock I just

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.719 
top nut on the other shock I just
replaced<00:01:03.619> that<00:01:04.619> was<00:01:04.739> a<00:01:04.769> little<00:01:04.979> project<00:01:05.640> in

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
replaced that was a little project in

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.219 
replaced that was a little project in
and<00:01:05.850> of<00:01:05.880> itself<00:01:06.210> because<00:01:06.390> took<00:01:06.630> about<00:01:06.840> 20

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
and of itself because took about 20

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.570 
and of itself because took about 20
minutes<00:01:07.260> to<00:01:07.530> get<00:01:07.650> it<00:01:07.799> out<00:01:07.920> it<00:01:08.280> was<00:01:08.400> a<00:01:08.430> little

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
minutes to get it out it was a little

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.090 
minutes to get it out it was a little
rushed<00:01:08.909> didn't<00:01:09.299> want<00:01:09.420> to<00:01:09.479> come<00:01:09.600> on<00:01:09.720> at<00:01:10.619> all<00:01:10.799> so

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
rushed didn't want to come on at all so

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.130 
rushed didn't want to come on at all so
uh<00:01:11.130> I<00:01:11.580> went<00:01:12.330> ahead<00:01:12.420> and<00:01:12.659> sprayed<00:01:12.780> this<00:01:12.990> one

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
uh I went ahead and sprayed this one

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.750 
uh I went ahead and sprayed this one
with<00:01:13.260> some<00:01:13.290> PB<00:01:13.650> Blaster<00:01:14.159> hopeful<00:01:14.520> it'll<00:01:14.640> come

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
with some PB Blaster hopeful it'll come

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.570 
with some PB Blaster hopeful it'll come
out<00:01:14.850> easier<00:01:15.799> just<00:01:16.799> like<00:01:17.040> with<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.310> front

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
out easier just like with the front

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.490 
out easier just like with the front
shocks<00:01:17.880> I<00:01:18.090> went<00:01:18.420> ahead<00:01:18.509> and<00:01:18.750> clamp<00:01:19.020> this<00:01:19.200> top

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
shocks I went ahead and clamp this top

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.580 
shocks I went ahead and clamp this top
part<00:01:19.740> of<00:01:19.799> it<00:01:20.299> with<00:01:21.299> vice<00:01:21.509> grips<00:01:21.780> to<00:01:22.290> prevent

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
part of it with vice grips to prevent

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.429 
part of it with vice grips to prevent
the<00:01:22.909> piston<00:01:23.909> inside<00:01:24.060> from<00:01:24.420> turning<00:01:25.259> when<00:01:25.290> I

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
the piston inside from turning when I

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:26.960 
the piston inside from turning when I
one<00:01:25.590> screw<00:01:25.830> in<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.009> nut<00:01:26.130> otherwise<00:01:26.759> she

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
one screw in the nut otherwise she

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.980 
one screw in the nut otherwise she
wasn't<00:01:27.180> able<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.390> do<00:01:27.600> it<00:01:27.750> oh<00:01:29.540> this<00:01:30.540> nut<00:01:30.750> came

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
wasn't able to do it oh this nut came

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.830 
wasn't able to do it oh this nut came
out<00:01:31.110> actually<00:01:31.470> a<00:01:31.500> little<00:01:31.650> easier<00:01:31.979> and<00:01:32.430> uh<00:01:32.840> to

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
out actually a little easier and uh to

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.190 
out actually a little easier and uh to
get<00:01:34.020> this<00:01:34.110> thing<00:01:34.290> I<00:01:34.439> don't<00:01:34.650> wanna<00:01:35.780> pull<00:01:36.780> it<00:01:36.990> to

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
get this thing I don't wanna pull it to

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:46.069 
get this thing I don't wanna pull it to
fully<00:01:37.770> compress<00:01:38.670> it<00:01:39.619> all<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.860> way<00:01:44.869> and<00:01:45.869> then

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
fully compress it all the way and then

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.569 
fully compress it all the way and then
bring<00:01:46.259> it<00:01:46.380> this<00:01:46.649> way<00:01:47.030> below<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.240> exhaust<00:01:48.840> pipe

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:49.579 
bring it this way below the exhaust pipe

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:52.780 
bring it this way below the exhaust pipe
and<00:01:50.579> slide<00:01:50.880> it<00:01:51.030> out<00:01:51.119> there<00:01:51.630> we<00:01:51.750> go

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 
and slide it out there we go

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.010 
and slide it out there we go
this<00:01:53.790> was<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.060> right<00:01:54.210> time<00:01:54.390> to<00:01:54.450> replace<00:01:54.869> this

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
this was the right time to replace this

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.819 
this was the right time to replace this
thing<00:01:55.259> because<00:01:55.759> if<00:01:56.759> you<00:01:56.909> look<00:01:57.119> at<00:01:57.270> it<00:01:57.770> when<00:01:58.770> I

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
thing because if you look at it when I

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:03.350 
thing because if you look at it when I
press<00:01:59.130> on<00:01:59.310> it<00:01:59.460> it<00:02:01.340> doesn't<00:02:02.340> want<00:02:02.579> to<00:02:02.670> come<00:02:03.329> back

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
I slid the bottom of the shock on that

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.660 
I slid the bottom of the shock on that
bottom<00:02:53.940> mount<00:02:54.390> bolt<00:02:54.690> and<00:02:55.310> looks<00:02:56.310> like<00:02:56.400> it's

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
bottom mount bolt and looks like it's

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.640 
bottom mount bolt and looks like it's
not<00:02:56.820> compressed<00:02:57.540> enough<00:02:57.720> to<00:02:58.050> make<00:02:58.290> it<00:02:58.410> past

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
not compressed enough to make it past

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.300 
not compressed enough to make it past
this<00:02:58.830> tailpipe<00:02:59.310> in<00:02:59.489> the<00:02:59.610> exhaust<00:02:59.880> pipe<00:03:00.000> here

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
this tailpipe in the exhaust pipe here

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.510 
this tailpipe in the exhaust pipe here
so<00:03:02.310> I'm<00:03:03.300> gonna<00:03:03.450> have<00:03:03.570> to<00:03:04.010> press<00:03:05.010> on<00:03:05.160> this<00:03:05.310> thing

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
it it goes past the exhaust pipe and

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.979 
it it goes past the exhaust pipe and
into<00:03:12.840> the<00:03:13.970> how's<00:03:14.970> it<00:03:15.180> going<00:03:15.360> to<00:03:15.450> belongs<00:03:15.690> up

of times before fully tightening of the

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:44.939 
of times before fully tightening of the
nuts<00:04:42.850> to<00:04:43.539> kind<00:04:43.750> of<00:04:43.810> let<00:04:43.930> the<00:04:44.020> bushings<00:04:44.350> see<00:04:44.860> the

nuts to kind of let the bushings see the

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:47.330 
nuts to kind of let the bushings see the
place<00:04:45.240> so<00:04:46.240> I'm<00:04:46.300> going<00:04:46.479> to<00:04:46.570> do<00:04:46.630> that<00:04:46.810> and<00:04:47.020> then
