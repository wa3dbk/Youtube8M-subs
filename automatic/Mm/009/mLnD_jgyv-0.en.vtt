soil<00:03:01.139> smelled<00:03:01.500> really<00:03:01.829> good<00:03:02.010> because<00:03:02.340> it<00:03:02.879> has

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
soil smelled really good because it has

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:06.819 
soil smelled really good because it has
a<00:03:03.269> lot<00:03:03.629> of<00:03:03.659> organic<00:03:04.079> formatter<00:03:04.739> forest<00:03:05.730> humise

perlite and composted chicken manure and
believe<00:03:10.560> it<00:03:10.620> or<00:03:10.739> not<00:03:10.859> that<00:03:10.919> stuff<00:03:11.370> does<00:03:11.549> smell

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
believe it or not that stuff does smell

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.940 
believe it or not that stuff does smell
good<00:03:11.819> when<00:03:12.150> it's<00:03:12.329> composted<00:03:13.319> properly<00:03:13.769> and

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
good when it's composted properly and

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:21.000 
good when it's composted properly and
it's<00:03:14.069> a<00:03:14.129> premium<00:03:14.459> potting<00:03:14.819> soil<00:03:15.079> plant

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.949 

kind<00:03:22.010> of<00:03:22.069> cool<00:03:22.250> to<00:03:22.390> alternate<00:03:23.390> the<00:03:23.420> lettuces

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959 
kind of cool to alternate the lettuces

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:25.930 
kind of cool to alternate the lettuces
dark<00:03:24.349> and<00:03:24.560> light<00:03:24.709> and<00:03:24.980> along<00:03:25.459> the<00:03:25.610> front<00:03:25.849> I

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
dark and light and along the front I

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:27.789 
dark and light and along the front I
think<00:03:26.180> that's<00:03:26.870> a<00:03:26.989> good<00:03:27.080> point<00:03:27.290> it<00:03:27.500> gives<00:03:27.620> it<00:03:27.709> a

00:03:27.789 --> 00:03:27.799 
think that's a good point it gives it a

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:29.440 
think that's a good point it gives it a
little<00:03:27.920> bit<00:03:28.129> of<00:03:28.220> visual<00:03:28.549> interest<00:03:28.909> what<00:03:29.420> I

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
little bit of visual interest what I

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:31.210 
little bit of visual interest what I
really<00:03:29.840> like<00:03:30.049> is<00:03:30.080> mixing<00:03:30.799> things<00:03:30.980> up

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
really like is mixing things up

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.460 
really like is mixing things up
balancing<00:03:32.000> it<00:03:32.150> putting<00:03:32.420> tall<00:03:32.720> stuff<00:03:33.019> and<00:03:33.230> back

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
balancing it putting tall stuff and back

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.979 
balancing it putting tall stuff and back
putting<00:03:34.190> flowers<00:03:34.580> and<00:03:34.790> strategic<00:03:35.330> spots<00:03:35.629> I

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:35.989 
putting flowers and strategic spots I

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:37.589 
putting flowers and strategic spots I
don't<00:03:36.260> really<00:03:36.440> see<00:03:36.799> any<00:03:37.069> reason<00:03:37.310> for

00:03:37.589 --> 00:03:37.599 
don't really see any reason for

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:40.330 
don't really see any reason for
vegetables<00:03:38.599> to<00:03:38.780> be<00:03:38.959> in<00:03:39.230> straight<00:03:39.620> lines<00:03:39.650> or<00:03:40.250> in

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
vegetables to be in straight lines or in

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:42.220 
vegetables to be in straight lines or in
some<00:03:40.489> boring<00:03:41.000> pattern<00:03:41.420> I<00:03:41.629> like<00:03:41.840> it<00:03:42.019> to<00:03:42.140> be

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
some boring pattern I like it to be

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:45.059 
some boring pattern I like it to be
pretty<00:03:42.700> the<00:03:43.700> more<00:03:43.849> flowers<00:03:44.180> the<00:03:44.299> better

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:45.069 
pretty the more flowers the better

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:47.910 
pretty the more flowers the better
flowers<00:03:46.069> what<00:03:46.519> why<00:03:46.730> is<00:03:46.760> planting<00:03:47.329> flowers<00:03:47.659> too

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 
flowers what why is planting flowers too
