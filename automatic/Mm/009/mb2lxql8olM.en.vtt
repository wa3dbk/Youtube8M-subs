00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.650
 we decided to devote this top by 

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:14.290
 amazing and incredible landscape 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:16.540
 planets earth what influenced their creation 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:19.090
 is any mystic connected with it 

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:23.280
 all this you have to learn so 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.280
 we look at the real wonders of nature 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:29.590
 perhaps we will start with the most unearthly 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:32.380
 plot of our planet dry valleys in 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:35.020
 Antarctic wilderness is unique in that it 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:37.090
 the driest place on earth is here him 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:39.910
 filed no precipitation throughout 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.950
 a few million years old this place by 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.260
 its climate is closest to 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:46.510
 mars therefore represents a special 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.520
 interest for us and here are held 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.220
 Mars rover trials are underway. 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.930
 research in all directions is 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:55.629
 only part of antarctica 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:58.210
 not covered with ice in the valleys is located 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:00.430
 frozen lake with extremely salty 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.800
 water under the ice were discovered 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.809
 mysterious bacteria and organism and this 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:09.479
 the find proved the theory 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:09.479
 about the fact that life on Mars exists 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:16.180
 the island is in second place 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.400
 Socotra landscapes of this island unique 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:21.130
 are more like alien 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.590
 geographical island isolated from 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:26.050
 africa for six million years 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.360
 replete with many extremely rare 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:30.520
 flora and fauna species third of 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:33.340
 they are endemic only here 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.170
 despite the hot and dry climate here 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:38.350
 a lot of amazing and beautiful grows 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:41.369
 many plants of which about 20 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.369
 million years 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:47.030
 Rio 's career is on the list 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:49.100
 tinto in andalusia in which is underway 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.730
 extraction of the most unusual pink 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.580
 diamonds 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:54.800
 huge rio tinto careers create and 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:57.520
 real like a lunar landscape 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.810
 careers are named after the river of the same name 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.730
 flowing here and you him 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.770
 minerals from the huge 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:05.870
 mining craters here was fought on 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.690
 over many centuries therefore the river 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:11.210
 turned bright red-orange color and 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.520
 and acidity and metal saturation 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:15.680
 just rolls over the present moment 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.530
 mining in this region has ceased 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:23.720
 and rio tinto attracts crowds to andalusia 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:26.270
 tourists and photographers and that's not all 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:29.090
 I bet you never heard of 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:32.330
 spotted lake and certainly not seen 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:34.900
 such stunning landscapes are located 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:37.220
 lake in british columbia in canada 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.530
 depending on weather conditions and 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.960
 the seasons the lake crystallizes and 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.300
 painted in a specific color on the ultrasound 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.580
 and a lot of spots of circles are formed from 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:49.160
 minerals is the biggest in the world 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:52.280
 the concentration of magnesium sulfate is calcium and 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:54.260
 sodium as well as silver and titanium it 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.480
 place is sacred to native indians 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:59.090
 Canada and is famous for its healing 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.930
 properties for this he was given the name 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.930
 Klyluk 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:10.189
 another unusual landscape is the biggest 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:12.560
 the world's salt lake Salar de Uyuni this 

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:15.260
 a beautiful area with a huge salty 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:18.260
 desert active volcanoes large 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:20.359
 cacti islands and geyser at 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.730
 surface of the lake you can ride on 

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:25.489
 jeep admire unusual places 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:27.560
 the unearthly beauty of this place salt marsh 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:30.139
 Uyuni is well visible from space 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:33.010
 is one of the calibration points 

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:33.010
 satellites 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.450
 another unique terrain is in 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.580
 brazil 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:42.730
 valide moon which means 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:44.739
 moon valley is a rock formation 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:47.349
 washed with natural water 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:49.209
 swimming pools located 

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:51.730
 lead moon in brazilian forest 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:54.549
 is one of the oldest on the planet 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:59.590
 quartz rock formations 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:04:02.260
 and crystals unreal landscape there and in 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:05.019
 Japan is a bloody pond one of 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:07.690
 famous sources of ills pop in this 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:08.260
 the city has 9 unusual sources 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:10.810
 geysers 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:13.200
 but the most famous among them is the bloody 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:15.730
 bright red hot water pond 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.260
 this color is due to high 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.930
 iron content in water 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:25.240
 this one also lies the most photogenic among 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:27.900
 all sources in eighth place in our 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:30.789
 Shilin Stone Forest in China 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:33.100
 stunning karst topography sample 

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:34.479
 the rocks are made of limestone and 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.550
 formed by water 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:39.220
 destroyed all but these pillars 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:41.680
 similar to trees from the time of the dynasty 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:44.700
 ming stone forest sewed is not known as 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.700
 first wonder of the world 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:55.090
 another miracle of nature famous gate 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:57.910
 to hell Darwaza in Turkmenistan 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:05:00.250
 also hit our list this place 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:03.639
 scares its power with thousands of tons of lava and 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:05.290
 heat emanating from the bowels of the earth is 

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:08.620
 burning crater in the middle of the desert 

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:11.979
 Karakum its diameter is 60 meters and the depth 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:14.650
 20 meters inherently Darwaz is 

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:15.699
 gas well the history of his discovery 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:17.770
 quite interesting 

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:19.570
 are the researchers in uri well here 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:22.090
 to get gas but as a result 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:24.280
 opened this huge abyss 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:26.490
 the gas had to be set on fire so no one would 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.490
 poisoned 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:32.380
 close the list of the most amazing 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:35.440
 land landscapes and ice caves from 

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:37.170
 risen welt these caves are different from 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:39.910
 any other ice caves 

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:42.250
 being unusual here you feel 

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:44.650
 in some other fabulous dimension 

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:47.590
 There are many ice caves in the world 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:49.180
 but the caves of risen welt are the biggest 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:52.660
 among them is their total length 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:54.400
 is 40 kilometers and to visit 

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:56.740
 only a small part is open 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:58.570
 but even this is enough for thousands 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:03.090
 tourists admired every day 

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:03.090
 the grandeur and singularity of this place
