00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.749 
saw a lot to learn and race craft and
pit<00:01:41.880> stops<00:01:42.150> etc<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:43.020> fujitsu<00:01:43.619> grm<00:01:44.220> team<00:01:44.520> is

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
pit stops etc the fujitsu grm team is

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.480 
pit stops etc the fujitsu grm team is
prepared<00:01:45.450> to<00:01:45.540> be<00:01:45.750> patient<00:01:46.020> expectations<00:01:46.950> I

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
prepared to be patient expectations I

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.819 
prepared to be patient expectations I
guess<00:01:47.700> can<00:01:48.270> be<00:01:48.420> a<00:01:48.450> double-edged<00:01:49.200> sword<00:01:49.229> so<00:01:49.799> I

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
guess can be a double-edged sword so I

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:54.410 
guess can be a double-edged sword so I
think<00:01:49.950> we<00:01:50.850> just<00:01:50.880> want<00:01:51.210> to<00:01:51.270> go<00:01:52.640> at<00:01:53.640> our<00:01:53.820> pace<00:01:54.060> and

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
think we just want to go at our pace and

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.850 
think we just want to go at our pace and
make<00:01:54.659> sure<00:01:54.810> that<00:01:54.960> he<00:01:55.110> gets<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.680> best

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
make sure that he gets the best

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.190 
make sure that he gets the best
equipment<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.549> best<00:01:56.990> support<00:01:57.990> that<00:01:58.110> we

equipment and the best support that we

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.700 
equipment and the best support that we
can<00:01:58.350> give<00:01:58.500> them<00:01:58.590> and<00:01:59.659> hopefully<00:02:00.659> he'll<00:02:01.110> you'll

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
can give them and hopefully he'll you'll

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.670 
can give them and hopefully he'll you'll
progress<00:02:02.329> pretty<00:02:03.329> quickly<00:02:03.600> but<00:02:03.869> as<00:02:04.439> I<00:02:04.619> said

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
progress pretty quickly but as I said

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.859 
progress pretty quickly but as I said
it's<00:02:05.009> it's<00:02:05.219> very<00:02:05.610> difficult<00:02:05.850> to<00:02:06.119> put<00:02:06.600> a<00:02:06.630> number

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
it's it's very difficult to put a number

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.660 
it's it's very difficult to put a number
on<00:02:07.020> whatever<00:02:07.560> we<00:02:07.860> would<00:02:08.009> like<00:02:08.160> to<00:02:08.190> do<00:02:08.399> in<00:02:08.550> this

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569 
but I think he's very talented and it

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:16.510 
but I think he's very talented and it
would<00:02:14.750> be<00:02:14.780> good<00:02:14.990> to<00:02:15.050> see<00:02:15.170> him<00:02:15.350> soon<00:02:16.130> progress
