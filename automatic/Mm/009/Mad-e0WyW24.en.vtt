 Curiosity to see you playing 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.950

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.070

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.920

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.650
 left 4 dead 2 that was for free in steam 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.420
 at Christmas I do not know if today still okay and 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.860
 fifa 14 that I also bought because 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.860

 I see myself making videos of these others. 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.299
 games does not cover the mind will not serve 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.479
 even because it's been a long time since 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.280
 I do not play fifa and uefa oded I've seen 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.380
 some videos of this game but 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.570
 never really played then be 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.950
 let's say more than a fan 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.159
 I probably would record the staff 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.140

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.420

 on the channel and these videos from other games 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:57.299
 I believe that they would not affect 11 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.520
 bf programming let's say so 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:03.329

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:06.899

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:08.340
 another post a video more but what I 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.560
 I mean the following if I brought 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.840
 videos from other games I would continue 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.760
 bringing video 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.920
 every day, let's not say that these 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.290
 videos of other games I would also be 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:22.700
 only more for the part of the night or in the 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:25.700
 late in knowing that you are ready to 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.680
 see new games and b also warning that 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.510
 not if I bring new games and I will not 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.280
 leave the boss aside in any way 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.519
 the tips will still come 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.830
 There are many tips to bring is 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:39.950
 both kind of content to do that 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:44.060
 It does not give the time to speak here. 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:45.110
 understand or what is it is to videos bf xb 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.239
 ef 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.590
 still have a lot of time to do and can have 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:50.870
 sure I will not give it up 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.000
 But the question is, I want you. 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.489
 leave in the comments there or not 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.920
 You want these two new games 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:03:02.269
 on the channel as I spoke civil services 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.780
 more fun than tips 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:04.790
 huh 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.410
 but this is another issue that I 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.390
 I have to talk to you about one 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:10.340
 group of melo the competitive son who 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.769
 was created if I am not mistaken by the member 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.540
 of the gbr which is the value that was 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:16.940
 new tank ps3 I do not know how it is 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.829
 he's there at bs-4 but he was calm 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:22.459
 of the three is one of the best that played 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:25.040
 ps3 on ps3 I sure knew him and 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:27.049
 he created a group not sure if 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.269
 was but I think it was him and he created a 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:31.549
 discussion group the competitive child in the 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:33.380
 facebook is a group that brings together 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:39.739

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:41.030
 be pc 360 ps3 xbox wine ps4 at last everything 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:43.609
 that has to do with my son and 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:45.650
 competitive in Brazil you can enter 

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:47.930
 in this group if you have a club you 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:50.120
 enters this group it discloses its channel only 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:52.489
 with such a platform, we deem such 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.950
 we train these modalities of this 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:56.090
 Contact time is the one here 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:58.250
 if you do not have competitive edge yet 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:00.889
 that getting on some advice can also 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:03.230
 Join this group and make a post there 

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:06.500

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:08.840
 short fantasy x5 and such I look at the 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:11.060
 platform field, so too is the 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.590
 a competitive group already had some 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.870
 postulates personal exchanging ideas 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:17.389
 also about matches about championships 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:20.510
 Anyway, it 's an infamous initiative. 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:22.250
 very cool initiative of the staff of rbr 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.530
 Congratulations, so I'm helping 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.420
 to publicize this mourning 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:28.690
 that we know my son does not have 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:30.610
 very competitive and is a good 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:32.169
 idea to join the 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.120
 We join the staff of the platforms 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:38.290
 different ways to try to make 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:40.419
 this competitive grows because they are 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:43.480
 few people say that they are 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:44.919
 known in the youtube world or in the 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:47.290
 world of the internet that 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:48.940
 bf competitive we have to do 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:51.340
 the maximum to spread this to help 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:53.950
 and if competitive to grow 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:56.680
 So I'll leave the link for this group. 

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:59.830
 there in the description of the video, whoever 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:02.230
 getting in the group is sure he has 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:05.320
 some rules obviously concentrate there 

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:07.300
 services rules and that's it man this is it 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:11.080

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:13.270

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:25.210
