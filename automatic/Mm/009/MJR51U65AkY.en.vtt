next we'll be learning how to make a
gift<00:00:04.890> bag<00:00:05.420> place<00:00:06.420> your<00:00:06.990> mold<00:00:07.290> which<00:00:07.649> can<00:00:07.890> be<00:00:07.979> a

the<00:00:11.850> end<00:00:12.060> be<00:00:12.630> the<00:00:13.230> depth<00:00:13.530> of<00:00:13.710> your<00:00:14.370> mold<00:00:16.640> I'll

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
the end be the depth of your mold I'll

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.710 
the end be the depth of your mold I'll
be<00:00:17.849> using<00:00:18.029> a<00:00:18.240> glue<00:00:18.539> gun<00:00:18.810> to<00:00:19.109> secure<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.130> paper

be using a glue gun to secure the paper

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.359 
be using a glue gun to secure the paper
for<00:00:21.720> this<00:00:21.900> project<00:00:22.199> because<00:00:22.589> glue<00:00:23.130> works

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
for this project because glue works

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.640 
for this project because glue works
better<00:00:23.699> than<00:00:23.970> clear<00:00:24.570> tape<00:00:24.839> or<00:00:25.079> double-sided

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650

sections as the paper could rip you'll

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.000 
sections as the paper could rip you'll
be<00:00:41.160> hiding<00:00:41.670> this<00:00:41.790> crease<00:00:42.270> at<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.380> end<00:00:43.560> when

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
be hiding this crease at the end when

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:55.010 
be hiding this crease at the end when
you<00:00:44.220> fold<00:00:44.550> in<00:00:44.880> the<00:00:45.090> sides<00:00:53.240> place<00:00:54.240> on<00:00:54.450> the<00:00:54.540> table

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
you fold in the sides place on the table

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.430 
you fold in the sides place on the table
and<00:00:56.570> just<00:00:57.570> like<00:00:57.810> you<00:00:57.960> would<00:00:58.170> with<00:00:58.410> a

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
and just like you would with a

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.360 
and just like you would with a
rectangular<00:00:59.160> ended<00:00:59.700> box<00:01:00.829> crease<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:02.070> sides

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
rectangular ended box crease the sides

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.050 
rectangular ended box crease the sides
fold<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.420> right<00:01:03.600> flat<00:01:04.019> in<00:01:04.489> to<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.640> center

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
fold the right flat in to the center

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.140 
fold the right flat in to the center
crease<00:01:06.440> at<00:01:07.440> the<00:01:07.530> bottom<00:01:07.890> and<00:01:08.040> then<00:01:08.880> do<00:01:09.030> the

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
crease at the bottom and then do the

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.880 
crease at the bottom and then do the
same<00:01:09.360> with<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.720> left<00:01:12.350> use<00:01:13.350> your<00:01:13.650> glue<00:01:13.860> gun

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
same with the left use your glue gun

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.420 
same with the left use your glue gun
once<00:01:14.430> again<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:15.720> secure<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.320> bottom<00:01:16.740> of<00:01:17.250> the

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
once again to secure the bottom of the

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.280 
once again to secure the bottom of the
bag<00:01:18.740> you<00:01:19.740> can<00:01:19.920> add<00:01:20.100> more<00:01:20.430> glue<00:01:20.729> after<00:01:21.300> if<00:01:22.229> you

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
bag you can add more glue after if you

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:31.760 
bag you can add more glue after if you
think<00:01:22.650> it's<00:01:22.830> not<00:01:23.010> secure<00:01:23.430> enough

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.370 

next<00:01:32.770> take<00:01:32.920> the<00:01:33.130> mold<00:01:33.400> out<00:01:33.670> of<00:01:34.000> the<00:01:34.870> inside<00:01:35.350> of

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
next take the mold out of the inside of

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:41.780 
next take the mold out of the inside of
the<00:01:35.620> bag<00:01:38.610> which<00:01:39.610> can<00:01:39.910> be<00:01:40.090> a<00:01:40.120> bit<00:01:40.600> difficult

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
the bag which can be a bit difficult

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.430 
the bag which can be a bit difficult
which<00:01:42.790> is<00:01:43.000> another<00:01:43.300> reason<00:01:43.420> why<00:01:43.900> you're<00:01:44.170> using

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:44.440 
which is another reason why you're using

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:57.720 
which is another reason why you're using
stiff<00:01:45.010> paper<00:01:53.550> finish<00:01:54.550> gluing<00:01:55.170> any<00:01:56.580> edges<00:01:57.580> that

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:57.730 
stiff paper finish gluing any edges that

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:06.930 
stiff paper finish gluing any edges that
aren't<00:01:58.030> secure<00:02:04.920> now<00:02:05.920> you'll<00:02:06.130> want<00:02:06.340> to<00:02:06.520> form<00:02:06.820> a

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940 
aren't secure now you'll want to form a

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:11.970 
aren't secure now you'll want to form a
crease<00:02:07.210> in<00:02:07.480> the<00:02:07.570> side<00:02:07.840> of<00:02:07.870> the<00:02:08.140> bag<00:02:10.800> fold<00:02:11.800> the

repeat on the other side once again your

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:42.540 
repeat on the other side once again your
mold<00:02:40.540> will<00:02:40.900> determine<00:02:41.470> the<00:02:41.560> actual<00:02:41.739> size<00:02:42.340> of

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
mold will determine the actual size of

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.400 
mold will determine the actual size of
your<00:02:42.730> gift<00:02:42.940> bags<00:02:43.239> so<00:02:43.600> you<00:02:43.660> have<00:02:43.930> to<00:02:44.050> see<00:02:44.260> what
