but<00:00:57.530> the<00:00:57.620> car<00:00:57.890> is<00:00:58.460> intended<00:00:59.000> to<00:00:59.030> the<00:00:59.450> slide

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 
but the car is intended to the slide

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.950 
but the car is intended to the slide
more<00:01:00.710> than<00:01:01.400> just<00:01:01.640> a<00:01:01.760> basic<00:01:01.880> auto<00:01:02.300> cross<00:01:02.630> so

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 
more than just a basic auto cross so

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.960 
more than just a basic auto cross so
there's<00:01:03.620> places<00:01:03.860> where<00:01:04.100> you<00:01:04.670> know<00:01:04.790> they'll

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
there's places where you know they'll

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.000 
there's places where you know they'll
set<00:01:05.210> up<00:01:05.300> we<00:01:05.420> have<00:01:05.510> to<00:01:05.600> do<00:01:05.720> a<00:01:05.750> 540<00:01:06.050> slider<00:01:06.710> on<00:01:06.920> the

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.010 
set up we have to do a 540 slider on the

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.850 
set up we have to do a 540 slider on the
cone<00:01:07.280> or<00:01:07.700> drift<00:01:08.510> around<00:01:08.660> a<00:01:08.960> certain<00:01:09.170> obstacle

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
cone or drift around a certain obstacle

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:11.770 
cone or drift around a certain obstacle
I<00:01:10.070> searched<00:01:10.850> all<00:01:11.030> over<00:01:11.300> the<00:01:11.390> world<00:01:11.570> for

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
I searched all over the world for

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.359 
I searched all over the world for
interesting<00:01:12.230> places<00:01:12.470> to<00:01:12.680> go<00:01:12.890> do<00:01:13.040> these<00:01:13.220> videos

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:13.369 
interesting places to go do these videos

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:15.430 
interesting places to go do these videos
and<00:01:14.210> it's<00:01:14.300> actually<00:01:14.660> rather<00:01:14.810> rather

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:15.440 
and it's actually rather rather

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.340 
and it's actually rather rather
difficult<00:01:15.890> so<00:01:16.670> they've<00:01:16.820> taken<00:01:17.090> a<00:01:17.360> lot<00:01:17.390> of<00:01:17.690> kind

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
difficult so they've taken a lot of kind

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.710 
difficult so they've taken a lot of kind
of<00:01:18.410> the<00:01:18.530> things<00:01:18.800> that<00:01:19.070> I<00:01:19.310> could<00:01:20.150> dream<00:01:20.270> up<00:01:20.510> and

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:20.720 
of the things that I could dream up and

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.630 
of the things that I could dream up and
put<00:01:21.140> them<00:01:21.260> in<00:01:21.410> there<00:01:21.650> you<00:01:22.280> know<00:01:22.369> especially

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
put them in there you know especially

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.490 
put them in there you know especially
like<00:01:22.940> the<00:01:23.090> Battersea<00:01:23.600> Power<00:01:23.810> Station<00:01:23.960> with<00:01:24.470> a

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
like the Battersea Power Station with a

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.250 
like the Battersea Power Station with a
ton<00:01:25.250> of<00:01:25.280> obstacles<00:01:25.970> around<00:01:26.210> it<00:01:26.360> which<00:01:26.479> really

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:27.260 
ton of obstacles around it which really

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.469 
ton of obstacles around it which really
just<00:01:27.740> isn't<00:01:28.070> realistic<00:01:28.430> to<00:01:28.820> set<00:01:29.060> up<00:01:29.180> and<00:01:29.360> do

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
just isn't realistic to set up and do

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:31.710 
just isn't realistic to set up and do
but<00:01:29.900> you<00:01:30.440> know<00:01:30.560> it's<00:01:30.710> a<00:01:30.770> real<00:01:30.979> place<00:01:31.250> and

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:31.720

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.480 
but you know it's a real place and
actually<00:01:32.720> take<00:01:32.900> it<00:01:33.080> and<00:01:33.290> put<00:01:34.040> all<00:01:34.070> this<00:01:34.340> stuff

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:35.920 
actually take it and put all this stuff
in<00:01:34.729> around<00:01:35.030> it<00:01:35.180> to<00:01:35.270> actually<00:01:35.540> be<00:01:35.630> able<00:01:35.750> to<00:01:35.810> play

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 
in around it to actually be able to play

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:42.760 
in around it to actually be able to play
