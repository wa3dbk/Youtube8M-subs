00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:18.120 

okay<00:00:13.220> shot<00:00:14.220> it<00:00:14.400> on<00:00:14.490> there

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:18.130 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:19.800 

and<00:00:18.640> what<00:00:18.880> we're<00:00:19.000> going<00:00:19.029> to<00:00:19.210> want<00:00:19.359> to<00:00:19.449> do<00:00:19.599> is

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:19.810 
and what we're going to want to do is

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:27.040 
and what we're going to want to do is
connect<00:00:20.140> this<00:00:20.320> one<00:00:20.560> to<00:00:22.919> here

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:27.050 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:01:00.500 

you<00:00:27.730> could<00:00:28.730> be<00:00:28.820> on<00:00:28.910> the<00:00:29.029> open<00:00:29.300> end<00:00:29.449> left

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.090 

ok

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.300 

make<00:01:04.670> sure<00:01:04.699> you<00:01:04.970> got<00:01:05.089> a<00:01:05.150> nice

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
make sure you got a nice

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.480 
make sure you got a nice
connection<00:01:08.210> are<00:01:08.329> in<00:01:08.420> there

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.060 

wiggle<00:01:13.240> it<00:01:13.360> make<00:01:13.900> sure<00:01:14.110> it<00:01:14.200> stays<00:01:14.439> you<00:01:14.740> want<00:01:14.979> it

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.070 
wiggle it make sure it stays you want it

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.819 
wiggle it make sure it stays you want it
coming<00:01:15.340> off<00:01:15.720> or<00:01:16.720> even<00:01:17.200> a<00:01:17.259> loose<00:01:17.470> connection

00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:17.829 
coming off or even a loose connection

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:19.530 
coming off or even a loose connection
because<00:01:18.100> I<00:01:18.220> could<00:01:18.430> go<00:01:18.549> cause<00:01:18.970> sparking

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:19.540 
because I could go cause sparking

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.139 
because I could go cause sparking
especially<00:01:20.020> in<00:01:20.079> drawing<00:01:20.399> high<00:01:21.399> amperage<00:01:21.820> from

00:01:22.139 --> 00:01:22.149 
especially in drawing high amperage from

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:26.460 
especially in drawing high amperage from
the<00:01:22.299> battery<00:01:22.780> packs<00:01:24.720> in<00:01:25.720> this<00:01:25.990> case<00:01:26.229> it's

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:26.470 
the battery packs in this case it's

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.600 
the battery packs in this case it's
going<00:01:26.619> to<00:01:26.710> be<00:01:26.799> going<00:01:27.220> for<00:01:27.670> brushless<00:01:28.119> setup<00:01:28.539> so

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
going to be going for brushless setup so

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:35.100 
going to be going for brushless setup so
you<00:01:30.610> don't<00:01:30.789> want<00:01:30.970> to<00:01:33.119> you<00:01:34.119> know<00:01:34.270> if<00:01:34.630> we<00:01:34.810> want<00:01:35.020> it

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
you don't want to you know if we want it

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:36.810 
you don't want to you know if we want it
we<00:01:35.170> could<00:01:35.409> glue<00:01:35.860> that<00:01:36.009> together<00:01:36.220> right<00:01:36.610> there

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:36.820 
we could glue that together right there

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:42.020 
we could glue that together right there
so<00:01:37.030> tonight's<00:01:39.060> nice<00:01:40.060> connector<00:01:40.479> like<00:01:40.659> that

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
so tonight's nice connector like that

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.310 
so tonight's nice connector like that
but<00:01:43.030> you<00:01:43.149> don't<00:01:43.360> want<00:01:43.509> them<00:01:43.630> sparking<00:01:44.170> when

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 
but you don't want them sparking when

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.230 
but you don't want them sparking when
you're<00:01:44.500> drawing<00:01:45.069> hyams<00:01:45.520> because<00:01:45.940> that'll

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
you're drawing hyams because that'll

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.139 
you're drawing hyams because that'll
cost<00:01:46.659> to<00:01:46.929> heat<00:01:47.170> up<00:01:47.200> you<00:01:48.190> know<00:01:48.340> that<00:01:48.789> could<00:01:48.940> lead

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:49.149 
cost to heat up you know that could lead

00:01:49.149 --> 00:02:10.630 
cost to heat up you know that could lead
to<00:01:49.179> fire<00:01:49.770> any<00:01:50.770> sorts<00:01:51.250> like<00:01:51.369> that

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.820 

now<00:02:11.180> we<00:02:11.240> got<00:02:11.510> to<00:02:11.630> do<00:02:11.720> is<00:02:11.870> some<00:02:12.050> heat-shrink<00:02:14.830> you

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
now we got to do is some heat-shrink you

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.760 
now we got to do is some heat-shrink you
can<00:02:15.980> unplug<00:02:16.190> the<00:02:16.370> solder<00:02:16.610> and<00:02:16.819> iron<00:02:16.910> now

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
can unplug the solder and iron now

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:27.790 
can unplug the solder and iron now
you're<00:02:18.770> done<00:02:18.950> with<00:02:19.069> that

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.040 

what<00:02:28.400> also<00:02:28.550> is<00:02:28.730> a<00:02:28.880> good<00:02:29.120> idea<00:02:29.150> is<00:02:29.540> to<00:02:29.840> check

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
what also is a good idea is to check

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:31.870 
what also is a good idea is to check
over<00:02:30.320> these<00:02:30.440> blinds<00:02:30.740> once<00:02:31.430> before<00:02:31.760> you

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
over these blinds once before you

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.390 
over these blinds once before you
actually<00:02:32.030> put<00:02:32.300> the<00:02:32.420> heat<00:02:32.510> shrink<00:02:32.750> down<00:02:32.870> and<00:02:33.400> so

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
actually put the heat shrink down and so

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.660 
actually put the heat shrink down and so
what<00:02:34.550> we<00:02:34.640> want<00:02:34.850> to<00:02:34.880> see<00:02:35.300> here<00:02:35.660> was<00:02:35.990> lay<00:02:36.260> it<00:02:36.410> out

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
what we want to see here was lay it out

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.860 
what we want to see here was lay it out
here's<00:02:37.670> the<00:02:37.850> one<00:02:38.150> that's<00:02:38.450> going<00:02:38.570> to<00:02:38.660> be<00:02:38.750> going

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
here's the one that's going to be going

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.540 
here's the one that's going to be going
to<00:02:38.990> the<00:02:39.260> rest<00:02:39.500> of<00:02:39.560> the<00:02:39.650> system<00:02:40.040> and<00:02:40.220> here's<00:02:40.370> the

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
to the rest of the system and here's the

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.270 
to the rest of the system and here's the
two<00:02:40.700> battery<00:02:41.060> hookups<00:02:41.980> we're<00:02:42.980> going<00:02:43.070> to<00:02:43.130> want

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
two battery hookups we're going to want

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.760 
two battery hookups we're going to want
to<00:02:43.370> see<00:02:43.550> if<00:02:43.700> there's<00:02:43.910> a<00:02:44.020> positive<00:02:45.020> wire<00:02:45.470> coming

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770 
to see if there's a positive wire coming

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:47.170 
to see if there's a positive wire coming
here<00:02:46.010> out<00:02:46.130> of<00:02:46.160> the<00:02:46.250> original<00:02:46.640> battery<00:02:46.820> and<00:02:47.150> a

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
here out of the original battery and a

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.630 
here out of the original battery and a
negative<00:02:47.900> coming<00:02:48.200> here<00:02:48.440> that<00:02:49.340> would<00:02:49.490> mean

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
negative coming here that would mean

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.640 
negative coming here that would mean
that<00:02:49.700> we<00:02:49.910> want<00:02:50.150> this<00:02:50.360> coming<00:02:50.690> out<00:02:50.840> should<00:02:51.590> be

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
that we want this coming out should be

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.380 
that we want this coming out should be
the<00:02:51.770> positive<00:02:51.950> it's<00:02:52.910> going<00:02:53.060> to<00:02:53.120> go<00:02:53.210> through

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
the positive it's going to go through

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.080 
the positive it's going to go through
here<00:02:53.600> and<00:02:53.690> eventually<00:02:54.110> come<00:02:54.260> out<00:02:54.380> a<00:02:54.620> negative

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
here and eventually come out a negative

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.370 
here and eventually come out a negative
the<00:02:56.090> negative<00:02:56.120> we're<00:02:56.690> going<00:02:56.810> to<00:02:56.870> want<00:02:57.050> to<00:02:57.140> go

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
the negative we're going to want to go

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.650 
the negative we're going to want to go
over<00:02:57.740> and<00:02:57.980> meet<00:02:58.550> up<00:02:58.700> with<00:02:58.730> a<00:02:58.880> positive<00:02:59.150> on<00:02:59.540> the

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
over and meet up with a positive on the

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.300 
over and meet up with a positive on the
other<00:02:59.780> end<00:03:00.020> that<00:03:00.440> way<00:03:00.620> it's<00:03:00.800> acting<00:03:01.160> like

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
other end that way it's acting like

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.820 
other end that way it's acting like
another<00:03:01.660> just<00:03:02.660> like<00:03:02.750> another<00:03:03.080> cell<00:03:03.440> in<00:03:03.680> the

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
another just like another cell in the

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:05.980 
another just like another cell in the
actual<00:03:04.040> battery<00:03:04.280> pack<00:03:04.670> it's<00:03:05.660> going<00:03:05.810> to<00:03:05.870> go

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:05.990 
actual battery pack it's going to go

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:07.180 
actual battery pack it's going to go
over<00:03:06.020> it's<00:03:06.440> going<00:03:06.590> to<00:03:06.650> go<00:03:06.800> through<00:03:06.950> the<00:03:07.010> whole

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
over it's going to go through the whole

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.370 
over it's going to go through the whole
circuit<00:03:07.720> come<00:03:08.720> through<00:03:08.990> and<00:03:09.110> come<00:03:09.230> out<00:03:09.350> a

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.380 
circuit come through and come out a

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.170 
circuit come through and come out a
negative<00:03:09.650> like<00:03:10.040> normal<00:03:10.430> and<00:03:10.580> then<00:03:10.940> come<00:03:11.090> out

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
negative like normal and then come out

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.350 
negative like normal and then come out
as<00:03:11.330> a<00:03:11.360> negative<00:03:11.630> on<00:03:11.990> the<00:03:12.410> actual<00:03:12.650> connector<00:03:13.360> so

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
as a negative on the actual connector so

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.380 
as a negative on the actual connector so
everything<00:03:14.750> looks<00:03:14.780> good<00:03:15.110> here<00:03:15.170> and<00:03:16.390> we're

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
everything looks good here and we're

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:19.470 
everything looks good here and we're
going<00:03:17.480> to<00:03:17.570> go<00:03:17.690> ahead<00:03:17.750> and<00:03:17.870> heat<00:03:18.110> shrink<00:03:18.410> this

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
going to go ahead and heat shrink this

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.560 
going to go ahead and heat shrink this
if<00:03:20.480> we<00:03:20.570> can<00:03:20.750> get<00:03:20.810> this<00:03:20.960> heat<00:03:21.200> shrink<00:03:21.470> over<00:03:21.590> the

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.570 
if we can get this heat shrink over the

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:35.580 
if we can get this heat shrink over the
wire

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.200 

it's<00:03:36.250> got<00:03:36.459> it

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:39.210 

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:41.730 

ok

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:41.740 
ok

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:46.300 
ok
cut<00:03:42.340> this<00:03:42.580> farm

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.970 

I'll<00:03:46.790> get<00:03:46.940> the<00:03:47.000> other<00:03:47.239> one<00:03:47.420> too<00:03:47.680> so<00:03:48.680> we<00:03:48.739> can<00:03:48.890> do

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
I'll get the other one too so we can do

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.900 
I'll get the other one too so we can do
that<00:03:49.130> one<00:03:49.280> at<00:03:49.370> same<00:03:49.640> time

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:53.610 

you<00:03:52.510> want<00:03:52.690> to<00:03:52.780> give<00:03:52.930> them<00:03:52.990> as<00:03:53.080> flush<00:03:53.380> with<00:03:53.590> the

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
you want to give them as flush with the

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.060 
you want to give them as flush with the
actual<00:03:53.890> connector<00:03:54.370> as<00:03:54.460> you<00:03:54.580> can<00:03:54.820> sometimes

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.070 
actual connector as you can sometimes

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:59.340 
actual connector as you can sometimes
you<00:03:57.070> can't<00:03:57.370> and<00:03:57.750> you<00:03:58.750> know<00:03:58.810> you<00:03:58.930> can't<00:03:59.230> really

00:03:59.340 --> 00:03:59.350 
you can't and you know you can't really

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:01.620 
you can't and you know you can't really
help<00:03:59.560> that<00:03:59.680> other<00:04:00.460> than<00:04:00.880> if<00:04:01.090> you<00:04:01.210> wanted<00:04:01.510> to

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:01.630 
help that other than if you wanted to

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:03.300 
help that other than if you wanted to
resolder<00:04:01.990> and<00:04:02.290> try<00:04:02.470> a<00:04:02.500> few<00:04:02.800> different<00:04:02.860> times

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
resolder and try a few different times

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.390 
resolder and try a few different times
and<00:04:03.720> you<00:04:04.720> could<00:04:05.010> otherwise<00:04:06.010> you<00:04:06.220> can<00:04:06.370> just

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
and you could otherwise you can just

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:11.070 
and you could otherwise you can just
deal<00:04:06.730> with<00:04:06.910> it<00:04:09.720> so<00:04:10.720> right<00:04:10.840> now<00:04:10.870> i'm<00:04:11.020> using

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:11.080 
deal with it so right now i'm using

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.840 
deal with it so right now i'm using
matches<00:04:11.710> i<00:04:11.830> would<00:04:12.010> normally<00:04:12.190> use<00:04:12.430> a<00:04:12.520> lighter

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:12.850 
matches i would normally use a lighter

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:15.660 
matches i would normally use a lighter
but<00:04:13.680> you<00:04:14.680> don't<00:04:14.830> have<00:04:14.980> any<00:04:15.130> lighters<00:04:15.460> right

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:15.670 
but you don't have any lighters right

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:20.469 
but you don't have any lighters right
now

00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:20.479 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:27.350 

ok<00:04:21.479> so<00:04:21.540> with<00:04:22.079> the<00:04:22.169> match

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:36.040 

and<00:04:27.780> then

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.180 

your<00:04:36.620> goal<00:04:36.770> is<00:04:36.800> to<00:04:37.009> heat<00:04:37.280> up<00:04:37.310> until<00:04:37.729> it<00:04:37.819> shrinks

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:39.190 
your goal is to heat up until it shrinks

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:50.060 
your goal is to heat up until it shrinks
that's<00:04:40.190> not<00:04:40.430> right<00:04:40.460> version

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:50.070 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:53.230 

okay<00:04:50.760> so<00:04:51.150> that's<00:04:51.300> turned<00:04:51.540> out<00:04:51.660> all<00:04:51.810> right<00:04:51.840> now

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:53.240 
okay so that's turned out all right now

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.550 
okay so that's turned out all right now
we<00:04:54.240> got<00:04:54.360> to<00:04:54.540> do<00:04:54.630> the<00:04:54.750> other<00:04:54.900> connectors<00:04:55.410> as

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 
we got to do the other connectors as

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:23.200 
we got to do the other connectors as
well<00:04:56.270> once<00:04:57.270> again<00:04:57.390> into<00:04:57.990> two<00:04:58.170> at<00:04:58.320> a<00:04:58.350> time

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:23.210 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:25.540 

okay<00:05:23.780> now<00:05:24.410> it<00:05:24.530> turned<00:05:24.710> out<00:05:24.800> a<00:05:24.860> lot<00:05:24.949> better<00:05:25.069> I

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:25.550 
okay now it turned out a lot better I

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:28.420 
okay now it turned out a lot better I
guess<00:05:25.940> otters<00:05:26.479> are<00:05:26.660> probably<00:05:26.960> a<00:05:27.590> little<00:05:28.280> bit

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:28.430 
guess otters are probably a little bit

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:29.950 
guess otters are probably a little bit
smaller<00:05:28.729> so<00:05:28.819> we<00:05:29.030> could<00:05:29.180> actually<00:05:29.210> get<00:05:29.539> it<00:05:29.660> over

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:29.960 
smaller so we could actually get it over

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:33.939 
smaller so we could actually get it over
it<00:05:31.509> and<00:05:32.509> then<00:05:32.690> I<00:05:32.720> last<00:05:33.050> one<00:05:33.319> we're<00:05:33.620> going<00:05:33.710> to<00:05:33.830> do

00:05:33.939 --> 00:05:33.949 
it and then I last one we're going to do

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:37.420 
it and then I last one we're going to do
same<00:05:34.370> exact<00:05:34.699> thing<00:05:35.740> put<00:05:36.740> them<00:05:36.889> over<00:05:37.009> the<00:05:37.220> best

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:37.430 
same exact thing put them over the best

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:57.550 
same exact thing put them over the best
weekend

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:57.560 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:02.379 

okay<00:05:59.050> so<00:06:00.050> it<00:06:00.169> looks<00:06:00.200> like<00:06:00.410> before<00:06:01.240> I'm<00:06:02.240> going

00:06:02.379 --> 00:06:02.389 
okay so it looks like before I'm going

00:06:02.389 --> 00:06:14.620 
okay so it looks like before I'm going
to<00:06:02.450> actually<00:06:02.600> heat<00:06:02.900> shrink<00:06:03.169> it<00:06:07.210> and<00:06:08.210> like<00:06:08.660> this

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:14.630 

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:21.090 

because<00:06:15.170> over<00:06:16.010> the<00:06:16.040> fire

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:21.100 

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:25.860 

ok

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:25.870 

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:29.130 

and<00:06:25.960> here's<00:06:26.920> what<00:06:27.190> we<00:06:27.310> have<00:06:27.460> in<00:06:27.640> the<00:06:27.790> end<00:06:28.140> we

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:29.140 
and here's what we have in the end we

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:32.040 
and here's what we have in the end we
have<00:06:29.260> a<00:06:29.320> connector<00:06:29.830> that<00:06:30.070> well<00:06:30.750> you<00:06:31.750> can<00:06:31.930> hook

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:32.050 
have a connector that well you can hook

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:33.690 
have a connector that well you can hook
up<00:06:32.230> to<00:06:32.380> different<00:06:32.560> battery<00:06:32.980> packs<00:06:33.220> for<00:06:33.460> it<00:06:33.550> so

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:33.700 
up to different battery packs for it so

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:34.710 
up to different battery packs for it so
you<00:06:33.790> don't<00:06:33.820> have<00:06:34.090> to<00:06:34.240> worry<00:06:34.390> about<00:06:34.510> your

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:34.720 
you don't have to worry about your

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:36.420 
you don't have to worry about your
charger<00:06:35.140> not<00:06:35.320> being<00:06:35.560> able<00:06:35.680> to<00:06:35.800> handle<00:06:36.220> one

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:36.430 
charger not being able to handle one

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:39.720 
charger not being able to handle one
battery<00:06:36.790> pack<00:06:37.080> say<00:06:38.080> you<00:06:38.140> wanted<00:06:38.560> in<00:06:39.340> this<00:06:39.490> case

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:39.730 
battery pack say you wanted in this case

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:41.460 
battery pack say you wanted in this case
I'm<00:06:40.000> running<00:06:40.270> 26<00:06:40.750> cells<00:06:40.990> off<00:06:41.230> of<00:06:41.380> this

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:41.470 
I'm running 26 cells off of this

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:43.440 
I'm running 26 cells off of this
connector<00:06:41.950> my<00:06:42.370> charger<00:06:42.850> can<00:06:42.970> only<00:06:43.120> do<00:06:43.330> up<00:06:43.390> to

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:43.450 
connector my charger can only do up to

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:45.750 
connector my charger can only do up to
eight<00:06:43.660> cell<00:06:43.960> packs<00:06:44.260> so<00:06:45.070> that<00:06:45.220> works<00:06:45.430> out<00:06:45.550> good

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:45.760 
eight cell packs so that works out good

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:47.760 
eight cell packs so that works out good
so<00:06:45.970> I<00:06:46.030> think<00:06:46.240> this<00:06:46.300> disconnect<00:06:46.900> each<00:06:47.080> pack<00:06:47.470> and

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:47.770 
so I think this disconnect each pack and

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:51.090 
so I think this disconnect each pack and
then<00:06:48.760> charge<00:06:49.690> them<00:06:49.870> up<00:06:49.960> individually<00:06:50.140> come<00:06:50.980> up

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:51.100 
then charge them up individually come up

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:53.610 
then charge them up individually come up
to<00:06:51.250> here<00:06:51.490> and<00:06:51.610> it<00:06:51.670> will<00:06:51.700> come<00:06:51.910> out<00:06:51.970> as<00:06:52.620> 14.4

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:53.620 
to here and it will come out as 14.4

00:06:53.620 --> 00:07:00.060 
to here and it will come out as 14.4
volt<00:06:56.070> 7.2<00:06:57.070> 7.2<00:06:58.050> volts<00:06:59.050> per<00:06:59.320> pack<00:06:59.560> that's<00:06:59.800> for<00:07:00.040> a

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:00.070 
volt 7.2 7.2 volts per pack that's for a

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:03.180 
volt 7.2 7.2 volts per pack that's for a
6-cell<00:07:00.520> pack<00:07:00.760> and<00:07:01.110> so<00:07:02.110> in<00:07:02.410> the<00:07:02.770> end<00:07:02.890> it<00:07:03.100> will

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:03.190 
6-cell pack and so in the end it will

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:06.420 
6-cell pack and so in the end it will
come<00:07:03.340> out<00:07:03.460> as<00:07:03.640> 14.4<00:07:04.600> volt<00:07:04.920> to<00:07:05.920> what<00:07:06.220> I<00:07:06.250> am

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:06.430 
come out as 14.4 volt to what I am
