00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:24.319
 my passion leave you hero for 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:26.079
 case why 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:29.389
 our friends gave us 

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:32.180
 little barn owl which examples it is 

00:02:29.389 --> 00:02:33.889
 was our first animal 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.439
 let's say that when the small o 

00:02:33.889 --> 00:02:40.719
 surfaces to train it up to 

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:45.709
 get to a super imprinting venting e 

00:02:40.719 --> 00:02:46.969
 let's say the affection between man and bird of prey yes 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:49.579
 must give them the imprint is 

00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:52.280
 I practically go through it manually 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:53.989
 then feed it manually for 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.810
 to be able to bring them closer together 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:03:05.590
 you can then become theirs 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:09.049
 mom their patina anna that practically 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:10.370
 They are rubbed with the spout their compartment 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:11.689
 to a gland 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.719
 there is that within this range 

00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:17.030
 liquid fat bottom in fact us 

00:03:14.719 --> 00:03:19.810
 when we are the squares we try to do 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.810
 touch as little as possible 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:29.459
 logically we have every day 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:32.340
 however for the compact of pampering i 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:33.140
 our animals by force however towards the 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.330
 people 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:38.520
 we must try to make them understand the 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:43.800
 because they don't come they must be touched 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:47.900
 because anyway than I would like 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:51.660
 become an hourly barrel of birds of prey 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:55.200
 specializing in tunes you know diseases 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:58.640
 which partners to then open a center of 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.640
 recovery of peace
