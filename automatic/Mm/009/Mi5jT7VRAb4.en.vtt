00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.020 
most of those people that are playing
it's<00:02:13.019> still<00:02:13.230> on<00:02:13.319> single<00:02:13.650> core<00:02:13.860> no<00:02:14.129> that's<00:02:14.940> a

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
it's still on single core no that's a

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.490 
it's still on single core no that's a
shame<00:02:15.239> but<00:02:15.480> even<00:02:15.720> the<00:02:15.840> even<00:02:15.870> the<00:02:16.200> folks<00:02:16.379> that
