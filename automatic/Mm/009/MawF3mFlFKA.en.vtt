00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:33.340
 prepare a delicious delicious brownie

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:38.940
 chocolate let's see what ingredients 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:41.290
 we are going to need me here I have 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.790
 melted to bain- marie very carefully 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:46.980
 200 grams of bitter chocolate 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:49.670
 that I have let it temper a bit 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.950
 so that it is not completely hot 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:55.380
 I also have some chocolate nuggets 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:58.440
 two or three teaspoons of coffee well 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:01.199
 strong if they have expressed better 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.920
 one heaping tablespoon cocoa 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.920
 cake shop 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.690
 a quarter teaspoon of salt 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.979
 three whole eggs 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.640
 150 grams butter butter 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:15.640
 melted 

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:24.170
 150 grams of sugar 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:26.840
 100 of common flour without leavening and 120 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:29.720
 grams of chopped nuts we're also going to 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:33.290
 use a few droplets of essence of 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:35.780
 vanilla the first thing we're going to do is 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:38.140
 put to preheat the oven to 170 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.140
 degrees 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:44.450
 the second thing we are going to do is prepare 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.430
 the mold in my channel can find in 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.130
 the blondie recipe here I leave the 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:51.110
 link how to prepare it I repeat it a 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:54.380
 Once again here I have a brush 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:57.930
 vegetable oil and we will place then 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:00.090
 a butter paper 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.460
 and thanks to the oil is going to adhere to 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.740
 the walls of the mold 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.060
 and then here we are going to pour the 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.190
 preparation 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.220
 when we are going to demand this, it is going to be 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.480
 really very simple you are going to see it 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.180
 now let's start with the 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.850
 preparation and I give you a data for me a 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.850
 Brownie is not the same as a cake or 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:24.420
 a cake cut into pieces a brownie 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:26.580
 it should not be fluffy it should be from a 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.860
 consistency I would say a little chewy 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.750
 that when you look at it it looks as if the 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.880
 preparation was still raw though 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.830
 it is not and I promise you that in this 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.380
 recipe if you follow the steps that I'm going to 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.959
 give then that is exactly what 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:42.390
 what are they going to achieve to achieve that? 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:44.580
 first to pour in a deep bowl as 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.100
 always like I like to work for me 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:49.530
 three eggs 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:52.230
 and the sugar 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:57.080
 but we're not going to beat them we're going 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:03:00.910
 only to integrate that is to say mix 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:03.340
 without too much movement 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:07.840
 because we do not want it to be a 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:11.020
 Fluffy preparation is enough 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:13.030
 now let's add the butter 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:15.630
 melted very important that is 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.630
 melted 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:21.430
 the chocolate 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:30.569
 we mix without beating 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:33.590
 and now we are going to add 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:37.260
 the cocoa powder that will intensify 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:39.329
 the taste of chocolate like the 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:42.659
 coffee remember that in the preparations 

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:45.239
 with chocolate the touch of coffee serves 

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:48.150
 to give you even more chocolate taste 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:51.860
 strong will not please the house coffee 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:56.020
 do not be afraid we mix 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:56.020
 do not forget about the teaspoon of salt 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.569
 a few drops of essence of 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.569
 vanilla 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.950
 the chopped nuts 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:08.830
 if someone wants to make this recipe and it is 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:11.950
 allergic to nuts can leave you not 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:14.440
 there is a problem and finally we are going to 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:16.359
 add the only dry ingredient that is 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:19.329
 the flour 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:22.310
 and mix 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:24.710
 until everything is well incorporated 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:26.900
 here I have already the preparation well 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:29.210
 integrated that is to say we no longer see flour 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:32.770
 loose out there and as you can see 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:35.690
 it's a pretty liquid mixture and well 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:38.230
 chocolatosa now we are going to place it in 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:38.230
 mold 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:56.370
 let's distribute the mixture in the mold 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:58.710
 as neatly as possible so that 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:00.720
 the cooking is even in all the 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:02.550
 branding and is not higher on one side 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.570
 what of the other 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:08.670
 and to give it a little touch even more 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:12.110
 chocolatoso let's throw it over 

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:12.110
 some chocolate nuggets 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:17.650
 as I said at the beginning this brownie 

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.650
 it's for chocolate lovers 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:25.060
 the brownie is ready to take it 

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:25.060
 baked exactly 30 minutes 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:32.360
 the braille I had exactly 20 minutes 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:34.849
 in the oven and now it's very detail 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:37.400
 important, we're not going to let it cool 

00:05:34.849 --> 00:05:39.889
 in the mold as well as the blog either 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:41.419
 so that we do not continue cooking we are going to 

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:45.349
 move with the help of paper 

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:47.199
 directly to a grid and here yes what 

00:05:45.349 --> 00:05:51.470
 let's cool completely 

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:53.840
 before cutting the brownie it's already cold 

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:56.599
 and I'm going to cut it in squares to 

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:58.159
 then put them in a font I will measure 

00:05:56.599 --> 00:06:01.370
 more or less the size of the portions 

00:05:58.159 --> 00:06:02.920
 that I want we are going to cut first by the 

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:05.740
 half 

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:08.860
 along 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:11.020
 and then each half again for the 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:15.730
 half 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:15.730
 to then cut the squares 

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:29.250
 I have already finished cutting all the 

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:31.110
 brownie and place it in a fountain and 

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:33.990
 Here I want to show you so that you can see 

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:36.090
 how is it inside well wet with 

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:39.030
 the nut pieces and the nuggets 

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:42.270
