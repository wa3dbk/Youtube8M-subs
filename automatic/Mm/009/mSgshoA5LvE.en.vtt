with the new ones right here and
hopefully<00:01:30.900> I<00:01:31.200> get<00:01:31.470> a<00:01:31.650> better<00:01:31.829> quality<00:01:32.040> and

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
hopefully I get a better quality and

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.800 
hopefully I get a better quality and
and<00:01:33.290> my<00:01:33.710> brakes<00:01:34.040> my<00:01:34.729> emergency<00:01:34.970> brakes<00:01:35.390> the

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
and my brakes my emergency brakes the

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.810 
and my brakes my emergency brakes the
rest<00:01:35.990> of<00:01:36.110> these<00:01:36.200> are<00:01:36.260> mainly<00:01:36.530> for<00:01:36.860> is<00:01:37.640> the

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
rest of these are mainly for is the

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:39.390 
rest of these are mainly for is the
mainly<00:01:38.090> for<00:01:38.210> the<00:01:38.270> emergency<00:01:38.659> brakes<00:01:38.930> and

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:39.400 
mainly for the emergency brakes and

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.620 
mainly for the emergency brakes and
sometimes<00:01:40.400> we're<00:01:40.640> going<00:01:40.670> too<00:01:40.970> fast<00:01:41.180> you<00:01:41.420> can

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
sometimes we're going too fast you can

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.240 
sometimes we're going too fast you can
step<00:01:41.990> you<00:01:42.229> can<00:01:42.380> use<00:01:42.500> the<00:01:42.650> emergency<00:01:42.950> brake<00:01:43.159> to

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
step you can use the emergency brake to

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.640 
step you can use the emergency brake to
slow<00:01:43.369> yourself<00:01:43.520> down<00:01:43.790> as<00:01:44.380> opposed<00:01:45.380> to<00:01:45.470> use

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:45.650 
slow yourself down as opposed to use

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:47.980 
slow yourself down as opposed to use
them<00:01:45.830> only<00:01:46.610> then<00:01:47.030> you<00:01:47.090> know<00:01:47.210> the<00:01:47.390> regular

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
them only then you know the regular

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.300 
them only then you know the regular
brake<00:01:48.200> brakes<00:01:48.860> brake<00:01:49.670> pedal<00:01:50.000> what<00:01:50.420> not<00:01:50.630> and

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
brake brakes brake pedal what not and

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:57.540 
brake brakes brake pedal what not and
and<00:01:52.540> mostly<00:01:53.540> our<00:01:53.750> cars<00:01:54.050> is<00:01:54.380> is<00:01:54.830> usually<00:01:55.340> 70/30

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:57.550 
and mostly our cars is is usually 70/30

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.770 
and mostly our cars is is usually 70/30
that's<00:01:58.550> how<00:01:58.700> the<00:01:58.759> brakes<00:01:59.060> is<00:01:59.210> divided<00:01:59.720> you

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
that's how the brakes is divided you

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.330 
that's how the brakes is divided you
have<00:01:59.900> 70<00:02:00.490> 70<00:02:01.490> more<00:02:01.909> percentage<00:02:02.690> of<00:02:02.960> great<00:02:03.380> use
