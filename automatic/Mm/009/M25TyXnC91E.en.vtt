 wow suor cristina sang I would like a 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.390
 quick opinion from the coach 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:09.720
 hair tate require first part 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.290
 we felt very soulful 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.310
 simplification we have also heard 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.380
 of the gospel 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:17.320
 how did the performance of Sister seem to you? 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:19.870
 cristina a beautiful exhibition i 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.610
 I want to say something you are the 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.890
 most controversial character of the voice 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:26.710
 there is that I love you so much that you 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:28.990
 love yours personally less 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:31.360
 I've always thought about it a lot and 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:34.780
 I think something to understand football at 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:39.220
 beyond the extra but little issues 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:41.110
 almost and I can tell you something that 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.570
 may have the thing go on ever 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:45.160
 straight cared why not 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:51.280
 show is so cool 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:53.230
 good clear blue 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.720
 which at one point I do from one 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:59.280
 beaten a bit to soften I get now 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.280
 he asks us eight for a thousand 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:13.660
 would have been in my opinion 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:16.739
 in short , calabria is an opinion 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:19.359
 you also rightly look at noemi is 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:22.000
 its presence in the voice is controversial 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:24.940
 but if the people who are honest are 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:29.310
 they criticize they hear that he sang in 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:31.930
 divine way he understood thanks 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:34.240
 the great performance by Sister 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:37.030
 cristina who for the first time in the 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:39.400
 competition measured itself with one 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:41.470

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.750

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:49.740

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:51.120
 that we absolutely had to do it 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.560
 I have only sung in English so far 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:55.830

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:07.590
 this exhibition is so true 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:11.190

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:13.980
 internet something then is the first time 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:16.290

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:18.360
 that we hear cristina singing in 

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:20.010
 Italian and the feeling of people too 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.490
 at home as my parents have already mentioned 

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:22.410
 Colleagues 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:24.600
 also this week we had to 

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:26.670
 having to do with the usual col 

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:28.530
 usual group of haters that I am 

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:30.810
 convinced that the liking of cristina 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:33.000
 depends exclusively on the dress but 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:34.740
 they are the same ones who think that to do 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.420
 rock need tight pants 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:38.580
 tight with the straits you owe yourself 

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:44.400
 see where the notes come from understands 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:46.740
 so they are tight-minded 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.480
 here gave him more than his own 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:49.980
 litmus test gave him the proof of 

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:55.350
 90 fear 

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:58.460
 and then I more than I have to thank here 

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:58.460
 who gave us this performance 

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:08.400

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:09.960

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:13.610

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:13.610

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:21.479
 it always escapes me in name even if not 

00:06:19.949 --> 00:06:23.759
 looks like a slip of the tongue 

00:06:21.479 --> 00:06:26.039
 if someone then says it and gianni who has 

00:06:23.759 --> 00:06:27.690

00:06:26.039 --> 00:06:29.460
