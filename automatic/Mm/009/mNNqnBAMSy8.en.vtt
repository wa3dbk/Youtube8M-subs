00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
of the engine that's what we're working

after that we sprayed the first coat of
rubberized<00:01:54.909> coating<00:01:55.859> basically<00:01:56.859> to<00:01:57.390> prevent

rubberized coating basically to prevent

dust and burden choose you from getting

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.090 
dust and burden choose you from getting
into<00:02:01.180> the<00:02:01.390> engines<00:02:01.780> and<00:02:02.049> trying<00:02:02.740> to<00:02:02.859> keep<00:02:02.950> them

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
into the engines and trying to keep them

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.080 
into the engines and trying to keep them
as<00:02:03.340> clean<00:02:04.000> as<00:02:04.149> possible

most<00:02:07.090> people<00:02:07.359> think<00:02:07.539> we<00:02:07.630> store<00:02:07.930> aircraft<00:02:08.590> just

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
most people think we store aircraft just

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:10.830 
most people think we store aircraft just
to<00:02:09.130> get<00:02:09.280> rid<00:02:09.429> of<00:02:09.459> them<00:02:09.609> later<00:02:09.820> but<00:02:10.479> a<00:02:10.539> large

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
to get rid of them later but a large

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.660 
to get rid of them later but a large
number<00:02:10.929> of<00:02:11.230> the<00:02:11.350> aircraft<00:02:11.769> go<00:02:12.070> through<00:02:12.430> what's

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
number of the aircraft go through what's

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.060 
number of the aircraft go through what's
called<00:02:12.760> regeneration<00:02:13.690> where<00:02:14.470> we<00:02:14.650> will<00:02:14.799> take

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070 
called regeneration where we will take

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:16.800 
called regeneration where we will take
them<00:02:15.340> and<00:02:15.549> we<00:02:15.640> will<00:02:15.790> return<00:02:16.180> them<00:02:16.420> the<00:02:16.540> flyable

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
them and we will return them the flyable

69<00:02:35.549> you're<00:02:36.549> rebuilding<00:02:37.030> the<00:02:37.299> aircraft<00:02:37.720> that

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
69 you're rebuilding the aircraft that

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:40.860 
69 you're rebuilding the aircraft that
was<00:02:38.170> that<00:02:38.620> was<00:02:38.799> made<00:02:39.359> almost<00:02:40.359> 40<00:02:40.630> years<00:02:40.660> ago

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
was that was made almost 40 years ago

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.069 
was that was made almost 40 years ago
and<00:02:41.290> had<00:02:41.859> spent<00:02:42.190> the<00:02:42.370> last<00:02:42.549> 20<00:02:42.940> years<00:02:43.079> sitting

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:44.079 
and had spent the last 20 years sitting

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:46.229 
and had spent the last 20 years sitting
in<00:02:44.170> the<00:02:44.260> desert<00:02:44.620> in<00:02:44.769> storage<00:02:45.220> so<00:02:45.880> it's<00:02:46.150> a

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
in the desert in storage so it's a

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:48.059 
in the desert in storage so it's a

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:48.069 
tremendous task to take that airplane

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:50.909 
tremendous task to take that airplane
out<00:02:48.880> of<00:02:49.030> the<00:02:49.120> desert<00:02:49.329> rebuild<00:02:50.320> it<00:02:50.500> and<00:02:50.650> then

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:50.919 
out of the desert rebuild it and then

00:02:50.919 --> 00:02:52.759 
out of the desert rebuild it and then
get<00:02:51.070> it<00:02:51.190> back<00:02:51.220> in<00:02:51.489> the<00:02:51.579> flying<00:02:51.850> shape

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
get it back in the flying shape

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:55.709 
get it back in the flying shape
at<00:02:53.769> least<00:02:53.980> 40%<00:02:54.370> of<00:02:54.760> what<00:02:54.939> we<00:02:55.090> used<00:02:55.599> to

have tons of great parts out here and
know<00:03:15.819> something<00:03:16.150> let<00:03:16.299> them<00:03:16.389> go<00:03:16.510> to<00:03:16.569> waste<00:03:16.810> so

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
know something let them go to waste so

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.179 
know something let them go to waste so
90%<00:03:18.760> of<00:03:19.060> the<00:03:19.150> stuff<00:03:19.359> we<00:03:19.480> pull<00:03:19.750> is<00:03:20.260> just<00:03:20.889> as<00:03:21.040> good

00:03:21.179 --> 00:03:21.189 
90% of the stuff we pull is just as good

90% of the stuff we pull is just as good
as<00:03:21.340> anything<00:03:21.579> as<00:03:21.849> a<00:03:21.879> brand<00:03:22.239> new<00:03:22.389> part<00:03:22.599> it's

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
as anything as a brand new part it's

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.500 
as anything as a brand new part it's
just<00:03:23.409> dirty<00:03:23.639> there's<00:03:24.639> very<00:03:24.879> few<00:03:24.939> parts<00:03:25.419> that

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
just dirty there's very few parts that

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.209 
just dirty there's very few parts that
I've<00:03:25.780> pulled<00:03:26.079> since<00:03:26.769> I've<00:03:26.919> been<00:03:27.040> out<00:03:27.189> here

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:27.219 
I've pulled since I've been out here

00:03:27.219 --> 00:03:30.390 
I've pulled since I've been out here
that<00:03:27.639> were<00:03:28.180> deemed<00:03:28.419> bad<00:03:28.719> there<00:03:29.709> is<00:03:29.859> a<00:03:29.889> savings

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
that were deemed bad there is a savings

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.189 
that were deemed bad there is a savings
of<00:03:30.489> dollars<00:03:30.879> when<00:03:31.060> we<00:03:31.209> reclaim<00:03:31.599> parts<00:03:31.959> from

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:32.199 
of dollars when we reclaim parts from

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:33.899 
of dollars when we reclaim parts from
here<00:03:32.469> at<00:03:32.590> the<00:03:32.680> boneyard<00:03:32.889> but<00:03:33.519> that's<00:03:33.699> not

00:03:33.899 --> 00:03:33.909 
here at the boneyard but that's not

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:36.270 
here at the boneyard but that's not
actually<00:03:34.150> the<00:03:34.599> biggest<00:03:34.959> benefit<00:03:35.469> the<00:03:35.980> biggest

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
actually the biggest benefit the biggest

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.949 
actually the biggest benefit the biggest
benefit<00:03:36.669> is<00:03:36.699> the<00:03:36.939> largest<00:03:37.329> number<00:03:37.599> of<00:03:37.689> parts

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 
benefit is the largest number of parts

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:42.059 
benefit is the largest number of parts
we<00:03:38.079> reclaim<00:03:38.549> cannot<00:03:39.549> be<00:03:39.909> bought<00:03:41.069> and

00:03:42.059 --> 00:03:42.069 
we reclaim cannot be bought and

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:44.339 
we reclaim cannot be bought and
therefore<00:03:42.730> if<00:03:43.000> without<00:03:43.449> the<00:03:43.840> parts<00:03:44.109> that<00:03:44.169> we

00:03:44.339 --> 00:03:44.349 
therefore if without the parts that we

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:45.809 
therefore if without the parts that we
were<00:03:44.439> claiming<00:03:44.739> at<00:03:44.829> the<00:03:44.889> boneyard<00:03:45.069> we'd<00:03:45.579> stop

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:45.819 
were claiming at the boneyard we'd stop

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:48.089 
were claiming at the boneyard we'd stop
flying<00:03:46.120> so<00:03:46.840> it's<00:03:47.049> not<00:03:47.230> as<00:03:47.439> much<00:03:47.620> about<00:03:47.650> money

00:03:48.089 --> 00:03:48.099 
flying so it's not as much about money

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:50.339 
flying so it's not as much about money
it's<00:03:48.459> about<00:03:48.579> mission<00:03:49.269> and<00:03:49.449> the<00:03:49.900> mission<00:03:49.930> would

00:03:50.339 --> 00:03:50.349 
it's about mission and the mission would

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:52.050 
it's about mission and the mission would
stop<00:03:50.680> if<00:03:50.949> we<00:03:51.129> stopped<00:03:51.370> for<00:03:51.519> cleaning<00:03:51.819> parts

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
stop if we stopped for cleaning parts

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.679 
stop if we stopped for cleaning parts
for<00:03:52.239> them<00:03:53.459> for<00:03:54.459> the<00:03:54.579> most<00:03:54.760> part<00:03:55.090> we<00:03:55.209> just<00:03:55.239> we

00:03:55.679 --> 00:03:55.689 
for them for the most part we just we

00:03:55.689 --> 00:03:57.809 
for them for the most part we just we
just<00:03:55.840> pull<00:03:56.319> parts<00:03:56.650> and<00:03:56.859> send<00:03:57.189> them<00:03:57.280> in<00:03:57.400> all<00:03:57.609> day

00:03:57.809 --> 00:03:57.819 
just pull parts and send them in all day

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:01.740 
just pull parts and send them in all day
you<00:03:58.689> know<00:03:58.780> one<00:03:58.930> after<00:03:59.109> another<00:04:00.540> it's<00:04:01.540> a<00:04:01.569> great

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
you know one after another it's a great

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:11.480 
you know one after another it's a great
job

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:11.490 

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:14.040 

so<00:04:12.490> a<00:04:12.520> lot<00:04:12.940> of<00:04:13.060> different<00:04:13.360> things<00:04:13.480> occur<00:04:13.870> here

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:14.050 
so a lot of different things occur here

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:15.600 
so a lot of different things occur here
all<00:04:14.170> the<00:04:14.260> time<00:04:14.290> we<00:04:14.680> also<00:04:14.890> do<00:04:15.160> a<00:04:15.190> little<00:04:15.370> bit<00:04:15.520> of

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:15.610 
all the time we also do a little bit of

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:18.330
