definitely something a little bit
different<00:00:30.180> and<00:00:30.270> we're<00:00:30.419> gonna<00:00:30.509> play<00:00:30.779> the

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:31.520 
different and we're gonna play the

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.180 
different and we're gonna play the
entire<00:00:32.520> 50<00:00:33.270> levels<00:00:33.960> and<00:00:34.290> really<00:00:34.559> my<00:00:34.680> goal<00:00:34.920> is

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
entire 50 levels and really my goal is

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.660 
ahead we'll start this up we're just
gonna<00:01:32.880> go<00:01:33.030> pretty<00:01:33.210> fast<00:01:33.479> here<00:01:34.430> if<00:01:35.430> you<00:01:35.520> don't

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
gonna go pretty fast here if you don't

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.520 
gonna go pretty fast here if you don't
really<00:01:35.760> have<00:01:35.880> any<00:01:35.940> money<00:01:36.210> anyway<00:01:36.630> so<00:01:39.140> I<00:01:40.140> might

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
really have any money anyway so I might

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.109 
really have any money anyway so I might
have<00:01:40.830> to<00:01:41.070> put<00:01:41.190> one<00:01:41.340> more<00:01:41.369> right<00:01:41.700> there<00:01:41.909> and

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
have to put one more right there and

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.090 
have to put one more right there and
then<00:01:42.240> that<00:01:42.420> should<00:01:42.720> probably<00:01:43.049> get<00:01:43.710> us<00:01:43.860> through

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
then that should probably get us through

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.560 
then that should probably get us through
this<00:01:44.220> entire<00:01:44.549> level<00:01:44.760> this<00:01:44.970> would<00:01:45.150> be<00:01:45.240> a<00:01:45.270> quick

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
this entire level this would be a quick

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.300 
this entire level this would be a quick
video<00:01:45.720> but<00:01:46.409> don't<00:01:46.560> you<00:01:46.740> worry<00:01:46.920> there'll<00:01:47.280> be

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
video but don't you worry there'll be

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:53.470 
video but don't you worry there'll be
plenty<00:01:47.790> more<00:01:48.180> and<00:01:48.840> videos<00:01:49.229> after<00:01:49.920> this<00:01:49.950> one

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:53.480 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.850 

and<00:01:54.480> I<00:01:54.780> can<00:01:54.930> increase<00:01:55.050> the<00:01:55.260> rate<00:01:55.530> at<00:01:55.620> which<00:01:55.650> the

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
you can see here there's sort of a

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:13.980 
you can see here there's sort of a
couple<00:03:12.470> different<00:03:12.650> ways<00:03:12.860> we<00:03:13.100> can<00:03:13.250> go<00:03:13.459> here

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:13.990 
couple different ways we can go here

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:16.540 
couple different ways we can go here
this<00:03:14.990> one<00:03:15.200> down<00:03:15.350> here<00:03:15.410> allows<00:03:15.980> us<00:03:16.010> to<00:03:16.370> get

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:16.550 
this one down here allows us to get

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:19.750 
this one down here allows us to get
basically<00:03:17.180> these<00:03:17.390> two<00:03:18.490> options<00:03:19.490> here<00:03:19.640> and

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
basically these two options here and

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.760 
basically these two options here and
then<00:03:19.880> the<00:03:19.970> top<00:03:20.150> one<00:03:20.209> allows<00:03:20.930> us<00:03:21.110> a<00:03:21.380> lot<00:03:21.650> more

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:21.770 
then the top one allows us a lot more

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:23.080 
then the top one allows us a lot more
flexibility<00:03:22.310> so<00:03:22.400> I'm<00:03:22.550> going<00:03:22.700> to<00:03:22.760> go<00:03:22.820> ahead<00:03:22.940> and

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
flexibility so I'm going to go ahead and

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.750 
flexibility so I'm going to go ahead and
do<00:03:23.180> the<00:03:23.270> top<00:03:23.420> one<00:03:23.530> so<00:03:24.530> high<00:03:24.800> ground<00:03:25.070> new<00:03:25.310> Archer

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
do the top one so high ground new Archer

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.630 
do the top one so high ground new Archer
tower<00:03:26.300> increases<00:03:26.959> the<00:03:27.140> cartridge<00:03:28.100> free<00:03:28.340> range

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 
tower increases the cartridge free range

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.800 
tower increases the cartridge free range
that's<00:03:29.600> good<00:03:29.750> to<00:03:29.840> me<00:03:29.959> now<00:03:30.200> we<00:03:31.130> have<00:03:31.540> 70<00:03:32.540> stars

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
that's good to me now we have 70 stars

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.510 
that's good to me now we have 70 stars
and<00:03:33.230> we'll<00:03:33.410> be<00:03:33.500> ready<00:03:33.739> to<00:03:33.920> hit<00:03:34.130> next<00:03:35.060> level
