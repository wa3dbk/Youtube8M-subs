00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:32.990 
are not my kind of thing but I thought

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:34.630 
are not my kind of thing but I thought
they<00:03:33.170> looked<00:03:33.380> more<00:03:33.770> expensive<00:03:34.370> than<00:03:34.490> they

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640 
they looked more expensive than they

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:35.710 
they looked more expensive than they
were<00:03:34.700> I<00:03:34.820> think<00:03:35.090> there<00:03:35.209> are<00:03:35.240> about<00:03:35.480> eight

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.080 
were I think there are about eight
pounds<00:03:36.050> or<00:03:36.380> so<00:03:36.590> and<00:03:36.860> they<00:03:37.520> definitely<00:03:37.820> worked

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
pounds or so and they definitely worked

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:44.020 
pounds or so and they definitely worked

comfortable<00:04:06.770> they<00:04:06.980> were<00:04:07.040> quite<00:04:07.220> pricey<00:04:07.550> but

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
comfortable they were quite pricey but

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.729 
comfortable they were quite pricey but
definitely<00:04:08.660> worth<00:04:08.780> the<00:04:08.989> money<00:04:09.110> in<00:04:09.290> my<00:04:09.440> opinion

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:09.739
