shadow some classrooms see how I feel
about<00:04:40.680> it<00:04:41.130> see<00:04:41.490> if<00:04:41.610> I'm<00:04:41.729> ready<00:04:41.940> to<00:04:42.090> grow<00:04:42.300> up<00:04:42.360> I

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
about it see if I'm ready to grow up I

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.040 
about it see if I'm ready to grow up I
don't<00:04:43.440> know<00:04:43.560> I've<00:04:43.800> been<00:04:43.979> looking<00:04:44.280> at<00:04:44.400> programs

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.050 
don't know I've been looking at programs

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:47.450 
don't know I've been looking at programs
for<00:04:46.050> the<00:04:46.169> last<00:04:46.380> half<00:04:46.590> hour<00:04:46.740> on<00:04:46.979> the<00:04:47.070> internet

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 
for the last half hour on the internet

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.100 
for the last half hour on the internet
and<00:04:47.669> it's<00:04:47.940> depressing<00:04:48.479> because<00:04:48.690> I<00:04:48.780> might<00:04:48.990> have

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 
and it's depressing because I might have

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:50.860 
and it's depressing because I might have
to<00:04:49.169> go<00:04:49.320> take<00:04:49.530> chemistry<00:04:49.800> and<00:04:50.190> physics<00:04:50.580> again

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:50.870 
to go take chemistry and physics again

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.090 
to go take chemistry and physics again
because<00:04:51.870> they<00:04:52.020> you<00:04:52.380> know<00:04:52.410> want<00:04:52.710> you<00:04:52.830> to<00:04:52.919> teach

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.219 
because they you know want you to teach
more<00:04:53.370> than<00:04:53.520> just<00:04:53.699> biology<00:04:54.020> which<00:04:55.020> would<00:04:55.169> be

00:04:55.219 --> 00:04:55.229 
more than just biology which would be

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:57.439 
more than just biology which would be
cool<00:04:55.470> but<00:04:55.770> then<00:04:56.550> they<00:04:56.639> want<00:04:56.820> you<00:04:56.910> to<00:04:57.000> qualified

00:04:57.439 --> 00:04:57.449
