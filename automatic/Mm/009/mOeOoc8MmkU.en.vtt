changer in the XM tuner through their
bus<00:00:47.100> system<00:00:48.440> that's<00:00:49.440> how<00:00:49.620> they<00:00:49.770> do<00:00:49.829> it<00:00:49.980> with

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
bus system that's how they do it with

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.729 
bus system that's how they do it with
their<00:00:50.520> head<00:00:50.820> units<00:00:51.210> so<00:00:52.140> we're<00:00:52.440> going<00:00:52.530> to<00:00:52.620> go

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
their head units so we're going to go

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.950 
their head units so we're going to go
and<00:00:52.829> take<00:00:53.039> a<00:00:53.070> look<00:00:53.129> inside<00:00:53.370> em<00:00:53.789> on<00:00:54.059> how<00:00:54.780> this

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
and take a look inside em on how this

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:05.710 
and take a look inside em on how this
thing<00:00:55.140> operates

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.820 

okay<00:01:06.720> so<00:01:07.050> that's<00:01:07.320> my<00:01:07.440> 4<00:01:07.680> by<00:01:07.830> 3<00:01:07.940> screen<00:01:09.830> retrofit

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
okay so that's my 4 by 3 screen retrofit

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.050 
okay so that's my 4 by 3 screen retrofit
it's<00:01:11.250> got<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:12.350> wrong<00:01:13.350> colored<00:01:14.130> wood<00:01:14.640> trim<00:01:14.910> and

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
it's got the wrong colored wood trim and

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.190 
it's got the wrong colored wood trim and
that's<00:01:15.210> actually<00:01:15.390> coming<00:01:15.780> from<00:01:16.050> another

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
that's actually coming from another

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.120 
that's actually coming from another
board<00:01:16.800> member<00:01:18.229> so<00:01:19.229> I'll<00:01:19.410> install<00:01:19.740> that<00:01:19.920> once

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
board member so I'll install that once

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.700 
board member so I'll install that once
it<00:01:20.280> arrives<00:01:20.610> now<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.660> only<00:01:21.900> reason<00:01:22.200> why<00:01:22.350> went

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
it arrives now the only reason why went

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.790 
it arrives now the only reason why went
with<00:01:22.860> that<00:01:22.979> is<00:01:23.660> with<00:01:24.660> the<00:01:24.780> Pioneers<00:01:25.320> because<00:01:25.770> i

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:25.800 
with that is with the Pioneers because i

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.700 
with that is with the Pioneers because i
use<00:01:26.190> the<00:01:26.450> p<00:01:27.450> IE<00:01:27.570> electronics<00:01:28.560> I<00:01:28.920> bus<00:01:29.550> interface

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
use the p IE electronics I bus interface

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.070 
use the p IE electronics I bus interface
that<00:01:31.710> integrates<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.490> 12<00:01:32.790> disc<00:01:33.060> changer<00:01:33.660> and

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:34.080 
that integrates the 12 disc changer and

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:39.109 
that integrates the 12 disc changer and
the<00:01:34.410> XM<00:01:35.100> tuner<00:01:35.520> so<00:01:36.390> that<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:37.940> steering<00:01:38.940> wheels

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
the XM tuner so that the steering wheels

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.740 
the XM tuner so that the steering wheels
and<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.450> buttons<00:01:40.110> on<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.280> screen<00:01:41.399> are<00:01:42.030> still

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
and the buttons on the screen are still

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:50.510 
and the buttons on the screen are still
used<00:01:43.610> so<00:01:48.289> actually<00:01:49.289> have<00:01:49.680> this<00:01:49.830> on<00:01:50.009> XM<00:01:50.340> right

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
used so actually have this on XM right

00:01:50.520 --> 00:02:02.060 
used so actually have this on XM right
now<00:01:50.670> but<00:01:50.880> let's<00:01:51.030> just<00:01:51.119> switch<00:01:51.420> back<00:01:51.690> to<00:01:56.630> CD<00:02:01.070> so

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
now but let's just switch back to CD so

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.520 
now but let's just switch back to CD so
basically<00:02:02.460> it's<00:02:02.700> on<00:02:02.880> see<00:02:03.750> number<00:02:04.080> two<00:02:04.110> track

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
basically it's on see number two track

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.660 
basically it's on see number two track
number<00:02:04.830> eight<00:02:06.560> and<00:02:07.560> it's<00:02:08.250> still<00:02:08.459> all

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
number eight and it's still all

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:15.380 
number eight and it's still all
controlled<00:02:09.090> by<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.240> steering<00:02:09.569> wheels

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.309 

my<00:02:16.390> dead<00:02:16.599> pixels<00:02:17.220> okay

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:25.739 

now<00:02:21.010> the<00:02:21.069> only<00:02:22.290> drawback<00:02:23.290> is<00:02:23.469> that<00:02:24.749> there's

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:25.749 
now the only drawback is that there's

00:02:25.749 --> 00:02:28.709 
now the only drawback is that there's
only<00:02:25.900> six<00:02:26.290> buttons<00:02:26.530> for<00:02:27.489> the<00:02:27.609> old<00:02:27.760> CD<00:02:28.180> changer

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:28.719 
only six buttons for the old CD changer

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:32.160 
only six buttons for the old CD changer
and<00:02:29.010> since<00:02:30.010> mine<00:02:30.219> is<00:02:30.249> now<00:02:30.489> a<00:02:30.519> 12<00:02:31.030> disc<00:02:31.329> there's

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
and since mine is now a 12 disc there's

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.050 
and since mine is now a 12 disc there's
no<00:02:32.349> way<00:02:32.560> of<00:02:32.709> actually<00:02:32.829> switching<00:02:33.489> it<00:02:33.700> over<00:02:33.760> to

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
no way of actually switching it over to

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.429 
no way of actually switching it over to
disc<00:02:34.659> number<00:02:34.810> seven<00:02:35.230> through<00:02:35.409> 12<00:02:36.150> except<00:02:37.150> that

00:02:37.429 --> 00:02:37.439 
disc number seven through 12 except that

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:41.009 
disc number seven through 12 except that
it<00:02:38.439> automatically<00:02:39.150> moves<00:02:40.150> on<00:02:40.329> to<00:02:40.480> the<00:02:40.540> next<00:02:40.629> CD

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:41.019 
it automatically moves on to the next CD

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:44.610 
it automatically moves on to the next CD
after<00:02:41.439> number<00:02:41.680> six<00:02:42.510> once<00:02:43.510> that's<00:02:43.750> done<00:02:44.230> you

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
after number six once that's done you

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.550 
after number six once that's done you
can<00:02:45.489> still<00:02:46.120> switch<00:02:46.450> tracks<00:02:46.780> and<00:02:46.989> whatnot<00:02:47.349> be

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
can still switch tracks and whatnot be

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.949 
can still switch tracks and whatnot be
just<00:02:47.829> can't<00:02:48.040> switch<00:02:48.370> manually<00:02:48.939> from<00:02:49.540> 7

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
just can't switch manually from 7

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:54.030 
just can't switch manually from 7
through<00:02:50.109> 12<00:02:50.319> unless<00:02:51.249> you<00:02:52.590> scan<00:02:53.590> to<00:02:53.739> the<00:02:53.769> last

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
through 12 unless you scan to the last

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.979 
through 12 unless you scan to the last
song<00:02:54.310> and<00:02:54.549> scan<00:02:54.790> till<00:02:54.969> the<00:02:55.030> very<00:02:55.180> end<00:02:55.329> I<00:02:55.840> mean

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
song and scan till the very end I mean

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:58.379 
song and scan till the very end I mean
that's<00:02:56.139> the<00:02:56.260> only<00:02:56.409> way<00:02:56.560> i've<00:02:56.769> done<00:02:57.040> it<00:02:57.389> okay

00:02:58.379 --> 00:02:58.389 
that's the only way i've done it okay

00:02:58.389 --> 00:03:02.009 
that's the only way i've done it okay
now<00:02:59.199> to<00:02:59.260> actually<00:02:59.530> get<00:02:59.829> it<00:02:59.919> back<00:03:00.159> to<00:03:00.340> XM<00:03:01.019> for

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019 
now to actually get it back to XM for

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:05.189 
now to actually get it back to XM for
the<00:03:02.079> PID<00:03:02.379> electronics<00:03:03.219> um<00:03:03.959> there's<00:03:04.959> a<00:03:05.019> certain
