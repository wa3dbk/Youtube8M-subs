right there by doing a nice pass over
there<00:02:55.769> on<00:02:55.920> the<00:02:56.069> right<00:02:56.280> side<00:02:56.310> so<00:02:56.690> he<00:02:57.690> decides<00:02:58.049> to

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
there on the right side so he decides to

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.740 
there on the right side so he decides to
hurry<00:02:59.280> up<00:02:59.519> instead<00:02:59.879> of<00:02:59.940> just<00:03:00.150> going<00:03:00.329> into<00:03:00.569> the

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:02.609 
PlayBook selecting throw go I guess he

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:03.710 
PlayBook selecting throw go I guess he
wanted<00:03:02.910> to<00:03:03.000> try<00:03:03.209> to<00:03:03.239> get<00:03:03.390> in<00:03:03.480> the<00:03:03.569> end<00:03:03.690> zone
