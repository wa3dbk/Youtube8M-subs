00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.060
 botanischer to edit is the column that monthly tengoo on guitars and is one 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.000
 column that deals mainly with guitar share 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.250
 shred guitar and that for once I said it already in the other appointments 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.310
 we try to clear customs from his plus I have 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:32.710
 application in the context of metal for 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.370
 try to move it to other stylistic directors 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.370
 for example, today we will move on a fac basis 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.600
 it was decided with the friends of guitars that every time I went to exhaust a 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.030
 hot alice topic to point out 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.320
 I would have made a video compendium here on agreement we met the month of August 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.320
 we talked about arpeggios of arpeggios of dominant seventh arpeggios 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:58.530
 that much of the subject I had just discussed the following months we have 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.450
 spoken of pentatonic 3 notes per string in fact in today's video we will talk 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:07.940
 expressly of pentatonic 3 night for what applied you play with los tryin ' 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:09.360
 consultant salary 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.610
 Oedipus we will also be and is a work on arpeggios of minor seventh 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.620
 the number of guitars that you are holding in March 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:17.890
 you will find indeed 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.550
 a in a second lesson on the minor seventh arpeggios therefore in this 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:23.030
 video 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.050
 we will do a little study to see that you are sure you have set it to 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:31.040
 better our work but above all we will deal with the other pentatonics 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:31.940
 for what 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:33.800
 arpeggios of minor seventh 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.340
 let's set work on arpeggios of minor seventh important thing I want 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.310
 highlight and that filippo from I present you with the same kind of 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.450
 fingering with which we have studied the seventh arpeggios of 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:45.570
 dominant 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.560
 this is very important because it will allow us to take all the 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.530
 exercises I had proposed in the previous video of of ancient ita reni 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.620
 previous numbers of ebay guitars apr ikariam that these minor exercises 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:57.470
 seventh 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.360
 I am now an arpeggio of C minor seventh with the B flat on the bass 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:02.569
 hence the third minor 

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:05.609
 and I'll show you that I propose you the same kind of fingering again 

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:10.789
 canon used for dominant arpeggios or two notes on a woolen string 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:14.989
 note on the copper string two on that of sol one on that of si e2 on that 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:18.340
 of this natal gd do minor seventh starting from the third minor 

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:21.869
 hahaha game 

00:02:21.869 --> 00:02:25.209
 ahahah horoscope network there are two strings 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:28.250
 I have a bolt 2% a 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:34.709
 best way to familiarize yourself with all the fingerings 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:40.060
 and do an exercise that makes you play all these four fingerings away 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.499
 worse with different technical figures 

00:02:42.499 --> 00:02:45.499
 let's start with the eighths 

00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:11.930
 let's try now it's the 4 fingerings of minor seventh with the triplets 

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:35.239
 and now let's try the sixteenth notes so that by playing 4 notes for each 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:38.239
 time setting 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:58.929
 and lastly, let's try again in sestine so let's meet at the next video 

00:03:58.929 --> 00:04:01.810
 of 8 friends to avoid to study 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.470
 nickname construction possibility on these pages my name is cyprus 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:08.470
 this time well studied over time 

00:04:17.969 --> 00:04:22.770
 let's get to the heart of this lesson: the pentatonic 3 notes per string 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.870
 develop a pentatonic scale 3 notes per string we paste into an element that 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:31.100
 exactly characteristic over last note that we dream about on the string is always 

00:04:31.099 --> 00:04:34.080
 equal to the first note of the underlying string we take a scale 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.219
 pentatonic of C minor 

00:04:36.219 --> 00:04:39.219
 video 

00:04:39.749 --> 00:04:45.479
 E-flat fa sol is now developing other notes for chord www lamma 

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:47.289
 weather 

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:52.740
 we know how precisely the last act of a p whale string to the first note on the 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:56.460
 rope I know this the element that I am very characterizing we can 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.460
 exploit it as in the cat building pattern I make myself feel now 

00:05:00.499 --> 00:05:04.259
 or we can find the possibility for and avoid that there is 

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:06.889
 this reputed cove moon can be heavy 

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:11.180
 and perhaps taking advantage of the technique of rope jumps aimed at too many other approaches 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:15.599
 which allow us to take advantage of the great agility geometry symmetry that can 

00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:18.270
 give the fact of developing the pentatonic trout for rope but what not 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:21.550
 we incur each time the fact of repeating the same 

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:25.479
 we see the first argument that instead in fact from the fact that this note comes 

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:27.669
 repeated several times 

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:32.620
 this li that develops in sestine s ... move substantially on 2pac terme 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:35.620
 the first is this 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:39.580
 and second is this 

00:05:40.599 --> 00:05:41.849
 for which 

00:05:41.849 --> 00:05:43.349
 sex now 

00:05:43.349 --> 00:05:46.029
 of the cells formed by two systine 

00:05:46.029 --> 00:05:47.169
 Well 

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:49.180
 first sistine well 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:51.960
 second sestina 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:56.530
 those the pentatonic with the addition of some notes that are actually foreign 

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:59.150
 at the scale this is indeed a side note 

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:01.099
 sixth greater than the scale of do 

00:06:01.099 --> 00:06:04.310
 eheee therefore characteristic note of the Doric mode 

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:05.610
 let's hear the example
