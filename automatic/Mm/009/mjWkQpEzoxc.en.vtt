 [Music] 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:15.040
 hello welcome again we are going to 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.840
 prepare a delicious and easy recipe 

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.300
 as they are already accustomed obviously 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.279
 let's make some delicious potatoes 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.830
 stuffed with cheesecake so for 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:26.259
 please join me in the future for this 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:29.739
 recipe we are going to need two potatoes 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:32.920
 medium previously washed 50 grams 

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:36.970
 of bacon cut into pieces 50 grams 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:40.809
 of grated cheese 100 grams of cheese 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:43.480
 cream and 20 grams of butter our 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:46.270
 first step is to put in a pot to 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.250
 cook our potatoes once you break 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:51.630
 the boiling water we will leave the 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:54.220
 potatoes about 20 minutes 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:56.110
 let's keep in mind that the potato 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.210
 we are not going to get rid of it 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.730
 is going to be very cooked and neither 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.560
 let's stay raw inside we'll go 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:05.290
 grab while they are not cooled 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:08.020
 potatoes let's grab a pan let's go 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:10.689
 place on high heat and we will add 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.939
 the bacon as you know the bacon has 

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:14.260
 already built-in grease so there's no 

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:16.830
 necessary that I added 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.830
 Butter 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.280
 good when we see that the bacon 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.260
 it's okay now says that you love 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.610
 we proceed to remove it from the fire 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:31.700
 well let's grab 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:34.580
 of payment for potatoes and we're going to slice the 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.260
 top part to leave as 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.670
 remove them as a kind of cap 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:46.020
 to then remove the filling 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:49.259
 [Music] 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.750
 well then now let's take out the 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.000
 part of the potato and we're going to grab the 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.969
 capita is not going to waste but 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.840
 we take out what it is all potatoes without 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:02.159
 the shell obviously 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:05.509
 and very carefully 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.509
 we are giving away 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:17.900
 once the filling of the potato finishes 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.440
 so to speak, let's add the 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.440
 Butter 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:27.170
 let's mix it with the potato we're going to 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.170
 salt 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.280
 ah 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:40.460
 once chopped in the potato we incorporated 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:40.460
 last 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:48.290
 once all the butter is mixed 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:55.319
 let's incorporate 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:57.600
 the grated cheese almost all the 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:02.340
 cheese and we're just going to leave a little 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:04.530
 to place it on only so that 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.950
 is on top of the papaya in the 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:10.940
 final already when we mix the cheese 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.940
 we throw all the bacon 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:20.270
 and well we are almost finished now 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:20.750
 we are going to place the filling inside the 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:28.850
 Pope 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:31.820
 [Music] 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:33.850
 once finished doing the filling what 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:36.130
 what are we going to do is take 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:39.060
 I need us in the part of 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:41.280
 above the potato 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.950
 then we will put in the oven for 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:47.130
 that this one melts and is a 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:49.310
 look more provocative good we grab 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:52.680
 a container for oven and we're going to 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:55.380
 place it and we will be pending and 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:57.019
 we are going to place it by about 180 degrees 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:59.849
 temperature 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:01.560
 approximately for 5 minutes if not 

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:03.720
 necessarily have to do 5 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.069
 minutes we will be milk that 'not of 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.290
 that is golden so that we are not 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:09.630
 go to burn and lack good we leave a 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:13.080
 little bit more but there is not one there is not a 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:15.180
 minimum or maximum time for this recipe 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:17.940
 and we're going to have to see that the cheese 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:21.229
 senator a little bit and that the potato too 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.229
 be notorious a little bit more 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:27.550
 I'm going after 10 minutes in my oven 

00:04:24.099 --> 00:04:31.040
 if the potatoes were well browned yes 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:33.590
 and we proceed to remove it 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:36.320
 as you will see it was very easy and very simple 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:39.020
 to make this recipe is ideal for 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:41.270

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:43.580
