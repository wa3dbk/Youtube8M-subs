00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
corners of the rice paper so I know

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.969 
corners of the rice paper so I know
where<00:02:06.299> to<00:02:06.329> put<00:02:06.539> the<00:02:06.689> rice<00:02:06.869> paper<00:02:07.110> down<00:02:07.470> to

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
where to put the rice paper down to

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.089 
where to put the rice paper down to
ensure<00:02:08.160> a<00:02:08.340> nice<00:02:08.580> clean<00:02:09.179> edge<00:02:09.739> I've<00:02:10.739> also

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
ensure a nice clean edge I've also

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.250 
ensure a nice clean edge I've also
matched<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:11.610> exact<00:02:12.060> outline<00:02:12.690> of<00:02:12.720> the<00:02:13.019> liner

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
matched the exact outline of the liner

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:19.759 
matched the exact outline of the liner
so<00:02:15.230> that<00:02:16.230> will<00:02:16.530> all<00:02:16.709> work<00:02:16.890> out<00:02:17.069> neatly<00:02:18.769> aligned

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:19.769 
so that will all work out neatly aligned

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:21.289 
so that will all work out neatly aligned
with<00:02:20.069> the<00:02:20.190> black<00:02:20.400> corners<00:02:20.970> on<00:02:21.209> the

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
kitchen table is what I used to use

kitchen table is what I used to use
before<00:02:56.519> I<00:02:56.700> have<00:02:56.850> my<00:02:56.880> studio<00:02:58.250> of<00:02:59.250> course<00:02:59.579> the

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
before I have my studio of course the

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.190 
before I have my studio of course the
only<00:03:00.120> thing<00:03:00.269> you<00:03:00.510> need<00:03:00.630> to<00:03:00.780> do<00:03:00.900> is<00:03:01.019> make<00:03:01.170> sure

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
only thing you need to do is make sure

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.890 
only thing you need to do is make sure
you<00:03:01.500> clean<00:03:01.739> up<00:03:01.769> really<00:03:02.130> well<00:03:02.720> because<00:03:03.720> you

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
you clean up really well because you

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.300 
you clean up really well because you
don't<00:03:04.109> want<00:03:04.260> any<00:03:05.269> toxic<00:03:06.269> is<00:03:06.420> combined<00:03:06.989> with

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
don't want any toxic is combined with

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.449 
don't want any toxic is combined with
food

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
food

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:15.539 
food
so<00:03:10.000> as<00:03:10.930> you<00:03:11.140> can<00:03:11.290> see<00:03:11.349> as<00:03:11.920> I<00:03:12.159> rub<00:03:14.129> the<00:03:15.129> ink<00:03:15.370> is

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:15.549 
so as you can see as I rub the ink is

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:19.709 
so as you can see as I rub the ink is
coming<00:03:15.760> through<00:03:16.120> onto<00:03:16.540> the<00:03:18.390> back<00:03:19.390> of<00:03:19.569> the

coming through onto the back of the

00:03:19.719 --> 00:03:22.500 
coming through onto the back of the
paper<00:03:20.040> you<00:03:21.040> can<00:03:21.189> also<00:03:21.340> you<00:03:21.609> might<00:03:22.000> want<00:03:22.239> to<00:03:22.299> use

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
paper you can also you might want to use

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.809 
paper you can also you might want to use

a baron these are made from bamboo

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:29.339 
a baron these are made from bamboo
they're<00:03:25.329> the<00:03:25.450> traditional<00:03:26.340> Japanese<00:03:28.349> block

00:03:29.339 --> 00:03:29.349

they're the traditional Japanese block
ink

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:35.020 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:41.120 

made<00:03:35.620> a<00:03:35.650> mistake<00:03:36.010> here<00:03:36.220> what<00:03:37.060> I<00:03:37.090> should<00:03:37.360> say<00:03:37.600> is

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:44.250 

this<00:03:42.130> is<00:03:42.310> the<00:03:42.430> traditional<00:03:43.030> tool<00:03:43.870> that<00:03:44.170> the

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
this is the traditional tool that the

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:50.250 
this is the traditional tool that the
Japanese<00:03:44.770> use<00:03:45.930> printing<00:03:46.930> but<00:03:47.080> I<00:03:47.230> find<00:03:49.260> it's

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
Japanese use printing but I find it's

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.310 
Japanese use printing but I find it's
just<00:03:50.380> not<00:03:50.680> as<00:03:50.800> firm<00:03:51.700> as<00:03:52.090> a<00:03:52.150> metal<00:03:52.690> spoon<00:03:52.990> so<00:03:53.290> I

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:53.320 
just not as firm as a metal spoon so I

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:56.730 
just not as firm as a metal spoon so I
prefer<00:03:53.800> to<00:03:53.860> use<00:03:54.010> the<00:03:54.250> metal<00:03:54.490> spoon<00:03:55.560> the<00:03:56.560> thing

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:56.740 
prefer to use the metal spoon the thing

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:00.140 
prefer to use the metal spoon the thing
with<00:03:56.860> the<00:03:56.980> metal<00:03:57.220> spoon<00:03:57.490> is<00:03:57.670> you<00:03:57.970> can<00:03:58.120> imagine

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
with the metal spoon is you can imagine

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.050 
with the metal spoon is you can imagine
if<00:04:01.150> you<00:04:01.300> do<00:04:01.480> bigger<00:04:02.080> ously<00:04:02.640> you<00:04:03.640> might<00:04:03.820> get

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
if you do bigger ously you might get

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:05.520 
if you do bigger ously you might get
lines<00:04:04.300> coming<00:04:04.720> through<00:04:05.080> and<00:04:05.290> it<00:04:05.350> might<00:04:05.500> not

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
lines coming through and it might not

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.520 
lines coming through and it might not
give<00:04:06.010> a<00:04:06.040> very<00:04:06.280> even<00:04:06.580> print<00:04:07.080> so<00:04:08.080> what<00:04:08.350> we're

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
give a very even print so what we're

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.210 
give a very even print so what we're
doing<00:04:08.830> now<00:04:08.980> is<00:04:09.100> just<00:04:09.130> having<00:04:09.460> a<00:04:09.550> peek<00:04:10.920> it<00:04:11.920> still

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.220 
doing now is just having a peek it still

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.640 
doing now is just having a peek it still
needs<00:04:12.400> a<00:04:12.490> fair<00:04:12.640> bit<00:04:12.820> more<00:04:13.030> rubbing<00:04:13.530> so<00:04:14.530> I'm

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
needs a fair bit more rubbing so I'm

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.610 
needs a fair bit more rubbing so I'm
going<00:04:14.830> to<00:04:14.890> press<00:04:15.070> a<00:04:15.100> bit<00:04:15.310> harder<00:04:15.760> and<00:04:16.500> you<00:04:17.500> have

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620 
going to press a bit harder and you have

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.040 
going to press a bit harder and you have
to<00:04:17.739> try<00:04:17.950> and<00:04:18.010> imagine<00:04:18.220> that<00:04:18.520> you're<00:04:18.640> pressing

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:19.050 
to try and imagine that you're pressing

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:21.479 
to try and imagine that you're pressing
evenly<00:04:20.050> over<00:04:20.260> the<00:04:20.440> whole<00:04:20.530> print<00:04:21.010> so<00:04:21.220> you<00:04:21.280> do

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
evenly over the whole print so you do

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:27.710 
evenly over the whole print so you do
get<00:04:21.850> that<00:04:22.560> really<00:04:23.560> nice<00:04:24.810> totally<00:04:25.810> dense<00:04:26.110> cover

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
get that really nice totally dense cover

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.940 
get that really nice totally dense cover
so<00:04:28.720> I'm<00:04:28.810> moving<00:04:29.110> over<00:04:29.230> to<00:04:29.410> this<00:04:29.530> side<00:04:29.740> you'll

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:29.950 
so I'm moving over to this side you'll

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:31.470 
so I'm moving over to this side you'll
notice<00:04:30.040> that<00:04:30.280> my<00:04:30.430> hand<00:04:30.700> is<00:04:30.850> on<00:04:31.000> top<00:04:31.210> of<00:04:31.360> the

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:31.480 
notice that my hand is on top of the

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:34.710 
notice that my hand is on top of the
line<00:04:31.660> oh<00:04:31.690> so<00:04:32.080> that<00:04:32.110> it's<00:04:33.030> really<00:04:34.030> firm<00:04:34.330> we

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:34.720 
line oh so that it's really firm we

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.120 
line oh so that it's really firm we
don't<00:04:34.900> want<00:04:35.080> to<00:04:35.140> ever<00:04:35.290> take<00:04:35.530> your<00:04:35.740> hand<00:04:35.920> off

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.130 
don't want to ever take your hand off

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:37.260 
don't want to ever take your hand off
the<00:04:36.340> line<00:04:36.490> oh<00:04:36.520> when<00:04:36.790> you're<00:04:36.910> doing<00:04:37.180> this

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
the line oh when you're doing this

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.490 
the line oh when you're doing this
because<00:04:37.660> you'll<00:04:37.810> get<00:04:37.960> a<00:04:38.370> smudgy<00:04:39.370> outline

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 
because you'll get a smudgy outline

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.720 
because you'll get a smudgy outline
perhaps<00:04:41.500> that<00:04:41.710> the<00:04:41.800> whole<00:04:41.950> thing<00:04:42.190> might<00:04:42.400> move

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:42.730 
perhaps that the whole thing might move

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:47.550 
perhaps that the whole thing might move
and<00:04:43.030> ruin<00:04:43.720> your<00:04:43.750> print<00:04:45.900> every<00:04:46.900> piece<00:04:47.110> of<00:04:47.140> paper

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:47.560 
and ruin your print every piece of paper

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.460 
and ruin your print every piece of paper
that<00:04:47.770> I<00:04:47.860> use<00:04:48.100> is<00:04:48.430> relatively<00:04:49.390> expensive<00:04:50.050> so<00:04:50.440> I

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:50.470 
that I use is relatively expensive so I

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:57.450 
that I use is relatively expensive so I
want<00:04:50.740> to<00:04:50.800> be<00:04:50.950> careful<00:04:51.880> with<00:04:52.480> what<00:04:52.630> I'm<00:04:52.750> doing

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:57.460 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.450 

going

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460 
going

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.480 
going
but<00:05:00.789> even<00:05:01.240> is<00:05:01.389> going<00:05:01.600> to<00:05:01.660> be<00:05:01.750> up<00:05:01.870> there

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 
but even is going to be up there

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:05.070 
but even is going to be up there
sometimes<00:05:03.490> I<00:05:03.610> use<00:05:03.819> the<00:05:04.120> end<00:05:04.449> of<00:05:04.690> the<00:05:04.780> spoon

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080 
sometimes I use the end of the spoon

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:19.290 
sometimes I use the end of the spoon
just<00:05:05.410> to<00:05:12.870> just<00:05:13.870> to<00:05:15.360> do<00:05:16.360> the<00:05:16.509> fine<00:05:16.720> details<00:05:18.300> but

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:19.300 
just to just to do the fine details but

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:20.640 
just to just to do the fine details but
I<00:05:19.330> think<00:05:19.630> this<00:05:19.720> print<00:05:20.020> is<00:05:20.110> going<00:05:20.169> to<00:05:20.289> work<00:05:20.440> out

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:20.650 
I think this print is going to work out

I think this print is going to work out
to<00:05:20.830> be<00:05:20.979> as<00:05:21.130> even<00:05:21.490> as<00:05:21.610> my<00:05:21.789> other<00:05:21.970> one<00:05:23.280> so<00:05:27.479> what

what you can do is peel off a part of

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.450 
what you can do is peel off a part of
the<00:05:36.280> print<00:05:36.550> and<00:05:36.699> actually<00:05:36.970> add<00:05:37.120> more<00:05:38.130> ink<00:05:39.130> with

00:06:00.059 --> 00:06:00.069 
home obviously if you put some of if the

00:06:00.069 --> 00:06:01.860 
home obviously if you put some of if the
roller<00:06:00.340> touches<00:06:00.849> the<00:06:00.940> registration<00:06:01.599> paper

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:01.870 
roller touches the registration paper

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:03.870 
roller touches the registration paper
you<00:06:02.050> end<00:06:02.199> up<00:06:02.319> with<00:06:02.470> the<00:06:02.560> black<00:06:02.800> mark<00:06:03.550> which

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:03.880 
you end up with the black mark which

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:06.450 
you end up with the black mark which
will<00:06:04.090> get<00:06:04.360> transferred<00:06:04.930> to<00:06:05.199> your<00:06:05.349> paper<00:06:06.130> which

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:06.460 
will get transferred to your paper which

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:08.610 
will get transferred to your paper which
won't<00:06:06.669> look<00:06:06.820> very<00:06:06.880> good<00:06:07.120> so<00:06:07.479> you<00:06:07.870> have<00:06:08.409> to<00:06:08.500> be

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:08.620 
won't look very good so you have to be

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:11.730 
won't look very good so you have to be
really<00:06:08.860> really<00:06:09.039> careful<00:06:09.220> doing<00:06:09.550> that<00:06:10.740> let's

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:11.740 
really really careful doing that let's

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:31.260 
really really careful doing that let's
see<00:06:11.919> if<00:06:12.009> that's<00:06:12.190> make<00:06:12.430> a<00:06:12.460> difference

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:31.270 

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:33.570 

that's<00:06:32.270> better<00:06:32.660> isn't<00:06:32.780> it

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:33.580 
that's better isn't it

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:36.970 
that's better isn't it
now<00:06:34.750> my<00:06:35.750> thinking<00:06:36.200> is<00:06:36.320> the<00:06:36.470> other<00:06:36.590> side<00:06:36.830> is

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:36.980 
now my thinking is the other side is

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:38.710 
now my thinking is the other side is
going<00:06:37.160> to<00:06:37.220> be<00:06:37.370> pretty<00:06:37.640> similar<00:06:38.090> we'll<00:06:38.540> just

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:38.720 
going to be pretty similar we'll just

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:40.860 
going to be pretty similar we'll just
have<00:06:38.840> a<00:06:38.900> little<00:06:39.020> look<00:06:39.170> at<00:06:39.380> the<00:06:39.500> other<00:06:39.620> side

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:40.870 
have a little look at the other side

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:49.900 
have a little look at the other side
it's<00:06:41.870> not<00:06:41.930> bad<00:06:47.800> you<00:06:48.800> get<00:06:48.920> not<00:06:49.130> quite<00:06:49.490> a<00:06:49.520> sweat

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:49.910 
it's not bad you get not quite a sweat

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:54.510 
it's not bad you get not quite a sweat
when<00:06:50.060> you're<00:06:50.210> doing<00:06:50.420> this

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:54.520 

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:57.250 

nice<00:06:55.520> humid<00:06:56.090> day<00:06:56.270> in<00:06:56.330> Sydney<00:06:56.810> I<00:06:56.990> think<00:06:57.170> it's

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:57.260 
nice humid day in Sydney I think it's

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:05.170
