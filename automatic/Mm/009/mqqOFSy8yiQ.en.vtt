00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.519 
to show you why some of the last matches
I<00:00:18.000> watched<00:00:18.300> or<00:00:18.600> that<00:00:18.720> I<00:00:18.750> can<00:00:18.960> remember<00:00:19.230> on

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
I watched or that I can remember on

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.660 
I watched or that I can remember on
Mirage<00:00:20.960> at<00:00:21.960> EMS<00:00:22.439> actually<00:00:23.010> teams<00:00:23.490> were

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
Mirage at EMS actually teams were

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.029 
Mirage at EMS actually teams were
smoking<00:00:24.180> like<00:00:24.390> some<00:00:25.109> teams<00:00:25.380> were<00:00:25.529> smoking<00:00:25.890> a

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
smoking like some teams were smoking a

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.589 
smoking like some teams were smoking a
lot<00:00:26.460> of<00:00:26.609> things<00:00:26.910> and<00:00:27.119> I<00:00:27.180> thought<00:00:27.359> it<00:00:27.510> was

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
lot of things and I thought it was

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.419 
lot of things and I thought it was
really<00:00:27.869> bad<00:00:28.170> it<00:00:28.410> was<00:00:28.529> actually<00:00:28.800> hurting<00:00:29.039> them

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
really bad it was actually hurting them

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.310 
really bad it was actually hurting them
because<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.269> CTS<00:00:30.689> would<00:00:30.840> just<00:00:31.050> hide<00:00:31.289> behind

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
because the CTS would just hide behind

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.500 
because the CTS would just hide behind
the<00:00:31.830> smoke<00:00:32.099> and<00:00:32.340> it<00:00:32.880> would<00:00:33.030> just<00:00:33.180> help<00:00:33.300> them

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
the smoke and it would just help them

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.680 
the smoke and it would just help them
delete<00:00:33.840> angles<00:00:34.260> such<00:00:34.500> as<00:00:34.680> like<00:00:35.480> smoking<00:00:36.480> that

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
delete angles such as like smoking that

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.560 
delete angles such as like smoking that
off<00:00:36.899> there<00:00:37.350> I<00:00:37.530> saw<00:00:38.250> people<00:00:38.399> some<00:00:39.030> teams<00:00:39.300> smoke

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
off there I saw people some teams smoke

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.240 
off there I saw people some teams smoke
this<00:00:39.780> off<00:00:40.020> I<00:00:40.230> think<00:00:40.290> that's<00:00:40.530> really<00:00:40.710> bad<00:00:41.010> as

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
this off I think that's really bad as

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.700 
this off I think that's really bad as
the<00:00:41.879> CT<00:00:42.270> literally<00:00:42.780> just<00:00:43.050> sat<00:00:43.260> behind<00:00:43.620> the

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
the CT literally just sat behind the

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.860 
the CT literally just sat behind the
smoke<00:00:43.950> and<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:45.000> terrorists<00:00:45.450> were<00:00:45.539> running

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
smoke and the terrorists were running

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.020 
smoke and the terrorists were running
through<00:00:46.140> their<00:00:46.289> own<00:00:46.469> smoke<00:00:46.920> and<00:00:47.579> this<00:00:47.700> guy<00:00:47.910> was

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
through their own smoke and this guy was

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.670 
through their own smoke and this guy was
just<00:00:48.210> like<00:00:48.360> oh<00:00:48.450> honey<00:00:48.870> God<00:00:49.079> thank<00:00:49.379> you<00:00:49.500> for

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
just like oh honey God thank you for

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.119 
just like oh honey God thank you for
these<00:00:49.770> free<00:00:50.010> kills<00:00:50.280> or<00:00:51.020> even<00:00:52.020> if<00:00:52.140> like<00:00:52.379> he

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
these free kills or even if like he

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.650 
these free kills or even if like he
doesn't<00:00:53.430> even<00:00:53.550> if<00:00:53.910> no<00:00:54.090> terrorist<00:00:54.480> runs

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
doesn't even if no terrorist runs

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.810 
doesn't even if no terrorist runs
through<00:00:54.899> it<00:00:55.050> it's<00:00:55.800> just<00:00:55.920> helping<00:00:56.280> him<00:00:56.370> out<00:00:56.520> so

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
through it it's just helping him out so

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.000 
through it it's just helping him out so
much<00:00:57.030> because<00:00:57.480> it's<00:00:57.660> deleting<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.289> van<00:00:58.500> angle

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
much because it's deleting the van angle

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.340 
much because it's deleting the van angle
it's<00:00:59.129> deleting<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.699> high<00:00:59.879> angle<00:01:00.090> and<00:01:00.510> he<00:01:01.230> can

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
it's deleting the high angle and he can

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.319 
it's deleting the high angle and he can
just<00:01:01.469> worry<00:01:01.739> about<00:01:01.980> just<00:01:02.370> now<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:02.640> site<00:01:03.059> there

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
just worry about just now the site there

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.260 
just worry about just now the site there
so<00:01:04.170> this<00:01:04.559> is<00:01:04.710> like<00:01:04.860> a<00:01:04.890> smoke<00:01:05.369> that<00:01:05.519> at<00:01:05.670> CT<00:01:06.119> would

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
so this is like a smoke that at CT would

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.789 
so this is like a smoke that at CT would
throw<00:01:06.540> that<00:01:06.750> would<00:01:06.930> help<00:01:07.020> him<00:01:07.229> so<00:01:07.470> I'm<00:01:07.619> not<00:01:07.770> a

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
throw that would help him so I'm not a

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.890 
throw that would help him so I'm not a
fan<00:01:08.040> of<00:01:08.070> smoking<00:01:08.490> off<00:01:08.580> of<00:01:08.729> that<00:01:08.850> not<00:01:09.540> a<00:01:09.570> fan<00:01:09.869> of

I like it when I see it as a CT so one

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.210 
I like it when I see it as a CT so one
smoke<00:02:09.479> that<00:02:09.629> I<00:02:09.720> really<00:02:10.229> do<00:02:10.410> like<00:02:10.619> and<00:02:10.920> I<00:02:11.009> think

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
smoke that I really do like and I think

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.949 
smoke that I really do like and I think
it<00:02:11.310> should<00:02:11.459> be<00:02:11.489> on<00:02:11.670> every<00:02:12.090> single<00:02:12.270> B<00:02:12.569> hit<00:02:12.780> is<00:02:12.900> a

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
it should be on every single B hit is a

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.400 
it should be on every single B hit is a
smoke

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
smoke

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.790 
smoke
right<00:02:13.620> here<00:02:14.570> this<00:02:15.570> smoke<00:02:15.840> helps<00:02:16.080> out<00:02:16.260> so<00:02:16.290> much

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
right here this smoke helps out so much

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.700 
right here this smoke helps out so much
because<00:02:17.550> it's<00:02:18.300> really<00:02:18.810> really<00:02:19.200> hard<00:02:19.410> when

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
because it's really really hard when

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.860 
because it's really really hard when
you're<00:02:19.860> trying<00:02:19.890> to<00:02:20.220> check<00:02:20.820> so<00:02:21.060> many<00:02:21.270> like<00:02:21.450> 180

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
you're trying to check so many like 180

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.780 
you're trying to check so many like 180
angles<00:02:22.350> you<00:02:22.470> know<00:02:22.500> so<00:02:23.070> cutting<00:02:23.400> off<00:02:23.550> this

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
angles you know so cutting off this

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.510 
angles you know so cutting off this
angle<00:02:24.210> here<00:02:24.540> like<00:02:25.050> the<00:02:25.170> corner<00:02:25.530> guy<00:02:25.710> and<00:02:26.160> a<00:02:26.280> cat

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
angle here like the corner guy and a cat

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.640 
angle here like the corner guy and a cat
guy<00:02:26.760> helping<00:02:27.150> from<00:02:27.330> back<00:02:27.510> here<00:02:27.780> helps<00:02:28.200> a<00:02:28.380> lot

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
guy helping from back here helps a lot

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.010 
guy helping from back here helps a lot
so<00:02:29.010> I<00:02:29.040> think<00:02:29.280> the<00:02:29.550> smoke<00:02:29.820> should<00:02:30.090> should<00:02:30.870> all

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
so I think the smoke should should all

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.890 
so I think the smoke should should all
be<00:02:31.350> in<00:02:31.380> every<00:02:31.800> single<00:02:31.920> be<00:02:32.250> hit<00:02:32.460> and<00:02:32.900> what

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
be in every single be hit and what

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.650 
be in every single be hit and what
you're<00:02:33.990> going<00:02:34.080> to<00:02:34.170> do<00:02:34.320> is<00:02:34.440> commit<00:02:34.800> great<00:02:35.660> aim

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
you're going to do is commit great aim

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.390 
you're going to do is commit great aim
up<00:02:36.960> there's<00:02:37.350> going<00:02:37.440> to<00:02:37.500> be<00:02:37.560> two<00:02:37.800> notches<00:02:38.220> here

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
up there's going to be two notches here

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.040 
up there's going to be two notches here
two<00:02:38.610> wood<00:02:38.790> notches<00:02:39.210> you're<00:02:39.780> going<00:02:39.900> to<00:02:39.960> go<00:02:40.020> to

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
two wood notches you're going to go to

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:41.870 
two wood notches you're going to go to
the<00:02:40.320> left<00:02:40.560> the<00:02:40.890> second<00:02:41.220> one<00:02:41.310> and<00:02:41.520> go<00:02:41.700> to<00:02:41.760> the

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
the left the second one and go to the

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.570 
the left the second one and go to the
left<00:02:42.440> so<00:02:43.440> it<00:02:43.650> has<00:02:43.770> enough<00:02:43.980> space<00:02:44.190> to<00:02:44.370> you<00:02:44.460> know

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
left so it has enough space to you know

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.820 
left so it has enough space to you know
throw<00:02:45.030> obviously<00:02:45.750> and<00:02:45.960> it's<00:02:46.530> going<00:02:46.680> to<00:02:46.740> look

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830
