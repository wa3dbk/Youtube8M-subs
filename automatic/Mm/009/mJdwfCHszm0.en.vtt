00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
disadvantages first I'm going to start

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.640 
disadvantages first I'm going to start
off<00:00:26.609> with<00:00:26.820> one<00:00:27.000> of<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.300> more<00:00:28.080> common<00:00:28.439> blade

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
off with one of the more common blade

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.830 
off with one of the more common blade
shapes<00:00:28.980> one<00:00:29.880> of<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.029> most<00:00:30.269> common<00:00:30.660> blade

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
shapes one of the most common blade

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.180 
shapes one of the most common blade
shapes<00:00:31.279> and<00:00:32.279> that's<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.759> clip<00:00:33.000> point<00:00:34.190> it's

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
shapes and that's the clip point it's

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.280 
shapes and that's the clip point it's
basically<00:00:35.610> you<00:00:35.910> know<00:00:36.000> you<00:00:36.090> got<00:00:36.239> your<00:00:36.390> got<00:00:37.200> it

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
basically you know you got your got it

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.810 
basically you know you got your got it
up<00:00:37.440> sweep<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:37.920> then<00:00:38.010> that<00:00:38.219> that<00:00:38.370> goes

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
up sweep and then that that goes

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.790 
up sweep and then that that goes
straight<00:00:39.120> on<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.329> top<00:00:39.540> then<00:00:39.840> it<00:00:39.870> has<00:00:40.500> a<00:00:40.530> clip

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
straight on the top then it has a clip

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.500 
straight on the top then it has a clip
on<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.040> end<00:00:41.160> where<00:00:41.280> it<00:00:41.399> just<00:00:41.579> sweaters<00:00:42.390> in

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
on the end where it just sweaters in

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.020 
on the end where it just sweaters in
there<00:00:42.719> and<00:00:43.110> that<00:00:43.620> makes<00:00:43.829> for<00:00:43.980> a<00:00:44.040> very<00:00:44.070> acute

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
there and that makes for a very acute

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.670 
there and that makes for a very acute
tip<00:00:45.329> and<00:00:45.809> very<00:00:45.989> good<00:00:46.200> for<00:00:46.440> piercing<00:00:48.410> so<00:00:49.410> very

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
tip and very good for piercing so very

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.420 
tip and very good for piercing so very
sharp<00:00:50.010> tip<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:51.140> but<00:00:52.140> not<00:00:52.230> as<00:00:52.410> strong<00:00:52.710> as<00:00:52.980> some

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
sharp tip and but not as strong as some

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.569 
sharp tip and but not as strong as some
other<00:00:53.610> ix<00:00:53.850> blades<00:00:54.480> but<00:00:55.260> very<00:00:55.590> good<00:00:55.829> and<00:00:56.100> sharp

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
other ix blades but very good and sharp

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.910 
other ix blades but very good and sharp
for<00:00:56.820> piercing<00:00:57.270> and<00:00:57.420> you<00:00:57.780> can<00:00:57.989> sharpen<00:00:58.379> up<00:00:58.649> the

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
for piercing and you can sharpen up the

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.420 
for piercing and you can sharpen up the
this<00:00:59.579> back<00:00:59.820> swedge<00:01:00.449> on<00:01:00.890> maybe<00:01:01.890> a<00:01:01.949> fixed<00:01:02.250> plate

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
this back swedge on maybe a fixed plate

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.810 
this back swedge on maybe a fixed plate
if<00:01:03.090> they<00:01:03.270> have<00:01:03.390> it<00:01:03.539> if<00:01:03.750> it<00:01:03.930> has<00:01:04.110> a<00:01:04.610> clip<00:01:05.610> point

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
if they have it if it has a clip point

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.830 
if they have it if it has a clip point
and<00:01:06.090> so<00:01:06.990> then<00:01:07.110> you<00:01:07.200> can<00:01:07.260> have<00:01:07.350> a<00:01:07.439> double<00:01:07.650> edge

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
and so then you can have a double edge

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:16.359 
and so then you can have a double edge
so<00:01:09.840> this<00:01:09.960> is<00:01:10.049> a<00:01:10.170> pretty<00:01:10.350> common<00:01:13.430> blade<00:01:14.430> shape

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:16.369 
so this is a pretty common blade shape

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:21.800 
so this is a pretty common blade shape
next<00:01:17.369> one<00:01:17.549> is<00:01:17.729> a<00:01:17.759> drop<00:01:18.060> point<00:01:20.420> you<00:01:21.420> get<00:01:21.570> a<00:01:21.630> good

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
next one is a drop point you get a good

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.070 
next one is a drop point you get a good
up<00:01:22.049> sweep<00:01:22.350> on<00:01:22.619> it<00:01:22.770> on<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.729> blade<00:01:24.080> they're

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
up sweep on it on the blade they're

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.740 
up sweep on it on the blade they're
often<00:01:25.380> used<00:01:25.409> for<00:01:25.860> hunting<00:01:26.180> for<00:01:27.180> skinning<00:01:27.479> and

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
often used for hunting for skinning and

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.690 
often used for hunting for skinning and
stuff<00:01:27.930> like<00:01:28.110> that<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:29.100> basically<00:01:29.340> you<00:01:29.640> just

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
stuff like that and basically you just

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.730 
stuff like that and basically you just
have<00:01:30.000> a<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.900> top<00:01:31.079> of<00:01:31.229> weight<00:01:31.380> just<00:01:31.409> slowly

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
have a the top of weight just slowly

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.980 
have a the top of weight just slowly
goes<00:01:32.040> down<00:01:32.340> you<00:01:33.000> do<00:01:33.150> have<00:01:33.180> a<00:01:33.360> stronger<00:01:33.810> tip

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
goes down you do have a stronger tip

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.460 
goes down you do have a stronger tip
with<00:01:34.170> this<00:01:34.320> one<00:01:35.420> you<00:01:36.420> get<00:01:36.540> a<00:01:36.600> stronger<00:01:36.960> tip<00:01:37.259> and

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
with this one you get a stronger tip and

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.520 
with this one you get a stronger tip and
you<00:01:37.530> get<00:01:37.680> this<00:01:38.570> up<00:01:39.570> sweep<00:01:39.869> on<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.079> blade<00:01:40.290> so

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
you get this up sweep on the blade so

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.850 
you get this up sweep on the blade so
it's<00:01:40.650> good<00:01:40.950> for<00:01:40.979> a<00:01:41.250> lot<00:01:41.369> of<00:01:41.520> utility<00:01:41.759> tasks<00:01:42.479> and

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
it's good for a lot of utility tasks and

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.310 
it's good for a lot of utility tasks and
you<00:01:43.860> know<00:01:43.950> just<00:01:44.220> a<00:01:44.960> lot<00:01:45.960> of<00:01:45.990> people<00:01:46.200> prefer

you know just a lot of people prefer

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.499 
you know just a lot of people prefer
drop<00:01:47.100> points<00:01:47.399> as<00:01:47.520> an<00:01:47.670> everyday<00:01:47.909> carry<00:01:48.270> knife

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
similar this is a hawk Bill blade shape

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.690 
similar this is a hawk Bill blade shape
or<00:02:01.920> a<00:02:02.670> Karambit<00:02:03.149> style<00:02:04.079> blade<00:02:04.380> shape<00:02:04.700> this

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
or a Karambit style blade shape this

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.320 
or a Karambit style blade shape this
one's<00:02:05.909> a<00:02:06.000> Spyderco<00:02:06.630> tasman<00:02:07.469> salt<00:02:08.330> basically

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
one's a Spyderco tasman salt basically

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.320 
one's a Spyderco tasman salt basically
the<00:02:09.959> edge<00:02:10.459> curves<00:02:11.459> down

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
the edge curves down

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.990 
the edge curves down
so<00:02:13.020> then<00:02:13.140> the<00:02:13.200> back<00:02:13.380> curves<00:02:13.710> down<00:02:13.920> to<00:02:14.190> this

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
so then the back curves down to this

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.910 
so then the back curves down to this
basically<00:02:15.480> makes<00:02:15.660> for<00:02:15.900> a<00:02:15.930> very<00:02:15.960> good<00:02:16.290> slash<00:02:16.590> or

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
basically makes for a very good slash or

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.300 
basically makes for a very good slash or
very<00:02:17.220> good<00:02:17.310> you<00:02:18.210> know<00:02:18.300> for<00:02:18.510> tearing<00:02:18.900> things

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
very good you know for tearing things

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.350 
very good you know for tearing things
cutting<00:02:20.310> rope<00:02:20.520> is<00:02:20.730> good<00:02:21.000> for<00:02:21.240> because

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
cutting rope is good for because

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.740 
cutting rope is good for because
basically<00:02:21.780> it<00:02:22.070> this<00:02:23.070> is<00:02:23.220> the<00:02:23.340> rope<00:02:23.520> it<00:02:23.760> takes

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
basically it this is the rope it takes

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.440 
basically it this is the rope it takes
it<00:02:24.900> towards<00:02:25.290> you<00:02:25.470> instead<00:02:25.890> of<00:02:26.060> if<00:02:27.060> you<00:02:27.210> had<00:02:27.420> a

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
it towards you instead of if you had a

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.360 
it towards you instead of if you had a
knife<00:02:27.690> like<00:02:27.870> this<00:02:27.930> the<00:02:28.710> Rope<00:02:28.890> would<00:02:29.010> just<00:02:29.190> slip

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
knife like this the Rope would just slip

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.360 
knife like this the Rope would just slip
off<00:02:30.050> that's<00:02:31.050> what<00:02:31.170> this<00:02:31.260> is<00:02:31.410> good<00:02:31.590> for<00:02:31.620> cutting

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
off that's what this is good for cutting

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.090 
off that's what this is good for cutting
netting<00:02:32.790> cutting<00:02:33.150> rope<00:02:33.360> stuff<00:02:33.690> like<00:02:33.840> that

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
netting cutting rope stuff like that

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.170 
netting cutting rope stuff like that
this<00:02:35.100> is<00:02:35.220> one<00:02:35.310> of<00:02:35.370> my<00:02:35.430> favorite<00:02:35.850> everyday

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
blade shapes for everyday carry this

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:58.850 
blade shapes for everyday carry this
next<00:02:57.810> will<00:02:57.930> just<00:02:58.110> will<00:02:58.230> be<00:02:58.290> pretty<00:02:58.620> similar

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
next will just will be pretty similar

this<00:02:59.280> is<00:02:59.430> a<00:02:59.460> spider<00:03:00.330> code<00:03:00.600> cricket<00:03:01.020> and<00:03:01.680> it<00:03:01.890> has

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
this is a spider code cricket and it has

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.400 
this is a spider code cricket and it has
a<00:03:02.070> reverse<00:03:02.610> ex<00:03:03.150> blade<00:03:03.540> shape<00:03:03.900> and<00:03:04.110> basically

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
a reverse ex blade shape and basically

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.590 
a reverse ex blade shape and basically
you<00:03:05.160> still<00:03:05.400> have<00:03:05.550> the<00:03:05.730> downward<00:03:06.180> shape<00:03:06.480> of

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
you still have the downward shape of

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.860 
you still have the downward shape of
that<00:03:06.750> Hawk<00:03:06.960> Bill<00:03:07.230> blade<00:03:07.610> but<00:03:08.610> then<00:03:08.760> at<00:03:09.570> first

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
that Hawk Bill blade but then at first

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.870 
that Hawk Bill blade but then at first
it<00:03:10.050> has<00:03:10.140> a<00:03:10.170> belly<00:03:10.470> that<00:03:10.710> goes<00:03:10.890> up<00:03:11.130> then<00:03:11.490> does

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
it has a belly that goes up then does

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.910 
it has a belly that goes up then does
that<00:03:11.910> downward<00:03:12.300> shape<00:03:12.720> so<00:03:13.350> basically<00:03:13.650> you<00:03:13.830> get

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
that downward shape so basically you get

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.740 
that downward shape so basically you get
the<00:03:13.980> same<00:03:14.220> advantages<00:03:14.730> as<00:03:14.790> a<00:03:14.970> hawk<00:03:15.210> blade<00:03:15.600> but

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
the same advantages as a hawk blade but

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.590 
the same advantages as a hawk blade but
then<00:03:15.870> you<00:03:15.960> get<00:03:16.110> some<00:03:16.290> belly<00:03:16.470> for<00:03:17.450> other<00:03:18.450> things

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
then you get some belly for other things

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.260 
then you get some belly for other things
like<00:03:19.230> they<00:03:20.160> use<00:03:20.489> like<00:03:20.670> a<00:03:20.700> drop-point<00:03:21.000> blade

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:21.270 
like they use like a drop-point blade

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:23.570 
like they use like a drop-point blade
for<00:03:21.720> Eunos<00:03:22.260> for<00:03:22.560> like<00:03:22.709> slicing<00:03:23.310> and<00:03:23.430> stuff

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
for Eunos for like slicing and stuff

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.970 
for Eunos for like slicing and stuff
like<00:03:23.700> that<00:03:23.940> so<00:03:24.690> you<00:03:24.780> kind<00:03:25.050> of<00:03:25.110> get<00:03:25.290> the<00:03:25.650> best<00:03:25.800> of

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
like that so you kind of get the best of

really<00:03:58.140> have<00:03:58.320> much<00:03:58.350> belly<00:03:58.770> but<00:03:59.040> tapers<00:03:59.310> off<00:03:59.430> to

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
really have much belly but tapers off to

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:01.729 
really have much belly but tapers off to
a<00:03:59.640> very<00:03:59.910> thin<00:03:59.970> point<00:04:00.510> so<00:04:01.080> basically<00:04:01.110> all<00:04:01.500> you

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
a very thin point so basically all you

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:05.150 
a very thin point so basically all you
can<00:04:01.860> do<00:04:02.010> this<00:04:02.280> is<00:04:02.489> stabbing<00:04:03.120> so<00:04:03.860> yeah<00:04:04.860> this<00:04:05.070> is

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
can do this is stabbing so yeah this is

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.650 
can do this is stabbing so yeah this is
going<00:04:05.250> to<00:04:05.340> be<00:04:05.430> more<00:04:05.640> just<00:04:05.970> a<00:04:06.120> self-defense

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
going to be more just a self-defense

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.259 
going to be more just a self-defense
played<00:04:07.040> it<00:04:08.040> really<00:04:08.190> only<00:04:08.310> has<00:04:08.519> one<00:04:08.760> use<00:04:09.000> and

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:09.269 
played it really only has one use and

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:10.699 
played it really only has one use and
the<00:04:09.570> blade<00:04:09.780> the<00:04:09.989> tip<00:04:10.170> is<00:04:10.290> not<00:04:10.320> going<00:04:10.560> to<00:04:10.620> be

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
the blade the tip is not going to be

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:20.800 
the blade the tip is not going to be
nearly<00:04:11.070> as<00:04:11.250> strong<00:04:11.430> as<00:04:11.730> something

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.090 

next<00:04:21.810> it's<00:04:21.930> also<00:04:22.140> a<00:04:22.290> pretty<00:04:22.560> common<00:04:22.920> blade

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
next it's also a pretty common blade

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:29.360 
next it's also a pretty common blade
shape<00:04:24.770> this<00:04:25.770> is<00:04:25.890> a<00:04:25.920> tanto<00:04:26.460> blade<00:04:26.580> shape<00:04:28.370> and

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
shape this is a tanto blade shape and

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:31.820 
shape this is a tanto blade shape and
it's<00:04:30.360> basically<00:04:30.840> you<00:04:31.050> have<00:04:31.200> your<00:04:31.350> first<00:04:31.590> edge

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
it's basically you have your first edge

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.560 
it's basically you have your first edge
this<00:04:32.010> is<00:04:32.220> more<00:04:32.400> the<00:04:32.520> Americanized<00:04:33.090> tanto

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:33.570 
this is more the Americanized tanto

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:35.870 
this is more the Americanized tanto
blade<00:04:33.690> shape<00:04:34.050> you<00:04:34.650> have<00:04:34.680> your<00:04:34.890> main<00:04:35.370> edge<00:04:35.580> and

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880 
blade shape you have your main edge and

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.870 
blade shape you have your main edge and
then<00:04:36.110> there's<00:04:37.110> a<00:04:37.340> stopping<00:04:38.340> point<00:04:38.490> for<00:04:38.640> right

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
then there's a stopping point for right

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:40.940 
then there's a stopping point for right
there<00:04:39.090> and<00:04:39.210> there's<00:04:39.450> a<00:04:39.540> secondary<00:04:39.960> edge<00:04:40.170> that

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:40.950 
there and there's a secondary edge that

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:44.060 
there and there's a secondary edge that
goes<00:04:41.100> to<00:04:41.340> the<00:04:41.430> point<00:04:42.080> and<00:04:43.080> this<00:04:43.620> makes<00:04:43.860> for<00:04:44.010> a

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.070 
goes to the point and this makes for a

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:46.940 
goes to the point and this makes for a
very<00:04:44.340> strong<00:04:44.670> tip<00:04:45.560> so<00:04:46.560> it's<00:04:46.680> going<00:04:46.770> to<00:04:46.830> be<00:04:46.920> a

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:46.950 
very strong tip so it's going to be a

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:51.230 
very strong tip so it's going to be a
stronger<00:04:47.280> blade<00:04:47.640> shape<00:04:48.000> and<00:04:49.850> you<00:04:50.850> also<00:04:50.970> have

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
stronger blade shape and you also have

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.490 
stronger blade shape and you also have
that<00:04:51.360> secondary<00:04:51.870> edge<00:04:51.990> right<00:04:52.170> there<00:04:52.350> where<00:04:52.440> it

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 
that secondary edge right there where it

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:53.900 
that secondary edge right there where it
stops<00:04:52.800> so<00:04:52.950> it's<00:04:53.070> gonna<00:04:53.190> be<00:04:53.280> great<00:04:53.460> for<00:04:53.640> slicing

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:53.910 
stops so it's gonna be great for slicing

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:55.730 
stops so it's gonna be great for slicing
so<00:04:54.600> basically<00:04:54.870> if<00:04:54.990> you<00:04:55.050> just<00:04:55.170> want<00:04:55.350> a<00:04:55.380> stronger

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
so basically if you just want a stronger

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.770 
so basically if you just want a stronger
blade<00:04:56.400> that's<00:04:57.120> what<00:04:57.270> you're<00:04:57.390> gonna<00:04:57.480> want<00:04:57.690> the

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
blade that's what you're gonna want the

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.110 
blade that's what you're gonna want the
tanto<00:04:58.110> for<00:04:58.380> this<00:04:59.100> is<00:04:59.250> just<00:04:59.280> a<00:04:59.550> neck<00:04:59.730> knife<00:04:59.910> by

but definitely not least is the kukri

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:25.220 
but definitely not least is the kukri
blade<00:05:22.650> shape<00:05:22.970> this<00:05:23.970> is<00:05:24.150> the<00:05:24.330> cold<00:05:24.600> steel<00:05:24.900> Rajah

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:25.230 
blade shape this is the cold steel Rajah

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:30.710 
blade shape this is the cold steel Rajah
one<00:05:25.770> and<00:05:26.600> it<00:05:27.600> has<00:05:27.720> a<00:05:27.750> concrete<00:05:28.140> blade<00:05:29.720> and

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:30.720 
one and it has a concrete blade and

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.630 
one and it has a concrete blade and
that's<00:05:30.960> the<00:05:31.590> kukri<00:05:31.890> blade<00:05:32.130> is<00:05:32.310> basically

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:32.640 
that's the kukri blade is basically

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:36.590 
that's the kukri blade is basically
where<00:05:32.910> it<00:05:33.500> kind<00:05:34.500> of<00:05:34.560> goes<00:05:34.740> up<00:05:35.030> like<00:05:36.030> concave

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:36.600 
where it kind of goes up like concave

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.480 
where it kind of goes up like concave
and<00:05:36.870> then<00:05:36.990> it<00:05:37.110> dips<00:05:37.680> back<00:05:37.860> down<00:05:38.040> has<00:05:38.340> that

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:38.490 
and then it dips back down has that

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:41.840 
and then it dips back down has that
belly<00:05:38.700> that<00:05:38.880> goes<00:05:39.060> back<00:05:39.270> up<00:05:40.340> so<00:05:41.340> it<00:05:41.520> dips<00:05:41.760> down

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:41.850 
belly that goes back up so it dips down

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:44.060 
belly that goes back up so it dips down
and<00:05:42.000> goes<00:05:42.540> that<00:05:42.780> then<00:05:43.050> goes<00:05:43.350> back<00:05:43.380> down<00:05:43.620> then

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:44.070 
and goes that then goes back down then

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:47.240 
and goes that then goes back down then
back<00:05:44.250> up<00:05:44.460> so<00:05:44.820> it<00:05:45.000> has<00:05:45.990> a<00:05:46.020> very<00:05:46.140> strong<00:05:46.440> tip<00:05:46.950> and

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:47.250 
back up so it has a very strong tip and

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:49.610 
back up so it has a very strong tip and
this<00:05:47.640> area<00:05:48.000> right<00:05:48.150> here<00:05:48.180> is<00:05:48.600> just<00:05:49.290> great<00:05:49.590> for
