kalca<00:00:01.620> calendar<00:00:02.399> is<00:00:02.669> very<00:00:02.700> different<00:00:03.270> to

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:03.360 
kalca calendar is very different to

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:04.820 
kalca calendar is very different to
chocolate<00:00:03.959> that<00:00:04.110> we're<00:00:04.290> used<00:00:04.500> to<00:00:04.560> in<00:00:04.740> the

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.830 
chocolate that we're used to in the

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.619 
chocolate that we're used to in the
store<00:00:05.100> chocolate<00:00:05.640> we<00:00:05.850> used<00:00:06.060> to<00:00:06.150> in<00:00:06.270> the<00:00:06.299> stalls

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
store chocolate we used to in the stalls

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.379 
store chocolate we used to in the stalls
is<00:00:07.020> separated<00:00:07.770> in<00:00:07.950> a<00:00:08.040> similar<00:00:08.490> way<00:00:08.519> getting

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
is separated in a similar way getting

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.580 
is separated in a similar way getting
big<00:00:09.719> heat<00:00:10.410> producing<00:00:11.370> and<00:00:12.330> chemical<00:00:13.049> thrills

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
big heat producing and chemical thrills

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.250 
big heat producing and chemical thrills
wax<00:00:14.219> basically<00:00:15.030> it's<00:00:15.299> called<00:00:15.480> hexanes<00:00:16.020> the

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
wax basically it's called hexanes the

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.930 
wax basically it's called hexanes the
chemical<00:00:16.650> is<00:00:16.770> generally<00:00:17.100> used<00:00:17.310> to<00:00:17.760> split

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
chemical is generally used to split

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.599 
chemical is generally used to split
these<00:00:18.119> two<00:00:18.180> things<00:00:18.600> up<00:00:18.810> and<00:00:19.050> heat<00:00:19.619> it<00:00:20.070> changes

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
these two things up and heat it changes

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.609 
these two things up and heat it changes
the<00:00:20.730> molecular<00:00:20.850> structure<00:00:21.449> of<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:22.230> material

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
the molecular structure of the material

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.080 
the molecular structure of the material
itself<00:00:22.830> so<00:00:23.039> the<00:00:23.130> regular<00:00:23.490> chocolate<00:00:23.699> you<00:00:23.910> get

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
itself so the regular chocolate you get

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.609 
itself so the regular chocolate you get
in<00:00:24.180> supermarkets<00:00:24.840> it's<00:00:24.990> very<00:00:25.199> very<00:00:25.439> different

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
in supermarkets it's very very different

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.460 
in supermarkets it's very very different
this<00:00:26.310> is<00:00:26.369> very<00:00:26.820> high<00:00:27.090> in<00:00:27.150> magnesium<00:00:27.420> it's<00:00:28.320> one

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
this is very high in magnesium it's one

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:29.929 
this is very high in magnesium it's one
of<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:28.650> most<00:00:28.769> high<00:00:29.039> sources<00:00:29.670> of<00:00:29.760> natural

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
of the most high sources of natural

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.100 
of the most high sources of natural
magnesium<00:00:31.399> so<00:00:32.399> I<00:00:32.550> love<00:00:32.820> it<00:00:33.000> superfood<00:00:33.600> super

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
magnesium so I love it superfood super

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.510 
magnesium so I love it superfood super
strictly<00:00:34.380> the<00:00:34.590> last<00:00:34.800> thing<00:00:35.040> and<00:00:35.190> this<00:00:35.250> is<00:00:35.309> what

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
strictly the last thing and this is what

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:47.569 
strictly the last thing and this is what
the<00:00:35.610> bean<00:00:35.790> looks<00:00:36.030> like<00:00:46.039> the<00:00:47.039> last<00:00:47.309> thing<00:00:47.430> we're

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
the bean looks like the last thing we're

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.069 
the bean looks like the last thing we're
going<00:00:47.670> to<00:00:47.730> add<00:00:47.820> here<00:00:48.030> is<00:00:48.239> a<00:00:48.270> small<00:00:48.629> amount<00:00:48.960> of

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
going to add here is a small amount of

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.350 
going to add here is a small amount of
guar<00:00:49.530> gum<00:00:49.800> which<00:00:50.039> is<00:00:50.190> just<00:00:50.399> a<00:00:50.520> plant-based<00:00:51.000> gun

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
guar gum which is just a plant-based gun

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.420 
guar gum which is just a plant-based gun
the<00:00:51.780> reason<00:00:52.020> you<00:00:52.170> had<00:00:52.289> that<00:00:52.530> is<00:00:52.890> because<00:00:53.250> we're

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
the reason you had that is because we're

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.750 
the reason you had that is because we're
not<00:00:53.579> using<00:00:54.469> dairy<00:00:55.469> facts<00:00:56.070> which<00:00:56.219> was<00:00:56.399> what<00:00:56.579> ice

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
not using dairy facts which was what ice

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.869 
not using dairy facts which was what ice
cream<00:00:57.059> was<00:00:57.239> developed<00:00:57.660> from<00:00:57.870> but<00:00:58.559> we<00:00:58.730> we<00:00:59.730> don't

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
cream was developed from but we we don't

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:00.950 
cream was developed from but we we don't
want<00:01:00.059> and<00:01:00.180> we<00:01:00.270> don't<00:01:00.329> want<00:01:00.600> them<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:00.840> be

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
want and we don't want them to be

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.900 
want and we don't want them to be
crystalline<00:01:01.800> which<00:01:01.980> is<00:01:02.100> what<00:01:02.280> most<00:01:02.399> always

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
crystalline which is what most always

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:03.349 
crystalline which is what most always
all<00:01:03.180> right

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
all right

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.420 
all right
you<00:01:04.199> haven't<00:01:04.470> had<00:01:04.619> some<00:01:04.799> ice<00:01:04.920> cream<00:01:05.220> there's

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
you haven't had some ice cream there's

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:14.580 
you haven't had some ice cream there's
some<00:01:05.610> coming<00:01:05.970> over<00:01:06.270> don't<00:01:06.450> worry

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.029 

and<00:01:15.850> so<00:01:16.850> that<00:01:17.030> simply<00:01:17.689> that<00:01:18.200> is<00:01:18.380> all<00:01:18.560> ice<00:01:18.710> cream

00:01:19.029 --> 00:01:19.039 
and so that simply that is all ice cream

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:23.050 
and so that simply that is all ice cream
mix<00:01:19.280> and<00:01:19.610> it's<00:01:19.759> ready<00:01:20.350> to<00:01:21.350> freeze<00:01:22.159> and<00:01:22.850> how<00:01:23.000> we

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
mix and it's ready to freeze and how we

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:29.919 
mix and it's ready to freeze and how we
freeze<00:01:23.450> it<00:01:27.219> is<00:01:28.219> using<00:01:28.549> a<00:01:28.610> small<00:01:28.850> compressor<00:01:29.240> so

00:01:29.919 --> 00:01:29.929 
freeze it is using a small compressor so

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:31.510 
freeze it is using a small compressor so
this<00:01:30.049> is<00:01:30.170> a<00:01:30.229> compressor<00:01:30.740> based<00:01:31.039> on<00:01:31.250> ice<00:01:31.340> cream

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
this is a compressor based on ice cream

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.359 
this is a compressor based on ice cream
machine<00:01:32.200> which<00:01:33.200> is<00:01:33.380> the<00:01:33.409> smallest<00:01:33.770> impressive

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:34.369 
machine which is the smallest impressive

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:36.490 
machine which is the smallest impressive
a<00:01:34.429> slice<00:01:34.729> too<00:01:34.880> much<00:01:35.030> you<00:01:35.240> combine<00:01:35.750> and<00:01:36.229> what<00:01:36.380> we

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
a slice too much you combine and what we

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.529 
a slice too much you combine and what we
do<00:01:36.649> is<00:01:37.100> pour<00:01:37.369> this<00:01:37.520> in<00:01:37.729> here<00:01:39.850> I<00:01:40.850> mean<00:01:41.390> most

00:01:41.529 --> 00:01:41.539 
do is pour this in here I mean most

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:43.120 
do is pour this in here I mean most
women<00:01:41.630> having<00:01:42.170> was<00:01:42.289> amazing<00:01:42.619> exactly<00:01:43.039> the

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
women having was amazing exactly the

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:56.559 
women having was amazing exactly the
same<00:01:43.340> way<00:01:43.520> last<00:01:44.000> night<00:01:54.880> plug<00:01:55.880> it<00:01:56.090> in<00:01:56.209> and<00:01:56.450> in

00:01:56.559 --> 00:01:56.569 
same way last night plug it in and in

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:57.789 
same way last night plug it in and in
one<00:01:56.780> hour<00:01:56.959> I<00:01:57.110> would<00:01:57.229> have<00:01:57.349> another<00:01:57.560> fresh

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
one hour I would have another fresh

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:11.710 
one hour I would have another fresh
batch<00:01:58.039> of<00:01:58.069> ice<00:01:58.310> cream<00:01:58.640> so<00:02:09.310> so<00:02:10.310> because<00:02:11.239> of<00:02:11.569> the

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
batch of ice cream so so because of the

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.530 
batch of ice cream so so because of the
heat<00:02:11.930> and<00:02:12.230> size<00:02:13.160> in<00:02:13.340> this<00:02:13.489> room<00:02:13.760> we're<00:02:14.480> gonna
