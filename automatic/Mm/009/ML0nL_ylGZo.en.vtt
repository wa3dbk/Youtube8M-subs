00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
could be wrong might be a big walleye he

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.310 
could be wrong might be a big walleye he
was<00:00:26.820> just<00:00:26.970> barely<00:00:27.240> nipping<00:00:27.689> it<00:00:29.630> might<00:00:30.630> be<00:00:30.810> but

was just barely nipping it might be but
it<00:00:31.410> could<00:00:31.590> be<00:00:31.759> something<00:00:32.759> foul<00:00:33.030> hooked<00:00:33.239> again

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570

who<00:00:33.719> knows<00:00:35.989> it's<00:00:36.989> not<00:00:37.170> fighting<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.160> same<00:00:38.340> way

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
who knows it's not fighting the same way

who knows it's not fighting the same way
though<00:00:38.790> I<00:00:44.450> step<00:00:45.450> on<00:00:45.570> your<00:00:45.690> fish<00:00:45.870> for<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:46.920> net

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:54.610 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:01:00.220

in the last couple hours on a shiner but

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:04.689 
in the last couple hours on a shiner but
just<00:01:02.809> tapped<00:01:03.050> it<00:01:03.199> for<00:01:03.379> a<00:01:03.440> second<00:01:03.980> and<00:01:04.129> they

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:04.699 
just tapped it for a second and they

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:06.820 
just tapped it for a second and they
just<00:01:04.879> tap<00:01:05.150> this<00:01:05.330> one<00:01:05.510> the<00:01:05.960> fish<00:01:06.409> just<00:01:06.590> tapped

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830 
just tap this one the fish just tapped

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.940 
just tap this one the fish just tapped
this<00:01:06.979> one<00:01:07.190> for<00:01:07.400> a<00:01:07.430> really<00:01:08.229> short<00:01:09.229> amount<00:01:09.500> of

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
this one for a really short amount of

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:15.160 
this one for a really short amount of
time<00:01:11.110> too<00:01:12.110> but<00:01:12.440> I<00:01:12.710> nailed<00:01:13.550> them<00:01:14.170> it's

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
time too but I nailed them it's

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:21.910 
time too but I nailed them it's
definitely<00:01:15.619> a<00:01:15.650> big<00:01:15.830> fish<00:01:20.650> that's<00:01:21.650> another

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
definitely a big fish that's another

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:27.850 
definitely a big fish that's another
carp<00:01:22.340> that<00:01:24.940> fell<00:01:25.940> hook<00:01:26.060> him<00:01:26.240> this<00:01:26.360> time<00:01:26.860> that

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 
carp that fell hook him this time that

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:29.440 
carp that fell hook him this time that
might<00:01:28.009> be<00:01:28.130> I<00:01:28.369> might<00:01:28.910> have<00:01:29.030> got<00:01:29.149> him<00:01:29.270> in<00:01:29.360> the

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
might be I might have got him in the

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.300 
might be I might have got him in the
mouth<00:01:31.780> yeah<00:01:32.780> another<00:01:32.990> big<00:01:33.229> carp<00:01:33.530> it's<00:01:34.160> gonna

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
mouth yeah another big carp it's gonna

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:35.469 
mouth yeah another big carp it's gonna
say<00:01:34.430> if<00:01:34.520> this<00:01:34.610> is<00:01:34.670> a<00:01:34.789> walleye<00:01:35.000> it's<00:01:35.240> a<00:01:35.300> big

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
say if this is a walleye it's a big

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:37.419 
say if this is a walleye it's a big
walleye<00:01:35.690> I<00:01:36.020> think<00:01:36.679> I<00:01:36.770> got<00:01:36.950> him<00:01:37.100> in<00:01:37.160> the<00:01:37.250> mouth

00:01:37.419 --> 00:01:37.429 
walleye I think I got him in the mouth

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:47.190 
walleye I think I got him in the mouth
there<00:01:37.640> yeah<00:01:38.090> he<00:01:38.240> ate<00:01:38.390> it<00:01:38.570> that<00:01:38.750> is<00:01:39.229> weird

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.529 

not<00:01:48.200> that<00:01:48.440> big<00:01:48.679> but<00:01:48.710> I<00:01:49.190> mean<00:01:50.149> if<00:01:50.210> this<00:01:50.330> is<00:01:50.390> a

00:01:50.529 --> 00:01:50.539 
not that big but I mean if this is a

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:52.690 
not that big but I mean if this is a
walleye<00:01:50.780> would<00:01:51.110> have<00:01:51.200> been<00:01:51.320> a<00:01:51.350> trophy<00:01:51.800> for

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
walleye would have been a trophy for

00:01:52.700 --> 00:02:01.109 
walleye would have been a trophy for
sure<00:01:58.060> not<00:01:59.060> that<00:01:59.270> big<00:01:59.450> for<00:01:59.659> a<00:01:59.689> carp<00:01:59.930> though<00:02:00.110> but

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:01.119 
sure not that big for a carp though but

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:04.480 
sure not that big for a carp though but
decent<00:02:02.710> that<00:02:03.710> is<00:02:03.829> so<00:02:04.040> strange

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
decent that is so strange

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.979 
decent that is so strange
look<00:02:05.270> at<00:02:05.360> that<00:02:05.920> he<00:02:06.920> ate<00:02:07.100> the<00:02:07.280> minnow<00:02:07.899> right<00:02:08.899> in

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:08.989 
look at that he ate the minnow right in

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:14.729 
look at that he ate the minnow right in
his<00:02:09.110> mouth<00:02:11.650> really<00:02:12.650> seems<00:02:12.980> like<00:02:13.070> he<00:02:13.220> ate<00:02:13.400> it<00:02:13.579> I

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:14.739 
his mouth really seems like he ate it I

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:16.840 
his mouth really seems like he ate it I
don't<00:02:15.739> think<00:02:15.890> he<00:02:15.950> ran<00:02:16.160> into<00:02:16.489> it<00:02:16.610> with<00:02:16.730> his

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
don't think he ran into it with his

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.350 
don't think he ran into it with his
mouth<00:02:17.350> I'm<00:02:18.350> in<00:02:18.530> Oh<00:02:18.620> swimming<00:02:18.950> around<00:02:19.360> pretty

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
mouth I'm in Oh swimming around pretty

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.670 
mouth I'm in Oh swimming around pretty
unlikely<00:02:21.640> that's<00:02:22.640> crazy<00:02:23.030> I<00:02:23.360> was<00:02:24.320> really

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
unlikely that's crazy I was really

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.270 
unlikely that's crazy I was really
hoping<00:02:24.950> you<00:02:25.070> were<00:02:25.160> a<00:02:25.190> trophy<00:02:25.579> walleye<00:02:27.280> decent

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
hoping you were a trophy walleye decent

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.729 
hoping you were a trophy walleye decent
curb<00:02:28.690> measure<00:02:29.690> I'm<00:02:29.870> quick<00:02:30.079> and<00:02:30.290> let<00:02:30.470> him<00:02:30.560> go<00:02:30.709> I

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
curb measure I'm quick and let him go I

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:36.460 
curb measure I'm quick and let him go I
guess<00:02:34.360> my<00:02:35.360> father<00:02:35.570> winged<00:02:35.900> him<00:02:36.049> he's<00:02:36.200> not<00:02:36.320> very

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
guess my father winged him he's not very

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.430 
guess my father winged him he's not very
heavy<00:02:37.239> 15<00:02:38.239> pounds<00:02:38.660> maybe<00:02:38.840> or<00:02:39.140> something<00:02:39.320> like

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
heavy 15 pounds maybe or something like

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.569 
heavy 15 pounds maybe or something like
that<00:02:40.030> probably<00:02:41.030> thirty<00:02:41.510> inch<00:02:41.720> here<00:02:42.579> right

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:43.579 
that probably thirty inch here right

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:47.000 
that probably thirty inch here right
around<00:02:43.790> there<00:02:44.769> yeah

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
around there yeah

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:54.500 
around there yeah
28<00:02:48.010> to<00:02:48.189> 30<00:02:48.430> I'd<00:02:48.640> guess<00:02:51.930> 31<00:02:52.930> 31<00:02:53.530> and<00:02:53.769> a<00:02:53.829> half

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
28 to 30 I'd guess 31 31 and a half

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.000 
28 to 30 I'd guess 31 31 and a half
actually<00:02:55.510> almost<00:02:56.049> almost<00:02:56.409> 32<00:02:57.299> pretty<00:02:58.299> fat

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
actually almost almost 32 pretty fat

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.800 
actually almost almost 32 pretty fat
side<00:03:00.010> up<00:03:00.040> eggs<00:03:00.340> right<00:03:00.610> now<00:03:01.319> cool

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
side up eggs right now cool

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:09.119 
side up eggs right now cool
not<00:03:04.810> very<00:03:05.079> I<00:03:06.030> didn't<00:03:07.030> really<00:03:07.239> expect<00:03:07.540> this<00:03:08.129> so

00:03:09.119 --> 00:03:09.129 
not very I didn't really expect this so

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:13.770 
not very I didn't really expect this so
many<00:03:09.310> carp<00:03:09.579> I<00:03:12.150> don't<00:03:13.150> really<00:03:13.269> have<00:03:13.420> a<00:03:13.450> spot

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
many carp I don't really have a spot

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.289 
many carp I don't really have a spot
where<00:03:13.930> I'm<00:03:13.989> close<00:03:14.260> to<00:03:14.409> the<00:03:14.500> bank<00:03:14.739> but<00:03:15.180> there<00:03:16.180> he

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:16.299 
where I'm close to the bank but there he
