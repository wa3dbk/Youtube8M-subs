showdown we're going to take the GoPro
battery<00:00:05.090> versus<00:00:05.479> the<00:00:05.599> wasabi<00:00:06.139> battery<00:00:06.620> i'm

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:06.800 
battery versus the wasabi battery i'm

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.549 
battery versus the wasabi battery i'm
using<00:00:07.309> the<00:00:07.609> LCD<00:00:08.059> touch<00:00:08.300> bacpac<00:00:08.660> with<00:00:09.139> this<00:00:09.320> one

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:09.559 
using the LCD touch bacpac with this one

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:11.199 
using the LCD touch bacpac with this one
so<00:00:10.009> that's<00:00:10.160> going<00:00:10.309> to<00:00:10.370> take<00:00:10.459> more<00:00:10.639> battery<00:00:10.999> and

00:00:11.199 --> 00:00:11.209 
so that's going to take more battery and

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:12.730 
so that's going to take more battery and
we're<00:00:11.780> going<00:00:11.900> to<00:00:11.929> try<00:00:12.169> out<00:00:12.289> three<00:00:12.469> different

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:12.740 
we're going to try out three different

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.390 
we're going to try out three different
settings<00:00:13.129> and<00:00:13.400> see<00:00:14.269> how<00:00:14.509> they<00:00:14.629> compare<00:00:15.400> first

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:16.400 
settings and see how they compare first

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.130 
settings and see how they compare first
step<00:00:16.610> here<00:00:16.940> we're<00:00:17.360> going<00:00:17.480> to<00:00:17.540> go<00:00:17.720> ahead<00:00:17.750> and

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:18.140 
step here we're going to go ahead and

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.350 
step here we're going to go ahead and
put<00:00:18.380> in<00:00:18.410> the<00:00:18.620> wasabi<00:00:18.920> battery<00:00:19.340> we're<00:00:20.210> going<00:00:20.300> to

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:20.360 
put in the wasabi battery we're going to

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.710 
put in the wasabi battery we're going to
set<00:00:20.600> it<00:00:20.630> to<00:00:20.900> 1080<00:00:21.320> 60<00:00:22.070> frames<00:00:22.250> per<00:00:22.370> second<00:00:22.910> it's

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:23.720 
set it to 1080 60 frames per second it's

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.050 
set it to 1080 60 frames per second it's
going<00:00:23.900> to<00:00:23.960> show<00:00:24.200> us<00:00:24.410> it<00:00:24.650> claims<00:00:25.250> to<00:00:25.490> give<00:00:25.700> us<00:00:25.850> 0

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:26.060 
going to show us it claims to give us 0

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.810 
going to show us it claims to give us 0
1<00:00:26.420> hour<00:00:26.630> and<00:00:26.720> seven<00:00:27.380> minutes<00:00:27.710> 44<00:00:28.490> seconds

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:30.790 
1 hour and seven minutes 44 seconds
record<00:00:29.120> time<00:00:29.150> what<00:00:29.840> we'll<00:00:29.990> see<00:00:30.170> is<00:00:30.320> an<00:00:30.410> actual

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:30.800

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
to set this one up here for seven twenty

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.149 
to set this one up here for seven twenty
120<00:01:13.369> frames<00:01:13.759> per<00:01:13.939> second<00:01:14.680> it's<00:01:15.680> going<00:01:15.890> to<00:01:15.979> show

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:16.159 
120 frames per second it's going to show

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:18.639 
120 frames per second it's going to show
us<00:01:16.340> that<00:01:16.369> it's<00:01:16.670> going<00:01:16.789> to<00:01:16.880> give<00:01:17.060> us<00:01:17.090> a<00:01:17.390> 10<00:01:17.869> 7<00:01:18.229> 45

00:01:18.639 --> 00:01:18.649 
us that it's going to give us a 10 7 45

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:22.060 
us that it's going to give us a 10 7 45
begin<00:01:19.450> recording<00:01:20.450> time<00:01:20.780> here<00:01:21.770> we're<00:01:21.950> only

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.070 
begin recording time here we're only

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.609 
begin recording time here we're only
going<00:01:22.280> to<00:01:22.369> see<00:01:22.579> 48<00:01:23.090> minutes<00:01:23.450> and<00:01:23.689> 55<00:01:24.110> seconds

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619 
going to see 48 minutes and 55 seconds

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:27.690 
going to see 48 minutes and 55 seconds
so<00:01:24.860> that's<00:01:25.039> significant<00:01:25.969> difference<00:01:26.299> there

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 
so that's significant difference there

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.429 
so that's significant difference there
swap<00:01:28.700> it<00:01:28.850> out<00:01:28.969> and<00:01:29.240> we'll<00:01:29.600> get<00:01:29.810> a<00:01:30.049> GoPro

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:30.439 
swap it out and we'll get a GoPro

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:38.440 
swap it out and we'll get a GoPro
battery<00:01:34.840> it's<00:01:35.840> going<00:01:36.140> to<00:01:36.200> be<00:01:36.380> 7<00:01:36.770> 20<00:01:37.130> out<00:01:38.119> of<00:01:38.180> 20

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
battery it's going to be 7 20 out of 20

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.870 
battery it's going to be 7 20 out of 20
frames<00:01:38.570> per<00:01:38.810> second<00:01:39.170> again<00:01:39.430> it's<00:01:40.430> gonna<00:01:40.579> claim

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
frames per second again it's gonna claim

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.599 
frames per second again it's gonna claim
again<00:01:41.359> 10<00:01:41.659> 7<00:01:41.990> 45<00:01:42.409> with<00:01:42.710> that<00:01:42.890> with<00:01:43.310> each

again 10 7 45 with that with each

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:47.679 
again 10 7 45 with that with each
battery<00:01:44.200> and<00:01:45.729> we<00:01:46.729> actually<00:01:46.909> get<00:01:47.299> an<00:01:47.450> actual

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:47.689 
battery and we actually get an actual

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:50.440

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
are going to set this one up for 1080 30

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:12.650 
are going to set this one up for 1080 30
frames<00:02:11.390> per<00:02:11.510> second

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
frames per second

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.110

wasabi batteries are great they're a
little<00:03:08.070> bit<00:03:08.220> cheaper<00:03:08.550> you<00:03:09.060> may<00:03:09.210> lose<00:03:09.360> a<00:03:09.420> little

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
little bit cheaper you may lose a little

little bit cheaper you may lose a little
bit<00:03:09.690> of<00:03:09.840> time<00:03:09.990> but<00:03:10.170> they're<00:03:10.320> still<00:03:10.410> great

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:10.710 
bit of time but they're still great

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:12.290 
bit of time but they're still great
