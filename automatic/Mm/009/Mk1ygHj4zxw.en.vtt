00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.409 

so<00:00:00.780> last<00:00:01.290> time<00:00:01.650> we<00:00:02.100> saw<00:00:02.399> that<00:00:02.730> the<00:00:03.090> P<00:00:03.389> I

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:03.419 
so last time we saw that the P I

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.650 
so last time we saw that the P I
regulator<00:00:04.259> or<00:00:04.529> it's<00:00:05.210> slightly<00:00:06.210> more

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
regulator or it's slightly more

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.730 
regulator or it's slightly more
elaborate<00:00:07.500> brother<00:00:07.980> the<00:00:08.309> PID<00:00:08.639> regulator<00:00:09.740> was

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
elaborate brother the PID regulator was

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.919 
elaborate brother the PID regulator was
enough<00:00:11.309> to<00:00:11.639> make<00:00:11.670> the<00:00:11.969> cruise<00:00:12.150> controller<00:00:12.540> do

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
enough to make the cruise controller do

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.870 
enough to make the cruise controller do
what<00:00:13.110> it<00:00:13.200> should<00:00:13.230> do<00:00:13.590> which<00:00:13.830> is<00:00:14.040> achieve

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
what it should do which is achieve

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.510 
what it should do which is achieve
stability<00:00:15.540> tracking<00:00:16.529> and<00:00:16.740> parameter

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520

robustness<00:00:17.880> today<00:00:18.840> I<00:00:18.869> want<00:00:19.170> to<00:00:19.230> talk<00:00:19.350> a<00:00:19.410> little

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
robustness today I want to talk a little

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.550 
robustness today I want to talk a little
bit<00:00:19.770> more<00:00:20.100> about<00:00:20.930> PID<00:00:21.930> control<00:00:22.320> and<00:00:22.500> the

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
bit more about PID control and the

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.920 
bit more about PID control and the
reason<00:00:22.859> for<00:00:22.980> that<00:00:23.039> is<00:00:23.430> this<00:00:23.939> regulator<00:00:24.660> is

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
reason for that is this regulator is

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.470 
reason for that is this regulator is
such<00:00:25.529> an<00:00:25.859> important<00:00:26.580> regulator<00:00:26.880> or

the hood in almost all controllers and

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.380 
the hood in almost all controllers and
there<00:00:37.710> are<00:00:37.800> really<00:00:37.950> three<00:00:38.309> knobs<00:00:38.910> you<00:00:39.300> can

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
there are really three knobs you can

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.440 
there are really three knobs you can
tweak<00:00:39.809> here<00:00:40.079> one<00:00:40.649> is<00:00:40.829> KP<00:00:41.550> which<00:00:42.149> is<00:00:42.300> the

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
tweak here one is KP which is the

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.889 
tweak here one is KP which is the
proportional<00:00:43.140> gain<00:00:43.430> the<00:00:44.430> other<00:00:44.550> is<00:00:44.670> ki<00:00:45.030> which

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
proportional gain the other is ki which

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.830 
proportional gain the other is ki which
is<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.140> integral<00:00:46.440> gain<00:00:46.890> and<00:00:47.219> then<00:00:47.610> KD<00:00:48.030> which

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
is the integral gain and then KD which

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.990 
is the integral gain and then KD which
is<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.140> derivative<00:00:49.680> gain<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:50.160> I<00:00:50.579> want<00:00:50.940> to

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
is the derivative gain and I want to

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.610 
is the derivative gain and I want to
talk<00:00:51.120> a<00:00:51.149> little<00:00:51.420> bit<00:00:51.600> about<00:00:51.629> what<00:00:52.320> are<00:00:52.469> the

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
talk a little bit about what are the

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.639 
talk a little bit about what are the
effects<00:00:53.280> of<00:00:53.719> these<00:00:54.719> games

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
effects of these games

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.299 
effects of these games
well<00:00:56.010> first<00:00:56.699> of<00:00:56.850> all<00:00:56.940> P<00:00:57.270> as<00:00:57.930> we<00:00:58.170> saw<00:00:58.379> it's<00:00:58.980> a

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
well first of all P as we saw it's a

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.369 
well first of all P as we saw it's a
contributor<00:01:00.059> to<00:01:00.090> stability<00:01:00.480> in<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.140> sense

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
contributor to stability in the sense

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.100 
contributor to stability in the sense
that<00:01:01.500> it<00:01:02.070> makes<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:02.789> system<00:01:03.000> not<00:01:03.629> guaranteed

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
that it makes the system not guaranteed

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.990 
that it makes the system not guaranteed
but<00:01:04.470> it's<00:01:04.650> helping<00:01:04.979> out<00:01:05.159> make<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.610> system

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
but it's helping out make the system

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.700 
but it's helping out make the system
stable<00:01:06.299> and<00:01:06.630> it's<00:01:06.810> it's<00:01:07.290> making<00:01:07.470> it

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
stable and it's it's making it

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.500 
stable and it's it's making it
responsive<00:01:08.400> in<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.610> sense<00:01:08.790> that<00:01:08.850> you<00:01:09.060> respond

responsive in the sense that you respond

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.500 
responsive in the sense that you respond

it<00:01:15.240> drives<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:16.020> system<00:01:16.229> towards<00:01:17.220> that<00:01:17.400> value

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
it drives the system towards that value

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.640 
it drives the system towards that value
I'm<00:01:18.479> calling<00:01:18.810> it<00:01:18.900> medium<00:01:19.409> rate

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
I'm calling it medium rate

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.190 
I'm calling it medium rate
responsiveness<00:01:20.400> because<00:01:20.850> it's<00:01:21.330> not<00:01:21.570> super

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
responsiveness because it's not super

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.580 
responsiveness because it's not super
fast<00:01:22.439> and<00:01:23.270> the<00:01:24.270> speed<00:01:24.570> in<00:01:24.840> fact<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.200> rate<00:01:25.380> of

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
fast and the speed in fact the rate of

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.620 
fast and the speed in fact the rate of
responsiveness<00:01:26.220> is<00:01:26.549> a<00:01:26.790> function<00:01:27.240> of<00:01:27.299> how<00:01:27.420> big

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
responsiveness is a function of how big

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.590 
responsiveness is a function of how big
KP<00:01:28.080> is<00:01:28.259> but<00:01:28.829> as<00:01:28.950> you<00:01:29.159> saw<00:01:29.490> it<00:01:29.820> wasn't<00:01:30.270> typically

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
KP is but as you saw it wasn't typically

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.620 
KP is but as you saw it wasn't typically
enough<00:01:30.840> to<00:01:31.200> achieve<00:01:31.759> tracking<00:01:32.759> well<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.600> I

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
enough to achieve tracking well the I

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.520 
enough to achieve tracking well the I
component<00:01:33.990> is<00:01:35.030> really<00:01:36.049> good<00:01:37.049> for<00:01:37.259> tracking

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
component is really good for tracking

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.149 
component is really good for tracking
and<00:01:37.829> in<00:01:37.920> fact<00:01:38.159> if<00:01:38.490> your<00:01:38.970> system<00:01:39.390> is<00:01:39.479> stable

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:40.159 
and in fact if your system is stable

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:43.639 
and in fact if your system is stable
then<00:01:41.159> having<00:01:42.090> an<00:01:42.180> AI<00:01:42.329> component<00:01:42.990> is<00:01:43.170> enough<00:01:43.470> to

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
then having an AI component is enough to

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.130 
then having an AI component is enough to
ensure<00:01:43.950> tracking<00:01:44.579> in<00:01:44.729> almost<00:01:45.000> all<00:01:45.180> cases<00:01:45.420> it's

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
ensure tracking in almost all cases it's

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.010 
ensure tracking in almost all cases it's
also<00:01:46.380> extremely<00:01:46.970> effective<00:01:47.970> at<00:01:48.090> rejecting

also extremely effective at rejecting

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.440 
also extremely effective at rejecting

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
disturbances so their internal part is a

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
very effective part to have in your

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.950 
very effective part to have in your
controller<00:01:56.040> now<00:01:56.280> it's<00:01:56.520> much<00:01:56.729> slower<00:01:56.909> in<00:01:57.570> the

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
controller now it's much slower in the

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.840 
controller now it's much slower in the
sense<00:01:58.170> that<00:01:58.229> you<00:01:58.409> have<00:01:58.530> to<00:01:58.619> accumulate<00:01:59.219> over

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
sense that you have to accumulate over

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.359 
sense that you have to accumulate over

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
time errors to respond to them because

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.700 
time errors to respond to them because
it's<00:02:02.549> an<00:02:02.640> integral<00:02:02.880> so<00:02:03.509> it's<00:02:03.750> it's<00:02:03.960> response

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
it's an integral so it's it's response

no<00:02:18.239> you<00:02:18.300> have<00:02:18.540> to<00:02:18.690> be<00:02:18.780> a<00:02:18.810> little<00:02:18.959> careful<00:02:19.440> in

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
no you have to be a little careful in

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.920 
no you have to be a little careful in
how<00:02:19.680> you<00:02:19.739> actually<00:02:20.250> select<00:02:20.599> select<00:02:21.599> these

how you actually select select these

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.680

gains<00:02:22.380> now<00:02:22.980> the<00:02:23.430> D<00:02:23.640> part<00:02:23.940> well

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
gains now the D part well

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.410 
gains now the D part well
since<00:02:25.470> it's<00:02:25.680> not<00:02:25.980> responding<00:02:26.760> to<00:02:26.940> actual

values<00:02:27.870> the<00:02:28.620> error<00:02:28.770> values<00:02:29.130> but<00:02:29.280> the<00:02:29.370> changes

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
values the error values but the changes

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.150 
values the error values but the changes
in<00:02:30.000> their<00:02:30.150> values<00:02:30.540> it's<00:02:30.989> typically<00:02:31.440> faster

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
in their values it's typically faster

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.340 
in their values it's typically faster
responsiveness<00:02:33.030> so<00:02:33.120> something<00:02:33.810> is<00:02:33.900> about<00:02:34.170> to

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
responsiveness so something is about to

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:35.930 
responsiveness so something is about to
happen<00:02:34.440> while<00:02:34.800> the<00:02:34.920> rate<00:02:35.100> is<00:02:35.340> changing<00:02:35.370> so

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
happen while the rate is changing so

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.970 
happen while the rate is changing so
that<00:02:36.120> the<00:02:36.270> derivative<00:02:36.540> part<00:02:37.140> kicks<00:02:37.770> in

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
that the derivative part kicks in

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.759 
that the derivative part kicks in
typically<00:02:38.550> faster<00:02:39.110> now<00:02:40.110> there<00:02:40.410> is<00:02:40.530> a<00:02:40.560> little

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
typically faster now there is a little

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:42.830 
typically faster now there is a little
caveat<00:02:41.310> to<00:02:41.340> this<00:02:41.580> and<00:02:41.850> that's<00:02:42.030> the<00:02:42.540> derivative

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
caveat to this and that's the derivative

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.630 
caveat to this and that's the derivative
is<00:02:43.319> sensitive<00:02:43.890> to<00:02:43.950> noise

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
is sensitive to noise

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.699 
is sensitive to noise
because<00:02:45.209> if<00:02:45.720> you<00:02:45.870> have<00:02:46.019> a<00:02:46.050> signal<00:02:46.500> that's

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
because if you have a signal that's

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.740 
because if you have a signal that's
noisy<00:02:46.920> then<00:02:47.459> if<00:02:47.670> you<00:02:47.760> compute<00:02:48.060> the<00:02:48.209> derivative

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
noisy then if you compute the derivative

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.660 
noisy then if you compute the derivative
of<00:02:48.930> that<00:02:49.050> signal<00:02:49.530> you're<00:02:49.890> gonna<00:02:50.069> get<00:02:50.250> rather

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
of that signal you're gonna get rather

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.400 
of that signal you're gonna get rather
aggressive<00:02:51.420> derivatives<00:02:51.989> that<00:02:52.110> don't

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
aggressive derivatives that don't

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.460 
aggressive derivatives that don't
necessarily<00:02:53.660> correspond<00:02:54.660> to<00:02:54.780> what<00:02:55.080> the<00:02:55.230> non

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
necessarily correspond to what the non

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.680 
necessarily correspond to what the non
noisy<00:02:55.799> signal<00:02:56.340> would<00:02:56.459> be<00:02:56.610> so<00:02:56.880> you<00:02:57.269> have<00:02:57.420> to<00:02:57.569> be

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
noisy signal would be so you have to be

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.780 
noisy signal would be so you have to be
a<00:02:57.720> little<00:02:58.290> careful<00:02:58.530> with<00:02:58.980> the<00:02:59.069> D<00:02:59.220> parts<00:02:59.610> and

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
a little careful with the D parts and

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.630 
a little careful with the D parts and
making<00:03:00.510> KD<00:03:00.930> too<00:03:01.350> large<00:03:01.560> is<00:03:01.860> typically<00:03:02.280> an

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
making KD too large is typically an

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.120 
making KD too large is typically an
invitation<00:03:03.630> to<00:03:03.870> disaster<00:03:04.200> because<00:03:04.920> you're

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
invitation to disaster because you're

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:09.710 
invitation to disaster because you're
you're<00:03:05.610> overreacting<00:03:06.030> to<00:03:06.660> to<00:03:07.200> noise<00:03:07.440> so<00:03:08.720> the

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
you're overreacting to to noise so the

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.930 
you're overreacting to to noise so the
last<00:03:09.989> thing<00:03:10.380> I<00:03:10.620> want<00:03:11.100> to<00:03:11.190> point<00:03:11.519> out<00:03:11.700> though<00:03:11.910> is

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
last thing I want to point out though is

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.610 
last thing I want to point out though is
that<00:03:12.180> when<00:03:12.569> you<00:03:12.660> put<00:03:12.840> this<00:03:12.930> together<00:03:13.140> you<00:03:13.380> get

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
that when you put this together you get

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.580

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
not be enough by itself so we need to do

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.280 
not be enough by itself so we need to do
a<00:03:55.890> lot<00:03:56.130> of<00:03:56.160> more<00:03:56.459> thinking<00:03:57.420> and<00:03:57.569> modeling<00:03:58.079> to

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
a lot of more thinking and modeling to

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.440 
a lot of more thinking and modeling to
to<00:03:58.530> use<00:03:58.739> it<00:03:58.950> and<00:03:59.160> at<00:03:59.790> this<00:03:59.970> point<00:04:00.150> we<00:04:00.359> actually

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
to use it and at this point we actually

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.240 
to use it and at this point we actually
don't<00:04:00.780> really<00:04:01.500> know<00:04:01.620> how<00:04:01.769> to<00:04:01.829> pick<00:04:02.069> these

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
don't really know how to pick these

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.819 
don't really know how to pick these
gains<00:04:02.519> however<00:04:03.209> I<00:04:03.750> want<00:04:04.260> to<00:04:04.350> point<00:04:04.470> out<00:04:04.620> that

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:04.829 
gains however I want to point out that

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:07.520 
gains however I want to point out that
this<00:04:04.920> is<00:04:05.190> a<00:04:05.489> very<00:04:06.180> very<00:04:06.450> useful<00:04:06.780> type<00:04:07.350> of

this is a very very useful type of

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.780 
this is a very very useful type of
controller<00:04:08.060> and<00:04:09.440> since<00:04:10.440> it<00:04:10.560> is<00:04:10.650> a<00:04:10.859> feedback

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
controller and since it is a feedback

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.479 
controller and since it is a feedback
law<00:04:12.090> because<00:04:12.540> it<00:04:12.690> depends<00:04:13.109> on<00:04:13.200> the<00:04:13.260> error<00:04:13.530> it

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489 
law because it depends on the error it

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:16.550 
law because it depends on the error it
actually<00:04:14.970> fights<00:04:15.299> uncertainty<00:04:16.229> in<00:04:16.289> model

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
actually fights uncertainty in model

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.440 
actually fights uncertainty in model

but still we seem to do
well<00:04:27.690> when<00:04:28.080> we<00:04:28.169> design<00:04:28.500> controllers<00:04:29.190> for<00:04:29.460> a

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
well when we design controllers for a

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.170 
well when we design controllers for a

wide range of these parameters so having

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.210 
wide range of these parameters so having

and<00:04:35.460> in<00:04:35.699> fact<00:04:35.909> we<00:04:36.360> had<00:04:36.569> a<00:04:36.599> PID<00:04:37.050> regulator<00:04:37.440> for

this model that we've already seen and I

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.279 
this model that we've already seen and I

even<00:04:51.150> put<00:04:51.419> R<00:04:51.599> equals<00:04:51.870> to<00:04:51.990> 1<00:04:52.020> so<00:04:52.409> we're<00:04:52.530> gonna<00:04:52.620> go

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.770 
even put R equals to 1 so we're gonna go

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.909 
even put R equals to 1 so we're gonna go
one<00:04:53.159> mile<00:04:53.370> per<00:04:53.699> hour<00:04:54.440> let's<00:04:55.440> say<00:04:55.500> 1<00:04:55.650> meter<00:04:55.800> per

00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:55.919 
one mile per hour let's say 1 meter per

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:57.260 
one mile per hour let's say 1 meter per
second<00:04:56.400> it<00:04:56.460> really<00:04:56.490> doesn't<00:04:56.940> matter<00:04:57.090> but

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.270 
second it really doesn't matter but

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:59.119 
second it really doesn't matter but
these<00:04:57.690> are<00:04:57.810> arbitrary<00:04:57.960> values<00:04:58.620> just<00:04:58.889> so

00:04:59.119 --> 00:04:59.129 
these are arbitrary values just so

00:04:59.129 --> 00:05:00.890 
these are arbitrary values just so
you'll<00:04:59.280> see<00:04:59.490> what's<00:04:59.699> going<00:04:59.909> on<00:05:00.060> so<00:05:00.270> if<00:05:00.630> we

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:00.900 
you'll see what's going on so if we

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.129 
you'll see what's going on so if we
start<00:05:01.199> with<00:05:01.830> our<00:05:01.860> friend<00:05:02.250> the<00:05:02.880> P<00:05:03.180> regulator<00:05:03.720> so

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:04.139 
start with our friend the P regulator so

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:06.499 
start with our friend the P regulator so
we<00:05:04.259> have<00:05:04.380> KP<00:05:04.830> equals<00:05:05.099> to<00:05:05.250> 1<00:05:05.490> here<00:05:05.909> and<00:05:06.060> all<00:05:06.360> the

00:05:06.499 --> 00:05:06.509 
we have KP equals to 1 here and all the

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:09.439 
we have KP equals to 1 here and all the
other<00:05:06.539> gains<00:05:06.900> are<00:05:07.199> zero<00:05:07.530> than<00:05:07.919> well<00:05:08.550> we<00:05:09.240> don't

00:05:09.439 --> 00:05:09.449 
other gains are zero than well we don't

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:11.300 
other gains are zero than well we don't
actually<00:05:09.659> make<00:05:10.020> it<00:05:10.199> up<00:05:10.319> to<00:05:10.500> one<00:05:10.710> we<00:05:10.949> only<00:05:11.069> make

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:11.310 
actually make it up to one we only make

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:13.430 
actually make it up to one we only make
it<00:05:11.340> to<00:05:11.639> two<00:05:11.909> zero<00:05:12.150> point<00:05:12.360> one<00:05:12.569> this<00:05:13.110> we<00:05:13.289> had

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.440 
it to two zero point one this we had

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.820 
it to two zero point one this we had
already<00:05:13.710> seen<00:05:14.310> so<00:05:14.909> the<00:05:15.150> P<00:05:15.389> part<00:05:15.659> by<00:05:15.990> itself<00:05:16.409> was

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:16.830 
already seen so the P part by itself was

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:20.620 
already seen so the P part by itself was
not<00:05:17.069> enough<00:05:17.340> to<00:05:17.759> to<00:05:18.090> both<00:05:19.050> be<00:05:19.409> stable<00:05:19.889> and

not enough to to both be stable and
achieve<00:05:21.630> tracking<00:05:22.050> well<00:05:22.680> let's<00:05:23.610> hook<00:05:23.789> in<00:05:23.940> the

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.060

00:05:27.529 --> 00:05:27.539 
eye part cruise controller again KP is 1

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:31.159 
eye part cruise controller again KP is 1
ki<00:05:28.349> is<00:05:28.620> 1<00:05:28.979> and<00:05:29.310> now<00:05:29.490> we're<00:05:30.419> having<00:05:30.690> a<00:05:30.780> very<00:05:30.990> nice

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:31.169 
ki is 1 and now we're having a very nice

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:32.870 
ki is 1 and now we're having a very nice
so-called<00:05:31.830> step<00:05:32.190> response<00:05:32.430> which<00:05:32.849> means

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:32.880 
so-called step response which means

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:34.670 
so-called step response which means
we're<00:05:33.330> responding<00:05:33.690> we're<00:05:33.990> waking<00:05:34.139> up<00:05:34.469> and

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:34.680 
we're responding we're waking up and

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:35.959 
we're responding we're waking up and
then<00:05:34.800> we're<00:05:34.919> hitting<00:05:35.159> it<00:05:35.219> with<00:05:35.400> a<00:05:35.430> step<00:05:35.729> in

00:05:35.959 --> 00:05:35.969 
then we're hitting it with a step in

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:39.770 
then we're hitting it with a step in
this<00:05:36.060> case<00:05:36.840> a<00:05:36.870> step<00:05:37.229> of<00:05:37.409> height<00:05:38.099> 1<00:05:38.400> or<00:05:38.699> 70<00:05:39.690> if

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:39.780 
this case a step of height 1 or 70 if

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:42.920 
this case a step of height 1 or 70 if
it's<00:05:39.930> 70<00:05:40.229> miles<00:05:40.409> per<00:05:40.500> hour<00:05:41.449> so<00:05:42.449> then<00:05:42.630> this

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:42.930 
it's 70 miles per hour so then this

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:45.019 
it's 70 miles per hour so then this
thing<00:05:43.199> makes<00:05:43.560> its<00:05:43.770> way<00:05:43.800> up<00:05:43.919> and<00:05:44.370> it<00:05:44.520> stays<00:05:44.759> up

00:05:45.019 --> 00:05:45.029 
thing makes its way up and it stays up

00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:47.689 
thing makes its way up and it stays up
there<00:05:45.409> perfect<00:05:46.409> so<00:05:46.919> this<00:05:47.009> is<00:05:47.159> actually<00:05:47.430> a<00:05:47.460> good

00:05:47.689 --> 00:05:47.699 
there perfect so this is actually a good

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:51.260 
there perfect so this is actually a good
and<00:05:47.969> successful<00:05:48.090> design<00:05:48.810> right<00:05:49.229> there<00:05:49.400> now<00:05:50.400> if

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:51.270 
and successful design right there now if

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:53.089 
and successful design right there now if
this<00:05:51.449> is<00:05:51.599> so<00:05:51.630> good<00:05:51.990> why<00:05:52.229> don't<00:05:52.409> we<00:05:52.500> make<00:05:52.680> ki

00:05:53.089 --> 00:05:53.099 
this is so good why don't we make ki

00:05:53.099 --> 00:05:54.800 
this is so good why don't we make ki
higher<00:05:53.699> to<00:05:54.000> make<00:05:54.029> it<00:05:54.270> even<00:05:54.449> better

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:54.810 
higher to make it even better

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:58.879 
higher to make it even better
well<00:05:54.960> if<00:05:55.289> I<00:05:55.580> crank<00:05:56.580> up<00:05:56.849> ki<00:05:57.210> to<00:05:57.419> 10<00:05:57.990> then<00:05:58.680> all<00:05:58.860> of

00:05:58.879 --> 00:05:58.889 
well if I crank up ki to 10 then all of

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:01.219 
well if I crank up ki to 10 then all of
a<00:05:59.039> sudden<00:05:59.069> my<00:05:59.520> system<00:05:59.909> starts<00:06:00.180> oscillating<00:06:00.449> so

00:06:01.219 --> 00:06:01.229 
a sudden my system starts oscillating so

00:06:01.229 --> 00:06:03.980 
a sudden my system starts oscillating so
this<00:06:01.380> is<00:06:01.500> an<00:06:01.590> example<00:06:01.949> of<00:06:02.279> where<00:06:02.819> the<00:06:03.419> integral

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:03.990 
this is an example of where the integral

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:06.170 
this is an example of where the integral
part<00:06:04.469> may<00:06:04.919> actually<00:06:05.159> cause<00:06:05.490> oscillations

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:06.180 
part may actually cause oscillations

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:09.649 
part may actually cause oscillations
which<00:06:06.539> is<00:06:07.759> we<00:06:08.759> should<00:06:08.940> at<00:06:09.060> least<00:06:09.180> be<00:06:09.389> aware<00:06:09.479> of

00:06:09.649 --> 00:06:09.659 
which is we should at least be aware of

00:06:09.659 --> 00:06:11.420 
which is we should at least be aware of
this<00:06:09.900> fact<00:06:10.139> and<00:06:10.380> be<00:06:10.500> a<00:06:10.529> little<00:06:10.800> careful<00:06:10.979> when

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:11.430 
this fact and be a little careful when

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:13.790 
this fact and be a little careful when
we<00:06:11.520> tweak<00:06:11.880> our<00:06:12.060> parameters<00:06:12.569> and<00:06:12.779> if<00:06:12.990> we<00:06:13.590> see

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:13.800 
we tweak our parameters and if we see

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:17.120 
we tweak our parameters and if we see
oscillations<00:06:14.690> that<00:06:15.690> is<00:06:15.870> a<00:06:15.900> clear<00:06:16.680> indication

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:17.130 
oscillations that is a clear indication

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:19.070 
oscillations that is a clear indication
that<00:06:17.310> the<00:06:17.520> integral<00:06:17.909> part<00:06:18.180> is<00:06:18.360> typically<00:06:18.900> a

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:19.080 
that the integral part is typically a

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:22.610 
that the integral part is typically a
little<00:06:19.560> bit<00:06:19.830> too<00:06:20.400> large<00:06:21.199> what<00:06:22.199> about<00:06:22.380> the<00:06:22.469> D

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:22.620 
little bit too large what about the D

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:25.279 
little bit too large what about the D
part<00:06:22.889> well<00:06:23.240> let's<00:06:24.240> add<00:06:24.479> the<00:06:24.509> D<00:06:24.810> part<00:06:25.080> in<00:06:25.199> this

00:06:25.279 --> 00:06:25.289 
part well let's add the D part in this

00:06:25.289 --> 00:06:26.959 
part well let's add the D part in this
case<00:06:25.560> it<00:06:25.800> actually<00:06:26.069> doesn't<00:06:26.279> matter<00:06:26.639> too<00:06:26.940> much

00:06:26.959 --> 00:06:26.969 
case it actually doesn't matter too much

00:06:26.969 --> 00:06:28.909 
case it actually doesn't matter too much
what<00:06:27.419> you<00:06:27.569> see<00:06:27.599> here<00:06:27.990> is<00:06:28.080> that<00:06:28.110> I<00:06:28.289> had<00:06:28.440> a<00:06:28.469> small

00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:28.919 
what you see here is that I had a small

00:06:28.919 --> 00:06:31.850 
what you see here is that I had a small
D<00:06:29.130> part<00:06:29.400> I'm<00:06:29.639> a<00:06:29.699> little<00:06:30.000> bit<00:06:30.289> paranoid<00:06:31.289> when<00:06:31.770> it

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:31.860 
D part I'm a little bit paranoid when it

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:33.890 
D part I'm a little bit paranoid when it
comes<00:06:32.009> to<00:06:32.130> large<00:06:32.340> KD<00:06:32.909> terms<00:06:33.270> because<00:06:33.599> they<00:06:33.719> are

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:33.900 
comes to large KD terms because they are

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:38.120 
comes to large KD terms because they are
a<00:06:34.830> little<00:06:35.610> bit<00:06:35.870> noise<00:06:36.870> sensitive<00:06:37.440> but<00:06:37.979> what

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:38.130 
a little bit noise sensitive but what

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:39.469 
a little bit noise sensitive but what
you're<00:06:38.279> seeing<00:06:38.490> here<00:06:38.759> is<00:06:38.820> that<00:06:38.940> you're

00:06:39.469 --> 00:06:39.479 
you're seeing here is that you're

00:06:39.479 --> 00:06:41.490 
you're seeing here is that you're
getting<00:06:39.630> a<00:06:39.839> faster<00:06:40.380> initial<00:06:40.860> risk

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:41.500 
getting a faster initial risk

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:43.680 
getting a faster initial risk
because<00:06:41.800> of<00:06:42.160> the<00:06:42.520> introduction<00:06:43.030> of<00:06:43.390> a<00:06:43.510> deep

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:43.690 
because of the introduction of a deep

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:46.140 
because of the introduction of a deep
art<00:06:43.960> but<00:06:44.200> then<00:06:44.410> we<00:06:45.310> actually<00:06:45.400> get<00:06:45.700> almost<00:06:46.000> a

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:46.150 
art but then we actually get almost a

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:48.480 
art but then we actually get almost a
slower<00:06:46.480> response<00:06:46.780> towards<00:06:47.380> the<00:06:47.500> end<00:06:47.650> so<00:06:48.070> the

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:48.490 
slower response towards the end so the

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:50.790 
slower response towards the end so the
deep<00:06:48.700> art<00:06:48.940> is<00:06:49.090> there<00:06:49.270> to<00:06:49.450> drive<00:06:49.720> it<00:06:50.020> well<00:06:50.410> up<00:06:50.620> in

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:50.800 
deep art is there to drive it well up in

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:53.130 
deep art is there to drive it well up in
the<00:06:50.860> beginning<00:06:51.280> but<00:06:51.550> then<00:06:51.880> towards<00:06:52.750> the<00:06:52.990> end

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:53.140 
the beginning but then towards the end

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:56.610 
the beginning but then towards the end
in<00:06:53.560> this<00:06:53.830> particular<00:06:54.520> application<00:06:55.170> having<00:06:56.170> ad

00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:56.620 
in this particular application having ad

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:58.380 
in this particular application having ad
gain<00:06:56.890> that's<00:06:57.100> nonzero<00:06:57.340> it<00:06:57.760> wasn't<00:06:58.030> even<00:06:58.210> clear

00:06:58.380 --> 00:06:58.390 
gain that's nonzero it wasn't even clear

00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:02.970 
gain that's nonzero it wasn't even clear
if<00:06:58.540> that<00:06:58.690> was<00:06:59.050> was<00:06:59.920> useful<00:07:00.370> but<00:07:01.080> this<00:07:02.080> is<00:07:02.290> some

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:02.980 
if that was was useful but this is some

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:05.490 
if that was was useful but this is some
of<00:07:03.100> the<00:07:03.130> thinking<00:07:03.610> that<00:07:03.760> goes<00:07:03.820> into<00:07:04.500> to

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:05.500 
of the thinking that goes into to

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:09.420 
of the thinking that goes into to
tweaking<00:07:06.450> PID<00:07:07.450> regulators<00:07:08.290> so<00:07:08.890> what<00:07:09.070> we<00:07:09.250> are

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:09.430 
tweaking PID regulators so what we are

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:11.550 
tweaking PID regulators so what we are
going<00:07:09.610> to<00:07:09.850> do<00:07:10.030> next<00:07:10.510> time<00:07:10.780> is<00:07:11.050> we're<00:07:11.320> going<00:07:11.440> to

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:11.560 
going to do next time is we're going to

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:13.230 
going to do next time is we're going to
go<00:07:11.830> now<00:07:12.220> from<00:07:12.520> this<00:07:12.640> rather<00:07:12.820> abstract

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:13.240

go now from this rather abstract

integrals and derivatives to something
that<00:07:16.270> we<00:07:16.330> can<00:07:16.480> actually<00:07:16.600> implement<00:07:16.990> and<00:07:17.530> we're

that we can actually implement and we're

that we can actually implement and we're
going<00:07:18.280> to<00:07:18.310> see<00:07:18.580> how<00:07:18.910> these<00:07:19.450> PID<00:07:19.870> gains<00:07:20.230> show<00:07:20.680> up

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:20.830 
going to see how these PID gains show up

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:24.270 
going to see how these PID gains show up
when<00:07:21.070> we<00:07:21.160> control<00:07:21.550> a<00:07:21.790> the<00:07:22.890> altitude<00:07:23.890> of<00:07:24.130> a
