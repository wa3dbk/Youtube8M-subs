so<00:03:36.260> fascinated<00:03:36.890> with<00:03:37.070> I<00:03:37.760> don't<00:03:38.390> think<00:03:38.510> he

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:38.570 
so fascinated with I don't think he

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:40.240 
so fascinated with I don't think he
understood<00:03:38.959> how<00:03:39.320> an<00:03:39.500> organization<00:03:39.800> would

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
understood how an organization would

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.220 
understood how an organization would
work<00:03:40.520> to<00:03:40.820> us<00:03:41.180> permission<00:03:41.480> for<00:03:41.780> certain<00:03:42.050> things

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
work to us permission for certain things

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.560 
work to us permission for certain things
and<00:03:42.560> I<00:03:43.340> think<00:03:43.370> that<00:03:43.730> he<00:03:43.850> decided<00:03:44.150> to<00:03:44.209> take<00:03:44.300> on

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:47.170 
and I think that he decided to take on
things<00:03:44.720> himself<00:03:44.990> which<00:03:45.980> is<00:03:46.160> that<00:03:46.490> right<00:03:46.940> there

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
things himself which is that right there

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.199 
things himself which is that right there
contains<00:03:47.930> his<00:03:48.080> legacy<00:03:48.440> is<00:03:48.560> that<00:03:48.610> the<00:03:49.610> Mafia

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.209 
contains his legacy is that the Mafia

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:52.180 
contains his legacy is that the Mafia
tried<00:03:50.630> to<00:03:50.720> kill<00:03:50.930> him<00:03:51.050> numerous<00:03:51.680> amounts<00:03:51.950> times

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190 
tried to kill him numerous amounts times

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.640 
tried to kill him numerous amounts times
would<00:03:52.370> have<00:03:52.489> murdered<00:03:52.730> and<00:03:53.090> he<00:03:54.080> survived<00:03:54.440> them

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650 
would have murdered and he survived them

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:57.850 
would have murdered and he survived them
