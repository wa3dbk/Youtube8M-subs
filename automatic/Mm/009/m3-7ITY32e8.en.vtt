 they played basketball before there 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.560
 it was the professional league and therefore

 of them 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:53.640
 the matter was quite gray 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.880
 in the sense that the discussion between them 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.890
 often spilled men money women 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.390

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.820
