00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:06.900
 hello everyone well today let's see how 

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:10.980
 watch an online movie through 

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:13.050
 our television smrtv and for that that 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.320
 So we need just a TV 

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:19.410
 with smrtv and internet connection we 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:23.539
 let's go to the smrtv menu we tell you 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.539
 we want to go to the internet 

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:29.260
 and what we do is 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.540
 do this look for the page that we 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.520
 we want 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.160
 where we want to locate the 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.430
 movies to watch online that you 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:47.400
 we puncture here the truth that the smrtv of 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.620
 for example of lg on this TV is not going 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:52.050
 good but good for what we want 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.350
 do the truth is that we are going quite 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.350
 all right 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:01:01.910
 and we can not ask for more good and the 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.910
 page he uses is zeta movies 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:07.810
 we give him to enter 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:10.460
 we entered again this would be simply 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:14.890
 as if it were a computer 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:17.140
 it's just that the truth is not going so fast 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.830
 I do not know if with other models of 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.820
 TVs was better but good 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.330
 as I said 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:27.210
 for what we want 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:30.280
 we have spare 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:33.810
 here we have all the movies 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.810
 for example let's see 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.610
 which we see is that we 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.630
 so you have to choose a few 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:55.590
 what we want there are some that as is 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.149
 obvious if they are not on the page because 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.450
 have removed it because we can not 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.450
 watch 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.859
 now let's give it 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.719
 to this same 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:13.930
 here we open a tab of 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:13.930
 advertising is closed 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.549
 and here the page has been opened 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.290
 so he wants to go slowly tranquility 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:32.660
 he is in a hurry 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:35.420
 and simply by giving it 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:38.900
 here we get direct download or see 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:41.330
 online we give you to watch online and 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.910
 Now we select the one that we like the most 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.880
 or the one that works for me the one that is 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:51.490
 coming out functional is the strange club 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:51.490
 club this let's try this one 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.730
 and now 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:03:00.330
 we get a lot of advertising and here 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:02.580
 there is no waiting time 7 seconds 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:05.250
 this 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:08.750
 is advertising, so do not worry 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.750
 see the video say 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:15.150
 and we do not reopen here another 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:18.540
 We can close the tab is 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:21.290
 and here we are already open 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.290
 the video 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:28.959
 here everywhere you know advertising 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.680
 here is the movie just what 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:31.680
 what we have to do is 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:39.099
 give it to load and it opens all 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:39.099
 little eyelash bouquets 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:45.630
 we closed this girl too 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.630
 that we are here 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:52.610
 and we wait for him to load 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:01.160
 [Music] 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:03.280
 and there we have it now simply 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:08.020
 we give to expand 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:10.150
 [Music] 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:13.630
 and we leave the mouse and try to leave 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:15.580
 at least on this TV we leave it here 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:19.920
 on the left side 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:21.930
 let's give the play that is the stop 

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:23.820
 we leave you on the left side so that 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:25.850
 there is not the bar below putting on and 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.850
 taking off 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.520
 you see how the bar stays and 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:33.580
 taking off if we do not take her here 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:35.850
 and we remove it normally it is usually 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.850
 remove 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.620
 now I 'm going to leave entirely 

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:47.319
 another day has worked well but good 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:54.740
 how is the least 

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:57.889
 there we have already 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.889
 [Music] 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:03.960
 the movie 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.960
 working correctly 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:11.849
 I hope it serves someone many 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.849
 Thank you 

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:15.089
