00:00:00.969 --> 00:00:06.370
 Hello everyone on the channel Alexander M Brest 

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:14.860
 this minute of vandalism today is minutes 

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:16.390
 vandalism we have gsr 14.4 i think everyone 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:19.240
 the question arose where the cartridge is 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:23.409
 and in more detail did you bring 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:27.569
 sent well naturally began to ask 

00:00:23.409 --> 00:00:31.329
 man as it happened 

00:00:27.569 --> 00:00:32.520
 just broke the cartridge well and how do I 

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:35.200
 have said 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.230
 man drilled with this screwdriver 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:40.680
 wood big drill in the end 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:45.070
 naturally whole under stuck and he is so 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:50.560
 lie and chuck stayed with the drill 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:52.060
 sandwiched and with the spindle hanging around in 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:54.850
 eventually the man disappeared came to me 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:56.800
 at first wanted to say at home 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.480
 sin on the fact that people are not neat 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.810
 favor but then honestly looked 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.910
 on the spindle and saw something here on 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:05.830
 spindle edge for which should 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:09.070
 unhooked snap ring almost not 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.990
 so how would I think this 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.690
 failure occurred due to non-refinement 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:17.890
 designs now show closer here 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:25.229
 our shaft and here you are here on the idea 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:25.229
 which clings to the edge of the lock 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.590
 that is, I do not know whether it can 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.630
 screwdriver defective tule horizontal bar 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.180
 all this will need to disassemble but water 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:36.850
 it became interesting to see 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:40.180
 but in any case if you have exactly 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:42.820
 such a screwdriver is better not to pull it 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.650
 stuck drill try us 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.000
 reverse unscrew how we blockade 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:49.659
 Spindle a little spin 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.570
 because but see what effects 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:54.880
 interesting are life on the working day 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:57.820
 ended repair it today will not but 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:01.060
 I think tomorrow if I have time 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:03.970
 how am i here instead of this 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:07.930
 pseudo shame doing adequate passports 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.759
 the park, well of course, what doctrine of thought 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:11.069
 time will be 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.450
 Well, the second copy of our 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:15.360
 today's collection is 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:18.209
 adjustment of revolutions and benefits smooth 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:21.739
 in one run for polishing machine 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:24.870
 so usually if anyone saw here 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:26.610
 sitting must attend both 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.319
 rule such regulation of revolutions in general 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.799
 completely filled here with us all 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:32.610
 Galina 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:35.540
 but in principle i tend to the version that 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:39.390
 they tried to fix it but unsuccessfully 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:41.250
 probably the very tuning you wanted 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.370
 do you sing something well naturally 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:47.190
 failed if not bring tool 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.069
 It is with such regulators that I filled 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.269
 don't even bother me personally right away 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:53.670
