00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 with writing from yesterday that had the presence 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.870
 of carmona and of the sebastian 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.170
 Bench we commented 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.550
 as you comment here in the newsroom 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:13.469
 about how the rio de janeiro press 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.509
 specifically in our very modest 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.539
 opinion of the three journalists who were 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.580
 here on the bench yesterday they have difficulty 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.480
 vibrate with any club other than the 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.980
 Flamengo 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.289
 often to you see in the press 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.630
 of rio de janeiro a jest one 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.570
 with the rivals of the 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.180
 Flemish even when they come 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.980
 happened yesterday in the cover of the extra newspaper 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.500
 Rio de Janeiro we will show you 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.579
 here for those who have not seen yet this is the 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.969
 newspaper cover 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.980
 and looks at the detail painted vice newspaper 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.230
 this was the classification of the Basque 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.660
 for the final of the carioca championship 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.329
 he painted vice edmilson scored the goal 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.670
 Basque at the Carioca final, the first 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.920
 final of Rio de Janeiro in ten years playing for 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.899
 two draws the red ones already provoke 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.039
 the rivals celebrating the titles in the 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.199
 social networks 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:04.080
 This is a joke that the 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.630
 flamenguistas do with the Basques and 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.479
 led the Basque to release a note 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.479
 official yesterday's club note even in 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:15.360
 repudiation of the Rio newspaper headline 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:19.259
 I'll read some excerpts here from the note from 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:21.090
 Vasco caused bewilderment and lack FAO 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.040
 of respect and conduct devoid of 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.890
 ethical exemption and professionalism 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.020
 demonstrated since said means of 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.110
 communication has opted inexplicably for 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.600
 try to expose us this note of the Basque as well 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.070
 as by extension we again affirm 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.140
 our millions of fans in love 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.890
 to the detriment of their professional duty 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:43.409
 to inform personnel free of 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.560
 note is very long whoever you want is in 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.840
 Basque website and then the Basque comes 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.119
 through the present to undermine a 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.670
 official retraction by the aforementioned 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.990
 Basque newspaper asked for a retraction 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.390
 It's hard for you to ask for a recantation. 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.610
 when someone does not make an accusation 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.860
 newspaper made a joke a joke of 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.049
 bad taste reader and the audience of 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:07.290
 essay that the Basque judge asked for a 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.369
 retraction in the name of good journalism etc. 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.819
 and such 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:13.860
 the extra newspaper today makes room for 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:15.930
 of course it is not the same 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.150
 step but has cover call and opens 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.590
 space in your sports notebook 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.840
 saying that the game revolted the 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.030
 Basque fan 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.200
 For me, I live in Rio de Janeiro. 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:30.930
 four years 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:34.800
 is just one more case than the cyst of a 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:37.590
 club win win seat and be ironic 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:40.080
 the next day in exchange for a headline 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.540
 more red black but I want to see the team 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.220
 who also lives in the river and had a bonfire 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.180
 controversial subject to be discussed here in 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.709
 writing is always football in the 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.630
 universal language spoken with 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.880
 different accent 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.239
 I think this story shows several 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:03:01.230
 things about the local football accent 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:03.000
 the importance of mockery is part of 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.760
 your culture 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:10.230
 the fact that within the Brazilian culture 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:14.580
 and serving except the worst possible thing is 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:17.400
 better to fall out soon what you lost 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:23.310
 in the end what is everyone watching 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:26.519
 and hence the humiliation of losing is greater and 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.690
 also an adult acting side that 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:30.299
 neither children 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:33.209
 I remember some examples I remember that 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:34.680
 in 2010 when botafogo wins a game 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:36.180
 important against the Flemish if I do not 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.670
 deceit at the end of the guanabara cup 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.080
 Globe headline next day was dream 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.480
 of a summer night by ironizing the 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:44.250
 botafogo botafogo came to be champion 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.140
 state that year 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.060
 I remember last year when the 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.100
 botafogo won the state championship at 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.750
 headline of the globe was botafogo 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.610
 leading to a depleted state 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.140
 just compare with the space that was 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:56.220
 given this year when the Flemish comes to 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.630
 guanabara cup 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:00.930
 the impression I have is that it really 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:02.640
 there is a difficulty in vibrating with the 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.900
 colors other than red and black on the 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.459
 rio de janeiro press this is mine 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.380
 Printing and you from Mauritius 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:10.620
 muds 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:14.130
 no doubt it's an option 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:18.870
 skewed to you gives a news 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:21.600
 Let's go make fun of the Basque. 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:24.060
 behind the making of this 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:26.160
 this headline goes from the editorial line 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.700
 every newspaper of choice making and 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.980
 risks you want to run 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:32.860
 evidently that if you please and do the 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:34.510
 rite of the Basque crowd with the author 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.190
 flamenco crowd with a headline 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:38.470
 Of this you will displease the whole crowd. 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:40.120
 Basque and all are buyers of his 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:42.520
 newspaper is different for example when 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:44.020
 You 're going to take a leak for 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.880
 example of Argentines when Brazil 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:48.550
 in a match of the Argentines, right? 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:51.880
 There you do not have Argentines. 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:53.590
 your consumer audience and that is 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:55.120
 people accept much more when you 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:57.430
 strip salt for example from a selection 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:01.210
 that the rival of the team now 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:03.580
 the rivalry is a bonfire the newspaper is 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:05.890
 risked and I think he did not come back ooooo 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:07.900
 Basque manifested itself 

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:10.750
 river by well manifest the way up 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:13.000
 published newspaper published and there goes 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:16.390
 reader wants to continue shopping does not want 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.340
 that to ignite the newspaper at last that is 

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:20.740
 hands are the delights of pain also 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:22.630
 we could have a free press is 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:24.630
 a free piece of power to discuss this 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:27.630
 subject here in the newsroom 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:27.630
 freely
