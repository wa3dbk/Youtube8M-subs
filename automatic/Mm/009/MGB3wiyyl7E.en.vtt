00:00:00.669 --> 00:00:04.569
 88 minutes into the game against FC Schalke 04 FC Schalke 04 

00:00:04.569 --> 00:00:07.870
 umpire assistant Thorsten Schiffner is being replaced by a full 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:09.629
 Beer mug hit the neck 

00:00:09.629 --> 00:00:13.009
 Referee Aytekin breaks the match at the score of 2 0 for Schalke 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:16.110
 prematurely determined from now on the DFB 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.699
 Neumann sees it as a player Bowman Musi plays open between Roger that it 

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:24.699
 ask in the place for research question 

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:29.050
 Of course the former residence to storm is of course not to see that 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.989
 what is offered here was of course a very heated atmosphere for that 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:34.880
 that radiation from Sam Pauli also known 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.510
 we knew what we could do here only that the game then 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.880
 just wanted to use it just is not in football 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.949
 We have to see how they are too short for Russian gas 

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:48.709
 and if you now watch the TV pictures and this only for spicing and 

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:51.830
 report in a traceable place 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:55.930
 but before that football was played on Millerntor Schalke for the first time 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:59.590
 new coach Ralf Rangnick now everything should be better in the past 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:02.590
 worst season of the guests for almost 25 years 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.030
 and it goes straight to the thing free kick Schalke 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.490
 repelled but there is Raul had 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.490
 Weber that and since this the "second chance" so far 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.140
 a furious start in front of 24,000 spectators 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.140
 the slow motion shows how close Schalke is here to the lead St 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.370
 it turns out a worthwhile exchange of blows with chances on both 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.370
 Pages corner Schalke Farfan 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.070
 Raul comes like Taylor Brand under this 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.460
 that will start at one in the 26 minutes of play 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.940
 the superstar comes to her completely headstrong politician 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.940
 Criticism has the disadvantage 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.360
 The Kiezkicker now noticeably unsettled "The ball loss 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.720
 Raul immediately shoots the g2 in front of the goal and just over it 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.409
 it's a break at Millerntor 

00:02:08.409 --> 00:02:11.409
 Free kick St Pauli 65 the minute 

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:16.479
 Kruse the ball long in the air 

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:19.189
 and goals 

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:23.959
 but too early referee Aytekin decides right offside 

00:02:29.389 --> 00:02:32.609
 Good to see here Boll is on the sidelines 

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:36.589
 She then goes to Manuel again the decision absolutely correct 

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:42.359
 the direct return 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:44.819
 Raul to Farfan 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:48.919
 strong scenes of the Peruvian's sharp cross the act it was sorry 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:57.569
 this will be two in the 66 minutes by Yangs Julian Draxler 

00:02:58.199 --> 00:03:01.859
 and how bitter that is for St Pauli just one-on-one denied 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:06.299
 and seconds later this spectacular Traxler gates 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:13.559
 just two minutes later this action 

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:15.599
 clear against sharp 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:18.599
 and yellow-red for defender Kaka 

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:28.189
 to play for another 20 minutes 

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:31.189
 St Pauli proves morality 

00:03:31.189 --> 00:03:34.430
 Shaggy gets the ball 18 yards Andreas Kramer 

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:48.029
 the next excitement of the match twelve minutes before the end of proceedings against Bad 

00:03:48.029 --> 00:03:52.749
 TÃ¶lz Vaduz comes a tad late and referee became old game campground 

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:06.579
 then, as already mentioned, premature termination 

00:04:09.469 --> 00:04:12.869
 an absolutely successful entry for Ralf Rangnick on his return to the 

00:04:12.869 --> 00:04:15.359
 FC Schalke 04 

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:17.979
 can go second 

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:20.979
 for St Pauli, on the other hand, it's a raven-black day 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:25.860
 for Mehrzad give then there are situations where one says so would have 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.309
 we should maybe have given a little more throttle there 

00:04:29.309 --> 00:04:32.769
 we will invest everything we have until the last matchday 

00:04:32.769 --> 00:04:34.409
 and to bring no, we are 

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:35.490
 very good 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:38.370
 which becomes baptism torque 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.370
 so we want to be attacked by laws and undisturbed and 

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:44.949
 Berlusconi was the deciding factor for the winner who the team was there 

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:46.479
 today as a team too 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:51.270
 and works them and played together with the ball and also against the 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:52.479
 Ball and percent 

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:56.090
 19 actors also of the things we primarily agree with them as 1% 

00:04:56.089 --> 00:04:59.820
 have never given normal mice have already implemented a lot of euros dpa 

00:04:59.819 --> 00:05:01.610
 Of course there is still room for improvement
