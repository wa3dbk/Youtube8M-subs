probably not going to cover those in
this<00:00:57.030> specific<00:00:57.930> tutorial<00:00:58.079> but<00:00:58.890> just<00:00:59.100> the

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
this specific tutorial but just the

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.450 
this specific tutorial but just the
basics<00:00:59.609> that<00:00:59.670> ship<00:00:59.969> out<00:01:00.480> with<00:01:01.199> light<00:01:01.440> wave<00:01:01.649> we

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
basics that ship out with light wave we

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.060 
basics that ship out with light wave we
are<00:01:02.550> going<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:02.910> cover<00:01:03.090> those<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:03.949> if<00:01:04.949> you

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
are going to cover those and if you

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.570 
are going to cover those and if you
notice<00:01:05.280> that<00:01:05.670> when<00:01:05.880> we<00:01:06.030> click<00:01:06.390> on<00:01:06.630> these<00:01:06.810> tabs

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:07.580 
notice that when we click on these tabs

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.969 
notice that when we click on these tabs
are<00:01:08.580> little<00:01:08.880> menu<00:01:09.060> here<00:01:09.560> changes<00:01:11.090> okay<00:01:12.090> so

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
are little menu here changes okay so

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:15.950 
are little menu here changes okay so
we're<00:01:13.979> not<00:01:14.100> going<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.369> cover<00:01:14.549> everything<00:01:15.390> but

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
we're not going to cover everything but

most important things to get you up and
started<00:01:31.710> there<00:01:32.280> are<00:01:32.640> tons<00:01:33.479> and<00:01:33.960> tons<00:01:34.350> and<00:01:34.740> tons

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
started there are tons and tons and tons

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.490 
started there are tons and tons and tons
of<00:01:35.220> things<00:01:35.460> inside<00:01:35.880> of<00:01:36.810> lightwave<00:01:37.259> the

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
of things inside of lightwave the

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.410 
of things inside of lightwave the
average<00:01:37.860> user<00:01:38.130> never<00:01:38.549> even<00:01:38.790> comes<00:01:39.060> close<00:01:39.150> to

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
average user never even comes close to

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.910 
average user never even comes close to
using<00:01:40.280> even<00:01:41.280> half<00:01:41.579> of<00:01:41.820> it<00:01:42.000> okay<00:01:42.960> so<00:01:43.590> don't

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
using even half of it okay so don't

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.740 
using even half of it okay so don't
think<00:01:44.130> that<00:01:44.220> you<00:01:44.399> have<00:01:44.579> to<00:01:44.610> know<00:01:45.030> what<00:01:45.479> each

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
think that you have to know what each

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.999 
think that you have to know what each
and<00:01:46.079> every<00:01:46.500> button<00:01:46.799> is<00:01:47.040> for<00:01:47.070> um<00:01:48.799> when<00:01:49.799> you

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
and every button is for um when you

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.300 
and every button is for um when you
start<00:01:50.369> learning<00:01:50.880> a<00:01:51.030> software<00:01:51.930> package<00:01:52.310> you

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
start learning a software package you

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.480 
start learning a software package you
need<00:01:53.520> to<00:01:53.700> know<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:54.689> basic<00:01:55.170> rules<00:01:56.070> of<00:01:56.369> the

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
need to know the basic rules of the

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.550 
need to know the basic rules of the
software<00:01:56.969> and<00:01:58.070> the<00:01:59.070> most<00:01:59.310> important<00:02:00.560> buttons

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
software and the most important buttons

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.069 
software and the most important buttons
and<00:02:01.740> features<00:02:02.100> to<00:02:02.280> use<00:02:02.430> because<00:02:02.579> a<00:02:02.670> lot<00:02:03.000> of

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:03.079 
and features to use because a lot of

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:08.270 
and features to use because a lot of
buttons<00:02:04.079> are<00:02:04.439> actually<00:02:07.069> combinations<00:02:08.069> of

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
buttons are actually combinations of

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:14.050 
buttons are actually combinations of
some<00:02:09.149> of<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:09.360> basic<00:02:10.050> buttons<00:02:10.910> okay<00:02:11.910> so

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
some of the basic buttons okay so

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.839 
some of the basic buttons okay so
keep<00:02:14.450> that<00:02:14.599> in<00:02:14.780> mind<00:02:14.989> so<00:02:15.770> we're<00:02:16.220> going<00:02:16.400> to<00:02:16.489> stop

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:16.849 
keep that in mind so we're going to stop

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:18.760 
keep that in mind so we're going to stop
here<00:02:17.330> and<00:02:17.540> when<00:02:17.810> we<00:02:17.930> come<00:02:18.140> back<00:02:18.349> we're<00:02:18.650> going

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:18.770 
here and when we come back we're going

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.309 
here and when we come back we're going
to<00:02:18.860> start<00:02:19.069> going<00:02:19.459> through<00:02:19.489> all<00:02:20.209> the<00:02:20.900> panels

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
to start going through all the panels
