00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:11.900
 hello kirby nautas welcome to the canal 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:15.230
 of barbies and here we are in our 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:17.750
 Kirby's guide and the rainbow brush for 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:20.630
 get all the boxes and all 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:22.100
 gold coins good medals 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.020
 gold better said and if the wheel of the 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:27.650
 luck allows us the newspaper but 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:31.100
 now it 's up in the forest orange 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:35.260
 lake bounced and that the ex-chief comes 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:37.149
 we go there the lake bounced ditto 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:40.000
 first we have to get to bounced 

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:43.089
 and the road is not very long what happens 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.850
 is that Kirby in the form of a ball in his 

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:47.890
 normal way is quite complicated hey 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.710
 because you're going up if you're stretching 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:54.579
 down then come what is 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:56.500
 quite complicated to control under 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:01:00.140
 of water or at least it seems to me 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:03.559
 quite complicated does not have its that 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:06.680
 come let's see we are already in the area 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:09.820
 of bounce today of underwater and we 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.920
 appears with diving goggles 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:19.050
 here what we have to do is 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:23.130
 hit him like normal Kirby there in his 3 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:26.400
 red plates good fuchsias better said and 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.670
 the metal one we have to hit him with a 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.560
 impulse to go well 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.990
 and to get the Kirby boost 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.900
 we have to pick up what's wrong what's wrong 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:40.330
 site that bad site comes down kirby 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:42.520
 low voice I'm in a terrible place 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.800
 how bad what evil looks less bad out there 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.920
 the bottle comes out let's see the 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:50.020
 little bottle of milk for kirby runs 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.360
 runs that disappears there is therefore what 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:55.510
 what we have to do is collect those 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:59.250
 little stars that are falling there is already 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:03.640
 we only have the metal plate 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:06.160
 come turn and go up rises of 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.009
 control is this this Kirby under the 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.869
 Water 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:15.480
 to see come I need more stars 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:18.360
 to get the momentum come and go 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:21.830
 the rays will then unlock and with it 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:24.050
 the rainbow ribbon 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:27.740
 come if I already have the momentum I have the 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:30.020
 impulse to see mine bottle well let's go 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:31.580
 to make the impulse to go via and we're 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:35.290
 perfect 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:37.569
 bounced and annihilated 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.000
 Well, the chiefs are already pretty 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:41.010
 rapid 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.620
