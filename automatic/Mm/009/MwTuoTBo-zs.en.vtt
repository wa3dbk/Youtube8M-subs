00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:05.460
 so hello to all these lots is I 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.290
 was coming to sternum salmon and you 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.380
 will ask questions because I 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.570
 that for a few days and I do not know 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.690
 too much how our sides so a mac to 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:18.539
 freeze like these body of both 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:22.230
 small floor of a small but dany that 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:24.510
 it's up to the grid at the top 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.400
 I did it myself 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.859
 he missed a little bit so I had them I 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.300
 believe is a piece of wood we put 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:35.520
 a little recovery bill that puts them to 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:38.100
 to play so much there is what is done 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.920
 house and arrange it himself so good 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:46.039
 so it's a happy medium 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:49.350
 the gc ca and that he 

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:52.230
 I am a big because actually my 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:55.110
 hamster and tried several times so 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.420
 when he arrived from my home 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.760
 but that's really where it started 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.840
 make us feel but we were biting then I 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.210
 read in a little book that needed 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.210
 leave three days there are everywhere 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:13.260
 so now here I tried again more 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:17.330
 the king but with legrand but he me more 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.330
 so here we go 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:25.990
 and that's the way it's because 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.990
 that it's frowned upon 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:37.330
 that's when I came out too wide and the 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.330
 food 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:50.690
 So here below the house 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:53.780
 basketry a little too cute so here 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:56.990
 these mosses and a hamster and we 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.190
 explain how to do for them for 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:02.290
 better take care of it and well it could 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:02.290
