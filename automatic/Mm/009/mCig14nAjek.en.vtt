00:00:59.219 --> 00:00:59.229 
in and over to when I think he's going

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.440 

you'll<00:02:24.220> notice<00:02:24.489> the<00:02:24.580> Honda<00:02:24.850> player<00:02:25.060> doing<00:02:25.360> a

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
you'll notice the Honda player doing a

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:26.940 
you'll notice the Honda player doing a
bunch<00:02:25.630> of<00:02:25.720> neutral<00:02:26.110> jump<00:02:26.320> heavy<00:02:26.560> punches

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
bunch of neutral jump heavy punches

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.199 
bunch of neutral jump heavy punches
right<00:02:27.040> here<00:02:27.250> and<00:02:27.370> it<00:02:27.459> might<00:02:27.820> look<00:02:27.940> like<00:02:28.000> he's

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
right here and it might look like he's

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:29.699 
right here and it might look like he's
taunting<00:02:28.420> me<00:02:28.690> from<00:02:28.870> all<00:02:28.959> the<00:02:29.080> elbows<00:02:29.320> I<00:02:29.440> drop

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
taunting me from all the elbows I drop

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:31.860 
taunting me from all the elbows I drop
but<00:02:30.190> that's<00:02:31.060> actually<00:02:31.360> one<00:02:31.480> of<00:02:31.510> the<00:02:31.630> best

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
but that's actually one of the best

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.630 
but that's actually one of the best
tools<00:02:32.320> to<00:02:32.650> keep<00:02:32.830> guy<00:02:33.040> away<00:02:33.340> and<00:02:33.519> it's

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
tools to keep guy away and it's

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:34.979 
tools to keep guy away and it's
extremely<00:02:34.060> difficult<00:02:34.209> to<00:02:34.480> get<00:02:34.660> in<00:02:34.780> on<00:02:34.900> them

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
extremely difficult to get in on them

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:36.570 
extremely difficult to get in on them
like<00:02:35.290> that<00:02:35.350> in<00:02:35.709> situations<00:02:35.860> you<00:02:36.310> have<00:02:36.340> to<00:02:36.489> be

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
like that in situations you have to be

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:43.979 
like that in situations you have to be
kept<00:02:36.760> very<00:02:36.790> careful<00:02:42.630> this<00:02:43.630> slide<00:02:43.810> right<00:02:43.900> here

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
kept very careful this slide right here

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:45.330 
kept very careful this slide right here
is<00:02:44.170> actually<00:02:44.200> pretty<00:02:44.590> important<00:02:45.040> for<00:02:45.100> setting

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
is actually pretty important for setting

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.160 
is actually pretty important for setting
up<00:02:45.430> the<00:02:45.549> older<00:02:45.730> to<00:02:45.880> later<00:02:46.090> on<00:02:46.180> because<00:02:46.930> it<00:02:47.080> gets

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
up the older to later on because it gets

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:48.539 
up the older to later on because it gets
the<00:02:47.290> opponent<00:02:47.620> think<00:02:47.769> about<00:02:47.920> offense<00:02:48.310> rather

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:48.549 
the opponent think about offense rather

00:02:48.549 --> 00:03:21.760 
the opponent think about offense rather
than<00:02:48.730> defense

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:21.770 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:24.200 

now<00:03:22.770> you<00:03:22.830> actually<00:03:23.070> want<00:03:23.400> to<00:03:23.430> e<00:03:23.490> ex<00:03:23.730> cancel<00:03:24.120> the

now you actually want to e ex cancel the
