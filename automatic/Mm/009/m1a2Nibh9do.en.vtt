00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.340
 not far from here is a harbor though 

00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:09.870
 but you have to bad luck that pirate 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.010
 Porridge does not like to swim anymore during 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.450
 We are looking forward to it like a bath master 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.160
 about the return of this features in 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:18.960
 Three is also tore the water 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:21.029
 optics of chic craftsmanship takes place like 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:36.899
 previously about animated resource extraction and 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:38.730
 further processing in the form menu new 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.980
 and quite nice is the so-called astral 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.690
 view comparable to the eagle eye 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.070
 Assassin's creed can get it 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.719
 people and objects in color 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.440
 perceived highlighted what dude 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.440
 is very practical 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.840
 explorers will come back to their fullest 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.640
 Costs can be found everywhere in the 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.860
 big game world hidden books with 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.940
 pointing to legendary objects 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:07.160
 this time 30 in the number 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.680
 He kept the breastplate as 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:14.000
 lucky charm and buried him with his 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:15.650
 treasure in the hinterland effort with help 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.479
 we find hidden treasure cards 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.310
 do and dig those with a shovel 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:21.470
 that gives us plenty of gold and gold 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.640
 Some boxes even contain 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.380
 legendary objects 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.330
 There is something to discover everywhere 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.070
 game and so also generates knowledge three 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.380
 his main motivation for the player 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.090
 just like the predecessors from the big one 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.680
 and inviting game world in the man 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.680
 just want to explore every angle 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.579
 Cracking locks works one too 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.439
 one as in the predecessor and do with her 

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:55.960
 worthless content abounds with knowledge 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:57.729
 3 typical and simple for the series 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.770
 dialog pickpocketing system exists 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:05.409
 also in part 3 why change too 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:07.960
 it works so what can i do with you 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:09.519
 learn from the blade to that 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.260
 trainer system makes love 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:12.819
 part 2 with heaps of glory and 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.890
 We'll golf our heroes with new ones 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:18.940
 crafts or improve this 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:20.530
 rent ok mini games are in three 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.330
 kind of better on and became 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.750
 taken directly from risen 2 to show 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.790
 we do not do it 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.380
 new is that knife throwing that 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:33.220
 quite entertaining fails and something 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:34.690
 skill requires the evening back 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.069
 however, it consists of a hectic 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.730
 Quicktime event that otherwise not 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:38.730
 can convince 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:54.569
 you have won a lot he is a win 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:01.450
 yuck what an ugly fish this 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.010
 monsters that are 3 a solid in the story 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.349
 given places take place the 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.599
 boss fighting here is trying piranha 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:09.790
 bytes in a kind black flag mode but 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:10.870
 the result is rather modest monster 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.760
 and waves are great 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.040
 the static scenery on deck velvet 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:18.120
 windproof wallpaper wallpaper less 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.120
 luck the fights are short 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:25.230
 menus and inventory yes they are always 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:26.940
 still full on sailor and pirate optics 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.620
 separated what probably speaks for that one 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.230
 also originally at the setting of risen 2 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.790
 who wanted to hold on to the optics 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.590
 and the large open spaces but not 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:38.220
 bother found at first go immediately 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:39.989
 Again there are plenty of quests 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.910
 and we will increase our hero on the basis of 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:43.860
 of eight main attributes the 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:45.569
 improve downstream skills 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.610
 we at the already shown tears 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:48.900
 fits in the game and works if 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:51.920
 even some craft 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.920
 simply useless acts 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:00.350
 I think I'll give you something on the 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:01.280
 eat what we do not fit are such 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:03.230
 sloppies like here 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:06.820
 we only want to knock the opponent out 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:06.820
 because pay attention to what happens immediately 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.959
 our hero performs a martial 

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:18.489
 gram a sword in the belly 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:23.440
 maneuver and the enemy is only 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:26.680
 unconscious not seriously or me 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:28.540
 I 'll start the founder good times 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.130
 but not so fussy the more pleased 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:31.570
 we are about the huge scope of play 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:33.340
 in cracks three peppered with numerous 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:34.960
 tasks that lead again and again 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.640
 that only one task left 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.120
 Master wants to go and go by 

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.520
 hours 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.170
 the quest blog fills up with the help of 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.590
 zoombare card keeps you mostly the 

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:43.590
 orientation 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:51.160
 the manufacturer announced the 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:52.930
 return to the roots 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:55.300
 It definitely does not take place 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:57.340
 in full consequence, magic without mana 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:59.050
 and still clearly present pirates 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:01.390
 Themes could disturb gothic fans 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:03.070
 over there some old burdens in things 

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:05.670
 technology and presentations the otherwise 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:05.670
 high fun
