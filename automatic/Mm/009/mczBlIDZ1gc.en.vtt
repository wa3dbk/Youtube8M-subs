yep you probably already assumed it from
the<00:00:13.200> poster<00:00:13.559> in<00:00:13.650> the<00:00:13.679> background<00:00:14.190> World<00:00:14.580> of

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
the poster in the background World of

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.050 
the poster in the background World of
Warcraft<00:00:15.059> and<00:00:15.500> I<00:00:16.500> played<00:00:16.770> this<00:00:17.070> when<00:00:17.730> it<00:00:17.850> was

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
Warcraft and I played this when it was

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.240 
Warcraft and I played this when it was
just<00:00:18.300> first<00:00:18.539> coming<00:00:19.020> out<00:00:19.199> I<00:00:19.529> played<00:00:20.039> it<00:00:20.160> with

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
just first coming out I played it with

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.349 
just first coming out I played it with
my<00:00:20.430> dad<00:00:20.670> my<00:00:21.330> parents<00:00:21.810> were<00:00:22.519> getting<00:00:23.519> well

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
my dad my parents were getting well

my dad my parents were getting well
almost<00:00:24.720> I<00:00:25.109> think<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.500> divorce<00:00:25.769> might<00:00:25.980> have

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
almost I think the divorce might have

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.980 
almost I think the divorce might have
been<00:00:26.189> done<00:00:26.369> by<00:00:26.580> then<00:00:26.789> but<00:00:27.240> me<00:00:27.570> and<00:00:27.689> him<00:00:27.779> had

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
but yes that was basically my first

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.660 
but yes that was basically my first
video<00:01:36.750> game<00:01:36.990> that<00:01:37.200> I<00:01:37.229> ever<00:01:37.590> really<00:01:38.159> played

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
video game that I ever really played

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.880 
video game that I ever really played
played<00:01:39.060> I<00:01:39.329> didn't<00:01:40.170> have<00:01:40.259> a<00:01:40.290> PlayStation<00:01:40.860> 2

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
played I didn't have a PlayStation 2

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.370 
played I didn't have a PlayStation 2
console<00:01:41.400> however<00:01:41.790> but<00:01:42.150> I<00:01:42.329> did<00:01:42.780> find<00:01:43.140> that

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
console however but I did find that

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.920 
console however but I did find that
world<00:01:43.770> Warcraft<00:01:44.220> was<00:01:44.610> more<00:01:45.270> entertaining<00:01:45.720> to

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
world Warcraft was more entertaining to

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.499 
world Warcraft was more entertaining to
me<00:01:46.049> as<00:01:46.259> well<00:01:46.619> as<00:01:46.829> other<00:01:47.040> PC<00:01:47.430> games<00:01:47.729> when<00:01:48.479> I

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
me as well as other PC games when I

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.380 
me as well as other PC games when I
would<00:01:48.780> go<00:01:49.020> to<00:01:49.079> school<00:01:50.780> people<00:01:51.780> would<00:01:51.990> just

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
would go to school people would just

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.109 
would go to school people would just
play<00:01:54.390> runescape<00:01:55.140> a<00:01:55.710> lot<00:01:55.920> I<00:01:56.189> guess<00:01:56.460> because<00:01:56.729> it

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
play runescape a lot I guess because it

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.380 
play runescape a lot I guess because it
was<00:01:57.270> free<00:01:57.600> and<00:01:57.869> world<00:01:58.079> Warcraft<00:01:58.500> wasn't<00:01:59.360> so<00:02:00.360> I

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
was free and world Warcraft wasn't so I

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.690 
was free and world Warcraft wasn't so I
eventually<00:02:00.930> just<00:02:01.469> tried<00:02:01.680> out<00:02:01.710> runescape<00:02:02.340> and

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
eventually just tried out runescape and

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.340 
eventually just tried out runescape and
I<00:02:03.000> thought<00:02:03.149> it<00:02:03.270> was<00:02:03.360> really<00:02:03.630> dumb<00:02:03.810> compared<00:02:04.259> to

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
I thought it was really dumb compared to

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.050 
I thought it was really dumb compared to
World<00:02:04.530> of<00:02:04.619> Warcraft<00:02:05.009> however<00:02:05.520> I<00:02:05.610> did<00:02:05.850> try<00:02:06.030> to

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
World of Warcraft however I did try to

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.490 
World of Warcraft however I did try to
play<00:02:06.329> it<00:02:06.509> because<00:02:06.689> a<00:02:06.869> lot<00:02:07.079> of<00:02:07.170> people<00:02:07.350> from<00:02:07.409> my

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
play it because a lot of people from my

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.770 
play it because a lot of people from my
