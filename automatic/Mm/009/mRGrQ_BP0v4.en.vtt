a lap band out 80% yeah that's what's a

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.760 
a lap band out 80% yeah that's what's a

huge failure rate that's the statistics

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.740 
huge failure rate that's the statistics
will<00:01:39.950> bear<00:01:40.160> that<00:01:40.370> out<00:01:40.520> over<00:01:40.760> multiple<00:01:41.390> studies

have okay let's give people a comparison
here<00:01:58.970> we<00:01:59.090> have<00:01:59.240> some<00:01:59.720> animation<00:02:00.020> that<00:02:00.320> shows

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
here we have some animation that shows

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.920 
here we have some animation that shows
what<00:02:00.980> lap<00:02:01.280> band<00:02:01.550> surgery<00:02:01.670> looks<00:02:02.330> like<00:02:02.600> what<00:02:02.840> it

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 
what lap band surgery looks like what it

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:04.420 
what lap band surgery looks like what it
is<00:02:03.080> and<00:02:03.260> then<00:02:03.680> we'll<00:02:03.830> compare<00:02:04.010> that<00:02:04.370> to

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
is and then we'll compare that to

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.460 
is and then we'll compare that to
something<00:02:04.760> else<00:02:05.060> now<00:02:05.210> this<00:02:05.390> animation<00:02:05.750> is<00:02:06.230> up

something else now this animation is up

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.830 
something else now this animation is up
the<00:02:06.620> lap<00:02:07.070> band<00:02:07.280> procedure<00:02:07.430> and<00:02:08.090> it<00:02:08.539> shows<00:02:08.810> a

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
the lap band procedure and it shows a

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.660 
the lap band procedure and it shows a
plastic<00:02:09.410> band<00:02:09.649> above<00:02:10.100> the<00:02:10.190> junction<00:02:10.550> between

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
the esophagus and stomach right and

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.350 
the esophagus and stomach right and
doctor<00:02:13.130> what<00:02:13.160> does<00:02:13.340> that<00:02:13.370> do<00:02:13.640> so

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
doctor what does that do so

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.270 
doctor what does that do so
that<00:02:14.540> does<00:02:14.780> is<00:02:14.960> when<00:02:15.110> patients<00:02:15.290> eat<00:02:15.800> the<00:02:16.040> food

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
that does is when patients eat the food

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.950 
that does is when patients eat the food
gets<00:02:16.490> hung<00:02:16.760> up<00:02:16.970> in<00:02:17.090> the<00:02:17.150> upper<00:02:17.420> portion<00:02:17.780> of<00:02:17.840> the

gets hung up in the upper portion of the
stomach<00:02:18.070> some<00:02:19.070> people<00:02:19.370> say<00:02:19.520> that<00:02:19.550> gives<00:02:19.910> you<00:02:20.000> a

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
stomach some people say that gives you a

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:21.880 
stomach some people say that gives you a
sense<00:02:20.330> of<00:02:20.450> satiety<00:02:20.660> or<00:02:21.080> fullness<00:02:21.560> but<00:02:21.770> other

people<00:02:22.250> say<00:02:22.430> it's<00:02:22.580> just<00:02:22.760> pain<00:02:23.030> well<00:02:23.390> and<00:02:23.570> I<00:02:23.660> saw

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
people say it's just pain well and I saw

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.630 
people say it's just pain well and I saw
the<00:02:23.990> little<00:02:24.290> contraption<00:02:24.830> attached<00:02:25.130> to<00:02:25.400> it<00:02:25.520> it

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
the little contraption attached to it it

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.340 
the little contraption attached to it it
has<00:02:25.820> to<00:02:25.850> be<00:02:26.030> adjusted<00:02:26.240> right<00:02:27.020> sometimes

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
has to be adjusted right sometimes

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.530 
has to be adjusted right sometimes
tighten<00:02:27.950> correct<00:02:28.460> and<00:02:28.700> that's<00:02:28.880> a<00:02:29.060> that's<00:02:29.240> a

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
tighten correct and that's a that's a

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.030 
tighten correct and that's a that's a
cash<00:02:29.780> process<00:02:30.380> of<00:02:30.530> about<00:02:30.710> four<00:02:30.950> hundred

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
cash process of about four hundred

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.980 
cash process of about four hundred
dollars<00:02:31.490> each<00:02:31.640> time<00:02:31.850> you<00:02:31.970> do<00:02:32.120> it<00:02:32.150> now<00:02:32.540> one<00:02:32.960> of

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:32.990 
dollars each time you do it now one of

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:35.740 
dollars each time you do it now one of
the<00:02:33.140> reasons<00:02:33.290> is<00:02:33.800> that<00:02:34.670> you<00:02:34.790> don't<00:02:34.970> agree<00:02:35.660> with

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
the reasons is that you don't agree with

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.450 
the reasons is that you don't agree with
some<00:02:36.110> of<00:02:36.200> this<00:02:36.320> is<00:02:36.590> that<00:02:36.830> there's<00:02:37.250> no

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:37.460 
some of this is that there's no

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:39.730 
some of this is that there's no
psychological<00:02:38.270> change<00:02:38.810> in<00:02:39.050> the<00:02:39.410> person's

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:39.740 
psychological change in the person's

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:41.620 
psychological change in the person's
behavior<00:02:39.890> but<00:02:40.580> as<00:02:40.670> I<00:02:40.790> go<00:02:40.910> to<00:02:40.970> this<00:02:41.150> next<00:02:41.390> can<00:02:41.540> we

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
behavior but as I go to this next can we

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:43.360 
behavior but as I go to this next can we
head<00:02:41.750> go<00:02:41.840> to<00:02:41.870> the<00:02:42.020> next<00:02:42.200> animation<00:02:43.070> because<00:02:43.220> I

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
head go to the next animation because I

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:44.410 
head go to the next animation because I
want<00:02:43.550> to<00:02:43.580> do<00:02:43.700> it<00:02:43.760> just<00:02:43.910> a<00:02:44.000> back<00:02:44.180> to<00:02:44.330> back

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
want to do it just a back to back

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.650 
want to do it just a back to back
comparison<00:02:44.990> if<00:02:45.470> we<00:02:45.740> can<00:02:46.030> this<00:02:47.030> is<00:02:47.240> a<00:02:47.270> this<00:02:47.600> is

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
comparison if we can this is a this is

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.170 
comparison if we can this is a this is
the<00:02:47.930> sleeve<00:02:48.260> surgery<00:02:48.920> this<00:02:49.250> is<00:02:49.400> a<00:02:49.430> gastric

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
the sleeve surgery this is a gastric

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:51.730 
the sleeve surgery this is a gastric
bypass<00:02:50.630> surgery<00:02:50.660> now<00:02:51.200> how<00:02:51.320> is<00:02:51.440> this<00:02:51.560> different

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:51.740 
bypass surgery now how is this different

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:53.680 
bypass surgery now how is this different
so<00:02:52.370> this<00:02:52.640> operation<00:02:53.030> is<00:02:53.209> different<00:02:53.540> because

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
so this operation is different because

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.240 
so this operation is different because
we're<00:02:53.870> actually<00:02:53.959> removing<00:02:54.650> a<00:02:54.739> portion<00:02:55.070> of<00:02:55.160> the

we're actually removing a portion of the

this<00:03:45.799> is<00:03:46.100> the<00:03:46.370> gastric<00:03:46.730> bypass<00:03:47.120> and<00:03:47.330> explained

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660 
this is the gastric bypass and explained

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.720 
this is the gastric bypass and explained
this<00:03:47.870> so<00:03:48.440> what<00:03:48.620> you<00:03:48.709> see<00:03:48.920> here<00:03:48.950> is<00:03:49.370> we<00:03:49.519> make<00:03:49.700> a

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:49.730 
this so what you see here is we make a

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.759 
this so what you see here is we make a
very<00:03:50.000> small<00:03:50.120> proximal<00:03:50.900> gastric<00:03:51.260> pouch<00:03:51.440> we

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:51.769 
very small proximal gastric pouch we

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:53.979 
very small proximal gastric pouch we
divide<00:03:52.190> it<00:03:52.430> from<00:03:52.730> the<00:03:52.850> remainder<00:03:53.299> of<00:03:53.330> the<00:03:53.570> 90%

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:53.989 
divide it from the remainder of the 90%

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:56.080 
divide it from the remainder of the 90%
of<00:03:54.200> the<00:03:54.290> stomach<00:03:54.680> in<00:03:55.100> order<00:03:55.489> for<00:03:55.670> the<00:03:55.760> food<00:03:55.940> to

of the stomach in order for the food to
get<00:03:56.209> downstream<00:03:56.840> we<00:03:57.019> divide<00:03:57.320> the<00:03:57.530> bowel<00:03:57.769> and

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.130 
get downstream we divide the bowel and

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:59.800 
get downstream we divide the bowel and
make<00:03:58.370> a<00:03:58.400> connection<00:03:58.790> between<00:03:59.120> that<00:03:59.480> small

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
make a connection between that small

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.440 
make a connection between that small
stomach<00:04:00.230> and<00:04:00.380> the<00:04:01.250> rest<00:04:01.459> of<00:04:01.610> the<00:04:01.760> the<00:04:02.060> internal
