00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:08.099
 hello to everyone you said this channel 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.260
 Omsk dota today I would like to show 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:13.110
 you set but omniknayt and its name 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:17.070
 screw paladin let's consider 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:21.510
 model of our fire like this pretty 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:23.070
 our paladin looks unusual 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.039
 would say about this kit 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:30.810
 it's pretty old as in principle 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:33.300
 All sets but I find and perhaps this 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:37.020
 the most expensive set although I don't consider it 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:40.590
 most beautiful but as much as you can 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:43.910
 pay attention to this network as well 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:46.530
 applicable to the name of all parts of the set 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:49.320
 made in such kind of wings 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.530
 here we have wings on our shoulders 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:55.980
 wings son something symbolizes helmets 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:01:00.230
 hermes and also here on the way here 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:02.789
 the wings and on the back also wings 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:05.479
 things are pretty pretty but my 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:08.580
 look they are not very combined like that 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:12.330
 everything seems to be about one thing but fulfilled in 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.320
 different manners well I can understand what it is 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.290
 possibly 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:19.280
 old sets once upon a time about this not 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:22.250
 thought about it, but there is such a flaw 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:26.159
 so basically things are pretty though 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:29.810
 textures they are not so cool 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:32.340
 involved in all sets but me to y 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.030
 almost everyone has problems 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.720
 with textures 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:39.600
 In the game we consider it in detail so 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.990
 with regards to parts of this asset given 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.630
 consists of five parts 2 rak and 3 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.930
 ankammon ok well let's see how 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.970
 departure nickname in the game 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:53.070
 Here we have such paladins very much 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.590
 differ that is immediately clear that the fluff 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.200
 different top appearance we have different then 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.310
 there are these kind of wings on 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:04.079
 shoulders and head make themselves felt 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.280
 cute helmet reminds me of something 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:08.610
 this helmet 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.090
 some character from sword heroes and 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.620
 of magic 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:15.510
 Like 5 or 4 series was the cover such 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:18.959
 Well, in front omnik looks like this 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:21.300
 from behind they look like this to me 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:23.520
 like this cloak with this pair of pretty 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.440
 still cute how can you draw 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.569
 attention he is a two-level i.e. 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:31.560
 We are behind the cloak still such 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:34.200
 extra century. in general cloak 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:37.020
 Good, in principle, I approve and helmet with 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:41.040
 shoulders but here they are somehow not very 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:44.700
 combined that is something in my opinion 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:47.940
 there is no well let's consider the model 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:51.239
 to the icons of our clever men from here 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:53.069
 icon with a very cool helmet on my 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.670
 look but here's how you can draw 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:57.630
 Attention 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:03:01.560
 textures terrible literal very bad 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:05.550
 texture that is very strong here 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.150
 flaw well and the standard wiseacher everyone 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:08.670
 habitual 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:13.440
 without any helmets caps and other things with 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:16.019
 pigtail so well this was all we had 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.820
