00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:02.190 
hey everyone so I've got the Java fan

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.090 
hey everyone so I've got the Java fan
out<00:00:02.429> the<00:00:02.610> 15<00:00:03.030> gallon<00:00:03.440> and<00:00:04.440> I've<00:00:04.589> actually<00:00:04.740> got

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
out the 15 gallon and I've actually got

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.740 
out the 15 gallon and I've actually got
quite<00:00:05.430> a<00:00:05.460> lot<00:00:05.759> and<00:00:05.940> it<00:00:06.000> looks<00:00:06.210> pretty<00:00:06.480> healthy

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
quite a lot and it looks pretty healthy

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.759 
quite a lot and it looks pretty healthy
I<00:00:07.109> mean<00:00:07.230> you<00:00:08.160> better<00:00:08.370> grown<00:00:08.760> in<00:00:09.000> I<00:00:09.500> think<00:00:10.500> the

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
I mean you better grown in I think the

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.049 
I mean you better grown in I think the
lights<00:00:10.980> might<00:00:11.219> be<00:00:11.370> actually<00:00:11.700> a<00:00:11.730> bit<00:00:11.910> too

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
lights might be actually a bit too

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:13.370 
lights might be actually a bit too
bright<00:00:12.300> for<00:00:12.360> it<00:00:12.570> cause<00:00:12.750> it's<00:00:12.900> turned<00:00:13.170> a<00:00:13.259> bit

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
bright for it cause it's turned a bit

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.150 
bright for it cause it's turned a bit
yellow<00:00:13.590> but<00:00:14.179> seems<00:00:15.179> okay<00:00:15.450> I<00:00:15.480> got<00:00:15.690> some<00:00:16.160> very

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
yellow but seems okay I got some very

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.349 
yellow but seems okay I got some very
nice<00:00:17.310> new<00:00:17.580> roof<00:00:17.850> on<00:00:18.060> that<00:00:19.250> now<00:00:20.250> I<00:00:20.520> was<00:00:20.939> thinking

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
nice new roof on that now I was thinking

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.310 
nice new roof on that now I was thinking
I'd<00:00:22.260> like<00:00:22.500> lots<00:00:22.800> of<00:00:22.980> fish<00:00:23.189> in<00:00:23.550> a<00:00:24.449> tank<00:00:24.660> so<00:00:25.050> I've

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
I'd like lots of fish in a tank so I've

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.050 
I'd like lots of fish in a tank so I've
gotta<00:00:25.500> make<00:00:25.650> lots<00:00:26.070> of<00:00:26.220> space<00:00:26.430> available<00:00:27.000> to

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
gotta make lots of space available to

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.830 
gotta make lots of space available to
them<00:00:27.330> at<00:00:28.230> current<00:00:28.710> I've<00:00:28.859> got<00:00:29.039> like<00:00:29.189> two<00:00:29.429> bitter

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:29.840 
them at current I've got like two bitter

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.200 
them at current I've got like two bitter
logs<00:00:30.840> wood<00:00:31.199> in<00:00:31.830> there<00:00:32.579> which<00:00:32.790> trying<00:00:33.149> to

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
logs wood in there which trying to

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.260 
logs wood in there which trying to
minimize<00:00:33.600> a<00:00:33.630> space<00:00:34.700> so<00:00:35.700> I<00:00:35.730> was<00:00:35.940> thinking<00:00:36.239> about

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
minimize a space so I was thinking about

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.700 
minimize a space so I was thinking about
doing<00:00:36.540> this<00:00:36.750> just<00:00:36.989> hitting<00:00:37.290> all<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.469> Java

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
doing this just hitting all the Java

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.950 
doing this just hitting all the Java
thing<00:00:37.980> like<00:00:38.129> this<00:00:38.309> in<00:00:39.239> Java<00:00:39.570> feeling<00:00:39.899> I

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
thing like this in Java feeling I

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.740 
thing like this in Java feeling I
thought<00:00:40.200> and<00:00:40.440> densely<00:00:41.399> tie<00:00:41.760> it<00:00:41.969> along<00:00:42.239> here<00:00:42.510> so

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
thought and densely tie it along here so

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.779 
thought and densely tie it along here so
what<00:00:42.930> this<00:00:43.050> whole<00:00:43.230> thing<00:00:43.500> will<00:00:43.620> be<00:00:43.710> covered<00:00:44.070> if

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
what this whole thing will be covered if

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.819 
what this whole thing will be covered if
you<00:00:45.030> got<00:00:45.239> a<00:00:45.270> distance<00:00:45.899> fish<00:00:46.110> tanks<00:00:46.440> channel

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
you got a distance fish tanks channel

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.850 
you got a distance fish tanks channel
and<00:00:47.090> you<00:00:48.090> go<00:00:48.239> on<00:00:48.329> to<00:00:48.629> 20<00:00:49.110> you'll<00:00:49.410> faint

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
and you go on to 20 you'll faint

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.459 
and you go on to 20 you'll faint
he's<00:00:50.399> got<00:00:50.610> java<00:00:50.879> thin<00:00:51.180> then<00:00:51.600> that<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:52.170> narrow

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
he's got java thin then that the narrow

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.100 
he's got java thin then that the narrow
leaf<00:00:52.739> variety<00:00:52.920> really<00:00:53.699> thick<00:00:53.910> up<00:00:54.059> a<00:00:54.149> log<00:00:54.390> and

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
leaf variety really thick up a log and

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.479 
leaf variety really thick up a log and
trying<00:00:55.500> me<00:00:55.649> another<00:00:55.890> thick<00:00:56.129> because<00:00:56.280> I

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
trying me another thick because I

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.069 
trying me another thick because I
thought<00:00:56.670> that<00:00:56.730> was<00:00:57.059> just<00:00:57.210> really<00:00:57.329> effective

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
thought that was just really effective

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.950 
thought that was just really effective
so<00:00:58.350> did<00:00:59.340> he<00:00:59.430> I'm<00:00:59.550> gonna<00:00:59.760> be<00:00:59.879> untying<00:01:00.359> them<00:01:00.600> and

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
so did he I'm gonna be untying them and

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.680 
so did he I'm gonna be untying them and
tying<00:01:01.859> it<00:01:01.949> on<00:01:02.070> here<00:01:02.489> now<00:01:02.969> quite<00:01:03.210> like<00:01:03.449> this

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
tying it on here now quite like this

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.240 
tying it on here now quite like this
piece<00:01:04.110> because<00:01:04.320> it's<00:01:04.650> got<00:01:04.799> like<00:01:05.010> a<00:01:05.040> little

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
piece because it's got like a little

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.200 
piece because it's got like a little
arch<00:01:05.939> that<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.689> fish<00:01:06.930> can<00:01:07.110> swim<00:01:07.140> under<00:01:08.150> so<00:01:09.150> I

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
arch that the fish can swim under so I

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.450 
arch that the fish can swim under so I
probably<00:01:09.390> I've<00:01:10.049> I<00:01:10.200> put<00:01:10.380> this<00:01:10.470> one<00:01:10.979> with

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
probably I've I put this one with

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.630 
probably I've I put this one with
fighting<00:01:11.790> fish<00:01:12.119> are<00:01:12.450> in<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.659> pond<00:01:13.369> as<00:01:14.369> I<00:01:14.490> was

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
fighting fish are in the pond as I was

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.429 
fighting fish are in the pond as I was
going<00:01:14.880> through<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:15.210> trim<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.570> Java<00:01:15.810> thin

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
going through and trim the Java thin

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.730 
going through and trim the Java thin
I<00:01:16.470> found<00:01:17.220> another<00:01:17.400> mutated<00:01:18.150> leaf<00:01:18.560> that<00:01:19.560> looks

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
I found another mutated leaf that looks

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.310 
I found another mutated leaf that looks
really<00:01:20.100> cool<00:01:20.460> it's<00:01:20.759> definitely<00:01:21.320> ordinary

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
really cool it's definitely ordinary

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.120 
really cool it's definitely ordinary
Java<00:01:22.590> fan<00:01:22.979> there<00:01:23.610> was<00:01:23.700> no<00:01:23.939> of<00:01:24.240> our<00:01:24.390> species

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
Java fan there was no of our species

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.950 
Java fan there was no of our species
when<00:01:26.130> I<00:01:26.159> put<00:01:26.400> in<00:01:26.580> and<00:01:26.850> even<00:01:27.150> Dustin<00:01:27.810> was

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
when I put in and even Dustin was

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.109 
when I put in and even Dustin was
doesn't<00:01:28.320> fish<00:01:28.500> tanks<00:01:28.890> so<00:01:29.850> that<00:01:29.880> was<00:01:30.090> a

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
doesn't fish tanks so that was a

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.780 
doesn't fish tanks so that was a
mutation<00:01:30.540> so<00:01:31.079> I've<00:01:31.740> got<00:01:31.950> another<00:01:32.159> one<00:01:32.280> now<00:01:32.579> it

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
mutation so I've got another one now it

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.880 
mutation so I've got another one now it
doesn't<00:01:33.030> look<00:01:33.119> too<00:01:33.270> healthy<00:01:33.479> this<00:01:33.810> one<00:01:34.020> so<00:01:34.829> I'm

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
doesn't look too healthy this one so I'm

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.679 
doesn't look too healthy this one so I'm
gonna<00:01:35.220> call<00:01:35.460> it<00:01:35.610> awful<00:01:36.000> because<00:01:36.270> I've<00:01:36.509> already

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
gonna call it awful because I've already

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.100 
gonna call it awful because I've already
got<00:01:37.079> another<00:01:37.259> one<00:01:38.360> but<00:01:39.360> this<00:01:39.509> soon<00:01:39.750> gonna<00:01:39.930> be

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
got another one but this soon gonna be

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.289 
got another one but this soon gonna be
keep<00:01:40.829> mutating<00:01:41.009> and<00:01:41.400> I<00:01:41.490> think<00:01:41.700> maybe<00:01:41.939> I've<00:01:42.119> got

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
keep mutating and I think maybe I've got

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.260 
keep mutating and I think maybe I've got
like<00:01:42.450> a<00:01:42.479> faulty<00:01:42.930> strand<00:01:43.259> but<00:01:43.850> it<00:01:44.850> doesn't<00:01:45.180> look

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
like a faulty strand but it doesn't look

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.670 
like a faulty strand but it doesn't look
too<00:01:45.450> bad<00:01:45.479> I<00:01:45.840> think<00:01:46.049> it<00:01:46.140> looks<00:01:46.290> quite<00:01:46.560> cool<00:01:48.680> you

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
too bad I think it looks quite cool you

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:50.929 
too bad I think it looks quite cool you
can<00:01:49.799> tell<00:01:50.009> out<00:01:50.159> these<00:01:50.340> plants<00:01:50.759> are<00:01:50.850> being

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
can tell out these plants are being

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.819 
can tell out these plants are being
established<00:01:51.149> for<00:01:51.840> quite<00:01:52.049> a<00:01:52.079> while<00:01:52.409> and<00:01:52.710> the

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
established for quite a while and the

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.050 
established for quite a while and the
tank<00:01:53.070> because<00:01:53.310> you<00:01:53.430> can<00:01:53.549> see<00:01:53.700> all<00:01:53.880> these

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
tank because you can see all these

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.359 
tank because you can see all these
little<00:01:54.390> roots<00:01:54.780> and<00:01:55.619> he<00:01:55.710> will<00:01:55.829> actually<00:01:56.100> round

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
little roots and he will actually round

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.569 
little roots and he will actually round
that<00:01:56.610> there<00:01:56.850> little<00:01:57.360> bit<00:01:57.630> of<00:01:57.719> wood<00:01:58.579> clinging

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
that there little bit of wood clinging

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.139 
that there little bit of wood clinging
on<00:01:59.759> so<00:02:00.409> pretty<00:02:01.409> good<00:02:01.649> quality<00:02:02.009> plant<00:02:02.280> this<00:02:02.880> is

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
on so pretty good quality plant this is

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.039 
on so pretty good quality plant this is
my<00:02:03.329> immediate<00:02:03.689> variety<00:02:04.649> I<00:02:04.860> made<00:02:05.670> myself<00:02:06.049> and

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
my immediate variety I made myself and

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.839 
my immediate variety I made myself and
actually<00:02:07.590> something<00:02:08.190> quite<00:02:08.369> good<00:02:08.640> because

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
actually something quite good because

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.330 
actually something quite good because
it's<00:02:09.030> got<00:02:09.179> a<00:02:09.209> huge<00:02:09.660> root<00:02:10.020> system<00:02:10.470> actually<00:02:11.129> I'd

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
it's got a huge root system actually I'd

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.809 
it's got a huge root system actually I'd
apply<00:02:11.790> it<00:02:11.849> from<00:02:12.239> the<00:02:12.330> law

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
apply it from the law

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:15.780 
apply it from the law
from<00:02:13.090> the<00:02:13.209> piece<00:02:13.390> of<00:02:13.420> wood<00:02:13.659> and<00:02:14.519> let's<00:02:15.519> hope

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
from the piece of wood and let's hope

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.819 
from the piece of wood and let's hope
we'll<00:02:16.269> have<00:02:16.299> more<00:02:16.749> pieces<00:02:17.019> growing<00:02:17.469> like<00:02:17.650> this

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:17.829 
we'll have more pieces growing like this

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:19.679 
we'll have more pieces growing like this
because<00:02:18.099> I<00:02:18.189> love<00:02:18.430> it<00:02:18.489> I<00:02:18.819> think<00:02:19.299> it<00:02:19.540> looks

00:02:19.679 --> 00:02:19.689 
because I love it I think it looks

00:02:19.689 --> 00:02:23.129 
because I love it I think it looks
really<00:02:20.379> cool<00:02:20.859> it's<00:02:21.370> awesome<00:02:21.730> that<00:02:21.930> and<00:02:22.930> you

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:23.139 
really cool it's awesome that and you

00:02:23.139 --> 00:02:24.959 
really cool it's awesome that and you
can<00:02:23.290> see<00:02:23.499> there's<00:02:23.769> another<00:02:23.859> little<00:02:24.519> offshoot

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:24.969 
can see there's another little offshoot

00:02:24.969 --> 00:02:27.959 
can see there's another little offshoot
that<00:02:24.999> looks<00:02:25.329> a<00:02:25.510> bit<00:02:25.540> weird<00:02:25.749> a<00:02:26.409> little<00:02:27.310> horn

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:27.969 
that looks a bit weird a little horn

00:02:27.969 --> 00:02:30.599 
that looks a bit weird a little horn
coming<00:02:28.090> out<00:02:28.510> that<00:02:28.689> side<00:02:28.989> so<00:02:29.379> may<00:02:30.250> get<00:02:30.459> some

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:30.609 
coming out that side so may get some

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:35.059 
coming out that side so may get some
weird<00:02:30.909> formations<00:02:32.609> right<00:02:33.609> so<00:02:33.819> split<00:02:34.209> up<00:02:34.689> and

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
weird formations right so split up and

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:38.190 
weird formations right so split up and
Java<00:02:36.069> fin<00:02:36.400> more<00:02:37.120> you<00:02:37.269> split<00:02:37.599> it<00:02:37.750> the<00:02:37.989> more

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
Java fin more you split it the more

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.089 
Java fin more you split it the more
gross<00:02:38.560> and<00:02:40.079> it<00:02:41.079> does<00:02:41.409> definitely<00:02:41.709> work

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:42.099 
gross and it does definitely work

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:45.390 
gross and it does definitely work
because<00:02:42.310> I<00:02:43.150> started<00:02:43.959> off<00:02:44.079> with<00:02:44.290> five<00:02:44.620> plants

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
because I started off with five plants

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.170 
because I started off with five plants
like<00:02:45.909> one<00:02:46.540> two<00:02:46.900> three<00:02:46.930> four<00:02:47.849> let's<00:02:48.849> see<00:02:49.030> that

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
like one two three four let's see that

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.179 
like one two three four let's see that
one<00:02:49.329> five<00:02:49.599> it<00:02:49.930> was<00:02:49.989> just<00:02:50.200> basically<00:02:50.530> five<00:02:50.859> tiny

00:02:51.179 --> 00:02:51.189 
one five it was just basically five tiny

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:54.330 
one five it was just basically five tiny
little<00:02:51.400> plants<00:02:51.989> goofy<00:02:52.989> be<00:02:53.169> for<00:02:53.439> like<00:02:53.590> two<00:02:54.219> or

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
little plants goofy be for like two or

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:55.800 
little plants goofy be for like two or
three<00:02:54.370> pound<00:02:54.790> that's<00:02:55.000> like<00:02:55.180> four<00:02:55.689> or<00:02:55.780> five

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
three pound that's like four or five

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:00.119 
three pound that's like four or five
dollars<00:02:56.349> and<00:02:56.819> I<00:02:58.169> split<00:02:59.169> up<00:02:59.409> and<00:02:59.590> I've<00:02:59.709> ended<00:02:59.980> up

00:03:00.119 --> 00:03:00.129 
dollars and I split up and I've ended up

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:02.369 
dollars and I split up and I've ended up
with<00:03:00.280> all<00:03:00.489> this<00:03:00.669> beautiful<00:03:01.060> groove<00:03:01.480> so<00:03:02.319> it

with all this beautiful groove so it
just<00:03:02.590> shows<00:03:02.650> what<00:03:03.010> you<00:03:03.159> what<00:03:03.639> you<00:03:03.760> can<00:03:03.909> do<00:03:04.090> if

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
just shows what you what you can do if

you adore spirit Liza I've just cleaned

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.369 
you adore spirit Liza I've just cleaned
fluorescence<00:03:08.439> on<00:03:08.650> and<00:03:08.949> a<00:03:09.879> bit<00:03:10.030> of<00:03:10.150> co2<00:03:10.449> works

00:03:11.369 --> 00:03:11.379 
fluorescence on and a bit of co2 works

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:13.259 
fluorescence on and a bit of co2 works
by<00:03:11.980> the<00:03:12.010> way<00:03:12.219> I'm<00:03:12.310> putting<00:03:12.459> co2<00:03:12.760> you<00:03:13.060> about

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:13.269 
by the way I'm putting co2 you about

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:15.539 
by the way I'm putting co2 you about
them<00:03:13.419> attend<00:03:13.719> because<00:03:14.079> looking<00:03:14.859> they<00:03:15.010> get<00:03:15.189> a

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:15.549 
them attend because looking they get a

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:17.999 
them attend because looking they get a
few<00:03:16.120> algae<00:03:16.419> problems<00:03:16.840> and<00:03:17.079> algae<00:03:17.859> actually

00:03:17.999 --> 00:03:18.009 
few algae problems and algae actually

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:21.629 
few algae problems and algae actually
thrives<00:03:18.970> with<00:03:19.269> oxygen<00:03:19.900> so<00:03:20.009> I'm<00:03:21.009> gonna<00:03:21.189> put<00:03:21.459> co2

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:21.639 
thrives with oxygen so I'm gonna put co2

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:23.879 
thrives with oxygen so I'm gonna put co2
in<00:03:21.939> my<00:03:22.060> tank<00:03:22.299> I've<00:03:22.870> got<00:03:23.049> two<00:03:23.229> liter<00:03:23.470> bottle

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:23.889 
in my tank I've got two liter bottle

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:25.670 
in my tank I've got two liter bottle
Einar<00:03:24.040> and<00:03:24.310> I<00:03:24.370> might<00:03:24.519> make<00:03:24.639> a<00:03:24.699> video<00:03:24.909> on<00:03:25.150> that

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
Einar and I might make a video on that

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.409 
Einar and I might make a video on that
also<00:03:26.680> all<00:03:26.949> that's<00:03:27.159> a<00:03:27.280> motor<00:03:27.519> sprite<00:03:27.970> and<00:03:28.180> I<00:03:28.269> may

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:28.419 
also all that's a motor sprite and I may

00:03:28.419 --> 00:03:31.050 
also all that's a motor sprite and I may
give<00:03:28.629> it<00:03:28.750> you're<00:03:28.870> not<00:03:29.079> -<00:03:29.609> it's<00:03:30.609> about<00:03:30.879> eyes

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060

known<00:03:31.329> as<00:03:31.509> the<00:03:31.629> Indian<00:03:31.870> fin<00:03:32.169> so<00:03:32.530> now<00:03:33.159> I'm<00:03:33.310> gonna

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
known as the Indian fin so now I'm gonna

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.789 
known as the Indian fin so now I'm gonna
just<00:03:33.639> tie<00:03:34.060> all<00:03:34.479> of<00:03:34.689> this<00:03:34.810> on<00:03:35.199> there<00:03:35.590> right<00:03:35.739> so

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:35.799 
just tie all of this on there right so

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:38.189 
just tie all of this on there right so
I've<00:03:36.069> tied<00:03:36.280> all<00:03:36.459> the<00:03:36.549> java<00:03:36.849> thing<00:03:37.150> on<00:03:37.389> that<00:03:37.930> one

00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:38.199 
I've tied all the java thing on that one

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:40.619 
I've tied all the java thing on that one
thing<00:03:38.530> now<00:03:38.909> put<00:03:39.909> a<00:03:39.939> bit<00:03:40.090> down<00:03:40.269> there<00:03:40.479> that

00:03:40.619 --> 00:03:40.629 
thing now put a bit down there that

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:44.159 
thing now put a bit down there that
looks<00:03:40.870> quite<00:03:41.139> a<00:03:41.169> nice<00:03:41.409> pillow<00:03:41.650> up<00:03:41.769> here<00:03:42.329> and<00:03:43.329> it

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:44.169 
looks quite a nice pillow up here and it

00:03:44.169 --> 00:03:46.649 
looks quite a nice pillow up here and it
should<00:03:44.470> figure<00:03:44.769> now<00:03:45.040> hopefully<00:03:45.509> it's<00:03:46.509> not

00:03:46.649 --> 00:03:46.659 
should figure now hopefully it's not

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:49.140 
should figure now hopefully it's not
wasn't<00:03:46.870> that<00:03:47.049> bad<00:03:47.459> so<00:03:48.459> I<00:03:48.489> was<00:03:48.609> just<00:03:48.669> gonna<00:03:49.000> put
