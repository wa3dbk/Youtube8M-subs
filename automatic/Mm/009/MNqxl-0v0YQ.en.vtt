00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.320 
on the quiet again markers where you can
actually<00:01:22.560> take<00:01:23.310> these<00:01:23.520> peaks<00:01:23.850> and<00:01:24.060> you<00:01:24.150> can

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
actually take these peaks and you can

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.840 
actually take these peaks and you can
use<00:01:24.479> them<00:01:24.860> and<00:01:25.860> you<00:01:26.009> can<00:01:26.130> use<00:01:26.280> those<00:01:26.460> to<00:01:26.640> line

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
use them and you can use those to line

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.780 
use them and you can use those to line
them<00:01:27.030> up<00:01:27.140> with<00:01:28.140> another<00:01:28.350> track<00:01:28.680> so<00:01:29.610> there's

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
them up with another track so there's

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.069 
them up with another track so there's

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
lots of little visual aids here in

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.990 
lots of little visual aids here in
Toronto<00:01:31.439> there's<00:01:31.650> these<00:01:31.829> waveforms<00:01:32.490> here<00:01:32.939> at

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
Toronto there's these waveforms here at

Toronto there's these waveforms here at
the<00:01:33.119> top<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.659> blue<00:01:33.840> and<00:01:34.020> orange<00:01:34.520> will<00:01:35.520> let<00:01:35.640> you

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
the top the blue and orange will let you

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.160 
the top the blue and orange will let you
once<00:01:36.000> you've<00:01:36.150> got<00:01:36.299> your<00:01:36.329> pitch<00:01:36.659> all<00:01:36.840> locked<00:01:37.049> in

those blue and orange lines should match
up<00:01:38.790> correctly<00:01:39.270> so<00:01:39.540> let's<00:01:40.229> say<00:01:40.320> we're<00:01:40.439> just

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
up correctly so let's say we're just

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:41.749 
up correctly so let's say we're just
getting<00:01:40.770> into<00:01:40.890> beat<00:01:41.070> matching<00:01:41.250> let's<00:01:41.640> say

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
getting into beat matching let's say

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.520 
getting into beat matching let's say
you're<00:01:41.939> a<00:01:41.970> novice<00:01:42.450> you're<00:01:43.049> not<00:01:43.140> quite<00:01:43.350> there
