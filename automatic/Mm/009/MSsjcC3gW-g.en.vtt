00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
and I don't have a capture card because

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:35.020 
and I don't have a capture card because
i<00:02:30.260> have<00:02:30.410> this<00:02:30.590> so<00:02:32.560> i'll<00:02:33.560> show<00:02:34.550> you<00:02:34.610> pictures<00:02:34.970> of

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:52.549 
computer and power cord is one on the

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:59.350 
computer and power cord is one on the
end<00:02:52.700> and<00:02:54.250> all<00:02:55.250> right<00:02:55.730> I<00:02:56.000> have<00:02:56.450> that<00:02:56.630> and<00:02:57.140> um<00:02:58.360> yes

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360

pretty<00:02:59.720> much<00:02:59.810> all<00:03:00.049> you<00:03:00.110> do<00:03:00.410> and<00:03:00.650> then<00:03:02.140> you<00:03:03.140> go

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:03.320 
pretty much all you do and then you go

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:10.740 
pretty much all you do and then you go
to<00:03:03.380> the<00:03:03.620> computer<00:03:03.769> from<00:03:04.100> there<00:03:04.660> so<00:03:06.670> yeah

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:16.040 

okay<00:03:11.620> um<00:03:12.000> so<00:03:13.000> we're<00:03:13.150> on<00:03:13.300> the<00:03:13.420> computer<00:03:13.840> and

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
okay um so we're on the computer and

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:18.000 
okay um so we're on the computer and
what<00:03:17.050> you're<00:03:17.170> going<00:03:17.290> to<00:03:17.380> need<00:03:17.440> to<00:03:17.560> do<00:03:17.680> is

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
what you're going to need to do is

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.780 
what you're going to need to do is
you're<00:03:18.310> going<00:03:18.400> to<00:03:18.490> need<00:03:18.670> to<00:03:18.820> either<00:03:19.500> um

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
you're going to need to either um

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.310 
you're going to need to either um
download<00:03:21.790> a<00:03:22.030> recording<00:03:22.510> software<00:03:22.720> like

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
download a recording software like

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:29.190 
download a recording software like
descaler<00:03:23.800> which<00:03:24.640> I've<00:03:24.880> up<00:03:25.330> right<00:03:25.660> here<00:03:28.200> yeah

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
descaler which I've up right here yeah

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.820 
descaler which I've up right here yeah
let's<00:03:29.800> switch<00:03:30.130> that<00:03:30.370> to<00:03:30.550> the<00:03:31.590> boob<00:03:32.590> wait

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:32.830 
let's switch that to the boob wait

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:34.920 
let's switch that to the boob wait
that's<00:03:33.040> not<00:03:33.100> a<00:03:33.190> good<00:03:33.340> idea<00:03:33.430> oh<00:03:33.790> yeah<00:03:34.480> nevermind

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
that's not a good idea oh yeah nevermind

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.760 
that's not a good idea oh yeah nevermind
let's<00:03:35.709> switch<00:03:36.310> that<00:03:36.520> to<00:03:36.670> the<00:03:36.790> ps2<00:03:37.240> so<00:03:37.630> here<00:03:38.620> it

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:38.770 
let's switch that to the ps2 so here it

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:41.670 
let's switch that to the ps2 so here it
is<00:03:38.860> descaler<00:03:39.459> or<00:03:39.730> you<00:03:39.880> could<00:03:40.090> use<00:03:40.990> windows

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
is descaler or you could use windows

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:48.050 
is descaler or you could use windows
movie<00:03:41.950> maker<00:03:42.040> or<00:03:42.900> something<00:03:43.900> that<00:03:44.020> records

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.060 

something<00:03:49.060> that<00:03:49.209> records<00:03:50.070> gameplay

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:51.070 
something that records gameplay

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:53.040 
something that records gameplay
something<00:03:51.790> like<00:03:52.180> with<00:03:52.480> windows<00:03:52.780> movie<00:03:52.810> maker

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:53.050 
something like with windows movie maker

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:57.449 
something like with windows movie maker
is<00:03:53.410> capture<00:03:53.860> video<00:03:54.190> from<00:03:54.220> device<00:03:55.530> and<00:03:56.530> then

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
is capture video from device and then

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:01.290 
is capture video from device and then
you<00:03:57.640> just<00:03:57.880> select<00:03:58.330> I<00:03:58.570> type<00:03:59.070> and<00:04:00.070> but<00:04:01.060> we're<00:04:01.180> not

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:01.300 
you just select I type and but we're not

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:06.330 
you just select I type and but we're not
going<00:04:01.330> to<00:04:01.510> do<00:04:01.600> that<00:04:01.830> and<00:04:04.770> because<00:04:05.770> descaler<00:04:06.220> is

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
going to do that and because descaler is

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.690 
going to do that and because descaler is
better<00:04:06.550> because<00:04:06.760> it<00:04:06.970> too<00:04:07.239> many<00:04:07.330> times<00:04:07.450> and<00:04:08.700> it

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
better because it too many times and it

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.729 
better because it too many times and it
just<00:04:09.940> like<00:04:10.239> quit<00:04:10.600> off<00:04:10.720> on<00:04:10.930> me<00:04:11.080> three<00:04:11.380> seconds

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:11.739 
just like quit off on me three seconds

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:13.170 
just like quit off on me three seconds
into<00:04:11.860> it<00:04:11.980> and<00:04:12.220> i<00:04:12.340> had<00:04:12.489> a<00:04:12.520> like<00:04:12.760> a<00:04:12.820> half<00:04:13.060> hour

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180 
into it and i had a like a half hour

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:18.960 
into it and i had a like a half hour
thing<00:04:13.510> going<00:04:13.890> yeah<00:04:14.890> not<00:04:15.160> good<00:04:15.370> so<00:04:16.299> um<00:04:17.790> what<00:04:18.790> you

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970 
thing going yeah not good so um what you

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:24.650 
thing going yeah not good so um what you
need<00:04:19.209> to<00:04:19.299> do<00:04:19.419> is<00:04:19.690> turn<00:04:20.500> on<00:04:20.560> your<00:04:20.950> game<00:04:21.160> system

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:31.640 

after<00:04:25.660> it's<00:04:26.229> plugged<00:04:26.500> in<00:04:26.680> of<00:04:26.890> course<00:04:27.130> and<00:04:30.330> so

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
after it's plugged in of course and so

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:35.280 
after it's plugged in of course and so
you<00:04:32.650> can<00:04:32.860> see<00:04:33.280> it<00:04:33.400> right<00:04:33.550> there<00:04:33.960> and<00:04:34.960> the

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:35.290 
you can see it right there and the

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:37.050 
you can see it right there and the
volume<00:04:35.620> comes<00:04:36.010> or<00:04:36.430> the<00:04:36.460> sound<00:04:36.729> goes<00:04:36.880> through

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 
volume comes or the sound goes through

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:38.670 
volume comes or the sound goes through
your<00:04:37.120> speakers<00:04:37.360> I'm<00:04:37.690> not<00:04:37.870> quite<00:04:38.260> sure<00:04:38.290> how<00:04:38.650> to

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
your speakers I'm not quite sure how to

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:43.080 
your speakers I'm not quite sure how to
record<00:04:39.010> the<00:04:39.160> sound<00:04:39.479> except<00:04:40.479> I<00:04:41.640> got<00:04:42.640> it<00:04:42.910> through

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.090 
record the sound except I got it through

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.240 
record the sound except I got it through
my<00:04:43.180> eye<00:04:43.210> toy<00:04:43.540> but<00:04:44.440> that's<00:04:44.590> just<00:04:44.800> because<00:04:44.950> it

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.250 
my eye toy but that's just because it

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:46.830 
my eye toy but that's just because it
was<00:04:45.310> recording<00:04:45.790> it<00:04:45.820> from<00:04:45.970> the<00:04:46.030> speakers<00:04:46.479> and<00:04:46.690> I

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 
was recording it from the speakers and I

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.310 
was recording it from the speakers and I
guess<00:04:47.020> I<00:04:47.169> I<00:04:47.440> don't<00:04:48.400> know<00:04:48.490> I<00:04:48.729> just<00:04:49.320> somehow

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:50.320 
guess I I don't know I just somehow

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:51.990 
guess I I don't know I just somehow
screwed<00:04:50.680> up<00:04:50.830> the<00:04:50.919> setting<00:04:51.220> so<00:04:51.430> it<00:04:51.460> recorded

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
screwed up the setting so it recorded

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.680 
screwed up the setting so it recorded
from<00:04:52.120> the<00:04:52.330> speakers<00:04:52.870> but<00:04:53.620> a<00:04:54.030> say<00:04:55.030> I've<00:04:55.330> knowed

00:05:57.970 --> 00:05:57.980 
saw descaler rolls it doesn't like to

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:01.160 
saw descaler rolls it doesn't like to
follow<00:05:58.980> the<00:05:59.280> aspect<00:06:00.030> ratio<00:06:00.150> of<00:06:00.510> what<00:06:01.050> you're

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:01.170 
follow the aspect ratio of what you're

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:02.630 
follow the aspect ratio of what you're
recording<00:06:01.470> know<00:06:01.830> it<00:06:01.980> likes<00:06:02.160> to<00:06:02.250> stretch

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:02.640 
recording know it likes to stretch

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:06.590 
recording know it likes to stretch
things<00:06:02.880> out<00:06:03.120> make<00:06:03.390> it<00:06:04.140> look<00:06:04.260> all<00:06:05.270> block<00:06:06.270> it<00:06:06.450> and

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:06.600 
things out make it look all block it and

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:11.780 
things out make it look all block it and
stiffy<00:06:07.080> um<00:06:10.070> so<00:06:11.070> what<00:06:11.460> you're<00:06:11.550> going<00:06:11.640> to<00:06:11.700> need

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:17.190 
to do is find a video editor that will

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:20.600 
to do is find a video editor that will
um<00:06:18.620> get<00:06:19.620> rid<00:06:19.800> of<00:06:19.830> that<00:06:19.950> and<00:06:20.220> make<00:06:20.580> it

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:20.610 
um get rid of that and make it

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:23.450 
um get rid of that and make it
proportional<00:06:21.360> again<00:06:21.680> for<00:06:22.680> this<00:06:22.830> i<00:06:23.010> recommend

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:23.460 
proportional again for this i recommend

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:25.280 
proportional again for this i recommend
witted<00:06:23.700> windows<00:06:24.180> movie<00:06:24.480> maker<00:06:24.510> I<00:06:24.930> mean<00:06:25.140> I've

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:25.290 
witted windows movie maker I mean I've

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:32.500 
witted windows movie maker I mean I've
um<00:06:25.980> I've<00:06:28.850> premiere<00:06:29.850> like<00:06:30.390> Adobe<00:06:30.720> Premiere<00:06:31.110> but

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:32.510 
um I've premiere like Adobe Premiere but

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:35.200 
um I've premiere like Adobe Premiere but
that<00:06:33.510> doesn't<00:06:33.870> get<00:06:34.170> rid<00:06:34.290> of<00:06:34.320> the<00:06:34.440> aspect<00:06:34.830> ratio

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:35.210 
that doesn't get rid of the aspect ratio

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:40.100 
that doesn't get rid of the aspect ratio
so<00:06:37.850> this<00:06:38.850> is<00:06:39.000> all<00:06:39.120> stretched<00:06:39.420> out<00:06:39.600> but<00:06:39.870> here

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:40.110 
so this is all stretched out but here

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:45.380 
so this is all stretched out but here
it's<00:06:40.880> like<00:06:41.880> regular<00:06:42.770> sorta<00:06:43.850> as<00:06:44.850> regular<00:06:45.270> is

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:45.390 
it's like regular sorta as regular is

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:50.750 
it's like regular sorta as regular is
