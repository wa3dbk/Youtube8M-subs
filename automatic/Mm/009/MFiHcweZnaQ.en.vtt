00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 hello good kids we are here 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.400
 new advance warfare video is 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.859
 saying a game of weapons game 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.260
 well let's see on this map that the 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.030
 it really costs quite that with a 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:14.910
 rachita because they leave by all 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:18.480
 sites I know who is doing it a bit 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.849
 one and over with the weapons of 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.759
 and then not from the one that does 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:26.430
 ten or one thing if the glasses almost everything 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:28.939
 that that still costs more come to take 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.939
 repair 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:34.590
 we go 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.590
 I have seen 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:40.350
 in love of couples 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:47.300
 let's see I do not know where are we going 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:51.310
 a supplies are already here they are 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.310
 here we go that there are a few 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:56.969
 here what happens that I have no way out and 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:00.300
 You can catch me pretty easy, okay, but 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:02.129
 this area seems pretty good 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.980
 now to endure is a little bit to see 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.240
 because there are some jumping around here 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:11.579
 and someone was missing 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.579
 it's not going 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:19.010
 fuck what a mania 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:26.729
 the other supply that we go and this 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:26.729
 because he said- 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:33.460
 on either side of him because he sent two 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.510
 supplies and the streak of ten 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:38.110
 that I was carrying the truth that I was 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:42.560
 holding up pretty well for that part 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:44.990
 Well, he has not caught the other 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.000
 I have the daily challenge completed like this 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.180
 I do not know exactly why he gave me 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.180
 two 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:55.100
 uncle have killed us like let's go 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:02.970
 but let's go up here 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:05.520
 we go well there I had it wrong I had to 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:08.130
 try it short distance because if 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.429
 not here 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.429
 fuck 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.470
 let's run runs 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.720
 you or metro there has thrown me to see 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.910
 if I could kill him a little easier but 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:30.330
 not so 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:31.980
 but you want to die you're worth it 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:37.280
 let's jump around here and see if I do not 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:37.280
 I have not caught up 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:45.970
 Come on, come on, let go of me, I'll give 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.970
 to have 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:49.670
 where are they 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:51.240
 I must have seen someone 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.890
 safe 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:56.090
 with the jumps that 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.800
 we go 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.599
 but I'm going to get in here inside that 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.940
 This part is also quite there 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:03.590
 there dead 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.470
 this part is pretty good too 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:08.120
 because they never stop being born here 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.840
 first thing they do then is jump by 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:13.000
 this part 2 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:18.760
 until the next day 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.760
 I'm more dead than alive, worth worth 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:27.740
 I did not take it off is a win kid 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:32.260
 what it costs me to kill 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:32.260
 therefore gave two fast or three 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:41.560
 the back is worth the pistolitas 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:44.730
 is I want to see what it costs me toba and 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.730
 I like this too 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:53.590
 the maximum is already bundled 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:53.590
 worth 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.440
 Y 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:04.810
 I have taken those killed said 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.810
 which he gave the lad by ando 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:12.560
 but it has been missing 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:12.560
 in 1999 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:20.060
 the blade of a knife 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:23.070
 fuck kid to stop the game now 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:28.280
 stop the game explained 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:31.040
 and this one that is up there was not there 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:35.330
 I was almost humiliated again 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:35.330
 I give them a lot of love 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:42.140
 but they do not die 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.710
 is not normal this is not normal what I 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:47.580
 happen to me 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:49.830
 really let's go metal man goes and 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:53.150
 been flying and still good is saved 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:53.150
 good good humiliate me 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:01.300
 and I'm super red has given me a 

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:03.870
 pistolita of a shot to see if we caught 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.870
 someone around here 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:06.690
 fuck 

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:13.190
 and everything sliding does not want to recharge 

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:17.990
 a lot two hours 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:19.610
 decision finally will continue with that 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:21.230
 I gave her before she was very pretty 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:22.880
 I wanted to see her and they thought that she had 

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:25.490
 finished and they just killed him before 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:27.680
 that burst the valley stazo but good 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:29.930
 26-14 we have killed then at least 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:31.760
 five times there's last now that you've 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:33.620
 been that since the valley is started 

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:34.910
 It has touched me, it is that as you 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:36.530
 humiliate in the last so fuck 

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:39.350
 enough because your turn again 

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:41.240
 bazooka that and I'm terrible with those 

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:42.680
 things but good to win everything quite 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:46.330
 well the game so I do not expect anything 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:46.330
