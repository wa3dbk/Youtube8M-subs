00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 It is a double crafting box and 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.899
 this time it's about the murder exchanges 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.750
 or external workbench you can see 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.070
 time he has a huge holds the 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.420
 I am going to get full power recipes now 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.620
 not single I will go through 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.949
 Show you all and the 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:21.720
 you can also open them all up 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.859
 find the homepage of the mod yes if 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.760
 it's just once a few things out 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.990
 and you can not see anything here 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.689
 newly added 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.359
 you can be quiet times we 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.040
 Become an excellent stones word 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.440
 External one could want every single one 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.010
 sword with this extension then 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.469
 use 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.510
 then you can all these items 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.660
 make faster, such as one 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.980
 ax a scoop a high or a scoop 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.930
 pickaxe then there are better 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.730
 armor I catch the best with that 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.260
 Of course, they also have them 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.149
 a better stronger than the others 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.289
 I wanted to pay even as the roughly 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.090
 then you would look like this 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.320
 Anhalt you can already see the armor 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.469
 up here at the face a bit 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.270
 changed the iron armor and the 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:03.750
 then always the next armor 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.549
 purely what exactly the values the exact 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.990
 Of course, I am a bit better 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.400
 knows for example in certain matters 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.840
 that the swords are stronger that is 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.150
 logical that all will be stronger 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.040
 Angles slightly improved that she 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.189
 keeps the vehicle a bit longer, for example 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:20.490
 from here you can for example a 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.780
 work a bit better than fire and 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.619
 There is also a card for him right now 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.790
 wonder how addicted they are 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.770
 have to have taken the really 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:30.479
 had the taken with me 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:33.240
 on a map the a little better one 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.380
 thus can and so on I find that 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.400
 not right now but not otherwise 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.170
 dramatic that would be completely the 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.110
 be compass then we have here 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.579
 once the change out the leather rust 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.689
 and if you can color that you can 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.490
 you try it yourself 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.049
 I do not know that's the normal one 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.579
 new leather armor then how to get the 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.740
 this has improved somewhat in this way 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.990
 know little odd because of 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.600
 from one if only the face 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.720
 bit rausguckt why japan fehmarn 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.000
 wi 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:01.570
 yes, no matter then we'll pack the golden one 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.890
 they are already a little bit alright 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.700
 that's how you can see it here 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.640
 you have a weird here 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.720
 skull then yes that so much sun through 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.920
 such a crown are so far 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.110
 was shaped 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.850
 then we'll pack the diamond here 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.160
 armor and you can already see 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.510
 a little more noble and as I said the 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.190
 Armor is a bit stronger 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.170
 as the normal it will be too 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.420
 not extended hot so improved 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.830
 or maybe one too 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.630
 a little longer the durability made 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.950
 so entrepreneur now times the first here 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.290
 out and of one with the whole 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.520
 do not swear at the other items 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.980
 once in a while so easy 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.350
 imagine how this look like that 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.850
 want us here a monster still in there 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:42.700
 Let's start with the gold value 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:43.870
 long need for the third 1 233 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.850
 love is needed for that 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:51.070
 until the livestock is dead one is that here 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:52.690
 the iron sword 12 you need two 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.950
 strikes with the iron sword 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:03:01.720
 wooden sword, we probably need more 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:03:03.280
 as 123 and three bat so gold and 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.420
 Woods have remained about the same as 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.010
 It was already then 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.540
 so now where it again very briefly 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.540
 after an army with the stone sword 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.500
 1233 strikes hard with the stone 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.580
 theme even heavier outside 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.380
 that would normally have to be with one 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.690
 I think even I know it 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.489
 Not 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.690
 12 just as iron as diamond 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:24.790
 a bit stronger with others 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:28.690
 so I must say well then we take 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.860
 now the shovels in front of us 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.510
 mainly in any case the 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.580
 durability were extended by 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:37.650
 which made a bit longer 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:39.670
 thus yes-word relatively normal 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.019
 a shovel and that does not work 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.850
 more broken as fast as fire 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:44.920
 Sometimes you can live very well with gold 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:46.180
 which is still broken quickly but 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.680
 I think so after a few 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.600
 meter had already been excavated was the 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.860
 usually already in the bucket and that is 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:53.560
 now here is not the case that stop 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.970
 a little bit longer than usual 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.920
 everything is with iron, I think 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:58.120
 remains the same for a long time 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:01.330
 longer than fire and here my cave 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:03.220
 sand with sand sand sand 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:04.810
 shoveling but there's not but 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.709
 Stein is a bit of a thinker 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:10.050
 faster than with 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:11.520
 with wood has just been back 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:13.650
 the goal was there, unfortunately I can not do anything 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:16.230
 for others was and a new black ops 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:18.239
 few times then I'll grab the here 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:20.400
 all garbage back here we are now 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:22.440
 not need it then it is now 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.970
 manage the ax again very quickly 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.530
 here is the audi I think times explained 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:27.480
 that is not really so 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.040
 necessary that is and someone will think 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.660
 I once even be fast enough so as 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:33.690
 it should be stop then ever out 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:36.030
 that here also then have that 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:38.010
 I still have that here and this one 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:39.389
 let's start at the man jacques 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:40.590
 Of course, that will be fast as well 

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:44.280
 always as you can see here 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:46.290
 we need the wood species longer so one 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.210
 looks zack Zack Zack goes one 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:50.520
 already relatively fast the diamond, then 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:53.040
 really very fast with the wood 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:54.120
 wax off the wood axalp normally 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.590
 would be a bit faster 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.630
 So I say normal speed because of the 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:00.900
 there is a bit of it there 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:02.639
 Stone with the pickaxe still holds 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.080
 relatively slow, I think so 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:05.930
 is really a bit painful 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.729
 you so on stone level I would say 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:11.160
 and from where did the Steirerin we have the 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:11.910
 stone yes because I have to say that 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.289
 is at a level 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:16.289
 Honestly, that would already be up 

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:19.229
 estimate travel level and will then 

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:20.729
 probably someone level have that yes 

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:24.090
 that's as fast as possible 

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:25.890
 you can see and diamond the ah that 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:28.530
 it's okay that it will be soon 

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:29.910
 efficiency equal and yes you can see 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:32.700
 What this is before affects the raw materials 

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:34.620
 go also difficult to break down so then 

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:37.430
 Let's have a look with the lighter 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:39.600
 do not normally fire anywhere 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:40.979
 you can usually see that 

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:43.289
 I can get off the vehicle relatively quickly 

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:44.370
 Here is also relatively much down 

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:45.630
 but I think that would be meanwhile 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:48.210
 already arrived at the middle 

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:50.700
 So you can put much more fire 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:51.539
 as a fire so put 20 percent more 

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:53.100
 I believe in the forum 

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:54.389
 that could be so even though it is all by itself 

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:56.970
 You can read one which one can 

00:05:54.389 --> 00:05:58.680
 put a lot of fire and the angel 

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:00.150
 I think will explain 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:02.460
 It also lasts a bit longer 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:03.960
 From the bow I think mine 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:09.900
 I have better shot power I get 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:11.010
 quite a few arrows out there because of the 

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:12.150
 has a bit better power looks 

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:16.950
 but may look a bit different 

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:18.139
 I have to be a few more longer yes that is 

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:20.990
 a bit more comfortable 

00:06:18.139 --> 00:06:21.680
 as the other one I would say good then 

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:23.749
 we actually have everything here 

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:24.889
 presented and I would say that was 

00:06:23.749 --> 00:06:26.360
 it actually already from this motto 

00:06:24.889 --> 00:06:27.529
 if you liked it then look 

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:29.449
 but also with the other videos over 

00:06:27.529 --> 00:06:30.919
 and if you really need it again 

00:06:29.449 --> 00:06:33.199
 liked the video then lies 

00:06:30.919 --> 00:06:34.879
 like to or write me one 

00:06:33.199 --> 00:06:36.560
 another place purely I imagine 

00:06:34.879 --> 00:06:37.610
 that should be such a long one for me 

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:40.039
 I still have that wish of mine 

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:42.050
 and the block I was looking for an eternity 

00:06:40.039 --> 00:06:43.580
 and does not find a yes and how to do this 

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:46.729
 crafting box is also quite 

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:48.229
 Just take one time I show you 

00:06:46.729 --> 00:06:50.409
 travel this time off how to get one 

00:06:48.229 --> 00:06:52.580
 beautiful someone ax for that 

00:06:50.409 --> 00:06:54.050
 you see is a single and once 

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:57.469
 I then miss my other one 

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:58.729
 Two of these are important 

00:06:57.469 --> 00:07:01.129
 even with the installation that he the 

00:06:58.729 --> 00:07:02.539
 mods itself to the mods folder packs and 

00:07:01.129 --> 00:07:04.729
 progress back into the minecraft yes 

00:07:02.539 --> 00:07:07.180
 yes that was true to this motto view thank you 

00:07:04.729 --> 00:07:07.180
 for watching
