because<00:02:42.060> i<00:02:42.150> don't<00:02:42.330> have<00:02:42.510> individual

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
because i don't have individual

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.600 
because i don't have individual
compartments<00:02:43.409> for<00:02:43.769> each<00:02:43.920> individual<00:02:44.519> model

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
compartments for each individual model

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.039 
compartments for each individual model
so<00:02:47.610> for<00:02:47.909> some<00:02:48.060> models<00:02:48.330> you<00:02:48.390> won't<00:02:48.569> do<00:02:48.660> that<00:02:48.690> but

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
so for some models you won't do that but

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:51.080 
so for some models you won't do that but

for fire warriors i just seen your

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.030 
for fire warriors i just seen your
reason<00:02:51.360> for<00:02:51.599> it<00:02:51.690> they<00:02:52.319> don't<00:02:52.500> really<00:02:52.680> come

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
reason for it they don't really come

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.190 
reason for it they don't really come
apart<00:02:53.160> in<00:02:53.879> order<00:02:54.480> to<00:02:54.629> get<00:02:54.720> the<00:02:54.810> one<00:02:54.959> piece

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
apart in order to get the one piece

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.380 
apart in order to get the one piece
metal<00:02:56.099> still<00:02:56.549> so<00:02:56.700> they<00:02:56.879> don't<00:02:57.060> really<00:02:57.209> come

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
metal still so they don't really come

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.350
