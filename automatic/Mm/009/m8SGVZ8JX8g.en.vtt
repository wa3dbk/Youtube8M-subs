in water on that cuz speaking of that
listen<00:05:49.770> is

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:50.330 
listen is

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:53.290 
listen is
a<00:05:50.389> humectant<00:05:50.900> which<00:05:51.830> pulls<00:05:52.669> the<00:05:53.030> moisture

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:53.300 
a humectant which pulls the moisture

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:55.510 
a humectant which pulls the moisture
from<00:05:53.810> the<00:05:54.110> air<00:05:54.289> and<00:05:54.800> the<00:05:54.919> humidity<00:05:55.189> outside

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:55.520 
from the air and the humidity outside

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.760 
from the air and the humidity outside
and<00:05:56.330> brings<00:05:56.900> it<00:05:57.050> into<00:05:57.169> your<00:05:57.349> hair<00:05:57.560> which

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:57.770 
and brings it into your hair which

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:59.679 
and brings it into your hair which
caused<00:05:58.310> your<00:05:58.460> hair<00:05:58.610> to<00:05:58.639> be<00:05:58.879> no<00:05:59.120> nice<00:05:59.479> and
