00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 I knew we could have a city ​​of 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:07.020
 motorcycles specialized in motorcycle invaded 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.970
 of adventurous motorcycles on motorcycles complicate 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.550
 they are uploaded to all the bikes 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:15.179
 we are not going up we have chatted 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:20.400
 enamored breaded negotiated produced 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:23.330
 everything from the real photos of the 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.330
 motorcycle cities 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:37.339
 by themes he has used here in Beni and 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:40.489
 it is more comfortable to mobilize the 

00:00:37.339 --> 00:00:41.960
 we go every day our transport 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:44.250
 to get to school on the bike my 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.380
 sister you take us 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.360
 although we live far from the center we take 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.640
 7 minutes to get here the boys 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.500
 although they can not equal handle them 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.050
 I advise you not to do it but without 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:01:01.430
 But there are people like 20 years old who 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:01.430
 they handle worse than those of 10 or 11 years 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:07.630
 how about 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.680
 handles more boys because mostly 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:18.650
 here the woman is one of the most caring 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:21.320
 and instead the easy guys give you 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:24.340
 I do not have motorbikes but I know 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.340
 they are going to buy a studio 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:35.110
 and I hope that when the police before 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.850
 they say that one can not handle this as 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.290
 some discrimination because the 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.510
 equality managed when they were young 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.590
 we can already have permission 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:45.720
 We are 15 years old 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:50.180
 to handle this is a motorcycle match 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.180
 of the motorcycle that come to the square 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:03.460
 a motorcycle costs approximately 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:06.610
 14 thousand bolivianos in riberalta there is more 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:09.720
 of 6 thousand motorcycles can you imagine how much 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.720
 money is that 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:22.840
 very good on my bike and I baptized her 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:26.250
 as gertrudis riberalta is that a life 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.250
 as the city of the motorcycle because 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.629
 enough motorcycles like 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.629
 and also because it's pretty hot 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.530
 it refreshes 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.050
 the students when they are with the 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:44.230
 school clothes of others 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:46.380
 my motorcycle in motion where I am 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:49.500
 I move are like my feet 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:52.850
 well now we need to move 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:55.460
 let's go young we go bent 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:57.820
 my motorcycle is the maximum that can be left 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:57.820
 to walk 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:10.670
 I'm going to lose my lord 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:13.030
 I have my querencia there are 1 million 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.030
 this time 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.940
 yes no 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.700
 yes 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.959
 liberal to employ all his people because 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:49.360
 they do not know they have said they do not attend 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:51.879
 refused to accept cars and will bring 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:54.400
 cars to the city of riberalta but not 

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:59.370
