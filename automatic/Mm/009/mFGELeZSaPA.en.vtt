00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.530 
so what is the story with the economy I
think<00:03:36.709> well<00:03:37.069> one<00:03:37.370> this<00:03:37.730> bite<00:03:38.030> will<00:03:38.360> have<00:03:38.510> a

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
think well one this bite will have a

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.630 
think well one this bite will have a
range<00:03:38.840> in<00:03:39.079> sport<00:03:39.650> mode<00:03:39.920> which<00:03:39.950> means<00:03:40.370> it's

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 
range in sport mode which means it's

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.059 
range in sport mode which means it's
really<00:03:41.209> really<00:03:41.720> fast<00:03:41.989> and<00:03:42.349> will<00:03:42.709> accelerate

00:03:43.059 --> 00:03:43.069 
really really fast and will accelerate

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:46.750 
really really fast and will accelerate
as<00:03:43.549> quick<00:03:43.819> as<00:03:44.000> wait<00:03:44.420> for<00:03:44.720> it<00:03:44.840> as<00:03:44.989> a<00:03:45.260> Ferrari<00:03:45.760> can

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
as quick as wait for it as a Ferrari can

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:47.589 
as quick as wait for it as a Ferrari can
you<00:03:46.909> believe<00:03:47.299> that

00:03:47.589 --> 00:03:47.599 
you believe that

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:49.839 
you believe that
but<00:03:48.170> in<00:03:48.290> that<00:03:48.439> mode<00:03:48.650> you'll<00:03:48.829> get<00:03:48.950> 100<00:03:49.310> KS<00:03:49.549> put

00:03:49.839 --> 00:03:49.849 
but in that mode you'll get 100 KS put

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:52.690 
but in that mode you'll get 100 KS put
it<00:03:49.939> in<00:03:50.260> Eco<00:03:51.260> mode<00:03:51.290> and<00:03:51.799> ride<00:03:52.250> up<00:03:52.280> and<00:03:52.579> down

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
it in Eco mode and ride up and down
