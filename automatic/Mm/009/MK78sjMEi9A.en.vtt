on<00:01:50.520> genetics<00:01:50.880> my<00:01:51.000> hover<00:01:51.450> over<00:01:51.689> this<00:01:51.840> you<00:01:52.409> can

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
on genetics my hover over this you can

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.609 
on genetics my hover over this you can
say<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:52.950> age<00:01:53.100> is<00:01:53.810> out<00:01:54.810> of<00:01:54.960> ten<00:01:55.170> so<00:01:55.380> we've<00:01:55.500> got

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
say the age is out of ten so we've got

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.709 
say the age is out of ten so we've got
for<00:01:55.860> because<00:01:56.009> this<00:01:56.130> horses<00:01:56.549> just<00:01:57.060> over<00:01:57.509> four

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
for because this horses just over four

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.350 
for because this horses just over four
years<00:01:57.960> so<00:01:58.950> I<00:01:59.009> actually<00:01:59.219> just<00:01:59.549> notice<00:01:59.969> an<00:02:00.060> agent

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
years so I actually just notice an agent

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.410 
years so I actually just notice an agent
wants<00:02:00.570> just<00:02:00.780> to<00:02:00.930> show<00:02:01.290> you<00:02:01.729> if<00:02:02.729> I<00:02:02.820> hover<00:02:03.030> over

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
wants just to show you if I hover over

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.600 
wants just to show you if I hover over
this<00:02:03.719> again<00:02:04.350> now<00:02:04.590> it<00:02:04.649> says<00:02:04.829> five<00:02:04.860> at<00:02:05.189> a<00:02:05.219> time

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
this again now it says five at a time

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.570 
this again now it says five at a time
so<00:02:05.969> age<00:02:06.180> is<00:02:06.570> the<00:02:07.110> first<00:02:07.350> key<00:02:07.590> component<00:02:08.039> but

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
so age is the first key component but

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.639 
so age is the first key component but
just<00:02:08.940> because<00:02:09.090> you<00:02:09.330> age<00:02:09.509> the<00:02:09.539> horse<00:02:09.929> to<00:02:10.440> tan

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
just because you age the horse to tan

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.860 
just because you age the horse to tan
does<00:02:10.979> not<00:02:11.129> automatically<00:02:11.640> give<00:02:11.879> you<00:02:11.910> 100<00:02:12.690> plop

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
does not automatically give you 100 plop

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.730 
does not automatically give you 100 plop
it<00:02:13.050> just<00:02:13.319> ink

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
it just ink

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.550 
it just ink
volume<00:02:14.610> so<00:02:15.000> you<00:02:15.150> can<00:02:15.270> see<00:02:15.450> it<00:02:15.630> went<00:02:15.810> to<00:02:15.930> -12

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
volume so you can see it went to -12

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.140 
volume so you can see it went to -12
there<00:02:16.830> from<00:02:17.220> -15<00:02:18.620> so<00:02:19.620> I<00:02:19.650> could<00:02:20.010> just<00:02:20.610> actually

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
there from -15 so I could just actually

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.840 
there from -15 so I could just actually
just<00:02:21.330> show<00:02:21.600> you<00:02:21.660> what<00:02:22.500> I<00:02:22.530> mean<00:02:22.800> so<00:02:23.100> I'll<00:02:23.520> put<00:02:23.760> my

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
just show you what I mean so I'll put my

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.470 
just show you what I mean so I'll put my
horse<00:02:24.030> on<00:02:24.180> EC<00:02:24.960> here<00:02:25.230> and<00:02:25.860> I<00:02:25.950> would<00:02:26.100> literally

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
horse on EC here and I would literally

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.150 
horse on EC here and I would literally
not<00:02:27.480> do<00:02:27.630> any<00:02:27.900> training<00:02:28.290> or<00:02:28.590> anything<00:02:28.950> I

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
not do any training or anything I

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.340 
not do any training or anything I
thought<00:02:29.310> I<00:02:29.340> will<00:02:29.490> just<00:02:29.730> be<00:02:29.850> JIT<00:02:30.090> so<00:02:31.050> late<00:02:31.260> it

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
thought I will just be JIT so late it

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.000 
thought I will just be JIT so late it
again<00:02:31.850> and<00:02:32.850> it's<00:02:33.390> reduced<00:02:33.750> again<00:02:34.020> develop

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
again and it's reduced again develop

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.440 
again and it's reduced again develop
going<00:02:35.370> to<00:02:35.550> zero<00:02:35.790> or<00:02:36.180> aged<00:02:36.510> it<00:02:36.660> again<00:02:38.300> and<00:02:39.300> it's

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
going to zero or aged it again and it's

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.150 
going to zero or aged it again and it's
gone<00:02:39.600> till<00:02:39.780> at<00:02:39.930> one<00:02:40.050> point<00:02:40.200> for<00:02:40.470> one<00:02:40.680> so<00:02:41.100> you

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
gone till at one point for one so you

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.220 
gone till at one point for one so you
can<00:02:41.370> see<00:02:41.550> that<00:02:41.730> actually<00:02:41.820> is<00:02:42.240> it<00:02:42.360> along<00:02:42.660> the

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
can see that actually is it along the

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.290 
can see that actually is it along the
bloat<00:02:43.440> file<00:02:43.650> you<00:02:43.830> will<00:02:44.100> start<00:02:44.820> to<00:02:44.880> get<00:02:45.030> closer

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
bloat file you will start to get closer

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.260 
bloat file you will start to get closer
to<00:02:45.480> plus<00:02:46.110> a<00:02:46.140> hundred<00:02:46.320> okay<00:02:46.970> so<00:02:47.970> that's<00:02:48.150> the

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
to plus a hundred okay so that's the

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.140 
to plus a hundred okay so that's the
first<00:02:48.480> part<00:02:48.630> now<00:02:48.950> the<00:02:49.950> second<00:02:50.430> part<00:02:50.580> is<00:02:50.760> it<00:02:50.970> of

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
first part now the second part is it of

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.020 
first part now the second part is it of
it<00:02:51.540> is<00:02:51.800> add<00:02:52.800> the<00:02:53.010> tardy<00:02:53.280> competition<00:02:53.820> so<00:02:54.000> a

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
it is add the tardy competition so a

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.970 
it is add the tardy competition so a
horse<00:02:54.390> must<00:02:54.660> win<00:02:54.810> twenty<00:02:55.140> competitions<00:02:55.770> night

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
horse must win twenty competitions night

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.050 
horse must win twenty competitions night
when<00:02:56.250> I<00:02:56.280> say<00:02:56.490> that<00:02:56.730> will<00:02:56.910> go<00:02:57.000> to

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
when I say that will go to

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.910 
when I say that will go to
characteristics<00:02:57.840> and<00:02:58.170> will<00:02:58.380> go<00:02:58.470> down<00:02:58.500> to<00:02:58.740> here

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
characteristics and will go down to here

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.130 
characteristics and will go down to here
no<00:02:59.610> this<00:02:59.940> is<00:03:00.090> rosette<00:03:00.420> so<00:03:00.630> we'll<00:03:00.780> ignore<00:03:00.870> that

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
no this is rosette so we'll ignore that

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.840 
no this is rosette so we'll ignore that
for<00:03:01.290> now<00:03:01.440> this<00:03:02.220> is<00:03:02.340> what<00:03:02.490> you're<00:03:02.610> concerned

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
for now this is what you're concerned

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.540 
for now this is what you're concerned
with<00:03:03.030> this<00:03:03.210> gold<00:03:03.450> cup<00:03:03.720> here<00:03:03.990> gold<00:03:04.950> cup<00:03:05.160> is<00:03:05.340> for

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
with this gold cup here gold cup is for

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.730 
with this gold cup here gold cup is for
first<00:03:05.730> place<00:03:06.140> Silver's<00:03:07.140> for<00:03:07.320> second<00:03:07.650> and

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:07.740 
first place Silver's for second and

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:08.660 
first place Silver's for second and
bronze<00:03:07.950> is<00:03:08.130> for<00:03:08.310> third

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
bronze is for third

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.530 
bronze is for third
so<00:03:08.910> this<00:03:09.780> horse<00:03:10.020> hasn't<00:03:10.230> got<00:03:10.440> any<00:03:10.680> wins<00:03:11.100> or<00:03:11.910> you

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
so this horse hasn't got any wins or you

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.080 
so this horse hasn't got any wins or you
know<00:03:12.660> in<00:03:12.810> first<00:03:13.020> place<00:03:13.200> and<00:03:13.530> I<00:03:13.940> that<00:03:14.940> means

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
know in first place and I that means

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:16.760 
know in first place and I that means
that<00:03:15.540> it's<00:03:15.930> not<00:03:15.990> gonna<00:03:16.230> have<00:03:16.350> anything<00:03:16.530> here

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770 
that it's not gonna have anything here

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:18.140 
that it's not gonna have anything here
so<00:03:16.800> they'll<00:03:17.010> go<00:03:17.100> back<00:03:17.250> to<00:03:17.280> genetics<00:03:17.820> and<00:03:17.880> hover

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
so they'll go back to genetics and hover

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.060 
so they'll go back to genetics and hover
over<00:03:18.360> you<00:03:18.420> can<00:03:18.540> see<00:03:18.690> no<00:03:19.020> zero<00:03:19.350> victories<00:03:19.920> out

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
over you can see no zero victories out

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:24.020 
over you can see no zero victories out
of<00:03:20.160> twenty<00:03:20.520> so<00:03:20.790> a<00:03:22.190> horse<00:03:23.190> can<00:03:23.430> win<00:03:23.460> in<00:03:23.910> any

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
of twenty so a horse can win in any

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:25.550 
of twenty so a horse can win in any
combination<00:03:24.390> and<00:03:24.900> then<00:03:25.050> any<00:03:25.200> candy

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
combination and then any candy

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:26.990 
combination and then any candy
competition<00:03:26.070> but<00:03:26.250> it<00:03:26.370> has<00:03:26.520> to<00:03:26.700> be<00:03:26.820> a<00:03:26.850> first

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
competition but it has to be a first

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.240 
competition but it has to be a first
place<00:03:27.180> so<00:03:27.600> anything<00:03:28.140> else<00:03:28.260> is<00:03:28.440> not<00:03:28.620> basically

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
place so anything else is not basically

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.280 
place so anything else is not basically
a<00:03:29.370> win<00:03:29.610> so<00:03:29.970> if<00:03:30.180> your<00:03:30.300> horse<00:03:30.480> gets<00:03:30.660> second<00:03:31.050> third

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
a win so if your horse gets second third

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.020 
a win so if your horse gets second third
fourth<00:03:31.560> or<00:03:31.680> fifth<00:03:31.920> that's<00:03:32.580> not<00:03:32.760> gonna<00:03:32.880> have

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
fourth or fifth that's not gonna have

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.770 
fourth or fifth that's not gonna have
any<00:03:33.150> effect<00:03:33.240> on<00:03:33.690> the<00:03:33.960> value<00:03:34.200> of<00:03:34.410> the<00:03:34.500> block<00:03:34.650> and

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
any effect on the value of the block and

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.360 
any effect on the value of the block and
you<00:03:36.780> do<00:03:36.900> not<00:03:37.020> have<00:03:37.230> to<00:03:37.350> get<00:03:37.500> the<00:03:37.800> wins<00:03:37.980> and<00:03:38.250> the

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
you do not have to get the wins and the

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.580 
you do not have to get the wins and the
same<00:03:38.550> kind<00:03:39.060> of<00:03:39.210> competitions<00:03:39.900> or<00:03:40.260> even<00:03:40.530> the

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
same kind of competitions or even the

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.530 
same kind of competitions or even the
same<00:03:40.770> discipline<00:03:41.220> so<00:03:41.370> you<00:03:41.460> can<00:03:41.580> get<00:03:41.730> wins<00:03:42.210> and

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
same discipline so you can get wins and

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.020 
same discipline so you can get wins and
Western<00:03:43.410> you<00:03:43.560> get<00:03:43.710> wins<00:03:43.890> and<00:03:44.250> classical<00:03:44.790> and

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
Western you get wins and classical and

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.500 
Western you get wins and classical and
in<00:03:45.780> all<00:03:45.990> different<00:03:46.200> types<00:03:46.610> so<00:03:47.610> you<00:03:48.090> could<00:03:48.300> get

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
in all different types so you could get

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.240 
in all different types so you could get
you<00:03:48.810> know<00:03:48.930> for<00:03:49.110> example<00:03:49.170> ten<00:03:49.650> wins<00:03:49.890> and<00:03:50.100> cross

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
you know for example ten wins and cross

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.730 
you know for example ten wins and cross
country<00:03:50.490> on<00:03:50.910> pan<00:03:51.300> and<00:03:51.690> barrel<00:03:52.050> for<00:03:52.320> example

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:52.740 
country on pan and barrel for example

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.900 
country on pan and barrel for example
and<00:03:53.070> that<00:03:53.270> would<00:03:54.270> cut<00:03:54.480> towards<00:03:54.810> the<00:03:54.900> track<00:03:55.080> day

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 
and that would cut towards the track day

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:00.580 
and that would cut towards the track day
so<00:03:56.910> so<00:03:57.420> long<00:03:57.600> as<00:03:57.780> you<00:03:57.870> have<00:03:58.050> those<00:03:58.260> 20<00:03:58.590> wins

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
so so long as you have those 20 wins

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:02.720 
so so long as you have those 20 wins
that<00:04:01.590> will<00:04:01.830> increase<00:04:02.040> the<00:04:02.160> bought<00:04:02.310> value<00:04:02.580> but

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
that will increase the bought value but

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.120 
that will increase the bought value but
getting<00:04:03.450> more<00:04:03.630> than<00:04:03.780> 20<00:04:04.110> does<00:04:04.710> not<00:04:04.890> increase

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
getting more than 20 does not increase

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.370 
getting more than 20 does not increase
the<00:04:05.310> ball<00:04:05.460> file<00:04:05.640> you<00:04:05.760> just<00:04:06.240> just<00:04:06.690> up<00:04:06.870> to<00:04:07.020> 20

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
the ball file you just just up to 20

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:10.430 
the ball file you just just up to 20
okay<00:04:08.250> so<00:04:08.310> the<00:04:08.520> third<00:04:08.760> part<00:04:09.180> which<00:04:09.810> makes<00:04:10.110> up<00:04:10.350> a

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
okay so the third part which makes up a

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.380 
okay so the third part which makes up a
hundred<00:04:10.530> block<00:04:10.890> is<00:04:11.100> called<00:04:11.790> building<00:04:12.240> the

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
hundred block is called building the

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:13.640 
hundred block is called building the
three<00:04:12.600> skills<00:04:12.930> okay

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
three skills okay

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.370 
three skills okay
like<00:04:14.000> this<00:04:15.000> control<00:04:15.480> this<00:04:15.750> can<00:04:16.049> throw<00:04:16.350> people

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
like this control this can throw people

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.050 
like this control this can throw people
office<00:04:16.859> because<00:04:17.040> sometimes<00:04:17.370> people<00:04:17.730> call<00:04:17.940> it

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
office because sometimes people call it

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.270 
office because sometimes people call it
the<00:04:18.120> top<00:04:18.299> three<00:04:18.540> skills<00:04:18.750> sometimes<00:04:19.320> you<00:04:20.160> know

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
the top three skills sometimes you know

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.370 
the top three skills sometimes you know
and<00:04:21.030> it<00:04:21.270> confuses<00:04:21.630> people<00:04:21.780> because<00:04:21.930> people

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
and it confuses people because people

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.710 
and it confuses people because people
start<00:04:22.620> to<00:04:22.710> look<00:04:22.860> at<00:04:23.130> these<00:04:23.550> ignore<00:04:24.120> this<00:04:24.419> bit

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 
start to look at these ignore this bit

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.040 
start to look at these ignore this bit
okay<00:04:25.110> you<00:04:25.650> want<00:04:25.800> to<00:04:25.860> click<00:04:26.070> on<00:04:26.100> genetics

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050 
okay you want to click on genetics

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:28.689 
okay you want to click on genetics
you<00:04:27.139> want<00:04:27.289> to<00:04:27.379> go<00:04:27.500> down<00:04:27.680> here<00:04:27.710> to<00:04:28.129> genetic

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:28.699 
you want to go down here to genetic

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:32.409 
you want to go down here to genetic
potential<00:04:29.620> so<00:04:30.620> whatever<00:04:30.919> every<00:04:31.819> single<00:04:32.210> horse

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:32.419 
potential so whatever every single horse

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:34.839 
potential so whatever every single horse
in<00:04:32.599> the<00:04:32.659> game<00:04:32.840> has<00:04:33.409> sex<00:04:34.220> skills

00:04:34.839 --> 00:04:34.849 
in the game has sex skills

00:04:34.849 --> 00:04:37.480 
in the game has sex skills
stamina<00:04:35.180> gallop<00:04:35.870> speed<00:04:36.259> drop<00:04:36.770> dresses<00:04:37.340> and

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 
stamina gallop speed drop dresses and

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.749 
stamina gallop speed drop dresses and
jumping<00:04:37.759> okay<00:04:38.349> but<00:04:39.349> within<00:04:39.680> those<00:04:40.129> sex<00:04:40.490> skills

00:04:40.749 --> 00:04:40.759 
jumping okay but within those sex skills

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:42.520 
jumping okay but within those sex skills
there<00:04:41.060> are<00:04:41.090> three<00:04:41.509> that<00:04:41.750> they're<00:04:41.930> better<00:04:42.199> at

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:42.530 
there are three that they're better at

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:44.830 
there are three that they're better at
okay<00:04:42.979> so<00:04:43.310> those<00:04:43.580> have<00:04:43.819> two<00:04:43.970> higher<00:04:44.180> value<00:04:44.659> so

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:44.840 
okay so those have two higher value so

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.420 
okay so those have two higher value so
if<00:04:44.900> we<00:04:45.020> look<00:04:45.169> at<00:04:45.289> this<00:04:45.409> horse<00:04:45.680> here<00:04:45.889> we<00:04:46.039> can<00:04:46.220> see

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
if we look at this horse here we can see

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:49.420 
if we look at this horse here we can see
that<00:04:46.610> stamina<00:04:47.240> is<00:04:47.470> 271<00:04:48.470> that's<00:04:48.949> the<00:04:49.099> highest

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.430 
that stamina is 271 that's the highest

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.119 
that stamina is 271 that's the highest
value<00:04:49.759> out<00:04:49.909> of<00:04:50.030> all<00:04:50.180> these<00:04:50.419> sex<00:04:51.050> values<00:04:51.409> so<00:04:52.039> we

00:04:52.119 --> 00:04:52.129 
value out of all these sex values so we

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:53.830 
value out of all these sex values so we
know<00:04:52.250> that<00:04:52.280> that's<00:04:52.669> one<00:04:53.030> of<00:04:53.060> its<00:04:53.240> top<00:04:53.509> skills

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:53.840 
know that that's one of its top skills

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.080 
know that that's one of its top skills
then<00:04:54.680> we<00:04:54.860> look<00:04:55.009> again<00:04:55.280> and<00:04:55.490> we<00:04:55.610> see<00:04:55.819> that

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.090 
then we look again and we see that

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:58.960 
then we look again and we see that
dressage<00:04:56.629> is<00:04:56.840> the<00:04:56.930> next<00:04:57.229> highest<00:04:57.379> of<00:04:57.710> 213<00:04:58.550> so

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:58.970 
dressage is the next highest of 213 so

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:00.309 
dressage is the next highest of 213 so
with<00:04:59.120> our<00:04:59.240> we<00:04:59.360> thought<00:04:59.539> we've<00:04:59.750> identified<00:04:59.960> two

00:05:00.309 --> 00:05:00.319 
with our we thought we've identified two

00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:02.589 
with our we thought we've identified two
out<00:05:00.560> of<00:05:00.590> 33<00:05:00.889> top<00:05:01.219> skills<00:05:01.490> and<00:05:02.120> we<00:05:02.210> look<00:05:02.360> again

00:05:02.589 --> 00:05:02.599 
out of 33 top skills and we look again

00:05:02.599 --> 00:05:04.300 
out of 33 top skills and we look again
and<00:05:02.870> we<00:05:02.960> see<00:05:03.110> jumping<00:05:03.530> so<00:05:03.770> jumping<00:05:04.099> is<00:05:04.219> the

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:04.310 
and we see jumping so jumping is the

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:07.930 
and we see jumping so jumping is the
third<00:05:04.610> best<00:05:05.150> out<00:05:05.690> of<00:05:05.750> the<00:05:05.900> three<00:05:05.930> top<00:05:06.940> genetic

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:07.940 
third best out of the three top genetic

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:10.899 
third best out of the three top genetic
skills<00:05:08.240> so<00:05:09.199> we<00:05:09.379> can<00:05:09.560> us<00:05:09.710> then<00:05:10.129> know<00:05:10.580> that

00:05:10.899 --> 00:05:10.909 
skills so we can us then know that

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:12.730 
skills so we can us then know that
jumping<00:05:11.360> dressage<00:05:11.629> is<00:05:11.870> stamina<00:05:12.409> on<00:05:12.530> this

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:12.740 
jumping dressage is stamina on this

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:14.860 
jumping dressage is stamina on this
particular<00:05:13.250> horse<00:05:13.460> are<00:05:13.699> the<00:05:14.090> three<00:05:14.360> best

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:14.870 
particular horse are the three best

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:19.450 
particular horse are the three best
genetic<00:05:15.860> skills<00:05:16.400> and<00:05:17.000> then<00:05:18.190> the<00:05:19.190> one<00:05:19.340> other

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:19.460 
genetic skills and then the one other

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:20.920 
genetic skills and then the one other
bit<00:05:19.669> of<00:05:19.699> information<00:05:19.849> this<00:05:20.360> tells<00:05:20.599> us<00:05:20.750> is

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:20.930 
bit of information this tells us is

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:24.159 
bit of information this tells us is
gallop<00:05:21.889> trot<00:05:22.400> and<00:05:22.940> speed<00:05:23.240> on<00:05:23.479> this<00:05:23.659> particular

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:24.169 
gallop trot and speed on this particular

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:27.520 
gallop trot and speed on this particular
horse<00:05:24.639> will<00:05:25.639> never<00:05:25.909> help<00:05:26.330> to<00:05:26.599> increase<00:05:26.719> the

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:27.530 
horse will never help to increase the
