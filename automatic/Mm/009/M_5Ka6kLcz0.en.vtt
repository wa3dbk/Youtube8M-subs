just because I had a motorcycle when I

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.320 
just because I had a motorcycle when I
was<00:00:32.870> younger<00:00:33.110> and<00:00:33.379> I<00:00:33.860> ended<00:00:34.580> up<00:00:34.640> crashing<00:00:35.180> it

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:35.330

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:39.220 
was younger and I ended up crashing it
and<00:00:35.540> I<00:00:36.140> needed<00:00:36.710> to<00:00:36.800> get<00:00:36.860> it<00:00:37.040> repainted<00:00:37.480> I<00:00:38.480> had

be the Bay Bridge on here and he wanted
to<00:01:29.299> be<00:01:29.420> aggressive<00:01:29.990> so<00:01:30.439> any<00:01:30.649> wanted<00:01:30.890> also<00:01:31.039> in

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
to be aggressive so any wanted also in

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.039 
to be aggressive so any wanted also in
Lyons<00:01:31.579> color<00:01:31.789> so<00:01:32.030> we<00:01:32.149> thought<00:01:32.329> maybe<00:01:32.750> some

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:33.049 
Lyons color so we thought maybe some

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:36.010 
Lyons color so we thought maybe some
fire<00:01:33.289> on<00:01:33.320> here<00:01:33.890> and<00:01:34.820> maybe<00:01:35.390> even<00:01:35.600> kind<00:01:35.810> of<00:01:35.960> a

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
fire on here and maybe even kind of a

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.160 
fire on here and maybe even kind of a
fade<00:01:36.289> from<00:01:36.530> from<00:01:36.890> light<00:01:37.159> to<00:01:37.729> dark<00:01:37.939> oh<00:01:38.119> he<00:01:39.020> said

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
fade from from light to dark oh he said

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.169 
fade from from light to dark oh he said
aggressive<00:01:39.649> so<00:01:39.829> I<00:01:39.859> thought<00:01:40.130> maybe<00:01:40.460> some<00:01:40.729> lions

00:01:41.169 --> 00:01:41.179 
aggressive so I thought maybe some lions

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:43.660 
aggressive so I thought maybe some lions
eyes<00:01:41.329> on<00:01:41.600> there<00:01:41.920> would<00:01:42.920> look<00:01:43.130> pretty<00:01:43.310> good<00:01:43.399> and

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
eyes on there would look pretty good and

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.190 
eyes on there would look pretty good and
then<00:01:43.759> we<00:01:43.850> also<00:01:43.969> have<00:01:44.060> Dante<00:01:44.509> Marsh<00:01:44.689> actually

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
then we also have Dante Marsh actually

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.069 
then we also have Dante Marsh actually
on<00:01:45.320> the<00:01:45.409> other<00:01:45.560> side<00:01:45.829> running<00:01:46.630> and<00:01:47.630> so<00:01:47.899> we're

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:48.079 
on the other side running and so we're

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:49.359 
on the other side running and so we're
basically<00:01:48.229> going<00:01:48.590> to<00:01:48.710> kind<00:01:48.859> of<00:01:48.950> fill<00:01:49.130> the<00:01:49.249> rest

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
basically going to kind of fill the rest

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:51.399 
basically going to kind of fill the rest
of<00:01:49.490> the<00:01:49.549> helmet<00:01:49.880> get<00:01:50.090> that<00:01:50.299> all<00:01:51.109> brought

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:51.409 
of the helmet get that all brought

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:52.809 
of the helmet get that all brought
together<00:01:51.560> so<00:01:51.859> it's<00:01:51.979> kind<00:01:52.130> of<00:01:52.159> more<00:01:52.429> of<00:01:52.490> a<00:01:52.640> one

00:01:52.809 --> 00:01:52.819 
together so it's kind of more of a one

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:56.080 
together so it's kind of more of a one
cohesive<00:01:53.149> design<00:01:54.249> the<00:01:55.249> same<00:01:55.460> with<00:01:55.640> we've<00:01:55.939> got

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
cohesive design the same with we've got

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.109 
cohesive design the same with we've got
Geroy<00:01:56.450> Simon<00:01:56.509> helmet<00:01:57.319> he's<00:01:58.039> he's<00:01:58.460> really<00:01:58.939> into

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
Geroy Simon helmet he's he's really into

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:01.539 
Geroy Simon helmet he's he's really into
blues<00:01:59.359> music<00:01:59.770> so<00:02:00.770> what<00:02:00.920> we've<00:02:01.069> done<00:02:01.100> with<00:02:01.369> that

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:01.549 
blues music so what we've done with that

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:03.989 
blues music so what we've done with that
one<00:02:01.759> is<00:02:01.909> basically<00:02:02.390> have<00:02:02.539> Geroy<00:02:02.990> on<00:02:03.229> the<00:02:03.350> side

00:02:03.989 --> 00:02:03.999 
one is basically have Geroy on the side

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:06.849 
one is basically have Geroy on the side
running<00:02:04.999> and<00:02:05.299> it<00:02:06.079> kind<00:02:06.319> of<00:02:06.350> turns<00:02:06.560> him<00:02:06.740> to

00:02:06.849 --> 00:02:06.859 
running and it kind of turns him to

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:08.440 
running and it kind of turns him to
smoke<00:02:07.130> off<00:02:07.340> him<00:02:07.609> and<00:02:07.789> have<00:02:07.939> some<00:02:08.210> jazz
