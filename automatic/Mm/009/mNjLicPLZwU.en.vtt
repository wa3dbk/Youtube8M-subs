matter of fact they don't really want to
then<00:00:22.730> what<00:00:23.730> you<00:00:23.820> want<00:00:24.000> to<00:00:24.029> do<00:00:24.180> is<00:00:24.300> you<00:00:24.419> want<00:00:24.599> to

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:24.800 
then what you want to do is you want to

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.450 
then what you want to do is you want to
pull<00:00:25.800> this<00:00:25.980> thing<00:00:26.250> straight<00:00:27.140> forward<00:00:28.140> and

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:28.460 
pull this thing straight forward and

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.510 
pull this thing straight forward and
then<00:00:29.460> up<00:00:29.640> that's<00:00:30.149> just<00:00:30.239> how<00:00:30.450> the<00:00:30.509> catches<00:00:31.050> are

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:31.520 
then up that's just how the catches are

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.470 
then up that's just how the catches are
look<00:00:32.520> forward<00:00:33.120> Oh<00:00:33.920> screw<00:00:34.920> on<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.160> floor<00:00:35.480> okay

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
look forward Oh screw on the floor okay

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.209 
look forward Oh screw on the floor okay
because<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.410> catches<00:00:38.390> look<00:00:39.390> like<00:00:39.570> that<00:00:40.219> in

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
because the catches look like that in

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:49.160 
because the catches look like that in
those<00:00:41.399> slots<00:00:43.730> so<00:00:44.730> you<00:00:45.120> can<00:00:45.539> see<00:00:47.719> that<00:00:48.719> you<00:00:49.019> need

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
those slots so you can see that you need

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.910 
those slots so you can see that you need
to<00:00:49.350> pull<00:00:49.559> it<00:00:49.710> back<00:00:50.670> and<00:00:51.059> then<00:00:51.120> up<00:00:51.420> okay<00:00:52.050> or<00:00:52.890> else

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
to pull it back and then up okay or else

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.889 
to pull it back and then up okay or else
you'll<00:00:53.219> break<00:00:53.460> a<00:00:53.519> piece<00:00:53.820> off<00:00:53.969> like<00:00:54.329> I<00:00:54.480> did

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
you'll break a piece off like I did

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.970 
you'll break a piece off like I did
that's<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.129> e<00:00:56.160> used<00:00:56.789> to<00:00:56.910> be<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.739> amount<00:00:58.739> or

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
that's the e used to be a amount or

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.049 
that's the e used to be a amount or
whatever<00:00:59.249> okay

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
whatever okay

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.569 
whatever okay
that's<00:01:00.300> off<00:01:00.480> when<00:01:00.870> I<00:01:00.929> just<00:01:01.140> forgot<00:01:01.410> to<00:01:01.579> plug

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
that's off when I just forgot to plug

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.350 
that's off when I just forgot to plug
that<00:01:02.760> back<00:01:02.820> in<00:01:03.239> so<00:01:03.929> I'll<00:01:04.140> do<00:01:04.320> that<00:01:04.379> and<00:01:05.360> okay

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
that back in so I'll do that and okay

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.800 
that back in so I'll do that and okay
I'm<00:01:07.310> replacing<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.670> throttle<00:01:09.060> control<00:01:09.420> on<00:01:09.630> my

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
I'm replacing the throttle control on my

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.810 
I'm replacing the throttle control on my
Geo<00:01:10.520> something<00:01:11.520> busted<00:01:11.910> on<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.120> old<00:01:12.270> one<00:01:12.480> and

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
Geo something busted on the old one and

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.350 
Geo something busted on the old one and
just<00:01:14.820> things<00:01:15.650> didn't<00:01:16.650> look<00:01:17.240> didn't<00:01:18.240> look

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
just things didn't look didn't look

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.360 
just things didn't look didn't look
right<00:01:18.630> in<00:01:18.870> there<00:01:19.080> so<00:01:19.440> I<00:01:19.470> talked<00:01:19.860> to<00:01:20.010> Jill<00:01:20.250> and

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:20.370 
right in there so I talked to Jill and

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:22.790 
right in there so I talked to Jill and
they<00:01:20.490> sent<00:01:20.730> me<00:01:20.760> a<00:01:20.880> new<00:01:21.000> part<00:01:21.270> with<00:01:21.420> three<00:01:21.800> so

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:22.800 
they sent me a new part with three so

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.610 
they sent me a new part with three so
basically<00:01:23.220> I<00:01:23.370> took<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.330> top<00:01:24.570> off<00:01:24.780> a<00:01:25.170> couple<00:01:25.410> of

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:25.620 
basically I took the top off a couple of

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:30.590 
basically I took the top off a couple of
screws<00:01:25.920> popped<00:01:26.310> it<00:01:26.460> off<00:01:26.580> and<00:01:29.300> slid<00:01:30.300> the<00:01:30.480> old

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
screws popped it off and slid the old

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.550 
screws popped it off and slid the old
one<00:01:30.840> off<00:01:31.020> jump<00:01:32.300> slid<00:01:33.300> the<00:01:33.450> old<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:34.020> new<00:01:34.050> one<00:01:34.410> on

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
one off jump slid the old the new one on

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.400 
one off jump slid the old the new one on
and<00:01:35.150> then<00:01:36.150> from<00:01:36.420> there<00:01:36.630> there<00:01:36.900> are<00:01:37.050> three

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:37.410 
and then from there there are three

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:40.760 
and then from there there are three
cables<00:01:38.600> and<00:01:39.600> all<00:01:39.810> you<00:01:40.020> do<00:01:40.200> is<00:01:40.410> just<00:01:40.590> basically

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
cables and all you do is just basically

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.540 
cables and all you do is just basically
follow<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:42.290> one<00:01:43.290> to<00:01:43.590> see<00:01:43.830> where<00:01:44.040> it<00:01:44.160> connects

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:44.550 
follow the one to see where it connects

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:49.640 
follow the one to see where it connects
for<00:01:45.150> example<00:01:45.650> this<00:01:46.650> one<00:01:48.200> ends<00:01:49.200> up<00:01:49.260> connecting

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:49.650 
for example this one ends up connecting

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:54.100 
for example this one ends up connecting
down<00:01:50.310> here<00:01:50.930> so<00:01:51.930> I<00:01:51.960> just<00:01:52.350> took<00:01:52.740> off<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:52.980> old<00:01:53.400> one

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
down here so I just took off the old one

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.820 
down here so I just took off the old one
slapped<00:01:55.110> on<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.530> new<00:01:55.710> one<00:01:56.000> and<00:01:57.000> you<00:01:57.680> do<00:01:58.680> that

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:58.830 
slapped on the new one and you do that

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.850 
slapped on the new one and you do that
three<00:01:59.100> times<00:01:59.130> so<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.210> second<00:02:00.600> one<00:02:00.720> is<00:02:01.290> up<00:02:01.500> here

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
three times so the second one is up here

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.730 
three times so the second one is up here
I<00:02:02.010> found<00:02:02.400> it<00:02:02.610> just<00:02:02.640> now<00:02:02.970> this<00:02:03.900> is<00:02:04.080> the<00:02:04.230> old<00:02:04.380> one

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
I found it just now this is the old one

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.910 
I found it just now this is the old one
that's<00:02:04.890> plugged<00:02:05.280> into<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:06.210> white

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
that's plugged into the white

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.510 
that's plugged into the white
I<00:02:07.950> want<00:02:08.340> to<00:02:08.399> just<00:02:08.550> disconnect<00:02:08.910> that<00:02:09.740> and<00:02:10.740> pop

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
I want to just disconnect that and pop

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.580 
I want to just disconnect that and pop
on<00:02:11.790> the<00:02:11.970> new<00:02:12.120> one<00:02:12.740> and<00:02:13.740> then<00:02:14.730> the<00:02:14.880> third<00:02:15.120> one<00:02:15.390> is

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
on the new one and then the third one is

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.830 
on the new one and then the third one is
might<00:02:16.590> be<00:02:16.709> a<00:02:16.740> bit<00:02:16.950> trickier<00:02:17.400> it's<00:02:18.270> somewhere

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
might be a bit trickier it's somewhere

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.449 
might be a bit trickier it's somewhere
inside<00:02:19.110> that<00:02:19.170> plastic<00:02:19.800> bag<00:02:20.040> and<00:02:20.340> it's

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
inside that plastic bag and it's

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:22.850 
inside that plastic bag and it's
actually<00:02:20.880> got<00:02:21.810> a<00:02:21.840> couple<00:02:22.200> of<00:02:22.290> leads<00:02:22.500> that<00:02:22.800> I'm

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
actually got a couple of leads that I'm

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.199 
actually got a couple of leads that I'm
going<00:02:22.980> to<00:02:23.040> have<00:02:23.130> to<00:02:23.220> somehow<00:02:23.400> get<00:02:23.819> out<00:02:23.850> and

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
going to have to somehow get out and

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.360 
going to have to somehow get out and
then<00:02:24.330> put<00:02:24.510> back<00:02:24.660> in<00:02:24.930> but<00:02:25.140> we'll<00:02:25.260> see<00:02:25.440> but<00:02:26.250> other

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
then put back in but we'll see but other

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.720 
then put back in but we'll see but other
than<00:02:26.430> that<00:02:27.380> it's<00:02:28.380> just<00:02:28.470> basically<00:02:28.980> fine<00:02:29.250> where

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
than that it's just basically fine where

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.810 
than that it's just basically fine where
the<00:02:29.820> old<00:02:29.970> cable<00:02:30.300> goes<00:02:31.430> replace<00:02:32.430> it<00:02:32.580> with<00:02:32.700> the

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
the old cable goes replace it with the

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.750 
the old cable goes replace it with the
new<00:02:32.850> cable<00:02:33.650> should<00:02:34.650> be<00:02:34.800> basically<00:02:35.310> plug<00:02:35.550> and

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
new cable should be basically plug and

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.400 
new cable should be basically plug and
play<00:02:35.910> I<00:02:36.120> can't<00:02:36.360> wait<00:02:36.480> to<00:02:36.600> see<00:02:36.750> if<00:02:36.810> this<00:02:36.959> works

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
play I can't wait to see if this works

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.030 
play I can't wait to see if this works
as<00:02:37.680> easily<00:02:37.860> as<00:02:38.130> I<00:02:38.280> hope<00:02:38.459> so<00:02:38.930> so<00:02:39.930> once<00:02:40.680> all<00:02:40.860> the

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
as easily as I hope so so once all the

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.880 
as easily as I hope so so once all the
cables<00:02:41.400> are<00:02:41.520> replaced<00:02:41.910> I'll<00:02:42.660> pop<00:02:43.500> out<00:02:43.680> the<00:02:43.860> old

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
cables are replaced I'll pop out the old

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.620 
cables are replaced I'll pop out the old
wires<00:02:44.220> cut<00:02:44.640> them<00:02:44.790> or<00:02:44.910> whatever<00:02:45.060> I<00:02:45.209> have<00:02:45.330> to<00:02:45.480> do

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
wires cut them or whatever I have to do

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.930 
wires cut them or whatever I have to do
throw<00:02:46.230> this<00:02:46.440> piece<00:02:46.680> in<00:02:46.920> the<00:02:46.950> garbage<00:02:47.370> maybe

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
throw this piece in the garbage maybe

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.520 
throw this piece in the garbage maybe
keep<00:02:48.239> it<00:02:48.360> just<00:02:48.480> in<00:02:48.660> case<00:02:48.690> the<00:02:49.560> parts<00:02:49.860> and<00:02:51.530> do

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
keep it just in case the parts and do

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:58.130 
keep it just in case the parts and do
some<00:02:53.239> re-strategize<00:02:55.130> and<00:02:56.690> this<00:02:57.690> is<00:02:57.870> really

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
some re-strategize and this is really

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.470 
some re-strategize and this is really
easy<00:02:58.350> I<00:02:58.530> think<00:02:58.950> we'll<00:02:59.640> check<00:03:00.030> back<00:03:00.239> in<00:03:00.420> a

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
easy I think we'll check back in a

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.020 
easy I think we'll check back in a
moment

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
moment

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.180 
moment
