00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:03.220
 that must fit now 

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:07.140
 the approach taken in a different way to mecca farmers that place for year two 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.259
 years ago 2009 but yes for discussion 

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:15.339
 quite shortly thereafter already in January they have been with us the week on internship we see the 

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:18.759
 first week based after a week with us but then you just join in 

00:00:18.759 --> 00:00:20.949
 your own to the group was the promise team 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:24.249
 adelinde can be a bit to the south and the way he is 

00:00:24.249 --> 00:00:29.550
 playing football must know his character he is a typical center point where you 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.980
 actually not so crazy anymore 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.260
 and by that I mean that he is up for gambling and the opponents are bad 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.490
 makes this difficult what is more a name ie boy who with a huge 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:43.160
 zest for work on the field is very present in the rush hour was second 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:48.050
 9 makes the stora very difficult in the sense of good speed 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.160
 bouncing heads he can both play with the back to the goal in a different way 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.480
 next to goal for the team 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.970
 he can also play a role with that face so he also has the the 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.690
 urge towards the ball can make a goal people really like my appreciation 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.900
 if there are players who work for the team 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.130
 after being even the most normal thing in the world but we some players that 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.720
 there is just a little bit thicker on top of that so the customer has that next to it 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.340
 The fact that he can play fantastic football and make forest also a huge zest for work 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.110
 after that the guys certainly showed up and that gets really bad here 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.450
 valued in itself has the basic quality to grow from 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.900
 to a very good Premier League football other side just a very good one 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.210
 popular player 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.570
 homes and that is also going to be trust that it will be ok etex will be two years old 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.240
 The facts become Corjan in the service of FC Groningen 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.000
 how is it that fc groningen is so popular with players from the south 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.280
 american country groningen is a concept here you can't imagine that 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.470
 that moment that we ask from clubs from 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.180
 the funeral at then it is invariably an educational that season is fc groningen 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.720
 he sends well-known pastors as missionary bruno silva is mathias 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:51.760
 of course 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:55.230
 to what extent has played a role and I hear it is just a very popular one 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:56.520
 will come 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.880
 one of them because it doesn't only speak Spanish and we don't 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.360
 two teams again as interpreters 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:03.249
 four times 

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:06.409
 Of course it is well known also in Europe that the Groningen has too 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:10.269
 mean in his career of sources and of riessen even after li is natural 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:12.189
 is an is very popular 

00:02:12.189 --> 00:02:16.329
 and human rights and well-being there now flared up again 

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:21.489
 and an old people know that some ruin turned white quickly 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:24.629
 FC Groningen does exist Groningen is actually 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:29.540
 immensely popular in the neighborhoods more than actually the top clubs and so is that 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.610
 to come to a decision of a player who is making a step ahead of us 

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:35.140
 the yes movie
