00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:57.270
 boys but as already mentioned in the 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:00.500
 initial presentation to carry out 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:03.090
 this recipe is really a game from 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:07.710
 boys then the main ingredient is 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:12.120

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:14.940
 we will use 250 g of chickpeas 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:19.080
 yesterday the hosts are soaked so not 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:22.460
 leave about 10 hours in the water and today I 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:26.070
 parboiled about half an hour 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:28.080

 cubes a cup of tomato sauce 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.630
 in this case my case is the 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.190
 fresh tomato but it's okay let's say 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.770
