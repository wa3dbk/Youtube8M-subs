00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:55.960 
case on the sides you'll see a little

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.130 
case on the sides you'll see a little
rubber<00:00:56.469> bumper<00:00:57.280> on<00:00:58.180> this<00:00:58.390> side<00:00:58.570> rubber<00:00:58.870> bumper

00:00:59.130 --> 00:00:59.140 
rubber bumper on this side rubber bumper

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.590 
rubber bumper on this side rubber bumper
as<00:00:59.260> well<00:00:59.410> on<00:00:59.680> the<00:01:00.610> bottom<00:01:00.820> you'll<00:01:01.239> see<00:01:01.329> this

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:01.600 
as well on the bottom you'll see this

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.840 
as well on the bottom you'll see this
slide<00:01:01.899> out<00:01:02.079> mechanism<00:01:02.739> right<00:01:02.920> really<00:01:03.670> this

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
slide out mechanism right really this

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.420 
slide out mechanism right really this
serves<00:01:04.119> two<00:01:04.360> purposes<00:01:04.390> I<00:01:04.930> believe<00:01:05.439> first

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
serves two purposes I believe first

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.699 
serves two purposes I believe first
officers<00:01:06.909> a<00:01:06.939> span<00:01:07.389> second<00:01:07.899> it<00:01:08.139> protects<00:01:08.560> the

00:01:08.699 --> 00:01:08.709 
officers a span second it protects the

00:01:08.709 --> 00:01:10.800 
officers a span second it protects the
30-pin<00:01:09.069> connector<00:01:09.130> for<00:01:09.880> many<00:01:10.060> scratches<00:01:10.359> or

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:10.810 
30-pin connector for many scratches or

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:12.269 
30-pin connector for many scratches or
anything<00:01:10.840> like<00:01:11.109> that<00:01:11.229> does<00:01:11.889> leaves<00:01:12.130> two

00:01:12.269 --> 00:01:12.279 
anything like that does leaves two

00:01:12.279 --> 00:01:13.980 
anything like that does leaves two
openings<00:01:12.789> for<00:01:12.939> the<00:01:12.969> speaker<00:01:13.450> and<00:01:13.659> microphone

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
openings for the speaker and microphone

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:15.719 
openings for the speaker and microphone
so<00:01:14.619> there's<00:01:14.889> no<00:01:15.069> interruption<00:01:15.639> or

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:15.729 
so there's no interruption or

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:17.669 
so there's no interruption or
interference<00:01:16.179> there<00:01:16.509> and<00:01:17.259> the<00:01:17.350> cool<00:01:17.499> part

00:01:17.669 --> 00:01:17.679 
interference there and the cool part

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:19.289 
interference there and the cool part
about<00:01:17.709> the<00:01:17.920> top<00:01:18.100> is<00:01:18.279> it<00:01:18.520> incorporates<00:01:19.060> a

the<00:01:35.259> case<00:01:35.469> whatsoever<00:01:35.829> i<00:01:36.039> examine<00:01:36.669> was

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:37.149 
the case whatsoever i examine was

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:40.379 
the case whatsoever i examine was
perfect<00:01:37.599> honestly<00:01:38.139> now<00:01:39.009> i<00:01:39.279> took<00:01:39.520> it<00:01:39.639> apart<00:01:40.149> and

00:01:40.379 --> 00:01:40.389 
perfect honestly now i took it apart and

00:01:40.389 --> 00:01:42.899 
perfect honestly now i took it apart and
it's<00:01:40.779> essentially<00:01:41.200> a<00:01:41.259> slider<00:01:41.499> type<00:01:41.740> case<00:01:42.009> so

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:42.909 
it's essentially a slider type case so

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:45.959 
it's essentially a slider type case so
here's<00:01:43.149> my<00:01:43.209> case<00:01:43.509> itself<00:01:44.219> you<00:01:45.219> slide<00:01:45.639> it<00:01:45.819> right

here's my case itself you slide it right

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:51.839 
here's my case itself you slide it right
in<00:01:47.789> take<00:01:48.789> this<00:01:48.969> bottom<00:01:49.299> component<00:01:50.700> slide<00:01:51.700> it

00:01:51.839 --> 00:01:51.849 
in take this bottom component slide it

00:01:51.849 --> 00:01:55.139 
in take this bottom component slide it
and<00:01:51.999> it<00:01:52.539> snaps<00:01:52.959> in<00:01:53.200> place<00:01:53.849> there<00:01:54.849> you<00:01:54.969> go

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
surface other than that I gotta say for

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:09.990 
surface other than that I gotta say for
a<00:03:08.200> sliding<00:03:08.560> tight<00:03:08.740> case<00:03:09.010> it<00:03:09.310> was<00:03:09.459> one<00:03:09.730> of<00:03:09.760> the

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
a sliding tight case it was one of the

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.720 
a sliding tight case it was one of the
thinnest<00:03:10.480> feeling<00:03:11.200> sliding<00:03:11.740> type<00:03:11.950> cases<00:03:12.280> i

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
thinnest feeling sliding type cases i

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.930 
thinnest feeling sliding type cases i
have<00:03:12.970> used<00:03:13.240> for<00:03:13.540> the<00:03:13.600> iphone<00:03:13.930> 4<00:03:14.400> feels<00:03:15.400> much

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
have used for the iphone 4 feels much

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.390 
have used for the iphone 4 feels much
thinner<00:03:16.300> than<00:03:16.690> an<00:03:16.840> incase<00:03:17.170> slider<00:03:17.320> for<00:03:18.160> some

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
thinner than an incase slider for some

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.580 
thinner than an incase slider for some
apparent<00:03:19.000> reason<00:03:19.300> it's<00:03:19.540> i<00:03:19.900> guess<00:03:20.290> it's

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
apparent reason it's i guess it's

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.850 
apparent reason it's i guess it's
because<00:03:20.769> the<00:03:21.489> phones<00:03:21.760> lives<00:03:22.090> very<00:03:22.269> tight<00:03:22.860> with

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 
because the phones lives very tight with

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.680 
because the phones lives very tight with
in<00:03:24.010> this<00:03:24.160> case<00:03:24.370> and<00:03:24.610> the<00:03:24.760> case<00:03:24.970> itself<00:03:25.420> the

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
in this case and the case itself the

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.710 
in this case and the case itself the
edges<00:03:26.110> are<00:03:26.459> built<00:03:27.459> so<00:03:27.730> that<00:03:27.760> it's<00:03:28.120> there's<00:03:28.600> not

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
edges are built so that it's there's not

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.780 
edges are built so that it's there's not
that<00:03:28.780> much<00:03:29.019> excess<00:03:29.410> of<00:03:29.560> room<00:03:29.830> inside<00:03:30.190> so<00:03:30.670> it's

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
that much excess of room inside so it's

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.490 
that much excess of room inside so it's
pretty<00:03:30.970> snug<00:03:31.300> the<00:03:31.540> phone<00:03:31.780> is<00:03:32.080> completely

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
pretty snug the phone is completely

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.660 
pretty snug the phone is completely
protected<00:03:33.430> and<00:03:33.670> it's<00:03:34.360> great<00:03:34.570> right<00:03:35.519> would<00:03:36.519> be

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
protected and it's great right would be

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:38.610 
protected and it's great right would be
nice<00:03:36.820> to<00:03:37.090> have<00:03:37.209> like<00:03:37.510> a<00:03:37.570> screen<00:03:38.080> shield<00:03:38.290> that

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
nice to have like a screen shield that
