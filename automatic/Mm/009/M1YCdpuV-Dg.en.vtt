00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.040
 He has a basic attorney in law but we have to make it ourselves 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.369
 a fourth time ever needed 

00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:14.489
 that whole eu 

00:00:14.489 --> 00:00:16.499
 200 grams of sugar 

00:00:16.499 --> 00:00:22.369
 two hundred little burn both knees before the makers make you have one 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:23.289
 saucepan needed 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:26.990
 that saucepan that must fit in the basin but the ice cubes and the water 

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:30.019
 put cut a stick in half lengthwise 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:34.870
 and then with the back of the human scrape the vernier many out of both 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:36.720
 halves of vermeer stick 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.720
 now everything was possible at the same time 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:46.500
 now the most important 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.280
 to finish the lawyers 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.880
 start with a small you lose 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.020
 and then with the degrees grow very carefully 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.160
 At some point they will see 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.160
 that a nice yellow he was actively getting better and better 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.300
 and we already have that thickness of plain 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.300
 and then it's done 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.160
 do not look directly placed the backer 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.230
 he hits the plates 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:16.460
 he is full of water and the lawyers had the tour play the boat 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:21.340
 that must give feedback otherwise the grabbing process will continue constantly 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:22.820
 stir 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.430
 until you can feel it 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:25.880
 that the temperature 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.210
 practically louwes 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:29.690
 and then ready again 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.130
 it is a nice glass of buildings the lawyers go for 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.160
 to reserve 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.080
 lawyer has cooled 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.620
 an overview day 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.890
 lawyer 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:41.450
 in the glass 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.510
 complete with main source 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:47.110
 gently with a spoon 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:48.390
 on the lawyer 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.510
 not quite tasty so you look even nicer 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:53.190
 yellow is not from the lawyer 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.390
 finish with dark chocolate 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:56.760
 dark chocolate 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.290
 I sheep like that 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:58.930
 everything goes
