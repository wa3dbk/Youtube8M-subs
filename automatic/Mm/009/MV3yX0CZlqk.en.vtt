00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
the wire negative side wire there's the

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.460 
the wire negative side wire there's the
ground<00:00:13.920> the<00:00:14.700> ground<00:00:14.730> part<00:00:15.360> is<00:00:15.660> shredded<00:00:16.230> no

ground the ground part is shredded no

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.890 
ground the ground part is shredded no
wires<00:00:16.710> no<00:00:16.830> good<00:00:17.220> and<00:00:18.210> this<00:00:18.500> terminal<00:00:19.500> here

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:20.900 
wires no good and this terminal here

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.700 
wires no good and this terminal here
it's<00:00:21.900> getting<00:00:22.500> to<00:00:22.830> its<00:00:23.010> tin<00:00:23.869> this<00:00:24.869> a<00:00:25.170> lot<00:00:25.560> of

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
it's getting to its tin this a lot of

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.980 
it's getting to its tin this a lot of
corrosion<00:00:26.130> on<00:00:26.460> it<00:00:26.689> so<00:00:27.689> put<00:00:27.930> it<00:00:28.019> on<00:00:28.140> a<00:00:28.170> new<00:00:28.439> one

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:29.990 
corrosion on it so put it on a new one

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:33.110 
corrosion on it so put it on a new one
because<00:00:31.099> it's<00:00:32.099> not<00:00:32.279> gonna<00:00:32.399> have<00:00:32.610> good<00:00:32.790> ground

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
because it's not gonna have good ground

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.910 
because it's not gonna have good ground
everything<00:00:33.930> you<00:00:33.989> try<00:00:34.140> to<00:00:34.200> start<00:00:34.530> you<00:00:34.680> going<00:00:34.829> to

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
everything you try to start you going to

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:44.060 
everything you try to start you going to

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.660 

you<00:00:45.070> can<00:00:45.280> see<00:00:45.550> down<00:00:45.760> there<00:00:46.150> where<00:00:46.750> the<00:00:47.670> ground

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:48.670 
you can see down there where the ground

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:54.600 
you can see down there where the ground
wire<00:00:50.130> goes<00:00:51.870> it's<00:00:52.870> shredded<00:00:53.620> right<00:00:53.800> there<00:00:54.040> you

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:54.610 
wire goes it's shredded right there you

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:00.520 
can see shredded just another piece

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.130 
can see shredded just another piece
there<00:01:00.700> you<00:01:00.790> just<00:01:00.970> disconnect<00:01:01.239> it<00:01:01.660> from<00:01:01.690> here

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:02.140 
there you just disconnect it from here

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.040 
there you just disconnect it from here
and<00:01:02.350> at<00:01:02.860> the<00:01:02.950> bottom<00:01:02.980> there<00:01:03.489> and<00:01:03.670> just<00:01:04.630> replace

and you want to clean it also one of
this

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:01.760 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.530 

you

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:05.540 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.440 

okay<00:02:06.540> I<00:02:06.570> have<00:02:06.690> to<00:02:06.810> take<00:02:07.050> off<00:02:08.119> take<00:02:09.119> all<00:02:09.300> the

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
okay I have to take off take all the

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:15.470 
okay I have to take off take all the
battery<00:02:10.009> take<00:02:11.009> all<00:02:11.220> the<00:02:11.600> plastic<00:02:14.150> tray<00:02:15.150> and

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
battery take all the plastic tray and

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.170 
battery take all the plastic tray and
this<00:02:15.960> bottom<00:02:16.380> metal<00:02:16.560> trick<00:02:16.920> to<00:02:17.220> get<00:02:17.400> access

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.880 

get<00:02:21.180> the<00:02:21.360> ground<00:02:22.020> on<00:02:22.710> the<00:02:23.690> the<00:02:24.690> engineer<00:02:25.350> side

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
get the ground on the the engineer side

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:31.030 
get the ground on the the engineer side
of<00:02:26.070> the<00:02:26.160> engine<00:02:27.020> right<00:02:28.020> there<00:02:29.390> this<00:02:30.390> is<00:02:30.450> the

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
of the engine right there this is the

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:41.089 
of the engine right there this is the
piece<00:02:33.080> which<00:02:34.080> is<00:02:34.110> a<00:02:34.290> whole<00:02:34.560> long<00:02:37.670> terminal

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:45.619 

through<00:02:41.280> this<00:02:41.459> I<00:02:41.790> guess<00:02:42.599> all<00:02:43.469> cut<00:02:43.829> up<00:02:44.629> pieces

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:45.629 
through this I guess all cut up pieces

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:51.080 
through this I guess all cut up pieces
join<00:02:46.170> here<00:02:48.799> and<00:02:49.799> costing<00:02:50.340> it<00:02:50.459> to<00:02:50.579> get<00:02:50.760> a<00:02:50.790> bad

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
join here and costing it to get a bad

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.690 
join here and costing it to get a bad
drunk<00:02:51.480> and<00:02:52.319> smart<00:02:52.889> you<00:02:52.980> gotta<00:02:53.129> shake<00:02:53.430> it<00:02:53.459> to

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
drunk and smart you gotta shake it to

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.879 
drunk and smart you gotta shake it to
start<00:02:53.999> it<00:02:55.129> took<00:02:56.129> it<00:02:56.310> off<00:02:57.260> and<00:02:58.260> put<00:02:58.379> in<00:02:58.620> a<00:02:58.709> new

00:02:58.879 --> 00:02:58.889 
start it took it off and put in a new

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:03.589 
start it took it off and put in a new
one<00:02:59.719> had<00:03:00.719> a<00:03:00.750> new<00:03:01.049> one<00:03:01.260> and<00:03:01.709> I<00:03:01.799> had<00:03:01.980> this<00:03:02.670> liner

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:03.599 
one had a new one and I had this liner

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:08.000 
one had a new one and I had this liner
on<00:03:04.010> put<00:03:05.010> this<00:03:05.159> new<00:03:05.519> in<00:03:05.700> here<00:03:06.500> if<00:03:07.500> you<00:03:07.620> want<00:03:07.859> you

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
on put this new in here if you want you

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.319 
on put this new in here if you want you
can<00:03:08.189> also<00:03:08.569> solder<00:03:09.569> it<00:03:10.519> throw<00:03:11.519> some<00:03:11.760> salt<00:03:12.030> in

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:12.329 
can also solder it throw some salt in

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:16.849 
can also solder it throw some salt in
but<00:03:12.840> I<00:03:12.870> just<00:03:13.189> put<00:03:14.189> it<00:03:14.310> like<00:03:14.340> this<00:03:15.620> put<00:03:16.620> in<00:03:16.739> the

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:16.859 
but I just put it like this put in the

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:22.119 
but I just put it like this put in the
new<00:03:17.040> the<00:03:17.959> same<00:03:19.639> negative<00:03:20.639> terminal<00:03:21.150> I<00:03:21.180> had<00:03:21.329> an

00:03:22.119 --> 00:03:22.129 
new the same negative terminal I had an

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:25.399 
new the same negative terminal I had an
identical<00:03:23.129> one<00:03:23.449> so<00:03:24.449> I<00:03:24.510> put<00:03:24.780> in<00:03:24.900> the<00:03:25.049> new<00:03:25.199> one

00:03:25.399 --> 00:03:25.409 
identical one so I put in the new one

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:27.939 
identical one so I put in the new one
instead<00:03:25.919> of<00:03:26.069> instead<00:03:26.760> of<00:03:26.819> cutting<00:03:27.180> that<00:03:27.449> and

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:27.949 
instead of instead of cutting that and

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:31.970 
instead of instead of cutting that and
joining<00:03:28.949> it<00:03:29.159> back<00:03:29.370> it<00:03:29.790> was<00:03:29.909> gonna<00:03:30.090> be<00:03:30.269> sharp<00:03:30.980> so

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
joining it back it was gonna be sharp so

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:37.629 
joining it back it was gonna be sharp so
I<00:03:32.040> put<00:03:32.310> in<00:03:32.400> the<00:03:32.519> new<00:03:32.669> one<00:03:33.409> one<00:03:34.409> grown<00:03:35.719> body<00:03:36.719> here

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:37.639 
I put in the new one one grown body here

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:41.569 
I put in the new one one grown body here
and<00:03:38.639> the<00:03:39.510> other<00:03:39.719> one<00:03:39.959> to<00:03:40.199> the<00:03:40.290> engine<00:03:40.709> that's

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 
and the other one to the engine that's
