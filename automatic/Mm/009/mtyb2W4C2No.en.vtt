but<00:02:15.720> that<00:02:15.840> was<00:02:15.930> just<00:02:16.080> an<00:02:16.170> example<00:02:16.260> of<00:02:16.650> what<00:02:16.830> I

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
but that was just an example of what I

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.320 
but that was just an example of what I
do<00:02:17.010> to<00:02:17.880> get<00:02:18.000> them<00:02:18.090> out<00:02:19.100> however<00:02:20.180> there<00:02:21.180> are<00:02:21.300> a

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
do to get them out however there are a

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.870 
do to get them out however there are a
few<00:02:21.990> key<00:02:22.380> points<00:02:22.710> that<00:02:22.980> you<00:02:23.220> need<00:02:23.460> to<00:02:23.640> remember

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880

while<00:02:24.300> doing<00:02:24.750> your<00:02:25.760> chameleon

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
while doing your chameleon

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.830 
while doing your chameleon
I<00:02:27.120> guess<00:02:27.870> training<00:02:28.530> or<00:02:28.740> handling<00:02:29.300> you<00:02:30.300> have<00:02:30.570> to

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
I guess training or handling you have to

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.530 
I guess training or handling you have to
be<00:02:31.020> patient<00:02:31.350> this<00:02:32.070> isn't<00:02:32.430> an<00:02:32.550> instant<00:02:33.000> process

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
be patient this isn't an instant process

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.700 
be patient this isn't an instant process
and<00:02:33.780> it's<00:02:34.230> all<00:02:34.410> about<00:02:34.590> trust<00:02:36.020> one<00:02:37.020> day<00:02:37.230> they

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710 
and it's all about trust one day they

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:39.140 
and it's all about trust one day they
could<00:02:37.770> be<00:02:37.980> totally<00:02:38.130> fine<00:02:38.460> the<00:02:38.730> next<00:02:38.970> day<00:02:39.090> you

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
could be totally fine the next day you

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.390 
could be totally fine the next day you
grab<00:02:39.510> them<00:02:39.780> you<00:02:40.260> reach<00:02:40.440> in<00:02:40.650> there<00:02:40.830> and<00:02:40.860> grab

now
that<00:04:40.830> sounds<00:04:41.100> a<00:04:41.130> little<00:04:41.190> weird<00:04:41.340> but<00:04:41.610> if<00:04:42.150> you

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
that sounds a little weird but if you

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:43.790 
that sounds a little weird but if you
bring<00:04:42.480> in<00:04:42.660> with<00:04:42.840> a<00:04:42.870> cricket<00:04:43.260> in<00:04:43.350> your<00:04:43.470> fingers

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800 
bring in with a cricket in your fingers

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.350 
bring in with a cricket in your fingers
and<00:04:44.040> they're<00:04:44.190> comfortable<00:04:44.400> enough<00:04:44.670> to<00:04:44.850> eat<00:04:45.240> it

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 
and they're comfortable enough to eat it

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.330 
and they're comfortable enough to eat it
out<00:04:45.480> of<00:04:45.510> your<00:04:45.750> fingers<00:04:46.110> or<00:04:46.380> even<00:04:46.980> I<00:04:47.190> have<00:04:47.310> a

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
feeding bucket that I feed them with

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.020 
feeding bucket that I feed them with
that's<00:04:49.710> totally<00:04:50.250> fine<00:04:50.460> that's<00:04:50.790> still

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
that's totally fine that's still
