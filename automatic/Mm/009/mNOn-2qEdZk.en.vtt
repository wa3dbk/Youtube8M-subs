00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:29.930
 Hello, construction continues here 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:32.870
 on this side I said I already past 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:36.230
 series I have difficulties with all 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:41.270
 these profiles crossbars rafter 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:46.360
 and so on so I decided bye 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:46.360
 leave this wall is the only thing 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:51.260
 secured the wire 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:54.739
 cable corrugation here on the output 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:01:00.080
 and he put on eclipse glasses by himself 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:01:06.950
 top and on the other side brought the same 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:08.300
 wires to 1 here it will be for lighting 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.940
 up to consist light sensor 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:14.000
 small light bulbs that will 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:16.550
 automatically turn on when it gets dark 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.430
 so that the yard was light well, not light 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:21.350
 Well, at least some light was this 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:25.280
 the only thing is that this wall is made and 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:28.760
 remade mount gas pipes they have 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:31.730
 I was directly attached to the wall 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:35.360
 Now and their secured thus prim 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:37.490
 crossbar us canopy in principle of difference 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:41.330
 no, I think the pipe is not hard anywhere 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:48.130
 go away and here are a few 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:48.130
 mounts now holds this pipe 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:57.470
 and decided to do all the same front face 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:02:00.470
 side of the house and so the whole process 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:02.860
 now it is here evening sun he 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.860
 comes in 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:12.310
 managed today to make the frame completely 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:16.910
 and even sewn cap 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:19.940
 also took over the counter now it's worth 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:24.050
 already on the frame used to put here on 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:26.300
 stenochke kazhet Cyril Perrin's little 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:30.260
 below it made cable intercepted 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:35.050
 because I hung it just below 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:38.840
 now this will have to be repaired all 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:42.290
 heat insulation here that steam moisture 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:47.510
 insulation or how their waterproofing who 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:50.360
 as calls but want to say one thing when 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:52.989
 I bought this waterproofing on it 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:57.290
 it was written that it is used for 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:59.980
 facades and I tried to blow through it 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:05.019
 it is inflated that is, it passes air 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:07.610
 but it doesn't matter 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:09.860
 frame as I boil the whole is finished already 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:14.200
 began to sew sokal 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:17.750
 and here I didn't have a piece 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:21.110
 This piece is not enough sadly 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:25.160
 annoyingly but have to do with stubs 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:28.370
 I have here such a stub stayed 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:30.950
 I make him the butt sealant promazhem 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:33.080
 From here I shook it as it should not 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:40.269
 buy the same whole panel plant these 10 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:44.630
 centimeters also here is already tide 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:50.570
 this is all worth the only thing 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:53.690
 it will be necessary here in this place with rivets 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:55.970
 rivet them together so they don’t bother 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:04:00.370
 whether from each other and then everything will be 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:04.370
 wonderful here the alignment of the panels 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:06.950
 turned out somewhat different than on their 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:09.050
 the walls there my panels got to 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:12.010
 windows here they do not reach pasha here 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:14.990
 entire cap and lowered below 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:18.770
 Absolutely the whole link below that is to 

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:21.530
 the very bottom height difference is just 

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:25.370
 three centimeters was and here in this place 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:29.090
 But if I take a closer look I did not throw off 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:32.300
 also a small brown substrate 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:36.860
 lane there is 57 centimeters but often so 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:41.380
 so that the holes could not with roundabout panels 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:44.510
 here the same trouble that is seams visible 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:49.350
 above almost no bottom 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:52.380
 there are cracks so 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:56.240
 Here are these seamless panels so to speak. 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:57.420
 not very good eat better 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:01.560
 panels 

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:03.270
 goes along the seam brick masonry there stone or 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.580
 something else then he hides him 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:09.750
 practically nevian now we only 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:13.080
 we can guess where the seams are just 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:15.900
 I’m not going to be at the bottom then later 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:19.230
 it almost won't be here now 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:21.590
 it can be seen so well in general principle 

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:25.980
 Here is such a small reviewer 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:31.100
 for today or tomorrow I hope if everything will be 

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:31.100
 successful may even finish this wall 

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:39.030
 I will go to the top and there it will be seen as 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:42.900
 be further by the way 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:47.630
 pliers that i have these things 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:50.790
 original like this just as well as all 

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:52.650
 so not ten times not at this most 

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:55.410
 took the old pliers found two bands 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:06:02.750
 metal welded and now i'm calm 

00:05:55.410 --> 00:06:02.750
 I 'll take it so close angina in general so 

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:10.260
 no chance 

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:13.680
 work is moving slowly right now 

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:16.170
 you can see by the way how curved the wall is 

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:18.600
 someone offered me foam at home 

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:22.640
 it's just align here if 

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:25.080
 look right up here from me 

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:27.720
 thermal insulation is almost impressed into 

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:30.720
 we will set the wall, that is, its profile 

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:33.290
 crushed even the top had there 

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:37.559
 raise profile sides 

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:42.639
 drive to be closer to the wall 

00:06:37.559 --> 00:06:50.279
 but if you look down here we have 

00:06:42.639 --> 00:06:54.399
 here to heat insulation 12 centimeters 

00:06:50.279 --> 00:06:59.110
 here you can see perfectly how big 

00:06:54.399 --> 00:07:02.199
 the difference is there is a wall roughly uneven 

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:05.020
 somewhere 12 centimeters 15 in some 

00:07:02.199 --> 00:07:09.399
 places that is imagine arm here 

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:12.969
 runs free and squeezed up at the top 

00:07:09.399 --> 00:07:17.409
 profile here are such here before 

00:07:12.969 --> 00:07:19.389
 built nobody paid attention to it 

00:07:17.409 --> 00:07:22.769
 on and we did it all so by eye 

00:07:19.389 --> 00:07:25.809
 and now we have to suffer 

00:07:22.769 --> 00:07:28.719
 align it all first in the house it 

00:07:25.809 --> 00:07:34.240
 all leveled now leveled at 

00:07:28.719 --> 00:07:36.539
 the street is all in general so good luck to all 

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:36.539
 until 

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:41.019
 we will move on in this 

00:07:40.209 --> 00:07:44.939
 direction 

00:07:41.019 --> 00:07:44.939
 to achieve a good result
