00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:09.510
 the 

00:00:14.069 --> 00:00:17.069
 the 

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:25.859
 according to the police about a thousand people 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.859
 the superstar then bonus culture 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:33.150
 this piece was built in the late seventies 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.390
 so in the same rotterdam 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.390
 and I think I knew twice with it 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:41.930
 now is in the Netherlands 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.930
 with a braided line behind it 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.710
 very strong stuff 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.710
 that I am going to fish in a place where quite a few can be done individually 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.710
 simplicity is the motto for today 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.710
 and that starts with the isu skating association 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.900
 phase 2 is a protected topper 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.830
 followed then piece of silicone hose 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.540
 and a toothpick 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.390
 the toothpicks three stopper 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.390
 and the on the weight for the silicone slim to compensate 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:23.870
 that's how it should work 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:27.580
 the hook is important 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.580
 and especially the way you use the buttons 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.910
 what you see is your buddy 38 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:36.460
 with the black hat 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.250
 and the company for outside 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.250
 through the eye on top 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.350
 I use a simple sample more often 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.060
 lubbers it is not clear 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.600
 your plant head 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.600
 but just nice and concentrated fresh 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.890
 everything is ready 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.090
 only in the wrong place 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.730
 this looks more like i got the security one more time 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.730
 taken along 

00:02:24.919 --> 00:02:27.989
 many people who want to help 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:30.989
 so for them not at all a little bit nervous 

00:02:31.649 --> 00:02:35.879
 I will end up with two best when scores come only plastic tube 

00:02:37.899 --> 00:02:40.749
 previously the other side invested 

00:02:40.749 --> 00:02:45.549
 the ditch has been harder but i'm going on police is the man 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:47.149
 the side 

00:02:47.149 --> 00:02:53.010
 I am four balls exception was abducted no more it is free art 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.110
 7 I wanted a big cloud about succession 

00:02:56.749 --> 00:02:59.269
 the fisherman I want to borrow 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:03.899
 the large specimens want clarity especially the putting if that is ready 

00:04:24.559 --> 00:04:26.789
 is the first 

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:29.370
 we can't make it more fun 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.370
 as wilders 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:16.330
 tribute 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:20.699
 what a whining 

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:23.699
 kurt desplenter know 

00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:04.650
 that has rained heavily on the second album 

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:07.270
 an attentive fan 

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:09.219
 rim is a few euros 

00:06:09.219 --> 00:06:12.460
 therefore they become active again 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:14.449
 the us became 

00:06:14.449 --> 00:06:16.809
 it is and remains a lot better 

00:06:16.809 --> 00:06:20.129
 the interruption between the fifty and sixty domestic product 

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:23.710
 for example, to listen to telephones 

00:06:36.529 --> 00:06:38.009
 the reason 

00:06:38.009 --> 00:06:39.939
 what I am ready for 

00:06:39.939 --> 00:06:44.180
 ridiculous rotterdam drying up the british open space 

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:46.689
 this brought 

00:06:46.689 --> 00:06:49.739
 during the summer period said that most banks 

00:06:50.919 --> 00:06:53.919
 I am still a miracle 

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:57.529
 for the Waarderpolder 

00:06:57.529 --> 00:06:59.669
 but luckily it is dry 

00:06:59.669 --> 00:07:02.669
 nana who at earlier I lost some vain 

00:07:03.569 --> 00:07:05.539
 they just kept coming 

00:07:05.539 --> 00:07:08.539
 what were despite the bad weather 

00:07:08.539 --> 00:07:10.889
 the idle numbers 

00:07:10.889 --> 00:07:11.800
 did the rounds
