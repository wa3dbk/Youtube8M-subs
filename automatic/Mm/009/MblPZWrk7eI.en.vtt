00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
crazier you reach this level you know I

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.399 
crazier you reach this level you know I
guess<00:01:11.820> it<00:01:11.939> was<00:01:12.060> I<00:01:12.390> don't<00:01:12.689> know<00:01:12.780> a<00:01:12.869> year<00:01:13.080> ago

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
guess it was I don't know a year ago

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:14.690 
guess it was I don't know a year ago
when<00:01:13.560> they<00:01:13.619> had<00:01:13.740> Beast<00:01:13.920> Boy<00:01:14.070> peeing<00:01:14.400> in<00:01:14.580> an

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
when they had Beast Boy peeing in an

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.249 
when they had Beast Boy peeing in an
elevator<00:01:15.090> I<00:01:15.299> thought<00:01:15.479> there's<00:01:15.689> no<00:01:15.930> way<00:01:16.110> they

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
elevator I thought there's no way they

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.230 
elevator I thought there's no way they
can<00:01:16.320> go<00:01:16.530> crazier<00:01:16.920> than<00:01:17.040> this<00:01:17.189> and<00:01:17.400> they<00:01:17.820> do<00:01:17.880> we

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
can go crazier than this and they do we

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.840 
can go crazier than this and they do we
just<00:01:18.479> in<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.840> hundredths<00:01:19.229> episode<00:01:19.619> they<00:01:20.610> took

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
just in the hundredths episode they took

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.969 
just in the hundredths episode they took
a<00:01:20.909> risk<00:01:21.180> and<00:01:21.570> we<00:01:21.930> went<00:01:22.140> completely<00:01:22.500> without

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
a risk and we went completely without

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.710 
a risk and we went completely without
sound<00:01:23.369> for<00:01:23.670> I<00:01:23.700> don't<00:01:23.909> know<00:01:23.970> how<00:01:24.090> many<00:01:24.150> seconds

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
sound for I don't know how many seconds

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.289 
sound for I don't know how many seconds
but<00:01:24.960> that's<00:01:25.530> a<00:01:25.619> huge<00:01:25.830> risk<00:01:25.979> and<00:01:26.340> then<00:01:26.460> the

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
but that's a huge risk and then the

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.060 
but that's a huge risk and then the
Titans<00:01:27.630> provided<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.170> soundtrack<00:01:28.500> and<00:01:28.829> sound

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
Titans provided the soundtrack and sound

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.620 
Titans provided the soundtrack and sound
effects<00:01:29.369> so<00:01:29.549> that<00:01:29.700> was<00:01:29.790> pretty<00:01:29.970> cool<00:01:30.150> there

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
effects so that was pretty cool there

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.030 
effects so that was pretty cool there
are<00:01:30.780> ones<00:01:30.960> coming<00:01:31.229> up<00:01:31.409> they<00:01:31.560> get<00:01:31.650> even<00:01:31.799> crazier

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
are ones coming up they get even crazier

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.010
