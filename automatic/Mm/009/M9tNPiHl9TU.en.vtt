00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 Hey, people, it's okay, be well. 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.830
 coming to the channel without having to where they go 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:09.830

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:09.830
 delighted 

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:18.270
 I already told in a video of the hall mouth that is 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.359
 a saga that follows the line the planes of the 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.699
 time and malevolent what are those movies 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.279
 so different that they recount from the tales 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.859
 of fairy and so I bought box he came 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.539
 until ripped I asked the other and they 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.960
 they sent and it's very closed then 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:36.450
 show this to you and I do not like it 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.239
 resistant books only with the name that 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.800
 it cost him more or less 29 93 book 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.260
 so in this video I'll show you 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.670
 is to conquer this book you understand 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.670
 boxer this one 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:54.930
 How can you see how torn it is? 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:58.890
 here look what a horrible thing and so the 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:05.729
 13 books the first book is poison has 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:08.369
 the cover as you are snow white and 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.770
 so that little box is not so 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:14.250
 resistant, not 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:18.000
 It's the choice they're white but there's a 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:20.909
 good size so it's not that thing 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.700
 just very thin it is very little 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:28.380
 Tough will last a lot the second 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:31.070
 book is a spell that has 19 for this 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.440
 here is one behind the leader her 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.270
 one would be I do not know many things about 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.520
 complicated but people are very 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.650
 here the ones that connect to the fans of 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.530
 once upon a time in green is behind the 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:44.300
 books when to see what the same thing 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.070
 in the book will not be different 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:49.570
 miley making this well is 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:53.119
 damaging and the third book is to have 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:54.830

00:01:53.119 --> 00:02:00.950
 how to know i do not know who these are 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:02:04.009
 women in mats the same thing you 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.530
 sit is so into buying and economical 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:09.289
 can you ask if it's economical 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:12.800
 not because it spoke on the league's website 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:15.350
 only 90 left each is a saga that 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.130
 people are talking very well I do not know 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.080
 huh 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.180
 Let's see what it is but how I said it. 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.890
 so it's a very tough boxing the 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.680
 books are an economical choice but 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:27.590

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.690
