the<00:01:05.280> first<00:01:05.400> combination<00:01:05.670> i'm<00:01:05.909> gonna<00:01:06.030> break

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
the first combination i'm gonna break

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.580 
the first combination i'm gonna break
down<00:01:06.210> how<00:01:06.420> we<00:01:06.479> should<00:01:06.600> be<00:01:06.720> hitting<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:06.960> bag<00:01:07.140> so

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
down how we should be hitting the bag so

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.340 
down how we should be hitting the bag so
first<00:01:07.860> combination<00:01:08.130> is<00:01:08.369> a<00:01:08.430> one<00:01:08.640> two<00:01:08.909> three<00:01:09.350> one

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
first combination is a one two three one

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.660 
first combination is a one two three one
of<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.799> first<00:01:10.979> time<00:01:11.100> mission<00:01:11.310> should<00:01:11.460> know

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
and we do earlier already it's a jab so

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.280 
and we do earlier already it's a jab so
it's<00:01:15.119> a<00:01:15.180> job<00:01:15.830> across<00:01:16.830> and<00:01:17.430> a<00:01:17.790> hook<00:01:18.000> right<00:01:18.360> now

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
it's a job across and a hook right now

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.410 
it's a job across and a hook right now
very<00:01:19.770> important<00:01:20.400> when<00:01:20.460> we<00:01:20.580> do<00:01:20.670> this<00:01:20.759> bag<00:01:21.000> then

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
very important when we do this bag then
