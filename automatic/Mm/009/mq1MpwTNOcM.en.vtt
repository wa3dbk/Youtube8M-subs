other adults that still want to live
that<00:02:42.220> in<00:02:42.670> their<00:02:42.850> minds<00:02:43.360> are<00:02:43.510> building<00:02:44.200> hot

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
that in their minds are building hot

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:50.970 
that in their minds are building hot
rods<00:02:44.470> and<00:02:45.300> that's<00:02:46.300> great<00:02:46.540> but<00:02:49.590> the<00:02:50.590> last<00:02:50.769> thing

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
rods and that's great but the last thing

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.430 
rods and that's great but the last thing
I<00:02:51.160> want<00:02:51.400> is<00:02:51.549> another<00:02:52.140> vehicle<00:02:53.140> that<00:02:53.170> has<00:02:53.410> a

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
I want is another vehicle that has a

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.530 
I want is another vehicle that has a
motor<00:02:53.799> on<00:02:53.920> it<00:02:54.930> and<00:02:56.880> since<00:02:57.880> we're<00:02:58.090> all<00:02:58.239> into

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
motor on it and since we're all into

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.100 
motor on it and since we're all into
bicycles<00:03:00.180> that's<00:03:01.180> what<00:03:01.420> we're<00:03:01.570> building<00:03:01.720> is

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
bicycles that's what we're building is

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:07.770 
bicycles that's what we're building is
like<00:03:02.350> a<00:03:02.519> little<00:03:03.519> pedal<00:03:03.880> powered<00:03:04.150> hot<00:03:04.360> rod<00:03:06.780> and

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
like a little pedal powered hot rod and

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.899 
like a little pedal powered hot rod and
it's<00:03:08.500> fun

00:03:12.899 --> 00:03:12.909 

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:16.390 

as<00:03:13.909> far<00:03:14.180> as<00:03:14.209> the<00:03:14.390> racing<00:03:14.860> that's<00:03:15.860> going<00:03:16.129> to<00:03:16.220> be

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
as far as the racing that's going to be

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:22.270 
as far as the racing that's going to be
that's<00:03:17.209> the<00:03:17.450> unknown<00:03:17.900> for<00:03:18.290> me<00:03:20.980> we<00:03:21.980> could<00:03:22.190> have

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
that's the unknown for me we could have

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.130 
that's the unknown for me we could have
just<00:03:22.459> said<00:03:22.640> let's<00:03:22.790> do<00:03:23.090> an<00:03:23.269> oval<00:03:23.599> track<00:03:23.870> and

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
just said let's do an oval track and

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:25.479 
just said let's do an oval track and
that<00:03:24.170> would<00:03:24.379> probably<00:03:24.409> have<00:03:24.830> been<00:03:24.860> just<00:03:25.310> great

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489 
that would probably have been just great

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:28.740 
that would probably have been just great
but<00:03:25.940> i<00:03:26.560> think<00:03:27.560> the<00:03:27.650> figure<00:03:27.829> 8<00:03:28.069> adds<00:03:28.310> a<00:03:28.489> whole

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
but i think the figure 8 adds a whole

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.360 
but i think the figure 8 adds a whole
element<00:03:29.750> that<00:03:30.110> an<00:03:30.549> element<00:03:31.549> of<00:03:31.610> mystery<00:03:32.090> I

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
element that an element of mystery I

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.319 
element that an element of mystery I
don't<00:03:34.370> know<00:03:34.430> what's<00:03:34.610> going<00:03:34.790> to<00:03:34.849> happen<00:03:34.909> when

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:35.329 
don't know what's going to happen when

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:42.399 
don't know what's going to happen when
we're<00:03:35.920> getting<00:03:36.920> into<00:03:37.340> that<00:03:37.489> x<00:03:38.360> zone<00:03:41.290> are<00:03:42.290> we

00:03:42.399 --> 00:03:42.409 
we're getting into that x zone are we

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:43.990 
we're getting into that x zone are we
going<00:03:42.560> to<00:03:42.650> be<00:03:42.739> skidding<00:03:43.129> out<00:03:43.400> are<00:03:43.640> we<00:03:43.700> going<00:03:43.910> to

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
going to be skidding out are we going to

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.740 
going to be skidding out are we going to
be<00:03:44.120> near<00:03:44.840> miss<00:03:47.470> we'll<00:03:48.470> have<00:03:48.590> to<00:03:48.739> wait<00:03:48.920> and<00:03:48.980> see

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
be near miss we'll have to wait and see

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:55.690 
be near miss we'll have to wait and see
as<00:03:50.750> far<00:03:51.049> as<00:03:51.079> building<00:03:51.349> the<00:03:51.620> cars<00:03:51.920> I<00:03:53.379> mean<00:03:54.700> I'm

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:55.700 
as far as building the cars I mean I'm

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:00.009 
as far as building the cars I mean I'm
not<00:03:56.030> making<00:03:56.390> it<00:03:56.510> very<00:03:56.629> complicated<00:03:58.810> one<00:03:59.810> wheel

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:00.019 
not making it very complicated one wheel

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:07.000 
not making it very complicated one wheel
drive<00:04:00.379> seems<00:04:00.769> to<00:04:00.980> be<00:04:01.129> just<00:04:01.609> fine<00:04:05.500> the<00:04:06.500> steering

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
drive seems to be just fine the steering

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.339 
drive seems to be just fine the steering
has<00:04:07.159> been<00:04:07.370> the<00:04:07.549> most<00:04:07.730> the<00:04:08.510> funnest<00:04:08.930> part<00:04:09.140> for

00:04:09.339 --> 00:04:09.349 
has been the most the funnest part for

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:14.159 
has been the most the funnest part for
me<00:04:09.470> because<00:04:09.709> I<00:04:09.829> don't<00:04:10.040> understand<00:04:11.000> all<00:04:11.299> the

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:14.169 

00:04:14.169 --> 00:04:17.680 

ackerman<00:04:15.169> and<00:04:15.470> all<00:04:15.590> that<00:04:15.829> thing<00:04:16.419> but<00:04:17.419> I'm

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
ackerman and all that thing but I'm

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.080 
ackerman and all that thing but I'm
playing<00:04:17.989> around<00:04:18.320> with<00:04:18.500> it<00:04:18.620> and<00:04:18.739> getting

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
playing around with it and getting

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:21.520 
playing around with it and getting
better<00:04:20.090> results<00:04:20.510> every<00:04:20.959> time<00:04:20.989> I<00:04:21.200> change

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 
better results every time I change

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:26.200 
better results every time I change
something<00:04:22.099> so<00:04:24.190> it'll<00:04:25.190> actually<00:04:25.370> corner

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210 
something so it'll actually corner

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:31.960 
something so it'll actually corner
pretty<00:04:26.450> well<00:04:26.660> now<00:04:26.930> oh<00:04:27.820> I<00:04:28.820> did<00:04:29.150> that<00:04:29.360> wrong<00:04:30.970> plus

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:31.970 
pretty well now oh I did that wrong plus

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:37.270 
pretty well now oh I did that wrong plus
I<00:04:34.960> like<00:04:35.960> to<00:04:36.110> point<00:04:36.289> out<00:04:36.470> that<00:04:36.680> it's<00:04:36.889> this<00:04:37.070> whole

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.280 
I like to point out that it's this whole

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.230 
I like to point out that it's this whole
process<00:04:37.580> is<00:04:37.880> the<00:04:38.210> fun<00:04:38.389> part<00:04:39.340> like<00:04:40.340> oh<00:04:40.520> it's<00:04:41.030> not

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240 
process is the fun part like oh it's not

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.240 
process is the fun part like oh it's not
I<00:04:41.479> did<00:04:41.750> it<00:04:41.870> wrong<00:04:42.080> and<00:04:42.380> I<00:04:42.440> have<00:04:42.680> to<00:04:42.860> do<00:04:43.010> it<00:04:43.130> over

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.250 
I did it wrong and I have to do it over

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:45.279 
I did it wrong and I have to do it over
again<00:04:43.430> it<00:04:43.880> so<00:04:44.060> I<00:04:44.090> did<00:04:44.389> it<00:04:44.510> wrong<00:04:44.690> and<00:04:44.960> I<00:04:45.020> get<00:04:45.169> to

00:04:45.279 --> 00:04:45.289 
again it so I did it wrong and I get to

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:48.040 
again it so I did it wrong and I get to
do<00:04:45.440> it<00:04:45.620> again<00:04:45.680> I<00:04:46.210> get<00:04:47.210> to<00:04:47.330> put<00:04:47.510> this<00:04:47.630> wheel<00:04:47.840> on

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
do it again I get to put this wheel on

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:52.750 
do it again I get to put this wheel on
again<00:04:50.349> like<00:04:51.349> a<00:04:51.380> friend<00:04:51.770> of<00:04:51.889> mine<00:04:52.039> was<00:04:52.280> building
