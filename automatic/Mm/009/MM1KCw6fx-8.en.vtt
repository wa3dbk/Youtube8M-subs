 and we start our flysplay on minecraft 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.530
 with mods let's start with the first chapter in which 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.290
 there will only be a metallurgy mod 2 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:17.750
 Well, there are all sorts of other small fashion, we 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:23.789
 create a new world and called it 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:26.900
 passage here and let's see 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.900
 where we drop off 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.320
 come on 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.340
 let's load 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.120
 Well 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.450
 to 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:01.420
 something happened 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:15.300
 and we appeared snow biome 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.300
 with tall trees and 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:22.260
 generally 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:25.070
 now since this is a new world for me 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:29.520
 there was a slight reincarnation a 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:33.810
 I have mine now 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.580

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:41.580
 orange can see the eyes when I turn 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:44.280
 the fact that my character is canon 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.350
 burning eyes here I find here and made 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.020
 and gloves played with a finger not a move 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.660
 only the scabbard behind themselves for swords well 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.970
 actually need to envision a 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:57.000
 feature to be invisible so skin 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:02:03.030
 canonically and we get immediately the whole 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:04.800
 two saplings pixel well what are you 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:11.820

 and what of them can be done 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:50.140
 behind the fallen leaves face oak foliage 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:52.950
 An ode is a very useful thing girls growing 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:55.870

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.530

 time to cut a huge fir tree 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:41.080

00:04:36.939 --> 00:04:53.519

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:53.519
 money is three three blocks and so 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:05:00.640

 actually nothing is possible for this 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:16.380
 would need 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:19.420
 we will only make ourselves easy wooden 

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:22.480
 but the rest can be stupidly burn a 

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:26.860
 now we will dig a stone 

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:32.790
 do yourself a stone pick 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:37.330
 only this all together from this 

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:40.990

 distracted doing a discount on this 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:00.610
 just a very, very green outrage 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:03.730
 composite teacher as seen i created 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:05.950
 the world with you no gray did not have time 

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:08.170
 lead as well Th 

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:13.050
 settle to stone from stuffed 

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:13.050
 of course the stove we all love stoves 

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:23.160
 so on the stove we have now on 

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:23.160
 tools ax there 

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:29.550
 there are still shovels 

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:33.510
 well it's still dug up so let's collect 

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:33.510
 collect the ax himself on bystrenkomu 

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:44.590
 yes take krasti shelves have TIr 4 now 

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:44.590
 I'll make a hatchet 

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.160
 and shovel 

00:06:48.639 --> 00:06:54.509
 he's so 

00:06:50.889 --> 00:06:54.509
 stone age of people 

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:07.660
 Well, if I cut one such tree there 

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:12.730
 enough to fill it 

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:16.750
 There is no head on the floor but you only 

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:20.790
 look what or this 

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:20.790
 I understand this tree 

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:26.670
 you can crap 

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:37.660
 but we have to do everything from pixie from 

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:44.850
 this strange well from this strange 

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:48.520
 colors and so where's the house I already lost it 

00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:50.320
 snow snow dig and now would I fashionably 

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:54.570
 snowballs exploding and all would be kicked out 

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:58.930
 kapets so 

00:07:54.570 --> 00:08:00.340
 dig a hollow here will not give warcraft 

00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:04.050
 will be the final part therefore 

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:08.980
 hollow and we'll just be our goal 

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:10.870
 our goal is to make picks what is a flower 

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:14.820
 sisal the fact that this dam is very rare 

00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:14.820
 stuff what
