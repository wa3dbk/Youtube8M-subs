his<00:03:51.870> Susanoo<00:03:52.590> sword<00:03:52.889> back<00:03:53.220> then<00:03:53.459> if<00:03:53.730> you<00:03:53.940> know

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060

what<00:03:54.209> I<00:03:54.239> mean

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
what I mean

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.259 
what I mean
because<00:03:55.019> there's<00:03:55.319> no<00:03:55.620> rhyme<00:03:56.069> or<00:03:56.370> reason<00:03:56.430> why

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 
because there's no rhyme or reason why

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:59.149 
because there's no rhyme or reason why
she<00:03:57.480> should<00:03:57.690> still<00:03:58.049> be<00:03:58.349> in<00:03:58.379> love<00:03:58.829> with<00:03:59.069> this
