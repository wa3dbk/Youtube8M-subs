00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:34.989 
now this is something I've been thinking
about<00:00:33.140> recently<00:00:33.589> because<00:00:34.069> I<00:00:34.370> know<00:00:34.699> that<00:00:34.969> I

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:34.999 
about recently because I know that I

00:00:34.999 --> 00:00:37.329 
about recently because I know that I
have<00:00:35.449> and<00:00:35.839> I<00:00:36.109> think<00:00:36.170> most<00:00:37.010> of<00:00:37.219> you<00:00:37.309> probably

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:37.339

have<00:00:37.819> a<00:00:37.850> feeling<00:00:38.449> that<00:00:38.479> there's<00:00:38.780> something

00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:38.809 
have a feeling that there's something

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:42.489 
have a feeling that there's something
really<00:00:39.319> special<00:00:39.440> about<00:00:39.920> cubing<00:00:40.579> and<00:00:41.409> you<00:00:42.409> know

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:46.370 
that might be and so what I started was

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.340

what I started with was taking a look at
what<00:00:48.979> the<00:00:49.129> Cuban<00:00:49.729> community<00:00:49.850> is<00:00:50.420> what<00:00:51.079> we<00:00:51.199> have

I<00:01:45.950> think<00:01:46.130> that's<00:01:46.280> really<00:01:46.370> cool<00:01:46.700> and<00:01:46.940> so<00:01:47.780> you

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
I think that's really cool and so you

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.440 
I think that's really cool and so you
know<00:01:48.560> the<00:01:48.770> thing<00:01:48.920> is<00:01:48.980> all<00:01:49.490> that<00:01:50.060> stuff<00:01:50.300> that<00:01:50.330> I

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
know the thing is all that stuff that I

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.210 
know the thing is all that stuff that I
just<00:01:50.630> listed<00:01:50.840> it's<00:01:51.080> all<00:01:51.200> really<00:01:51.350> great<00:01:51.590> but<00:01:52.010> I

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
just listed it's all really great but I

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.340 
just listed it's all really great but I
don't<00:01:52.430> think<00:01:52.610> that<00:01:52.730> it's<00:01:53.210> really<00:01:53.540> special<00:01:54.110> to

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
don't think that it's really special to

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.530 
don't think that it's really special to
cubing<00:01:54.860> because<00:01:55.490> you<00:01:55.670> can<00:01:55.820> find<00:01:56.030> plenty<00:01:56.120> of

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 
cubing because you can find plenty of

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.360 
cubing because you can find plenty of
other<00:01:56.720> communities<00:01:57.560> centered<00:01:57.950> around<00:01:58.040> how

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:58.370 
other communities centered around how

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:00.700 
other communities centered around how
these<00:01:58.580> that<00:01:59.120> you<00:01:59.570> know<00:01:59.690> have<00:02:00.050> you<00:02:00.320> know<00:02:00.470> really

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
these that you know have you know really

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.570 
these that you know have you know really

fun activity or exist online or you know

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.190 
fun activity or exist online or you know

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
where people come together to do it or

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.330 
where people come together to do it or
where<00:02:06.350> people<00:02:06.620> are<00:02:06.710> really<00:02:06.860> friendly<00:02:07.100> and

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
where people are really friendly and

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.550 
where people are really friendly and
welcoming<00:02:07.640> you<00:02:08.450> know<00:02:08.569> that's<00:02:08.810> not<00:02:09.019> specific

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
welcoming you know that's not specific

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.280 
welcoming you know that's not specific
to<00:02:09.920> cubing<00:02:10.340> and<00:02:11.269> I<00:02:11.359> started<00:02:11.599> to<00:02:11.659> get<00:02:11.719> a<00:02:11.780> little

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
to cubing and I started to get a little

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.530 
to cubing and I started to get a little
as<00:02:12.560> I<00:02:12.680> was<00:02:12.799> thinking<00:02:13.069> about<00:02:13.189> this<00:02:13.400> because<00:02:13.670> you

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
as I was thinking about this because you

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.059 
as I was thinking about this because you
know<00:02:14.629> it<00:02:14.719> seemed<00:02:14.900> like<00:02:15.079> you<00:02:15.590> know<00:02:15.709> cubing

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
know it seemed like you know cubing

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:18.069 
know it seemed like you know cubing
doesn't<00:02:16.459> really<00:02:16.819> offer<00:02:17.030> anything<00:02:17.450> that<00:02:17.900> you

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:18.079 
doesn't really offer anything that you

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:20.770 
doesn't really offer anything that you
can't<00:02:18.379> get<00:02:18.590> from<00:02:18.650> any<00:02:19.099> other<00:02:19.189> hobby<00:02:19.689> you<00:02:20.689> know

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
can't get from any other hobby you know

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.539 
can't get from any other hobby you know
other<00:02:20.989> than<00:02:21.019> of<00:02:21.349> course<00:02:21.409> just<00:02:21.680> that<00:02:22.340> one

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:22.549 
other than of course just that one

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:24.580 
other than of course just that one
action<00:02:22.939> of<00:02:23.090> you<00:02:23.450> know<00:02:23.569> solving<00:02:24.079> Rubik's<00:02:24.379> cubes

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
action of you know solving Rubik's cubes

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.149 
action of you know solving Rubik's cubes
and<00:02:24.769> other<00:02:24.890> puzzles<00:02:25.280> but<00:02:26.590> then<00:02:27.590> I<00:02:27.620> kind<00:02:28.099> of

00:02:28.149 --> 00:02:28.159 
and other puzzles but then I kind of

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:29.710 
and other puzzles but then I kind of
realized<00:02:28.459> something<00:02:28.700> I<00:02:28.819> realized<00:02:29.180> that<00:02:29.299> what

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
realized something I realized that what

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.899 
realized something I realized that what
makes<00:02:29.930> the<00:02:30.109> Cuban<00:02:30.439> community<00:02:30.560> special<00:02:31.310> is<00:02:31.489> the

00:02:31.899 --> 00:02:31.909 
makes the Cuban community special is the

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:33.940 
makes the Cuban community special is the
same<00:02:32.120> thing<00:02:32.299> that<00:02:32.390> makes<00:02:32.629> my<00:02:33.109> home<00:02:33.319> special<00:02:33.799> or

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
same thing that makes my home special or

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.920 
same thing that makes my home special or
my<00:02:34.220> friends<00:02:34.549> special<00:02:34.909> or<00:02:35.000> my<00:02:35.090> family<00:02:35.329> special

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
my friends special or my family special

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.379 
my friends special or my family special
and<00:02:36.159> that's<00:02:37.159> the<00:02:37.280> fact<00:02:37.549> that<00:02:37.730> those<00:02:38.209> things

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:38.389 
and that's the fact that those things

00:02:38.389 --> 00:02:42.339 
and that's the fact that those things
are<00:02:38.540> mine<00:02:38.780> and<00:02:40.090> you<00:02:41.090> know<00:02:41.209> the<00:02:42.019> Cuban

00:02:42.339 --> 00:02:42.349 
are mine and you know the Cuban

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:43.599 
are mine and you know the Cuban
community<00:02:42.439> I<00:02:42.739> think<00:02:42.859> the<00:02:43.129> reason<00:02:43.310> why<00:02:43.549> it

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:43.609 
community I think the reason why it

00:02:43.609 --> 00:02:45.099 
community I think the reason why it
should<00:02:43.790> be<00:02:43.879> spent<00:02:44.150> it<00:02:44.329> should<00:02:44.599> be<00:02:44.659> special<00:02:44.780> to

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:45.109 
should be spent it should be special to

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:47.319 
should be spent it should be special to
each<00:02:45.260> of<00:02:45.439> us<00:02:45.530> is<00:02:45.769> that<00:02:46.250> it<00:02:46.400> belongs<00:02:46.790> to<00:02:47.030> each<00:02:47.180> of

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:47.329 
each of us is that it belongs to each of

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:50.679 
each of us is that it belongs to each of
us<00:02:47.420> and<00:02:48.159> we<00:02:49.159> are<00:02:49.549> all<00:02:49.879> collectively

00:02:50.679 --> 00:02:50.689 
us and we are all collectively

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:53.679 
us and we are all collectively
responsible<00:02:50.959> for<00:02:51.590> it<00:02:51.709> and<00:02:51.889> you<00:02:52.790> know<00:02:53.060> we<00:02:53.480> all

00:02:53.679 --> 00:02:53.689 
responsible for it and you know we all

00:02:53.689 --> 00:02:55.390 
responsible for it and you know we all
are<00:02:54.109> invested<00:02:54.590> in<00:02:54.680> it<00:02:54.799> and<00:02:54.950> we<00:02:55.040> all<00:02:55.159> want<00:02:55.370> to

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
are invested in it and we all want to

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.819 
are invested in it and we all want to
get<00:02:55.519> something<00:02:55.790> out<00:02:55.970> of<00:02:56.030> it<00:02:56.209> and<00:02:56.439> so<00:02:57.439> I<00:02:57.739> think

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:57.829 
get something out of it and so I think

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:00.360 
get something out of it and so I think
that<00:02:58.370> that's<00:02:58.760> a<00:02:59.120> really<00:02:59.419> cool<00:02:59.659> thing<00:02:59.900> because

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
that that's a really cool thing because

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.159 
that that's a really cool thing because
not<00:03:01.370> only<00:03:01.400> is<00:03:01.760> cubing<00:03:02.359> as<00:03:02.569> a<00:03:02.629> whole<00:03:02.930> really

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:03.169 
not only is cubing as a whole really

00:03:03.169 --> 00:03:04.360 
not only is cubing as a whole really
cool<00:03:03.409> thing<00:03:03.590> but<00:03:03.680> it's<00:03:03.799> a<00:03:03.829> really<00:03:03.980> cool<00:03:04.159> thing

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
cool thing but it's a really cool thing

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.099 
cool thing but it's a really cool thing
that<00:03:04.519> we<00:03:04.669> have<00:03:04.909> all<00:03:05.120> come<00:03:05.389> together<00:03:05.569> to<00:03:05.930> create

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:06.109 
that we have all come together to create

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:09.699 
that we have all come together to create
and<00:03:06.609> I<00:03:07.609> think<00:03:08.060> that<00:03:08.209> that<00:03:08.239> is<00:03:08.780> you<00:03:09.409> know<00:03:09.439> what

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
and I think that that is you know what

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:11.199 
and I think that that is you know what
makes<00:03:09.950> all<00:03:10.220> that<00:03:10.400> other<00:03:10.549> great<00:03:10.879> stuff<00:03:11.150> so

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
makes all that other great stuff so

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:13.179 
makes all that other great stuff so
great<00:03:11.750> all<00:03:12.230> you<00:03:12.590> know<00:03:12.680> all<00:03:12.769> that<00:03:12.799> stuff<00:03:12.919> that<00:03:13.069> I

00:03:13.179 --> 00:03:13.189 
great all you know all that stuff that I

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:15.190 
great all you know all that stuff that I
listed<00:03:13.519> before<00:03:13.609> the<00:03:14.000> good<00:03:14.389> attributes<00:03:14.959> of<00:03:15.079> the

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
listed before the good attributes of the

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.719 
listed before the good attributes of the
Cuban<00:03:15.530> community<00:03:15.620> I<00:03:16.040> think<00:03:16.250> that<00:03:16.579> those

00:03:16.719 --> 00:03:16.729 
Cuban community I think that those

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:18.460 
Cuban community I think that those
things<00:03:16.849> are<00:03:17.000> especially<00:03:17.299> good<00:03:17.720> because<00:03:18.319> we

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
things are especially good because we

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:19.869 
things are especially good because we
can<00:03:18.650> come<00:03:18.829> together<00:03:18.949> and<00:03:19.190> say<00:03:19.489> that<00:03:19.669> we

00:03:19.869 --> 00:03:19.879 
can come together and say that we

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:21.219 
can come together and say that we
created<00:03:20.209> this<00:03:20.419> you<00:03:20.900> know<00:03:20.989> and<00:03:21.019> it<00:03:21.199> doesn't

00:03:21.219 --> 00:03:21.229 
created this you know and it doesn't

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:23.589 
created this you know and it doesn't
just<00:03:21.500> belong<00:03:21.889> to<00:03:22.250> you<00:03:22.400> know<00:03:22.519> Felix<00:03:22.970> or<00:03:23.239> and

00:03:23.589 --> 00:03:23.599 
just belong to you know Felix or and

all of us who are truly invested in

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:41.710 
all of us who are truly invested in
cubing<00:03:40.129> really<00:03:40.729> want<00:03:40.879> to<00:03:40.970> see<00:03:41.120> it<00:03:41.209> succeed<00:03:41.359> and

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
and you know I think that that's what

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:48.819 
and you know I think that that's what
makes<00:03:47.329> it<00:03:47.419> special<00:03:47.510> but<00:03:48.169> I<00:03:48.199> think<00:03:48.500> it's<00:03:48.620> a<00:03:48.680> good

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:48.829 
makes it special but I think it's a good

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:51.159 
makes it special but I think it's a good
thing<00:03:49.040> to<00:03:49.190> think<00:03:49.400> about<00:03:49.489> moving<00:03:50.359> forward<00:03:50.540> into

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:51.169 
thing to think about moving forward into

00:03:51.169 --> 00:03:53.979 
thing to think about moving forward into
2015<00:03:51.769> into<00:03:52.400> you<00:03:52.940> know<00:03:53.060> the<00:03:53.090> future<00:03:53.540> of<00:03:53.629> cubing

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:53.989 
2015 into you know the future of cubing

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:55.990 
2015 into you know the future of cubing
when<00:03:54.290> it's<00:03:54.680> really<00:03:54.859> something<00:03:55.069> that's<00:03:55.280> that's

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
when it's really something that's that's

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.819 
when it's really something that's that's
growing<00:03:56.359> very<00:03:56.659> quickly<00:03:56.750> I<00:03:57.260> think<00:03:57.650> it's<00:03:57.739> an

00:03:57.819 --> 00:03:57.829 
growing very quickly I think it's an

00:03:57.829 --> 00:03:59.789 
growing very quickly I think it's an
important<00:03:58.189> thing<00:03:58.280> to<00:03:58.310> think<00:03:58.400> about<00:03:58.669> because

00:03:59.789 --> 00:03:59.799 
important thing to think about because

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:01.899 
important thing to think about because

our role in cubic you know even if

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:06.670 
our role in cubic you know even if
you're<00:04:05.329> you<00:04:05.750> know<00:04:05.780> some<00:04:06.109> guy<00:04:06.229> who<00:04:06.290> no<00:04:06.530> one's

ever heard of who's just sitting at home
solving<00:04:08.689> Rubik's<00:04:08.959> cubes<00:04:09.199> you<00:04:09.349> have<00:04:09.739> a<00:04:09.769> role<00:04:10.009> in

00:04:10.149 --> 00:04:10.159 
solving Rubik's cubes you have a role in

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:11.920 
solving Rubik's cubes you have a role in
the<00:04:10.250> Cuban<00:04:10.549> community<00:04:10.639> and<00:04:11.090> you<00:04:11.329> have<00:04:11.540> some

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 
the Cuban community and you have some

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.140 
the Cuban community and you have some
impact<00:04:12.139> on<00:04:12.500> it<00:04:12.650> and<00:04:12.799> I<00:04:13.669> think<00:04:13.970> that<00:04:14.120> that's

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.150 
impact on it and I think that that's

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:15.849 
impact on it and I think that that's
really<00:04:14.569> cool<00:04:14.870> but<00:04:15.079> also<00:04:15.169> kind<00:04:15.349> of<00:04:15.620> scary

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:15.859 
really cool but also kind of scary

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:18.490 
really cool but also kind of scary
because<00:04:16.359> we<00:04:17.359> are<00:04:17.479> all<00:04:17.659> responsible<00:04:17.780> for<00:04:18.289> the

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
because we are all responsible for the

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.159 
because we are all responsible for the
community<00:04:18.859> and<00:04:18.889> you<00:04:19.639> know<00:04:19.789> we<00:04:20.180> all<00:04:20.450> should

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:21.169 
community and you know we all should

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:22.839 
community and you know we all should
strive<00:04:21.469> to<00:04:21.680> have<00:04:21.769> a<00:04:21.829> positive<00:04:22.070> effect<00:04:22.370> on<00:04:22.729> it

00:04:22.839 --> 00:04:22.849 
strive to have a positive effect on it

00:04:22.849 --> 00:04:24.330 
strive to have a positive effect on it
and<00:04:23.000> so<00:04:23.510> I

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
and so I

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.400 
and so I
think<00:04:24.460> that<00:04:24.610> it's<00:04:24.790> good<00:04:25.000> for<00:04:25.210> all<00:04:25.330> of<00:04:25.360> us<00:04:25.600> you

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
think that it's good for all of us you

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.710 
think that it's good for all of us you
know<00:04:26.530> to<00:04:26.590> think<00:04:26.889> about<00:04:27.130> you<00:04:27.699> know<00:04:27.730> what<00:04:28.389> effect

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
know to think about you know what effect

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.270 
know to think about you know what effect
do<00:04:28.810> I<00:04:28.870> have<00:04:29.199> on<00:04:29.440> the<00:04:29.590> community<00:04:29.710> and<00:04:30.100> I<00:04:30.250> think

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280 
do I have on the community and I think

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.080 
do I have on the community and I think
that<00:04:30.790> if<00:04:31.090> you<00:04:31.600> have<00:04:31.810> a<00:04:31.840> positive<00:04:32.199> effect<00:04:33.090> then

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 
that if you have a positive effect then

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:36.600 
that if you have a positive effect then
you'll<00:04:34.449> feel<00:04:34.570> good<00:04:34.750> about<00:04:34.840> that<00:04:34.960> and<00:04:35.490> you<00:04:36.490> know

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.610 
you'll feel good about that and you know

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.010 
you'll feel good about that and you know
we<00:04:36.850> all<00:04:37.000> want<00:04:37.030> the<00:04:37.360> community<00:04:37.570> to<00:04:37.810> be

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
we all want the community to be

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.150 
we all want the community to be
something<00:04:38.229> that<00:04:38.380> we<00:04:38.650> can<00:04:38.680> feel<00:04:38.949> good<00:04:39.100> about

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.160 
something that we can feel good about

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.670 
something that we can feel good about
and<00:04:39.460> so<00:04:40.150> I<00:04:40.180> think<00:04:40.540> we<00:04:40.780> should<00:04:40.810> all<00:04:41.080> you<00:04:41.380> know<00:04:41.500> be

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 
and so I think we should all you know be

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:42.930 
and so I think we should all you know be
happy<00:04:41.830> about<00:04:42.070> where<00:04:42.220> we<00:04:42.370> are<00:04:42.400> not<00:04:42.639> trying<00:04:42.760> to

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:42.940 
happy about where we are not trying to

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:45.030 
happy about where we are not trying to
say<00:04:43.150> that<00:04:43.180> you<00:04:43.990> know<00:04:44.020> it's<00:04:44.470> in<00:04:44.620> a<00:04:44.680> bad<00:04:44.860> place

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:45.040 
say that you know it's in a bad place

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.060 
say that you know it's in a bad place
but<00:04:45.370> at<00:04:46.300> the<00:04:46.780> same<00:04:46.990> time<00:04:47.229> I<00:04:47.500> think<00:04:47.800> that<00:04:47.919> it's

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.070 
but at the same time I think that it's

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:51.360 
but at the same time I think that it's
good<00:04:48.310> to<00:04:48.720> acknowledge<00:04:49.720> that<00:04:50.229> we<00:04:50.260> all<00:04:50.680> you<00:04:51.340> know
