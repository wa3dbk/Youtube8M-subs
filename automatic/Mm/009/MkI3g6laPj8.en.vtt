 is becoming integrated more in our 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.900
 society even if we are not Americans and 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.840
 I did not want to be less and I wanted to make a 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.180
 video about something terrifying about something 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.560
 Horror

 although she has passed the wick 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.119
 I do not usually be punctual 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.650
 and you also want me to get on the train 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:38.360
 make videos about halloween or something 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:41.450
 so I bring you a list of five 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:44.090
 scary hotels haunted and 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:47.300
 delighted as you want to call the 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:50.210
 world top five according to my opinion according to the 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.890
 opinion of Internet users and researched 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.170
 a little bit and this is what has 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:58.200
 found number 5 black swan 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:01:00.420
 hotel a black swan hotel ' 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.550
 It is a hotel located in the UK- 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.710
 close to stonehenge in the mythical 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.480
 monument people say they see a 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.060
 woman in a white dress go through 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:12.060
 the walls its construction dates from the year 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.010
 1700 32 and is facing a square where 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.410
 they made the gallows where they now dig 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.890
 to people the death penalty of that 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:21.960
 then they were executed there 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.229
 now it's the hotel's events room 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:29.430
 it is said that in its time it was a court 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:31.259
 where the cases of the 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.940
 criminals sentenced to death is 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.619
 say he was sentenced in sentences to 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:38.910
 death and then you had the square and 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:40.259
 go ahead and you could go to mark this 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.690
 It is one of the most haunted hotels 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:46.380
 world famous but let's go to the number 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:49.440
 four the stanley of this hotel that is 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.030
 in colorado usa served as inspiration to 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.710
 stephen king to write his novel the 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.350
 glow and then stanley kubrick 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.390
 to make the film adaptation with 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.730
 protagonist of jack nicholson if not 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.800
 you have seen is a classic of terror 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:04.200
 that this movie is very good 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:07.140
 I recommend to see if you have seen a good 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:11.480

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.480
 in person several paranormal events 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.920
 the hotel is still open but there are some 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:20.200
 rooms that can not be reserved 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.120
 because of his fatal past number 3 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.580
 we have others of the damned in colorado 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.680

 He lives in that hotel the hotel was 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:59.290
 built in 1880 but its history 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:02.770
 changed in 1936 when a child of 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:05.170
 10 years drowned in his pool this 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:06.760
 kid that even today appears to 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.890
 the people who dare to stay 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.320

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.150

 number 2 is a rose hall great 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:19.120
 house in jamaica in montego bay 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:21.340
 if you see the american horror story series 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.049
 in this case they also call it the house 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.670
 of the white witch this mansion located 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:26.830
 in the bay of montego de jamaica was 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.659
 owned by annie palmer a woman 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:30.250
 known for the violent treatment of 

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:32.590
 slaves who worked on his plantation 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:35.260
 it is also said that he murdered his three 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.579
 husbands to inherit their fortune and they are not 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.610
 few who claim that they have seen or 

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:41.500
 prowling the halls of the mansion 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:44.110
 some of his victims and in the first 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:46.239
 place could not miss the hotel cecil de 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:48.579
 the angels so the scenario of several 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:50.829
 violent crimes and some bloody 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:53.230
 suicides one of the most famous cases 

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:54.730
 smooth lamb was a girl 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.819
 I was waiting at the hotel and it appeared 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:59.620
 dead in the drinking water tank that 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:01.480
 has the hotel on the roof before 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.549
 disappear the girl was recorded by a 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:06.790
 elevator security camera and in 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:10.120
 the images appeared she talking to 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:13.060
 an imaginary being something that makes one think 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:15.640
 many people that his death was the cause of 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:19.450
 something paranormal or something demonic is a 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:22.210
 pretty delicate case without solution very 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:25.210
 complicated to understand how it can be 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:27.720
 that someone would have done it because no 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:30.730
 there is evidence there is no indication that 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:33.130
 someone will open the tank the lie 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:35.860
 inside the whole case itself is very strange 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:36.760
 and I leave you in the description a link to a 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:38.530
 video of 2 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:41.580
 I do not know if you know the draw root zhang 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:45.160
 but I hope so because he is a genius of 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:47.440
 of terror of communication of all 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:50.350
 because the truth that his videos fascinate 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:52.870
 So much that I leave a link to a 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:55.060
 his video in which he talks about this case 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:57.910
 of the hotel is and in the case of him and 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:02.009
 Salam in which you will have better because 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:04.169
 is in the first place this one 

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:06.270
 and until here the 5 more hotels 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:07.680
 haunted of the world I do not know if the most 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:10.169
 because there are many places in the world there are 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:14.039
 many hotels but they are very 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:16.139
 known and that are quite scary then 

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:17.879
 you think how can they be if this is a 

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:20.369
 lie of the ghosts stay such 

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:22.919
 Look at the video that I tell you that I leave you 

00:05:20.369 --> 00:05:27.779
 in the description of the hotel cecil de 

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:29.520
 ellis island because you will see the strangeness of 

00:05:27.779 --> 00:05:31.169
 all this and nothing if you liked the 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:32.669

 investigate about each of these 

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:16.229

00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:18.899
