sure we are not too tight we should be

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.340 
sure we are not too tight we should be

around the neck if it's all possible it

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.449 
around the neck if it's all possible it
is<00:02:28.680> very<00:02:28.980> useful<00:02:29.190> to<00:02:30.000> draw<00:02:30.270> a<00:02:30.690> position<00:02:31.380> of<00:02:31.560> the

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
is very useful to draw a position of the

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.290 
is very useful to draw a position of the
ear<00:02:32.640> so<00:02:33.380> we<00:02:34.380> know<00:02:34.590> where<00:02:34.890> it<00:02:35.010> is<00:02:35.310> when<00:02:35.910> it<00:02:36.060> comes

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
ear so we know where it is when it comes

to removing the bandage we can just

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.160 
to removing the bandage we can just
unroll<00:02:40.380> the<00:02:40.560> bandage<00:02:41.120> however<00:02:42.170> should

someone wish to cut through the bandage

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:48.199 
someone wish to cut through the bandage
it<00:02:46.200> is<00:02:46.410> best<00:02:46.680> to<00:02:46.800> know<00:02:47.099> that<00:02:47.580> we<00:02:47.760> will<00:02:47.880> not<00:02:48.060> be

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
it is best to know that we will not be
