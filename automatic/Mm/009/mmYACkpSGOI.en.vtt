00:00:08.689 --> 00:00:11.689
 but it's true that this year it's always fun to play m 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:17.879
 I always knew that several brands the luxury sector stage little more than 

00:00:17.879 --> 00:00:21.170
 third 31 'will control the only canton is present in the fight resumes 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.569
 when everyone is really back in May we are able 

00:00:25.569 --> 00:00:27.819
 the power of change 

00:00:27.819 --> 00:00:33.260
 for sure I think we are happy we are happy to have won tonight 20 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.579
 hours station me personally I have not seen anything yet read 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.410
 coach I think all the round 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.000
 yes it's frustrating because 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.300
 these are mostly ax strikes on this tournament and 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.790
 but maybe we could have done better despite all the rarities 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:51.480
 you are the salt of tonight she is now to us handed over head the 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.000
 head to the place 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.910
 show that song the essentials of rugby b can not 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:57.120
 we can not win a rugby match 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.060
 whatever the team in front 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:00.180
 we would have gone from 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.030
 of this lesson 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.590
 in spite of everything we must make it possible to 

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:07.590
 to take responsibility alone parents need you 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:11.340
 kicking the buttocks but here he was he was there in hand 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.010
 we reacted andré 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.990
 we discussed and close his kamikaze exit 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.420
 they defend 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.400
 if this summer more aggressive than usual it is also the first one 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.570
 first match we knew 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.000
 for this opus attacking opponents close up 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.020
 I got a lot of balloons 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.800
 retirement house 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.950
 what is important for this team there too had come to make me 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.080
 any point of showing them too much 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.720
 while calling not to be allowed 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.850
 I did not follow sure 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:42.740
 maybe moan to emphasize 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.000
 you can bite your fingers for not having lost to italy and the second 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.190
 this is a pity we did this match not there and 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.640
 here we are tonight we did a good part to 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.200
 same terms in the village in two 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.630
 1 always 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.910
 to go ahead but that's a shame 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:03.390
 I think we talk about it since the death of the Italian is still going on 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.360
 meanwhile the left 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.010
 back tonight 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:08.659
 we've all been rotten 

00:02:08.659 --> 00:02:11.139
 satisfied with the remote control 

00:02:11.139 --> 00:02:13.829
 thomas ress lieu de ça from france to the promoters 

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:16.850
 despite the disappointment like italy the public supports 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.290
 last year my senses the players to understand this story that we have 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:21.199
 detention 

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:22.739
 we thank them 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:24.699
 after it's the French victory 

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:27.459
 he was mayor is trying to define this tournament for a good win by a 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:30.609
 great victory against them think of Basel 

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:33.979
 unfortunately in absolute terms of the sea tour 

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:36.739
 At the same time, it has been proved that these recourse to unemployment 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:38.099
 technical 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:40.849
 we could not do great things I hope it will continue 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:43.180
 yet my own think a lot of people
