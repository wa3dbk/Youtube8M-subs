00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 There is a beautiful day to win. 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.899
 I think I would be the wind in the 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.480
 internet this import only you pull 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:13.049
 here towards the eyebrow in the other 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:16.830
 sadina and brings it back into the 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:20.910
 eye and then there's paint that's not so 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.410
 Difficult yes, just put the tips here. 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.760
 Now let's do the other side that does 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:29.630
 same account and I think it was not 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:33.420
 giving too much but never coming back 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:37.350
 And I do not think so much, I do not 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:39.660
 I'm going to continue going on and on and on. 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.309
 one side is thicker than the other 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.590
 Let me not like this one any more 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.649
 side 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:48.360
 to that it joins now the other side 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:52.710
 It's too big, I'm going to throw myself. 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:54.809
 more ado in a bit thick and II 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.100
 I think now this side is a little 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.530
 better than the other, let's try to pack 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.320
 pull a little more thick one more 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:05.040
 little that will stay on guard itself 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:07.320
 Wow, that's the way it is. 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.909
 in my face so much black that has in the 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.950
 my eye 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.490
 My goodness, what I'm doing mine. 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.490
 House 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:19.850
 Look, this is mere black. 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.939
 Hey, what's up, guys? Okay , I 'll wait. 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.009
 Yes 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.770
 You've probably been through this. 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.909
 making a right to be outlined here the 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.100
 another gets bigger 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.390
 There you go and get another one, the other one. 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.159
 gets too thick 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.020
 this will thicken the other and when you 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.320
 Let's see you're looking like members. 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.320
 do kiss 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.600
 and use 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.979
 This is super normal for those who are 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.680
 starting to do the outline already 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:59.170
 I've been through a lot and I know how much 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.850
 stressful you are with the eye you 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:04.750
 I wanted to make a well designed dinho 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:06.880
 cute and leave go a kit what the thigh 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.310
 so I had to show you how 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.200
 I do my sketch that you are going 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.530
 to see that it is a very simple thing to be 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.230
 done is nothing our extraordinary 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:19.780
 but one thing you have to keep in mind 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:22.470
 to do so outlined more more 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:25.780
 well defined set has to practice 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:28.120
 rather no use you follow 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.280
 here my eyeliner has already seen the video of 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.630
 Gabes, now I'm going home. I'll go. 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.230
 get this thing 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:37.360
 I'm going to open it here, I'm going to crack it 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:41.410
 and readiness people being born with luciano 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:44.170
 I train outlined since my 12 13 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:46.360
 years and the first time I did I see 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.980
 Leave a photo here to see if the 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.470
 photo do not have to is because I did not find 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.510
 but people is was a tragedy that he of 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.799
 nothing and I thought it was beautiful because 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.540
 It was the first time I had done 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:57.760
 So in my head I'll say that I 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.970
 I thought that I was devastating that I 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:03.610
 I was a girl but I really was not 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:07.000
 so have a little patience with the 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:08.530
 eyeliner training at home and use the tips 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.840
 What am I going to give you here that I have? 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.090
 sure that you will achieve then 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:16.000
 Do you want to learn how to do this? 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:18.370
 outlined cat's legend is only dream 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.640
 keep watching the video and come 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:23.920
 with me I'll use two eyeliners 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.860
 the first will be if in pen that is of the 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.320
 avon 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:29.090
 and this second is a liquid eyeliner 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:33.200
 of the art maker 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:35.480
 he is super black and pigmented this 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.120
 pair of coaches that I love, you see. 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.630
 this line that I'm crossing there in the 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:43.400
 end of the eye toward the eyebrow 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:45.770
 It's going to be this line that we're going to 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:48.050
 plot to get the outlined people 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:50.330
 Go get the eyeliner pen that is 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:52.850
 easier to handle because we have already 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:55.190
 is accustomed to handling a pen 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:58.360
 so it's just people make that mark on 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:58.360
 direction to the eyebrow 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:09.219
 So now it's just people pulling 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:11.909
 pointed into the eye doing as 

00:04:09.219 --> 00:04:11.909
 if it were a 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:23.159
 now just do the same thing in the other 

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:25.740
 eye and now I'll get the eyeliner 

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:28.229
 liquid and will take away too much of the 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:31.050
 point of it now I go and filling 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:33.599
 This is what I did with the pen. 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:35.909
 eyeliner because it does not make the eyeliner 

00:04:33.599 --> 00:04:38.280
 whole with the pen because that pen 

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:40.740
 not very limited so it would be 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.389
 too failed and not much then would last 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.520
 that's why I pass the eyeliner 

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:47.400
 liquid over there, it's just you and 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:50.159
 drawing over the eyeliner in 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:52.560
 pen calmly will not want to do 

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:54.960
 a delineated kitten outline with 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:56.879
 late hurry why are you going? 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.219
 get all loaded then slowly 

00:04:56.879 --> 00:05:02.909
 You'll be filling in a good tip too. 

00:04:59.219 --> 00:05:05.580
 faces one side of the eyeliner lying down 

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:08.099
 because it makes a straight line and 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:11.129
 does not get shaky and is firmer too 

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:13.860
 To do that, it's only there that you join the 

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:16.500
 tip calmly while doing little 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:20.279
 always remembering that the delegate must 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:23.069
 start thick and finish fine a great 

00:05:20.279 --> 00:05:25.830
 tip is also you always support your 

00:05:23.069 --> 00:05:28.259
 elbow on a flat surface because 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:31.020
 it gives you a lot more structure for you 

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:32.940
 able to do the outline and amon 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:34.289
 trembling, she gets very firm because it's 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:36.710
 make you shine you need a good 

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:36.710
 movie 

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:46.310
 and now just repeat the same process in the 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:49.320
 another eye 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:51.150
 This is how it got people now it's just for 

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:52.860
 give an end round I'll get one 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:55.860
 cotton swab with a 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:58.229
 and I'm doing well at the tip of the 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:02.310
 eyeliner is passing current to 

00:05:58.229 --> 00:06:05.240
 make a straight line and the same thing 

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:05.240
 in both eyes 

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:12.530
 and now to give the final closing I go 

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:14.870
 to pass but face to face with a lot of mask 

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:16.730
 for eyelashes because the mask 

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:19.460
 it seems that more groups 

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:21.980
 beautiful but flying and do not forget the mind 

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:25.660
 pass the mask on the lower lashes and 

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:25.660
 It's ready, people, only this. 

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:38.040
 Have you guys any questions? 

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:40.110

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:41.669
