00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:14.389 
splice and repair somebody sent to me

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:17.560 
splice and repair somebody sent to me
and<00:00:14.599> you<00:00:14.719> can<00:00:14.870> see<00:00:15.789> that's<00:00:16.789> pretty<00:00:17.210> worn

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:17.570 
and you can see that's pretty worn

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.460 
and you can see that's pretty worn
that's<00:00:18.380> not<00:00:18.740> quite<00:00:19.099> to<00:00:19.520> the<00:00:19.610> 25%<00:00:20.360> of<00:00:20.720> a

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:21.470 
that's not quite to the 25% of a

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:29.019 
rope volume to warrant to put it out of
service<00:00:27.320> but<00:00:27.710> it<00:00:27.829> is<00:00:27.980> pretty<00:00:28.250> worn<00:00:28.520> I<00:00:28.640> suggest

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:29.029 
service but it is pretty worn I suggest

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:33.310 
service but it is pretty worn I suggest
to<00:00:29.119> the<00:00:29.240> place<00:00:29.449> up<00:00:29.919> 25%<00:00:30.919> D<00:00:31.430> rating<00:00:31.700> on<00:00:31.790> the<00:00:32.320> the

to the place up 25% D rating on the the

00:00:35.979 --> 00:00:35.989 
new minimum straight to this line just

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:40.569 
new minimum straight to this line just
to<00:00:36.079> be<00:00:36.200> safe<00:00:36.969> and<00:00:37.969> it<00:00:38.420> can<00:00:38.540> also<00:00:38.719> see<00:00:39.579> that

00:00:40.569 --> 00:00:40.579 
to be safe and it can also see that

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:43.500 
to be safe and it can also see that
these<00:00:40.820> synthetic<00:00:41.120> lines<00:00:41.629> like<00:00:42.500> to<00:00:42.620> take<00:00:42.800> a<00:00:42.829> set

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:43.510 
these synthetic lines like to take a set

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.050 
these synthetic lines like to take a set
you<00:00:44.510> see<00:00:44.719> how<00:00:44.840> flat<00:00:45.050> that<00:00:45.379> is<00:00:45.820> there's<00:00:46.820> nothing

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:47.060 
you see how flat that is there's nothing

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:48.400 
you see how flat that is there's nothing
wrong<00:00:47.180> with<00:00:47.270> that<00:00:47.390> that<00:00:47.600> doesn't<00:00:47.810> grow<00:00:48.200> the

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.730 
grade the line at all that's just

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.180 
grade the line at all that's just
because<00:00:50.000> it's<00:00:50.150> hollow<00:00:50.420> coronal<00:00:51.050> they<00:00:52.010> don't

around and um you can tell this was the
wind<00:00:59.899> side<00:01:01.840> as<00:01:02.920> these<00:01:03.920> synthetic<00:01:04.399> fibers<00:01:05.200> get

wind side as these synthetic fibers get
put<00:01:06.439> under<00:01:06.560> load<00:01:06.920> they'll<00:01:07.700> get<00:01:07.850> a<00:01:07.880> sheen<00:01:08.210> on

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
put under load they'll get a sheen on

put under load they'll get a sheen on
them<00:01:08.659> that<00:01:09.049> almost<00:01:09.409> seems<00:01:09.649> like<00:01:09.740> it's<00:01:10.040> glazed

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
or that it's melted it's not that's just

the<00:01:13.579> way<00:01:13.729> the<00:01:13.850> fiber<00:01:14.090> is<00:01:14.299> if<00:01:14.479> you<00:01:14.600> work<00:01:14.810> this

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
the way the fiber is if you work this

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.109 
the way the fiber is if you work this
back<00:01:15.229> and<00:01:15.380> forth<00:01:15.469> it<00:01:16.340> will<00:01:16.490> go<00:01:16.610> right<00:01:16.850> back<00:01:16.909> to

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119 
back and forth it will go right back to

little bit of a little bit of wear right

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.870 
little bit of a little bit of wear right
there<00:01:36.979> but<00:01:37.159> nothing<00:01:37.430> to<00:01:37.549> worry<00:01:37.700> about<00:01:39.760> so<00:01:40.760> if

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
there but nothing to worry about so if

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.100 
there but nothing to worry about so if
your<00:01:41.030> ropes<00:01:41.270> starting<00:01:41.570> to<00:01:41.630> look<00:01:41.750> like<00:01:41.930> this

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
your ropes starting to look like this

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.770 
your ropes starting to look like this
and<00:01:42.380> you're<00:01:42.920> getting<00:01:43.070> close<00:01:43.630> getting<00:01:44.630> close

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
and you're getting close getting close

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.480 
and you're getting close getting close
to<00:01:44.900> the<00:01:44.990> one<00:01:45.229> to<00:01:45.380> think<00:01:45.590> about<00:01:45.799> replacing<00:01:45.979> it

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
to the one to think about replacing it

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.950 
to the one to think about replacing it
or<00:01:47.180> maybe<00:01:47.479> just<00:01:47.630> buying<00:01:48.049> enough<00:01:49.960> just

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
or maybe just buying enough just

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.440 
or maybe just buying enough just
removing<00:01:51.320> the<00:01:51.740> you<00:01:52.490> know<00:01:52.580> the<00:01:52.880> bad<00:01:53.030> section

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
removing the you know the bad section

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.060 
removing the you know the bad section
out<00:01:53.600> of<00:01:53.689> the<00:01:53.750> line<00:01:53.930> maybe<00:01:54.170> buying<00:01:54.530> if<00:01:54.890> you've

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
out of the line maybe buying if you've

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.039 
out of the line maybe buying if you've
got<00:01:55.220> 100<00:01:55.520> foot<00:01:55.700> lining<00:01:56.150> you<00:01:56.659> know<00:01:56.780> the<00:01:56.869> first

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:57.049 
got 100 foot lining you know the first

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:59.560 
got 100 foot lining you know the first
50<00:01:57.470> foot<00:01:57.680> is<00:01:57.799> worn<00:01:58.100> out<00:01:58.250> they're<00:01:59.150> starting<00:01:59.390> to

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
50 foot is worn out they're starting to

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:01.270 
50 foot is worn out they're starting to
look<00:01:59.689> like<00:01:59.869> this<00:02:00.080> you<00:02:00.140> know<00:02:00.380> buy<00:02:00.619> another<00:02:00.920> 50

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
look like this you know buy another 50

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.940 
look like this you know buy another 50
foot<00:02:01.460> of<00:02:01.580> line<00:02:01.729> and<00:02:02.030> just<00:02:02.200> you<00:02:03.200> know<00:02:03.320> Enver<00:02:03.710> and

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
foot of line and just you know Enver and

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.399 
foot of line and just you know Enver and
splice<00:02:04.250> it<00:02:04.460> back<00:02:04.580> together<00:02:05.110> there's<00:02:06.110> this

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:06.409 
splice it back together there's this

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:08.109 
splice it back together there's this

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:20.269 
this does add some bulk to the line of

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:22.000 
this does add some bulk to the line of
only<00:02:20.510> four

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
only four

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.770 
only four
only<00:02:23.010> for<00:02:23.250> about<00:02:23.340> four<00:02:23.880> or<00:02:23.910> five<00:02:24.180> for<00:02:24.450> the<00:02:24.540> line

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
only for about four or five for the line

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.960 
only for about four or five for the line
and<00:02:25.080> then<00:02:25.290> you're<00:02:25.440> right<00:02:25.620> back<00:02:25.800> to<00:02:25.830> the<00:02:26.760> normal

and then you're right back to the normal

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.930 
and then you're right back to the normal
diameter<00:02:28.160> so<00:02:29.160> just<00:02:29.370> something<00:02:29.610> else<00:02:29.700> to<00:02:29.790> think
