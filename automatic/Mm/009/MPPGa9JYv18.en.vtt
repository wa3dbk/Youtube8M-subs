00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 the honda nc700x is without a doubt the 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 engine with the best 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.930
 value for money 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:11.269
 he is the tourist brother of the 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.269
 what sportier nc 700 s 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.090
 the x has a full bowl with in 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.580
 adjustable in height and wider 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.110
 higher steering wheel and the sitting position nasty 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.550
 is therefore more relaxed on the motorcycle 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:32.880
 so you can fill it up a little longer 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.400
 Then keep on tsn at the nc700x you can 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.420
 choose a fully automatic 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.760
 dct gearbox 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.320
 The t this is no ordinary vending machine 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.180
 a normal gearbox that 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.850
 you can switch automatically 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.280
 choose from an economy switching behavior 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.750
 and a sporty setting but if you 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.070
 you can also switch by yourself 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.199
 two flippers on the handlebars 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.570
 linking happens always 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.830
 done is a special system that you 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.159
 really should give it a try 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:00.809
 But whether you have a 700 x with DCT or with 

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:02.250
 have a normal gearbox 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.140
 in both cases you have a 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.670
 very economical power source luckily there 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.049
 also sufficient for taller drivers 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.909
 room for the legs 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.490
 the top power is modest but 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.720
 couple impressively at the bottom 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.490
 you can easily do with little speed 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.180
 drive and that is very beneficial for the 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.400
 Fuel consumption 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.990
 switching could be better but 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.470
 nothing else on the power source 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.240
 to notice 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.159
 That also applies to driving behavior 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.840
 weight is low the sitting position ensures 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.550
 much control and overview and the 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.110
 seat height is slightly larger than with the 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.160
 seven to the rest thanks to the longer 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.260
 ferry travel 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.430
 that means more ground clearance and also 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.380
 more comfort 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.690
 without affecting the steering precision and the 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.370
 stability it suffers 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.020
 ease of driving is amazing 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:40.800
 the combined running with abs do it 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.060
 good 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.340
 only the rev counter is bad 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.810
 readable, so you just shoot something 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.100
 too easy in the speed limiter if 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.470
 you have to hurry 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.450
 the nc700x is not exciting and exciting 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.650
 but dull and boring he is 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.150
 certainly not 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:55.740
 it is a very wise motorcycle 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.510
 who does almost nothing wrong and that 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.530
 delivers a lot of fun and me 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:02.120
 was little money 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.120
 this honda is available in four colors
