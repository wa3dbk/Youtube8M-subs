has<00:02:15.110> eight<00:02:15.290> gigs<00:02:15.440> of<00:02:15.620> RAM<00:02:15.830> I<00:02:15.860> think<00:02:16.159> that's

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
has eight gigs of RAM I think that's

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.220 
has eight gigs of RAM I think that's
pretty<00:02:16.459> generous<00:02:16.700> and<00:02:17.060> the<00:02:17.299> SSD<00:02:17.750> in<00:02:17.870> here<00:02:18.110> is

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
pretty generous and the SSD in here is

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.399 
pretty generous and the SSD in here is
very<00:02:18.580> snappy<00:02:19.580> very<00:02:19.970> responsive<00:02:20.599> but<00:02:20.930> does<00:02:21.170> tap

00:02:21.399 --> 00:02:21.409 
very snappy very responsive but does tap

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:24.940 
very snappy very responsive but does tap
out<00:02:21.620> at<00:02:21.830> a<00:02:21.860> kind<00:02:22.190> of<00:02:22.280> meager<00:02:22.670> 256<00:02:23.739> gigabytes<00:02:24.739> I

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
out at a kind of meager 256 gigabytes I

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.320 
out at a kind of meager 256 gigabytes I
guess<00:02:25.190> that's<00:02:25.310> that's<00:02:25.819> because<00:02:26.000> of<00:02:26.120> the<00:02:26.180> price

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
guess that's that's because of the price

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.690 
guess that's that's because of the price
so<00:02:26.510> the<00:02:26.599> pros<00:02:26.840> and<00:02:26.870> the<00:02:27.140> cons<00:02:27.200> on<00:02:27.709> the<00:02:28.250> pro<00:02:28.459> side

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
so the pros and the cons on the pro side

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.660 
so the pros and the cons on the pro side
it's<00:02:29.060> the<00:02:29.780> least<00:02:29.989> expensive<00:02:30.530> good<00:02:31.220> looking

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
it's the least expensive good looking
