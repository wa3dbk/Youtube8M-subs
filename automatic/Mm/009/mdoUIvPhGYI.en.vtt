talking about earlier so it's just it's

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.980 
talking about earlier so it's just it's
a<00:01:59.460> very<00:01:59.820> rewarding<00:02:00.270> and<00:02:00.780> fulfilling

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
percent of the game I mean there's still

so<00:02:12.180> much<00:02:12.330> more<00:02:12.540> for<00:02:12.690> me<00:02:12.810> to<00:02:12.900> take

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
so much more for me to take

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.490 
so much more for me to take
it<00:02:13.280> so<00:02:13.580> it's<00:02:13.730> it's<00:02:14.540> the<00:02:14.690> level<00:02:14.990> of<00:02:15.050> quality<00:02:15.410> and

it so it's it's the level of quality and

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.140 
it so it's it's the level of quality and
it's<00:02:15.770> the<00:02:15.890> amount<00:02:16.190> of<00:02:16.280> time<00:02:16.550> that<00:02:16.580> you<00:02:16.850> get<00:02:16.970> to

I<00:02:30.740> remember<00:02:31.490> I<00:02:31.670> really<00:02:32.030> like<00:02:32.180> that<00:02:32.390> game<00:02:32.660> but

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
I remember I really like that game but

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.020 
I remember I really like that game but
the<00:02:33.440> problem<00:02:34.040> I<00:02:34.190> had<00:02:34.430> maybe<00:02:34.670> it<00:02:34.760> wasn't<00:02:34.880> a

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
the problem I had maybe it wasn't a

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.550 
the problem I had maybe it wasn't a
problem<00:02:35.330> but<00:02:35.600> just<00:02:35.810> something<00:02:36.080> I<00:02:36.170> wasn't

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
problem but just something I wasn't

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.030 
problem but just something I wasn't
totally<00:02:37.660> into<00:02:38.660> was<00:02:39.050> the<00:02:39.170> fact<00:02:39.470> that<00:02:39.650> the<00:02:39.830> game

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
totally into was the fact that the game

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.120 
totally into was the fact that the game
took<00:02:40.310> these<00:02:40.520> really<00:02:41.030> long<00:02:41.740> cutscene<00:02:42.740> breaks

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
took these really long cutscene breaks

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.460 
took these really long cutscene breaks
that<00:02:43.460> kind<00:02:43.850> of<00:02:44.030> you<00:02:44.570> know<00:02:44.600> disrupted<00:02:45.320> the<00:02:45.440> flow

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
that kind of you know disrupted the flow

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.310 
that kind of you know disrupted the flow
of<00:02:45.710> the<00:02:45.890> game<00:02:46.040> how<00:02:46.880> is<00:02:47.210> that<00:02:47.320> narrative

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
of the game how is that narrative

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.030 
of the game how is that narrative
storytelling<00:02:48.860> addressed<00:02:49.610> in<00:02:49.850> a<00:02:50.270> phantom<00:02:50.810> pain

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
storytelling addressed in a phantom pain

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.410 
storytelling addressed in a phantom pain
there<00:02:52.040> are<00:02:52.190> still<00:02:52.400> plenty<00:02:52.520> of<00:02:52.700> cutscenes<00:02:53.090> but

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
there are still plenty of cutscenes but

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.360 
there are still plenty of cutscenes but
they<00:02:53.780> are<00:02:53.900> not<00:02:54.080> as<00:02:54.320> long<00:02:54.590> and<00:02:54.890> drawn<00:02:55.130> out<00:02:55.160> and

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
they are not as long and drawn out and

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.520

solid<00:03:52.370> four<00:03:52.790> that<00:03:53.690> story<00:03:54.410> because<00:03:54.560> that<00:03:54.890> was

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
solid four that story because that was

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.620 
solid four that story because that was
built<00:03:55.250> off<00:03:55.400> a<00:03:55.430> lot<00:03:55.730> of<00:03:55.850> history<00:03:56.150> and<00:03:56.390> this<00:03:56.450> game

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:56.630 
built off a lot of history and this game

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:58.870 
built off a lot of history and this game
has<00:03:56.870> that<00:03:57.110> going<00:03:57.860> into<00:03:57.980> it<00:03:58.070> as<00:03:58.220> well<00:03:58.400> but<00:03:58.760> it's

00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:58.880 
has that going into it as well but it's

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.699 
has that going into it as well but it's
also<00:03:59.060> a<00:03:59.209> really<00:03:59.570> good<00:03:59.720> self-contained<00:04:00.470> story

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
also a really good self-contained story

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:03.699 
also a really good self-contained story
so<00:04:01.640> the<00:04:02.540> cuts<00:04:02.750> these<00:04:02.900> aren't<00:04:03.110> as<00:04:03.200> long<00:04:03.410> and

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:03.709 
so the cuts these aren't as long and

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:05.229 
so the cuts these aren't as long and
they're<00:04:03.890> better<00:04:04.190> yeah<00:04:04.820> that<00:04:05.030> was<00:04:05.120> a<00:04:05.150> big

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:05.239 
they're better yeah that was a big

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:07.500 
they're better yeah that was a big
concern<00:04:05.900> i<00:04:05.959> also<00:04:06.170> had<00:04:06.440> was<00:04:06.620> like<00:04:06.739> you<00:04:06.800> know<00:04:07.310> I

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
concern i also had was like you know I

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:10.300 
concern i also had was like you know I
the<00:04:08.510> epic<00:04:09.170> storytelling<00:04:09.560> is<00:04:10.070> almost

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
the epic storytelling is almost

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:12.820 
the epic storytelling is almost
overwhelming<00:04:10.730> in<00:04:11.390> Metal<00:04:11.750> Gear<00:04:11.780> Solid<00:04:12.110> 4<00:04:12.530> and

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:12.830 
overwhelming in Metal Gear Solid 4 and

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:14.770 
overwhelming in Metal Gear Solid 4 and
it<00:04:12.920> sounds<00:04:13.310> like<00:04:13.340> judging<00:04:13.760> from<00:04:14.030> your<00:04:14.090> review

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
it sounds like judging from your review

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:19.570 
it sounds like judging from your review
that<00:04:15.680> in<00:04:16.040> five<00:04:17.049> it's<00:04:18.049> may<00:04:18.440> be<00:04:18.500> broken<00:04:19.100> down<00:04:19.130> in

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:19.580 
that in five it's may be broken down in

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:22.450 
that in five it's may be broken down in
a<00:04:19.730> more<00:04:20.000> sort<00:04:20.540> of<00:04:20.660> cohesive<00:04:21.380> manner<00:04:21.620> so<00:04:22.039> you're

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.460 
a more sort of cohesive manner so you're

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.190 
a more sort of cohesive manner so you're
definitely<00:04:22.729> you<00:04:23.419> know<00:04:23.539> reinforcing<00:04:24.169> that

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:24.200 
definitely you know reinforcing that

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:25.690 
definitely you know reinforcing that
you're<00:04:24.440> saying<00:04:24.680> this<00:04:25.039> is<00:04:25.250> something<00:04:25.550> that

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:25.700 
you're saying this is something that

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.010 
you're saying this is something that
most<00:04:26.180> people<00:04:26.360> will<00:04:26.630> be<00:04:26.750> able<00:04:26.810> to

most people will be able to

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.920 
most people will be able to
understand<00:04:27.370> yeah<00:04:28.370> it<00:04:28.669> doesn't<00:04:29.210> the<00:04:29.750> game

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:20.649 
gameplay is much more complex than past
games<00:05:18.919> in<00:05:19.099> the<00:05:19.190> series<00:05:19.400> and<00:05:19.759> the<00:05:20.270> controls

00:05:20.649 --> 00:05:20.659 
games in the series and the controls

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:21.879 
games in the series and the controls
definitely<00:05:21.050> take<00:05:21.169> some<00:05:21.319> getting<00:05:21.530> used<00:05:21.710> to<00:05:21.860> but

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:21.889 
definitely take some getting used to but

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:23.290 
definitely take some getting used to but
from<00:05:22.219> a<00:05:22.280> narrative<00:05:22.520> standpoint<00:05:22.819> I<00:05:23.270> think

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:23.300 
from a narrative standpoint I think

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:25.540 
from a narrative standpoint I think
newcomers<00:05:24.050> will<00:05:24.229> be<00:05:24.380> right<00:05:24.560> home<00:05:24.710> so<00:05:25.129> gameplay

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:25.550 
newcomers will be right home so gameplay

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:27.309 
newcomers will be right home so gameplay
wise<00:05:25.789> what<00:05:26.240> exactly<00:05:26.719> is<00:05:26.810> different<00:05:27.199> because

00:05:27.309 --> 00:05:27.319 
wise what exactly is different because

00:05:27.319 --> 00:05:30.219 
wise what exactly is different because
you<00:05:27.770> know<00:05:27.860> I<00:05:27.889> read<00:05:28.099> your<00:05:28.250> full<00:05:28.460> review<00:05:29.229> there's

00:05:30.219 --> 00:05:30.229 
you know I read your full review there's

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:33.010 
you know I read your full review there's
a<00:05:30.289> lot<00:05:30.560> of<00:05:30.590> its<00:05:31.219> open<00:05:31.550> world<00:05:31.759> essentially<00:05:32.270> yet

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:33.020 
a lot of its open world essentially yet

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:35.439 
a lot of its open world essentially yet
you<00:05:33.199> something<00:05:33.650> metal<00:05:34.400> gear<00:05:34.669> loyalists

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:35.449 
you something metal gear loyalists

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:37.390 
you something metal gear loyalists
probably<00:05:35.719> aren't<00:05:35.900> totally<00:05:36.500> used<00:05:36.830> to<00:05:36.949> in<00:05:37.099> in

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:37.400 
probably aren't totally used to in in

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.550 
probably aren't totally used to in in
the<00:05:37.550> realm<00:05:37.759> of<00:05:37.880> that<00:05:38.090> universe<00:05:38.599> how<00:05:39.349> does<00:05:39.530> that

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:39.560 
the realm of that universe how does that

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:42.640 
the realm of that universe how does that
play<00:05:39.919> out<00:05:40.240> well<00:05:41.240> it<00:05:41.360> definitely<00:05:41.509> changes<00:05:42.020> how

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:42.650 
play out well it definitely changes how

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:44.709 
play out well it definitely changes how
you<00:05:42.710> approach<00:05:43.069> a<00:05:43.190> mission<00:05:43.490> because<00:05:43.819> now<00:05:44.300> you

00:05:44.709 --> 00:05:44.719 
you approach a mission because now you

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:46.839 
you approach a mission because now you
know<00:05:44.750> threats<00:05:45.199> can<00:05:45.409> come<00:05:45.469> from<00:05:45.919> any<00:05:46.099> angle<00:05:46.310> and

00:05:46.839 --> 00:05:46.849 
know threats can come from any angle and

00:05:46.849 --> 00:05:48.999 
know threats can come from any angle and
it<00:05:46.969> could<00:05:47.150> before<00:05:47.539> but<00:05:48.289> the<00:05:48.500> thing<00:05:48.680> is<00:05:48.710> they're

00:05:48.999 --> 00:05:49.009 
it could before but the thing is they're

00:05:49.009 --> 00:05:51.730 
it could before but the thing is they're
vector<00:05:49.430> might<00:05:49.639> begin<00:05:49.819> a<00:05:50.270> mile<00:05:50.750> away<00:05:50.990> like<00:05:51.289> a

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:51.740 
vector might begin a mile away like a

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:54.390 
vector might begin a mile away like a
wild<00:05:52.520> animal<00:05:52.669> can<00:05:53.120> disrupt<00:05:53.539> your<00:05:53.719> mission

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:54.400 
wild animal can disrupt your mission

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.890 
wild animal can disrupt your mission
