seed starting kit is something I put

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.580 
seed starting kit is something I put
together<00:00:17.550> because<00:00:18.510> it's<00:00:18.660> useful<00:00:19.109> to<00:00:19.289> me<00:00:19.439> it

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
together because it's useful to me it

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.720 
together because it's useful to me it
will<00:00:19.740> start<00:00:20.100> 80<00:00:20.820> to<00:00:21.320> 100<00:00:22.320> seeds<00:00:22.710> a<00:00:23.010> little<00:00:23.580> bit

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
will start 80 to 100 seeds a little bit
