actually<00:01:48.750> creepy<00:01:49.229> and<00:01:49.500> I<00:01:49.950> can't<00:01:50.369> even<00:01:50.460> watch

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
actually creepy and I can't even watch

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.609 
actually creepy and I can't even watch
the<00:01:51.000> intro<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.420> intro<00:01:51.630> just<00:01:52.170> freaks<00:01:52.439> me<00:01:52.530> out

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
the intro the intro just freaks me out

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:53.810 
the intro the intro just freaks me out
so<00:01:52.799> I<00:01:52.860> have<00:01:52.979> to<00:01:53.100> fast-forward<00:01:53.369> through<00:01:53.700> that

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
so I have to fast-forward through that

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.240 
so I have to fast-forward through that
part<00:01:54.060> but<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.659> show<00:01:54.840> itself<00:01:55.170> is<00:01:55.500> super<00:01:56.039> good

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
part but the show itself is super good

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.870 
part but the show itself is super good
and<00:01:57.080> everything<00:01:58.080> is<00:01:58.229> so<00:01:58.440> morbid<00:01:59.159> and<00:01:59.340> twisted

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
and everything is so morbid and twisted

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.880 
and everything is so morbid and twisted
and<00:02:00.210> I<00:02:00.420> just<00:02:00.750> can't<00:02:00.899> even<00:02:00.960> believe<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.680> stuff

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
and I just can't even believe the stuff

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.410 
and I just can't even believe the stuff
that<00:02:02.070> they<00:02:02.159> are<00:02:02.220> allowed<00:02:02.399> to<00:02:02.430> put<00:02:02.640> on<00:02:02.759> TV<00:02:02.939> and<00:02:03.299> I

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
that they are allowed to put on TV and I

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.359 
that they are allowed to put on TV and I
didn't<00:02:03.689> really<00:02:03.720> start<00:02:04.110> getting<00:02:04.200> into<00:02:04.830> the

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
didn't really start getting into the

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.670 
didn't really start getting into the
show<00:02:05.610> until<00:02:05.880> after<00:02:06.330> the<00:02:06.450> second<00:02:06.810> episode<00:02:06.899> the

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
show until after the second episode the

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.259 
show until after the second episode the
second<00:02:08.009> episode<00:02:08.099> is<00:02:08.489> where<00:02:08.700> I<00:02:08.729> realized<00:02:09.030> like

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:09.269 
second episode is where I realized like

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:11.809 
second episode is where I realized like
it's<00:02:09.569> actually<00:02:10.110> creepy<00:02:10.560> and<00:02:10.860> I<00:02:11.519> don't<00:02:11.730> know<00:02:11.790> I

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
it's actually creepy and I don't know I

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.670 
it's actually creepy and I don't know I
just<00:02:11.910> think<00:02:12.150> it's<00:02:12.330> really<00:02:12.420> good<00:02:12.720> so<00:02:13.080> I've<00:02:13.500> been

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
just think it's really good so I've been

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.350 
just think it's really good so I've been
watching<00:02:14.010> that<00:02:14.190> and<00:02:14.370> I<00:02:14.519> also<00:02:14.550> started<00:02:15.030> the

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
watching that and I also started the

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.930 
watching that and I also started the
second<00:02:15.930> season<00:02:15.959> which<00:02:16.830> is<00:02:17.040> the<00:02:17.250> asylum<00:02:17.760> one

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
second season which is the asylum one

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.030 
second season which is the asylum one
and<00:02:18.209> I<00:02:18.540> think<00:02:19.110> I<00:02:19.170> like<00:02:19.350> that<00:02:19.410> one<00:02:19.680> even<00:02:20.010> more

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
and I think I like that one even more

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.740 
and I think I like that one even more
what's<00:02:20.549> interesting<00:02:20.730> is<00:02:21.209> that<00:02:21.239> they<00:02:21.510> don't

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
what's interesting is that they don't

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.509 
what's interesting is that they don't
use<00:02:22.019> the<00:02:22.350> same<00:02:22.590> characters<00:02:23.130> from<00:02:23.370> the

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
use the same characters from the

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:25.309 
use the same characters from the
previous<00:02:23.910> season<00:02:24.030> it's<00:02:24.360> not<00:02:24.420> a<00:02:24.540> continuation

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
previous season it's not a continuation

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.530 
previous season it's not a continuation
it's<00:02:26.010> a<00:02:26.100> completely<00:02:26.610> different<00:02:26.850> story<00:02:27.120> line

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
it's a completely different story line

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.590 
it's a completely different story line
they<00:02:28.110> have<00:02:28.350> a<00:02:29.130> few<00:02:29.760> of<00:02:29.850> the<00:02:29.910> same<00:02:30.090> actors<00:02:30.480> from

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
they have a few of the same actors from

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.509 
they have a few of the same actors from
the<00:02:30.780> first<00:02:31.049> season<00:02:31.230> but<00:02:31.739> they<00:02:31.950> play<00:02:32.130> different

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519 
the first season but they play different

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:34.580 
the first season but they play different
characters<00:02:32.670> so<00:02:33.150> it<00:02:33.480> has<00:02:33.959> nothing<00:02:34.170> to<00:02:34.380> do<00:02:34.500> with

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
characters so it has nothing to do with

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:35.870 
characters so it has nothing to do with
the<00:02:34.680> first<00:02:34.860> season<00:02:35.040> and<00:02:35.370> I<00:02:35.430> think<00:02:35.640> that's<00:02:35.760> why

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
the first season and I think that's why

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.809 
the first season and I think that's why
some<00:02:36.150> people<00:02:36.920> stopped<00:02:37.920> washing<00:02:38.160> it<00:02:38.459> after<00:02:38.700> the

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
some people stopped washing it after the

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:40.460 
some people stopped washing it after the
first<00:02:38.970> season<00:02:39.120> because<00:02:39.480> the<00:02:40.019> second<00:02:40.350> season

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
first season because the second season

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.470 
first season because the second season
had<00:02:40.920> nothing<00:02:41.340> to<00:02:41.400> do<00:02:41.519> with<00:02:41.610> the<00:02:41.700> first<00:02:41.940> but<00:02:42.269> I

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
had nothing to do with the first but I

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.930 
had nothing to do with the first but I
really<00:02:43.290> like<00:02:43.500> it<00:02:43.709> I<00:02:43.920> think<00:02:44.310> I<00:02:44.400> like<00:02:44.549> the<00:02:44.640> second

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
really like it I think I like the second

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.180 
really like it I think I like the second
season<00:02:45.060> more<00:02:45.480> Evan<00:02:46.049> Peters<00:02:46.290> isn't<00:02:46.799> it<00:02:46.920> and

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
season more Evan Peters isn't it and

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.800 
season more Evan Peters isn't it and
he's<00:02:47.400> one<00:02:47.670> of<00:02:47.700> the<00:02:47.820> main<00:02:48.000> characters<00:02:48.239> and<00:02:48.720> he's

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
he's one of the main characters and he's

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.069 
he's one of the main characters and he's
so<00:02:49.109> cute<00:02:49.560> it<00:02:50.549> was<00:02:50.730> really<00:02:51.060> weird<00:02:51.420> is<00:02:51.690> that<00:02:51.720> the

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:52.079 
so cute it was really weird is that the

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:53.990 
so cute it was really weird is that the
guys<00:02:52.230> who<00:02:52.440> created<00:02:52.829> glee<00:02:53.130> also<00:02:53.549> created

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
guys who created glee also created

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.300 
guys who created glee also created
american<00:02:54.420> horror<00:02:54.690> story<00:02:54.959> which<00:02:55.140> is<00:02:55.290> so<00:02:56.280> weird

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
to me because they're two completely

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.660 
to me because they're two completely

00:04:34.099 --> 00:04:35.620 
it's really cool and my least favorite
that<00:04:34.250> I<00:04:34.280> tried<00:04:34.639> will<00:04:34.820> probably<00:04:35.300> have<00:04:35.449> to<00:04:35.599> be

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 
that I tried will probably have to be

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:38.560 
that I tried will probably have to be
the<00:04:35.840> Smashbox<00:04:36.560> full<00:04:36.889> exposure<00:04:37.310> one<00:04:37.789> I<00:04:38.060> just

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:38.570 
the Smashbox full exposure one I just

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:40.629 
the Smashbox full exposure one I just
feel<00:04:38.750> it<00:04:38.960> doesn't<00:04:39.080> coat<00:04:39.560> my<00:04:39.710> lashes<00:04:39.979> enough<00:04:40.430> it

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:40.639 
feel it doesn't coat my lashes enough it

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:42.640 
feel it doesn't coat my lashes enough it
doesn't<00:04:40.789> really<00:04:41.000> do<00:04:41.300> anything<00:04:41.780> for<00:04:42.259> my<00:04:42.440> lashes

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:42.650 
doesn't really do anything for my lashes

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.279 
doesn't really do anything for my lashes
so<00:04:43.190> that<00:04:43.820> one's<00:04:44.000> probably<00:04:44.210> my<00:04:44.660> least<00:04:44.840> favorite

00:04:45.279 --> 00:04:45.289 
so that one's probably my least favorite
