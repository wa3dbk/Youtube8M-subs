00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.190
 hi to all today 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:03.790
 we learn the technique 

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:06.790
 of the bearing it was perfect for reminder 

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:12.169
 I will first make myself 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:24.859
 so fixed in motion 

00:00:25.899 --> 00:00:27.949
 eqtype ...% three parts 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:29.739
 so first 

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:31.109
 the thumb that goes back 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.300
 like that 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.100
 since state 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.040
 then the roofs of sound 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.840
 and the hardest comes down 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.840
 so we put his hands as if we know the horns of the devil 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.340
 so I ride with the bridge 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.340
 and that both fingers leave like that come back 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.080
 percent at the level of the other fingers 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.690
 and the postman there people3 so we have to try to move as little as possible the 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:00:59.420
 hand 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.070
 it is the first who will say that the consulate I ride with the wrist 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:05.860
 it's the wrist that 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.300
 who does this movement there congratulations op 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.190
 then it is true that you 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.510
 alas 05 move my wrist so that the push 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:15.900
 all the bodies 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.950
 it must be dry and above all it must be 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.110
 must be balanced that is to say do not know 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.110
 whether by speed 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.670
 relatively little powder and the right only three points of the bombers and 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.010
 today it's a little bit everyday my editorial 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:35.010
 Why 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.930
 it is a movement that has passed the om 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:43.840
 that's enough 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.840
 eupen to enlighten the licenses a fluidity with this movement 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.660
 because it is necessary that m 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:51.850
 the brain of a ford focus shy child 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:54.710
 to be completely mute the cover 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.640
 I am not at all when I tell you not the 33 you are very well 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.730
 start 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:03.920
 we're going slowly 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.920
 and when we are mayor we go a little faster 

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:12.019
 a couple and when with the most basic - it takes forbidden movement the hand 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:13.189
 like that 

00:02:13.189 --> 00:02:15.729
 rooney carrick the weeds 

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:20.339
 but it's the wrist that the goal is like that that's how it works 

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:38.230
 the next day on a constructive move he continued 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:42.709
 I would like to do like that 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:47.859
 so now we can replace once every two 

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:49.229
 and the other feminine 

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:52.229
 the novel like that 

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:04.439
 now train yourself 

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:07.709
 be patient especially 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:08.239
 I do not have a secret
