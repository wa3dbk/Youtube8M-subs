00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.540 
right out well I got inside and found
the<00:00:48.750> mechanism<00:00:49.379> and<00:00:49.559> everything<00:00:50.250> was<00:00:50.370> intact

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
the mechanism and everything was intact

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.200 
dealer and there happened to be a

mechanic on duty

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.210 
mechanic on duty
I<00:01:03.290> showed<00:01:04.290> him<00:01:04.409> what<00:01:04.530> was<00:01:04.650> wrong<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:04.920> I'm

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
I showed him what was wrong and I'm

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.800 
I showed him what was wrong and I'm
going<00:01:05.339> to<00:01:05.369> show<00:01:05.549> you<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.790> easiest<00:01:06.180> fix<00:01:06.540> in<00:01:06.720> the

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
going to show you the easiest fix in the

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.590 
going to show you the easiest fix in the
world<00:01:07.250> the<00:01:08.250> mechanism<00:01:08.909> wasn't<00:01:09.150> fully

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
world the mechanism wasn't fully

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.260 
world the mechanism wasn't fully
unlocking<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:10.740> so<00:01:11.430> when<00:01:11.610> you<00:01:11.700> pushed<00:01:11.970> on<00:01:12.180> the

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
unlocking and so when you pushed on the

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.200 
unlocking and so when you pushed on the
handle<00:01:12.750> it<00:01:13.409> wouldn't<00:01:14.070> open<00:01:14.460> like<00:01:14.880> that

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
handle it wouldn't open like that

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.090 
handle it wouldn't open like that
I<00:01:15.479> just<00:01:16.080> tried<00:01:16.320> to<00:01:16.439> open<00:01:16.500> it<00:01:16.740> wouldn't<00:01:17.040> open

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
I just tried to open it wouldn't open

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.929 
I just tried to open it wouldn't open
and<00:01:17.630> so<00:01:18.630> this<00:01:19.200> part<00:01:19.710> this<00:01:20.430> little<00:01:20.700> black

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
and so this part this little black

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.440 
and so this part this little black
release<00:01:21.780> piece<00:01:22.080> wasn't<00:01:22.470> fully<00:01:22.710> releasing<00:01:23.450> so

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
release piece wasn't fully releasing so

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.960 
release piece wasn't fully releasing so
the<00:01:25.439> mechanic<00:01:25.920> came<00:01:26.130> over<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:26.490> he<00:01:26.580> did<00:01:26.729> one

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
the mechanic came over and he did one

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.149 
the mechanic came over and he did one
simple<00:01:27.540> move<00:01:28.340> this<00:01:29.340> piece<00:01:29.850> right<00:01:30.240> here<00:01:30.299> is<00:01:31.159> the

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
simple move this piece right here is the

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.620 
simple move this piece right here is the
latch<00:01:32.430> mechanism<00:01:32.570> and<00:01:33.829> it<00:01:34.829> has<00:01:35.390> two<00:01:36.390> or<00:01:36.570> three

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
latch mechanism and it has two or three

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.289 
latch mechanism and it has two or three
plastic<00:01:37.170> tears<00:01:37.829> of<00:01:38.130> different<00:01:38.670> settings<00:01:39.119> and

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
plastic tears of different settings and

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.289 
plastic tears of different settings and
this<00:01:40.020> mechanic<00:01:40.590> simply<00:01:40.979> took<00:01:41.250> it<00:01:41.430> and<00:01:42.270> he

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
this mechanic simply took it and he

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:49.389 
this mechanic simply took it and he
moved<00:01:42.659> it<00:01:42.810> up<00:01:43.049> to<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:44.579> highest<00:01:44.850> setting<00:01:46.100> and

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:49.399 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:54.649 

lock<00:01:50.689> my<00:01:51.689> door<00:01:51.960> now<00:01:52.170> works<00:01:53.060> so<00:01:54.060> anybody<00:01:54.450> that's

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
lock my door now works so anybody that's

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.280 
lock my door now works so anybody that's
struggling<00:01:55.219> with<00:01:56.219> their<00:01:56.430> Toyota<00:01:56.759> minivan

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
struggling with their Toyota minivan

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.660 
struggling with their Toyota minivan
sliding<00:01:58.290> door<00:01:59.149> driver's<00:02:00.149> side<00:02:00.500> non-electric

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
sliding door driver's side non-electric

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.510 
sliding door driver's side non-electric
here's<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:03.000> fix<00:02:03.710> take<00:02:04.710> this<00:02:04.920> little<00:02:05.219> piece

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
here's the fix take this little piece

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.290 
here's the fix take this little piece
right<00:02:05.700> here<00:02:06.180> and<00:02:06.920> move<00:02:07.920> it<00:02:08.099> so<00:02:08.849> that<00:02:08.879> it's<00:02:09.149> got

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
right here and move it so that it's got

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.910 
right here and move it so that it's got
the<00:02:09.479> most<00:02:09.780> tension<00:02:10.170> move<00:02:11.039> it<00:02:11.220> to<00:02:11.970> the<00:02:12.090> bottom

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
the most tension move it to the bottom

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.290 
the most tension move it to the bottom
and<00:02:13.870> there's<00:02:14.870> one<00:02:15.290> two<00:02:15.680> three<00:02:15.880> move<00:02:16.880> it<00:02:17.030> to<00:02:17.180> the

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
and there's one two three move it to the

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.020 
and there's one two three move it to the
third<00:02:17.599> setting<00:02:18.020> so<00:02:18.319> it's<00:02:18.470> tight<00:02:18.800> and<00:02:19.069> it'll

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
third setting so it's tight and it'll
