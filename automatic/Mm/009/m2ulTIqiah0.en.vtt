00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.390 
the garage could be framed up by hand
with<00:01:39.210> joists<00:01:39.479> studs<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:40.380> rafters<00:01:40.829> but<00:01:41.310> it

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
with joists studs and rafters but it

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.560 
with joists studs and rafters but it
would<00:01:41.490> take<00:01:41.640> a<00:01:41.670> little<00:01:41.909> while<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:42.119> bring<00:01:42.390> it

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
would take a little while to bring it

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.179 
would take a little while to bring it
out<00:01:42.659> and<00:01:42.810> of<00:01:42.899> course<00:01:42.930> some<00:01:43.530> time<00:01:43.680> to<00:01:43.799> execute

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
out and of course some time to execute

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.249 
out and of course some time to execute
so<00:01:44.700> we<00:01:45.030> found<00:01:45.270> a<00:01:45.360> place<00:01:45.479> in<00:01:45.600> Grant's<00:01:46.079> burg

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
so we found a place in Grant's burg

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.810 
so we found a place in Grant's burg
Wisconsin<00:01:46.890> where<00:01:47.310> you<00:01:47.399> can<00:01:47.520> give<00:01:47.670> them<00:01:47.729> the

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
Wisconsin where you can give them the

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.670 
Wisconsin where you can give them the
plans<00:01:48.090> they<00:01:48.450> do<00:01:48.509> a<00:01:48.750> little<00:01:48.869> bit<00:01:49.079> of<00:01:49.110> magic<00:01:49.530> and

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
plans they do a little bit of magic and

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.800 
plans they do a little bit of magic and
they<00:01:49.799> would<00:01:49.920> pop<00:01:50.130> out<00:01:50.280> a<00:01:50.340> set<00:01:50.700> of<00:01:50.729> trusses<00:01:51.329> for

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
they would pop out a set of trusses for

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.260 
they would pop out a set of trusses for
the<00:01:51.930> floor<00:01:52.229> walls<00:01:52.920> and<00:01:53.280> ceiling<00:01:53.939> it's<00:01:54.060> pretty

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
the floor walls and ceiling it's pretty

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.700 
the floor walls and ceiling it's pretty
interesting<00:01:54.509> so<00:01:54.840> check<00:01:55.049> it<00:01:55.170> out<00:01:55.259> to

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
interesting so check it out to

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.770 
interesting so check it out to
manufacture<00:01:56.340> trusts<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:57.180> first<00:01:57.420> thing<00:01:57.600> we

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
manufacture trusts the first thing we

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.319 
manufacture trusts the first thing we
need<00:01:57.960> to<00:01:58.079> do<00:01:58.200> is<00:01:58.590> get<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.369> specs<00:01:59.700> from<00:01:59.969> the

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
need to do is get the specs from the

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.060 
need to do is get the specs from the
actual<00:02:00.810> job<00:02:01.020> of<00:02:01.229> what<00:02:01.380> it<00:02:01.500> needs<00:02:01.680> to<00:02:01.770> be<00:02:01.860> done

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
actual job of what it needs to be done

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.120 
actual job of what it needs to be done
and<00:02:02.369> then<00:02:03.360> we<00:02:03.390> have<00:02:03.869> designers<00:02:04.439> that<00:02:04.649> design

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
and then we have designers that design

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.940 
and then we have designers that design

of lumber and the computer just tells it

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:18.990 
of lumber and the computer just tells it
you<00:03:17.709> need<00:03:17.860> six<00:03:18.130> boards<00:03:18.430> of<00:03:18.580> this<00:03:18.730> kind<00:03:18.940> of

lumber in the drop so a boards into the
machine<00:03:21.310> and<00:03:21.550> cut<00:03:21.850> some<00:03:22.030> and<00:03:22.240> someone<00:03:22.990> takes

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
machine and cut some and someone takes

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.530 
machine and cut some and someone takes
mop<00:03:23.410> and<00:03:23.650> put<00:03:23.800> some<00:03:23.950> art<00:03:24.310> and<00:03:25.000> then<00:03:25.209> we<00:03:25.360> have

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
mop and put some art and then we have

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.930 
mop and put some art and then we have
the<00:03:25.720> omni<00:03:26.170> saw<00:03:26.380> which<00:03:26.680> actually<00:03:27.459> that<00:03:27.640> cuts

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
the omni saw which actually that cuts

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.840 
the omni saw which actually that cuts
the<00:03:28.240> top<00:03:29.170> bottom<00:03:29.560> part<00:03:29.800> and<00:03:30.040> then<00:03:30.550> it<00:03:30.670> moves

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
the top bottom part and then it moves

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.480 
the top bottom part and then it moves
into<00:03:31.030> the<00:03:31.330> production<00:03:31.930> process<00:03:32.280> produced<00:03:33.280> on

cords go to the top side of the table

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.510 
cords go to the top side of the table
now<00:03:54.130> when<00:03:54.310> the<00:03:54.370> job<00:03:54.580> comes<00:03:54.850> in<00:03:55.260> the<00:03:56.260> laser

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:56.520 
now when the job comes in the laser

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.760 
now when the job comes in the laser
imprints<00:03:57.520> the<00:03:57.610> job<00:03:57.820> onto<00:03:58.270> the<00:03:58.360> table<00:03:58.720> and<00:03:58.930> it

00:03:59.760 --> 00:03:59.770 
imprints the job onto the table and it

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:03.140 
imprints the job onto the table and it
also<00:03:59.980> shows<00:04:00.570> imprints<00:04:01.570> of<00:04:01.720> the<00:04:02.140> plate<00:04:02.860> layout

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
also shows imprints of the plate layout

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.240 
also shows imprints of the plate layout
so<00:04:04.150> once<00:04:04.450> they<00:04:04.750> get<00:04:04.989> that<00:04:05.170> all<00:04:05.500> set<00:04:05.890> up<00:04:06.040> and

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
so once they get that all set up and

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.130 
so once they get that all set up and
jigged<00:04:06.550> in<00:04:06.760> then<00:04:07.330> at<00:04:07.450> that<00:04:07.570> point<00:04:07.840> they're

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:08.140 
jigged in then at that point they're

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:11.670 
jigged in then at that point they're
it's<00:04:09.100> as<00:04:09.970> they<00:04:10.209> say<00:04:10.450> business<00:04:10.690> as<00:04:11.020> usual<00:04:11.470> they

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 
it's as they say business as usual they

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.670 
it's as they say business as usual they
start<00:04:12.459> honing<00:04:13.090> out<00:04:13.390> the<00:04:13.540> job<00:04:13.780> to<00:04:14.260> hold<00:04:14.500> the

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
start honing out the job to hold the

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.259 
start honing out the job to hold the

very large metal roller comes along and

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.610 
very large metal roller comes along and
it<00:04:39.770> rolls<00:04:40.160> across<00:04:40.880> the<00:04:41.270> trust<00:04:41.720> and<00:04:42.020> partially

it rolls across the trust and partially

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.940 
it rolls across the trust and partially
embeds<00:04:42.950> the<00:04:43.070> plates<00:04:43.910> into<00:04:44.270> the<00:04:44.660> lumber<00:04:45.020> once

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:45.950 
embeds the plates into the lumber once

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:48.160 
embeds the plates into the lumber once
it's<00:04:46.190> gotten<00:04:46.670> the<00:04:46.880> entire<00:04:47.210> truss<00:04:47.540> embedded

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:48.170 
it's gotten the entire truss embedded

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:50.770 
it's gotten the entire truss embedded
together<00:04:48.500> then<00:04:49.100> the<00:04:49.940> trusses<00:04:50.210> actually

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:50.780 
together then the trusses actually

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:52.870 
together then the trusses actually
popped<00:04:51.050> up<00:04:51.260> off<00:04:51.440> of<00:04:51.590> the<00:04:51.650> table<00:04:51.830> and<00:04:52.190> it<00:04:52.340> runs

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 
popped up off of the table and it runs

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.730 
popped up off of the table and it runs
off<00:04:53.120> the<00:04:53.300> end<00:04:53.420> of<00:04:53.510> the<00:04:53.570> table<00:04:53.930> and<00:04:54.050> through<00:04:54.680> a

now<00:05:38.000> and<00:05:38.330> how<00:05:38.750> it's<00:05:38.930> working<00:05:39.200> is<00:05:39.530> they're

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:39.680 
now and how it's working is they're

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.860 
now and how it's working is they're
lifting<00:05:39.980> them<00:05:40.070> up<00:05:40.250> onto<00:05:40.520> the<00:05:40.790> walls<00:05:41.000> walking

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:41.870 
lifting them up onto the walls walking

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:43.810 
lifting them up onto the walls walking
it<00:05:41.990> into<00:05:42.230> place<00:05:42.470> and<00:05:42.740> then<00:05:43.070> securing<00:05:43.580> it<00:05:43.700> at

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:43.820 
it into place and then securing it at

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:45.910 
it into place and then securing it at
the<00:05:43.910> corners<00:05:44.300> with<00:05:44.450> a<00:05:44.540> couple<00:05:44.870> of<00:05:44.990> nails<00:05:45.290> and

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:45.920 
the corners with a couple of nails and

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:47.170 
the corners with a couple of nails and
make<00:05:46.040> sure<00:05:46.160> you<00:05:46.250> have<00:05:46.340> proper<00:05:46.490> spacing<00:05:46.970> of

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:47.180 
make sure you have proper spacing of

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:48.910 
make sure you have proper spacing of
each<00:05:47.300> truss<00:05:47.660> and<00:05:48.140> to<00:05:48.200> lock<00:05:48.380> everything<00:05:48.560> in

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:48.920 
each truss and to lock everything in

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:50.440 
each truss and to lock everything in
place<00:05:49.130> they're<00:05:49.460> using<00:05:49.730> a<00:05:49.910> couple<00:05:50.300> of
