00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:11.389
 the ngo 2011 certainly today accept the 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:18.990
 roasted chorizo 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:28.519
 we need a cutting board 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:28.519
 big knife and a glass a lighter 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.320
 a traditional platter printed with 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:39.879
 Chorizo 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:43.960
 If you have not we can also use in that 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:47.830
 in pyrex as well as ingredients 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:55.330
 we need a chorizo 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:59.559
 so that in now it staples a 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:01:00.370
 strong album we will pass the realization of 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:03.970
 recipe 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:07.960
 to start let's keep our show 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:08.950
 This is like that on the cutting board. Let's go. 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:15.760
 cut 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:23.560
 so little pieces without cutting everything 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:28.409
 so the whole chorizo with slices 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.409
 never thick not too thick 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:36.299
 because you have cut the chorizo â€‹â€‹as well as 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:39.690
 grapevine 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:44.430
 Let's keep a chorizo â€‹â€‹on the platter. 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:49.020
 so wait crosses the inter so in the 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:52.830
 search board then let's play the 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:59.310
 our glass and alcohol and we will fill a 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:02:04.580
 glass with alcohol is not to be staple fill 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:09.950
 thus amputated two thirds of the glass 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:13.530
 so never far from the platter 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:18.870
 after pouring is well above the 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:24.810
 show this to record the alcohol that people 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:28.950
 I want to use it on top we have to take 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:32.069
 attention to not having to whom the side because 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:34.829
 I can not burn the area and let's take it 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:37.620
 When we have a channel with the report it is 

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:40.200
 so with a cloth 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:43.440
 We 'll play later, we'll hope so. 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.780
 that we will check before lighting not 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:49.110
 we let you want alcohol 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:52.260
 the side we will not take with a cloth 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.420
 so and now only need to understand that 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:57.110
 let it burn 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.110
 while you have something 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:09.090
 ours passed 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:13.510

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:16.780

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:19.319
 leave that pulled it to the end 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.319

 it was a few minutes 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:49.410
 let's turn our smile over with 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:52.680
