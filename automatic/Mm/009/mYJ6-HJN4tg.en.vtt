especially when things are

multi-threaded and I think the only

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.449 
multi-threaded and I think the only
thing<00:02:44.020> I've<00:02:44.290> really<00:02:44.590> hanker<00:02:45.010> for<00:02:45.040> and<00:02:45.400> it

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
thing I've really hanker for and it

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:48.090 
thing I've really hanker for and it
wouldn't<00:02:45.640> be<00:02:45.730> $4.99<00:02:45.940> if<00:02:46.360> I<00:02:46.450> had<00:02:46.600> this<00:02:46.920> would<00:02:47.920> be

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
wouldn't be $4.99 if I had this would be

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.910 
wouldn't be $4.99 if I had this would be
an<00:02:48.190> SSD<00:02:48.520> and<00:02:48.970> if<00:02:49.750> you<00:02:49.840> look<00:02:50.050> closer<00:02:50.350> there<00:02:50.740> are

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
an SSD and if you look closer there are

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.140 
an SSD and if you look closer there are
some<00:02:51.160> areas<00:02:51.340> where<00:02:51.520> you<00:02:51.580> can<00:02:51.700> see<00:02:51.790> they've<00:02:51.910> cut

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
some areas where you can see they've cut

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.690 
some areas where you can see they've cut
corners<00:02:52.600> mainly<00:02:53.260> with<00:02:53.440> the<00:02:53.470> build<00:02:53.830> it's<00:02:54.130> still

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
corners mainly with the build it's still

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.280 
corners mainly with the build it's still
feels<00:02:55.030> like<00:02:55.270> asteroid<00:02:55.630> laptop<00:02:56.080> it<00:02:56.140> still

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
feels like asteroid laptop it still

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.560 
feels like asteroid laptop it still
looks<00:02:56.530> lovely<00:02:56.830> it's<00:02:57.610> not<00:02:57.910> quite<00:02:58.300> as<00:02:58.390> much

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
looks lovely it's not quite as much

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.270 
looks lovely it's not quite as much
metal<00:02:58.840> as<00:02:59.080> there<00:02:59.230> was<00:02:59.350> before<00:02:59.380> there's<00:03:00.190> a

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
metal as there was before there's a

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.160 
metal as there was before there's a
little<00:03:00.520> bit<00:03:00.640> more<00:03:00.670> flex<00:03:01.120> in<00:03:01.300> the<00:03:01.390> chassis<00:03:01.630> if

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
little bit more flex in the chassis if

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:03.660 
little bit more flex in the chassis if
you<00:03:02.350> do<00:03:02.530> start<00:03:02.770> putting<00:03:03.220> in<00:03:03.310> that<00:03:03.400> keyboard

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
you do start putting in that keyboard

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.280 
you do start putting in that keyboard
that's<00:03:04.060> maybe<00:03:04.209> a<00:03:04.270> tiny<00:03:04.600> little<00:03:04.810> bit<00:03:04.930> of<00:03:05.050> flex

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
that's maybe a tiny little bit of flex

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.680 
that's maybe a tiny little bit of flex
in<00:03:05.410> the<00:03:05.470> center<00:03:05.800> of<00:03:05.890> it<00:03:06.010> but<00:03:06.310> all<00:03:07.120> things<00:03:07.450> said

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
in the center of it but all things said

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.440 
in the center of it but all things said
the<00:03:07.959> $4.99<00:03:08.680> these<00:03:09.310> compromises<00:03:09.670> are<00:03:10.090> very

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
the $4.99 these compromises are very

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.570 
the $4.99 these compromises are very
minor<00:03:10.780> yeah<00:03:11.590> I<00:03:11.620> think<00:03:11.860> it's<00:03:12.130> the<00:03:12.190> laptop

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580 
minor yeah I think it's the laptop

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.160 
minor yeah I think it's the laptop
that's<00:03:12.730> easy<00:03:12.910> to<00:03:13.120> recommend<00:03:13.420> as<00:03:13.780> long<00:03:13.930> as<00:03:14.050> you

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
that's easy to recommend as long as you

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:15.900 
that's easy to recommend as long as you
make<00:03:14.350> clear<00:03:14.620> that<00:03:14.680> it's<00:03:15.310> a<00:03:15.430> qualified

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
make clear that it's a qualified

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:17.670 
make clear that it's a qualified
recommendation<00:03:16.660> it's<00:03:16.900> not<00:03:17.080> a<00:03:17.110> powerhouse

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
recommendation it's not a powerhouse

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.680 
recommendation it's not a powerhouse
it's<00:03:17.950> not<00:03:18.040> a<00:03:18.070> mobile<00:03:18.280> workstation<00:03:19.150> but<00:03:19.570> for

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
it's not a mobile workstation but for

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.460 
it's not a mobile workstation but for
what<00:03:19.780> it<00:03:19.870> is<00:03:19.900> it's<00:03:20.410> jolly<00:03:20.620> good<00:03:22.230> click<00:03:23.230> to

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
what it is it's jolly good click to
