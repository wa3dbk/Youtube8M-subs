00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.860
 the scenery of the ice planet and visually 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.730
 lost planet looked favorably on the background 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:25.279
 competitors 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.320
 the second part decided to melt not only 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:30.230
 human hearts but literally 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:32.660
 scene of action is replaced by the appearance of nickname 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.520
 hateful jungle that was taken 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.230
 the public is not very rosy 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.480
 so lost planet 3 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.219
 logical table and so returning to

 the origins of us such an action 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:44.719
 developers are not accustomed to managed

 plot the third part is really 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:56.629
 is a prequel 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:58.730
 which is clear again chasing the books 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:00.140
 in the jungles of the players clearly did not want a 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.210
 set on go 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.339

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:16.280
 real strength and like anything easily she 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.370
 disrupted by the appearance of our hero 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.770
 which in reading the hour of playing time 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:23.780
 will be able to turn everything upside down

 frank conversation with the front sight of the ego 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.970
 forced near imminent death so 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:35.020
 that the game is a kind 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:37.510
 miners memoirs patent himself a word 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:40.600

 main tasks and side quests 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:56.260
 So we save heat energy for daily

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:01.420

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:03.360
 I wanted to buy a gun for a more powerful walk 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.680

 cult tv series firefly 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.520
 but as far as the show was spiritual 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:43.330
 as lost planet 3 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:45.190
 turned out to be a soulless gameplay 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:48.130
 is running around on ice 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:50.650
 corridors caves and sites at times 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:53.110
 situations supposedly heating up and deal 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.850
 steep scenes come in fighting stopped 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.190
 bring at least minimal interest 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:59.950
 beetles burst smaller than a pair of shots 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:02.230
 and sitting in their mecca, you can famously push not 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.209
 distracting from the road if they meet 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.160
 the larger individuals then takes effect

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.380
 all depending on which part 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.930
 the screen takes your rival 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.850
 your business is to avoid the obvious as well 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.010
 methodically bombard highlighted 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:37.840
 areas 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.709
 how dead space 3 suddenly began to resemble 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.690
 on lost planet 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:43.150
 and lost planet decided who tribe rans 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:45.220
 in the direction of the well-known game series is 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.730
 especially noticeable by recycled 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:50.190
 interface interaction with the world from 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:52.200
 read very similar to the chipboard of the way 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.540
 no wonder that 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:57.750
 developers are quietly dragging the other hand 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:04:00.599
 ideas but lost planet 3 look real 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:03.060
 a bitch of alien chips originality yes 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:05.610
 forget the hero's hands 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:07.530
 pip-boy who serves as a card inventory 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:10.049
 from time to time 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:12.480
 bothersome tasks get repaired in 

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:13.140
 the most crucial moment broken 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.290
 mechanism 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:19.049
 bothers already for 2 times pressed the key to 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:21.120
 watch how the scale is filled no 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:22.860
 amusing elements still come across but 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.889
 they again are of themselves 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:28.949
 good that was in other games audio 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:30.630

 positively the fallout portal slept bios from 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:44.710
 in the icy lost planet 3 is warming 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.639
 perhaps curious ideas if it 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:48.039
 do blr 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:49.779
 and created from the game fully lpg then on 

00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:52.270
 we would get another masterpiece 

00:04:49.779 --> 00:04:55.389
 which you remembered many years later 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:58.150
 but we have what routine and 

00:04:55.389 --> 00:05:00.009
 monotonous joker and seasoned here and there 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:02.620
 silly humor attracted by the ears 

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:04.749
 romance and timid self-irony game 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:07.029
 quickly bored and rolls itself 

00:05:04.749 --> 00:05:09.279
 repetitions illusion of freedom remain illusions 

00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:11.439
 about the gameplay simply depressing 

00:05:09.279 --> 00:05:13.509
 nothing new and useful love planet 3 

00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:15.689
 does not carry with you and therefore let people 

00:05:13.509 --> 00:05:18.219
 good deed will pass by you 

00:05:15.689 --> 00:05:20.999
