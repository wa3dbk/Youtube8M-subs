00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:51.549 
amount which I set to medium that's

00:01:51.549 --> 00:02:05.180 
amount which I set to medium that's
personally<00:01:52.000> how<00:01:52.090> I<00:01:52.119> like

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:10.340 

I<00:02:05.250> don't<00:02:05.910> have<00:02:05.970> a<00:02:06.030> mouse<00:02:06.330> climate<00:02:08.960> response<00:02:09.960> is

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
I don't have a mouse climate response is

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:23.920 
I don't have a mouse climate response is
really<00:02:10.590> nice

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:31.520 

our<00:02:24.470> underscore<00:02:25.370> and<00:02:25.579> get

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.380 

he<00:02:32.100> goes<00:02:32.480> to

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
he goes to

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.050 
he goes to
so<00:02:35.020> frames<00:02:35.500> per<00:02:35.620> second<00:02:35.890> is

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
so frames per second is

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.570 
so frames per second is
thirty<00:02:37.770> thirty<00:02:38.770> point<00:02:39.040> one<00:02:39.100> thirty<00:02:39.550> 2.6<00:02:40.240> m/s

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
thirty thirty point one thirty 2.6 m/s

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.980 
thirty thirty point one thirty 2.6 m/s
so<00:02:42.630> this<00:02:43.630> is<00:02:44.520> that's<00:02:45.520> the<00:02:45.790> current<00:02:46.209> frames<00:02:46.750> per

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:46.990 
so this is that's the current frames per

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:51.089 
so this is that's the current frames per
second<00:02:48.720> on<00:02:49.720> here

00:02:51.089 --> 00:02:51.099 
second on here

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:56.260 
second on here
not<00:02:51.640> bad
