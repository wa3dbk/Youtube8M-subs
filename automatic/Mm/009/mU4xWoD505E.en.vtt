this is the same modification that

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.080 
this is the same modification that
people<00:00:31.560> have<00:00:31.650> been<00:00:31.740> doing<00:00:31.830> for<00:00:32.040> years<00:00:32.219> it's

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
people have been doing for years it's

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.660 
people have been doing for years it's
just<00:00:33.420> a<00:00:33.719> slightly<00:00:34.620> new<00:00:34.800> take<00:00:35.010> on<00:00:35.219> things<00:00:35.399> it's

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
just a slightly new take on things it's

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.530 
just a slightly new take on things it's
a<00:00:35.760> bit<00:00:36.059> tidier<00:00:36.920> and<00:00:37.920> you<00:00:38.460> don't<00:00:38.850> need<00:00:39.120> to<00:00:39.329> lift

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
a bit tidier and you don't need to lift

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.420 
a bit tidier and you don't need to lift
the<00:00:39.840> legs<00:00:40.050> of<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.320> PPA<00:00:40.649> chips<00:00:40.980> which<00:00:41.250> is

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
the legs of the PPA chips which is

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:42.950 
the legs of the PPA chips which is
generally<00:00:42.000> considered<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:42.450> be<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.660> risky

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
generally considered to be the risky

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.100 
generally considered to be the risky
part<00:00:43.110> this<00:00:43.379> mod<00:00:44.160> because<00:00:44.190> if<00:00:44.670> if<00:00:45.480> you<00:00:45.629> break<00:00:45.930> if

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
part this mod because if if you break if

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.270 
part this mod because if if you break if
in<00:00:46.260> lifting<00:00:46.559> one<00:00:46.649> of<00:00:46.739> those<00:00:46.829> legs<00:00:47.010> you<00:00:47.129> have<00:00:47.219> to

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
in lifting one of those legs you have to

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.459 
in lifting one of those legs you have to
break<00:00:47.430> it<00:00:47.610> off<00:00:47.730> it<00:00:48.629> would<00:00:48.750> be<00:00:48.899> game<00:00:49.140> over<00:00:49.170> for

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
break it off it would be game over for

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.319 
break it off it would be game over for
this<00:00:49.530> board<00:00:49.800> you<00:00:49.950> need<00:00:50.100> a<00:00:50.160> new<00:00:50.340> one<00:00:50.550> so<00:00:50.969> I'm

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
this board you need a new one so I'm

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.209 
this board you need a new one so I'm
going<00:00:51.539> to<00:00:51.570> show<00:00:51.750> you<00:00:51.809> how<00:00:51.989> this<00:00:52.170> is<00:00:52.350> possible

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
going to show you how this is possible

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.180 
going to show you how this is possible
I've<00:00:53.520> rested<00:00:53.760> this<00:00:53.969> both<00:00:54.239> flashlights<00:00:54.870> so<00:00:55.190> we

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
I've rested this both flashlights so we

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:02.240 
I've rested this both flashlights so we
can<00:00:56.309> get<00:00:56.430> a<00:00:56.460> good<00:00:56.579> look<00:00:56.640> at<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:56.969> tracks<00:01:00.859> ok<00:01:01.859> so

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
can get a good look at the tracks ok so

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.890 
can get a good look at the tracks ok so
if<00:01:02.340> you<00:01:02.489> look<00:01:03.090> at<00:01:03.239> pin<00:01:03.449> 30<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:04.589> PPU<00:01:05.100> 2<00:01:05.339> here

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:05.900 
if you look at pin 30 and PPU 2 here

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.530 
if you look at pin 30 and PPU 2 here
you'll<00:01:06.900> see<00:01:07.140> that<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.880> coin<00:01:08.880> our<00:01:09.090> wire<00:01:09.270> is

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
you'll see that the coin our wire is

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.600 
you'll see that the coin our wire is
soldered<00:01:10.049> straight<00:01:10.799> to<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:10.979> leg<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.460> leg

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
soldered straight to the leg and the leg

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.280 
soldered straight to the leg and the leg
isn't<00:01:11.790> raised<00:01:12.030> for<00:01:12.780> this<00:01:12.869> to<00:01:12.960> be<00:01:13.049> possible

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
isn't raised for this to be possible

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.800 
isn't raised for this to be possible
what<00:01:14.100> you<00:01:14.189> have<00:01:14.340> to<00:01:14.430> do<00:01:14.580> there's<00:01:14.790> a<00:01:14.850> track<00:01:15.150> that

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
what you have to do there's a track that

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.200 
what you have to do there's a track that
runs<00:01:15.990> from<00:01:16.259> pin<00:01:16.560> 30<00:01:16.979> underneath<00:01:17.640> these<00:01:17.880> side

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
runs from pin 30 underneath these side

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.050 
runs from pin 30 underneath these side
legs<00:01:18.540> here<00:01:18.780> you<00:01:18.840> can<00:01:18.960> use<00:01:19.049> this<00:01:19.200> dark<00:01:19.560> strip

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
legs here you can use this dark strip

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.520 
legs here you can use this dark strip
well<00:01:21.060> you<00:01:21.150> can<00:01:21.299> just<00:01:21.450> get<00:01:21.570> a<00:01:21.600> STEMI<00:01:21.960> blade<00:01:22.259> or<00:01:22.500> a

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
well you can just get a STEMI blade or a

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.920 
well you can just get a STEMI blade or a
craft<00:01:23.100> knife<00:01:23.340> and<00:01:23.610> just<00:01:23.909> cut<00:01:24.450> that<00:01:24.630> connection

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
craft knife and just cut that connection

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.149 
craft knife and just cut that connection
just<00:01:25.110> disconnect<00:01:25.770> it<00:01:25.950> which<00:01:26.159> frees<00:01:26.460> up<00:01:27.890> pin<00:01:28.890> 30

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
just disconnect it which frees up pin 30

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.480 
just disconnect it which frees up pin 30
to<00:01:29.340> be<00:01:29.430> soldered<00:01:29.759> directly<00:01:29.880> to<00:01:31.490> something

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
to be soldered directly to something

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:38.179 
to be soldered directly to something
similar<00:01:33.200> can<00:01:34.200> be<00:01:34.320> done<00:01:34.439> with<00:01:34.530> ppu<00:01:34.920> one<00:01:36.259> it's<00:01:37.259> 24

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
similar can be done with ppu one it's 24

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.580 
similar can be done with ppu one it's 24
we're<00:01:38.549> connecting<00:01:39.210> two<00:01:39.570> but<00:01:39.900> if<00:01:40.170> you<00:01:40.320> look<00:01:40.470> at

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
we're connecting two but if you look at

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.190 
we're connecting two but if you look at
26<00:01:41.210> your<00:01:42.210> notice<00:01:42.570> that<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:42.869> leg<00:01:43.020> actually

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
26 your notice that the leg actually

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.340 
26 your notice that the leg actually
extends<00:01:43.920> and<00:01:44.009> then<00:01:44.100> connects<00:01:44.460> to<00:01:44.610> this<00:01:44.729> plate

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
extends and then connects to this plate

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.280 
extends and then connects to this plate
yeah<00:01:46.729> so<00:01:47.729> 24<00:01:48.210> used<00:01:48.390> to<00:01:48.450> look<00:01:48.600> just<00:01:48.960> like<00:01:49.049> that

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
yeah so 24 used to look just like that

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.050 
yeah so 24 used to look just like that
so<00:01:49.799> you<00:01:49.890> can<00:01:49.950> get<00:01:50.100> a<00:01:50.159> knife<00:01:50.340> again<00:01:50.640> just

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
so you can get a knife again just

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.139 
so you can get a knife again just
disconnect<00:01:51.960> that<00:01:52.020> and<00:01:52.610> you<00:01:53.610> can<00:01:53.759> then<00:01:53.850> solder

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
disconnect that and you can then solder

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.539 
disconnect that and you can then solder
straight<00:01:54.360> to<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.540> leg<00:01:54.720> a<00:01:54.930> few<00:01:55.770> blobs<00:01:56.280> of<00:01:56.430> glue

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
straight to the leg a few blobs of glue

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.730 
straight to the leg a few blobs of glue
they're<00:01:56.820> just<00:01:57.060> holding<00:01:57.420> them<00:01:57.780> on<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.439> wire<00:01:58.619> in

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
they're just holding them on the wire in

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.289 
they're just holding them on the wire in
place<00:01:59.299> so<00:02:00.299> that's<00:02:00.450> a<00:02:00.630> fair<00:02:00.930> bit<00:02:01.049> stronger<00:02:02.299> and

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
place so that's a fair bit stronger and

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.749 
place so that's a fair bit stronger and
less<00:02:03.479> risk<00:02:03.719> having<00:02:03.960> to<00:02:04.110> raise<00:02:04.290> the<00:02:04.439> legs<00:02:04.759> you

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
less risk having to raise the legs you

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.779 
less risk having to raise the legs you
can't<00:02:06.030> actually<00:02:06.180> do<00:02:06.570> that<00:02:06.810> that<00:02:07.560> same<00:02:07.950> thing

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
can't actually do that that same thing

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.219 
can't actually do that that same thing
on<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.149> lockout<00:02:09.509> chip<00:02:09.539> just<00:02:09.959> because<00:02:10.140> you

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
on the lockout chip just because you

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.570 
on the lockout chip just because you
can't<00:02:10.440> see<00:02:10.530> underneath<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:11.069> chip<00:02:11.250> you<00:02:11.370> can't

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
can't see underneath the chip you can't

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
can't see underneath the chip you can't
see<00:02:11.700> where<00:02:11.849> the<00:02:11.910> tracks<00:02:12.150> are<00:02:12.330> going

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
see where the tracks are going

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.590 
see where the tracks are going
and<00:02:12.840> so<00:02:13.800> you<00:02:13.890> don't<00:02:14.070> get<00:02:14.480> quite<00:02:15.480> a<00:02:15.570> good

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
and so you don't get quite a good

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.300 
and so you don't get quite a good
picture<00:02:16.110> of<00:02:16.140> what<00:02:16.410> options<00:02:16.770> you've<00:02:16.890> got<00:02:17.070> so

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
picture of what options you've got so

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.270 
picture of what options you've got so
best<00:02:17.940> just<00:02:18.150> to<00:02:18.240> raise<00:02:18.360> that<00:02:18.570> leg<00:02:18.830> nice<00:02:19.830> blob<00:02:20.160> of

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
best just to raise that leg nice blob of

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.390 
best just to raise that leg nice blob of
hot<00:02:20.430> glue<00:02:20.580> for<00:02:20.670> mechanical<00:02:21.270> strength<00:02:22.400> and

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
hot glue for mechanical strength and

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.280 
hot glue for mechanical strength and
you're<00:02:23.550> good<00:02:23.700> to<00:02:23.820> go<00:02:23.850> let<00:02:24.090> me<00:02:24.150> just<00:02:24.180> move<00:02:25.110> this

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
you're good to go let me just move this

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:34.820 
you're good to go let me just move this
light<00:02:25.590> it<00:02:25.800> the<00:02:25.890> way<00:02:31.100> so<00:02:33.320> once<00:02:34.320> you've<00:02:34.500> once

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
light it the way so once you've once

you've put your once you put your wires
in<00:02:36.960> place<00:02:36.990> or<00:02:37.470> definitely<00:02:38.160> check<00:02:38.370> everything

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
in place or definitely check everything

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.760 
in place or definitely check everything
with<00:02:39.030> a<00:02:39.060> multimeter<00:02:39.540> check<00:02:40.380> everything<00:02:40.680> at

with a multimeter check everything at

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:41.660 
with a multimeter check everything at
the<00:02:40.830> end<00:02:40.860> when<00:02:41.070> you<00:02:41.130> put<00:02:41.280> the<00:02:41.340> switches<00:02:41.640> in

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
anyway but these legs are obviously so

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.690 
anyway but these legs are obviously so
fine<00:02:45.180> that<00:02:45.480> you<00:02:45.870> want<00:02:46.020> to<00:02:46.080> make<00:02:46.200> sure<00:02:46.700> there's

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
fine that you want to make sure there's

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.710 
fine that you want to make sure there's
no<00:02:47.880> solder<00:02:48.330> bridging<00:02:48.750> the<00:02:48.840> gap<00:02:49.020> and<00:02:50.390> also<00:02:51.390> once

no solder bridging the gap and also once

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:52.910 
no solder bridging the gap and also once
the<00:02:51.840> switch<00:02:51.990> is<00:02:52.140> run<00:02:52.290> make<00:02:52.440> sure<00:02:52.590> you<00:02:52.740> get<00:02:52.830> in

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
the switch is run make sure you get in

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.860 
the switch is run make sure you get in
the<00:02:53.040> ground<00:02:53.880> and<00:02:54.150> the<00:02:54.240> five<00:02:54.420> volts<00:02:54.720> in<00:02:54.810> the

right places
so<00:02:58.760> what's<00:02:59.760> happening<00:03:00.090> here<00:03:00.300> is<00:03:00.360> we're<00:03:00.510> going

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
so what's happening here is we're going

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.610 
so what's happening here is we're going

don't<00:03:58.860> have<00:03:58.950> to<00:03:59.010> drill<00:03:59.190> one<00:03:59.280> hole<00:03:59.340> and

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
don't have to drill one hole and

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.910 
don't have to drill one hole and
secondly<00:04:00.600> you've<00:04:00.750> got<00:04:00.840> these<00:04:00.960> four<00:04:01.020> points

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
secondly you've got these four points

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.560 
secondly you've got these four points
here<00:04:02.250> now<00:04:02.610> these<00:04:02.790> are<00:04:02.940> the<00:04:03.000> points<00:04:03.300> that<00:04:03.360> the

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570 
here now these are the points that the

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:06.080 
here now these are the points that the
RF<00:04:03.840> box<00:04:04.080> used<00:04:05.010> to<00:04:05.130> connect<00:04:05.340> him<00:04:05.490> to<00:04:05.520> to<00:04:05.850> remove

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
RF box used to connect him to to remove

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:07.970 
RF box used to connect him to to remove
that<00:04:06.240> by<00:04:06.360> the<00:04:06.420> way<00:04:06.570> you've<00:04:06.690> got<00:04:06.720> one<00:04:06.960> screw<00:04:07.620> you

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
that by the way you've got one screw you

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.920 
that by the way you've got one screw you
remove<00:04:08.190> from<00:04:08.310> here<00:04:08.490> and<00:04:08.670> you<00:04:09.090> D<00:04:09.450> solder<00:04:09.810> these

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
remove from here and you D solder these

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.200 
remove from here and you D solder these
four<00:04:10.200> points<00:04:10.440> the<00:04:11.250> Box<00:04:11.460> pops<00:04:11.700> right<00:04:11.910> out<00:04:11.970> it's

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:12.210 
four points the Box pops right out it's

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:15.500 
four points the Box pops right out it's
all<00:04:12.360> table<00:04:12.660> in<00:04:12.780> place<00:04:12.990> and<00:04:14.150> but<00:04:15.150> the<00:04:15.270> great

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
all table in place and but the great

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:16.789 
all table in place and but the great
thing<00:04:15.690> about<00:04:15.720> these<00:04:15.990> four<00:04:16.200> points<00:04:16.380> is<00:04:16.620> the

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
thing about these four points is the

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:20.150 
thing about these four points is the
left<00:04:16.980> one<00:04:17.130> is<00:04:17.370> your<00:04:17.810> ground<00:04:18.810> line<00:04:19.109> and<00:04:19.350> the

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
left one is your ground line and the

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.979 
left one is your ground line and the
right<00:04:20.370> one<00:04:20.549> is<00:04:20.790> your<00:04:21.060> five<00:04:21.299> volt<00:04:21.570> line<00:04:21.750> so

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
right one is your five volt line so

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:24.140 
right one is your five volt line so
there's<00:04:22.140> no<00:04:22.350> need<00:04:22.530> to<00:04:22.860> be<00:04:23.310> running<00:04:23.520> wires<00:04:23.820> to

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
there's no need to be running wires to

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.140 
there's no need to be running wires to
the<00:04:24.330> voltage<00:04:25.200> regulator

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 
the voltage regulator

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.570 
the voltage regulator
people<00:04:26.360> do<00:04:26.509> you<00:04:27.470> can<00:04:27.620> localize<00:04:28.040> it<00:04:28.220> all<00:04:28.340> here

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
people do you can localize it all here

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.090 
people do you can localize it all here
and<00:04:29.050> I'm<00:04:30.050> not<00:04:30.229> gonna<00:04:30.350> explain<00:04:30.590> how<00:04:30.650> the<00:04:30.830> actual

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:31.100 
and I'm not gonna explain how the actual

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:35.110 
and I'm not gonna explain how the actual
mod<00:04:31.280> works<00:04:31.520> because<00:04:31.729> it's<00:04:31.820> the<00:04:31.880> same<00:04:32.060> as<00:04:34.120> every

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120 
mod works because it's the same as every

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.029 
mod works because it's the same as every
other<00:04:35.330> websites<00:04:35.840> explanation<00:04:36.440> of<00:04:36.530> it<00:04:36.650> and

00:04:37.029 --> 00:04:37.039 
other websites explanation of it and

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:39.070 
other websites explanation of it and
it's<00:04:37.280> just<00:04:37.550> a<00:04:37.759> slightly<00:04:38.120> tidier<00:04:38.600> version<00:04:38.990> of

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080 
it's just a slightly tidier version of

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.760 
it's just a slightly tidier version of
it<00:04:39.199> so<00:04:39.949> yeah<00:04:40.520> I<00:04:40.699> hope<00:04:40.910> this<00:04:41.060> has<00:04:41.210> been<00:04:41.240> of
