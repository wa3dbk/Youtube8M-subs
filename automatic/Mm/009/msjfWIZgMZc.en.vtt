00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 how about youtube friends this is the 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:07.230
 only the hero song is a very single 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.970
 simple is suitable for those who are 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.790
 starting and we will use techniques 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.889
 as a hammer of love and the slide 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.730
 use standard applications Notice 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.730
 how we started 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.210
 i 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.450
 meditate 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.870
 He says 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:41.379
 i 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.379
 i 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:47.059
 Y 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.280
 let's start and make one two three 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:51.829
 four we started by placing the 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:55.360
 number one on the rope number four in 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:55.360
 the number five fret 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:01.360
 here we are going to give two hits first and 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:03.640
 then a hammer hit where the 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:07.620
 Cameron is hammer disappears with a 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:10.430
 ax and is towards the number seven fret 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:13.010
 Y 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:15.970
 then with this same we slide towards 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.970
 the number 9 fret 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.380
 because then we have this 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.990
 Y 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:35.650
 then with the same number 3 we go 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:37.060
 to go to the number 9 fret and 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:38.800
 let's go back to our position 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.530
 initial 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.780
 the diagonal indicate that we slide 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:49.350
 we take off our finger I'm going to do it 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:49.350
 very slow 3 2 1 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:55.260
 Y 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.260
 Y 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.450
 and we come back here to slide 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.280
 i 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:11.860
 then touch the same with our 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:15.220
 number 1 we climb to the sixth string 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:17.459
 doing fret and we're going to slide like this 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.459
 the seventh 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.780
 then comes a compu cameron what this 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:27.300
 as we do, they continue with the number 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:31.080
 3 first hammer 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:34.290
 and with this same 3 we pull 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.920
 and we slide to the number 5 fret 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.920
 with the 1 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.359
 what is a rapid movement 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.480
 what are we going to do it all over again 3 2 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:50.480
 one 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.460
 we go back to slide 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.450
 we climb 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.410
 and the gender technique in your love 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:17.430
 then we went down here I thought with the number 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:20.830
 1 on the fret number 7 string number 3 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:23.080
 and they are 3 taps 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:27.180
 and we go down the same with the same number finger 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.180
 one and we go up 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:35.300
 100 of arrangement is equal nothing else now 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.840
 we slide 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.840
 Y 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:43.860
 then we play here we do as a 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.860
 entourage with the number 1 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:52.170
 okay 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:54.680
 and we go up slide 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:58.719
 and we play again 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.719
 and we do the same general technique 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:07.319
 even if it's the same way everything is slow 3 2 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.319
 one 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.400
 Y 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:33.830
 and 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.500
 and 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:46.860
 Y 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.450
 Y 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:54.669
 321 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.490
 Y 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:06.920
 do not 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:10.310
 and 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:13.940
 and 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:18.270
 Y 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:25.600
 perfect to see him rehearsing already know that in 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:28.660
 the part of the solos is always to do it 

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:31.210
 clean clean and very slow and after 

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:33.460
