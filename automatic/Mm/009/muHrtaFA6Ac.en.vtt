00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
think a provodnikov he's as quick on his

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.880 
think a provodnikov he's as quick on his

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
feet it's real snow that Rios is a you

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.260 
feet it's real snow that Rios is a you
know<00:01:13.979> flash<00:01:14.310> on<00:01:14.520> his<00:01:14.640> feet<00:01:14.820> or<00:01:14.970> anything<00:01:15.240> like

know flash on his feet or anything like
that<00:01:15.420> I<00:01:15.869> think<00:01:16.530> Rios<00:01:16.770> his<00:01:16.979> foot<00:01:17.220> speed<00:01:17.369> is<00:01:17.610> a

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
that I think Rios his foot speed is a

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.630 
that I think Rios his foot speed is a
bit<00:01:17.850> better<00:01:18.060> in<00:01:18.750> providing<00:01:19.049> a<00:01:19.259> cough<00:01:19.439> I<00:01:19.680> think

bit better in providing a cough I think

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.460 
bit better in providing a cough I think
his<00:01:20.880> combinations<00:01:21.689> are<00:01:21.900> a<00:01:21.930> bit<00:01:22.080> better<00:01:22.229> and

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
his combinations are a bit better and

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.859 
his combinations are a bit better and
providing<00:01:22.860> a<00:01:22.890> cough<00:01:23.040> i<00:01:23.159> think<00:01:23.369> is<00:01:23.520> i<00:01:23.700> mean<00:01:24.030> we

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
providing a cough i think is i mean we

providing a cough i think is i mean we
lord<00:01:25.229> knows<00:01:25.530> rios<00:01:26.340> don't<00:01:26.580> have<00:01:26.700> a<00:01:26.729> defense<00:01:27.240> but

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
lord knows rios don't have a defense but

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.920 
lord knows rios don't have a defense but
whatever<00:01:29.670> deve<00:01:29.909> what<00:01:30.150> little<00:01:30.420> defense<00:01:30.810> he

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930

than<00:01:33.030> provodnikov's<00:01:33.720> defense<00:01:34.229> I<00:01:34.439> think

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
than provodnikov's defense I think

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.890

like the reels fight you know will he be
able<00:02:52.690> to<00:02:52.930> get<00:02:53.170> through<00:02:53.440> it<00:02:53.590> I<00:02:54.330> don't<00:02:55.330> know<00:02:55.450> I

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
able to get through it I don't know I

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.690 
able to get through it I don't know I
don't<00:02:56.050> know<00:02:56.230> uh<00:02:56.500> but<00:02:57.280> like<00:02:57.400> I<00:02:57.550> say

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
don't know uh but like I say

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.820 
don't know uh but like I say
stylistically<00:02:58.360> I<00:02:58.480> think<00:02:58.780> I<00:02:59.020> don't<00:02:59.620> think

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
stylistically I think I don't think

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:01.860 
stylistically I think I don't think
provodnikov<00:03:00.370> fizzes<00:03:00.670> is<00:03:00.880> effective<00:03:01.660> a

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
provodnikov fizzes is effective a

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.740 
provodnikov fizzes is effective a
pressure<00:03:02.320> fighter<00:03:02.440> is<00:03:02.860> brandon<00:03:03.220> rios<00:03:03.720> yeah<00:03:04.720> i

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
pressure fighter is brandon rios yeah i

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.270 
pressure fighter is brandon rios yeah i
don't<00:03:04.960> think<00:03:05.200> he's<00:03:05.320> quite<00:03:05.470> as<00:03:05.650> effective<00:03:05.920> but

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
don't think he's quite as effective but

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.150 
don't think he's quite as effective but
i<00:03:06.400> think<00:03:06.640> he<00:03:06.790> is<00:03:06.910> a<00:03:06.940> bigger<00:03:07.240> puncher<00:03:08.130> so<00:03:09.130> I

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
i think he is a bigger puncher so I

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.580 
i think he is a bigger puncher so I
think<00:03:09.490> Alvarado<00:03:10.270> overall<00:03:10.960> will<00:03:11.170> have<00:03:11.350> a

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
think Alvarado overall will have a

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.750 
think Alvarado overall will have a
slightly<00:03:11.920> easier<00:03:12.340> time<00:03:13.060> out<00:03:13.300> boxing

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
slightly easier time out boxing

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.729 
slightly easier time out boxing
provodnikov<00:03:15.760> I<00:03:16.330> don't<00:03:17.020> think<00:03:17.260> he<00:03:17.560> I<00:03:17.590> don't

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
provodnikov I don't think he I don't

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:19.860 
provodnikov I don't think he I don't
think<00:03:18.100> the<00:03:18.190> pressure<00:03:18.489> will<00:03:19.120> be<00:03:19.300> as<00:03:19.420> intense

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
think the pressure will be as intense

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.820 
think the pressure will be as intense
from<00:03:20.830> provodnikov<00:03:21.430> as<00:03:21.670> it<00:03:21.910> was<00:03:22.090> from<00:03:22.420> reals

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
from provodnikov as it was from reals

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.949 
from provodnikov as it was from reals
but<00:03:23.830> as<00:03:24.100> i<00:03:24.640> said<00:03:24.670> i<00:03:24.910> believe<00:03:25.060> when<00:03:25.660> the<00:03:25.780> cough

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
but as i said i believe when the cough

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:30.330 
but as i said i believe when the cough
does<00:03:26.290> hit<00:03:27.220> harder<00:03:27.670> than<00:03:27.700> rios<00:03:28.120> so<00:03:29.110> whereas<00:03:30.100> he

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
does hit harder than rios so whereas he

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.610 
does hit harder than rios so whereas he
managed<00:03:30.640> to<00:03:30.790> survive<00:03:30.989> being<00:03:31.989> her<00:03:32.290> against

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
managed to survive being her against

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.370 
managed to survive being her against
Rios<00:03:32.980> in<00:03:33.250> the<00:03:33.820> rematch<00:03:34.180> he<00:03:34.840> might<00:03:35.110> not<00:03:35.320> survive

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
Rios in the rematch he might not survive

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.760 
Rios in the rematch he might not survive
being<00:03:36.010> her<00:03:36.220> against<00:03:36.580> provodnikov<00:03:37.620> you<00:03:38.620> know

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:38.770 
being her against provodnikov you know

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:40.380 
being her against provodnikov you know
and<00:03:39.070> you<00:03:39.130> have<00:03:39.370> to<00:03:39.520> imagine<00:03:39.700> at<00:03:40.000> some<00:03:40.030> stage

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
and you have to imagine at some stage

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.580 
and you have to imagine at some stage
provodnikov<00:03:41.020> will<00:03:41.380> catch<00:03:41.680> him<00:03:41.890> how<00:03:42.640> will

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
provodnikov will catch him how will

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.699 
provodnikov will catch him how will

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
relentless enough bit too easy to hit

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.070 
relentless enough bit too easy to hit
but<00:04:15.760> I<00:04:15.820> definitely<00:04:16.060> give<00:04:16.450> him<00:04:16.600> a<00:04:16.630> good<00:04:16.750> chance

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:17.080
