00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.510 
Cologne in the past and he loved it I
would<00:00:51.719> definitely<00:00:52.079> suggest<00:00:52.230> asking<00:00:53.160> him<00:00:53.340> what

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
would definitely suggest asking him what

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.889 
would definitely suggest asking him what

eleven<00:01:16.320> earbuds<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:17.580> these<00:01:18.000> are<00:01:18.119> like<00:01:18.299> a

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
eleven earbuds and these are like a

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.990 
eleven earbuds and these are like a
really<00:01:18.960> sophisticated<00:01:19.340> design<00:01:20.340> which<00:01:20.700> is<00:01:20.850> why

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
really sophisticated design which is why

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.450 
really sophisticated design which is why
I<00:01:21.030> think<00:01:21.330> it<00:01:21.630> would<00:01:21.720> be<00:01:21.810> great<00:01:21.960> for<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:22.680> dad<00:01:23.009> or

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
I think it would be great for a dad or

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.090 
I think it would be great for a dad or
father<00:01:23.880> figure<00:01:24.479> whoever<00:01:24.840> you<00:01:25.530> think<00:01:25.590> might

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
father figure whoever you think might

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.330 
father figure whoever you think might
suit<00:01:26.790> like<00:01:27.150> a<00:01:27.180> more<00:01:27.570> sophisticated<00:01:28.020> style<00:01:28.890> and

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
suit like a more sophisticated style and

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.090 
suit like a more sophisticated style and
these<00:01:30.000> are<00:01:30.329> like<00:01:30.810> a<00:01:30.960> wood<00:01:31.259> design<00:01:31.470> and<00:01:32.009> I'm

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
these are like a wood design and I'm

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.260 
these are like a wood design and I'm
pretty<00:01:32.310> sure<00:01:32.400> they're<00:01:32.640> actually<00:01:32.939> made<00:01:33.119> of

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
pretty sure they're actually made of

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.910 
pretty sure they're actually made of
wood<00:01:33.540> which<00:01:33.780> is<00:01:33.930> apparently<00:01:34.320> supposed<00:01:34.500> to<00:01:34.829> be

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
wood which is apparently supposed to be

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.399 
wood which is apparently supposed to be
better<00:01:35.100> for<00:01:35.430> acoustics<00:01:36.000> so<00:01:36.509> they<00:01:36.960> actually

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
better for acoustics so they actually

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:38.960 
better for acoustics so they actually
sound<00:01:37.560> really<00:01:37.829> nice<00:01:37.950> I<00:01:38.159> have<00:01:38.340> tested<00:01:38.700> them<00:01:38.820> out

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
sound really nice I have tested them out

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.280 
sound really nice I have tested them out
just<00:01:39.180> to<00:01:39.329> make<00:01:39.360> sure<00:01:39.479> that<00:01:39.750> they<00:01:39.900> had<00:01:40.079> shoe

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
just to make sure that they had shoe

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.740 
just to make sure that they had shoe
worked<00:01:40.560> and<00:01:40.860> that<00:01:41.310> brand<00:01:41.670> means<00:01:41.970> they<00:01:42.360> do<00:01:42.420> also

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
worked and that brand means they do also

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.389 
worked and that brand means they do also
have<00:01:42.930> like<00:01:43.290> different<00:01:43.590> types<00:01:43.619> of<00:01:43.950> headphones

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
have like different types of headphones

who are going to university because they

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.310 
who are going to university because they

their<00:04:01.440> phone<00:04:01.680> will<00:04:01.830> die<00:04:01.980> maybe<00:04:02.400> they<00:04:02.580> have<00:04:02.670> to

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
their phone will die maybe they have to

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.060 
their phone will die maybe they have to
go<00:04:02.880> to<00:04:02.940> work<00:04:03.180> or<00:04:03.390> something<00:04:03.630> and<00:04:04.110> this<00:04:04.709> is<00:04:04.860> just

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.070 
go to work or something and this is just

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:06.500 
go to work or something and this is just
great<00:04:05.280> to<00:04:05.310> have<00:04:05.550> in<00:04:05.700> your<00:04:05.820> backpack<00:04:06.270> because

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
great to have in your backpack because

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.780 
great to have in your backpack because
it<00:04:06.750> will<00:04:07.080> fully<00:04:07.320> charge<00:04:07.410> your<00:04:07.650> phone<00:04:07.980> like

it will fully charge your phone like

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.970 
it will fully charge your phone like
probably<00:04:09.120> more<00:04:09.540> than<00:04:09.690> once<00:04:09.900> so<00:04:10.230> I<00:04:10.350> think<00:04:10.650> it's

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
probably more than once so I think it's

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.860 
probably more than once so I think it's
a<00:04:11.070> great<00:04:11.370> stocking<00:04:11.670> stuffer<00:04:12.120> idea<00:04:12.390> and<00:04:12.660> you
