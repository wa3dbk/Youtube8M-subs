you'll<00:00:15.170> what<00:00:15.320> up<00:00:15.500> in<00:00:15.800> this<00:00:16.280> tutorial<00:00:16.520> series

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:17.029 
you'll what up in this tutorial series

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:19.679 
you'll what up in this tutorial series
guys<00:00:17.450> we're<00:00:17.690> gonna<00:00:17.779> be<00:00:17.900> looking<00:00:18.230> at<00:00:18.380> Python<00:00:19.100> so

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:19.689 
guys we're gonna be looking at Python so

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:22.330 
guys we're gonna be looking at Python so
python<00:00:20.689> is<00:00:20.960> one<00:00:21.619> of<00:00:21.710> the<00:00:21.770> most<00:00:21.920> popular

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:22.340 
python is one of the most popular

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.519 
python is one of the most popular
programming<00:00:22.700> languages<00:00:23.090> out<00:00:23.360> there<00:00:23.630> it's<00:00:24.470> not

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:24.529 
programming languages out there it's not

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:26.380 
programming languages out there it's not
the<00:00:24.710> most<00:00:24.890> powerful<00:00:25.369> by<00:00:25.520> any<00:00:25.670> means<00:00:25.939> but<00:00:26.180> it

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:26.390 
the most powerful by any means but it

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.120 
the most powerful by any means but it
can<00:00:26.630> do<00:00:26.810> a<00:00:27.140> whole<00:00:27.470> lot<00:00:27.529> of<00:00:27.680> stuff<00:00:27.980> from

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:28.130 
can do a whole lot of stuff from

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.960 
can do a whole lot of stuff from
websites<00:00:28.640> to<00:00:29.180> games<00:00:29.449> to<00:00:30.400> just<00:00:31.400> server<00:00:31.609> tasks

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:31.970 
websites to games to just server tasks

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:33.880 
websites to games to just server tasks
things<00:00:32.270> like<00:00:32.510> that<00:00:32.720> so<00:00:33.290> there's<00:00:33.470> a<00:00:33.620> lot<00:00:33.650> of

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:33.890 
things like that so there's a lot of

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:35.890 
things like that so there's a lot of
different<00:00:34.160> areas<00:00:34.610> that<00:00:34.940> you<00:00:35.150> can<00:00:35.239> use<00:00:35.570> Python

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:35.900 
different areas that you can use Python

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.110 
different areas that you can use Python
with<00:00:36.290> and<00:00:36.710> it's<00:00:37.430> one<00:00:37.640> of<00:00:37.730> the<00:00:37.790> easiest

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:38.120 
with and it's one of the easiest

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.840 
with and it's one of the easiest
languages<00:00:38.750> to<00:00:39.019> start<00:00:39.290> out<00:00:39.440> learning<00:00:40.190> so<00:00:40.670> it's

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850 
languages to start out learning so it's

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.119 
languages to start out learning so it's
it's<00:00:41.239> always<00:00:41.480> a<00:00:41.510> good<00:00:41.660> idea<00:00:41.720> to<00:00:42.019> be<00:00:42.320> your<00:00:42.559> first

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:43.129 
it's always a good idea to be your first

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:45.130 
it's always a good idea to be your first
language<00:00:43.670> and<00:00:43.879> one<00:00:44.420> of<00:00:44.510> the<00:00:44.600> best<00:00:44.900> things

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140 
language and one of the best things

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:46.990 
language and one of the best things
about<00:00:45.260> it<00:00:45.680> is<00:00:45.800> that<00:00:45.979> you<00:00:46.580> can<00:00:46.729> pretty<00:00:46.879> much

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:47.000 
about it is that you can pretty much

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.090 
about it is that you can pretty much
start<00:00:47.510> coding<00:00:48.140> right<00:00:48.290> away<00:00:48.530> without<00:00:48.710> having

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
start coding right away without having

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.320 
start coding right away without having
to<00:00:49.220> do<00:00:49.610> too<00:00:49.760> much<00:00:49.879> backburner<00:00:50.420> stuff<00:00:51.400> in<00:00:52.400> this

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:53.330 
to do too much backburner stuff in this

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:54.460 
to do too much backburner stuff in this
video<00:00:53.629> we're<00:00:53.839> going<00:00:53.930> to<00:00:53.989> go<00:00:54.110> through<00:00:54.350> the

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:54.470 
video we're going to go through the

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.680 
video we're going to go through the
installation<00:00:54.860> process<00:00:55.309> with<00:00:55.909> with<00:00:56.239> Python

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:56.690 
installation process with with Python

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.920 
installation process with with Python
and<00:00:57.100> one<00:00:58.100> of<00:00:58.190> the<00:00:58.250> other<00:00:58.370> notes<00:00:58.729> that<00:00:58.940> Python

00:00:59.920 --> 00:00:59.930 
and one of the other notes that Python

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.860 
and one of the other notes that Python
is<00:01:00.080> great<00:01:00.290> at<00:01:00.440> is<00:01:00.620> it<00:01:01.400> requires<00:01:02.059> the<00:01:02.269> indent

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:02.870 
is great at is it requires the indent

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.820 
is great at is it requires the indent
your<00:01:03.049> code<00:01:03.320> so<00:01:04.960> you're<00:01:05.960> gonna<00:01:06.049> learn<00:01:06.290> proper

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830 
your code so you're gonna learn proper

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.580 
your code so you're gonna learn proper
coding<00:01:07.070> syntax<00:01:07.670> and<00:01:08.030> styles<00:01:08.570> when<00:01:09.290> you<00:01:09.409> do

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
coding syntax and styles when you do

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.350 
coding syntax and styles when you do
your<00:01:09.799> loops<00:01:10.040> and<00:01:10.369> things<00:01:10.490> like<00:01:10.700> that<00:01:10.760> you'll

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:11.360 
your loops and things like that you'll

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.330 
your loops and things like that you'll
end<00:01:11.540> up<00:01:11.600> taking<00:01:12.020> on<00:01:12.140> to<00:01:12.680> other<00:01:12.890> languages

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
end up taking on to other languages

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.700 
end up taking on to other languages
whether<00:01:13.760> it's<00:01:13.940> JavaScript<00:01:14.210> or<00:01:14.810> C<00:01:15.020> sharp<00:01:15.049> Java

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
whether it's JavaScript or C sharp Java

whether it's JavaScript or C sharp Java
or<00:01:15.890> whatever<00:01:15.979> it<00:01:16.280> may<00:01:16.399> be

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 
or whatever it may be

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.240 
or whatever it may be
Python<00:01:17.840> is<00:01:17.990> definitely<00:01:18.320> a<00:01:18.380> great<00:01:18.500> language<00:01:18.979> to

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
Python is definitely a great language to

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.730 
Python is definitely a great language to
start<00:01:19.460> off<00:01:19.640> with<00:01:19.850> so<00:01:20.090> I'm<00:01:20.780> gonna<00:01:20.869> try<00:01:21.170> to<00:01:21.200> keep

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
start off with so I'm gonna try to keep

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.740 
start off with so I'm gonna try to keep
things<00:01:22.030> moving<00:01:23.030> in<00:01:23.119> this<00:01:23.240> tutorial<00:01:23.420> series

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
things moving in this tutorial series

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.310 
things moving in this tutorial series
and<00:01:24.289> also<00:01:24.880> try<00:01:25.880> to<00:01:25.909> keep<00:01:26.119> things<00:01:26.359> as<00:01:26.659> fresh<00:01:27.049> as

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
and also try to keep things as fresh as

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:28.929 
and also try to keep things as fresh as
as<00:01:27.560> I<00:01:27.679> possibly<00:01:28.100> can<00:01:28.250> because<00:01:28.460> some<00:01:28.759> of<00:01:28.789> these

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:28.939 
as I possibly can because some of these

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:30.789 
as I possibly can because some of these
damn<00:01:29.149> tutorial<00:01:29.750> videos<00:01:30.020> are<00:01:30.229> very<00:01:30.469> very

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:30.799 
damn tutorial videos are very very

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:33.130 
damn tutorial videos are very very
boring<00:01:31.420> hopefully<00:01:32.420> I<00:01:32.450> can<00:01:32.570> answer<00:01:32.780> your

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
boring hopefully I can answer your

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.319 
boring hopefully I can answer your
questions<00:01:33.679> I<00:01:33.829> have<00:01:33.950> another<00:01:34.219> Python<00:01:34.579> tutorial

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:35.329 
questions I have another Python tutorial

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:36.609 
questions I have another Python tutorial
series<00:01:35.509> and<00:01:35.750> I'm<00:01:35.810> hoping<00:01:36.079> that<00:01:36.229> this<00:01:36.320> is<00:01:36.500> going

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:36.619 
series and I'm hoping that this is going

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:39.749 
series and I'm hoping that this is going
to<00:01:36.679> end<00:01:36.829> up<00:01:36.890> being<00:01:37.130> kind<00:01:37.759> of<00:01:37.880> a<00:01:38.000> replacement

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:39.759 
to end up being kind of a replacement

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:42.069 
to end up being kind of a replacement
but<00:01:40.759> what<00:01:40.880> I<00:01:40.909> want<00:01:41.119> to<00:01:41.179> do<00:01:41.329> is<00:01:41.509> I<00:01:41.719> kind<00:01:41.899> of<00:01:41.929> want

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:42.079 
but what I want to do is I kind of want

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:44.230 
but what I want to do is I kind of want
to<00:01:42.109> jump<00:01:42.320> into<00:01:42.469> everyday<00:01:43.460> tasks<00:01:44.030> that<00:01:44.119> you

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
to jump into everyday tasks that you

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.200 
to jump into everyday tasks that you
would<00:01:44.359> use<00:01:44.570> Python<00:01:45.109> for<00:01:45.520> as<00:01:46.520> opposed<00:01:46.909> to<00:01:46.999> going

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
would use Python for as opposed to going

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:48.700 
would use Python for as opposed to going
through<00:01:47.479> all<00:01:47.659> this<00:01:48.229> like<00:01:48.409> what<00:01:48.590> is<00:01:48.679> a

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
through all this like what is a

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.800 
through all this like what is a
string<00:01:49.219> and<00:01:49.520> what<00:01:49.759> is<00:01:49.850> a<00:01:49.880> list<00:01:50.240> and<00:01:50.509> all<00:01:50.600> stuff

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
string and what is a list and all stuff

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.410 
string and what is a list and all stuff
I'm<00:01:51.740> gonna<00:01:51.890> try<00:01:52.070> to<00:01:52.130> just<00:01:52.399> lump<00:01:52.909> all<00:01:53.090> that<00:01:53.270> in

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
I'm gonna try to just lump all that in

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:54.849 
I'm gonna try to just lump all that in
as<00:01:53.600> we<00:01:53.780> actually<00:01:54.079> start<00:01:54.289> building<00:01:54.469> things

00:01:54.849 --> 00:01:54.859 
as we actually start building things

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:57.580 
as we actually start building things
because<00:01:55.249> I<00:01:56.149> feel<00:01:56.780> like<00:01:56.899> that's<00:01:57.049> the<00:01:57.170> best<00:01:57.380> way

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
because I feel like that's the best way

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.230 
because I feel like that's the best way
to<00:01:57.619> learn<00:01:57.799> to<00:01:57.859> actually<00:01:58.159> see<00:01:58.549> meaningful

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
to learn to actually see meaningful

alright<00:02:13.340> so<00:02:13.580> first<00:02:14.030> things<00:02:14.240> first<00:02:14.300> we<00:02:14.600> need<00:02:14.720> to

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
alright so first things first we need to

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.530 
alright so first things first we need to
go<00:02:14.840> ahead<00:02:14.900> and<00:02:15.080> download<00:02:15.260> Python<00:02:15.910> and<00:02:16.910> what

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
go ahead and download Python and what

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.589 
go ahead and download Python and what
we're<00:02:17.660> going<00:02:17.750> to<00:02:17.810> be<00:02:17.900> using<00:02:18.020> is<00:02:18.260> Python<00:02:18.650> 2<00:02:18.860> 7

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:19.599 
we're going to be using is Python 2 7

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:22.960 
we're going to be using is Python 2 7
well<00:02:20.599> there<00:02:20.750> is<00:02:20.870> a<00:02:20.900> Python<00:02:21.440> 3<00:02:21.680> series<00:02:22.069> but

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
well there is a Python 3 series but

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:24.100 
well there is a Python 3 series but
we're<00:02:23.180> gonna<00:02:23.299> go<00:02:23.450> ahead<00:02:23.629> and<00:02:23.720> get<00:02:23.840> acclimated

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
we're gonna go ahead and get acclimated

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.100 
we're gonna go ahead and get acclimated
to<00:02:24.500> Python<00:02:24.890> 2<00:02:25.040> 7<00:02:25.459> first<00:02:25.730> to<00:02:26.569> 7<00:02:26.810> is<00:02:26.870> gonna<00:02:27.019> be

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
to Python 2 7 first to 7 is gonna be

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:28.780 
to Python 2 7 first to 7 is gonna be
around<00:02:27.319> probably<00:02:27.590> for<00:02:27.830> another<00:02:27.890> 5<00:02:28.250> to<00:02:28.580> 10

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
around probably for another 5 to 10

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.270 
around probably for another 5 to 10
years<00:02:29.060> before<00:02:29.959> it's<00:02:30.260> completely<00:02:30.590> deprecated

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
years before it's completely deprecated

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.119 
years before it's completely deprecated
in<00:02:31.430> the<00:02:32.209> meantime<00:02:32.420> though<00:02:32.840> it<00:02:33.650> is<00:02:33.799> still

00:02:34.119 --> 00:02:34.129 
in the meantime though it is still

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:36.070 
in the meantime though it is still
widely<00:02:34.370> used<00:02:34.940> so<00:02:35.239> that's<00:02:35.420> why<00:02:35.569> we<00:02:35.690> want<00:02:35.900> to<00:02:35.930> use

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
widely used so that's why we want to use

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.680 
widely used so that's why we want to use
Python<00:02:36.349> 2<00:02:36.590> 7<00:02:36.950> before<00:02:37.099> moving<00:02:37.580> to<00:02:37.700> Python<00:02:38.090> 3<00:02:38.150> a

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
Python 2 7 before moving to Python 3 a

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.390 
Python 2 7 before moving to Python 3 a
lot<00:02:39.230> of<00:02:39.349> libraries<00:02:39.500> and<00:02:39.980> things<00:02:40.159> that<00:02:40.310> you're

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
lot of libraries and things that you're

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.130 
lot of libraries and things that you're
gonna<00:02:40.489> need<00:02:40.760> are<00:02:41.060> still<00:02:41.360> only<00:02:41.690> written<00:02:41.870> in

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
gonna need are still only written in

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.350 
gonna need are still only written in
Python<00:02:42.640> 2<00:02:43.640> 7<00:02:44.239> or<00:02:44.959> less<00:02:45.459> but<00:02:46.459> that<00:02:46.519> is<00:02:46.879> changing

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
Python 2 7 or less but that is changing

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.270 
Python 2 7 or less but that is changing
quickly<00:02:47.540> so<00:02:47.989> pretty<00:02:48.260> soon<00:02:48.470> it<00:02:48.830> will<00:02:48.980> be<00:02:49.159> all

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
quickly so pretty soon it will be all

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.460 
quickly so pretty soon it will be all
Python<00:02:49.730> 3.0<00:02:50.629> and<00:02:50.900> and<00:02:51.110> and<00:02:51.470> beyond<00:02:52.540> so<00:02:53.540> let's

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
Python 3.0 and and and beyond so let's

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.250 
Python 3.0 and and and beyond so let's
go<00:02:54.620> ahead<00:02:54.739> and<00:02:55.030> just<00:02:56.030> type<00:02:56.450> in<00:02:56.629> Python<00:02:57.049> so<00:02:57.080> I

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
go ahead and just type in Python so I

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.039 
go ahead and just type in Python so I
gotta<00:02:57.439> do<00:02:58.180> and<00:02:59.180> when<00:02:59.390> you<00:02:59.420> go<00:02:59.540> to<00:02:59.569> python<00:02:59.930> that

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:00.049 
gotta do and when you go to python that

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:01.360 
gotta do and when you go to python that
work<00:03:00.260> we're<00:03:00.470> going<00:03:00.620> to<00:03:00.680> go<00:03:00.830> ahead<00:03:00.950> and

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
work we're going to go ahead and

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.809 
work we're going to go ahead and
download<00:03:02.409> so<00:03:03.409> we<00:03:03.500> go<00:03:03.650> to<00:03:03.709> downloads<00:03:04.280> and<00:03:04.640> i'm

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:04.819 
download so we go to downloads and i'm

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:07.210 
download so we go to downloads and i'm
running<00:03:05.000> on<00:03:05.269> windows<00:03:05.689> it<00:03:06.110> doesn't<00:03:07.069> matter

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
running on windows it doesn't matter

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:08.649 
running on windows it doesn't matter
what<00:03:07.370> operating<00:03:07.700> system<00:03:07.819> you<00:03:08.209> have<00:03:08.390> but<00:03:08.599> we

00:03:08.649 --> 00:03:08.659 
what operating system you have but we

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:10.509 
what operating system you have but we
want<00:03:08.810> to<00:03:08.870> go<00:03:08.930> ahead<00:03:08.989> and<00:03:09.170> grab<00:03:09.370> the<00:03:10.370> latest

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:10.519 
want to go ahead and grab the latest

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:13.420 
want to go ahead and grab the latest
python<00:03:11.150> 2<00:03:11.900> 7<00:03:12.349> so<00:03:12.500> we<00:03:12.590> can<00:03:12.709> just<00:03:12.860> say<00:03:13.010> python

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
python 2 7 so we can just say python

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:18.429 
python 2 7 so we can just say python
release<00:03:13.700> 2<00:03:13.939> 7<00:03:14.269> 8<00:03:16.540> alright<00:03:17.540> and<00:03:17.959> go<00:03:18.170> ahead<00:03:18.260> and

00:03:18.429 --> 00:03:18.439 
release 2 7 8 alright and go ahead and

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:21.250 
release 2 7 8 alright and go ahead and
download<00:03:18.560> the<00:03:19.159> Installer<00:03:19.879> there<00:03:20.329> is<00:03:20.420> a<00:03:20.450> 64-bit

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
download the Installer there is a 64-bit

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.170 
download the Installer there is a 64-bit
version<00:03:21.319> but<00:03:21.980> once<00:03:22.489> again<00:03:22.670> it's<00:03:22.909> another

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
version but once again it's another

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:24.759 
version but once again it's another
problem<00:03:23.629> where<00:03:23.750> there's<00:03:23.930> libraries<00:03:24.590> not

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769 
problem where there's libraries not

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:26.890 
problem where there's libraries not
available<00:03:25.400> in<00:03:25.459> the<00:03:25.549> 64-bit<00:03:26.299> version<00:03:26.360> that

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
available in the 64-bit version that

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.429 
available in the 64-bit version that
would<00:03:27.079> be<00:03:27.230> available<00:03:27.409> in<00:03:27.890> the<00:03:28.099> 32-bit<00:03:28.670> version

00:03:29.429 --> 00:03:29.439 
would be available in the 32-bit version

00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:33.819 
would be available in the 32-bit version
so<00:03:31.569> we'll<00:03:32.569> make<00:03:32.720> sure<00:03:32.840> you<00:03:32.930> get<00:03:33.049> that<00:03:33.200> 32-bit

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:33.829 
so we'll make sure you get that 32-bit

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:35.350 
so we'll make sure you get that 32-bit
version<00:03:34.250> i<00:03:34.370> want<00:03:34.519> to<00:03:34.579> see<00:03:34.730> actually<00:03:35.120> on<00:03:35.150> my

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:44.890 
but this video is to show you guys I
don't<00:03:42.980> stall<00:03:43.219> this<00:03:43.310> write<00:03:43.549> Python<00:03:43.819> d7<00:03:44.689> I'm<00:03:44.780> not

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
don't stall this write Python d7 I'm not

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.740 
don't stall this write Python d7 I'm not
sure<00:03:45.049> which<00:03:45.200> version<00:03:45.230> of<00:03:45.709> Python<00:03:46.040> I<00:03:46.129> have<00:03:46.750> but

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 
sure which version of Python I have but

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:48.699 
sure which version of Python I have but
anyway<00:03:47.959> we're<00:03:48.079> gonna<00:03:48.170> go<00:03:48.319> ahead<00:03:48.379> and<00:03:48.530> install

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:48.709 
anyway we're gonna go ahead and install

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:52.179 
anyway we're gonna go ahead and install
for<00:03:49.040> all<00:03:49.069> users<00:03:49.219> and<00:03:50.829> it's<00:03:51.829> gonna<00:03:51.920> go<00:03:52.099> to

00:03:52.179 --> 00:03:52.189 
for all users and it's gonna go to

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:53.559 
for all users and it's gonna go to
python<00:03:52.489> t7<00:03:52.939> so<00:03:53.030> it's<00:03:53.150> pretty<00:03:53.239> much<00:03:53.360> gonna

00:03:53.559 --> 00:03:53.569 
python t7 so it's pretty much gonna

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:55.929 
python t7 so it's pretty much gonna
overwrite<00:03:54.310> what<00:03:55.310> i<00:03:55.340> already<00:03:55.579> have<00:03:55.700> you<00:03:55.879> can

00:03:55.929 --> 00:03:55.939 
overwrite what i already have you can

00:03:55.939 --> 00:03:57.610 
overwrite what i already have you can
see<00:03:56.150> it's<00:03:56.269> gonna<00:03:56.390> replace<00:03:56.719> my<00:03:56.959> existing<00:03:57.439> one<00:03:57.590> I

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
see it's gonna replace my existing one I

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.619 
see it's gonna replace my existing one I
might<00:03:57.829> have<00:03:57.980> teased<00:03:58.250> 7<00:03:58.700> 7<00:03:59.120> or<00:03:59.239> something<00:03:59.540> like

00:03:59.619 --> 00:03:59.629 
might have teased 7 7 or something like

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:01.750 
might have teased 7 7 or something like
that<00:03:59.840> but<00:04:00.019> they're<00:04:00.950> gonna<00:04:01.040> be<00:04:01.219> pretty<00:04:01.489> much

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 
that but they're gonna be pretty much

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:13.830 
that but they're gonna be pretty much
identical<00:04:01.939> so<00:04:02.599> I<00:04:02.870> don't<00:04:03.799> mind<00:04:03.950> overriding<00:04:04.519> it

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:19.699 

all<00:04:14.840> right

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:21.650 

and<00:04:19.940> we're<00:04:20.940> gonna<00:04:21.030> go<00:04:21.180> ahead<00:04:21.209> and<00:04:21.419> let<00:04:21.539> this

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
and we're gonna go ahead and let this

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:25.340 
and we're gonna go ahead and let this
thing<00:04:21.720> install<00:04:23.210> so<00:04:24.210> all<00:04:24.389> I<00:04:24.419> need<00:04:24.600> to<00:04:24.930> do<00:04:25.110> is

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:25.350 
thing install so all I need to do is

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.710 
thing install so all I need to do is
download<00:04:25.650> and<00:04:26.160> install<00:04:26.580> this<00:04:27.419> I

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
download and install this I

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.850 
download and install this I
can't<00:04:28.440> believe<00:04:28.800> that<00:04:28.830> is<00:04:29.160> all<00:04:29.340> there<00:04:29.610> is<00:04:29.729> to<00:04:29.759> it

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:30.860 
can't believe that is all there is to it

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.050 
can't believe that is all there is to it
alright<00:04:31.860> so<00:04:32.070> um<00:04:32.250> once<00:04:32.520> that<00:04:32.759> is<00:04:32.910> done

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
alright so um once that is done

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.960 
alright so um once that is done
installing<00:04:34.220> we're<00:04:35.220> gonna<00:04:35.310> get<00:04:35.520> a<00:04:35.580> special

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 
installing we're gonna get a special

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:38.090 
installing we're gonna get a special

that<00:04:50.789> we<00:04:50.910> add<00:04:51.060> Python<00:04:51.600> to<00:04:51.870> our<00:04:52.669> our<00:04:53.669> path<00:04:54.030> so

00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:54.389 
that we add Python to our our path so

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:56.839 
that we add Python to our our path so
that<00:04:54.539> way<00:04:54.660> windows<00:04:55.020> knows<00:04:55.289> whenever<00:04:55.770> a<00:04:56.220> Python

so<00:05:07.080> by<00:05:07.830> us<00:05:08.039> adding<00:05:08.400> to<00:05:08.520> the<00:05:08.610> path<00:05:08.820> that'll

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
so by us adding to the path that'll

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:12.140 
so by us adding to the path that'll
change<00:05:09.509> it<00:05:09.720> so<00:05:09.870> click<00:05:10.050> on<00:05:10.199> system<00:05:11.030> go<00:05:12.030> ahead

change it so click on system go ahead

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.689

type<00:05:54.180> Python<00:05:54.750> and<00:05:55.020> you<00:05:55.190> can<00:05:56.190> see<00:05:56.400> that<00:05:56.610> it's

00:05:56.779 --> 00:05:56.789 
type Python and you can see that it's

00:05:56.789 --> 00:05:59.990 
type Python and you can see that it's
launching<00:05:57.449> 2<00:05:57.690> 7<00:05:58.110> 8<00:05:58.229> so<00:05:58.560> just<00:05:59.159> by<00:05:59.280> typing<00:05:59.430> Python

really it in this video this is just the
installation<00:06:11.009> procedure<00:06:11.280> of<00:06:11.970> installing

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:12.360 
installation procedure of installing

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.450 
installation procedure of installing
python<00:06:13.199> on<00:06:13.320> windows<00:06:13.680> and<00:06:13.710> adding<00:06:14.190> it<00:06:14.280> to<00:06:14.370> the

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:14.460 
python on windows and adding it to the

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:17.719 
python on windows and adding it to the
path<00:06:14.639> for<00:06:15.330> some<00:06:15.539> reason<00:06:16.159> should<00:06:17.159> even<00:06:17.460> me<00:06:17.699> I

00:06:17.719 --> 00:06:17.729 
path for some reason should even me I

00:06:17.729 --> 00:06:19.550 
path for some reason should even me I
had<00:06:18.150> problems<00:06:18.570> doing<00:06:18.780> that<00:06:19.020> the<00:06:19.110> first<00:06:19.320> time

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:19.560

00:06:22.089 --> 00:06:22.099 
around I think I never came from like a

00:06:22.099 --> 00:06:24.499 
around I think I never came from like a
school<00:06:23.099> that<00:06:23.310> said<00:06:23.520> hey<00:06:23.669> do<00:06:23.909> this<00:06:24.090> step<00:06:24.330> by

00:06:24.499 --> 00:06:24.509 
school that said hey do this step by

00:06:24.509 --> 00:06:25.850 
school that said hey do this step by
step<00:06:24.539> or<00:06:24.900> whatever<00:06:25.110> so<00:06:25.320> I<00:06:25.349> remember<00:06:25.560> being

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:25.860 
step or whatever so I remember being

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:27.700 
step or whatever so I remember being
like<00:06:25.949> why<00:06:26.190> the<00:06:26.639> doesn't<00:06:26.880> this<00:06:27.120> work<00:06:27.360> but

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:27.710 
like why the doesn't this work but

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:30.500 
like why the doesn't this work but
that<00:06:28.710> is<00:06:28.889> why<00:06:29.219> you<00:06:29.279> need<00:06:29.610> to<00:06:29.760> install<00:06:30.120> it<00:06:30.330> add

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:30.510 
that is why you need to install it add

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:32.010 
that is why you need to install it add
it<00:06:30.630> to<00:06:30.840> your<00:06:30.930> path

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:32.020 
it to your path

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:34.160 
it to your path
and<00:06:32.110> then<00:06:32.470> Windows<00:06:32.800> knows<00:06:33.010> how<00:06:33.460> to<00:06:33.520> handle<00:06:33.700> it

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:34.170 
and then Windows knows how to handle it

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:36.210 
and then Windows knows how to handle it

some<00:06:40.420> stuff<00:06:40.630> with<00:06:41.080> Python<00:06:41.530> alright<00:06:42.460> talk<00:06:42.850> to

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:42.910 
some stuff with Python alright talk to

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:47.370 
some stuff with Python alright talk to
y'all<00:06:43.120> later<00:06:43.150> bye<00:06:45.300> so<00:06:46.300> if<00:06:46.480> this<00:06:47.080> thing

y'all later bye so if this thing

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:50.100 
y'all later bye so if this thing
does<00:06:47.620> not<00:06:47.650> work<00:06:48.130> when<00:06:48.340> typing<00:06:48.550> Python<00:06:49.300> inside

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:50.110 
does not work when typing Python inside

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:52.470 
does not work when typing Python inside
the<00:06:50.320> command<00:06:50.680> prompt<00:06:51.310> then<00:06:52.090> I<00:06:52.240> should

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:52.480 
the command prompt then I should

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:54.810 
the command prompt then I should
probably<00:06:52.720> check<00:06:53.230> my<00:06:53.440> path<00:06:53.740> variables<00:06:54.550> again

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:54.820 
probably check my path variables again

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:57.510 
probably check my path variables again
because<00:06:55.330> they're<00:06:55.540> probably<00:06:56.440> up<00:06:56.620> this

00:06:57.510 --> 00:06:57.520 
because they're probably up this

is good to know I'm well on my way to
becoming<00:07:00.640> a<00:07:00.820> badass<00:07:01.030> programming

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:14.890 
becoming a badass programming

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:14.900
