00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:18.109
 how come it does not surprise me 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:22.259
 because our favorite destinations brazil like two rivers that are 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:25.289
 Inmates can be separated again 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.800
 in each of your fatal turns you will find me 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.950
 and the free will that you said you had what happened with that 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:38.710
 you still have it and that is precisely why I am here and now 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.409
 It was your machinations that set my destiny in motion 

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:46.920
 the coin that you throw that has fallen to land now you must assume the result 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.760
 the coin is still in the air of rasilla 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.870
 to reach an acceptable conclusion for both 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.620
 which best suits our future 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.450
 and we should not be resurrected 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:01.580
 because you do not want it 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:05.340
 nor free will is exercised only when it coincides with your whim 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:11.430
 there is much more at stake than you think so and it is already I do not know and that has 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:18.060
 the answers you want you should trust me rashid our intentions to 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.159
 us and for our future 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.060
 They are not so different I should trust you 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.230
 or what 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:29.740
 I did not come here to threaten the earth, though, and you say that while holding 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.390
 hundred hand the instrument of my doom once I save you from the 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.340
 dryer 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.050
 I do not intend to imprison Tevez he made his sheet at least not until 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:40.920
 your plans do not require it 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.400
 you are not the only one who takes a chance 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.520
 may it carry the instrument of its destruction 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.830
 but I also exposed myself when coming here 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.360
 or is that you have not noticed 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.450
 that they had the only weapon that can kill me 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.520
 then you know what it is today 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.770
 and what you are brain that exists 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.030
 and you still think that you can manipulate me as a pawn 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.509
 think twice about them 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.989
 peace transhumes and he 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:17.019
 If we are what we are, we are not destined to fight to the death for 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:20.019
 decide the fate of our do not be silly 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:22.609
 I will not fight with you 

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:26.629
 and that will be the prophesied battle of the heroes I win because you do not 

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:28.809
 you want to fight with me 

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:33.429
 the powerful that ing scion of the future saving balance that we 

00:02:33.429 --> 00:02:33.979
 cost 

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:37.289
 surrender even before the lost battle begins 

00:02:39.929 --> 00:02:41.459
 very well 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:44.459
 if this will make you wait for the rest 

00:02:45.929 --> 00:02:48.199
 now you are going to listen to me 

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:51.439
 the heart of darkness must remain hidden 

00:02:51.999 --> 00:02:55.099
 its use would cause a great evil 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:58.579
 then you do not know where it is 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:02:59.449
 do not 

00:02:59.449 --> 00:03:01.349
 you never looked for it 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:04.070
 that does not matter racial listen to me 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:08.110
 you must understand that all creatures are linked to a path 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:13.409
 predetermined we are all chained to the wheel of destiny 

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:14.529
 trust me 

00:03:14.529 --> 00:03:17.659
 I know that better than you all but one 

00:03:18.469 --> 00:03:20.749
 because of your recreation 

00:03:20.749 --> 00:03:26.709
 you are the only detached creature the only one among all of us who has 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:28.639
 The free will 

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:31.439
 uu you can choose racial 

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:34.439
 and of course I must do it in your address 

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:38.429
 your pawn has reached the end of the board that ine 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:42.390
 and now my powers surpass even yours 

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:46.569
 it is ironic that the creature that makes this 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:49.899
 it has turned out to be your downfall 

00:03:49.899 --> 00:03:51.989
 now let's finish with this 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:54.989
 once and for all 

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:13.639
 uu 

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:21.529
 down 

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:26.229
 one 

00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:31.939
 posse 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.860
 pain for the conqueror 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.879
 I have found the heart of darkness 

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:43.210
 I remove 1 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:44.710
 you'll get lost 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:47.710
 loves 

00:04:57.199 --> 00:04:59.039
 Kevin Avila Scoreboard 

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:03.379
 the madness of this place had fueled my anger in some way 

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:05.560
 and as it dissipated 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.300
 I had no feeling of joy 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:09.900
 nor of victory 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.050
 just the quiet certainty that once again 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:16.099
 we had fallen blindly into the trap of our enemies 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:21.780
 I could not be sure if whoever had really tried to destroy me and 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.780
 it seemed that now she would never know 

00:05:25.839 --> 00:05:27.240
 in my absence 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:31.979
 the area had been invaded by the moebius soldiers he hoped that no 

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:36.210
 they would have found the entrance to the crypt or discovered the body of plains 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:39.699
 devourer there was no trace 

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:41.169
 he was doing it 

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:43.490
 conquering peldehue 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:46.490
 I understand that we should congratulate p 

00:05:48.589 --> 00:05:50.909
 finally this death 

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:55.069
 I suppose you expect reciprocal congratulations for the devouring death 

00:05:55.069 --> 00:05:57.449
 everything has escaped you 

00:05:57.449 --> 00:05:59.189
 we have him 

00:05:59.189 --> 00:06:02.189
 although not without a considerable price in blood 

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:04.500
 that will have pleased him 

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:06.690
 already be pleased as much as you want 

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:11.360
 we will cut off his head and all the vampires of the boys will finally be 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.040
 dead and that knowledge that will please you 

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:21.250
 you also address to your death prada a true servant the only 

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:22.069
 throw us 

00:06:22.069 --> 00:06:26.770
 death never that marks the idea in 

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:31.490
 to know that I have fulfilled my part in the plans of our support 

00:06:32.379 --> 00:06:33.430
 their 

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:36.430
 is finally destroyed pitu 

00:06:37.089 --> 00:06:40.550
 he has done the feat 

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:43.800
 al in the two heroes do you think that is that hour 

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:46.700
 the vaulter of the vampires 

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:48.960
 or in the other 

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:50.999
 you have to your account that we 

00:06:50.999 --> 00:06:55.549
 we did not care who thinks country was and is as long as the result was 

00:06:55.549 --> 00:06:58.089
 the same 

00:06:58.089 --> 00:06:59.930
 iago sea 

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:00.760
 MedellÃ­n is 

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:02.240
 every woman 

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:03.639
 really 

00:07:03.639 --> 00:07:07.490
 I could not do to tell you about it and that everything was ready 

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:11.300
 until the last step 

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:15.360
 and that unthinking that I had free will everything 

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:16.839
 but you have it 

00:07:16.839 --> 00:07:22.129
 and there is the greatest triumph of all having created it that the only player 

00:07:22.129 --> 00:07:24.150
 what prompted him to choose 

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:27.300
 and if it is exactly what we wanted 

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:30.300
 via and has made my faithful servant 

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:32.809
 and now 

00:07:32.809 --> 00:07:34.809
 I have an execution to attend
