up with like three attachments it just

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.240 
up with like three attachments it just
makes<00:00:51.120> them<00:00:51.210> so<00:00:51.420> much<00:00:51.570> better<00:00:51.809> so<00:00:52.170> we<00:00:52.949> throw

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
makes them so much better so we throw

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.560 
makes them so much better so we throw
the<00:00:53.399> quick-draw<00:00:53.789> in<00:00:53.910> there<00:00:54.090> since<00:00:54.360> it's

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
the quick-draw in there since it's

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.260 
the quick-draw in there since it's
already<00:00:54.750> an<00:00:55.050> SMG<00:00:55.440> and<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:55.829> scopes<00:00:56.190> fast<00:00:56.489> going

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
already an SMG and a scopes fast going

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.090 
already an SMG and a scopes fast going
the<00:00:57.390> quick-draw<00:00:57.780> handle<00:00:58.170> on<00:00:58.289> their<00:00:58.500> helps<00:00:58.949> you

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
the quick-draw handle on their helps you

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.670 
the quick-draw handle on their helps you
scope<00:00:59.399> even<00:00:59.699> faster<00:01:00.239> in<00:01:00.809> close<00:01:01.170> quarters

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
scope even faster in close quarters

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.429 
scope even faster in close quarters
situations<00:01:02.340> mecosta<00:01:03.180> which<00:01:03.960> is<00:01:04.080> always<00:01:04.199> good

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
situations mecosta which is always good

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.130 
situations mecosta which is always good
and<00:01:04.710> then<00:01:04.979> I<00:01:05.280> put<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.299> foregrip<00:01:06.720> on<00:01:06.930> there

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
and then I put the foregrip on there

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.140 
and then I put the foregrip on there
just<00:01:07.409> to<00:01:07.560> reduce<00:01:07.770> recoil<00:01:08.070> just<00:01:08.640> makes<00:01:08.790> a<00:01:08.939> lot

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
just to reduce recoil just makes a lot

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.969 
just to reduce recoil just makes a lot
easier<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.479> shoot<00:01:09.659> at<00:01:09.810> longer<00:01:10.140> ranges<00:01:10.650> because

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
easier to shoot at longer ranges because

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.550 
easier to shoot at longer ranges because
it<00:01:11.460> is<00:01:11.670> an<00:01:11.820> SMG<00:01:12.119> so<00:01:12.510> it<00:01:12.659> isn't<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:12.960> best<00:01:13.200> for

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
it is an SMG so it isn't the best for

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.289 
it is an SMG so it isn't the best for
super<00:01:13.830> long<00:01:13.979> range<00:01:14.250> so<00:01:14.460> adding<00:01:14.729> that<00:01:14.850> for<00:01:15.119> grip

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
super long range so adding that for grip

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:16.940 
super long range so adding that for grip
on<00:01:15.450> there<00:01:15.659> give<00:01:16.170> us<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.439> extra<00:01:16.710> little

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
on there give us the extra little

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.780 
on there give us the extra little
advantage<00:01:17.479> but<00:01:18.479> and<00:01:18.960> then<00:01:19.380> also<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.950> FMJ<00:01:20.460> even

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
advantage but and then also the FMJ even

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.910 
advantage but and then also the FMJ even
though<00:01:20.880> this<00:01:21.090> weapon<00:01:21.990> is<00:01:22.140> basically<00:01:22.680> almost

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
though this weapon is basically almost

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.060 
though this weapon is basically almost
the<00:01:23.220> ultimate<00:01:23.640> killing<00:01:23.850> machine<00:01:23.970> I<00:01:24.530> throw<00:01:25.530> FMJ

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
the ultimate killing machine I throw FMJ

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.800 
the ultimate killing machine I throw FMJ
on<00:01:26.189> there<00:01:26.400> to<00:01:26.549> just<00:01:26.759> do<00:01:26.970> even<00:01:27.240> better<00:01:27.390> just

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
on there to just do even better just

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.899 
on there to just do even better just
kills<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.259> people<00:01:28.590> just<00:01:29.040> that<00:01:29.220> much<00:01:29.369> faster

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
kills the people just that much faster

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.969 
kills the people just that much faster

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
this class I have you look right up here

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.790 
this class I have you look right up here
I<00:01:40.170> have<00:01:40.500> hard<00:01:40.799> line<00:01:41.070> on<00:01:41.100> and<00:01:41.640> then<00:01:42.450> I

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:43.800 
I have hard line on and then I

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.910 
I have hard line on and then I
toughness<00:01:44.800> and<00:01:45.070> dexterity<00:01:45.690> so<00:01:46.690> I<00:01:47.140> use

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
toughness and dexterity so I use

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.650 
toughness and dexterity so I use
toughness<00:01:48.400> and<00:01:48.550> dexterity<00:01:48.910> on<00:01:49.150> every<00:01:49.390> blast

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:49.660 
toughness and dexterity on every blast

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.230 
toughness and dexterity on every blast
they're<00:01:50.290> kind<00:01:50.470> of<00:01:50.650> given<00:01:51.160> when<00:01:51.370> I'm<00:01:51.490> firing<00:01:51.820> I

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
they're kind of given when I'm firing I

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.500 
they're kind of given when I'm firing I
don't<00:01:52.870> want<00:01:53.020> to<00:01:53.110> have<00:01:53.290> to<00:01:53.560> be<00:01:54.490> missing<00:01:55.270> because

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:55.510 
don't want to have to be missing because

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:57.540 
don't want to have to be missing because
they<00:01:55.870> shoot<00:01:56.110> back<00:01:56.320> at<00:01:56.350> me<00:01:56.650> so<00:01:56.860> toughness<00:01:57.280> helps

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:57.550 
they shoot back at me so toughness helps

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.550 
they shoot back at me so toughness helps
me<00:01:57.640> out<00:01:57.700> with<00:01:57.790> that<00:01:58.000> then<00:01:58.660> dexterity<00:01:59.260> just

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
me out with that then dexterity just

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.380 
me out with that then dexterity just
helps<00:01:59.830> the<00:01:59.950> mantel<00:02:00.310> object<00:02:00.640> faster<00:02:01.060> which<00:02:01.210> is

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
helps the mantel object faster which is

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.630 
helps the mantel object faster which is
just<00:02:01.930> good<00:02:02.200> all<00:02:02.440> around<00:02:02.470> and<00:02:03.100> when<00:02:03.520> you're

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
just good all around and when you're

just good all around and when you're
running<00:02:04.380> through<00:02:05.380> enemy<00:02:05.710> territory<00:02:05.740> it<00:02:06.700> helps

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
running through enemy territory it helps

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.910 
running through enemy territory it helps
you<00:02:07.360> scope<00:02:07.630> in<00:02:07.840> right<00:02:08.170> after<00:02:08.440> running<00:02:08.649> which

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920
