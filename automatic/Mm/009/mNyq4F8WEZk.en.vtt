00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.770
 hi all guys , it's always me 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.629
 league on the 90 and well found today 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.639
 on my channel with this fantastic 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.309
 video game strikes i feel forced 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.900
 especially in the most interested sector 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.490
 both in multiplayer 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.670
 finally this is the first gameplay of 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.260
 bf 4 online that I have the honor of being able to 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.660
 show on this channel is definitely 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.670
 it won't be the last one then a small one 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.740
 introduction to the game this is one 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.480
 domination as you can guess played 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.550
 here is a small smartphone 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:33.270
 echo some minutes today 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.890
 to make you a little curious about how much 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.370
 concerns flying 4 a small one 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.469
 match with the sniper slip where 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.260
 short, but I'm pretty Cavicchia ta 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.629
 in this beloved a map is very much drawn 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.120
 a nice but confusing map 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.800
 because this is because the numerous 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.960
 presence of these trees that we can 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.460
 then throwing two is however renders 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.170
 sometimes difficult to identify enemies 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.670
 and with it is not an easy map is not one 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.829
 easy map and I like this because 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.300
 it will mean that in short I will not have to 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.940
 play with it a few times to never succeed 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.710
 to find at ease anyway I am 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.869
 very excited this is the first one that 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.760
 prevented f4 as I said one of the 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.650
 games that I most awaited the version that 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.270
 you are seeing logically which is the 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.130
 PC version in short, the best 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.189
 version is possible that we can 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:20.340
 find in the web can be found as well 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:22.259
 just here's the game configuration is 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.360
 more or less all at high and some things 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.100
 to ultra so in short to make 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.200
 graphically the best possible 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.869
 unfortunately I forgot when 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:36.090
 I was recording to show you the frames anyway 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:39.119
 I'm playing it with a gtx 76 77 69 one 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.890
 6 70 here the game is fine 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.549
 compared to the beta where it is 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:47.430
 could the races in short sparkle watts at a 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:50.340
 sometimes even the game with a 7 with 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:53.280
 a 6 70 gtx runs very well 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:57.060
 over sixty frames say 60 the 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:59.759
 then 70 min is 80, however, perfect 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.340
 it really plays divinely and then on pc 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:06.840
 in short, the fps always make is a 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:08.170
 anyway, here I tell you immediately one 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.119
 what are you seeing 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.310
 number of bullets with the barrel 10 e 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.020
 zero you know what you have in mind that 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.020
 charging system that had been 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:18.790
 tried on xbox ie what if i 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.349
 reloads throw the charger away and 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.849
 you lose shots that you said here 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:24.459
 works exactly this way e 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:26.590
 therefore he cannot lose that nervous tic 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:28.959
 I've always had in shooters either 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.900
 to recharge even with string one 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:34.269
 single shot I tic the need 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.830
 to recharge continuously at each 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:38.830
 blow and those kids born with these bats 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:43.000
 effective look here 12 but yes 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:44.590
 let's exaggerate 3 panettoncini 10 4 babÃ¹ e 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.180
 I'm too excited about this gameplay 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.440
 looks like a person under the influence of 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.769
 affects mine but it's not like that for boys 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.180
 I'll I can play I know maybe maybe 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:54.040
 you would like a little quieter reading 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.870
 but then there will be a way to be quiet 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.299
 soon with antonio is where we will go 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:01.540
 just also say more about the game from 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:03.250
 everything from classes in how to play 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.930
 how not to play above all how not 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.000
 I always play very well 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.980
 but in fact we were talking about that 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.540
 tic nervous guys when you have to 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.030
 recharge your weapons remember 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.380
 always do not recharge even if you have 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.329
 shot four or five shots because 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.250
 otherwise you lose an entire magazine e 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:19.780
 now in these first games yes 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.489
 they really find very little support 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.470
 so very few people give you 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:25.180
 the ammunition at least so at the beginning 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.370
 because a meta people try to shoot a 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.799
 little classes and support poses is not the 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.150
 more used here and then 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:32.350
 hardly find the ammunition in 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.260
 around I found myself already different 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:36.519
 situations in front of the enemy with zero 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.650
 you hear I have no shots in the charger 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:40.150
 we can be friends and we can take them 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.250
 unfortunately his answer 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.859
 generally it was of the title that me 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.540
 it dried out therefore no smeared screens 

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:48.850
 mice and ammunition is fine though 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:51.010
 guys then this is basically it 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:52.720
 just a video a little so an outburst 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:55.690
 of my happiness towards 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.690

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:59.980
 series of gameplay guys so if you 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:01.600

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:07.090
 right for pictures but if the four but vi 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:09.250

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:11.109
 gameplay per week or at least commitments 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:11.690

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:14.540
