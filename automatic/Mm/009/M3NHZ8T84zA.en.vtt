00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:50.760 
do not see it because I doubt that Rios

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:53.030 
do not see it because I doubt that Rios
is<00:06:50.880> gonna<00:06:51.090> be<00:06:51.300> wanting<00:06:51.690> a<00:06:51.870> packet<00:06:52.620> coming

00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:56.520 
forward at him it's just that Rios I

00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:00.070 
forward at him it's just that Rios I
expect<00:06:57.479> to<00:06:57.600> see<00:06:57.780> a<00:06:58.400> improvement<00:06:59.400> and<00:06:59.550> defense

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:00.080 
expect to see a improvement and defense

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:05.110
