00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:14.980
 that I'm going to create a new section here 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:16.779
 in the channel and you are asking about 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.490
 what created a new section if I have 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:20.230
 so many that are inactive and the 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.270
 main reason is that I'm going to join all 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.759

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:26.320
 section that will receive the name of coffee 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:27.880
 Break wanted to create a section in which 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.040
 I could talk about pre books from a 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.329
 perspective a little different and that is 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.739
 we will talk about books that have been 

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:33.899
 become movies books 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:36.160
 they have turned into television series 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.629
 series or movies that I would love to have 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.550
 they were books my favorite authors 

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:41.530
 others that I have not liked so much 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.570
 characters that I love or those that 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.610
 I hate all this kind of stuff 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.930
 I would love to talk with you in the 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:51.260
 coffee time so only 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:54.250
 we need two things an idea and 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.250
 a chapter 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.990
 you want a little to inaugurate this 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.670
 section l decided to choose the saga of 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:02.530
 vampiric chronicles books of lj 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.059
 smith who as you know also has 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.770
 his television series to lose already 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:07.210
 you will see that it is broadcast in the baby appointment 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.980
 Legista universe long ago 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.900
 before it will start broadcasting the series 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:12.190
 of television and that's just read 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.840
 the twilight books of stephanie 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.360
 meyer and I liked the universe so much 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.520
 vampiric that I decided to join the new 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.200
 books of lj smith although there was also 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.360
 read the vampire chronicle books 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.550
 of anne rice that are night and day 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.990
 in terms of vampire literature I think 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:28.300
 that are currently published 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.610
 six or seven volumes of this novel in 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.500
 Spanish maybe six sure and I 've 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.880
 was read fifth part because the 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.009
 truth is that I started seeing them in 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.420
 I like television a lot more than 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:38.860
 I saw them I'm going to tell you a little bit of what 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.390
 is the plot of the novels if not the 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.860
 you have read the story focuses on 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.390
 elena gilbert who is a young 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.490
 teenager who just lost his 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.259
 parents in a traffic accident and the 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.479
 return to the institute is with 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:51.310
 that has a new partner that is this 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:53.830
 east fans more saviors of the typical 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.300
 mysterious boy handsome and sexy but that 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.800
 hides a great secret that in that see 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.570
 will try to discover and that is a 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.100
 vampire but is a vampire of good 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.210
 why do not you drink agroman cheer up 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.650
 people 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.150
 the rise since it became good 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:06.700
 practically since it becomes a 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:08.560
 Vampire has been lamenting who he is and 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.390
 of what it is and on the other hand we have the 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.400
 third protagonist in this triangle 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.709
 loving that is the old savior the 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.569
 brother of stephanie also vampire and 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:18.340
 He is the bad relationship so 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:21.489
 we have saviors was the typical guy 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.170
 bad arrogant arrogant and above all 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:25.450
 pretty pretty edge of which all 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.620
 sure we fell in love and we have 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.390
 the value and the truth is that to me 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.220
 love it if I have to choose between 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.020
 demon estefan obviously I'm staying with 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.730
 I like a lot more about the bad boy 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.680
 so the stories of the chronicles 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.090
 vampiric in state novel before the 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.410
 enac and see how is knowing the world 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.390
 of the vampires how it is decanting 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.160
 for one brother on the other the things that 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.750
 they are happening in the institute and about 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.730
 all your new life of the world 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.680
 supernatural the plots of history 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.209
 they are quite linear I think they are very 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.700
 poor could be developed 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:53.200
 a much stronger way the truth is 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.970
 that nadal and albert does not react 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.110
 way beyond the knowledge of 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.730
 this new world the truth is that this 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.410
 It is something that surprises me much 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.150
 everything is so easy in the novels 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.590
 and that yes it is marked more in the series 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.420
 I started the rereading of these books 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.710
 two or three months ago I remembered that 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.590
 I liked it a lot more 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:09.970
 and I left it in the fourth volume so 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.500
 actually I'm going for the fifth one because the 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.030
 first reading I stayed in the fifth in 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.650
 First of all I want to mention elena no 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.660
 I like it for nothing as a character because 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:19.180
 the novels is pretty dependent is 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:22.240
 capricious is conceited is basically 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.590
 I do not like a potential manipulator 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.270
 for nothing the perspective that has given 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.200
 this character in the novels and the 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:28.150
 truth is that I would have created a 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.500
 character a little bit stronger and that 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.450
 I was more prepared for the world in 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.730
 the one that will touch him while living 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:35.290
 close to damon and stefan regarding the 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.660
 rest of the characters I want to mention 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.940
 two that have surprised me a lot in 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:42.550
 Regarding the relationship novel and series of 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:45.490
 television and those are bonnie and caroline 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:46.870
 in the novels of lj smith caroline and 

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:48.880
 bolis or practically characters 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.560
 secondary to those who do not give them any 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.330
 matter I go yes that is witch in the 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.580
 novels but it 's pretty like just 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:56.260
 it does not magic and they are pretty 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:58.480
 quite light does not have a very 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.100
 protagonist and caroline is the typical 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.320
 cocky from the first season of the 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:04.000
 television series and from there it's not going to happen 

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:06.310
 or at least as far as I've stayed 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.320
 of the novels of the saga and the truth is 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.580
 that these are characters that if not 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:11.660
 I would have seen the television series 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.550
 they would have gone totally unnoticed 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:14.900
 so let's talk about the series 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:16.220
 have you ever heard that the 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:19.610
 books are a thousand times that movies 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:21.410
 yes I am sure that yes under my 

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:21.950
 point of view the television headquarters of the 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:23.840
 appointment 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:26.150
 is a thousand times better than the saga of books 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.130
 of vampiric chronicles of lj es 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:30.860
 just say three things from those of 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:32.450
 television plot characters and 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.860
 teenagers I started the series of 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:35.570
 television practically from the first 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:38.030
 chapter when they started issuing the 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:40.220
 quotes I saw her english subtitled me 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:42.470
 really liked how the first one started 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:44.360
 season was amazing if you could tell 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:46.460
 certain similarities between novels and 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:48.500
 the television series but there were some 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:49.460
 things that taught me a little bit and that 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.570
 are I think what I 've done that I 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:52.340
 I fell in love with the series of 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:53.600
 television that of books obviously 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.980
 the plot of the TV has 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.840
 have to be much more complex because they have 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:58.430
 that give rise to many chapters and many 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.500
 seasons that is what we will talk about more 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:02.410
 ahead and that is that they have achieved 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:05.150
 perfect mix of teen vampires 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:06.530
 witches and werewolves the truth is that 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:08.810
 I liked this combination is 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:10.610
 incredible has a lot of strength and I think 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:12.350
 that is largely by the writers 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.990
 and for the characters because if 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:16.700
 we had to transport the 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:17.390
 characters from the novels to the series of 

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:20.800
 TV 

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:23.470
 that had come out a pretty series 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:25.210
 You're a bit shabby from my point of 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:26.889
 view and I think the perspective that has 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:28.870
 given the new characters in the series 

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:29.889
 of television is incredible now I'm going 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:32.259
 to talk about two of my characters 

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:34.419
 preferred ones that are damon and caroline in 

00:05:32.259 --> 00:05:35.770
 obviously the first damon 

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:37.240
 novels I had loved so I 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:38.800
 I was dying to see how I had 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:40.360
 plasma television headquarters 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:42.669
 the choice of this actor has been 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:44.620
 perfect knows how to embody the character to the 

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:46.360
 perfection and the truth is that I was left 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:47.740
 pledged of this actor already the second 

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.629
 character he wants to talk about is 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:51.129
 Caroline is a character that I do not 

00:05:49.629 --> 00:05:52.479
 I would have set for nothing in the saga of 

00:05:51.129 --> 00:05:54.580
 books but I have noticed 

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:55.719
 very much in the television series and 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:57.639
 I can say it's my character 

00:05:55.719 --> 00:05:59.129
 preferred of the whole saga because 

00:05:57.639 --> 00:06:01.300
 start being the typical girl 

00:05:59.129 --> 00:06:03.639
 superficial the young woman is from the institute 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:05.620
 that is focused on social life the 

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:06.909
 fame in popularity but also 

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:09.039
 has a little complicated life 

00:06:06.909 --> 00:06:10.750
 but above all I think that his life improves 

00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:12.460
 changes radically and improves as 

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:13.780
 person since he becomes 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:16.060
 vampire from the second season 

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:17.229
 hundred and eight spoilers another of the 

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:18.580
 things I wanted to comment on is what 

00:06:17.229 --> 00:06:20.530
 It happens with many television series 

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:22.240
 that are currently on the air and is that 

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:24.159
 they are greatly lengthening the amount 

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:25.330
 of seasons that you will attribute to 

00:06:24.159 --> 00:06:27.069
 a series 

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:28.930
 because a series has many more 

00:06:27.069 --> 00:06:30.550
 seasons is worse than another that has 

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:32.020
 very few of television series that 

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:34.569
 they cancel them after one or two seasons 

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:35.949
 because they do not have much appeal for the 

00:06:34.569 --> 00:06:37.780
 public but from other series as per 

00:06:35.949 --> 00:06:40.300
 example pompeya erase that if it is 

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:42.280
 attracting a large audience 

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:43.629
 such is the success of pompeii 

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:45.250
 You see they have decided to create a new 

00:06:43.629 --> 00:06:46.960
 spin off that is from original is 

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:48.430
 based on the history of some of the 

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:50.860
 characters that appear in the plot 

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:53.080
 paper principal tie-breaks as are 

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:54.879
 Klaus and his sister have decided 

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:56.169
 create a new television headquarters which 

00:06:54.879 --> 00:06:57.550
 I think it's pretty bad 

00:06:56.169 --> 00:06:59.139
 exploited because there should be 

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:01.090
 got Caroline inside that story 

00:06:59.139 --> 00:07:02.740
 because every time and Carl Landry in very 

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:04.479
 good chemistry together wants to confess that 

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:06.099
 I still have not seen the original and the 

00:07:04.479 --> 00:07:07.900
 main reason is that I still have not 

00:07:06.099 --> 00:07:09.879
 updated with the vampire series 

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:11.379
 diaries I think I stayed in the the 

00:07:09.879 --> 00:07:13.360
 fourth season roughly halfway through 

00:07:11.379 --> 00:07:15.400
 season and is that I usually land 

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:16.659
 follow chapter by chapter all the 

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:18.759
 weeks but in the end it has 

00:07:16.659 --> 00:07:20.080
 impossible result to follow that rhythm like this 

00:07:18.759 --> 00:07:21.400
 than from doing a web marathon or 

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:23.379
 finish the seasons for me a 

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:25.990
 marathon are basically a night of 

00:07:23.379 --> 00:07:28.210
 cinema on the sofa with a blanket and a bowl 

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:29.710
 of popcorn and they are about 12 13 chapters 

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:30.779
 flip so when I catch up 

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:33.009
 with the fourth season 

00:07:30.779 --> 00:07:34.389
 and then with the fifth I think that 

00:07:33.009 --> 00:07:36.339
 I will start to see originals because I 

00:07:34.389 --> 00:07:37.900
 They have commented that it is also very annoying 

00:07:36.339 --> 00:07:39.789
 everything I had to commented on the 

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:41.529
 vampire diaries as it would be television 

00:07:39.789 --> 00:07:43.270
 and as a saga of books written by lj 

00:07:41.529 --> 00:07:45.069
