a fucking roll quote I'm telling you

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:21.349 
a fucking roll quote I'm telling you
this<00:04:20.070> even<00:04:20.489> in<00:04:20.549> the<00:04:20.640> Republican<00:04:20.760> Party's

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
this even in the Republican Party's

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:24.440 
this even in the Republican Party's
darkest<00:04:22.169> hour<00:04:22.500> the<00:04:22.950> president<00:04:23.610> will<00:04:24.120> still

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
darkest hour the president will still

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:25.350 
darkest hour the president will still

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.210 
give them
so<00:04:25.509> what<00:04:25.720> they<00:04:25.900> want<00:04:26.169> my<00:04:26.680> guess<00:04:26.919> is<00:04:27.099> that

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 
so what they want my guess is that

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:28.890 
so what they want my guess is that
liberals<00:04:27.639> will<00:04:27.759> be<00:04:27.909> stunned<00:04:28.449> at<00:04:28.780> the

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900 
liberals will be stunned at the

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.710 
liberals will be stunned at the
concessions<00:04:29.560> President<00:04:30.039> Obama<00:04:30.280> makes<00:04:30.720> even

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720 
concessions President Obama makes even

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.360 
concessions President Obama makes even
when<00:04:31.900> he<00:04:32.020> had<00:04:32.139> the<00:04:32.229> Republicans<00:04:32.800> in<00:04:32.919> a<00:04:32.979> corner

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
when he had the Republicans in a corner

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.209 
when he had the Republicans in a corner
and<00:04:33.580> totally<00:04:34.539> defeated<00:04:34.930> and<00:04:35.860> guess<00:04:36.039> what

00:04:36.209 --> 00:04:36.219 
and totally defeated and guess what

00:04:36.219 --> 00:04:38.670 
and totally defeated and guess what
happened<00:04:36.580> guys<00:04:37.139> Republicans<00:04:38.139> in<00:04:38.229> a<00:04:38.289> corner

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
happened guys Republicans in a corner

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.800 
happened guys Republicans in a corner
totally<00:04:39.129> defeated<00:04:39.430> and<00:04:39.969> President<00:04:40.539> Obama

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
totally defeated and President Obama

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:42.749 
totally defeated and President Obama
gives<00:04:41.139> them<00:04:41.439> their<00:04:41.650> prized<00:04:41.979> possession

00:04:42.749 --> 00:04:42.759 
gives them their prized possession

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:46.260 
gives them their prized possession
cutting<00:04:43.449> Social<00:04:43.810> Security<00:04:44.490> one<00:04:45.490> last<00:04:45.759> quote<00:04:46.000> I

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
cutting Social Security one last quote I

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:48.779 
cutting Social Security one last quote I
think<00:04:47.199> we<00:04:47.259> can<00:04:47.379> all<00:04:47.500> at<00:04:47.650> least<00:04:47.830> agree<00:04:48.129> that<00:04:48.370> if

00:04:48.779 --> 00:04:48.789 
think we can all at least agree that if

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:50.100 
think we can all at least agree that if
ever<00:04:49.000> there<00:04:49.240> was<00:04:49.300> a<00:04:49.360> time<00:04:49.449> to<00:04:49.870> press

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110 
ever there was a time to press

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:52.140 
ever there was a time to press
progressive<00:04:50.949> priorities<00:04:51.430> this<00:04:51.639> would<00:04:51.849> be<00:04:52.000> it

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.150 
progressive priorities this would be it

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:54.510 
progressive priorities this would be it
so<00:04:52.780> this<00:04:52.990> will<00:04:53.199> be<00:04:53.319> a<00:04:53.349> true<00:04:53.620> test<00:04:53.650> of<00:04:54.159> who<00:04:54.340> he<00:04:54.490> is

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 
so this will be a true test of who he is

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.300 
so this will be a true test of who he is
and<00:04:55.000> what<00:04:55.330> he<00:04:55.539> believes<00:04:55.930> let's<00:04:56.919> see<00:04:57.099> what<00:04:57.250> he

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.310 
and what he believes let's see what he

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:00.170 
and what he believes let's see what he
