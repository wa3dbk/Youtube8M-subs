00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:08.419
 hello my name is stanislav 

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:10.639
 Vasiliev and in my hand the most ordinary 

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:13.519
 hamburg with incredible nourishing strength 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:15.049
 in two hundred and fifty kilocalories so they 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:16.609
 I didn't add fat 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:18.920
 delicious sandwich enough I 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:21.019
 found an interesting watch mate with 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.480
 the red button is almost the same as 

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:24.740
 President someone calls this model 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.410
 James Bond Hours 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.869
 but actually garmin fenix 2 is rather 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.339
 designed for adherents of triathlon then 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:34.219
 eat escape from hamburger 

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:34.940
 I can at least swim or swim 

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:38.000
 bike ride 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:40.100
 and skiing and snowboarding 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.760
 hikes inner world 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:45.699
 phoenix is ​​rich we have gps bluetooth 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:49.340
 thermometer accelerometer compass barometer 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:52.070
 alarm clock with vibration and counting function 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:54.530
 sizes of your garden plot bottom or 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:57.440
 personal football field as well as many 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.870
 other interesting pieces let's see 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.239
 how is all this prisoner compact 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:05.930
 sports case waterproof up 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:08.570
 depths of 50 meters work run like 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.340
 a wound you can not promise but quick 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.640
 walking and ride a bike this 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:15.890
 what I really can do to begin with 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.409
 have to push this redder button 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:21.409
 which selects the type of workout will be 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:24.170
 assume that walking is the same run but 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:28.820
 only very slow and see what 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:33.640
 us on phoenix thinks we actually 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:36.079
 it happened here but from me to Peter 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.840
 more a little more than two kilometers and 

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:41.860
 turned around in 20 minutes 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:45.079
 average speed 5 out of 7 kilometers per hour 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:48.950
 in general, the clock took all the information from 

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:50.869
 gps and with built-in accelerometer and if 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.030
 would have run on a closed treadmill 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:54.590
 inside the stadium where gps sensors catch 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.320
 won't they could use 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.560
 only sensors or information are built in 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:02.180
 sensors standard ant plus 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.460
 including cardio monitors or here 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.869
 Specially sensor in sneakers get 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.810
 more information and now let's 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:11.450
 complicate the task by adding me two wheels 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:14.380
 so take a simple rolling 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:17.239
 bicycle which in bulk in Moscow and 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:19.340
 the same in general is a simple background 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:21.620
 Moscow we turn on bluetooth even more 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.980
 clock and activate data transfer mode 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:27.110
 move on click the red button and 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.790
 run a bike training here 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.400
 All menus in English mode 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.660
 workouts they go into mapping 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.870
 operational information that is 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:37.880
 show speed 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.709
 mileage and everything else speed 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.769
 just olympic nine and a half 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:45.140
 kilometers per hour I sure can 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:50.959
 speed now try speed 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:52.700
 mode to solder accounting collected statistics 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:54.470
 can now meet either right on 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.030
 hours you let on the iPhone 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:59.000
 this one was also transferred to him 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:01.060
 calorie consumption temperature drink and here 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.860
 show me where I went on the map 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:08.420
 actually the sea functions just sea 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:10.970
 Well, for example in the river catcher hours can 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.680
 calculate the distance using this gps 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.290
 and in the indoor pool where the satellites are not 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.780
 caught will count circles using 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:20.079
 acceleration information here is this black 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:24.170
 button will display temperature information 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:25.519
 pressure altitude with 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.920
 in the last four hours 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:30.620
 watches keep statistics but there is something 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:33.170
 play and what to study on the Internet even 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.609
 There are special clubs of people who 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:38.590
 talk about how to add here 

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:40.790
 new features or 2 kick old 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:43.130
 actually phoenix 2 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:45.799
 this is a personal trainer on your wrist 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:48.079
 able to motivate and help also 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:49.910
 There are two underwear and applications 

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:51.980
 for example software for tourists which 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:54.139
 lets find nearby some 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:56.600
 interesting games traveling together 

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:59.150
 garmin has created a kind of social 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:01.220
 travel network travelers and 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:04.400
 people leading an active lifestyle 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:07.389
 and by the way the clock showed that I am a hamburger 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.389
 still won 

00:04:08.469 --> 00:04:12.670
 video 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.670
 I don't care
