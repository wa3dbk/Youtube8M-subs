00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 yes it's my first video of the year 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.640
 I am moved 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.970
 so to celebrate that I'm going to show you 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.559
 my little favorites of the season 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:12.599
 it's gone with the most 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.420
 weird and coolest I have 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.609
 never the concept is to have a 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.060
 feeling barefoot but with a 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.100
 shoe 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.199
 hence the fact that the toes are 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.390
 separate it's just awesome 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.220
 in addition the shoe is super light 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.840
 and very simple it adapts 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.960
 perfectly to the shape of the foot 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.530
 in short they are super good normally 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.989
 They are mid season shoes 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.460
 in fact school no job of any 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:40.360
 way we do not have polar cold at 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.360
 montpellier then 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:46.530
 and the proof is that there are flowers 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.890
 flowers flowers crying and 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.120
 still flowers I love it even then 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.730
 when there is none in nature 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.350
 I always have on me in jewels for 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.500
 put in long hair scarves 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.870
 but my favorite of all this delicate 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.670
 small various flowers it's a peak to 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.650
 bun made by the little hands of 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.510
 minutes and this is surely one of the 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.880
 most practical accessories for 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.070
 hair you do not imagine doing full 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.930
 in no time with 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.950
 different styles and without damaging the 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.950
 hair is the top 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.159
 and 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.020
 and 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.270
 and if you want a comini bag 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:51.909
 can make hair picks 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.820
 fully customized you can him 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:56.649
 ask what you want is great 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.039
 beautiful and suddenly it's completely 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:59.039
 unique 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:04.110
 and it makes you want to bring back the 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.700
 spring to put on dresses but 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:10.770
 it's a bit cold right now 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:13.110
 so more practical than the down jacket and 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:16.140
 prettier too here is mac apple in 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.420
 polar a little us in front and we have them 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.340
 shoulders warm and throat 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:25.320
 just go to school and fix it 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:28.670
 before it's as sweet as an animal 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:31.710
 as if we were surrounded by a soft toy 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.990
 good I know it's not a reason for 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:36.180
 go out in dress 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:37.860
 although I have already seen quite a few people 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.960
 with fabric capelines but in 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.060
 fur is the must is 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:44.580
 psychologically it is much hotter 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.520
 good of course it's not true 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:49.200
 fur never the heart to anyone and 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.670
 what are your favorite accessories 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.870
