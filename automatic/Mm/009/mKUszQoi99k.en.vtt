00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.130 

okay<00:01:33.640> so<00:01:34.640> the<00:01:34.730> whole<00:01:34.910> chorus<00:01:35.420> I<00:01:35.720> mean<00:01:35.990> the

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
okay so the whole chorus I mean the

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:37.600 
okay so the whole chorus I mean the
whole<00:01:36.530> verse<00:01:36.740> is<00:01:37.010> going<00:01:37.130> to<00:01:37.190> be<00:01:37.340> pretty<00:01:37.550> much

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
whole verse is going to be pretty much

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:48.930 
whole verse is going to be pretty much
those<00:01:37.910> chords<00:01:38.240> so

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:48.940 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:02:08.510 

I<00:01:51.570> think<00:01:53.760> Bobby

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.550 

this<00:02:09.520> is<00:02:09.670> where<00:02:09.819> it<00:02:09.910> changes<00:02:10.300> so<00:02:10.899> you're<00:02:11.290> going

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
this is where it changes so you're going

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:20.460 
this is where it changes so you're going
to<00:02:11.709> go<00:02:11.860> to<00:02:11.890> your<00:02:12.730> third<00:02:13.060> chord<00:02:17.610> on<00:02:18.610> the<00:02:19.470> fourth

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
to go to your third chord on the fourth

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:56.940 
to go to your third chord on the fourth
fret<00:02:54.360> then<00:02:55.360> your<00:02:55.989> next<00:02:56.200> chord<00:02:56.530> you're<00:02:56.860> gonna

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
fret then your next chord you're gonna

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.460 
fret then your next chord you're gonna
just<00:02:57.220> take<00:02:57.400> these<00:02:57.580> two<00:02:57.760> fingers<00:02:57.970> and<00:02:58.690> move

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
just take these two fingers and move

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:13.199 
just take these two fingers and move
them<00:02:59.650> down<00:02:59.860> one<00:03:00.069> string<00:03:11.850> your<00:03:12.850> course<00:03:13.090> is

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
them down one string your course is

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:15.479 
them down one string your course is
gonna<00:03:13.329> be<00:03:13.510> the<00:03:13.600> same<00:03:13.810> four<00:03:14.200> chords<00:03:14.680> as<00:03:14.860> the

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
gonna be the same four chords as the

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:18.210 
gonna be the same four chords as the
first<00:03:15.880> so

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
first so

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:46.830 
first so
I<00:03:34.860> think<00:03:35.860> I'm<00:03:36.160> falling<00:03:36.820> for<00:03:37.180> you

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.180 

the<00:03:47.840> second<00:03:48.290> verse<00:03:48.470> is<00:03:48.740> going<00:03:48.920> to<00:03:48.980> be<00:03:49.070> the

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190 
the second verse is going to be the

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:52.210 
the second verse is going to be the
exact<00:03:49.580> same<00:03:49.940> as<00:03:50.210> the<00:03:50.330> first<00:03:50.540> verse<00:03:51.130> so<00:03:52.130> I'm

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 
exact same as the first verse so I'm

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:53.140 
exact same as the first verse so I'm
just<00:03:52.310> going<00:03:52.430> to<00:03:52.520> go<00:03:52.610> straight<00:03:52.820> into<00:03:52.970> the

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
just going to go straight into the

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:57.010 
just going to go straight into the
