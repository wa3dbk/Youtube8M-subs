00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:32.689 
different wave pattern with the similar

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:36.040 
different wave pattern with the similar
kind<00:00:32.960> of<00:00:33.110> construction<00:00:33.860> so<00:00:34.510> let<00:00:35.510> me<00:00:35.629> pick<00:00:35.900> up

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
looks extremely natural she has a soft

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.590 
looks extremely natural she has a soft
wave<00:00:44.600> and<00:00:45.020> she's<00:00:45.620> not<00:00:45.829> too<00:00:46.040> long<00:00:46.309> as<00:00:47.239> you<00:00:47.420> guys

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
wave and she's not too long as you guys

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.830 
wave and she's not too long as you guys
can<00:00:47.870> see<00:00:48.010> she's<00:00:49.010> not<00:00:49.160> too<00:00:49.370> long<00:00:49.610> so<00:00:50.120> she<00:00:50.629> looks

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:50.840 
can see she's not too long so she looks

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.319 
can see she's not too long so she looks
really<00:00:51.170> natural<00:00:51.559> because<00:00:52.250> she's<00:00:52.700> not<00:00:53.030> too

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:53.329 
really natural because she's not too

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:55.630 
really natural because she's not too
long<00:00:53.629> now<00:00:54.290> you<00:00:54.350> can't<00:00:54.710> of<00:00:54.860> course<00:00:54.890> fluff<00:00:55.489> her

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
long now you can't of course fluff her

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.940 
long now you can't of course fluff her
up<00:00:55.850> and<00:00:58.809> you<00:00:59.809> know<00:00:59.899> get<00:01:00.110> her<00:01:00.230> to<00:01:00.320> be<00:01:00.469> bigger<00:01:00.680> but

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:00.950 
up and you know get her to be bigger but

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:02.799 
up and you know get her to be bigger but
I<00:01:01.399> don't<00:01:01.850> want<00:01:02.030> her<00:01:02.149> to<00:01:02.270> be<00:01:02.390> big<00:01:02.570> because<00:01:02.629> I

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:02.809 
I don't want her to be big because I

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:04.510 
I don't want her to be big because I
think<00:01:02.870> this<00:01:03.140> subtle<00:01:03.500> wave<00:01:03.680> looks<00:01:04.009> very<00:01:04.309> very

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:04.520 
think this subtle wave looks very very

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:08.469 
think this subtle wave looks very very
natural<00:01:05.530> so<00:01:06.530> I<00:01:06.560> imagine<00:01:07.520> because<00:01:07.759> it<00:01:08.060> does<00:01:08.240> say

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:08.479 
natural so I imagine because it does say

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:10.150 
natural so I imagine because it does say
that<00:01:08.630> it's<00:01:08.810> curling<00:01:09.080> iron<00:01:09.380> safe<00:01:09.560> that<00:01:09.800> this<00:01:09.979> is

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:10.160 
that it's curling iron safe that this is

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:11.529 
that it's curling iron safe that this is
something<00:01:10.369> that<00:01:10.580> wants<00:01:11.090> your<00:01:11.179> tie<00:01:11.330> to<00:01:11.390> the

00:01:11.529 --> 00:01:11.539 
something that wants your tie to the

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:13.029 
something that wants your tie to the
waves<00:01:11.750> you<00:01:11.899> probably<00:01:12.289> could<00:01:12.530> flat<00:01:12.770> iron

00:01:13.029 --> 00:01:13.039 
waves you probably could flat iron

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:14.830 
waves you probably could flat iron
astray<00:01:13.310> well<00:01:13.520> I'll<00:01:13.670> be<00:01:13.850> doing<00:01:14.179> will<00:01:14.479> I<00:01:14.509> be

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
astray well I'll be doing will I be

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.510 
astray well I'll be doing will I be
doing<00:01:14.959> that<00:01:15.140> absolutely<00:01:16.100> not

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
doing that absolutely not

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.270 
doing that absolutely not
but<00:01:16.940> you<00:01:17.810> probably<00:01:18.050> could<00:01:18.530> just<00:01:18.560> from<00:01:19.039> the<00:01:19.160> way

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
but you probably could just from the way

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.880 
but you probably could just from the way
it<00:01:19.399> is<00:01:19.550> what<00:01:20.240> gets<00:01:20.899> me<00:01:21.050> about<00:01:21.440> the<00:01:21.560> Vella<00:01:21.770> Vella
