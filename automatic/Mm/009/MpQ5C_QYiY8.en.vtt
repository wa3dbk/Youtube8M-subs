00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:08.440 

okay<00:02:03.310> so<00:02:04.630> sharp<00:02:05.630> now<00:02:05.810> that<00:02:06.800> wasn't<00:02:07.040> Neil<00:02:07.450> I'll

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
okay so sharp now that wasn't Neil I'll

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:14.199 
okay so sharp now that wasn't Neil I'll
see<00:02:08.690> how<00:02:08.810> this<00:02:08.959> does<00:02:12.610> seems<00:02:13.610> to<00:02:13.730> be<00:02:13.820> rock<00:02:14.000> and

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
see how this does seems to be rock and

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:21.550 
see how this does seems to be rock and
grit<00:02:16.150> if<00:02:17.150> we<00:02:17.360> can<00:02:17.540> see<00:02:20.050> also<00:02:21.050> it<00:02:21.110> depends<00:02:21.440> on

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
grit if we can see also it depends on

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:31.540 
grit if we can see also it depends on
the<00:02:21.620> quality<00:02:21.860> of<00:02:22.040> your<00:02:22.160> pencil<00:02:22.610> sharp<00:02:22.820> are<00:02:23.000> too

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:38.150

app

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.240 

think<00:02:41.590> you<00:02:42.280> would<00:02:42.400> want<00:02:42.430> to<00:02:42.730> spend<00:02:42.849> more<00:02:43.239> time

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
think you would want to spend more time

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.069 
think you would want to spend more time
making<00:02:45.250> a<00:02:45.340> ser<00:02:45.609> a<00:02:45.790> lot<00:02:46.090> more<00:02:46.239> toned<00:02:46.450> it<00:02:46.599> off<00:02:46.719> I

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:47.079 
making a ser a lot more toned it off I

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:50.630 
making a ser a lot more toned it off I
think<00:02:47.739> that<00:02:47.890> would<00:02:47.950> be<00:02:48.099> easier<00:02:48.659> than<00:02:49.659> me

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
think that would be easier than me

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.979 
think that would be easier than me

to light it see that probably needs to
be<00:03:34.070> trimmed<00:03:34.820> down<00:03:35.000> about<00:03:36.490> to<00:03:37.490> get<00:03:37.670> a<00:03:37.700> lot<00:03:37.820> more

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 
be trimmed down about to get a lot more

not<00:04:07.750> very<00:04:07.930> successful<00:04:08.560> there<00:04:09.360> let's

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:10.360 
not very successful there let's

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.069 
not very successful there let's
persevere<00:04:11.019> because<00:04:11.140> we<00:04:12.010> don't<00:04:12.189> paw<00:04:12.370> severe

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:17.009 
persevere because we don't paw severe
then<00:04:14.079> we'll<00:04:14.290> never<00:04:14.409> learn<00:04:14.650> do<00:04:14.890> it<00:04:15.180> and<00:04:16.180> you

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:17.019 
then we'll never learn do it and you

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:19.020 
then we'll never learn do it and you
know<00:04:17.049> I<00:04:17.169> could<00:04:17.380> edit<00:04:17.590> this<00:04:17.769> video<00:04:18.009> all<00:04:18.310> day<00:04:18.340> and

here's<00:05:43.040> a<00:05:43.160> bag<00:05:43.430> of<00:05:43.550> paper<00:05:44.290> let's<00:05:45.290> see<00:05:45.500> if<00:05:45.590> we

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:45.710 
here's a bag of paper let's see if we

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:49.390 
here's a bag of paper let's see if we
can't<00:05:45.950> get<00:05:46.220> that<00:05:46.400> to<00:05:46.640> work<00:05:48.130> using<00:05:49.130> their

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:49.400 
can't get that to work using their

00:05:49.400 --> 00:06:15.060 
can't get that to work using their
strike<00:05:49.700> force<00:06:07.660> and<00:06:08.660> almost<00:06:08.960> to<00:06:09.170> go<00:06:09.350> either

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:15.070

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:20.060 
there you go took a loss box that's it

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:22.300 
there you go took a loss box that's it
you<00:06:20.270> know<00:06:20.390> persevere<00:06:21.170> and<00:06:21.890> you'll<00:06:22.040> get<00:06:22.190> the
