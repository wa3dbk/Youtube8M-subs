00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
to a dispenser based combination lock

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.379 
to a dispenser based combination lock
I've<00:00:11.099> looked<00:00:11.309> around<00:00:11.429> and<00:00:11.670> YouTube<00:00:11.940> trying<00:00:12.269> to

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
I've looked around and YouTube trying to

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.930 
I've looked around and YouTube trying to
find<00:00:12.599> one<00:00:12.840> of<00:00:12.870> these<00:00:13.049> I<00:00:13.110> haven't<00:00:13.679> all<00:00:14.580> credit

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
find one of these I haven't all credit

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.490 
find one of these I haven't all credit
goes<00:00:14.969> to<00:00:15.089> fredo<00:00:15.509> one<00:00:15.780> because<00:00:16.109> he's<00:00:16.230> the<00:00:16.289> one

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
goes to fredo one because he's the one

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.800 
goes to fredo one because he's the one
that<00:00:16.650> found<00:00:16.710> out<00:00:17.250> about<00:00:17.490> this<00:00:17.880> basically<00:00:18.390> so

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
that found out about this basically so

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.200 
that found out about this basically so
how<00:00:19.410> it<00:00:19.529> works<00:00:19.560> is<00:00:20.010> you<00:00:20.100> put<00:00:20.580> an<00:00:20.670> item<00:00:20.820> on<00:00:21.150> your

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
how it works is you put an item on your

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.840 
how it works is you put an item on your
so<00:00:22.140> that<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:22.439> fault<00:00:22.680> combination<00:00:23.279> is<00:00:23.460> an<00:00:23.609> item

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
so that the fault combination is an item

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.480 
so that the fault combination is an item
on<00:00:23.939> this<00:00:24.119> one<00:00:24.390> and<00:00:24.570> this<00:00:24.869> one<00:00:24.930> so<00:00:25.470> you<00:00:26.310> put

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
on this one and this one so you put

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.460 
on this one and this one so you put
items<00:00:26.789> there<00:00:26.970> you<00:00:27.240> press<00:00:27.930> this<00:00:28.050> button<00:00:28.230> over

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
items there you press this button over

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:29.509 
items there you press this button over
here<00:00:28.500> and<00:00:28.859> I'm<00:00:28.949> just<00:00:28.980> gonna<00:00:29.160> go<00:00:29.220> on<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.400> other

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
here and I'm just gonna go on the other

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.609 
here and I'm just gonna go on the other
side<00:00:29.699> to<00:00:29.820> guess<00:00:29.970> who<00:00:30.170> that's<00:00:31.170> from<00:00:31.349> last

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
side to guess who that's from last

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.560 
side to guess who that's from last
attempt<00:00:32.489> at<00:00:32.610> making<00:00:32.730> this<00:00:33.000> video<00:00:33.180> which

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
attempt at making this video which

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.560 
attempt at making this video which
pretty<00:00:33.809> much<00:00:33.899> failed<00:00:34.550> so<00:00:35.550> anyways<00:00:35.820> so<00:00:36.180> one<00:00:36.360> the

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
pretty much failed so anyways so one the

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.810 
pretty much failed so anyways so one the
items<00:00:37.010> fall<00:00:38.010> and<00:00:38.280> it's<00:00:38.399> actually<00:00:38.700> on<00:00:38.790> the

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
items fall and it's actually on the

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.830 
items fall and it's actually on the
correct<00:00:39.210> positions<00:00:40.190> door<00:00:41.190> opens<00:00:41.510> for<00:00:42.510> a<00:00:42.540> split

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
correct positions door opens for a split

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.260 
correct positions door opens for a split
second<00:00:43.290> and<00:00:43.410> it<00:00:43.530> locks<00:00:43.829> so<00:00:44.100> you<00:00:44.129> can<00:00:44.910> set<00:00:45.120> it<00:00:45.239> to

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
second and it locks so you can set it to

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.180 
second and it locks so you can set it to
any<00:00:45.570> kind<00:00:46.079> of<00:00:46.140> combination<00:00:46.440> you<00:00:46.860> could<00:00:46.980> think

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
any kind of combination you could think

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.569 
any kind of combination you could think
of<00:00:47.430> maybe<00:00:47.989> item<00:00:48.989> item<00:00:49.350> no<00:00:49.649> item<00:00:49.950> and<00:00:50.160> then<00:00:50.219> item

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
of maybe item item no item and then item

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.170 
of maybe item item no item and then item
or<00:00:51.379> just<00:00:52.379> I<00:00:52.710> don't<00:00:53.010> know<00:00:53.190> just<00:00:53.610> item<00:00:53.969> on<00:00:54.120> the

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
or just I don't know just item on the

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.060 
or just I don't know just item on the
first<00:00:54.390> one<00:00:54.629> maybe<00:00:54.870> you<00:00:55.590> know<00:00:55.649> whatever<00:00:55.980> you

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
first one maybe you know whatever you

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.950 
first one maybe you know whatever you
want<00:00:56.219> up<00:00:56.520> to<00:00:56.670> you<00:00:56.789> and<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.510> cool<00:00:57.719> thing<00:00:57.750> is

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
want up to you and the cool thing is

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.319 
want up to you and the cool thing is
that<00:00:58.109> for<00:00:58.410> example<00:00:58.710> if<00:00:58.800> that<00:00:59.039> was<00:00:59.190> just<00:00:59.270> so<00:01:00.270> to

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
that for example if that was just so to

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:01.790 
that for example if that was just so to
open<00:01:00.719> this<00:01:00.840> door<00:01:01.050> you<00:01:01.230> would<00:01:01.350> only<00:01:01.440> need<00:01:01.649> to

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
open this door you would only need to

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.380 
open this door you would only need to
put<00:01:01.980> an<00:01:02.039> item<00:01:02.219> here<00:01:02.370> right<00:01:02.760> so<00:01:02.940> you<00:01:03.000> would<00:01:03.210> only

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
put an item here right so you would only

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.520 
put an item here right so you would only
put<00:01:03.660> an<00:01:03.780> item<00:01:03.960> on<00:01:04.260> this<00:01:04.530> dispenser<00:01:06.260> but<00:01:07.260> if<00:01:07.409> you

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
put an item on this dispenser but if you

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.350 
put an item on this dispenser but if you
didn't<00:01:07.799> know<00:01:07.979> that<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.580> password<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:09.210> you

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
didn't know that the password and you

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.429 
didn't know that the password and you
put<00:01:09.600> like<00:01:09.900> two<00:01:10.470> like<00:01:10.650> that<00:01:11.420> so<00:01:12.420> I<00:01:12.840> mean<00:01:13.200> if<00:01:13.290> it

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
put like two like that so I mean if it

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.200 
put like two like that so I mean if it
was<00:01:13.560> just<00:01:13.590> this<00:01:13.979> one<00:01:14.220> it<00:01:14.369> would<00:01:14.490> work<00:01:14.640> but<00:01:14.970> the

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
was just this one it would work but the

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.080 
was just this one it would work but the
thing<00:01:15.390> is<00:01:15.420> that<00:01:16.189> sings<00:01:17.189> there's<00:01:17.580> this<00:01:17.880> other

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
thing is that sings there's this other

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.820 
thing is that sings there's this other
one<00:01:18.360> it<00:01:18.600> locks<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:18.960> system<00:01:19.350> for<00:01:19.530> five<00:01:19.650> minutes

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
one it locks the system for five minutes

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.249 
one it locks the system for five minutes
until<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.280> item<00:01:20.610> V<00:01:20.759> spots<00:01:21.060> so<00:01:21.869> if<00:01:21.930> you<00:01:22.020> get<00:01:22.140> the

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
until the item V spots so if you get the

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:23.510 
until the item V spots so if you get the
password<00:01:22.650> wrong<00:01:22.799> you<00:01:23.009> have<00:01:23.100> to<00:01:23.159> wait<00:01:23.310> five

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
password wrong you have to wait five

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.859 
password wrong you have to wait five
minutes<00:01:23.700> before<00:01:23.880> you<00:01:24.090> can<00:01:24.210> try<00:01:24.420> again<00:01:24.659> which

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
minutes before you can try again which

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.749 
minutes before you can try again which
is<00:01:24.900> really<00:01:25.229> cool<00:01:25.409> it's<00:01:26.220> just<00:01:26.490> another

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
is really cool it's just another

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.060 
is really cool it's just another
security<00:01:27.090> measure<00:01:27.450> that<00:01:27.750> this<00:01:27.930> thing<00:01:28.140> has<00:01:28.320> and

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
security measure that this thing has and

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.030 
security measure that this thing has and
I'm<00:01:29.549> just<00:01:29.670> gonna<00:01:29.790> and<00:01:30.380> what<00:01:31.380> this<00:01:31.530> is<00:01:31.770> it's

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
I'm just gonna and what this is it's

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.499 
I'm just gonna and what this is it's
basically<00:01:32.159> a<00:01:32.400> signal<00:01:32.700> shortener<00:01:33.030> which<00:01:33.240> makes

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
basically a signal shortener which makes

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.590 
basically a signal shortener which makes
the<00:01:33.810> long<00:01:34.290> lever<00:01:34.560> signal<00:01:35.100> into<00:01:35.549> a<00:01:35.579> or<00:01:36.540> a

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
the long lever signal into a or a

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.700 
the long lever signal into a or a
continuous<00:01:37.229> signal<00:01:37.409> into<00:01:37.860> a<00:01:37.890> button<00:01:39.350> tick<00:01:40.350> so

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
continuous signal into a button tick so

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.800 
continuous signal into a button tick so
not<00:01:41.400> one<00:01:41.579> thick<00:01:41.759> it's<00:01:41.939> actually<00:01:42.299> like<00:01:42.390> a<00:01:42.450> six

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
not one thick it's actually like a six
