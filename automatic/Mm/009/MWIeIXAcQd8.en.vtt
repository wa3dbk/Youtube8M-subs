that's kind of a bummer so um so yeah
that<00:01:32.909> they<00:01:33.030> fixed<00:01:33.360> a<00:01:33.509> zombie<00:01:33.960> Matt<00:01:34.140> glitch

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
that they fixed a zombie Matt glitch

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.039 
that they fixed a zombie Matt glitch
I've<00:01:34.650> heard<00:01:35.100> that<00:01:35.579> it<00:01:35.729> can<00:01:35.909> still<00:01:36.150> be<00:01:36.180> done<00:01:36.329> but

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
I've heard that it can still be done but

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.600 
I've heard that it can still be done but
I<00:01:37.110> haven't<00:01:37.680> seen<00:01:37.950> it<00:01:38.100> yet<00:01:38.220> i<00:01:38.280> don't<00:01:38.369> really

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
I haven't seen it yet i don't really

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.249 
I haven't seen it yet i don't really
follow<00:01:38.970> zombie<00:01:39.390> Matt<00:01:39.540> glitches<00:01:39.900> all<00:01:40.079> that

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
follow zombie Matt glitches all that

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.260 
follow zombie Matt glitches all that
closely<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:41.159> next<00:01:41.400> thing<00:01:41.549> is<00:01:41.610> support<00:01:42.150> for

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
closely the next thing is support for

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.450 
closely the next thing is support for
the<00:01:42.360> annihilation<00:01:42.509> map<00:01:43.020> pack<00:01:43.259> so<00:01:44.220> that's<00:01:44.399> a

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
the annihilation map pack so that's a

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.429 
the annihilation map pack so that's a
really<00:01:44.490> cool<00:01:44.790> thing<00:01:45.000> my<00:01:45.420> Treyarch<00:01:46.110> has<00:01:46.170> done<00:01:46.409> a

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
really cool thing my Treyarch has done a

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.109 
really cool thing my Treyarch has done a
better<00:01:46.619> job<00:01:46.740> in<00:01:47.189> black<00:01:47.399> ops<00:01:47.579> than<00:01:47.820> they<00:01:47.939> have

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
better job in black ops than they have

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.899 
better job in black ops than they have
in<00:01:48.149> in<00:01:48.420> world<00:01:48.630> at<00:01:48.750> war<00:01:48.930> in<00:01:49.110> that<00:01:49.680> now<00:01:50.369> when<00:01:50.790> you

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.700 
in in world at war in that now when you
if<00:01:51.149> you<00:01:51.720> have<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:51.960> annihilation<00:01:52.259> map<00:01:52.530> pack

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
if you have the annihilation map pack

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.170 
if you have the annihilation map pack
you<00:01:52.829> only<00:01:52.979> play<00:01:53.189> with<00:01:53.310> other<00:01:53.490> people<00:01:53.820> who<00:01:53.939> have

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.260 
that is coming I hope you guys like the
the<00:02:04.950> map<00:02:05.100> pack<00:02:05.280> I<00:02:05.399> actually<00:02:05.640> like<00:02:05.909> it<00:02:05.939> think

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
the map pack I actually like it think

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.340 
the map pack I actually like it think
it's<00:02:06.360> a<00:02:06.420> pretty<00:02:06.570> good<00:02:06.689> one<00:02:06.810> it's<00:02:07.049> one<00:02:07.200> of<00:02:07.290> the

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
it's a pretty good one it's one of the

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.779 
it's a pretty good one it's one of the
better<00:02:07.469> map<00:02:07.680> packs<00:02:07.950> for<00:02:08.190> call<00:02:08.340> of<00:02:08.369> duty<00:02:08.670> that

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
better map packs for call of duty that

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.639 
better map packs for call of duty that
I've<00:02:08.910> seen<00:02:09.119> and<00:02:09.899> the<00:02:09.989> last<00:02:10.170> thing<00:02:10.410> is<00:02:10.470> a

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
I've seen and the last thing is a

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.260 
I've seen and the last thing is a
search-and-destroy<00:02:11.160> audio<00:02:11.910> tweak<00:02:12.239> for

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
search-and-destroy audio tweak for

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.520 
search-and-destroy audio tweak for
planting<00:02:12.870> and<00:02:13.020> diffusing

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
planting and diffusing

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.590 
planting and diffusing
so<00:02:13.650> previously<00:02:14.130> when<00:02:14.970> you<00:02:15.060> did<00:02:15.209> plant<00:02:15.450> and

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
so previously when you did plant and

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.840 
so previously when you did plant and
diffuses<00:02:16.110> and<00:02:16.350> your<00:02:16.950> little<00:02:17.130> character<00:02:17.670> was

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
diffuses and your little character was

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:19.970 
diffuses and your little character was
working<00:02:18.180> the<00:02:18.300> buttons<00:02:18.630> it<00:02:19.140> made<00:02:19.350> kind<00:02:19.680> of<00:02:19.830> like

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
working the buttons it made kind of like

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.940 
working the buttons it made kind of like
a<00:02:20.010> cell<00:02:20.730> phone<00:02:21.030> button<00:02:21.930> pressing<00:02:22.440> sound<00:02:22.740> you

you hear is the like buckling and
unbuckling<00:02:29.280> of<00:02:29.700> the<00:02:29.880> briefcase<00:02:30.360> and<00:02:30.569> that's<00:02:30.810> a

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
unbuckling of the briefcase and that's a

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:32.479 
unbuckling of the briefcase and that's a
good<00:02:31.260> thing<00:02:31.319> and<00:02:31.590> I'll<00:02:31.800> tell<00:02:31.950> you<00:02:32.010> why<00:02:32.100> in

good thing and I'll tell you why in
search<00:02:33.060> of<00:02:33.090> destroy<00:02:33.630> that<00:02:34.380> buckling<00:02:34.890> and

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
search of destroy that buckling and

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.800 
search of destroy that buckling and
unbuckling<00:02:35.370> of<00:02:35.670> the<00:02:35.790> briefcase<00:02:36.270> played<00:02:36.780> a

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
unbuckling of the briefcase played a

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.440 
unbuckling of the briefcase played a
major<00:02:37.050> part<00:02:37.260> in<00:02:37.709> tactics<00:02:38.280> for<00:02:38.910> example<00:02:39.300> if

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
major part in tactics for example if

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.300 
major part in tactics for example if
you're<00:02:39.600> trying<00:02:39.810> to<00:02:39.930> defuse<00:02:40.350> it<00:02:40.500> you<00:02:41.100> might

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
you're trying to defuse it you might

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.210 
you're trying to defuse it you might
grab<00:02:42.030> the<00:02:42.180> briefcase<00:02:42.620> unbuckle<00:02:43.620> it<00:02:43.739> and<00:02:43.980> then

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
grab the briefcase unbuckle it and then

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.949 
grab the briefcase unbuckle it and then
sitting<00:02:44.520> there<00:02:44.670> ready<00:02:44.970> for<00:02:45.300> the<00:02:45.450> defender<00:02:45.930> to

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
sitting there ready for the defender to

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:47.479 
sitting there ready for the defender to
come<00:02:46.320> to<00:02:46.500> you<00:02:46.680> and<00:02:46.860> you<00:02:46.920> could<00:02:47.070> use<00:02:47.190> the<00:02:47.310> bomb

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
come to you and you could use the bomb

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:49.640 
come to you and you could use the bomb
itself<00:02:47.640> as<00:02:48.060> cover<00:02:48.300> or<00:02:48.510> some<00:02:48.750> other<00:02:48.870> place<00:02:49.050> but

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
itself as cover or some other place but

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.620 
itself as cover or some other place but
you<00:02:49.769> would<00:02:49.890> use<00:02:50.070> that<00:02:50.100> sound<00:02:50.670> is<00:02:51.000> a<00:02:51.030> trick<00:02:51.420> to

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
you would use that sound is a trick to

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.180 
you would use that sound is a trick to
get<00:02:51.750> them<00:02:51.930> to<00:02:52.050> come<00:02:52.200> out<00:02:52.410> and<00:02:52.590> do<00:02:52.769> their<00:02:52.950> thing

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
get them to come out and do their thing

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.370 
get them to come out and do their thing
on<00:02:53.400> the<00:02:53.910> other<00:02:54.030> hand<00:02:54.150> while<00:02:55.080> the<00:02:55.230> guys

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
on the other hand while the guys
