right now all right I'm gonna protect

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:45.970 
right now all right I'm gonna protect
with<00:02:44.480> Pachirisu<00:02:44.780> and<00:02:45.410> I'm<00:02:45.620> just<00:02:45.739> gonna<00:02:45.830> go

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
with Pachirisu and I'm just gonna go

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.530 
with Pachirisu and I'm just gonna go
with<00:02:46.040> an<00:02:46.160> earthquake<00:02:46.519> because<00:02:47.030> I<00:02:47.180> feel<00:02:47.360> like<00:02:47.390> I

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
with an earthquake because I feel like I

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:48.910 
with an earthquake because I feel like I
can<00:02:47.690> get<00:02:47.930> rid<00:02:48.050> of<00:02:48.080> Gardevoir<00:02:48.560> here<00:02:48.709> with<00:02:48.800> an

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
can get rid of Gardevoir here with an

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.320 
can get rid of Gardevoir here with an
earthquake<00:02:49.069> and<00:02:49.459> I<00:02:49.489> think<00:02:49.760> Garchomp<00:02:50.150> will<00:02:50.239> go

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
earthquake and I think Garchomp will go

00:02:50.330 --> 00:03:08.500 
earthquake and I think Garchomp will go
down<00:02:50.510> to<00:02:50.720> roughly<00:02:51.200> 50%<00:02:51.470> on<00:02:51.950> an<00:02:52.100> earthquake

00:06:26.159 --> 00:06:28.409 
here but I don't think that I will um
yeah<00:06:27.159> maybe<00:06:27.519> if<00:06:27.759> he's<00:06:27.879> got<00:06:27.999> rough<00:06:28.149> ski<00:06:28.330> and

00:06:28.409 --> 00:06:28.419

00:06:28.419 --> 00:06:30.689 
yeah maybe if he's got rough ski and
rocky<00:06:28.659> helmet<00:06:29.069> no<00:06:30.069> okay<00:06:30.279> so<00:06:30.399> I<00:06:30.429> only<00:06:30.519> had<00:06:30.669> a

rocky helmet no okay so I only had a

00:06:30.699 --> 00:06:34.549 
rocky helmet no okay so I only had a
rough<00:06:30.849> skin<00:06:31.119> which<00:06:31.479> means<00:06:31.689> that<00:06:32.019> I<00:06:32.939> could<00:06:33.939> lose

00:06:34.549 --> 00:06:34.559 
rough skin which means that I could lose

00:06:34.559 --> 00:06:37.409 
rough skin which means that I could lose
Gyarados<00:06:35.559> to<00:06:35.979> potentially<00:06:36.969> like<00:06:37.179> a
