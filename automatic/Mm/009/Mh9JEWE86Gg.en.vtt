 and snowmobiles the waterfalls as 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.149
 we are always starting to put together a 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.620
 snowpark we have hired a machinist 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:04.110
 who is a specialist in that so good 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:06.480

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.760

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.950
 some time we have also told you 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:19.980
 to have listened we are ready is not 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:23.040
 missing very little 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:26.280
 We estimate that if the weather is with us 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.710
 on day 17 or 20 we would have to 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.650
 be from 17 to 20 we have thought about 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.240
 actually open this year the school of 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.040
 skiing has also changed you 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.020
 we are more 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.250
 trying to go off the track what 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.830
 is 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.660
 what highlights this place so good 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.600
 year year nothing we are also doing 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:47.700
 a confectionery in sector two that does not 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.220
 I know if you had the opportunity to film the 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.750
 still that it has 300 square meters and 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.950
 let's do a little thing but for the 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.380
 company made the decision to make a 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.640
 extremely great thing that I believe 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.610
 that the place is going to come very well 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.740
 well I also wanted to invite not only to 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.680

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.800
 which points to the company aims for this to 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.509
 the family but also this change 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.580
 that I told you that was produced in the 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.830
 school here is because 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.709

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:18.570
 to enjoy having an outside 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.000
 track 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:23.550
 amazing so good nothing invite them 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.440
 and thank you again for the good visit 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.170
 people here are at the base of the hill 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.480
 caviahue with saturn one company 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:33.000
 of the machinists here of company of 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.430
 the Andes to tell you a bit how 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.280
 come the 2015 season as you will see 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.020
 we have snow in the base is stepped here 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.850
 I was talking just that with the 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.110
 manager of the snow pisa so 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.910
 now give them to tell them 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.710
 how is the condition of the tracks 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.320
 in the high part of the hill because nothing 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:51.450
 hello how about my name is guillÃ©n I'm from a 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.940
 town a small town north of 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.040
 catalonia and I came here to see if 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.910
 we can build a park and see it a bit 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:01.290
 I'm also thinking about the clues and 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:03.900
 I think we can do a great job 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.640
 For this to work now 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.950
 we have open what is the part of 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:10.800
 down and the top part to the 4 that 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:13.410
 we have a clue anyway 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.930
 snow but it could be opened and you can 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:18.270
 enjoy skiing because nothing my idea 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.400
 of the park is to make a park that everything 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:23.160
 the world can participate since I believe 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.810
 that it was good has a lot of level of 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.600
 freestyle therefore neither does it 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.640
 can make a huge park doing 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:32.010
 small jumps large jumps and 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:34.200
 putting railings something that all the 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.330
 world can participate because I think it is 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.280
 the most valid option for for this 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:40.740
 station we also want to make a 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:43.860
 boardercross but that we will see according to 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:45.540
 the snow and according to how how are we going we're going 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:48.540
 watching the winter 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.579
 some out there are not aware of what 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.109
 which is the off-piste that has to 

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:53.519
 there was a web that is immense 

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:57.450
 conditions for off -piste I think that 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:59.670
 the place is unequaled the track as 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.780
 everyone knows it is very small compared 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.489
 with other ski centers of the 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.590
 Argentina but the off-piste of 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:06.420
 very interesting caviahue up there 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.220
 excursions to the hot springs that are given 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.230
 from the end of August or 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.120
 early September already with the days 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.879
 like today's form since we're in 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.289
 June people start to enjoy 

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:18.509
 that kind of off-piste excursions 

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:20.660
 you can walk to a sector 

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:23.970
 of natural hot springs and walk back 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:26.220
 as I said before the sector is 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:29.190
 off -piste caviahue is almost you 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:30.990
 I would say unlimited is very large and with a 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:34.139
 good guide you can grab and enjoy 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:36.000
 the mountain by many places places 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:38.580
 that out there you're going to look super 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.550
 incredible, there are things that are not 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:43.349
 you see if they are not incomparable like 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:45.990
 for example, sledging on the one hand 

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:47.280
 super high of dogs the guys with the 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.440
 snowmobile this is a hill too 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:52.500
 where you can circulate snowmobile 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.610
 everywhere there are trails that indicate 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.710
 the places where the bike goes 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:58.470
 snow as well as the snow steps 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:59.910
 as used saturn so the 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:01.440
 possibilities are many 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:03.900
 there are also excursions to the volcano 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:06.390
 that are very in the morning you can also 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.070
 go on an excursion and lower the whole face 

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:11.310
 of the volcano and go down to connect with the 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:13.500
 Ski center is also an excursion 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:15.840
 very pretty good my name is tony and 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:17.820
 Sunday third consecutive season in 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:19.830
 the pig this year as the manager of 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:22.170
 sales of the school and the truth is that 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:24.690
 we have some important news to 

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:26.250
 tell them the first one from the 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:28.470
 opening of the hotel is for this we 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:31.350
 it's going to change a bit, well, the 

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:34.410
 offer and perspective for this year already 

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:35.880
 that we incorporate two new services in 

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:37.980
 last year compared to the first 

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:41.040
 would be the freestyle classes and the 

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:43.140
 second would be the top class is a 

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:45.750
 service then according to the public 

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:48.090
 goal that will bring you these 

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:50.040
 new facilities and the classes of 

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:52.890
 freestyle will also be in accordance with the 

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:55.449
 new snowpark that can also be 

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:56.650
 carry out thanks to the law

00:05:58.719 --> 00:06:04.389
 and he will also take care of his 

00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:07.020
 subsequently building a team of 

00:06:04.389 --> 00:06:10.779
