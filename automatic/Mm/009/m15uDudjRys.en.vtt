let's get that finish okay we're going

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:52.520 
let's get that finish okay we're going
to<00:00:51.570> have<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.840> option<00:00:52.200> where<00:00:52.410> you<00:00:52.440> can

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
to have the option where you can

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.860 
to have the option where you can
actually<00:00:52.860> have<00:00:53.579> this<00:00:53.850> camouflage<00:00:54.420> as<00:00:54.660> well
