 You guys bring a pretty video. 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.190
 which may turn into a series that the 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.410

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.720

 to enjoy is already embedded as you see 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.019
 I got my first one who debuts 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.539
 that my first quotation marks right because 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.850
 unfortunately like anyone who follows me on 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.469
 twitter that the home store is a defendant knows 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.690
 I caught my first acquaintance who is 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.570
 long time ago I even got 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.360
 in a live together with tony montana is that 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.969
 the MIB of the coach then I was in a 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.770
 analysis with him playing in Paris and 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.030
 I got the map street sony more 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.760
 Unfortunately I thought I was not going to 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.969
 to catch anything with the little tigers 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.520
 things end up not recording but at least not 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.710
 is the subject of the video that now but how 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.210
 You see I got my first game. 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.170
 freak for you 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:06.270
 According to the mega man the man was 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.580
 We were making tea in the drawing. 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.070
 among us who would catch the first who 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.869
 I think he got it, I think I 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.000
 I could not prove that he had 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.280
 because he had a video for that but 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.290
 he later began to think that he 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.600
 I do not know what to talk to me and only 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.509
 then who gets the checks was in a 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.610
 a Monday he picked it up 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.650
 very nervous too at the time like me 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.810
 I stayed a lot of people stay at the time of what 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.150
 in shock as many people also 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.680
 It was in the morning in the habit of the kit 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.450
 secret no 3 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.070
 but we make a joke anyway 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.810
 It was really fun, I was very 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.290
 nervous and why not pick up and stay 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.780
 very pissed to myself and still in the day 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.270
 that he spoke o you and did not take no 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.799
 talk to me more I got it I showed it to 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.960
 he said that I was champion and how 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.729
 you see on the field any time not 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.740
 be a part that is not that champion 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.049
 I was left without any kind of reaction because 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.180
 How come you were not without Roni? 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.890
 released from pistol and silenced ee 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.170
 You saw that I accepted no title. 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.939
 Of course at that distance I was 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.459
 very on the map and looking for a weapon 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:10.890
 because your pistol walk is fucked up 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.780
 Why the fuck did I even try to get a guy there? 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.740
 As you can see, I think I gave three 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.720
 long shots 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.280
 I got the guy, I said go 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.080
 run with this story because it's mine. 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.600
 Way that I have but thanks to God. 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.760
 I found a guy by the log who sees 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:26.280
 wait look in front of me find a 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.500
 man I think he was already here 12 4 a 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.000
 company I did half the gameplay already 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.750
 cardozo and half gameplay takes 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.570
 average 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:36.030
 and I found it very good, this very good 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:38.670
 even mainly to pick up the 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.260
 galley from far and itaÃº with muffler and 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.050
 exchange nymex that was something that 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.880
 helped a lot during gameplay 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:47.430
 but anyway I want to give a little 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.080
 Tips for you guys to use here 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.400
 to try and catch your first game 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.770
 show is that the first thing I say 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.440
 For you guys, it was not champion on the pitch. 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:57.480
 a stupid stupid thing and if you are 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.120
 champion on top you lose the 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.550
 chance you get the highest number 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.740
 possible titles but quickly 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:06.450
 you camera does not have much chance too 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.950
 with the enemy that if the guy catches you 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.870
 behind this iron 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.510
 so I'll tell you the following if 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:15.480
 You really want to walk on the map that 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:18.480
 You want tea to pick up between 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.160
 quotes if you want to pull or play 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.140
 trying to catch the same song with the 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.000
 goal to catch who you have to 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.800
 know the map first play 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.480
 enough in him as I know is what 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:31.230
 has that is an area that I got one 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.700
 Check this is the map, what do I have and how do I 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.010
 I know the map a lot I went 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.900
 always around the edges which is a map that 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.120
 You thus I never know enough 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.800
 this map because the game I played one 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.860
 little competitive with the crowd of 7 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:47.220
 beautiful but I also played very cold 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:49.320
 free for all oo the pilot of this map I 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.540
 Could the course of one more map be too 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:53.100
 even very good except it be a 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.860
 little big one also has the edges 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:58.980
 That was the places I walked that was 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:01.560
 a very good choice for me and finally 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:04.140
 Do you know the maps you want? 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.510
 will have a huge chance but it 's huge 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:08.130
 even if you take a time strike that 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.709
 you will first know where the 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:13.920
 you will know where to walk is 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:15.690
 This is what the folks at 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.030
 that is what really happens in the 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:20.070
 most of the time I died many times 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:22.140
 behind there trying to get this 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.979
 playmaker who strike I bet with 

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:26.040
 mega ne 

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:27.270
 but anyway if you liked this tip 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:29.370
 do not forget to eat 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.169
 there's your tip too because I'm 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.970
 giving mine and also another tip 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:36.210
 I'll give you a tip no more 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:37.319
 one a suggestion I have is 7 I do not 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.330
 I know if you have 

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:42.509
 but the headset helps a lot 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:45.180
 mainly in the code of the code if it is 

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:47.849
 one or if it's not the best, it 's very 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:50.190
 similar to mw3 the sound of the steps of 

00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:52.289
 enemies and and especially if you 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:53.759
 Are you using a little bit more? 

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:55.919
 very good and I 'm not going to talk because 

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:57.780
 You should know, but you will. 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:05:00.090
 know about suicide in a future each 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.949
 in the players that you will understand the 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:05.310
 because I'm saying this part I 

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:07.229
 I was very nervous I already had in 1960 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:08.909
 I think the one you saw there appears 

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:10.710
 a guy and at that time I also did a good job 

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:13.080
 that I do not even know how to assert the 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:14.759
 face there and the two of them were lined up 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.860
 year and also in this part is already well 

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:18.719
 nervous to 21 01 and listen to a friend of mine 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.940
 nephew and listened space as you and 

00:05:18.719 --> 00:05:22.620
 I let a process listen to the 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:24.870
 Dude, I was going up, I said keep somebody. 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:26.159
 that loses boy and was not the friend face 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:28.169
 mine was passing here 

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:30.169
 and at that time I stayed very much 

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:33.690
 nervous as you see it was 

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:36.539
 6435 there I was 2020 ps the week 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:38.789
 santa a clan pegas treiki mansion already 

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:40.349
 I was not going to get it, I was not going to get it yet. 

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:41.370
 If I catch it, I'll catch it well. 

00:05:40.349 --> 00:05:43.380
 end of phase 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:45.060
 and this is what is going to happen not that I 

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:45.719
 I'll get back, I will not kill. 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.389
 nobody 

00:05:45.719 --> 00:05:50.490
 I'm going to let go and I'm going to kill only one more. 

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:52.830
 You'll see more clearly. 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:54.930
 When to pass on to you, but finally, guys. 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:57.240

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:59.159
 Do you want to change the subject or change it? 

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:01.289

00:05:59.159 --> 00:06:03.300
