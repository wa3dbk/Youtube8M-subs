every day no I don't think anybody would
say<00:02:55.830> that<00:02:56.070> is<00:02:56.460> it<00:02:57.450> reasonable<00:02:58.200> to<00:02:58.230> expect<00:02:58.470> that

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
say that is it reasonable to expect that

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
ability of your ability every single day

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.650 
ability of your ability every single day
and<00:03:05.130> we<00:03:05.520> should<00:03:05.670> be<00:03:05.760> able<00:03:05.880> to<00:03:06.030> expect<00:03:06.390> to<00:03:06.540> hit

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
and we should be able to expect to hit

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.620 
and we should be able to expect to hit
that<00:03:07.100> maybe<00:03:08.100> not<00:03:08.400> even<00:03:08.580> that<00:03:08.910> to<00:03:09.120> be<00:03:09.240> totally

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
that maybe not even that to be totally

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.330 
that maybe not even that to be totally
honest<00:03:09.960> there's<00:03:10.140> going<00:03:10.380> to<00:03:10.440> be<00:03:10.590> natural<00:03:11.160> ups

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
honest there's going to be natural ups

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.160 
honest there's going to be natural ups
and<00:03:11.580> downs<00:03:11.790> and<00:03:12.150> I<00:03:12.660> think<00:03:12.840> it<00:03:12.900> was<00:03:12.990> interesting

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
and downs and I think it was interesting

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.040 
and downs and I think it was interesting
that<00:03:13.650> that<00:03:13.680> Cody<00:03:14.130> even<00:03:14.790> mentioned<00:03:15.240> you're<00:03:15.840> not

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
that that Cody even mentioned you're not

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:17.900 
that that Cody even mentioned you're not
even<00:03:16.350> from<00:03:16.500> day<00:03:16.710> to<00:03:16.770> day<00:03:16.860> but<00:03:17.040> even<00:03:17.459> from<00:03:17.640> shot

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
even from day to day but even from shot

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:19.699 
even from day to day but even from shot
to<00:03:17.940> shot<00:03:18.150> you're<00:03:18.900> gonna<00:03:18.990> have<00:03:19.200> some<00:03:19.380> ups<00:03:19.560> and

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
to shot you're gonna have some ups and

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.830 
to shot you're gonna have some ups and
downs<00:03:19.800> from<00:03:20.100> shot<00:03:20.340> to<00:03:20.370> shot<00:03:20.550> we're<00:03:21.120> a<00:03:21.150> little

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
downs from shot to shot we're a little

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.510 
downs from shot to shot we're a little
bit<00:03:22.080> of<00:03:22.170> tension<00:03:22.560> you<00:03:22.680> know<00:03:22.709> creeps<00:03:23.130> in<00:03:23.310> on<00:03:23.490> a

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:23.520 
bit of tension you know creeps in on a

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:27.760 
bit of tension you know creeps in on a
particular<00:03:23.940> shot<00:03:24.390> on<00:03:25.080> a<00:03:25.140> big<00:03:25.410> point<00:03:25.850> etc<00:03:26.850> so

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:27.770 
particular shot on a big point etc so

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:31.850 
particular shot on a big point etc so
Cody<00:03:28.770> I<00:03:28.890> think<00:03:29.250> for<00:03:30.030> me<00:03:30.260> first<00:03:31.260> and<00:03:31.440> foremost

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
Cody I think for me first and foremost

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.110 
Cody I think for me first and foremost
the<00:03:32.040> most<00:03:32.070> important<00:03:32.640> thing<00:03:32.760> is<00:03:32.880> to<00:03:32.970> have<00:03:33.060> a

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
the most important thing is to have a

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.400 
the most important thing is to have a
realistic<00:03:33.860> expectation<00:03:34.860> of<00:03:35.100> what<00:03:35.850> to<00:03:36.090> expect

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
realistic expectation of what to expect

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:38.750 
realistic expectation of what to expect
now<00:03:37.410> you<00:03:37.950> know<00:03:38.040> on<00:03:38.160> the<00:03:38.250> other<00:03:38.340> end<00:03:38.520> of<00:03:38.640> the

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
now you know on the other end of the

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.940 
now you know on the other end of the
spectrum<00:03:38.940> should<00:03:39.390> you<00:03:39.570> be<00:03:40.050> fully<00:03:40.320> expecting

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
spectrum should you be fully expecting

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.010 
spectrum should you be fully expecting
to<00:03:41.010> have<00:03:41.160> you<00:03:41.790> know<00:03:41.880> a<00:03:42.209> whole<00:03:42.540> bunch<00:03:42.570> of<00:03:42.870> bad

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:43.020 
to have you know a whole bunch of bad

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.110 
to have you know a whole bunch of bad
days<00:03:43.290> in<00:03:43.320> a<00:03:43.530> row<00:03:43.709> or<00:03:43.950> maybe<00:03:44.100> completely<00:03:44.489> random

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.960 
days in a row or maybe completely random
no<00:03:45.540> you<00:03:45.900> can<00:03:46.080> work<00:03:46.110> towards<00:03:46.860> a<00:03:47.070> higher<00:03:47.610> level

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
no you can work towards a higher level

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.390 
no you can work towards a higher level
of<00:03:48.270> consistency<00:03:48.780> and<00:03:49.440> I<00:03:49.800> think<00:03:50.070> the<00:03:50.220> most

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
of consistency and I think the most

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.340 
of consistency and I think the most
important<00:03:50.910> thing<00:03:51.180> that<00:03:51.450> factors<00:03:51.870> into<00:03:52.140> that

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
important thing that factors into that

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:56.000 
important thing that factors into that
is<00:03:52.560> the<00:03:52.709> quality<00:03:53.070> of<00:03:53.340> your<00:03:53.610> practice<00:03:54.060> time<00:03:55.010> the

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
is the quality of your practice time the

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:57.590 
is the quality of your practice time the
consistency<00:03:56.670> of<00:03:56.700> your<00:03:56.880> practice<00:03:57.239> time<00:03:57.390> and

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
consistency of your practice time and

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.030 
consistency of your practice time and
the<00:03:57.840> quality<00:03:58.230> of<00:03:58.380> your<00:03:58.530> practice<00:03:58.890> time

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
the quality of your practice time

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.080 
the quality of your practice time
consistency<00:03:59.790> meaning<00:04:00.150> that<00:04:01.110> you<00:04:01.230> don't<00:04:01.500> go

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
consistency meaning that you don't go

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:04.910 
consistency meaning that you don't go
you<00:04:03.090> know<00:04:03.180> you<00:04:03.510> practice<00:04:04.050> three<00:04:04.440> times<00:04:04.470> and<00:04:04.860> by

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:36.480 
serve it doesn't matter how long of a

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:39.800 
serve it doesn't matter how long of a
break<00:05:36.510> maybe<00:05:37.020> I<00:05:37.170> take<00:05:37.880> how<00:05:38.880> many<00:05:38.940> other<00:05:39.510> things

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:39.810

break maybe I take how many other things
maybe<00:05:40.500> other<00:05:40.890> parts<00:05:41.190> of<00:05:41.280> my<00:05:41.340> game<00:05:41.400> are<00:05:41.700> falling

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:42.030 
maybe other parts of my game are falling

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:42.380
