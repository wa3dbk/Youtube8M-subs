let's have some fun now I what this

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.300 
let's have some fun now I what this
plane<00:01:48.180> does<00:01:48.450> or<00:01:48.750> what<00:01:48.930> all<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.350> planes<00:01:49.649> do<00:01:50.009> is

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
plane does or what all the planes do is

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.210 
plane does or what all the planes do is
you<00:01:51.060> can<00:01:51.210> actually<00:01:51.409> destroy<00:01:52.409> and<00:01:52.799> I'm<00:01:52.860> not

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
you can actually destroy and I'm not

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.190 
you can actually destroy and I'm not
quite<00:01:53.430> sure<00:01:53.460> if<00:01:53.700> all<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.119> sound<00:01:54.600> is<00:01:54.750> a<00:01:54.780> bit<00:01:54.869> too

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
quite sure if all the sound is a bit too

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.590 
quite sure if all the sound is a bit too
loud<00:01:55.439> so<00:01:56.130> we'll<00:01:56.310> lower<00:01:56.820> it<00:01:57.000> down<00:01:57.060> it<00:01:57.479> does

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
loud so we'll lower it down it does

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.950 
loud so we'll lower it down it does
actually<00:01:57.780> make<00:01:58.020> quite<00:01:58.560> a<00:01:58.619> sound

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
actually make quite a sound

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.109 
actually make quite a sound
as<00:02:00.020> a<00:02:00.080> normal<00:02:00.740> a<00:02:00.799> normal<00:02:00.890> plane<00:02:01.400> should<00:02:01.909> make<00:02:02.090> a

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
as a normal a normal plane should make a

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:05.050 
as a normal a normal plane should make a
sound<00:02:02.390> but<00:02:02.990> it<00:02:03.320> does<00:02:03.590> destroy<00:02:04.190> some<00:02:04.520> of<00:02:04.640> the<00:02:04.790> am

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
sound but it does destroy some of the am

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.559 
sound but it does destroy some of the am
stuff<00:02:05.570> so<00:02:05.810> I<00:02:05.840> know<00:02:06.440> what<00:02:07.280> happened<00:02:07.670> no<00:02:08.420> I'm

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:08.569 
stuff so I know what happened no I'm

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:11.500 
stuff so I know what happened no I'm
stuck<00:02:09.020> ok<00:02:09.440> so<00:02:09.500> my<00:02:09.860> plane<00:02:10.250> fell<00:02:10.580> into<00:02:10.789> this<00:02:11.000> snow

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
stuck ok so my plane fell into this snow

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.380 
stuck ok so my plane fell into this snow
field<00:02:12.230> and<00:02:12.680> left<00:02:13.280> quite<00:02:13.580> a<00:02:13.610> bit<00:02:13.850> of<00:02:13.940> a<00:02:14.060> trail

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
field and left quite a bit of a trail

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.210 
field and left quite a bit of a trail
destruction<00:02:15.170> and<00:02:15.410> it<00:02:15.560> destroys<00:02:15.920> all<00:02:16.069> the

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
destruction and it destroys all the

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:17.949 
destruction and it destroys all the
blocks<00:02:16.459> that<00:02:16.670> it<00:02:16.790> comes<00:02:16.970> in<00:02:17.090> contact<00:02:17.270> with<00:02:17.750> but

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
blocks that it comes in contact with but

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:20.020 
blocks that it comes in contact with but
when<00:02:18.110> it<00:02:18.230> touches<00:02:18.470> too<00:02:18.800> many<00:02:18.950> blocks<00:02:19.250> it<00:02:19.520> just

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
when it touches too many blocks it just

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.750 
when it touches too many blocks it just
simply<00:02:20.300> destroys<00:02:20.959> itself<00:02:21.410> now<00:02:21.830> I<00:02:21.860> saw<00:02:22.550> that

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
simply destroys itself now I saw that

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.610 
simply destroys itself now I saw that
FPSRussia<00:02:23.480> did<00:02:23.810> a<00:02:24.050> video<00:02:24.319> on<00:02:24.500> the<00:02:24.910> mp44<00:02:25.910> and<00:02:26.620> he

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
FPSRussia did a video on the mp44 and he

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.650 
FPSRussia did a video on the mp44 and he
showed<00:02:27.920> off<00:02:27.950> how<00:02:28.340> good<00:02:28.640> it<00:02:28.730> can<00:02:28.760> be<00:02:28.940> so<00:02:29.330> let's

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
showed off how good it can be so let's

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.199 
showed off how good it can be so let's
see<00:02:29.870> how<00:02:29.900> I'm<00:02:30.319> the<00:02:30.500> plane<00:02:30.770> is<00:02:31.100> a<00:02:31.160> durable<00:02:31.940> under

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
see how I'm the plane is a durable under

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:34.449 
see how I'm the plane is a durable under
these<00:02:32.360> attacks<00:02:32.930> ok<00:02:33.680> so<00:02:33.739> we<00:02:33.980> got<00:02:34.100> one<00:02:34.280> of<00:02:34.370> these

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
these attacks ok so we got one of these

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:36.970 
these attacks ok so we got one of these
red<00:02:34.820> planes<00:02:35.180> and<00:02:35.570> we're<00:02:36.110> going<00:02:36.230> to<00:02:36.260> unload<00:02:36.739> a

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
red planes and we're going to unload a

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.400 
red planes and we're going to unload a
bit<00:02:37.430> of<00:02:37.550> a<00:02:37.670> bit<00:02:38.060> of<00:02:38.150> a<00:02:38.300> steam<00:02:38.840> engine<00:02:39.050> right

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
bit of a bit of a steam engine right

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.140 
bit of a bit of a steam engine right
there<00:02:39.680> and<00:02:39.890> they<00:02:39.980> let's<00:02:40.160> see<00:02:40.340> how<00:02:40.519> much<00:02:40.730> this

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
there and they let's see how much this

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.600 
there and they let's see how much this
plane<00:02:41.510> can<00:02:41.780> with<00:02:42.110> handle<00:02:42.650> all<00:02:43.220> right<00:02:43.340> so<00:02:43.519> the

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
plane can with handle all right so the

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.560 
plane can with handle all right so the
plane<00:02:43.910> after<00:02:44.180> one<00:02:44.540> clip<00:02:44.900> is<00:02:45.080> on<00:02:45.260> fire<00:02:45.650> and

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
plane after one clip is on fire and

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:48.820 
plane after one clip is on fire and
shortly<00:02:47.570> through<00:02:47.840> the<00:02:47.959> other<00:02:48.110> clip<00:02:48.380> it<00:02:48.590> just

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
shortly through the other clip it just

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:51.670 
shortly through the other clip it just
destroys<00:02:49.250> itself<00:02:49.610> so<00:02:50.390> let's<00:02:51.080> so<00:02:51.230> let's<00:02:51.260> take<00:02:51.650> a

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
destroys itself so let's so let's take a

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.699 
destroys itself so let's so let's take a
look<00:02:51.980> at<00:02:52.040> this<00:02:52.690> yeah<00:02:53.690> we're<00:02:54.170> gonna<00:02:54.290> have<00:02:54.680> a

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
look at this yeah we're gonna have a

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:56.110 
look at this yeah we're gonna have a
little<00:02:54.890> bit<00:02:55.100> of<00:02:55.130> fun<00:02:55.400> with<00:02:55.430> this<00:02:55.550> big<00:02:55.850> plane

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
little bit of fun with this big plane

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.199 
little bit of fun with this big plane
and<00:02:56.360> like<00:02:57.140> all<00:02:57.380> good<00:02:57.620> FPSRussia<00:02:58.340> videos<00:02:58.760> there

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
and like all good FPSRussia videos there

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:02.680 
and like all good FPSRussia videos there
is<00:02:59.450> a<00:02:59.480> lot<00:03:00.110> of<00:03:00.170> explosions<00:03:00.860> so<00:03:01.550> are<00:03:01.760> we<00:03:02.450> need<00:03:02.600> to

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
is a lot of explosions so are we need to

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:05.050 
is a lot of explosions so are we need to
use<00:03:02.840> this<00:03:03.019> panda<00:03:03.500> Schreck<00:03:03.860> and<00:03:04.010> a<00:03:04.579> destroy

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
use this panda Schreck and a destroy

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:10.000 
use this panda Schreck and a destroy
this<00:03:05.209> big-ass<00:03:05.660> plane<00:03:07.900> ok<00:03:08.900> it's<00:03:09.350> not<00:03:09.530> working

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
this big-ass plane ok it's not working

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.930 
this big-ass plane ok it's not working
so<00:03:10.190> you<00:03:10.250> know<00:03:10.310> what<00:03:10.519> we're<00:03:10.610> gonna<00:03:10.730> do<00:03:10.850> we're

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
so you know what we're gonna do we're

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.539 
so you know what we're gonna do we're
going<00:03:11.060> to<00:03:11.150> do<00:03:11.239> like<00:03:11.390> an<00:03:11.510> FPS<00:03:11.989> style<00:03:12.549> FPSRussia

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:13.549 
going to do like an FPS style FPSRussia

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:15.280 
going to do like an FPS style FPSRussia
thing<00:03:13.940> and<00:03:14.150> that<00:03:14.269> we're<00:03:14.360> gonna<00:03:14.450> load<00:03:15.019> it<00:03:15.049> up

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
thing and that we're gonna load it up

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.220 
thing and that we're gonna load it up
with<00:03:15.320> TNT<00:03:16.100> ok<00:03:16.549> so<00:03:16.610> we<00:03:17.540> filled<00:03:17.810> it<00:03:17.900> up<00:03:17.989> with<00:03:18.049> a

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
with TNT ok so we filled it up with a

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.770 
with TNT ok so we filled it up with a
little<00:03:18.440> bit<00:03:18.769> of<00:03:18.829> TT<00:03:19.430> and<00:03:19.610> out<00:03:19.880> let's<00:03:20.120> see<00:03:20.420> that

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
little bit of TT and out let's see that

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:33.900 
little bit of TT and out let's see that
we<00:03:20.930> can<00:03:21.140> destroy<00:03:21.530> this<00:03:21.680> our<00:03:22.010> big-ass<00:03:22.549> plane

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.940 

okay<00:03:34.910> that<00:03:35.150> was<00:03:35.330> quite<00:03:35.930> impressive<00:03:35.990> that<00:03:36.770> was

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
okay that was quite impressive that was

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.520 
okay that was quite impressive that was
actually<00:03:37.160> very<00:03:37.400> impressive<00:03:38.390> of<00:03:38.540> the<00:03:38.720> TNT<00:03:39.319> to

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
actually very impressive of the TNT to

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.100 
actually very impressive of the TNT to
do<00:03:39.650> that<00:03:39.890> okay<00:03:40.459> so<00:03:40.520> it<00:03:40.910> is<00:03:41.030> the<00:03:41.180> April<00:03:41.540> first<00:03:41.750> in

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:42.110 
do that okay so it is the April first in

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:45.850 
do that okay so it is the April first in
Australia<00:03:42.830> so<00:03:43.130> I<00:03:43.160> decided<00:03:43.940> to<00:03:44.060> use<00:03:44.240> the<00:03:44.860> new

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:45.860 
Australia so I decided to use the new

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:47.740 
Australia so I decided to use the new
arena<00:03:46.190> and<00:03:46.550> now<00:03:47.000> we're<00:03:47.120> going<00:03:47.240> to<00:03:47.300> test<00:03:47.510> out

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 
arena and now we're going to test out

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:49.900 
arena and now we're going to test out
this<00:03:48.080> is<00:03:48.290> called<00:03:48.560> the<00:03:48.709> bomber<00:03:49.250> and<00:03:49.580> we're

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 
this is called the bomber and we're

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:51.490 
this is called the bomber and we're
going<00:03:50.030> to<00:03:50.060> test<00:03:50.270> out<00:03:50.510> what<00:03:50.840> it's<00:03:51.080> a<00:03:51.230> bombing

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
going to test out what it's a bombing

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.560 
going to test out what it's a bombing
capabilities<00:03:52.280> are<00:03:52.520> by<00:03:52.670> pressing<00:03:53.060> V<00:03:53.360> and

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:53.570 
capabilities are by pressing V and

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:56.080 
capabilities are by pressing V and
dropping<00:03:54.470> the<00:03:54.590> bombs<00:03:54.860> and<00:03:55.130> there<00:03:55.580> we<00:03:55.730> go<00:03:55.880> can

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
dropping the bombs and there we go can

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.420 
dropping the bombs and there we go can
we<00:03:56.120> see<00:03:56.360> the<00:03:56.480> explosion<00:03:57.080> we<00:03:57.709> see<00:03:57.980> a<00:03:58.010> little<00:03:58.310> bit

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
we see the explosion we see a little bit

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.150 
we see the explosion we see a little bit
of<00:03:58.489> explosion<00:03:59.120> and<00:03:59.300> this<00:03:59.810> is<00:03:59.989> the<00:04:00.560> large<00:04:00.800> bomb

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.160 
of explosion and this is the large bomb

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.010 
of explosion and this is the large bomb
that<00:04:01.400> we're<00:04:01.550> using<00:04:01.760> it<00:04:02.120> isn't<00:04:02.390> all<00:04:02.510> that<00:04:02.540> all

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:03.020 
that we're using it isn't all that all
