Step one: Right click the task bar (or crtl + alt + delete)

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.500
Step two: Find the one of these processes: java.exe for browser, or jagexlauncher.exe for game client. In this case, it will be java.exe

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Step 3: Right click on the process and go to "select priority" and click high or realtime. This will redistribute the lag, not get rid of it entirely.

00:00:48.166 --> 00:00:52.166

It's quite simple. All you do is go to setting and click on graphics setting and choose which one you want!

00:02:32.266 --> 00:02:36.266
I recommend minimum, as it gives the best results, but doesn't look nice.

00:03:09.933 --> 00:03:14.866
