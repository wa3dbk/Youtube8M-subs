a<00:00:30.420> little<00:00:30.510> easier<00:00:30.779> but<00:00:31.140> we<00:00:31.230> want<00:00:31.380> to<00:00:31.439> jump

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
a little easier but we want to jump

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.620 
a little easier but we want to jump
right<00:00:31.740> into<00:00:32.040> it<00:00:32.250> we're<00:00:32.790> going<00:00:32.910> to<00:00:32.969> go<00:00:33.030> six<00:00:33.360> reps

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
right into it we're going to go six reps

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.090 
right into it we're going to go six reps
we're<00:00:33.840> gonna<00:00:33.930> be<00:00:34.020> real<00:00:34.260> exposed<00:00:34.680> we're<00:00:34.890> going

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
we're gonna be real exposed we're going

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.400 
we're gonna be real exposed we're going
upwards<00:00:35.610> right<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.149> lip<00:00:36.500> good<00:00:39.170> very<00:00:40.170> nice

to<00:00:43.410> be<00:00:43.829> as<00:00:43.920> explosive<00:00:44.879> as<00:00:44.969> possible<00:00:45.660> we're

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
to be as explosive as possible we're

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.650 
to be as explosive as possible we're
trying<00:00:46.260> to<00:00:46.410> work<00:00:46.620> to<00:00:47.010> drive<00:00:47.370> your<00:00:48.120> opponent<00:00:48.570> up

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
trying to work to drive your opponent up

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.680 
trying to work to drive your opponent up
and<00:00:48.960> you<00:00:49.500> stay<00:00:49.829> low<00:00:50.190> if<00:00:50.730> you<00:00:50.910> go<00:00:51.090> up<00:00:51.329> then<00:00:51.570> you

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
and you stay low if you go up then you

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.119 
and you stay low if you go up then you
know<00:00:51.809> as<00:00:51.960> well<00:00:52.079> as<00:00:52.140> I<00:00:52.379> do<00:00:52.440> that<00:00:52.770> lineman's

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
know as well as I do that lineman's

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.229 
know as well as I do that lineman's
gonna<00:00:53.280> be<00:00:53.340> able<00:00:53.399> move<00:00:53.610> you<00:00:53.670> right<00:00:53.730> out<00:00:54.059> of<00:00:54.090> the

gonna be able move you right out of the

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.180 
gonna be able move you right out of the
way<00:00:54.420> so<00:00:54.660> be<00:00:54.899> sure<00:00:55.110> you<00:00:55.350> keep<00:00:55.500> your<00:00:55.559> low<00:00:55.829> center

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
way so be sure you keep your low center

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.490 
way so be sure you keep your low center
of<00:00:56.219> gravity<00:00:56.309> and<00:00:56.820> work<00:00:57.210> for<00:00:57.390> power<00:00:57.660> every<00:00:58.230> rep

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
of gravity and work for power every rep

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.410 
of gravity and work for power every rep
if<00:00:58.890> you're<00:00:59.070> not<00:00:59.219> pushing<00:00:59.609> and<00:01:00.030> you're<00:01:00.329> not

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
if you're not pushing and you're not

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.389 
if you're not pushing and you're not
trying<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:00.780> be<00:01:00.899> quick<00:01:01.199> you're<00:01:01.859> never<00:01:02.129> going<00:01:02.370> to

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
trying to be quick you're never going to

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.820 
trying to be quick you're never going to
get<00:01:02.579> more<00:01:02.820> explosive<00:01:03.629> so<00:01:04.110> again<00:01:04.320> we<00:01:04.409> stay<00:01:04.619> low

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
get more explosive so again we stay low

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.920 
get more explosive so again we stay low
and<00:01:05.129> we<00:01:05.519> be<00:01:05.670> as<00:01:05.790> explosive<00:01:06.330> lupan<00:01:06.720> we<00:01:06.810> got<00:01:06.900> a

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
and we be as explosive lupan we got a

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.740 
and we be as explosive lupan we got a
six<00:01:07.290> reps<00:01:07.530> we<00:01:07.710> go

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.859 

very<00:01:11.750> good<00:01:11.990> relax<00:01:12.969> also<00:01:13.969> remember<00:01:14.299> you've<00:01:14.840> got

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:14.869 
very good relax also remember you've got

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:16.300 
very good relax also remember you've got
to<00:01:15.109> start<00:01:15.289> trying<00:01:15.530> to<00:01:15.560> forget<00:01:15.829> yourself

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
to start trying to forget yourself

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.330 
to start trying to forget yourself
mentally<00:01:17.140> thinking<00:01:18.140> more<00:01:18.560> explosive<00:01:19.130> as<00:01:19.189> soon

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
mentally thinking more explosive as soon

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.279 
mentally thinking more explosive as soon
as<00:01:19.460> your<00:01:19.579> arms<00:01:19.819> come<00:01:20.000> back<00:01:20.030> down<00:01:20.210> you<00:01:21.049> got<00:01:21.200> to

00:01:21.279 --> 00:01:21.289 
as your arms come back down you got to

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:23.380 
as your arms come back down you got to
be<00:01:21.350> ready<00:01:21.530> to<00:01:21.649> explode<00:01:21.920> if<00:01:22.819> you're<00:01:23.060> waiting

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
be ready to explode if you're waiting

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:24.850 
be ready to explode if you're waiting
and<00:01:23.689> trying<00:01:23.810> to<00:01:23.990> get<00:01:24.049> set<00:01:24.380> in<00:01:24.409> between<00:01:24.829> each

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 
and trying to get set in between each

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.080 
and trying to get set in between each
rep<00:01:25.189> that's<00:01:25.369> not<00:01:25.520> really<00:01:25.700> what<00:01:25.789> we're<00:01:25.939> going

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
rep that's not really what we're going

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:27.429 
rep that's not really what we're going
for<00:01:26.209> goal<00:01:26.630> for<00:01:26.840> a<00:01:26.869> little<00:01:27.020> bit<00:01:27.140> more<00:01:27.319> of<00:01:27.409> a

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:27.439 
for goal for a little bit more of a

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:28.959 
for goal for a little bit more of a
plyometric<00:01:28.159> effect<00:01:28.490> here<00:01:28.700> so<00:01:28.880> we're

00:01:28.959 --> 00:01:28.969 
plyometric effect here so we're

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:30.940 
plyometric effect here so we're
overloading<00:01:29.509> the<00:01:29.569> muscle<00:01:29.899> and<00:01:30.530> then<00:01:30.619> we<00:01:30.709> go

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
overloading the muscle and then we go

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:32.559 
overloading the muscle and then we go
back<00:01:30.979> we're<00:01:31.310> overload<00:01:31.609> the<00:01:31.729> muscle<00:01:32.030> coming

00:01:32.559 --> 00:01:32.569 
back we're overload the muscle coming

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:34.889 
back we're overload the muscle coming
back<00:01:32.750> right<00:01:33.109> so<00:01:33.530> we<00:01:33.590> got<00:01:33.649> one<00:01:33.979> more<00:01:34.130> set<00:01:34.490> here

00:01:34.889 --> 00:01:34.899 
back right so we got one more set here

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:42.520 
back right so we got one more set here
six<00:01:35.899> reps<00:01:40.149> very<00:01:41.149> nice<00:01:41.360> very<00:01:41.780> nice<00:01:42.020> that's

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
six reps very nice very nice that's
