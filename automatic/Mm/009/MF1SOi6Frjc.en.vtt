00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:13.740
 fail bla I just wanted a 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:15.379
 screen then have synonymous because of cancer 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.940
 interrupted to europe 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:20.520
 so only new hello and sincerely 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.410
 welcome back to let's play world of 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:27.869
 tanks on the test servers with prescription 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:30.119
 on the 20 medium new animal the one 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:35.160
 the first funny thing is the icon that sees 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:38.910
 really a bit funny from the left because 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:41.270
 because the ass looks so slightly higher 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.500
 from such an idea 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:46.010
 it will go so high what is there 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:50.879
 nothing as high as the front said 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:54.120
 Well, I'm not going any further now 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:57.090
 I would have everyone with the bachelor 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:01.260
 from the time the rapid us here 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:05.850
 by itches so apparently no and 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:07.860
 i 'll get them now with the four hp yes 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.229
 and with that a good stop 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.030
 so I do not have one here 100% 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.270
 cristina I was not money 75 years 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:18.570
 had and otherwise stop there I have nothing 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:22.380
 as always and then I have the here 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:24.780
 pixel camouflage village and yes the band 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.700
 things as they are from 1650, I do not know 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.670
 I always write that on, I mean 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.780
 can just look a bit stupid though 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.670
 no matter 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.930
 as you can see it is deceptively real 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:42.009
 aiming problem is really bad 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:46.420
 but the case is bad 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:50.680
 of course, bad and over you 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:54.549
 Craps power because it goes on anyway 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.570
 Well , that's not so it really has to be there 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:02:02.500
 we definitely need emmingen 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:04.060
 speed and 9 percent well so he has 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.690
 a wall armor of 100 millimeters 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.820
 and a page 80 so head-on 180 is 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:16.780
 Of course not much the contrary 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:18.300
 he is relatively little and it can be too 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.739
 to become a problem 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.500
 All i wanna should not do everything 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:27.280
 go through like that, so zoom in 220 and 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:30.790
 As you can see, christa will see you soon 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.319
 panzner the marble does not come down 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.489
 but somehow with his colleague 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:36.130
 through the tower 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:38.410
 Well, the tower has 220 millimeters frontal 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:41.500
 and like all chinese mw is pretty 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:44.890
 oblique and that comes naturally 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.380
 quite difficult I could still meet 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.060
 may work now 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:51.130
 it comes here what I know it is 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:57.579
 brave there but I'll do it 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:03:00.820
 ready as brave well anyway 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:03.549
 he still has a damage of 303 7 550 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:08.200
 which is a lot for one 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:12.070
 medium and the punch of the 193 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:14.140
 until 321 so the Chinese have it real 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:15.510
 with her cannons I already on a lot 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.730
 Bumms 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:21.100
 and yes, I agree with that 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:24.730
 on a lot of boobs and long night time and 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:26.350
 after half-time, this tank has 55 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:30.810
 shot in the minute is really not much 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:30.810
 but I can live with it 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:41.459
 and I am open and I do 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:42.659
 of course a penetration and now 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:47.010
 equal to war from all sides 

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:53.610
 I would have and the 92 I hold now 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:56.299
 not where else to us 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:56.299
 still killed 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:02.250
 now come just once not to 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:12.290
 blaspheme or have times neat opponents 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:12.290
 yellow besch for you almost say better 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:22.700
 andreas hero rallye is passed 

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:27.500
 humid 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:29.540
 is yes and there I had again 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:32.450
 extreme view that I also stand 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:39.770
 I'm just as likely to stay 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:41.120
 shot off and that was really sorry for me 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:44.650
 my colleagues did not want to meet 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:46.850
 I still say something that was really close 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:52.330
 the experiment comparatively I believe 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:54.560
 that was it was the medium here too 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:57.770
 or no that was mister whitney the 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:59.270
 medium every 10a medium I have here 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:00.890
 have to take on the data has the 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:03.500
 same almost japans around 

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:05.240
 at the tower as well as at the wanner had 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:06.770
 each 20 mm more 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.050
 the match is exactly the same 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:09.920
 same cannon but has a bit 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:14.180
 more impact 

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:16.340
 it is not fair and shoots 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:24.290
 even 125 times more quickly shot 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:27.430
 the minute and yes they have real 

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:27.430
 neat tidy oomph 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:35.169
 normally I do not want them now 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:37.270
 not steal rudimentary but mw do 

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:40.389
 Of course I will be extra if you have the 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:43.919
 every day not at all and 

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:43.919
 The small is really bad 

00:05:47.759 --> 00:05:50.759
 interface 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:00.430
 I would say that was quite good 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:08.360
 for making nine a solo in 1 2100 

00:06:04.759 --> 00:06:16.099
 that is not so close to itself now 

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:18.849
 he is housed well 7000 damage 

00:06:16.099 --> 00:06:18.849
 Sick 

00:06:19.069 --> 00:06:30.949
 the game and is dead 

00:06:26.199 --> 00:06:36.590
 Well, so far so good what is still from 

00:06:30.949 --> 00:06:40.310
 testserver comes is 101 and another 

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:42.440
 fcm video what else 

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:46.610
 I hope as a teacher no idea how 

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:48.050
 it does not mean anything else 11 

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:50.060
 but is it just normal years in the 

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:52.430
 normal continue because I hold the us 

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:53.960
 usually I consider how to play 

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:56.199
 look and you hear them in the next 

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:56.199
 Video
