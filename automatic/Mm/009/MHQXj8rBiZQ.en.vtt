00:00:00.609 --> 00:00:04.920
 hello how welcome are you to this little crazy girl where we will learn how public 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.210
 an application from visual studios on the windows azure platform 

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:13.969
 in the project of cinemÃ³metros rolls in three configurations to save a purpose 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:15.139
 well done 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:18.139
 and we are going to select the public public option 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:22.869
 it is unfortunate that it is a sample we are going to add a new credential what we 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:26.079
 will allow us to communicate with the platform 

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:28.609
 chitin inn 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:33.140
 and we are going to create a certificate equals let's go to the platform 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.140
 windows 8 to be able to communicate with him 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.880
 let's see a certificate 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:42.840
 efe 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.900
 pf pc pts 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.340
 after midnight 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.390
 let's copy the path where the text certificate is found by another 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.390
 of the zulos on the platform windows azure 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:59.220
 while the windows platform something in what we have to do are three 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.060
 very important things 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:04.309
 the first one is to create a storage account 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:10.480
 we click on the swamps in environments we select an indelible mark 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.500
 where will this new account be located 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.740
 3 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.290
 efe 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:18.780
 It looked like an injury 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.020
 I prefer to lose 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.020
 the united states and click on accept 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.960
 the second step seek services 0 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.070
 for this we are served services peeling 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.520
 and we are going to create a name for this service 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.780
 expte 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.780
 efe 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.240
 3 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.150
 select a region 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.410
 already the important thing is in assumption is we simply do or select not 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:58.390
 implement 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.390
 we were going to click on accept 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:09.050
 the third step we are going to do air base the certificate that previously 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.209
 we generated in that study 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:13.729
 for this do not splash examine 

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:16.729
 it's just going to give pedals 

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:19.799
 and in accepting 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:24.439
 this is what will make pass certified I will assume the platform with which 

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:27.439
 we will be able to communicate refer to the study 

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:33.489
 once given that delicate between the platform windows azure 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:36.639
 let's review upwards your forecasts 

00:02:36.639 --> 00:02:38.189
 and we are going to copy this 

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:40.669
 this subscription idea 

00:02:40.669 --> 00:02:44.359
 we're going to take him up to 10 to the studio where he's going to finish 

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:47.599
 configure our identification 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:50.809
 we have a man special forces jee 

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:53.059
 this 

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:54.400
 we had illusion 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.070
 will automatically begin to be the platform to obtain more 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:59.599
 configurations 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:03.569
 we are going to have an environment of an injury I attended more information 

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:08.329
 our story breaks the fa cup that has already been configured previously 

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:13.089
 the configuration service that we want to use if it is the cloud service in 

00:03:13.089 --> 00:03:15.779
 flight lime 

00:03:15.779 --> 00:03:18.779
 and how we want to publish it without group realism 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:22.599
 last month and this is our publication 

00:03:24.669 --> 00:03:28.509
 having all this set up yet the only thing we have to do is click on 

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:30.539
 public 

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:34.359
 here what was done to the study unfreeze them application so that 

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:37.429
 there is no mistake and then take it to south mendoza 

00:03:38.219 --> 00:03:39.419
 in this tab 

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:43.019
 we can see what is running in treviso studio windows 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:43.819
 8 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:47.909
 at that moment what you are doing is publishing the application towards a 

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:50.909
 production environment in windows step 

00:03:52.719 --> 00:03:56.669
 a week to the risk population the study we returned to our 

00:03:56.669 --> 00:03:57.619
 platform 

00:03:57.619 --> 00:04:00.659
 where we can see that they do not accept the banner has an implementation 

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:03.609
 the minister was 

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:07.599
 Lastly we will click on the USSR application to prove that everything is 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:09.289
 working correctly 

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:10.159
 and there it is 

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:13.749
 this would be our first application also published the study
