00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730 
a third tier and as you can see approach

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.059 
a third tier and as you can see approach
bring<00:00:52.969> a<00:00:53.059> bit<00:00:53.210> bit<00:00:53.359> we<00:00:53.960> started<00:00:54.499> just<00:00:54.679> showing

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:55.069 
bring a bit bit we started just showing

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:57.069 
bring a bit bit we started just showing
you<00:00:55.609> know<00:00:55.760> what<00:00:55.909> the<00:00:55.999> type<00:00:56.210> of<00:00:56.239> height<00:00:56.780> will<00:00:57.050> be

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:57.079 
you know what the type of height will be

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:01.090 
you know what the type of height will be
on<00:00:57.710> this<00:00:58.129> and<00:00:58.690> it's<00:00:59.690> going<00:00:59.839> to<00:00:59.929> be<00:01:00.140> a<00:01:00.530> little

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
on this and it's going to be a little

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.770 
on this and it's going to be a little
bit<00:01:01.249> higher<00:01:01.429> than<00:01:01.609> that<00:01:01.670> so<00:01:01.999> that'd<00:01:02.569> be<00:01:02.600> the

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
bit higher than that so that'd be the

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.030 
bit higher than that so that'd be the
third<00:01:02.989> tier<00:01:03.260> so<00:01:03.440> we've<00:01:03.530> got<00:01:03.620> two<00:01:03.800> tiers
