00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:06.160
 Super handy and highly flexible our Tomoko 12 marriage 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.049
 just the right tool for everyone 

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:13.980
 want to edit the Styrofoam or similar and have all the freedom 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:14.650
 would like 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:17.699
 and sorry are those in the railway diorama 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.119
 their prototype 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:23.849
 or architecture model with knives rare and abrasive paper to body 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:26.369
 move 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.479
 that is, cutlery Chanukka 12 II stepped 

00:00:29.479 --> 00:00:33.419
 comes complete with five deformable special cutters 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.340
 a sounding safer system stronger for Marko Mattner's devices 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.400
 is also included 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.260
 that is, cutlery Amok a12 EHEC was specifically made for 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.260
 free modeling designed in these areas 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.480
 it is light and compact and the stones perform very well 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.140
 the advantage is obvious 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.600
 they shape the environment solely by the form of the NATO Council 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.920
 and the position of the device 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.170
 the narrow ridge is so thin 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.540
 that he can be bent by hand into any shape 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.950
 but stable enough 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.950
 to keep his shape while working too 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.730
 so the desired account is set starting on Christday 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:30.180
 and can be easily removed from our work piece 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.689
 This also means no fancy customs edges anymore 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:38.830
 and no crowns 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.830
 like when working with a knife and sandpaper 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.210
 it does not penetrate the material 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.499
 and can be steered with gentle pressure in the desired direction 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.250
 the result is different profiles 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.990
 was supported by landscapes with excellent surface quality 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.690
 additional flexibility to offer them the adjustment 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.080
 the stable the mushroom 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.450
 For example, different angles can be used 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.450
 can be adjusted on the upper brackets 

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:17.759
 Also, a large team of small is easily possible 

00:02:20.689 --> 00:02:24.079
 To cut slightly larger plates is the bracket in the rear area 

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:25.469
 flattened 

00:02:25.469 --> 00:02:29.389
 so he does not need too much space and can easily through the slot 

00:02:29.389 --> 00:02:32.609
 be guided 

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:35.769
 in the heights passage is 100 millimeters 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:38.519
 the projection 200 mm 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:43.109
 Thus, even thicker workpieces can be easily processed or 

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:46.109
 wide profiles are produced 

00:02:47.189 --> 00:02:50.969
 to the device optimally the working conditions as well as the materials 

00:02:50.969 --> 00:02:52.509
 to be able to adapt 

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:58.539
 the fast wire at the Basel Gate is infinitely variable up to approx. 350 Â° C 

00:02:58.539 --> 00:03:01.489
 and sensitively controllable 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:03.669
 depending on the material density and thickness 

00:03:03.669 --> 00:03:07.699
 can be achieved with a little exercise so an optimal cross-sectional image 

00:03:08.649 --> 00:03:10.519
 A rule of thumb 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:14.069
 the lower the temperature the lower the material 

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:20.829
 so versatile is the Tomoka 12 in the AHL for them 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:23.949
 A wide variety of applications predestined 

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:27.179
 not just a model railway builder 

00:03:27.179 --> 00:03:31.749
 Architects designers and decorators may also be addressed 

00:03:31.749 --> 00:03:34.349
 feel 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:35.880
 ideally suited 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.109
 is the Tambourkorps 12 out in every turn 

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:41.469
 for any fine work cultivation reservations 

00:03:41.469 --> 00:03:45.069
 and, of course, for those around the classic model maker 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:48.740
 we recommend as an accessory 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:52.019
 the pucks of Merz appliances from 2 at the pier 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:55.019
 for example our ng2 it 

00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:59.889
 Replacement cuts Art is easily available from specialist dealers 

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:05.819
 equipment 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:06.739
 with character
