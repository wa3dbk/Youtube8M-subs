00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:01.800 
so I want to make another video on meal

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.700 
so I want to make another video on meal
timing<00:00:02.129> and<00:00:02.520> me<00:00:03.120> and<00:00:03.240> Sven<00:00:03.330> had<00:00:03.659> made<00:00:03.929> a<00:00:04.200> video

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710 
timing and me and Sven had made a video

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.070 
timing and me and Sven had made a video
probably<00:00:05.609> about<00:00:05.790> two<00:00:06.089> months<00:00:06.270> back<00:00:06.629> talking

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
probably about two months back talking

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.020 
probably about two months back talking
about<00:00:07.259> this<00:00:07.410> issue<00:00:07.620> but<00:00:08.040> the<00:00:08.519> problem<00:00:08.880> was

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
about this issue but the problem was

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.330 
about this issue but the problem was
that<00:00:09.090> I<00:00:09.780> had<00:00:10.260> always<00:00:10.410> kind<00:00:10.740> of<00:00:10.830> depended<00:00:11.250> on

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
that I had always kind of depended on

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.549 
that I had always kind of depended on
meal<00:00:11.580> timing<00:00:11.880> and<00:00:12.179> basically<00:00:13.019> took<00:00:13.320> it<00:00:13.469> as

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
meal timing and basically took it as

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.950 
meal timing and basically took it as
fact<00:00:13.860> for<00:00:14.460> that<00:00:14.969> time<00:00:15.269> period<00:00:15.299> right<00:00:15.929> before

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
fact for that time period right before

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.099 
fact for that time period right before
making<00:00:16.470> that<00:00:16.619> video<00:00:16.859> and<00:00:17.420> when<00:00:18.420> we<00:00:18.900> actually

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
making that video and when we actually

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:20.929 
making that video and when we actually
made<00:00:19.439> that<00:00:19.590> video<00:00:19.740> was<00:00:20.010> actually<00:00:20.220> I<00:00:20.460> think<00:00:20.550> I

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
made that video was actually I think I

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.519 
made that video was actually I think I
believe<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:21.359> first<00:00:21.570> day<00:00:21.840> that<00:00:21.869> I<00:00:22.140> started

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
believe the first day that I started

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.130 
believe the first day that I started
applying<00:00:22.880> just<00:00:23.880> calories<00:00:24.359> in<00:00:24.539> calories<00:00:24.570> out

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
applying just calories in calories out

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.050 
applying just calories in calories out
throughout<00:00:25.529> the<00:00:25.740> day<00:00:25.949> and<00:00:26.279> not<00:00:26.849> really

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
throughout the day and not really

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.359 
throughout the day and not really
worrying<00:00:27.480> about<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:28.410> actual<00:00:28.710> timing<00:00:29.070> of<00:00:29.279> the

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
worrying about the actual timing of the

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.240 
worrying about the actual timing of the
meals<00:00:29.840> having<00:00:30.840> carbs<00:00:31.230> at<00:00:31.349> night<00:00:31.500> still<00:00:31.800> just

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
meals having carbs at night still just

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.479 
meals having carbs at night still just
as<00:00:32.399> long<00:00:32.579> as<00:00:32.610> I'm<00:00:32.820> getting<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.630> set<00:00:33.930> amount<00:00:34.260> of

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:34.489 
as long as I'm getting the set amount of

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:37.700 
as long as I'm getting the set amount of
calories<00:00:35.489> throughout<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.390> day<00:00:36.510> I<00:00:37.020> basically

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
calories throughout the day I basically

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.530 
calories throughout the day I basically
just<00:00:37.890> applied<00:00:38.430> that<00:00:38.700> and<00:00:39.000> it<00:00:39.149> was<00:00:39.239> going<00:00:39.450> to

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
just applied that and it was going to

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.389 
just applied that and it was going to
try<00:00:39.719> to<00:00:39.750> see<00:00:40.020> how<00:00:40.320> how<00:00:40.710> that<00:00:40.950> worked<00:00:41.190> out<00:00:41.340> for

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
try to see how how that worked out for

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.160 
try to see how how that worked out for
me<00:00:41.640> time<00:00:42.059> has<00:00:42.239> passed<00:00:42.480> been<00:00:42.719> about<00:00:42.930> two<00:00:43.140> months

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
me time has passed been about two months

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.170 
me time has passed been about two months
like<00:00:43.530> I<00:00:43.649> said<00:00:43.890> so<00:00:44.129> I<00:00:44.370> want<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:44.789> make<00:00:44.940> another

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
like I said so I want to make another

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.479 
like I said so I want to make another
video<00:00:45.450> on<00:00:45.899> it<00:00:46.469> and<00:00:46.649> just<00:00:46.710> talk<00:00:47.100> about<00:00:47.219> my

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
video on it and just talk about my

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.850 
video on it and just talk about my
experiences<00:00:48.149> and<00:00:48.480> talk<00:00:49.079> about<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.500> because

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
experiences and talk about the because

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.770 
experiences and talk about the because
I've<00:00:49.980> done<00:00:50.160> some<00:00:50.340> more<00:00:50.460> research<00:00:50.520> in<00:00:51.329> that<00:00:51.390> two

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
I've done some more research in that two

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.529 
I've done some more research in that two
month<00:00:52.020> amount<00:00:52.320> of<00:00:52.440> time<00:00:52.649> and<00:00:52.980> I<00:00:53.820> kind<00:00:54.300> of<00:00:54.390> have

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
month amount of time and I kind of have

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.540 
month amount of time and I kind of have
a<00:00:54.570> kind<00:00:55.260> of<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.500> same<00:00:55.680> perspective<00:00:55.890> on<00:00:56.280> it<00:00:56.309> and

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
a kind of the same perspective on it and

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:57.650 
a kind of the same perspective on it and
then<00:00:56.670> some<00:00:56.969> things<00:00:57.180> are<00:00:57.270> kind<00:00:57.449> of<00:00:57.510> different

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
then some things are kind of different

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.750 
then some things are kind of different
so<00:00:58.109> just<00:00:58.710> want<00:00:58.859> to<00:00:58.920> touch<00:00:59.100> on<00:00:59.280> those<00:00:59.489> real

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
so just want to touch on those real

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.349 
so just want to touch on those real
quick<00:00:59.969> as<00:01:00.660> far<00:01:00.989> as<00:01:01.370> do<00:01:02.370> i<00:01:02.430> think<00:01:02.760> meal<00:01:02.910> time<00:01:03.180> is

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
quick as far as do i think meal time is

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.320 
quick as far as do i think meal time is
important<00:01:03.899> now<00:01:04.110> after<00:01:04.610> after<00:01:05.610> these<00:01:06.119> two

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
important now after after these two

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.660 
important now after after these two
months<00:01:06.689> of<00:01:06.840> not<00:01:07.170> really<00:01:07.380> caring<00:01:08.130> about<00:01:08.340> meal

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
months of not really caring about meal

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.020 
months of not really caring about meal
timing<00:01:08.939> and<00:01:09.150> on<00:01:09.210> paying<00:01:09.570> no<00:01:09.720> attention<00:01:10.340> I<00:01:11.340> do

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
timing and on paying no attention I do

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.080 
timing and on paying no attention I do
think<00:01:12.479> it<00:01:12.659> is<00:01:12.720> important<00:01:13.350> but<00:01:13.619> for<00:01:14.460> reasons

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
think it is important but for reasons

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.200 
think it is important but for reasons
that<00:01:15.180> you<00:01:15.330> might<00:01:15.450> not<00:01:16.140> think<00:01:16.200> um<00:01:17.210> basically

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
that you might not think um basically

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.590 
that you might not think um basically
what<00:01:18.570> research<00:01:19.110> says<00:01:19.500> is<00:01:19.920> it's<00:01:20.909> more<00:01:21.180> in<00:01:21.330> favor

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
what research says is it's more in favor

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.280 
what research says is it's more in favor
of<00:01:21.950> meal<00:01:22.950> timing<00:01:23.250> not<00:01:23.520> mattering<00:01:23.939> because<00:01:24.390> in

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
of meal timing not mattering because in

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.100 
of meal timing not mattering because in
most<00:01:25.650> of<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:25.950> studies<00:01:26.189> that<00:01:26.340> have<00:01:26.820> been<00:01:26.880> done

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
most of the studies that have been done

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.440 
most of the studies that have been done
there<00:01:28.110> was<00:01:28.290> little<00:01:28.560> differences<00:01:29.250> between<00:01:29.490> the

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
there was little differences between the

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.649 
there was little differences between the
person<00:01:30.869> that<00:01:30.900> had<00:01:31.740> say<00:01:32.250> three<00:01:32.790> two<00:01:33.150> meals<00:01:33.450> a

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
person that had say three two meals a

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.510 
person that had say three two meals a
day<00:01:33.689> and<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:34.079> person<00:01:34.380> that<00:01:34.409> had<00:01:34.680> like<00:01:34.890> five<00:01:35.310> to

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
day and the person that had like five to

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.910 
day and the person that had like five to
eight<00:01:35.640> meals<00:01:35.850> a<00:01:36.030> day<00:01:36.060> here's<00:01:36.990> my<00:01:37.439> theory<00:01:37.799> and

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
eight meals a day here's my theory and

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.140 
eight meals a day here's my theory and
you<00:01:38.100> guys<00:01:38.220> can<00:01:38.430> let<00:01:38.549> me<00:01:38.670> know<00:01:38.790> what<00:01:38.909> you<00:01:39.000> think

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
you guys can let me know what you think

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.330 
you guys can let me know what you think
about<00:01:39.299> it<00:01:39.600> now<00:01:39.630> if<00:01:40.200> someone<00:01:40.530> comes<00:01:40.710> to<00:01:40.829> me<00:01:40.950> and

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
about it now if someone comes to me and

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.819 
about it now if someone comes to me and
they're<00:01:41.939> like<00:01:41.970> I<00:01:42.420> want<00:01:42.570> to<00:01:42.899> lose<00:01:43.049> weight<00:01:43.290> the

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
they're like I want to lose weight the

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.160 
they're like I want to lose weight the
first<00:01:44.159> thing<00:01:45.000> I'm<00:01:45.149> going<00:01:45.270> to<00:01:45.360> do<00:01:45.570> is<00:01:45.780> talk<00:01:45.990> to

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
first thing I'm going to do is talk to

between<00:02:16.110> so<00:02:17.099> the<00:02:17.579> reason<00:02:17.790> why<00:02:18.090> I<00:02:18.590> think<00:02:19.590> that

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
between so the reason why I think that

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.729 
between so the reason why I think that
meal<00:02:20.579> timing<00:02:20.879> could<00:02:21.239> help<00:02:21.569> people<00:02:22.200> like<00:02:22.530> this

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
meal timing could help people like this

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:26.089 
meal timing could help people like this
is<00:02:23.360> think<00:02:24.360> about<00:02:24.629> the<00:02:25.260> reason<00:02:25.620> why<00:02:25.739> you're<00:02:25.950> not

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099 
is think about the reason why you're not

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:28.970 
is think about the reason why you're not
supposed<00:02:26.489> to<00:02:26.579> go<00:02:27.090> grocery<00:02:27.599> shopping<00:02:27.810> on<00:02:28.470> an

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
supposed to go grocery shopping on an

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.640 
supposed to go grocery shopping on an
empty<00:02:29.129> stomach<00:02:29.459> or<00:02:29.819> go<00:02:30.239> hungry<00:02:30.480> it's<00:02:31.260> because

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
empty stomach or go hungry it's because

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.680 
empty stomach or go hungry it's because
when<00:02:32.159> you're<00:02:32.340> hungry<00:02:32.549> you<00:02:32.970> make<00:02:33.239> worse

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
when you're hungry you make worse

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.589 
when you're hungry you make worse
decisions<00:02:33.720> as<00:02:34.590> far<00:02:35.280> as<00:02:35.430> eating<00:02:35.640> go<00:02:35.909> so<00:02:36.209> if<00:02:36.450> I<00:02:36.569> go

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:36.599 
decisions as far as eating go so if I go

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:39.349 
decisions as far as eating go so if I go
to<00:02:36.810> the<00:02:36.959> grocery<00:02:37.140> store<00:02:37.319> on<00:02:37.769> an<00:02:38.760> empty<00:02:38.970> stomach

that time I don't think so I mean due to

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:32.629 
that time I don't think so I mean due to
the<00:03:31.590> research<00:03:31.949> and<00:03:32.160> due<00:03:32.250> to<00:03:32.280> my<00:03:32.519> own

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:32.639 
the research and due to my own

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:35.390 
the research and due to my own
experience<00:03:33.299> where<00:03:33.629> I<00:03:34.019> mean<00:03:34.859> I<00:03:34.889> have<00:03:35.160> five

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
experience where I mean I have five

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.740 
experience where I mean I have five
meals<00:03:35.579> a<00:03:35.730> day<00:03:35.760> but<00:03:35.970> that's<00:03:36.209> just<00:03:36.329> because<00:03:36.449> I

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
meals a day but that's just because I

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.250 
meals a day but that's just because I
don't<00:03:36.870> like<00:03:37.230> like<00:03:37.849> gorging<00:03:38.849> myself<00:03:39.180> in<00:03:40.019> one

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
don't like like gorging myself in one

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.280 
don't like like gorging myself in one
meal<00:03:40.620> and<00:03:41.010> eating<00:03:41.549> like<00:03:41.730> a<00:03:41.760> thousand<00:03:42.359> or<00:03:42.480> 1500

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
meal and eating like a thousand or 1500

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.189 
meal and eating like a thousand or 1500
calories<00:03:43.620> and<00:03:43.799> one<00:03:43.919> meal<00:03:44.129> not<00:03:44.489> because<00:03:44.879> I

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:45.199 
calories and one meal not because I

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:47.689 
calories and one meal not because I
think<00:03:46.199> I'm<00:03:46.349> going<00:03:46.530> to<00:03:46.590> store<00:03:47.190> most<00:03:47.400> of<00:03:47.549> it<00:03:47.639> as

00:03:47.689 --> 00:03:47.699 
think I'm going to store most of it as

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:49.039 
think I'm going to store most of it as
fat<00:03:47.910> or<00:03:48.060> anything<00:03:48.180> but<00:03:48.449> just<00:03:48.510> because<00:03:48.750> that's

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:49.049 
fat or anything but just because that's

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:51.020 
fat or anything but just because that's
just<00:03:49.319> I<00:03:49.530> don't<00:03:49.650> prefer<00:03:50.129> to<00:03:50.280> do<00:03:50.459> that<00:03:50.669> the

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
just I don't prefer to do that the

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.509 
just I don't prefer to do that the
longer<00:03:51.359> you<00:03:51.389> go<00:03:51.629> in<00:03:52.530> between<00:03:52.709> meals<00:03:53.160> and<00:03:53.459> the

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
longer you go in between meals and the

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:55.129 
longer you go in between meals and the
hungrier<00:03:54.000> get<00:03:54.239> let's<00:03:54.449> say<00:03:54.569> you<00:03:54.629> just<00:03:54.840> you<00:03:55.019> know

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:55.139 
hungrier get let's say you just you know

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:56.629 
hungrier get let's say you just you know
get<00:03:55.319> really<00:03:55.620> caught<00:03:55.799> up<00:03:55.829> in<00:03:56.129> things<00:03:56.310> and<00:03:56.519> you

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:56.639 
get really caught up in things and you

00:03:56.639 --> 00:04:00.199 
get really caught up in things and you
miss<00:03:56.849> a<00:03:57.060> meal<00:03:57.780> or<00:03:57.810> two<00:03:57.959> and<00:03:58.440> you<00:03:58.500> go<00:03:58.889> like<00:03:59.790> seven

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
miss a meal or two and you go like seven

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:02.300 
miss a meal or two and you go like seven
hours<00:04:00.329> six<00:04:00.959> hours<00:04:01.139> without<00:04:01.500> eating<00:04:01.889> a<00:04:02.099> meal

hungry<00:04:04.260> you<00:04:04.530> just<00:04:04.560> be<00:04:04.799> like<00:04:04.980> oh<00:04:05.159> my<00:04:05.340> god<00:04:05.489> I'm

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:05.609 
hungry you just be like oh my god I'm

hungry you just be like oh my god I'm
starving<00:04:05.730> I<00:04:05.970> just<00:04:06.150> need<00:04:06.269> to<00:04:06.419> eat<00:04:07.079> something

00:04:07.369 --> 00:04:07.379 
starving I just need to eat something

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:10.129 
starving I just need to eat something
right<00:04:07.680> now<00:04:07.709> and<00:04:08.129> to<00:04:08.790> me<00:04:08.970> you're<00:04:09.840> going<00:04:09.959> to<00:04:10.019> be<00:04:10.109> a

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:10.139 
right now and to me you're going to be a

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:13.460 
right now and to me you're going to be a
lot<00:04:10.409> more<00:04:10.440> likely<00:04:11.069> at<00:04:11.250> that<00:04:11.489> time<00:04:11.790> to<00:04:12.780> just

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
lot more likely at that time to just

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:14.960 
lot more likely at that time to just
basically<00:04:13.680> eat<00:04:13.979> something<00:04:14.310> that's<00:04:14.459> not<00:04:14.639> in

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
basically eat something that's not in

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.210 
basically eat something that's not in
your<00:04:15.000> diet<00:04:15.329> or<00:04:15.690> just<00:04:16.590> over<00:04:16.889> gorge<00:04:17.159> yourself

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
your diet or just over gorge yourself

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.969 
your diet or just over gorge yourself
and<00:04:17.699> end<00:04:17.820> up<00:04:17.940> being<00:04:18.239> in<00:04:18.419> a<00:04:18.870> calorie<00:04:19.260> surplus<00:04:19.500> at

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:19.979 
and end up being in a calorie surplus at

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:21.800 
and end up being in a calorie surplus at
the<00:04:20.099> end<00:04:20.250> of<00:04:20.340> the<00:04:20.430> day<00:04:20.609> instead<00:04:21.299> of<00:04:21.419> a<00:04:21.479> caloric

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
the end of the day instead of a caloric

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:24.529 
the end of the day instead of a caloric
deficit<00:04:22.320> that<00:04:22.560> you<00:04:22.800> sought<00:04:23.159> out<00:04:23.340> to<00:04:23.580> to<00:04:24.240> have

00:04:24.529 --> 00:04:24.539 
deficit that you sought out to to have

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:26.090 
deficit that you sought out to to have
you<00:04:25.169> know<00:04:25.289> by<00:04:25.440> the<00:04:25.500> end<00:04:25.590> of<00:04:25.740> the<00:04:25.830> day

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100 
you know by the end of the day

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.670 
you know by the end of the day
you're<00:04:26.190> losing<00:04:26.490> weight<00:04:26.570> so<00:04:27.570> this<00:04:27.840> this<00:04:28.170> by<00:04:28.620> the

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
you're losing weight so this this by the

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.530 
you're losing weight so this this by the
way<00:04:28.800> applies<00:04:29.250> to<00:04:29.520> mostly<00:04:29.820> people<00:04:30.240> that<00:04:30.390> are

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:30.540 
way applies to mostly people that are

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:33.260 
way applies to mostly people that are
just<00:04:30.720> trying<00:04:30.930> to<00:04:31.050> lose<00:04:31.230> weight<00:04:31.470> I<00:04:31.710> think<00:04:32.310> it's

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
just trying to lose weight I think it's

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.390 
just trying to lose weight I think it's
definitely<00:04:33.720> a<00:04:34.050> lot<00:04:34.290> less<00:04:34.560> important<00:04:35.130> when

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
definitely a lot less important when

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.740 
definitely a lot less important when
you're<00:04:35.520> trying<00:04:35.760> to<00:04:35.940> gain<00:04:36.120> weight<00:04:36.360> and<00:04:36.480> put<00:04:36.630> on

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750 
you're trying to gain weight and put on

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:38.720 
you're trying to gain weight and put on
muscle<00:04:36.990> that<00:04:37.590> point<00:04:37.920> I'd<00:04:38.040> say<00:04:38.280> you<00:04:38.340> know<00:04:38.550> just

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:38.730 
muscle that point I'd say you know just

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:40.040 
muscle that point I'd say you know just
long<00:04:38.910> as<00:04:39.000> you're<00:04:39.120> eating<00:04:39.150> clean<00:04:39.570> just<00:04:39.840> make

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
long as you're eating clean just make

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:41.930 
long as you're eating clean just make
sure<00:04:40.200> you're<00:04:40.350> at<00:04:40.470> a<00:04:40.500> calorie<00:04:41.190> surplus<00:04:41.370> and

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
sure you're at a calorie surplus and

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:43.610 
sure you're at a calorie surplus and
you'll<00:04:42.450> be<00:04:42.600> good<00:04:42.750> I<00:04:42.810> wouldn't<00:04:43.170> I<00:04:43.320> definitely

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
you'll be good I wouldn't I definitely

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.200 
you'll be good I wouldn't I definitely
would<00:04:43.830> really<00:04:44.190> worried<00:04:44.520> about<00:04:44.610> meal<00:04:44.940> timing

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
would really worried about meal timing

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:46.940 
would really worried about meal timing
at<00:04:45.420> all<00:04:45.540> at<00:04:45.660> that<00:04:45.720> point<00:04:46.080> but<00:04:46.260> for<00:04:46.770> someone

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:46.950 
at all at that point but for someone

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:48.350 
at all at that point but for someone
losing<00:04:47.370> weight<00:04:47.520> and<00:04:47.640> especially<00:04:47.940> someone

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
losing weight and especially someone

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.020 
losing weight and especially someone
just<00:04:48.720> starting<00:04:49.110> out<00:04:49.290> with<00:04:50.100> with<00:04:50.490> the<00:04:50.520> routine

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
just starting out with with the routine

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:53.780 
just starting out with with the routine
I'd<00:04:51.780> say<00:04:52.020> that<00:04:52.050> that<00:04:52.530> those<00:04:53.070> things<00:04:53.280> are<00:04:53.460> a<00:04:53.520> lot

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:53.790 
I'd say that that those things are a lot

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:56.540 
I'd say that that those things are a lot
more<00:04:54.150> likely<00:04:54.900> to<00:04:55.050> happen<00:04:55.230> especially<00:04:55.890> because

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
more likely to happen especially because

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:59.240 
more likely to happen especially because
they're<00:04:56.730> so<00:04:56.910> used<00:04:57.180> to<00:04:57.360> eating<00:04:57.600> junk<00:04:58.590> food<00:04:58.770> and

00:04:59.240 --> 00:04:59.250 
they're so used to eating junk food and

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:01.970 
they're so used to eating junk food and
and<00:04:59.490> they're<00:04:59.880> not<00:05:00.000> used<00:05:00.300> to<00:05:00.560> having<00:05:01.560> more<00:05:01.800> of<00:05:01.920> a

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:01.980 
and they're not used to having more of a

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:04.370 
and they're not used to having more of a
structure<00:05:02.310> and<00:05:02.550> eating<00:05:02.850> clean<00:05:03.230> when<00:05:04.230> you're

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:04.380 
structure and eating clean when you're
