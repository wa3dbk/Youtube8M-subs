00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:08.019
 good guys today the sky series began 

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:09.700
 link since it says improve a bit 

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:12.849
 the shit of this one 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:16.059
 lahood and then I introduce myself the 

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:19.119
 guards everywhere and well I'm going to 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:21.960
 continue as a kind of speed fed up 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:24.990
 shit these until you get to 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.730
 to the place where I was pretty much 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.150
 and good that I'm going to pass it all 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.210
 fast a little faster as if 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.200
 was the most advanced speed and 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:37.230
 until we get more or less where we were 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.070
 it was a little touch the days is a 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.530
 little more at the end 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.660
 and good that I'm going to start the series of 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:46.710
 new 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.360
 it's alright I'm going to better I'll touch the 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.870
 anesthetize the bugs that you have tried to 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:54.270
 the bad ones but I'm not going to charge me 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.160
 people of the town because then what happens 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.790
 it happens that you can not play well 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.410
 because they can not leave anywhere 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:04.449
 where all are chasing everyone 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:08.310
 the guards and good 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:08.310
 I'm going to start all over again 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.960
 I hope this series is the definitive one 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:17.460
 and do not fuck it again 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.970
 and good 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.540
 I leave the video here 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.540
 see you later 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:15.980
 what the fuck is this what the fuck is 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:19.330
 this supports a shit with a hook in there 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.330
 this circus is not this 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:27.470
 If you have a vein of Ghent 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.470
 of a lobster 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.090
 take please 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.100
 it was postponed to the neck 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:02.170
 good 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:02.170
 improves a little to a hand 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:07.910
 and 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:12.910
 shit and the turn finish 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:12.910
 well better short and good to start
