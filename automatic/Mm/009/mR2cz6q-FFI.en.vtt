00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:16.039
 There is no real data on what 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:22.010
 climate weapons exist that's all 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:23.960
 from the field of those programs means secretly and 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:26.060
 obviously I don't know the territory there 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.310
 delusions and other stuff which 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.890
 You know there is a yellow press from yellow 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.480
 television here's yellow television very 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.950
 love to discuss this topic not 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.340
 reason so far for today 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.989
 no real 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.640
 really the basics of a real reason to talk 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:42.289
 about the existence of climate weapons not 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:46.370
 then no first of all that's why i tell you 

00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:48.850
 say in climate change in motion 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.850
 air masses 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.000
 involved huge 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.859
 fantastic amount of energy one 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.699
 some kind of a cyclone over a quiet 

00:00:54.859 --> 00:01:00.800
 by the ocean he carries energy and again on 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:05.059
 order is greater than all nuclear stocks 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:07.520
 humanity is aggregate and people are not 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:09.440
 learned how to manage this here 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.140
 gigantic energy flows 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:14.360
 scale that is what happens in 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:18.280
 atmosphere movement cyclones in moving 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.970
 air flow masses in the ocean to 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.840
 volcanic activity 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:26.860
 this whole phenomenon on the scale of its on 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:29.630
 many orders of magnitude higher than man-made 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.640
 human activity one volcano 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:35.119
 ejects during its eruption 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:38.689
 what a decent middle volcano 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:40.790
 more energy than all the time 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:43.149
 it was blown up all the bambras atomic they 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:45.640
 atomic and it was sajina 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:47.900
 fuel in all 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.420
 thermal power plant for all their time 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:52.850
 of existence 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.950
 that is, the idea of ​​course is the idea 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.240
 is that no point 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.790
 impacts if you know where 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:02.150
 Impact can be possible 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:05.120
 so yes these processes to manage 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:07.670
 but really there is no reason yet 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:10.220
 assume that this is the maximum that we 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:13.340
 we can in the area to carry the climate from 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.960
 for example on the day of victory to disperse the clouds 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.840
 over the red square in order to 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:19.850
 veterans could not pallet under umbrellas 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.430
 and not in raincoats to look at the apparatus 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:25.600
 sit and look admire built 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.600
 the walk of their grandchildren
