00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:11.350
 Hello 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:15.670
 I would like to share with you some 

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:18.939
 inferences perhaps blogging advice 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:20.779
 share experience well how to go to 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:23.599
 single write like 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:26.300
 some when wanted super-ship 1 on foot 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:29.300
 campaign in our time rescued villages familiar 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:34.820
 there were hands you think I didn't joke 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:36.649
 why bother doing this with people who love 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.989
 go on a solo hike i'm ahead of it 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:41.780
 Of course, prepared to learn it at all 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:44.120
 possible to keep walking i mean i 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:48.280
 principle has already joined such people 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:50.989
 but everybody goes, that is the reason for all the different 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.210
 someone may have got pasta and someone 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:55.280
 there are people some of them unsociable 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:58.550
 just people and ok yourself thatâ€™s yourself so not 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:01.309
 I rank because I am by profession 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:05.750
 so do life more than me 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:08.620
 sociable but then the question is of course yes out 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:11.900
 addictions when you go in a group 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:14.420
 you always depend on which one 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.110
 speed comes the rest that is 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.880
 either you 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:21.860
 customize any who make sure 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:23.990
 lagging behind it really can and the first day 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.550
 Having endured even as early as the third day 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.560
 on purpose 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:30.530
 just going to piss off 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.640
 until all in one rhythm will merge as well 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.860
 constantly compromises 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.770
 as you see yourself no compromise you 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.810
 don't you care about yourself master yourself 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:42.009
 the smallest route or wanted yes I 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:46.070
 became where I wanted there stopped 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:51.140
 but there are certainly a number of minuses with which 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:54.140
 you have to accept that minus of course 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:59.899
 I would not like to talk about cons but 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:04.399
 after all they are the main thing this is the first you 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:06.590
 eat when security itself is already in 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:08.269
 greater danger than when children 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:12.650
 the group although the group is also not insured 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:15.170
 from all sorts of different encounters beasts on two 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.580
 legs this is the most dangerous beast in fact 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:20.390
 business 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:23.630
 how do you all know the second weight which 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:28.220
 pull out all your luggage 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:30.500
 gear it will be all on you in a group then 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.810
 can be divided into several people 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.540
 let's say someone carries water someone well then 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:39.320
 there are necessarily strategic ones 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:41.359
 so let this pot so you can 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:43.760
 distribute take a bowler one at all 

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:46.489
 right there already plateau yes not 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:50.180
 everyone will think himself again 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:52.700
 health is acceptable if you suddenly 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:56.120
 turned up the science of their carelessness well 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:58.970
 anything can just not happen 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.750
 anything let the hidden fossa there once 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.540
 sprained foot 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.579
 that is , the team of course it's better there 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:08.060
 someone you if you posed but 

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:09.920
 ran called there let's say on the track in 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:13.609
 my car and something in that spirit 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.799
 and so all you have to somehow count 

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:17.450
 on the fact that 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:18.980
 you will gag yourself and you will be tormented 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:22.710
 myself 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:26.190
 so you need to be the most important principle 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:28.680
 walking alone to the whole campaign 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.960
 it needs to be very careful a 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.090
 alone it at all 

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:37.920
 all the time on your guard imagine how 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:40.290
 that the war and the wild beasts against you this 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.540
 it turns out they want to think about a plan 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:45.480
 psychologically I always walked along I 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:47.610
 tried all the thoughts we and dangers 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:50.720
 know everything about yourself well we are only good 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:53.400
 molotov contemplate what is happening around 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:56.310
 nature is there well what is not interested and 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.600
 when you go like this for later 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.370
 the rise is important to keep such 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.230
 emotional lift and everything then 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.870
 principle probably can as arranged 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:07.980
 screen learn the universe from so let's say 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:09.209
 if that does not draw well, or thoughts 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.880
 what it is not 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:15.390
 do not meet and when you are all the time 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:17.220
 think about clean thugs cut your there 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:21.060
 hour wolf jump out 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:24.540
 that's how Lipnitskaya herself was like that 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:26.280
 here and did not jump out weak but all sleep 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:32.330
 It was not because I screwed up 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:32.330
 video wolf tracks around
