00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:19.330
 hello everyone guys between slow manta and 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.759
 here I am with this new video a 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:24.489
 core to the kids on the carrier map 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:27.820
 as you can see you have a lot to offer 

00:00:24.489 --> 00:00:30.369
 so often of gameplay so on 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:34.750
 this map, however, I mean how 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:36.670
 you see the weapon this pescara casini there 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:39.730
 also called so oscar l boh not me 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:43.690
 I always confuse myself with with 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:47.590
 the other weapon of mv 2 and nuclear that 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:49.420
 I did with this weapon though without any 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.379
 accessory as you can see below a 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.590
 right 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:54.250
 cacchio is that you contact skype on off 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:58.390
 Facebook 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:01:00.550
 oh well then that was how you can 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.170
 see at the bottom right is written 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.699
 only scar h 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:09.789
 see now i've unlocked the charger 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:12.130
 quick however nothing 

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:14.619
 now I tell you an excellent specialty 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:18.610
 however, first I wanted to talk to you for a moment 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:22.569
 general of the weapon that is ok without 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:25.420
 accessories is not really that great even 

00:01:22.569 --> 00:01:28.080
 because it is not an excellent aim too 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:31.270
 being an assault rifle 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.800
 however there was the viewfinder with regards to 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.200
 you therefore like the viewfinder enough 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:39.970
 I don't think it needs a viewfinder 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:43.470
 however the handle goes there 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.470
 surely it definitely goes there 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:50.020
 and then and then ok, adjustable stock 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:55.360
 extraction anger as always on 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:57.070
 assault rifles while abele specialties 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.020
 he was using on the usual non 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:02.440
 see I'm repeating what I do 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:05.770
 for the nuclear the usual rewards 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:07.780
 the same or in contact with pisa anyway 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.929
 many of you were asking me why 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:15.730
 it is not instead of the av2 counterattack 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:19.150
 silea the mtv system explains a moment 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:23.320
 because if I 'm not mistaken in bell bussat yes 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:26.860
 takes about 1200 points while the MP to 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:28.090
 a little more also another 200 points points 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.810
 more emphasis 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:35.080
 so since he wants to have the radar e 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:38.650
 the radar center is always on 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:43.000
 I mean mussap for using the active 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:46.690
 I have to I have to take one every 45 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.510
 seconds because I think how much I think the 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:53.440
 taste lasts more or less 45 seconds then 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:55.600
 if if the cymettes mp that comes later 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.640
 that is, it takes me longer to resume 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:03.100
 another uses 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:06.250
 therefore I put ourselves as the last reward a 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:08.650
 point an orbital jump however guys 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:12.940
 I wanted to talk about that for a moment 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:15.239
 what I'm doing at this time is 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:18.640
 more or less two months than you know 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:21.040
 store on xbox but has not abandoned 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:25.299
 definitely the playstation 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:26.920
 I say sometimes he played me 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:30.670
 I say the main reason why I am 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:34.160
 just passed to the xbox 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:36.020
 ok mainly because 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.530
 oh well another reason is that they are there 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:41.890
 rovelli youtubers this is not really 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.890
 a fundamental thing 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:47.690
 but the thing that brought me that has it 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:49.820
 pushed to change consoles was that 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:52.310
 of competiti because I will explain for a moment 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:55.070
 on playstation this scene on 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:57.830
 competitive does not exist ie for 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:04:00.890
 at least there is the attempt to escape and 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:03.440
 they were that the guys sincerely loved me 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:05.270
 two guys don't really like it from mv 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.760
 have introduced this search for studies 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:09.800
 veteran who gives me nothing 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.900
 first there was also the search for 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:13.610
 escape recruit at least there it is 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:18.680
 I was more amused than the veteran 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:21.500
 never played because i think it's one 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:23.660
 how you need to camp enough 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:26.990
 because if someone finds you from behind in 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:29.330
 veteran you died while being considered if 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.740
 you got the certain schilder is you can anyway 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.390
 being able to kill what is yours 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:36.080
 behind 

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:39.220
 therefore precisely there is only search and 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:41.990
 destroy veteran on on playstation 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:46.010
 ok then there is the competitive with the 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:49.310
 sniper sniper though I think it is 

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:52.700
 stuck it stopped 693 while up 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:54.800
 xbox there is a mode I do not know if all the 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:59.630
 you know that there is one on this day 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:03.020
 called the certain that in a nutshell is 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:06.680
 the one that has the mode done 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:10.100
 with xp a los angeles which includes the 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:12.080
 certain and destroy station modes e 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:16.130
 catch the flag with some small ones 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:18.530
 change in my settings but nothing 

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:20.450
 important and therefore precisely I for 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:24.680
 this is why I am me 

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:26.840
 moved to this console for the 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:29.330
 playstation 3 guys like I like it 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:33.200
 a lot because I have to say that up 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:34.490
 playstation are in quotes a little 

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:36.200
 best known 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:41.900
 now more than I did some 

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:44.210
 match is in the robbie i found many more 

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:46.700
 people who knew me too 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:51.020
 because on xbox more or less everyone has us 

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:53.600
 sky youtube and boys anyway I wanted 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:55.400
 a moment to say one thing that nuclear 

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:57.050
 I 'll take it like the last second 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:59.330
 see it's missing 19 seconds I 'll take it 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:04.100
 the last second you will not see the 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:06.770
 medal of the nucleus because I will have the mp 

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:08.960
 so you won't be able to see it 

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:10.880
 now this is the rock for him here 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:12.500
 to the engraving of the thirty even 

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:16.310
 when he finished the game I didn't know 

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:17.600
 not even that it was over for the boys with 

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:19.580
 that video is finished 

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:21.440
 if you want guys some more on ps3 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:24.669
 we have to get to 500 light mi 

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:24.669
 I recommend beautiful girl
