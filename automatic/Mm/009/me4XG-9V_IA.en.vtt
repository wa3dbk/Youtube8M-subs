00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
printer this is a laser printer it is a

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.310 
printer this is a laser printer it is a
DC<00:00:13.860> pl2<00:00:17.060> the<00:00:18.060> model<00:00:18.359> numbers<00:00:18.600> too<00:00:18.720> confusing<00:00:19.080> I

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
DC pl2 the model numbers too confusing I

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.050 
DC pl2 the model numbers too confusing I
I<00:00:19.350> forgot<00:00:19.619> it<00:00:20.039> just<00:00:20.250> reading<00:00:20.490> the<00:00:20.580> video<00:00:20.760> title

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
I forgot it just reading the video title

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.060 
I forgot it just reading the video title
anyway<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.960> reason<00:00:22.140> I'm<00:00:22.320> not<00:00:22.380> doing<00:00:22.680> a<00:00:22.740> review

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
anyway the reason I'm not doing a review

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.800 
anyway the reason I'm not doing a review
of<00:00:23.220> this<00:00:23.369> is<00:00:23.609> because<00:00:23.939> I<00:00:23.970> don't<00:00:24.150> really<00:00:24.420> review

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
of this is because I don't really review

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.990 
of this is because I don't really review
and<00:00:24.990> compare<00:00:25.410> printers<00:00:26.010> so<00:00:26.609> if<00:00:26.670> I<00:00:26.760> were<00:00:26.880> to

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
and compare printers so if I were to

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.460 
and compare printers so if I were to
review<00:00:27.330> it<00:00:27.449> and<00:00:27.510> give<00:00:27.689> it<00:00:27.750> a<00:00:27.840> score<00:00:28.170> it<00:00:28.349> would

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
review it and give it a score it would

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.259 
review it and give it a score it would
be<00:00:28.590> unfair<00:00:29.010> so<00:00:29.250> just<00:00:29.429> decided<00:00:29.849> I'll<00:00:29.939> just<00:00:30.119> do

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
be unfair so just decided I'll just do

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.479 
be unfair so just decided I'll just do
an<00:00:30.390> overview<00:00:30.779> but<00:00:31.650> show<00:00:31.890> you<00:00:31.949> how<00:00:32.160> it<00:00:32.250> works

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
an overview but show you how it works

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.870 
an overview but show you how it works
and<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:33.210> speed<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:34.140> noise<00:00:34.469> output<00:00:34.739> on<00:00:35.219> just

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
and the speed the noise output on just

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.500 
and the speed the noise output on just
generally<00:00:36.210> how<00:00:36.390> it<00:00:36.660> works<00:00:36.950> I<00:00:38.300> feel<00:00:39.300> kind<00:00:39.480> of

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
generally how it works I feel kind of

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.000 
generally how it works I feel kind of
weird<00:00:39.690> making<00:00:40.170> a<00:00:40.260> video<00:00:40.500> on<00:00:40.530> a<00:00:40.620> printer<00:00:40.980> but

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
hey it's pretty expensive printer so I

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.630 
hey it's pretty expensive printer so I
guess<00:00:43.649> if<00:00:43.800> someone's<00:00:44.070> interested<00:00:44.309> in<00:00:44.430> buying

large<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.270> printer<00:00:54.570> itself<00:00:54.690> is<00:00:54.989> very<00:00:55.289> large

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
large the printer itself is very large

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.740 
large the printer itself is very large

a<00:01:03.030> rough<00:01:03.239> idea<00:01:03.449> as<00:01:03.539> to<00:01:03.690> how<00:01:03.840> loud<00:01:04.110> this<00:01:04.350> printer

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
a rough idea as to how loud this printer

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.890 
a rough idea as to how loud this printer
can<00:01:04.890> get<00:01:05.100> when<00:01:05.339> you<00:01:05.430> start<00:01:05.670> it<00:01:05.790> up<00:01:05.909> and<00:01:06.150> this

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
can get when you start it up and this

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.750 
can get when you start it up and this
roughly<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.590> same<00:01:07.860> volume<00:01:08.130> I'll<00:01:08.340> put<00:01:08.610> your

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
roughly the same volume I'll put your

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.070 
roughly the same volume I'll put your
beginning<00:01:09.180> when<00:01:09.299> you<00:01:09.360> actually<00:01:09.479> print<00:01:09.840> an

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
beginning when you actually print an

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:22.030 
beginning when you actually print an
actual<00:01:10.409> document<00:01:10.830> as<00:01:11.010> well

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.040 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.289 

so<00:01:23.040> that<00:01:23.130> initial<00:01:23.340> noise<00:01:23.700> you<00:01:23.850> just<00:01:23.880> heard<00:01:24.210> at

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
so that initial noise you just heard at

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:25.760 
so that initial noise you just heard at
the<00:01:24.360> beginning<00:01:24.450> that's<00:01:25.259> pretty<00:01:25.500> much<00:01:25.590> how

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
the beginning that's pretty much how

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.230 
the beginning that's pretty much how
loud<00:01:25.950> it<00:01:26.100> gets<00:01:26.130> and<00:01:26.579> now<00:01:26.850> you<00:01:26.909> can<00:01:27.119> your

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
loud it gets and now you can your

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.660 
loud it gets and now you can your
mechanics<00:01:27.720> working<00:01:27.960> inside<00:01:28.409> this<00:01:29.159> pretty

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
mechanics working inside this pretty

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.340 
mechanics working inside this pretty
much<00:01:29.850> as<00:01:30.060> loud<00:01:30.330> as<00:01:30.479> it's<00:01:30.659> going<00:01:30.810> to<00:01:30.899> get<00:01:31.140> even

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
much as loud as it's going to get even

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.039 
much as loud as it's going to get even
when<00:01:31.530> you're<00:01:31.619> printing<00:01:31.710> a<00:01:31.950> document<00:01:32.930> so<00:01:33.930> I<00:01:33.960> was

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
when you're printing a document so I was

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.240 
when you're printing a document so I was
able<00:01:34.140> to<00:01:34.289> get<00:01:34.380> this<00:01:34.470> printer<00:01:34.829> for<00:01:35.009> about<00:01:35.220> a

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
able to get this printer for about a

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.249 
able to get this printer for about a
hundred<00:01:35.460> dollars<00:01:35.880> Canadian<00:01:36.630> during<00:01:36.899> boxing

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
hundred dollars Canadian during boxing

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.630 
hundred dollars Canadian during boxing
week<00:01:37.380> sale<00:01:37.619> which<00:01:37.860> is<00:01:37.890> pretty<00:01:38.250> cheap<00:01:38.460> because

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
week sale which is pretty cheap because

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.109 
week sale which is pretty cheap because
here<00:01:38.909> in<00:01:39.000> Canada<00:01:39.360> averages<00:01:39.899> minimum<00:01:40.939> 160<00:01:41.939> and

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
here in Canada averages minimum 160 and

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.830 
here in Canada averages minimum 160 and
the<00:01:42.750> US<00:01:43.110> average<00:01:43.409> is<00:01:43.799> minimum<00:01:44.490> like<00:01:44.850> 145<00:01:45.810> I

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
the US average is minimum like 145 I

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.560 
the US average is minimum like 145 I
think<00:01:46.200> even<00:01:46.770> then<00:01:46.860> if<00:01:47.009> you're<00:01:47.130> lucky<00:01:47.450> so<00:01:48.450> the

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
think even then if you're lucky so the

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.630 
think even then if you're lucky so the
printer<00:01:48.840> is<00:01:48.960> pretty<00:01:49.170> expensive<00:01:49.320> it's<00:01:50.280> big

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
printer is pretty expensive it's big

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.550 
printer is pretty expensive it's big
it's<00:01:50.970> loud<00:01:51.209> only<00:01:51.750> prints<00:01:52.020> black<00:01:52.229> and<00:01:52.409> white

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
it's loud only prints black and white

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.169 
it's loud only prints black and white
now<00:01:53.130> you<00:01:53.190> might<00:01:53.490> be<00:01:53.520> wondering<00:01:53.729> why<00:01:54.000> would<00:01:54.149> I

00:01:54.169 --> 00:01:54.179 
now you might be wondering why would I

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:55.910 
now you might be wondering why would I
get<00:01:54.270> black<00:01:54.539> and<00:01:54.750> white<00:01:54.899> and<00:01:55.170> all<00:01:55.590> these<00:01:55.770> other

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
get black and white and all these other

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.440 
get black and white and all these other
problems<00:01:56.159> and<00:01:56.549> still<00:01:56.700> mention<00:01:56.970> this<00:01:57.060> printers

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
problems and still mention this printers

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.240 
problems and still mention this printers
great<00:01:57.720> well<00:01:57.869> first<00:01:57.899> off<00:01:58.259> I<00:01:58.409> only<00:01:58.590> print<00:01:58.860> text

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
great well first off I only print text

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.680 
great well first off I only print text
so<00:01:59.429> I<00:01:59.459> don't<00:01:59.640> really<00:01:59.789> care<00:01:59.970> about<00:02:00.090> color<00:02:00.420> on

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:00.690 
so I don't really care about color on

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:02.960 
so I don't really care about color on
the<00:02:01.590> thing<00:02:01.770> about<00:02:01.950> laser<00:02:02.130> printers<00:02:02.520> and<00:02:02.549> this

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
the thing about laser printers and this

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.330 
the thing about laser printers and this
one<00:02:03.119> included<00:02:03.569> is<00:02:03.690> I<00:02:04.110> despite<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:04.740> flaws<00:02:04.920> I

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
one included is I despite the flaws I

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.150 
one included is I despite the flaws I
mentioned<00:02:05.789> is<00:02:05.940> that<00:02:06.720> even<00:02:07.649> when<00:02:07.709> you<00:02:07.830> buy<00:02:08.100> it

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
mentioned is that even when you buy it

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.370 
mentioned is that even when you buy it
it's<00:02:08.610> expensive<00:02:08.970> but<00:02:09.299> after<00:02:09.720> that<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:10.049> toner

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
it's expensive but after that the toner

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.530 
it's expensive but after that the toner
is<00:02:10.709> cheap<00:02:11.039> it's<00:02:11.310> more<00:02:11.549> cost<00:02:11.850> effective<00:02:12.360> to

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
is cheap it's more cost effective to

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.479 
is cheap it's more cost effective to
spend<00:02:12.810> the<00:02:12.870> money<00:02:12.989> outright<00:02:13.560> than<00:02:14.069> it<00:02:14.220> is<00:02:14.340> in

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:14.489 
spend the money outright than it is in

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:17.089 
spend the money outright than it is in
the<00:02:14.549> long<00:02:14.760> run<00:02:14.970> the<00:02:15.660> toner<00:02:16.110> will<00:02:16.530> last<00:02:16.769> longer

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
the long run the toner will last longer

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:19.610 
the long run the toner will last longer
and<00:02:17.459> not<00:02:17.730> dry<00:02:18.030> up<00:02:18.060> as<00:02:18.239> quickly<00:02:18.480> as<00:02:18.780> ink<00:02:19.290> an

and not dry up as quickly as ink an

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.580 
and not dry up as quickly as ink an
inkjet<00:02:20.040> printer<00:02:20.220> it<00:02:20.819> is<00:02:21.420> larger<00:02:21.930> that<00:02:22.349> can't

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
inkjet printer it is larger that can't

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.099 
inkjet printer it is larger that can't
be<00:02:22.650> avoided<00:02:22.920> and<00:02:23.250> it<00:02:24.060> is<00:02:24.269> fairly<00:02:24.570> loud<00:02:24.840> but<00:02:25.049> if

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:25.109 
be avoided and it is fairly loud but if

00:02:25.109 --> 00:02:26.990 
be avoided and it is fairly loud but if
you<00:02:25.170> can<00:02:25.290> get<00:02:25.410> past<00:02:25.620> those<00:02:25.799> things<00:02:26.070> getting<00:02:26.940> a

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
you can get past those things getting a

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.890 
you can get past those things getting a
laser<00:02:27.150> printer<00:02:27.510> is<00:02:27.570> much<00:02:27.750> more

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
laser printer is much more

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.539 
laser printer is much more
cost-effective<00:02:28.290> in<00:02:28.680> the<00:02:28.709> long<00:02:28.799> run<00:02:29.190> than<00:02:29.430> it

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:29.549 
cost-effective in the long run than it

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:31.340 
cost-effective in the long run than it
is<00:02:29.670> in<00:02:29.820> the<00:02:29.910> initial<00:02:30.090> cost<00:02:30.780> that<00:02:30.989> you<00:02:31.079> pay<00:02:31.290> to

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
is in the initial cost that you pay to

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.110 
is in the initial cost that you pay to
buy<00:02:31.560> it<00:02:31.620> there's<00:02:32.100> a<00:02:32.160> speed<00:02:32.459> factor<00:02:32.940> that

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
buy it there's a speed factor that

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.479 
buy it there's a speed factor that
inkjet<00:02:33.750> printers<00:02:34.170> the<00:02:34.260> prints<00:02:34.560> are<00:02:34.680> very<00:02:35.190> slow

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
inkjet printers the prints are very slow

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:38.569 
inkjet printers the prints are very slow

laser once it's warmed up it's lightning

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:40.190 
laser once it's warmed up it's lightning
fast<00:02:38.609> so<00:02:39.060> this<00:02:39.180> printer<00:02:39.480> does<00:02:39.720> have<00:02:39.900> a<00:02:39.930> two

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:46.049 
now it does house will have a wireless

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:47.750 
now it does house will have a wireless

up<00:03:03.060> Wi-Fi<00:03:03.269> was<00:03:03.540> actually<00:03:03.810> really<00:03:04.019> easy<00:03:04.319> going

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
up Wi-Fi was actually really easy going

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.199 
up Wi-Fi was actually really easy going
through<00:03:04.769> the<00:03:04.829> general<00:03:05.100> controls<00:03:05.790> is<00:03:05.970> fairly

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
through the general controls is fairly

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:08.150 
through the general controls is fairly
easy<00:03:06.299> as<00:03:06.569> well<00:03:06.720> so<00:03:07.109> this<00:03:07.260> printers<00:03:07.620> advertises

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
easy as well so this printers advertises

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.580 
easy as well so this printers advertises
being<00:03:08.370> 30<00:03:08.670> ppm<00:03:09.060> which<00:03:09.239> is<00:03:09.630> 30<00:03:09.989> pages<00:03:10.440> per

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
being 30 ppm which is 30 pages per

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.129 
being 30 ppm which is 30 pages per
minute<00:03:10.950> of<00:03:11.220> text<00:03:11.730> printing<00:03:12.180> and<00:03:12.359> I<00:03:12.870> would<00:03:13.019> say

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:13.139 
minute of text printing and I would say

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:14.750 
minute of text printing and I would say
the<00:03:13.260> somewhat<00:03:13.739> accurate<00:03:14.310> because<00:03:14.430> I<00:03:14.579> was<00:03:14.700> able

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
the somewhat accurate because I was able

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.360 
the somewhat accurate because I was able
to<00:03:14.910> print<00:03:15.150> about<00:03:15.450> 35<00:03:16.049> pages<00:03:16.590> in<00:03:16.709> a<00:03:16.859> minute<00:03:17.220> and

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
to print about 35 pages in a minute and

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.580 
to print about 35 pages in a minute and
10<00:03:17.639> seconds<00:03:18.060> roughly<00:03:18.269> so<00:03:19.079> the<00:03:19.200> speed<00:03:19.560> is

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
10 seconds roughly so the speed is

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.590 
10 seconds roughly so the speed is
definitely<00:03:20.280> there<00:03:20.489> there's<00:03:20.819> also<00:03:21.000> a<00:03:21.150> low

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
definitely there there's also a low

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.120 
definitely there there's also a low
toner<00:03:22.019> mode<00:03:22.290> so<00:03:22.500> if<00:03:22.560> you're<00:03:22.680> going<00:03:22.769> to<00:03:22.829> print<00:03:23.010> a

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
toner mode so if you're going to print a

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.620 
toner mode so if you're going to print a
document<00:03:23.160> you<00:03:23.700> don't<00:03:23.760> mind<00:03:24.060> being<00:03:24.299> a<00:03:24.420> little

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
document you don't mind being a little

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.629 
document you don't mind being a little
bit<00:03:24.720> faded<00:03:24.989> but<00:03:25.350> you<00:03:25.410> want<00:03:25.530> to<00:03:25.590> save<00:03:25.769> toner<00:03:26.100> you

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:26.639 
bit faded but you want to save toner you

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:28.370 
bit faded but you want to save toner you
can<00:03:26.940> do<00:03:27.180> that<00:03:27.359> so<00:03:27.510> the<00:03:27.630> toner<00:03:27.840> will<00:03:28.019> last<00:03:28.199> that

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
can do that so the toner will last that

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.319 
can do that so the toner will last that
much<00:03:28.440> longer<00:03:28.560> not<00:03:29.489> only<00:03:29.639> that<00:03:29.760> it<00:03:29.880> does<00:03:30.090> have

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:30.329 
much longer not only that it does have

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:32.300 
much longer not only that it does have
duplex<00:03:30.810> printing<00:03:31.260> which<00:03:31.440> basically<00:03:31.829> means

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
duplex printing which basically means

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.059 
duplex printing which basically means
it<00:03:32.550> can<00:03:32.730> print<00:03:32.970> double-sided<00:03:33.600> on<00:03:33.959> my<00:03:34.080> page<00:03:34.380> so

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:35.069 
it can print double-sided on my page so

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:37.130 
it can print double-sided on my page so
you're<00:03:35.220> saving<00:03:35.640> half<00:03:36.060> the<00:03:36.300> paper<00:03:36.510> so<00:03:36.900> not<00:03:37.020> like

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
you're saving half the paper so not like

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:38.330 
you're saving half the paper so not like
this<00:03:37.260> is<00:03:37.350> a<00:03:37.380> printer<00:03:37.620> not<00:03:37.740> a<00:03:37.800> vase<00:03:37.980> scanner

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
this is a printer not a vase scanner

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:39.440 
this is a printer not a vase scanner
which<00:03:38.550> I'll<00:03:38.670> be<00:03:38.730> showing<00:03:38.850> you<00:03:38.970> the<00:03:39.090> bed<00:03:39.270> in

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
which I'll be showing you the bed in

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.059 
which I'll be showing you the bed in
which<00:03:39.540> you<00:03:39.660> put<00:03:39.840> documents<00:03:40.080> you<00:03:40.650> want<00:03:40.740> to<00:03:40.830> scan

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:41.069 
which you put documents you want to scan

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:43.880 
which you put documents you want to scan
but<00:03:41.730> also<00:03:41.850> has<00:03:42.120> a<00:03:42.150> photo<00:03:42.450> copying<00:03:42.810> function<00:03:43.230> so

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
but also has a photo copying function so

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.949 
but also has a photo copying function so
the<00:03:43.980> paper<00:03:44.160> will<00:03:44.400> feed<00:03:44.610> up<00:03:44.760> at<00:03:44.910> the<00:03:45.000> top<00:03:45.240> which

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
the paper will feed up at the top which

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:47.960 
the paper will feed up at the top which
the<00:03:46.170> flat<00:03:46.410> can<00:03:46.620> actually<00:03:46.890> be<00:03:46.980> opened<00:03:47.370> and<00:03:47.490> then

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
the flat can actually be opened and then

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.059 
the flat can actually be opened and then
it'll<00:03:48.270> just<00:03:48.300> feed<00:03:48.750> on<00:03:48.780> through<00:03:49.140> and<00:03:49.290> scan<00:03:49.590> so

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:50.069 
it'll just feed on through and scan so

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:51.830 
it'll just feed on through and scan so
you<00:03:50.160> can<00:03:50.280> actually<00:03:50.370> photocopy<00:03:50.910> or<00:03:51.180> scan<00:03:51.209> using

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
you can actually photocopy or scan using

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.870 
you can actually photocopy or scan using
this<00:03:51.959> method<00:03:52.350> at<00:03:52.470> the<00:03:52.500> top<00:03:52.739> tray<00:03:53.069> or<00:03:53.640> it<00:03:53.760> can

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
this method at the top tray or it can

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.570 
this method at the top tray or it can
use<00:03:54.060> the<00:03:54.209> actual<00:03:54.660> scanning<00:03:55.050> tray<00:03:55.560> itself<00:03:56.069> to

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:56.580 
use the actual scanning tray itself to

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.010 
use the actual scanning tray itself to
scan<00:03:56.790> documents<00:03:57.330> and<00:03:57.450> much<00:03:57.600> more<00:03:57.810> better

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:58.020 
scan documents and much more better

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:59.750 
scan documents and much more better
quality<00:03:58.560> like<00:03:59.100> pictures<00:03:59.550> for<00:03:59.730> example

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
quality like pictures for example

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.210 
quality like pictures for example
there's<00:04:00.720> not<00:04:00.930> many<00:04:01.050> buttons<00:04:01.560> on<00:04:01.739> this<00:04:01.890> device

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
there's not many buttons on this device

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.010 
there's not many buttons on this device
which<00:04:02.550> is<00:04:02.700> actually<00:04:03.120> a<00:04:03.150> good<00:04:03.540> thing<00:04:03.600> this

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:04.020 
which is actually a good thing this

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:05.479 
which is actually a good thing this
actually<00:04:04.320> makes<00:04:04.470> it<00:04:04.590> a<00:04:04.650> lot<00:04:04.890> more<00:04:05.130> easier<00:04:05.459> to

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
actually makes it a lot more easier to

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:07.160 
actually makes it a lot more easier to
use<00:04:05.790> there's<00:04:06.330> a<00:04:06.450> lot<00:04:06.600> of<00:04:06.690> printers<00:04:06.930> nowadays

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
use there's a lot of printers nowadays

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:54.860 
printer you could probably look for
third-party<00:04:53.280> toner<00:04:53.880> cartridges<00:04:54.450> and<00:04:54.690> just

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 
third-party toner cartridges and just

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:57.200 
third-party toner cartridges and just
put<00:04:55.229> it<00:04:55.350> in<00:04:55.470> but<00:04:56.010> if<00:04:56.100> you<00:04:56.130> want<00:04:56.340> brother<00:04:56.729> toner

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210 
put it in but if you want brother toner

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:58.940 
put it in but if you want brother toner
you<00:04:57.450> have<00:04:57.570> two<00:04:57.750> options<00:04:58.140> available<00:04:58.229> which<00:04:58.830> is

00:04:58.940 --> 00:04:58.950 
you have two options available which is

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:01.190 
you have two options available which is
great<00:04:59.220> the<00:04:59.850> first<00:05:00.120> one<00:05:00.300> is<00:05:00.450> that<00:05:00.570> cheaper<00:05:01.050> one

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:01.200 
great the first one is that cheaper one

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:04.100 
great the first one is that cheaper one
is<00:05:01.410> the<00:05:02.039> TN<00:05:02.400> 630<00:05:02.970> which<00:05:03.150> allows<00:05:03.390> for<00:05:03.419> roughly

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
is the TN 630 which allows for roughly

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:06.440 
is the TN 630 which allows for roughly
1,200<00:05:04.650> pages<00:05:04.830> of<00:05:05.130> printing<00:05:05.610> now<00:05:06.090> I<00:05:06.120> can't

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:06.450 
1,200 pages of printing now I can't

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:07.850 
1,200 pages of printing now I can't
verify<00:05:06.720> these<00:05:06.930> numbers<00:05:07.320> because<00:05:07.650> I<00:05:07.680> haven't

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:07.860 
verify these numbers because I haven't

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:09.950 
verify these numbers because I haven't
printed<00:05:08.340> that<00:05:08.430> many<00:05:08.610> pages<00:05:08.880> yet<00:05:09.180> but<00:05:09.450> these

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:09.960 
printed that many pages yet but these

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:11.659 
printed that many pages yet but these
are<00:05:10.080> the<00:05:10.140> numbers<00:05:10.380> given<00:05:10.680> my<00:05:10.770> brother<00:05:11.039> and<00:05:11.280> the

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:11.669 
are the numbers given my brother and the

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:13.610 
are the numbers given my brother and the
bigger<00:05:11.970> and<00:05:12.330> more<00:05:12.479> expensive<00:05:12.810> toner<00:05:13.229> from

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:13.620 
bigger and more expensive toner from

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.310 
bigger and more expensive toner from
brother<00:05:13.860> is<00:05:14.070> it<00:05:14.250> TN<00:05:14.520> 660<00:05:15.150> which<00:05:15.479> prints

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.320 
brother is it TN 660 which prints

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.560 
brother is it TN 660 which prints
approximately<00:05:16.860> 2,600<00:05:17.460> pages<00:05:17.610> which<00:05:18.210> again

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:18.570 
approximately 2,600 pages which again

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:19.909 
approximately 2,600 pages which again
these<00:05:18.750> are<00:05:18.900> numbers<00:05:19.260> given<00:05:19.440> from<00:05:19.680> brother

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:19.919 
these are numbers given from brother

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:21.650 
these are numbers given from brother
I'll<00:05:20.250> probably<00:05:20.820> never<00:05:21.060> reach<00:05:21.300> that<00:05:21.360> number

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:21.660 
I'll probably never reach that number

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:22.969 
I'll probably never reach that number
for<00:05:22.050> years<00:05:22.380> to<00:05:22.560> come

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:22.979 
for years to come

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:24.140 
for years to come
so<00:05:23.190> I<00:05:23.220> know<00:05:23.340> I<00:05:23.430> mentioned<00:05:23.760> this<00:05:23.850> is<00:05:23.970> not<00:05:24.000> a

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.150 
so I know I mentioned this is not a

review video it's an overview so I was

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:26.930 
review video it's an overview so I was
going<00:05:25.710> to<00:05:25.800> give<00:05:25.919> my<00:05:26.010> personal<00:05:26.250> opinion<00:05:26.729> and<00:05:26.850> I

am very happy and pleased I bought this

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:30.800 
am very happy and pleased I bought this
printer<00:05:28.919> it<00:05:28.979> works<00:05:29.160> great<00:05:29.490> and<00:05:29.789> of<00:05:30.270> course<00:05:30.479> yes

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:30.810 
printer it works great and of course yes

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:32.450 
printer it works great and of course yes
it<00:05:30.990> is<00:05:31.080> monochrome<00:05:31.620> it's<00:05:31.800> black<00:05:32.010> and<00:05:32.220> white<00:05:32.310> it

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:32.460 
it is monochrome it's black and white it

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:34.340 
it is monochrome it's black and white it
does<00:05:32.580> not<00:05:32.729> print<00:05:32.970> color<00:05:33.210> but<00:05:33.479> to<00:05:33.600> me<00:05:33.780> it's<00:05:34.260> not

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:34.350 
does not print color but to me it's not

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:36.140 
does not print color but to me it's not
a<00:05:34.410> big<00:05:34.560> deal<00:05:34.800> I<00:05:34.830> almost<00:05:35.310> never<00:05:35.610> print<00:05:35.940> color

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:36.150 
a big deal I almost never print color

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:37.610 
a big deal I almost never print color
the<00:05:36.539> main<00:05:36.720> thing<00:05:36.900> to<00:05:36.930> keep<00:05:37.050> in<00:05:37.169> mind<00:05:37.229> is<00:05:37.440> I<00:05:37.500> was

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:37.620 
the main thing to keep in mind is I was

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:38.990 
the main thing to keep in mind is I was
able<00:05:37.710> to<00:05:37.830> get<00:05:37.950> it<00:05:38.039> for<00:05:38.100> $100<00:05:38.669> which<00:05:38.820> is<00:05:38.970> a

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:39.000 
able to get it for $100 which is a

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.279 
able to get it for $100 which is a
wicked<00:05:39.390> deal<00:05:39.570> you<00:05:39.720> might<00:05:39.840> not<00:05:40.020> get<00:05:40.140> the<00:05:40.260> same

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:40.289 
wicked deal you might not get the same

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:41.960 
wicked deal you might not get the same
thing<00:05:40.680> but<00:05:40.830> try<00:05:41.010> to<00:05:41.070> look<00:05:41.190> for<00:05:41.400> on<00:05:41.460> sale<00:05:41.789> it

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:41.970 
thing but try to look for on sale it

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:44.270 
thing but try to look for on sale it
tends<00:05:42.210> to<00:05:42.390> fluctuate<00:05:42.630> in<00:05:42.960> price<00:05:43.190> but<00:05:44.190> the

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:44.280 
tends to fluctuate in price but the

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:45.530 
tends to fluctuate in price but the
other<00:05:44.430> thing<00:05:44.669> is<00:05:44.789> that<00:05:44.820> yes<00:05:45.240> it<00:05:45.419> is

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:45.540 
other thing is that yes it is

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:47.120 
other thing is that yes it is
expensive<00:05:46.020> compared<00:05:46.290> to<00:05:46.380> inkjet<00:05:46.770> but<00:05:46.950> in<00:05:47.040> the

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:47.130 
expensive compared to inkjet but in the

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:51.690 
never a laser printer like this is more

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:55.040 
never a laser printer like this is more

if<00:05:55.260> you<00:05:55.380> don't<00:05:55.560> use<00:05:55.710> the<00:05:55.830> ink<00:05:55.980> for<00:05:56.250> a<00:05:56.280> while<00:05:56.430> it

is<00:06:02.010> bigger<00:06:02.490> but<00:06:03.000> it<00:06:03.300> saves<00:06:03.960> money<00:06:04.200> in<00:06:04.440> the<00:06:04.470> long

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:20.270 
you might not have the same luck if
you're<00:06:18.600> not<00:06:18.720> that<00:06:18.810> tech-savvy<00:06:19.200> but<00:06:19.560> you<00:06:20.130> get

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:20.280 
you're not that tech-savvy but you get

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:22.190 
you're not that tech-savvy but you get
the<00:06:20.370> idea<00:06:20.400> that's<00:06:20.940> fairly<00:06:21.180> easy<00:06:21.300> to<00:06:21.540> use<00:06:21.810> and

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:22.200 
the idea that's fairly easy to use and

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:23.570 
the idea that's fairly easy to use and
not<00:06:22.290> only<00:06:22.380> that<00:06:22.500> the<00:06:22.770> wireless<00:06:23.250> printing

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:23.580 
not only that the wireless printing

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:25.370 
not only that the wireless printing
works<00:06:23.790> fantastic<00:06:24.420> when<00:06:24.840> powering<00:06:25.170> it<00:06:25.290> up

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:25.380 
works fantastic when powering it up

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:27.200 
works fantastic when powering it up
after<00:06:25.770> a<00:06:25.800> while<00:06:25.950> it<00:06:26.160> does<00:06:26.370> take<00:06:26.610> about<00:06:26.730> 15

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:27.210 
after a while it does take about 15

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:28.760 
after a while it does take about 15
seconds<00:06:27.570> to<00:06:27.690> warm<00:06:27.840> up<00:06:28.020> which<00:06:28.200> isn't<00:06:28.350> that<00:06:28.560> long

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:28.770 
seconds to warm up which isn't that long

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:31.160 
seconds to warm up which isn't that long
and<00:06:29.010> then<00:06:29.670> it<00:06:29.760> to<00:06:30.000> print<00:06:30.240> the<00:06:30.330> first<00:06:30.540> page<00:06:30.870> will

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:31.170 
and then it to print the first page will

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:32.900 
and then it to print the first page will
take<00:06:31.320> a<00:06:31.380> few<00:06:31.620> seconds<00:06:32.010> of<00:06:32.160> warming<00:06:32.490> up<00:06:32.580> not

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:32.910 
take a few seconds of warming up not

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:34.520 
take a few seconds of warming up not
very<00:06:33.090> long<00:06:33.270> and<00:06:33.750> then<00:06:33.870> after<00:06:34.200> that<00:06:34.290> if<00:06:34.410> you're

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:34.530 
very long and then after that if you're
