00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.580
 Well, I want to show you what the 

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:10.510
 steps to restore or power 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:13.840
 protect in structures and finishes or 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:15.910
 decorated in wood this house is 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.670
 a very old house and has paint that 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:21.690
 possibly 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.850
 I had to have to have a lot 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:25.560
 Beware of that as if you think 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.890
 remove paint in this case only 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.240
 rowing number that was loose then 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.460
 Use masks to cover the area well 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.050
 where you are working so that 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.750
 will not contaminate the area with the 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.030
 Lead a lot of play with children these 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.390
 you have to follow some recommendations that 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:45.290
 someone in the paintings and the in this 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.480
 case the efe 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.530
 the agency that was in charge of 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.570
 demonstrate what the risks of that are 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.450
 so that's why I have a lot 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.860
 careful they are removing the paint very 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.830
 all right 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.370
 obviously get rid of the vacancy of that 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:03.980
 in the most appropriate way now 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:06.140
 we have in this case four columns that 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.330
 some other areas from the front of 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.610
 the house that we are going to work now but 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.470
 in this case it presents some 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.350
 situations present some cracks already 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.729
 the wood is naturally gone 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:20.630
 working then for this we are going to 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:22.880
 use a putty that is made 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:26.149
 for exteriors and subsequently we are going to 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:30.210
 apply an an implant a layer base 

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:32.220
 a layer of d 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.330
 in oil to help us protect 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.590
 this and make a grip 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.710
 corresponding now before I 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.049
 I would have done all this 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:45.799
 we are going all areas the 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:49.340
 let's go all this with a little soap 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:51.110
 and chlorine to be able to remove the entire amount 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.940
 that are there that we do not want 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.170
 then the procedure that we are going to 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.759
 do is we are to fill all the 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.640
 bullet points where there are corners 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:00.840
 around what is subsequently 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:07.619
 we apply the base layer 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:10.619
 oil in this case I have the oil 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:13.319
 and we're also going to apply a layer of 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:16.560
 white in this case is white high 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:18.900
 shine in oil this will help a lot to 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.280
 prevent many from proliferating 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.390
 microbes and all these things that 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.390
 so let's start 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:30.030
 well then how 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.660
 as I was saying we started applying the 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.570
 silicone 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:38.200
 he flies more and it's already like a 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:39.850
 silicon putty hoisted then already 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.130
 we are filling all the holes and 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:45.790
 the areas were discovered where 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:47.920
 was the wood the wood discovered or 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.710
 without painting then when the 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.630
 things and let's dry this 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:55.390
 implant this house that this base layer and 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.860
 later we will apply the other 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.350
 and only a little more 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:02.160
 just here at the bottom and 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.160
 so we're still 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:10.000
 well this is the last part since 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:12.340
 of the project we paint the columns you see 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.720
 very very well we already know obviously how 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.780
 these paintings will be dispensed by a 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.100
 little to take out then be 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.930
 pending of the temperature been the 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.680
 so they will not have a lot of rain 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:24.040
 what we are that this is obviously 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.140
 referring to water 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.810
 but that they do not remain is to take a little 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.250
 of mess there then well it works 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.780
 be very careful again with the material 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.300
 that you pick up a trace of all that 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:37.630
 protect their their respiratory cavities 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:39.340
 when they are working and leave the 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.630
 children inside the house or left the 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.489
 this nation's project there are many 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:44.050
 thanks for watching the video I hope 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:47.400
 that serves them for their projects and we 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:47.400
 we see in the future thank you
