00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
conflicting feelings because since I

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.679 
conflicting feelings because since I
realized<00:00:25.590> later<00:00:25.800> in<00:00:26.039> life<00:00:26.189> that<00:00:26.250> I'm<00:00:26.609> trans<00:00:27.000> if

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.089 
realized later in life that I'm trans if
I've<00:00:27.960> been<00:00:28.109> given<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.380> opportunity<00:00:28.980> I<00:00:29.010> would

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
I've been given the opportunity I would

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.950 
I've been given the opportunity I would
have<00:00:29.310> liked<00:00:29.490> to<00:00:29.609> prevent<00:00:30.060> myself<00:00:30.269> from<00:00:30.570> going

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
have liked to prevent myself from going

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.720 
have liked to prevent myself from going
through<00:00:30.990> puberty<00:00:31.410> so<00:00:31.980> that<00:00:32.279> I<00:00:32.550> could

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
through puberty so that I could

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.790 
through puberty so that I could
transition<00:00:33.270> later<00:00:33.480> in<00:00:33.690> life<00:00:33.870> but

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
transition later in life but

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.709 
transition later in life but
uncomfortable<00:00:35.460> with<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.030> body<00:00:36.210> that<00:00:36.420> I<00:00:36.510> have

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
uncomfortable with the body that I have

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.260 
uncomfortable with the body that I have
despite<00:00:37.230> that<00:00:37.469> but<00:00:37.980> since<00:00:38.309> I<00:00:38.399> very<00:00:38.610> obviously

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
despite that but since I very obviously

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.619 
despite that but since I very obviously
don't<00:00:39.450> pass<00:00:40.140> in<00:00:40.559> public<00:00:41.100> I<00:00:41.309> have<00:00:41.969> to<00:00:42.180> wear<00:00:42.390> two

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
don't pass in public I have to wear two

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.080 
don't pass in public I have to wear two
different<00:00:42.899> identities<00:00:43.649> between<00:00:44.280> public<00:00:44.969> and

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
different identities between public and

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.670 
different identities between public and
private<00:00:45.180> but<00:00:46.170> because<00:00:46.410> I've<00:00:46.559> never

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
private but because I've never

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.440 
private but because I've never
identified<00:00:47.280> strongly<00:00:47.670> with<00:00:48.000> a<00:00:48.030> gender

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
identified strongly with a gender

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:49.819 
identified strongly with a gender
because<00:00:48.840> I<00:00:48.870> didn't<00:00:49.200> realize<00:00:49.379> there<00:00:49.680> was<00:00:49.770> a

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
because I didn't realize there was a

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.220 
because I didn't realize there was a
difference<00:00:50.219> between<00:00:50.280> gender<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:51.210> sex<00:00:51.690> and<00:00:52.140> I

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
difference between gender and sex and I

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.590 
difference between gender and sex and I
always<00:00:52.500> thought<00:00:52.770> I<00:00:53.070> was<00:00:53.219> just<00:00:53.579> a<00:00:53.730> man<00:00:54.000> so<00:00:54.570> I

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
always thought I was just a man so I

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.240 
always thought I was just a man so I
didn't<00:00:54.930> identify<00:00:55.079> strong<00:00:55.680> with<00:00:55.890> that<00:00:56.070> because

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
didn't identify strong with that because

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.279 
didn't identify strong with that because
I<00:00:56.699> actually<00:00:57.000> am<00:00:57.300> a<00:00:57.420> woman<00:00:57.600> wanting<00:00:58.109> now<00:00:58.230> to

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
I actually am a woman wanting now to

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.709 
I actually am a woman wanting now to
identify<00:00:59.250> more<00:00:59.520> strongly<00:00:59.879> and<00:01:00.120> be<00:01:00.510> more<00:01:00.660> open

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
identify more strongly and be more open

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:01.939 
identify more strongly and be more open
about<00:01:01.140> Who<00:01:01.530> I<00:01:01.559> am

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
about Who I am

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.310 
about Who I am
especially<00:01:02.579> because<00:01:02.699> gipsy<00:01:03.660> has<00:01:03.840> opened<00:01:04.199> me

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
especially because gipsy has opened me

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.440 
especially because gipsy has opened me
emotionally<00:01:04.890> it<00:01:05.010> made<00:01:05.159> me<00:01:05.309> feel<00:01:05.549> so<00:01:05.790> accepted

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
emotionally it made me feel so accepted

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.620 
emotionally it made me feel so accepted
and<00:01:06.689> I'm<00:01:07.170> more<00:01:07.590> accepting<00:01:08.100> of<00:01:08.280> myself<00:01:08.820> I<00:01:09.119> don't

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
and I'm more accepting of myself I don't

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.170 
and I'm more accepting of myself I don't
have<00:01:10.320> an<00:01:10.530> opportunity<00:01:11.310> to<00:01:11.490> actually<00:01:11.850> put<00:01:12.150> that

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
have an opportunity to actually put that

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.050 
have an opportunity to actually put that
into<00:01:12.600> practice<00:01:13.020> because<00:01:13.950> I<00:01:14.250> have<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:14.820> fall

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
into practice because I have to fall

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.359 
into practice because I have to fall
back<00:01:15.299> on<00:01:15.479> my<00:01:15.509> old<00:01:15.780> emotional<00:01:16.409> safeguards<00:01:17.189> that

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
back on my old emotional safeguards that

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.570 
back on my old emotional safeguards that
I<00:01:17.400> learned<00:01:17.729> in<00:01:17.939> middle<00:01:18.180> school<00:01:18.479> of<00:01:18.750> just

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580 
I learned in middle school of just

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.960 
I learned in middle school of just
ignoring<00:01:20.580> it<00:01:20.820> because<00:01:21.170> I<00:01:22.170> I'm<00:01:22.830> too<00:01:23.580> sensitive

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
ignoring it because I I'm too sensitive

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.630 
ignoring it because I I'm too sensitive
to<00:01:24.960> be<00:01:25.049> able<00:01:25.170> to<00:01:25.290> handle<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.890> fact<00:01:26.159> that<00:01:26.310> I<00:01:26.400> am

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
to be able to handle the fact that I am

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.929 
to be able to handle the fact that I am
constantly<00:01:27.680> misgendered<00:01:28.680> it<00:01:29.130> would<00:01:29.280> depress

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
constantly misgendered it would depress

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.850

but now that I actually appreciate the

gravity of this kind of issue and how it

pervades and causes the systemic issue I

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:36.530 
pervades and causes the systemic issue I
think<00:03:34.769> that<00:03:34.980> what<00:03:35.340> matters<00:03:35.700> is<00:03:35.940> the<00:03:36.150> approach

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
think that what matters is the approach

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.860 
think that what matters is the approach
and<00:03:36.900> you<00:03:37.890> could<00:03:38.130> have<00:03:38.220> very<00:03:38.459> simply<00:03:39.120> solved

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
and you could have very simply solved

and you could have very simply solved
the<00:03:39.989> issue<00:03:40.200> if<00:03:40.590> you<00:03:41.070> had<00:03:41.250> pulled<00:03:41.760> the

the issue if you had pulled the

the issue if you had pulled the

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
professor aside and told him how to be

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
respectful because assuming that that's

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
what he wants then when he realizes he's

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.449 
what he wants then when he realizes he's
being<00:03:49.440> disrespectful

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
being disrespectful

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:52.880 
being disrespectful
he'll<00:03:51.140> presumably<00:03:52.140> correct<00:03:52.560> his<00:03:52.739> behavior

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
he'll presumably correct his behavior

he'll presumably correct his behavior
