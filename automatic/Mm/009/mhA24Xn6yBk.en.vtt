00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.989
 ha 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:32.689
 Let's introduce the vt 1300 cx released this year from Honda 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:37.510
 Well first of all please see 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:40.430
 Also the characteristic of is anything but it is this styling looks 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:45.140
 It is good to feel this way and look Papa' 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:47.790
 It is very clean around before I thing Mecha play Nante 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:52.080
 Furthermore, the position of the head pipe is 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:56.190
 It is so far from high riders 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:59.280
 It's still wide &amp; low 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.840
 Say the position is high in the head pipe in front 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.909
 So-called chopper-like 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:10.109
 It is such a look that exudes an atmosphere 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.230
 What 's more that also supports plated parts 

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:17.870
 Sea bream 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:22.940
 You can even receive the feeling that you are tuning and customizing it 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:23.870
 Then we have adopted the pupils of hc that the v twin but I'm engine 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.210
 But 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:29.290
 that 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:31.060
 I guess you 're riding twins 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:34.510
 Do you feel a feeling 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:37.970
 Or that particular of that low-rotation type 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:44.650
 There is a great deal of feeling of heartbeat 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:51.280
 I think I do not say I feel the vibration to say whether Well its deep 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:54.890
 Well the vibration is so small that the cause is not only the one on the other side but also that one chassis side 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:02:00.380
 I think I'm rich in ideas have been incorporated this bike 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:06.500
 First of all, though it is a seal arm integrated with that shaft drive 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:10.580
 When the Fuchu of Tteyuu Shingamu has to bear in Picot shut your time to the main frame 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:13.970
 That Tteyuu by click of such layout but I'm almost say 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.880
 Real to say I bike of that child in kindergarten 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.210
 Well subframe 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:21.200
 There by adding a 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:22.790
 I think I'm asking bother swinger 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:27.590
 Furthermore 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:34.099
 Even though it has a part of the final gear because it is a walk drive 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:38.100
 Sudo Main's shaft is more absolute by making its final gear part 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:41.340
 Vibration is subject to instead One to border the 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.069
 Well there is also devised say so is its smooth 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:48.340
 a 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:51.710
 Remove the deep, but heart even while leaving the What you doing Shi child assimilation 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:55.950
 a What is it to the rider 

00:02:51.710 --> 00:03:01.610
 It supplies only good riding taste and says that it supplies ep 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:06.410
 It is also a house when it has the vehicle body circumference that he is very ingenious 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:09.260
 This has the characteristic appearance of the high neck style 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:14.350
 vtk tape cx 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:18.960
 Oh yes, it's not enough with ordinary American 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:21.830
