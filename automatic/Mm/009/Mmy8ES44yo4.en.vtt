00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:03.600 
I'm going to show you how to paint the

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.619 
I'm going to show you how to paint the
Wicklow<00:00:04.020> butterfly<00:00:04.589> silt<00:00:04.950> suncatcher<00:00:05.629> first

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
Wicklow butterfly silt suncatcher first

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:08.750 
Wicklow butterfly silt suncatcher first
of<00:00:06.779> all<00:00:06.870> I<00:00:06.930> hope<00:00:07.109> I<00:00:07.259> pattern<00:00:07.649> and<00:00:08.400> I've<00:00:08.490> stuck

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
of all I hope I pattern and I've stuck

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.450 
of all I hope I pattern and I've stuck
it<00:00:08.910> onto<00:00:09.090> some<00:00:09.389> corrugated<00:00:09.719> cardboard

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:10.460 
it onto some corrugated cardboard

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:12.910 
it onto some corrugated cardboard
because<00:00:11.460> this<00:00:11.639> makes<00:00:11.849> a<00:00:12.000> nice<00:00:12.120> base<00:00:12.509> for

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:12.920 
because this makes a nice base for

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.589 
because this makes a nice base for
putting<00:00:13.920> the<00:00:14.009> Sun<00:00:14.219> catcher<00:00:14.460> over<00:00:15.000> so<00:00:15.450> that's

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
putting the Sun catcher over so that's

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.470 
putting the Sun catcher over so that's
nice<00:00:15.780> and<00:00:16.020> flat<00:00:16.080> and<00:00:16.470> smooth<00:00:16.910> now<00:00:17.910> all<00:00:18.119> I<00:00:18.150> have

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
nice and flat and smooth now all I have

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.840 
nice and flat and smooth now all I have
to<00:00:18.510> do<00:00:19.189> is<00:00:20.750> trace<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:22.050> pattern<00:00:22.310> onto<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:23.490> silk

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
to do is trace the pattern onto the silk

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.259 
to do is trace the pattern onto the silk
and<00:00:24.260> I'm<00:00:25.260> doing<00:00:25.439> this<00:00:25.740> quite<00:00:26.460> heavily<00:00:26.939> with

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
and I'm doing this quite heavily with

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.220 
and I'm doing this quite heavily with
the<00:00:27.390> pencil<00:00:29.090> what<00:00:30.090> I'm<00:00:30.210> tracing<00:00:30.539> is<00:00:31.019> the

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
the pencil what I'm tracing is the

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.270 
the pencil what I'm tracing is the
pattern<00:00:31.439> within<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:31.949> wings<00:00:32.130> and<00:00:33.770> I'm<00:00:34.770> not

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
pattern within the wings and I'm not

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.709

going<00:00:35.520> to<00:00:35.610> go<00:00:35.730> over<00:00:35.760> these<00:00:36.120> without<00:00:36.420> liner

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
going to go over these without liner

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.360 
going to go over these without liner
until<00:00:37.170> I've<00:00:37.290> actually<00:00:37.440> finished<00:00:37.890> painting

quite new to silk painting it doesn't
take<00:00:59.160> long<00:00:59.420> you<00:01:00.420> don't<00:01:00.660> need<00:01:00.809> much<00:01:00.989> equipment

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:01.520
