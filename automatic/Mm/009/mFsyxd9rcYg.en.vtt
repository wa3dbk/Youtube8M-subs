00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 of all the ingredients that we are going to 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:09.330
 use to make this rich rice 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:16.170
 with break I have here and two cups of 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:20.010
 square east rice and drained we are going to 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:24.090
 occupy also three cups of water one 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:29.359
 can of condensed milk a can of 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:34.260
 evaporated milk a cup of normal milk 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:37.760
 from that of how we are also going to 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.760
 occupy some cup of sugar 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:44.790
 a cinnamon arm 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.620
 and the main ingredient that is the 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:49.470
 Break the first thing we're going to do 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.290
 then it is to flip the three boxes of 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:54.440
 Water 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:57.500
 let's put to heat along with the 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.300
 cinnamon slit and let's wait for it 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.790
 let boil is already boiling the 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.950
 water already dropped the cinnamon its color and 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.770
 start to smell amela then it's the 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:10.250
 time to empty our rice 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:13.549
 so that it starts to cook and then in 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:18.429
 way let's let it be covered for 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:21.110
 that is cooked at this point already 

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:24.530
 it consumed most of the water almost 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.710
 it is cooked the rice moment of 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.710
 add 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:41.909
 sugar the sugar cup we are going to remove 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:41.909
 so that it integrates very well 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:01.780
 today we are going to let it continue to cook 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.780
 a little more 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:10.020
 well, this rice has already been cooked 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:12.360
 as they say go 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:15.800
 to this request 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.800
 it does not feel hard anymore 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:23.330
 and how I'm going to support was almost reduced in 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:25.750
 whole three cups of water that you 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.750
 we put 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:30.670
 Now what we are going to do is lower a 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:33.420
 little slats let's leave it to 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.420
 low fire 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.690
 and we are going to add the milk cup 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:51.620
 let's see now the evaporated milk 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:02.800
 remember to wash the cans very well before 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.490
 to use them 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.490
 all right 

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:22.080
 and now we are going to add 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.080
 condensed milk 

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:33.689
 moving 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:42.170
 these 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:45.620
 palettes that are called miserable uy 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:49.220
 useful in the kitchen because they help them 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:53.950
 withdraw everything and so we no longer waste 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:53.950
 product mojo denver 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:04:00.010
 more or less how are we going to leave 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:04.090
 cook for about 20 more minutes there 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:06.010
 that be moving constantly to 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:08.550
 that is not going to hit us and leave us 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.550
 What image 

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:18.370
 so at low heat then we leave it 20 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:18.370
 moving minutes from time to time 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:24.480
 Well, the 20 minutes have passed 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:28.110
 that has been cooking 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:32.340
 and that was moving him then now 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:34.740
 I'm going to pay for it and I'm going to withdraw it 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:37.370
 from the burner that is hot I'm going 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.370
 to spend here 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:45.630
 I'm going to put here in the girl explore that 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:49.660
 it is not hot 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:52.910
 and I'm going to let it cool a bit with 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:56.750
 him to then add 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:05:02.570
 Well, I cooled my rice a little bit 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:06.260
 it's cold I only stopped it from 10 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:08.740
 minutes from here turn off the fire like this 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:12.820
 because it should not be totally cold 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.820
 and now what I'm going to do 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:21.060
 is to empty my cup of breaks 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:24.280
 and I'm going to mix 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:33.699
 and well here is already optional as you see 

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:37.960
 He cited a yellow color but not 

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:40.319
 a lot then we can not add a 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.319
 droplet 

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:48.080
 of artificial coloring what I give them 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:50.390
 I recommend using this one that I know 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:52.580
 in gel 

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:56.569
 yes 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:06:01.249
 As you see, it starts to take another color 

00:05:56.569 --> 00:06:04.199
 more appetizing and what I like about these 

00:06:01.249 --> 00:06:07.969
 of these gel dyes is that they do not 

00:06:04.199 --> 00:06:14.479
 modify the taste of food 

00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:14.479
 because especially those of dust do 

00:06:15.729 --> 00:06:20.979
 that looks more yellowish are more for 

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:23.759
 here with the light you can not appreciate 

00:06:20.979 --> 00:06:23.759
 much 

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:30.760
 but I take the same yellow tone of 

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:35.280
 I break p 

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:40.639
 the color was well integrated 

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:40.639
 and red're going to leave will happen 

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:47.070
 what 

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:49.310
 grip greater consistency and we can 

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:49.310
 enjoy 

00:06:50.490 --> 00:07:00.160
 and until here is the rice with coconut 

00:06:56.490 --> 00:07:02.409
 It smells delicious 

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:05.849
 let's add 

00:07:02.409 --> 00:07:05.849
 a little cinnamon 

00:07:20.379 --> 00:07:23.379
 you need 

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:31.240
 it is very nice very nice 

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:35.790
 It is very creamy 

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:40.810
 let's see how 

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:47.470
 delicious 

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:53.870
 I hope you encourage yourself to do it and what 

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:56.810
 enjoy as much as I am 

00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:59.750
 enjoying in these moments see you 

00:07:56.810 --> 00:08:02.440
