00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.010
 the htc one x was very close to the 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.269
 5 stars but eventually one arrived 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.160
 half star shortage 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.139
 and now here is the htc one x plus one 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.300
 updated version of the device that on 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.380
 many fronts still have something better than that 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.730
 the original 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.730
 then we go for the first time in the 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:26.130
 history Enter the Perfect Score 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.469
 well how much better or different is the htc 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.000
 one x plus then well from a distance 

00:00:28.469 --> 00:00:31.770
 he can hardly be distinguished from 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.329
 the original but sir to him 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.739
 then you notice that it is something 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.820
 otherwise finished 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.680
 has to do that there is new kind 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.870
 rubbery structure on the back 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.700
 He is also a bit black a bit deep 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.020
 blacker and has some nice red accent 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.240
 on the back and actually i like it 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.590
 only improved him 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.020
 Well that also tastes a bit nicer 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.460
 but he seems a bit sensitive 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.200
 the backside 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.810
 the screen has remained unchanged 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:57.420
 is still a super lcd2 screen 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:58.380
 4.7 inches well that is bad 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.180
 absolutely not because it is real 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:02.070
 crystal clear and the viewing angle is also 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.049
 incredibly large and also the way 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.280
 the screen a bit on top of the 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.049
 housing seems to be 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.460
 nevertheless see a very good one from the 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.259
 differences are mainly within 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.359
 in the clock speed of the quad core 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:14.130
 processor has gone up from 1.5 to 

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:15.450
 1.7 giga 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.679
 this is just a terrible disaster 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.450
 beast and you notice that too 

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:20.039
 nothing compared to the original bean 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.389
 the differences are not very big though 

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:23.340
 opening apps or downloading 

00:01:21.389 --> 00:01:26.429
 of apps yes that just goes just a moment 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:29.219
 also browsing and faster on this model 

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:30.840
 it leafs through the minutes it 

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:32.130
 starting applications switching 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.109
 just go between applications 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.240
 very smooth and 

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:38.310
 This HTC One X Plus is equipped with 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.020
 Android 4 immediately where the original where 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.859
 nothing was equipped with android free 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.029
 well 

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:43.590
 well to be honest you notice there 

00:01:42.029 --> 00:01:44.850
 really not much of htc 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.770
 of course just has its own 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.599
 peel over htc sense 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.509
 but that is an updated version it 

00:01:48.599 --> 00:01:52.799
 namely htc sense 4 plus 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.509
 and that brings some new ones 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.639
 functionalities, so is the 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.979
 front camera improved and not because of that 

00:01:56.639 --> 00:02:01.049
 from their income 3 to a 1.6 megapixel 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.749
 room has gone but also because the camera 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.669
 better recognized in intuitive faces 

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:07.109
 so is the appearance of skin and eyes 

00:02:05.669 --> 00:02:09.539
 a lot better on a photo 

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:11.880
 this front camera actually understands 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.020
 a neat even better 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.909
 look if you with the original where nothing 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.209
 makes him look like this 

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:19.410
 with a man x plus he is good 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:20.970
 In addition, photos in the gallery can now 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.310
 in two different ways 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.260
 displayed by category or album to you 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.260
 also per event and thereby 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.250
 photos sorted by date and location 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.020
 so you are looking for a certain one 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.000
 photo provided with a specific event 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:34.980
 then this should make it easier 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.630
 to find that photo on 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.270
 some space for all your photos videos 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:42.150
 and music there is enough the htc 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:44.040
 one x plus is equipped with 64 as standard 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.510
 gigabyte of internal memory 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.610
 you can't expand that yourself, but it 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.130
 seems a bit unnecessary but 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.230
 register your device for 2013 the 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.100
 also gets another 25 gigabytes 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.230
 dropbox space 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.750
 on top then it is that some whole 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.190
 cool cyclist on this one x plus and that 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.620
 is that it is not the first 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.600
 sony smartphone is that playstation 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.370
 certified is what does it mean 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.830
 you can go via place as your model later 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.540
 all games for your phone 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.830
 download and play 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.420
 high-quality games 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.340
 for example, also classics that are ever on 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.620
 the playstation 1 appeared I say 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.600
 soon because playstation mobile is still 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.280
 not rolled out in the Netherlands though 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.109
 other places in Europe so that's it 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.220
 coming that seems a given but 

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:25.829
 when it appears here 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:28.079
 the htc keeps waiting a bit 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:29.970
 one x plus is therefore more beautiful faster 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:32.310
 finished has much more internal 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.620
 memory newer software a better one 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.670
 front camera and is therefore a playstation 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.049
 certified 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.519
 on the other hand he is a bit 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:40.980
 more expensive than the original one x 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:42.840
 he is about 150 euros above that 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.430
 this device still remains a piece 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.190
 cheaper than for example the iphone 5 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.600
 and I have a little nagging feeling about that 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.799
 this just not and completely new 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.840
 smartphone and that is also true 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:54.329
 a little in it is actually an update 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.980
 from an already fantastic device count already 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:58.290
 these things together then goes on 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:00.450
 this device the perfect score is him 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:03.350
 also gets through half a star and 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:03.350
 the predicate purchase tip
