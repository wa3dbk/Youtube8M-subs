00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
and it is at room temperature so it

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:26.400 
and it is at room temperature so it
melts<00:03:18.040> quickly

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:31.540 

and<00:03:27.520> you<00:03:28.520> want<00:03:28.730> your<00:03:28.970> your<00:03:29.360> heat<00:03:29.630> add<00:03:30.370> least<00:03:31.370> a

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.140 
medium-high just so the cheeses melt
this<00:03:36.680> takes<00:03:36.980> about<00:03:37.550> a<00:03:37.610> couple<00:03:37.700> of<00:03:38.030> minutes
