00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.710
 and the removal of such old 5 

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:10.590
 let's take this grid now 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:14.460
 I tried and show you very much 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:17.490
 well showed a dream at least 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:20.310
 cleans well together here this 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.279
 oven cleaner 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:26.970
 it may even be separate but I them 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:33.439
 mixed up and they buy together that noise 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:33.439
 No, they are pretty good but 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.770
 after all 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:16.030
 way until cleared grill cleared at 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.710
 me here is this thing 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.800
 weeks at the beginning of the video what it was 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.240
 happiness 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:26.479
 practically did not touch her yes well 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:30.530
 acts well cleans by the way 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:33.680
 any such things are not repetition 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:41.000
 sticks lattice because i'm even called 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:47.119
 I do n't know very well the honor of the lattice 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:52.190
 these barbecue needles can be cleaned 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:57.950
 also very difficult to clean some 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:02:03.470
 the whole month leg can hold 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:09.470
 and it will be a little faster here and to give 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:12.320
 I practically had it cleared my 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:14.769
 you advice 2 means but the only 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:22.570
 gloved because see what foams 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:25.570
 means went into the reaction and well 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:25.570
 cleans 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:37.180
 we will try of course to clean this but this 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:52.319
 of course very old all hope 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:58.739
 help and whistle a little longer 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:58.739
 easier to wash here is the result 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:09.460
 while cleaning the lattice washed 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:12.480
 see how well it cleans but i don't 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:16.210
 I want you to wash as oreo I will 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:18.120
 launder I already showed you the way under 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:22.980
 this video will show 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:24.160
 I will write the link as with the help and soda and 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.500
 glue 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.380
 there is generally no effort then i need 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:31.330
 rub just 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:38.340
 the lattice will not climb there and then a little bit 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:38.340
 more than very well survey
