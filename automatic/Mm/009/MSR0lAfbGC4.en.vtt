00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:10.570 
you're going to be testing it over Wi-Fi

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:13.890 
you're going to be testing it over Wi-Fi
and<00:00:11.020> 3g<00:00:11.410> will<00:00:11.889> be<00:00:11.980> dissing<00:00:12.309> the<00:00:12.430> browser<00:00:12.900> and

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:13.900 
and 3g will be dissing the browser and

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.859 
and 3g will be dissing the browser and
through<00:00:14.230> a<00:00:14.290> flash<00:00:15.330> speed<00:00:16.330> testing<00:00:16.660> tool

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:16.869 
through a flash speed testing tool

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:21.150 
through a flash speed testing tool
called<00:00:17.110> speedtest.net<00:00:17.619> and<00:00:19.590> the<00:00:20.590> opening<00:00:21.040> it

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:21.160 
called speedtest.net and the opening it

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.620 
called speedtest.net and the opening it
right<00:00:21.189> now<00:00:21.489> you<00:00:21.669> can<00:00:21.820> see<00:00:21.970> the<00:00:22.149> internet

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:22.630 
right now you can see the internet

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.979 
right now you can see the internet
browser<00:00:23.140> it<00:00:23.860> renders<00:00:24.189> JavaScript<00:00:24.730> and<00:00:24.989> pretty

00:00:25.979 --> 00:00:25.989 
browser it renders JavaScript and pretty

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:33.060 
browser it renders JavaScript and pretty
much<00:00:26.020> it<00:00:26.349> feels<00:00:26.739> like<00:00:26.890> a<00:00:27.009> desktop<00:00:27.340> browser<00:00:32.070> and

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:33.070 
much it feels like a desktop browser and

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.479 
much it feels like a desktop browser and
you<00:00:33.280> can<00:00:33.690> basically<00:00:34.690> zoom<00:00:35.469> in<00:00:35.680> by<00:00:35.950> circling

00:00:36.479 --> 00:00:36.489 
you can basically zoom in by circling

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:39.840 
you can basically zoom in by circling

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:59.850 

the<00:02:58.000> speed<00:02:58.270> test<00:02:58.450> is<00:02:58.600> complete<00:02:59.050> and<00:02:59.380> here<00:02:59.770> are

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
the speed test is complete and here are

the speed test is complete and here are
the<00:02:59.890> results<00:03:00.040> for<00:03:01.170> the<00:03:02.170> test<00:03:02.200> over<00:03:02.650> Wi-Fi<00:03:03.420> this

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
the results for the test over Wi-Fi this

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.800 
the results for the test over Wi-Fi this
is<00:03:04.540> Bharti<00:03:05.050> broadband<00:03:05.470> a<00:03:05.650> dell<00:03:05.980> and<00:03:06.580> now<00:03:07.360> let's

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
is Bharti broadband a dell and now let's

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:13.740 
is Bharti broadband a dell and now let's
switch<00:03:08.110> to<00:03:08.140> 3g<00:03:11.820> Sony's<00:03:12.820> we<00:03:13.000> switch<00:03:13.210> to<00:03:13.390> a<00:03:13.420> canal

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
switch to 3g Sony's we switch to a canal

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.180 
switch to 3g Sony's we switch to a canal
another<00:03:14.020> connection<00:03:14.290> using<00:03:14.710> the<00:03:15.150> icons<00:03:16.150> here

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
another connection using the icons here

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.280 
another connection using the icons here
so<00:03:18.190> we<00:03:18.310> just<00:03:18.340> say<00:03:19.270> switch<00:03:19.690> to<00:03:19.870> be<00:03:19.960> is<00:03:20.080> another

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
so we just say switch to be is another

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:28.010 
so we just say switch to be is another
internet<00:03:20.680> and<00:03:20.920> this<00:03:21.510> connects<00:03:22.510> by<00:03:22.720> a<00:03:22.800> 3.5<00:03:23.800> g

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:28.020 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:30.810 

let's<00:03:29.020> reload<00:03:29.710> this<00:03:29.860> web<00:03:30.040> page<00:03:30.220> to<00:03:30.430> make<00:03:30.460> sure

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:30.820 
let's reload this web page to make sure

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:34.590 
let's reload this web page to make sure
that<00:03:31.090> it<00:03:31.300> doesn't<00:03:32.610> bring<00:03:33.610> the<00:03:33.820> speeds<00:03:34.150> from

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
that it doesn't bring the speeds from

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:55.020 
that it doesn't bring the speeds from
cache<00:03:35.020> or<00:03:35.320> anything<00:03:35.620> like<00:03:35.650> that

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:57.120 

as<00:03:55.540> you<00:03:55.720> can<00:03:55.840> see<00:03:55.990> there's<00:03:56.200> a<00:03:56.319> full<00:03:56.680> flash

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.130 
as you can see there's a full flash

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:01.370 
as you can see there's a full flash
based<00:03:57.750> test<00:03:58.750> and<00:03:59.020> this<00:03:59.650> is<00:03:59.800> the<00:04:00.610> web<00:04:00.760> pages

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
based test and this is the web pages

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.930 
based test and this is the web pages
producing<00:04:02.380> adult<00:04:02.709> flash<00:04:02.920> technologies<00:04:03.730> and

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940 
producing adult flash technologies and

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:07.710 
producing adult flash technologies and
the<00:04:04.840> n900<00:04:05.800> browser<00:04:06.280> is<00:04:06.640> almost<00:04:06.970> perfect<00:04:07.240> and

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
the n900 browser is almost perfect and

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.410 
the n900 browser is almost perfect and
it<00:04:08.470> just<00:04:08.500> renders<00:04:08.950> this<00:04:09.130> as<00:04:09.340> good<00:04:09.850> as<00:04:10.000> it<00:04:10.240> could

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.420 
it just renders this as good as it could

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.320 
it just renders this as good as it could
give<00:04:10.720> it<00:04:10.810> on<00:04:10.930> a<00:04:10.959> desktop<00:04:11.260> so<00:04:12.220> this<00:04:13.000> is<00:04:13.030> the<00:04:13.150> best

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:13.330 
give it on a desktop so this is the best

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:15.830 
give it on a desktop so this is the best
mobile<00:04:13.750> browser<00:04:14.290> out<00:04:14.890> in<00:04:15.069> the<00:04:15.160> market

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
mobile browser out in the market

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.300 
mobile browser out in the market
currently<00:04:16.840> there's<00:04:17.139> no<00:04:17.260> other<00:04:17.680> phone<00:04:18.130> which

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310 
currently there's no other phone which

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:24.000 
currently there's no other phone which
has<00:04:18.459> such<00:04:18.669> a<00:04:18.700> good<00:04:18.880> browser<00:04:22.410> so<00:04:23.410> let's<00:04:23.620> begin

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.010 
has such a good browser so let's begin

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:28.830 
has such a good browser so let's begin
the<00:04:24.250> test<00:04:24.490> for<00:04:25.150> BSNL<00:04:25.960> 3g<00:04:26.080> is<00:04:27.630> expected<00:04:28.630> to<00:04:28.720> get

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 
the test for BSNL 3g is expected to get

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.110 
the test for BSNL 3g is expected to get
about<00:04:29.280> one<00:04:30.280> mbps<00:04:30.550> or<00:04:30.820> something<00:04:31.000> like<00:04:31.060> that

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
about one mbps or something like that

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:58.650 
about one mbps or something like that
stride<00:04:31.900> out

00:04:58.650 --> 00:04:58.660 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:00.210 

as<00:04:59.170> you<00:04:59.320> can<00:04:59.410> see<00:04:59.560> here<00:04:59.770> the<00:04:59.860> speeds<00:05:00.130> are

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:00.220 
as you can see here the speeds are

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:29.600 
as you can see here the speeds are
approaching<00:05:00.640> 1<00:05:00.790> Mbps<00:05:02.340> 1.9<00:05:03.360> 796

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:29.610 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:32.320 

so<00:05:30.240> the<00:05:30.330> speed<00:05:30.599> test<00:05:30.810> over<00:05:31.139> 3g<00:05:31.560> is<00:05:31.620> complete

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:32.330 
so the speed test over 3g is complete

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:37.010 
so the speed test over 3g is complete
got<00:05:33.330> over<00:05:33.770> almost<00:05:34.770> one<00:05:35.189> mbps<00:05:35.430> point<00:05:35.939> 99<00:05:36.509> mbps

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:37.020 
got over almost one mbps point 99 mbps

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:39.670 
got over almost one mbps point 99 mbps
download<00:05:37.379> speed<00:05:37.620> and<00:05:37.860> point<00:05:38.430> p<00:05:38.639> 2<00:05:38.789> Mbps<00:05:39.240> k

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:39.680 
download speed and point p 2 Mbps k

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.110 
download speed and point p 2 Mbps k
upload<00:05:40.680> speed<00:05:40.919> and<00:05:41.159> see<00:05:41.430> you<00:05:41.550> for<00:05:41.729> this<00:05:41.939> for

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:42.120 
upload speed and see you for this for

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:45.260 
upload speed and see you for this for
the<00:05:42.180> confirmation<00:05:42.509> is<00:05:42.840> over<00:05:43.259> 3g<00:05:44.090> 3.5<00:05:45.090> g

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:45.270 
the confirmation is over 3g 3.5 g

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:47.089 
the confirmation is over 3g 3.5 g
actually<00:05:45.659> because<00:05:46.080> you<00:05:46.199> can't<00:05:46.409> see<00:05:46.530> the<00:05:46.680> Wi-Fi

00:05:47.089 --> 00:05:47.099 
actually because you can't see the Wi-Fi

00:05:47.099 --> 00:05:51.650 
actually because you can't see the Wi-Fi
indicator<00:05:48.090> here<00:05:48.659> so
