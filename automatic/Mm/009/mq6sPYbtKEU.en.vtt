00:00:01.139 --> 00:00:06.500
 the worst greeting to all of them is that the only thing that is ranked 

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:11.320
 special michel in the sense that for most of you this proves that 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:12.189
 children 

00:00:12.189 --> 00:00:16.989
 so I'm doing how sure is a little hard skate video of the 

00:00:16.989 --> 00:00:21.249
 team in the late morning to an end a lifetime quick presentation punctuated his 

00:00:21.249 --> 00:00:24.179
 operational protection 

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:27.589
 in the world can be declared Thursday okay before this meeting 

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:30.739
 do not take the lead and good atmosphere fair play this is what is good 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:35.520
 so that sony video like that really serves too fast in safety that 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.990
 so do not take the time to comment and so 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:42.070
 because the father tells himself to applevic to the players what can I say 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:42.870
 to the naked 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.940
 there I prepare my last word that I would like to see commented 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.360
 the lightest vehicle 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:50.600
 no question in mind 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.910
 the debate is about developing like that 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.740
 and maybe between these two for vincent 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:01.460
 by cons I have a small problem he had pulled from pulp this is 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:02.170
 A try 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.130
 but I can not get to the erected stele and the serial numbers all in fact 

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:08.020
 they will agree stable club 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.020
 this 34-year-old woman who come 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.830
 but I hope it is not before the end of the holidays it would not hurt 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:17.370
 francis heaulme 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:20.370
 I have all the clips and if I know myself especially if the short rates 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.030
 I find myself really bad in comment and as it's a great guy 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.360
 world of clubs that support him 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.930
 we maintain from sites comments a little bit 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.580
 and so she commented as well latin schumacher I'm too strong for 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.750
 I want to reassure you because I really find in this school 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.740
 luckily not be the only one to think that but at least I'll try to 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.530
 me 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.970
 that's the least of the things that my kids will tell me commission can 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.410
 so think of a little coupe like that 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:50.960
 I always have more in hand always advise and thank you 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.810
 anyway 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.740
 and that's good fun 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.770
 to auray so that we will say normal possible first round 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.010
 concretely the digital he specified the credit you who was trying 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:05.010
 not necessarily ideas that hold everything will be for the next 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.009
 so you see there a good trip went super fast I finished haunting this 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.870
 that I will tell you me it's the next if you liked heiress
