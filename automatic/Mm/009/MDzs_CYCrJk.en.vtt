here<00:00:06.860> you<00:00:06.950> can<00:00:07.130> see<00:00:07.370> a<00:00:07.399> very<00:00:08.120> simple<00:00:08.360> PVC<00:00:09.350> pipe

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:09.559 
here you can see a very simple PVC pipe

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:15.790 
here you can see a very simple PVC pipe
halogen<00:00:10.490> system<00:00:11.530> this<00:00:12.530> is<00:00:12.770> a<00:00:14.290> design<00:00:15.290> is<00:00:15.530> in

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:15.800 
halogen system this is a design is in

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:23.429 
halogen system this is a design is in
2008<00:00:16.730> and<00:00:17.529> is<00:00:18.529> already<00:00:18.890> here<00:00:19.130> since<00:00:19.369> 2008<00:00:20.150> and

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:23.439 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:27.880 

it's<00:00:24.439> a<00:00:24.650> very<00:00:24.859> simple<00:00:25.100> system<00:00:26.890> using

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:27.890 
it's a very simple system using

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.150 
it's a very simple system using
stainless<00:00:28.160> plate<00:00:28.550> to<00:00:28.789> split<00:00:29.060> the<00:00:29.410> you<00:00:30.410> for<00:00:31.039> the

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:31.160 
stainless plate to split the you for the

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:37.270 
stainless plate to split the you for the

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.280 
electrolysis a charger this system if I

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.180 
electrolysis a charger this system if I
don't<00:00:37.550> have<00:00:37.820> the<00:00:38.090> wind<00:00:38.390> system<00:00:38.899> is<00:00:39.500> also<00:00:39.710> the

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.190 
don't have the wind system is also the

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.150 
don't have the wind system is also the
wind<00:00:40.610> turbine<00:00:41.030> which<00:00:41.870> one<00:00:42.170> is<00:00:42.320> traveling<00:00:43.040> in

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:43.160 
wind turbine which one is traveling in

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.580 
wind turbine which one is traveling in
20<00:00:43.850> 20<00:00:44.450> kilometer<00:00:44.809> per<00:00:44.870> hour<00:00:45.020> you<00:00:45.350> already

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:45.590 
20 20 kilometer per hour you already

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.000 
20 20 kilometer per hour you already
have<00:00:45.829> a<00:00:46.040> generator<00:00:46.460> with<00:00:47.440> power<00:00:48.440> from<00:00:48.770> there

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
have a generator with power from there

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.940 
have a generator with power from there
and<00:00:49.670> then<00:00:49.969> also<00:00:50.180> the<00:00:50.480> wind<00:00:50.719> help<00:00:51.410> to<00:00:51.620> charge

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:51.950 
and then also the wind help to charge

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:55.690 
and then also the wind help to charge
the<00:00:52.879> hydrogen<00:00:53.480> if<00:00:54.410> I<00:00:54.649> don't<00:00:54.890> use<00:00:55.100> the<00:00:55.280> wind<00:00:55.489> I

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:55.700 
the hydrogen if I don't use the wind I

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.860 
the hydrogen if I don't use the wind I
just<00:00:55.940> use<00:00:56.120> the<00:00:56.270> alternator<00:00:56.750> from<00:00:57.649> the<00:00:57.800> Baloch

00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:58.870 
just use the alternator from the Baloch

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.090 
just use the alternator from the Baloch
motorbike<00:00:59.870> is<00:01:00.020> a<00:01:00.110> small<00:01:00.410> motor<00:01:00.559> bike<00:01:00.829> is<00:01:00.949> only

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
motorbike is a small motor bike is only

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:06.480 
motorbike is a small motor bike is only
125<00:01:01.850> CC<00:01:02.120> and<00:01:02.960> there's<00:01:03.230> only<00:01:03.350> about<00:01:03.620> 10<00:01:04.039> amps<00:01:04.489> so

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490 
125 CC and there's only about 10 amps so

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.520 
125 CC and there's only about 10 amps so
it's<00:01:07.490> not<00:01:07.700> quite<00:01:08.000> that<00:01:08.180> big<00:01:08.509> like<00:01:08.750> car<00:01:09.049> so<00:01:09.470> I

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
it's not quite that big like car so I

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.270 
it's not quite that big like car so I
say<00:01:09.950> without<00:01:10.520> the<00:01:10.580> turbine<00:01:11.240> I<00:01:11.590> save<00:01:12.590> about<00:01:12.770> 7

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
say without the turbine I save about 7

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:19.929 
say without the turbine I save about 7
to<00:01:13.430> 10<00:01:13.460> percent<00:01:14.290> fuel<00:01:16.270> but<00:01:18.220> but<00:01:19.220> that's<00:01:19.670> not

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:19.939 
to 10 percent fuel but but that's not

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:23.170 
to 10 percent fuel but but that's not
only<00:01:20.180> because<00:01:20.869> you<00:01:21.500> also<00:01:22.070> reduce<00:01:22.729> the

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
only because you also reduce the

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.170 
only because you also reduce the
pollution<00:01:23.479> up<00:01:23.780> to<00:01:23.930> 40%<00:01:24.729> that's<00:01:25.729> the<00:01:26.000> most

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
pollution up to 40% that's the most

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.080 
pollution up to 40% that's the most
benefit<00:01:26.720> you<00:01:27.290> save<00:01:28.100> a<00:01:28.130> little<00:01:28.340> bit<00:01:28.580> of<00:01:28.700> fuel

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
benefit you save a little bit of fuel

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.990 
benefit you save a little bit of fuel
but<00:01:29.869> the<00:01:30.229> main<00:01:30.439> thing<00:01:30.740> is<00:01:30.770> the<00:01:31.130> pollution<00:01:31.430> is

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
but the main thing is the pollution is

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.050 
but the main thing is the pollution is
reduced<00:01:32.630> by<00:01:32.869> 40%<00:01:34.119> adding<00:01:35.119> this<00:01:35.240> turbine

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
reduced by 40% adding this turbine

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.380 
reduced by 40% adding this turbine
adding<00:01:38.060> this<00:01:38.210> turbine<00:01:38.600> and<00:01:38.930> I<00:01:39.140> managed<00:01:39.680> to<00:01:39.829> say

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390 
adding this turbine and I managed to say

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:47.200 
adding this turbine and I managed to say
my<00:01:41.390> gain<00:01:41.900> 15%<00:01:42.860> so<00:01:45.640> still<00:01:46.640> you<00:01:46.820> know<00:01:47.030> even

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
my gain 15% so still you know even

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.690 
my gain 15% so still you know even
little<00:01:47.810> bit<00:01:47.990> but<00:01:48.259> it<00:01:48.409> still<00:01:48.590> helped<00:01:48.860> and<00:01:49.130> Plus

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
little bit but it still helped and Plus

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.840 
little bit but it still helped and Plus
that<00:01:50.000> of<00:01:50.869> course<00:01:51.820> you<00:01:52.820> cut<00:01:53.090> your<00:01:53.270> pollution<00:01:53.899> so

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
that of course you cut your pollution so

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.870 
that of course you cut your pollution so
my<00:01:55.850> idea<00:01:56.240> is<00:01:56.299> to<00:01:56.479> add<00:01:56.780> more<00:01:57.430> to<00:01:58.430> add<00:01:58.610> more

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
my idea is to add more to add more

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.270 
my idea is to add more to add more
turbine<00:01:59.720> like<00:02:00.020> this<00:02:00.229> winner<00:02:00.530> here

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
turbine like this winner here

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.240 
turbine like this winner here
maybe<00:02:01.700> attach<00:02:02.090> alternator<00:02:02.659> to<00:02:03.110> the<00:02:03.530> wheel<00:02:03.740> so

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
maybe attach alternator to the wheel so

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.639 
maybe attach alternator to the wheel so
then<00:02:04.460> I<00:02:04.579> can<00:02:04.790> be<00:02:04.939> like<00:02:05.149> 60%<00:02:05.509> something<00:02:06.439> that

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:06.649 
then I can be like 60% something that

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:14.840 
then I can be like 60% something that
will<00:02:06.799> be<00:02:06.920> good

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.910 

you
