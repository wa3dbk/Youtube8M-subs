00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.219 
really cool I think this crafting system
is<00:01:32.820> one<00:01:33.000> of<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.180> biggest<00:01:33.420> draws<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:33.900> this<00:01:34.049> game

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
is one of the biggest draws to this game

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.980 
is one of the biggest draws to this game
and<00:01:34.530> also<00:01:35.009> one<00:01:35.850> of<00:01:35.880> my<00:01:36.119> biggest<00:01:36.390> flaws<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:36.900> the

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
and also one of my biggest flaws to the

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.600 
and also one of my biggest flaws to the
game<00:01:37.140> as<00:01:37.290> well<00:01:37.500> so<00:01:37.770> we'll<00:01:37.950> talk<00:01:38.130> about<00:01:38.280> that<00:01:38.430> in

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
game as well so we'll talk about that in

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.370 
game as well so we'll talk about that in
a<00:01:38.820> second<00:01:39.270> so<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.689> final<00:01:39.869> thing<00:01:40.049> that<00:01:40.229> I

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
a second so the final thing that I

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.050 
a second so the final thing that I
wanted<00:01:40.680> to<00:01:40.799> talk<00:01:40.979> about<00:01:41.009> was<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:41.640> quests

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
wanted to talk about was the quests

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.240 
wanted to talk about was the quests
within<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.630> game<00:01:42.899> you<00:01:43.530> can<00:01:43.680> actually<00:01:43.920> get

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
within the game you can actually get

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.030 
within the game you can actually get
quest<00:01:44.549> from<00:01:44.850> other<00:01:45.119> prisoners<00:01:45.689> such<00:01:45.990> as<00:01:46.259> cause

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
quest from other prisoners such as cause

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.160 
quest from other prisoners such as cause
distractions<00:01:47.790> at<00:01:47.939> like<00:01:48.090> dinner<00:01:48.450> or<00:01:48.509> breakfast

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
distractions at like dinner or breakfast

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.200 
distractions at like dinner or breakfast
time<00:01:49.409> and<00:01:49.680> then<00:01:50.100> that<00:01:50.310> will<00:01:50.520> give<00:01:50.729> you<00:01:50.909> money

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
time and then that will give you money

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.090 
time and then that will give you money
the<00:01:51.720> money<00:01:51.930> that<00:01:52.170> is<00:01:52.320> then<00:01:52.500> used<00:01:52.740> to<00:01:52.920> get

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
the money that is then used to get

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.469 
the money that is then used to get
components<00:01:53.759> which<00:01:53.880> is<00:01:54.030> really<00:01:54.299> useful

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
components which is really useful

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:55.730 
components which is really useful
because<00:01:54.840> then<00:01:55.170> you<00:01:55.290> can<00:01:55.439> use<00:01:55.590> those

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
because then you can use those

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.980 
because then you can use those
components<00:01:56.130> for<00:01:56.490> crafting<00:01:56.969> which<00:01:57.540> is<00:01:57.750> awesome

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
components for crafting which is awesome

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.749 
components for crafting which is awesome
because<00:01:58.320> obviously<00:01:58.619> you<00:01:58.829> need<00:01:59.009> to<00:01:59.280> craft<00:01:59.549> to

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
because obviously you need to craft to

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.609 
because obviously you need to craft to
get<00:01:59.909> out<00:02:00.119> of<00:02:00.149> the<00:02:00.420> prison<00:02:00.659> which<00:02:00.960> is<00:02:01.110> important

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
get out of the prison which is important

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.560 
get out of the prison which is important

thing my biggest problem with this game

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.639 
thing my biggest problem with this game
though<00:02:07.979> is<00:02:08.310> obviously<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:09.509> whole<00:02:10.170> tutorial
