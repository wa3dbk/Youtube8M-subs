it's the Nikon d3100 and it's a DSLR
digital<00:00:20.939> camera<00:00:21.840> that<00:00:21.869> takes<00:00:22.260> still<00:00:22.560> pictures

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
digital camera that takes still pictures

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.700 
digital camera that takes still pictures
but<00:00:23.609> then<00:00:23.730> it<00:00:23.850> also<00:00:23.970> has<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.689> function<00:00:24.960> of

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
but then it also has the function of

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.150 
but then it also has the function of
taking<00:00:26.519> videos<00:00:27.210> as<00:00:27.480> well<00:00:27.720> and<00:00:28.050> I'm<00:00:28.980> obviously

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
taking videos as well and I'm obviously

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.299 
taking videos as well and I'm obviously
not<00:00:29.580> taking<00:00:30.090> this<00:00:30.570> video<00:00:30.929> on<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.890> Nikon

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
not taking this video on the Nikon

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.310 
not taking this video on the Nikon
camera<00:00:32.730> I'm<00:00:32.820> using<00:00:32.969> my<00:00:33.239> old<00:00:33.390> Canon<00:00:33.960> camera

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
camera I'm using my old Canon camera

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.750 
camera I'm using my old Canon camera
which<00:00:34.469> is<00:00:34.620> just<00:00:34.800> a<00:00:34.890> little<00:00:35.100> point<00:00:35.340> and<00:00:35.489> shoot

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
which is just a little point and shoot

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.069 
which is just a little point and shoot
camera<00:00:36.270> it's<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:37.079> SD<00:00:37.579> 1200<00:00:38.579> I<00:00:38.700> believe<00:00:39.030> and<00:00:39.360> so

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
camera it's the SD 1200 I believe and so

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.930 
camera it's the SD 1200 I believe and so
this<00:00:40.320> video<00:00:40.649> quality<00:00:40.920> is<00:00:41.219> not<00:00:41.430> going<00:00:41.640> to<00:00:41.700> be<00:00:41.790> as

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
this video quality is not going to be as

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.450 
this video quality is not going to be as
good<00:00:42.180> as<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.510> Nikon<00:00:42.870> but<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:43.770> Nikon<00:00:44.160> video

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
good as the Nikon but the Nikon video

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.850 
good as the Nikon but the Nikon video
quality<00:00:44.700> is<00:00:45.030> great<00:00:45.329> it<00:00:45.510> takes<00:00:45.719> videos<00:00:46.140> in<00:00:46.350> HD

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
quality is great it takes videos in HD

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.850 
quality is great it takes videos in HD
and<00:00:47.579> it<00:00:48.030> also<00:00:48.210> puts<00:00:48.899> them<00:00:49.110> into<00:00:49.289> dot<00:00:49.590> move

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
and it also puts them into dot move

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.920 
and it also puts them into dot move
files<00:00:50.190> so<00:00:50.640> it's<00:00:50.850> compatible<00:00:51.210> with<00:00:51.570> Apple

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
files so it's compatible with Apple

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.950 
files so it's compatible with Apple
products<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:52.559> QuickTime<00:00:53.550> QuickTime<00:00:54.510> Pro<00:00:54.719> if

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
primarily actually got the Nikon to take

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.639 
primarily actually got the Nikon to take
better<00:01:00.180> still<00:01:00.539> pictures<00:01:00.899> of<00:01:01.079> our<00:01:01.230> daughters

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
and it is our first DSLR camera it's

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.359 
and it is our first DSLR camera it's
very<00:01:05.820> like<00:01:06.390> entry-level<00:01:06.840> so<00:01:07.650> if<00:01:07.860> you've<00:01:08.130> never

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
very like entry-level so if you've never

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.450 
very like entry-level so if you've never
had<00:01:08.640> a<00:01:08.670> DSLR<00:01:09.299> camera<00:01:09.630> it's<00:01:09.810> a<00:01:09.900> great<00:01:10.140> option

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
had a DSLR camera it's a great option

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.160 
had a DSLR camera it's a great option
because<00:01:11.460> it's<00:01:11.729> user-friendly<00:01:12.540> and<00:01:12.810> you<00:01:12.990> can

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
because it's user-friendly and you can

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.410 
because it's user-friendly and you can
use<00:01:13.380> it<00:01:13.500> on<00:01:13.590> auto<00:01:13.920> most<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.430> time<00:01:14.670> if<00:01:14.939> you<00:01:15.390> are

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
use it on auto most the time if you are

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.440 
use it on auto most the time if you are
so<00:01:16.049> inclined<00:01:16.350> my<00:01:17.189> husband's<00:01:17.610> actually<00:01:17.759> into

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
so inclined my husband's actually into

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.130 
so inclined my husband's actually into
this<00:01:18.600> a<00:01:18.810> lot<00:01:19.799> more<00:01:20.040> than<00:01:20.250> I<00:01:20.340> am<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:21.110> so<00:01:22.110> I

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
this a lot more than I am and so I

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.920 
this a lot more than I am and so I
primarily<00:01:22.650> use<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.460> camera<00:01:24.119> with<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.689> main

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
primarily use the camera with the main

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.920 
primarily use the camera with the main
lens<00:01:25.320> that<00:01:25.740> came<00:01:25.950> with<00:01:26.220> it<00:01:26.250> it's<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.880> 18<00:01:27.299> to<00:01:27.540> 55

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.469 
lens that came with it it's the 18 to 55
millimeter<00:01:28.530> lens<00:01:28.799> and<00:01:29.159> then<00:01:29.909> I<00:01:30.000> use<00:01:30.180> it<00:01:30.299> a<00:01:30.360> lot

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
millimeter lens and then I use it a lot

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.600 
millimeter lens and then I use it a lot
of<00:01:30.630> times<00:01:30.840> in<00:01:30.990> auto<00:01:31.170> mode<00:01:31.530> he's<00:01:32.280> actually

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
of times in auto mode he's actually

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.120 
of times in auto mode he's actually
gotten<00:01:33.240> a<00:01:33.299> lot<00:01:33.450> more<00:01:33.509> into<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.079> functions<00:01:34.650> and

instances<00:01:49.799> because<00:01:50.310> it's<00:01:51.060> so<00:01:51.689> versatile<00:01:52.290> so

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
instances because it's so versatile so

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.630 
instances because it's so versatile so
you<00:01:53.479> have<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.720> ability<00:01:55.140> to<00:01:55.170> just<00:01:55.710> take<00:01:56.340> better

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
you have the ability to just take better

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.600 
you have the ability to just take better
pictures<00:01:56.729> with<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:58.439> auto<00:01:58.590> function<00:01:59.009> or<00:01:59.549> you

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
pictures with the auto function or you

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.760 
pictures with the auto function or you
can<00:02:00.270> get<00:02:00.390> into<00:02:00.659> trying<00:02:00.869> to<00:02:00.990> be<00:02:01.140> more<00:02:01.290> artistic

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
can get into trying to be more artistic

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.139 
can get into trying to be more artistic
with<00:02:01.890> all<00:02:02.100> these<00:02:02.219> different<00:02:02.430> functions<00:02:02.969> that

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
with all these different functions that

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.410 
with all these different functions that
it<00:02:03.210> has<00:02:03.329> on<00:02:03.540> it<00:02:03.750> and<00:02:04.310> you<00:02:05.310> can<00:02:05.700> set<00:02:06.270> which

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
it has on it and you can set which

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.410 
it has on it and you can set which
priority<00:02:07.049> that<00:02:07.229> you<00:02:07.320> want<00:02:07.560> here<00:02:08.209> along<00:02:09.209> the

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
priority that you want here along the

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.630 
priority that you want here along the
side<00:02:09.450> I<00:02:10.110> know<00:02:10.440> that<00:02:10.709> the<00:02:10.830> one<00:02:10.979> that<00:02:11.099> we<00:02:11.250> use<00:02:11.430> the

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
side I know that the one that we use the

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.790 
side I know that the one that we use the
most<00:02:11.819> if<00:02:12.150> we're<00:02:12.300> taking<00:02:12.810> still<00:02:13.050> pictures

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
most if we're taking still pictures

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.220 
most if we're taking still pictures
aperture<00:02:14.280> to<00:02:14.940> kind<00:02:15.150> of<00:02:15.240> change<00:02:15.600> that<00:02:15.870> around

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
aperture to kind of change that around

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.650 
aperture to kind of change that around
and<00:02:16.770> make<00:02:17.460> that<00:02:18.620> better<00:02:19.620> but<00:02:20.340> then<00:02:20.550> there<00:02:20.880> is<00:02:21.150> a

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
and make that better but then there is a

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.360 
and make that better but then there is a
lot<00:02:21.930> of<00:02:21.960> different<00:02:22.410> modes<00:02:22.590> here<00:02:23.100> and<00:02:23.280> I'm

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
lot of different modes here and I'm

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.550

it and you do then you hit it to stop it

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.240 
it and you do then you hit it to stop it
as<00:03:23.760> well<00:03:23.940> the<00:03:24.570> one<00:03:24.720> thing<00:03:24.870> about<00:03:24.989> the<00:03:25.260> D<00:03:25.410> 3100

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
as well the one thing about the D 3100

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.310 
as well the one thing about the D 3100
is<00:03:26.459> that<00:03:26.700> it<00:03:26.910> is<00:03:27.090> not<00:03:27.330> compatible<00:03:27.810> with<00:03:28.290> a

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
is that it is not compatible with a

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.010 
is that it is not compatible with a
wireless<00:03:28.920> remote<00:03:29.130> so<00:03:29.940> we<00:03:30.090> do<00:03:30.330> have<00:03:30.540> a<00:03:30.600> wired

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:31.020 
wireless remote so we do have a wired

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:33.830 
wireless remote so we do have a wired
remote<00:03:31.230> for<00:03:32.040> it<00:03:32.220> that<00:03:32.550> I<00:03:32.580> can<00:03:32.940> focus<00:03:33.239> if<00:03:33.690> I'm

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
remote for it that I can focus if I'm

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.110 
remote for it that I can focus if I'm
sitting<00:03:34.110> away<00:03:34.440> from<00:03:34.650> the<00:03:34.770> camera<00:03:35.160> I<00:03:35.400> can<00:03:35.910> focus

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
sitting away from the camera I can focus

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.680 
sitting away from the camera I can focus
it<00:03:36.450> in<00:03:36.570> on<00:03:36.690> my<00:03:36.840> subject<00:03:37.140> but<00:03:37.850> it<00:03:38.850> is<00:03:39.450> not

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
it in on my subject but it is not

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.080 
it in on my subject but it is not
compatible<00:03:40.050> with<00:03:40.350> a<00:03:40.530> wireless<00:03:40.860> remote<00:03:41.370> so<00:03:42.030> you

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
compatible with a wireless remote so you

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.530 
compatible with a wireless remote so you
can't<00:03:42.450> actually<00:03:42.870> be<00:03:43.320> like<00:03:43.680> 20<00:03:44.610> feet<00:03:44.790> from<00:03:44.970> it

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
can't actually be like 20 feet from it

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.270 
can't actually be like 20 feet from it
or<00:03:45.810> anything<00:03:45.989> like<00:03:46.170> that<00:03:46.290> you<00:03:46.830> have<00:03:46.860> to<00:03:47.040> be

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
or anything like that you have to be

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.070

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
within Accords length away to focus it

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.229 
within Accords length away to focus it
and<00:03:49.260> it<00:03:49.800> does<00:03:50.010> not<00:03:50.190> work<00:03:50.430> for<00:03:50.459> video<00:03:50.940> it<00:03:51.209> just

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
and it does not work for video it just

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:54.080 
and it does not work for video it just
takes<00:03:52.050> it<00:03:52.470> either<00:03:52.620> focuses<00:03:53.310> it<00:03:53.489> or<00:03:53.670> takes<00:03:53.970> a

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
takes it either focuses it or takes a

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.990 
takes it either focuses it or takes a
picture<00:03:54.270> it<00:03:54.720> will<00:03:55.410> not<00:03:55.620> start<00:03:56.010> the<00:03:56.160> video<00:03:56.310> with

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
picture it will not start the video with

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.530 
picture it will not start the video with
a<00:03:57.209> remote<00:03:57.690> at<00:03:57.900> all<00:03:58.080> so<00:03:58.980> it's<00:03:59.489> a<00:03:59.850> great<00:04:00.120> basic

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
a remote at all so it's a great basic

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:07.520 
Nikon bag and then the extra lens to put
on<00:04:06.300> it<00:04:06.480> as<00:04:06.600> well

beautiful pictures and my husband
ashley<00:04:27.900> is<00:04:28.020> a<00:04:28.050> lot<00:04:28.350> into<00:04:28.620> a<00:04:29.330> lot<00:04:30.330> more<00:04:30.510> into

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
ashley is a lot into a lot more into

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.020 
ashley is a lot into a lot more into
changing<00:04:31.740> these<00:04:31.950> things<00:04:32.250> and<00:04:32.610> knowing<00:04:32.880> what

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
changing these things and knowing what

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.780 
changing these things and knowing what
environments<00:04:33.660> are<00:04:33.780> good<00:04:33.930> for<00:04:34.110> what<00:04:34.290> but<00:04:35.070> I

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:35.790 
environments are good for what but I

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:38.000 
environments are good for what but I
find<00:04:36.360> that<00:04:36.540> even<00:04:36.780> though<00:04:37.110> I<00:04:37.140> just<00:04:37.410> know<00:04:37.770> the

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.010 
find that even though I just know the

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:41.030 
find that even though I just know the
bare<00:04:38.190> minimum<00:04:38.700> about<00:04:38.940> it<00:04:39.150> that<00:04:39.750> it's<00:04:40.740> still<00:04:41.010> a

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:41.040 
bare minimum about it that it's still a

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.380 
bare minimum about it that it's still a
really<00:04:41.310> functional<00:04:41.760> camera<00:04:42.000> for<00:04:42.150> me<00:04:42.240> and

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:42.390 
really functional camera for me and

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:43.940 
really functional camera for me and
definitely<00:04:42.720> takes<00:04:42.930> better<00:04:43.110> pictures<00:04:43.200> than<00:04:43.560> my

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:43.950 
definitely takes better pictures than my

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:46.160 
definitely takes better pictures than my
little<00:04:44.100> point-and-shoot<00:04:44.670> of<00:04:44.880> course<00:04:45.120> so<00:04:46.080> you

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:46.170 
little point-and-shoot of course so you

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:47.720 
little point-and-shoot of course so you
can<00:04:46.290> see<00:04:46.470> all<00:04:46.680> of<00:04:46.860> our<00:04:46.950> extra<00:04:47.220> stuff<00:04:47.430> is<00:04:47.580> down

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:47.730 
can see all of our extra stuff is down

artistic<00:06:13.710> pictures<00:06:14.040> maybe<00:06:14.310> I'll<00:06:14.520> learn<00:06:14.669> how

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:14.910 
artistic pictures maybe I'll learn how

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:16.820 
artistic pictures maybe I'll learn how
to<00:06:14.940> use<00:06:15.210> the<00:06:15.390> aperture<00:06:15.840> and<00:06:15.990> ISO<00:06:16.140> and<00:06:16.530> all<00:06:16.650> that

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:16.830 
to use the aperture and ISO and all that

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:18.830 
to use the aperture and ISO and all that
