home and the stories unraveling itself
and<00:01:07.240> you're<00:01:07.330> trying<00:01:07.479> to<00:01:07.600> work<00:01:07.720> out<00:01:07.900> what

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.020 
and you're trying to work out what

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.719 
and you're trying to work out what
happened<00:01:08.409> and<00:01:08.620> but<00:01:08.979> the<00:01:09.100> central<00:01:09.490> conceit

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:09.729 
happened and but the central conceit

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:11.610 
happened and but the central conceit
it's<00:01:09.909> like<00:01:10.060> basically<00:01:10.270> did<00:01:10.930> I<00:01:10.960> do<00:01:11.080> this<00:01:11.409> or

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:11.620 
it's like basically did I do this or

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:13.289 
it's like basically did I do this or
does<00:01:11.710> someone<00:01:11.890> else<00:01:12.100> do<00:01:12.250> this<00:01:12.400> what's<00:01:13.060> really

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:13.299 
does someone else do this what's really

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:15.870 
does someone else do this what's really
really<00:01:13.810> clever<00:01:13.990> about<00:01:14.200> it<00:01:14.380> is<00:01:14.710> what<00:01:15.430> you<00:01:15.460> do<00:01:15.730> in

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:15.880 
really clever about it is what you do in

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.760 
really clever about it is what you do in
the<00:01:15.970> game<00:01:16.120> actually<00:01:16.330> shapes<00:01:16.870> the<00:01:17.110> story<00:01:17.380> and

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
the game actually shapes the story and

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.440 
the game actually shapes the story and
what<00:01:17.950> I<00:01:17.980> mean<00:01:18.100> by<00:01:18.160> that<00:01:18.430> like<00:01:18.610> objects<00:01:19.360> that

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
what I mean by that like objects that

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.340 
what I mean by that like objects that
you<00:01:19.540> interact<00:01:19.930> with<00:01:20.020> choices<00:01:20.950> that<00:01:21.280> you<00:01:21.400> make

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
you interact with choices that you make

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.100 
you interact with choices that you make
actually<00:01:23.350> shape<00:01:24.130> the<00:01:25.030> entire<00:01:25.060> story<00:01:25.780> not<00:01:26.050> just

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 
actually shape the entire story not just

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:27.570 
actually shape the entire story not just
like<00:01:26.470> you'll<00:01:26.710> go<00:01:26.830> down<00:01:26.980> one<00:01:27.160> path<00:01:27.340> through

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:27.580 
like you'll go down one path through

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.300 
like you'll go down one path through
another<00:01:27.790> path<00:01:28.000> like<00:01:28.240> most<00:01:28.450> games<00:01:29.160> it<00:01:30.160> won't

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 
another path like most games it won't

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.670 
another path like most games it won't
actually<00:01:30.370> shape<00:01:30.730> the<00:01:30.910> entire<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:32.650> entire

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:32.680 
actually shape the entire the entire

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.770 
actually shape the entire the entire
plot<00:01:33.250> it's<00:01:33.790> really<00:01:33.970> hard<00:01:34.090> to<00:01:34.300> explain<00:01:34.540> it's

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 
plot it's really hard to explain it's

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.060 
plot it's really hard to explain it's
much<00:01:34.900> easier<00:01:34.930> to<00:01:35.290> explain<00:01:35.590> what<00:01:35.800> someone

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.070 
much easier to explain what someone

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:37.770 
much easier to explain what someone
plays<00:01:36.250> it<00:01:36.490> and<00:01:36.640> the<00:01:37.000> idea<00:01:37.240> is<00:01:37.300> that<00:01:37.420> you<00:01:37.570> play

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
plays it and the idea is that you play

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.360 
plays it and the idea is that you play
it<00:01:37.900> and<00:01:37.990> then<00:01:38.110> you<00:01:38.200> dive<00:01:38.770> onto<00:01:38.980> the<00:01:39.190> website

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:39.370 
it and then you dive onto the website

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:41.510 
it and then you dive onto the website
home<00:01:39.790> horror<00:01:40.030> for<00:01:40.360> such<00:01:40.600> what<00:01:40.780> happened<00:01:41.140> and

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:43.900 
there's all these really nicely written

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.480
