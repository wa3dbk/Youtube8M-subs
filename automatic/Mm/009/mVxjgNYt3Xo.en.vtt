00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
yeah that's when I actually I first

or<00:01:04.830> something<00:01:05.070> yeah<00:01:05.700> it<00:01:06.330> was<00:01:06.479> fun<00:01:06.720> and<00:01:07.290> it<00:01:07.439> was

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
or something yeah it was fun and it was

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.090 
or something yeah it was fun and it was
amazing<00:01:08.180> cool<00:01:09.180> because<00:01:09.360> I<00:01:09.510> had<00:01:09.960> to<00:01:10.320> it

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
amazing cool because I had to it

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.740 
amazing cool because I had to it
couldn't<00:01:11.549> every<00:01:11.880> day<00:01:11.970> couldn't<00:01:12.299> be<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.540> same

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
couldn't every day couldn't be the same

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.870 
couldn't every day couldn't be the same
like<00:01:13.409> I<00:01:13.439> couldn't<00:01:13.920> work<00:01:14.130> on<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.400> same<00:01:14.549> image

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880
