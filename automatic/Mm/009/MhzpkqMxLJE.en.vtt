collision between player 1 get wrecked
and<00:00:10.969> hope<00:00:11.969> they<00:00:12.630> are<00:00:12.780> one<00:00:12.990> get<00:00:13.230> wrecked<00:00:13.530> and<00:00:14.599> if

and hope they are one get wrecked and if

and hope they are one get wrecked and if
finish<00:00:17.810> addressed<00:00:18.810> of<00:00:18.960> finish<00:00:20.270> then<00:00:22.760> weave

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
finish addressed of finish then weave

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.080 
finish addressed of finish then weave
right<00:00:24.060> out<00:00:24.300> that<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:25.080> player<00:00:25.439> is<00:00:25.740> win<00:00:26.670> the

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
right out that the player is win the

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.060 
right out that the player is win the
game<00:00:27.920> by<00:00:28.920> just<00:00:29.250> copied<00:00:29.730> it<00:00:29.849> to<00:00:30.000> here<00:00:30.599> and

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:31.070 
game by just copied it to here and

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.389 
game by just copied it to here and
instead<00:00:32.070> of<00:00:32.340> game<00:00:32.640> over<00:00:33.000> I've<00:00:33.210> right<00:00:33.480> out<00:00:33.719> that

00:00:34.389 --> 00:00:34.399 
instead of game over I've right out that

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:41.270 
instead of game over I've right out that
you<00:00:35.399> win<00:00:36.050> all<00:00:37.050> right<00:00:38.750> let's<00:00:39.750> try<00:00:40.140> to<00:00:40.290> compile

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
you win all right let's try to compile

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.990 
you win all right let's try to compile
it

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.800 

m<00:00:49.000> dot<00:00:49.300> CPP

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:53.810 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:01:00.510 

Oh<00:00:54.790> paranthesis<00:00:56.530> now<00:00:57.530> we<00:00:57.590> can<00:00:58.010> compile<00:00:58.520> it<00:00:58.730> and

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:00.520 
Oh paranthesis now we can compile it and

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:07.150 
Oh paranthesis now we can compile it and
run<00:01:01.520> it<00:01:03.580> that<00:01:04.580> was<00:01:04.820> quick<00:01:05.620> it<00:01:06.620> don't<00:01:07.010> even

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:07.160 
run it that was quick it don't even

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.720 
run it that was quick it don't even
start<00:01:07.850> so<00:01:08.330> I<00:01:08.690> think<00:01:09.140> the<00:01:09.620> finished<00:01:10.010> coordinate

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:10.730 
start so I think the finished coordinate

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:18.100 
start so I think the finished coordinate
is<00:01:10.970> don't<00:01:11.360> changed<00:01:12.050> in<00:01:12.320> here<00:01:16.600> so<00:01:17.600> the<00:01:17.810> current

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110 
is don't changed in here so the current

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.460 
is don't changed in here so the current
equal<00:01:18.830> to<00:01:19.040> free<00:01:19.400> and<00:01:19.640> i<00:01:20.210> change<00:01:20.510> the<00:01:20.840> free<00:01:21.200> in

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 
equal to free and i change the free in

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.640 
equal to free and i change the free in
the<00:01:21.620> map<00:01:21.920> dot<00:01:22.280> cpp<00:01:23.000> so<00:01:23.300> in<00:01:23.480> here<00:01:23.870> i<00:01:23.900> just<00:01:24.050> change

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:24.650 
the map dot cpp so in here i just change

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:32.260 
the map dot cpp so in here i just change
it<00:01:24.830> to<00:01:25.040> free<00:01:27.700> compile<00:01:28.700> and<00:01:29.180> run<00:01:30.550> ok<00:01:31.550> it<00:01:31.760> seems<00:01:32.060> a

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
it to free compile and run ok it seems a

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:37.390 
it to free compile and run ok it seems a
little<00:01:32.300> more<00:01:32.750> promising<00:01:33.580> so<00:01:34.580> if<00:01:35.060> i<00:01:35.300> go<00:01:35.690> and<00:01:36.400> i

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:37.400 
little more promising so if i go and i

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.510 
little more promising so if i go and i
finish<00:01:37.910> that<00:01:38.300> flag<00:01:38.720> then<00:01:39.410> probably<00:01:39.979> it<00:01:40.280> will

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
finish that flag then probably it will

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:48.450 
finish that flag then probably it will
give<00:01:40.880> us<00:01:41.210> the<00:01:41.630> you've<00:01:41.960> in<00:01:42.290> text

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:48.460 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:54.940 

oh<00:01:50.400> ok<00:01:51.400> so

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.240 

nope<00:01:55.579> that<00:01:56.539> nothing<00:01:57.259> happened

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
nope that nothing happened

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:05.430 
nope that nothing happened
why

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:30.220 

why<00:02:06.070> is<00:02:06.130> nothing<00:02:06.700> happening

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.250 

I<00:02:30.489> don't<00:02:31.489> really<00:02:31.670> know<00:02:31.879> but<00:02:32.120> I<00:02:32.450> were<00:02:32.810> right<00:02:33.050> out

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
I don't really know but I were right out

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.339 
I don't really know but I were right out
of<00:02:33.290> the<00:02:33.500> finished<00:02:33.860> coordinates<00:02:34.569> FTD<00:02:35.569> couch

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:36.349 
of the finished coordinates FTD couch

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:43.140 
of the finished coordinates FTD couch
and<00:02:37.120> I<00:02:38.120> just<00:02:38.390> write<00:02:38.690> out<00:02:38.930> the<00:02:39.230> finish<00:02:39.890> x<00:02:40.870> and

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
and I just write out the finish x and

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:52.640 
and I just write out the finish x and
the<00:02:44.150> finish<00:02:44.599> why

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:03:10.540 

okay<00:02:53.959> right

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:13.500 

oh<00:03:10.610> I<00:03:11.360> think<00:03:11.540> I<00:03:11.990> know<00:03:12.050> what<00:03:12.410> the<00:03:12.530> problem<00:03:12.560> is

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
oh I think I know what the problem is

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.420 
oh I think I know what the problem is
the<00:03:14.510> relative<00:03:14.990> episodes<00:03:15.530> coordinate<00:03:16.220> as

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
the relative episodes coordinate as

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.660 
the relative episodes coordinate as
always<00:03:17.090> so<00:03:18.050> in<00:03:18.320> here<00:03:18.650> we<00:03:18.680> don't<00:03:18.890> have<00:03:19.250> to<00:03:19.430> check

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
always so in here we don't have to check

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.290 
always so in here we don't have to check
the<00:03:19.880> finish<00:03:20.300> I<00:03:20.480> make<00:03:20.840> a<00:03:20.870> new<00:03:21.020> rectangle<00:03:22.300> called

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:23.300 
the finish I make a new rectangle called

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:27.610 
the finish I make a new rectangle called
it<00:03:23.740> the<00:03:24.740> erect<00:03:25.220> TMP<00:03:26.120> wreck<00:03:26.390> I<00:03:26.720> hope<00:03:27.170> it's<00:03:27.380> not

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
it the erect TMP wreck I hope it's not

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:36.100 
it the erect TMP wreck I hope it's not
reserved<00:03:28.130> already<00:03:28.370> and<00:03:29.020> make<00:03:30.020> it<00:03:33.640> and<00:03:35.080> make<00:03:36.080> it

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:36.110 
reserved already and make it and make it

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:45.030 
reserved already and make it and make it
finish<00:03:37.100> finish<00:03:38.740> the<00:03:40.090> ex-<00:03:41.440> called<00:03:42.440> dot<00:03:42.950> X<00:03:43.370> and

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
finish finish the ex- called dot X and

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:50.740 
finish finish the ex- called dot X and
finish<00:03:46.040> but<00:03:46.760> why<00:03:47.180> and<00:03:47.570> fifty<00:03:48.380> fifty<00:03:49.420> that's<00:03:50.420> it

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
finish but why and fifty fifty that's it

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.520 
finish but why and fifty fifty that's it
and<00:03:50.990> we<00:03:51.290> have<00:03:51.470> to<00:03:51.680> check<00:03:52.010> two<00:03:52.330> for<00:03:53.330> this<00:03:53.570> so<00:03:53.840> TMP

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
and we have to check two for this so TMP

00:03:54.530 --> 00:04:01.990 
and we have to check two for this so TMP
wrecked<00:03:55.540> and<00:03:58.180> now

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:24.550 

it<00:04:02.510> should<00:04:02.840> work<00:04:03.020> now

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:32.890 

it<00:04:25.070> does<00:04:25.460> all<00:04:26.270> right<00:04:27.200> and<00:04:27.919> I<00:04:31.480> think<00:04:32.480> that's

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:32.900 
it does all right and I think that's

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:36.220 
it does all right and I think that's
about<00:04:33.230> it<00:04:33.410> you<00:04:34.190> can<00:04:34.400> do<00:04:34.610> most<00:04:34.940> you<00:04:35.600> can<00:04:35.810> do<00:04:35.960> more

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:36.230 
about it you can do most you can do more

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:39.220 
about it you can do most you can do more
things<00:04:36.260> like<00:04:37.250> in<00:04:37.610> the<00:04:37.880> original<00:04:38.000> game<00:04:38.450> I<00:04:38.870> did

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:39.230 
things like in the original game I did

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:44.230 
things like in the original game I did
things<00:04:39.590> like<00:04:39.970> open<00:04:42.010> to<00:04:43.010> open<00:04:43.040> a<00:04:43.460> file<00:04:43.700> game

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 
things like open to open a file game

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.530 
things like open to open a file game
though<00:04:44.480> that<00:04:44.750> and<00:04:45.110> load<00:04:45.919> the<00:04:46.250> maps<00:04:46.550> from<00:04:46.940> there

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:47.540 
though that and load the maps from there

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:50.740 
though that and load the maps from there
and<00:04:47.870> if<00:04:48.139> there<00:04:48.320> are<00:04:48.350> more<00:04:48.710> maps<00:04:49.010> than<00:04:49.389> low<00:04:50.389> dose

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:50.750 
and if there are more maps than low dose

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:57.670 
and if there are more maps than low dose
if<00:04:51.080> I<00:04:51.260> finish<00:04:51.560> it<00:04:52.160> and<00:04:55.210> so<00:04:56.210> yeah<00:04:56.720> that's<00:04:57.350> easy

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680 
if I finish it and so yeah that's easy

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:03.219 
if I finish it and so yeah that's easy
so<00:05:00.220> most<00:05:01.220> of<00:05:01.370> the<00:05:01.430> program<00:05:02.000> is<00:05:02.210> ready<00:05:02.540> although

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:03.229 
so most of the program is ready although

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:06.490 
so most of the program is ready although
I<00:05:03.260> am<00:05:03.380> not<00:05:03.470> quite<00:05:04.190> satisfied<00:05:04.550> with<00:05:05.060> the<00:05:06.020> result

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:06.500 
I am not quite satisfied with the result

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:09.879 
I am not quite satisfied with the result
of<00:05:06.710> this<00:05:06.889> tutorial<00:05:07.100> I<00:05:07.729> think<00:05:08.660> I<00:05:08.870> saw<00:05:09.320> that<00:05:09.620> it

00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:09.889 
of this tutorial I think I saw that it

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:13.810 
of this tutorial I think I saw that it
will<00:05:10.100> be<00:05:10.130> quite<00:05:10.669> easier<00:05:11.270> tutorial<00:05:11.930> and<00:05:12.820> after

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:13.820 
will be quite easier tutorial and after

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:17.980 
will be quite easier tutorial and after
i<00:05:13.850> get<00:05:14.479> into<00:05:14.720> the<00:05:16.330> explanations<00:05:17.330> and<00:05:17.510> things

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:17.990 
i get into the explanations and things

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:21.010 
i get into the explanations and things
it<00:05:18.290> turned<00:05:19.040> out<00:05:19.190> that<00:05:19.340> it<00:05:19.880> quite<00:05:20.630> hard

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:21.020 
it turned out that it quite hard

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:24.790 
it turned out that it quite hard
actually<00:05:21.470> it's<00:05:21.919> a<00:05:22.100> little<00:05:22.460> more<00:05:23.200> difficult<00:05:24.200> a

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:24.800 
actually it's a little more difficult a

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:28.060 
actually it's a little more difficult a
tutorial<00:05:25.520> than<00:05:26.030> i<00:05:26.240> originally<00:05:26.600> planned<00:05:27.530> there

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:28.070 
tutorial than i originally planned there

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:30.850 
tutorial than i originally planned there
are<00:05:28.190> a<00:05:28.250> lot<00:05:28.490> of<00:05:28.520> confusing<00:05:29.210> things<00:05:29.750> like<00:05:30.229> this

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:30.860 
are a lot of confusing things like this

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:33.190 
are a lot of confusing things like this
absolute<00:05:31.490> and<00:05:31.729> relative<00:05:31.910> coordinate<00:05:32.810> i'm<00:05:32.960> not

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:33.200 
absolute and relative coordinate i'm not

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:36.040 
absolute and relative coordinate i'm not
sure<00:05:33.500> that<00:05:33.770> do<00:05:34.550> you<00:05:34.640> get<00:05:34.910> it<00:05:34.940> or<00:05:35.270> not<00:05:35.300> sometimes

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:36.050 
sure that do you get it or not sometimes

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:39.310 
sure that do you get it or not sometimes
I<00:05:36.260> don't<00:05:36.320> even<00:05:36.650> get<00:05:37.010> it<00:05:37.220> as<00:05:37.729> you<00:05:37.970> can<00:05:38.120> see<00:05:38.390> I<00:05:38.419> in

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:39.320 
I don't even get it as you can see I in

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:42.520 
I don't even get it as you can see I in
here<00:05:39.770> even<00:05:40.250> in<00:05:40.430> the<00:05:40.550> last<00:05:40.789> thing<00:05:41.300> I<00:05:41.570> screw<00:05:42.500> up

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:42.530 
here even in the last thing I screw up

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:48.190 
here even in the last thing I screw up
because<00:05:43.100> of<00:05:43.280> those<00:05:43.570> coordinates<00:05:44.570> and<00:05:47.020> let<00:05:48.020> me

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:48.200 
because of those coordinates and let me

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.500 
because of those coordinates and let me
think<00:05:48.410> so<00:05:48.919> if<00:05:49.160> you<00:05:49.430> do<00:05:49.610> not<00:05:49.760> understand

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:50.510 
think so if you do not understand

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:56.320 
think so if you do not understand
something<00:05:51.080> than<00:05:51.470> just<00:05:52.310> a<00:05:54.610> command<00:05:55.610> or<00:05:55.850> write<00:05:56.300> a

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:56.330 
something than just a command or write a

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:58.930 
something than just a command or write a
private<00:05:56.930> message<00:05:57.139> or<00:05:57.440> something<00:05:57.710> and<00:05:58.310> I<00:05:58.610> try

00:05:58.930 --> 00:05:58.940 
private message or something and I try

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:01.990 
private message or something and I try
to<00:05:58.970> explain<00:05:59.510> the<00:05:59.720> port<00:06:00.020> that<00:06:00.440> to<00:06:00.770> attend<00:06:01.370> that

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:02.000 
to explain the port that to attend that

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:08.020 
to explain the port that to attend that
you<00:06:02.690> don't<00:06:03.050> understand<00:06:04.750> okay<00:06:06.070> I<00:06:07.070> think<00:06:07.820> the

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:08.030 
you don't understand okay I think the

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:12.400 
you don't understand okay I think the
game<00:06:08.479> is<00:06:08.510> a<00:06:08.720> quite<00:06:09.229> good<00:06:10.220> shelf<00:06:10.760> for<00:06:11.410> more

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:12.410 
game is a quite good shelf for more

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:14.680 
game is a quite good shelf for more
difficult<00:06:13.250> or<00:06:13.460> something<00:06:14.090> a<00:06:14.210> more<00:06:14.450> better

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:14.690 
difficult or something a more better

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:17.440 
difficult or something a more better
game<00:06:15.169> it<00:06:15.680> but<00:06:16.100> it's<00:06:16.310> actually<00:06:16.490> just<00:06:16.970> a<00:06:17.150> shell

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:17.450 
game it but it's actually just a shell

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:20.560 
game it but it's actually just a shell
itself<00:06:18.260> almost<00:06:18.650> nothing<00:06:19.130> more<00:06:19.610> we<00:06:20.150> have<00:06:20.300> some

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:20.570 
itself almost nothing more we have some

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:24.520 
itself almost nothing more we have some
basic<00:06:21.020> animations<00:06:21.950> and<00:06:22.430> things<00:06:23.000> like<00:06:23.240> that<00:06:23.530> so

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:24.530 
basic animations and things like that so

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:28.000 
basic animations and things like that so
really<00:06:24.979> not<00:06:25.310> so<00:06:26.150> great<00:06:26.660> game<00:06:27.020> it<00:06:27.289> was<00:06:27.530> actually

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:28.010 
really not so great game it was actually

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:31.210 
really not so great game it was actually
just<00:06:28.190> a<00:06:28.340> practice<00:06:28.820> an<00:06:28.970> example<00:06:29.570> program<00:06:30.220> okay

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:31.220 
just a practice an example program okay

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:34.089 
just a practice an example program okay
and<00:06:31.490> I<00:06:31.789> know<00:06:31.850> my<00:06:32.270> stab<00:06:32.599> that<00:06:32.810> I<00:06:33.020> make<00:06:33.710> a<00:06:33.740> lot<00:06:34.039> of

00:06:34.089 --> 00:06:34.099 
and I know my stab that I make a lot of

00:06:34.099 --> 00:06:36.250 
and I know my stab that I make a lot of
mistakes<00:06:34.520> through<00:06:35.210> the<00:06:35.450> program

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:36.260 
mistakes through the program

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.250 
mistakes through the program
and<00:06:36.790> probably<00:06:37.790> there<00:06:38.210> are<00:06:38.330> a<00:06:38.540> lot<00:06:38.810> of<00:06:38.840> mistakes

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:39.260 
and probably there are a lot of mistakes

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:42.780 
and probably there are a lot of mistakes
in<00:06:39.860> it<00:06:40.160> like<00:06:40.730> I<00:06:41.030> haven't<00:06:41.330> deleted<00:06:41.780> the<00:06:42.170> player

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:42.790 
in it like I haven't deleted the player

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:48.880 
in it like I haven't deleted the player
so<00:06:43.790> delete<00:06:44.560> layer<00:06:45.560> 1<00:06:46.600> okay<00:06:47.650> because<00:06:48.650> we

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:48.890 
so delete layer 1 okay because we

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:53.610 
so delete layer 1 okay because we
reserved<00:06:49.340> it<00:06:50.020> with<00:06:51.020> new<00:06:51.440> I<00:06:51.710> have<00:06:52.130> to<00:06:52.370> delete<00:06:52.700> it

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:53.620 
reserved it with new I have to delete it

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:58.150 
reserved it with new I have to delete it
manually<00:06:54.620> delete<00:06:55.130> okay<00:06:56.000> and<00:06:56.240> I<00:06:57.010> forget<00:06:58.010> the

00:06:58.150 --> 00:06:58.160 
manually delete okay and I forget the

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.400 
manually delete okay and I forget the
sdl<00:06:58.700> in<00:06:58.940> it<00:06:59.060> which<00:06:59.270> actually<00:06:59.510> the<00:06:59.840> first<00:07:00.050> thing

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:00.410 
sdl in it which actually the first thing

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:02.350 
sdl in it which actually the first thing
we<00:07:00.590> should<00:07:00.620> call<00:07:01.130> whenever<00:07:01.610> we<00:07:01.850> initialize

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:02.360 
we should call whenever we initialize

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:04.750 
we should call whenever we initialize
the<00:07:02.540> SDA<00:07:02.990> I<00:07:03.290> don't<00:07:03.920> know<00:07:04.040> how<00:07:04.280> is<00:07:04.550> that

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:04.760 
the SDA I don't know how is that

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:07.210 
the SDA I don't know how is that
possible<00:07:05.330> that<00:07:05.540> it's<00:07:05.780> worked<00:07:06.170> but<00:07:06.650> it's<00:07:06.920> worth

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:07.220 
possible that it's worked but it's worth

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:13.090 
possible that it's worked but it's worth
without<00:07:07.490> it<00:07:09.460> yeah<00:07:10.480> so<00:07:11.480> sorry<00:07:11.990> about<00:07:12.230> that<00:07:12.260> this

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:13.100 
without it yeah so sorry about that this

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:15.430 
without it yeah so sorry about that this
should<00:07:13.310> be<00:07:13.460> an<00:07:13.550> SD<00:07:13.880> l<00:07:14.000> tutorial<00:07:14.570> and<00:07:14.780> I<00:07:14.960> forget

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:15.440 
should be an SD l tutorial and I forget

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:17.950 
should be an SD l tutorial and I forget
the<00:07:15.560> first<00:07:15.830> thing<00:07:16.100> about<00:07:16.130> that<00:07:16.640> deal<00:07:16.960> it

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:17.960 
the first thing about that deal it

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:23.500 
the first thing about that deal it
happens<00:07:19.780> ok<00:07:20.780> I<00:07:20.810> just<00:07:21.010> I<00:07:22.010> just<00:07:22.580> saw<00:07:23.060> it<00:07:23.270> that

happens ok I just I just saw it that
there<00:07:23.900> is<00:07:24.020> no<00:07:24.200> FDL<00:07:24.800> in<00:07:25.070> it<00:07:25.280> in<00:07:25.760> here<00:07:28.780> the

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:29.780 
there is no FDL in it in here the

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:31.810 
there is no FDL in it in here the
original<00:07:30.260> thoughts<00:07:30.560> would<00:07:30.860> help<00:07:31.250> these

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:31.820 
original thoughts would help these

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:34.420 
original thoughts would help these
things<00:07:32.420> but<00:07:32.960> I<00:07:33.020> don't<00:07:33.290> copy<00:07:33.620> that<00:07:33.890> source<00:07:34.190> code

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:34.430 
things but I don't copy that source code

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:36.910
