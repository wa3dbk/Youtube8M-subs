00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.160 
as well but yeah quickly want to show
you<00:00:38.010> and<00:00:38.370> it<00:00:38.850> worked<00:00:39.090> before<00:00:39.300> you<00:00:39.840> could<00:00:39.989> use

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
you and it worked before you could use

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.470 
you and it worked before you could use
the<00:00:40.410> old<00:00:40.530> saplings<00:00:41.129> for<00:00:41.399> that<00:00:41.579> but<00:00:42.120> it<00:00:42.300> was

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
the old saplings for that but it was

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.630 
the old saplings for that but it was
nerfed<00:00:42.780> pretty<00:00:42.960> quickly<00:00:43.469> so<00:00:44.129> what<00:00:44.309> you<00:00:44.430> do<00:00:44.610> you

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
nerfed pretty quickly so what you do you

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.060 
nerfed pretty quickly so what you do you
plant<00:00:45.090> a<00:00:45.239> tree<00:00:45.510> just<00:00:46.020> like<00:00:46.140> that<00:00:46.500> and<00:00:46.770> then<00:00:46.950> you

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
plant a tree just like that and then you

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.700 
plant a tree just like that and then you
knock<00:00:47.280> out<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.730> lowest<00:00:48.059> row<00:00:48.360> off<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:49.440> tree

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
knock out the lowest row off the tree

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.189 
knock out the lowest row off the tree
and<00:00:49.950> then<00:00:50.670> you<00:00:50.700> put<00:00:51.000> more<00:00:51.300> saplings<00:00:51.750> in<00:00:51.960> and

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
and then you put more saplings in and

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.470 
and then you put more saplings in and
these<00:00:52.379> trees<00:00:52.980> actually<00:00:53.219> have<00:00:53.699> a<00:00:53.730> chance<00:00:54.180> to

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
these trees actually have a chance to

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.010 
these trees actually have a chance to
kind<00:00:55.230> of<00:00:55.320> grow<00:00:55.739> downwards<00:00:56.670> and<00:00:57.000> by<00:00:57.360> doing<00:00:57.719> it

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
kind of grow downwards and by doing it

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.410 
kind of grow downwards and by doing it
like<00:00:58.379> this<00:00:58.590> yeah<00:00:59.370> you<00:00:59.460> have<00:00:59.640> to<00:00:59.760> try<00:01:00.000> a<00:01:00.270> few

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
like this yeah you have to try a few

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.420 
like this yeah you have to try a few
times<00:01:00.660> and<00:01:01.199> eventually<00:01:01.469> something<00:01:01.980> like<00:01:02.219> that

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
times and eventually something like that

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.240 
times and eventually something like that
will<00:01:02.640> happen<00:01:02.820> here<00:01:03.210> you<00:01:03.840> go<00:01:04.140> and<00:01:04.409> you<00:01:04.559> see<00:01:04.799> at

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
will happen here you go and you see at

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.649 
will happen here you go and you see at
some<00:01:05.790> spots<00:01:06.180> right<00:01:07.140> there<00:01:07.970> right<00:01:08.970> there<00:01:09.299> right

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
some spots right there right there right

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.880 
some spots right there right there right
there<00:01:10.580> the<00:01:11.580> tree<00:01:11.850> kind<00:01:12.600> of<00:01:12.780> crew<00:01:12.960> downward<00:01:13.560> and

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
there the tree kind of crew downward and

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.969 
there the tree kind of crew downward and
yeah<00:01:14.340> replace<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:15.450> bedrock<00:01:15.930> and<00:01:16.110> now<00:01:16.590> all<00:01:16.830> you

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
have to do is cut out all of the tree

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.230 
have to do is cut out all of the tree
and<00:01:19.170> move<00:01:19.470> it<00:01:19.680> over<00:01:19.799> a<00:01:20.009> little<00:01:20.100> bit<00:01:20.369> and<00:01:20.759> keep

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
make it better bigger by pushing the

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.330 
make it better bigger by pushing the
tree<00:01:30.750> around<00:01:31.020> and<00:01:31.350> using<00:01:31.650> it<00:01:31.770> at<00:01:31.950> different

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
tree around and using it at different

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.130 
tree around and using it at different
spots<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:32.820> yeah<00:01:33.150> this<00:01:33.659> is<00:01:33.750> how<00:01:33.840> you<00:01:33.900> break

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
spots and yeah this is how you break

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.319 
spots and yeah this is how you break
bedrock<00:01:34.619> you<00:01:35.159> kind<00:01:35.430> of<00:01:35.490> wanted<00:01:35.820> to<00:01:35.939> keep<00:01:36.150> it

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
bedrock you kind of wanted to keep it

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.780 
bedrock you kind of wanted to keep it
secret<00:01:36.540> within<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.619> snapshot<00:01:38.100> so<00:01:38.310> it<00:01:38.400> doesn't

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
secret within the snapshot so it doesn't

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.330 
secret within the snapshot so it doesn't
get<00:01:38.939> fixed<00:01:39.180> now<00:01:39.570> is<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:40.020> full<00:01:40.229> release<00:01:40.439> now<00:01:41.280> it

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
get fixed now is the full release now it

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.069 
get fixed now is the full release now it
was<00:01:41.579> on<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:41.880> Minecraft<00:01:42.060> reddit<00:01:42.630> so<00:01:42.780> I<00:01:42.810> guess

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
was on the Minecraft reddit so I guess

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.990 
was on the Minecraft reddit so I guess
you<00:01:43.229> guys<00:01:43.409> should<00:01:43.979> hurry<00:01:44.220> up<00:01:44.399> because<00:01:44.579> last

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
you guys should hurry up because last

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.109 
you guys should hurry up because last
time<00:01:45.409> this<00:01:46.409> was<00:01:46.619> fixed<00:01:46.890> as<00:01:47.189> well<00:01:47.430> but<00:01:47.640> I<00:01:47.700> think
