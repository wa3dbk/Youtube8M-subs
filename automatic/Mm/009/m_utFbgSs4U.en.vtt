another way of attack and the Kraken and
I<00:01:45.450> was<00:01:45.569> doing<00:01:45.749> pretty<00:01:45.779> well<00:01:45.929> or<00:01:46.319> at<00:01:46.469> least<00:01:46.619> I

00:01:46.669 --> 00:01:46.679 
I was doing pretty well or at least I

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:48.949 
I was doing pretty well or at least I
thought<00:01:46.829> so<00:01:46.889> so<00:01:47.189> I<00:01:47.340> quit<00:01:47.669> it's<00:01:48.240> time<00:01:48.569> for<00:01:48.869> the

00:01:48.949 --> 00:01:48.959 
thought so so I quit it's time for the

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:51.080 
thought so so I quit it's time for the
big<00:01:49.259> leagues<00:01:49.590> before<00:01:50.219> I<00:01:50.399> move<00:01:50.639> on<00:01:50.759> let<00:01:50.999> me

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
big leagues before I move on let me

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.800 
big leagues before I move on let me
explain<00:01:51.359> the<00:01:51.509> rules

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
explain the rules

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.959 
explain the rules
normal<00:01:52.409> massive<00:01:52.829> orangutan<00:01:53.279> but<00:01:53.399> aroma<00:01:53.759> games

00:01:53.959 --> 00:01:53.969 
normal massive orangutan but aroma games

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:55.399 
normal massive orangutan but aroma games
are<00:01:54.179> a<00:01:54.240> battle<00:01:54.569> to<00:01:54.659> get<00:01:54.749> to<00:01:54.840> your<00:01:54.929> enemy's<00:01:55.229> base

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
are a battle to get to your enemy's base

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.289 
are a battle to get to your enemy's base
through<00:01:55.679> one<00:01:55.829> of<00:01:55.859> three<00:01:56.130> lanes<00:01:56.369> each<00:01:56.880> side<00:01:57.149> has

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
through one of three lanes each side has

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.789 
through one of three lanes each side has
a<00:01:57.329> tower<00:01:57.539> here<00:01:57.899> a<00:01:57.929> Phoenix<00:01:58.349> here<00:01:58.560> and<00:01:58.739> a

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
a tower here a Phoenix here and a

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.229 
a tower here a Phoenix here and a
Minotaur<00:01:59.159> at<00:01:59.249> the<00:01:59.369> end<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.819> first<00:02:00.029> team<00:02:00.209> to

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:00.239 
Minotaur at the end the first team to

00:02:00.239 --> 00:02:01.819 
Minotaur at the end the first team to
defeat<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.599> enemies<00:02:00.899> Minotaur<00:02:01.259> wins

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
defeat the enemies Minotaur wins

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.409 
defeat the enemies Minotaur wins
so<00:02:01.950> attack<00:02:02.219> is<00:02:02.459> just<00:02:02.489> as<00:02:02.849> important<00:02:03.270> as

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:03.419 
so attack is just as important as

00:02:03.419 --> 00:02:05.149 
so attack is just as important as
defense<00:02:03.749> and<00:02:04.049> since<00:02:04.289> each<00:02:04.409> game<00:02:04.739> is<00:02:04.950> three

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
defense and since each game is three

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.649 
defense and since each game is three
versus<00:02:05.399> three<00:02:05.459> you<00:02:05.909> might<00:02:06.029> have<00:02:06.209> no<00:02:06.389> one<00:02:06.509> else

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
versus three you might have no one else

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:07.879 
versus three you might have no one else
to<00:02:06.810> back<00:02:06.959> you<00:02:07.079> up<00:02:07.109> in<00:02:07.380> defending<00:02:07.619> or<00:02:07.859> attacking

00:02:07.879 --> 00:02:07.889 
to back you up in defending or attacking

00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:09.770 
to back you up in defending or attacking
your<00:02:08.429> Lane<00:02:08.610> seeing<00:02:09.060> as<00:02:09.210> I'm<00:02:09.330> still<00:02:09.600> new<00:02:09.750> to

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
your Lane seeing as I'm still new to

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.450 
your Lane seeing as I'm still new to
this<00:02:09.960> game<00:02:10.140> I<00:02:10.290> figured<00:02:10.560> I<00:02:10.619> would<00:02:10.649> not<00:02:11.100> screw

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460 
this game I figured I would not screw

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:12.950 
this game I figured I would not screw
over<00:02:11.580> my<00:02:11.700> team<00:02:12.000> by<00:02:12.150> jumping<00:02:12.510> into<00:02:12.630> this<00:02:12.780> game

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
over my team by jumping into this game

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.510 
over my team by jumping into this game
type<00:02:13.200> and<00:02:13.380> stuck<00:02:13.590> to<00:02:13.710> something<00:02:13.890> easier

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
type and stuck to something easier

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.220 
type and stuck to something easier
so<00:02:14.610> I<00:02:14.670> went<00:02:14.850> with<00:02:14.940> the<00:02:15.090> one-lane<00:02:15.540> variant<00:02:15.990> this

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
so I went with the one-lane variant this

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.200 
so I went with the one-lane variant this
time<00:02:16.470> I<00:02:16.650> went<00:02:16.830> with<00:02:16.950> Artemis<00:02:17.400> a<00:02:17.550> bow<00:02:17.820> wildung

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
time I went with Artemis a bow wildung

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:19.670 
time I went with Artemis a bow wildung

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
death machine and by death machine I

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.010 
death machine and by death machine I
mean<00:02:19.920> I<00:02:20.040> got<00:02:20.280> killed<00:02:20.580> a<00:02:20.730> lot<00:02:21.090> she<00:02:21.690> does<00:02:21.840> have

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020

and<00:03:18.690> just<00:03:18.990> as<00:03:19.110> I<00:03:19.230> was<00:03:19.350> starting<00:03:19.410> to<00:03:19.680> feel<00:03:19.800> like

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
and just as I was starting to feel like

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.530 
and just as I was starting to feel like
I<00:03:20.040> was<00:03:20.190> pretty<00:03:20.430> decent<00:03:20.760> of<00:03:20.820> smite<00:03:21.030> Hercules

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
I was pretty decent of smite Hercules

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.660 
I was pretty decent of smite Hercules
reminded<00:03:21.900> me<00:03:21.959> that<00:03:21.990> I<00:03:22.170> flat-out<00:03:22.500> suck<00:03:23.130> sure<00:03:23.640> I

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
reminded me that I flat-out suck sure I

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.220

killed<00:03:24.120> a<00:03:24.180> few<00:03:24.300> enemies<00:03:24.630> here<00:03:24.810> and<00:03:24.900> there<00:03:25.050> but

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
killed a few enemies here and there but

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:26.990 
killed a few enemies here and there but
that<00:03:25.350> didn't<00:03:25.590> stop<00:03:25.650> me<00:03:25.860> from<00:03:26.010> dying<00:03:26.280> a<00:03:26.640> ton

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
that didn't stop me from dying a ton

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.370 
that didn't stop me from dying a ton
maybe<00:03:27.540> it's<00:03:27.690> just<00:03:27.750> because<00:03:27.900> I<00:03:28.080> didn't<00:03:28.290> like

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
maybe it's just because I didn't like

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.199 
maybe it's just because I didn't like
Hercules<00:03:28.650> I<00:03:29.280> would<00:03:29.520> love<00:03:29.700> to<00:03:29.820> know<00:03:29.970> how<00:03:30.180> a
