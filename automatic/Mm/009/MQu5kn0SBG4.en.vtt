00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.410 

pretty<00:01:45.100> straightforward<00:01:45.460> picking<00:01:46.120> pattern

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
pretty straightforward picking pattern

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.870

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:50.110 
those boards C D minor a minor so it's
there's<00:05:31.690> two<00:05:32.110> beats<00:05:32.740> per<00:05:33.100> quart<00:05:33.430> slow<00:05:33.790> for

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:50.120 

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:55.420 

so<00:05:50.960> again<00:05:51.169> C<00:05:51.530> D<00:05:52.040> minor<00:05:52.310> a<00:05:52.639> minor<00:05:52.880> G<00:05:53.139> C<00:05:54.139> D<00:05:54.470> minor<00:05:55.040> F

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:55.430 
so again C D minor a minor G C D minor F

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:58.420 
so again C D minor a minor G C D minor F
and<00:05:56.150> G<00:05:56.330> that's<00:05:57.050> the<00:05:57.199> verse<00:05:57.500> chord<00:05:57.980> progression

00:05:58.420 --> 00:05:58.430 
and G that's the verse chord progression

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:00.700 
and G that's the verse chord progression
that's<00:05:58.580> what<00:05:58.729> I<00:05:58.760> just<00:05:58.850> was<00:05:59.810> playing<00:05:59.840> for<00:06:00.500> you

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:03.189 
that's what I just was playing for you

00:06:03.189 --> 00:06:03.199 
again the tabs are in the description if

00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:04.330 
again the tabs are in the description if
you<00:06:03.380> want<00:06:03.560> to<00:06:03.620> check<00:06:03.770> out<00:06:03.949> all<00:06:04.160> those

you want to check out all those
arpeggios<00:06:05.030> I'm<00:06:05.180> not<00:06:05.330> going<00:06:05.449> to<00:06:05.510> do<00:06:05.690> the<00:06:05.840> other

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:05.960 
arpeggios I'm not going to do the other

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:07.330 
arpeggios I'm not going to do the other
arpeggios<00:06:06.560> in<00:06:06.590> this<00:06:06.830> song<00:06:07.010> because<00:06:07.220> I

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:07.340 
arpeggios in this song because I

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:09.550 
arpeggios in this song because I
couldn't<00:06:07.610> hear<00:06:07.790> it<00:06:07.850> as<00:06:08.660> well<00:06:08.990> as<00:06:09.139> I<00:06:09.290> could

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:09.560 
couldn't hear it as well as I could

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:11.439 
couldn't hear it as well as I could
because<00:06:10.400> there<00:06:10.699> was<00:06:10.790> tons<00:06:11.000> of<00:06:11.180> things

00:06:11.439 --> 00:06:11.449 
because there was tons of things

00:06:11.449 --> 00:06:13.450 
because there was tons of things
happening<00:06:11.930> in<00:06:12.020> the<00:06:12.139> production<00:06:12.470> blah<00:06:13.280> blah

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:13.460 
happening in the production blah blah

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:17.020 
happening in the production blah blah
blah<00:06:13.699> so<00:06:14.800> again<00:06:15.800> that's<00:06:15.919> how<00:06:16.040> the<00:06:16.100> pre<00:06:16.520> excuse

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:17.030 
blah so again that's how the pre excuse

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:19.240 
blah so again that's how the pre excuse
me<00:06:17.150> D<00:06:17.300> versus<00:06:17.840> go<00:06:18.050> now<00:06:18.260> on<00:06:18.470> to<00:06:18.620> the<00:06:18.710> pre-chorus

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:19.250 
me D versus go now on to the pre-chorus

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:28.270 
me D versus go now on to the pre-chorus
and<00:06:19.550> that's<00:06:19.669> gonna<00:06:19.820> be<00:06:20.060> a<00:06:20.710> minor<00:06:21.710> -<00:06:27.010> like<00:06:28.010> that

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:28.280 
and that's gonna be a minor - like that

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:38.400 
and that's gonna be a minor - like that
just<00:06:29.180> two<00:06:29.479> chords<00:06:29.870> one<00:06:30.380> chord<00:06:31.340> for<00:06:31.729> a<00:06:31.760> measure

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:38.410 

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:48.070 

then<00:06:39.410> we're<00:06:39.650> on<00:06:39.860> to<00:06:40.660> our<00:06:41.770> chorus<00:06:42.770> which<00:06:43.039> is

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:48.080 

00:06:48.080 --> 00:07:02.830 

a<00:06:48.139> minor<00:06:49.509> G<00:06:51.340> C<00:06:52.340> D<00:06:53.620> minor<00:07:00.759> G<00:07:01.759> minor<00:07:01.789> this<00:07:02.509> time

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:02.840 
a minor G C D minor G minor this time

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:13.340 
a minor G C D minor G minor this time
it's<00:07:03.110> F

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:13.350 

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:16.170 

so<00:07:14.350> that's<00:07:14.530> the<00:07:14.770> chorus<00:07:15.370> chord<00:07:15.670> progression

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:16.180 
so that's the chorus chord progression

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:19.950 
so that's the chorus chord progression
our<00:07:16.360> sieve<00:07:16.630> D<00:07:16.840> minor<00:07:17.110> a<00:07:17.320> minor<00:07:17.500> G<00:07:17.790> twice<00:07:18.790> C<00:07:19.660> D

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:19.960 
our sieve D minor a minor G twice C D

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:23.520 
our sieve D minor a minor G twice C D
minor<00:07:20.200> F<00:07:20.560> G<00:07:21.100> once<00:07:21.490> back<00:07:21.850> to<00:07:22.090> C<00:07:22.360> D<00:07:22.660> minor<00:07:22.930> a<00:07:23.260> minor

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:23.530 
minor F G once back to C D minor a minor

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:28.260 
minor F G once back to C D minor a minor
G<00:07:25.200> so<00:07:26.200> that's<00:07:26.410> the<00:07:26.710> chorus<00:07:27.250> you<00:07:27.280> go<00:07:27.700> back<00:07:28.000> and

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:28.270 
G so that's the chorus you go back and

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:30.630 
G so that's the chorus you go back and
play<00:07:28.540> the<00:07:28.570> verse<00:07:29.020> after<00:07:29.530> that<00:07:30.100> play<00:07:30.490> the

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:30.640 
play the verse after that play the

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:32.520 
play the verse after that play the
pre-chorus<00:07:31.120> after<00:07:31.630> that<00:07:31.810> play<00:07:32.110> the<00:07:32.290> chorus

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:32.530 
pre-chorus after that play the chorus

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:35.130 
pre-chorus after that play the chorus
after<00:07:32.800> that<00:07:33.340> and<00:07:34.090> that's<00:07:34.330> the<00:07:34.570> song<00:07:34.810> very

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:35.140 
after that and that's the song very

00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:39.300 
after that and that's the song very
basic<00:07:35.650> ABC<00:07:36.430> kind<00:07:36.910> of<00:07:37.060> thing<00:07:37.360> for<00:07:38.230> this<00:07:38.380> one

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:39.310 
basic ABC kind of thing for this one

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:42.030 
basic ABC kind of thing for this one
so<00:07:40.180> one<00:07:40.450> last<00:07:40.720> time<00:07:41.050> these<00:07:41.260> arpeggios<00:07:41.889> we'll

00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:42.040 
so one last time these arpeggios we'll

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:45.270 
so one last time these arpeggios we'll
play<00:07:42.190> it<00:07:42.310> play<00:07:42.940> it<00:07:42.970> all<00:07:43.090> together
