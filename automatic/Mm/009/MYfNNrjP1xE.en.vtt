00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 well, this is not to be missed 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.910
 because you already know the reference that says 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.049
 it is better to prevent than to cure truth 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.769
 if with us we have in our 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:12.480
 therapist of natural truth doña lola 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.549
 Spending face to start doing well and 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.130
 because today we are going to talk we will 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:20.189
 give the mushrooms truth because we are not going 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.830
 to the pool to the beach and it's very easy 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.600
 get contagious and if we get contagious and we 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.849
 infected with a fungus up to one year 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.400
 we can have it with truth already if it is 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.240
 we have three formulas like that one that is 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.140
 prevention 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.840
 tell us ok is something very simple for 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.030
 the people at home who can in the in 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.649
 the car when they go for the ride and all 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.190
 this question now of holy week 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:47.129
 white vinegar with water makes a 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.660
 solution so you wear it you put it before and 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.989
 after he goes to sit in a pool 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:55.649
 that you are going to walk is there in some 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:01:00.150
 this event where maybe there are shoes 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:03.540
 very closed because it can be mountain 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:05.070
 and all that then to help all 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:08.220
 those things also proliferate 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:11.460
 then this is very simple half 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:15.060
 of like a little bottle of this half 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.770
 of half white vinegar and the other 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.210
 half of water and there they have the solution 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:23.940
 simple and with that and how we apply it 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:26.970
 we will also throw it in the little fingers 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.890
 we open the little fingers we throw it and then 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.960
 If we are going to put on a shoe, we dry it 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.960
 well because it should always dry very 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.780
 well because he does not dry it well it proliferates 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.150
 wrong the mushrooms then dries well and 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.020
 we already have a prevention and a remedy 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.020
 easy easy 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.800
 it turns out we already have the fungus right 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.830
 that we already have the address that we have 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:52.440
 to cure the infection that we have to 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:57.420
 very simple charge that is 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:02:00.420
 an enamel base this natural enamel 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.460
 shine what we call brightness we're going to 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.450
 do 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:08.200
 have a house and what's in your house 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:11.770
 White iodine 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:15.520
 that every side you can get 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:19.540
 a clove of garlic that also all the 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:21.490
 houses there is a piece of lemon 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:25.510
 I hope Creole that in every little house there 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:27.940
 also and what we are going to do is to 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:31.210
 grind the garlic 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:33.910
 a clove of garlic we will have the 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:35.920
 credit and this we're going to take this 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.860
 is already prepared we are going to take the 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:42.610
 full garlic we are going to take four 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:45.700
 lemon droplets and we're going to throw 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:49.260
 four droplets of white iodine this what 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:52.590
 let's leave for two weeks 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:56.670
 and then we started using it for 15 days 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:58.349
 in the unit that's how we're going to 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.230
 see viana flaunting the light 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:03.610
 let's apply that very simple 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:07.450
 let's apply 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:10.480
 as if you were thinking about the 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:13.180
 uñitas and that's it and that's it and we'll leave it 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.130
 dry and let it dry ok perfect 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.620
 then this is not just going to 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:20.200
 prevent because it also prevents 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.580
 can use for prevention also as 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.830
 we also going to be helping 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:26.280
 eradicate the man very well 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:29.709
 now we have an interesting solution 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:32.050
 so I can take it in the house also 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:34.300
 is the colloidal silver that this serves to 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:36.490
 prevent prevents and also cure and 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:40.570
 besides that the orange is taken and 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:43.030
 also put with the unita and in the 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:45.430
 colloidal silver has this in addition to 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:47.590
 many other properties that you 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:50.020
 you will see later but right now the fungus 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:53.470
 this is great for that every how much 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:57.360
 we take that and the colloidal silver is 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:57.360
 take look here is there one more 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:05.350
 then we take this one measure as 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.120
 a spoonful and as of the elca 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:10.000
 polisario 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:13.840
 you take one in the morning and one in the 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.479
 night for at least three months then 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:19.180
 one month rests and goes back to 

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:21.090
 start again besides that will 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:25.510
 bring many benefits to health 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:27.970
 so many of now of this nature but 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:30.580
 we are talking about this helps that 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:33.070
 the fungus is prevented and also if it is already 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.840
 so that it will heal then the best is 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:38.470
 prevent with something so simple because they have 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:40.110
 added white vinegar and water to not 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:43.930
 have to be for a whole year 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:46.539
 trying to take away that there are two types 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:49.090
 of mushrooms is the man the fungus 

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:51.610
 Dermatophytes and change 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:54.310
 usually the mate or phyto is the one 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:56.430
 it is done in this the feet although the 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:59.410
 mayoralty is what is done in the hand 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:01.030
 then we deal with many different 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:03.280
 types of mushrooms but we also have 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:06.520
 many natural things with which 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:08.020
 we can be radical has been a pleasure 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.750
 have latin with us this hobby of 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:12.099
 8 taste that you all know 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:12.560
 brainer for children so that 

00:05:12.099 --> 00:05:14.750
 feet 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:17.980
 and we leave with vero sure that 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:17.980
 has a lot of constants
