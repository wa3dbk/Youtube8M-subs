mean<00:00:39.899> cold<00:00:40.829> we<00:00:40.950> played<00:00:41.160> hard<00:00:41.660> ha<00:00:42.660> Gasol<00:00:43.050> was

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
mean cold we played hard ha Gasol was

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.100 
mean cold we played hard ha Gasol was
Pau<00:00:43.350> Gasol<00:00:43.739> but<00:00:44.460> they've<00:00:45.180> done<00:00:45.420> they<00:00:45.989> were

Pau Gasol but they've done they were

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.459 
Pau Gasol but they've done they were
swept<00:00:46.410> last<00:00:46.469> year<00:00:46.950> and<00:00:47.300> they<00:00:48.300> lost<00:00:48.510> 4-1<00:00:48.780> this

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
but what fits me the most right now and

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.869 
but what fits me the most right now and
I<00:00:54.480> do<00:00:55.469> say<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.100> word<00:00:56.250> and<00:00:56.430> I<00:00:56.550> use<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.760> word

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
I do say the word and I use the word

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.880 
I do say the word and I use the word
fear<00:00:57.210> in<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.750> right<00:00:57.930> context<00:00:58.530> since<00:00:58.680> those

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
fear in the right context since those

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.459 
fear in the right context since those
Spurs<00:00:59.219> the<00:01:00.149> Spurs<00:01:00.449> are<00:01:00.510> probably<00:01:01.260> what<00:01:01.440> they

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
Spurs the Spurs are probably what they

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.110 
Spurs the Spurs are probably what they
are<00:01:01.620> on<00:01:01.680> an<00:01:01.800> 18<00:01:02.160> 19<00:01:02.219> game<00:01:02.760> winning<00:01:02.969> streak

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
are on an 18 19 game winning streak

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.690 
are on an 18 19 game winning streak
they've<00:01:04.110> looked<00:01:04.680> like<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:05.010> most<00:01:05.220> dominant

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
they've looked like the most dominant

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.060 
they've looked like the most dominant
team<00:01:05.939> in<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.150> playoffs<00:01:06.270> thus<00:01:06.960> far<00:01:07.200> now<00:01:07.830> mind

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
team in the playoffs thus far now mind

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.730 
team in the playoffs thus far now mind
you<00:01:08.310> they'd<00:01:08.549> had<00:01:08.580> played<00:01:09.060> on<00:01:09.299> Utah<00:01:09.990> and<00:01:10.290> on

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
you they'd had played on Utah and on

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.580 
you they'd had played on Utah and on
only<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.750> Clippers<00:01:12.750> and<00:01:13.049> those<00:01:13.200> are<00:01:13.229> not<00:01:13.409> the

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
only the Clippers and those are not the

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.260 
only the Clippers and those are not the
highest<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:14.250> best<00:01:14.460> teams<00:01:14.729> you<00:01:15.000> know<00:01:15.090> I<00:01:15.119> think

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
highest the best teams you know I think

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.210 
highest the best teams you know I think
OKC's<00:01:16.080> road<00:01:16.290> was<00:01:16.530> way<00:01:16.680> hard<00:01:16.979> to<00:01:17.070> go<00:01:17.189> through

could<00:01:26.040> have<00:01:26.130> that<00:01:26.520> series<00:01:26.820> could<00:01:26.970> have

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
could have that series could have

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.460 
could have that series could have
flipped<00:01:27.210> a<00:01:27.330> little<00:01:27.540> bit<00:01:27.659> I<00:01:27.780> mean<00:01:27.960> I<00:01:27.990> still<00:01:28.140> see

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
flipped a little bit I mean I still see

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:29.929 
flipped a little bit I mean I still see
okay<00:01:28.710> see<00:01:28.740> we'll<00:01:29.009> see<00:01:29.040> winter<00:01:29.520> night<00:01:29.640> series

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
okay see we'll see winter night series

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:30.859 
okay see we'll see winter night series
but<00:01:30.119> that<00:01:30.210> series<00:01:30.390> could<00:01:30.570> have<00:01:30.659> flipped<00:01:30.750> a

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
but that series could have flipped a

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.240 
but that series could have flipped a
little<00:01:31.079> bit<00:01:31.170> then<00:01:31.650> you<00:01:31.740> had<00:01:31.860> to<00:01:31.890> play<00:01:32.130> the

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
little bit then you had to play the

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.950 
little bit then you had to play the
Lakers<00:01:32.579> which<00:01:32.759> was<00:01:32.939> a<00:01:32.970> great<00:01:33.150> team<00:01:33.450> and<00:01:33.630> Biden

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
Lakers which was a great team and Biden

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.050 
Lakers which was a great team and Biden
was<00:01:34.049> still<00:01:34.259> playing<00:01:34.439> great<00:01:34.710> ball<00:01:34.890> I<00:01:35.189> mean<00:01:35.759> if

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
was still playing great ball I mean if

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.300 
was still playing great ball I mean if
he<00:01:36.270> was<00:01:36.420> given<00:01:37.110> it<00:01:37.229> in<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.590> right<00:01:37.710> situations

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
he was given it in the right situations

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.440 
he was given it in the right situations
maybe<00:01:38.520> they<00:01:38.700> could<00:01:38.820> have<00:01:38.909> done<00:01:38.939> better<00:01:39.180> and<00:01:39.329> I

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
maybe they could have done better and I

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.490 
maybe they could have done better and I
series<00:01:39.750> could<00:01:39.869> have<00:01:39.930> been<00:01:40.110> looking<00:01:40.380> a<00:01:40.409> little

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
series could have been looking a little

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.219 
series could have been looking a little
different<00:01:40.829> as<00:01:40.950> so<00:01:41.280> so<00:01:42.210> to<00:01:42.270> me<00:01:42.509> okc<00:01:42.869> had<00:01:43.140> the

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
different as so so to me okc had the

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.170 
different as so so to me okc had the
tougher<00:01:43.530> path<00:01:43.770> but<00:01:44.130> when<00:01:44.549> you<00:01:44.579> look<00:01:44.790> at<00:01:44.970> the

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
tougher path but when you look at the

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.880 
tougher path but when you look at the
way<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.509> basketball<00:01:46.140> game<00:01:46.380> has<00:01:46.530> been<00:01:46.680> being

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
way the basketball game has been being

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.730 
way the basketball game has been being
played<00:01:47.009> and<00:01:47.909> you<00:01:48.030> talked<00:01:48.270> about<00:01:48.560> there<00:01:49.560> being

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.649 
really no competition the Spurs have
just<00:01:52.500> been<00:01:52.619> that<00:01:52.979> dominate<00:01:53.549> that<00:01:53.759> diamond<00:01:54.570> in

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659
