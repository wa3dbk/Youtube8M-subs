00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.930
 Welcome to microscopy like 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.340
 you get a gift normal in minecraft 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:11.580
 Build a nice little machine 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:15.509
 can and it relaxes the principle 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:21.060
 an iron is drawn here comes 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:25.019
 nothing out and he won 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.460
 someday come and he also finds 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.990
 that you can be any other items 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.000
 if we throw the papers here 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:34.350
 he sees nothing for travel to 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.800
 weapons then already or for example gold 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.800
 I'm not 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:43.770
 So it can happen 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:48.539
 Mercedes does not build many items there 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:50.899
 so in which the guests now the whole 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.899
 below in 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.570
 last 23 on it 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:02.210
 behind the sisters here with 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:05.810
 then increasingly belong their way here 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:10.790
 a video blogs or something like that is or 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:27.830
 just do a torchance here and then 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:34.750
 Here the weather then you put on here 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:37.159
 the best torch a blog on it and then 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:41.539
 it's called down here in this lower one 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:47.479
 right upper in the lower 22 iron and 

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:50.679
 will be able to hold onto it so now 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:50.679
 we still have a little bit to do 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:59.290
 and then make the body attacks 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:02.340
 Just keep it up here as free 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.340
 1 and 3 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:15.640
 you have to point further down here 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:20.410
 So not any one event that also 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:23.200
 be a sign that you are not the 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:26.880
 can judge crates or the like 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:30.760
 because the projects are so if not 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:32.170
 You should be able to see that you are not 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:38.610
 then have covered by that actually 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:38.610
 go to the demonstration shows that 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:48.519
 does not work what they do that is 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:51.239
 not that far, but not jumping 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:51.239
 absolutely necessary 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:12.110
 but that was it 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:16.210
 So that's easy then I'm so very 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:19.760
 easy resource saving and compact 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:23.600
 exactly the right cash machine for 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:25.670
 every thank you so i have ours 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:28.930
 put up with 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.930
 until next time
