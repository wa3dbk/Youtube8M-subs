00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.940
 hi friends i am your friend sergey and 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:08.849
 today we'll talk about traps in 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.179
 that people get when they want 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:14.670
 somehow arrange your life 

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:16.970
 make her thriving better earn 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.529
 money these traps 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.689
 are economic laws which 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:25.590
 once discovered a very famous person 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:28.349
 historian, a writer who lived in England nail 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.590
 parkinson and i will tell you about three 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.840
 Parkinson's laws which describes 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.059
 why do some people get to have 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.690
 money other people don't have first law 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.460
 Neil Parkinson says that's what it 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:44.160
 average person most 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.719
 people you on all the people in the world spend on 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.450
 process as much time as they 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.809
 comfortable to spend well for example i need 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:54.110
 clean up this room in this office and 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:57.710
 I'll leave it to myself as goal as task 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:01:00.239
 for a long time swinging later 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:03.170
 tune up then slowly tidy up and 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:07.229
 I spend for example on the process for two days 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:11.460
 great result I cleaned the office 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:13.320
 clean but life requires that we 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.909
 become effective if you want 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.580
 change your life 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:20.369
 you will have to learn how to think like 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.560
 achieve the result at the time and the first 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.090
 the trap that we get to spend on 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.720
 process as much time as we 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:30.240
 comfortable life this gym is necessary 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.950
 exercise training involves 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.840
 efforts need to learn 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.640
 release a certain inner 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.600
 resource which energy 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.540
 allows 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.579
 through the effort to get the best result in 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.369
 shorter time this ability 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:46.350
 called efficiency and so trap 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.030
 number one spend time process 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.750
 how many are there as much as you 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.570
 comfortable 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:54.689
 either overcoming this trap become 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.700
 effective and for the same 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.229
 time either in less time learn 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.890
 gets the best result 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:03.630
 trap number two complications I know 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.930
 read a large number of books like all 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.899
 you 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:10.220
 and at the beginning of each book is often written 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:12.200
 this book will change your life and 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.540
 I meet many people who read 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.970
 hedgehogs books that I read myself with the same 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.680
 the very preface the book will change life 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.310
 many people who read these books 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:24.340
 they say 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:26.870
 I read and life does not change and 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:29.470
 the problem why life does not change 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:34.420
 man comes down to this 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:35.980
 books technology scientists people 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:39.250
 finishing up 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:43.780
 ginger universities 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:46.280
 educating other people complicates the process 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.800
 albert einstein on this occasion said 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.920
 if a person cannot express 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:54.860
 the essence of things in the simplest words he is not 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.720
 understands essentially miles monroe my 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.760
 a teacher whom I studied for many years 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.220
 spoke about this here what if 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.380
 target not known abuse 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:06.200
 inevitable if you can not express 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:08.330
 things in simple terms that means 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.700
 one thing you don't understand 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.830
 and if you want to learn how to be rich 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:15.739
 I will earn you money 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:17.930
 help you figure out what money is and 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:20.120
 I will bring it to the most simple concepts and 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:22.700
 so rule number two which allows 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.420
 get out of the trap complication leads 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.850
 to stop 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:28.820
 of this forgiveness and now rule number 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:29.150
 three third law of parkinson says here 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.040
 about what 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.709
 that all people without exception on 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.780
 throughout life get richer but here's how 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:37.820
 life is arranged 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:40.610
 man's expenses grow with his 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:42.620
 income most people spend exactly 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:44.989
 as much money as she earns 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:47.299
 a large number of people go to the bank 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:49.820
 take loans and thus begin 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:52.459
 spend more than they earned if 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:55.310
 you want your life to be rich 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:57.950
 you need to change the system of thinking you 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:00.920
 need to learn how to beat a wedge drive a wedge 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:03.200
 This is a very simple mechanism associated with 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:05.570
 changing the system of thinking and the essence of it 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.739
 primitive need to learn how to do so 

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:09.530
 to income 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:11.390
 began to exceed expenses as soon as you 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:12.860
 learn how to do it as soon as you 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:15.920
 change your mindset 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:18.650
 immediately your life will obviously become 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:21.169
 other and in the next lesson we will start 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:22.700
 deal with you how do we act 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:23.190
 what we need to learn 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.560
 beat to 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:28.250
 thank you very much for your attention i am your friend 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.250
