00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:03.120 
easy to stow
so<00:02:01.630> then<00:02:01.750> you<00:02:01.840> see<00:02:02.140> on<00:02:02.409> the<00:02:02.560> side<00:02:02.770> have<00:02:02.979> got<00:02:03.100> a

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
so then you see on the side have got a

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.020 
so then you see on the side have got a
nice<00:02:03.340> rugged<00:02:04.680> grab<00:02:05.680> handle<00:02:06.100> I<00:02:06.280> always<00:02:06.880> need<00:02:07.000> to

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
nice rugged grab handle I always need to

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.809 
nice rugged grab handle I always need to
pick<00:02:07.270> up<00:02:07.420> allows<00:02:08.319> you<00:02:08.470> if<00:02:09.009> it's<00:02:09.220> not<00:02:09.489> and<00:02:09.700> if

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:09.819 
pick up allows you if it's not and if

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:11.850 
pick up allows you if it's not and if
it's<00:02:10.000> heavy<00:02:10.629> you<00:02:10.989> can<00:02:11.140> get<00:02:11.470> a<00:02:11.500> couple<00:02:11.769> of

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
it's heavy you can get a couple of

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.410 
it's heavy you can get a couple of
people<00:02:11.980> to<00:02:12.129> grab<00:02:12.370> it<00:02:12.519> and<00:02:12.940> it<00:02:13.060> makes<00:02:13.180> it<00:02:13.300> just

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
people to grab it and it makes it just

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.630 
people to grab it and it makes it just
makes<00:02:13.569> it<00:02:13.660> easier<00:02:14.080> also<00:02:14.680> got<00:02:15.129> a<00:02:15.160> big<00:02:15.400> grab

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
makes it easier also got a big grab

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.589 
makes it easier also got a big grab
handle<00:02:16.000> on<00:02:16.090> top<00:02:16.239> as<00:02:16.420> well<00:02:17.760> okay<00:02:18.760> so<00:02:18.819> let's<00:02:19.239> take

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:19.599 
handle on top as well okay so let's take

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:21.089 
handle on top as well okay so let's take
a<00:02:19.660> look<00:02:19.870> at<00:02:20.230> some<00:02:20.470> of<00:02:20.530> the<00:02:20.590> other<00:02:20.709> features<00:02:21.069> I

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:21.099 
a look at some of the other features I

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:23.820 
a look at some of the other features I
mean<00:02:21.280> the<00:02:21.430> bag<00:02:21.670> has<00:02:22.209> so<00:02:22.720> many<00:02:22.900> it's<00:02:23.650> very

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
mean the bag has so many it's very

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:25.920 
mean the bag has so many it's very
difficult<00:02:24.190> to<00:02:24.340> get<00:02:24.430> all<00:02:24.489> in<00:02:24.700> one<00:02:24.819> video<00:02:24.940> but<00:02:25.810> it

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
difficult to get all in one video but it

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.570 
difficult to get all in one video but it
also<00:02:26.050> divides<00:02:26.500> into<00:02:26.830> a<00:02:26.920> number<00:02:27.160> of<00:02:27.190> other<00:02:27.250> bags

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
also divides into a number of other bags

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:28.949 
also divides into a number of other bags
so<00:02:27.849> we<00:02:27.940> just<00:02:28.060> have<00:02:28.180> a<00:02:28.209> closer<00:02:28.450> look<00:02:28.569> at<00:02:28.780> some<00:02:28.900> of

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
so we just have a closer look at some of

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:32.339 
so we just have a closer look at some of
the<00:02:29.049> individual<00:02:29.470> bags<00:02:30.209> okay<00:02:31.209> so<00:02:31.269> the<00:02:31.450> next<00:02:31.569> bag

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:32.349 
the individual bags okay so the next bag

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:35.520 
the individual bags okay so the next bag
is<00:02:32.650> a<00:02:32.680> one<00:02:33.160> of<00:02:33.280> the<00:02:33.340> larger<00:02:33.640> ones<00:02:34.530> basically

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
is a one of the larger ones basically

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:36.690 
is a one of the larger ones basically
have<00:02:35.650> a<00:02:35.680> zip<00:02:35.920> that<00:02:36.069> runs<00:02:36.250> all<00:02:36.340> the<00:02:36.370> way<00:02:36.489> around

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
have a zip that runs all the way around

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:44.580 
have a zip that runs all the way around
the<00:02:36.760> bag<00:02:41.670> it<00:02:42.670> just<00:02:42.819> comes<00:02:43.030> off<00:02:43.470> it<00:02:44.470> is

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
the bag it just comes off it is

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.319 
the bag it just comes off it is
basically<00:02:44.980> a<00:02:45.099> much<00:02:45.280> bigger<00:02:45.579> bag<00:02:45.880> that<00:02:46.180> you<00:02:46.239> can
