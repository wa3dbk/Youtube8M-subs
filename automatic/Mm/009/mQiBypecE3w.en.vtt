little Lego bricks put together so but I

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.720 
little Lego bricks put together so but I
kind<00:03:00.470> of<00:03:00.530> enhanced<00:03:00.950> it<00:03:01.070> so<00:03:01.250> it<00:03:01.370> can<00:03:01.400> look<00:03:01.670> like

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
kind of enhanced it so it can look like

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.509 
kind of enhanced it so it can look like
the<00:03:02.090> image<00:03:02.450> because<00:03:02.780> they<00:03:03.050> obviously<00:03:03.400> put<00:03:04.400> it

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:04.519 
the image because they obviously put it

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:08.140 
the image because they obviously put it
together<00:03:04.640> from<00:03:05.239> an<00:03:05.390> actual<00:03:05.570> image<00:03:06.140> so<00:03:07.150> it's

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
together from an actual image so it's

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.039 
together from an actual image so it's
basically<00:03:08.450> the<00:03:08.780> real<00:03:09.049> image<00:03:09.380> and<00:03:10.510> it<00:03:11.510> just

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:12.049 
basically the real image and it just

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:16.289 
basically the real image and it just
shows<00:03:12.549> more<00:03:13.549> images<00:03:14.180> for<00:03:14.660> this<00:03:15.019> summer<00:03:15.290> and

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:16.299 
shows more images for this summer and

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:20.740 
shows more images for this summer and
again<00:03:17.299> the<00:03:17.420> sets<00:03:17.660> come<00:03:17.900> in<00:03:17.989> August<00:03:18.440> and<00:03:19.750> the

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
again the sets come in August and the

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.460 
again the sets come in August and the
tournament<00:03:21.290> sets<00:03:21.560> came<00:03:21.980> out<00:03:22.900> after<00:03:23.900> the

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
tournament sets came out after the

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.240 
tournament sets came out after the
tournament<00:03:24.739> sees<00:03:25.100> or<00:03:25.420> mom<00:03:26.830> they<00:03:27.830> came<00:03:28.100> out

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
tournament sees or mom they came out

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.050 
tournament sees or mom they came out
like<00:03:28.519> after<00:03:29.360> the<00:03:29.480> first<00:03:29.690> episode<00:03:30.320> premiered

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
like after the first episode premiered

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:35.890 
like after the first episode premiered
so<00:03:32.950> my<00:03:33.950> guess<00:03:34.010> is<00:03:34.220> the<00:03:34.790> season<00:03:35.360> this<00:03:35.660> next

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
so my guess is the season this next

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.420 
so my guess is the season this next
season<00:03:36.290> will<00:03:36.410> start<00:03:36.530> to<00:03:36.769> air<00:03:37.430> around<00:03:38.080> August

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
season will start to air around August

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:45.699 
season will start to air around August
um<00:03:41.170> august-september<00:03:42.170> ish<00:03:42.680> um<00:03:44.320> the<00:03:45.320> second

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:45.709

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.860 
when seasons will come and not one of my
guess<00:04:17.329> is<00:04:17.509> it's<00:04:17.540> going<00:04:17.870> to<00:04:17.989> come<00:04:18.229> around

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
guess is it's going to come around

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:24.520 
guess is it's going to come around
august-september<00:04:20.870> and<00:04:23.020> very<00:04:24.020> very<00:04:24.259> low

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 
august-september and very very low

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.590 
august-september and very very low
chance<00:04:24.560> probably<00:04:25.100> but<00:04:25.520> hopefully<00:04:26.060> like<00:04:26.330> maybe

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 
chance probably but hopefully like maybe

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.409 
chance probably but hopefully like maybe
the<00:04:26.810> end<00:04:26.930> of<00:04:27.520> july<00:04:28.520> or<00:04:28.820> something<00:04:29.240> because

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:29.419 
the end of july or something because

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:31.900 
the end of july or something because
then<00:04:29.930> that'd<00:04:30.169> be<00:04:30.770> like<00:04:30.979> maybe<00:04:31.220> a<00:04:31.400> few<00:04:31.639> weeks

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:31.910 
then that'd be like maybe a few weeks

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:34.779 
then that'd be like maybe a few weeks
before<00:04:32.330> the<00:04:32.449> set<00:04:32.690> to<00:04:32.780> come<00:04:32.900> out<00:04:33.050> so<00:04:33.979> I<00:04:34.370> don't

00:04:34.779 --> 00:04:34.789 
before the set to come out so I don't

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:36.909 
before the set to come out so I don't
know<00:04:34.970> this<00:04:35.180> is<00:04:35.330> my<00:04:35.479> hopes<00:04:35.720> and<00:04:35.900> guesses<00:04:36.350> for

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:36.919 
know this is my hopes and guesses for

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:39.790 
know this is my hopes and guesses for
the<00:04:37.039> season<00:04:37.400> to<00:04:37.430> come<00:04:37.669> but<00:04:38.330> right<00:04:38.389> now<00:04:38.600> we<00:04:38.810> have

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:43.370 
those are my hopes I don't know at all

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:46.210 
those are my hopes I don't know at all
so<00:05:43.940> don't<00:05:44.150> like<00:05:44.440> say<00:05:45.440> I<00:05:45.470> got<00:05:45.770> it<00:05:45.889> wrong<00:05:46.010> or

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:46.220

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:48.289 
anything these are my guesses so I'm

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:50.050 
anything these are my guesses so I'm
just<00:05:48.560> I'm<00:05:48.800> just<00:05:48.830> guessing<00:05:49.340> on<00:05:49.639> when<00:05:49.849> these

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:50.060 
just I'm just guessing on when these

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:52.149 
just I'm just guessing on when these
will<00:05:50.240> come<00:05:50.449> so<00:05:50.840> what<00:05:51.560> do<00:05:51.620> you<00:05:51.710> think<00:05:51.949> this

00:05:52.149 --> 00:05:52.159 
will come so what do you think this

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:55.060 
will come so what do you think this
season<00:05:52.490> will<00:05:52.610> come<00:05:52.820> and<00:05:53.830> what<00:05:54.830> do<00:05:54.889> you<00:05:54.949> think

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:55.070 
season will come and what do you think

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:56.080 
season will come and what do you think
it's<00:05:55.190> gonna<00:05:55.280> be<00:05:55.370> about<00:05:55.490> because<00:05:55.849> it<00:05:55.970> looks

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:56.090 
it's gonna be about because it looks

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:57.610 
it's gonna be about because it looks
really<00:05:56.360> really<00:05:56.690> interesting<00:05:56.960> nice<00:05:57.409> and

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:57.620 
really really interesting nice and

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:00.040 
really really interesting nice and
spooky<00:05:58.130> dark<00:05:58.400> of<00:05:59.389> course<00:05:59.479> because<00:05:59.840> of<00:05:59.870> the

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:00.050 
spooky dark of course because of the

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:03.610 
spooky dark of course because of the
ghosts<00:06:00.560> but<00:06:01.070> what<00:06:01.280> do<00:06:01.340> you<00:06:01.430> think
