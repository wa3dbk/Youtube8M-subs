00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 the one that could have followed francfort 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.779
 and welcome to what would be the map of 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:09.330
 map with events the benchmark map of 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.230
 fight night at fredys 2 in garries mode 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.360
 which will be in the description 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.040
 clear for you to play it in your 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.599
 small house in the community of this 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.010
 instead we are going to remove the apps that 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.390
 appear above because I'm sure 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.910
 that the tempest of 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.410
 sensor why this one made me a 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.789
 shit tanks churches then yes 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.220
 would like to see a higher quality video 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.660
 I recommend that you go see at least 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.340
 of some gringos because those are the 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.050
 that have the computed most cabrona they 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.790
 sitting on us game are the ones that say more 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.050
 extensive chingones we are not 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.059
 chingones and is new 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.040
 boxee and blah blah blah we said there 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.280
 but as you can see my companies are 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.079
 they come down from the ass of the anus according to me according to me 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.250
 we can not kill the animatronics if 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.250
 we are going to put what would be 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:52.250
 let's see where the weapons are 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:55.070
 minecraft or richter suites can not 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:58.590
 get the arms live the dog if 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:01.890
 I'm using what would be 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:05.339
 in concise screen mode mode vergara of 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.080
 mode mode mode mode mode ventaneado the 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.360
 I play to make me more chunky and 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.220
 can bring this little game says that 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.260
 to start what would be this little 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.940
 map that is dark to mine the ga 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.670
 until the spider dog until the 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.750
 shit we have to come here to the room 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.520
 of the animatronics 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.799
 and put all 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.229
 and that the old animatronics is not so 

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:27.670
 functional right now so let's 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:29.049
 return to us by accessing the office and 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.630
 that we have turned them on we can not turn off 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:33.850
 the truth is giving me a lot of fear 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.679
 because because this is a map is the map 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.539
 in this country 2 that is a lot more 

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:39.759
 so scary that in the game because you can 

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:41.500
 move you can do whatever you want not 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:43.569
 you can kill us in matronic or suppose that 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.030
 just survive I'm not sure that 

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:48.380
 he forgave is because I do not know how 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:51.579
 I have what it would be 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.579
 various weapons 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.610
 it's part 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.230
 or that they are already starting to appear 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.790
 blacks here we can not use the cameras 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:00.260
 because because they make me the endures 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.940
 I have to have these graphs for 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:04.370
 be able to run the game and in this kind of 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.510
 graphics there is no option to put the 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:09.770
 cameras we're all going to have to get there 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:11.540
 only in the middle and on the sides little to 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.880
 little as you can see there is a small 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.580
 delay in what would be the medium light 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.200
 I can not put it 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.850
 and because good is already started 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.860
 music of 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.570
 chinga nerve music and attitude already 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.700
 we know it's called chingón 9 and it does not 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:28.280
 conceives the hot physical bastard 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:32.050
 ok there are not so many the three that are 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.050
 get away from fear basically 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.830
 that there is no one yet I do not want 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.070
 add to the software animatronics and 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.330
 planet is going to be super cool and not 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:45.270
 with us I was going to be like a 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:47.070
 nightmare made true of right now 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:48.600
 in case I'm shitting with fear and so 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:51.020
 just think that the points are going to come out 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.020
 it is crime 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:57.970
 shell balloon boy fuck uy 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.740
 and in a month 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.470
 die as 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.069
 in the middle 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:22.830
 we are not going to turn on the light because it is 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.830
 this generous land etc 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.629
 with a chal go 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.829
 and I have a lot but a lot of fear the truth 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:35.819
 It is that it is a fear 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:35.819

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:32.540
 I'm going to play because they are not 

00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:34.220
