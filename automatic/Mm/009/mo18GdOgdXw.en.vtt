three<00:00:34.090> or<00:00:34.210> four<00:00:34.450> bone<00:00:34.690> but<00:00:34.930> I<00:00:34.960> make<00:00:35.170> it<00:00:35.200> into<00:00:35.620> a

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:35.650 
three or four bone but I make it into a

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.090

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:39.100 
two bone and I split the bone and and I

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.280 
two bone and I split the bone and and I
pry<00:00:39.580> it<00:00:39.640> open<00:00:39.820> so<00:00:40.180> that<00:00:40.210> you<00:00:40.390> get<00:00:40.600> more<00:00:40.810> surface

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:41.290 
pry it open so that you get more surface

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:42.990 
pry it open so that you get more surface
area<00:00:41.440> so<00:00:41.710> it's<00:00:41.860> more<00:00:42.010> like<00:00:42.220> you're<00:00:42.730> not<00:00:42.820> like

it's kind of carrying in through the

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:21.749 
it's kind of carrying in through the
steak<00:01:19.450> I<00:01:19.749> wanted<00:01:20.499> to<00:01:20.829> carry<00:01:21.069> through<00:01:21.399> fare

fairly<00:01:22.479> evenly<00:01:22.899> so<00:01:23.350> if<00:01:23.619> it's<00:01:23.920> thick<00:01:24.100> enough<00:01:24.130> by

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 
fairly evenly so if it's thick enough by

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.700 
fairly evenly so if it's thick enough by
cooking<00:01:24.729> on<00:01:24.939> one<00:01:25.119> side<00:01:25.389> just<00:01:25.780> when<00:01:26.350> it<00:01:26.439> starts

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:26.710 
cooking on one side just when it starts

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.099 
cooking on one side just when it starts
building<00:01:27.369> momentum<00:01:27.490> I<00:01:27.909> flip<00:01:28.240> it<00:01:28.270> that<00:01:28.869> hold

00:01:29.099 --> 00:01:29.109 
building momentum I flip it that hold

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:31.080 
building momentum I flip it that hold
misnomer<00:01:29.710> of<00:01:29.829> just<00:01:30.369> leave<00:01:30.549> it<00:01:30.700> on<00:01:30.789> and<00:01:30.999> don't

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
misnomer of just leave it on and don't

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.870 
misnomer of just leave it on and don't
touch<00:01:31.299> it<00:01:31.600> comes<00:01:32.350> from<00:01:32.709> grills<00:01:33.490> that<00:01:33.670> really

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
touch it comes from grills that really

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.669 
touch it comes from grills that really
don't<00:01:33.969> have<00:01:34.090> fire<00:01:34.359> power<00:01:34.659> first<00:01:35.259> of<00:01:35.439> all<00:01:35.530> it

00:01:35.669 --> 00:01:35.679 
don't have fire power first of all it

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:38.160 
don't have fire power first of all it
tempers<00:01:36.189> through<00:01:37.090> the<00:01:37.270> meat<00:01:37.450> and<00:01:37.659> what<00:01:37.959> I<00:01:37.990> mean

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
tempers through the meat and what I mean

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.139 
tempers through the meat and what I mean
by<00:01:38.319> that<00:01:38.350> it's<00:01:38.619> just<00:01:39.069> gonna<00:01:39.189> evenly<00:01:39.579> cook<00:01:39.819> pink

00:01:40.139 --> 00:01:40.149 
by that it's just gonna evenly cook pink

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:42.690 
by that it's just gonna evenly cook pink
-<00:01:40.299> pink<00:01:40.329> straight<00:01:40.899> through<00:01:41.259> and<00:01:41.499> then<00:01:42.219> it<00:01:42.369> also

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
- pink straight through and then it also
