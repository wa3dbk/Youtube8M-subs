00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:05.850
 today we will talk about the clean contact 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.069
 on here 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.929
 This is the only contact for the motherboard. 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.969
 how are you going to use this one 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.429
 does not make electric contact is single contact 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.920
 you will notice that in the 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.750
 brings that warns in the manual of liÃªda that 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.789
 we use to clean the contact 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.800
 electrical contacts, what do we do 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.570
 people pass in the political memory slot 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.140
 contact passes through the nodes of the 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:31.080
 Video slot in the cup gives support 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.690
 pci express that the pc video card and 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.670
 normal and so will we use the contact 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.590
 with rock cleaning and most of the 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.300
 Sometimes it solves 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.129
 you will pass the contact when your 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.870
 brand is not giving a picture 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.610
 But I only spend a lot of time on 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.980
 contact does not solve, I prefer to 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.420
 Rubber cleans even more 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.789
 when is the contact with the video card 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.129
 and other than your summer card 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.920
 have the image gone to eraser 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:59.399
 white pencil on her metallic part and 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.750
 clean dirt always always chance to 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.670
 Did you solve the problem? 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.710
 cleaning your video card with the 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.290
 rubber and moving into contact in the slot 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.630

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.390

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.100
 Look the cars are connected and 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.880

 take ram memory which is one of those 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.730
 here and clear the RAM memory part a 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.920

 remember you have to have a rubber in 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.970
 have to know how to do 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:39.450
 memory cleaning how do you do 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:42.110
 You will put ram memory and it will 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:45.840
 pick up a rubber any touch 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:50.250
 Rubber like that's gonna turn your back on me. 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:52.170

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:01.500
 will get the sale only employs one 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:04.530
 side to side the two sides will become a 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.870
 The other side is also waiting here. 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.360
 also a side of here that puts her in the 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.310
 motherboard and for sure it will come back to 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.470
 picture ready, go there 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.720
 problem solved and sorry 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.580
 technicians were passing these tips 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.440
 but it's the maintenance course I'm 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.209
 talking about concepts and I have to 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.550
 show how we fix and 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:25.350
 We use a crack like that. 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:28.830
 fix a memory like this 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:30.870
 and most of the time we charge 5070 30 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:34.319
 real in cash 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:37.019
 because it pays who does not know and who 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:39.060
 Do you know what this truth is? 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:41.900
 so we're finishing up here and even 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.900
 the next chance
