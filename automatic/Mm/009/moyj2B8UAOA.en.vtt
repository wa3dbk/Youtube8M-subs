00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
an extra layer of support when I was

looking around universities I was very

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:26.770 
looking around universities I was very
much<00:03:25.700> like<00:03:25.880> the<00:03:26.000> one<00:03:26.120> of<00:03:26.239> the<00:03:26.299> first<00:03:26.510> things<00:03:26.569> I

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
much like the one of the first things I

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.229 
much like the one of the first things I
did<00:03:26.810> was<00:03:26.959> look<00:03:27.260> at<00:03:27.470> the<00:03:27.680> music<00:03:28.370> facilities<00:03:28.910> and
