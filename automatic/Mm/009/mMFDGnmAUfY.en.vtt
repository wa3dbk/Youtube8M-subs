00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:43.070
 That certainly includes all my appointments day 

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:59.220

00:00:50.190 --> 00:01:02.339
 how so many really don't like the herbs 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:04.799
 shampoo and styling gel are above and the 

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:07.470

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.420

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.409
 strategic logistics from the 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.689
 control center and that means that 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.490
 means that I actually meet the 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:33.720

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:57.760

 spatter spatter spatter 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:24.380
 three animals whose for an opinion 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.380
 all right
