00:00:04.629 --> 00:00:11.240
 just a lot of countries and here 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:26.869
 a lot of warane and sometimes with me 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:29.510
 show you which one if you completely 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:31.460
 quiet then you hear so many here 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:32.599
 noises and then you get it that way 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.090
 a little bit shitty you look 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:37.010
 always behind him because it could be yes 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:40.699
 suddenly a dresser came from somewhere 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:44.120
 Look, that's what's up 

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:45.739
 popular place for those here but 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.510
 today we have no luck here today 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:51.010
 Do not even look if we have them now 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.010
 go but then see it again 

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:09.440
 I am glad that he is his so called 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.170
 had a weapon 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:15.710
 because here he is in this moment 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:17.510
 Suddenly there is my heart 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.820
 Slipped into your pants at the meeting 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:22.130
 it is smaller as well as on the fraser 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.720
 Iceland has a total of five islands 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.850
 where the kites live and here on 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.850
 komodo there are the most and biggest 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:34.280
 but no matter if they are big or small 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.290
 they are always terrifying 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.990
 especially if you have a few 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:41.479
 For example, she knows facts about them 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:45.500
 succumb to their prey with the help of 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:47.680
 Bacteria in her saliva a bit and 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.960
 The animal dies due to an infection 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.300
 you can see here for example within 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.060
 short time 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:57.560
 they also reach up to 20 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.680
 kilometers per hour 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.300
 and you see things from 300 meters 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.000
 distance 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:07.640
 I'll tell you in the plane if you're there 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.710
 in Bali or in the environment since after 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.180
 blomberg and then the am 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:12.920
 best with the boat and look at you 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.900
 These animals are really 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.370
 impressive 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:20.960
 I say goodbye to these blatant 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:22.910
 huge co-modus of modules and 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.650
 what's in the car behind me is again 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.420
 on 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:31.790
 I hope you liked it and once 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.790
 look what is this on this field 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.180
 Aachen
