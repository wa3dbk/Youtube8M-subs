00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 hello today I have a black forest 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.109
 cake for you and a whole 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.019
 simple variant without multiple layers 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.090
 or so it goes as always with that 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.759
 you make the ground for that gives the eggs 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.350
 and the water together with the sugar 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.770
 in a bowl and beat everything 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.840
 look at me while you can 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.449
 the coated teaspoon baking powder 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.630
 and the tablespoon of cacau with the flour 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:30.529
 mix and then this mass after and 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.529
 to give to the dough 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:40.580
 then I find her springform 1 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.770
 now only done on the edge and the 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:44.750
 now simply lined with baking paper 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:47.930
 then the day comes or becomes that 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:51.010
 whole 20 minutes at 190 degrees above 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.010
 baked underneath 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.320
 in time you can already do that 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.880
 Sipping the sour cherries and the water 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.980
 necessarily catch that you need 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.960
 that is why you still have and still face you 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.620
 twelve churches on the side of the beautiful 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.600
 appearance 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.950
 then leave the finished floor 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:10.950
 first actors and then makes it 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.950
 jumps 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.799
 OK 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.840
 then you have to roughly but 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:19.610
 half a tablespoon of cherry water 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.500
 Can you do a little cup? 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.180
 or so then take a silicone 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.690
 brush that could be under your fingers 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.640
 do 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:29.500
 In any case, the floor is then with the 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.500
 deer drizzled water 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.050
 Now let 's start with the cherry mass 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.430
 I have this special red here 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.050
 short without saying 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.240
 with a small sip of that 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:42.940
 kirschwasser offer as well as her that 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.410
 have to do if you do things and 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.260
 the rest of the cherry juice will now be 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:49.600
 heated then come two tablespoons 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:53.860
 sugar and two tablespoons again 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:55.660
 water to everything boiled up as soon as it 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.610
 starts to cook as well as pudding 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:00.930
 Then you associate the mass of the 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:02.560
 hearth plate turn it off and will that 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.810
 good one 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.560
 that's pretty different now 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:11.050
 already here 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:12.850
 I'll show you the constancy 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.070
 now very quickly stuck because of this 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.840
 right now the sour cherries 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:19.420
 careful not to lift too long 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:23.220
 and then all on the floor 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.220
 spread out 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.620
 then imagine the cake in the 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.420
 fridge 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.880
 I had it the day before 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.410
 prepared and then the day it is 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:42.520
 can you now cream with the 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:42.520
 Vanilla sugar and cream beat stiff 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:47.190
 the whole will be a good year 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.930
 passed and then I have now 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.690
 with a fork so had to clean 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:54.200
 even if you do not really 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.610
 seen made fun and made 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.970
 then it comes out already 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.970
 scroll 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:09.300
 then I have this mass in mine 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:12.110
 daughter gas filled and twelve piles 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.110
 made 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.450
 then it will be only the beautiful 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.940
 and sour cherries set and is already 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.620
 the whole finished the cowen puts her 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.970
 then it's best to eat again 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.650
 at least a good hour in the 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.630
 fridge and then you can get it 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:38.510
 first cut the edge loose 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:40.580
 then carefully remove the ring and 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:41.830
 that 's it in principle, too, it is 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:44.200
 really a very simple one 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:46.519
 Variation below tastes so great 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.870
 if you do it then leave me 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:49.489
 but know how it tasted you 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:52.069
 or how it worked and what you did with it 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:55.870
 had problems then we see each other 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:55.870
 next video what's good then
