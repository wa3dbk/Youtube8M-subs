what<00:00:03.929> is<00:00:04.020> up<00:00:04.140> YouTube<00:00:04.259> my<00:00:04.589> name<00:00:04.620> is<00:00:04.890> MOA<00:00:05.040> 19<00:00:05.460> and

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
what is up YouTube my name is MOA 19 and

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.369 
what is up YouTube my name is MOA 19 and
today<00:00:05.940> I'm<00:00:06.180> going<00:00:06.420> over<00:00:06.569> what<00:00:06.960> I<00:00:06.990> think<00:00:07.259> would

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
today I'm going over what I think would

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.720 
today I'm going over what I think would
be<00:00:07.529> the<00:00:07.560> top<00:00:07.890> five<00:00:08.189> expected<00:00:09.059> mega<00:00:09.330> evolutions

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:10.730 
be the top five expected mega evolutions

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:13.669 
be the top five expected mega evolutions
edgy<00:00:11.730> I<00:00:11.759> guess<00:00:12.030> just<00:00:12.150> in<00:00:12.300> the<00:00:12.420> near<00:00:12.630> future<00:00:12.679> for

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
edgy I guess just in the near future for

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.010 
edgy I guess just in the near future for
canto<00:00:14.340> so<00:00:14.639> we're<00:00:14.759> going<00:00:14.849> to<00:00:14.940> do<00:00:15.059> each<00:00:15.330> region<00:00:15.870> a

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
canto so we're going to do each region a

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.470 
canto so we're going to do each region a
different<00:00:16.289> region<00:00:16.410> every<00:00:16.650> week<00:00:17.060> but<00:00:18.060> no<00:00:18.180> other

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
different region every week but no other

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.790 
different region every week but no other
people<00:00:18.810> have<00:00:18.900> done<00:00:18.930> something<00:00:19.500> similar<00:00:19.619> to

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
people have done something similar to

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.349 
people have done something similar to
this<00:00:19.920> but<00:00:20.220> this<00:00:20.369> is<00:00:20.430> what<00:00:20.670> I<00:00:20.699> think<00:00:20.970> base<00:00:21.119> of

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
this but this is what I think base of

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.630 
this but this is what I think base of
like<00:00:21.539> you<00:00:21.930> know<00:00:21.990> facts<00:00:22.500> and<00:00:22.980> just<00:00:23.250> kind<00:00:23.550> of

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
like you know facts and just kind of

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.029 
like you know facts and just kind of
like<00:00:23.850> it<00:00:24.090> is<00:00:24.630> also<00:00:24.900> you<00:00:25.140> know<00:00:25.350> gambling<00:00:25.949> a

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
like it is also you know gambling a

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.679 
like it is also you know gambling a
little<00:00:26.070> bit<00:00:26.400> just<00:00:26.550> impersonal<00:00:27.180> in<00:00:27.240> my<00:00:27.390> opinion

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
little bit just impersonal in my opinion

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.529 
little bit just impersonal in my opinion
but<00:00:28.349> not<00:00:29.010> as<00:00:29.189> much<00:00:29.369> as<00:00:29.429> what<00:00:29.760> I<00:00:29.820> want<00:00:30.210> to<00:00:30.390> happen

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
but not as much as what I want to happen

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.860 
but not as much as what I want to happen
but<00:00:31.260> more<00:00:31.470> of<00:00:31.560> us<00:00:31.710> what<00:00:31.949> I<00:00:31.980> think<00:00:32.430> will<00:00:32.640> happen

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:32.870 
but more of us what I think will happen

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.209 
but more of us what I think will happen
and<00:00:33.870> we're<00:00:34.050> gonna<00:00:34.170> actually<00:00:34.320> start<00:00:34.590> off<00:00:34.980> here

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
and we're gonna actually start off here

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.069 
and we're gonna actually start off here
with<00:00:35.460> number<00:00:35.820> five<00:00:36.090> which<00:00:36.480> is<00:00:36.630> going<00:00:36.840> to<00:00:36.899> be

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
with number five which is going to be

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.740 
with number five which is going to be
gol<00:00:38.070> dach<00:00:38.280> and<00:00:38.520> you<00:00:38.610> might<00:00:38.820> be<00:00:38.850> thinking<00:00:38.969> why

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
gol dach and you might be thinking why

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.959 
gol dach and you might be thinking why
Golda<00:00:40.379> why<00:00:40.680> who<00:00:40.739> could<00:00:41.040> ever<00:00:41.129> choose<00:00:41.460> gol<00:00:41.730> dach

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
Golda why who could ever choose gol dach

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.510 
Golda why who could ever choose gol dach
for<00:00:42.210> a<00:00:42.239> mega<00:00:42.480> evolution<00:00:43.079> well<00:00:43.430> here's<00:00:44.430> the

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
for a mega evolution well here's the

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.060 
for a mega evolution well here's the
thing<00:00:44.670> about<00:00:44.700> gold<00:00:45.149> duck<00:00:45.360> um<00:00:45.660> I<00:00:46.079> feel<00:00:46.800> like

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
thing about gold duck um I feel like

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.090 
thing about gold duck um I feel like
it's<00:00:47.370> one<00:00:47.670> of<00:00:47.820> those<00:00:47.969> uh<00:00:48.329> just<00:00:48.989> groups<00:00:49.920> of

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
it's one of those uh just groups of

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.369 
it's one of those uh just groups of
pokemon<00:00:50.520> like<00:00:50.760> side<00:00:51.059> I<00:00:51.090> can<00:00:51.210> go<00:00:51.420> doc<00:00:51.660> I<00:00:51.960> can't

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
pokemon like side I can go doc I can't

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:53.840 
pokemon like side I can go doc I can't
think<00:00:52.500> of<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.710> evolutionary<00:00:53.460> line<00:00:53.699> I<00:00:53.730> guess

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
think of the evolutionary line I guess

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.220 
think of the evolutionary line I guess
that<00:00:54.809> was<00:00:55.020> left<00:00:55.379> unfinished<00:00:56.570> because<00:00:57.570> if<00:00:58.109> you

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
that was left unfinished because if you

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.229 
that was left unfinished because if you
look<00:00:58.440> at<00:00:58.559> other<00:00:58.710> things<00:00:58.949> like<00:00:59.399> I<00:00:59.820> don't<00:01:00.000> know

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
look at other things like I don't know

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.789 
look at other things like I don't know
like<00:01:00.660> right<00:01:01.260> on<00:01:01.320> and<00:01:02.899> scizor<00:01:03.899> and<00:01:04.350> stuff<00:01:04.619> like

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
like right on and scizor and stuff like

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.890 
like right on and scizor and stuff like
that<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:05.100> there's<00:01:05.430> just<00:01:05.580> other<00:01:05.729> guys<00:01:06.240> here

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
that and there's just other guys here

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.380 
that and there's just other guys here
that<00:01:07.340> eventually<00:01:08.340> got<00:01:08.580> their<00:01:08.760> final<00:01:09.210> mega

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
that eventually got their final mega

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.140 
that eventually got their final mega
evolutions<00:01:10.049> um<00:01:10.290> but<00:01:10.890> Golduck<00:01:11.430> it<00:01:11.939> just

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
evolutions um but Golduck it just

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.120 
evolutions um but Golduck it just
doesn't<00:01:12.540> look<00:01:12.720> really<00:01:13.110> like<00:01:13.290> a<00:01:13.320> final<00:01:13.890> mega

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
doesn't look really like a final mega

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.230 
doesn't look really like a final mega
evolution<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:14.700> me<00:01:14.820> it<00:01:14.909> looks<00:01:15.090> like<00:01:15.150> a

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
evolution to me it looks like a

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.260 
evolution to me it looks like a
secondary<00:01:15.900> mega<00:01:16.229> evolution<00:01:16.799> I<00:01:16.950> mean<00:01:17.759> again

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
secondary mega evolution I mean again

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.249 
secondary mega evolution I mean again
think<00:01:18.509> about<00:01:18.540> this<00:01:18.780> thing<00:01:18.960> about<00:01:19.110> like

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
think about this thing about like

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.899 
think about this thing about like
Magneton<00:01:20.100> I<00:01:20.900> right<00:01:21.900> on<00:01:22.110> Scizor<00:01:23.040> just<00:01:23.490> a<00:01:23.640> bunch

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
Magneton I right on Scizor just a bunch

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.840 
Magneton I right on Scizor just a bunch
of<00:01:24.060> other<00:01:24.270> things<00:01:25.040> mara<00:01:26.040> I<00:01:26.159> believe<00:01:26.460> azumarill

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
of other things mara I believe azumarill

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.030 
of other things mara I believe azumarill
wasn't<00:01:27.270> 2nd<00:01:27.689> gen<00:01:27.840> just<00:01:28.320> a<00:01:28.409> bunch<00:01:28.590> of<00:01:28.650> things

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
wasn't 2nd gen just a bunch of things

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.130 
wasn't 2nd gen just a bunch of things
that<00:01:29.220> got<00:01:29.460> their<00:01:29.700> third<00:01:30.030> her<00:01:30.390> final<00:01:30.930> mega

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
that got their third her final mega

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.210 
that got their third her final mega
evolution<00:01:31.979> I<00:01:32.009> l'Ã©volution<00:01:32.939> in<00:01:33.860> sinnoh<00:01:34.860> or

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
evolution I l'Ã©volution in sinnoh or

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.700 
evolution I l'Ã©volution in sinnoh or
joto<00:01:35.520> pretty<00:01:35.939> much<00:01:36.090> or<00:01:36.329> even<00:01:36.360> like<00:01:36.900> Hoenn<00:01:37.500> I

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
joto pretty much or even like Hoenn I

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.640 
joto pretty much or even like Hoenn I
guess<00:01:37.920> but<00:01:38.310> mainly<00:01:39.210> I<00:01:39.420> just<00:01:39.840> feel<00:01:40.290> like<00:01:40.439> it's

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
guess but mainly I just feel like it's

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.410 
guess but mainly I just feel like it's
been<00:01:40.860> unfinished<00:01:41.460> it's<00:01:41.759> kind<00:01:42.000> of<00:01:42.150> died<00:01:42.390> down

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
been unfinished it's kind of died down

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.960 
been unfinished it's kind of died down
but<00:01:42.930> gold<00:01:43.380> luck<00:01:43.560> looks<00:01:43.860> awesome<00:01:44.399> I<00:01:44.549> mean<00:01:44.759> yes

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
but gold luck looks awesome I mean yes

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.520 
but gold luck looks awesome I mean yes
he<00:01:45.180> does<00:01:45.360> look<00:01:45.390> really<00:01:45.720> cool<00:01:45.990> i<00:01:46.049> just<00:01:46.350> don't

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
he does look really cool i just don't

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.359 
he does look really cool i just don't
think<00:01:46.640> he's<00:01:47.640> like<00:01:48.030> a<00:01:48.619> final<00:01:49.619> evolution<00:01:49.860> i<00:01:50.159> feel

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
think he's like a final evolution i feel

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:51.200 
think he's like a final evolution i feel
like<00:01:50.490> that<00:01:50.700> there<00:01:50.729> could<00:01:51.090> actually

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
like that there could actually

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.389 
like that there could actually
potentially<00:01:51.720> be<00:01:52.259> a<00:01:52.409> mega<00:01:52.649> evolution<00:01:53.189> for<00:01:53.369> a

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
potentially be a mega evolution for a

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.580 
potentially be a mega evolution for a
doe<00:01:53.520> Golduck<00:01:53.909> and<00:01:54.149> he's<00:01:54.750> also<00:01:54.930> kind<00:01:55.229> of<00:01:55.290> a<00:01:55.409> fan

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
doe Golduck and he's also kind of a fan

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.050 
doe Golduck and he's also kind of a fan
favorite<00:01:55.950> I<00:01:56.009> think<00:01:56.189> a<00:01:56.219> lot<00:01:56.250> of<00:01:56.399> people<00:01:56.520> do<00:01:56.850> like

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
favorite I think a lot of people do like

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.630 
favorite I think a lot of people do like
gold<00:01:57.270> ugh<00:01:57.860> personally<00:01:58.860> I<00:01:58.950> do<00:01:59.070> a<00:01:59.159> lot<00:01:59.399> too<00:01:59.610> and

gold ugh personally I do a lot too and

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.910 
gold ugh personally I do a lot too and
his<00:02:00.180> stats<00:02:00.450> are<00:02:00.659> pretty<00:02:00.869> bad<00:02:01.049> I<00:02:01.350> mean<00:02:01.799> they

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
his stats are pretty bad I mean they

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.560 
his stats are pretty bad I mean they
could<00:02:02.130> be<00:02:02.250> a<00:02:02.280> lot<00:02:02.549> better<00:02:02.729> and<00:02:03.119> that<00:02:03.450> would

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
could be a lot better and that would

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.719 
could be a lot better and that would
just<00:02:03.600> help<00:02:03.810> out<00:02:03.990> a<00:02:04.049> little<00:02:04.229> bit<00:02:04.439> so<00:02:05.219> I<00:02:05.520> don't

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
just help out a little bit so I don't

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:06.889 
just help out a little bit so I don't
know<00:02:05.820> that's<00:02:06.090> what<00:02:06.210> I<00:02:06.240> think<00:02:06.390> about<00:02:06.420> gold<00:02:06.750> bug

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
know that's what I think about gold bug

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.229 
know that's what I think about gold bug
though<00:02:07.340> number<00:02:08.340> four<00:02:08.520> is<00:02:08.640> gonna<00:02:08.789> be<00:02:08.910> Pharaoh

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
though number four is gonna be Pharaoh

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.639 
though number four is gonna be Pharaoh
and<00:02:09.479> I<00:02:09.599> don't<00:02:09.810> know<00:02:09.899> when<00:02:10.200> this<00:02:10.319> is<00:02:10.470> gonna

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
and I don't know when this is gonna

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.050 
and I don't know when this is gonna
happen<00:02:10.830> but<00:02:11.039> I<00:02:11.099> feel<00:02:11.370> like<00:02:11.489> it<00:02:11.670> is<00:02:11.790> going<00:02:11.970> to

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
happen but I feel like it is going to

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.410 
happen but I feel like it is going to
happen

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
happen

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.970 
happen
and<00:02:12.569> that's<00:02:12.840> just<00:02:12.959> basically<00:02:13.349> because<00:02:13.770> its

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
and that's just basically because its

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.860 
and that's just basically because its
counterpart<00:02:14.700> now<00:02:14.849> I<00:02:14.910> know<00:02:15.060> it's<00:02:15.270> not<00:02:15.420> like<00:02:15.720> an

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
counterpart now I know it's not like an

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.410 
counterpart now I know it's not like an
official<00:02:15.959> counterpart<00:02:16.920> but<00:02:17.670> the<00:02:17.790> other<00:02:17.970> bird

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
official counterpart but the other bird

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.020 
official counterpart but the other bird
pokÃ©mon<00:02:18.800> encanto<00:02:19.800> that<00:02:20.040> was<00:02:20.220> you<00:02:20.459> know<00:02:20.550> pretty

highly regarded pidgeot got a mega
evolution<00:02:24.180> so<00:02:24.510> why<00:02:24.720> not<00:02:24.870> Pharaoh<00:02:25.290> Pharaoh

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
evolution so why not Pharaoh Pharaoh

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.250 
evolution so why not Pharaoh Pharaoh
kind<00:02:26.489> of<00:02:26.640> dead<00:02:26.849> it's<00:02:27.209> not<00:02:27.720> really<00:02:27.959> a<00:02:27.989> fan

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260

favorite or anything like that but you

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.660 
favorite or anything like that but you
know<00:02:30.630> what<00:02:31.020> it<00:02:31.380> just<00:02:31.620> game<00:02:31.830> freak<00:02:32.100> I<00:02:32.310> feel<00:02:32.520> like

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
know what it just game freak I feel like

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:33.920 
know what it just game freak I feel like
they<00:02:32.880> would<00:02:33.000> be<00:02:33.150> crazy<00:02:33.360> enough<00:02:33.569> to<00:02:33.750> do

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
they would be crazy enough to do

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.809 
they would be crazy enough to do
something<00:02:34.080> like<00:02:34.230> this<00:02:34.500> just<00:02:34.560> because<00:02:35.220> Pidgeot

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
something like this just because Pidgeot

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:38.090 
something like this just because Pidgeot
has<00:02:36.000> a<00:02:36.030> mega<00:02:36.300> evolution<00:02:36.750> it<00:02:37.380> would<00:02:37.560> give<00:02:37.709> fair

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
has a mega evolution it would give fair

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.490 
has a mega evolution it would give fair
omegaevolution<00:02:38.580> like<00:02:39.269> they've<00:02:40.110> done<00:02:40.319> this

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
omegaevolution like they've done this

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.080 
omegaevolution like they've done this
you<00:02:40.769> know<00:02:40.860> quite<00:02:41.100> a<00:02:41.160> few<00:02:41.280> times<00:02:41.580> as<00:02:41.849> you<00:02:41.940> can

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090

you know quite a few times as you can
tell<00:02:42.269> like<00:02:42.480> their<00:02:42.690> counterpart<00:02:43.230> like<00:02:43.410> you

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
tell like their counterpart like you

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.449 
tell like their counterpart like you
know<00:02:43.650> heracross<00:02:44.870> scissor<00:02:45.870> or<00:02:46.019> pincer<00:02:46.680> whatnot

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
know heracross scissor or pincer whatnot

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.729 
know heracross scissor or pincer whatnot
guys<00:02:48.269> that<00:02:48.510> look<00:02:48.690> like<00:02:48.720> they're<00:02:49.380> gonna<00:02:49.500> get

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
guys that look like they're gonna get

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:53.030 
guys that look like they're gonna get
mega<00:02:49.950> evolutions<00:02:50.959> two<00:02:51.959> dogs<00:02:52.230> metric<00:02:52.920> and

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
mega evolutions two dogs metric and

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.910 
mega evolutions two dogs metric and
houndoom<00:02:53.430> yeah<00:02:53.670> they're<00:02:53.910> not<00:02:54.030> the<00:02:54.299> same

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
houndoom yeah they're not the same

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.259 
houndoom yeah they're not the same
region<00:02:55.920> but<00:02:56.760> they're<00:02:57.690> similar<00:02:58.019> in<00:02:58.200> terms<00:02:58.890> of

00:02:59.259 --> 00:02:59.269 
region but they're similar in terms of

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:02.360 
region but they're similar in terms of
what<00:03:00.269> kind<00:03:00.540> of<00:03:00.630> Pokemon<00:03:00.930> they<00:03:01.319> are<00:03:01.530> in<00:03:01.980> terms

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
what kind of Pokemon they are in terms

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:03.770 
what kind of Pokemon they are in terms
of<00:03:02.519> you<00:03:02.640> know<00:03:02.700> how<00:03:02.910> they<00:03:03.060> look<00:03:03.269> and<00:03:03.450> stuff<00:03:03.660> like

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
of you know how they look and stuff like

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.229 
of you know how they look and stuff like
that<00:03:03.840> I<00:03:04.260> feel<00:03:04.950> like<00:03:05.130> you<00:03:05.370> know<00:03:05.400> eventually<00:03:05.819> it

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
that I feel like you know eventually it

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:07.610 
that I feel like you know eventually it
might<00:03:06.360> not<00:03:06.510> happen<00:03:06.720> anytime<00:03:07.049> soon<00:03:07.230> but

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
might not happen anytime soon but

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.199 
might not happen anytime soon but
eventually<00:03:07.890> that<00:03:08.160> Pharaoh<00:03:08.670> would<00:03:08.819> actually

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
eventually that Pharaoh would actually

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:11.360 
eventually that Pharaoh would actually
get<00:03:09.299> a<00:03:09.360> mega<00:03:09.540> evolution<00:03:10.110> I<00:03:10.290> don't<00:03:10.830> know<00:03:10.920> I<00:03:11.100> feel

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
get a mega evolution I don't know I feel

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.070 
get a mega evolution I don't know I feel
like<00:03:11.580> actually<00:03:12.000> maybe<00:03:12.180> Golduck<00:03:12.720> could<00:03:12.930> get

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
like actually maybe Golduck could get

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.020 
like actually maybe Golduck could get
more<00:03:13.350> than<00:03:13.560> one<00:03:13.739> but<00:03:13.950> just<00:03:14.130> because<00:03:14.340> of<00:03:15.000> the

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
more than one but just because of the

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.849 
more than one but just because of the
fact<00:03:15.299> that<00:03:15.569> pidgeot<00:03:16.049> has<00:03:16.200> one<00:03:16.470> it<00:03:16.620> would<00:03:16.709> feel

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:16.859 
fact that pidgeot has one it would feel

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:18.680 
fact that pidgeot has one it would feel
weird<00:03:16.920> if<00:03:17.430> pharaoh<00:03:17.760> didn't<00:03:18.180> eventually<00:03:18.570> get

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
weird if pharaoh didn't eventually get

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.140 
weird if pharaoh didn't eventually get
to<00:03:18.780> make<00:03:18.870> evolution<00:03:19.410> that's<00:03:19.829> just<00:03:20.040> a<00:03:20.370> very<00:03:20.910> big

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
to make evolution that's just a very big

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.240 
to make evolution that's just a very big
stretch<00:03:21.480> though<00:03:21.750> so<00:03:22.019> who<00:03:22.170> knows<00:03:22.410> alright

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
stretch though so who knows alright

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:24.979 
stretch though so who knows alright
these<00:03:23.400> next<00:03:23.700> three<00:03:23.760> I<00:03:23.940> think<00:03:24.060> have<00:03:24.450> actually<00:03:24.930> a

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
these next three I think have actually a

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:26.750 
these next three I think have actually a
pretty<00:03:25.260> decent<00:03:25.350> chance<00:03:25.980> I<00:03:26.220> just<00:03:26.459> for<00:03:26.700> the

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
pretty decent chance I just for the

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.520 
pretty decent chance I just for the
Kanto<00:03:27.090> region<00:03:27.239> there's<00:03:27.600> just<00:03:27.750> not<00:03:27.959> much<00:03:28.019> I

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
Kanto region there's just not much I

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.009 
Kanto region there's just not much I
think<00:03:28.769> that<00:03:29.489> are<00:03:29.640> going<00:03:29.760> to<00:03:29.820> get<00:03:29.940> megas<00:03:30.209> a<00:03:30.239> lot

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
think that are going to get megas a lot

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:33.020 
think that are going to get megas a lot
of<00:03:31.230> megas<00:03:31.590> came<00:03:31.890> already<00:03:32.220> from<00:03:32.640> the<00:03:32.730> Kanto

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
of megas came already from the Kanto

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.660 
of megas came already from the Kanto
region<00:03:33.500> more<00:03:34.500> than<00:03:34.650> any<00:03:34.829> other<00:03:34.980> region<00:03:35.220> really

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
region more than any other region really

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.370 
region more than any other region really
and<00:03:35.910> can't<00:03:36.299> own<00:03:36.450> Hoenn<00:03:36.720> really<00:03:36.989> so<00:03:37.230> I<00:03:37.730> for<00:03:38.730> this

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.380 
and can't own Hoenn really so I for this

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.199 
and can't own Hoenn really so I for this
arcanine<00:03:40.380> I<00:03:40.650> think<00:03:41.070> would<00:03:41.760> have<00:03:41.940> a<00:03:41.970> decent

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
arcanine I think would have a decent

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:44.900 
arcanine I think would have a decent
shot<00:03:42.570> honestly<00:03:42.840> it<00:03:43.350> is<00:03:43.680> I<00:03:43.950> mean<00:03:44.160> there's

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
shot honestly it is I mean there's

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.479 
shot honestly it is I mean there's
really<00:03:45.120> nothing<00:03:46.079> that<00:03:46.109> says<00:03:46.620> like<00:03:46.680> wow<00:03:47.160> that's

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
really nothing that says like wow that's

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:48.949 
really nothing that says like wow that's
definitely<00:03:47.850> going<00:03:47.970> to<00:03:48.090> get<00:03:48.150> a<00:03:48.209> mega<00:03:48.480> evolution

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
definitely going to get a mega evolution

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:51.650 
definitely going to get a mega evolution

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:09.090 
evolution they do something very similar

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:10.820 
evolution they do something very similar
to<00:05:09.240> butter<00:05:09.870> for<00:05:10.050> you<00:05:10.140> where<00:05:10.350> they<00:05:10.440> would<00:05:10.620> boost

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:10.830 
to butter for you where they would boost

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:12.200 
to butter for you where they would boost
his<00:05:11.040> special<00:05:11.400> attack<00:05:11.640> they<00:05:11.880> had<00:05:11.970> boosted

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:12.210 
his special attack they had boosted

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:15.230 
his special attack they had boosted
speed<00:05:12.780> and<00:05:13.050> just<00:05:13.860> completely<00:05:14.190> destroy<00:05:15.060> its

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:15.240 
speed and just completely destroy its

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.240 
speed and just completely destroy its
attack<00:05:15.540> stat<00:05:15.840> so<00:05:16.170> that<00:05:16.350> way<00:05:16.530> it<00:05:16.830> could<00:05:16.980> become

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:17.250 
attack stat so that way it could become

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:19.280 
attack stat so that way it could become
a<00:05:17.280> mega<00:05:17.520> evolution<00:05:18.060> that's<00:05:18.720> what<00:05:18.960> I<00:05:18.990> think

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:19.290 
a mega evolution that's what I think

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:22.430 
a mega evolution that's what I think
they<00:05:19.410> would<00:05:19.560> do<00:05:19.740> again<00:05:20.280> fan<00:05:20.640> favorite<00:05:21.440> could

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:22.440 
they would do again fan favorite could

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.770 
they would do again fan favorite could
be<00:05:22.560> a<00:05:22.590> lot<00:05:22.980> better<00:05:23.220> and<00:05:24.180> it<00:05:24.390> just<00:05:24.600> its

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:24.780 
be a lot better and it just its

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:26.390 
be a lot better and it just its
counterpart<00:05:25.290> Beedrill<00:05:25.650> has<00:05:25.740> mega<00:05:25.980> evolution

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 
counterpart Beedrill has mega evolution

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.790 
counterpart Beedrill has mega evolution
so<00:05:26.520> I<00:05:26.550> feel<00:05:26.850> really<00:05:26.880> strong<00:05:27.600> about<00:05:27.630> this<00:05:28.590> thing

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:28.800 
so I feel really strong about this thing

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.440 
so I feel really strong about this thing
eventually<00:05:29.130> getting<00:05:29.580> a<00:05:29.700> mega<00:05:29.910> evolution

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:30.450

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:34.640 
evolutions they've done it quite a bit
as<00:06:31.710> of<00:06:31.860> late<00:06:32.040> um<00:06:32.310> and<00:06:33.150> it<00:06:34.140> just<00:06:34.200> feels<00:06:34.470> weird

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:34.650 
as of late um and it just feels weird

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:36.560 
as of late um and it just feels weird
that<00:06:35.040> to<00:06:35.190> see<00:06:35.400> that<00:06:36.000> this<00:06:36.180> thing<00:06:36.390> already

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:36.570 
that to see that this thing already

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:38.210 
that to see that this thing already
doesn't<00:06:37.169> have<00:06:37.350> one

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:38.220 
doesn't have one

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:39.920 
doesn't have one
and<00:06:38.340> it<00:06:38.640> will<00:06:38.700> probably<00:06:39.000> get<00:06:39.240> one<00:06:39.390> in<00:06:39.570> the<00:06:39.660> next

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:39.930 
and it will probably get one in the next

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:42.200 
and it will probably get one in the next
game<00:06:40.080> or<00:06:40.260> so<00:06:40.440> it<00:06:40.680> just<00:06:40.890> feels<00:06:41.130> really<00:06:41.850> really

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:42.210 
game or so it just feels really really

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:44.090 
game or so it just feels really really
weird<00:06:43.050> that<00:06:43.350> he<00:06:43.530> doesn't<00:06:43.680> already<00:06:43.800> have<00:06:43.980> a

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:44.100 
weird that he doesn't already have a

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:45.440 
weird that he doesn't already have a
mega<00:06:44.310> evolution<00:06:44.730> but<00:06:44.880> I<00:06:44.940> think<00:06:45.300> you'd

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:45.450 
mega evolution but I think you'd

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:47.900 
mega evolution but I think you'd
probably<00:06:45.720> get<00:06:45.960> one<00:06:46.080> a<00:06:46.140> next<00:06:46.470> scene<00:06:46.590> y'see<00:06:47.070> well

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:47.910 
probably get one a next scene y'see well

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:49.340 
probably get one a next scene y'see well
