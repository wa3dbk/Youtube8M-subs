a race inspired um it has sapphire

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.990 
a race inspired um it has sapphire
crystal<00:01:00.719> I<00:01:00.870> believe<00:01:01.320> it's<00:01:01.590> front<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:02.670> back

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
crystal I believe it's front and back

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.130 
crystal I believe it's front and back
I'm<00:01:03.390> not<00:01:04.199> 100%<00:01:04.650> sure<00:01:05.159> of<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.820> back<00:01:06.030> a<00:01:06.390> lot<00:01:06.990> of

times watchmakers will save money by

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.810 
times watchmakers will save money by

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
case back um so I'm not sure it could be

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.800 
case back um so I'm not sure it could be
mineral<00:01:16.920> crystal<00:01:17.369> but<00:01:17.580> I'm<00:01:18.330> just<00:01:18.450> gonna<00:01:18.630> go

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
mineral crystal but I'm just gonna go

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.240 
mineral crystal but I'm just gonna go
out<00:01:18.900> on<00:01:18.930> a<00:01:19.080> limb<00:01:19.259> and<00:01:19.380> say<00:01:19.439> it's<00:01:19.590> sapphire

markers around the bezel here you have a

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.620 
markers around the bezel here you have a
day<00:01:45.880> date<00:01:46.180> window<00:01:48.030> you<00:01:49.030> have<00:01:49.180> this<00:01:49.300> nice<00:01:49.600> big

day date window you have this nice big
red<00:01:51.900> second<00:01:52.900> hand<00:01:53.970> which<00:01:54.970> i<00:01:55.090> think<00:01:55.180> is<00:01:55.420> pretty

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 
red second hand which i think is pretty

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.910 
red second hand which i think is pretty
cool

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.380 

the<00:02:00.090> case<00:02:01.090> is<00:02:01.479> 42<00:02:02.350> millimeters<00:02:02.890> wide<00:02:03.210> so<00:02:04.210> it's

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
the case is 42 millimeters wide so it's

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.880 
the case is 42 millimeters wide so it's
a<00:02:04.680> rather<00:02:05.680> small<00:02:06.610> watch<00:02:07.060> um<00:02:07.990> I<00:02:08.050> mean<00:02:08.619> it's<00:02:08.770> not

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
a rather small watch um I mean it's not

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.910 
a rather small watch um I mean it's not
tiny<00:02:09.160> by<00:02:09.399> any<00:02:09.550> means<00:02:09.820> but<00:02:10.119> it's<00:02:10.350> I'd<00:02:11.350> say<00:02:11.770> it's

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
tiny by any means but it's I'd say it's

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.060 
tiny by any means but it's I'd say it's
a<00:02:12.120> small<00:02:13.120> to<00:02:13.420> medium<00:02:13.810> and<00:02:14.050> its<00:02:14.350> overall<00:02:14.650> size

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070 
a small to medium and its overall size

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.790 
a small to medium and its overall size
although<00:02:15.550> I<00:02:16.270> like<00:02:16.870> the<00:02:17.020> way<00:02:17.140> it<00:02:17.260> wears<00:02:17.470> it

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
although I like the way it wears it

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.730 
although I like the way it wears it
wears<00:02:18.070> pretty<00:02:18.490> big<00:02:18.760> um<00:02:19.750> you<00:02:20.590> know<00:02:20.680> I

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:20.740 
wears pretty big um you know I

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.760 
wears pretty big um you know I
definitely<00:02:21.930> don't<00:02:22.930> think<00:02:23.230> it's<00:02:23.410> too<00:02:23.590> small

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
definitely don't think it's too small

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.830 
definitely don't think it's too small
yeah<00:02:24.610> I<00:02:24.640> like<00:02:25.270> what<00:02:25.480> larger<00:02:26.260> watches<00:02:26.680> so<00:02:27.840> it's

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
yeah I like what larger watches so it's

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.390 
yeah I like what larger watches so it's
not<00:02:28.959> too<00:02:29.170> small<00:02:29.410> for<00:02:29.590> me<00:02:30.660> the<00:02:31.769> case<00:02:32.769> thickness

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
not too small for me the case thickness

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.550 
not too small for me the case thickness
is<00:02:34.290> about<00:02:35.290> eleven<00:02:35.709> and<00:02:35.769> a<00:02:35.860> half<00:02:35.890> millimeters

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
is about eleven and a half millimeters

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.140 
is about eleven and a half millimeters
it's<00:02:38.560> got<00:02:38.709> a<00:02:38.739> nice<00:02:38.950> stainless<00:02:39.400> steel<00:02:40.260> bracelet

see<00:04:34.060> there

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:36.780 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:38.960 

and<00:04:37.290> it's<00:04:37.410> kind<00:04:37.620> of<00:04:37.680> zoomed<00:04:37.950> up<00:04:38.160> so<00:04:38.490> it's<00:04:38.850> going

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970 
and it's kind of zoomed up so it's going

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:41.710 
and it's kind of zoomed up so it's going
to<00:04:39.030> look<00:04:39.210> larger<00:04:39.720> than<00:04:39.870> it<00:04:40.020> really<00:04:40.110> is<00:04:40.320> but<00:04:41.250> uh

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:41.720 
to look larger than it really is but uh

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.690 
to look larger than it really is but uh
let's<00:04:42.720> say<00:04:42.900> I<00:04:42.960> have<00:04:43.140> medium<00:04:43.650> to<00:04:43.860> large<00:04:44.070> wrists

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:44.700 
let's say I have medium to large wrists

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:48.410 
let's say I have medium to large wrists
so<00:04:44.940> it's<00:04:45.120> uh<00:04:45.240> it's<00:04:45.660> a<00:04:46.500> decent<00:04:46.860> size<00:04:47.090> it's<00:04:48.090> a<00:04:48.180> big

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:48.420 
so it's uh it's a decent size it's a big

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:53.810 
so it's uh it's a decent size it's a big
42<00:04:48.990> millimeter<00:04:50.990> and<00:04:51.990> it's<00:04:52.830> a<00:04:53.010> it<00:04:53.310> feels<00:04:53.610> really

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:53.820 
42 millimeter and it's a it feels really

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:57.110 
42 millimeter and it's a it feels really
nice<00:04:54.060> on<00:04:54.270> the<00:04:54.420> wrist<00:04:54.600> too<00:04:55.790> it's<00:04:56.790> got<00:04:56.880> a<00:04:56.940> nice

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 
nice on the wrist too it's got a nice

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:10.250 
nice on the wrist too it's got a nice
weight<00:04:57.390> to<00:04:57.450> it
