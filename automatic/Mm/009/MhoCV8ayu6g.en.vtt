we're doing yeah so let's try a dry bite
on<00:00:40.649> this<00:00:40.770> first<00:00:41.070> all<00:00:41.340> right<00:00:41.489> looks<00:00:41.850> like

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
on this first all right looks like

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.700

popcorn chicken it looks like it yeah
it's<00:00:43.920> it<00:00:44.070> I'm<00:00:44.250> guessing<00:00:44.850> it's<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.000> same<00:00:45.210> kind

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.290 
Silver's right not much flavor yeah it's
not<00:00:53.129> a<00:00:53.160> very<00:00:53.280> strong<00:00:53.520> flavor<00:00:53.760> for<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.030> meet<00:00:54.180> a

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
not a very strong flavor for the meet a

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.819 
not a very strong flavor for the meet a
lot<00:00:54.449> of<00:00:54.510> it<00:00:54.660> comes<00:00:54.780> from<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.110> breading<00:00:55.680> I'm

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
lot of it comes from the breading I'm

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.560 
lot of it comes from the breading I'm
