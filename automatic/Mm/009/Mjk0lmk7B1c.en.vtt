times this particular steak will roll

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.280 
times this particular steak will roll

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
when you cook it in a roll and it takes

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.160 
when you cook it in a roll and it takes
like<00:00:43.620> an<00:00:43.829> arch<00:00:44.100> so<00:00:44.850> to<00:00:44.910> prevent<00:00:45.480> it<00:00:45.660> from<00:00:45.690> doing

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
like an arch so to prevent it from doing

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.910 
like an arch so to prevent it from doing
that<00:00:46.500> you<00:00:47.039> just<00:00:47.280> take<00:00:47.550> your<00:00:47.730> kitchen<00:00:48.270> shears

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 
that you just take your kitchen shears

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:54.770 
that you just take your kitchen shears
and<00:00:50.030> you<00:00:51.030> cut<00:00:51.449> a<00:00:51.980> little<00:00:53.000> opening<00:00:54.000> in<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.449> fact

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
and you cut a little opening in the fact

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.709 
and you cut a little opening in the fact
because<00:00:55.079> what<00:00:55.530> that<00:00:55.800> does<00:00:56.100> is<00:00:56.460> it<00:00:56.789> keeps<00:00:57.030> the

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
because what that does is it keeps the

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.950 
because what that does is it keeps the
fat<00:00:58.109> from<00:00:58.440> causing<00:00:58.829> it<00:00:59.280> to<00:00:59.879> roll<00:01:00.149> up<00:01:00.449> like<00:01:00.719> this

fat from causing it to roll up like this

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.260

I'm gonna let these just cook on this

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:24.460 
I'm gonna let these just cook on this
side<00:04:22.220> for<00:04:22.460> a<00:04:22.550> few<00:04:22.580> minutes<00:04:23.060> and<00:04:23.180> then<00:04:24.110> I've<00:04:24.260> got

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:24.470 
side for a few minutes and then I've got

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:26.800 
side for a few minutes and then I've got
to<00:04:24.710> get<00:04:25.340> back<00:04:25.610> to<00:04:25.790> you<00:04:25.940> when<00:04:26.150> we<00:04:26.270> get<00:04:26.450> ready<00:04:26.600> to

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.550 
turn them about eight minutes and I

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.430 
turn them about eight minutes and I
think<00:04:28.790> that<00:04:28.940> the<00:04:29.060> steaks<00:04:29.390> are<00:04:29.660> ready<00:04:29.900> to<00:04:30.169> turn

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.440 
think that the steaks are ready to turn

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.180 
think that the steaks are ready to turn
so<00:04:31.310> I'm<00:04:31.490> just<00:04:31.790> going<00:04:32.120> to<00:04:32.210> turn<00:04:32.800> the<00:04:33.800> steaks

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:34.190

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:33.810 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:36.530 

and<00:05:34.560> that's<00:05:34.740> all<00:05:34.920> you<00:05:35.070> need<00:05:35.280> to<00:05:35.430> do<00:05:35.580> so<00:05:36.510> that

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:40.430 
and that's all you need to do so that
was<00:05:36.900> a<00:05:36.930> good<00:05:37.170> example<00:05:37.920> of<00:05:38.130> how<00:05:38.790> this<00:05:39.750> process

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:40.440 
was a good example of how this process

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.950 
was a good example of how this process
actually<00:05:40.680> works<00:05:41.370> and<00:05:42.000> again<00:05:42.360> I'm<00:05:42.570> cooking

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:42.960 
actually works and again I'm cooking

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:48.170 
actually works and again I'm cooking
with<00:05:42.990> a<00:05:45.950> charcoal<00:05:46.950> grill<00:05:47.250> so<00:05:47.850> it's<00:05:47.970> a<00:05:48.030> little

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:48.180 
with a charcoal grill so it's a little

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:50.780 
with a charcoal grill so it's a little
bit<00:05:48.389> different<00:05:48.630> than<00:05:49.560> cooking<00:05:49.860> with<00:05:50.340> your<00:05:50.520> gas

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:50.790 
bit different than cooking with your gas

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:53.390 
bit different than cooking with your gas
wheels<00:05:51.240> but<00:05:51.419> I<00:05:51.510> like<00:05:51.690> the<00:05:51.870> flavor<00:05:52.230> that<00:05:52.620> comes

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:53.400 
wheels but I like the flavor that comes

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:56.000 
wheels but I like the flavor that comes
from<00:05:53.940> the<00:05:54.120> charcoal<00:05:54.540> grill<00:05:54.840> thank<00:05:55.620> you<00:05:55.800> when

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:57.890 
from the charcoal grill thank you when
they<00:05:56.100> don't<00:05:56.790> have<00:05:56.940> to<00:05:57.030> take<00:05:57.270> the<00:05:57.419> steaks<00:05:57.720> off

00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:57.900 
they don't have to take the steaks off

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:59.510 
they don't have to take the steaks off
the<00:05:58.110> grill<00:05:58.350> and<00:05:58.530> as<00:05:58.680> you<00:05:58.800> can<00:05:58.980> see<00:05:59.160> I<00:05:59.190> already

00:05:59.510 --> 00:05:59.520 
the grill and as you can see I already

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:00.950

some<00:06:01.440> of<00:06:01.590> them<00:06:01.710> will<00:06:01.919> need<00:06:02.100> a<00:06:02.160> little<00:06:02.430> bit<00:06:02.580> more

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:03.000 
some of them will need a little bit more

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.210 
some of them will need a little bit more
cooking<00:06:03.540> time<00:06:03.570> because<00:06:04.560> they<00:06:04.710> were<00:06:04.830> so<00:06:05.040> much

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:05.220 
cooking time because they were so much

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:07.190 
cooking time because they were so much
thicker<00:06:05.550> than<00:06:05.880> the<00:06:06.030> other<00:06:06.300> but<00:06:06.990> these

should be a good cut of meat because

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:50.510 
should be a good cut of meat because
it's<00:06:48.870> been<00:06:49.050> cooked<00:06:49.320> down<00:06:49.440> on<00:06:49.919> the<00:06:50.010> charcoal

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:52.670 
it's been cooked down on the charcoal
grill<00:06:50.580> so<00:06:51.030> you<00:06:51.060> got<00:06:51.270> smoke<00:06:51.750> flavor<00:06:52.110> that's

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:52.680 
grill so you got smoke flavor that's
