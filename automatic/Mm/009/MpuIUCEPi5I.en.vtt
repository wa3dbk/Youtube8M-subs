00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.190
 during the next few minutes this video 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.029
 it's fit about the incredible breakthrough 

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:28.349
 Technological of orthodontics from 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.360
 grow all artists from around the world 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.880
 treat their patients with a technique 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:34.470
 innovative called game and breaker is 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.830
 happening something extraordinary in the 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:39.059
 orthodontics for many years was split 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:41.160
 from the idea that the necessary forces 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.200
 to move the teeth depending on the 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.810
 level of pain tolerance 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.640
 thanks to the dÃ¡in a break the system that 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:49.380
 uses hooks and dental wires from 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.360
 high technology is now possible 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.920
 take advantage of light biological forces 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.690
 to move the teeth in a way 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.240
 totally new ever seen 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.350
 previously orthodontics 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.850
 surprisingly there are patients of all 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.680
 ages that enjoy a 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.260
 better and much shorter treatment 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.700
 duration and in all parts of the world 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.410
 there are patients who observe a change 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.750
 incredible in the look of his face and in 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:13.030
 his smile is like a miracle 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.980
 in this video we will see people up close 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:18.230
 as you and I have experienced 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:20.930
 a metamorphosis in your life 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:23.090
 they feel better and more confident they enjoy 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:26.110
 more of life and simply said it 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.110
 they feel more attractive 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.560
 every day countless patients try 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:35.570
 improve the condition of your teeth and 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.070
 his jaws in most of the 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.890
 cases must withstand extractions 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:42.020
 painful in addition patients must 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.610
 support orthodontic appliances and other 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.159
 uncomfortable remedial measures 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.049
 The timing system is capable of much more 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:50.990
 that not only correct the teeth 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:54.310
 twisted the dating system embellishes the 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.310
 physical appearance of the face 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.950
 it's a very widespread mistake to think 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.590
 that all project systems 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.330
 were the same today because of the 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.710
 great variety of systems is very 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.810
 important that patients or their 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.340
 parents carefully choose the 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.590
 braces and orthodontic treatment 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.720
 suitable 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.700
 the theme exists not only brings a beautiful 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.530
 smile and right teeth but that 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.900
 also considers physical changes the 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.610
 face over time and this 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.580
 mode slows down the process 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.319
 aging most people 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.500
 think that crooked teeth are due 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:33.180
 To the jaws too narrow a 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.709
 dental stacking like this 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.510
 almost always required the extraction of 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:38.549
 the permanent teeth followed by 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.440
 orthodontic appliances wires and forts 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:43.260
 pressures to get an arcade 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.450
 narrow though these teeth are 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.069
 perfectly show studies rights 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.900
 in the long term, check the influence 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:50.069
 negative of a dental arch too much 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.989
 narrow about the process of 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:55.349
 aging of the jaws face 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:56.489
 and of the tissue the fear system focuses 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:59.190
 this problem in a totally 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.930
 different 300 studies show that no 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.640
 they are only jaws too 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.010
 narrow those that cause teeth 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.569
 crooked but that these are due to a 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.239
 imbalance between the language and 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:10.709
 facial muscles with damon systems 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:13.840
 orthodontist can take advantage of 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:15.940
 soft biological forces 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.750
 in this way his dental arches 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.860
 they adopt the natural form 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.020
 it is interesting to see how the crowding 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.470
 disappears in favor of a dental arch 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.470
 natural 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:30.129
 as is the subject there are capable of 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.330
 perform this wonder on the face 

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:35.660
 because it uses the most modern materials 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:37.129
 and the most advanced technology 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.349
 innovative technology wires 

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:43.239
 space have memory function and 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:43.239
 returns very slowly to its original form 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.220
 contrary to the hooks 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.290
 conventional ones that are fixed to 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.790
 teeth under a very strong pressure the 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.860
 of the system uses devices from 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.840
 orthodontics specially designed that 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:58.780
 they allow the wires to slide and 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.130
 they move freely an advantage 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.630
 additional is the innovative design of the 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:03.610
 most recent generation of the day men 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:06.810
 system this design brings to the 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:09.190
 patients a more natural look 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:12.130
 now orthodontists exercise 100 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:14.450
 times less pressure on each tooth 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:16.610
 this helps the denture to heal and 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.230
 create more space and an arcade shape 

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:22.190
 of enters more naturally for 

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:24.170
 avoid dental crowding the 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:26.120
 latest scientific research that 

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:28.040
 uses the most advanced technologies of 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:29.780
 the image clearly demonstrate the 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.580
 Advantages of moving the teeth through 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:35.360
 forces that work in harmony with the 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:37.250
 body using biological forces 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.750
 of the body the teeth and bones are 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:40.340
 can move at the same time creating a 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:43.040
 smile and an aspect of the face more 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:44.990
 natural is with the treatments of 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.520
 Traditional orthodontics to this patient 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:48.410
 he should have extracted the 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:51.410
 teeth resulting in your smile more 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:53.300
 narrow and its face more flat the subject 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:55.550
 There is visibly improvement in aesthetics 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:58.630
 of the face during growth and 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:58.630
 maturation of the patient 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:03.630
 I only hoped that the teeth 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.630
 straighten 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:08.720
 but the result is much better than 

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:08.720
 what I thought 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:13.930
 after only a month and a half 

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:15.790
 wearing the orthodontic appliance note 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:18.300
 the change speaks to me and the look of me 

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:18.300
 teeth 

00:05:20.649 --> 00:05:26.059
 and now I can smile while I speak 

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:28.489
 with you I was not able before 

00:05:26.059 --> 00:05:31.300
 simple reaction and that's why the result 

00:05:28.489 --> 00:05:31.300
 is incredible 

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:39.570
 I am proud of having submitted to 

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:41.820
 this treatment before I felt 

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:43.950
 self-conscious about my smile and while 

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:46.200
 I was aging the appearance of my mouth 

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:49.220
 changing this change proves 

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:49.220
 clearly the age 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:55.870
 and of course after the correction of 

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:57.250
 teeth changes the physical appearance but 

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:59.469
 without noticing it also changes something 

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:02.219
 within yourself and the confidence that 

00:05:59.469 --> 00:06:02.219
 it makes sense 

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:08.509
 and now when he entered the room 

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:12.400
 where there are other people I behave 

00:06:08.509 --> 00:06:12.400
 another way I feel more free 

00:06:15.289 --> 00:06:18.710
 for me the most important aspect to the 

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.869
 time to correct the teeth of my 

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:23.300
 children was the fact that they acquired 

00:06:20.869 --> 00:06:25.940
 more self-confidence 

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:27.620
 I think that is very important 

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:29.180
 physical aspect determines in what way 

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:33.229
 other people perceive my children 

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:34.639
 throughout his life really my 

00:06:33.229 --> 00:06:37.240
 Right teeth make me feel very 

00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:39.470
 proud but before I was rather shy 

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:46.430
 Now I am more open and I feel more 

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:48.860
 I'm sure I have some teeth 

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:50.479
 rights using the game in system is 

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:53.360
 one of the most important things that 

00:06:50.479 --> 00:06:57.039
 parents can do for their children 

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:57.039
 it's like a gift for life 

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:01.300
 wife 

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:06.930
 all the patients that you finish 

00:07:05.069 --> 00:07:08.669
 to see have received a treatment 

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:11.069
 totally different from the treatment of 

00:07:08.669 --> 00:07:12.660
 traditional orthodontics the day men 

00:07:11.069 --> 00:07:14.490
 system offers patients a level 

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:16.680
 of maximum quality care for 

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:19.440
 feel better and more comfortable in a 

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:21.630
 shorter period of time besides 

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:24.139
 improves your physical appearance in a way 

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:28.009
 extraordinary with the day men system 

00:07:24.139 --> 00:07:28.009
 indeed the future has come
