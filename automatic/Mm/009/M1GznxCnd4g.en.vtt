00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
or so of the length then we can take a

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.820 
or so of the length then we can take a
little<00:02:22.820> bit<00:02:22.940> of<00:02:23.030> glue<00:02:23.300> and<00:02:23.540> attach<00:02:24.170> the<00:02:24.560> thread

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
to the tip in this way and after we have

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.610 
to the tip in this way and after we have
done<00:02:28.790> so<00:02:29.090> we<00:02:29.660> can<00:02:29.840> take<00:02:30.050> a<00:02:30.080> little<00:02:30.320> piece<00:02:30.590> of
