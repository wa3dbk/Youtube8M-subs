got a black egg sacs if you turn over a
lot<00:01:33.000> of<00:01:33.090> your<00:01:33.180> stone<00:01:33.390> slice<00:01:33.660> your<00:01:34.050> females<00:01:34.590> the

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
lot of your stone slice your females the

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.260 
lot of your stone slice your females the
ones<00:01:34.890> you<00:01:35.010> find<00:01:35.190> mostly<00:01:35.520> on<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.729> water<00:01:35.970> have<00:01:36.210> a

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
big black egg sack on nice what size

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.240 
big black egg sack on nice what size
this<00:01:43.530> one's<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:43.860> size<00:01:44.070> eight<00:01:44.790> but<00:01:46.250> probably

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
this one's the size eight but probably

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.890 
this one's the size eight but probably
could<00:01:47.400> throw<00:01:47.580> six<00:01:47.880> is<00:01:48.060> probably<00:01:48.660> your<00:01:48.840> best

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:48.900 
could throw six is probably your best

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.960 
could throw six is probably your best
sides<00:01:49.290> I<00:01:49.500> just<00:01:49.710> ran<00:01:49.860> out<00:01:50.010> of<00:01:50.040> six<00:01:50.310> what<00:01:50.850> are

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
sides I just ran out of six what are

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.460 
sides I just ran out of six what are
like<00:01:51.150> comparable<00:01:51.630> patterns<00:01:52.020> that<00:01:52.170> people

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
like comparable patterns that people

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:53.930 
like comparable patterns that people
might<00:01:52.620> recognize<00:01:53.130> that<00:01:53.310> are<00:01:53.460> similar<00:01:53.640> to<00:01:53.760> that

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:53.940 
might recognize that are similar to that

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.480 
might recognize that are similar to that
you<00:01:54.090> think<00:01:54.290> well<00:01:55.290> you<00:01:55.380> know<00:01:55.470> I<00:01:55.500> like<00:01:56.010> anything

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
you think well you know I like anything

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.230 
you think well you know I like anything
foam<00:01:56.820> with<00:01:57.750> rubber<00:01:57.990> legs<00:01:58.730> that<00:01:59.730> floats<00:01:59.970> good

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
foam with rubber legs that floats good

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.020 
foam with rubber legs that floats good
so<00:02:00.750> you<00:02:00.840> can<00:02:01.040> you<00:02:02.040> could<00:02:02.190> mend<00:02:02.490> it<00:02:02.670> and<00:02:02.820> it

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
so you can you could mend it and it

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.240 
so you can you could mend it and it
doesn't<00:02:03.360> sink<00:02:03.600> down<00:02:03.840> we<00:02:04.409> got<00:02:04.560> heavy<00:02:04.740> currents

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
doesn't sink down we got heavy currents

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.640 
doesn't sink down we got heavy currents
and<00:02:05.390> anything<00:02:06.390> that<00:02:06.420> you<00:02:07.170> know<00:02:07.290> it<00:02:07.440> really

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:07.650 
and anything that you know it really

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:09.620 
and anything that you know it really
doesn't<00:02:08.489> have<00:02:08.580> foam<00:02:08.850> in<00:02:09.000> it<00:02:09.060> seems<00:02:09.330> if<00:02:09.510> you

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
doesn't have foam in it seems if you

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.210 
doesn't have foam in it seems if you
mend<00:02:09.869> it<00:02:10.019> hard<00:02:10.200> and<00:02:10.410> heavy<00:02:10.530> currents<00:02:11.010> going<00:02:11.130> to

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
mend it hard and heavy currents going to

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.640 
mend it hard and heavy currents going to
sink<00:02:11.580> so<00:02:12.180> I<00:02:12.239> like<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:12.510> stuff<00:02:12.750> that<00:02:12.930> pops<00:02:13.350> right

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
sink so I like the stuff that pops right

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.290 
sink so I like the stuff that pops right
back<00:02:13.830> up<00:02:13.890> and<00:02:14.280> you<00:02:14.400> can<00:02:14.519> fish<00:02:14.760> right<00:02:15.000> after

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
back up and you can fish right after

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.090 
back up and you can fish right after
those<00:02:15.450> rocks<00:02:15.750> where<00:02:16.050> the<00:02:16.170> fish<00:02:16.590> are<00:02:16.739> what's

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
those rocks where the fish are what's

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.259 
those rocks where the fish are what's
