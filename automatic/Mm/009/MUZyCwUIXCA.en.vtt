00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
power pc users now I believe powerpc is

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.260 
power pc users now I believe powerpc is
the<00:01:15.630> is<00:01:16.200> a<00:01:16.950> core<00:01:17.430> that<00:01:17.909> is<00:01:17.970> developed<00:01:18.450> by<00:01:18.540> IBM

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
the is a core that is developed by IBM

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.920 
the is a core that is developed by IBM
so<00:01:21.270> yeah<00:01:21.960> I<00:01:21.990> I'm<00:01:22.740> not<00:01:23.130> sure<00:01:23.430> really<00:01:23.700> is<00:01:24.210> us<00:01:24.600> all

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
so yeah I I'm not sure really is us all

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.710 
so yeah I I'm not sure really is us all
I<00:01:24.960> know<00:01:25.140> about<00:01:25.560> piracy<00:01:26.130> is<00:01:26.490> I<00:01:27.060> know<00:01:27.360> there<00:01:27.689> are

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
you know like java 7 or 8 because we

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.280 
you know like java 7 or 8 because we

00:02:15.179 --> 00:02:15.189 
I think now 700 them but um yeah pretty

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:16.619 
I think now 700 them but um yeah pretty
much<00:02:15.280> they're<00:02:15.609> dropping<00:02:15.879> support<00:02:16.150> for<00:02:16.450> both

00:02:16.619 --> 00:02:16.629 
much they're dropping support for both

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:19.619 
much they're dropping support for both
of<00:02:16.810> them<00:02:16.900> so<00:02:17.620> hopefully<00:02:18.579> lot<00:02:19.090> not<00:02:19.420> a<00:02:19.450> lot<00:02:19.510> of
