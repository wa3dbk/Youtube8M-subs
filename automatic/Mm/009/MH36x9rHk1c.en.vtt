00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
of tactics i'm using because it may look

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.259 
of tactics i'm using because it may look
like<00:00:23.220> i'm<00:00:23.460> just<00:00:23.670> running<00:00:23.760> around<00:00:23.970> shooting

like i'm just running around shooting

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:25.790 
like i'm just running around shooting
things<00:00:24.630> but<00:00:25.140> there's<00:00:25.289> a<00:00:25.350> lot<00:00:25.500> more<00:00:25.529> thought

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
things but there's a lot more thought

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.670 
things but there's a lot more thought
that<00:00:25.980> goes<00:00:26.070> into<00:00:26.160> the<00:00:26.789> build<00:00:27.599> itself<00:00:27.960> first

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
that goes into the build itself first

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.380 
that goes into the build itself first
off<00:00:28.859> i<00:00:28.980> want<00:00:29.010> to<00:00:29.220> mention<00:00:29.310> that<00:00:29.519> you<00:00:30.150> don't

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
off i want to mention that you don't

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.200 
off i want to mention that you don't
need<00:00:30.599> etec<00:00:31.050> /<00:00:31.470> plasma<00:00:32.309> weapons<00:00:32.640> for<00:00:32.850> this<00:00:33.000> i

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
need etec / plasma weapons for this i

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.970 
need etec / plasma weapons for this i
personally<00:00:34.050> use<00:00:34.079> them<00:00:34.410> because<00:00:34.530> they've<00:00:34.800> got

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
personally use them because they've got

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.950 
personally use them because they've got
such<00:00:35.219> high<00:00:35.399> damage<00:00:35.640> output<00:00:35.910> and<00:00:36.329> high<00:00:36.719> fire

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
such high damage output and high fire

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.430 
such high damage output and high fire
rate<00:00:38.030> it's<00:00:39.030> for<00:00:39.629> maximum<00:00:40.020> maximum

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
rate it's for maximum maximum

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.810 
rate it's for maximum maximum
effectiveness<00:00:41.160> you're<00:00:41.430> going<00:00:41.550> to<00:00:41.610> want<00:00:41.730> to

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
effectiveness you're going to want to

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.510 
effectiveness you're going to want to
use<00:00:42.239> one<00:00:42.870> of<00:00:42.899> these<00:00:43.020> but<00:00:43.469> I<00:00:43.739> recognize<00:00:44.489> that

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
use one of these but I recognize that

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.010 
use one of these but I recognize that
they're<00:00:44.879> not<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.149> easiest<00:00:45.450> to<00:00:45.600> find<00:00:45.780> and

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
they're not the easiest to find and

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.630 
they're not the easiest to find and
especially<00:00:46.289> lower<00:00:46.710> levels<00:00:47.100> you're<00:00:47.340> not<00:00:47.489> going

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
especially lower levels you're not going

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.400 
especially lower levels you're not going
to<00:00:47.700> be<00:00:47.789> finding<00:00:48.120> many<00:00:48.270> of<00:00:48.390> these<00:00:48.480> they're<00:00:49.079> very

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
to be finding many of these they're very

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.720 
to be finding many of these they're very
rare<00:00:49.649> drop<00:00:49.950> so<00:00:50.899> moving<00:00:51.899> on<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.980> events<00:00:53.309> tactic

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
rare drop so moving on the events tactic

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.150 
rare drop so moving on the events tactic
so<00:00:53.940> I'm<00:00:54.180> really<00:00:54.329> going<00:00:54.539> to<00:00:54.629> go<00:00:54.750> over<00:00:54.949> only<00:00:55.949> one

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
so I'm really going to go over only one

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.549 
so I'm really going to go over only one
major<00:00:56.370> one<00:00:56.670> and<00:00:56.969> that<00:00:57.120> is<00:00:57.329> how<00:00:58.140> you<00:00:58.170> want<00:00:58.469> to

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
major one and that is how you want to

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.770 
major one and that is how you want to
work<00:00:58.739> discord<00:00:59.340> into<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.699> build<00:00:59.879> discord<00:01:00.660> in

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
work discord into the build discord in

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.189 
work discord into the build discord in
rational<00:01:01.170> anarchist<00:01:01.789> sow<00:01:02.789> discord

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:03.199 
rational anarchist sow discord

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:05.960 
rational anarchist sow discord
essentially<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.559> goal<00:01:04.860> of<00:01:05.159> this<00:01:05.339> is<00:01:05.640> to<00:01:05.670> keep

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
essentially the goal of this is to keep

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.359 
essentially the goal of this is to keep
discord<00:01:06.450> running<00:01:06.810> throughout<00:01:07.650> your<00:01:08.010> battles

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
discord running throughout your battles

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.100 
discord running throughout your battles
so<00:01:08.729> whenever<00:01:09.119> you're<00:01:09.299> in<00:01:09.360> combat<00:01:09.720> you're

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
so whenever you're in combat you're

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.200 
so whenever you're in combat you're
gonna<00:01:10.320> want<00:01:11.040> to<00:01:11.100> have<00:01:11.310> this<00:01:11.460> cord<00:01:11.700> running<00:01:11.909> so

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
gonna want to have this cord running so

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.399 
gonna want to have this cord running so
ninety<00:01:12.570> to<00:01:12.689> a<00:01:12.720> hundred<00:01:12.810> percent<00:01:13.260> of<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.350> time

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
ninety to a hundred percent of the time

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.800 
ninety to a hundred percent of the time
you're<00:01:14.159> going<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.369> want<00:01:14.520> discord<00:01:14.970> to<00:01:15.210> be

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
you're going to want discord to be

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.320 
you're going to want discord to be
active<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.470> draining<00:01:16.890> your<00:01:16.979> sex<00:01:17.250> how<00:01:17.970> that<00:01:18.150> is

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
active and draining your sex how that is

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.149 
active and draining your sex how that is
made<00:01:18.509> possible<00:01:18.720> is<00:01:19.170> through<00:01:19.439> rational

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
made possible is through rational

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.539 
made possible is through rational
anarchist<00:01:20.580> so<00:01:21.799> essentially<00:01:22.799> what<00:01:22.950> you<00:01:23.070> do<00:01:23.280> is

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
anarchist so essentially what you do is

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.640 
anarchist so essentially what you do is
once<00:01:24.450> you<00:01:24.570> have<00:01:24.689> zero<00:01:24.930> stacks<00:01:25.259> i'll<00:01:25.500> go<00:01:25.619> ahead

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
once you have zero stacks i'll go ahead

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.170 
once you have zero stacks i'll go ahead
and<00:01:25.830> simulate<00:01:26.159> it<00:01:26.490> now<00:01:26.610> it's<00:01:26.909> going<00:01:27.030> to<00:01:27.090> be

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
and simulate it now it's going to be

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.980 
and simulate it now it's going to be
fast<00:01:27.450> paced<00:01:27.689> in<00:01:28.020> a<00:01:29.240> real<00:01:30.240> battle<00:01:30.450> these<00:01:30.840> are

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
fast paced in a real battle these are

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.100 
fast paced in a real battle these are
lower<00:01:31.259> levels<00:01:31.650> and<00:01:31.860> I'm<00:01:31.979> used<00:01:32.400> to<00:01:32.490> but<00:01:32.960> if<00:01:33.960> you

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
lower levels and I'm used to but if you

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.210 
lower levels and I'm used to but if you
go<00:01:34.229> back<00:01:34.350> and<00:01:34.409> watch<00:01:34.590> my<00:01:34.770> video<00:01:35.009> and<00:01:35.070> pay

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
go back and watch my video and pay

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.440 
go back and watch my video and pay
attention<00:01:35.250> to<00:01:35.579> this<00:01:35.729> you'll<00:01:35.909> recognize<00:01:36.299> i'm

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
attention to this you'll recognize i'm

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.520 
attention to this you'll recognize i'm
using<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:36.780> same<00:01:36.900> tactic<00:01:37.259> that<00:01:37.350> i'm<00:01:37.500> just

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
using the same tactic that i'm just

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.850 
using the same tactic that i'm just
driving<00:01:38.119> so<00:01:39.119> i<00:01:39.420> have<00:01:40.110> zero<00:01:40.320> stacks<00:01:40.560> right<00:01:40.710> now

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
driving so i have zero stacks right now

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.999 
driving so i have zero stacks right now
if<00:01:41.040> I<00:01:41.100> kill<00:01:41.310> this<00:01:41.340> guy<00:01:41.640> I've<00:01:41.939> got<00:01:41.970> 26<00:01:42.659> so<00:01:43.140> now

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
if I kill this guy I've got 26 so now

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.980 
if I kill this guy I've got 26 so now
that<00:01:44.040> I've<00:01:44.310> got<00:01:44.460> 26<00:01:45.000> I<00:01:45.240> want<00:01:45.450> to<00:01:45.479> prematurely

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
that I've got 26 I want to prematurely

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.770 
that I've got 26 I want to prematurely
reload<00:01:46.470> and<00:01:46.829> activate<00:01:47.250> discord<00:01:47.759> so<00:01:48.450> once<00:01:48.630> this

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930 
you can see that the 25 stacks light

kill someone else reload prematurely and

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.520 
kill someone else reload prematurely and
you've<00:02:16.819> got<00:02:16.970> another<00:02:17.180> discord<00:02:17.630> active<00:02:17.930> so

active all the time so you've got that

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:24.790

percent health regen for a second

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.420

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.720 
here and then I set off this cord and
then<00:02:56.989> I'm<00:02:57.110> firing<00:02:57.380> and<00:02:57.890> for<00:02:58.190> example<00:02:58.489> I<00:02:58.550> kill

then I'm firing and for example I kill

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:59.979 
then I'm firing and for example I kill
him<00:02:58.940> and<00:02:59.120> there's<00:02:59.300> no<00:02:59.420> one<00:02:59.510> in<00:02:59.660> front<00:02:59.720> of<00:02:59.900> me

cancelling<00:03:23.420> discord<00:03:23.840> if<00:03:24.079> you<00:03:24.200> reload

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
cancelling discord if you reload

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:25.720 
cancelling discord if you reload
prematurely<00:03:24.950> so<00:03:25.250> you<00:03:25.310> have<00:03:25.430> to<00:03:25.489> get<00:03:25.610> in<00:03:25.670> the

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
prematurely so you have to get in the

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.270 
prematurely so you have to get in the
mentality<00:03:26.239> of<00:03:26.620> always<00:03:27.620> checking<00:03:28.010> to<00:03:28.250> make

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
mentality of always checking to make

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.220 
mentality of always checking to make
sure<00:03:28.400> that<00:03:28.820> you're<00:03:28.850> reloading<00:03:29.239> properly<00:03:29.810> this

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
sure that you're reloading properly this

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:31.960 
sure that you're reloading properly this
is<00:03:30.410> not<00:03:30.500> a<00:03:30.590> very<00:03:30.769> casual<00:03:31.340> bill<00:03:31.579> that<00:03:31.850> you

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
is not a very casual bill that you

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:33.160 
is not a very casual bill that you
really<00:03:32.209> have<00:03:32.239> to<00:03:32.420> pay<00:03:32.540> attention<00:03:32.570> to<00:03:33.019> what

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
really have to pay attention to what

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.530 
really have to pay attention to what
you're<00:03:33.290> doing<00:03:33.760> but<00:03:34.760> once<00:03:35.269> you've<00:03:35.360> got<00:03:35.510> that

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
you're doing but once you've got that

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.030 
you're doing but once you've got that
down<00:03:35.780> as<00:03:36.079> you<00:03:36.230> can<00:03:36.320> see<00:03:36.500> from<00:03:36.590> the<00:03:36.739> video<00:03:36.860> I

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
down as you can see from the video I

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.610 
down as you can see from the video I
pretty<00:03:37.459> much<00:03:37.690> decimate<00:03:38.690> everything<00:03:39.140> my<00:03:39.290> level

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
pretty much decimate everything my level

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.979 
pretty much decimate everything my level
in<00:03:40.310> solo<00:03:40.700> play<00:03:40.880> if<00:03:41.060> you've<00:03:41.180> got<00:03:41.360> for<00:03:41.690> my<00:03:41.810> chrome

in solo play if you've got for my chrome

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:44.710 
in solo play if you've got for my chrome
answers<00:03:42.290> it's<00:03:42.500> even<00:03:42.769> better<00:03:43.239> if<00:03:44.239> they're<00:03:44.600> all

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
answers it's even better if they're all

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.000 
answers it's even better if they're all
running<00:03:44.870> this<00:03:45.170> especially<00:03:45.709> since<00:03:45.890> the

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
running this especially since the

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:50.199 
running this especially since the
catalyst<00:03:46.459> mod<00:03:46.670> is<00:03:46.820> a<00:03:46.850> team<00:03:48.760> elemental<00:03:49.760> boost

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.209 
catalyst mod is a team elemental boost

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:51.759 
catalyst mod is a team elemental boost
not<00:03:50.540> a<00:03:50.570> single<00:03:50.930> ones<00:03:51.140> who<00:03:51.380> will<00:03:51.500> be<00:03:51.590> running

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:51.769 
not a single ones who will be running

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:53.819 
not a single ones who will be running
what<00:03:52.190> one<00:03:52.370> hundred<00:03:52.609> and<00:03:52.640> sixty<00:03:53.150> percent

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:53.829 
what one hundred and sixty percent

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:56.140 
what one hundred and sixty percent
elemental<00:03:54.829> damage<00:03:54.950> which<00:03:55.340> is<00:03:55.459> insane<00:03:55.850> and

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
elemental damage which is insane and

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:57.729 
elemental damage which is insane and
even<00:03:56.930> though<00:03:57.019> things<00:03:57.170> will<00:03:57.350> be<00:03:57.470> stronger

00:03:57.729 --> 00:03:57.739 
even though things will be stronger

00:03:57.739 --> 00:03:59.259 
even though things will be stronger
you'll<00:03:58.130> be<00:03:58.280> a<00:03:58.310> lot<00:03:58.519> stronger<00:03:58.790> with<00:03:59.060> that<00:03:59.180> one

00:03:59.259 --> 00:03:59.269 
you'll be a lot stronger with that one

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:01.120 
you'll be a lot stronger with that one
hundred<00:03:59.390> sixty<00:03:59.720> percent<00:03:59.840> so<00:04:00.320> that's

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.130 
hundred sixty percent so that's

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:02.949 
hundred sixty percent so that's
basically<00:04:01.519> I<00:04:01.880> wanted<00:04:02.299> to<00:04:02.390> go<00:04:02.510> over<00:04:02.540> guys

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:02.959 
basically I wanted to go over guys

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:05.050 
basically I wanted to go over guys
there's<00:04:03.859> a<00:04:03.920> lot<00:04:04.070> more<00:04:04.100> synergy<00:04:04.459> to<00:04:04.760> do<00:04:04.880> with

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060 
there's a lot more synergy to do with

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.410 
there's a lot more synergy to do with
the<00:04:05.150> black<00:04:05.359> hole

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.420 
the black hole

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.990 
the black hole
the<00:04:07.569> relic<00:04:08.500> in<00:04:08.650> the<00:04:08.680> grenade<00:04:09.099> but<00:04:09.340> those<00:04:09.730> were

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
the relic in the grenade but those were

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.740 
the relic in the grenade but those were
all<00:04:10.240> pretty<00:04:10.840> much<00:04:11.459> demonstrated<00:04:12.459> in<00:04:12.580> the

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
all pretty much demonstrated in the

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.780 
all pretty much demonstrated in the
video<00:04:13.750> that<00:04:13.930> I<00:04:13.989> put<00:04:14.140> up<00:04:14.290> a<00:04:14.349> few<00:04:14.500> days<00:04:14.620> ago<00:04:14.800> and<00:04:15.099> I

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
video that I put up a few days ago and I

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:17.069 
video that I put up a few days ago and I
don't<00:04:15.940> really<00:04:16.299> think<00:04:16.419> I<00:04:16.660> need<00:04:16.810> to<00:04:16.840> go<00:04:16.959> over

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:17.079 
don't really think I need to go over

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:20.430 
don't really think I need to go over
this<00:04:17.260> too<00:04:17.410> much<00:04:17.820> but<00:04:18.820> always<00:04:19.120> when<00:04:20.109> you're

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
this too much but always when you're

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.460 
this too much but always when you're
going<00:04:20.530> to<00:04:20.620> use<00:04:20.709> this<00:04:20.829> build<00:04:21.070> follow<00:04:21.880> the

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
going to use this build follow the

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.140 
going to use this build follow the
discord<00:04:23.470> thing<00:04:24.040> that<00:04:24.220> I<00:04:24.250> just<00:04:24.490> explained<00:04:24.910> and

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 
discord thing that I just explained and

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:26.909 
discord thing that I just explained and
you'll<00:04:25.480> be<00:04:25.600> doing<00:04:25.900> a<00:04:25.930> lot<00:04:26.110> more<00:04:26.350> damage<00:04:26.680> than

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:26.919 
you'll be doing a lot more damage than

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:29.940 
you'll be doing a lot more damage than
you<00:04:27.040> would<00:04:27.220> be<00:04:27.370> if<00:04:27.400> you<00:04:28.080> were<00:04:29.080> just<00:04:29.770> running

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:29.950 
you would be if you were just running

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:31.710 
you would be if you were just running
around<00:04:30.160> and<00:04:30.340> shooting<00:04:30.580> things<00:04:30.760> but<00:04:31.540> anyway

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720
