00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
the only one that I found that will

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.170 
the only one that I found that will

you may or may not know the chromecast

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.519 
you may or may not know the chromecast
to<00:00:26.939> play<00:00:27.390> video<00:00:27.689> instead<00:00:28.170> of<00:00:28.289> actually

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
to play video instead of actually

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.500 
to play video instead of actually
playing<00:00:28.650> it<00:00:28.890> from<00:00:29.010> your<00:00:29.189> device<00:00:29.519> it<00:00:30.090> simply

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
playing it from your device it simply

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.780 
playing it from your device it simply
goes<00:00:30.750> out<00:00:31.019> to<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:31.890> Internet<00:00:32.279> and<00:00:32.399> gets<00:00:32.640> it

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
goes out to the Internet and gets it

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.549 
goes out to the Internet and gets it
itself<00:00:33.180> and<00:00:33.450> streams<00:00:33.719> it<00:00:33.870> from<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.110> Internet

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
itself and streams it from the Internet

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.310 
itself and streams it from the Internet
thus<00:00:35.180> reducing<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.210> amount<00:00:36.510> of<00:00:36.630> lag<00:00:36.989> you<00:00:37.200> may

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
thus reducing the amount of lag you may

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.260 
thus reducing the amount of lag you may
have<00:00:37.500> on<00:00:37.620> your<00:00:37.739> local<00:00:37.950> network<00:00:38.219> because<00:00:39.120> it's

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
have on your local network because it's

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.490 
have on your local network because it's
just<00:00:39.420> streamed<00:00:39.660> that<00:00:39.809> video<00:00:40.050> straight<00:00:40.320> from

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
just streamed that video straight from

just streamed that video straight from
the<00:00:40.620> internet<00:00:41.040> so<00:00:41.579> playing<00:00:41.820> local<00:00:42.210> files<00:00:42.420> that

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570

pretty<00:00:44.550> difficult<00:00:44.760> for<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.149> chromecast<00:00:45.600> but

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
pretty difficult for the chromecast but

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.560 
pretty difficult for the chromecast but
with<00:00:46.230> this<00:00:46.410> app<00:00:46.590> it's<00:00:46.860> massively<00:00:47.460> easier<00:00:47.910> so

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
Google chromecast will be one of them

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.510 
Google chromecast will be one of them
once<00:01:18.900> we<00:01:19.049> launch<00:01:19.259> it<00:01:19.560> you'll<00:01:20.100> get<00:01:20.220> a<00:01:20.250> screen

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
once we launch it you'll get a screen

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.760 
once we launch it you'll get a screen
that<00:01:20.580> looks<00:01:20.820> something<00:01:21.299> like<00:01:21.450> this<00:01:21.810> now<00:01:22.530> it

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
that looks something like this now it

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.920 
that looks something like this now it
really<00:01:23.040> is<00:01:23.460> so<00:01:23.850> simple<00:01:24.150> to<00:01:24.450> get<00:01:24.570> this<00:01:24.689> started

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
really is so simple to get this started

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.899 
really is so simple to get this started
but<00:01:25.350> before<00:01:25.650> we<00:01:25.710> actually<00:01:25.830> go<00:01:26.130> and<00:01:26.490> look<00:01:26.790> at

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
but before we actually go and look at

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.100 
but before we actually go and look at
how<00:01:27.060> it<00:01:27.150> works<00:01:27.299> let's<00:01:27.630> just<00:01:27.780> look<00:01:27.930> at<00:01:28.020> the

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
how it works let's just look at the

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.719 
how it works let's just look at the
premium<00:01:28.350> option<00:01:28.860> we<00:01:28.950> have<00:01:29.100> at<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.310> top<00:01:29.490> here

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
premium option we have at the top here

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.330 
premium option we have at the top here
essentially<00:01:30.689> when<00:01:30.900> you<00:01:30.990> buy<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.200> premium<00:01:31.560> it

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
essentially when you buy the premium it

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.830 
essentially when you buy the premium it
allows<00:01:32.549> you<00:01:32.670> to<00:01:32.790> do<00:01:32.880> playlist<00:01:33.329> support<00:01:33.689> to

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
allows you to do playlist support to

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.859 
allows you to do playlist support to

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
through my computer to the chromecast it

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:49.580 
through my computer to the chromecast it
may<00:02:48.330> seem<00:02:48.600> quite<00:02:48.840> difficult<00:02:49.050> and<00:02:49.440> a

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
may seem quite difficult and a

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.220 
may seem quite difficult and a
long-winded<00:02:50.340> way<00:02:50.519> of<00:02:50.670> doing<00:02:51.030> it<00:02:51.180> but<00:02:51.930> it<00:02:52.019> works

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
long-winded way of doing it but it works

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.259 
long-winded way of doing it but it works
really<00:02:52.530> really<00:02:52.650> well<00:02:52.860> so<00:02:53.730> if<00:02:53.910> we<00:02:53.970> go<00:02:54.150> into

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
really really well so if we go into

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:56.350 
really really well so if we go into
media<00:02:54.690> here<00:02:54.959> let's<00:02:55.260> just<00:02:55.410> go<00:02:55.530> to<00:02:55.590> TV<00:02:56.280> shows
