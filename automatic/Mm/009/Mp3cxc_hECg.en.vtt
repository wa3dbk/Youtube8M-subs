00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.460 
you're trying to play an E but quite
possibly<00:02:36.090> it<00:02:36.600> will<00:02:36.660> be<00:02:36.810> too<00:02:36.960> flat<00:02:37.230> to<00:02:37.260> begin

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
possibly it will be too flat to begin

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.010 
possibly it will be too flat to begin
with<00:02:37.770> so<00:02:38.430> here<00:02:38.640> we<00:02:38.730> go<00:02:38.850> I'm<00:02:39.570> going<00:02:39.720> to<00:02:39.750> play<00:02:39.900> my

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
with so here we go I'm going to play my

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.560 
with so here we go I'm going to play my
first<00:02:40.200> note<00:02:40.530> and<00:02:41.370> hoping<00:02:41.730> to<00:02:41.910> tune<00:02:42.210> it<00:02:42.330> up<00:02:42.360> to

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
first note and hoping to tune it up to

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.840 
first note and hoping to tune it up to
an<00:02:42.630> e<00:02:42.720> this<00:02:42.870> is<00:02:42.930> the<00:02:43.080> top<00:02:43.380> string<00:02:43.770> as<00:02:44.490> we<00:02:44.610> call

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
an e this is the top string as we call

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:50.450 
an e this is the top string as we call
it<00:02:44.970> what<00:02:45.660> do<00:02:45.720> you<00:02:45.810> see<00:02:46.160> thickest<00:02:47.160> string<00:02:49.460> you

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:50.460 
it what do you see thickest string you

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:53.090 
it what do you see thickest string you
might<00:02:50.790> be<00:02:51.060> able<00:02:51.210> to<00:02:51.420> pick<00:02:51.600> that<00:02:51.630> up<00:02:51.780> these<00:02:52.530> way

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
might be able to pick that up these way

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.630 
might be able to pick that up these way
too<00:02:53.160> flat<00:02:53.730> so<00:02:54.030> I'm<00:02:54.180> going<00:02:54.360> to<00:02:54.390> start<00:02:55.260> to

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
too flat so I'm going to start to

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.420 
too flat so I'm going to start to
tighten<00:02:56.640> the<00:02:56.790> string<00:02:57.150> by<00:02:57.840> turning<00:02:58.470> my<00:02:58.980> tuning

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
tighten the string by turning my tuning

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:08.030 
tighten the string by turning my tuning
key<00:02:59.900> not<00:03:00.900> a<00:03:00.930> great<00:03:01.200> deal<00:03:06.350> now<00:03:07.350> it's<00:03:07.500> registered

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
key not a great deal now it's registered

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.300 
key not a great deal now it's registered
so<00:03:08.820> I<00:03:08.850> said<00:03:09.270> before<00:03:09.360> you<00:03:09.660> can<00:03:09.810> see<00:03:10.020> thinks<00:03:10.500> that

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
so I said before you can see thinks that

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:12.950 
so I said before you can see thinks that
I'm<00:03:11.430> trying<00:03:11.640> to<00:03:11.700> play<00:03:11.820> an<00:03:11.880> E<00:03:12.030> it's<00:03:12.600> telling<00:03:12.930> me

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:12.960 
I'm trying to play an E it's telling me

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:17.990 
I'm trying to play an E it's telling me
that<00:03:13.290> I'm<00:03:13.980> too<00:03:14.220> flat<00:03:16.610> what<00:03:17.610> will<00:03:17.730> gradually

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
that I'm too flat what will gradually

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.680 
that I'm too flat what will gradually
start<00:03:18.150> to<00:03:18.360> happen<00:03:18.650> as<00:03:19.650> I<00:03:19.800> continue<00:03:20.250> to<00:03:20.400> tighten

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
start to happen as I continue to tighten

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:25.220 
start to happen as I continue to tighten
very<00:03:21.690> slightly<00:03:22.100> is<00:03:23.360> the<00:03:24.360> needle<00:03:24.570> will<00:03:24.870> start

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
very slightly is the needle will start

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.310 
very slightly is the needle will start
to<00:03:25.410> move<00:03:26.480> what<00:03:27.480> we're<00:03:27.630> looking<00:03:27.900> for<00:03:28.080> it<00:03:28.170> for

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
to move what we're looking for it for

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.370 
to move what we're looking for it for
that<00:03:28.350> needle<00:03:28.650> on<00:03:28.860> this<00:03:28.950> particular<00:03:29.280> bass<00:03:29.820> tuna

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.380 
that needle on this particular bass tuna

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:35.060 
that needle on this particular bass tuna
to<00:03:31.380> point<00:03:32.120> directly<00:03:33.530> to<00:03:34.530> the<00:03:34.620> middle<00:03:34.890> light

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
to point directly to the middle light

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.940 
to point directly to the middle light
over<00:03:35.400> at<00:03:35.520> 12<00:03:35.760> o'clock<00:03:36.380> so<00:03:37.380> again<00:03:37.620> we're<00:03:37.770> to

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
over at 12 o'clock so again we're to

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:44.090 
over at 12 o'clock so again we're to
flat<00:03:38.700> and<00:03:39.500> there<00:03:40.500> we<00:03:40.620> are<00:03:40.650> we're<00:03:40.950> almost<00:03:43.040> there

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
flat and there we are we're almost there

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:45.920 
flat and there we are we're almost there
what<00:03:44.459> we<00:03:44.610> really<00:03:44.940> need<00:03:45.120> is<00:03:45.240> just<00:03:45.480> a<00:03:45.630> screen

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
what we really need is just a screen

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.830 
what we really need is just a screen
like<00:03:46.080> to<00:03:46.230> be<00:03:46.320> showing<00:03:47.360> obviously<00:03:48.360> all<00:03:48.540> bass

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
like to be showing obviously all bass

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.110 
like to be showing obviously all bass
tuners<00:03:49.290> are<00:03:49.410> different<00:03:49.770> but<00:03:50.550> the<00:03:50.670> principle

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
tuners are different but the principle

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.610 
tuners are different but the principle
remains<00:03:51.150> the<00:03:51.600> same<00:03:51.840> you'll<00:03:52.050> probably<00:03:52.290> have<00:03:52.590> a

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
remains the same you'll probably have a

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.460 
remains the same you'll probably have a
green<00:03:53.010> or<00:03:53.160> red<00:03:53.190> light<00:03:53.520> telling<00:03:53.910> you<00:03:54.470> that

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
green or red light telling you that

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.170 
green or red light telling you that
you're<00:03:55.590> almost<00:03:55.740> in<00:03:56.070> tune<00:03:56.340> and<00:03:56.790> there<00:03:56.970> we<00:03:57.030> go

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
you're almost in tune and there we go

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.640 
you're almost in tune and there we go
that's<00:03:57.450> my<00:03:57.720> first<00:03:58.050> string<00:03:58.410> my<00:03:59.040> E<00:03:59.070> string<00:03:59.550> is

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
that's my first string my E string is

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:04.310 
that's my first string my E string is
now<00:04:01.650> tuned<00:04:01.920> to<00:04:02.100> E
