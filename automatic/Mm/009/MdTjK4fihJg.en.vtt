00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 Hello you and welcome 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:06.240
 have a new video of me today 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.400
 I have a relatively special video for 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.900
 I'm very happy about myself 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.570
 because it's just the same for me 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.240
 Surprise is like for you and it 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.730
 goes back to magnolia hourglass and indeed 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.730
 I'm not back on tour now 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.310
 for you and for me and become a couple 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.320
 interesting videos with a few 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.960
 interesting magnolia turn it and 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.420
 where it's all about and what it's about 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.059
 I do not know that for myself 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.489
 I have one from magnolia 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.910
 surprise box sent in 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:43.230
 The hints are where I fly 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:45.120
 or we and what is there now 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.280
 I'll take everything with me 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.149
 I almost unpack you live 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.610
 of course not yet in the box 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.050
 I look at it though 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.600
 It's hard because I'm very very 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.670
 curious, therefore, I am curious and 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.030
 We will see together for the first time 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.129
 what is there so live out 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:05.760
 So I'm doing the box now, too 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:08.970
 as if it were Christmas I love 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.110
 Christmas okay is really cute packed 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.970
 that reminds me a bit of the 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:20.869
 glossybox i miss the glossybox 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:20.869
 at the same time ok with your ok 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:32.060
 first thing in my eye right here 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:33.799
 jump is once the stamp stamp 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:43.070
 So I connect with stamping now 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:47.930
 no country or place a stamp okay me 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:51.259
 look at times goes on to explain the next 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:54.909
 here is this t 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:58.340
 what you always use for loose tea 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:02:01.490
 So soon I'll think about england 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:04.759
 Great Britain since I know now 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:07.009
 not if it is ireland or scotland or 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:12.580
 england definitely something in the 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:15.590
 direction would be something cold he what 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:18.160
 autumnal so I do not think so now 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.870
 necessarily southerners 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:24.709
 okay the next object is once 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:27.230
 again stamp so letters 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:32.120
 imprinted on the dice but on 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:33.680
 the back side can stamp here so 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.510
 I 'll get that stamp again 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.220
 do not understand what the stamp is 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.720
 Maybe there is something here 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:42.890
 hidden in it 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.780
 maybe you can do something here 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.989
 read of it I'm not exactly 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.640
 sure if you can try that 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:51.079
 something first to find now 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.239
 it may be that you have long ago 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:56.840
 found out what word is 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:58.819
 but here I am not on it 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.010
 but that's usually the case if something 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:04.780
 obviously jumping in your face 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:08.359
 then it actually reads as ultimately 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:11.389
 okay the next object here is so are 

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:14.989
 so sticker must ticker where a big one 

00:03:11.389 --> 00:03:19.850
 rest on it is at the clock I think 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:21.500
 somehow I do not know so now 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:24.799
 the theme of course at the clock to the 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:26.930
 think big ben but that is very 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:30.530
 presented in a very abstract manner 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:33.340
 what would I get by at the clock? 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.340
 still thinking 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:43.120
 and the last and probably 

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:45.819
 most exciting part here is once on 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.930
 samsung galaxy alpha and indeed one 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:49.030
 smartphone 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:51.310
 I do not assume it's there 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.780
 but there are any indications 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.569
 that is probably in any case 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.709
 something with which I travel 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:04:00.730
 it can be documented now 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:02.889
 social media platforms or yes 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:05.310
 somehow I'll just text it 

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:08.349
 miss twitter or facebook 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:10.689
 what I am doing so what is going on of 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:12.010
 therefore I like very much you can 

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:13.599
 also a smartphone of course always on 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:16.180
 best also edit the pictures and 

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:17.470
 everything and now I have to 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.509
 probably my thoughts 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.489
 actually get together say something 

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:22.870
 it should be 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:25.000
 I think I would be in London 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:26.770
 stay and I'm just accepting that 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:31.740
 I understand what the stamp should 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:31.740
 So now I have found no words 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.460
 I dont know 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:39.550
 So you love that was mine 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:41.800
 small unboxing video if you have one 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:44.169
 guess if you go to foot 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:46.240
 or if you just have faster 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:47.710
 to cope with the hints since 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:51.280
 I then that it will definitely be in me 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:53.110
 the comments know where it goes and 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:54.729
 what I do then I will now 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.560
 puzzle a bit and see if I am 

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:58.270
 maybe some word in the 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:01.330
 stamp or find myself 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:03.130
 somehow lie can that's so 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:05.830
 Experienced Switzerland is easy 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:08.020
 not but i'm definitely very 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:10.659
 eager to experience something new with the 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:12.760
 magnolia it and for you really great 

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:14.680
 That's why I'm on 

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:17.440
 any case, no matter where it goes 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:19.840
 and below I then linked yet 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:22.000
 times the playlist if you so soon 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.430
 she comes out of those magnolia's of it 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.650
 our experiences and videos 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:29.060
 and then you can do all this 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:31.639
 wonderful things in any case 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:34.220
 and we will be thrilled no matter what we have there 

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:36.350
 do it now and I would say that 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:38.180
 that from my little unboxing hope so 

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:40.790
 you liked and you know 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:43.520
 every case more than me now because i 

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:45.260
 but we are on the hose 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:48.850
 then just in my next 

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.850
 video until then love everything
