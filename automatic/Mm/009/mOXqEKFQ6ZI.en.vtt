this<00:02:56.840> is<00:02:57.020> the<00:02:57.140> code<00:02:57.319> to<00:02:57.349> run<00:02:57.650> the<00:02:57.800> slideshow

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
this is the code to run the slideshow

what<00:03:02.060> this<00:03:02.180> code<00:03:02.390> does<00:03:02.420> is<00:03:02.900> it<00:03:02.930> sets<00:03:03.200> up<00:03:03.380> the

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
what this code does is it sets up the

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:05.350 
what this code does is it sets up the
filter<00:03:03.830> property<00:03:04.220> of<00:03:04.459> the<00:03:04.640> image<00:03:04.880> on<00:03:05.060> the<00:03:05.090> page

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
filter property of the image on the page

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.290 
filter property of the image on the page
then<00:03:06.230> it<00:03:06.770> keeps<00:03:06.950> track<00:03:07.250> of<00:03:07.280> which<00:03:07.580> image<00:03:08.120> to

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:08.300 
then it keeps track of which image to

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.120 
then it keeps track of which image to
display<00:03:08.660> in<00:03:08.900> the<00:03:08.959> array<00:03:09.349> which<00:03:09.650> is<00:03:09.800> the<00:03:09.920> J

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
display in the array which is the J

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:12.850 
display in the array which is the J
variable<00:03:10.670> if<00:03:10.880> the<00:03:11.690> J<00:03:11.870> variable<00:03:12.290> is<00:03:12.530> equal<00:03:12.560> to

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
variable if the J variable is equal to

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.589 
variable if the J variable is equal to
the<00:03:12.950> length<00:03:13.190> of<00:03:13.310> the<00:03:13.430> picture<00:03:13.730> array<00:03:13.970> minus<00:03:14.390> 1

00:03:14.589 --> 00:03:14.599 
the length of the picture array minus 1

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:17.140 
the length of the picture array minus 1
it<00:03:14.870> resets<00:03:15.349> the<00:03:15.530> J<00:03:15.709> variable<00:03:16.099> back<00:03:16.459> to<00:03:16.640> 0

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
it resets the J variable back to 0

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.930 
it resets the J variable back to 0
finally<00:03:18.110> it<00:03:18.319> recursively<00:03:18.620> calls<00:03:19.130> itself<00:03:19.519> so

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
finally it recursively calls itself so

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:27.130 
finally it recursively calls itself so
it<00:03:20.120> can<00:03:20.269> switch<00:03:20.540> pictures<00:03:25.870> after<00:03:26.870> defining

parameter that needs to be passed to the
push<00:03:55.610> function<00:03:55.849> is<00:03:56.269> the<00:03:56.450> name<00:03:56.599> of<00:03:56.750> the

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
push function is the name of the

now<00:03:59.480> in<00:03:59.660> our<00:03:59.810> example<00:04:00.410> the<00:04:00.799> function<00:04:01.190> name<00:04:01.370> is

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:01.579 
now in our example the function name is

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:04.330 
now in our example the function name is
run<00:04:01.970> slideshow<00:04:02.810> so<00:04:03.290> you<00:04:03.380> would<00:04:03.620> put<00:04:03.799> in<00:04:03.950> run

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340 
run slideshow so you would put in run

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:07.460 
run slideshow so you would put in run
