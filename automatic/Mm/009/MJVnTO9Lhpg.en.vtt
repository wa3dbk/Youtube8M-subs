for IPL over their country is that

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.480 
for IPL over their country is that
something<00:01:43.290> that<00:01:43.320> is<00:01:43.619> a<00:01:43.740> concern<00:01:44.100> for<00:01:44.250> you<00:01:44.340> as

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
captain of the assuming you're gonna it

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.190 
captain of the assuming you're gonna it
won't<00:01:47.220> happen<00:01:47.340> for<00:01:47.610> us<00:01:47.689> but<00:01:48.689> I<00:01:48.720> think<00:01:48.810> it<00:01:49.079> is<00:01:49.170> a

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
won't happen for us but I think it is a

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.260 
won't happen for us but I think it is a
concern<00:01:49.619> going<00:01:50.399> forward<00:01:50.549> I<00:01:50.970> think<00:01:51.000> it's

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
concern going forward I think it's

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.550 
concern going forward I think it's
really<00:01:51.479> important<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:51.960> Aussie<00:01:52.229> say<00:01:52.409> have<00:01:52.530> a

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
really important the Aussie say have a

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.350 
really important the Aussie say have a
really<00:01:52.829> good<00:01:52.920> look<00:01:53.070> at<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.250> program<00:01:53.610> and<00:01:53.820> and

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
really good look at the program and and

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.450 
really good look at the program and and
try<00:01:54.600> and<00:01:54.720> find<00:01:54.930> a<00:01:55.259> window<00:01:55.590> a<00:01:55.950> six-week<00:01:56.310> window

try and find a window a six-week window

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.249 
try and find a window a six-week window
to<00:01:56.640> fit<00:01:56.850> this<00:01:56.969> I<00:01:57.119> feeling<00:01:57.540> otherwise<00:01:57.990> you

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
to fit this I feeling otherwise you

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.560 
to fit this I feeling otherwise you
could<00:01:58.560> you<00:01:59.189> could<00:01:59.369> find<00:01:59.610> that<00:01:59.790> lots<00:02:00.090> of<00:02:00.210> good

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
could you could find that lots of good

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:01.609 
could you could find that lots of good
international<00:02:00.869> cricketers<00:02:01.409> we're<00:02:01.530> not

can't play the RPO I mean it'd be a an
eight

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:05.409 
eight

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:07.289 
eight
easier<00:02:05.710> way<00:02:05.859> to<00:02:05.890> make<00:02:06.159> a<00:02:06.340> reasonable<00:02:06.999> living

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
so there's a danger there I think so

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:11.190 
so there's a danger there I think so
