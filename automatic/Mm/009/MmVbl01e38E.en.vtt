 in the state of Colima is one 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.510
 of the most productive papaya fields 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.029
 the honey ranch of the company 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:18.600
 recycle good here we produce 

00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:23.099
 papaya of two varieties of the variety 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.660
 maradol and the royal variety be in 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:25.970
 this company is following an attention 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.349
 special in the care of papayas 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.539
 from planting where you take care of a 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.940
 meticulous way either pruning the 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.680
 bad stems or helping the trees to 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.870
 maintain your optimal posture for your 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.560
 development after everything is done 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:43.830
 the production process here in the field 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:46.230
 this will reach the approximately 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:49.260
 the 89 months 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:52.830
 the fruit is physiologically ready 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:55.590
 to cut yourself then once you 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:58.530
 short then the packaging is taken there 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:01.560
 we started this from him from 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:05.339
 the field the traceability of that fruit 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:08.370
 that we are going to pack then in 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:11.540
 each trailer harvested 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:14.630
 we make a 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:16.830
 in one in a format the number of 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:20.670
 gang that harvested 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:23.580
 the box from which the date was cut 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.560
 then when the trailer arrives 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.870
 to the packaging when we 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.090
 download we already know the provenance of 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:32.250
 that fruit once the best 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.710
 Papayas are selected and separated 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.420
 by species a trailer was lifted up 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.940
 the plant where your process of 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.620
 packaging here are selected with sumo 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.770
 care to prevent some of these 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:45.300
 fruits pass with a damage the packaging here 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.520
 the staff that is responsible for the 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:50.010
 selection is trained to distinguish 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.830
 simple view the quality fruit that comes 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:56.940
 of form does not enter the package fruit that 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:02:00.300
 have some wound either or if it brings 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:02.550
 for example the east peduncle that is 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.650
 this structure that binds the fruit with 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:07.380
 the tree if it comes too long, you have to 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.540
 cut it then good once already with 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.400
 these characteristics enters the fruit at 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:17.880
 first to the first wash 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:20.160
 and this by immersion and with one with one 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:24.030
 frank list very soft we are going 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.740
 to help this cleaning the fruit is 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.420
 deposited in a chlorine container with 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.070
 water where it is cleansed of any 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.220
 impurity to maintain the safety of 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:34.170
 the papayas will later be passed to a 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.790
 part where it will be treated with fungicide 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.250
 to avoid contamination of 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.990
 product by fungi which causes 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.300
 they mature faster and do not 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:44.160
 take advantage of all the flavor of the fruit here 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.870
 like a perfectly oiled machine 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.120
 the packers select the fruits 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.130
 which are of international quality or for 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.560
 national consumption and those that are for 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.300
 shrubs which are composted and 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.910
 will be used again to produce more 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:59.580
 by several of the maradol as most 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:02.490
 it goes to the USA and the rust to be 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:04.860
 besides going to usa it also goes for 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:07.830
 Spain and there from Spain ' move to 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.570
 portugal this company works under 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.640
 strict hygiene standards and 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.510
 production to continue exporting outside 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.950
 from mexico 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.450
 In addition to having certification of 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.110
 safety at the national level and 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.300
 international 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:20.460
 It should be noted that all the fruit is 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.930
 exported abroad by air every 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:25.480
 box 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:28.260
 with a label this 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:32.349
 this label brings information like the 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:34.780
 packing date this one who packed it 

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:37.239
 all this for this process of 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.129
 traceability for us to see from 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:41.349
 here for back that management had this 

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:43.480
 fruit this company carries 50 tons 

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:45.849
 per hectares what gives us an idea of 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:49.420
 its production both packaging and field 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:53.799
 are certified with the cica here 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:56.140
 mexico and we bought lapse east in usa 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:58.299
 so then well that's why we 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:01.959
 endorse true that we are doing 

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:04.180
 quality processes this and attached is 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:07.390
 true to the norms of both the 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:10.049
 Mexican governments as in the USA and so on 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:12.280
 of consumers that are true the 

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:15.280
 rules that they put in the store that is going 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.930
 to buy the fruit then this all 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.000
 everything translates into good practices 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:21.070
 agricultural 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.640
 and these certificates the only thing that we 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:26.330
 they are saying is that this fruit does not 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:29.689
 let's arm anyone 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:33.620
 neither with nor with any physical contaminant 

00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:35.509
 chemical or biological network this one worries 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:37.819
 for an international market as much as 

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:40.819
 for the Mexican and without a doubt his 

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:43.219
 greater pride is to be 100% a company
