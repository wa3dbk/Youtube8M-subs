00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609
 before we reach the moon in the year 22 05 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:08.639
 fly it is still a good idea 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:11.250
 the cool blue island worlds of 21 70 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.679
 to visit the current anno to the 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.210
 but we settle down 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.109
 not with the unchanged basic game 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:21.359
 but have us the free motto 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:23.550
 21 70 usd made 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:27.480
 that stands for advanced research report 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.640
 content she's free to easily 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.890
 install and offers cubic meters 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.170
 new content where everyone anno 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.420
 city planner anticipation jumps in the triangle 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.640
 most benefit from the mod 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.379
 The beautiful builders like theirs 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.870
 make sure that you settle down and settle down 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.989
 all kinds of decoration elements pretzel the 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.450
 construction - by eia they are in contrast to 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:51.090
 normal anno pick pack full of new ones 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.940
 Options for home production plants 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.800
 and started every little ornamental element 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.960
 with three color choices many possibilities 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.030
 There are number 1 houses and 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.190
 reversible street lamps skybeamer 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.439
 in all colors of the rainbow decoration 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.020
 tool shed oil tanks crosswalk 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.900
 and large video walls of all kinds in the 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.619
 Although basic games are also some 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.530
 Decoration elements contain the 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.270
 Sheer quantity of Yarash she makes the mod 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.580
 but a deco class for itself 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.920
 let's see if we are really monstrous 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.049
 setting up a device is also new 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.670
 that we work for many production chains 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.950
 do not put on the diving suit anymore 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.479
 Most of the consumption had to be the 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.979
 teck faction can now namely 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.810
 also produce on land like this 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.780
 coral gardens or your own breeding 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.880
 assume if we as the comfort function 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.770
 understand or annoy us about that 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.170
 processes specified by the developers 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.790
 it is a matter of taste 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.619
 Anyway, we have the experiment 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.450
 managed our population up to 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.299
 tycoon executives 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.500
 without even a single tc colony too 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:53.180
 establish 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.590
 a new production building for the 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.230
 here in any case fierce applause 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.660
 Donate is the new fish farm in 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:01.790
 the pretty round pulse available with 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.440
 and without lids we finally breed 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.930
 enough fish staple too 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:09.370
 land without our harbor entrances with 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.370
 to have to tinker with fischerhÃ¼tten 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.980
 many of the biggest changes were made 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.970
 the tech residents and theirs 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.710
 research facilities made in 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.030
 We continue to provide the research laboratory 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:22.310
 useful tools 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.350
 in the new, albeit same-looking 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.540
 We make the relics lab 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.010
 experimental prototypes to the im 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.900
 Main game only by accident 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.700
 and for the advanced 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.950
 research in academy so important 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.650
 are and it has in itself 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.240
 There are now over 400 old and 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.400
 to improve new technologies 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:47.090
 all possible games aspects in order 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:48.800
 give a view to the harbor here has it 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.490
 especially the ki shipyard 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.320
 done 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:53.000
 we can not own one with her 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.380
 produce vehicles but ki 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.030
 Let fractions start 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.830
 even if we have them in our lot 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.290
 we would not have set 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:02.840
 example like the eco terrorist leon 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.880
 Moroder over Rome was in the so-called 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.530
 buy colonize our island world 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.820
 Let's just call him a state ship and you 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.820
 make themselves alone on the way 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.730
 our highlight, however, is the new one 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.989
 transport airport with the itself 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.370
 to let build freighter 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:21.950
 We share the same as ships 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.989
 trafficking routes are very convenient 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:27.140
 Our islands are too small and offer too 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:29.209
 There is not enough space left for residents 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.519
 another ass in the sleeve settle in the 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:33.560
 docklands so houses on the harbor 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:35.300
 the quay walls are now houses 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.550
 and the associated community 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.840
 Build a building in a harbor version 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:40.640
 the problem is only the 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.709
 Road connections we have to 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.540
 awkward and ugly under the 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:46.549
 Lay sea level on the sandy ground 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.450
 that looks terrible and works 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:50.030
 Not really good 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:53.959
 outside of this one flaw we can 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:55.940
 At u 21 70 you for anno professionals only 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:58.069
 recommend with all the send 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:00.049
 research and production buildings 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:04.030
 there is no reason an unwanted 

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:04.030
 21 70 at all to touch 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.810
 now everything will be easier
