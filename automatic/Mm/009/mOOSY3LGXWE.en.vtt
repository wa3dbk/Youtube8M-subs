00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.540
 very well now the specific word 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:10.710
 targeted at the mission leaders 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:14.480
 have a new fact that this is fantastic 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:17.160
 we are becoming a crib 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.480
 trainer of new leaders 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.560
 we respect that leadership 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.330
 that was forged in the early 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.609
 network sea waves 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.949
 but here we are seeing the birth 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.150
 new leaders and we need to tell the 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.320
 these leaders 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.940
 are you listening to me has 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.730
 first the people of responsibility 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.260
 thing to remember if leader is that 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.879
 which guides by example 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.469
 this means that if you are 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.329
 doing the right thing 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.469
 people who follow will do what they 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.149
 you are doing 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.730
 and if you're doing the wrong thing 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.440
 it does not matter if your words are for 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.070
 he does what you 're talking about 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.690
 he will inevitably do what you 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.840
 Is doing 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.789
 So you need to teach the 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.149
 marketing correctly not does not review 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:05.760
 invents nothing does not focus the market 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.760
 mister colibri on lps and watch videos 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.080
 this is a plus is an extra bonus to be 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.390
 one more differential 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.600
 we have the most extraordinary plan of 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.280
 marketing that has already been designed and 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.470
 This is what is making the lives of 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.630
 People like I'm here with Fabian who 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.310
 I met in January and the Fabian that I 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.770
 I met Jan and the Fabian who is here. 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.290
 today literally I do not want you 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.299
 think I'm flattered fabiano 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.060
 I met a comrade with difficulties. 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:36.060
 financial crises and today some 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:39.479
 months after this meeting I am facing 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:42.180
 and next to a man who has already changed so much 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.189
 his financial life of the family 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.159
 friends I can honestly say 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.960
 for you fabiano today a rich man but 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.890
 What are you doing that you need? 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:55.680
 do and that will work, do it 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.630
 gui by example teaches and does not 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.360
 tired of teaching because he is not the one 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:03.689
 Who lives with the one who goes along 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.729
 teach to do teaches again will of 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.649
 new and pulls the ear when needed 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.000
 because you will always know if your 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.289
 The book is talking is not because it is 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.440
 wanting to hurt 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.240
 he is doing to help you 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.430
 I already received several ears tugs 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.230
 several times gianpiero picked up the phone 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.880
 and told me they were doing it 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.660
 It's not right, do it. 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.640
 right 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.630
 I was filipe recordings already gave me several 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.880
 advices 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.250
 so we mirror in the leadership 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.650
 and we have incomparable leaders 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:33.560
 great people who simply have 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:36.950
 I learned what I should do and 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:39.890
 they did and the results are inevitable 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.630
 will reap what he has planted 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.180
 so my friends my leaders 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:47.090
 companions do what has to be 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:49.340
 made to teach people what is the 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.440
 mystique free from the concept who the 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.080
 company and what she's doing here and 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.990
 Where is this company going to stop? 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.280
 and then you will agree with me that the sky 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:00.470
 it's our limit 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.750
 Congratulations on the work you have done. 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:05.510
 played until now and god bless 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:07.960
 You and your family and all your 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.960
 led
