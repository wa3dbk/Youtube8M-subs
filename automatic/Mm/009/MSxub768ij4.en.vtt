00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.179 
it can go about flinging out this candle
holder<00:01:02.690> so<00:01:03.140> I<00:01:03.170> added<00:01:03.440> some<00:01:03.620> stick-on

00:01:04.179 --> 00:01:04.189 
holder so I added some stick-on

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
and actually some of the rhinestones and

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.270 
and actually some of the rhinestones and
stickers<00:01:08.600> were<00:01:08.869> not<00:01:09.110> very<00:01:09.320> sticky<00:01:09.619> so<00:01:09.950> a<00:01:09.979> hot

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 
stickers were not very sticky so a hot

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:22.179 
stickers were not very sticky so a hot
glue<00:01:10.490> them<00:01:10.640> on<00:01:10.790> to<00:01:10.970> be<00:01:11.180> sure<00:01:11.869> they'd<00:01:12.110> stay<00:01:12.320> on

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:22.189 

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:25.300 

so<00:01:23.149> I<00:01:23.179> decided<00:01:23.689> to<00:01:23.840> add<00:01:24.140> in<00:01:24.289> some<00:01:24.469> heart<00:01:24.799> sequin

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.459 
so I decided to add in some heart sequin
confetti<00:01:25.880> because<00:01:26.450> I'm<00:01:26.569> gonna<00:01:26.719> be<00:01:26.960> putting<00:01:27.319> in

00:01:27.459 --> 00:01:27.469 
confetti because I'm gonna be putting in

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:29.559 
confetti because I'm gonna be putting in
a<00:01:27.649> flameless<00:01:28.399> candle<00:01:28.819> so<00:01:28.999> there<00:01:29.149> won't<00:01:29.240> be<00:01:29.359> any

00:01:29.559 --> 00:01:29.569 
a flameless candle so there won't be any

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:39.140 
a flameless candle so there won't be any
chance<00:01:29.749> of<00:01:29.929> a<00:01:29.990> fire<00:01:30.229> hazard

nothing would fall out and then I made

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:34.050 
nothing would fall out and then I made
two<00:04:26.440> loops<00:04:26.710> and<00:04:27.010> tied<00:04:27.220> about<00:04:32.729> lastly<00:04:33.729> I<00:04:33.760> wrote

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060 
two loops and tied about lastly I wrote

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:35.460 
two loops and tied about lastly I wrote
