on<00:00:18.960> compass<00:00:19.960> 360s<00:00:20.590> motors<00:00:20.980> it's<00:00:21.220> a<00:00:21.490> que<00:00:21.730> 2482

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:22.480 
on compass 360s motors it's a que 2482

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.890 
on compass 360s motors it's a que 2482
blocks<00:00:23.460> basically<00:00:24.460> doing<00:00:24.970> a<00:00:25.090> mock<00:00:25.300> up<00:00:25.480> getting

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:25.900 
blocks basically doing a mock up getting

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.109 
blocks basically doing a mock up getting
oil<00:00:26.170> to<00:00:26.380> nurses<00:00:26.680> right<00:00:26.860> now<00:00:26.980> and<00:00:27.160> then<00:00:27.790> later

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:28.119 
oil to nurses right now and then later

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:31.650 
oil to nurses right now and then later
on<00:00:28.210> i'll<00:00:28.510> be<00:00:28.630> measuring<00:00:29.020> dome<00:00:29.830> valium<00:00:30.660> pissing

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:31.660 
on i'll be measuring dome valium pissing

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.350 
on i'll be measuring dome valium pissing
above<00:00:32.110> deck<00:00:32.320> clearance<00:00:32.800> all<00:00:33.010> that<00:00:33.190> so<00:00:33.550> it's

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:34.360 
above deck clearance all that so it's

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.270 
above deck clearance all that so it's
basically<00:00:34.540> a<00:00:34.780> simple<00:00:35.320> mock-up<00:00:35.710> getting<00:00:36.129> all

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:36.280 
basically a simple mock-up getting all

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.170 
basically a simple mock-up getting all
your<00:00:36.460> measurements<00:00:37.000> and<00:00:38.640> i'm<00:00:39.640> doing<00:00:39.820> main

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:40.180 
your measurements and i'm doing main

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.990 
your measurements and i'm doing main
clinic<00:00:40.600> this<00:00:40.750> bearings<00:00:41.650> are<00:00:41.800> in<00:00:42.000> everything's

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:43.000 
clinic this bearings are in everything's

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.360 
clinic this bearings are in everything's
torqued<00:00:43.300> down<00:00:43.360> so<00:00:44.200> basically<00:00:45.040> you<00:00:45.100> have<00:00:45.190> our

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:45.370 
torqued down so basically you have our

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.860 
torqued down so basically you have our
our<00:00:45.700> board<00:00:46.390> gauge<00:00:46.629> set<00:00:47.559> it<00:00:47.680> to<00:00:47.860> the<00:00:48.720> to<00:00:49.720> our

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:49.870 
our board gauge set it to the to our

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.890 
our board gauge set it to the to our
main<00:00:50.110> journal<00:00:51.100> flies<00:00:51.280> and<00:00:51.579> then<00:00:51.720> stick<00:00:52.720> it<00:00:52.750> in

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:52.900 
main journal flies and then stick it in

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.470 
main journal flies and then stick it in
there<00:00:53.079> and<00:00:53.200> it<00:00:53.440> shows<00:00:53.620> us<00:00:53.739> our<00:00:53.829> clearance<00:00:54.480> so

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:55.480 
there and it shows us our clearance so

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:00.900 
there and it shows us our clearance so
check<00:00:56.170> that<00:00:56.230> right<00:00:56.620> now<00:00:59.370> check<00:01:00.370> oil<00:01:00.489> crunches

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:00.910 
check that right now check oil crunches

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:02.310 
check that right now check oil crunches
before<00:01:01.030> everything<00:01:01.480> goes<00:01:01.720> together<00:01:01.899> like

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:02.320 
before everything goes together like

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.310 
before everything goes together like
right<00:01:02.590> now<00:01:02.680> it's<00:01:02.890> at<00:01:03.390> 22<00:01:04.390> thousands<00:01:04.869> Quintus

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 
right now it's at 22 thousands Quintus

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.070 
right now it's at 22 thousands Quintus
which<00:01:05.770> is<00:01:05.950> a<00:01:05.979> little<00:01:06.399> a<00:01:06.820> little<00:01:07.050> tight<00:01:08.050> for

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:08.080 
which is a little a little tight for

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.980 
which is a little a little tight for
what<00:01:08.470> we're<00:01:08.619> doing<00:01:08.860> so<00:01:09.550> this<00:01:10.240> is<00:01:10.390> an<00:01:10.540> endurance

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990 
what we're doing so this is an endurance

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:12.840 
what we're doing so this is an endurance
motor<00:01:11.320> so<00:01:11.740> it<00:01:11.890> needs<00:01:12.190> to<00:01:12.250> the<00:01:12.369> last<00:01:12.520> a<00:01:12.729> long

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
motor so it needs to the last a long

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.320 
motor so it needs to the last a long
time<00:01:13.200> so<00:01:14.200> right<00:01:14.800> now<00:01:14.830> we're<00:01:15.100> at<00:01:15.220> about<00:01:15.520> 2,000

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:16.330 
time so right now we're at about 2,000

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:23.609 
time so right now we're at about 2,000
squares<00:01:16.630> on<00:01:16.750> the<00:01:16.780> main

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:23.619 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:31.970 

16

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:31.980 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:40.310 

and<00:01:32.250> seven

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.210 

21

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
21

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.420 
21
it's<00:01:43.730> a<00:01:43.760> little<00:01:44.120> toy<00:01:44.300> what<00:01:44.540> we're<00:01:44.660> doing<00:01:45.430> see

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
it's a little toy what we're doing see

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.370 
it's a little toy what we're doing see
the<00:01:46.550> next<00:01:46.790> step<00:01:47.000> would<00:01:47.240> be<00:01:47.300> to<00:01:47.420> ship<00:01:48.050> out<00:01:48.200> the

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
the next step would be to ship out the

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.220 
the next step would be to ship out the
crank<00:01:48.680> to<00:01:48.860> the<00:01:49.250> machine<00:01:49.520> shop<00:01:49.600> take<00:01:50.600> out<00:01:50.810> about

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:51.230 
crank to the machine shop take out about

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:54.160 
crank to the machine shop take out about
like<00:01:51.530> half<00:01:52.100> a<00:01:52.250> sow<00:01:52.400> they<00:01:53.090> polish<00:01:53.420> it<00:01:53.540> down<00:01:53.690> so

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
like half a sow they polish it down so

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.410 
like half a sow they polish it down so
you<00:01:54.230> get<00:01:54.890> that<00:01:55.010> extra<00:01:55.340> extra<00:01:56.060> clearance<00:01:56.270> that

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
you get that extra extra clearance that

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.720 
you get that extra extra clearance that
we<00:01:56.540> need
