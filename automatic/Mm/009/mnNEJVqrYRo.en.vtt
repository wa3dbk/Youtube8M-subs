00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.690 

the<00:00:12.269> idea<00:00:12.690> is<00:00:12.929> loosely<00:00:13.410> based<00:00:13.500> on<00:00:14.009> the<00:00:14.250> forties

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700

because<00:00:20.009> there's<00:00:20.279> a<00:00:20.369> lot<00:00:20.490> of<00:00:20.520> hats<00:00:20.849> and<00:00:21.259> we

00:00:22.249 --> 00:00:22.259 
because there's a lot of hats and we

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:24.260 
because there's a lot of hats and we
needed<00:00:22.470> to<00:00:22.680> do<00:00:22.829> something<00:00:23.160> that<00:00:23.579> works<00:00:23.820> with

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:24.270 
needed to do something that works with

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:27.140 
needed to do something that works with
them<00:00:24.509> and<00:00:25.259> they<00:00:25.739> fit<00:00:26.009> on<00:00:26.039> in<00:00:26.430> a<00:00:26.550> very<00:00:26.579> strategic

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
little bit unexpected a little bit

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.540 
little bit unexpected a little bit
eccentric<00:00:46.260> something<00:00:46.980> that<00:00:47.070> is<00:00:47.160> not

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
eccentric something that is not

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.040 
eccentric something that is not
classical<00:00:48.270> because<00:00:48.480> in<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:48.629> way<00:00:48.660> there's<00:00:48.930> quite

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
classical because in a way there's quite

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.510 
classical because in a way there's quite
a<00:00:49.079> lot<00:00:49.199> of<00:00:49.260> classical<00:00:49.829> elements<00:00:50.190> going<00:00:50.340> on<00:00:50.430> in

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
a lot of classical elements going on in

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
the clothing so it sort of juxtapose

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.049 
the clothing so it sort of juxtapose
that<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:52.800> give<00:00:52.920> it<00:00:52.949> a<00:00:53.070> kind<00:00:53.250> of<00:00:53.309> fresh<00:00:53.579> modern

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
that and give it a kind of fresh modern

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.180 
that and give it a kind of fresh modern
twist<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.469> way<00:00:55.590> that<00:00:55.680> we<00:00:55.770> translate<00:00:56.100> to

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
twist and the way that we translate to

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.160 
twist and the way that we translate to
that<00:00:56.309> in<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.430> makeup<00:00:56.879> is<00:00:57.059> doing<00:00:57.989> really

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
that in the makeup is doing really

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.770 
that in the makeup is doing really
luminous<00:00:58.710> skin<00:00:58.829> and<00:00:59.190> then<00:00:59.850> we're<00:01:00.030> filling<00:01:00.570> in

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
luminous skin and then we're filling in

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.080 
luminous skin and then we're filling in
the<00:01:01.199> brows<00:01:01.500> so<00:01:02.309> giving<00:01:02.550> this<00:01:02.640> wonderful

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
architecture underpinning to the face

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.630 
architecture underpinning to the face
and<00:01:05.220> then<00:01:05.700> we're<00:01:06.240> doing<00:01:06.390> this<00:01:06.840> sherry

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640
