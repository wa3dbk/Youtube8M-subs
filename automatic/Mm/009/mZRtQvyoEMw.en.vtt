 there's a toy that project here all 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.090
 it seems the pipe circuit is sometimes 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.270
 very currado but that we are too much 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.270
 people 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:23.119

00:01:20.569 --> 00:01:26.360
 Call me crazy eye with this uncle 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:28.219

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.509
 I feel confident of coming back this 

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:32.959
 girl that I am getting a child 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:36.110

 gay dots in each boy by vamos is 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.560
 very good there are good web curves very good 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:46.750
 curves by the way 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:49.330
 You see what it says it says here is that the 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.560
 points are so far away that of course he does not know 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.760
 where is it really, but of course the only thing 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.830
 what it says is that it will follow the circuit 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.850
 because it has reverse 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.920
 there is already opposite direction not what 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.509
 I understand I do not understand, we are going to try 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.770

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.750

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.070

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.220

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.190
 from here effectively more limits than 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.629
 this world that people really go 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.300
 fifth to see if I can get inside 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:58.470
 of the podium to be a bit complicated 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:01.260
 but well let's try 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.610

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.769
 go first eye to see if we can get 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.390
 ok let's third eye eye that we can 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:12.030

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:21.269
 half we advance here that 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.730
 I would try only better seconds 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:25.470
 iberia and possibly we have fourth 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.480

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.950
 that you can not win is new is like 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.420
 as if there was no emotion you know as if 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.769
 once you put yourself first really 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.540
 it is very easy to win we can say it 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:37.440
 well, it does not matter if we were 16 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.519
 people that we were a button of 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.519
