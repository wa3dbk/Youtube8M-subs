I'm going to be setting up in moving my
electric<00:00:03.720> fence<00:00:03.929> today<00:00:04.110> so<00:00:04.529> the<00:00:05.310> first<00:00:05.580> thing

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
electric fence today so the first thing

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:07.760 
electric fence today so the first thing
that<00:00:05.850> I<00:00:06.029> did<00:00:06.299> is<00:00:06.480> I<00:00:06.569> went<00:00:06.720> ahead<00:00:06.839> and<00:00:07.080> took<00:00:07.560> my

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
that I did is I went ahead and took my

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.190 
that I did is I went ahead and took my
line<00:00:07.980> trimmer<00:00:08.309> and<00:00:08.580> trimmed<00:00:08.820> out<00:00:09.000> an<00:00:09.330> area

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
line trimmer and trimmed out an area

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.919 
line trimmer and trimmed out an area
roughly<00:00:10.590> the<00:00:10.860> length<00:00:11.309> of<00:00:11.700> basically<00:00:12.630> a<00:00:12.690> square

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
roughly the length of basically a square

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.430 
roughly the length of basically a square
area<00:00:13.230> roughly<00:00:13.679> the<00:00:14.719> perimeter<00:00:15.719> length<00:00:15.960> of<00:00:16.230> the

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
area roughly the perimeter length of the

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.160 
area roughly the perimeter length of the
fence<00:00:16.710> I'm<00:00:16.890> going<00:00:17.039> to<00:00:17.100> be<00:00:17.220> using<00:00:17.609> here<00:00:18.170> because

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
fence I'm going to be using here because

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.960 
fence I'm going to be using here because
you<00:00:19.260> don't<00:00:19.439> want<00:00:19.590> the<00:00:19.710> tall<00:00:19.920> grass<00:00:20.220> growing<00:00:20.820> up

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
you don't want the tall grass growing up

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.370 
you don't want the tall grass growing up
along<00:00:21.330> the<00:00:21.539> electric<00:00:21.990> because<00:00:22.080> what<00:00:22.260> will

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
along the electric because what will

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.170 
along the electric because what will
happen<00:00:22.680> is<00:00:22.800> it<00:00:22.980> will<00:00:23.039> constantly<00:00:23.490> trigger<00:00:24.029> the

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
happen is it will constantly trigger the

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.150 
happen is it will constantly trigger the
electric<00:00:24.570> which<00:00:24.750> will<00:00:24.960> eventually<00:00:25.680> burn<00:00:25.890> the

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
electric which will eventually burn the

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.050 
electric which will eventually burn the
battery<00:00:27.119> out<00:00:28.220> second<00:00:29.220> step<00:00:29.369> is<00:00:29.550> to<00:00:29.670> grab<00:00:29.820> your

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
battery out second step is to grab your

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.840 
battery out second step is to grab your
bundle<00:00:30.539> of<00:00:30.779> posts<00:00:31.380> and<00:00:31.650> then<00:00:32.130> shake<00:00:32.430> out<00:00:32.640> the

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
bundle of posts and then shake out the

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.410 
bundle of posts and then shake out the
fencing<00:00:33.329> and<00:00:33.450> then<00:00:34.050> start<00:00:34.469> from<00:00:34.739> the<00:00:34.890> first

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:35.420 
fencing and then start from the first

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.240 
fencing and then start from the first
one<00:00:36.420> of<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.600> end<00:00:36.750> posts<00:00:37.140> and<00:00:37.260> just<00:00:37.410> toss<00:00:38.010> it

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.380 
one of the end posts and just toss it
out<00:00:38.370> and<00:00:38.690> walk<00:00:39.690> backwards<00:00:40.370> and<00:00:41.370> then<00:00:41.910> drop<00:00:42.210> out

end post your first post of the fencing
and<00:01:01.430> it's<00:01:02.430> just<00:01:02.609> a<00:01:02.699> step<00:01:02.969> in<00:01:03.439> post<00:01:04.439> and<00:01:04.710> for

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
and it's just a step in post and for

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:06.800 
and it's just a step in post and for
your<00:01:05.640> end<00:01:05.790> one<00:01:06.000> you're<00:01:06.210> also<00:01:06.330> going<00:01:06.600> to<00:01:06.659> need

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
your end one you're also going to need

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.870 
your end one you're also going to need
some<00:01:07.049> support<00:01:07.470> so<00:01:08.390> these<00:01:09.390> are<00:01:09.600> fiberglass

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
some support so these are fiberglass

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.420 
some support so these are fiberglass
step<00:01:11.880> in<00:01:12.060> post<00:01:12.299> you<00:01:12.450> can't<00:01:12.630> use<00:01:12.750> metal<00:01:13.430> you've

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
step in post you can't use metal you've

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:20.060 
step in post you can't use metal you've
got<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:14.820> use<00:01:16.070> these<00:01:17.070> fiberglass<00:01:17.520> posts<00:01:19.070> you

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
got to use these fiberglass posts you

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.440 
got to use these fiberglass posts you
step<00:01:20.340> these<00:01:20.549> in<00:01:21.409> this<00:01:22.409> is<00:01:22.590> going<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:22.830> help<00:01:23.450> to

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
step these in this is going to help to

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.130 
step these in this is going to help to
give<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.900> end<00:01:25.500> post<00:01:25.830> some<00:01:26.070> stability<00:01:26.310> and

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 
give the end post some stability and

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.740 
give the end post some stability and
then<00:01:28.140> I'll<00:01:28.259> usually<00:01:28.409> just<00:01:28.710> take<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.070> top<00:01:29.750> rung

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
then I'll usually just take the top rung

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:39.390 
then I'll usually just take the top rung
here<00:01:31.110> and<00:01:31.259> just<00:01:31.409> tie<00:01:31.619> a<00:01:33.049> little<00:01:34.049> bow<00:01:34.380> tie<00:01:34.619> here

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:39.400 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.380 

don't<00:01:40.400> have<00:01:40.520> to<00:01:40.640> be<00:01:40.760> anything<00:01:41.000> special

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390

whatever sort of knot you want I just

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:47.290 
whatever sort of knot you want I just
tie<00:01:44.300> it<00:01:44.360> like<00:01:44.570> I<00:01:44.690> do<00:01:44.750> with<00:01:45.350> shoelaces<00:01:46.300> so

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:47.300 
tie it like I do with shoelaces so

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.030 
tie it like I do with shoelaces so
that's<00:01:47.480> pretty<00:01:47.720> sturdy<00:01:48.020> doing<00:01:48.440> step<00:01:48.710> in<00:01:48.860> posts

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 
that's pretty sturdy doing step in posts

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.180 
that's pretty sturdy doing step in posts
important<00:01:49.640> that<00:01:49.790> you<00:01:49.910> have<00:01:50.740> posts<00:01:51.740> nice<00:01:51.920> and

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:52.190 
important that you have posts nice and

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.490 
important that you have posts nice and
taut<00:01:54.070> otherwise<00:01:55.070> it's<00:01:55.310> going<00:01:55.430> to<00:01:55.490> sag<00:01:55.790> really

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
taut otherwise it's going to sag really

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:02.980 
taut otherwise it's going to sag really
really<00:01:57.500> bad<00:02:01.420> other<00:02:02.420> than<00:02:02.570> that's<00:02:02.690> pretty

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
really bad other than that's pretty

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:08.530 
really bad other than that's pretty
simple<00:02:03.320> just<00:02:03.650> pull<00:02:04.550> it<00:02:04.640> tight<00:02:04.820> and<00:02:05.890> then<00:02:07.540> push

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:08.540 
simple just pull it tight and then push

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:09.930 
simple just pull it tight and then push
it<00:02:08.660> in<00:02:08.720> the<00:02:08.810> ground<00:02:08.929> be<00:02:09.140> careful<00:02:09.470> don't<00:02:09.560> I

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
it in the ground be careful don't I

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.280 
it in the ground be careful don't I
usually<00:02:10.940> take<00:02:11.060> it<00:02:11.209> nice<00:02:11.330> and<00:02:11.390> easy<00:02:11.690> because<00:02:12.050> if

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
usually take it nice and easy because if

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.350 
usually take it nice and easy because if
you<00:02:12.380> hit<00:02:12.470> something<00:02:12.740> hard<00:02:13.040> it'll<00:02:13.430> you<00:02:14.120> could

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
you hit something hard it'll you could

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.020 
you hit something hard it'll you could
conceivably<00:02:14.750> bend<00:02:15.260> it<00:02:15.580> what<00:02:16.580> you<00:02:16.730> don't<00:02:16.880> want

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
conceivably bend it what you don't want

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:22.090 
conceivably bend it what you don't want
to<00:02:17.090> do<00:02:20.020> but<00:02:21.020> pretty<00:02:21.230> simple<00:02:21.620> then<00:02:21.740> you<00:02:21.770> when

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
to do but pretty simple then you when

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.220 
to do but pretty simple then you when
you<00:02:22.160> get<00:02:22.280> to<00:02:22.400> a<00:02:22.430> corner<00:02:22.880> and<00:02:23.060> you<00:02:23.870> need<00:02:24.020> some

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
you get to a corner and you need some

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.050 
you get to a corner and you need some
extra<00:02:24.290> support<00:02:24.890> you<00:02:24.980> just<00:02:25.130> need<00:02:25.370> to<00:02:25.459> use<00:02:25.700> one

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
extra support you just need to use one

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.199 
extra support you just need to use one
of<00:02:26.090> those<00:02:26.709> extra<00:02:27.709> step<00:02:27.950> in<00:02:28.130> support<00:02:28.550> posts<00:02:28.970> so

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
of those extra step in support posts so

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:30.820 
of those extra step in support posts so
the<00:02:29.300> fence<00:02:29.480> is<00:02:29.690> for<00:02:29.930> the<00:02:29.990> most<00:02:30.140> parts<00:02:30.440> set<00:02:30.680> up

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
the fence is for the most parts set up

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:32.500 
the fence is for the most parts set up
and<00:02:31.160> that<00:02:31.310> to<00:02:31.790> be<00:02:31.880> honest<00:02:32.150> with<00:02:32.270> you<00:02:32.360> that's

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
and that to be honest with you that's

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.900 
and that to be honest with you that's
definitely<00:02:33.230> the<00:02:33.470> most<00:02:33.740> time<00:02:34.220> consumptive

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
definitely the most time consumptive

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.780 
definitely the most time consumptive
most<00:02:35.660> difficult<00:02:36.170> part<00:02:36.470> if<00:02:37.250> your<00:02:37.430> soil<00:02:37.610> is

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
most difficult part if your soil is

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.310 
most difficult part if your soil is
relatively<00:02:38.150> soft<00:02:38.390> it<00:02:38.630> goes<00:02:38.810> really<00:02:39.080> easy

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
relatively soft it goes really easy

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.500 
relatively soft it goes really easy
you've<00:02:40.130> got<00:02:40.310> some<00:02:40.459> hard<00:02:40.610> soil<00:02:40.940> you<00:02:41.180> might<00:02:41.330> have

to I use like a I get some some really
hard<00:02:44.120> soil<00:02:44.390> occasionally<00:02:45.290> have<00:02:45.380> to<00:02:45.410> use<00:02:45.709> like

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
hard soil occasionally have to use like

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:49.509 
hard soil occasionally have to use like
a<00:02:46.390> hammer<00:02:47.390> and<00:02:47.690> just<00:02:47.870> lightly<00:02:48.500> tap<00:02:48.890> on<00:02:49.220> the

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:49.519 
a hammer and just lightly tap on the

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:51.490 
a hammer and just lightly tap on the
spikes<00:02:50.360> so<00:02:50.630> they<00:02:50.750> get<00:02:50.959> into<00:02:51.170> the<00:02:51.260> ground

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
spikes so they get into the ground

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:52.810 
spikes so they get into the ground
because<00:02:51.800> otherwise<00:02:51.980> you're<00:02:52.459> constantly

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:52.820 
because otherwise you're constantly

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:54.520 
because otherwise you're constantly
bending<00:02:53.570> the<00:02:53.810> post<00:02:54.019> as<00:02:54.200> you're<00:02:54.320> trying<00:02:54.440> to

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
bending the post as you're trying to

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:55.690 
bending the post as you're trying to
push<00:02:54.709> them<00:02:54.860> in<00:02:54.950> but<00:02:55.160> if<00:02:55.250> the<00:02:55.370> soil<00:02:55.640> is

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
push them in but if the soil is

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.820 
push them in but if the soil is
relatively<00:02:56.180> soft<00:02:56.390> and<00:02:56.750> good<00:02:57.350> it<00:02:57.530> goes<00:02:57.680> in

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830 
relatively soft and good it goes in

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:59.949 
relatively soft and good it goes in
really<00:02:58.310> really<00:02:58.430> easy<00:02:58.730> now<00:02:59.000> I<00:02:59.030> left<00:02:59.330> it<00:02:59.480> went

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
really really easy now I left it went

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:03.130 
really really easy now I left it went
ahead<00:03:00.019> and<00:03:00.140> left<00:03:00.350> the<00:03:00.920> last<00:03:01.130> two<00:03:01.400> posts<00:03:02.140> undone

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
ahead and left the last two posts undone

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.610 
ahead and left the last two posts undone
so<00:03:03.769> that<00:03:03.950> way<00:03:04.160> I<00:03:04.670> can<00:03:05.000> roll<00:03:05.360> the<00:03:05.600> chickens<00:03:05.930> coop

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
so that way I can roll the chickens coop

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.259 
so that way I can roll the chickens coop
in<00:03:06.830> I<00:03:07.040> can<00:03:07.190> get<00:03:07.280> them<00:03:07.489> in<00:03:07.519> and<00:03:07.820> then<00:03:07.910> I'll<00:03:08.030> shut

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:08.269 
in I can get them in and then I'll shut

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:10.570 
in I can get them in and then I'll shut
them<00:03:08.420> out<00:03:08.540> and<00:03:09.100> and<00:03:10.100> then<00:03:10.250> we'll<00:03:10.400> turn<00:03:10.519> the

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:10.580 
them out and and then we'll turn the

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:12.340 
them out and and then we'll turn the
electric<00:03:11.000> off<00:03:11.209> but<00:03:11.630> I<00:03:11.750> went<00:03:11.959> ahead<00:03:12.050> and<00:03:12.260> moved

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:12.350 
electric off but I went ahead and moved

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:14.800 
electric off but I went ahead and moved
all<00:03:12.620> the<00:03:12.769> chicken<00:03:13.209> waterers<00:03:14.209> and<00:03:14.480> their<00:03:14.570> coop

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.290 
all the chicken waterers and their coop
and<00:03:15.050> then<00:03:15.739> we<00:03:16.580> went<00:03:16.670> ahead<00:03:16.820> and<00:03:17.030> just<00:03:17.120> picked

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:17.300 
and then we went ahead and just picked

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:18.490 
and then we went ahead and just picked
the<00:03:17.390> chickens<00:03:17.690> up<00:03:17.810> and<00:03:18.019> just<00:03:18.110> put<00:03:18.290> them<00:03:18.380> into

the new pasture now if you've got a lot

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:21.670 
the new pasture now if you've got a lot
of<00:03:20.180> chickens<00:03:20.660> you<00:03:20.810> might<00:03:20.959> want<00:03:21.170> to<00:03:21.230> wait<00:03:21.380> till

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
of chickens you might want to wait till

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.949 
of chickens you might want to wait till
right<00:03:22.310> before<00:03:22.370> dark<00:03:22.820> to<00:03:23.090> do<00:03:23.209> it<00:03:23.360> and<00:03:23.540> then

right before dark to do it and then

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:25.720 
right before dark to do it and then
they'll<00:03:24.200> just<00:03:24.230> you<00:03:25.070> know<00:03:25.160> so<00:03:25.430> you<00:03:25.489> can<00:03:25.610> move

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:36.739 
is set up the power pack and the ground

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:39.850 
is set up the power pack and the ground
so<00:03:37.340> you<00:03:37.430> can<00:03:37.549> energize<00:03:37.700> the<00:03:38.150> fence<00:03:38.650> this<00:03:39.650> is

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:39.860 
so you can energize the fence this is

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.580 
so you can energize the fence this is
this<00:03:40.280> this<00:03:40.700> right<00:03:40.910> here<00:03:41.150> is<00:03:41.299> the<00:03:41.480> power<00:03:42.350> pack

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
this this right here is the power pack

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.680 
this this right here is the power pack
which<00:03:42.860> is<00:03:43.040> which<00:03:43.459> has<00:03:43.580> a<00:03:43.640> solar<00:03:43.910> panel<00:03:44.120> inside

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
which is which has a solar panel inside

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:50.250 
which is which has a solar panel inside
them<00:03:44.870> or<00:03:44.989> inside<00:03:45.950> are<00:03:46.070> two<00:03:46.220> batteries<00:03:46.670> and<00:03:47.590> the

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
them or inside are two batteries and the

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:51.970 
them or inside are two batteries and the
black<00:03:51.260> clamp<00:03:51.590> goes

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
black clamp goes

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.750 
black clamp goes
to<00:03:52.069> the<00:03:52.159> ground<00:03:52.430> the<00:03:53.000> red<00:03:53.209> clamp<00:03:54.489> red<00:03:55.489> clamp

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 
to the ground the red clamp red clamp

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.250 
to the ground the red clamp red clamp
goes<00:03:55.819> to<00:03:56.030> the<00:03:56.120> fence<00:03:56.330> so<00:03:56.930> what<00:03:57.019> we're<00:03:57.110> going<00:03:57.200> to

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
goes to the fence so what we're going to

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:58.420 
goes to the fence so what we're going to
do<00:03:57.349> is<00:03:57.440> go<00:03:57.560> ahead<00:03:57.620> and<00:03:57.739> install<00:03:57.950> the<00:03:58.159> ground

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
do is go ahead and install the ground

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:03.149 
do is go ahead and install the ground
and<00:03:58.730> the<00:03:59.150> ground<00:03:59.299> is<00:03:59.540> just<00:03:59.810> a<00:04:01.090> long<00:04:02.090> metal<00:04:02.450> post

00:04:03.149 --> 00:04:03.159 
and the ground is just a long metal post

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:14.080 
and the ground is just a long metal post
and<00:04:04.159> so<00:04:04.489> I<00:04:04.549> just<00:04:04.730> use<00:04:04.940> a<00:04:07.629> she's<00:04:08.629> a<00:04:08.660> hammer<00:04:12.370> and<00:04:13.370> I

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
and so I just use a she's a hammer and I

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.379 
and so I just use a she's a hammer and I
think<00:04:14.360> you<00:04:14.510> want<00:04:14.660> to<00:04:14.750> get<00:04:14.900> it<00:04:15.019> in<00:04:15.200> at<00:04:15.410> least

00:04:16.379 --> 00:04:16.389 
think you want to get it in at least

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:19.090 
think you want to get it in at least
eight<00:04:17.389> to<00:04:17.660> ten<00:04:17.840> inches<00:04:18.019> or<00:04:18.290> so<00:04:18.500> down<00:04:18.709> into<00:04:18.979> the

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:19.100 
eight to ten inches or so down into the

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:29.740 
eight to ten inches or so down into the
ground<00:04:26.470> it's<00:04:27.470> probably<00:04:27.830> good<00:04:27.979> enough<00:04:28.600> and<00:04:29.600> go

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 
ground it's probably good enough and go

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:34.420 
ground it's probably good enough and go
ahead<00:04:29.900> and<00:04:30.020> attach<00:04:32.560> that's<00:04:33.560> the<00:04:33.800> ground<00:04:34.039> black

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:34.430 
ahead and attach that's the ground black

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.240 
ahead and attach that's the ground black
clamp<00:04:34.729> to<00:04:34.880> the<00:04:34.970> ground<00:04:35.210> and<00:04:35.539> the<00:04:36.500> red<00:04:36.650> clamp

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250 
clamp to the ground and the red clamp

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:40.120 
clamp to the ground and the red clamp
it's<00:04:37.669> a<00:04:37.729> fence<00:04:37.940> so<00:04:38.650> the<00:04:39.650> only<00:04:39.770> other<00:04:39.949> thing<00:04:40.100> you

so<00:05:33.409> let<00:05:33.529> the<00:05:33.649> fence<00:05:33.889> part<00:05:34.189> hang<00:05:36.129> sometimes<00:05:37.129> you

00:05:37.269 --> 00:05:37.279 
so let the fence part hang sometimes you

00:05:37.279 --> 00:05:40.569 
so let the fence part hang sometimes you
get<00:05:37.459> point<00:05:37.969> where<00:05:38.089> you<00:05:39.159> or<00:05:40.159> you<00:05:40.219> can't<00:05:40.429> just

00:05:40.569 --> 00:05:40.579 
get point where you or you can't just

00:05:40.579 --> 00:05:42.069 
get point where you or you can't just
pull<00:05:40.759> it<00:05:40.879> out<00:05:40.969> of<00:05:40.999> ground<00:05:41.329> some<00:05:41.719> of<00:05:41.749> the<00:05:41.809> harder

00:05:42.069 --> 00:05:42.079 
pull it out of ground some of the harder

00:05:42.079 --> 00:05:50.800 
pull it out of ground some of the harder
ground

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:50.810 

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:52.540 

once<00:05:51.440> you've<00:05:51.560> bundled<00:05:51.980> all<00:05:52.070> the<00:05:52.190> posts

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:52.550 
once you've bundled all the posts

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:57.940 
once you've bundled all the posts
together<00:05:53.530> go<00:05:54.530> ahead<00:05:54.740> and<00:05:55.270> roll<00:05:56.270> up<00:05:56.480> the<00:05:56.950> posts

00:05:57.940 --> 00:05:57.950 
together go ahead and roll up the posts

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:02.140 
together go ahead and roll up the posts
in<00:05:58.040> the<00:05:58.130> fence<00:05:58.900> and<00:05:59.900> then<00:06:00.890> I<00:06:01.160> set<00:06:01.520> a<00:06:01.550> string<00:06:01.940> out

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:02.150 
in the fence and then I set a string out

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:03.790 
in the fence and then I set a string out
which<00:06:02.600> that<00:06:02.840> actually<00:06:03.200> comes<00:06:03.380> with<00:06:03.650> the

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:03.800 
which that actually comes with the

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:08.290 
which that actually comes with the
fencing<00:06:04.540> put<00:06:05.540> that<00:06:05.660> on<00:06:05.780> top<00:06:05.990> and<00:06:07.090> then<00:06:08.090> go

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:08.300 
fencing put that on top and then go

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:11.110 
fencing put that on top and then go
ahead<00:06:08.420> and<00:06:09.130> bundle<00:06:10.130> that<00:06:10.280> together<00:06:10.460> so<00:06:11.030> you

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:11.120 
ahead and bundle that together so you

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:15.520 
ahead and bundle that together so you
can<00:06:11.210> put<00:06:11.390> it<00:06:11.480> away<00:06:11.570> for<00:06:12.520> storage
