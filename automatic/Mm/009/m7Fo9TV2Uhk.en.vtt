00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
I'm not sure I don't really take ladder

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.860 
I'm not sure I don't really take ladder
too<00:02:17.129> seriously<00:02:17.549> sometimes<00:02:17.670> I<00:02:18.180> just<00:02:18.239> off<00:02:18.599> race

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
too seriously sometimes I just off race

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.490 
too seriously sometimes I just off race
or<00:02:19.109> try<00:02:19.409> out<00:02:19.530> new<00:02:19.560> builds<00:02:20.040> so<00:02:20.250> yeah<00:02:20.640> I<00:02:20.819> defended

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
or try out new builds so yeah I defended

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.610 
or try out new builds so yeah I defended
spectacularly<00:02:22.500> or<00:02:22.799> not<00:02:22.980> I<00:02:23.280> gotta<00:02:24.180> say<00:02:24.480> a<00:02:25.200> few

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
spectacularly or not I gotta say a few

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:26.899 
spectacularly or not I gotta say a few
of<00:02:25.739> the<00:02:25.799> times<00:02:26.040> when<00:02:26.310> I've<00:02:26.400> watched<00:02:26.700> you

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:26.909 
of the times when I've watched you

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:28.910 
of the times when I've watched you
ladder<00:02:27.209> it<00:02:27.629> almost<00:02:27.930> kind<00:02:28.109> of<00:02:28.260> seems<00:02:28.469> like<00:02:28.620> you

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
ladder it almost kind of seems like you

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.970 
ladder it almost kind of seems like you
just<00:02:29.329> do<00:02:30.329> whatever<00:02:30.629> you<00:02:30.989> feel<00:02:31.019> like<00:02:31.260> and<00:02:31.799> then

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
just do whatever you feel like and then

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.330 
just do whatever you feel like and then
somehow<00:02:32.250> it<00:02:32.400> turns<00:02:32.790> into<00:02:33.000> a<00:02:33.209> win<00:02:33.950> not<00:02:34.950> not<00:02:35.159> all

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
somehow it turns into a win not not all

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.160 
somehow it turns into a win not not all
the<00:02:35.489> time<00:02:35.640> of<00:02:35.849> course<00:02:36.000> but<00:02:36.150> it's<00:02:36.659> kind<00:02:36.870> of<00:02:36.930> cool

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
the time of course but it's kind of cool

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.660 
the time of course but it's kind of cool
how<00:02:37.409> you<00:02:37.439> can<00:02:37.709> just<00:02:37.920> take<00:02:38.129> whatever<00:02:38.370> you<00:02:38.640> have

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
how you can just take whatever you have

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.309 
how you can just take whatever you have
and<00:02:39.150> try<00:02:39.359> to<00:02:39.390> make<00:02:39.840> it<00:02:39.900> work<00:02:40.970> um<00:02:41.970> yeah<00:02:42.900> I<00:02:43.079> like

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
and try to make it work um yeah I like

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:44.660 
and try to make it work um yeah I like
to<00:02:43.409> think<00:02:43.500> of<00:02:43.590> myself<00:02:43.650> as<00:02:44.040> a<00:02:44.099> very<00:02:44.250> reactive

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
to think of myself as a very reactive

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.360 
to think of myself as a very reactive
player<00:02:45.060> but<00:02:45.540> just<00:02:46.079> the<00:02:46.200> nature<00:02:46.379> of<00:02:46.530> my<00:02:46.950> opening

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
player but just the nature of my opening

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.699 
player but just the nature of my opening
that<00:02:47.939> no<00:02:48.209> gasps<00:02:48.450> style<00:02:48.810> the<00:02:49.079> scouting

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
that no gasps style the scouting

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.580 
that no gasps style the scouting
information<00:02:50.489> is<00:02:50.549> really<00:02:50.760> limited<00:02:50.909> so

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
information is really limited so

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.869 
information is really limited so
sometimes<00:02:52.590> I<00:02:52.769> might<00:02:52.950> have<00:02:53.159> to<00:02:53.280> play<00:02:53.459> super

00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:53.879 
sometimes I might have to play super

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:56.420 
sometimes I might have to play super
defensively<00:02:54.299> or<00:02:54.659> you<00:02:55.079> know<00:02:55.200> do<00:02:55.650> yet<00:02:55.980> do<00:02:56.159> things

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
defensively or you know do yet do things

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.690 
defensively or you know do yet do things
that<00:02:56.700> might<00:02:57.629> not<00:02:57.750> be<00:02:57.810> optimum<00:02:58.459> that<00:02:59.459> does

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
that might not be optimum that does

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.330 
that might not be optimum that does
segue<00:03:00.209> pretty<00:03:00.569> well<00:03:00.840> into<00:03:01.470> the<00:03:01.590> next<00:03:01.739> question

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
segue pretty well into the next question

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.020 
segue pretty well into the next question
that<00:03:02.519> I<00:03:02.549> had<00:03:02.760> planned<00:03:03.090> because<00:03:03.659> uh<00:03:04.909> you<00:03:05.909> know

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
that I had planned because uh you know

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.030 
that I had planned because uh you know
when<00:03:06.299> it<00:03:06.389> comes<00:03:06.540> to<00:03:06.780> your<00:03:06.900> bill<00:03:07.139> it<00:03:07.560> has<00:03:07.769> a<00:03:07.799> lot

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
when it comes to your bill it has a lot

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.670 
when it comes to your bill it has a lot
of<00:03:08.069> strengths<00:03:08.669> but<00:03:08.819> it<00:03:08.970> does<00:03:09.150> seem<00:03:09.389> like

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
of strengths but it does seem like

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.080 
of strengths but it does seem like
probably<00:03:10.680> one<00:03:11.069> of<00:03:11.099> the<00:03:11.220> big<00:03:11.400> weaknesses<00:03:11.909> is

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
probably one of the big weaknesses is

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.300 
probably one of the big weaknesses is
not<00:03:12.239> really<00:03:12.540> knowing<00:03:12.720> what's<00:03:13.049> going<00:03:13.230> on<00:03:13.500> so

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
not really knowing what's going on so

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:15.649 
not really knowing what's going on so
whether<00:03:14.489> they're<00:03:14.760> preparing<00:03:15.209> a<00:03:15.389> really

00:03:15.649 --> 00:03:15.659 
whether they're preparing a really

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:19.159 
whether they're preparing a really
strong<00:03:15.930> all<00:03:16.230> in<00:03:16.879> or<00:03:17.879> whether<00:03:18.180> maybe<00:03:18.959> they're

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:19.169 
strong all in or whether maybe they're

00:03:19.169 --> 00:03:21.409 
strong all in or whether maybe they're
trying<00:03:19.470> to<00:03:19.560> kind<00:03:19.829> of<00:03:19.889> econ<00:03:20.370> cheesy<00:03:20.669> back<00:03:21.060> maybe

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:21.419 
trying to kind of econ cheesy back maybe

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:23.390 
trying to kind of econ cheesy back maybe
they're<00:03:21.629> grabbing<00:03:21.870> too<00:03:22.229> fast<00:03:22.530> expansions<00:03:23.250> and

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
they're grabbing too fast expansions and

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.039 
they're grabbing too fast expansions and
it's<00:03:23.579> kind<00:03:23.760> of<00:03:23.819> hard<00:03:24.120> for<00:03:24.419> you<00:03:24.479> to<00:03:24.599> find<00:03:24.840> that

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
it's kind of hard for you to find that

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:26.809 
it's kind of hard for you to find that
maybe<00:03:25.319> you<00:03:25.680> know<00:03:25.769> like<00:03:25.979> in<00:03:26.129> your<00:03:26.250> experience

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:26.819 
maybe you know like in your experience

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:28.939 
maybe you know like in your experience
as<00:03:27.019> people<00:03:28.019> are<00:03:28.109> becoming<00:03:28.260> more<00:03:28.739> familiar

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:28.949 
as people are becoming more familiar

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:30.979 
as people are becoming more familiar
with<00:03:29.280> your<00:03:29.609> style<00:03:29.909> and<00:03:30.060> as<00:03:30.209> it<00:03:30.419> became<00:03:30.690> popular

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
with your style and as it became popular

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:34.670

part<00:03:38.250> uh<00:03:38.489> when<00:03:39.389> I<00:03:39.419> first<00:03:39.690> released<00:03:40.049> the<00:03:40.169> guide

part uh when I first released the guide

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:42.439

i<00:03:47.989> think<00:03:48.989> this<00:03:49.109> one<00:03:49.169> guy<00:03:49.470> on<00:03:49.650> xenex<00:03:49.919> who<00:03:50.669> took

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
i think this one guy on xenex who took

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.770 
i think this one guy on xenex who took
out<00:03:51.209> mkp<00:03:51.979> so<00:03:52.979> they<00:03:53.819> kind<00:03:54.239> of<00:03:54.299> switched<00:03:54.569> up<00:03:54.690> to

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
out mkp so they kind of switched up to

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.750 
out mkp so they kind of switched up to
build<00:03:54.959> a<00:03:55.049> little<00:03:55.169> bit<00:03:55.379> like<00:03:55.680> Zinio<00:03:56.159> he<00:03:56.430> adds<00:03:56.639> a

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
build a little bit like Zinio he adds a

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.069 
build a little bit like Zinio he adds a
roach<00:03:56.909> worn<00:03:57.239> while<00:03:57.540> he's<00:03:57.689> thrown<00:03:57.900> down<00:03:58.019> the

00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:58.079 
roach worn while he's thrown down the

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:00.500 
roach worn while he's thrown down the
gas<00:03:58.349> and<00:03:58.739> then<00:03:58.859> the<00:03:58.949> other<00:03:58.979> guy<00:03:59.220> no<00:04:00.120> egos

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
gas and then the other guy no egos

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.319 
gas and then the other guy no egos
standard<00:04:01.079> muta<00:04:01.439> so<00:04:01.889> the<00:04:02.819> bills<00:04:03.000> kind<00:04:03.239> of

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:03.329 
standard muta so the bills kind of

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:05.569 
standard muta so the bills kind of
evolving<00:04:03.720> and<00:04:03.900> some<00:04:04.799> of<00:04:04.859> the<00:04:04.919> weaknesses<00:04:05.129> like

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:05.579 
evolving and some of the weaknesses like

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:07.250 
evolving and some of the weaknesses like
you<00:04:06.180> know<00:04:06.299> really<00:04:06.479> strong<00:04:06.810> blue<00:04:07.019> flame

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
you know really strong blue flame

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.140 
you know really strong blue flame
openers<00:04:07.650> like<00:04:07.889> one<00:04:08.129> rack<00:04:08.310> sephy<00:04:08.669> into<00:04:08.970> blue

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
openers like one rack sephy into blue

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.270 
openers like one rack sephy into blue
flame<00:04:09.439> isn't<00:04:10.439> really<00:04:10.620> as<00:04:10.709> effective<00:04:11.099> anymore

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
flame isn't really as effective anymore

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.999 
flame isn't really as effective anymore
so<00:04:11.729> it's<00:04:12.599> kind<00:04:12.989> of<00:04:13.049> rounding<00:04:13.769> out<00:04:13.859> and

00:04:13.999 --> 00:04:14.009 
so it's kind of rounding out and

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:16.219 
so it's kind of rounding out and
becoming<00:04:14.220> a<00:04:14.340> more<00:04:14.489> solid<00:04:14.699> build<00:04:14.970> order<00:04:15.229> it

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:16.229 
becoming a more solid build order it

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:18.319 
becoming a more solid build order it
does<00:04:16.470> seem<00:04:16.709> like<00:04:16.739> a<00:04:16.919> lot<00:04:17.039> of<00:04:17.220> the<00:04:17.549> the<00:04:18.060> really

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:18.329 
does seem like a lot of the the really

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:20.240 
does seem like a lot of the the really
strong<00:04:18.630> Korean<00:04:19.199> zergs<00:04:19.560> have<00:04:19.829> basically

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
strong Korean zergs have basically

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.339 
strong Korean zergs have basically
adopted<00:04:20.579> your<00:04:21.000> build<00:04:21.209> style<00:04:21.539> I<00:04:21.750> did<00:04:21.959> catch<00:04:22.169> I

00:04:22.339 --> 00:04:22.349 
adopted your build style I did catch I

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:24.800 
adopted your build style I did catch I
think<00:04:22.590> it<00:04:22.680> was<00:04:22.770> dong<00:04:23.010> Raghu<00:04:23.460> who<00:04:24.090> beat<00:04:24.479> marine

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
think it was dong Raghu who beat marine

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.209 
think it was dong Raghu who beat marine
came<00:04:25.080> the<00:04:25.200> other<00:04:25.229> night<00:04:25.409> with<00:04:25.710> it<00:04:25.889> that<00:04:26.130> was

came the other night with it that was

00:04:26.219 --> 00:04:27.210 
came the other night with it that was
