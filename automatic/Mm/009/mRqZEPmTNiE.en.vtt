00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
going to keep it alive it's going to

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:12.470 
going to keep it alive it's going to
make<00:04:11.280> the<00:04:11.400> wrestling<00:04:11.760> business<00:04:11.790> even<00:04:12.180> hotter

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
because it's going to be WCW versus w/e

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:17.150 
because it's going to be WCW versus w/e
and<00:04:15.959> granted<00:04:16.470> you<00:04:16.620> know<00:04:16.650> if<00:04:16.799> they<00:04:16.890> did<00:04:17.070> the

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
and granted you know if they did the

guarantees<00:04:18.720> they<00:04:18.840> would<00:04:18.959> have<00:04:19.049> continued

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
guarantees they would have continued

guarantees they would have continued
that<00:04:19.470> momentum<00:04:19.829> anyway<00:04:20.130> maybe<00:04:20.519> the<00:04:20.669> business

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
that momentum anyway maybe the business

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000 
that momentum anyway maybe the business
would<00:04:21.180> have<00:04:21.269> gone<00:04:21.419> to<00:04:21.720> a<00:04:22.109> down<00:04:22.409> period<00:04:22.680> in<00:04:22.860> 03

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
would have gone to a down period in 03

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.610 
would have gone to a down period in 03
04<00:04:23.580> but<00:04:24.390> the<00:04:24.570> bottom<00:04:24.810> line<00:04:24.840> is<00:04:24.960> Vince<00:04:25.289> is<00:04:25.440> kind

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
04 but the bottom line is Vince is kind

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:26.790 
04 but the bottom line is Vince is kind
