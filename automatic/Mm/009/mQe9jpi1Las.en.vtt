 hello welcome to the channel this time is 

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:09.490
 I bring a makeup that is made with a 

00:00:06.189 --> 00:00:12.100
 turquoise and navy blue and then 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:14.680
 let's start by applying a corrector 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:17.080
 from adhara paris I use it as a base 

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:19.360
 of shadows I put it as much as up and 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:22.300
 down on the lower eyelids and 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:25.779
 top later with a broach for 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:28.570
 blur I took from a byte of visu that 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:31.689
 is number 9 this shadow that is coral 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:34.109
 and apply to the eye socket only 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:37.629
 to mark it as a transition 

00:00:34.109 --> 00:00:43.510
 after the quartet of visu number 17 

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:46.089
 with a brush a little in your pyrite I took 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.559
 the most coffee shadow of this quartet and the 

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:51.179
 Apply in the eye socket to 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:51.179
 start to mark a depth 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:01:00.140
 and then I took this individual shadow of 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:02.420
 vision that is the 63 aquarium that has 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.930
 flashes and with a flat brush the 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:07.510
 Apply on all the mobile eyelid to 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:11.440
 light taps 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:15.070
 with a brush equal chubby take a 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:17.140
 little blue shadow of a palette 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:20.080
 from a brand called beauty truites 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:24.130
 cosmetics and apply it in the basin of 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:26.500
 eye and I also used a little broach 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:29.230
 sponge to apply this same tone of 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.240
 shadow but on the lower lashes and 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:33.760
 later I used this same 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.880
 brochita but to apply the tone 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:39.070
 Aquarium of the individual shadow of seen 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.800

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:44.250
 inner part of the eye 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:47.130
 after this quartet of visu number 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.690
 22 I took the shadow more clearly with a 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.570
 sponge brush that has as 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:54.090
 destinations this shadow and apply it in the 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.760

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.970
 up and down 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:03.420
 then use a broach just like that 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:05.610
 It gave me chubby and I put this coffee shadow 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.100
 again just to give it an intensity 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:11.160

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:14.260
