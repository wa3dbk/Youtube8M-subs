has<00:01:32.429> articulation<00:01:33.440> back<00:01:34.440> here<00:01:34.800> at<00:01:35.130> his<00:01:35.520> but<00:01:36.119> I

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
has articulation back here at his but I

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.889 
has articulation back here at his but I
guess<00:01:36.630> you'd<00:01:37.110> call<00:01:37.140> it<00:01:37.429> spends<00:01:38.429> their<00:01:38.729> end<00:01:39.690> at

00:01:39.889 --> 00:01:39.899 
guess you'd call it spends their end at

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:42.139 
guess you'd call it spends their end at
the<00:01:39.929> middle<00:01:40.319> of<00:01:40.440> his<00:01:40.560> tail<00:01:40.800> there<00:01:41.039> and<00:01:42.000> I'd

00:01:42.139 --> 00:01:42.149 
the middle of his tail there and I'd

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:45.560 
the middle of his tail there and I'd
spend<00:01:42.630> a<00:01:42.720> tip<00:01:43.079> and<00:01:43.320> cool<00:01:44.280> thing<00:01:44.460> about<00:01:44.579> it<00:01:44.880> you

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
spend a tip and cool thing about it you

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.330 
spend a tip and cool thing about it you
can<00:01:45.780> like<00:01:45.990> take<00:01:46.409> the<00:01:46.439> pieces<00:01:46.799> of<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.100> tail<00:01:47.310> off

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
can like take the pieces of the tail off

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.450 
can like take the pieces of the tail off
so<00:01:47.909> it<00:01:48.149> looks<00:01:48.390> like<00:01:48.560> he<00:01:49.560> did<00:01:49.710> in<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:49.979> battle<00:01:50.310> I

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
so it looks like he did in the battle I

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.370 
so it looks like he did in the battle I
recruit<00:01:51.060> him<00:01:51.210> through<00:01:51.570> the<00:01:51.659> destructor<00:01:52.170> disc

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
recruit him through the destructor disc

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:58.200
