what you see here in these these areas
all<00:00:07.680> through<00:00:08.599> here<00:00:09.599> is<00:00:10.139> the<00:00:10.380> microleakage

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
all through here is the microleakage

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:12.050 
all through here is the microleakage
that's<00:00:11.280> occurred<00:00:11.580> underneath<00:00:11.940> the

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:12.060 
that's occurred underneath the

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:14.600 
that's occurred underneath the
provisional<00:00:12.540> restorations<00:00:13.460> there<00:00:14.460> are<00:00:14.520> some

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
provisional restorations there are some

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:15.830 
provisional restorations there are some
staining<00:00:14.970> to<00:00:15.180> that<00:00:15.330> so<00:00:15.540> we're<00:00:15.660> going<00:00:15.750> to

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:15.840 
staining to that so we're going to

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.320 
staining to that so we're going to
remove<00:00:16.170> that<00:00:16.199> obviously<00:00:16.920> we<00:00:17.100> need<00:00:17.310> to<00:00:17.519> before

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
remove that obviously we need to before

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.490 
remove that obviously we need to before
we<00:00:18.770> start<00:00:19.770> our<00:00:19.940> bonding<00:00:20.940> procedures<00:00:21.450> and<00:00:21.600> what

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
we start our bonding procedures and what

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.930 
we start our bonding procedures and what
you're<00:00:22.619> going<00:00:22.740> to<00:00:22.830> see<00:00:23.039> here<00:00:23.369> is<00:00:23.520> we're<00:00:23.850> going

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:23.940 
you're going to see here is we're going

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:26.900 
you're going to see here is we're going
to<00:00:24.000> use<00:00:24.210> a<00:00:24.860> product<00:00:25.860> called<00:00:26.039> super<00:00:26.490> awk<00:00:26.640> saw

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
to use a product called super awk saw

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.880 
to use a product called super awk saw
and<00:00:27.779> what<00:00:27.869> you'll<00:00:28.080> notice<00:00:28.260> is<00:00:28.619> that<00:00:30.710> it<00:00:31.710> just

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
and what you'll notice is that it just

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.649 
and what you'll notice is that it just
literally<00:00:32.219> dissolves<00:00:32.850> away<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.390> the

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:35.659 
literally dissolves away the the

00:00:35.659 --> 00:00:37.969 
literally dissolves away the the
staining<00:00:36.659> that's<00:00:36.960> on<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.229> teeth<00:00:37.440> here<00:00:37.710> also

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:37.979 
staining that's on the teeth here also

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:46.729 
staining that's on the teeth here also
what<00:00:38.370> you'll<00:00:38.550> see<00:00:38.760> is<00:00:38.940> some<00:00:39.530> whole<00:00:40.530> net<00:00:45.739> see
