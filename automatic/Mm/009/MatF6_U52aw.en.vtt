00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:04.190 

in<00:00:01.979> this<00:00:02.220> video<00:00:02.639> we<00:00:03.210> are<00:00:03.300> going<00:00:03.480> to<00:00:03.629> discuss<00:00:04.049> a

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
in this video we are going to discuss a

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.190 
in this video we are going to discuss a
very<00:00:04.589> important<00:00:05.490> concept<00:00:06.089> and<00:00:06.299> that<00:00:07.140> concept

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
very important concept and that concept

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.830 
very important concept and that concept
is<00:00:08.010> about<00:00:08.420> finding<00:00:09.420> a<00:00:09.599> highest<00:00:10.380> common<00:00:10.950> factor

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:11.840 
is about finding a highest common factor

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.720 
is about finding a highest common factor
now<00:00:12.840> if<00:00:13.049> you<00:00:13.200> see<00:00:13.469> the<00:00:13.620> word<00:00:13.830> highest<00:00:14.280> common

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
now if you see the word highest common

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.300 
now if you see the word highest common
factor<00:00:14.759> which<00:00:15.299> is<00:00:15.389> also<00:00:15.660> abbreviated<00:00:15.870> as<00:00:16.440> h<00:00:16.680> c

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
factor which is also abbreviated as h c

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.470 
factor which is also abbreviated as h c
f<00:00:17.550> the<00:00:18.420> word<00:00:18.600> common<00:00:19.050> factor<00:00:19.939> is<00:00:20.939> already<00:00:21.390> in

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
f the word common factor is already in

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.310 
f the word common factor is already in
it<00:00:21.630> and<00:00:21.869> just<00:00:22.650> to<00:00:22.859> summarize<00:00:24.019> we<00:00:25.019> have<00:00:25.170> already

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
it and just to summarize we have already

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.320 
it and just to summarize we have already
discussed<00:00:25.920> about<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.430> common<00:00:26.820> factors

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
discussed about the common factors

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.929 
discussed about the common factors
earlier<00:00:27.810> so<00:00:28.470> what<00:00:28.619> are<00:00:28.769> common<00:00:29.070> factors<00:00:29.519> as<00:00:29.670> we

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
earlier so what are common factors as we

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.669 
earlier so what are common factors as we
know<00:00:30.090> that<00:00:30.119> when<00:00:30.449> we<00:00:30.630> take<00:00:30.810> a<00:00:30.840> pair<00:00:31.140> of<00:00:31.199> more

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
know that when we take a pair of more

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.470 
know that when we take a pair of more
than<00:00:31.830> two<00:00:32.040> numbers<00:00:32.460> we<00:00:32.669> like<00:00:32.850> their<00:00:33.030> factors

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
than two numbers we like their factors

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.229 
than two numbers we like their factors
and<00:00:33.719> which<00:00:34.380> other<00:00:34.530> factors<00:00:35.100> occur<00:00:35.670> in<00:00:36.000> all

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
and which other factors occur in all

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.510 
and which other factors occur in all
those<00:00:37.140> numbers<00:00:37.680> they<00:00:37.920> are<00:00:37.950> said<00:00:38.190> common

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
those numbers they are said common

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.330 
those numbers they are said common
factors<00:00:38.969> so<00:00:39.540> if<00:00:39.690> we<00:00:39.899> take<00:00:40.050> an<00:00:40.230> example<00:00:40.379> let<00:00:41.280> us

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
factors so if we take an example let us

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.030 
factors so if we take an example let us
say<00:00:41.640> that<00:00:41.670> we<00:00:42.090> take<00:00:42.329> a<00:00:42.510> pair<00:00:42.719> of<00:00:42.930> numbers<00:00:43.170> yes

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
say that we take a pair of numbers yes

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.979 
say that we take a pair of numbers yes
12<00:00:44.910> and<00:00:45.620> 16<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:46.980> then<00:00:47.910> we<00:00:48.059> write<00:00:48.239> down<00:00:48.510> the

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
12 and 16 and then we write down the

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.830 
12 and 16 and then we write down the
factors<00:00:49.739> for<00:00:50.070> both<00:00:50.280> of<00:00:50.489> these<00:00:50.670> so<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.390> factors

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
factors for both of these so the factors

00:00:51.840 --> 00:01:03.349 
factors for both of these so the factors
for<00:00:52.170> 12<00:00:52.590> will<00:00:53.430> be<00:00:53.640> 1<00:00:54.829> 2<00:00:56.210> 3<00:00:58.039> 4<00:00:59.629> 6<00:01:00.629> and<00:01:00.989> 12<00:01:02.359> then

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
for 12 will be 1 2 3 4 6 and 12 then

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.479 
for 12 will be 1 2 3 4 6 and 12 then
what<00:01:03.570> are<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.780> factors<00:01:04.199> for<00:01:04.229> 16<00:01:04.860> there<00:01:05.400> will

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
what are the factors for 16 there will

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:11.240 
what are the factors for 16 there will
be<00:01:05.580> 1<00:01:06.380> 2<00:01:07.380> 3<00:01:07.729> is<00:01:08.729> not<00:01:08.880> a<00:01:08.939> factor<00:01:09.479> 4<00:01:09.810> is<00:01:10.020> a<00:01:10.049> factor<00:01:10.650> 8

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
be 1 2 3 is not a factor 4 is a factor 8

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.429 
be 1 2 3 is not a factor 4 is a factor 8
is<00:01:11.520> a<00:01:11.549> factor<00:01:12.119> and<00:01:12.619> 16<00:01:13.619> is<00:01:13.830> a<00:01:13.890> factor<00:01:14.430> now<00:01:15.439> which

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
is a factor and 16 is a factor now which

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.310 
is a factor and 16 is a factor now which
factors<00:01:16.890> are<00:01:16.920> common<00:01:17.490> for<00:01:17.700> both<00:01:17.909> 12<00:01:18.479> and<00:01:18.960> 16

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
factors are common for both 12 and 16

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.660 
factors are common for both 12 and 16
other<00:01:19.590> than<00:01:19.830> 1<00:01:20.040> so<00:01:20.670> we<00:01:20.820> see<00:01:21.030> that<00:01:21.210> 2<00:01:21.630> is<00:01:21.869> common

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
other than 1 so we see that 2 is common

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.200 
other than 1 so we see that 2 is common
we<00:01:23.670> also<00:01:23.820> see<00:01:24.150> that<00:01:24.180> 4<00:01:24.990> is<00:01:25.259> common<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:26.210> is

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
we also see that 4 is common and is

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.390 
we also see that 4 is common and is
there<00:01:27.630> any<00:01:27.810> other<00:01:28.110> number<00:01:28.619> that<00:01:28.650> we<00:01:28.950> can<00:01:29.130> see

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
there any other number that we can see

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.270 
there any other number that we can see
which<00:01:29.610> is<00:01:29.759> common<00:01:30.150> here<00:01:30.180> nope<00:01:31.079> so<00:01:31.560> 4<00:01:31.799> is<00:01:31.829> common

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
which is common here nope so 4 is common

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.969 
which is common here nope so 4 is common
now<00:01:33.119> highest<00:01:33.750> common<00:01:33.990> factor<00:01:34.020> simply<00:01:34.680> means

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
now highest common factor simply means

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.510 
now highest common factor simply means
that<00:01:35.400> amongst<00:01:36.180> these<00:01:36.600> common<00:01:37.259> factors<00:01:37.770> which

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
that amongst these common factors which

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.390 
that amongst these common factors which
one<00:01:38.759> is<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.150> highest<00:01:39.439> so<00:01:40.439> in<00:01:40.590> this<00:01:40.740> case<00:01:41.040> if<00:01:41.250> we

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
one is the highest so in this case if we

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.420 
one is the highest so in this case if we
see<00:01:41.579> full<00:01:42.240> is<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.720> highest<00:01:43.409> number<00:01:43.560> is<00:01:44.250> the

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
see full is the highest number is the

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:51.499 
see full is the highest number is the
highest<00:01:44.909> common<00:01:45.299> factor<00:01:45.710> 3<00:01:46.710> so<00:01:47.250> 4<00:01:47.520> 12<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:48.240> 16<00:01:50.509> 8

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
highest common factor 3 so 4 12 and 16 8

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.670 
highest common factor 3 so 4 12 and 16 8
4<00:01:51.710> is<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:53.210> HCF<00:01:54.240> or<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.869> highest<00:01:55.079> common

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
4 is the HCF or the highest common

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.819 
4 is the HCF or the highest common
factor<00:01:56.240> so<00:01:57.240> now<00:01:57.360> let<00:01:57.509> us<00:01:57.540> formally<00:01:57.930> define<00:01:58.409> the

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
factor so now let us formally define the

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.920 
factor so now let us formally define the
meaning<00:01:59.130> of<00:01:59.250> highest<00:01:59.729> common<00:02:00.149> factor<00:02:00.180> let's

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
meaning of highest common factor let's

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.530 
meaning of highest common factor let's
say<00:02:01.710> F<00:02:01.799> of<00:02:01.950> 2<00:02:02.640> or<00:02:02.939> more<00:02:03.630> given<00:02:04.320> numbers<00:02:04.799> is<00:02:05.070> the

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:05.540 
say F of 2 or more given numbers is the

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.380 
say F of 2 or more given numbers is the
highest<00:02:06.540> or<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:07.680> greatest<00:02:07.979> of<00:02:08.399> their<00:02:08.849> common

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
highest or the greatest of their common

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.890 
highest or the greatest of their common
factors<00:02:09.989> that<00:02:10.289> is<00:02:10.530> what<00:02:10.739> it<00:02:10.950> is

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
factors that is what it is

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:17.300 
factors that is what it is
xcf<00:02:12.900> is<00:02:13.230> also<00:02:13.920> quite<00:02:14.750> well<00:02:15.750> known<00:02:15.989> as<00:02:16.260> a<00:02:16.500> GCD

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
xcf is also quite well known as a GCD

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.610 
xcf is also quite well known as a GCD
greatest<00:02:17.849> common<00:02:18.270> devisor<00:02:18.630> and<00:02:18.870> this<00:02:19.319> name<00:02:19.500> is

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
greatest common devisor and this name is

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.140 
greatest common devisor and this name is
quite<00:02:19.830> intuitive<00:02:20.310> GCD<00:02:21.239> because<00:02:22.670> if<00:02:23.670> you<00:02:23.940> look

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
quite intuitive GCD because if you look

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.520 
quite intuitive GCD because if you look
at<00:02:24.239> it<00:02:24.390> in<00:02:24.540> a<00:02:24.630> different<00:02:24.660> way

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
at it in a different way

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.790 
at it in a different way
GCD<00:02:26.459> is<00:02:26.489> nothing<00:02:27.030> but<00:02:27.300> the<00:02:27.480> biggest<00:02:27.800> number

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
GCD is nothing but the biggest number

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.120 
GCD is nothing but the biggest number
that<00:02:29.100> is<00:02:29.880> an<00:02:30.000> exact<00:02:30.630> division<00:02:31.020> of<00:02:31.530> both<00:02:31.950> the

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
that is an exact division of both the

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.250 
that is an exact division of both the
numbers<00:02:32.489> pondered<00:02:33.060> upon<00:02:33.150> this<00:02:33.480> for<00:02:33.750> a<00:02:33.780> while

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
numbers pondered upon this for a while

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.010 
numbers pondered upon this for a while
it<00:02:34.500> is<00:02:34.650> a<00:02:34.680> biggest<00:02:35.100> number<00:02:35.670> that<00:02:35.880> isn't<00:02:36.360> exact

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
it is a biggest number that isn't exact

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.670 
it is a biggest number that isn't exact
the<00:02:37.290> wizard<00:02:37.590> for<00:02:37.830> both<00:02:38.220> the<00:02:38.430> numbers<00:02:39.080> so<00:02:40.080> you

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
the wizard for both the numbers so you

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.770 
the wizard for both the numbers so you
can<00:02:40.950> so<00:02:41.519> when<00:02:41.670> you<00:02:41.790> divide<00:02:42.060> both<00:02:42.390> of<00:02:42.450> these

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
can so when you divide both of these

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.440 
can so when you divide both of these
numbers<00:02:43.459> right<00:02:44.459> when<00:02:44.730> you<00:02:44.819> can<00:02:44.970> divide<00:02:45.239> both

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
numbers right when you can divide both

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.910 
numbers right when you can divide both
of<00:02:45.510> these<00:02:45.750> numbers<00:02:45.810> with<00:02:46.470> this<00:02:46.680> HCF<00:02:47.540> right<00:02:48.920> the

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
of these numbers with this HCF right the

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.640 
of these numbers with this HCF right the
resulting<00:02:50.900> divisions<00:02:51.900> right<00:02:52.110> the<00:02:52.260> resulting

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
resulting divisions right the resulting

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.830 
resulting divisions right the resulting
packets<00:02:53.130> into<00:02:53.970> what<00:02:54.180> you<00:02:54.269> had<00:02:54.390> read<00:02:54.510> it<00:02:54.690> will

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
packets into what you had read it will

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:00.320 
packets into what you had read it will
be<00:02:54.959> this<00:02:55.140> smallest<00:02:55.950> ones<00:02:56.340> so<00:02:57.299> and<00:02:58.230> now<00:02:59.220> for<00:02:59.910> 12

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
be this smallest ones so and now for 12

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.600 
be this smallest ones so and now for 12
and<00:03:00.510> 16<00:03:00.630> we<00:03:01.440> found<00:03:01.890> out<00:03:02.069> straight<00:03:02.340> away<00:03:02.370> that

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
and 16 we found out straight away that

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.180 
and 16 we found out straight away that
holds<00:03:03.060> the<00:03:03.180> xen<00:03:03.630> but<00:03:04.049> what<00:03:04.260> would<00:03:04.470> if<00:03:04.830> we<00:03:05.040> have

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
holds the xen but what would if we have

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:06.680 
holds the xen but what would if we have
more<00:03:05.519> than<00:03:05.700> two<00:03:05.880> numbers<00:03:06.299> fills<00:03:06.540> that<00:03:06.660> a

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
more than two numbers fills that a

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.660 
more than two numbers fills that a
formal<00:03:07.080> way<00:03:07.290> to<00:03:07.319> find<00:03:07.739> out<00:03:07.950> the<00:03:07.980> X<00:03:08.220> here<00:03:08.400> for<00:03:08.640> a

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
formal way to find out the X here for a

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.850 
formal way to find out the X here for a
given<00:03:08.790> set<00:03:09.120> of<00:03:09.239> numbers<00:03:09.600> so<00:03:10.200> yes<00:03:10.380> that<00:03:10.620> is<00:03:10.830> a

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
given set of numbers so yes that is a

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.970 
given set of numbers so yes that is a
method<00:03:11.190> to<00:03:11.400> do<00:03:11.640> so<00:03:11.670> and<00:03:12.140> this<00:03:13.140> I<00:03:13.410> have<00:03:13.830> outlined

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
method to do so and this I have outlined

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.590 
method to do so and this I have outlined
the<00:03:14.250> method<00:03:14.610> shield<00:03:14.880> which<00:03:15.150> I<00:03:15.299> will<00:03:15.480> be

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
the method shield which I will be

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:20.810 
the method shield which I will be
explaining<00:03:16.019> in<00:03:16.230> the<00:03:16.739> next<00:03:17.209> slide<00:03:18.209> on<00:03:19.730> with<00:03:20.730> an

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
explaining in the next slide on with an

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.330 
explaining in the next slide on with an
example<00:03:21.209> so<00:03:21.959> the<00:03:22.170> first<00:03:22.410> thing<00:03:22.620> we<00:03:22.739> do<00:03:22.859> is<00:03:23.070> we

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
example so the first thing we do is we

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.030 
example so the first thing we do is we
do<00:03:23.489> a<00:03:23.519> prime<00:03:23.940> factorization<00:03:24.230> for<00:03:25.230> each<00:03:25.500> of<00:03:25.739> the

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
do a prime factorization for each of the

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.970 
do a prime factorization for each of the
numbers<00:03:26.480> then<00:03:27.480> we<00:03:27.900> get<00:03:28.079> the<00:03:28.320> common<00:03:28.769> prime

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
numbers then we get the common prime

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.340 
numbers then we get the common prime
factors<00:03:29.010> for<00:03:29.700> all<00:03:29.850> the<00:03:30.030> numbers<00:03:30.450> and<00:03:30.690> then

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
factors for all the numbers and then

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.470 
factors for all the numbers and then
what<00:03:31.950> we<00:03:32.070> do<00:03:32.190> is<00:03:32.370> we<00:03:32.519> multiply<00:03:32.670> the<00:03:33.030> common

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
what we do is we multiply the common

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.430 
what we do is we multiply the common
factors<00:03:33.930> to<00:03:34.140> get<00:03:34.620> the<00:03:34.769> HCF<00:03:35.280> or<00:03:35.459> GCD<00:03:36.209> now<00:03:36.870> this

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
factors to get the HCF or GCD now this

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.110 
factors to get the HCF or GCD now this
doesn't<00:03:37.650> definitely<00:03:38.370> make<00:03:38.549> sense<00:03:38.820> at<00:03:39.000> the

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
doesn't definitely make sense at the

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.520 
doesn't definitely make sense at the
moment<00:03:39.480> but<00:03:39.810> will<00:03:39.989> make<00:03:40.170> sense<00:03:40.590> when<00:03:41.280> we<00:03:41.430> start

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
moment but will make sense when we start

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:46.130 
moment but will make sense when we start
discussing<00:03:43.530> is<00:03:43.799> with<00:03:43.950> an<00:03:44.100> example<00:03:44.579> so<00:03:45.030> in<00:03:45.930> this

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
discussing is with an example so in this

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.270 
discussing is with an example so in this
case<00:03:46.440> what<00:03:46.829> we<00:03:47.010> have<00:03:47.040> taken<00:03:47.459> is<00:03:48.859> we<00:03:49.859> have<00:03:50.040> taken

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
case what we have taken is we have taken

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:55.849 
case what we have taken is we have taken
three<00:03:51.060> numbers<00:03:51.480> 20<00:03:52.370> 28<00:03:53.370> and<00:03:53.790> 36<00:03:54.299> and<00:03:54.750> now<00:03:55.410> we

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:55.859 
three numbers 20 28 and 36 and now we

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:57.470 
three numbers 20 28 and 36 and now we
have<00:03:56.040> to<00:03:56.160> find<00:03:56.430> out<00:03:56.579> X<00:03:56.880> here<00:03:57.120> for<00:03:57.390> these

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
have to find out X here for these

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.880 
have to find out X here for these
numbers<00:03:57.750> so<00:03:58.440> this<00:03:58.620> is<00:03:58.769> our<00:03:59.010> step<00:03:59.459> one<00:04:00.890> which

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
numbers so this is our step one which

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.160 
numbers so this is our step one which
says<00:04:02.190> that<00:04:02.220> we<00:04:02.609> do<00:04:02.790> a<00:04:02.819> prime<00:04:03.180> factorizations

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
says that we do a prime factorizations

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.050 
says that we do a prime factorizations
for<00:04:04.769> all<00:04:04.980> these<00:04:05.280> numbers<00:04:05.760> and<00:04:05.790> if<00:04:05.970> you

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
for all these numbers and if you

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:07.160 
for all these numbers and if you
remember<00:04:06.390> the<00:04:06.510> method<00:04:06.810> for<00:04:06.959> prime

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
remember the method for prime

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.680 
remember the method for prime
factorization<00:04:07.889> we<00:04:08.370> start<00:04:08.670> with<00:04:09.030> the<00:04:09.420> number

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
factorization we start with the number

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:13.250 
factorization we start with the number
two<00:04:10.489> right<00:04:11.489> and<00:04:11.790> then<00:04:12.090> try<00:04:12.480> dividing<00:04:13.139> this

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
two right and then try dividing this

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.140 
two right and then try dividing this
number<00:04:13.319> so<00:04:13.739> when<00:04:13.859> I<00:04:13.950> divide<00:04:14.130> two<00:04:14.549> with<00:04:14.700> 20<00:04:15.120> I

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
number so when I divide two with 20 I

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.080 
number so when I divide two with 20 I
have<00:04:15.630> ten<00:04:15.959> is<00:04:16.169> the<00:04:16.200> remainder<00:04:16.739> then<00:04:17.370> ten<00:04:17.700> ten<00:04:17.970> B

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
have ten is the remainder then ten ten B

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:19.250 
have ten is the remainder then ten ten B
/<00:04:18.450> -<00:04:18.630> yes

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
/ - yes

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:23.620 
/ - yes
then<00:04:20.070> we<00:04:20.250> get<00:04:20.400> five<00:04:20.789> now<00:04:21.390> five<00:04:21.720> cannot<00:04:22.260> three<00:04:22.890> I

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
then we get five now five cannot three I

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:26.600 
then we get five now five cannot three I
cannot<00:04:24.630> use<00:04:24.840> three<00:04:25.080> to<00:04:25.229> divide<00:04:25.470> five<00:04:25.770> I<00:04:26.039> have

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
cannot use three to divide five I have

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.260 
cannot use three to divide five I have
to<00:04:26.849> use<00:04:27.060> five<00:04:27.770> so<00:04:28.770> this<00:04:28.890> gives<00:04:29.159> me<00:04:29.250> one<00:04:29.610> finally

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
to use five so this gives me one finally

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.080 
to use five so this gives me one finally
right<00:04:30.900> that<00:04:31.080> is<00:04:31.200> I<00:04:31.409> I<00:04:31.710> can<00:04:31.919> divide<00:04:32.159> five<00:04:32.820> and

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090 
right that is I I can divide five and

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.000 
right that is I I can divide five and
the<00:04:33.210> dimension<00:04:33.539> will<00:04:33.690> be<00:04:33.810> zero<00:04:34.169> that<00:04:34.200> is<00:04:34.440> we

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.010 
the dimension will be zero that is we

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:38.360 
the dimension will be zero that is we
can<00:04:35.159> divide<00:04:35.400> this<00:04:35.580> then<00:04:36.539> we<00:04:37.380> find<00:04:37.830> out<00:04:38.010> do<00:04:38.220> the

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
can divide this then we find out do the

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.670 
can divide this then we find out do the
prime<00:04:38.550> factorization<00:04:38.580> for<00:04:39.419> this<00:04:39.750> number<00:04:40.020> 28

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
prime factorization for this number 28

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.630 
prime factorization for this number 28
so<00:04:41.400> again<00:04:41.640> I<00:04:41.760> start<00:04:42.090> with<00:04:42.300> 2<00:04:42.539> so<00:04:43.020> 2<00:04:43.080> when<00:04:43.620> x<00:04:44.099> 14

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:44.640 
so again I start with 2 so 2 when x 14

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:47.719 
so again I start with 2 so 2 when x 14
gives<00:04:44.880> me<00:04:45.090> 20<00:04:45.510> page<00:04:45.750> when<00:04:46.650> 2<00:04:46.890> is<00:04:47.010> multiplied<00:04:47.550> by

00:04:47.719 --> 00:04:47.729 
gives me 20 page when 2 is multiplied by

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:52.969 
gives me 20 page when 2 is multiplied by
7<00:04:48.419> gives<00:04:48.720> me<00:04:49.440> 14<00:04:49.830> now<00:04:50.250> I<00:04:50.550> cannot<00:04:51.150> divide<00:04:51.930> 7<00:04:52.440> by<00:04:52.470> 3

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:52.979 
7 gives me 14 now I cannot divide 7 by 3

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:56.270 
7 gives me 14 now I cannot divide 7 by 3
meters<00:04:53.700> by<00:04:53.880> 5<00:04:54.180> and<00:04:54.539> so<00:04:55.440> the<00:04:55.620> prime<00:04:55.890> number<00:04:56.190> that

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
meters by 5 and so the prime number that

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.969 
meters by 5 and so the prime number that
comes<00:04:56.520> over<00:04:56.820> here<00:04:57.000> is<00:04:57.180> 7<00:04:57.539> and<00:04:57.750> I<00:04:58.590> have<00:04:58.680> to

00:04:58.969 --> 00:04:58.979 
comes over here is 7 and I have to

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:01.130 
comes over here is 7 and I have to
multiply<00:04:59.070> 7<00:04:59.640> by<00:04:59.669> 1<00:04:59.970> to<00:05:00.090> get<00:05:00.210> 7<00:05:00.539> so<00:05:00.570> this<00:05:00.840> is<00:05:00.960> what

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:01.140 
multiply 7 by 1 to get 7 so this is what

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:03.350 
multiply 7 by 1 to get 7 so this is what
I<00:05:01.169> get<00:05:01.500> here<00:05:01.710> and<00:05:01.950> now<00:05:02.610> let<00:05:02.789> us<00:05:02.820> do<00:05:03.000> the<00:05:03.150> prime

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 
I get here and now let us do the prime

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.260 
I get here and now let us do the prime
factorization<00:05:03.440> for<00:05:04.440> 36<00:05:04.979> again<00:05:05.520> I<00:05:05.849> start<00:05:06.120> with

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
factorization for 36 again I start with

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:09.770 
factorization for 36 again I start with
the<00:05:06.360> number<00:05:06.390> 2<00:05:06.870> so<00:05:07.830> 2<00:05:07.890> when<00:05:08.460> multiplied<00:05:09.090> by<00:05:09.270> 18

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:09.780 
the number 2 so 2 when multiplied by 18

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:15.230 
the number 2 so 2 when multiplied by 18
gives<00:05:10.200> me<00:05:10.380> 36<00:05:11.120> then<00:05:12.120> can<00:05:12.599> I<00:05:12.960> divide<00:05:13.820> 18<00:05:14.820> by<00:05:14.849> 2

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:15.240 
gives me 36 then can I divide 18 by 2

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:21.080 
gives me 36 then can I divide 18 by 2
yes<00:05:15.840> we<00:05:16.320> can<00:05:16.680> so<00:05:17.580> 2<00:05:17.970> +<00:05:18.360> x<00:05:18.840> 9<00:05:19.409> will<00:05:20.370> give<00:05:20.520> me<00:05:20.700> 18

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:21.090 
yes we can so 2 + x 9 will give me 18

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:24.770 
yes we can so 2 + x 9 will give me 18
then<00:05:21.539> we<00:05:21.919> 3<00:05:22.919> is<00:05:23.159> the<00:05:23.310> next<00:05:23.490> prime<00:05:23.880> number<00:05:24.270> so<00:05:24.450> 3

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:24.780 
then we 3 is the next prime number so 3

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:28.040 
then we 3 is the next prime number so 3
when<00:05:24.960> x<00:05:25.409> 3<00:05:25.770> keeps<00:05:26.010> me<00:05:26.159> going<00:05:26.460> and<00:05:26.580> I<00:05:27.210> can<00:05:27.479> divide

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.050 
when x 3 keeps me going and I can divide

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:31.310 
when x 3 keeps me going and I can divide
3<00:05:28.380> exactly<00:05:29.039> when<00:05:29.220> I<00:05:29.250> multiply<00:05:29.700> it<00:05:29.760> by<00:05:29.880> 1<00:05:30.140> so<00:05:31.140> now

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:31.320 
3 exactly when I multiply it by 1 so now

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:35.210 
3 exactly when I multiply it by 1 so now
people<00:05:32.280> write<00:05:32.580> down<00:05:32.820> the<00:05:33.599> common<00:05:34.020> factors<00:05:34.530> as

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:35.220 
people write down the common factors as

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:38.800 
people write down the common factors as
shown<00:05:35.610> below<00:05:35.760> so<00:05:36.030> so<00:05:36.180> that<00:05:36.300> is<00:05:36.419> the<00:05:36.539> step<00:05:36.780> two

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:38.810 
shown below so so that is the step two

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:41.029 
shown below so so that is the step two
so<00:05:39.810> what<00:05:39.960> we<00:05:40.110> are<00:05:40.200> doing<00:05:40.229> is<00:05:40.560> now<00:05:40.770> we<00:05:40.830> are

00:05:41.029 --> 00:05:41.039 
so what we are doing is now we are

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:44.000 
so what we are doing is now we are
writing<00:05:41.340> down<00:05:41.370> all<00:05:41.760> the<00:05:41.820> factors<00:05:42.450> here<00:05:42.539> so<00:05:43.320> the

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:44.010 
writing down all the factors here so the

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:48.500 
writing down all the factors here so the
factors<00:05:44.460> that<00:05:44.490> we<00:05:44.820> see<00:05:45.060> here<00:05:45.539> is<00:05:47.150> so<00:05:48.150> first<00:05:48.390> it

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:48.510 
factors that we see here is so first it

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:50.209 
factors that we see here is so first it
is<00:05:48.599> write<00:05:48.780> down<00:05:48.810> the<00:05:49.080> factors<00:05:49.500> and<00:05:49.530> identify

00:05:50.209 --> 00:05:50.219 
is write down the factors and identify

00:05:50.219 --> 00:05:54.820 
is write down the factors and identify
which<00:05:50.400> ones<00:05:50.640> are<00:05:50.849> common<00:05:51.300> so<00:05:52.200> let<00:05:53.099> me<00:05:53.250> just

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:54.830 
which ones are common so let me just

00:05:54.830 --> 00:06:05.050 
which ones are common so let me just
remove<00:05:55.830> this<00:05:56.690> so<00:05:57.690> for<00:05:57.840> 20<00:05:58.700> we<00:05:59.700> have<00:06:00.260> 2<00:06:01.260> x<00:06:02.250> 2<00:06:02.960> x<00:06:03.960> 5

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:05.060 
remove this so for 20 we have 2 x 2 x 5

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:15.620 
remove this so for 20 we have 2 x 2 x 5
for<00:06:06.060> the<00:06:06.270> number<00:06:06.659> 28<00:06:07.620> the<00:06:08.390> factors<00:06:09.390> are<00:06:12.530> 2<00:06:14.060> x<00:06:15.060> 2

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:15.630 
for the number 28 the factors are 2 x 2

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:30.129 
for the number 28 the factors are 2 x 2
x<00:06:16.500> 7<00:06:17.219> and<00:06:17.840> for<00:06:20.390> 36<00:06:22.070> the<00:06:23.070> factors<00:06:23.580> are<00:06:23.880> 2<00:06:25.430> x<00:06:26.430> 2<00:06:26.839> x<00:06:27.839> 3

00:06:30.129 --> 00:06:30.139 
x 7 and for 36 the factors are 2 x 2 x 3

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:32.010 
x 7 and for 36 the factors are 2 x 2 x 3
multiplied<00:06:30.530> by<00:06:30.560> three<00:06:31.009> now<00:06:31.460> we<00:06:31.520> have<00:06:31.789> to

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:32.020 
multiplied by three now we have to

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:35.409 
multiplied by three now we have to
identify<00:06:33.020> the<00:06:33.080> common<00:06:33.530> factors<00:06:34.310> here<00:06:34.669> so<00:06:35.300> the

00:06:35.409 --> 00:06:35.419 
identify the common factors here so the

00:06:35.419 --> 00:06:38.830 
identify the common factors here so the
common<00:06:35.749> factors<00:06:36.169> here<00:06:36.409> if<00:06:36.530> you<00:06:36.680> see<00:06:36.949> is<00:06:37.840> two

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:38.840 
common factors here if you see is two

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:41.730 
common factors here if you see is two
this<00:06:39.229> two<00:06:39.469> occurs<00:06:39.860> in<00:06:40.189> all<00:06:40.639> the<00:06:40.909> three<00:06:41.150> and

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:41.740 
this two occurs in all the three and

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:46.779 
this two occurs in all the three and
these<00:06:42.740> this<00:06:43.490> two<00:06:43.779> also<00:06:44.779> occurs<00:06:45.229> in<00:06:45.469> all<00:06:46.159> the<00:06:46.610> in

00:06:46.779 --> 00:06:46.789 
these this two also occurs in all the in

00:06:46.789 --> 00:06:49.300 
these this two also occurs in all the in
this<00:06:47.240> the<00:06:47.840> prime<00:06:48.020> factorizations<00:06:48.650> of<00:06:48.830> all<00:06:49.099> the

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:49.310 
this the prime factorizations of all the

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:54.249 
this the prime factorizations of all the
three<00:06:49.550> numbers<00:06:50.919> now<00:06:52.330> once<00:06:53.330> we<00:06:53.479> have<00:06:53.509> do<00:06:54.139> we

00:06:54.249 --> 00:06:54.259 
three numbers now once we have do we

00:06:54.259 --> 00:06:57.459 
three numbers now once we have do we
find<00:06:54.499> any<00:06:54.800> other<00:06:55.300> common<00:06:56.300> factors<00:06:56.779> appearing

00:06:57.459 --> 00:06:57.469 
find any other common factors appearing

00:06:57.469 --> 00:07:00.249 
find any other common factors appearing
in<00:06:57.590> this<00:06:57.740> answer<00:06:58.520> is<00:06:58.849> no<00:06:59.060> so<00:06:59.599> then<00:06:59.810> we<00:06:59.990> come<00:07:00.229> to

00:07:00.249 --> 00:07:00.259 
in this answer is no so then we come to

00:07:00.259 --> 00:07:04.510 
in this answer is no so then we come to
step<00:07:00.949> three<00:07:02.110> in<00:07:03.110> which<00:07:03.379> we<00:07:03.620> take<00:07:03.830> the<00:07:03.889> products

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:04.520 
step three in which we take the products

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:07.420 
step three in which we take the products
of<00:07:04.610> the<00:07:04.939> common<00:07:05.479> factors<00:07:06.050> so<00:07:06.620> we<00:07:06.650> have<00:07:06.979> two

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:07.430 
of the common factors so we have two

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:10.330 
of the common factors so we have two
multiplied<00:07:08.210> by<00:07:08.240> two<00:07:08.449> which<00:07:09.319> is<00:07:09.349> equal<00:07:09.560> to<00:07:10.009> four

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:10.340 
multiplied by two which is equal to four

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:14.860 
multiplied by two which is equal to four
so<00:07:10.669> we<00:07:11.659> can<00:07:11.810> say<00:07:12.080> that<00:07:12.379> the<00:07:13.009> xef4<00:07:13.849> the<00:07:14.539> numbers

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:14.870 
so we can say that the xef4 the numbers

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:19.089 
so we can say that the xef4 the numbers
20<00:07:15.409> 28<00:07:16.069> and<00:07:16.310> 36<00:07:16.759> is<00:07:17.180> 4<00:07:17.629> so<00:07:18.289> again<00:07:18.469> this<00:07:18.860> means

00:07:19.089 --> 00:07:19.099 
20 28 and 36 is 4 so again this means

00:07:19.099 --> 00:07:22.540 
20 28 and 36 is 4 so again this means
that<00:07:19.370> 4<00:07:19.789> is<00:07:20.029> the<00:07:20.210> highest<00:07:20.779> number<00:07:21.339> amongst<00:07:22.339> the

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:22.550 
that 4 is the highest number amongst the

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:25.089 
that 4 is the highest number amongst the
factors<00:07:22.969> of<00:07:23.180> these<00:07:23.419> 3<00:07:23.750> numbers<00:07:23.990> which<00:07:24.919> will

00:07:25.089 --> 00:07:25.099 
factors of these 3 numbers which will

00:07:25.099 --> 00:07:27.540 
factors of these 3 numbers which will
divide<00:07:25.400> all<00:07:25.729> these<00:07:26.029> three<00:07:26.270> numbers<00:07:26.599> exactly

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:27.550 
divide all these three numbers exactly

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:33.129 
divide all these three numbers exactly
so<00:07:28.550> that<00:07:28.580> is<00:07:28.849> how<00:07:28.999> we<00:07:29.300> go<00:07:29.539> about<00:07:29.569> finding<00:07:30.259> xen
