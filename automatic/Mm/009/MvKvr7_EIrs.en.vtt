00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.340 
first what i do is start out by putting
my<00:00:46.710> turkey<00:00:47.239> onto<00:00:48.239> my<00:00:48.450> whole<00:00:48.690> wheat<00:00:48.870> tortilla

and then i add some string cheese and i

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.810 
and then i add some string cheese and i
just<00:00:52.410> like<00:00:52.530> to<00:00:52.680> pull<00:00:52.890> these<00:00:53.039> apart<00:00:53.100> and<00:00:53.640> just

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
just like to pull these apart and just

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:13.190 
just like to pull these apart and just
use<00:00:53.940> one<00:00:54.180> of<00:00:54.210> them<00:00:54.480> on<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.379> whole<00:00:55.590> sandwich

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.350 

then<00:01:14.200> I<00:01:14.230> like<00:01:14.710> to<00:01:14.830> take<00:01:14.980> my<00:01:15.040> lettuce<00:01:15.670> and<00:01:15.910> put

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:16.360 
then I like to take my lettuce and put

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.710 
then I like to take my lettuce and put
that<00:01:16.600> all<00:01:16.870> across<00:01:17.410> the<00:01:17.950> wrap<00:01:18.430> and<00:01:18.730> this<00:01:19.390> adds<00:01:19.600> a

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:19.720 
that all across the wrap and this adds a

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.480 
that all across the wrap and this adds a
lot<00:01:19.840> of<00:01:19.900> texture<00:01:20.350> and<00:01:20.590> also<00:01:20.920> helps<00:01:21.250> me<00:01:21.370> get

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.490 
lot of texture and also helps me get

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.400 
lot of texture and also helps me get
some<00:01:21.700> greens<00:01:22.000> in<00:01:22.300> so<00:01:22.570> that's<00:01:22.750> good<00:01:23.020> and<00:01:23.050> then<00:01:23.380> I

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:23.410 
some greens in so that's good and then I

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:25.230 
some greens in so that's good and then I
just<00:01:23.680> roll<00:01:23.890> it<00:01:24.010> up<00:01:24.130> and<00:01:24.160> cut<00:01:24.610> it<00:01:24.700> in<00:01:24.790> half<00:01:24.820> so

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
just roll it up and cut it in half so

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.940 
just roll it up and cut it in half so
that<00:01:25.390> it<00:01:25.480> will<00:01:25.570> fit<00:01:25.630> in<00:01:25.930> a<00:01:25.990> plastic<00:01:26.230> baggie<00:01:26.680> and

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
that it will fit in a plastic baggie and

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.040 
that it will fit in a plastic baggie and
I<00:01:27.400> usually<00:01:27.760> prep<00:01:28.060> like<00:01:28.360> two<00:01:28.570> or<00:01:28.720> three<00:01:28.750> of

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:29.050 
I usually prep like two or three of

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:30.570 
I usually prep like two or three of
these<00:01:29.200> at<00:01:29.410> once<00:01:29.440> so<00:01:29.890> that<00:01:29.920> I<00:01:30.070> can<00:01:30.190> just<00:01:30.430> have

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:30.580 
these at once so that I can just have

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:31.740 
these at once so that I can just have
them<00:01:30.610> throughout<00:01:31.000> the<00:01:31.150> week<00:01:31.300> because<00:01:31.600> I<00:01:31.690> think

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
them throughout the week because I think

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.450 
them throughout the week because I think
they<00:01:31.960> taste<00:01:32.170> so<00:01:32.320> good<00:01:32.620> and<00:01:32.860> I<00:01:32.920> don't<00:01:32.980> get<00:01:33.280> sick

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 
they taste so good and I don't get sick

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.000 
they taste so good and I don't get sick
of<00:01:33.580> them<00:01:33.700> at<00:01:33.850> all<00:01:34.000> and<00:01:34.480> then<00:01:35.470> I<00:01:35.560> just<00:01:35.770> wrapped

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:36.010 
of them at all and then I just wrapped

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:37.650 
of them at all and then I just wrapped
them<00:01:36.190> up<00:01:36.340> and<00:01:36.580> have<00:01:36.730> them<00:01:36.910> already<00:01:37.120> in<00:01:37.570> the

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:37.660 
them up and have them already in the

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.240 
them up and have them already in the
fridge<00:01:37.870> for<00:01:38.050> my<00:01:38.200> lunches<00:01:38.590> so<00:01:38.740> I<00:01:38.800> can<00:01:38.950> just<00:01:39.070> grab

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250

using this Myers tmobile broccoli which

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.450 
using this Myers tmobile broccoli which
is<00:01:43.780> really<00:01:43.990> awesome<00:01:44.050> it<00:01:44.440> saves<00:01:44.619> a<00:01:44.740> ton<00:01:44.979> of<00:01:45.040> time

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
is really awesome it saves a ton of time

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.000 
is really awesome it saves a ton of time
and<00:01:45.790> then<00:01:46.270> I<00:01:46.390> just<00:01:46.450> separate<00:01:46.960> these<00:01:47.110> into<00:01:47.650> some

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:48.010 
and then I just separate these into some

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:50.430 
and then I just separate these into some
Tupperware<00:01:48.490> containers<00:01:49.030> so<00:01:49.780> that<00:01:50.050> I<00:01:50.080> can<00:01:50.200> just

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:50.440 
Tupperware containers so that I can just

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.020 
Tupperware containers so that I can just
grab<00:01:50.830> them<00:01:51.010> again<00:01:51.280> and<00:01:51.400> take<00:01:51.550> them<00:01:51.760> to<00:01:51.790> work

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
grab them again and take them to work

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:53.640 
grab them again and take them to work
with<00:01:52.210> me<00:01:52.360> in<00:01:52.510> the<00:01:52.630> morning<00:01:52.660> which<00:01:53.110> is<00:01:53.140> so<00:01:53.500> much

with me in the morning which is so much
more<00:01:53.680> convenient<00:01:54.160> and<00:01:54.520> then<00:01:55.000> usually<00:01:55.300> I<00:01:55.330> grab

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570
