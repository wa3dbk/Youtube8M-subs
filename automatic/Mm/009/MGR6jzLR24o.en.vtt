00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:15.830 
competent you were the clear winner that

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:18.010 
competent you were the clear winner that
was<00:04:16.070> absolute<00:04:16.970> carnage<00:04:17.239> did<00:04:17.750> you<00:04:17.810> enjoy<00:04:17.989> that

yeah<00:04:18.530> what's<00:04:18.739> my<00:04:18.890> furnace<00:04:19.340> I<00:04:19.910> had<00:04:20.270> no<00:04:20.480> idea

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:20.510 
yeah what's my furnace I had no idea

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:22.750 
yeah what's my furnace I had no idea
something<00:04:21.200> that<00:04:21.440> small<00:04:21.799> could<00:04:22.280> do<00:04:22.400> the<00:04:22.610> amount

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:22.760 
something that small could do the amount

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.850 
something that small could do the amount
of<00:04:22.850> damage<00:04:23.180> now<00:04:23.660> I<00:04:23.690> reckon<00:04:24.200> if<00:04:24.260> we<00:04:24.380> had<00:04:24.530> a<00:04:24.560> robot

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 
of damage now I reckon if we had a robot

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:26.530 
of damage now I reckon if we had a robot
like<00:04:24.980> that<00:04:25.220> in<00:04:25.490> the<00:04:25.640> real<00:04:25.760> wars<00:04:26.120> it<00:04:26.300> would<00:04:26.420> do

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:26.540 
like that in the real wars it would do

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:29.110 
like that in the real wars it would do
pretty<00:04:26.780> well<00:04:27.430> you've<00:04:28.430> got<00:04:28.580> a<00:04:28.610> team<00:04:28.850> taking

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 
pretty well you've got a team taking

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.960 
pretty well you've got a team taking
part<00:04:29.450> I've<00:04:30.050> got<00:04:30.320> a<00:04:30.770> heavy<00:04:31.400> weight<00:04:31.580> which<00:04:31.760> isn't

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:31.970 
part I've got a heavy weight which isn't

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:33.880 
part I've got a heavy weight which isn't
actually<00:04:32.060> a<00:04:32.240> mission<00:04:32.630> hoping<00:04:33.530> to<00:04:33.560> finish<00:04:33.710> it

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:33.890 
actually a mission hoping to finish it

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:36.820 
actually a mission hoping to finish it
off<00:04:33.980> for<00:04:34.130> next<00:04:34.340> year<00:04:34.520> so<00:04:34.790> that<00:04:35.320> is<00:04:36.320> a<00:04:36.380> spiked

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
off for next year so that is a spiked

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:38.470 
off for next year so that is a spiked
one<00:04:37.040> rather<00:04:37.250> than<00:04:37.430> a<00:04:37.640> rotating<00:04:38.120> one<00:04:38.270> lever

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:38.480

one rather than a rotating one lever
maybe<00:04:38.720> I'm<00:04:38.900> exchange<00:04:39.320> of<00:04:39.440> mind<00:04:39.590> on<00:04:39.770> them<00:04:40.570> but

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 
maybe I'm exchange of mind on them but
