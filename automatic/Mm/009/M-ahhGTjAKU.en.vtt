00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
temperature so it's nice and easy to

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.050 
temperature so it's nice and easy to
scoop<00:02:09.410> out<00:02:09.619> but<00:02:10.009> just<00:02:10.190> to<00:02:10.280> show<00:02:10.429> you<00:02:10.459> -<00:02:10.820> nine

scoop out but just to show you - nine

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.630 
scoop out but just to show you - nine
hundred<00:02:11.480> mils<00:02:11.660> equals<00:02:12.260> 450<00:02:12.980> grams<00:02:13.220> so<00:02:13.430> pretty

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
hundred mils equals 450 grams so pretty

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.670 
hundred mils equals 450 grams so pretty
much<00:02:13.760> half<00:02:14.060> of<00:02:14.360> them<00:02:14.780> Italy<00:02:14.989> is<00:02:15.140> easy<00:02:15.410> ground

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
much half of them Italy is easy ground

much half of them Italy is easy ground
so<00:02:15.980> if<00:02:16.040> you're<00:02:16.130> wondering<00:02:16.400> about<00:02:16.459> conversions

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
so if you're wondering about conversions

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:18.640 
so if you're wondering about conversions
and<00:02:17.239> stuff<00:02:17.420> so<00:02:17.870> I'm<00:02:17.930> going<00:02:18.079> to<00:02:18.140> go<00:02:18.200> for<00:02:18.440> about

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
and stuff so I'm going to go for about

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.920 
and stuff so I'm going to go for about
250<00:02:19.549> grams<00:02:19.579> which<00:02:20.030> is<00:02:20.120> probably<00:02:20.480> about<00:02:20.750> that

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
250 grams which is probably about that

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.930 
250 grams which is probably about that
anyway<00:02:21.320> put<00:02:21.950> them<00:02:22.070> straight<00:02:22.519> in<00:02:22.730> there<00:02:22.910> and

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
anyway put them straight in there and

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.910 
anyway put them straight in there and
pour<00:02:23.570> the<00:02:23.690> milk<00:02:23.900> in<00:02:24.049> to<00:02:24.320> bring<00:02:24.500> out<00:02:24.620> little

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
pour the milk in to bring out little

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.000 
pour the milk in to bring out little
yeah<00:02:25.340> it<00:02:25.579> goes<00:02:25.730> 250<00:02:26.450> mils<00:02:26.660> of<00:02:26.870> milk<00:02:27.140> so<00:02:27.620> equal

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
yeah it goes 250 mils of milk so equal

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.830 
yeah it goes 250 mils of milk so equal
measures<00:02:28.280> as<00:02:28.489> I<00:02:28.549> say<00:02:28.730> straight<00:02:29.239> over<00:02:29.570> there

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
measures as I say straight over there

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.560 
measures as I say straight over there
oh<00:02:29.870> yeah<00:02:30.440> last<00:02:31.400> but<00:02:31.640> not<00:02:31.730> least<00:02:32.000> is<00:02:32.180> our<00:02:32.299> Oreo

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
bits they've taken about a tablespoon of

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:35.800 
bits they've taken about a tablespoon of
it<00:02:34.280> out<00:02:34.430> just<00:02:34.700> to<00:02:34.820> reserve<00:02:35.150> to<00:02:35.329> sprinkle<00:02:35.720> the

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
it out just to reserve to sprinkle the

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.840 
it out just to reserve to sprinkle the
top<00:02:35.989> so<00:02:36.410> the<00:02:36.500> rest<00:02:36.739> is<00:02:36.980> actually<00:02:37.549> going<00:02:37.670> to<00:02:37.760> go

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
top so the rest is actually going to go

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:38.830 
top so the rest is actually going to go

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:48.370 
want our very stuff flying all over the
kitchen<00:02:47.329> well<00:02:47.600> that<00:02:47.720> would<00:02:47.840> be<00:02:47.870> kind<00:02:48.079> of<00:02:48.170> cool

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
kitchen well that would be kind of cool

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.990 
kitchen well that would be kind of cool
let's<00:02:48.890> go<00:02:49.010> for<00:02:49.280> it

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.840 

boom<00:02:52.960> that<00:02:53.320> was<00:02:53.470> only<00:02:53.680> 15<00:02:53.980> seconds<00:02:54.430> check<00:02:54.670> out

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850 
boom that was only 15 seconds check out

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:55.350 
boom that was only 15 seconds check out
that<00:02:55.000> color

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
that color

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.940 
that color
if<00:02:55.480> I<00:02:55.570> get<00:02:55.780> my<00:02:55.900> other<00:02:56.080> question<00:02:56.440> you<00:02:56.860> could

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
if I get my other question you could

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.710 
if I get my other question you could
probably<00:02:57.130> see<00:02:57.340> better<00:02:57.460> than<00:02:57.610> I<00:02:57.670> can<00:02:57.730> that<00:02:58.150> it's

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
probably see better than I can that it's

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.150 
probably see better than I can that it's
very<00:02:58.990> similar<00:02:59.290> let's<00:02:59.620> get<00:02:59.770> it<00:02:59.860> in<00:02:59.920> a<00:02:59.980> glass

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
very similar let's get it in a glass
