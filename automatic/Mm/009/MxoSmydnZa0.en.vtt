and<00:00:05.490> I<00:00:05.580> didn't<00:00:05.850> mean<00:00:05.970> just<00:00:06.180> any<00:00:06.390> Scott<00:00:06.690> base<00:00:06.899> I

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
and I didn't mean just any Scott base I

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.200 
and I didn't mean just any Scott base I
meant<00:00:07.440> I<00:00:07.620> wanted<00:00:07.859> something<00:00:08.189> really<00:00:08.670> tall<00:00:08.910> I

how to stack things how to creat
multi-story<00:00:21.779> basis<00:00:22.230> and<00:00:22.470> i<00:00:23.100> asked<00:00:23.340> you<00:00:23.400> guys

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
multi-story basis and i asked you guys

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.099 
multi-story basis and i asked you guys
to<00:00:23.789> build<00:00:23.970> a<00:00:24.090> sky<00:00:24.269> base<00:00:24.480> and<00:00:24.720> that<00:00:24.840> is<00:00:24.930> exactly

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
to build a sky base and that is exactly

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.130 
to build a sky base and that is exactly
what<00:00:25.680> i<00:00:25.740> got<00:00:26.039> in<00:00:26.310> turn<00:00:26.849> around<00:00:27.119> just<00:00:27.480> do<00:00:27.630> reveal

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
what i got in turn around just do reveal

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.030 
what i got in turn around just do reveal
this<00:00:28.320> thing<00:00:29.300> look<00:00:30.300> at<00:00:30.420> this<00:00:30.539> monolith<00:00:31.199> just<00:00:31.890> up

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
this thing look at this monolith just up

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.010 
this thing look at this monolith just up
in<00:00:32.309> the<00:00:32.430> sky<00:00:32.669> this<00:00:32.730> is<00:00:32.969> exactly<00:00:33.540> what<00:00:33.870> I<00:00:33.899> was

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
in the sky this is exactly what I was

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.080 
in the sky this is exactly what I was
looking<00:00:34.079> for<00:00:34.430> apparently<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.520> Builder<00:00:35.820> could

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
looking for apparently the Builder could

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.569 
looking for apparently the Builder could
have<00:00:36.180> gone<00:00:36.360> further<00:00:36.660> but<00:00:37.050> creating<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.219> floor

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
have gone further but creating the floor

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.880 
have gone further but creating the floor
platform<00:00:39.180> up<00:00:39.360> there<00:00:39.390> is<00:00:39.809> very<00:00:40.559> time-consuming

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
platform up there is very time-consuming

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.760 
platform up there is very time-consuming
and<00:00:41.640> to<00:00:42.270> build<00:00:42.450> all<00:00:42.750> those<00:00:42.899> platforms<00:00:43.170> way

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
and to build all those platforms way

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.569 
and to build all those platforms way
away<00:00:44.070> way<00:00:44.250> out<00:00:44.690> and<00:00:45.690> all<00:00:45.930> those<00:00:46.050> blueprints<00:00:46.579> so

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
away way out and all those blueprints so

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.850 
away way out and all those blueprints so
basically<00:00:48.360> just<00:00:48.629> got<00:00:48.750> tired<00:00:48.809> but<00:00:49.350> you<00:00:49.379> could

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
basically just got tired but you could

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.569 
basically just got tired but you could
push<00:00:50.219> this<00:00:50.430> further<00:00:50.670> and<00:00:51.120> I<00:00:51.510> definitely

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:52.579 
push this further and I definitely

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:55.670 
push this further and I definitely
considering<00:00:53.579> it<00:00:53.730> myself<00:00:54.180> so<00:00:55.020> walking<00:00:55.260> on<00:00:55.530> up

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
considering it myself so walking on up

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.119 
considering it myself so walking on up
we've<00:00:55.890> got<00:00:55.920> two<00:00:56.730> fires<00:00:57.570> on<00:00:57.989> 8th<00:00:58.559> other<00:00:58.829> side

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
we've got two fires on 8th other side

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.119 
we've got two fires on 8th other side
obviously<00:00:59.520> a<00:01:00.300> great<00:01:00.690> thing<00:01:01.079> to<00:01:01.109> have<00:01:01.379> keep

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
obviously a great thing to have keep

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.509 
obviously a great thing to have keep
them<00:01:02.370> stocked<00:01:02.640> up<00:01:02.940> we<00:01:03.570> can<00:01:03.719> have<00:01:03.780> a<00:01:04.170> ton<00:01:04.860> more

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
them stocked up we can have a ton more

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.399 
them stocked up we can have a ton more
defense<00:01:05.909> this<00:01:06.060> year<00:01:06.119> we<00:01:06.390> can<00:01:06.510> out<00:01:06.689> this<00:01:07.229> could

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
defense this year we can out this could

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.140 
defense this year we can out this could
be<00:01:07.500> inside<00:01:07.860> another<00:01:08.189> base<00:01:08.430> we<00:01:08.640> could<00:01:08.760> have<00:01:08.880> a

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
be inside another base we could have a

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.179 
be inside another base we could have a
ground<00:01:09.450> base<00:01:09.720> here<00:01:10.020> we<00:01:10.470> could<00:01:10.650> build<00:01:10.799> all

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
ground base here we could build all

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.760 
ground base here we could build all
around<00:01:11.610> we<00:01:11.970> can<00:01:12.090> put<00:01:12.270> traps<00:01:12.540> we<00:01:13.320> could<00:01:13.530> maybe

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
around we can put traps we could maybe

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.010 
around we can put traps we could maybe
move<00:01:14.220> this<00:01:14.369> closer<00:01:14.610> to<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:15.030> water<00:01:15.270> if<00:01:15.689> you

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
move this closer to the water if you

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.620 
move this closer to the water if you
wanted<00:01:16.320> to<00:01:16.439> maybe<00:01:16.470> get<00:01:16.950> some<00:01:17.130> fishing<00:01:17.630> because

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
wanted to maybe get some fishing because

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.359 
wanted to maybe get some fishing because
i<00:01:18.689> apparently<00:01:18.750> i<00:01:19.080> think<00:01:19.380> that's<00:01:19.560> going<00:01:20.100> to<00:01:20.189> be

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
i apparently i think that's going to be

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:21.830 
i apparently i think that's going to be
a<00:01:20.400> thing<00:01:20.640> or<00:01:20.790> is<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.180> thing<00:01:21.390> already<00:01:21.570> i

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
a thing or is the thing already i

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.929 
a thing or is the thing already i
haven't<00:01:22.439> tried<00:01:22.590> it<00:01:22.740> I've<00:01:23.070> just<00:01:23.130> heard<00:01:23.490> rumors

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
haven't tried it I've just heard rumors

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.789 
haven't tried it I've just heard rumors
about<00:01:23.970> it<00:01:25.430> anyway<00:01:26.430> they<00:01:26.580> know<00:01:27.119> it's<00:01:27.390> if

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:27.799 
about it anyway they know it's if

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:30.380 
about it anyway they know it's if
possibilities<00:01:28.799> are<00:01:28.920> limitless<00:01:29.250> so<00:01:29.970> going<00:01:30.150> on

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
possibilities are limitless so going on

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.109 
possibilities are limitless so going on
up<00:01:30.570> you're<00:01:31.470> completely<00:01:31.710> safe<00:01:32.280> I<00:01:32.579> think<00:01:32.880> even

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
up you're completely safe I think even

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.210 
up you're completely safe I think even
if<00:01:33.240> future<00:01:33.630> updates<00:01:34.049> when<00:01:34.290> people<00:01:34.710> can<00:01:34.890> smash

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
if future updates when people can smash

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.980 
if future updates when people can smash
your<00:01:35.400> base<00:01:35.610> down<00:01:36.090> you<00:01:36.479> know<00:01:36.570> blow<00:01:36.810> right

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
your base down you know blow right

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.719 
your base down you know blow right
through<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.229> walls<00:01:37.500> I<00:01:37.770> still<00:01:38.460> don't<00:01:38.640> think

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
through the walls I still don't think

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.010 
through the walls I still don't think
they're<00:01:38.970> going<00:01:39.090> to<00:01:39.180> be<00:01:39.270> able<00:01:39.360> to<00:01:39.509> get<00:01:39.630> up<00:01:39.750> here

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
they're going to be able to get up here

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.590 
they're going to be able to get up here
I'm<00:01:40.590> kind<00:01:41.070> of<00:01:41.130> interested<00:01:41.340> interested<00:01:42.000> to<00:01:42.390> see

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
I'm kind of interested interested to see

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.569 
I'm kind of interested interested to see
what<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.049> developers<00:01:43.470> are<00:01:43.560> going<00:01:43.680> to<00:01:43.740> do<00:01:43.920> for

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
what the developers are going to do for

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.280 
what the developers are going to do for
things<00:01:44.759> like<00:01:44.880> this<00:01:45.149> I<00:01:45.329> really<00:01:45.750> hope<00:01:46.110> they

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.289 
over here and i think i might actually
keep<00:02:30.290> building<00:02:30.530> up<00:02:30.680> baby<00:02:31.489> i'll<00:02:31.670> do<00:02:31.790> an<00:02:31.909> updated

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 
to get above the tree line that was that

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:39.970

think we're about halfway there are more
than<00:02:42.799> halfway<00:02:42.950> on<00:02:43.250> some<00:02:43.459> of<00:02:43.549> these<00:02:43.609> trees<00:02:43.879> but

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120
