the smiley graphic on there and that's

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.469 
the smiley graphic on there and that's

of also added Kevlar underneath the

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.060 
of also added Kevlar underneath the
inserts<00:01:27.810> of<00:01:27.990> your<00:01:28.110> bindings<00:01:28.530> on<00:01:28.680> this<00:01:28.829> to

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
inserts of your bindings on this to

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.210 
inserts of your bindings on this to
really<00:01:29.369> prevent<00:01:30.090> blowouts<00:01:30.659> and<00:01:31.130> just<00:01:32.130> to

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
really prevent blowouts and just to

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.120 
really prevent blowouts and just to
dampen<00:01:32.670> any<00:01:32.759> vibrations<00:01:33.540> you<00:01:33.950> also<00:01:34.950> get

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
dampen any vibrations you also get

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.100 
dampen any vibrations you also get
carbon<00:01:35.369> beams<00:01:35.729> which<00:01:36.060> adds<00:01:36.329> a<00:01:36.479> load<00:01:36.659> of<00:01:36.810> snap

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
carbon beams which adds a load of snap

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.440 
carbon beams which adds a load of snap
again<00:01:37.829> it's<00:01:38.490> probably<00:01:38.670> one<00:01:38.970> of<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.119> Poppy's
