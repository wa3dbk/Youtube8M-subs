00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
do that you just jump toward it and you

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:11.120 
do that you just jump toward it and you
span<00:04:08.940> the<00:04:09.060> Crouch<00:04:09.239> button<00:04:09.450> and<00:04:09.950> you<00:04:10.950> just

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130 
span the Crouch button and you just

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:13.430 
span the Crouch button and you just
basically<00:04:12.120> you<00:04:12.480> fall<00:04:12.720> through<00:04:12.750> the<00:04:13.019> left<00:04:13.260> it's

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:41.869 
which is a battle rifle now going top
mid<00:04:40.229> right<00:04:40.440> here<00:04:40.620> probably<00:04:40.919> leaving<00:04:41.280> blue

00:04:41.869 --> 00:04:41.879 
mid right here probably leaving blue

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:45.409 
mid right here probably leaving blue
probably<00:04:42.690> wasn't<00:04:42.930> the<00:04:42.960> best<00:04:43.050> idea<00:04:43.319> I<00:04:44.270> shot<00:04:45.270> the

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:45.419 
probably wasn't the best idea I shot the

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:48.830 
probably wasn't the best idea I shot the
shot<00:04:46.020> gun<00:04:46.199> shot<00:04:46.409> because<00:04:46.590> I<00:04:47.630> thought<00:04:48.630> it<00:04:48.750> was

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
shot gun shot because I thought it was

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.360 
shot gun shot because I thought it was
one<00:04:48.990> shot<00:04:49.229> guy<00:04:49.500> didn't<00:04:49.770> see<00:04:49.889> me<00:04:50.069> because<00:04:50.220> I<00:04:50.280> was

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:50.370 
one shot guy didn't see me because I was

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:52.760 
one shot guy didn't see me because I was
camo<00:04:50.870> so<00:04:51.870> I<00:04:51.900> now<00:04:52.259> what's<00:04:52.440> your<00:04:52.530> long-range

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.770 
camo so I now what's your long-range

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.309 
camo so I now what's your long-range
weapons<00:04:53.250> so<00:04:53.370> I'm<00:04:53.430> pretty<00:04:53.610> much<00:04:53.759> set<00:04:54.199> match<00:04:55.199> to

00:04:55.309 --> 00:04:55.319 
weapons so I'm pretty much set match to

00:04:55.319 --> 00:04:58.100 
weapons so I'm pretty much set match to
stick<00:04:55.560> that<00:04:55.680> guy<00:04:55.889> in<00:04:56.810> accidentally<00:04:57.810> kill<00:04:57.990> my

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.110 
stick that guy in accidentally kill my

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:00.499 
stick that guy in accidentally kill my
teammate<00:04:58.530> I<00:04:58.849> think<00:04:59.849> this<00:04:59.909> is<00:05:00.060> where<00:05:00.180> my<00:05:00.330> game

00:05:00.499 --> 00:05:00.509 
teammate I think this is where my game

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:02.240 
teammate I think this is where my game
starts<00:05:00.840> going<00:05:01.050> a<00:05:01.110> little<00:05:01.259> bit<00:05:01.409> yellow<00:05:02.069> bar

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250 
starts going a little bit yellow bar

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:06.230 
starts going a little bit yellow bar
almost<00:05:04.520> but<00:05:05.520> basically<00:05:05.699> throughout<00:05:06.090> this

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 
almost but basically throughout this

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.670 
almost but basically throughout this
entire<00:05:06.389> game<00:05:06.780> you<00:05:07.050> want<00:05:07.319> to<00:05:07.380> make<00:05:07.500> sure<00:05:07.530> that

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:12.930 
cannot be unpredictable as well the last

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:15.920 
cannot be unpredictable as well the last
thing<00:05:13.139> you<00:05:13.289> want<00:05:13.469> to<00:05:13.500> do<00:05:13.650> is<00:05:13.940> just<00:05:14.940> stay<00:05:15.750> in<00:05:15.840> the

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:22.770 
just basically making sure that they

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:24.860 
just basically making sure that they
can't<00:05:23.190> really<00:05:23.610> predict<00:05:24.000> my<00:05:24.150> movements<00:05:24.690> if<00:05:24.780> you

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:24.870 
can't really predict my movements if you

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:26.930 
can't really predict my movements if you
know<00:05:24.960> what<00:05:25.050> I<00:05:25.080> mean<00:05:25.430> alright<00:05:26.430> so<00:05:26.550> I<00:05:26.610> failed<00:05:26.819> my

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:28.650 
jam right now unfortunately looking for

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:29.959 
jam right now unfortunately looking for
the<00:05:28.740> respawn<00:05:29.039> of<00:05:29.130> the<00:05:29.190> battle<00:05:29.430> rifle<00:05:29.759> and<00:05:29.880> it's
