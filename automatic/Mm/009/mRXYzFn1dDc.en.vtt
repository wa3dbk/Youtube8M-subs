00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
always has you give help defense

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.120 
always has you give help defense
sometimes<00:02:51.870> he<00:02:51.990> tries<00:02:52.110> to<00:02:52.230> give<00:02:52.470> help<00:02:52.680> defense

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
sometimes he tries to give help defense

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.430 
sometimes he tries to give help defense
so<00:02:53.580> he<00:02:53.700> loses<00:02:54.030> position<00:02:54.570> inside<00:02:55.050> if<00:02:55.320> that

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
so he loses position inside if that

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.080 
so he loses position inside if that
makes<00:02:55.650> sense<00:02:55.830> to<00:02:56.040> you<00:02:56.190> and<00:02:56.370> when<00:02:56.730> he<00:02:56.790> gives<00:02:56.940> it

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
makes sense to you and when he gives it

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.520 
makes sense to you and when he gives it
that<00:02:57.120> position<00:02:57.660> he<00:02:58.080> doesn't<00:02:58.380> have<00:02:58.470> the

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
that position he doesn't have the

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.830 
that position he doesn't have the
strength<00:02:58.800> to<00:02:59.130> counter<00:02:59.760> inside<00:03:00.270> so<00:03:00.570> he<00:03:00.690> gets

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
strength to counter inside so he gets

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.540 
strength to counter inside so he gets
beaten<00:03:01.170> sometimes<00:03:01.620> in<00:03:01.830> that<00:03:01.980> in<00:03:02.130> that<00:03:02.220> area

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
beaten sometimes in that in that area

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.370 
beaten sometimes in that in that area
and<00:03:02.820> sometimes<00:03:03.510> it's<00:03:03.630> not<00:03:03.750> really<00:03:03.990> his<00:03:04.140> fault

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
and sometimes it's not really his fault

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.350 
and sometimes it's not really his fault
but<00:03:04.890> I<00:03:04.920> think<00:03:05.130> everybody<00:03:05.610> had<00:03:05.790> to<00:03:05.820> be<00:03:05.970> pleased

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
experience in that and they had pressure

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.810 
experience in that and they had pressure
because<00:03:43.530> the<00:03:43.680> the<00:03:43.920> starters<00:03:44.280> have<00:03:44.400> played<00:03:44.550> so

in the short time he was on the floor in
the<00:03:52.590> first<00:03:52.770> half<00:03:53.010> he<00:03:53.160> only<00:03:53.280> took<00:03:53.430> one<00:03:53.640> shot

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
the first half he only took one shot

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:55.730 
the first half he only took one shot
finally<00:03:54.690> got<00:03:54.840> going<00:03:55.110> in<00:03:55.200> the<00:03:55.290> third<00:03:55.470> quarter

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:55.740 
finally got going in the third quarter

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110 
ended up with 17 points in the game but

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:00.920 
ended up with 17 points in the game but
it<00:03:58.830> was<00:03:58.980> kind<00:03:59.730> of<00:03:59.790> hot<00:04:00.030> and<00:04:00.210> cold<00:04:00.300> for<00:04:00.900> him

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
it was kind of hot and cold for him

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.300 
it was kind of hot and cold for him
because<00:04:01.170> he<00:04:01.410> wouldn't<00:04:01.590> shoot<00:04:01.770> it<00:04:01.890> all<00:04:02.040> and

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
because he wouldn't shoot it all and

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.130 
because he wouldn't shoot it all and
then<00:04:02.640> in<00:04:02.730> the<00:04:02.790> third<00:04:02.820> quarter<00:04:03.270> where<00:04:03.810> I<00:04:03.870> think

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.140 
then in the third quarter where I think

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:05.480 
then in the third quarter where I think
he<00:04:04.200> scored<00:04:04.440> maybe<00:04:04.650> somewhere<00:04:04.950> around<00:04:05.010> 14

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:05.490 
he scored maybe somewhere around 14

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:07.910 
he scored maybe somewhere around 14
points<00:04:05.880> he<00:04:06.420> really<00:04:07.110> tried<00:04:07.290> to<00:04:07.380> take<00:04:07.560> over<00:04:07.680> the

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
points he really tried to take over the

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.650 
points he really tried to take over the
game<00:04:08.100> but<00:04:08.850> he'd<00:04:08.940> never<00:04:08.970> really<00:04:09.300> seemed<00:04:09.540> in

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
game but he'd never really seemed in
