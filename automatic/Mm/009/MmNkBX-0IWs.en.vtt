I<00:00:12.599> think<00:00:13.380> his<00:00:13.530> video<00:00:13.920> was<00:00:14.250> a<00:00:14.280> little<00:00:14.370> bit

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
I think his video was a little bit

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.580 
I think his video was a little bit
incomplete<00:00:14.910> and<00:00:15.480> so<00:00:15.719> maybe<00:00:16.049> a<00:00:16.170> little<00:00:16.320> bit

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590

when<00:02:13.530> DJ<00:02:14.220> is<00:02:14.280> in<00:02:14.489> pause<00:02:14.730> mode<00:02:15.030> both<00:02:15.510> the<00:02:15.959> play

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
when DJ is in pause mode both the play

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.720 
when DJ is in pause mode both the play
button<00:02:17.069> and<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:17.659> Cubans<00:02:18.659> are<00:02:18.750> blinking<00:02:19.049> and

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
button and the Cubans are blinking and

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.390 
button and the Cubans are blinking and
the<00:02:20.730> CDJ<00:02:21.180> behaves<00:02:21.599> exactly<00:02:21.840> like<00:02:22.290> a<00:02:22.500> vinyl

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
the CDJ behaves exactly like a vinyl

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.570 
the CDJ behaves exactly like a vinyl
turntable<00:02:24.530> that<00:02:25.530> is<00:02:25.769> stopped

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
turntable that is stopped

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.020 
turntable that is stopped
so<00:02:27.150> essentially<00:02:28.019> you<00:02:28.200> can<00:02:28.349> move<00:02:28.790> the<00:02:29.790> platter

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
so essentially you can move the platter

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.660 
so essentially you can move the platter
anywhere<00:02:30.660> and<00:02:30.870> the<00:02:31.410> record<00:02:32.069> will<00:02:32.220> stay<00:02:32.519> in

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
anywhere and the record will stay in

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.930 
anywhere and the record will stay in
that<00:02:32.700> place<00:02:32.970> so<00:02:33.330> should<00:02:34.049> be<00:02:34.200> more<00:02:34.560> as<00:02:34.890> you<00:02:35.790> can

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
that place so should be more as you can

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:45.850 
that place so should be more as you can
see<00:02:36.180> it<00:02:36.299> stays<00:02:36.540> where<00:02:37.140> I<00:02:37.170> moved<00:02:37.709> it<00:02:37.890> to

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.250 

stays<00:02:46.860> where<00:02:47.040> it<00:02:47.129> set<00:02:47.599> the<00:02:48.599> next<00:02:48.780> thing<00:02:49.019> I<00:02:49.110> like

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
stays where it set the next thing I like

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.140 
stays where it set the next thing I like
to<00:02:49.319> show<00:02:49.650> you<00:02:49.709> is<00:02:50.220> a<00:02:50.790> quick<00:02:51.629> return<00:02:52.049> feature<00:02:53.150> so

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
mode well essentially the same thing

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.289

except<00:03:52.950> you're<00:03:53.220> already<00:03:53.370> playing<00:03:53.880> so<00:03:54.209> it

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:54.299 
except you're already playing so it

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:55.610 
except you're already playing so it
doesn't<00:03:54.599> have<00:03:54.690> to<00:03:54.810> start<00:03:55.109> playing

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
doesn't have to start playing

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.009 
doesn't have to start playing

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
see each time I touch the planner just

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.800

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:08.810 
back right back to the cue point and

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:13.580 
back right back to the cue point and
finally<00:04:09.810> um<00:04:10.790> when<00:04:11.790> the<00:04:12.209> owners<00:04:12.510> in<00:04:12.780> pause<00:04:13.169> mode

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
finally um when the owners in pause mode

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.060 
finally um when the owners in pause mode
again<00:04:14.519> when<00:04:14.760> both<00:04:15.030> buttons<00:04:15.449> are<00:04:15.750> blinking

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
again when both buttons are blinking

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.879 
again when both buttons are blinking
quick<00:04:17.070> return<00:04:17.400> has<00:04:17.669> absolutely<00:04:18.269> no<00:04:18.690> effect

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:18.889 
quick return has absolutely no effect

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:21.259 
quick return has absolutely no effect

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:21.269 
essentially it's the same as if quick

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:23.750 
essentially it's the same as if quick
return<00:04:21.539> is<00:04:21.690> off<00:04:21.840> and<00:04:22.079> you<00:04:22.159> can<00:04:23.159> simply<00:04:23.580> move

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
return is off and you can simply move

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.880 
return is off and you can simply move
the<00:04:23.909> record<00:04:24.270> to<00:04:24.659> where<00:04:24.780> you<00:04:24.900> want<00:04:25.110> it<00:04:25.229> and<00:04:25.500> it

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:25.890 
the record to where you want it and it

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:27.070 
the record to where you want it and it
will<00:04:25.950> just<00:04:26.039> stay<00:04:26.340> there<00:04:26.520> so

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
will just stay there so

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:39.520 
will just stay there so
you're<00:04:36.310> basically<00:04:37.360> the<00:04:38.360> same<00:04:38.569> as<00:04:38.810> without

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:39.530 
you're basically the same as without

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:42.249 
you're basically the same as without
quick<00:04:39.889> return<00:04:40.180> so<00:04:41.180> that<00:04:41.210> was<00:04:41.539> that's<00:04:41.840> about<00:04:42.080> it

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:42.259 
quick return so that was that's about it

00:04:42.259 --> 00:04:44.189 
quick return so that was that's about it
if<00:04:42.439> you<00:04:42.560> have<00:04:42.710> any<00:04:42.740> questions<00:04:43.580> let<00:04:43.789> me<00:04:43.849> know
