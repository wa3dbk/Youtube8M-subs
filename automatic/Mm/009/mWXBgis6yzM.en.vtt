00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:07.610 

so<00:00:05.879> for<00:00:06.120> this<00:00:06.240> kind<00:00:06.480> of<00:00:06.629> test<00:00:06.899> and<00:00:07.230> review<00:00:07.560> I

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
so for this kind of test and review I

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:08.960 
so for this kind of test and review I
wanted<00:00:08.099> to<00:00:08.189> do<00:00:08.370> something<00:00:08.730> a<00:00:08.820> little

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
wanted to do something a little

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.940 
wanted to do something a little
different<00:00:09.599> so<00:00:10.080> I<00:00:10.110> run<00:00:10.440> through<00:00:10.620> the<00:00:10.710> main

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
different so I run through the main

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.749 
different so I run through the main
three<00:00:11.429> modes<00:00:11.730> of<00:00:11.969> this<00:00:12.120> amplifier<00:00:12.840> and<00:00:13.309> I<00:00:14.309> play

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
three modes of this amplifier and I play

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.450 
three modes of this amplifier and I play
it<00:00:14.820> with<00:00:14.969> six<00:00:15.690> different<00:00:16.080> guitars<00:00:16.440> and<00:00:17.190> I

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
it with six different guitars and I

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.490 
it with six different guitars and I
don't<00:00:17.640> change<00:00:17.970> any<00:00:18.330> of<00:00:18.449> the<00:00:18.779> settings<00:00:18.810> on<00:00:19.350> the

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
don't change any of the settings on the

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.320 
don't change any of the settings on the
amplifier<00:00:19.920> at<00:00:20.279> all<00:00:20.430> so<00:00:20.609> you<00:00:20.699> can<00:00:20.850> kind<00:00:21.060> of<00:00:21.180> hear

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
amplifier at all so you can kind of hear

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.120 
amplifier at all so you can kind of hear
the<00:00:21.359> difference<00:00:21.840> so<00:00:22.020> if<00:00:22.289> you<00:00:22.500> have<00:00:22.890> one<00:00:23.100> of

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
the difference so if you have one of

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.980 
the difference so if you have one of
these<00:00:23.279> guitars<00:00:23.789> or<00:00:24.150> something<00:00:24.480> similar<00:00:24.960> you

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
these guitars or something similar you

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.290 
these guitars or something similar you
kind<00:00:25.350> of<00:00:25.410> know<00:00:25.560> what<00:00:25.740> to<00:00:25.769> expect<00:00:25.949> the<00:00:26.910> signal

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
kind of know what to expect the signal

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.720 
kind of know what to expect the signal
chain<00:00:27.539> is<00:00:27.750> just<00:00:27.930> going<00:00:28.260> out<00:00:28.560> of<00:00:28.590> this

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
chain is just going out of this

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.569 
chain is just going out of this

00:05:08.439 --> 00:05:08.449 
amp is it's it's mean you plug it in it

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:12.369 
amp is it's it's mean you plug it in it
sounds<00:05:09.050> really<00:05:09.319> great<00:05:10.269> it's<00:05:11.269> definitely<00:05:11.989> very

00:05:12.369 --> 00:05:12.379 
sounds really great it's definitely very

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:15.519 
sounds really great it's definitely very
crunchy<00:05:12.919> so<00:05:13.849> if<00:05:13.879> you<00:05:14.509> don't<00:05:14.749> really<00:05:14.929> like<00:05:15.259> the

00:05:15.519 --> 00:05:15.529 
crunchy so if you don't really like the

00:05:15.529 --> 00:05:18.129 
crunchy so if you don't really like the
sound<00:05:15.709> of<00:05:15.889> kt88<00:05:16.489> or<00:05:16.999> the<00:05:17.119> way<00:05:17.239> that<00:05:17.389> those<00:05:17.629> play

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:18.139 
sound of kt88 or the way that those play

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:20.139 
sound of kt88 or the way that those play
then<00:05:18.469> I<00:05:18.619> would<00:05:18.800> shy<00:05:19.039> away<00:05:19.069> from<00:05:19.339> this<00:05:19.639> amp

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:20.149 
then I would shy away from this amp

00:05:20.149 --> 00:05:24.339 
then I would shy away from this amp
it's<00:05:20.479> got<00:05:20.959> a<00:05:20.989> very<00:05:21.349> mid<00:05:21.800> scooped<00:05:22.839> sound<00:05:23.839> to<00:05:24.199> it

00:05:24.339 --> 00:05:24.349 
it's got a very mid scooped sound to it

00:05:24.349 --> 00:05:26.979 
it's got a very mid scooped sound to it
right<00:05:24.589> when<00:05:24.800> you<00:05:24.919> plug<00:05:25.189> it<00:05:25.369> in<00:05:25.599> which<00:05:26.599> is<00:05:26.779> good

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:26.989 
right when you plug it in which is good

00:05:26.989 --> 00:05:29.290 
right when you plug it in which is good
I<00:05:27.289> mean<00:05:27.559> for<00:05:27.769> mixing<00:05:28.159> and<00:05:28.369> stuff<00:05:28.639> it's<00:05:28.879> it's<00:05:29.089> in

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:29.300 
I mean for mixing and stuff it's it's in

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:31.629 
I mean for mixing and stuff it's it's in
a<00:05:29.389> mix<00:05:29.629> really<00:05:30.050> well<00:05:30.319> without<00:05:30.679> having<00:05:31.069> really

00:05:31.629 --> 00:05:31.639 
a mix really well without having really

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:35.019 
a mix really well without having really
to<00:05:31.759> do<00:05:31.939> much<00:05:32.149> to<00:05:32.479> it<00:05:33.009> the<00:05:34.009> clean<00:05:34.339> channel<00:05:34.849> is

00:05:35.019 --> 00:05:35.029 
to do much to it the clean channel is

00:05:35.029 --> 00:05:37.089 
to do much to it the clean channel is
really<00:05:35.509> good<00:05:35.749> on<00:05:35.779> this<00:05:36.080> and<00:05:36.409> you<00:05:36.679> can<00:05:36.830> kind<00:05:37.009> of

00:05:37.089 --> 00:05:37.099 
really good on this and you can kind of

00:05:37.099 --> 00:05:41.079 
really good on this and you can kind of
dial<00:05:37.429> in<00:05:39.039> pretty<00:05:40.039> much<00:05:40.099> any<00:05:40.519> sound<00:05:40.879> you're

00:05:41.079 --> 00:05:41.089 
dial in pretty much any sound you're

00:05:41.089 --> 00:05:43.839 
dial in pretty much any sound you're
looking<00:05:41.119> for<00:05:41.629> except<00:05:42.110> it<00:05:42.289> it's<00:05:42.589> if<00:05:42.830> you<00:05:43.639> don't

00:05:43.839 --> 00:05:43.849 
looking for except it it's if you don't

00:05:43.849 --> 00:05:46.389 
looking for except it it's if you don't
like<00:05:44.179> too<00:05:45.110> much<00:05:45.229> crunch<00:05:45.679> they're<00:05:46.009> not<00:05:46.189> you

00:05:46.389 --> 00:05:46.399 
like too much crunch they're not you

00:05:46.399 --> 00:05:48.040 
like too much crunch they're not you
know<00:05:46.519> it<00:05:46.759> can<00:05:46.939> get<00:05:47.089> out<00:05:47.209> of<00:05:47.269> control<00:05:47.659> pretty

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:48.050 
know it can get out of control pretty

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:50.649 
know it can get out of control pretty
quick<00:05:48.439> if<00:05:48.649> you're<00:05:48.800> not<00:05:48.979> careful<00:05:49.309> the<00:05:50.209> gain

00:05:50.649 --> 00:05:50.659 
quick if you're not careful the gain

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:52.509 
quick if you're not careful the gain
staging<00:05:51.259> is<00:05:51.409> really<00:05:51.740> cool<00:05:51.979> on<00:05:52.129> this<00:05:52.279> app<00:05:52.490> that

00:05:52.509 --> 00:05:52.519 
staging is really cool on this app that

00:05:52.519 --> 00:05:55.989 
staging is really cool on this app that
controls<00:05:53.889> can<00:05:54.889> really<00:05:55.159> help<00:05:55.309> dial<00:05:55.639> in<00:05:55.879> the

00:05:55.989 --> 00:05:55.999 
controls can really help dial in the

00:05:55.999 --> 00:05:59.499 
controls can really help dial in the
lower<00:05:56.269> tuned<00:05:56.749> guitars<00:05:57.259> and<00:05:57.709> things<00:05:58.119> it<00:05:59.119> stays

00:05:59.499 --> 00:05:59.509 
lower tuned guitars and things it stays

00:05:59.509 --> 00:06:01.449 
lower tuned guitars and things it stays
really<00:05:59.719> tight<00:06:00.110> it<00:06:00.379> also<00:06:00.589> sounds<00:06:01.159> even<00:06:01.429> better

00:06:01.449 --> 00:06:01.459 
really tight it also sounds even better

00:06:01.459 --> 00:06:03.369 
really tight it also sounds even better
with<00:06:01.909> an<00:06:02.059> overdrive<00:06:02.509> in<00:06:02.779> front<00:06:02.990> of<00:06:03.079> it<00:06:03.169> like<00:06:03.319> a

00:06:03.369 --> 00:06:03.379 
with an overdrive in front of it like a

00:06:03.379 --> 00:06:06.639 
with an overdrive in front of it like a

00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:06.649 
pro tones Misha Mansoor overdrive just

00:06:06.649 --> 00:06:08.859 
pro tones Misha Mansoor overdrive just
really<00:06:07.099> tightens<00:06:07.610> up<00:06:07.789> the<00:06:08.029> low<00:06:08.360> end<00:06:08.629> and<00:06:08.779> the

00:06:08.859 --> 00:06:08.869 
really tightens up the low end and the

00:06:08.869 --> 00:06:11.439 
really tightens up the low end and the
kill<00:06:09.559> mode<00:06:09.800> is<00:06:09.979> just<00:06:10.189> really<00:06:10.669> awesome<00:06:10.699> and

00:06:11.439 --> 00:06:11.449 
kill mode is just really awesome and

00:06:11.449 --> 00:06:14.819 
kill mode is just really awesome and
it's<00:06:11.809> really<00:06:12.499> loud<00:06:12.740> it's<00:06:13.099> an<00:06:13.309> extremely<00:06:14.179> loud
