00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.550
 but the problem is that achieving that dream reaches such a position 

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:09.950
 is increasingly far from millions of children across Brazil. 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:13.690
 children who are in school but did not get a good income 

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:18.109
 a survey of 1,600 students from public and private networks 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:22.339
 revealed that more than half of the students leave the third grade of education 

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:23.710
 fundamental 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:26.829
 without knowing what he should math 

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:30.380
 to see his portrait of a country that is going to have a lot of difficulty growing up 

00:00:30.379 --> 00:00:31.970
 in the future 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.070
 bernanke costs mosquito repeat without education 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.650
 there is no salvation 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:42.540
 she this research was done with the long name Brazilian evaluation of the end 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.040
 of the literacy cycle 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.900
 is a test that was applied this year to those who conclude the 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:49.649
 be a year 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.520
 of the fundamental an evaluation made as Mars says with six thousand students 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.409
 in all regions of the country 

00:00:56.409 --> 00:01:00.489
 in 250 private and public schools 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:03.900
 had a result well above public schools 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.200
 and in total 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:11.630
 found that 44% of students did not learn to read 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:17.450
 and 57 percent do not know how to do basic arithmetic operations like 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.970
 somare decreased I ask which schools 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.820
 where the student arrives at the end of the third year 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.180
 and can not read 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.560
 and can not add and decrease 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.570
 It will be school in which this happens of year. 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.700
 being healthy challenge of a test 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.840
 without any obligation to study 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.120
 It's day to teach 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.080
 I know that teachers and students are evaluated 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.640
 without an apprenticeship 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.180
 that life ahead will test you without a job in the profession 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.880
 It's hard to believe that Brazil is the country of the future. 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.040
 if it is not based on the southern part, fight education and see 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.800
 a boy from South Korea 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.350
 he studies 12 hours a day between pio lobato school 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.600
 and here he reports 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.940
 much less would they refuse to see these schoolchildren more than 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.280
 are illiterate and do not understand what they read 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.200
 to write adopt difficulties norms in mathematics 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.450
 but the public school also has good examples in the same key 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.060
 season we show 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.949
 we showed yesterday an example that Brazil exists 

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:27.509
 piles of good schools and good school is one that has good teachers here in 

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:31.549
 brasilia there is a public school and that students law 

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:36.729
 and he even learns to speak they know how to construct phrases 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.950
 they communicate they learn to think 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.139
 to reason to create 

00:02:43.139 --> 00:02:46.109
 You saw pictures of the playtime. 

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:50.809
 at recess time they law then took the books in hand home to put in 

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:51.499
 little bag 

00:02:51.499 --> 00:02:52.789
 take it home 

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:58.770
 where they came from corrupted tells of books imagine environments characters 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:59.599
 plots 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:01.190
 the good travels 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:02.249
 Those 

00:03:02.249 --> 00:03:03.849
 will have future 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:05.429
 now I ask 

00:03:05.429 --> 00:03:07.509
 with one of the boys 

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:09.539
 I could not read 

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:11.079
 do not add 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:12.579
 nor decrease 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:15.439
 is it that a crime was not committed and said 

00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:18.619
 future disease 

00:03:18.619 --> 00:03:20.479
 It's good to think about choosing
