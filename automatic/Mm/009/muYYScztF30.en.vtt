00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.369
 very good and physical I am every we are in 

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:17.539
 a new video of the dot out and today you 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:18.949
 I come to talk about one of the 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:21.259
 combinations that I like the most and 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:23.869
 weapons logically is to begin with because 

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:26.329
 they are weapons that are not modified are 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:28.340
 simply the the weapon that comes to you and 

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:30.589
 I wanted to talk about this combination for 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.239
 one side we have here the missile weapon 

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:33.980
 let's try to see if we find 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:35.480
 some enemy that we are some game 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.330
 to see look around we have seen one 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.430
 but we're far to see if we give it 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:42.559
 air we have given not crashed against the 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:45.170
 good column as you see this weapon of 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:46.879
 missiles and second led the lightning 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.930
 that the lightning to see if we find a 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:50.000
 someone because they seem to be 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.430
 hidden in it right now is 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.990
 they have all hidden to see if we find 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:59.110
 Here I show this weapon d 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:01.120
 missile and ray forgiveness that of 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:04.510
 missile is the other is the first and as 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:06.310
 secondary I have this to see here 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:09.070
 we've seen on the radar that there are people 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:11.020
 then it has to be by already I know what 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.390
 they have charged look at it there is worth of 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.980
 rays that goes well worth less than the 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.560
 of missiles but now I comment because 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:19.240
 I like it worth one side is of 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.250
 missiles because I like to imagine that 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.450
 You are now watching a video in which 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.800
 in the test mode in the mode 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.590
 training test mode 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:29.950
 weapons in which I teach you a combo and the 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:32.260
 combo consists of wheels on the ground 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.640
 and just when it's over, it's good 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:36.580
 when it finishes rolling on the ground and 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.800
 you jump the jump is greater than I like about 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.450
 that combo and this weapon so that this 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:44.050
 gun only has one shot that shot 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:48.400
 it takes away a lot of value, it takes away a lot of life 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:50.530
 but well you do not end with the health of the 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:53.080
 enemy not from a single shot do you have to 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.360
 give it very well and good and you have to 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:58.570
 missing a little life then what is 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.010
 what's cool then when you shoot and 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.840
 you have to recharge how long it takes 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:04.120
 reload you can do that as for 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:07.420
 dodge and if as you are seeing in the 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:09.310
 video that combo is the right time 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.050
 more or less than it takes to recharge the 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.660
 arm then what would you do as you are 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.950
 watching is shooting to do the combo and in 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.870
 the one you're doing the recharge combo and 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.360
 you shoot again you do the 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.220
 combo and you shoot again and so 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.350
 continuously it is not some weapons that more 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.840
 I like it because it can be done very well 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:27.730
 with the combo and good and high school 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.270
 Well now we're here in the 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.520
 what video 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.320
 What I like about this weapon is that it is 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.480
 very fast firing because it looks like 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.250
 You see, we shoot there, we change quickly to 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.200
 Well that is because he was already dead 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.000
 we killed a shot but look at 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.710
 see if we see any enemy that have 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.200
 to be around here some enemy with 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:47.220
 all the health to see there are two shots I do not know 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.380
 If you are going to give me 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.030
 On the one hand, we shoot, we shoot, and 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.860
 we take life and we give running to the laser 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.540
 I see there as I have charged that 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.010
 combination I really like we do 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.130
 how I lack a lot of health but what 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.510
 we make pum pum we shoot and shoot 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.060
 with the second one and we do not charge it for that 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.160
 I like the second so much because I 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.400
 they are shooting ok I have very little 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:10.320
 life I think that around here there was one of 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:13.410
 these bullets have to be here 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:14.550
 of light of life sorry good but there was 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.470
 seen more or less because I like the 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:18.510
 secondary not simply because now 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.930
 Look, llama, they've already killed me and I have more 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.030
 lifetime 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:24.879
 the reappearance time out there is worth 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:26.920
 perfect then we go to the area where 

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:28.840
 will be the enemies and I'll return it to 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.719
 show that you have already seen it a lot 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.969
 we just shoot we change gun 

00:03:31.719 --> 00:03:35.920
 and we've taken life and we're going there with 

00:03:33.969 --> 00:03:37.900
 the laser and with the salt we load it 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.750
 perfect is a perfect combination already 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.250
 you know shoot once and how it takes 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.349
 a lot to load because you simply have 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.569
 we change gun look there we give 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:48.189
 we change gun and we shoot and we 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:50.139
 we load, I think it's a combination 

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:51.970
 perfect to start if you do not know much 

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:53.919
 play I think this combination is going 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:56.139
 to come very well is under my point 

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:57.700
 You already know and well the missile weapon 

00:03:56.139 --> 00:03:59.709
 as main you know by the combo no 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:01.569
 because when you perform that combo it gives you the 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:03.250
 enough and necessary time to 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:06.790
 reload and re-shoot to do the 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:08.950
 combo shoot and do the combo 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:11.290
 recharge you shoot as recharges 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:13.329
 you shoot continuously so I think 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:16.180
 which is a very good combination under my 

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:17.349
 point of view for this type of games 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.060
 and well nothing I hope you are liking 

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:20.859
 the lot out videos 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.599
 I hope that you are doing well if 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:24.190
 you have started to play the game to me the 

00:04:22.599 --> 00:04:25.510
 I really love super fun in 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.430
 as for animations as good 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:29.009
 playability 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:31.169
 and nothing about cellay that you already know what 

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:33.750
 I will thank you a lot and I wait for you in 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:35.400
 the next video until soon 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:39.979
 and there we load it with the combo 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.979
 perfect good number charged me
