we<00:00:08.189> surgical<00:00:08.849> said<00:00:09.240> at<00:00:09.660> first<00:00:09.929> I<00:00:10.170> just<00:00:10.200> helped

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
we surgical said at first I just helped

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.980 
we surgical said at first I just helped
out<00:00:10.860> then<00:00:11.759> I<00:00:11.790> started<00:00:12.269> making<00:00:12.420> sapphire

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
out then I started making sapphire

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:20.540 
out then I started making sapphire
crystals<00:00:13.559> a<00:00:17.810> feed<00:00:18.810> we<00:00:19.770> then<00:00:20.010> moved<00:00:20.310> into

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
crystals a feed we then moved into

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.160 
crystals a feed we then moved into
making<00:00:20.939> replacement<00:00:21.779> mineral<00:00:22.170> crystals<00:00:22.699> and

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:24.170 
making replacement mineral crystals and

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:26.599 
making replacement mineral crystals and
because<00:00:25.170> I<00:00:25.199> found<00:00:25.500> this<00:00:25.650> more<00:00:25.890> interesting

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
because I found this more interesting

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:33.950 
because I found this more interesting
it<00:00:27.449> gradually<00:00:27.840> became<00:00:28.289> my<00:00:28.500> speciality<00:00:32.540> I<00:00:33.540> make

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
it gradually became my speciality I make

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.110 
it gradually became my speciality I make
the<00:00:34.079> crystal<00:00:34.290> entirely<00:00:34.950> by<00:00:35.219> hand<00:00:35.489> from<00:00:35.760> start

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.799 
the crystal entirely by hand from start
to<00:00:36.239> finish<00:00:36.270> I<00:00:37.760> choose<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:39.000> appropriate<00:00:39.239> form

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
to finish I choose the appropriate form

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:45.260 
to finish I choose the appropriate form
for<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.140> case<00:00:40.350> I<00:00:42.980> bend<00:00:43.980> this<00:00:44.160> form<00:00:44.460> to<00:00:44.730> exactly

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
for the case I bend this form to exactly

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:51.709 
for the case I bend this form to exactly
match<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.600> curve<00:00:46.050> of<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.410> case<00:00:49.700> next<00:00:50.700> I<00:00:51.120> give

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
match the curve of the case next I give

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.049 
match the curve of the case next I give
the<00:00:51.870> preliminary<00:00:52.469> cut<00:00:52.860> and<00:00:53.129> shape<00:00:53.460> to<00:00:53.789> a<00:00:53.820> piece

the preliminary cut and shape to a piece

00:00:54.059 --> 00:01:19.000 
the preliminary cut and shape to a piece
of<00:00:54.239> glass<00:00:54.710> which<00:00:55.710> I<00:00:55.890> then<00:00:56.100> have<00:00:56.309> to<00:00:56.340> bend

you<00:01:37.700> have<00:01:37.850> to<00:01:37.940> keep<00:01:38.120> the<00:01:38.210> burner<00:01:38.420> moving<00:01:39.080> and

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
you have to keep the burner moving and

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:47.680 
you have to keep the burner moving and
play<00:01:39.650> with<00:01:39.890> the<00:01:39.980> flame

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:47.690

your<00:01:48.440> big<00:01:48.590> solution<00:01:49.070> I'd<00:01:49.130> say<00:01:49.430> the<00:01:49.610> burner<00:01:49.820> is

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:50.120 
your big solution I'd say the burner is

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:55.150 
your big solution I'd say the burner is
the<00:01:50.270> most<00:01:50.480> important<00:01:51.050> stage<00:01:53.320> it<00:01:54.320> has<00:01:54.350> to<00:01:54.830> be<00:01:54.950> by

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:55.160 
the most important stage it has to be by

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.950
