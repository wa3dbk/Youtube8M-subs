00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 hello girls this is going to be a day of a 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.700
 little more informal than usual and it's 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.710
 It's too late but I did not want 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.360
 to lie down without making this video that is a 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.460
 set of accumulated purchases that 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.380
 I had promised on my twitter is here 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.269
 with the 9000 people but then all is 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.100
 like a good girlfriend chat 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.230
 then we will start because they are 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.330
 quite complicated then what 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.810
 first let's start with purchases by 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.390
 Internet 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.859
 then the inside days inside have me 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.490
 arrived several little things the first thing is 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.100
 this pants 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:31.779
 what is a pants that is very loose and 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:34.090
 as you can see it has a detail here 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:35.440
 like pressed in the front and 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.540
 in the back is elastic 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.730
 then he has many sizes left and it is 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:42.670
 totally black is like a fabric 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:44.320
 cotton and is Larguita me those pants 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.210
 they love it because they are casual they are very 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.920
 comfortable for my ills are very elegant 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.019
 then you can combine with different 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.120
 blouses I know they will be super nice 

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:54.160
 for college or work 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.470
 they also remain super super well good what 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.910
 next and then jeans and that has 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:00.370
 been that it is very beautiful I saw it in the 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:02.920
 model and it was perfect but me 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:05.110
 the truth gives us so much that they never 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.969
 We gave the bags of 15 that we 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:11.630
 they come well they are very rich 

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:11.630
 as a close 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.159
 is a black dress looks a lot like 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:21.530
 one that I use almost in all the videos 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:24.260
 as you can see it has a very very low neckline 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.270
 Very low, not too low, but 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:28.520
 if it's quite low and it's like in a 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.470
 velvet is a fabric without black super 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.090
 softly the truth is that I loved it in 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.009
 the top part of mesh and it's 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.350
 miniskirt then it's super short and it's 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:38.479
 Perfect for the blonde to dance and 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.340
 disco pending it to the ly and see that 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:42.830
 a little bit big then I think that I 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.659
 touch when you put him but the rest is super 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:47.030
 pretty the next thing we 're going to 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:48.890
 see I'm super excited and use 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.539
 on a trip that I'm going to do and 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.700
 I will probably be on the trip 

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:55.399
 when I upload this video then I will 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.649
 show them at once are these shorts 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:59.420
 who has already seen them as in tumblr in 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:01.700
 pinter is good in all parts 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.600
 where there are photos as outfits and everything 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:07.640
 this then are these shorts that are 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:10.310
 of high shooting or reaching higher than 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.320
 navel and they are as well as ripped as 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.450
 damaged do not imagine as weapons of 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.190
 well they make super nice the only thing is that 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.260
 they are a little short of the back 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.880
 like in the buttocks but neither is that 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.230
 you do the buttocks it's just that they're 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.720
 well cut 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.640
 I asked for another jacket these jackets already 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.680
 they had it with the doorway yellow 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.629
 seen in another video but this time the 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.640
 I ordered in white color I loved it as 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:34.099
 Also I was super good quality 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.140
 it's very gray and it looks a lot like 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:38.540
 Some that were selling in Sara a while ago 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:41.660
 and in sara of jackets do not go below 100 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.489
 dollars then I was pressed very 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.500
 good option on the page without salt is 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:47.480
 much more economical and traction the 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.519
 zippers on the sleeves 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.460
 I still zip all around 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:54.230
 let 's say there 's the back 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:56.420
 and how can you account for having a 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.370
 golden zipper and contrasting super 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.840
 nice with the white color plus me 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.750
 it seems that white us shares as more 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.250
 polished more elegant more chic also 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.200
 go through a store called tennis 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.900
 which is from here in Colombia and in these 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.060
 zones acronyms tennis and is a store of 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.560
 very nice and youthful clothes if you are 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.300
 they really know what the style of 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.520
 tennis and if they are not Colombian I think that 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:18.290
 there is also tennis in some countries of the 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:20.210
 I'm not sure which one is then 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.920
 I do not usually buy clothes there because the 

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:23.360
 forms are usually like small but 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.190
 then a blouse that I liked 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.960
 very much and it appeared that it was going to be 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.090
 very pretty with the shorts that I just finished 

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:31.460
 to show the blouse this is like a 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:35.110
 shirt and has a tiger there stamped 

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:37.040
 and that is how to cut the sides 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:40.129
 something like that 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:42.230
 and so the gray color goes and then I 

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:43.640
 it seemed that combined with the shorts and 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:45.859
 soon with a necklace like this super 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:47.540
 shocking I also went through marketing 

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:49.099
 because I needed a proofreader because it 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:51.230
 I finished maybelline and wanted to try 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:54.049
 one of mac then the makeup artist that 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:55.849
 sell the mac I suggested a proofreader 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:57.739
 the new light mineral line that 

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:59.659
 I just voted 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:03.050
 and that is from minar life council erc 

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:04.960
 then it comes in this black box 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:06.730
 Y 

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:09.010
 the difference to the other proofreaders is 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:13.500
 that has here as the capita as well 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.500
 like more chubby and the applicator 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.509
 it's like brush type my color is in 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.489
 that 30 is the color that covers me very 

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:22.590
 well under the eyes, if you go 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:24.330
 to buy more than tell you what color is 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.800
 the right he attracted me because she 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.509
 he said he was much gentler with the 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.220
 skin because it has some minerals that 

00:04:27.509 --> 00:04:31.020
 makes it softer and like that 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.910
 hydrate much more the area below the 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.620
 eyes here I have to make advance of 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:37.080
 birthday celebrates on Sunday 10 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:38.759
 November and he flies me he came to visit me and 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.380
 while vergara ahead had 

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:42.300
 fascinated by the sweet smells for 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:44.070
 perfumes and that perfume has been one of 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:45.990

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:48.150

 Christmas this perfume is the fantasy of

 Britney Spears and it's a very sweet smell and 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:56.039
 as very enveloping so I would describe it 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:58.320
 I then also have packaging 

00:04:56.039 --> 00:05:00.060
 superbonito comes this way the box and I 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.710
 I just realized that the lid is not 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.630
 I do not know what happened to the cover may be 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:05.190
 for it was here but it was not there but 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:06.930

 embedded inside the packaging is super 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:18.930
 nice and here they bring such a detail 

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:20.850
 as pink as with ties good I do not know 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:23.009

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:31.770

 This store also gives me a lot of pride 

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:13.639
 because it is Colombian and makes deliveries 

00:06:11.789 --> 00:06:15.539

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:38.090
 soft 

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:39.890
 very casual as you can see this shirt 

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:41.900
 brings two colors in the front 

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:44.510

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:46.640

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:49.370
 these two fabrics come together as 

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:51.200
 a tissue that is beautiful and the 

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:52.760
 detail of this blouse is the part of 

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:54.830
 back in the back of a 

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:57.290
 opening that makes it much more 

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:58.970
 fluid much more loose the light and that no 

00:06:57.290 --> 00:07:01.370

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:03.440
