and if you get this on your lips your
lips<00:01:35.810> will<00:01:36.140> probably<00:01:36.470> chop<00:01:36.710> for<00:01:37.010> about<00:01:37.430> a<00:01:37.850> week

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:38.510 
lips will probably chop for about a week

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.070 
lips will probably chop for about a week
I<00:01:39.280> made<00:01:40.280> the<00:01:40.370> mistake<00:01:40.400> when<00:01:41.000> I<00:01:41.030> first<00:01:41.330> first

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.080 
I made the mistake when I first first

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.800 
I made the mistake when I first first
drank<00:01:42.380> it<00:01:42.560> got<00:01:42.770> on<00:01:42.950> my<00:01:42.979> lips<00:01:43.540> I've<00:01:44.540> made<00:01:44.750> my

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
drank it got on my lips I've made my

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.980 
drank it got on my lips I've made my
lips<00:01:45.110> chapped<00:01:45.440> for<00:01:45.710> about<00:01:45.920> a<00:01:45.950> week<00:01:46.159> so<00:01:46.840> pick<00:01:47.840> up

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
lips chapped for about a week so pick up

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:54.070 
lips chapped for about a week so pick up
that<00:01:50.740> basically<00:01:51.740> mixes<00:01:52.250> up<00:01:52.520> I<00:01:52.960> believe<00:01:53.960> it

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
that basically mixes up I believe it

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.990 
that basically mixes up I believe it
makes<00:01:54.290> it<00:01:54.470> pretty<00:01:55.130> well<00:01:55.900> you<00:01:56.900> let's<00:01:57.200> have<00:01:57.350> like

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
makes it pretty well you let's have like

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.700 
makes it pretty well you let's have like
if<00:01:59.000> you<00:01:59.119> don't<00:01:59.300> have<00:01:59.390> like<00:01:59.540> a<00:01:59.570> shaker<00:01:59.900> ball<00:02:00.200> or

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
if you don't have like a shaker ball or

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.890 
if you don't have like a shaker ball or
something<00:02:00.860> you'll<00:02:01.220> get<00:02:01.400> a<00:02:01.430> couple<00:02:01.880> chunks<00:02:02.180> in

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:02.900 
something you'll get a couple chunks in

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.350 
something you'll get a couple chunks in
it<00:02:03.530> like<00:02:04.250> you<00:02:04.460> just<00:02:04.490> have<00:02:04.700> to<00:02:04.850> wait<00:02:05.030> for<00:02:05.060> them

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
it like you just have to wait for them

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.330 
it like you just have to wait for them
just<00:02:05.539> to<00:02:05.930> dissolve<00:02:06.619> the<00:02:06.770> never<00:02:07.070> feel<00:02:07.250> like

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
just to dissolve the never feel like

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:14.380 
just to dissolve the never feel like
that<00:02:10.810> the<00:02:11.810> flavor<00:02:12.050> is<00:02:12.170> also<00:02:12.560> really<00:02:13.250> strong<00:02:13.730> so

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
that the flavor is also really strong so

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.470 
that the flavor is also really strong so
if<00:02:14.750> you<00:02:15.410> need<00:02:15.700> if<00:02:16.700> you<00:02:16.910> don't<00:02:17.090> like<00:02:17.300> the

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
if you need if you don't like the

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:18.850 
if you need if you don't like the
strongness<00:02:17.810> of<00:02:18.140> the<00:02:18.200> flavor<00:02:18.440> you<00:02:18.620> probably

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
strongness of the flavor you probably

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.979 
strongness of the flavor you probably
want<00:02:19.010> to<00:02:19.070> add<00:02:19.220> more<00:02:19.459> water<00:02:19.670> or<00:02:20.060> just<00:02:20.570> use<00:02:20.750> less

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:20.989 
want to add more water or just use less

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:24.250 
want to add more water or just use less
