speeds and things you can also slow it

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.920 
speeds and things you can also slow it
down<00:01:37.829> or<00:01:38.130> speed<00:01:38.310> it<00:01:38.460> up<00:01:38.700> and<00:01:38.939> you<00:01:39.000> can<00:01:39.720> see<00:01:39.869> you

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
down or speed it up and you can see you

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.929 
down or speed it up and you can see you
have<00:01:39.960> two<00:01:40.170> respring<00:01:40.650> when<00:01:41.310> you<00:01:41.430> change<00:01:41.700> that

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
have two respring when you change that

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.670 
have two respring when you change that
so<00:01:42.450> that's<00:01:42.750> pretty<00:01:42.869> good<00:01:43.229> tweak<00:01:43.500> that's

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
so that's pretty good tweak that's

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.280 
so that's pretty good tweak that's
called<00:01:43.950> speed<00:01:44.159> intensifier<00:01:44.939> and<00:01:45.329> next<00:01:46.020> up<00:01:46.140> we

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
called speed intensifier and next up we

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.810 
called speed intensifier and next up we
might<00:01:46.470> see<00:01:46.680> when<00:01:46.799> I<00:01:46.829> was<00:01:47.009> there<00:01:47.280> swiping<00:01:47.790> from

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
might see when I was there swiping from

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.639 
might see when I was there swiping from
side<00:01:48.149> to<00:01:48.180> side<00:01:48.299> that<00:01:48.720> you<00:01:49.229> know<00:01:49.380> you've<00:01:49.530> got

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
side to side that you know you've got

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.740 
side to side that you know you've got
these<00:01:49.770> cool<00:01:50.159> animation<00:01:50.820> as<00:01:51.119> you<00:01:51.240> can<00:01:51.390> see<00:01:51.600> it

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
these cool animation as you can see it

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.420 
these cool animation as you can see it
sort<00:01:51.960> of<00:01:52.079> it's<00:01:52.590> a<00:01:52.649> bit<00:01:52.770> of<00:01:52.860> a<00:01:52.950> square<00:01:53.250> at<00:01:53.340> the

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
sort of it's a bit of a square at the

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.969 
sort of it's a bit of a square at the
moment<00:01:53.759> that's<00:01:54.240> courtesy<00:01:54.780> of<00:01:54.810> barrel<00:01:55.380> 2<00:01:55.649> so

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
moment that's courtesy of barrel 2 so

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.100 
moment that's courtesy of barrel 2 so
again<00:01:56.250> we'll<00:01:56.399> just<00:01:56.430> jump<00:01:56.759> into<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.390> settings

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
again we'll just jump into the settings

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.080 
again we'll just jump into the settings
menu<00:01:58.259> so<00:01:58.950> you<00:01:59.040> can<00:01:59.189> see<00:01:59.340> we've<00:01:59.460> got<00:01:59.549> barrel<00:01:59.939> and

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
menu so you can see we've got barrel and

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.310 
menu so you can see we've got barrel and
you<00:02:00.119> can<00:02:00.270> go<00:02:00.420> ahead<00:02:00.509> and<00:02:00.659> change<00:02:00.960> the

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
you can go ahead and change the

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.679 
you can go ahead and change the
animation<00:02:01.890> to<00:02:02.610> whatever<00:02:02.850> you<00:02:03.060> want<00:02:03.149> to<00:02:03.270> do<00:02:03.450> so

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
animation to whatever you want to do so

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.990 
animation to whatever you want to do so
we'll<00:02:03.810> just<00:02:03.960> try<00:02:04.170> ripple<00:02:04.649> and<00:02:05.280> I<00:02:05.340> don't<00:02:05.399> think

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
we'll just try ripple and I don't think

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.540 
we'll just try ripple and I don't think
you<00:02:06.149> have<00:02:06.270> to<00:02:06.420> respring<00:02:06.840> when<00:02:07.079> you<00:02:07.170> do<00:02:07.290> this<00:02:07.550> so

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
you have to respring when you do this so

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:09.859 
you have to respring when you do this so
you<00:02:08.640> can<00:02:08.789> see<00:02:08.970> there<00:02:09.179> that<00:02:09.209> just<00:02:09.660> sort<00:02:09.810> of

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
you can see there that just sort of

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.559 
you can see there that just sort of
changes<00:02:10.289> it<00:02:10.879> and<00:02:11.879> I<00:02:12.000> think<00:02:12.209> you<00:02:12.330> might

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
changes it and I think you might

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.970 
changes it and I think you might
actually<00:02:12.690> have<00:02:12.900> to<00:02:13.170> free<00:02:13.500> spring<00:02:13.830> when<00:02:13.950> you

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
actually have to free spring when you

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.089 
actually have to free spring when you
change<00:02:14.310> that<00:02:14.520> we'll<00:02:14.670> just<00:02:14.790> try<00:02:14.940> one<00:02:15.150> more<00:02:16.099> full

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
change that we'll just try one more full

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:19.520 
change that we'll just try one more full
left<00:02:17.370> that'll<00:02:17.760> be<00:02:17.849> quite<00:02:18.000> obvious<00:02:18.410> so<00:02:19.410> we'll

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
left that'll be quite obvious so we'll

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.589 
left that'll be quite obvious so we'll
come<00:02:19.709> out<00:02:19.860> and<00:02:19.920> alright<00:02:20.790> ok<00:02:21.090> so<00:02:21.330> you<00:02:21.390> can<00:02:21.480> see

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
come out and alright ok so you can see

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:23.150 
come out and alright ok so you can see
there<00:02:21.930> you've<00:02:22.379> got<00:02:22.410> some<00:02:22.560> nice<00:02:22.920> cool

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
there you've got some nice cool

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.619 
there you've got some nice cool
animation<00:02:23.700> so<00:02:23.790> you'd<00:02:23.910> have<00:02:23.940> to<00:02:24.090> re<00:02:24.300> spring

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:24.629 
animation so you'd have to re spring

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:26.720 
animation so you'd have to re spring
especially<00:02:25.200> is<00:02:25.470> quite<00:02:25.830> important<00:02:26.280> on<00:02:26.489> and

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
especially is quite important on and

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.370 
especially is quite important on and
this<00:02:27.300> kind<00:02:27.629> of<00:02:27.750> job

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
this kind of job

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.530 
this kind of job
I'm<00:02:28.890> on<00:02:29.010> tethered<00:02:29.430> iOS<00:02:29.730> 6<00:02:29.940> jailbreak<00:02:30.330> so

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
I'm on tethered iOS 6 jailbreak so

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.020 
I'm on tethered iOS 6 jailbreak so
restringing<00:02:31.080> and<00:02:31.380> rebooting<00:02:32.040> is<00:02:32.190> a<00:02:32.340> bit<00:02:32.820> of<00:02:32.940> a

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
restringing and rebooting is a bit of a

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.730 
restringing and rebooting is a bit of a
pain<00:02:33.240> so<00:02:33.630> that's<00:02:33.870> good<00:02:34.080> you<00:02:34.260> can<00:02:34.290> see<00:02:34.560> there

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
pain so that's good you can see there

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
pain so that's good you can see there
you<00:02:34.860> have<00:02:35.040> for<00:02:35.220> the<00:02:35.280> nice<00:02:35.430> little<00:02:35.610> animation

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
you have for the nice little animation

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.720 
you have for the nice little animation
so<00:02:36.600> that's<00:02:36.870> barrel<00:02:37.260> 2<00:02:37.470> according<00:02:38.400> to<00:02:38.610> make

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
so that's barrel 2 according to make

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.370 
so that's barrel 2 according to make
sure<00:02:38.820> you've<00:02:38.910> got<00:02:38.940> our<00:02:39.270> kana<00:02:39.540> chasm<00:02:39.960> so<00:02:40.200> this

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
sure you've got our kana chasm so this

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.380 
sure you've got our kana chasm so this
is<00:02:40.500> obviously<00:02:40.680> how<00:02:41.130> I've<00:02:41.280> got<00:02:41.520> five<00:02:42.030> rows<00:02:42.360> of

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
is obviously how I've got five rows of

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.200 
is obviously how I've got five rows of
or<00:02:43.110> five<00:02:43.350> columns<00:02:43.680> let's<00:02:43.860> just<00:02:43.980> say<00:02:44.130> on<00:02:44.910> my

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.210 
or five columns let's just say on my

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:46.610 
or five columns let's just say on my
spring<00:02:45.630> board<00:02:45.810> here<00:02:46.020> usually<00:02:46.230> I'll<00:02:46.440> use

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
spring board here usually I'll use

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.100 
spring board here usually I'll use
spring<00:02:47.130> to<00:02:47.250> Mai's<00:02:47.430> but<00:02:47.790> that's<00:02:48.060> not<00:02:48.660> updated

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
spring to Mai's but that's not updated

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.140 
spring to Mai's but that's not updated
for<00:02:49.140> iOS<00:02:49.500> 6<00:02:49.710> yet<00:02:49.950> so<00:02:50.520> where<00:02:50.730> you<00:02:50.880> can<00:02:51.000> use

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
for iOS 6 yet so where you can use

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.730 
for iOS 6 yet so where you can use
iconoclasm<00:02:51.720> and<00:02:52.050> you<00:02:52.110> can<00:02:52.260> use<00:02:52.410> loads<00:02:52.620> of

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:52.740 
iconoclasm and you can use loads of

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.380 
iconoclasm and you can use loads of
different<00:02:52.830> layouts<00:02:53.280> I'm<00:02:53.460> sure<00:02:53.640> you're<00:02:54.150> aware

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
different layouts I'm sure you're aware

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:55.850 
different layouts I'm sure you're aware
of<00:02:54.540> this<00:02:54.690> so<00:02:54.990> where<00:02:55.230> you<00:02:55.350> can<00:02:55.470> go<00:02:55.620> ahead<00:02:55.710> and

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
of this so where you can go ahead and

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.620 
of this so where you can go ahead and
download<00:02:56.100> or<00:02:56.460> custom<00:02:56.850> layouts<00:02:57.150> from<00:02:57.300> Cydia

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
download or custom layouts from Cydia

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:58.430 
download or custom layouts from Cydia
and<00:02:57.720> things<00:02:57.930> where<00:02:58.110> I<00:02:58.140> could<00:02:58.320> in<00:02:58.380> the

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
and things where I could in the

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.380 
and things where I could in the
classroom<00:02:58.740> so<00:02:59.310> like<00:02:59.760> I<00:02:59.790> say<00:02:59.910> that's<00:03:00.030> a<00:03:00.210> really

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
classroom so like I say that's a really

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.750 
classroom so like I say that's a really
good<00:03:00.600> tweak<00:03:00.810> to<00:03:00.960> have<00:03:01.110> on<00:03:01.320> your<00:03:01.470> iDevice<00:03:01.760> next

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
good tweak to have on your iDevice next

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.780 
good tweak to have on your iDevice next
up<00:03:02.880> we've<00:03:03.060> got<00:03:03.090> NC<00:03:03.600> settings<00:03:04.310> now<00:03:05.310> that's

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
up we've got NC settings now that's

tab<00:03:41.550> clock<00:03:41.970> so<00:03:42.600> this<00:03:42.780> basically<00:03:43.700> this<00:03:44.700> is

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
tab clock so this basically this is

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.310 
tab clock so this basically this is
going<00:03:45.090> to<00:03:45.180> be<00:03:45.360> a<00:03:45.390> bit<00:03:45.600> of<00:03:45.690> a<00:03:45.720> pain<00:03:45.930> cuz<00:03:46.140> I've<00:03:46.230> got

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:46.320 
going to be a bit of a pain cuz I've got

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.320 
going to be a bit of a pain cuz I've got
a<00:03:46.350> zephyr<00:03:46.590> on<00:03:46.740> at<00:03:46.830> the<00:03:46.890> moment<00:03:47.190> if<00:03:47.790> we<00:03:47.970> just<00:03:48.120> go

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.330 
a zephyr on at the moment if we just go

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:52.670 
a zephyr on at the moment if we just go
into<00:03:48.600> a<00:03:49.080> random<00:03:49.470> game<00:03:49.650> we're<00:03:49.920> going<00:03:50.040> to<00:03:50.510> pvz<00:03:51.680> if

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
into a random game we're going to pvz if

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.040 
into a random game we're going to pvz if
you<00:03:52.860> go<00:03:53.010> ahead<00:03:53.100> and<00:03:53.340> slide<00:03:53.610> down<00:03:53.840> we<00:03:54.840> might

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.050 
you go ahead and slide down we might

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:56.240 
you go ahead and slide down we might
actually<00:03:55.170> have<00:03:55.410> to<00:03:55.440> wait<00:03:55.650> for<00:03:55.860> this<00:03:55.980> just<00:03:56.130> to

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
actually have to wait for this just to

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.580 
actually have to wait for this just to
be<00:03:56.280> well<00:03:56.550> quickly<00:03:57.050> just<00:03:58.050> turn<00:03:58.260> that<00:03:58.290> down<00:03:58.530> a

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
be well quickly just turn that down a

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.580 
be well quickly just turn that down a
bit<00:03:58.680> so<00:03:59.459> then<00:03:59.700> when<00:04:00.540> you<00:04:00.570> basically<00:04:00.870> slide

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
bit so then when you basically slide

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.970 
bit so then when you basically slide
down<00:04:01.950> to<00:04:02.450> use<00:04:03.450> your<00:04:03.750> Notification<00:04:04.590> Center<00:04:04.620> you

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
down to use your Notification Center you

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.380 
down to use your Notification Center you
can<00:04:05.040> see<00:04:05.130> the<00:04:05.370> little<00:04:05.640> tab<00:04:05.880> that<00:04:05.910> comes<00:04:06.209> down

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
can see the little tab that comes down

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.660 
can see the little tab that comes down
he's<00:04:06.600> actually<00:04:06.780> has<00:04:07.110> the<00:04:07.290> clock<00:04:07.530> overlaid<00:04:08.459> on

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
he's actually has the clock overlaid on

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.370 
he's actually has the clock overlaid on
that<00:04:08.880> so<00:04:09.360> that's<00:04:09.750> really<00:04:09.930> handy<00:04:10.110> especially

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
that so that's really handy especially

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.500 
that so that's really handy especially
if<00:04:10.740> you're<00:04:10.830> playing<00:04:11.100> games<00:04:11.880> you<00:04:12.300> know<00:04:12.420> you

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
if you're playing games you know you

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.300 
if you're playing games you know you
don't<00:04:12.660> exit<00:04:13.110> just<00:04:13.260> to<00:04:13.410> see<00:04:13.560> the<00:04:13.709> time<00:04:13.950> you<00:04:14.160> can

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
don't exit just to see the time you can

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:15.500 
don't exit just to see the time you can
just<00:04:14.459> slide<00:04:14.640> down<00:04:14.670> and<00:04:15.060> that<00:04:15.150> gives<00:04:15.330> you<00:04:15.390> the

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
just slide down and that gives you the

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:18.170 
just slide down and that gives you the
time<00:04:16.070> very<00:04:17.070> simple<00:04:17.400> tricks<00:04:17.640> like<00:04:17.760> that<00:04:17.820> but

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
time very simple tricks like that but

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.449 
time very simple tricks like that but
can<00:04:18.480> kind<00:04:19.109> of<00:04:19.200> be<00:04:19.320> quite<00:04:19.590> invaluable<00:04:19.830> a<00:04:20.220> lot<00:04:20.340> of

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
can kind of be quite invaluable a lot of

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.000 
can kind of be quite invaluable a lot of
times<00:04:20.670> really<00:04:21.420> again<00:04:21.660> tweak<00:04:22.530> that<00:04:22.710> I<00:04:22.770> really
