00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:54.340 
into the jump by using my hip flexors to

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.060 
into the jump by using my hip flexors to
pull<00:00:54.610> myself<00:00:54.850> down<00:00:55.360> my<00:00:56.080> feet<00:00:56.379> actually<00:00:56.620> come

pull myself down my feet actually come

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.910 
pull myself down my feet actually come
off<00:00:57.340> the<00:00:57.580> ground<00:00:57.940> as<00:00:58.269> my<00:00:58.809> body<00:00:59.080> is<00:00:59.290> bending

00:00:59.910 --> 00:00:59.920 
off the ground as my body is bending

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.700 
off the ground as my body is bending
down<00:01:00.160> into<00:01:00.970> the<00:01:01.089> junk<00:01:01.360> the<00:01:02.110> reason<00:01:02.410> I'm<00:01:02.500> doing

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:02.710 
down into the junk the reason I'm doing

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.460 
down into the junk the reason I'm doing
this<00:01:02.860> is<00:01:03.190> because<00:01:03.430> the<00:01:04.119> best<00:01:04.330> athletes<00:01:04.809> the

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:05.470 
this is because the best athletes the

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.120 
this is because the best athletes the
fastest<00:01:06.070> sprinters<00:01:06.700> the<00:01:07.180> best<00:01:07.390> jumpers<00:01:08.130> they

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.130 
fastest sprinters the best jumpers they

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.749 
fastest sprinters the best jumpers they
convert<00:01:09.970> that<00:01:10.860> downwards<00:01:11.860> force<00:01:12.250> into

00:01:12.749 --> 00:01:12.759 
convert that downwards force into

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:15.029 
convert that downwards force into
upwards<00:01:13.300> force<00:01:13.570> the<00:01:13.780> fastest<00:01:14.229> and<00:01:14.470> they

00:01:15.029 --> 00:01:15.039 
upwards force the fastest and they

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:17.969 
upwards force the fastest and they
actually<00:01:15.280> moves<00:01:15.850> down<00:01:16.240> and<00:01:16.600> jumps<00:01:17.020> faster

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:17.979 
actually moves down and jumps faster

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:21.510 
actually moves down and jumps faster
than<00:01:18.580> the<00:01:18.820> average<00:01:18.930> sprinter<00:01:19.930> jumper<00:01:20.380> so<00:01:21.310> I'm

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
than the average sprinter jumper so I'm

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.180 
than the average sprinter jumper so I'm
trying<00:01:21.940> to<00:01:22.030> teach<00:01:22.360> my<00:01:22.570> body<00:01:22.899> teach<00:01:23.500> my<00:01:23.710> nervous

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:24.190 
trying to teach my body teach my nervous

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.779 
trying to teach my body teach my nervous
system<00:01:24.360> to<00:01:25.710> store<00:01:26.710> and<00:01:27.130> release<00:01:27.430> energy

00:01:27.779 --> 00:01:27.789 
system to store and release energy

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:30.300 
system to store and release energy
faster<00:01:28.630> than<00:01:29.080> the<00:01:29.170> next<00:01:29.320> guy<00:01:29.590> that's<00:01:30.160> what

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 
faster than the next guy that's what

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.190 
faster than the next guy that's what
that<00:01:30.430> drill<00:01:30.640> is<00:01:30.670> all<00:01:30.850> about<00:01:31.119> and<00:01:31.570> that<00:01:31.600> tells
