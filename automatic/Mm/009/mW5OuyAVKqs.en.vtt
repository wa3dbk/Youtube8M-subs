see I mean I think the only five-star
skill<00:01:29.490> I<00:01:29.579> see<00:01:29.790> using<00:01:30.119> this<00:01:30.329> is<00:01:30.540> rebury<00:01:31.020> so<00:01:31.759> it's

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
skill I see using this is rebury so it's

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.780 
skill I see using this is rebury so it's
very<00:01:32.970> much<00:01:33.210> long<00:01:33.869> shots<00:01:34.259> and<00:01:34.650> nice<00:01:35.189> passing

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
movements going past people but it's

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.550 
movements going past people but it's
quite<00:01:38.729> different<00:01:39.119> I<00:01:39.420> mean<00:01:39.540> I<00:01:39.689> like<00:01:39.930> it<00:01:40.229> quite<00:01:40.500> a

lot<00:01:40.619> I<00:01:40.799> mean<00:01:40.920> is<00:01:41.280> it<00:01:41.549> does<00:01:42.000> there's<00:01:42.360> quite<00:01:42.600> a

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
lot I mean is it does there's quite a

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.929 
lot I mean is it does there's quite a
lot<00:01:42.780> of<00:01:42.840> long<00:01:43.049> shots<00:01:43.189> hyndai<00:01:44.189> but<00:01:44.490> someone<00:01:44.820> for

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
lot of long shots hyndai but someone for
