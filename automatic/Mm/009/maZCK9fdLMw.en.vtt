inside compartment out like this and it
just<00:01:40.710> lifts<00:01:41.100> out<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:41.520> there's<00:01:42.150> these<00:01:42.240> little

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600

act<00:01:45.899> on<00:01:45.990> a<00:01:46.049> sliding<00:01:46.409> mechanism<00:01:46.560> on<00:01:47.100> both<00:01:47.399> parts

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
act on a sliding mechanism on both parts

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.730 
act on a sliding mechanism on both parts
and<00:01:48.090> so<00:01:48.659> you<00:01:48.720> just<00:01:48.990> slide<00:01:49.170> them<00:01:49.409> in<00:01:49.909> like<00:01:50.909> that

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
and so you just slide them in like that

and so you just slide them in like that
there<00:01:52.740> we<00:01:52.799> go<00:01:52.950> so<00:01:53.369> that's<00:01:53.549> already<00:01:53.700> I'll<00:01:54.000> just

there's you can go up and down not quite

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:32.310 
there's you can go up and down not quite

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:32.320 
as well as some other stuff but it still

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:35.009 
as well as some other stuff but it still

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:35.019 
does at 360 hip rotation or waist

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:38.370 
does at 360 hip rotation or waist
rotation<00:03:35.170> rather<00:03:35.970> 360<00:03:36.970> ball<00:03:37.120> joint<00:03:37.390> here<00:03:37.750> is

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
rotation rather 360 ball joint here is

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.170 
rotation rather 360 ball joint here is
slightly<00:03:38.680> hindered<00:03:39.070> by<00:03:39.190> how<00:03:39.370> thick<00:03:39.700> this<00:03:39.970> is

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
slightly hindered by how thick this is

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:41.250 
slightly hindered by how thick this is
in<00:03:40.330> here

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
in here

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.500 
in here
double<00:03:41.709> knee<00:03:41.830> joint<00:03:42.070> right<00:03:42.250> here<00:03:42.510> swiveling

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
double knee joint right here swiveling

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.100 
double knee joint right here swiveling
at<00:03:43.630> the<00:03:43.720> foot<00:03:43.930> so<00:03:44.560> very<00:03:44.739> well<00:03:44.920> articulated

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
at the foot so very well articulated

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:48.330 
at the foot so very well articulated
these<00:03:47.110> shoulder<00:03:47.470> pads<00:03:47.680> aren't<00:03:47.860> on<00:03:47.950> a<00:03:47.980> hinge<00:03:48.220> or

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
these shoulder pads aren't on a hinge or

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.240 
these shoulder pads aren't on a hinge or
anything<00:03:48.550> they're<00:03:48.820> just<00:03:48.970> kind<00:03:49.150> of<00:03:49.269> molded<00:03:49.630> in

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
anything they're just kind of molded in

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.670 
anything they're just kind of molded in
and<00:03:51.250> so<00:03:51.880> that's<00:03:52.630> kind<00:03:52.840> of<00:03:52.930> nice<00:03:53.110> I<00:03:53.290> guess<00:03:53.350> and

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
and so that's kind of nice I guess and

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.020 
and so that's kind of nice I guess and
it<00:03:53.769> gives<00:03:54.160> them<00:03:54.250> pretty<00:03:54.459> free<00:03:54.700> movement

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
it gives them pretty free movement

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:57.449 
it gives them pretty free movement
around<00:03:55.209> here<00:03:55.500> so<00:03:56.500> let's<00:03:57.070> go<00:03:57.160> ahead<00:03:57.220> and<00:03:57.310> switch

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
around here so let's go ahead and switch

00:03:57.459 --> 00:03:58.979 
around here so let's go ahead and switch
out<00:03:57.640> his<00:03:57.760> hand<00:03:57.970> something<00:03:58.269> I<00:03:58.330> really<00:03:58.630> rarely

laziness I apologize about that and pull
that<00:04:02.800> out<00:04:02.860> that's<00:04:03.610> done<00:04:03.910> by<00:04:04.030> a<00:04:04.060> ball<00:04:04.269> joint

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
that out that's done by a ball joint

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.540 
that out that's done by a ball joint
which<00:04:05.680> I'm<00:04:05.800> what<00:04:05.950> I'm<00:04:06.040> holding<00:04:06.160> it<00:04:06.400> in<00:04:06.430> this

hand do I um yeah I'll switch this mist
out<00:04:10.959> first<00:04:11.170> I<00:04:11.290> guess<00:04:11.440> okay<00:04:12.100> I<00:04:12.280> was<00:04:12.430> trying<00:04:12.640> to

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.670 
out first I guess okay I was trying to

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:13.920 
out first I guess okay I was trying to
think<00:04:12.790> what<00:04:12.970> hand<00:04:13.180> I<00:04:13.269> wanted<00:04:13.480> to<00:04:13.570> hold<00:04:13.720> the<00:04:13.780> gun

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
think what hand I wanted to hold the gun

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:15.720 
think what hand I wanted to hold the gun
with<00:04:14.080> and<00:04:14.260> which<00:04:14.350> one<00:04:14.470> he's<00:04:14.560> supposed<00:04:14.799> to<00:04:14.920> for

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730 
with and which one he's supposed to for

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:18.930 
with and which one he's supposed to for
this<00:04:15.850> pose<00:04:16.090> so<00:04:16.650> actually<00:04:17.650> pretty<00:04:18.340> easy<00:04:18.400> and

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
this pose so actually pretty easy and

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.039 
this pose so actually pretty easy and
now<00:04:19.269> it's<00:04:19.479> probably<00:04:19.720> gonna<00:04:19.810> be<00:04:19.870> difficult

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
now it's probably gonna be difficult

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:22.770 
now it's probably gonna be difficult
just<00:04:20.380> because<00:04:20.500> I<00:04:20.709> said<00:04:20.950> that<00:04:21.510> I'm<00:04:22.510> really

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780 
just because I said that I'm really

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.930 
just because I said that I'm really
careful<00:04:22.960> here<00:04:23.350> and<00:04:23.590> no<00:04:24.340> problems<00:04:24.760> with

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:24.940 
careful here and no problems with

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:26.880 
careful here and no problems with
looseness<00:04:25.210> a<00:04:25.750> lot<00:04:26.289> of<00:04:26.410> people<00:04:26.590> have<00:04:26.680> sometimes

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:26.890 
looseness a lot of people have sometimes

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:27.240 
looseness a lot of people have sometimes
that

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
that

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:28.380 
that
points<00:04:27.520> about<00:04:27.670> this<00:04:27.820> but<00:04:27.970> I<00:04:28.000> haven't<00:04:28.180> had<00:04:28.330> a

points about this but I haven't had a

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:30.720 
points about this but I haven't had a

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:30.730 
single loose cue on me so I consider

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:31.500 
single loose cue on me so I consider
myself<00:04:30.910> lucky

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:31.510 
myself lucky

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:36.290

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:57.490 
reason my fingers were still molded

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:58.770 
reason my fingers were still molded
together<00:04:57.790> here<00:04:58.030> like<00:04:58.060> where<00:04:58.420> it's<00:04:58.540> supposed

00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:58.780 
together here like where it's supposed

00:04:58.780 --> 00:04:59.340 
together here like where it's supposed
to<00:04:58.840> open

00:04:59.340 --> 00:04:59.350 
to open

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:00.840 
to open
they<00:04:59.770> were<00:04:59.830> molded<00:05:00.190> together<00:05:00.460> so<00:05:00.669> I'm<00:05:00.730> just

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:00.850 
they were molded together so I'm just

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:01.980 
they were molded together so I'm just
gonna<00:05:00.970> go<00:05:01.150> off<00:05:01.210> camera<00:05:01.450> over<00:05:01.630> here<00:05:01.690> exciting

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:01.990 
gonna go off camera over here exciting

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:06.110 
gonna go off camera over here exciting
get<00:05:02.110> a<00:05:02.140> better<00:05:02.260> angle<00:05:03.330> so<00:05:04.330> that<00:05:04.510> that's<00:05:04.780> odd

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 
get a better angle so that that's odd

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.630 
get a better angle so that that's odd
and<00:05:07.120> yeah<00:05:07.600> it<00:05:07.690> was<00:05:07.720> molded<00:05:08.169> together<00:05:08.580> it's<00:05:09.580> not

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:09.640 
and yeah it was molded together it's not

um he's actually a lot better than I
expected<00:06:07.169> I<00:06:07.620> actually<00:06:07.770> to<00:06:08.099> be<00:06:08.220> perfectly

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:08.610 
expected I actually to be perfectly

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:09.980 
expected I actually to be perfectly
honest<00:06:08.910> wasn't<00:06:09.210> looking<00:06:09.389> forward<00:06:09.599> to<00:06:09.750> him<00:06:09.870> too

honest wasn't looking forward to him too

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:11.210 
honest wasn't looking forward to him too
much<00:06:10.139> so<00:06:10.259> I<00:06:10.320> didn't<00:06:10.500> like<00:06:10.590> his<00:06:10.710> design<00:06:11.009> and<00:06:11.039> I

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:11.220 
much so I didn't like his design and I

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:13.670 
much so I didn't like his design and I
still<00:06:11.520> really<00:06:11.669> don't<00:06:12.320> but<00:06:13.320> he's<00:06:13.410> a<00:06:13.440> better

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:13.680 
still really don't but he's a better

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:14.839 
still really don't but he's a better
figure<00:06:13.889> than<00:06:14.039> I<00:06:14.099> thought<00:06:14.370> whoops<00:06:14.639> the

00:06:14.839 --> 00:06:14.849 
figure than I thought whoops the

00:06:14.849 --> 00:06:16.540 
figure than I thought whoops the
shoulder<00:06:15.150> pads<00:06:15.389> look<00:06:15.690> pretty<00:06:15.900> nice<00:06:16.110> and<00:06:16.440> a

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:16.550 
shoulder pads look pretty nice and a

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:19.100 
shoulder pads look pretty nice and a
great<00:06:17.550> articulation<00:06:17.789> and<00:06:18.509> he<00:06:18.570> just<00:06:18.720> looks<00:06:18.900> he

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:19.110 
great articulation and he just looks he

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:21.890 
great articulation and he just looks he
looks<00:06:19.139> good<00:06:19.410> with<00:06:19.530> the<00:06:19.590> other<00:06:19.680> blades<00:06:20.060> so<00:06:21.060> it's

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:21.900 
looks good with the other blades so it's

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:23.960 
looks good with the other blades so it's
why<00:06:22.020> I<00:06:22.050> commend<00:06:22.440> him<00:06:22.560> you<00:06:23.370> know<00:06:23.490> it's<00:06:23.759> really

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:23.970 
why I commend him you know it's really

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:25.580

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:25.590 
hard not to recommend this line that

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:27.529 
hard not to recommend this line that
often<00:06:26.009> except<00:06:26.310> for<00:06:26.430> actually<00:06:26.759> with<00:06:26.970> blade

00:06:27.529 --> 00:06:27.539 
often except for actually with blade

00:06:27.539 --> 00:06:29.749 
often except for actually with blade
himself<00:06:27.990> because<00:06:28.320> it's<00:06:28.440> so<00:06:28.650> cheap<00:06:28.979> so<00:06:29.639> if

00:06:29.749 --> 00:06:29.759 
himself because it's so cheap so if

00:06:29.759 --> 00:06:31.400 
himself because it's so cheap so if
you're<00:06:29.880> like<00:06:30.030> a<00:06:30.060> huge<00:06:30.360> Garen<00:06:30.780> fan<00:06:31.020> or<00:06:31.199> a<00:06:31.229> huge

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:31.410 
you're like a huge Garen fan or a huge

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:32.629 
you're like a huge Garen fan or a huge
fan<00:06:31.590> of<00:06:31.620> blade<00:06:31.979> and<00:06:32.160> you<00:06:32.250> want<00:06:32.400> something<00:06:32.580> to

00:06:32.629 --> 00:06:32.639 
fan of blade and you want something to

00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:34.219 
fan of blade and you want something to
represent<00:06:33.060> them<00:06:33.150> and<00:06:33.330> you<00:06:33.660> don't<00:06:34.050> want<00:06:34.169> to

00:06:34.219 --> 00:06:34.229 
represent them and you don't want to

00:06:34.229 --> 00:06:35.390 
represent them and you don't want to
wait<00:06:34.320> for<00:06:34.470> a<00:06:34.530> figure<00:06:34.680> didn't<00:06:35.010> want<00:06:35.130> to<00:06:35.220> spend

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:35.400 
wait for a figure didn't want to spend

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:37.399 
wait for a figure didn't want to spend
less<00:06:35.520> money<00:06:35.580> I<00:06:36.000> can<00:06:36.270> absolutely<00:06:36.599> recommend<00:06:37.139> it

00:06:37.399 --> 00:06:37.409 
less money I can absolutely recommend it

00:06:37.409 --> 00:06:39.439 
less money I can absolutely recommend it
it's<00:06:37.530> a<00:06:37.590> good<00:06:37.740> figure<00:06:38.070> I<00:06:38.250> just<00:06:39.210> personally

00:06:39.439 --> 00:06:39.449 
it's a good figure I just personally

00:06:39.449 --> 00:06:41.120 
it's a good figure I just personally
don't<00:06:39.659> prefer<00:06:39.870> the<00:06:39.990> design<00:06:40.320> so<00:06:40.889> if<00:06:41.010> you're

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:41.130 
don't prefer the design so if you're

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:44.629 
don't prefer the design so if you're
being<00:06:41.280> choosy<00:06:41.639> then<00:06:42.030> I<00:06:43.099> would<00:06:44.099> skip<00:06:44.310> this<00:06:44.430> one

00:06:44.629 --> 00:06:44.639 
being choosy then I would skip this one

00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:46.129 
being choosy then I would skip this one
and<00:06:44.760> get<00:06:44.849> a<00:06:44.880> better<00:06:45.300> design<00:06:45.630> month<00:06:45.870> such<00:06:46.020> as

00:06:46.129 --> 00:06:46.139 
and get a better design month such as

00:06:46.139 --> 00:06:49.700 
and get a better design month such as
blade<00:06:46.349> king<00:06:46.650> or<00:06:46.860> momotaro's<00:06:47.789> or<00:06:48.060> Hibiki<00:06:48.960> so

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:49.710 
blade king or momotaro's or Hibiki so

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:51.830 
blade king or momotaro's or Hibiki so
yeah<00:06:49.889> it's<00:06:50.430> a<00:06:50.490> recommendation<00:06:50.820> for<00:06:51.330> fans<00:06:51.570> of

he's an e-zpass compared to other ones
that<00:06:56.099> are<00:06:56.220> better<00:06:56.340> but<00:06:57.000> he<00:06:57.120> was<00:06:57.270> quite<00:06:57.510> a

00:06:57.529 --> 00:06:57.539 
that are better but he was quite a

00:06:57.539 --> 00:06:59.689 
that are better but he was quite a
