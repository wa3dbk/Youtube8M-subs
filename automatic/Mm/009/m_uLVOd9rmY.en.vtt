00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 yes hello I'm back arg adrian and 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.970
 I show you today like a sixth 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.460
 That could not just change three 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.170
 figurines fit in even five namely 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.880
 then we put two small ones in the back 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.320
 go what you need for the conversion 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.940
 actually only this part would need 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.650
 this will later become the lightsaber of 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.760
 milk if you kept it that way 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.270
 actually your ship from the inside 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.510
 appearance 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:27.960
 Let's go first, this takes you 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:30.470
 Small red part off and put it to 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.380
 side after that you take the bracket and 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:37.440
 make them in there 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:40.110
 now you can get the lightsaber there 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.809
 into and we already have one 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.309
 place more for paler so for 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.570
 we need a total of four blasters now 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.280
 but place for the two clones 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:56.750
 that's why we take the bracket from 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:59.460
 the bombs way so put the side 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.730
 and now move these strips after 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.730
 behind 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:26.229
 did you do that you can do that 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:28.630
 retainer and turn it on 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:31.149
 are you done now you take your clones 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:34.060
 and she tries to put her in it 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:35.770
 sit back and relax a bit 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.810
 turn the helmet forward with it 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:43.479
 all later good closes the same 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:46.000
 do it with the other crowns 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:57.580
 turn the front so the two weapons come 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:59.049
 then here of course if you have this 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.670
 Two weapons out of here makes it fit 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:02.560
 not just five crowns but six 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.840
 but i also want to have a few before 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.009
 one who so I drop that and 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.479
 if you have done everything right 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:08.739
 can you actually everything 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:10.630
 close without any 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:11.799
 difficulty is only the 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.690
 ask what the left over 

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:15.069
 I like doing that so that I do 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.390
 even if i split them apart 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:18.370
 take some action on the figure 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.230
 not to let her do it later 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.540
 lose and that's why we do that 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.100
 There, yes, there it has a pretty 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.480
 Good place is even good colors 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.730
 together everything is fine 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.200

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.880
