evening or the afternoon you can do two
of<00:04:30.100> these<00:04:30.370> this<00:04:30.970> is<00:04:31.090> what<00:04:31.240> my<00:04:31.390> dad<00:04:31.600> does<00:04:31.870> and

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:32.350 
of these this is what my dad does and

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:35.760 
of these this is what my dad does and
he'll<00:04:32.800> hang<00:04:32.980> a<00:04:33.100> suit<00:04:33.370> like<00:04:33.760> that<00:04:33.820> I<00:04:34.620> don't<00:04:35.620> do

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:35.770

he'll hang a suit like that I don't do
this

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
this

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:39.870 
this
it<00:04:37.330> seems<00:04:37.600> overkill<00:04:38.110> to<00:04:38.230> me<00:04:38.350> so<00:04:38.950> but<00:04:39.280> by<00:04:39.760> all

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:39.880 
it seems overkill to me so but by all

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.460 
it seems overkill to me so but by all
means<00:04:39.910> do<00:04:40.330> it<00:04:40.420> the<00:04:40.510> Jamie<00:04:40.720> timing<00:04:41.140> way<00:04:41.230> if<00:04:41.380> you

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
means do it the Jamie timing way if you

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:44.190 
means do it the Jamie timing way if you
like<00:04:41.650> it<00:04:42.090> now<00:04:43.090> always<00:04:43.600> hang<00:04:43.840> your<00:04:44.020> wetsuit
