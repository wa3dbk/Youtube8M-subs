00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
you're still doing something you're

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.349 
you're still doing something you're
still<00:03:38.739> getting<00:03:38.889> the<00:03:39.069> codes<00:03:39.280> the<00:03:39.760> way<00:03:40.030> you<00:03:40.090> want

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:40.359

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:41.819 
still getting the codes the way you want
but<00:03:40.450> it's<00:03:40.660> like<00:03:40.780> the<00:03:40.900> full<00:03:41.139> list<00:03:41.380> of<00:03:41.530> all<00:03:41.709> the

but it's like the full list of all the

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:46.559 
but it's like the full list of all the
characters<00:03:43.049> um<00:03:44.049> and<00:03:45.120> the<00:03:46.120> main<00:03:46.269> reason<00:03:46.299> I'm

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:46.569 
characters um and the main reason I'm

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:48.300 
characters um and the main reason I'm
doing<00:03:46.750> that<00:03:46.930> is<00:03:47.109> because<00:03:47.350> YouTube<00:03:47.950> will<00:03:48.160> not

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
doing that is because YouTube will not

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:49.470 
doing that is because YouTube will not
let<00:03:48.459> me<00:03:48.579> put<00:03:48.819> the<00:03:48.940> code<00:03:49.150> in<00:03:49.180> the<00:03:49.450> description
