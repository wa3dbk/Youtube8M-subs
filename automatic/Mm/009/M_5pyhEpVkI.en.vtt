about<00:05:40.230> the<00:05:40.470> training<00:05:54.020> the<00:05:55.020> fact<00:05:55.290> is<00:05:55.470> -<00:05:56.160> three

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:56.790 
about the training the fact is - three

about the training the fact is - three
years<00:05:56.820> ago<00:05:57.150> when<00:05:57.510> I<00:05:57.540> was<00:05:57.780> training<00:05:58.020> you<00:05:58.440> know

00:05:58.910 --> 00:05:58.920 
years ago when I was training you know

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:00.770 
years ago when I was training you know
that<00:05:59.100> I<00:05:59.250> have<00:05:59.370> a<00:05:59.400> pretty<00:05:59.670> dynamic<00:06:00.030> style<00:06:00.600> of

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:00.780 
that I have a pretty dynamic style of

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:04.910 
that I have a pretty dynamic style of
planning<00:06:01.140> I<00:06:02.360> don't<00:06:03.360> know<00:06:03.450> one<00:06:04.050> day<00:06:04.230> for<00:06:04.500> just

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:04.920 
planning I don't know one day for just

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:06.650 
planning I don't know one day for just
playing<00:06:05.220> we<00:06:05.460> decide<00:06:05.790> to<00:06:05.910> plan<00:06:06.150> without<00:06:06.360> the

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:06.660 
playing we decide to plan without the

playing we decide to plan without the
Sun<00:06:07.640> we<00:06:08.640> just<00:06:09.390> discover<00:06:09.810> that<00:06:10.490> without<00:06:11.490> it<00:06:11.700> you

on their halls
you<00:06:16.740> cannot<00:06:17.010> anymore<00:06:18.570> yeah<00:06:19.230> be<00:06:19.440> hanged<00:06:19.680> on<00:06:19.860> it

you cannot anymore yeah be hanged on it
but<00:06:20.220> you<00:06:20.370> need<00:06:20.490> to<00:06:20.670> push<00:06:21.090> on<00:06:21.270> it<00:06:21.420> if<00:06:21.840> you<00:06:22.080> want

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:25.650 
to stay on the world so it's if it makes

you all yo your muscle and your body

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:33.020 
you all yo your muscle and your body
tension<00:06:28.460> walking<00:06:29.460> mod<00:06:29.700> and<00:06:29.970> then<00:06:30.360> usually<00:06:32.030> so

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:33.030 
tension walking mod and then usually so

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:35.900 
tension walking mod and then usually so
like<00:06:33.660> for<00:06:33.870> example<00:06:33.960> in<00:06:34.380> when<00:06:35.250> I<00:06:35.280> decide<00:06:35.880> to

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:35.910 
like for example in when I decide to

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:38.660 
like for example in when I decide to
prepare<00:06:36.390> for<00:06:36.570> BC<00:06:36.930> the<00:06:37.650> European<00:06:38.100> Championship

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:38.670 
prepare for BC the European Championship

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:41.540 
prepare for BC the European Championship
in<00:06:38.700> two<00:06:39.150> years<00:06:39.360> ago<00:06:39.420> I<00:06:39.890> did<00:06:40.890> mainly<00:06:41.250> in<00:06:41.310> this

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:41.550 
in two years ago I did mainly in this

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:45.260 
in two years ago I did mainly in this
kind<00:06:41.820> of<00:06:41.940> climbing<00:06:42.830> so<00:06:43.830> it<00:06:44.550> put<00:06:44.820> me<00:06:45.000> in<00:06:45.060> some

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:45.270 
kind of climbing so it put me in some

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:49.550 
kind of climbing so it put me in some
good<00:06:45.480> shape<00:06:45.750> more<00:06:46.380> more<00:06:47.310> quickly<00:06:47.580> than<00:06:47.910> I<00:06:48.560> had

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:49.560 
good shape more more quickly than I had

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:51.440 
good shape more more quickly than I had
the<00:06:49.710> feeling<00:06:50.010> that<00:06:50.040> it<00:06:50.520> was<00:06:50.850> more<00:06:51.060> efficient

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:51.450 
the feeling that it was more efficient

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:54.050 
the feeling that it was more efficient
than<00:06:51.630> the<00:06:52.080> usual<00:06:52.470> training<00:06:52.830> so<00:06:53.460> I<00:06:53.490> did<00:06:53.880> that

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:54.060 
than the usual training so I did that

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:56.960 
than the usual training so I did that
and<00:06:54.330> I<00:06:54.900> did<00:06:55.020> some<00:06:55.410> just<00:06:56.040> rock<00:06:56.550> climbing

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:56.970 
and I did some just rock climbing

00:06:56.970 --> 00:06:59.780 
and I did some just rock climbing
outside<00:06:57.600> this<00:06:57.810> so<00:06:58.530> I<00:06:58.560> can<00:06:58.770> work<00:06:59.040> as<00:06:59.370> well<00:06:59.610> my

00:06:59.780 --> 00:06:59.790 
outside this so I can work as well my

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:02.690 
outside this so I can work as well my
technical<00:07:00.560> the<00:07:01.560> night<00:07:01.800> technical<00:07:02.280> aspect<00:07:02.580> of

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:02.700 
technical the night technical aspect of

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:05.000 
technical the night technical aspect of
climbing<00:07:03.170> it's<00:07:04.170> pretty<00:07:04.410> interesting<00:07:04.710> because

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:05.010 
climbing it's pretty interesting because

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:09.170 
climbing it's pretty interesting because
it<00:07:05.460> it<00:07:06.180> is<00:07:06.360> forcing<00:07:06.810> you<00:07:06.990> to<00:07:07.760> you<00:07:08.760> have<00:07:08.850> to<00:07:09.000> move

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:09.180 
it it is forcing you to you have to move

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:14.360 
it it is forcing you to you have to move
differently<00:07:10.520> if<00:07:11.520> you<00:07:11.670> want<00:07:11.820> to<00:07:11.910> gain<00:07:12.090> some<00:07:13.370> if

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:14.370 
differently if you want to gain some if

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:16.040 
differently if you want to gain some if
you<00:07:14.460> want<00:07:14.640> to<00:07:14.790> be<00:07:14.880> more<00:07:15.030> dynamic<00:07:15.270> it's<00:07:15.810> very

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:16.050 
you want to be more dynamic it's very

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:18.230 
you want to be more dynamic it's very
interesting<00:07:16.290> because<00:07:16.590> you<00:07:17.120> physically<00:07:18.120> you

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:18.240 
interesting because you physically you

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:20.300 
interesting because you physically you
are<00:07:18.270> limited<00:07:18.780> with<00:07:18.950> audience<00:07:19.950> so<00:07:20.070> you<00:07:20.190> are

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:20.310 
are limited with audience so you are

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:22.810 
are limited with audience so you are
forced<00:07:20.460> to<00:07:20.610> do<00:07:20.730> to<00:07:21.120> climb<00:07:21.360> up<00:07:21.630> and<00:07:21.780> open<00:07:22.170> up<00:07:22.290> and

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:22.820 
forced to do to climb up and open up and

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:26.720 
forced to do to climb up and open up and
it's<00:07:23.820> interesting<00:07:24.150> but<00:07:25.070> maybe<00:07:26.070> it's<00:07:26.280> not

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:26.730 
it's interesting but maybe it's not

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:28.850 
it's interesting but maybe it's not
it<00:07:26.820> does<00:07:27.060> not<00:07:27.210> switch<00:07:27.480> to<00:07:27.510> to<00:07:28.140> a<00:07:28.170> bit<00:07:28.440> to<00:07:28.650> every

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:28.860 
it does not switch to to a bit to every

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:32.030 
it does not switch to to a bit to every
body<00:07:29.010> style<00:07:29.430> so<00:07:30.080> you<00:07:31.080> can<00:07:31.260> try<00:07:31.470> you<00:07:31.710> will<00:07:31.860> see

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:32.040 
body style so you can try you will see

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:42.260 
body style so you can try you will see
we<00:07:32.430> call<00:07:32.640> me<00:07:32.790> next<00:07:33.000> year<00:07:36.440> you<00:07:37.440> can<00:07:37.620> try<00:07:37.860> other
