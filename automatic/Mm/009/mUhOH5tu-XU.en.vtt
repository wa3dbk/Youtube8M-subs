00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:21.390
 do you already know how to shape them 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:30.460
 4 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:37.210
 no 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:37.210
 is above all 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.240
 yes preparation is still going well 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.640
 yes of course to a difficult period of 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.950
 last 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.030
 so in the last year and a half or two 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:57.900
 always a bit difficult 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.360
 been there 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:03.120
 but a little after all 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.920
 locked it up and left it behind 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.480
 already very tasty and good I form 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:11.600
 a few new people hired that 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:11.600
 training and yes on the way back to 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:15.740
 to my old top form and another one 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.740
 bit 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:23.510
 the condition the power and mine 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.510
 capacities 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.659
 yes i have i never have with him 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.390
 trained 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:35.770
 you are what those at the gym and 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.300
 has trained i have i but i have 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.490
 a nice experience the training or never 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:43.560
 megamind available i am now on the 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.560
 aware of his trainers capacities or 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.210
 or of its advantages and disadvantages are only 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:54.460
 agree in style so what I know about them 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:55.780
 knew rider and yes I have the rest 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.850
 actually almost to bet for 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.990
 it is a strong young big step 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.320
 fight 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.580
 boy with the fly with capacity but 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.590
 you should definitely not stand it 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.190
 or explain me in the form where I am 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.729
 will be able to 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:11.620
 no so yes i think that got on it 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.300
 wrong moment at the wrong time 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.410
 time those things that come with the tears 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.160
 years ago might be harder 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:21.100
 Making myself but certainly not 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.540
 for delivers to each other 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.340
 I have to tell you it's for me the 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.960
 first time i work with them i have one 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.780
 organization not really very good though 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:30.010
 again what i say every organization that 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.120
 our sport in the netherlands and that 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.460
 try to give a lower back or to one 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.020
 raise it to a higher level 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:37.930
 they will always count on my vote and 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:40.300
 what i say so far my way of 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.340
 dealing with the a1 is very good 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.420
 been and until now 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.240
 yes everything goes quite the whole 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.130
 gradually and quite as it should be 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:51.430
 so i am very satisfied with it and i 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:54.400
 Really looking forward to it 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:57.190
 to stand there and the 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.240
 organization and sport, but a following 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.740
 raise the level 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:04.260
 yes what is important for the youth 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:04.260
 that they stay focused and 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:10.060
 disciplined and especially good here 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.350
 shoes remain standing 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.210
 for the life white have temptations 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:15.220
 and we find it whole 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:16.630
 discipline is important 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.830
 good guidance that is very important 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.970
 to top it off when the ever miss us 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:22.510
 in sports 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:25.510
 so guidance discipline and a lot 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:27.280
 willpower and that it is not always 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.370
 beats someone less talented 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:32.920
 because you work hard always have someone there 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.630
 great can be coffee 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.600
 but I do not agree that our sport 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:40.180
 is in heavy weather 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.410
 i believe we are a very nice sport 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.450
 and I believe that very much 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:45.310
 people enjoy and the youth whole 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.870
 many of the so enjoy I think we 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.570
 not have to concentrate on the 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.650
 negativity hanging around I think 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:52.510
 we have to solve the problems 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.950
 where we can solve them but I think 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.420
 not that we have to make them big then 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:57.520
 that they actually are 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.750
 and the problems we face our sport 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.950
 have problems that are in every 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:02.440
 sport 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:04.570
 so I don't think we are 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.350
 that much the focus again i think we 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:06.490
 more 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:08.470
 how to focus the positive sides 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:09.760
 as great as the a1 what 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.900
 ranking May 15 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.910
 I have beautiful things and I think 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.130
 it should look more towards it 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:16.090
 instead of looking at chicken or go 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:18.940
 So 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:20.440
 yes i see our apron in the elevator 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.240
 xel of youth in the gym 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.710
 so for me that is a sign that it is 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:27.430
 goes very well in our sport 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:29.110
 so yes i don't see our sport itself 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.190
 different from other sport alone 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:33.699
 words might look a little more 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:34.930
 met and yes but otherwise it is 

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:35.949
 a great sport and i love it now 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:38.510
 looking at the positive side 

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:41.270
 not that my life and before 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:43.450
 because there is no one like me no I am 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:43.450
 the 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:49.190
 well what i say i am now in a moment 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:51.410
 in my life I step ahead of everything 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:53.690
 step how a match per match so 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:54.740
 I secretly look after May 15 and me 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:57.560
 think that is a very important step 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:59.000
 So I am really looking forward to that 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.720
 And yes you have to play one match first 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.350
 inside before you go to the next 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:05.330
 contest now viewer and that is what i am now 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:08.300
 do so I look forward to the gala 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:09.800
 and I look forward to opponent and that 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:11.450
 the organization with a serious wonder 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.560
 what they are going to have in there first 

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:16.130
 eindhoven 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:17.540
 so yes i can't wait listening 

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:20.840
 yes i am not working very much on the 

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:22.910
 fans so I think that is still good and 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:25.490
 the message that I am giving is 

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:26.300
 I hope everyone says you 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:27.470
 must stand 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:29.240
 and then i make sure i stand where i am 

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:29.570
 must stand that I built for the money 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.680
 to give 

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:32.680
 that is the most important thing 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:40.889
 they sing for the sacrifices that are stuck 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:45.150
 because it would one day 

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:53.000
 in a dream and nepal
