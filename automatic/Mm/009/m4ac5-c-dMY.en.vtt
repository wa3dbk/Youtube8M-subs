00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:09.880
 skaters of the region of Murcia is a 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.710
 very emergent group here where we 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:13.929
 we move through social networks like 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:16.750
 they can be facebook then we try 

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:19.540
 put on hangouts and each person puts a 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:21.039
 stayed at any time the people who 

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:22.660
 he works in the mornings people who 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:24.039
 he works half a day at night 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.930
 then you put your hangout and the people 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:27.609
 it is targeted usually have 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:29.590
 whenever we go in the area what 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:31.570
 would the sea and the stairs 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:34.360
 gathers a large enough group there are times 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.950
 more - and of all the levels the most 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.809
 veterans we always try a little 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:40.000
 take care of people that this one is 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:42.450
 starting and the truth that very well is 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.579
 to have a good time with good people 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.590
 and good to enjoy a sport where 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:50.050
 can be such a means of transportation and 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:52.090
 how are things today as a 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.440
 fun there are people that take a lot 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.750
 skating time from the start of the 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.300
 group and there are people who start now 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:00.100
 so the good thing is to appear and never 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.690
 It does the same to you because we're both going 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.210
 changing the routes that are made 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:06.790
 other distance - as you also found 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:09.130
 associated there are people who are not known 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.960
 it's not staying and suddenly saying with 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.760
 who skates today is not all a little says 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.020
 Well, we usually take everything 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.750
 would be the outer lane from the 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.390
 circular to this jack makes one up 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.490
 we arrived at what would be young future 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.900
 We also go towards the shot and 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.850
 who has a little more level 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.229
 because the complicated descent has a 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.210
 little bit of difficulty what would be the 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:30.670
 area of ​​the university we make new 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.470
