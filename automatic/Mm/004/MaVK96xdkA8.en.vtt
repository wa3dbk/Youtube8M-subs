00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:08.309
 Hi, good people 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.190
 I came here today answered a tag to 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:14.009
 I was invited by Marisa to 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:17.130
 answer this tag that calls five 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.650
 fashion secrets so I'll tell the 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.699
 tricks that I have that I do 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:26.820
 different 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:28.820
 so come on then the first secret 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.349
 What I'm going to tell you is how to use it. 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.420
 loose and tight clothing 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.530
 so you have to think of a format of the 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.140
 your body 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.120
 if the upper part is larger than the 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.020
 Part you just have more bust than 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.930
 hip 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:46.800
 You have to wear tight clothes on the 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:49.079
 Above the tuning attempt and clothes 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.410
 more loose strands on the side 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:54.660
 Bottom line is not to give volume so I 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.969
 I have and have this thing of having the bust 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:00.090
 bigger than the hip so I have 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:03.239
 who wear skirt round a thing with more 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.610
 volume on the bottom and a blouse 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.320
 more tightly on the top now 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.689
 who wants to do the opposite that is 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:13.409
 hid the hip and gives a volume in the part 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:16.080
 from the top have to wear bulky sweaters and 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.479
 It's the bottom has to be more 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.479
 justin then pants skinny pants more 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:25.520
 fair to give this contrast and 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.520
 balance the shape of your body 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:34.210
 The second secret that I'm going to tell you. 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:37.030
 You 're when you go out, stays the day. 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:40.240
 the whole day was only during the day 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:42.850
 working and at night you have a rap to the 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.009
 f have a party something more chic 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.500
 and you will not have time to 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:51.270
 get yourself out of your clothes then 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:54.640
 My trick is to go with some more clothes. 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:58.060
 that you can use in both 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.349
 Occasions but coming to the party you 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.569
 puts a leap 

00:01:59.349 --> 00:02:03.220
 so it will make your look look even more 

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:06.520
 chic more fashionable 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:13.720
 then a basic look plus a jump is 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:17.019
 chic third elegant secret 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.519
 accessories make the difference in time 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:21.280
 to dress 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:23.739
 so if you go there choose the clothes that 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:27.340
 Do you want to use ou or are you with a 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:29.680
 very simple clothes you no there I want 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.870
 A party today, but I do not know, there's nothing. 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:37.299
 different wardrobe takes a 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:39.040
 simple clothes or a simple look and play 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:42.549
 accessory so if you put a 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.980
 basic black dress and a collar on the 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:47.670
 home a different bracelet one 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:50.470
 big bank one thing that catches attention 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:53.470
 but that combines there with the whole visual 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:56.859
 It'll be cool then the accessories they 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:03:00.780
 can make up the look or even be the 

00:02:56.859 --> 00:03:00.780
 main of the whole visual 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:10.160
 Good, my secret room for you is use 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:13.640

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:16.610
 Then spring has come. 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:19.849
 thing to wear floral has the most 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:23.180
 clearer and more eye-catching uses to 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:25.849

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:37.069
 so it's always cool you get some 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:39.590
 thing there of the season some color or 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:42.130

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:45.049
 put in your day to day in your 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:48.739
 wardrobe for you 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:51.849
 besides being fashionable you give a life and 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:51.849
 in appearance 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:04:00.430
 well I my fifth and final secret to 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:04.040

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:14.150
 fashion that came out on the runway which is 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:16.850
 in the journal being that it does not combine 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:19.070
 With you I like to use things that 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:21.019

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.950
