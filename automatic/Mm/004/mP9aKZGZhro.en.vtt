00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:11.670
 the program is supported by the company 

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:11.670
 your protein athletic club diamond 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.330
 exercise 4 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:16.720
 bench press in the simulator on the lower part 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:19.659
 chest 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:21.579
 the middle grip is in our way 

00:00:19.659 --> 00:00:23.890
 say final chest exercise 

00:00:21.579 --> 00:00:25.449
 why is this simulator with us 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.909
 will be the final exercise 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:30.669
 because we went through a complex today 

00:00:27.909 --> 00:00:33.250
 which concerns precisely breasts we made 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:35.920
 the middle bunch of breasts we made upper 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:38.829
 a bunch of chest and now I think we are ready 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.940
 go to the lower bundle yes you all 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:42.070
 correctly said in principle 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:46.179
 the only thing that I wanted to correct 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:48.670
 the chest has no beams of glory where there is said 

00:00:46.179 --> 00:00:50.949
 local view so communicate in the river 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.660
 many there is an opinion there are no bunches on 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:54.789
 in fact, these are just zones 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.690
 distribution to just one big 

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:57.519
 chest muscles 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.739
 pectoralis major muscles underneath 

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:01.989
 small pectoral muscle but it is already middle 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:04.659
 the muscle layer is precisely the thoracic region therefore 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:06.820
 let's go to the lower pectoral muscle yes 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:09.700
 it is this exercise the end of the workout 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.850
 let's say rather the end of the workout 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:15.460
 chest muscles 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.980
 the third exercise is already on the chest shoulder 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:20.800
 the joint is tired stabilizing muscles like them 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:22.060
 call exactly the position up by given 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.980
 planes they are also tired and 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:27.160
 accordingly, the third exercise should 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:29.800
 be already with a given plane in 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.600
 this simulator he sets the plane but 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.760
 load should be maximized and 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.520
 accordingly the load goes here 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:38.200
 as with free weight ie lever 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.870
 simulator that is, we do not use 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.460
 block trainer yes we use 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.660
 lever simulators we have n't yet 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.930
 gain muscle tissue 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:49.200
 In short, everyone who does bench press and then 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.600
 go on free weight press 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.490
 chest until then go to the third exercise 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.860
 also press free weight on the bottom of the chest 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.469
 it wrong is not something that is not 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.020
 well let's just say it just sets 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.549
 initially taught trainings very 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.819
 heavy load on the shoulder joint 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:07.319
 let's say you did the thoracic giver 

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:09.660
 day you went do shoulders they 

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:11.760
 are loaded or well by speech joint well 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.849
 if you still use the shoulder joint 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.680
 and in other exercises literally through 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:18.780
 two or three weeks he sore in general 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.970
 save your shoulders save your shoulders yes because 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:24.660
 that when your shoulders hurt you do not walk knew 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:28.610
 yes let's sit down and simulator itself 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:31.590
 Again, the technology here has a taboo 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:34.709
 what exactly yes well yes probably 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.750
 lumbar to unload part of smog 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:38.700
 lumbar up to work 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.900
 it is the lower part of the chest 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.319
 yes you are right of course first 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:45.569
 lower back is what the lower back asks any 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:47.390
 angle the greater the deflection of the loins 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:49.140
 more flexing of the thoracic region 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:52.099
 accordingly, as if in the first place 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:55.019
 we set to his position the levers 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:56.790
 aiming even gay sit exactly if 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:58.739
 man will be engaged in such 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.810
 simulator for him an indicator of these 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:02.670
 levers should be about what 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:07.769
 level lower delta 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:10.350
 here here here so hwan middle managers 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:10.829
 dantex normal ozols you ok 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:16.910
 took myself 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:20.640
 positions on the cube to take a deep breath 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:24.110
 We drop the elbows slightly wider than a little 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:27.360
 lower a little more to the sides 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:28.080
 middle class 57 centimeters from 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:32.190
 carpal 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:33.860
 up to the shoulder joint chest maximum 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:36.810
 arched forward 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:38.400
 lumbar deflection persists on 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.890
 throughout the exercise 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.920
 blades come together for maximum 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:45.300
 work on the lower part like 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:48.870
 the top of the arm is completely 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:51.090
 straighten up here very clearly seen from 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:53.490
 you can directly look at the sides 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:56.520
 elbow sets see he puts his hand on 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:59.160
 elbow goes away and when lifting yes 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:02.520
 when he already does directly himself 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:04.860
 elbow press here in the end we are pairs 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:07.020
 driving in an arc goes and again goes to 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.280
 side reaching the middle only him 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:10.890
 leads a little lower 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.270
 Why so because Seats how to 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:12.900
 just below the bottom of the shoulder to 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:14.760
 handles 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.670
 sidushka raises him slightly so 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:20.820
 the movement of this simulator is set as 

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:22.590
 that the top point and the bottom point in 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:25.650
 same plane but when he 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:28.170
 runs through the center it goes below the hair 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:31.410
 casting is and so during training I 

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:33.390
 I can raise my head or not he 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:36.810
 I didn't have to give them away 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:38.850
 more convenient you can take your head off 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.410
 sidushki it does not matter 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:43.470
 by no means should you 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:45.720
 turn my head to the side and I have you 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:47.520
 yes this exercise exceptions 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:50.220
 accordingly , you can also do it here. 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:52.350
 you first sit down do you believe you 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.210
 a little porosta paul living to know 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:57.660
 you need literally a centimeter and a half 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:05:00.630
 lower the bench but do not take him away so much 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:01.860
 ok listen and you need to bend your back 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:05.190
 how to fix 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:08.000
 here now I fully watch the bodies 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:10.430
 you tass tightly pressed under 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.780
 base to take me to the base, 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:15.380
 me on the shoulder blades 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:17.600
 laying on the back here are all three points 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:20.150
 touch the main touch 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:23.570
 with bench press dumbbell dilution 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:26.750
 this is the touch of the tailbone then 

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:28.910
 or shoulder blades to the bottom position and head to 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:31.100
 the head is practically carrying on it 

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:34.520
 no load apologized first 

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:37.400
 the position of the elbows in the original and already 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:38.980
 stretched chest 1 to the original 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:41.810
 the position here is already full amplitude 

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:44.710
 let's go yes yes wait 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:47.630
 See how you position it brushes 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:51.500
 lowered to your wrist you should have 

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:57.340
 exactly it is even harder yes it is still done 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:59.660
 more amplitude of movement come on and exhale 

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:00.590
 deep web just this 

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:03.230
 muscle tremor 

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:04.760
 now we see many people come 

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:06.140
 in the hall begins to train again and 

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:08.480
 feel like they have no muscle 

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:10.280
 many give vibrations tremble and just 

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:12.979
 the same nerve conductor but the mind and i don't 

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:16.840
 controlled by synchronous reduction 

00:06:12.979 --> 00:06:22.190
 muscular group is okay agree 

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:27.080
 let's repeat and exhale and put everything 

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:30.160
 and similar exercise in training 

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:30.160
 Alexey gas from whom 

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:02.520
