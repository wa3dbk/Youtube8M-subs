the<00:02:29.390> clenched<00:02:30.390> fist<00:02:30.450> hand<00:02:31.170> you<00:02:31.379> draw<00:02:31.560> it

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
the clenched fist hand you draw it

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.490 
the clenched fist hand you draw it
really<00:02:32.010> clearly<00:02:32.400> defined<00:02:32.819> just<00:02:33.030> like<00:02:33.239> that

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
really clearly defined just like that

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.960 
really clearly defined just like that
oftentimes<00:02:34.500> they'll<00:02:34.859> have<00:02:35.010> some<00:02:35.250> sort<00:02:35.459> of<00:02:35.519> you

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
oftentimes they'll have some sort of you

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.000 
oftentimes they'll have some sort of you
know<00:02:36.000> gloves<00:02:36.480> or<00:02:36.689> I<00:02:36.900> don't<00:02:37.260> know<00:02:37.319> whatever<00:02:37.650> if

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
know gloves or I don't know whatever if

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.099 
know gloves or I don't know whatever if
their<00:02:38.159> costume<00:02:38.549> is<00:02:38.730> but<00:02:39.030> obviously<00:02:39.870> if<00:02:39.989> you're

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:40.109 
their costume is but obviously if you're

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:41.179 
their costume is but obviously if you're
creating<00:02:40.379> your<00:02:40.470> own<00:02:40.530> superhero<00:02:40.829> you're<00:02:41.069> going

00:02:41.179 --> 00:02:41.189 
creating your own superhero you're going

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:44.809 
creating your own superhero you're going
to<00:02:41.250> come<00:02:41.340> up<00:02:41.370> with<00:02:41.549> your<00:02:41.670> own<00:02:41.760> costume<00:02:43.670> so<00:02:44.670> as

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819 
to come up with your own costume so as

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:47.360 
to come up with your own costume so as
you<00:02:44.970> work<00:02:45.180> your<00:02:45.359> way<00:02:45.420> down<00:02:46.040> just<00:02:47.040> make<00:02:47.220> sure

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
you work your way down just make sure

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.759 
you work your way down just make sure
again<00:02:47.639> you<00:02:47.819> clearly<00:02:48.569> clearly<00:02:48.870> define<00:02:49.439> their

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
again you clearly clearly define their

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:54.710 
again you clearly clearly define their
bodies<00:02:50.209> make<00:02:51.209> sure<00:02:51.389> that<00:02:51.659> they<00:02:51.930> are<00:02:53.629> you<00:02:54.629> know

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
bodies make sure that they are you know

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:03.820 
bodies make sure that they are you know
impressive<00:02:55.560> as<00:02:55.859> you<00:02:56.040> can<00:02:56.189> make<00:02:56.340> them

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:05.950 

and<00:03:04.580> if<00:03:04.790> you<00:03:04.910> are<00:03:05.060> creating<00:03:05.420> a<00:03:05.480> character<00:03:05.660> that

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:05.960 
and if you are creating a character that

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.920 
and if you are creating a character that
can<00:03:06.110> fly<00:03:06.380> here's<00:03:07.310> a<00:03:07.370> good<00:03:07.610> flying<00:03:08.270> pose<00:03:08.570> for

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
can fly here's a good flying pose for

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:17.620 
can fly here's a good flying pose for
you<00:03:09.520> one<00:03:10.520> knee<00:03:10.790> up<00:03:11.000> one<00:03:11.510> leg<00:03:11.810> down<00:03:12.140> and<00:03:16.630> we're

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
you one knee up one leg down and we're

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.370 
you one knee up one leg down and we're
gonna<00:03:17.690> do<00:03:17.810> a<00:03:17.840> little<00:03:17.990> force<00:03:18.290> perspective<00:03:18.650> here

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
gonna do a little force perspective here

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.190 
gonna do a little force perspective here
his<00:03:21.380> leg<00:03:21.830> will<00:03:22.130> seemingly<00:03:22.730> get<00:03:23.090> smaller<00:03:23.540> as<00:03:24.020> it

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
his leg will seemingly get smaller as it

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.340 
his leg will seemingly get smaller as it
kind<00:03:24.320> of<00:03:24.410> goes<00:03:24.620> into<00:03:24.890> the<00:03:24.980> distance<00:03:25.340> there<00:03:26.350> but

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.350 
kind of goes into the distance there but

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:33.190 
kind of goes into the distance there but
really<00:03:31.090> it<00:03:32.090> is<00:03:32.240> just<00:03:32.270> a<00:03:32.630> force<00:03:32.870> perspective

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
really it is just a force perspective

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.810 
really it is just a force perspective
and<00:03:33.620> force<00:03:33.830> perspectives<00:03:34.460> are<00:03:34.580> everything

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:34.820 
and force perspectives are everything

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:39.040 
and force perspectives are everything
especially<00:03:35.090> in<00:03:35.750> the<00:03:35.870> comic<00:03:36.410> book<00:03:36.590> world<00:03:37.960> can<00:03:38.960> I

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:39.050 
especially in the comic book world can I

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:40.600 
especially in the comic book world can I
get<00:03:39.200> to<00:03:39.290> know<00:03:39.320> your<00:03:39.590> poses<00:03:39.860> basically<00:03:40.460> is<00:03:40.520> what

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:40.610 
get to know your poses basically is what

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:44.860 
get to know your poses basically is what
I'm<00:03:40.640> trying<00:03:40.790> to<00:03:40.910> say<00:03:43.150> figure<00:03:44.150> out<00:03:44.300> exactly<00:03:44.690> how

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
I'm trying to say figure out exactly how

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.450 
I'm trying to say figure out exactly how
to<00:03:44.900> draw<00:03:45.170> the<00:03:45.230> human<00:03:45.530> body<00:03:45.890> and<00:03:46.130> to<00:03:46.220> really

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:46.460 
to draw the human body and to really

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:47.920 
to draw the human body and to really
call<00:03:46.640> attention<00:03:46.670> to<00:03:47.150> the<00:03:47.300> specific<00:03:47.780> muscles

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
call attention to the specific muscles

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.350 
call attention to the specific muscles
and<00:03:48.410> body<00:03:49.250> parts<00:03:49.700> that<00:03:49.850> you<00:03:49.940> want<00:03:50.120> to<00:03:50.210> call

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360 
and body parts that you want to call

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.570 
and body parts that you want to call
attention<00:03:50.480> to<00:03:50.890> and<00:03:51.890> if<00:03:52.280> you're<00:03:52.400> going<00:03:52.520> to

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:52.580 
attention to and if you're going to

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:54.850 
attention to and if you're going to
create<00:03:52.790> a<00:03:52.880> fun<00:03:53.240> pose<00:03:53.510> like<00:03:54.350> say<00:03:54.530> this<00:03:54.680> one

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:54.860 
create a fun pose like say this one

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:56.080 
create a fun pose like say this one
where<00:03:55.010> the<00:03:55.070> person's<00:03:55.460> like<00:03:55.700> it's<00:03:55.910> kind<00:03:56.060> of

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
where the person's like it's kind of

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.300 
where the person's like it's kind of
coming<00:03:56.300> behind<00:03:56.630> their<00:03:56.900> knee<00:03:57.110> like<00:03:57.380> that<00:03:57.410> make

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.310 
coming behind their knee like that make

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:00.010 
coming behind their knee like that make
sure<00:03:58.490> you<00:03:58.580> clearly<00:03:58.970> define<00:03:59.180> it<00:03:59.540> so<00:03:59.690> everyone

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:00.020 
sure you clearly define it so everyone

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:01.180 
sure you clearly define it so everyone
understands<00:04:00.410> what<00:04:00.590> it<00:04:00.680> is<00:04:00.710> you're<00:04:00.890> trying<00:04:01.100> to

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.190 
understands what it is you're trying to

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:06.280 
understands what it is you're trying to
do<00:04:01.400> I<00:04:02.920> oftentimes<00:04:03.920> do<00:04:04.340> not<00:04:04.490> recommend<00:04:05.290> when

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
do I oftentimes do not recommend when

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:07.930 
do I oftentimes do not recommend when
you're<00:04:06.440> drawing<00:04:06.740> superheroes<00:04:07.460> using<00:04:07.850> a

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
you're drawing superheroes using a

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:09.520 
you're drawing superheroes using a
permanent<00:04:08.600> pen<00:04:08.780> especially<00:04:09.290> not<00:04:09.380> at<00:04:09.470> the

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
permanent pen especially not at the

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:10.690 
permanent pen especially not at the
beginning<00:04:09.650> in<00:04:10.010> with<00:04:10.130> you<00:04:10.250> if<00:04:10.400> you're<00:04:10.550> just

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 
beginning in with you if you're just

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.250 
beginning in with you if you're just
kind<00:04:11.030> of<00:04:11.120> starting<00:04:11.480> out<00:04:11.600> and<00:04:11.720> just<00:04:11.870> learning

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260 
kind of starting out and just learning

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.890 
kind of starting out and just learning
but<00:04:12.440> for<00:04:13.400> the<00:04:13.459> sake<00:04:13.670> of<00:04:13.700> visual<00:04:14.239> demonstration

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
but for the sake of visual demonstration

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:16.150 
but for the sake of visual demonstration
I'm<00:04:14.989> going<00:04:15.050> to<00:04:15.200> use<00:04:15.260> the<00:04:15.470> black<00:04:15.650> pen<00:04:15.709> here

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160 
I'm going to use the black pen here

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:17.890 
I'm going to use the black pen here
because<00:04:16.459> obviously<00:04:16.730> you<00:04:17.270> can<00:04:17.419> see<00:04:17.450> it<00:04:17.750> much

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
because obviously you can see it much

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:23.200 
because obviously you can see it much
clearer<00:04:18.260> and<00:04:18.290> it's<00:04:18.970> easier<00:04:19.970> to<00:04:20.239> you<00:04:20.930> know<00:04:22.210> to

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
clearer and it's easier to you know to

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:24.970 
clearer and it's easier to you know to
find<00:04:23.480> the<00:04:23.750> drawing<00:04:24.080> this<00:04:24.290> way<00:04:24.530> instead<00:04:24.860> of

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:24.980 
find the drawing this way instead of

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:26.710 
find the drawing this way instead of
going<00:04:25.190> over<00:04:25.280> with<00:04:25.490> a<00:04:25.520> pencil<00:04:25.820> if<00:04:26.450> you<00:04:26.600> were

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 
going over with a pencil if you were

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.000 
going over with a pencil if you were
creating<00:04:26.870> this<00:04:27.140> superhero<00:04:27.530> from<00:04:27.710> scratch

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.010 
creating this superhero from scratch

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:29.470 
creating this superhero from scratch
which<00:04:28.280> is<00:04:28.400> essentially<00:04:28.790> actually<00:04:29.180> what<00:04:29.270> I<00:04:29.300> am

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:29.480 
which is essentially actually what I am

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.330 
which is essentially actually what I am
doing<00:04:29.720> you'd<00:04:30.710> probably<00:04:30.919> want<00:04:31.160> to<00:04:31.190> use<00:04:31.250> a

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
doing you'd probably want to use a

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:34.020 
doing you'd probably want to use a
pencil<00:04:32.030> to<00:04:32.360> design<00:04:33.080> your<00:04:33.230> early<00:04:33.470> sketches

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030 
pencil to design your early sketches
