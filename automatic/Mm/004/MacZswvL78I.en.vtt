 she's just going to talk about the sun 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:45.570
 this book tells the story of a 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:51.420
 city is a world completely created 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:01:04.979
 by the completely new author and several 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:01:10.049
 stories for example to the day and in full 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:12.150
 and absolute in their god are they 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:16.560
 this city and on the other hand are 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:19.340
 all within the council of 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:23.130
 of the religious council of this 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:27.180
 town are people who do not care 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:30.869
 with the twelve people who come with a 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:33.020
 threat or blasphemy and want to be 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:36.390
 eliminate the 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:40.310
 take away the anxiety that dominates the 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.310
 empire in a gigantic 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:49.320
 in another point of history 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:55.740
 we will find that you are also with 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:57.000
 great general to take the city to 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:01.860
 he 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:04.320
 so is the king of all this clear empire 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.390
 there are also some 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.670
 other things that happen in other 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:12.570
 stories that are for just a few 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:15.390
 characters and that this book is very good 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:19.890
 It's the book as four stars but it's not 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:27.600
 perfect but he is very well created 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:30.780
 well-founded universe and not 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:36.209
 I'm a scenario and characters 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:41.250
 for example the hierarchy system 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:44.190
 the person has all the vocabulary too 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:51.600
 extremely intense when you read a 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:54.420
 you really do not in the world 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:03:05.160
 something that looks like some 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:09.470
 modifications and made a history of 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:12.390
 a little fantasy and a few more days 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:14.070
 really feels like it's another world is 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.840
 another planet another culture 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:18.510
 totally different has nothing to do 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.580
 with that then all this part of the magic 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:28.019
 It is also very well created and very 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:30.180
 convincing and book the story is with 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:31.709
 several things happening you accompany 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.220
 the point of view of various characters 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:34.220
 many different 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.299
 It was very fast. 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:49.829
 the characters do not have very well 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:56.250
 defined and they are stable for example 

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:58.510
 her all the time 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:01.180
 that image 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:03.370
 which follows the orders of the people said 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.180
 a calm person a person as soon as 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.819
 has the power 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:08.680
 absurdly large is very strong is 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:11.980
 very powerful but are not aware of 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:15.640
 of this still others say to her 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:17.829
 but out of nowhere and a chapter she 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.840
 shows extremely strong and determined 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:22.320
 ends with everyone and then comes back 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.320
 that person 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:05:28.919
 I also found the book a little run 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:36.940
 Book problem still pound and now 

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:40.210
 will start with the second book it goes 

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:46.139
 continue with the same characters and 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:49.349
 It will end then but I still think 

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:49.349
 that does not 

00:05:50.669 --> 00:06:05.310
 the 500-page book that one of the reasons 

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:05.310
 was this characters mobility 

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:15.350
 and speaking that they expected something similar 

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:17.810
 one of the thrones because there is a 

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:21.050
 martin weale statement on cape 

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:22.520
 book does not follow at the same time that it is 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:24.080
 similar in some respects is 

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:26.780
 completely different from others and 

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:28.070
 others where it was from the thrones we have 

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:29.750
 a medieval story 

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:32.270
 here we do not have a medieval history 

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:34.400
 neither modern nor anything here is a world 

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:36.110
 totally different is the world by 

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:38.270
 example the cars and took with her are 

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:40.340
 invoked as several of a neighbor but 

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:43.400
 there is technology that we have and they 

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:50.090
 do not have any electronic for example is 

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:54.320
 not generating 10 of their magic is through 

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:55.970
 power of war you will find each 

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:59.390
 sword cover but you will not find 

00:06:55.970 --> 00:07:00.950
 also a medieval war is well this 

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:04.580
 I really spoke is an era that people 

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:09.350
 she is not a modern genius. 

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:14.270
 one is from the book the continuation is not 

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:18.200
 official but I found news on the 

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:25.880
 internet that will be coming out in july now 

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:28.640
 in the second semester by law to respond 

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:33.320
 to which it was foreseen that if everything 

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:39.020
 certain will continue then semester 

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:42.980
 It is then the book I recommend more 

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:46.880
 look also because it can if you do not 

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:50.000
 like and I really liked 

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:53.300
 maybe well maybe it might even be 

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:57.380
 the top 10 this year 

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:59.150
 I recommend many drawings book see 

00:07:57.380 --> 00:08:03.620
 if you agree 

00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:05.330
 I like it although it is very 

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:09.050
 this is not like the 

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:11.060
 marketing is and I think that 's it for 

00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:12.590
 You liked the comments more 

00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:15.639
 I liked it down here. 

00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:15.639
 about to take
