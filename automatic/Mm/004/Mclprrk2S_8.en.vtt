00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
week so I think it's going to be pretty

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.400 
week so I think it's going to be pretty
good<00:00:23.340> game<00:00:23.490> mode<00:00:23.699> I<00:00:23.730> think<00:00:24.000> um<00:00:24.240> now<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:25.230> whole

good game mode I think um now the whole
search<00:00:25.619> destroy<00:00:25.859> factor<00:00:26.400> is<00:00:26.460> going<00:00:26.580> to<00:00:26.640> be

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
search destroy factor is going to be

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.230 
search destroy factor is going to be
pretty<00:00:26.910> nice<00:00:27.529> actually<00:00:28.529> I<00:00:29.310> put<00:00:29.670> on<00:00:29.760> my<00:00:29.849> UAV

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
pretty nice actually I put on my UAV

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.690 
pretty nice actually I put on my UAV
there<00:00:30.480> anything<00:00:31.260> yeah<00:00:31.830> so<00:00:32.099> searching<00:00:32.309> choice

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
there anything yeah so searching choice

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.760 
there anything yeah so searching choice
I<00:00:33.090> didn't<00:00:33.809> really<00:00:33.930> like<00:00:34.170> it<00:00:34.200> that<00:00:34.350> much<00:00:34.469> in

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
I didn't really like it that much in

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.840 
I didn't really like it that much in
call<00:00:34.920> of<00:00:34.950> duty<00:00:35.070> but<00:00:35.460> you<00:00:36.390> know<00:00:36.510> you<00:00:36.989> never<00:00:37.020> know

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.850 
call of duty but you know you never know

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.060 
call of duty but you know you never know
metal<00:00:38.850> water<00:00:39.000> could<00:00:39.390> be<00:00:39.510> a<00:00:39.540> lot<00:00:39.690> better<00:00:40.040> so<00:00:41.040> I

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
metal water could be a lot better so I

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.260 
metal water could be a lot better so I
think<00:00:41.160> it's<00:00:41.399> like<00:00:41.550> I<00:00:41.730> think<00:00:41.940> that's<00:00:42.059> just

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
think it's like I think that's just

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.700 
think it's like I think that's just
something<00:00:42.420> like<00:00:42.600> four<00:00:42.870> minutes<00:00:43.079> a<00:00:43.260> match<00:00:43.469> or

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
something like four minutes a match or

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.950 
something like four minutes a match or
something<00:00:43.890> so<00:00:44.129> that's<00:00:44.280> pretty<00:00:44.430> quick<00:00:44.760> um<00:00:45.059> the

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
something so that's pretty quick um the

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.810 
something so that's pretty quick um the
new<00:00:46.110> mouse<00:00:46.289> they've<00:00:46.800> got<00:00:47.010> for<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.340> cave<00:00:47.579> one

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
new mouse they've got for the cave one

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.299 
new mouse they've got for the cave one
level<00:00:48.480> I<00:00:48.719> reckon<00:00:49.590> that's<00:00:49.770> going<00:00:49.980> to<00:00:50.039> be<00:00:50.129> pretty

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
level I reckon that's going to be pretty

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.630 
level I reckon that's going to be pretty
good<00:00:50.670> and<00:00:51.949> I'll<00:00:52.949> be<00:00:53.070> sure<00:00:53.250> to<00:00:53.370> bring<00:00:53.460> you<00:00:53.610> a

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.670 
this is the second time I've awful odor
this<00:02:04.860> gameplay<00:02:05.100> because<00:02:05.430> I<00:02:06.320> uploaded<00:02:07.320> it<00:02:07.500> the

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
this gameplay because I uploaded it the

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.219 
this gameplay because I uploaded it the
other<00:02:07.770> day<00:02:08.039> and<00:02:08.399> you<00:02:09.360> know<00:02:09.479> it<00:02:09.660> really<00:02:09.840> was<00:02:10.110> not

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
other day and you know it really was not

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.760 
other day and you know it really was not
good

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
good

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.140 
good
because<00:02:11.980> I<00:02:12.100> didn't<00:02:12.370> really<00:02:12.520> check<00:02:12.730> through<00:02:13.000> it

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
because I didn't really check through it

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:14.550 
because I didn't really check through it
you<00:02:13.300> know<00:02:13.390> check<00:02:13.720> if<00:02:13.840> it<00:02:13.930> was<00:02:14.020> any<00:02:14.140> good<00:02:14.230> and

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
you know check if it was any good and

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.430 
you know check if it was any good and
this<00:02:14.650> was<00:02:14.860> terrible<00:02:15.250> so<00:02:15.930> and<00:02:16.930> I<00:02:17.020> decided<00:02:17.290> to

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
this was terrible so and I decided to

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.860 
this was terrible so and I decided to
redo<00:02:17.740> it<00:02:17.860> and<00:02:18.040> yeah<00:02:18.760> hope<00:02:19.030> hopefully<00:02:19.480> this<00:02:19.750> was

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
redo it and yeah hope hopefully this was

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:25.920 
redo it and yeah hope hopefully this was
a<00:02:19.900> bit<00:02:20.080> better<00:02:22.860> this<00:02:23.860> gameplay<00:02:24.130> I<00:02:24.840> you<00:02:25.840> know

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
a bit better this gameplay I you know

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.230 
a bit better this gameplay I you know
have<00:02:26.080> a<00:02:26.140> bit<00:02:26.260> of<00:02:26.290> unlucky<00:02:26.650> streak<00:02:26.950> at<00:02:27.190> early<00:02:28.090> on

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.240 
have a bit of unlucky streak at early on

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.990 
have a bit of unlucky streak at early on
but<00:02:28.530> things<00:02:29.530> do<00:02:29.680> improve<00:02:29.980> later<00:02:30.520> on<00:02:30.730> you<00:02:30.940> know

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
but things do improve later on you know

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.630 
but things do improve later on you know

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
I get a nice score chain and as I got

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.310 
I get a nice score chain and as I got
dies<00:02:33.880> I<00:02:33.910> decide<00:02:34.420> I<00:02:34.450> better<00:02:34.810> get<00:02:34.930> the<00:02:35.050> hell<00:02:35.140> out

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:35.320 
dies I decide I better get the hell out

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.140 
dies I decide I better get the hell out
of<00:02:35.350> there<00:02:35.590> you<00:02:36.550> know<00:02:36.610> I<00:02:36.640> had<00:02:36.790> a<00:02:36.820> pretty<00:02:36.940> good

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
of there you know I had a pretty good

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:38.900 
of there you know I had a pretty good
score<00:02:37.420> training<00:02:37.750> it<00:02:37.840> towards<00:02:38.170> the<00:02:38.290> end<00:02:38.440> and

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
score training it towards the end and

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.480 
score training it towards the end and
sniped<00:02:39.910> by<00:02:40.360> the<00:02:40.420> battle<00:02:40.660> rifle<00:02:41.250> which<00:02:42.250> I'm

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:42.490 
sniped by the battle rifle which I'm

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:44.250 
sniped by the battle rifle which I'm
kind<00:02:42.760> of<00:02:42.850> saved<00:02:43.030> my<00:02:43.180> score<00:02:43.450> because<00:02:43.630> you<00:02:44.140> know

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
kind of saved my score because you know

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.440 
kind of saved my score because you know
things<00:02:44.530> weren't<00:02:44.710> looking<00:02:44.860> good<00:02:45.160> at<00:02:45.850> this<00:02:46.150> time

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
things weren't looking good at this time

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.300 
things weren't looking good at this time
with<00:02:46.600> the<00:02:46.690> point<00:02:47.230> at<00:02:47.590> this<00:02:47.770> time<00:02:47.980> of<00:02:48.010> the<00:02:48.160> game

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
with the point at this time of the game

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.640 
with the point at this time of the game
I<00:02:48.370> was<00:02:48.640> thinking<00:02:48.910> you<00:02:49.030> know<00:02:49.090> this<00:02:49.270> is<00:02:49.510> miles<00:02:50.410> to

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
I was thinking you know this is miles to

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.890 
I was thinking you know this is miles to
stop<00:02:50.890> the<00:02:51.010> recording<00:02:51.130> now<00:02:51.580> but<00:02:51.880> you<00:02:52.780> know<00:02:52.870> I

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
stop the recording now but you know I

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.770 
stop the recording now but you know I
usually<00:02:53.380> just<00:02:53.620> keep<00:02:54.130> going<00:02:54.490> stings<00:02:54.880> you<00:02:55.690> know

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
usually just keep going stings you know

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.270 
usually just keep going stings you know
you<00:02:55.840> never<00:02:56.020> know<00:02:56.140> it's<00:02:56.620> not<00:02:56.740> over<00:02:56.800> to<00:02:57.070> the<00:02:57.130> last

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
you never know it's not over to the last

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.840 
you never know it's not over to the last
second<00:02:57.760> so<00:02:58.560> here<00:02:59.560> we<00:02:59.650> go<00:02:59.680> knife<00:03:00.340> kill<00:03:00.610> there

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
second so here we go knife kill there

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:02.790 
second so here we go knife kill there
are<00:03:01.720> you<00:03:01.840> going<00:03:01.990> to<00:03:02.050> notice<00:03:02.320> I<00:03:02.470> keep<00:03:02.650> coming

are you going to notice I keep coming
back<00:03:02.950> to<00:03:03.100> this<00:03:03.220> position<00:03:03.520> of<00:03:03.940> the<00:03:04.060> map<00:03:04.270> that's

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
back to this position of the map that's

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.940 
back to this position of the map that's
because<00:03:05.620> you<00:03:05.950> know<00:03:06.040> this<00:03:06.300> map<00:03:07.500> this<00:03:08.500> Maps

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.740 
because you know this map this Maps
probably<00:03:09.280> my<00:03:09.370> best<00:03:09.520> map<00:03:09.820> and<00:03:10.120> it's<00:03:10.420> probably

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
probably my best map and it's probably

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.250 
probably my best map and it's probably
because<00:03:12.240> I'd<00:03:13.240> like<00:03:13.330> to<00:03:13.540> stay<00:03:13.720> up<00:03:13.840> here<00:03:13.870> a<00:03:14.020> lot

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
someone in here in that building there

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.520 
someone in here in that building there
and<00:03:26.010> that's<00:03:27.010> why<00:03:27.190> I<00:03:27.250> like<00:03:27.520> to<00:03:27.790> go<00:03:27.940> there<00:03:28.120> and<00:03:28.530> as

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
and that's why I like to go there and as

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.320 
and that's why I like to go there and as
you<00:03:29.680> see<00:03:29.920> a<00:03:29.950> bit<00:03:30.370> of<00:03:30.400> a<00:03:30.520> hitmarker<00:03:30.820> there<00:03:31.120> so<00:03:31.300> I

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:31.330 
you see a bit of a hitmarker there so I

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.620 
you see a bit of a hitmarker there so I
decided<00:03:31.690> I<00:03:31.870> better<00:03:31.990> get<00:03:32.170> out<00:03:32.350> of<00:03:32.380> there<00:03:33.630> I

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 
decided I better get out of there I

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:39.510 
decided I better get out of there I
really<00:03:35.590> like<00:03:35.770> the<00:03:35.890> spa<00:03:36.100> the<00:03:36.160> map<00:03:38.070> it's<00:03:39.070> too

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:39.520 
really like the spa the map it's too

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.030 
really like the spa the map it's too
interesting<00:03:40.030> entrances<00:03:40.770> actually<00:03:41.770> three

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
interesting entrances actually three

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.660 
interesting entrances actually three
intereses<00:03:42.810> three<00:03:43.810> entrances<00:03:44.080> and<00:03:44.530> I<00:03:45.130> think

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
intereses three entrances and I think

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.130 
intereses three entrances and I think
the<00:03:45.790> knife<00:03:46.000> actually<00:03:46.450> hit<00:03:46.570> the<00:03:46.600> wall<00:03:46.870> their

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140 
the knife actually hit the wall their

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.560 
the knife actually hit the wall their
home<00:03:47.459> well<00:03:48.459> either<00:03:48.580> that<00:03:48.730> or<00:03:48.910> just<00:03:49.090> didn't

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:49.570 
home well either that or just didn't

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:53.100 
home well either that or just didn't
work<00:03:50.040> just<00:03:51.040> kind<00:03:51.250> of<00:03:51.310> hit<00:03:51.459> the<00:03:51.580> wall<00:03:51.870> so<00:03:52.870> this

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:53.110 
work just kind of hit the wall so this

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:54.960
