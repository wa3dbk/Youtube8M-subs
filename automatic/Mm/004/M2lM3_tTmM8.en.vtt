00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 Hello dear friends, it's time 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.200
 tell you about free games 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.740
 published on the playstation plus subscription 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.740
 July month 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:16.330
 The first game on the list is called 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:20.470
 mouse craft and the plot of the game is 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:22.540
 that some kind of learned cat put some 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:25.660
 experiments on mice using at the same time 

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:29.680
 cheese and in his only moment 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:33.330
 ended the loot and he started looking 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:35.830
 sponsors still found this sponsor 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:38.650
 the experiments continued in principle 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:41.290
 the game itself is normal but fig 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:43.659
 is that this is essentially 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:45.940
 play mobile any cell phone 

00:00:43.659 --> 00:00:49.080
 can a similar group pull without 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:52.960
 any straining and other things and it is us 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:55.570
 spread on ps vita ps3 and ps4 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:59.440
 Well, just stunned though in itself 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:01.750
 quite interesting igrulya next 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:05.110
 the game we have is called and wine 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:07.180
 what does the translation mean entwined in 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:10.270
 Generally this is the tale of two here such here 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:12.250
 birds that need to swim I do n't even know 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:15.159
 fly in a circle that is you 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:17.109
 there are some circles and you should 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:17.649
 fly special connectors in these 

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:19.840
 mugs 

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:21.850
 plays honestly the same as in 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.820
 one of my past issues for 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.829
 artists and created by artists then 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:29.170
 have you understood me this game at all 

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:32.829
 I did not like it but this is your personal opinion 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:36.609
 and I think that on the road this game will be 

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:39.159
 Well, I do not know will be able to brighten up a little 

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:41.649
 time if you have ps have ps vita 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:44.649
 but in this case I can say it 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:48.729
 which is the same as with the previous one 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:51.429
 playing and it could well be on 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:56.159
 no mobile devices but no 

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:56.159
 it is on ps vita ps3 and ps4 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:02.770
 and the first game in our turn 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:05.229
 called rocket leagues it I don't know maybe 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:09.090
 be you saw the release of the top gir where there 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:11.290
 jeremy clarkson and oh friends staged 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.940
 car football that's it too 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.980
 most just a little more dynamic 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:18.849
 Harder and because here you can 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:21.400
 push and in general goals the same 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:24.430
 score this big ball to the opponent in 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.959
 gate naturally my first match 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.629
 I blew in, and in general 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:30.370
 ordinary football is not very fond of what 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:35.200
 talking machine on road 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:37.180
 football but the game against this reluctance 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.430
 playing football in general seemed to me 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.860
 I am quite dynamic enough of course 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.690
 not fully mastered but the dynamics in the game 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.579
 present you can probably see 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.730
 how is everything going fast enough 

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:51.130
 no big enough field 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.540
 no limits running and running 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.790
 walls can ride 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.549
 accelerated ki to include in general the game 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:03:00.069
 quite dynamic and advise 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:03.850
 The next game in the queue is called 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:06.430
 stix and the game tells the story of a goblin or 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:09.400
 orcs well rather goblin who went 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:12.310
 against the system before you start playing 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:15.579
 I watched from about 10 minutes of video 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:18.489
 it was very much very tedious and after 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:20.769
 this is actually the game itself and I started 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:24.040
 not personally impressed 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:27.250
 passed to and this game is available on 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:31.209
 ps4 but the graph he is so miserable that 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:34.420
 it feels like it hit 2010 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:37.239
 but in general, people who like 3d 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:40.630
 action platformer and i think those people 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:42.819
 like it and in general I think that 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:45.250
 same run in this game but most likely 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:47.790
 I personally will only run in it from 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.790
 nothing to do 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:53.659
 and the last game in our today's 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:56.720
 the list is called rain that translates 

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:59.329
 the rain in the general plot of the game is the boy 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.970
 suddenly dies of fever and 

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:04.909
 gets here in such a ghost world in 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:08.060
 which can only be seen in the rain as 

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:10.310
 only you say so hiding under 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:12.319
 some kind of roof of you right there becomes no 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:14.540
 seen and you do not see the boy and you 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:15.200
 yourself though you play for this 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:17.120
 boy 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:20.209
 itself a game to me in general 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:22.669
 I liked it atmospheric 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:24.919
 some story the boy is constantly chasing 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:26.840
 for a girl it is not clear why because I 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:29.180
 did not pass before this moment when 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:32.690
 it will be clear but in general the game 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:35.449
 really not bad grafon so-so 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:37.220
 in general, this game is not about grafon 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:39.620
 and in general the visual itself 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:42.110
 component of the game is done so on 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:44.960
 grafon especially not paying attention 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:47.300
 in general, I advise you to pass on 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:49.280
 I have everything today subscribe to 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.830
 channel subscribe to the VKontakte group 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:55.360

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:55.360
 releases bye bye
