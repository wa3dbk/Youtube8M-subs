00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:10.019
 hello there 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.790
 make a video about the sensor which 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.339
 there is on the instrument board now i'm on 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.610
 quick take off and on-board 

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:19.390
 computer 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:23.650
 Immediately for the cause, I'll show you so 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:28.919
 it looks sharpness pointed mean 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.919
 top left right sage this sensor 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:35.270
 this pressure 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:39.350
 engine oil 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:41.410
 engine oil pressure sensor is 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:46.360
 sensor 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:48.489
 engine temperatures left below us 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.340
 the sensor shows the temperature of the box 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:55.930
 transmissions here we have a sensor that 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:01:01.600
 shows the oil temperature tachometer 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:07.180
 the speedometer is divided into two parts aground 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:09.909
 across america and per kilometer across canada 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.890
 metrics means here we have 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:14.920
 such a small chayka is also a window 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:17.979
 shows us the mileage of the car 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.390
 it is generally possible to detect 23 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:22.869
 how many hours did you drive 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:25.380
 worked that day and shows 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:25.380
 amperage 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:32.890
 battery well there are still a couple of setups 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:36.960
 Spring there watch on so on so on 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:40.899
 here we have a fuel sensor 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:43.770
 how many we have just changed the oak 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:49.770
 below here is such a cell adsense spirit 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:54.549
 this is for def df this is cleaning fluid 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:56.409
 to clean the exhaust system can in 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:59.939
 Europe, this is called ara or something like that 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:02.429
 another will assign a little lower 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:09.039
 sensor from 

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:13.150
 main tank maybe your onboard time 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:15.940
 say primers tank that's written this from 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:21.090
 2 secondary air bucks too 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:23.860
 just below it means there is a sensor 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:27.489
 temperatures inside it most from which 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:29.500
 closer to the cabin the car is like two bridges 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:31.959
 and the spirit of two bridges leading behind 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.810
 this is the temperature from inside it to 100 here 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:35.829
 front rer it from the back and it says here 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.190
 temperature too 

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:41.790
 rear axle by and large 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.530
 a bit means switch here 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.510
 light switch 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.879
 here it means the handle for the sink 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.819
 blink light of the far turn on the lights 

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:55.209
 far here on the door we have mean 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:59.829
 adjusting side mirrors close both 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:02.890
 doors on both sides of the window on the steering wheel that u 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:08.900
 it almost means us to include crush 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:11.670
 control speed up undo and 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.560
 how fast cyanide is further here 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:18.540
 have ha native signal 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:21.200
 and that means the main signal that what's up 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:27.129
 here we have it starts with gps 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:29.390
 radio here are two buttons this 

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:30.859
 call a simple phone in Russian 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:34.250
 let's say stop crane and 

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:37.730
 1 means red then turn on the cart 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:42.769
 brake or unplug them and from 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:43.670
 trailer here we mean accident it 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:48.379
 to make 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:51.980
 the brightness of the light on the panel means here 

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:54.609
 light on his feet farther we go 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:57.620
 here are 2 buttons here these two it means 

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:59.510
 mechanical include cleaning system 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:01.299
 exhaust sometimes stay long in place with 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.519
 you are against the engine it is clogged and 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:05.569
 starts to squeak do all sorts 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:09.859
 troubles can generally be cleared 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:12.409
 here means the button for anti scrolling on 

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:13.189
 the snow on the ice there somewhere there do not know 

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:16.070
 this and resumes 

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:18.019
 this means the button starts us from 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:20.539
 lifting so you can be at speed 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:22.400
 let go but here it is traffic lights on 

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:24.440
 lifting the table and you have a couple of seconds 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:28.430
 he take his foot off the brake over put on 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:31.789
 gas does not roll that further us here 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:32.870
 clock with alarm clock is a separate 

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:35.240
 brake 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:39.310
 You can brake the manual trailer if 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.310
 skidding or leveling the car in the snow 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:47.950
 what else am I switching on autonomus here 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:51.040
 heating and air conditioning from here to here 2 

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:53.100
 buttons include outside on stony 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:56.230
 spotlights 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:05:01.810
 then control the air conditioner and so on 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:05.080
 stuff here we have mean so this 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:07.570
 locking it moves the saddle 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:09.790
 back and forth to weight distribute and 

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:12.100
 lower the frame i.e. lower the air 

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:14.850
 air suspension can lie under 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:17.580
 trailer if someone threw off a few 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:20.200
 then there is still a small sensor 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:21.850
 which machine is well - read machine she 

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:24.840
 shows to speed at the moment 

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:26.830
 here you are by the way she herself pen 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:30.460
 can switch 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:33.580
 manual on the machine here means here 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:35.290
 translates reverse drive and low all 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:38.020
 the rest does on automatic or 

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:40.990
 manually on or off it includes 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:43.389
 lowered increased speed here on 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:45.390
 steering we have a transition between functions 

00:05:43.389 --> 00:05:48.720
 that little window, what I said 

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:50.979
 this include 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:52.930
 to brake the engine on 4 as 

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:56.680
 called the game with brothers signs exactly 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:59.710
 in russian thomas engine it means 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:02.860
 the signal can be served as a carotid 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:04.539
 do not do the whole electrical system 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:08.050
 Some problems with not well, just sitting there 

00:06:04.539 --> 00:06:11.080
 someone gave you overtake yourself and gave you 

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:14.530
 call then you can just help 

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:16.300
 all the lights of the cars 

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:22.150
 to big here what I'm saying on 

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:24.370
 work when reading and everything probably I 

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:26.139
 I know, like everyone else will do another 

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:27.820
 movie about it created it will 

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:31.060
 separately but considered it onboard 

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:33.580
 computer hello everyone I hope that 

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:34.389
 answered questions 

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:38.280
 ask 

00:06:34.389 --> 00:06:38.280
 I can answer immediately bye
