00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
will depend on how much moisture comes

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.020 
will depend on how much moisture comes
out<00:02:45.380> of<00:02:45.500> them<00:02:45.650> all<00:02:45.890> mushrooms<00:02:46.370> give<00:02:46.640> off<00:02:46.790> some

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
out of them all mushrooms give off some

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:52.000 
out of them all mushrooms give off some
form<00:02:47.330> of<00:02:47.390> moisture<00:02:50.410> this<00:02:51.410> is<00:02:51.590> what<00:02:51.769> happening

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
form of moisture this is what happening

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:57.340 
form of moisture this is what happening
on<00:02:52.160> fairly<00:02:52.550> high<00:02:52.700> heat<00:02:56.050> now<00:02:57.050> the<00:02:57.110> combination

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
on fairly high heat now the combination

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.500 
on fairly high heat now the combination
of<00:02:57.800> the<00:02:57.950> moisture<00:02:58.430> from<00:02:58.610> the<00:02:58.880> mushrooms<00:02:59.330> and

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
of the moisture from the mushrooms and

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.600 
of the moisture from the mushrooms and
the<00:02:59.750> tomatoes<00:03:00.230> breaking<00:03:00.680> down<00:03:00.890> will<00:03:01.340> give<00:03:01.489> us

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
the tomatoes breaking down will give us

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.460 
the tomatoes breaking down will give us
our<00:03:01.730> sauce<00:03:02.030> we<00:03:02.300> may<00:03:02.780> well<00:03:03.019> have<00:03:03.170> to<00:03:03.230> add<00:03:03.440> a

look now there you go as you can see
some<00:03:17.390> moisture<00:03:17.540> has<00:03:17.900> come<00:03:18.170> out<00:03:18.290> of<00:03:18.410> those

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
some moisture has come out of those

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.900 
some moisture has come out of those
mushrooms<00:03:19.010> as<00:03:19.239> predicted<00:03:20.239> and<00:03:20.450> the<00:03:21.910> tomatoes

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
mushrooms as predicted and the tomatoes

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:24.900 
mushrooms as predicted and the tomatoes
are<00:03:23.060> breaking<00:03:23.570> down<00:03:23.600> really<00:03:24.079> nicely

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910
