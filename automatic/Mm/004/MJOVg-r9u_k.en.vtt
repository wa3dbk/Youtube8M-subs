00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:03.840
 hello my friends with you shamov 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.430
 Dmitriy 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.200
 in this video I want to tell you about 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.719
 one of the features of the Japanese and in general 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.219
 living in japan next apartment not 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.040
 so long ago just a couple of days ago 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.080
 a man moved ie new tenant 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.060
 here and in Japan it is accepted that when 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.210
 a person moves into a new apartment then 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.609
 the nearest apartments are usually on the floor and on 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.449
 apartment and the apartment above and in 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.519
 flat below 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.570
 need to go in and give some 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.920
 gift and here's what you see on the video 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.719
 such a box is what we are 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.620
 got a man came in today 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.420
 Sunday 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.700
 usually comes exactly sunday 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.670
 because people on this day most often 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.840
 do not work at home and presented to us here 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.329
 such a box now we will open it 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.890
 I'll show you that in principle gives such 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.440
 presents 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:52.590
 it's often kid and in this case 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:56.539
 also food is noodles food should be a scene 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:59.070
 somewhere 2000 may be ent because 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:01.440
 more expensive gift no sense to give 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.879
 but of course depending on who lives where 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.580
 some richer then they of course 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.320
 can give something more expensive well, 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.500
 usually give something not very expensive 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.360
 to spend a little and to 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.970
 the man who was given a gift to him 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.189
 would not be uncomfortable let's take off 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.170
 plenochku I tell you what we exactly 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.540
 gave 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:23.009
 just so you know all of a sudden you will move 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.790
 in Japan it will be necessary to someone 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.790
 give something 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.600
 So 

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:44.520
 you can see here you see this 

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:46.079
 here is noodles, too, open the sea yes I 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.439
 I think that in Russia hardly anyone gives 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.849
 I 'm going to someone 

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:55.020
 each in separate peace I think that 

00:01:50.849 --> 00:02:00.299
 there is such a noodle after all just two 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:03.390
 thousand gene may be a little less and this 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:05.849
 noodles called the sum of it is eaten cold 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:09.810
 usually in summer because summer is still on 

00:02:05.849 --> 00:02:12.260
 the street is very hot is made special 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:15.810
 soup and in cold form e100 the whole thing 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:17.430
 here this person will also be now 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.440
 walk in the neighboring apartments and also 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.530
 give them some gifts and often 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.959
 I am given the same set and all 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.209
 people are different things because the neighbors are already 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:28.319
 sometimes between communicate and talk 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.930
 about who got what 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:32.940
 and so that there were some topics for 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.859
 Talk often give either the same 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.380
 there for example , this is such a noodle 

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:39.030
 something else may also be a different kind 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.400
 there may be some fruit and 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.859
 so by the way fruit 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.889
 are very popular and if 

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:48.780
 you are from another country for example like me then 

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:51.079
 when moving to give what 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.069
 souvenirs of my country so I gave 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:54.720
 nesting dolls and all sorts 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:58.919
 Russian sweets when I moved to 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:00.930
 the apartment is still previous so when 

00:02:58.919 --> 00:03:01.470
 You will come to Japan 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.480
 move 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.099
 not in a dorm of course you can it 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.019
 it is not necessary to do but in my own 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:10.200
 the apartment can be removable then 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:12.599
 be sure to think about it and also 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:16.010
 buy something and neighbors and this 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:18.690
 will allow to establish some kind of relationship here 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.639

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.650
