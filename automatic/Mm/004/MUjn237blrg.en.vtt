little<00:00:53.969> foam<00:00:54.210> spacers<00:00:54.780> it<00:00:55.559> kind<00:00:55.800> of<00:00:55.829> helps<00:00:56.100> it

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
little foam spacers it kind of helps it

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.709 
little foam spacers it kind of helps it
on<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.489> hard<00:00:56.940> landings<00:00:57.329> a<00:00:57.420> little<00:00:57.629> bit

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
on the hard landings a little bit

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.920 
on the hard landings a little bit
softens<00:00:58.530> a<00:00:58.590> little<00:00:58.770> bit<00:00:59.180> yeah<00:01:00.180> this<00:01:00.390> is<00:01:00.570> a<00:01:00.600> fun

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
softens a little bit yeah this is a fun

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.130 
softens a little bit yeah this is a fun
fly<00:01:01.550> maybe<00:01:02.550> indoor<00:01:03.030> if<00:01:03.390> you<00:01:03.570> got<00:01:03.690> a<00:01:03.719> big<00:01:03.899> open

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
fly maybe indoor if you got a big open

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.750 
fly maybe indoor if you got a big open
area<00:01:05.659> it's<00:01:06.659> great<00:01:07.290> if<00:01:07.500> you're<00:01:07.860> you<00:01:08.670> know

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
area it's great if you're you know

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.300 
area it's great if you're you know
practicing<00:01:09.330> hovering<00:01:09.750> at<00:01:09.930> eye<00:01:10.130> high<00:01:11.130> this

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
practicing hovering at eye high this

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.060 
practicing hovering at eye high this
might<00:01:11.520> I'm<00:01:12.060> not<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.570> best<00:01:12.780> at<00:01:12.930> flying<00:01:13.680> some<00:01:13.979> of

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
might I'm not the best at flying some of

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.820 
might I'm not the best at flying some of
these<00:01:14.159> and<00:01:14.400> so<00:01:14.520> this<00:01:15.299> is<00:01:15.509> if<00:01:15.960> I<00:01:16.140> can<00:01:16.320> fly<00:01:16.500> it<00:01:16.560> I

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
these and so this is if I can fly it I

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:17.960 
these and so this is if I can fly it I
mean<00:01:17.100> I've<00:01:17.220> spent<00:01:17.340> a<00:01:17.490> little<00:01:17.580> time<00:01:17.759> on<00:01:17.939> a

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
mean I've spent a little time on a

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.200 
mean I've spent a little time on a
simulator<00:01:18.619> but<00:01:19.619> then<00:01:19.890> it's<00:01:20.490> it's<00:01:20.790> pretty<00:01:21.000> good

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
simulator but then it's it's pretty good

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.170 
simulator but then it's it's pretty good
it's<00:01:21.360> not<00:01:21.479> as<00:01:21.600> scary<00:01:21.990> as<00:01:22.200> flying<00:01:22.500> like<00:01:22.770> a<00:01:23.180> $700

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
it's not as scary as flying like a $700

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.910 
it's not as scary as flying like a $700
helicopter<00:01:24.689> that<00:01:24.810> you<00:01:24.930> could<00:01:25.080> crash<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:25.619> feel

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
helicopter that you could crash and feel

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.310 
helicopter that you could crash and feel
terrible<00:01:26.280> if<00:01:26.369> you<00:01:26.430> had<00:01:26.580> destroyed<00:01:26.850> everything

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
terrible if you had destroyed everything

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.620 
terrible if you had destroyed everything
the<00:01:28.320> few<00:01:29.189> few<00:01:29.549> things<00:01:29.909> about<00:01:30.060> this<00:01:30.360> the

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
the few few things about this the

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.060 
the few few things about this the
battery<00:01:30.840> when<00:01:31.259> I<00:01:31.290> first<00:01:31.530> got<00:01:31.710> it

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
battery when I first got it

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.219 
battery when I first got it
this<00:01:32.430> is<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.670> batter<00:01:33.270> that<00:01:33.479> came<00:01:33.630> with<00:01:33.810> it<00:01:33.840> it

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
this is the batter that came with it it

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.929 
this is the batter that came with it it
didn't<00:01:34.770> it<00:01:34.920> wasn't<00:01:35.009> strong<00:01:35.400> enough<00:01:35.460> for<00:01:35.700> this

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
didn't it wasn't strong enough for this

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.969 
didn't it wasn't strong enough for this
thing<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.240> stay<00:01:36.540> off<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:36.840> ground<00:01:37.020> when<00:01:37.920> I

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
thing to stay off the ground when I

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.440 
thing to stay off the ground when I
first<00:01:38.250> bought<00:01:38.430> this<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:40.280> it<00:01:41.280> it<00:01:41.700> spun<00:01:42.240> the

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
first bought this the it it spun the

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.940 
first bought this the it it spun the
helicopter<00:01:43.110> but<00:01:43.229> it's<00:01:43.320> just<00:01:43.380> enough<00:01:43.770> power

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
helicopter but it's just enough power

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.030 
helicopter but it's just enough power
and<00:01:44.130> then<00:01:44.430> after<00:01:44.700> five<00:01:44.970> cycles<00:01:45.390> of<00:01:46.040> charging

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
and then after five cycles of charging

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.340 
and then after five cycles of charging
it<00:01:47.130> running<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:47.790> battery<00:01:48.119> down<00:01:48.270> this<00:01:49.140> thing

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
it running the battery down this thing

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:50.840 
it running the battery down this thing
started<00:01:49.649> to<00:01:49.680> get<00:01:49.799> a<00:01:49.829> lot<00:01:49.979> stronger<00:01:50.280> the

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
started to get a lot stronger the

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.080 
started to get a lot stronger the
battery<00:01:51.240> and<00:01:51.590> now<00:01:52.590> you<00:01:53.280> know<00:01:53.700> I<00:01:53.729> get<00:01:53.880> about<00:01:54.060> a

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
battery and now you know I get about a

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
one thing that happens when I fly this

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.530 
one thing that happens when I fly this
in<00:02:19.650> the<00:02:19.740> wind<00:02:19.920> is<00:02:20.130> I<00:02:20.370> don't<00:02:21.090> have<00:02:21.180> you<00:02:21.240> can<00:02:21.360> see

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
this little piece here it's this little

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.630 
this little piece here it's this little
swashplate<00:02:24.200> disconnects<00:02:25.200> and<00:02:25.920> if<00:02:26.400> you<00:02:26.490> watch

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
swashplate disconnects and if you watch

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.550 
swashplate disconnects and if you watch
the<00:02:26.820> video<00:02:27.060> the<00:02:27.330> last<00:02:27.540> 10<00:02:27.960> seconds<00:02:28.380> of<00:02:28.530> the

the video the last 10 seconds of the

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.570 
the video the last 10 seconds of the
video<00:02:29.000> I<00:02:30.050> had<00:02:31.050> I<00:02:31.080> lost<00:02:31.230> control<00:02:31.650> of<00:02:31.830> it<00:02:32.010> because

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
video I had I lost control of it because

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.330 
video I had I lost control of it because
of<00:02:32.730> this<00:02:32.880> came<00:02:33.180> apart<00:02:33.480> and<00:02:33.680> i<00:02:34.680> had<00:02:34.830> to<00:02:35.040> just

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
of this came apart and i had to just

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.220 
of this came apart and i had to just
land<00:02:35.940> this<00:02:36.120> as<00:02:36.300> quick<00:02:36.480> as<00:02:36.600> I<00:02:36.690> could<00:02:36.750> because<00:02:37.110> I

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
land this as quick as I could because I

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:38.870 
land this as quick as I could because I
couldn't<00:02:37.680> fly<00:02:38.220> it<00:02:38.280> anymore

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
couldn't fly it anymore

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.030 
couldn't fly it anymore
but<00:02:39.180> you<00:02:39.450> know<00:02:39.570> it<00:02:39.690> didn't<00:02:40.290> crash<00:02:40.530> I<00:02:40.830> just

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
but you know it didn't crash I just

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.070 
but you know it didn't crash I just
wasn't<00:02:41.940> able<00:02:42.090> to<00:02:42.240> get<00:02:42.360> to<00:02:42.420> go<00:02:42.600> forward<00:02:42.960> or

these<00:02:45.480> tail<00:02:45.900> blades<00:02:46.230> break<00:02:46.560> easy<00:02:46.800> if<00:02:47.160> you<00:02:47.430> hit

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
these tail blades break easy if you hit

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.630 
these tail blades break easy if you hit
the<00:02:48.000> ground<00:02:48.270> or<00:02:48.570> hit<00:02:48.750> hit<00:02:49.590> like<00:02:49.920> you<00:02:50.070> back<00:02:50.280> into

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
the ground or hit hit like you back into

the ground or hit hit like you back into
a<00:02:50.670> building<00:02:51.030> or<00:02:51.300> something<00:02:51.540> I<00:02:51.900> don't<00:02:52.200> know<00:02:52.260> if

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
a building or something I don't know if

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.380 
a building or something I don't know if
these<00:02:52.950> hit<00:02:53.160> anything<00:02:53.370> they<00:02:53.640> break<00:02:53.880> I've<00:02:54.209> gone

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
these hit anything they break I've gone

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.420 
these hit anything they break I've gone
through<00:02:54.450> two<00:02:54.780> of<00:02:54.810> them<00:02:55.020> already<00:02:55.250> and<00:02:56.250> this

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
through two of them already and this

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.460 
through two of them already and this
doesn't<00:02:56.760> come<00:02:56.910> with<00:02:57.090> a<00:02:57.120> spare<00:02:57.510> tail<00:02:58.020> blade<00:02:58.260> so

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
doesn't come with a spare tail blade so

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.080 
doesn't come with a spare tail blade so
if<00:02:58.590> you<00:02:58.709> do<00:02:58.830> get<00:02:59.010> this<00:02:59.190> helicopter<00:02:59.550> I'd

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
if you do get this helicopter I'd

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:01.960 
if you do get this helicopter I'd
recommend<00:03:00.870> getting<00:03:00.990> a<00:03:01.140> bunch<00:03:01.320> of<00:03:01.440> spares

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
recommend getting a bunch of spares

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.100 
recommend getting a bunch of spares
overall<00:03:02.970> I'd<00:03:03.090> give<00:03:03.240> this<00:03:03.360> a<00:03:03.510> thumbs<00:03:03.690> up<00:03:03.959> I

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
overall I'd give this a thumbs up I

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.650 
overall I'd give this a thumbs up I
thought<00:03:04.230> it<00:03:04.320> was<00:03:04.410> a<00:03:04.440> lot<00:03:04.560> of<00:03:04.590> fun<00:03:04.830> I<00:03:05.760> might<00:03:06.390> take

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
thought it was a lot of fun I might take

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.630 
thought it was a lot of fun I might take
the<00:03:06.840> blame<00:03:07.080> myself<00:03:07.320> is<00:03:07.860> I'm<00:03:08.160> flying<00:03:08.400> this

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
the blame myself is I'm flying this

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.900 
the blame myself is I'm flying this
thing<00:03:08.820> in<00:03:09.000> you<00:03:09.540> know<00:03:09.660> 35<00:03:10.190> 35<00:03:11.190> degree<00:03:11.520> weather

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
thing in you know 35 35 degree weather

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.240 
thing in you know 35 35 degree weather
so<00:03:12.660> this<00:03:12.870> prop<00:03:13.140> this<00:03:13.320> plastic<00:03:13.770> probably<00:03:14.100> just

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
so this prop this plastic probably just

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.000 
so this prop this plastic probably just
isn't<00:03:14.520> designed<00:03:14.820> to<00:03:15.120> fly<00:03:15.900> and<00:03:16.140> cold<00:03:16.380> maybe<00:03:16.860> you

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
isn't designed to fly and cold maybe you

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.610 
isn't designed to fly and cold maybe you
got<00:03:17.130> to<00:03:17.220> fly<00:03:17.400> it<00:03:17.459> in<00:03:17.700> 70<00:03:18.540> degree<00:03:18.810> weather<00:03:18.840> then

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
got to fly it in 70 degree weather then

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.770 
got to fly it in 70 degree weather then
you<00:03:19.650> wouldn't<00:03:19.920> have<00:03:19.980> the<00:03:20.130> problem<00:03:20.459> but<00:03:21.269> yeah
