00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.420
 Hello my dear friends and 

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:07.300
 Welcome here today to a small one 

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:09.010
 Let's talk to the light hello we have 

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:10.950
 today again five things in 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:13.330
 clevelands that used to be different 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.299
 and I would say that lifted directly 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:17.800
 at the beginning with the first fact so come 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:20.110
 we're in fact one and that's about it 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:23.529
 the barracks used to be what you for 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:25.720
 20 james a single barracks for four 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:27.250
 It could give you hours to boost 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.529
 post in the classic clans before the 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.539
 Now here so show and then 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:34.000
 Some people have complained that 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:36.130
 these four hours just way too much 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.720
 are long and well thought of 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:40.149
 how to simply halve the jam 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:42.550
 prices and of course the time 

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:44.500
 to do this now costs a barracks lead 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.809
 two hours boost exactly ten james that 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.030
 All four barracks means 40 yams earlier 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:50.590
 were it then just 80 also what 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.329
 earlier so if a maintenance break 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.280
 any servers work or 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:55.329
 Other news then we just that 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.270
 have interrupted play 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:59.620
 came that the bus then simply 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:01.629
 continued to run and after this 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.610
 Maintenance break should then say 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:06.009
 my hour have taken that yes 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.060
 bus then just ran out and even 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:09.009
 not quite fair 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.420
 I actually do really really 

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:12.549
 above all , it is hardworking at all 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.889
 legally okay that were paid for what 

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:16.090
 because simon and then she is gone me 

00:01:14.889 --> 00:01:17.799
 think so do not think so 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.920
 which then also tightened and now can 

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:23.049
 the barracks the gad blew it 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.719
 then continue with the boost if that 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:27.700
 update was made 

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:29.049
 so come now fakt only two namely 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.659
 it is now the troops request 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:32.919
 The whole thing was so you could 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:34.419
 ask troops and you could 

00:01:32.919 --> 00:01:36.549
 no text to be a suitable 

00:01:34.419 --> 00:01:39.069
 I could not type in here now 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:40.569
 wants us mario what I know 

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:42.009
 you had to ask the request and 

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:44.079
 could then chat through the normal 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:47.499
 History type what you wanted 

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:48.520
 was stupid because then super the time I 

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:49.810
 do not know if it's any complaints 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.179
 gave or so but then they noticed 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.829
 okay that's stupid to always leave it that way - 

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:55.450
 and which was then introduced 

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:56.950
 It used to be that way in the past 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.899
 a lot of wrong donations were made 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.899
 And that was so nice 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:03.700
 fixed so then we come already to 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:05.380
 third fact and that is about in the 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.929
 steal news because you are here on the 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.969
 small i presses and then here at the one 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:10.539
 one can clearly see a message 

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:12.370
 write 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:13.660
 to the people so what do I know 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.610
 to issue any orders 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.320
 tell everyone what to do with the small-scale war 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.020
 should or otherwise earlier there was that 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.340
 not all that means it is one 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.510
 little chaos prevailed especially in 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.540
 clear or other things 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.710
 after no one really does 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.510
 could not be online with each other 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:30.100
 could communicate and they have 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.750
 then introduced with an update and 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.650
 then he too became the news 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.690
 introduced 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.640
 yes then would be now at fact number four 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.920
 and it is now about the mines and 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.210
 the collectors used to be the same 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.820
 you've been looking for an enemy you have 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:45.100
 Just get blood on it okay 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:46.120
 many katrin were on it for example 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.590
 the collectors watched and the goods 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.960
 just empty that means they were 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.980
 appropriate 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:53.500
 meanwhile it is so silly it recognizes 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.150
 and say you look right at the 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.310
 goldmine there is gold in it and im 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.180
 alexian collectors are just me 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.220
 simply exile fin 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.990
 yes and petterweil is just that helps 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.730
 at the farm you know where the loaded 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:05.560
 drinliegt you know where you when you out of it 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:09.490
 Bring it can be just about anything just 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.870
 advantage of the model and so taken then 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:12.460
 we come already to the last clock 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.830
 for today and that is about the 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:16.780
 Donated troops used to be 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:18.130
 that was not displayed when going on 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.940
 the sound clicked or at 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.160
 his profile 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.870
 who donated how many troops that 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.580
 I did not have a mouse 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.410
 Many people have known then 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.390
 just never donated anything 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:29.740
 all the time asked and so you could 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:32.950
 just do not control it now 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:35.740
 is relatively well regulated that the clear 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:38.200
 leader sees a good 1000 troops requested 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:40.270
 but now donated ten then I get 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.910
 the first time you could do that 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:44.260
 not so that what with in 56 for 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.110
 today they should have liked each other 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.250
 Both of us would like to agree 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:49.330
 effect to go and so slowly out of that 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.310
 You should still have some 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:53.290
 nice in the comments so maybe 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.790
 is still a fifth episode 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.100
 so promising with incredible beautiful 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:59.220
 Seeing people until then , then do it 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.220
 Well
