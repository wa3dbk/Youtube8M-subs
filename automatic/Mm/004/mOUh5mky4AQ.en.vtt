working 15 years as a full-time teacher
I<00:00:15.350> basically<00:00:16.350> I<00:00:16.770> wanted<00:00:17.670> to<00:00:18.410> skill<00:00:19.410> up<00:00:19.439> in

sports nutrition supplements and weight

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.120 
sports nutrition supplements and weight
loss<00:00:23.330> with<00:00:24.330> so<00:00:24.480> many<00:00:24.660> clients<00:00:24.840> interested<00:00:25.619> in

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
loss with so many clients interested in

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.439 
loss with so many clients interested in
this<00:00:26.310> I<00:00:26.460> thought<00:00:26.609> it<00:00:26.670> might<00:00:26.939> actually<00:00:27.060> give<00:00:27.359> me

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
this I thought it might actually give me

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.050 
this I thought it might actually give me
a<00:00:27.480> commercial<00:00:27.990> edge<00:00:28.580> I'm<00:00:29.580> gonna<00:00:29.820> look<00:00:29.910> at

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
a commercial edge I'm gonna look at

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.820 
a commercial edge I'm gonna look at
online<00:00:30.240> courses<00:00:30.900> I<00:00:30.960> could<00:00:31.230> actually<00:00:31.380> fit<00:00:31.679> into

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
online courses I could actually fit into

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.330 
online courses I could actually fit into
my<00:00:32.040> life<00:00:33.440> now<00:00:34.440> obviously<00:00:34.800> if<00:00:34.980> someone<00:00:35.130> who's

my life now obviously if someone who's
written<00:00:35.969> and<00:00:36.300> and<00:00:36.630> taught<00:00:37.380> for<00:00:37.920> 15<00:00:38.879> years<00:00:39.239> I

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
written and and taught for 15 years I

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.240 
written and and taught for 15 years I
was<00:00:39.989> always<00:00:40.140> gonna<00:00:40.320> be<00:00:40.440> quite<00:00:40.620> careful<00:00:40.860> about

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
was always gonna be quite careful about

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.880 
was always gonna be quite careful about
which<00:00:41.460> cars<00:00:41.760> or<00:00:41.969> chose<00:00:42.500> when<00:00:43.500> I<00:00:43.530> came<00:00:43.649> across

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
which cars or chose when I came across

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.729

the<00:00:44.160> Health<00:00:44.340> Sciences<00:00:44.670> Academy<00:00:44.840> I<00:00:45.840> found<00:00:46.649> that

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
the Health Sciences Academy I found that

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.190 
the Health Sciences Academy I found that
they<00:00:46.860> were<00:00:46.890> distinctively<00:00:47.610> different<00:00:48.200> from

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
they were distinctively different from

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.680 
they were distinctively different from
every<00:00:49.410> other<00:00:49.530> college<00:00:49.980> online<00:00:50.579> and<00:00:50.940> that<00:00:51.210> come

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
every other college online and that come

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.930 
every other college online and that come
across<00:00:51.809> and<00:00:52.170> that<00:00:52.260> was<00:00:52.410> quite<00:00:52.590> a<00:00:52.649> lot<00:00:52.980> they

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
across and that was quite a lot they

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.389 
across and that was quite a lot they
really<00:00:53.969> really<00:00:54.539> ticked<00:00:54.780> every<00:00:54.960> box<00:00:55.250> the<00:00:56.250> first

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
really really ticked every box the first

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.430 
really really ticked every box the first
thing<00:00:56.579> I'd<00:00:56.699> like<00:00:56.730> to<00:00:56.910> say<00:00:57.239> is<00:00:57.300> that<00:00:57.750> the

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
thing I'd like to say is that the

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.330 
thing I'd like to say is that the
courses<00:00:58.920> were<00:00:59.039> extremely<00:00:59.489> thorough<00:01:00.170> and

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:01.340 
courses were extremely thorough and

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.009 
courses were extremely thorough and
immediately<00:01:02.340> I<00:01:02.550> felt<00:01:03.000> like<00:01:03.239> I<00:01:03.600> was<00:01:03.870> always

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
immediately I felt like I was always

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.329 
immediately I felt like I was always
going<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.290> have<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.470> confidence<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:04.979> advise

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
going to have the confidence to advise

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.330 
going to have the confidence to advise
clients<00:01:06.080> they<00:01:07.080> were<00:01:07.140> clearly<00:01:07.530> exhaustively

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
clients they were clearly exhaustively

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.020 
clients they were clearly exhaustively
researched<00:01:09.500> there<00:01:10.500> were<00:01:10.590> also<00:01:10.770> links<00:01:11.460> on

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
researched there were also links on

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.240 
researched there were also links on
after<00:01:12.780> every<00:01:12.990> module<00:01:13.170> where<00:01:13.920> you<00:01:13.979> could<00:01:14.130> do

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
after every module where you could do

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.010 
after every module where you could do
your<00:01:14.400> own<00:01:14.460> reading<00:01:15.090> around<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.570> subject

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
your own reading around the subject

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.480 
your own reading around the subject
which<00:01:16.650> I<00:01:16.740> thought<00:01:16.860> was<00:01:17.009> really<00:01:17.070> really

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
which I thought was really really

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.340 
which I thought was really really
important<00:01:19.040> and<00:01:20.040> I<00:01:20.610> probably<00:01:21.420> described<00:01:21.990> them

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
important and I probably described them

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.830 
important and I probably described them
and<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.860> course<00:01:23.100> is<00:01:23.340> kind<00:01:24.030> of<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.540> very<00:01:24.689> very

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
and the course is kind of the very very

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.230 
and the course is kind of the very very
thorough<00:01:25.320> or<00:01:26.070> it's<00:01:26.220> almost<00:01:26.549> like<00:01:26.790> somebody

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
thorough or it's almost like somebody

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.039 
thorough or it's almost like somebody
has<00:01:27.390> done<00:01:27.829> the<00:01:28.829> real<00:01:29.159> kind<00:01:29.939> of<00:01:30.119> hard<00:01:30.509> research

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
has done the real kind of hard research

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.630 
has done the real kind of hard research
for<00:01:31.500> you<00:01:31.619> and<00:01:31.770> they've<00:01:31.890> come<00:01:32.100> up<00:01:32.130> with<00:01:32.310> all<00:01:32.460> the

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
for you and they've come up with all the

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.399 
for you and they've come up with all the
key<00:01:32.820> points<00:01:33.439> so<00:01:34.439> you<00:01:34.500> so<00:01:35.189> what<00:01:35.369> you<00:01:35.400> get<00:01:35.909> is<00:01:36.150> the

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:36.409 
key points so you so what you get is the

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:38.690 
key points so you so what you get is the
absolute<00:01:37.409> things<00:01:37.770> that<00:01:37.979> really<00:01:38.159> matter<00:01:38.460> the

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
absolute things that really matter the

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.510 
absolute things that really matter the
studies<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.390> key<00:01:39.600> points<00:01:40.140> that<00:01:40.320> you<00:01:41.100> can<00:01:41.400> then

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
studies the key points that you can then

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.969 
studies the key points that you can then
pass<00:01:41.729> on<00:01:41.909> to<00:01:42.090> clients<00:01:42.600> so<00:01:43.530> at<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.740> same<00:01:43.920> time

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
pass on to clients so at the same time

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.880 
pass on to clients so at the same time
it's<00:01:44.490> thorough<00:01:44.729> but<00:01:45.060> he's<00:01:45.299> fast-track<00:01:45.930> -<00:01:46.259> so

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
it's thorough but he's fast-track - so

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.010 
it's thorough but he's fast-track - so
you're<00:01:47.040> not<00:01:47.220> left<00:01:47.460> with<00:01:47.670> a<00:01:47.790> huge<00:01:48.180> booklet<00:01:48.810> a

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
you're not left with a huge booklet a

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.350 
you're not left with a huge booklet a
one-off<00:01:50.009> download<00:01:50.670> that<00:01:50.820> you're<00:01:50.970> just<00:01:51.090> going

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
one-off download that you're just going

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.639 
one-off download that you're just going
to<00:01:51.420> look<00:01:51.810> at<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.110> think<00:01:52.290> this<00:01:52.380> is<00:01:52.439> absolutely

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
to look at and think this is absolutely

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.310 
to look at and think this is absolutely
over<00:01:53.189> facing<00:01:53.610> it<00:01:54.180> was<00:01:54.270> modular<00:01:54.780> it<00:01:55.200> was

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
over facing it was modular it was

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.990 
over facing it was modular it was
progressive<00:01:56.009> I<00:01:56.219> thought<00:01:56.579> the<00:01:56.700> learning

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
progressive I thought the learning

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.990 
progressive I thought the learning
experience<00:01:57.659> was<00:01:58.439> it<00:01:58.890> was<00:01:59.009> it<00:01:59.250> was<00:01:59.369> interactive

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
experience was it was it was interactive

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.580 
experience was it was it was interactive
you<00:02:00.090> didn't<00:02:00.299> really<00:02:00.659> even<00:02:00.780> realize<00:02:01.320> that<00:02:01.530> you

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
you didn't really even realize that you
