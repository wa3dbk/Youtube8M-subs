00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210 
little bit familiar when we compare this

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.029 
little bit familiar when we compare this
for<00:00:44.390> example<00:00:44.780> to<00:00:44.870> the<00:00:44.989> qualcomm<00:00:45.440> toq<00:00:45.679> because

00:00:46.029 --> 00:00:46.039 
for example to the qualcomm toq because

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:47.590 
for example to the qualcomm toq because
this<00:00:46.190> is<00:00:46.280> also<00:00:46.429> the<00:00:46.550> second<00:00:46.969> watch<00:00:47.059> is

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
actually using the mirror soul display

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.810 
actually using the mirror soul display
besides<00:00:51.410> that<00:00:51.649> it<00:00:51.859> has<00:00:51.980> four<00:00:52.249> gigabyte<00:00:52.640> of

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
besides that it has four gigabyte of

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.759 
besides that it has four gigabyte of
internal<00:00:53.329> storage<00:00:53.449> and<00:00:53.929> it<00:00:54.079> also<00:00:54.260> comes<00:00:54.649> with

00:00:57.669 --> 00:00:57.679 
a 3g module and in combination with the

00:00:57.679 --> 00:01:00.479 
a 3g module and in combination with the
GPS<00:00:58.219> which<00:00:58.730> is<00:00:58.879> in<00:00:58.969> the<00:00:59.059> same<00:00:59.269> model<00:00:59.420> obviously

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:00.489 
GPS which is in the same model obviously

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:04.990 
GPS which is in the same model obviously
you<00:01:01.489> can<00:01:02.059> always<00:01:02.920> see<00:01:03.920> where<00:01:04.400> you're<00:01:04.610> at<00:01:04.640> and

you can always see where you're at and

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.060 
you can always see where you're at and
of<00:01:05.330> course<00:01:05.570> it<00:01:05.720> can<00:01:05.870> also<00:01:06.070> receive

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
of course it can also receive

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.160 
of course it can also receive
information<00:01:07.490> for<00:01:08.180> example<00:01:08.510> you<00:01:08.540> can<00:01:08.840> receive

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
information for example you can receive

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.530 
information for example you can receive
messages<00:01:09.800> you<00:01:09.950> can<00:01:09.980> answer<00:01:10.340> messages<00:01:10.730> with

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:11.540 
messages you can answer messages with

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.230 
messages you can answer messages with
this<00:01:11.720> watch<00:01:11.980> when<00:01:12.980> you're<00:01:13.160> using<00:01:13.610> it<00:01:13.910> it<00:01:14.120> will

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
this watch when you're using it it will

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.910 
this watch when you're using it it will
have<00:01:14.480> a<00:01:14.510> better<00:01:14.750> way<00:01:14.960> love<00:01:15.140> of<00:01:15.290> eight<00:01:15.500> hours

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
have a better way love of eight hours

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.160 
have a better way love of eight hours
doesn't<00:01:16.760> so<00:01:16.970> much<00:01:17.030> but<00:01:17.600> here's<00:01:17.990> the<00:01:18.080> thing

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
doesn't so much but here's the thing

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.620 
doesn't so much but here's the thing
right<00:01:18.620> when<00:01:19.610> you're<00:01:19.760> a<00:01:19.790> runner<00:01:20.000> right<00:01:20.300> when

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
right when you're a runner right when

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.320 
right when you're a runner right when
you're<00:01:20.750> working<00:01:20.870> out<00:01:21.170> we<00:01:21.920> will<00:01:22.250> just<00:01:22.580> use<00:01:22.790> this

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 
you're working out we will just use this

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.990 
you're working out we will just use this
watch<00:01:23.630> for<00:01:24.290> this<00:01:24.440> specific<00:01:24.680> moment<00:01:25.160> and<00:01:25.640> I

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
watch for this specific moment and I

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.790 
watch for this specific moment and I
don't<00:01:26.300> know<00:01:26.420> so<00:01:26.780> many<00:01:26.930> people<00:01:27.380> out<00:01:27.470> there<00:01:27.710> that

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:27.800 
don't know so many people out there that

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.650 
don't know so many people out there that
are<00:01:27.860> running<00:01:28.160> for<00:01:28.370> eight<00:01:28.520> hours<00:01:28.550> at<00:01:29.210> least<00:01:29.420> not

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:29.660 
are running for eight hours at least not

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.630 
are running for eight hours at least not
consecutive<00:01:30.380> hours<00:01:30.680> I<00:01:30.890> couldn't<00:01:31.340> leave<00:01:31.400> as<00:01:31.550> I

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
consecutive hours I couldn't leave as I

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.940 
consecutive hours I couldn't leave as I
can<00:01:31.790> do<00:01:31.880> eight<00:01:31.970> minutes<00:01:32.330> I<00:01:32.390> guess<00:01:32.620> let<00:01:33.620> me<00:01:33.770> wait

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
can do eight minutes I guess let me wait

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.370 
can do eight minutes I guess let me wait
so<00:01:34.190> this<00:01:34.310> is<00:01:34.460> quite<00:01:34.670> interesting<00:01:34.700> and<00:01:35.390> let's

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
so this is quite interesting and let's

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.110 
so this is quite interesting and let's
take<00:01:36.500> a<00:01:36.530> quick<00:01:36.800> look<00:01:36.830> around<00:01:37.130> the<00:01:37.460> device<00:01:37.790> so

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:38.120 
take a quick look around the device so

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.000 
take a quick look around the device so
we<00:01:38.270> have<00:01:38.390> a<00:01:38.420> power<00:01:38.720> button<00:01:38.930> over<00:01:39.320> here<00:01:39.350> and

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:40.010 
we have a power button over here and

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:42.190 
we have a power button over here and
this<00:01:40.250> will<00:01:40.460> bring<00:01:40.610> up<00:01:40.790> the<00:01:40.970> overall<00:01:41.420> menu<00:01:41.900> and

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
this will bring up the overall menu and

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.040 
this will bring up the overall menu and
over<00:01:42.830> here<00:01:43.040> I<00:01:43.070> can<00:01:43.340> just<00:01:43.610> switch<00:01:44.330> forward<00:01:44.660> and

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:45.050 
over here I can just switch forward and

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.230 
over here I can just switch forward and
the<00:01:45.380> system<00:01:45.770> the<00:01:45.860> button<00:01:46.160> to<00:01:46.580> start<00:01:46.850> the<00:01:46.970> whole

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
the system the button to start the whole

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.330 
the system the button to start the whole
running<00:01:47.840> process<00:01:48.350> let<00:01:48.500> me<00:01:48.590> just<00:01:48.830> show<00:01:49.070> you<00:01:49.100> a
