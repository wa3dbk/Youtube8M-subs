00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:13.450 
a update about getting all the seeds

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:17.030 
a update about getting all the seeds
back<00:00:13.870> from<00:00:14.320> the<00:00:14.470> seed<00:00:14.710> pods<00:00:15.010> on<00:00:15.540> onions

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:17.040 
back from the seed pods on onions

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.830 
back from the seed pods on onions
probably<00:00:18.040> saw<00:00:18.160> the<00:00:18.220> bucket<00:00:18.760> in<00:00:18.849> my<00:00:19.029> last<00:00:19.270> video

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:19.840 
probably saw the bucket in my last video

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.310 
probably saw the bucket in my last video
just<00:00:20.380> had<00:00:20.560> all<00:00:21.130> the<00:00:21.460> little<00:00:22.180> heads<00:00:22.480> that<00:00:22.930> I<00:00:22.990> cut

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:23.320 
just had all the little heads that I cut

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.510 
just had all the little heads that I cut
off<00:00:23.500> and<00:00:23.800> dried<00:00:24.340> out<00:00:25.020> anyway<00:00:26.020> I'm<00:00:26.290> just

wanting to show you my methodology of
trying<00:00:29.800> to<00:00:29.890> get<00:00:30.070> the<00:00:30.189> seeds<00:00:30.520> away<00:00:31.090> from<00:00:31.360> the

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:31.480 
trying to get the seeds away from the

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.660 
trying to get the seeds away from the
heads<00:00:31.720> the<00:00:32.320> first<00:00:32.649> take<00:00:32.860> and<00:00:33.040> just<00:00:33.160> pluck<00:00:33.460> all

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:33.670 
heads the first take and just pluck all

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:35.310 
heads the first take and just pluck all
the<00:00:33.790> seeds<00:00:34.090> this<00:00:34.540> is<00:00:34.660> kind<00:00:34.780> of<00:00:34.810> a<00:00:34.960> bucket<00:00:35.230> I

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:35.320 
the seeds this is kind of a bucket I

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.319 
the seeds this is kind of a bucket I
used<00:00:35.560> put<00:00:35.829> him<00:00:35.950> back<00:00:36.100> into<00:00:36.280> the<00:00:36.430> composter<00:00:37.210> of

00:00:37.319 --> 00:00:37.329 
used put him back into the composter of

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:39.540 
used put him back into the composter of
stuff<00:00:37.600> but<00:00:37.840> I<00:00:38.019> took<00:00:38.559> and<00:00:38.890> pulled<00:00:39.129> all<00:00:39.340> the

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:39.550 
stuff but I took and pulled all the

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.799 
stuff but I took and pulled all the
little<00:00:39.789> little<00:00:40.629> balls<00:00:40.989> a<00:00:41.500> little<00:00:41.800> seed<00:00:42.429> pods

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
little little balls a little seed pods

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.189 
little little balls a little seed pods
off<00:00:43.809> at<00:00:44.379> the<00:00:44.500> top<00:00:44.710> of<00:00:44.980> each<00:00:45.460> one<00:00:45.489> of<00:00:45.969> them<00:00:46.179> and<00:00:46.359> I

00:00:47.189 --> 00:00:47.199 
off at the top of each one of them and I

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:50.520 
off at the top of each one of them and I
put<00:00:47.230> them<00:00:47.440> into<00:00:47.620> a<00:00:47.739> plastic<00:00:48.269> bucket<00:00:49.269> and<00:00:49.660> then

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:50.530 
put them into a plastic bucket and then

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.970 
put them into a plastic bucket and then
as<00:00:51.219> you<00:00:51.339> can<00:00:51.460> see<00:00:52.379> all<00:00:53.379> the<00:00:53.620> little<00:00:53.739> black

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:53.980 
as you can see all the little black

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:55.439 
as you can see all the little black
specks<00:00:54.489> in<00:00:54.640> there<00:00:54.760> every<00:00:55.000> single<00:00:55.300> one<00:00:55.390> of

00:00:55.439 --> 00:00:55.449 
specks in there every single one of

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:58.349 
specks in there every single one of
those<00:00:55.660> is<00:00:55.989> an<00:00:56.260> onion<00:00:56.649> seed<00:00:56.980> I<00:00:57.309> probably<00:00:58.120> got<00:00:58.300> a

00:00:58.349 --> 00:00:58.359 
those is an onion seed I probably got a

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:08.300 
those is an onion seed I probably got a
couple<00:00:58.600> thousand<00:00:59.289> in<00:00:59.410> there<00:01:00.420> but<00:01:01.679> the<00:01:05.100> see

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.700 

it's<00:01:09.060> really<00:01:09.330> hard<00:01:09.600> to<00:01:09.780> get<00:01:09.900> down<00:01:10.320> and<00:01:10.500> you<00:01:10.590> can

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
it's really hard to get down and you can

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.040 
it's really hard to get down and you can
see<00:01:10.860> a<00:01:10.890> one<00:01:11.790> that<00:01:12.000> didn't<00:01:12.330> quite<00:01:12.510> get<00:01:12.690> broken

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:13.050 
see a one that didn't quite get broken

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.310 
see a one that didn't quite get broken
up<00:01:13.290> but<00:01:14.300> whenever<00:01:15.300> you<00:01:15.540> take<00:01:15.750> them<00:01:15.930> and<00:01:16.020> pull

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
up but whenever you take them and pull

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.940 
up but whenever you take them and pull
them<00:01:16.470> off<00:01:16.590> with<00:01:16.800> the<00:01:16.920> top<00:01:17.880> of<00:01:18.120> the<00:01:18.150> stalks

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
them off with the top of the stalks

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:24.740 
them off with the top of the stalks
inside<00:01:21.980> there's<00:01:22.980> usually<00:01:23.430> at<00:01:23.580> least<00:01:23.630> three<00:01:24.630> to

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
inside there's usually at least three to

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:30.530 
inside there's usually at least three to
four<00:01:24.780> of<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:26.100> onion<00:01:26.460> seeds<00:01:28.730> I've<00:01:29.730> done<00:01:30.270> a<00:01:30.300> lot

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
four of the onion seeds I've done a lot

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.810 
four of the onion seeds I've done a lot
to<00:01:30.810> take<00:01:31.020> and<00:01:31.230> I've<00:01:31.380> even<00:01:31.530> used<00:01:31.680> it<00:01:32.130> used<00:01:32.640> one

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
to take and I've even used it used one

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.070 
to take and I've even used it used one
of<00:01:32.850> these<00:01:33.770> sifters<00:01:34.770> here<00:01:35.130> I<00:01:35.280> just<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.960> know

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:37.080 
of these sifters here I just you know

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.290 
of these sifters here I just you know
one<00:01:37.320> of<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.650> shafts<00:01:38.400> between<00:01:38.940> my<00:01:39.090> hands

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:39.300 
one of the shafts between my hands

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.540 
one of the shafts between my hands
inside<00:01:39.780> of<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:39.960> bucket<00:01:40.290> until<00:01:40.530> it<00:01:40.650> breaks<00:01:41.340> it

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:41.550 
inside of the bucket until it breaks it

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:43.910 
inside of the bucket until it breaks it
down<00:01:41.580> pretty<00:01:42.030> finely<00:01:42.360> and<00:01:42.810> then<00:01:43.560> I've<00:01:43.740> taken

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
down pretty finely and then I've taken

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.969 
down pretty finely and then I've taken
and<00:01:44.310> sifted<00:01:44.850> that<00:01:45.060> over<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:45.990> top<00:01:46.200> of<00:01:46.229> my<00:01:46.619> my

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
and sifted that over the top of my my

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.240 
and sifted that over the top of my my
little<00:01:47.220> compost<00:01:47.640> or<00:01:47.880> bucket<00:01:48.240> here<00:01:48.450> and<00:01:48.950> I<00:01:49.950> try

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
little compost or bucket here and I try

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.270 
little compost or bucket here and I try
to<00:01:50.310> get<00:01:50.490> as<00:01:50.640> much<00:01:50.880> of<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.410> just<00:01:52.410> the<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:53.040> waste

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
to get as much of the just the the waste

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.130 
to get as much of the just the the waste
get<00:01:53.580> it<00:01:53.670> down<00:01:53.820> to<00:01:54.000> where<00:01:54.119> it's<00:01:54.270> just<00:01:54.330> the<00:01:54.780> seeds

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
get it down to where it's just the seeds

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.130 
get it down to where it's just the seeds
but<00:01:55.880> I'm<00:01:56.880> almost<00:01:57.150> to<00:01:57.330> the<00:01:57.360> point<00:01:57.570> where<00:01:57.750> I've

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
but I'm almost to the point where I've

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.540 
but I'm almost to the point where I've
worked<00:01:58.320> I<00:01:58.500> worked<00:01:58.619> on<00:01:58.830> it<00:01:59.009> for<00:01:59.160> probably<00:01:59.250> about

00:01:59.540 --> 00:01:59.550 
worked I worked on it for probably about

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:01.160 
worked I worked on it for probably about
an<00:01:59.700> hour<00:01:59.850> hour<00:02:00.150> and<00:02:00.330> a<00:02:00.360> half<00:02:00.540> to<00:02:00.690> try<00:02:00.810> to<00:02:00.869> clean

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
an hour hour and a half to try to clean

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.930 
an hour hour and a half to try to clean
it<00:02:01.200> up<00:02:01.380> as<00:02:01.530> much<00:02:01.710> as<00:02:01.860> possible<00:02:02.100> but<00:02:02.580> I<00:02:02.640> think

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:02.940 
it up as much as possible but I think

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:04.280 
it up as much as possible but I think
I'm<00:02:03.060> gonna<00:02:03.180> just<00:02:03.450> leave<00:02:03.660> it<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:03.930> way<00:02:03.960> it<00:02:04.080> is

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
I'm gonna just leave it the way it is

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.650 
I'm gonna just leave it the way it is
right<00:02:04.470> now<00:02:05.000> whenever<00:02:06.000> I<00:02:06.060> start<00:02:06.420> to<00:02:06.450> go

right now whenever I start to go

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.889 
right now whenever I start to go

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:13.769 
don't think it's going to hurt anything

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:17.180 
don't think it's going to hurt anything
to<00:02:14.190> plant<00:02:15.060> it<00:02:15.209> along<00:02:15.450> with<00:02:15.720> the<00:02:15.980> along<00:02:16.980> with

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
to plant it along with the along with

to plant it along with the along with
the<00:02:17.340> seeds<00:02:18.140> you<00:02:19.140> know<00:02:19.290> it'll<00:02:19.739> be<00:02:19.860> a<00:02:19.890> little

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
the seeds you know it'll be a little

compost<00:02:20.519> in<00:02:20.700> the<00:02:20.790> ground<00:02:21.030> just<00:02:21.269> as<00:02:21.420> well<00:02:21.600> as

anything will and I just don't think

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.850 
anything will and I just don't think
it's<00:02:24.120> worth<00:02:24.330> the<00:02:24.360> worth<00:02:25.170> the<00:02:25.200> time<00:02:25.530> and<00:02:25.590> effort

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
it's worth the worth the time and effort

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.949 
it's worth the worth the time and effort
