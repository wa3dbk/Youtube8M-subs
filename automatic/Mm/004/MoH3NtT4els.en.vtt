very detailed control over the side not

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.510 
very detailed control over the side not
making<00:02:08.550> much<00:02:08.759> of<00:02:08.790> a<00:02:09.000> difference<00:02:09.030> is<00:02:09.600> it<00:02:10.520> so

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
making much of a difference is it so

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.979 
making much of a difference is it so
we're<00:02:11.700> standing<00:02:11.850> in<00:02:12.270> what<00:02:12.420> we<00:02:12.540> call<00:02:12.750> our

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
we're standing in what we call our

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:15.290 
we're standing in what we call our
capture<00:02:13.590> stage<00:02:13.980> if<00:02:14.489> you<00:02:14.580> look<00:02:14.820> around<00:02:15.090> you<00:02:15.209> on

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
capture stage if you look around you on

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.300 
capture stage if you look around you on
the<00:02:15.390> ceiling<00:02:15.720> you<00:02:15.780> actually<00:02:16.050> see<00:02:16.230> six<00:02:16.620> cameras

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
the ceiling you actually see six cameras

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.240 
the ceiling you actually see six cameras
with<00:02:17.880> red<00:02:18.239> rings<00:02:18.630> of<00:02:18.930> lights<00:02:19.200> so<00:02:19.980> what<00:02:20.160> that's

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
with red rings of lights so what that's

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.060 
with red rings of lights so what that's
actually<00:02:20.430> doing<00:02:20.940> is<00:02:21.120> those<00:02:21.900> red<00:02:22.230> lights<00:02:22.470> are

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
actually doing is those red lights are

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:24.920 
actually doing is those red lights are
bouncing<00:02:23.580> off<00:02:23.700> in<00:02:23.850> these<00:02:23.970> silver<00:02:24.420> markers<00:02:24.810> I
