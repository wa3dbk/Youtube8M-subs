what<00:00:17.490> acid<00:00:17.760> stealer<00:00:18.090> is<00:00:18.320> so<00:00:19.320> it's<00:00:19.650> basically<00:00:19.980> a

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
what acid stealer is so it's basically a

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.060 
what acid stealer is so it's basically a
tool<00:00:20.640> that<00:00:20.930> sends<00:00:21.930> your<00:00:22.050> console<00:00:22.560> ID<00:00:22.739> when<00:00:22.980> you

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
tool that sends your console ID when you

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.069 
tool that sends your console ID when you
connect<00:00:23.340> your<00:00:23.430> ps3<00:00:23.730> to<00:00:24.060> an<00:00:24.150> online<00:00:24.329> server<00:00:24.779> and

00:00:25.069 --> 00:00:25.079 
connect your ps3 to an online server and

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:27.290 
connect your ps3 to an online server and
then<00:00:25.560> they<00:00:25.739> have<00:00:25.919> access<00:00:26.369> to<00:00:26.460> your<00:00:26.489> console<00:00:27.119> ID

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
then they have access to your console ID

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.970 
then they have access to your console ID
and<00:00:27.599> they<00:00:27.810> can<00:00:27.989> sell<00:00:28.290> it<00:00:29.270> make<00:00:30.270> it<00:00:30.980> unprivate

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
and they can sell it make it unprivate

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.490 
and they can sell it make it unprivate
and<00:00:32.460> year<00:00:33.000> you<00:00:33.149> most<00:00:33.390> probably<00:00:33.570> probably<00:00:33.989> get

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:06.890 
one has reduced on it's just a new tool
that<00:01:03.329> looks<00:01:04.140> very<00:01:04.470> basic<00:01:05.010> then<00:01:05.550> your<00:01:06.210> most

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
that looks very basic then your most

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.720 
that looks very basic then your most
obviously<00:01:07.650> not<00:01:07.920> going<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.159> want<00:01:08.250> to<00:01:08.340> use<00:01:08.400> that

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:08.730 
obviously not going to want to use that

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:11.990 
obviously not going to want to use that
because<00:01:08.909> its<00:01:09.870> most<00:01:10.380> probably<00:01:11.189> as<00:01:11.430> its<00:01:11.640> dealer

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000
