00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:35.690
 with my days it could be 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:38.450
 look doctor to see if you can help me with 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:41.449
 a touch problem that I have flick 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:43.879
 tell us we are not followed peace with 

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:46.430
 these two states can not talk 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:49.220
 how well is the problem 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.409
 Look, sometimes I wake up and I said no 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:53.839
 more today will be the day that the substances 

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:55.940
 does not foresee more with stereo than infinite 

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:58.519
 the works the cravings put pure by 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:01.010
 inside my soul and now I was commenting 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:03.649
 the pain psychologist to this addiction is 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:06.229
 every day more he felt he says he suffers 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:08.720
 psychomotor disability prescribed me 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:10.850
 reassuring pasta says that's what 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.520
 that more now and I'm in a bad mood that I have 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.890
 a devastating mind ok ok look 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.020
 dancing a month and you'll see that it incorporates and 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:21.020
 do not forget to take medication and you will see that 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.910
 is controlled and already leaving your office to 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.580
 another the magazine and for inside point two 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:27.649
 vital rows report direct path to 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:30.740
 neighborhood the pills that I sell them 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:33.020
 in the neighborhood unconsciously my 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.330
 body acquires mentafetamine chemical 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.700
 parrot or something that twists me logical 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.170
 put hallucinogenic toxic and stops in 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.270
 forced the solid 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.040
 in as much account that for me there is no longer 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.380
 solution and vices envelops us 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.659
 soak of loss lost definition 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:51.280
 what is love and heart and daily by 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:54.330
 the nights to the Lord with this prayer 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:59.690
 if you are singing 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:02:06.620
 because this can not get me out 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:06.620
 it is perhaps a punishment of your divine walk 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:14.070
 be suffering like that because he consumes 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.780
 sprunk I do not want to blame people but 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:18.030
 it seems to be the fault of Montes 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.610
 they question young and could affect me that 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:24.420
 led to no date keeps filling 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:26.850
 myth in these next 4 with 20 hours 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.860
 temporary with healing the heart and my 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.930
 stories are an entity for the data this 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.180
 level that saves the microphone and has no 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:37.020
 I want to download it is only widgets 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:39.060
 jr ewing has already been together with 66 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:42.270
 of the wisdom of the point of destruction 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:45.840
 country more than any fact or faces 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:49.140
 shots play after web missions like 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:51.600
 my son because he never dies 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:54.030
 but I just want to leave marijuana and I 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.400
 I have power is our asset for the 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:59.040
 women I know but it's just that yesterday that I 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.020
 intoxiquÃ© will not have sensation that only 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.360
 has a crazy 3 whose addiction this month 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:05.160
 they call me like a propeller and there's 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.380
 20 note that it was not addiction all 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.540
 it was cold live in hd and the sky in 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.820
 I commented on my faith more than a request for 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.160
 protections and the definitive solution and 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:15.040
 all my respects 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:18.090
 but 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:23.420
 if you are singing 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:27.510
 because later you can take me out 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:30.349
 is it a punishment for your walking ? 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.349
 divine 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:37.890
 be suffering like that sometimes think men 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:40.710
 sheen and family and their initial substitute 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:43.050
 the money to touch me and so calm me 

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:44.910
 but the feeling of giving me back 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:46.890
 another plus this is inevitable addicted to 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:49.140
 toxic chemical seems to be pathological 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:51.420
 lab animal loose in this 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.730
 big zoo considers sick at the level 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:55.890
 of extreme addiction we need help 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.900
 help that we do not want with drugs the 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:59.730
 alcohol and with the passage of the years being 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.980
 the same people make us more 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.870
 strangers' more mundane more insane until 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.240
 see us more holy years the series time 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.250
 all vices are your allies but 

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:10.050
 here we are still clinging 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:12.030
 they love substances as much as 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:13.800
 walk of payments that we can expect from 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.080
 our own destiny if in this world 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:18.840
 we live in shit we convert it not what 

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:21.030
 We do not smoke like drinks 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.490
 fee that runs the destiny is to evaporate 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:25.110
 it's not that damn person heart of 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.090
 ice to my girl friends family 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.530
 I show that I love them although I know 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:30.810
 I love you my fears that yesterday 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:32.760
 I prefer to wait and forgive me I know not 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:35.040
 I won the sky I want to give them the best 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.500
 from me to see him smile at something 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:38.729
 serve and not always 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:41.880
 I 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:48.210
 if you are singing 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:54.140
 because this can not get me out of you 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:54.140
 perhaps a punishment of your walk your divine 

00:04:54.529 --> 00:05:02.780
 and I do not want to be suffering like that 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:08.540
 if you are singing 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:12.050
 because this can get us out of doubt and 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:14.530
 the one that punishes your mandate 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:14.530
 divine 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:21.009
 and I want to be suffering like that
