a<00:00:02.560> very<00:00:03.340> common<00:00:03.790> method<00:00:04.000> to<00:00:04.569> cool<00:00:04.870> the

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:05.080 
a very common method to cool the

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:06.960 
a very common method to cool the
components<00:00:05.290> inside<00:00:06.069> of<00:00:06.220> our<00:00:06.310> computers<00:00:06.790> is

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:06.970 
components inside of our computers is

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:09.360 
components inside of our computers is
something<00:00:07.299> called<00:00:07.509> a<00:00:07.720> heatsink<00:00:08.260> this<00:00:08.860> is<00:00:09.100> a

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:09.370 
something called a heatsink this is a

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:11.910 
something called a heatsink this is a
copper<00:00:09.969> or<00:00:10.270> aluminum<00:00:10.990> piece<00:00:11.290> that<00:00:11.559> is<00:00:11.679> put<00:00:11.889> on

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:11.920 
copper or aluminum piece that is put on

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.940 
copper or aluminum piece that is put on
top<00:00:12.429> of<00:00:12.730> a<00:00:12.969> very<00:00:13.599> hot<00:00:13.929> component<00:00:14.530> usually

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:14.950 
top of a very hot component usually

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:17.160 
top of a very hot component usually
these<00:00:15.190> are<00:00:15.250> the<00:00:15.700> very<00:00:15.910> hot<00:00:16.150> chips<00:00:16.599> that<00:00:17.110> are

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:17.170 
these are the very hot chips that are

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:19.500 
these are the very hot chips that are
right<00:00:17.500> on<00:00:17.710> our<00:00:18.009> motherboards<00:00:18.699> and<00:00:18.850> as<00:00:19.300> they

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:19.510 
right on our motherboards and as they

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:22.019 
right on our motherboards and as they
heat<00:00:19.810> up<00:00:19.840> all<00:00:20.470> of<00:00:20.890> the<00:00:21.039> heat<00:00:21.310> is<00:00:21.490> pulled<00:00:21.820> up

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:22.029 
heat up all of the heat is pulled up

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:24.210 
heat up all of the heat is pulled up
through<00:00:22.539> this<00:00:22.750> heatsink<00:00:23.380> and<00:00:23.500> because<00:00:24.070> we

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:24.220 
through this heatsink and because we

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.189 
through this heatsink and because we
have<00:00:24.310> all<00:00:24.580> these<00:00:24.820> little<00:00:25.000> holes<00:00:25.420> that<00:00:26.109> are

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:26.199 
have all these little holes that are

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:27.870 
have all these little holes that are
being<00:00:26.350> pulled<00:00:26.650> here<00:00:26.949> as<00:00:27.100> the<00:00:27.340> air<00:00:27.519> blows

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:27.880 
being pulled here as the air blows

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.509 
being pulled here as the air blows
through<00:00:28.269> it<00:00:28.449> it<00:00:28.630> is<00:00:28.900> also<00:00:29.410> cooling<00:00:29.740> the<00:00:30.130> top<00:00:30.310> of

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:30.519 
through it it is also cooling the top of

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:32.310 
through it it is also cooling the top of
the<00:00:30.609> heatsink<00:00:31.090> so<00:00:31.210> we're<00:00:31.359> able<00:00:31.660> to<00:00:31.810> dissipate

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:32.320 
the heatsink so we're able to dissipate

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.889 
the heatsink so we're able to dissipate
that<00:00:32.500> heat<00:00:32.559> and<00:00:33.040> get<00:00:33.550> rid<00:00:33.820> of<00:00:33.850> it<00:00:34.030> outside<00:00:34.269> of

00:00:34.889 --> 00:00:34.899 
that heat and get rid of it outside of

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:37.020 
that heat and get rid of it outside of
our<00:00:35.110> computing<00:00:35.649> case<00:00:35.920> you<00:00:36.430> can<00:00:36.610> see<00:00:36.790> that<00:00:36.820> the

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:37.030 
our computing case you can see that the

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.299 
our computing case you can see that the
surface<00:00:37.450> area<00:00:37.870> is<00:00:38.050> very<00:00:38.140> large<00:00:38.380> we<00:00:39.010> take<00:00:39.190> it

00:00:39.299 --> 00:00:39.309 
surface area is very large we take it

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:41.970 
surface area is very large we take it
from<00:00:39.489> that<00:00:39.520> very<00:00:39.850> flat<00:00:40.270> area<00:00:40.780> and<00:00:41.050> extend<00:00:41.860> it

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:41.980 
from that very flat area and extend it

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:43.590 
from that very flat area and extend it
up<00:00:42.100> through<00:00:42.309> these<00:00:42.460> little<00:00:42.730> fins<00:00:43.059> and<00:00:43.450> let

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:43.600 
up through these little fins and let

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.990 
up through these little fins and let
that<00:00:43.750> air<00:00:44.020> flow<00:00:44.440> through<00:00:44.770> one<00:00:45.489> important

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:46.000 
that air flow through one important

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.299 
that air flow through one important
piece<00:00:46.239> of<00:00:46.270> this<00:00:46.660> is<00:00:46.899> that<00:00:47.379> underneath<00:00:47.890> this

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:48.309 
piece of this is that underneath this

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:50.700 
piece of this is that underneath this
heatsink<00:00:48.940> where<00:00:49.149> it<00:00:49.329> is<00:00:49.450> connecting<00:00:50.170> to<00:00:50.500> that

very<00:00:51.070> very<00:00:51.370> hot<00:00:51.670> chip<00:00:52.090> we<00:00:52.570> put<00:00:52.840> a<00:00:52.870> thermal

00:00:53.459 --> 00:00:53.469 
very very hot chip we put a thermal

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:55.860 
very very hot chip we put a thermal
grease<00:00:53.860> that<00:00:53.920> is<00:00:54.250> designed<00:00:54.760> to<00:00:54.969> keep<00:00:55.239> a<00:00:55.570> good

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:55.870 
grease that is designed to keep a good

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.110 
grease that is designed to keep a good
connection<00:00:56.140> between<00:00:56.800> the<00:00:57.190> heatsink<00:00:57.789> and<00:00:57.910> the

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:58.120 
connection between the heatsink and the

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.569 
connection between the heatsink and the
processor<00:00:58.750> itself<00:00:59.199> if<00:00:59.440> that<00:00:59.980> particular

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:00.579 
processor itself if that particular

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:03.090 
processor itself if that particular
connection<00:01:00.910> is<00:01:01.300> not<00:01:01.690> very<00:01:02.109> good<00:01:02.379> then<00:01:02.980> the

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 
connection is not very good then the

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.920 
connection is not very good then the
heat<00:01:03.280> is<00:01:03.399> not<00:01:03.430> going<00:01:03.850> to<00:01:03.940> dissipate<00:01:04.390> well<00:01:04.660> and

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:04.930 
heat is not going to dissipate well and

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.320 
heat is not going to dissipate well and
that<00:01:05.259> thermal<00:01:05.740> grease<00:01:06.009> is<00:01:06.280> designed<00:01:06.760> to<00:01:07.180> keep

important<00:01:12.010> safety<00:01:12.220> tip<00:01:12.640> is<00:01:12.880> if<00:01:13.060> you're<00:01:13.240> doing

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420 
important safety tip is if you're doing

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.390 
important safety tip is if you're doing
a<00:01:13.720> lot<00:01:13.900> of<00:01:13.990> processing<00:01:14.560> on<00:01:14.710> your<00:01:14.860> computer

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:15.400 
a lot of processing on your computer

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.340 
a lot of processing on your computer
these<00:01:15.850> components<00:01:16.420> are<00:01:16.510> getting<00:01:16.750> very<00:01:17.020> hot

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
these components are getting very hot

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.469 
these components are getting very hot
and<00:01:17.590> because<00:01:17.860> the<00:01:18.009> heatsink<00:01:18.580> is<00:01:18.759> dissipating

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:19.479 
and because the heatsink is dissipating

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:22.050 
and because the heatsink is dissipating
that<00:01:19.659> heat<00:01:19.900> it<00:01:20.380> also<00:01:20.710> gets<00:01:21.189> very<00:01:21.280> hot<00:01:21.700> so<00:01:21.970> if

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
that heat it also gets very hot so if

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:23.940 
that heat it also gets very hot so if
you're<00:01:22.180> working<00:01:22.360> inside<00:01:22.840> of<00:01:22.900> a<00:01:23.110> computer<00:01:23.140> that

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
you're working inside of a computer that

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.590 
you're working inside of a computer that
you've<00:01:24.130> just<00:01:24.430> turned<00:01:24.640> off<00:01:24.880> be<00:01:25.090> careful

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
you've just turned off be careful

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.600 
you've just turned off be careful
because<00:01:26.049> these<00:01:26.380> heat<00:01:26.650> sinks<00:01:27.040> can<00:01:27.220> get<00:01:27.340> very

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.610 
because these heat sinks can get very

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.899 
because these heat sinks can get very
very<00:01:27.700> warm<00:01:28.150> to<00:01:28.420> the<00:01:28.450> touch<00:01:29.189> in<00:01:30.189> your<00:01:30.430> computer

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:30.909 
very warm to the touch in your computer

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:32.789 
very warm to the touch in your computer
there's<00:01:31.119> probably<00:01:31.540> more<00:01:31.810> than<00:01:31.869> one<00:01:32.020> heatsink

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:32.799 
there's probably more than one heatsink

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:34.770 
there's probably more than one heatsink
that<00:01:32.950> you<00:01:33.100> have<00:01:33.340> you<00:01:33.579> can<00:01:33.700> see<00:01:33.939> the<00:01:34.329> heatsink

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 
that you have you can see the heatsink

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.600 
that you have you can see the heatsink
that<00:01:34.930> might<00:01:35.110> be<00:01:35.290> on<00:01:35.470> a<00:01:35.500> main<00:01:35.740> processor

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
that might be on a main processor

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.280 
that might be on a main processor
there's<00:01:36.970> other<00:01:37.150> heat<00:01:37.420> sinks<00:01:37.780> that<00:01:37.930> might<00:01:38.140> be

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:38.290 
there's other heat sinks that might be

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:40.530 
there's other heat sinks that might be
on<00:01:38.500> a<00:01:38.530> North<00:01:38.979> bridge<00:01:39.280> and<00:01:39.549> other<00:01:39.880> components

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:40.540 
on a North bridge and other components

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.120 
on a North bridge and other components
themselves<00:01:41.020> may<00:01:41.140> have<00:01:41.170> other<00:01:41.530> heat<00:01:41.799> sinks

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
themselves may have other heat sinks

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:43.710 
themselves may have other heat sinks
these<00:01:42.310> look<00:01:42.490> kind<00:01:42.670> of<00:01:42.790> interesting<00:01:43.450> and<00:01:43.600> that

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.720 
these look kind of interesting and that

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.389

they<00:01:44.079> have<00:01:44.229> these<00:01:44.350> little<00:01:44.500> fins<00:01:44.860> come<00:01:45.130> up<00:01:45.280> they

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:45.399 
they have these little fins come up they

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:46.980 
they have these little fins come up they
almost<00:01:45.549> look<00:01:45.850> like<00:01:45.880> flames<00:01:46.360> coming<00:01:46.869> up

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990

it its own set of fans especially if
it's<00:02:28.720> something<00:02:29.050> like<00:02:29.080> a<00:02:29.440> video<00:02:29.830> card<00:02:30.250> these

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
it's something like a video card these

it's something like a video card these
can<00:02:30.820> be<00:02:30.940> kind<00:02:31.360> of<00:02:31.420> bulky<00:02:31.840> because<00:02:32.170> you<00:02:32.590> not

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740 
can be kind of bulky because you not

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:34.920 
can be kind of bulky because you not
only<00:02:32.770> have<00:02:33.010> the<00:02:33.310> adapter<00:02:33.640> card<00:02:34.090> itself<00:02:34.420> but

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
only have the adapter card itself but

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.960 
only have the adapter card itself but
you've<00:02:35.110> now<00:02:35.320> put<00:02:35.380> a<00:02:35.590> fan<00:02:35.950> inside<00:02:36.280> of<00:02:36.700> it<00:02:36.820> to

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
you've now put a fan inside of it to

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:38.970 
you've now put a fan inside of it to
make<00:02:37.150> sure<00:02:37.360> that<00:02:37.510> it<00:02:37.780> gets<00:02:38.050> its<00:02:38.290> own<00:02:38.590> cooling

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
make sure that it gets its own cooling

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.880 
make sure that it gets its own cooling
as<00:02:39.310> well<00:02:39.340> it's<00:02:40.270> almost<00:02:40.450> always<00:02:40.840> seen<00:02:41.380> on<00:02:41.740> these

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:06.820 
part of the case you'll probably want to

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.840 
part of the case you'll probably want to
look<00:03:07.120> in<00:03:07.390> a<00:03:07.570> desktop<00:03:07.960> computer<00:03:08.230> especially

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
look in a desktop computer especially

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.370 
look in a desktop computer especially
because<00:03:09.850> the<00:03:10.120> layout<00:03:10.450> of<00:03:10.660> the<00:03:11.050> motherboard

because the layout of the motherboard

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.500 
because the layout of the motherboard
becomes<00:03:11.950> very<00:03:12.190> important<00:03:12.760> especially<00:03:13.180> the
