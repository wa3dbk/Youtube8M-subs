by itself it works but it doesn't give
that<00:02:18.700> like<00:02:19.090> glossy<00:02:19.920> shiny<00:02:20.920> look<00:02:21.250> if<00:02:21.490> you<00:02:21.610> guys

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
that like glossy shiny look if you guys

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.820 
that like glossy shiny look if you guys
know<00:02:22.060> what<00:02:22.180> I'm<00:02:22.270> talking<00:02:22.330> about<00:02:22.690> but<00:02:23.650> when<00:02:23.770> I

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
know what I'm talking about but when I

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.410 
know what I'm talking about but when I
added<00:02:24.100> the<00:02:24.340> oil<00:02:24.540> it<00:02:25.540> was<00:02:26.200> like<00:02:26.470> it<00:02:27.070> popped<00:02:27.940> and

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
added the oil it was like it popped and

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.740 
added the oil it was like it popped and
I<00:02:29.020> had<00:02:29.230> the<00:02:29.350> moisture<00:02:30.090> so<00:02:31.090> that's<00:02:31.240> the<00:02:31.360> best

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
I had the moisture so that's the best

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.850 
I had the moisture so that's the best
way<00:02:31.960> I<00:02:31.990> can<00:02:32.170> probably<00:02:32.500> describe<00:02:33.100> it<00:02:33.610> but<00:02:34.860> I

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
way I can probably describe it but I

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.700 
way I can probably describe it but I
would<00:02:36.280> definitely<00:02:36.940> buy<00:02:37.180> it<00:02:37.240> again<00:02:37.500> for<00:02:38.500> two

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:38.710 
would definitely buy it again for two

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:41.550 
would definitely buy it again for two
dollars<00:02:38.830> and<00:02:39.220> 87<00:02:39.550> cents<00:02:40.180> I<00:02:40.480> mean<00:02:40.750> it's<00:02:41.050> it's

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
dollars and 87 cents I mean it's it's

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.500 
dollars and 87 cents I mean it's it's
pretty<00:02:41.890> good<00:02:42.070> you<00:02:42.520> know<00:02:42.670> it's<00:02:43.270> a<00:02:43.300> lot<00:02:43.480> cheaper

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
pretty good you know it's a lot cheaper

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.530 
pretty good you know it's a lot cheaper
than<00:02:44.020> a<00:02:44.170> lot<00:02:44.440> of<00:02:44.560> the<00:02:44.680> other<00:02:44.860> over<00:02:45.310> counter<00:02:46.270> on

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
than a lot of the other over counter on

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.150 
than a lot of the other over counter on
leave-in<00:02:46.960> conditioners<00:02:47.830> so<00:02:48.220> it's<00:02:48.400> okay<00:02:49.030> um

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
leave-in conditioners so it's okay um

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.680 
leave-in conditioners so it's okay um
the<00:02:51.160> only<00:02:51.310> thing<00:02:51.430> is<00:02:51.850> that<00:02:51.880> it<00:02:52.180> didn't<00:02:52.570> really

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
the only thing is that it didn't really

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.660 
the only thing is that it didn't really
make<00:02:52.900> my<00:02:53.050> hair<00:02:53.260> that<00:02:53.440> song<00:02:53.710> and<00:02:54.190> I<00:02:54.490> don't

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
make my hair that song and I don't

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:55.920 
make my hair that song and I don't
really<00:02:54.850> think<00:02:54.940> that<00:02:55.300> it's<00:02:55.420> something<00:02:55.630> that<00:02:55.780> I

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
really think that it's something that I

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.840 
really think that it's something that I
use<00:02:56.700> every<00:02:57.700> day<00:02:57.810> like<00:02:59.070> this<00:03:00.070> is<00:03:00.310> probably<00:03:00.790> like

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
use every day like this is probably like

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.690 
use every day like this is probably like
in<00:03:01.780> between<00:03:02.020> protective<00:03:02.890> styles<00:03:03.580> or

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
in between protective styles or

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.210 
in between protective styles or
something<00:03:04.090> like<00:03:04.240> that<00:03:04.500> but<00:03:05.500> it's<00:03:06.010> a<00:03:06.100> good

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
something like that but it's a good

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.900 
something like that but it's a good
product<00:03:06.580> and<00:03:08.010> I'm<00:03:09.010> sure<00:03:09.310> they<00:03:09.430> sell<00:03:09.700> it<00:03:09.850> I
