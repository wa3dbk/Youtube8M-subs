welcome to practice question number two

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.499 
welcome to practice question number two
we're<00:00:03.510> going<00:00:03.689> over<00:00:03.990> dosage<00:00:04.620> calculations

00:00:05.499 --> 00:00:05.509 
we're going over dosage calculations

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:08.210 
we're going over dosage calculations
here<00:00:06.509> in<00:00:06.600> this<00:00:06.720> example<00:00:07.020> it<00:00:07.350> says<00:00:07.589> a<00:00:07.620> doctor

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.509 
here in this example it says a doctor
orders<00:00:08.610> two<00:00:09.030> milligrams<00:00:09.599> per<00:00:10.290> kilogram<00:00:10.740> of<00:00:10.920> a

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
orders two milligrams per kilogram of a

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.870 
orders two milligrams per kilogram of a
drug<00:00:11.820> for<00:00:12.300> a<00:00:12.360> child<00:00:12.719> weighing<00:00:12.990> 97<00:00:13.710> pounds<00:00:14.160> that

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
drug for a child weighing 97 pounds that

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.990 
drug for a child weighing 97 pounds that
the<00:00:14.969> drug<00:00:15.269> is<00:00:15.450> available<00:00:16.350> at<00:00:16.640> 175<00:00:17.640> milligrams

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
the drug is available at 175 milligrams

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.349 
the drug is available at 175 milligrams
per<00:00:18.960> 2<00:00:19.230> milliliters<00:00:19.830> of<00:00:19.859> solution<00:00:20.359> the

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
per 2 milliliters of solution the

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.900 
per 2 milliliters of solution the
question<00:00:21.750> is<00:00:21.869> how<00:00:22.170> many<00:00:22.230> milliliters<00:00:22.910> must

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
question is how many milliliters must

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.529 
question is how many milliliters must
the<00:00:24.330> nurse<00:00:24.510> minister<00:00:25.170> and<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:26.640> basic<00:00:26.970> idea<00:00:27.269> of

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
the nurse minister and the basic idea of

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.439 
the nurse minister and the basic idea of
any<00:00:27.930> type<00:00:28.320> of<00:00:28.349> dosage<00:00:29.070> calculation<00:00:29.670> is<00:00:29.880> you

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
any type of dosage calculation is you

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.749 
any type of dosage calculation is you
never<00:00:30.689> have<00:00:30.900> to<00:00:31.050> memorize<00:00:31.380> any<00:00:31.710> formula<00:00:32.399> if

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
never have to memorize any formula if

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.120 
never have to memorize any formula if
you<00:00:33.239> convert<00:00:33.750> your<00:00:33.780> units<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.559> correct<00:00:34.920> way

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
you convert your units the correct way

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.160 
you convert your units the correct way
then<00:00:36.030> you<00:00:36.180> never<00:00:36.329> have<00:00:36.540> to<00:00:36.690> memorize<00:00:36.960> any

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
then you never have to memorize any

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.280 
then you never have to memorize any
formula<00:00:37.649> and<00:00:38.219> this<00:00:38.430> is<00:00:38.579> what<00:00:38.700> we<00:00:38.790> like<00:00:38.940> to<00:00:38.969> call

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:39.290 
formula and this is what we like to call

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.410 
formula and this is what we like to call
dimensional<00:00:40.290> analysis<00:00:41.250> so<00:00:41.790> let<00:00:42.090> me<00:00:42.180> show<00:00:42.360> you

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
dimensional analysis so let me show you

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.660 
dimensional analysis so let me show you
what<00:00:43.050> I<00:00:43.079> mean<00:00:43.320> by<00:00:43.379> this<00:00:43.680> and<00:00:44.190> what<00:00:44.309> I<00:00:44.340> like<00:00:44.550> to

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
what I mean by this and what I like to

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.549 
what I mean by this and what I like to
do<00:00:44.820> is<00:00:45.030> always<00:00:45.480> start<00:00:45.780> with<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.050> doctor's

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
do is always start with the doctor's

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.639 
do is always start with the doctor's
orders<00:00:46.770> so<00:00:47.579> in<00:00:47.850> this<00:00:48.000> first<00:00:48.239> parentheses<00:00:48.649> I'm

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
orders so in this first parentheses I'm

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.439 
orders so in this first parentheses I'm
going<00:00:49.710> to<00:00:50.039> start<00:00:50.309> with<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.789> doctor's<00:00:51.210> orders

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
going to start with the doctor's orders

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.720 
going to start with the doctor's orders
and<00:00:51.899> it<00:00:52.289> says<00:00:52.469> in<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.680> problem<00:00:53.070> that<00:00:53.520> the

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
and it says in the problem that the

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.900 
and it says in the problem that the
doctor's<00:00:54.090> orders<00:00:54.300> are<00:00:54.750> 2<00:00:55.379> milligrams<00:00:56.160> per

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
doctor's orders are 2 milligrams per

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.819 
doctor's orders are 2 milligrams per
kilogram<00:00:57.120> of<00:00:57.719> a<00:00:58.260> drug

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
kilogram of a drug

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.399 
kilogram of a drug
so<00:00:59.730> doctor's<00:01:00.090> orders<00:01:00.390> are<00:01:00.629> 2<00:01:01.579> milligrams<00:01:03.409> per

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
so doctor's orders are 2 milligrams per

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:05.380 
so doctor's orders are 2 milligrams per
kilogram

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
kilogram

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.280 
kilogram
and<00:01:07.340> the<00:01:08.340> basic<00:01:08.700> idea<00:01:08.820> is<00:01:09.360> we<00:01:09.840> need<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:10.080> take

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
and the basic idea is we need to take

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.200 
and the basic idea is we need to take
the<00:01:10.500> doctor's<00:01:10.890> orders<00:01:11.220> and<00:01:11.850> we<00:01:11.970> need<00:01:12.119> to

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
the doctor's orders and we need to

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.350 
the doctor's orders and we need to
convert<00:01:12.570> it<00:01:12.750> into<00:01:13.049> our<00:01:13.619> final<00:01:13.890> answer<00:01:14.310> and<00:01:14.549> we

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
convert it into our final answer and we

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.539 
convert it into our final answer and we
know<00:01:15.570> that<00:01:16.140> our<00:01:16.200> final<00:01:16.560> answer<00:01:16.710> must<00:01:17.159> be<00:01:17.310> in

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
know that our final answer must be in

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.670 
know that our final answer must be in
milliliters<00:01:18.000> because<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:19.020> question<00:01:19.380> asks

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
milliliters because the question asks

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.880 
milliliters because the question asks
how<00:01:19.799> many<00:01:20.189> milliliters<00:01:21.470> must<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.680> nurse

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
how many milliliters must the nurse

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.249 
how many milliliters must the nurse
administer<00:01:23.759> so<00:01:24.479> we<00:01:24.570> need<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:24.780> convert<00:01:25.080> this

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
administer so we need to convert this

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.770 
administer so we need to convert this
milligrams<00:01:25.950> per<00:01:26.670> kilogram<00:01:26.880> which<00:01:27.540> is<00:01:27.689> the

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
milligrams per kilogram which is the

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.050 
milligrams per kilogram which is the
doctor's<00:01:28.110> orders<00:01:28.259> and<00:01:28.560> convert<00:01:29.400> it<00:01:29.520> in<00:01:29.670> some

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
doctor's orders and convert it in some

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.080 
doctor's orders and convert it in some
milliliters<00:01:30.600> and<00:01:30.840> to<00:01:31.560> do<00:01:31.710> this<00:01:31.920> I<00:01:32.159> like<00:01:32.670> to<00:01:32.820> use

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
milliliters and to do this I like to use

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.719 
milliliters and to do this I like to use
what<00:01:33.420> I<00:01:33.450> call<00:01:33.540> a<00:01:33.990> converting<00:01:34.619> tool<00:01:34.829> so<00:01:35.579> this

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
what I call a converting tool so this

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.510 
what I call a converting tool so this
blue<00:01:36.030> parenthesis<00:01:36.750> is<00:01:37.020> going<00:01:37.890> to<00:01:37.979> be<00:01:38.189> our

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
blue parenthesis is going to be our

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.899 
blue parenthesis is going to be our
converting<00:01:39.450> tool<00:01:39.600> and<00:01:39.900> you<00:01:40.890> can<00:01:41.009> use<00:01:41.280> these

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
converting tool and you can use these

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.370 
converting tool and you can use these
converting<00:01:42.360> tools<00:01:42.570> as<00:01:42.720> many<00:01:42.899> times<00:01:43.200> as

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
converting tools as many times as

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.670 
converting tools as many times as
necessary<00:01:43.729> to<00:01:44.729> solve<00:01:44.939> your<00:01:45.090> problem<00:01:45.509> and<00:01:45.689> the

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
necessary to solve your problem and the

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.340 
necessary to solve your problem and the
basic<00:01:47.009> idea<00:01:47.159> of<00:01:47.970> these<00:01:48.450> converting<00:01:48.899> tools<00:01:49.079> is

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
basic idea of these converting tools is

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.560 
basic idea of these converting tools is
to<00:01:49.619> cancel<00:01:50.009> out<00:01:50.100> your<00:01:50.220> units<00:01:50.610> so<00:01:51.149> you<00:01:51.210> arrive

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
to cancel out your units so you arrive

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.380 
to cancel out your units so you arrive
at<00:01:52.170> your<00:01:52.229> final<00:01:52.500> answer<00:01:53.130> which<00:01:53.399> we<00:01:53.579> know<00:01:53.759> must

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
at your final answer which we know must

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.990 
at your final answer which we know must
be<00:01:54.570> in<00:01:54.930> milliliters<00:01:55.680> so<00:01:56.100> we<00:01:56.520> need<00:01:56.640> to<00:01:56.729> cancel

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
be in milliliters so we need to cancel

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.050 
be in milliliters so we need to cancel
out<00:01:57.329> this<00:01:57.719> milligrams<00:01:58.350> and<00:01:58.649> kilograms<00:01:59.310> so

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
out this milligrams and kilograms so

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.929 
out this milligrams and kilograms so
we'll<00:02:00.210> start<00:02:00.509> with<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.500> milligrams<00:02:01.950> right

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
we'll start with the milligrams right

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.649 
we'll start with the milligrams right
now<00:02:03.829> milligrams<00:02:04.829> are<00:02:05.040> in<00:02:05.219> our<00:02:05.430> numerator<00:02:05.670> so

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
now milligrams are in our numerator so

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.779 
now milligrams are in our numerator so
to<00:02:06.750> cancel<00:02:07.259> them<00:02:07.380> out<00:02:07.500> I'm<00:02:07.799> going<00:02:08.520> to<00:02:08.580> put

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
to cancel them out I'm going to put

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.479 
to cancel them out I'm going to put
milligrams<00:02:09.270> in<00:02:09.509> the<00:02:09.539> denominator<00:02:09.690> of<00:02:10.530> the

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
milligrams in the denominator of the

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:14.260 
milligrams in the denominator of the
converting<00:02:12.180> tool<00:02:12.330> and<00:02:12.920> in<00:02:13.920> the

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
converting tool and in the

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:15.880 
converting tool and in the
numerator<00:02:14.510> of<00:02:14.840> the<00:02:15.080> converting<00:02:15.500> tool<00:02:15.650> I'm

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
numerator of the converting tool I'm

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.670 
numerator of the converting tool I'm
going<00:02:15.950> to<00:02:16.220> put<00:02:16.600> milliliters<00:02:17.600> this<00:02:18.170> is<00:02:18.290> because

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
going to put milliliters this is because

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.280 
going to put milliliters this is because
we<00:02:19.310> know<00:02:19.460> that<00:02:19.640> two<00:02:19.880> milliliters<00:02:20.630> of<00:02:20.840> solution

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
we know that two milliliters of solution

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.170 
we know that two milliliters of solution
is<00:02:21.830> equal<00:02:22.520> to<00:02:23.020> 175<00:02:24.020> milligrams<00:02:24.920> so<00:02:25.880> this

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
is equal to 175 milligrams so this

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.690 
is equal to 175 milligrams so this
brings<00:02:26.330> me<00:02:26.480> to<00:02:26.570> my<00:02:26.780> next<00:02:26.960> point<00:02:27.460> in<00:02:28.460> our

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
brings me to my next point in our

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.150 
brings me to my next point in our
converting<00:02:29.150> tool<00:02:29.360> the<00:02:30.170> numerator<00:02:30.560> and<00:02:30.770> the

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
converting tool the numerator and the

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.560 
converting tool the numerator and the
denominator<00:02:31.480> must<00:02:32.480> be<00:02:32.750> exactly<00:02:33.710> equal<00:02:34.300> so<00:02:35.300> we

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.570 
denominator must be exactly equal so we

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.840 
denominator must be exactly equal so we
know<00:02:35.750> from<00:02:36.260> our<00:02:36.620> problem<00:02:37.100> it<00:02:37.220> says<00:02:37.400> the<00:02:37.610> drug

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
know from our problem it says the drug

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.290 
know from our problem it says the drug
is<00:02:38.060> available<00:02:38.600> at<00:02:39.100> 175<00:02:40.100> milligrams<00:02:40.370> per<00:02:41.000> 2

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
is available at 175 milligrams per 2

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.300 
is available at 175 milligrams per 2
milliliters<00:02:41.870> of<00:02:41.900> solution<00:02:42.380> where<00:02:43.130> you<00:02:43.160> could

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
milliliters of solution where you could

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.090 
milliliters of solution where you could
say<00:02:43.460> 2<00:02:43.520> milliliters<00:02:44.300> of<00:02:44.330> solution<00:02:44.720> is<00:02:45.260> equal

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
say 2 milliliters of solution is equal

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.900 
say 2 milliliters of solution is equal
to<00:02:46.250> 175<00:02:47.180> milligrams<00:02:47.890> so<00:02:48.890> we<00:02:49.280> know<00:02:49.430> that<00:02:49.610> 2

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
to 175 milligrams so we know that 2

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.900 
to 175 milligrams so we know that 2
milliliters<00:02:50.780> of<00:02:50.810> solution<00:02:51.200> is<00:02:51.710> equal<00:02:51.890> to<00:02:52.280> 800

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
milliliters of solution is equal to 800

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.240 
milliliters of solution is equal to 800
and<00:02:53.080> 75<00:02:54.080> milligrams

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
and 75 milligrams

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.520 
and 75 milligrams
your<00:02:55.850> units<00:02:56.270> in<00:02:56.480> the<00:02:56.690> numerator<00:02:57.050> and<00:02:57.260> the

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
your units in the numerator and the

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.360 
your units in the numerator and the
denominator<00:02:57.700> must<00:02:58.700> be<00:02:58.910> exactly<00:02:59.480> equal<00:03:00.220> so<00:03:01.220> now

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
denominator must be exactly equal so now

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.520 
denominator must be exactly equal so now
notice<00:03:01.610> how<00:03:02.030> our<00:03:02.060> units<00:03:02.690> cancel<00:03:03.200> each<00:03:03.440> other

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
notice how our units cancel each other

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.830 
notice how our units cancel each other
out<00:03:03.680> our<00:03:04.070> milligrams<00:03:04.820> in<00:03:05.090> the<00:03:05.390> numerator

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
out our milligrams in the numerator

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.170 
out our milligrams in the numerator
cancel<00:03:06.650> out<00:03:06.770> with<00:03:06.980> our<00:03:07.280> milligrams<00:03:07.850> in<00:03:08.120> the

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
cancel out with our milligrams in the

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.740 
cancel out with our milligrams in the
denominator<00:03:08.630> so<00:03:09.970> moving<00:03:10.970> on<00:03:11.090> to<00:03:11.300> our<00:03:11.330> next

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
denominator so moving on to our next

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.870 
denominator so moving on to our next
step<00:03:12.080> now<00:03:12.980> we<00:03:13.040> need<00:03:13.250> to<00:03:13.310> get<00:03:13.430> rid<00:03:13.520> of<00:03:13.580> our

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
step now we need to get rid of our

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.240 
step now we need to get rid of our
kilograms<00:03:14.750> because<00:03:15.110> our<00:03:15.410> final<00:03:15.710> answer<00:03:15.920> is<00:03:15.950> in

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
kilograms because our final answer is in

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.190 
kilograms because our final answer is in
milliliters<00:03:16.790> so<00:03:16.820> this<00:03:17.360> kilograms<00:03:17.810> needs<00:03:18.110> to

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
milliliters so this kilograms needs to

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:18.760 
milliliters so this kilograms needs to
go<00:03:18.320> away

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:18.770 
go away

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:20.890 
go away
and<00:03:18.860> at<00:03:19.520> the<00:03:19.640> moment<00:03:19.820> it's<00:03:20.540> in<00:03:20.720> the

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
and at the moment it's in the

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.260 
and at the moment it's in the
denominator<00:03:21.470> so<00:03:22.250> to<00:03:22.370> get<00:03:22.610> rid<00:03:22.760> of<00:03:22.880> it<00:03:23.000> I'm

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:23.270 
denominator so to get rid of it I'm

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:26.440 
denominator so to get rid of it I'm
going<00:03:24.050> to<00:03:24.080> put<00:03:24.380> it<00:03:24.470> in<00:03:24.680> the<00:03:25.130> numerator<00:03:25.370> of<00:03:25.880> our

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
going to put it in the numerator of our

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.449 
going to put it in the numerator of our
next<00:03:26.810> converting<00:03:27.200> tool<00:03:27.350> so<00:03:27.860> now<00:03:28.040> we<00:03:28.100> have

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
next converting tool so now we have

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:32.980 
next converting tool so now we have
kilograms<00:03:29.240> in<00:03:29.990> our<00:03:30.770> numerator<00:03:30.920> and<00:03:31.750> if<00:03:32.750> we<00:03:32.840> go

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:32.990 
kilograms in our numerator and if we go

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:35.140 
kilograms in our numerator and if we go
back<00:03:33.200> to<00:03:33.680> our<00:03:33.890> problem<00:03:34.160> our<00:03:34.580> child's<00:03:35.000> weight

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
back to our problem our child's weight

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.470 
back to our problem our child's weight
is<00:03:35.360> given<00:03:35.690> to<00:03:35.840> us<00:03:35.870> in<00:03:36.230> pounds<00:03:36.920> so<00:03:37.670> in<00:03:38.030> the

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
is given to us in pounds so in the

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.120 
is given to us in pounds so in the
denominator<00:03:38.990> of<00:03:39.080> our<00:03:39.320> converting<00:03:39.709> tool<00:03:39.860> I'm

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130 
denominator of our converting tool I'm

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:44.380 
denominator of our converting tool I'm
going<00:03:40.190> to<00:03:40.850> put<00:03:41.320> pounds<00:03:42.790> so<00:03:43.790> once<00:03:43.970> again<00:03:44.090> our

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:44.390 
going to put pounds so once again our

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:46.720 
going to put pounds so once again our
units<00:03:44.870> must<00:03:45.230> be<00:03:45.350> exactly<00:03:45.830> equal<00:03:45.920> in<00:03:46.520> our

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
units must be exactly equal in our

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:48.699 
units must be exactly equal in our
converting<00:03:47.180> tool<00:03:47.330> and<00:03:48.050> we<00:03:48.170> know<00:03:48.290> that<00:03:48.500> one

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:48.709 
converting tool and we know that one

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:52.750 
converting tool and we know that one
kilogram<00:03:49.070> is<00:03:49.520> equal<00:03:49.790> to<00:03:50.180> 2.2<00:03:50.870> pounds<00:03:51.160> okay<00:03:52.160> so

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
kilogram is equal to 2.2 pounds okay so

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:58.150 
kilogram is equal to 2.2 pounds okay so
one<00:03:53.090> kilogram<00:03:53.600> is<00:03:54.020> equal<00:03:54.950> to<00:03:55.900> 2.2<00:03:56.900> pounds<00:03:57.260> your

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
one kilogram is equal to 2.2 pounds your

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.030 
one kilogram is equal to 2.2 pounds your
units<00:03:58.490> must<00:03:58.970> be<00:03:59.300> equal<00:03:59.870> in<00:04:00.110> your<00:04:00.620> converting

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 
units must be equal in your converting

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.449 
units must be equal in your converting
tool<00:04:01.570> so<00:04:02.570> now<00:04:02.690> notice<00:04:02.900> how<00:04:03.260> our<00:04:03.290> kilograms<00:04:04.160> in

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:04.459 
tool so now notice how our kilograms in

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:06.550 
tool so now notice how our kilograms in
the<00:04:04.700> numerator<00:04:05.120> cancel<00:04:05.870> out<00:04:05.990> with<00:04:06.260> the

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
the numerator cancel out with the

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.199 
the numerator cancel out with the
kilograms<00:04:07.459> in<00:04:07.730> the<00:04:08.330> denominator<00:04:09.230> and<00:04:10.209> notice

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:11.209 
kilograms in the denominator and notice

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:14.140 
kilograms in the denominator and notice
how<00:04:11.750> we<00:04:11.810> still<00:04:11.930> have<00:04:12.140> pounds<00:04:12.860> in<00:04:13.040> our<00:04:13.730> final

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.150 
how we still have pounds in our final

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:15.850 
how we still have pounds in our final
answer<00:04:14.480> and<00:04:14.720> our<00:04:14.959> final<00:04:15.170> answer<00:04:15.320> needs<00:04:15.680> to<00:04:15.770> be

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:15.860 
answer and our final answer needs to be

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:17.470 
answer and our final answer needs to be
in<00:04:16.130> milliliters<00:04:16.520> so<00:04:16.730> we<00:04:17.000> need<00:04:17.120> to<00:04:17.180> get<00:04:17.299> rid<00:04:17.419> of

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:17.480 
in milliliters so we need to get rid of

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.050 
in milliliters so we need to get rid of
these<00:04:17.630> pounds<00:04:18.080> to<00:04:18.799> do<00:04:18.950> this<00:04:19.100> we<00:04:19.669> just<00:04:19.850> need<00:04:19.970> to

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.060 
these pounds to do this we just need to

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.060 
these pounds to do this we just need to
multiply<00:04:20.239> by<00:04:20.660> the<00:04:20.720> patient's<00:04:21.169> weight<00:04:21.320> we<00:04:21.950> know

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 
multiply by the patient's weight we know

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.120 
multiply by the patient's weight we know
the<00:04:22.190> patient's<00:04:22.580> weight<00:04:22.729> is<00:04:23.000> equal<00:04:23.690> to<00:04:24.130> 97

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 
the patient's weight is equal to 97

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:27.910 
the patient's weight is equal to 97
pounds<00:04:25.580> so<00:04:26.270> if<00:04:26.450> we<00:04:26.570> multiply

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:27.920 
pounds so if we multiply

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:32.440 
pounds so if we multiply
I 97<00:04:28.670> pounds<00:04:30.220> notice<00:04:31.220> how<00:04:31.520> the<00:04:31.580> pounds<00:04:32.120> in<00:04:32.270> the

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:32.450 
I 97 pounds notice how the pounds in the

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:34.840 
I 97 pounds notice how the pounds in the
denominator<00:04:32.770> cancels<00:04:33.770> out<00:04:33.920> with<00:04:33.950> the<00:04:34.400> pounds

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:34.850 
denominator cancels out with the pounds

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:38.500 
denominator cancels out with the pounds
in<00:04:35.000> the<00:04:35.480> numerator<00:04:36.280> and<00:04:37.280> now<00:04:37.550> the<00:04:37.970> only<00:04:38.150> units

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:38.510 
in the numerator and now the only units

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:40.840 
in the numerator and now the only units
were<00:04:38.600> left<00:04:38.810> with<00:04:39.050> our<00:04:39.250> milliliters<00:04:40.250> which<00:04:40.700> is

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:40.850 
were left with our milliliters which is

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:42.430 
were left with our milliliters which is
good<00:04:41.060> because<00:04:41.300> we<00:04:41.480> know<00:04:41.660> our<00:04:41.690> final<00:04:42.140> answer

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:42.440 
good because we know our final answer

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.790 
good because we know our final answer
must<00:04:43.160> be<00:04:43.310> in<00:04:43.670> milliliters<00:04:44.450> so<00:04:45.290> the<00:04:45.470> only<00:04:45.590> thing

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800 
must be in milliliters so the only thing

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.920 
must be in milliliters so the only thing
that<00:04:45.920> we<00:04:46.010> have<00:04:46.130> to<00:04:46.220> do<00:04:46.370> is<00:04:46.610> multiply<00:04:47.240> all<00:04:47.870> of

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:47.930 
that we have to do is multiply all of

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:49.750 
that we have to do is multiply all of
the<00:04:48.380> numbers<00:04:48.410> in<00:04:48.920> the<00:04:48.980> numerator<00:04:49.250> and

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:49.760 
the numbers in the numerator and

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.670 
the numbers in the numerator and
multiply<00:04:49.820> all<00:04:50.810> of<00:04:50.840> the<00:04:50.990> numbers<00:04:51.020> in<00:04:51.290> the

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 
multiply all of the numbers in the

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.740 
multiply all of the numbers in the
denominator<00:04:52.250> so<00:04:52.490> let's<00:04:53.330> start<00:04:53.540> with<00:04:53.660> the

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:53.750 
denominator so let's start with the

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:57.280 
denominator so let's start with the
numerator<00:04:53.900> we<00:04:54.590> have<00:04:54.740> 2<00:04:55.040> times<00:04:55.820> 2<00:04:56.090> which<00:04:56.300> is<00:04:56.330> 4<00:04:56.450> 4

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:57.290 
numerator we have 2 times 2 which is 4 4

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:01.780 
numerator we have 2 times 2 which is 4 4
times<00:04:57.320> 1<00:04:57.920> which<00:04:58.640> is<00:04:58.670> 4<00:04:58.820> 4<00:04:59.750> times<00:04:59.980> 97<00:05:00.980> which<00:05:01.640> is

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:01.790 
times 1 which is 4 4 times 97 which is

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:06.820 
times 1 which is 4 4 times 97 which is
equal<00:05:02.240> to<00:05:03.760> 388<00:05:04.760> and<00:05:05.350> now<00:05:06.350> we'll<00:05:06.470> do<00:05:06.590> the<00:05:06.680> same

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:06.830 
equal to 388 and now we'll do the same

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:10.270 
equal to 388 and now we'll do the same
thing<00:05:06.890> for<00:05:07.280> the<00:05:07.400> denominator<00:05:07.880> we<00:05:08.450> have<00:05:09.280> 175

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:10.280 
thing for the denominator we have 175

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.490 
thing for the denominator we have 175
times<00:05:11.240> 2<00:05:11.570> point<00:05:11.900> 2

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:12.500 
times 2 point 2

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:15.760 
times 2 point 2
if<00:05:13.040> we<00:05:13.250> plug<00:05:13.580> this<00:05:13.820> into<00:05:14.150> our<00:05:14.720> calculator<00:05:14.960> we

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:15.770 
if we plug this into our calculator we

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:20.350 
if we plug this into our calculator we
get<00:05:17.140> 385<00:05:18.140> and<00:05:18.620> once<00:05:19.250> again<00:05:19.370> our<00:05:19.760> units<00:05:20.180> that

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:20.360 
get 385 and once again our units that

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.110 
get 385 and once again our units that
we're<00:05:20.540> left<00:05:20.660> with<00:05:20.930> are<00:05:21.160> milliliters<00:05:22.160> so<00:05:22.970> we

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:23.120 
we're left with are milliliters so we

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.860 
we're left with are milliliters so we
have<00:05:23.270> milliliters<00:05:23.930> as<00:05:24.200> our<00:05:25.160> units<00:05:25.520> and<00:05:25.760> if<00:05:26.720> we

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:26.870 
have milliliters as our units and if we

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:32.500 
have milliliters as our units and if we
simplify<00:05:27.170> this<00:05:27.700> 388<00:05:28.700> over<00:05:29.570> 385<00:05:30.170> is<00:05:31.090> 1.00<00:05:32.180> we

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:32.510 
simplify this 388 over 385 is 1.00 we

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:33.820 
simplify this 388 over 385 is 1.00 we
rounded<00:05:32.780> to<00:05:32.810> two<00:05:32.990> decimal<00:05:33.020> points<00:05:33.650> or<00:05:33.770> you

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:33.830 
rounded to two decimal points or you

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:36.190 
rounded to two decimal points or you
could<00:05:33.980> just<00:05:34.010> say<00:05:34.220> 1<00:05:34.490> so<00:05:35.360> our<00:05:35.390> final<00:05:35.660> answer<00:05:35.810> is

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:36.200 
could just say 1 so our final answer is

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:39.700 
could just say 1 so our final answer is
one<00:05:36.920> milliliter<00:05:37.930> this<00:05:38.930> is<00:05:39.170> the<00:05:39.290> answer<00:05:39.680> to

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:39.710 
one milliliter this is the answer to

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:43.150 
one milliliter this is the answer to
