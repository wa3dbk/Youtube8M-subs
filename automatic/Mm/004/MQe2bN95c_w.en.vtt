solar panels because they're doing an
awesome<00:00:22.550> job<00:00:22.940> check<00:00:23.360> this<00:00:23.450> out<00:00:23.570> guys<00:00:23.630> look<00:00:24.230> at

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.740 
awesome job check this out guys look at
how<00:00:24.619> much<00:00:24.830> electricity<00:00:25.070> that<00:00:25.640> is<00:00:25.750> generating

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:26.750 
how much electricity that is generating

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.900 
how much electricity that is generating
it's<00:00:27.350> incredible<00:00:28.750> filling<00:00:29.750> up<00:00:29.900> and<00:00:30.710> yeah<00:00:31.310> so

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:31.910 
it's incredible filling up and yeah so

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:33.400 
it's incredible filling up and yeah so
the<00:00:32.090> just<00:00:32.419> they're<00:00:32.570> doing<00:00:32.780> so<00:00:32.990> well<00:00:33.140> we're

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:33.410 
the just they're doing so well we're

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.800 
the just they're doing so well we're
taking<00:00:33.890> them<00:00:34.010> down<00:00:34.280> we're<00:00:35.180> actually<00:00:35.390> in<00:00:35.750> a

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:35.810 
taking them down we're actually in a

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:36.970 
taking them down we're actually in a
movement<00:00:36.110> because<00:00:36.290> we<00:00:36.410> don't<00:00:36.560> need<00:00:36.650> that<00:00:36.800> much

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:36.980 
movement because we don't need that much

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.220 
movement because we don't need that much
electricity<00:00:37.310> here<00:00:37.700> yet<00:00:38.079> instead<00:00:39.079> we're<00:00:39.200> going

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.230 
electricity here yet instead we're going

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:40.720 
electricity here yet instead we're going
to<00:00:39.380> put<00:00:39.500> them<00:00:39.620> over<00:00:39.770> at<00:00:40.100> the<00:00:40.310> quarry<00:00:40.579> because

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:40.730 
to put them over at the quarry because

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.000 
to put them over at the quarry because
as<00:00:41.000> you<00:00:41.150> can<00:00:41.180> obviously<00:00:41.480> tell<00:00:42.140> there's

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.010 
as you can obviously tell there's

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:44.590 
as you can obviously tell there's
nothing<00:00:43.130> moving<00:00:43.550> through<00:00:43.820> the<00:00:43.850> quarry<00:00:44.120> and<00:00:44.450> we

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:44.600 
nothing moving through the quarry and we

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.650 
nothing moving through the quarry and we
need<00:00:44.960> it<00:00:45.350> to<00:00:45.530> be<00:00:45.650> moving<00:00:46.040> and<00:00:46.330> while<00:00:47.330> he<00:00:47.480> does

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660 
need it to be moving and while he does

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.140 
need it to be moving and while he does
that<00:00:48.160> first<00:00:49.160> off<00:00:49.340> I'm<00:00:49.520> going<00:00:49.670> to<00:00:49.790> charge<00:00:50.000> my

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:50.150 
that first off I'm going to charge my

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:51.910 
that first off I'm going to charge my
chains<00:00:50.360> on<00:00:50.600> them<00:00:50.750> then<00:00:51.200> I'm<00:00:51.380> going<00:00:51.650> to<00:00:51.740> build

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
chains on them then I'm going to build

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.320 
chains on them then I'm going to build
something<00:00:52.160> called<00:00:52.430> a<00:00:52.520> distribution<00:00:53.150> pipe

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:53.330 
something called a distribution pipe

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.000 
something called a distribution pipe
because<00:00:53.660> I<00:00:53.810> noticed<00:00:54.320> that<00:00:54.530> whenever<00:00:54.650> we<00:00:54.800> have

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
because I noticed that whenever we have

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.280 
because I noticed that whenever we have
a<00:00:55.040> lot<00:00:55.310> of<00:00:55.340> stuff<00:00:55.580> coming<00:00:55.730> into<00:00:56.030> this<00:00:56.120> room<00:00:56.290> the

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:57.290 
a lot of stuff coming into this room the

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:59.020 
a lot of stuff coming into this room the
pipes<00:00:57.560> don't<00:00:57.980> actually<00:00:58.370> sort<00:00:58.670> it<00:00:58.760> into<00:00:58.940> the

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
pipes don't actually sort it into the

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.150 
pipes don't actually sort it into the
chest<00:00:59.330> you<00:00:59.720> know<00:00:59.810> evenly<00:01:00.410> so<00:01:00.950> we'll<00:01:01.070> guy

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.160 
chest you know evenly so we'll guy

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.620 
chest you know evenly so we'll guy
sticks<00:01:01.400> it<00:01:01.490> in<00:01:01.580> there<00:01:01.700> yeah<00:01:02.030> so<00:01:02.180> what<00:01:02.330> happens

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:02.630 
sticks it in there yeah so what happens

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:05.770 
sticks it in there yeah so what happens
is<00:01:02.750> will<00:01:02.930> have<00:01:03.080> backlog<00:01:03.740> on<00:01:03.950> different<00:01:04.250> oh<00:01:04.790> are

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
is will have backlog on different oh are

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.770 
is will have backlog on different oh are

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
go to solar panels just for you and I am

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.020 
go to solar panels just for you and I am
going<00:01:44.719> to<00:01:44.810> make<00:01:44.899> that<00:01:45.049> distribution<00:01:45.350> pipe<00:01:46.030> you

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
going to make that distribution pipe you

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.450 
going to make that distribution pipe you
do<00:01:47.210> that<00:01:47.530> it<00:01:48.530> will<00:01:48.710> introduce<00:01:48.979> you<00:01:49.159> fight<00:01:49.429> for

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
do that it will introduce you fight for

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:55.059 
do that it will introduce you fight for
red<00:01:49.759> sky<00:01:49.999> red<00:01:50.240> red<00:01:50.869> red<00:01:51.469> power<00:01:51.679> new<00:01:53.920> you<00:01:54.920> should

00:01:55.059 --> 00:01:55.069 
red sky red red red power new you should

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:56.260 
red sky red red red power new you should
make<00:01:55.189> a<00:01:55.219> diamond<00:01:55.429> pipe<00:01:55.639> that's<00:01:55.880> a<00:01:55.969> sorting

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
make a diamond pipe that's a sorting

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.480 
make a diamond pipe that's a sorting
pipe<00:01:56.450> yeah<00:01:57.409> but<00:01:57.560> we<00:01:57.619> don't<00:01:57.679> need<00:01:57.859> to<00:01:57.950> sort<00:01:58.189> it<00:01:58.310> I

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
pipe yeah but we don't need to sort it I
