00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:07.450 
what I'm showing you is how to apply

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:11.640 
what I'm showing you is how to apply
the<00:00:07.990> harness<00:00:08.380> to<00:00:08.800> the<00:00:08.950> pigeon<00:00:09.660> the<00:00:10.660> top<00:00:10.900> loop<00:00:11.350> I

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:11.650 
the harness to the pigeon the top loop I

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:14.459 
the harness to the pigeon the top loop I
never<00:00:12.010> undo<00:00:12.460> just<00:00:12.700> for<00:00:13.570> the<00:00:13.690> fact<00:00:13.930> of<00:00:14.110> its<00:00:14.290> ease

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:14.469 
never undo just for the fact of its ease

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:17.519 
never undo just for the fact of its ease
of<00:00:14.500> taking<00:00:15.490> off<00:00:15.640> and<00:00:15.940> the<00:00:15.970> bottom<00:00:16.900> strap<00:00:17.260> that

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:17.529 
of taking off and the bottom strap that

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:20.220 
of taking off and the bottom strap that
goes<00:00:17.590> around<00:00:17.920> the<00:00:18.160> body<00:00:18.369> of<00:00:18.580> its<00:00:18.790> of<00:00:19.270> the<00:00:19.990> bird

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:20.230 
goes around the body of its of the bird

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.689 
goes around the body of its of the bird
is<00:00:20.790> is<00:00:21.790> a<00:00:22.150> pretty<00:00:22.630> simple<00:00:22.900> mechanism<00:00:23.680> and<00:00:24.580> what

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:24.699 
is is a pretty simple mechanism and what

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:26.730 
is is a pretty simple mechanism and what
I've<00:00:24.820> done<00:00:25.000> is<00:00:25.060> I<00:00:25.480> lift<00:00:25.840> up<00:00:25.960> the<00:00:26.140> bird's<00:00:26.380> wings

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:26.740 
I've done is I lift up the bird's wings

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:29.250 
I've done is I lift up the bird's wings
to<00:00:27.340> be<00:00:27.460> able<00:00:27.550> to<00:00:27.699> get<00:00:27.820> the<00:00:27.940> straps<00:00:28.240> behind<00:00:28.810> them

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:29.260 
to be able to get the straps behind them

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:33.180 
to be able to get the straps behind them
and<00:00:30.330> I<00:00:31.330> move<00:00:31.869> all<00:00:32.050> of<00:00:32.080> the<00:00:32.320> feathers<00:00:32.680> out<00:00:32.860> from

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:33.190 
and I move all of the feathers out from

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.670 
and I move all of the feathers out from
behind<00:00:33.730> the<00:00:34.090> strap<00:00:34.360> as<00:00:34.540> much<00:00:34.720> as<00:00:34.870> possible<00:00:35.080> so

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:35.680 
behind the strap as much as possible so

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.970 
behind the strap as much as possible so
that<00:00:35.710> it<00:00:35.980> doesn't<00:00:36.280> impair<00:00:36.580> the<00:00:36.760> bird's<00:00:37.210> flight

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
that it doesn't impair the bird's flight

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.469 
that it doesn't impair the bird's flight
you<00:00:38.980> need<00:00:39.129> to<00:00:39.220> make<00:00:39.370> sure<00:00:39.400> that<00:00:39.580> that<00:00:39.909> strap<00:00:40.449> is

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:40.479 
you need to make sure that that strap is

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:44.430 
you need to make sure that that strap is
snug<00:00:41.170> not<00:00:42.040> that<00:00:42.309> it's<00:00:42.870> restricting<00:00:43.870> on<00:00:44.080> the

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:44.440 
snug not that it's restricting on the

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.539 
snug not that it's restricting on the
bird's<00:00:44.680> chest<00:00:44.860> but<00:00:45.699> also<00:00:46.330> so<00:00:46.839> that<00:00:46.870> it<00:00:47.400> this<00:00:48.400> is

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:48.549 
bird's chest but also so that it this is

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:50.490 
bird's chest but also so that it this is
not<00:00:48.670> enough<00:00:49.000> that<00:00:49.780> it's<00:00:49.989> going<00:00:50.170> to<00:00:50.260> stay<00:00:50.470> on

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:50.500 
not enough that it's going to stay on

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.070 
not enough that it's going to stay on
but<00:00:50.979> not<00:00:51.100> too<00:00:51.309> snug<00:00:51.549> that<00:00:51.610> it<00:00:51.879> impairs<00:00:52.839> its

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:53.080 
but not too snug that it impairs its

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.799 
but not too snug that it impairs its
breathing<00:00:53.610> what<00:00:54.610> I'm<00:00:54.699> doing<00:00:55.030> now<00:00:55.239> is<00:00:55.269> I'm

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:55.809 
breathing what I'm doing now is I'm

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:57.840 
breathing what I'm doing now is I'm
going<00:00:55.989> to<00:00:56.140> adjust<00:00:56.589> that<00:00:56.949> up<00:00:57.309> a<00:00:57.460> little<00:00:57.640> bit

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850 
going to adjust that up a little bit

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.039 
going to adjust that up a little bit
closer<00:00:58.150> together<00:00:58.470> so<00:00:59.470> that<00:01:00.000> it<00:01:01.000> prevents<00:01:01.989> it

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:02.049 
closer together so that it prevents it

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:04.829 
closer together so that it prevents it
from<00:01:02.199> falling<00:01:02.589> off<00:01:02.710> either<00:01:02.949> the<00:01:03.190> back<00:01:03.400> or<00:01:03.839> off

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:04.839 
from falling off either the back or off

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:08.370 
from falling off either the back or off
the<00:01:05.199> front<00:01:05.470> you'll<00:01:05.619> see<00:01:05.710> in<00:01:05.979> a<00:01:06.040> little<00:01:06.190> bit<00:01:07.380> the

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380 
the front you'll see in a little bit the

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.260 
the front you'll see in a little bit the
adjustments<00:01:08.950> that<00:01:08.979> I<00:01:09.070> make<00:01:09.340> I<00:01:09.549> go<00:01:09.850> back<00:01:10.060> and

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 
adjustments that I make I go back and

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.440 
adjustments that I make I go back and
forth<00:01:10.799> periodically<00:01:11.799> just<00:01:11.920> just<00:01:12.549> again<00:01:13.240> like

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 
forth periodically just just again like

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.590 
forth periodically just just again like
I<00:01:13.600> said<00:01:13.740> adjusting<00:01:14.740> the<00:01:14.859> feathers<00:01:15.359> this<00:01:16.359> back

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 
I said adjusting the feathers this back

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.109 
I said adjusting the feathers this back
strap<00:01:16.960> that<00:01:17.109> I'm<00:01:17.229> putting<00:01:17.469> on<00:01:17.680> right<00:01:17.859> now<00:01:18.119> is

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:19.119 
strap that I'm putting on right now is

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:21.929 
strap that I'm putting on right now is
to<00:01:19.329> attach<00:01:19.659> the<00:01:19.960> lower<00:01:20.460> strap<00:01:21.460> of<00:01:21.640> the<00:01:21.729> harness

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:21.939 
to attach the lower strap of the harness

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:24.120 
to attach the lower strap of the harness
with<00:01:22.659> the<00:01:22.689> top<00:01:23.020> of<00:01:23.200> the<00:01:23.289> strap<00:01:23.560> of<00:01:23.710> the<00:01:23.770> harness

with the top of the strap of the harness
to<00:01:24.909> to<00:01:25.810> prevent<00:01:26.229> it<00:01:26.350> from<00:01:26.380> coming<00:01:27.219> loose<00:01:27.399> over

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:28.299 
to to prevent it from coming loose over

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:31.740 
to to prevent it from coming loose over
the<00:01:28.420> bird's<00:01:28.659> head<00:01:28.810> and<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:31.329> reason<00:01:31.600> why<00:01:31.689> you

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
the bird's head and the reason why you

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.840 
the bird's head and the reason why you
don't<00:01:31.899> want<00:01:32.020> that<00:01:32.200> to<00:01:32.439> happen<00:01:32.590> is<00:01:32.920> is<00:01:33.189> if<00:01:33.729> it

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 
don't want that to happen is is if it

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.840 
don't want that to happen is is if it
does<00:01:34.030> come<00:01:34.270> off<00:01:34.409> it'll<00:01:35.409> then<00:01:35.590> it<00:01:36.100> could<00:01:36.310> end<00:01:36.700> up

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 
does come off it'll then it could end up

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:38.730 
does come off it'll then it could end up
tangling<00:01:37.329> up<00:01:37.479> on<00:01:37.659> the<00:01:37.780> birds<00:01:37.990> legs<00:01:38.350> and

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 
tangling up on the birds legs and

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.029 
tangling up on the birds legs and
preventing<00:01:39.640> them<00:01:39.729> from<00:01:39.759> landing<00:01:41.039> that's

00:01:42.029 --> 00:01:42.039 
preventing them from landing that's

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:44.160 
preventing them from landing that's
that's<00:01:42.700> pretty<00:01:43.030> bad<00:01:43.240> when<00:01:43.479> a<00:01:43.749> bird<00:01:43.960> doesn't

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170 
that's pretty bad when a bird doesn't

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.060 
that's pretty bad when a bird doesn't
have<00:01:44.409> any<00:01:44.560> legs<00:01:44.710> to<00:01:45.460> land<00:01:46.289> I'm<00:01:47.289> using<00:01:47.649> a<00:01:47.829> safety

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
have any legs to land I'm using a safety

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.190 
have any legs to land I'm using a safety
pin<00:01:48.340> right<00:01:48.579> now<00:01:48.729> just<00:01:48.999> for<00:01:49.149> the<00:01:49.270> ease<00:01:49.450> of<00:01:49.479> the

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
pin right now just for the ease of the

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.340 
pin right now just for the ease of the
adjustability<00:01:50.829> of<00:01:51.189> it<00:01:51.340> and<00:01:52.020> then<00:01:53.020> what<00:01:53.229> I<00:01:53.259> do

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
adjustability of it and then what I do

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.100 
adjustability of it and then what I do
is<00:01:53.609> just

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
is just

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.290 
is just
I<00:01:55.170> push<00:01:56.040> its<00:01:56.220> feet<00:01:56.430> up<00:01:56.580> to<00:01:56.760> make<00:01:56.880> sure<00:01:57.090> that

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:57.300 
I push its feet up to make sure that

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.930 
I push its feet up to make sure that
it's<00:01:57.530> out<00:01:58.530> of<00:01:58.620> the<00:01:58.890> way<00:01:59.040> of<00:01:59.190> its<00:01:59.370> fee<00:01:59.580> so<00:01:59.790> it

00:01:59.930 --> 00:01:59.940 
it's out of the way of its fee so it

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.750 
it's out of the way of its fee so it
doesn't<00:02:00.210> get<00:02:00.330> caught<00:02:00.570> with<00:02:01.560> this<00:02:01.740> camera<00:02:02.220> when

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:02.760 
doesn't get caught with this camera when

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.400 
doesn't get caught with this camera when
I<00:02:02.820> when<00:02:03.420> I<00:02:03.450> slide<00:02:03.780> it<00:02:03.930> in<00:02:04.080> you're<00:02:04.260> going<00:02:04.350> to

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:04.410 
I when I slide it in you're going to

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:06.200 
I when I slide it in you're going to
notice<00:02:04.710> it's<00:02:04.920> a<00:02:04.980> little<00:02:05.310> bit<00:02:05.460> high<00:02:05.730> it<00:02:06.030> looks

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
notice it's a little bit high it looks

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.109 
notice it's a little bit high it looks
like<00:02:06.330> it's<00:02:06.570> impairing<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:07.920> bird's<00:02:08.190> flight

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
like it's impairing the bird's flight

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.290 
like it's impairing the bird's flight
vision<00:02:09.780> but<00:02:10.350> it's<00:02:10.530> not<00:02:10.910> when<00:02:11.910> the<00:02:12.060> birds

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
vision but it's not when the birds

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.370 
vision but it's not when the birds
flying<00:02:12.660> level<00:02:13.760> it's<00:02:14.760> looking<00:02:15.240> more<00:02:15.780> out<00:02:16.020> than

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
flying level it's looking more out than

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.000 
flying level it's looking more out than
it<00:02:16.530> is<00:02:16.680> down<00:02:17.100> and<00:02:17.610> you'll<00:02:18.270> notice<00:02:18.510> that<00:02:19.010> that

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
it is down and you'll notice that that

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.710 
it is down and you'll notice that that
the<00:02:20.250> beak<00:02:20.550> and<00:02:20.760> stuff<00:02:21.060> won't<00:02:21.209> get<00:02:21.420> in<00:02:21.510> the<00:02:21.540> way

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
the beak and stuff won't get in the way

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.540 
the beak and stuff won't get in the way
as<00:02:21.900> soon<00:02:22.050> as<00:02:22.110> that<00:02:22.290> blue<00:02:22.560> light<00:02:22.800> turns<00:02:23.040> on<00:02:23.370> is

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
as soon as that blue light turns on is

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.340 
as soon as that blue light turns on is
when<00:02:23.700> they<00:02:23.850> start<00:02:24.360> recording<00:02:24.840> and<00:02:24.959> I'll<00:02:25.050> have

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
when they start recording and I'll have

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.030 
when they start recording and I'll have
another<00:02:25.620> video<00:02:26.100> pop<00:02:26.550> up<00:02:26.820> and<00:02:27.090> you'll<00:02:27.990> see<00:02:28.050> see

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
it's resort's results and what I do is I

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.030 
it's resort's results and what I do is I
put<00:02:32.459> the<00:02:32.580> bird<00:02:32.790> in<00:02:32.970> my<00:02:33.120> hand<00:02:33.510> at<00:02:33.780> first<00:02:34.380> just<00:02:34.920> to

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
put the bird in my hand at first just to

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.670 
put the bird in my hand at first just to
see<00:02:35.190> if<00:02:35.310> it<00:02:35.430> can<00:02:35.520> take<00:02:35.760> off<00:02:35.940> flight<00:02:36.360> from<00:02:36.720> from

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
see if it can take off flight from from

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.150 
see if it can take off flight from from
me<00:02:37.860> first<00:02:38.310> and<00:02:38.660> what<00:02:39.660> happened<00:02:40.080> is<00:02:40.290> is<00:02:40.620> I

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
me first and what happened is is I

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.340 
me first and what happened is is I
didn't<00:02:41.459> get<00:02:41.550> that<00:02:41.760> bottom<00:02:42.660> strap<00:02:42.959> up<00:02:43.170> high

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
didn't get that bottom strap up high

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.830 
didn't get that bottom strap up high
enough<00:02:43.620> so<00:02:43.890> the<00:02:44.459> bird<00:02:44.640> crash-land<00:02:45.239> that's<00:02:45.660> why

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
enough so the bird crash-land that's why

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.479 
enough so the bird crash-land that's why
I<00:02:45.870> don't<00:02:46.050> throw<00:02:46.320> them<00:02:46.380> up<00:02:46.590> right<00:02:47.220> at<00:02:47.459> the

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
I don't throw them up right at the

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:49.670 
I don't throw them up right at the
beginning<00:02:47.640> is<00:02:48.060> because<00:02:49.020> I<00:02:49.050> want<00:02:49.290> to<00:02:49.350> make<00:02:49.500> sure

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
beginning is because I want to make sure

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.080 
beginning is because I want to make sure
that<00:02:49.860> the<00:02:49.980> harness<00:02:50.190> is<00:02:50.520> is<00:02:50.670> adjusted

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
that the harness is is adjusted

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.110 
that the harness is is adjusted
correctly<00:02:51.270> so<00:02:52.260> I've<00:02:52.410> removed<00:02:52.860> the<00:02:53.400> legs<00:02:53.820> I

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
correctly so I've removed the legs I

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.510 
correctly so I've removed the legs I
adjust<00:02:54.630> it<00:02:54.810> up<00:02:54.930> a<00:02:55.050> little<00:02:55.230> bit<00:02:55.410> higher<00:02:55.650> as<00:02:55.920> in<00:02:56.370> I

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
adjust it up a little bit higher as in I

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.580 
adjust it up a little bit higher as in I
put<00:02:56.790> the<00:02:56.970> harness<00:02:57.480> a<00:02:57.600> little<00:02:57.840> bit<00:02:57.959> closer<00:02:58.290> up

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
put the harness a little bit closer up

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.800 
put the harness a little bit closer up
to<00:02:58.739> its<00:02:58.890> head<00:02:59.100> and<00:02:59.340> then<00:02:59.940> I<00:03:00.000> tighten<00:03:00.420> up<00:03:00.630> that

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
to its head and then I tighten up that

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.110 
to its head and then I tighten up that
strap<00:03:01.260> to<00:03:01.560> prevent<00:03:01.709> the<00:03:02.160> foot<00:03:02.519> from<00:03:02.820> being

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
strap to prevent the foot from being

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.380 
strap to prevent the foot from being
able<00:03:03.239> to<00:03:03.390> fit<00:03:04.170> in<00:03:04.350> in<00:03:04.830> between<00:03:05.700> the<00:03:06.150> harness

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
able to fit in in between the harness

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.010 
able to fit in in between the harness
and

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:15.720 

between<00:03:11.020> the<00:03:11.140> harness<00:03:11.350> and<00:03:11.770> the<00:03:12.520> bird

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.339 

and<00:03:16.730> then<00:03:16.939> once<00:03:17.209> that's<00:03:17.510> happened<00:03:17.659> you<00:03:18.170> can

00:03:18.339 --> 00:03:18.349 
and then once that's happened you can

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:21.520 
and then once that's happened you can
let<00:03:19.189> the<00:03:19.310> bird<00:03:19.519> go<00:03:19.760> and<00:03:20.090> fly<00:03:20.420> and<00:03:20.689> know<00:03:21.230> that<00:03:21.379> it

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
let the bird go and fly and know that it

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.309 
let the bird go and fly and know that it
will<00:03:21.560> be<00:03:21.650> able<00:03:21.920> to<00:03:22.099> make<00:03:22.250> it<00:03:22.400> home<00:03:22.579> as<00:03:23.420> its

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:24.319 
will be able to make it home as its

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:25.839 
will be able to make it home as its
flying<00:03:24.560> down<00:03:24.769> this<00:03:24.920> canyon<00:03:25.459> island<00:03:25.760> just

00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:25.849 
flying down this canyon island just

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:28.300 
flying down this canyon island just
thought<00:03:26.030> I'd<00:03:26.150> let<00:03:26.299> you<00:03:26.360> know<00:03:26.480> that<00:03:27.069> we<00:03:28.069> hiked

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
thought I'd let you know that we hiked

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.970 
thought I'd let you know that we hiked

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
this this is actually Mount Baldy in

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.030 
this this is actually Mount Baldy in
Orem<00:03:33.980> Utah<00:03:34.099> and<00:03:34.870> it<00:03:35.870> took<00:03:36.109> us<00:03:36.319> an<00:03:36.590> hour<00:03:36.799> and<00:03:36.950> a

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
Orem Utah and it took us an hour and a

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.130 
Orem Utah and it took us an hour and a
half<00:03:37.189> to<00:03:37.340> get<00:03:37.459> to<00:03:37.579> the<00:03:37.700> top<00:03:37.909> and<00:03:38.209> you'll<00:03:38.780> see

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140 
half to get to the top and you'll see

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.490 
half to get to the top and you'll see
well<00:03:40.010> I've<00:03:40.970> edited<00:03:41.269> this<00:03:41.750> to<00:03:42.019> keep<00:03:42.319> it

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
well I've edited this to keep it

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.449 
well I've edited this to keep it
somewhat<00:03:43.129> entertaining<00:03:44.680> and<00:03:45.680> then<00:03:46.040> I<00:03:46.069> add<00:03:46.280> my

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459 
somewhat entertaining and then I add my

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:49.059 
somewhat entertaining and then I add my
voice<00:03:46.670> so<00:03:46.939> that's<00:03:47.120> kind<00:03:47.329> of<00:03:47.390> a<00:03:47.980> defeating<00:03:48.980> the

00:03:49.059 --> 00:03:49.069 
voice so that's kind of a defeating the

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:52.750 
voice so that's kind of a defeating the
purpose<00:03:49.220> anyway<00:03:49.730> as<00:03:50.359> it<00:03:51.319> flies<00:03:51.560> down<00:03:51.920> I'll<00:03:52.280> cut

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
purpose anyway as it flies down I'll cut

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.460 
purpose anyway as it flies down I'll cut
into<00:03:53.030> the<00:03:53.120> neighborhood<00:03:53.569> it<00:03:53.780> took<00:03:54.019> the<00:03:54.230> bird

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:54.470 
into the neighborhood it took the bird

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:57.670 
into the neighborhood it took the bird
only<00:03:55.629> four<00:03:56.629> and<00:03:56.750> a<00:03:56.780> half<00:03:56.810> minutes<00:03:57.349> to<00:03:57.440> make<00:03:57.650> it

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
only four and a half minutes to make it

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.460 
only four and a half minutes to make it
home<00:03:57.980> from<00:03:58.159> the<00:03:58.280> top<00:03:58.489> of<00:03:58.639> Mount<00:03:58.760> Baldy<00:03:59.000> and<00:03:59.470> of

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 
home from the top of Mount Baldy and of

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:02.349 
home from the top of Mount Baldy and of
course<00:04:00.889> it<00:04:01.040> took<00:04:01.189> us<00:04:01.370> a<00:04:01.489> lot<00:04:01.609> longer<00:04:01.790> I<00:04:02.030> wish<00:04:02.209> I

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:02.359 
course it took us a lot longer I wish I

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:06.699 
course it took us a lot longer I wish I
had<00:04:02.540> wings<00:04:02.750> to<00:04:03.019> fly<00:04:03.139> home<00:04:03.409> and<00:04:05.109> anyway<00:04:06.109> as<00:04:06.290> it

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:06.709 
had wings to fly home and anyway as it
