00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.359
 do not 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.480
 what but it is already we are other 

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:10.040
 commenting on another gameplay that the 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.690
 wheats 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:16.330
 let's see how this fucking game comes out 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:18.070
 I already tried to play quietly played 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:20.410
 another thing in none comes out good 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:23.020
 I always walk badly and it's been a while 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:24.610
 not walked that day little while ago but it 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:27.040
 pro 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:30.070
 or seven more casualties if I got a burn 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:32.620
 but out there as always they see you go 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:35.860
 well and something and you always get two of 

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:38.730
 three fists and never after 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.730
 do nothing then 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:47.300
 we are going to be this weapon we are never going to 

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:50.180
 assemble metal x we ​​know how to approve it 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.040
 let's see how to use this game I have 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.960
 to win even if there are not several 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:57.790
 I lose and I lose and I lose and I'm 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.790
 cleaning is not there anymore 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:01.070
 I'm not liking 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.610
 so far we're fine let's go well 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.610
 until now 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.190
 okay 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:16.180
 here is the point always grab this 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:18.640
 point the point always grab your area 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:22.799
 control that area and that nobody enters 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.799
 nobody comes out and it's all perfect 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:27.360
 how that finger trembles to point 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.360
 way 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.939
 is that I'm afraid to move more that 

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:33.939
 little hand and let me go 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:42.370
 I do not know where I am or what 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.370
 call was already well-informed that no 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.350
 by active solidarity 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:56.040
 and flash 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:58.790
 I want to see someone here I'm almost 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.790
 sure you will see 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:04.490
 Corrida x8 runs always fled the place 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:07.430
 where they killed someone run 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.179
 of another and braver and if you are going to 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.890
 break 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.700
 I always leave them more red than 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.700
 a tomato, yes 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:23.200
 We are starting to get something or 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.200
 something hardcore if we are going to see 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.820
 new 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.000
 but it's always going to come out here 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:35.290
 güey someone so leave my turret 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.290
 It is the custom order 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.959
 in the city 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.730
 well here I will look at what I was going to see 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.730
 someone 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:50.640
 and this is so hard to climb 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.550
 if someone comes 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.730
 do not 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.420
 run chick cortez here run 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.420
 run through the proto 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:13.690
 it's not always to be the spoilers 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.690
 never miss those children 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.260
 How is it possible 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.819

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:32.170

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:34.110

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:36.730
 he answers these responsos 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:39.310
 incredibly 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:41.480
 good although when you appear next 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:43.760
 of someone is 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:48.099
 horrible but as long as they appear next 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.099

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:54.550

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:25.650
 I'm liking this weapon is 

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:25.650
 liking is the sub class more chingón 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.229

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:39.740

00:04:52.249 --> 00:04:57.260
