of<00:00:51.570> chalking<00:00:52.140> as'<00:00:52.289> in<00:00:52.530> these<00:00:52.710> eyeshadows

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980

pigmentation<00:00:55.379> I<00:00:55.739> did<00:00:56.160> have<00:00:56.309> to<00:00:56.460> apply<00:00:56.760> a

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
pigmentation I did have to apply a

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.819 
pigmentation I did have to apply a
couple<00:00:57.090> of<00:00:57.329> them<00:00:57.480> wet<00:00:57.809> in<00:00:58.109> this<00:00:58.350> look<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:58.739> get

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
couple of them wet in this look to get

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.189 
couple of them wet in this look to get
them<00:00:59.010> to<00:00:59.129> be<00:00:59.250> really<00:00:59.760> vibrant<00:01:00.059> once<00:01:00.899> you<00:01:01.020> did

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
them to be really vibrant once you did

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.630 
them to be really vibrant once you did
that<00:01:01.379> though<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.920> eyeshadows<00:01:02.460> are

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
that though the eyeshadows are

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.070 
that though the eyeshadows are
absolutely<00:01:03.359> awesome

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
absolutely awesome

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.980 
absolutely awesome
in<00:01:04.260> terms<00:01:04.650> of<00:01:04.860> pigmentation<00:01:05.549> now<00:01:06.330> in<00:01:06.689> my

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
in terms of pigmentation now in my

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.580 
in terms of pigmentation now in my
opinion<00:01:07.460> this<00:01:08.460> is<00:01:08.520> a<00:01:08.670> palette<00:01:09.240> that<00:01:09.470> would<00:01:10.470> be

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
opinion this is a palette that would be

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.190 
opinion this is a palette that would be
best<00:01:10.890> combined<00:01:11.580> with<00:01:11.909> other<00:01:12.210> palettes<00:01:12.810> so<00:01:13.110> if

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
best combined with other palettes so if

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.050 
best combined with other palettes so if
you<00:01:13.350> have<00:01:13.530> a<00:01:13.560> lot<00:01:13.830> of<00:01:13.979> neutrals<00:01:14.700> in<00:01:14.939> your

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
you have a lot of neutrals in your

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.120 
you have a lot of neutrals in your
collection<00:01:15.420> this<00:01:16.049> is<00:01:16.110> a<00:01:16.229> great<00:01:16.320> one<00:01:16.650> to<00:01:16.799> add<00:01:16.830> in

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
collection this is a great one to add in

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.770 
collection this is a great one to add in
because<00:01:17.490> you<00:01:17.640> can<00:01:17.820> pick<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:18.180> choose<00:01:18.270> colors

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
because you can pick and choose colors

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.390 
because you can pick and choose colors
from<00:01:18.990> it<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:19.259> mix<00:01:19.439> it<00:01:19.590> in<00:01:19.710> with<00:01:19.799> your<00:01:19.860> neutrals

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
from it and mix it in with your neutrals

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.969 
from it and mix it in with your neutrals
that<00:01:20.909> is<00:01:21.030> how<00:01:21.210> I<00:01:21.390> personally<00:01:22.110> would<00:01:22.470> wear<00:01:22.770> it

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
that is how I personally would wear it

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.260 
that is how I personally would wear it
and<00:01:23.159> this<00:01:23.369> will<00:01:23.490> make<00:01:23.729> it<00:01:23.850> a<00:01:23.970> little<00:01:24.119> bit

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
and this will make it a little bit

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.840 
and this will make it a little bit
easier<00:01:24.720> to<00:01:24.750> wear<00:01:25.110> on<00:01:25.590> an<00:01:25.740> everyday<00:01:25.830> basis<00:01:26.520> so

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
easier to wear on an everyday basis so

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.310 
easier to wear on an everyday basis so
