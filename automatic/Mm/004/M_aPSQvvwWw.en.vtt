to be here today my name is John
Thornton<00:00:46.820> I'm<00:00:46.970> from<00:00:47.360> the<00:00:47.570> Chicagoland<00:00:48.530> area

Thornton I'm from the Chicagoland area

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.530 
Thornton I'm from the Chicagoland area
and<00:00:49.280> I'm<00:00:49.730> going<00:00:49.880> to<00:00:49.910> talk<00:00:50.180> a<00:00:50.210> little<00:00:50.390> about

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:50.540 
and I'm going to talk a little about

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.620 
and I'm going to talk a little about
mass<00:00:50.960> airflow<00:00:51.700> Diagnostics<00:00:52.700> and<00:00:52.910> you<00:00:53.420> know<00:00:53.510> if

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:53.630 
mass airflow Diagnostics and you know if

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:55.330 
mass airflow Diagnostics and you know if
you<00:00:53.720> look<00:00:53.840> at<00:00:53.960> a<00:00:53.989> mass<00:00:54.230> airflow<00:00:54.559> I<00:00:55.070> think

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:55.340 
you look at a mass airflow I think

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.880 
you look at a mass airflow I think
everyone<00:00:55.820> would<00:00:55.970> agree<00:00:56.120> that<00:00:56.830> diagnosing<00:00:57.830> the

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 
everyone would agree that diagnosing the

everyone would agree that diagnosing the
mass<00:00:58.070> airflow<00:00:58.370> is<00:00:58.730> a<00:00:58.760> little<00:00:58.940> bit<00:00:59.030> more

00:00:59.170 --> 00:00:59.180 
mass airflow is a little bit more

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.450 
mass airflow is a little bit more
challenging<00:00:59.720> than<00:00:59.840> diagnosing<00:01:00.440> a<00:01:00.530> TPS<00:01:01.100> or<00:01:01.400> a

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
challenging than diagnosing a TPS or a

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.880 
challenging than diagnosing a TPS or a
coolant<00:01:02.120> temp<00:01:02.330> sensor<00:01:02.390> would<00:01:02.750> you<00:01:02.870> agree<00:01:02.989> and

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 
coolant temp sensor would you agree and

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:05.499 
coolant temp sensor would you agree and
there's<00:01:04.160> a<00:01:04.190> lot<00:01:04.339> of<00:01:04.490> variability<00:01:05.059> when

the lower return is it isn't compared to
the<00:01:53.900> ground<00:01:54.170> thank<00:01:54.530> you

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:55.119 
the ground thank you

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:57.880 
the ground thank you
agreed<00:01:56.150> if<00:01:56.360> it<00:01:56.840> doesn't<00:01:57.229> compare<00:01:57.560> it<00:01:57.710> to<00:01:57.799> the

agreed if it doesn't compare it to the

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.219 
agreed if it doesn't compare it to the
ground<00:01:58.100> why<00:01:58.580> would<00:01:58.880> we<00:01:59.090> put<00:01:59.360> our<00:01:59.510> scope<00:01:59.930> leader

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
ground why would we put our scope leader

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:03.219 
ground why would we put our scope leader
meter<00:02:00.650> lead<00:02:00.950> on<00:02:01.159> the<00:02:01.520> block<00:02:01.760> agreed<00:02:02.210> now<00:02:03.020> don't

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
meter lead on the block agreed now don't

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:04.810 
meter lead on the block agreed now don't
get<00:02:03.320> me<00:02:03.439> wrong<00:02:03.470> there<00:02:03.920> are<00:02:03.950> some<00:02:04.340> mass<00:02:04.520> airflow

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
get me wrong there are some mass airflow

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.490 
get me wrong there are some mass airflow
sensors<00:02:05.360> out<00:02:05.510> there<00:02:05.540> and<00:02:05.900> that's<00:02:05.990> some<00:02:06.320> there

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
sensors out there and that's some there

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.289 
sensors out there and that's some there
are<00:02:06.560> a<00:02:06.590> number<00:02:06.770> of<00:02:06.890> mass<00:02:07.130> air<00:02:07.310> flows<00:02:07.580> that<00:02:08.090> the

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:08.299 
are a number of mass air flows that the

00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:10.270 
are a number of mass air flows that the
