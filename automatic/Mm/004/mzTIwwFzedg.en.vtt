00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:13.370
 hello to all guys with the review 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:16.760
 today I wanted to introduce you the model 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:19.939
 miur della della camer bach this mine 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:22.340
 backpack and a diary 3 isa unused 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:24.349
 not only in mountain biking 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:27.770
 but for this year by brand producing 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:28.759
 a series of backpacks for different types 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:30.800
 of use 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:33.140
 regarding miur model 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.899
 here you see in the video it is a 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:39.800
 2010 model so it's a backpack that 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:42.109
 I have for some time that I used 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.359
 really but really much and consider 

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:46.250
 which has also been washed many many in 

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:48.679
 washing machine and therefore in spite of everything 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.320
 this you can see how it is anyway 

00:00:48.679 --> 00:00:53.120
 still in excellent condition in excellent condition 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.309
 clearly then I will talk to you about 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.410
 model you see in the video though 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:59.899
 let's say finally of the video is to 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:02.149
 actually present you this backpack that 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:04.699
 over the years it has gone more and more 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:06.560
 improving in all his 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:08.630
 features which are the 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.940
 characteristics of this backpack and what 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.950
 makes it truly unique and above all e 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.820
 with an article that is treated in the least 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.770
 details 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.619
 so how can you see the same 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:21.130
 stitching or hard material used 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:24.350
 really a lot and it's really a lot 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:27.439
 resistant this backpack with are 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:30.320
 backpacks that the miur model is one of 

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:33.829
 backpacks that I recommend but for those who make 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:36.049
 bike tours that last anyway 

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:37.430
 no more than a certain amount of time in the sense yes 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:39.049
 enough exits appeared 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:42.350
 long ranging from the two three four 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:44.689
 hours even more is a backpack that thanks to 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.750
 its ten liters of internal capacity 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:50.180
 lets you bring different things to his 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.130
 internal so it is really very useful for 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:55.369
 of the exits in which we need to 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:57.229
 bring different items with us 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:59.240
 calling perhaps from bosses of 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:01.509
 apparel gear that we can 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.070
 serve in case of bike problems 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:06.229
 the other feature of this backpacks e 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.780
 what I repeat are really taken care of in the 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:11.120
 detail as you can see here in the 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.970
 higher part of the backpack there is a 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.680
 small pocket that is still present on the 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.710
 newer models that is completely 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.140
 waterproof 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:22.080
 waterproof then them inside 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:25.170
 you can go to insert quietly 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:28.230
 of the mobile phones of all that should not 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.840
 absolutely contact with 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.880
 water in this case so you can 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:36.300
 see how we face the 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:38.580
 model nv and there is a model that has the 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:41.160
 more features than the 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:45.030
 basic model you can first see 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:48.000
 as opening in the part then below 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:51.390
 this this pocket and pulling comes 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.490
 out practically a cover with the 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:56.280
 which we can cover in case of 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:58.680
 rain the whole 20 rosanero so if 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.020
 I feel this here going to open it 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:04.530
 we go to cover the whole backpack 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:07.290
 so this is already a very useful thing 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.210
 because it happened to me personally 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.010
 find myself in the rain and then have 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:13.410
 this possibility to protect it 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.690
 backpack and everything inside 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:18.570
 a really useful thing clearly then 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:21.510
 we have within the same la 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:23.280
 possibility of having a practicality of 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.740
 use in the sense that in the pocket more 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.230
 external we can have different pockets 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:30.540
 then still inside of that 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.800
 more external where we can insert all 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.660
 the tools we need 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:37.140
 so the attention to detail we have 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:39.600
 also hooks to attach the keys 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:43.170
 so they are really really backpacks 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:45.990
 very very well cared for which is the other one 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.250
 feature also makes this unique 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:49.680
 this backpack 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:52.160
 we said it's a backpack that comes 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:55.590
 not much used for excursions 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:57.570
 quite long enough clearly 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:00.870
 a bit also for its weight in the sense 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:03.390
 that this backpack still weighs a kilo 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:05.790
 and 200 grams including water bag 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:07.920
 so do some more exits 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.840
 short we're going to buy a backpack that 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.390
 it will be a little lighter just because 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:15.270
 we won't need so many tricks 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:17.790
 of which admonished the minute model of the 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:19.920
 indeed campbell bach posed 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:22.260
 you can see how this was 

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:25.200
 specially designed for exits 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.889
 more more demanding then more 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:29.199
 clearly demanding 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:33.639
 when we go there by bike one of the areas 

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:35.740
 more than warm up with a backpack on 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:37.689
 shoulders clearly back therefore 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:40.449
 what they thought to do with 

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:42.639
 create a special backrest that 

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:44.830
 not only allowed perspiration 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:45.969
 so you can see how the areas of 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.830
 contact 

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:50.800
 they are limited and at the center there is a 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:53.349
 diary passage to refresh precisely 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:56.529
 the back but at the same time in this 

00:04:53.349 --> 00:04:59.770
 model is equipped with one of a body 

00:04:56.529 --> 00:05:03.189
 then underneath a shell enough 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:05.529
 stiff that not only from rigidity to the 

00:05:03.189 --> 00:05:08.259
 to the backpack itself but protects 

00:05:05.529 --> 00:05:10.319
 clearly also the biker from any 

00:05:08.259 --> 00:05:12.610
 falls because it is a body 

00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:16.000
 quite stiff enough hard to 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:18.310
 allow a protection 1 of 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.129
 of the fundamental characteristics of 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:23.289
 this zain air that I could try to 

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:27.189
 person and the capacity for isolation 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:28.779
 thermal that goes from what is between the area 

00:05:27.189 --> 00:05:31.060
 of the back then the area where we 

00:05:28.779 --> 00:05:33.550
 then support the back and the area then 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:36.550
 the underlying bag where we go to 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:39.039
 insert our dl bag 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:42.909
 water then the water pocket vi 

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:46.089
 I can really confirm it as well 

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:49.659
 in the hottest summer days 

00:05:46.089 --> 00:05:52.000
 water bag remains very isolated from the 

00:05:49.659 --> 00:05:55.689
 both from the outside and from our own 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.819
 ev back and I always make sure to to 

00:05:55.689 --> 00:05:59.819
 experience therefore for proven experience 

00:05:57.819 --> 00:06:02.889
 that the water inside remains 

00:05:59.819 --> 00:06:03.219
 pretty cool for for long 

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:04.870
 time 

00:06:03.219 --> 00:06:08.020
 another point in favor of this backpack 

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:10.990
 it is certainly the convenience of use is 

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:14.199
 a backpack that is once set with 

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:17.620
 the special straps you see of which 

00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:19.319
 a backpack is warned in several places 

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:23.289
 really very comfortable so too 

00:06:19.319 --> 00:06:26.289
 to hold him on his shoulder for many hours not not 

00:06:23.289 --> 00:06:28.360
 absolutely annoys the biker 

00:06:26.289 --> 00:06:31.689
 consider that it clearly has both 

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:34.230
 thorax straps then a 

00:06:31.689 --> 00:06:37.470
 level of not only level 

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:40.170
 but also at the level of the where from 

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:41.130
 we find these the other five then a 

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:43.860
 level and abdomen 

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:46.440
 therefore once you have set both 

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:48.990
 on him and also very very stable 

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:50.670
 then consider in the descent in 

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:53.640
 mountain bikes you will have a backpack that 

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:56.610
 however it will always remain very adherent 

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:59.340
 to the body and therefore it is comfortable and not 

00:06:56.610 --> 00:07:02.850
 only during the climbs but also a lot 

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:04.410
 therefore during the descents more then 

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:07.470
 I presented this model to you 

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:09.570
 I repeat, it's a 2010 model though 

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:12.060
 clearly the characteristics of the 

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:14.220
 minion model of the came back are not 

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:16.140
 always the same then clearly i 

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:19.650
 designs change are added 

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:21.920
 of the extra details, however, I repeat the 

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:25.020
 quality of the backpack anyway 

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:27.060
 excellent therefore if you are thinking maybe 

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:29.460
 when buying a backpack 

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:31.670
 I really think it appropriate 

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:34.920
 recommend this model because 

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:38.940
 I repeat it is really a very very product 

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:41.460
 valid and that I recommend to anyone 

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:44.090
 therefore I greet you and refer you to the 

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:44.090
 next video
