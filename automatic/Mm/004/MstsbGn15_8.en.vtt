what is the difference in the mark 1 and
the<00:00:24.029> mark<00:00:24.240> 2<00:00:24.539> so<00:00:25.109> if<00:00:25.320> you<00:00:25.410> could<00:00:25.560> a<00:00:25.650> snow

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
the mark 2 so if you could a snow

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.900 
the mark 2 so if you could a snow
that'll<00:00:26.310> be<00:00:26.369> great<00:00:26.900> so<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:28.349> hgj<00:00:29.130> 2000s<00:00:29.820> have

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
that'll be great so the hgj 2000s have

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:30.950

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
around here the connector is just like

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.190 
around here the connector is just like
before<00:00:46.829> and<00:00:47.370> mini<00:00:47.579> XLR<00:00:48.210> so<00:00:48.539> this<00:00:48.690> very<00:00:48.989> easily

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
before and mini XLR so this very easily

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.270 
before and mini XLR so this very easily

cord and both of them have a 90 degree
angle<00:01:01.199> plug<00:01:01.920> right<00:01:02.190> here<00:01:02.250> so<00:01:03.000> that<00:01:03.180> way<00:01:03.329> it

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
angle plug right here so that way it

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.359 
angle plug right here so that way it
doesn't<00:01:03.660> stand<00:01:03.989> out<00:01:04.199> that<00:01:04.260> much<00:01:04.470> so

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
doesn't stand out that much so

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:06.770 
doesn't stand out that much so
especially<00:01:05.549> if<00:01:05.880> you're<00:01:06.090> like<00:01:06.240> a<00:01:06.270> turntable

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
especially if you're like a turntable

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.570 
especially if you're like a turntable
list<00:01:07.020> or<00:01:07.229> so<00:01:07.409> this<00:01:07.799> is<00:01:07.950> not<00:01:08.100> going<00:01:08.280> to<00:01:08.340> be<00:01:08.460> in

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
list or so this is not going to be in

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.270 
list or so this is not going to be in
your<00:01:08.729> way<00:01:08.880> so<00:01:08.909> much<00:01:09.409> there's<00:01:10.409> more<00:01:10.740> memory

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
your way so much there's more memory

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
50 millimeter drivers improved sound

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.420 
50 millimeter drivers improved sound
quality<00:01:18.210> on<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.540> drivers<00:01:19.009> because<00:01:20.009> of

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
quality on the drivers because of

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.010 
quality on the drivers because of
different<00:01:20.909> air<00:01:21.030> chambers<00:01:21.540> there's<00:01:21.810> more

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
different air chambers there's more

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.910 
different air chambers there's more
sound<00:01:22.439> isolation<00:01:23.100> and<00:01:24.049> the<00:01:25.049> headband<00:01:25.650> was

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
sound isolation and the headband was

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.350 
sound isolation and the headband was
improved<00:01:26.400> this<00:01:26.729> is<00:01:26.909> an<00:01:27.299> aluminum<00:01:27.900> alloy<00:01:28.590> so

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
improved this is an aluminum alloy so

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.719 
improved this is an aluminum alloy so
this<00:01:30.360> means<00:01:30.659> there's<00:01:31.140> there's<00:01:31.890> less<00:01:32.189> parts

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
this means there's there's less parts

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.910 
this means there's there's less parts
less<00:01:33.060> hearts<00:01:33.450> that<00:01:33.630> can<00:01:33.869> break<00:01:34.140> and<00:01:34.470> its

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
less hearts that can break and its

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.780 
less hearts that can break and its
overall<00:01:35.280> a<00:01:35.820> more<00:01:36.689> durable<00:01:36.960> product<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:38.549> price

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
overall a more durable product the price
