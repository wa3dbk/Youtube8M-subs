00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:32.579 
look at these real quick so for example

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:35.030 
look at these real quick so for example
my<00:02:33.000> snowball<00:02:33.359> toss<00:02:33.540> down<00:02:34.260> here<00:02:34.590> it<00:02:34.739> says<00:02:34.769> the

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:01.109 
extension kind of like taking it beyond

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:03.289 
extension kind of like taking it beyond
just<00:03:01.560> sitting<00:03:02.250> down<00:03:02.280> and<00:03:02.519> doing<00:03:02.609> a<00:03:02.760> crash<00:03:03.000> but
