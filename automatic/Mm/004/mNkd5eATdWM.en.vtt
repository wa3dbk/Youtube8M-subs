cartridge<00:01:20.710> however<00:01:21.710> I'm<00:01:21.950> not<00:01:22.130> sure<00:01:22.520> if<00:01:22.670> it's

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
cartridge however I'm not sure if it's

cartridge however I'm not sure if it's
any<00:01:23.000> better<00:01:31.390> it<00:01:32.390> certainly<00:01:32.840> looks<00:01:33.200> a<00:01:33.470> lot<00:01:33.800> more

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
any better it certainly looks a lot more

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.830 
any better it certainly looks a lot more
like<00:01:34.010> the<00:01:34.280> arcade<00:01:34.640> machine<00:01:34.850> but<00:01:35.270> it's<00:01:35.420> not<00:01:35.660> as

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
like the arcade machine but it's not as

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.350 
like the arcade machine but it's not as
good<00:01:36.080> as<00:01:36.140> the<00:01:36.710> ColecoVision<00:01:37.369> version<00:01:38.180> of

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
good as the ColecoVision version of

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.230 
good as the ColecoVision version of
defender<00:01:38.960> I've<00:01:39.890> reviewed<00:01:40.340> all<00:01:40.580> of<00:01:40.760> these<00:01:40.970> so

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
defender I've reviewed all of these so

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.420 
defender I've reviewed all of these so
you<00:01:41.270> can<00:01:41.390> check<00:01:41.780> them<00:01:42.020> out<00:01:42.170> I<00:01:42.530> should<00:01:43.190> add<00:01:43.400> that

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 
you can check them out I should add that

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.490 
you can check them out I should add that
this<00:01:43.790> version<00:01:44.060> is<00:01:44.420> far<00:01:44.720> more<00:01:44.869> difficult<00:01:45.110> than

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
this version is far more difficult than

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.490 
this version is far more difficult than
both<00:01:45.890> the<00:01:46.030> 2600<00:01:47.030> and<00:01:47.119> ColecoVision<00:01:48.110> versions

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
both the 2600 and ColecoVision versions

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.190 
both the 2600 and ColecoVision versions
of<00:01:48.710> defender<00:01:49.250> it<00:01:49.940> has<00:01:50.060> more<00:01:50.300> of<00:01:50.360> that<00:01:50.479> crushing

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
of defender it has more of that crushing

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.590 
of defender it has more of that crushing
overwhelming<00:01:52.130> difficulty<00:01:52.880> that<00:01:53.030> the<00:01:53.210> arcade

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
overwhelming difficulty that the arcade

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.350 
overwhelming difficulty that the arcade
machine<00:01:53.780> has<00:01:54.229> but<00:01:55.070> it<00:01:55.160> lacks<00:01:55.400> the<00:01:55.580> polish<00:01:56.119> of

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
machine has but it lacks the polish of

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.300 
machine has but it lacks the polish of
the<00:01:56.479> ColecoVision<00:01:56.930> version<00:01:57.680> defender

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
the ColecoVision version defender

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.440 
the ColecoVision version defender
actually<00:01:59.300> looks<00:01:59.540> a<00:01:59.690> bit<00:01:59.720> sloppy<00:02:00.350> on<00:02:00.619> the<00:02:00.800> 5200

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
actually looks a bit sloppy on the 5200

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.870 
actually looks a bit sloppy on the 5200
the<00:02:02.450> atari<00:02:02.780> 2600<00:02:03.590> version<00:02:03.979> of<00:02:04.250> defender<00:02:04.759> is

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
the atari 2600 version of defender is

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.820 
the atari 2600 version of defender is
very<00:02:05.090> crude<00:02:05.450> compared<00:02:05.990> to<00:02:06.170> this<00:02:06.380> it's<00:02:06.649> almost

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
very crude compared to this it's almost

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:08.830 
very crude compared to this it's almost
a<00:02:07.130> different<00:02:07.729> game<00:02:08.060> compared<00:02:08.600> to<00:02:08.720> the

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
a different game compared to the

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.050 
a different game compared to the
original<00:02:08.929> arcade<00:02:09.649> defender<00:02:10.220> but<00:02:10.610> it's<00:02:10.789> still

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
original arcade defender but it's still

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.570 
original arcade defender but it's still
really<00:02:11.300> good<00:02:11.660> I<00:02:11.720> actually<00:02:12.200> like<00:02:12.860> the<00:02:13.100> Atari

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
really good I actually like the Atari

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.720 
really good I actually like the Atari
2600<00:02:14.350> defender<00:02:15.350> that's<00:02:15.860> also<00:02:16.250> the<00:02:16.400> one<00:02:16.550> that<00:02:16.580> I

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
2600 defender that's also the one that I

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:25.590 
2600 defender that's also the one that I
grew<00:02:16.970> up<00:02:17.060> with<00:02:17.120> and<00:02:17.480> played<00:02:17.660> the<00:02:17.810> muscle

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.420 

but<00:02:26.600> at<00:02:26.690> least<00:02:26.840> here<00:02:27.170> on<00:02:27.260> the<00:02:27.350> Atari<00:02:27.680> 5200

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
but at least here on the Atari 5200

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.450 
but at least here on the Atari 5200
version<00:02:29.240> you<00:02:29.360> give<00:02:29.570> multiple<00:02:30.170> buttons<00:02:30.500> so<00:02:31.400> you

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:31.460 
version you give multiple buttons so you

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.160 
version you give multiple buttons so you
have<00:02:31.670> buttons<00:02:31.940> for<00:02:32.240> firing<00:02:32.600> your<00:02:32.840> missiles

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
have buttons for firing your missiles

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.560 
have buttons for firing your missiles
your<00:02:33.320> smart<00:02:33.710> bombs<00:02:33.980> and<00:02:34.330> hyperspace

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.570 
your smart bombs and hyperspace

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:38.590 
your smart bombs and hyperspace
unlike<00:02:36.500> the<00:02:36.620> Atari<00:02:36.950> 2600<00:02:37.700> which<00:02:38.060> only<00:02:38.240> gave

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
unlike the Atari 2600 which only gave

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:51.770 
unlike the Atari 2600 which only gave
you<00:02:38.720> one<00:02:38.750> button

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.330 

this<00:02:52.780> version<00:02:53.050> of<00:02:53.350> defender<00:02:53.860> offers<00:02:54.310> a

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
this version of defender offers a

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:55.230 
this version of defender offers a
trackball

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:55.240 
trackball

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.000 
trackball
option<00:02:55.810> so<00:02:56.020> that<00:02:56.050> you<00:02:56.260> can<00:02:56.410> play<00:02:56.620> it<00:02:56.740> with<00:02:56.800> the

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
option so that you can play it with the

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.480 
option so that you can play it with the
atari<00:02:57.400> 5200<00:02:58.180> trackball<00:02:58.630> which<00:02:59.560> sadly<00:03:00.130> i<00:03:00.310> do

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:00.490 
atari 5200 trackball which sadly i do

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:03.090 
atari 5200 trackball which sadly i do
not<00:03:00.730> have<00:03:01.000> yet<00:03:01.410> gotta<00:03:02.410> find<00:03:02.710> one<00:03:02.950> of<00:03:02.980> those

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
not have yet gotta find one of those

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:04.860 
not have yet gotta find one of those
things<00:03:03.400> for<00:03:03.550> missile<00:03:03.850> command<00:03:04.150> and<00:03:04.420> check<00:03:04.690> out

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
things for missile command and check out

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.590 
things for missile command and check out
defender<00:03:05.410> with<00:03:05.560> a<00:03:05.590> trackball<00:03:06.330> sounds<00:03:07.330> kind<00:03:07.540> of

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
defender with a trackball sounds kind of

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:39.280 
defender with a trackball sounds kind of
neat

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:41.720 

now<00:03:40.290> you<00:03:40.379> can<00:03:40.530> get<00:03:40.709> defender<00:03:41.220> on<00:03:41.370> pretty<00:03:41.579> much

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
now you can get defender on pretty much

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.460 
now you can get defender on pretty much
every<00:03:42.030> game<00:03:42.239> console<00:03:42.810> out<00:03:42.989> there<00:03:43.230> these<00:03:43.409> days
