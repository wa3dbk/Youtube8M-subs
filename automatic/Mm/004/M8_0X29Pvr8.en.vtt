00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:55.510 
inside of it it's like a wire so you

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:57.630 
inside of it it's like a wire so you
roll<00:00:55.840> it<00:00:55.990> up<00:00:56.170> and<00:00:56.350> then<00:00:56.440> you<00:00:56.980> sort<00:00:57.190> of<00:00:57.280> bends

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:57.640 
roll it up and then you sort of bends

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.060 
roll it up and then you sort of bends
the<00:00:58.510> wires<00:00:58.690> in<00:00:59.050> what<00:00:59.230> it's<00:00:59.410> really<00:00:59.680> really

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.070 
the wires in what it's really really

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.730 
the wires in what it's really really
easy<00:01:00.100> and<00:01:00.670> they're<00:01:01.270> extremely<00:01:01.990> comfortable

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:02.740 
easy and they're extremely comfortable

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:10.910

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.610 

haven't<00:01:12.630> done<00:01:13.630> anything<00:01:13.900> like<00:01:14.050> this<00:01:14.200> with<00:01:14.380> my

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:14.620 
haven't done anything like this with my

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:16.890 
haven't done anything like this with my
hair<00:01:14.800> in<00:01:14.890> a<00:01:14.950> long<00:01:15.220> time<00:01:15.640> whenever<00:01:16.030> I<00:01:16.270> would<00:01:16.720> get

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:16.900 
hair in a long time whenever I would get

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.290 
hair in a long time whenever I would get
my<00:01:17.050> hair<00:01:17.350> pressing<00:01:18.250> her<00:01:18.490> I<00:01:18.730> would<00:01:18.880> just<00:01:19.060> wrap

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:19.300 
my hair pressing her I would just wrap

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.690 
my hair pressing her I would just wrap
it<00:01:19.540> and<00:01:19.780> then<00:01:20.409> I<00:01:20.500> would<00:01:20.560> get<00:01:20.830> tired<00:01:21.159> of<00:01:21.460> it

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
it and then I would get tired of it

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.910 
it and then I would get tired of it
because<00:01:22.300> it<00:01:22.450> would<00:01:22.630> be<00:01:22.780> flat<00:01:23.140> and<00:01:23.350> for<00:01:23.800> some

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
because it would be flat and for some

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.510 
because it would be flat and for some
reason<00:01:24.280> it<00:01:24.400> never<00:01:24.580> dawned<00:01:24.850> on<00:01:25.090> me<00:01:25.150> it's<00:01:25.360> just

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
reason it never dawned on me it's just

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.320 
reason it never dawned on me it's just
um<00:01:28.620> get<00:01:29.620> rollers<00:01:30.010> or<00:01:30.580> at<00:01:30.670> least<00:01:30.850> if<00:01:31.060> I<00:01:31.150> thought

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.330 
um get rollers or at least if I thought

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:32.969 
um get rollers or at least if I thought
of<00:01:31.450> rollers<00:01:31.780> I<00:01:31.960> thought<00:01:32.170> of<00:01:32.290> the<00:01:32.440> traditional

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:32.979 
of rollers I thought of the traditional

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:35.610 
of rollers I thought of the traditional
hard<00:01:33.280> ones<00:01:33.520> and<00:01:33.870> yeah<00:01:34.870> there<00:01:35.110> was<00:01:35.229> no<00:01:35.350> L<00:01:35.500> to

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:35.620 
hard ones and yeah there was no L to

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:42.120 
hard ones and yeah there was no L to
sweeping<00:01:35.950> in<00:01:36.040> those<00:01:36.190> so<00:01:40.800> of<00:01:41.800> course<00:01:42.040> you

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
sweeping in those so of course you

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:43.860
