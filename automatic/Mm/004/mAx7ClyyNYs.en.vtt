much more shut up this thing is and

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.669 
much more shut up this thing is and
actually<00:00:52.239> the<00:00:52.539> mid-pipe<00:00:52.929> shut<00:00:53.199> it<00:00:53.289> up<00:00:53.350> a<00:00:53.469> lot

00:00:53.669 --> 00:00:53.679 
actually the mid-pipe shut it up a lot

00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:55.979 
actually the mid-pipe shut it up a lot
because<00:00:53.949> you<00:00:54.190> got<00:00:54.370> the<00:00:54.579> let<00:00:55.390> the<00:00:55.510> sound<00:00:55.780> away

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:55.989 
because you got the let the sound away

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:59.250 
because you got the let the sound away
from<00:00:56.170> the<00:00:56.260> cab<00:00:56.530> and<00:00:57.329> so<00:00:58.329> it's<00:00:58.479> crying<00:00:58.809> the<00:00:59.049> cab

00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.260 
from the cab and so it's crying the cab

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.740 
from the cab and so it's crying the cab
and<00:00:59.589> then<00:00:59.949> outside<00:01:00.129> it<00:01:00.429> sounds<00:01:00.969> fairly<00:01:01.120> decent

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.219 

and<00:01:04.750> this<00:01:04.899> thing<00:01:06.119> 1992<00:01:07.119> and<00:01:07.240> all<00:01:07.360> actually

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:10.119 
alerted me that my oil was low and I'd

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:12.870 
alerted me that my oil was low and I'd
fixed<00:01:10.689> that<00:01:10.869> it<00:01:11.110> was<00:01:11.229> it<00:01:11.860> kind<00:01:12.280> of<00:01:12.369> waited<00:01:12.820> a

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
fixed that it was it kind of waited a

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.090

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.560 
it's leaking coolant which is not good

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.350 
it's leaking coolant which is not good
but<00:01:17.920> considering<00:01:18.610> its<00:01:18.759> it<00:01:18.850> like<00:01:19.000> two<00:01:19.299> hundred

but considering its it like two hundred
five<00:01:19.569> thousand<00:01:19.960> miles<00:01:20.080> I'm<00:01:20.380> okay<00:01:20.830> with<00:01:20.920> it

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:21.009 
five thousand miles I'm okay with it

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:22.289 
five thousand miles I'm okay with it
leaking<00:01:21.280> coolant<00:01:21.429> I've<00:01:21.759> already<00:01:22.030> ordered<00:01:22.270> it

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:22.299 
leaking coolant I've already ordered it

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:23.940 
leaking coolant I've already ordered it
all<00:01:22.659> alone<00:01:22.899> when<00:01:23.020> I'm<00:01:23.140> radiator<00:01:23.500> for<00:01:23.710> it<00:01:23.830> but

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
all alone when I'm radiator for it but

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.760 
all alone when I'm radiator for it but
anyway<00:01:24.190> enough<00:01:24.429> with<00:01:25.179> the<00:01:25.390> stuff<00:01:26.110> that<00:01:26.140> sucks

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
anyway enough with the stuff that sucks

anyway enough with the stuff that sucks
here's<00:01:27.220> the<00:01:27.369> stuff<00:01:27.610> that<00:01:27.789> doesn't<00:01:28.060> suck<00:01:32.190> so

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
here's the stuff that doesn't suck so

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.730 
here's the stuff that doesn't suck so
it's<00:01:34.390> pretty<00:01:34.539> quiet<00:01:34.750> it's<00:01:35.140> fairly<00:01:35.380> warm

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
it's pretty quiet it's fairly warm

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:41.500 
it's pretty quiet it's fairly warm
socking<00:01:36.100> right<00:01:36.250> it

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:41.510 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.190 

go<00:01:42.510> ahead

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.039 

but<00:01:45.860> outside<00:01:46.430> it's<00:01:46.670> like<00:01:46.759> really<00:01:47.570> agreeable

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:48.049 
but outside it's like really agreeable

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:50.679 
but outside it's like really agreeable
and<00:01:48.140> I'm<00:01:48.229> thinking<00:01:48.500> once<00:01:48.680> I<00:01:48.770> put<00:01:48.979> the<00:01:49.689> tailpipe

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:50.689 
and I'm thinking once I put the tailpipe

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:52.569 
and I'm thinking once I put the tailpipe
on<00:01:50.899> which<00:01:51.380> will<00:01:51.590> come<00:01:51.770> out<00:01:51.890> like<00:01:52.039> right<00:01:52.280> there

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:52.579 
on which will come out like right there

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:54.969 
on which will come out like right there
I<00:01:52.939> put<00:01:53.689> a<00:01:53.719> tip<00:01:53.929> on<00:01:54.049> it<00:01:54.259> sound<00:01:54.439> really<00:01:54.560> good<00:01:54.740> so<00:01:54.920> I

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
I put a tip on it sound really good so I

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:56.709 
I put a tip on it sound really good so I
bought<00:01:55.189> the<00:01:55.310> camera<00:01:55.460> away<00:01:55.700> enough<00:01:56.450> to<00:01:56.600> where

00:01:56.709 --> 00:01:56.719 
bought the camera away enough to where
