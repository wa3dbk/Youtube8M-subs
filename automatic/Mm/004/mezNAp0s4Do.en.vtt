so<00:00:56.409> to<00:00:57.010> finish<00:00:57.220> the<00:00:57.489> job<00:00:57.640> epigram<00:00:58.000> off<00:00:58.239> we<00:00:58.720> need

00:00:58.829 --> 00:00:58.839 
so to finish the job epigram off we need

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:02.460 
so to finish the job epigram off we need
to<00:00:58.900> add<00:00:59.110> two<00:00:59.680> little<00:00:59.920> arcs<00:01:00.489> like<00:01:01.049> this<00:01:02.049> in<00:01:02.320> the

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:02.470 
to add two little arcs like this in the

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:04.170 
to add two little arcs like this in the
middle<00:01:02.710> meatus<00:01:02.979> and<00:01:03.489> this<00:01:03.670> gives<00:01:03.879> us<00:01:04.000> our

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:04.180 
middle meatus and this gives us our

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.990 
middle meatus and this gives us our
ethmoid<00:01:04.690> bulla<00:01:05.019> and<00:01:05.290> our<00:01:05.799> semilunar<00:01:06.430> hiatus

ethmoid bulla and our semilunar hiatus

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.510 
ethmoid bulla and our semilunar hiatus
and<00:01:07.240> it's<00:01:07.810> worth<00:01:07.990> pointing<00:01:08.260> out<00:01:08.530> that<00:01:08.590> this

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 
and it's worth pointing out that this

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.219 
and it's worth pointing out that this
portion<00:01:09.850> right<00:01:10.090> here<00:01:10.150> would<00:01:10.720> represent<00:01:10.869> the

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:11.229 
portion right here would represent the

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:13.070 
portion right here would represent the
uncinate<00:01:11.619> process<00:01:11.770> of<00:01:12.400> the<00:01:12.580> ethmoid<00:01:12.729> bone

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
uncinate process of the ethmoid bone

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.570 
uncinate process of the ethmoid bone
which<00:01:14.080> consumes<00:01:14.439> you<00:01:14.560> contributes<00:01:15.220> to<00:01:15.460> the

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:15.580 
which consumes you contributes to the

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.350 
which consumes you contributes to the
bottom<00:01:15.939> arc<00:01:16.240> of<00:01:16.630> the<00:01:16.810> semilunar<00:01:17.110> hiatus<00:01:18.360> we

draining<00:02:52.270> into<00:02:52.450> the<00:02:53.110> answer<00:02:53.470> your<00:02:53.620> part<00:02:53.800> of

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
draining into the answer your part of

nasolacrimal duct in the inferior natus

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.480 
nasolacrimal duct in the inferior natus
so<00:03:01.240> you<00:03:01.330> can<00:03:01.420> see<00:03:01.830> you<00:03:02.830> can<00:03:02.980> draw<00:03:03.160> this<00:03:03.310> out

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:03.490 
so you can see you can draw this out

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:06.660 
so you can see you can draw this out
pretty<00:03:03.730> quick<00:03:04.560> we<00:03:05.560> just<00:03:05.770> have<00:03:05.920> simple<00:03:06.220> right

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
pretty quick we just have simple right

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.580 
pretty quick we just have simple right
triangle<00:03:07.830> one<00:03:08.830> two<00:03:09.630> three<00:03:10.630> and<00:03:10.840> then<00:03:11.290> we<00:03:11.410> have

one one semilunar hiatus 1 1 2 and our
nasolacrimal<00:03:20.640> this<00:03:21.640> is<00:03:21.730> a<00:03:21.760> bit<00:03:21.970> sloppy<00:03:22.240> but<00:03:22.540> on

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
nasolacrimal this is a bit sloppy but on

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.710 
nasolacrimal this is a bit sloppy but on
a<00:03:23.380> practical<00:03:23.980> or<00:03:24.190> on<00:03:24.280> an<00:03:24.400> exam<00:03:24.730> or<00:03:24.940> if<00:03:25.360> you<00:03:25.540> draw

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
a practical or on an exam or if you draw

a practical or on an exam or if you draw
this<00:03:25.810> out<00:03:25.990> a<00:03:26.020> few<00:03:26.230> times<00:03:26.440> you<00:03:27.220> will<00:03:27.250> be<00:03:27.430> able<00:03:27.610> to

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
this out a few times you will be able to

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.160 
this out a few times you will be able to
picture<00:03:28.030> it<00:03:28.150> pretty<00:03:28.390> quickly<00:03:28.630> in<00:03:28.840> your<00:03:28.990> head

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170 
picture it pretty quickly in your head

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:30.690 
picture it pretty quickly in your head
and<00:03:29.470> it<00:03:29.590> will<00:03:29.680> at<00:03:29.770> least<00:03:29.860> help<00:03:30.040> you<00:03:30.220> spatially

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
and it will at least help you spatially

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.930 
and it will at least help you spatially
