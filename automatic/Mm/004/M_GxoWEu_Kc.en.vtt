00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
great and I believe this is an inch and

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.500 
great and I believe this is an inch and
a<00:02:19.480> quarter<00:02:19.719> platform<00:02:20.620> on<00:02:20.799> here<00:02:21.250> you<00:02:22.060> can<00:02:22.269> go<00:02:22.450> on

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
a quarter platform on here you can go on

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.059 
a quarter platform on here you can go on
the<00:02:22.599> website<00:02:22.629> to<00:02:22.959> see<00:02:23.200> phone<00:02:23.439> measurements

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
the website to see phone measurements

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:27.119 
the website to see phone measurements
and<00:02:24.870> this<00:02:25.870> is<00:02:26.019> like<00:02:26.140> a<00:02:26.170> six-inch<00:02:26.680> heel<00:02:26.920> like

00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:27.129 
and this is like a six-inch heel like

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:28.880 
and this is like a six-inch heel like
the<00:02:27.219> leafless<00:02:27.609> or<00:02:27.849> a<00:02:27.909> six<00:02:28.180> and<00:02:28.299> a<00:02:28.359> half<00:02:28.390> inch

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
the leafless or a six and a half inch

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.740 
the leafless or a six and a half inch
the<00:02:29.890> wooden<00:02:30.189> heel<00:02:30.430> and<00:02:30.819> the<00:02:31.239> fact<00:02:31.450> that<00:02:31.569> is

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
the wooden heel and the fact that is

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.960 
the wooden heel and the fact that is
trying<00:02:32.049> to<00:02:32.170> get<00:02:32.379> to<00:02:32.560> a<00:02:32.590> lot<00:02:33.099> more<00:02:33.340> support<00:02:33.819> when

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
trying to get to a lot more support when

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.970 
trying to get to a lot more support when
you're<00:02:34.150> walking<00:02:34.390> because<00:02:35.170> this<00:02:35.439> obviously

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
you're walking because this obviously

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.679 
you're walking because this obviously
looks<00:02:36.280> like<00:02:36.430> a<00:02:36.459> really<00:02:36.730> high<00:02:36.970> yield<00:02:37.299> and<00:02:37.480> since

00:02:37.679 --> 00:02:37.689 
looks like a really high yield and since

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:40.020 
looks like a really high yield and since
you<00:02:37.780> have<00:02:37.810> that<00:02:38.319> chunky<00:02:38.739> platform<00:02:38.950> that<00:02:39.909> will

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
you have that chunky platform that will

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:41.970 
you have that chunky platform that will
kind<00:02:40.239> of<00:02:40.269> add<00:02:40.510> two<00:02:40.810> more<00:02:40.959> support<00:02:41.469> right<00:02:41.709> under

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
kind of add two more support right under

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.199 
kind of add two more support right under
the<00:02:42.129> ball<00:02:42.310> of<00:02:42.340> your<00:02:42.459> foot<00:02:42.700> so<00:02:42.909> it<00:02:43.000> actually

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
the ball of your foot so it actually

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.569 
the ball of your foot so it actually
shortens<00:02:43.870> the<00:02:44.049> heel<00:02:44.230> just<00:02:44.500> to<00:02:44.709> tab<00:02:44.950> it<00:02:45.220> so<00:02:45.430> it

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:45.579 
shortens the heel just to tab it so it

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:47.970 
shortens the heel just to tab it so it
makes<00:02:45.700> it<00:02:45.849> easier<00:02:46.299> to<00:02:46.329> walk<00:02:46.569> in<00:02:46.810> and<00:02:47.019> these

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
makes it easier to walk in and these

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.670 
makes it easier to walk in and these
shoes<00:02:48.189> are<00:02:48.310> actually<00:02:48.700> very<00:02:48.909> comfortable<00:02:49.680> the

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
shoes are actually very comfortable the

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.339 
shoes are actually very comfortable the
lining<00:02:51.250> is<00:02:51.370> obviously<00:02:52.120> like<00:02:52.750> a<00:02:52.780> synthetic

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:53.349 
lining is obviously like a synthetic

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:55.860 
lining is obviously like a synthetic
material<00:02:53.819> but<00:02:54.819> it<00:02:54.970> doesn't<00:02:55.269> really<00:02:55.359> bug<00:02:55.599> my

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
material but it doesn't really bug my

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.319 
material but it doesn't really bug my
foot<00:02:56.169> too<00:02:56.349> much<00:02:56.560> and<00:02:57.099> one<00:02:57.909> thing<00:02:57.939> i<00:02:58.269> do

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:58.329 
foot too much and one thing i do

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:01.020 
foot too much and one thing i do
recommend<00:02:58.659> is<00:02:59.260> maybe<00:03:00.129> going<00:03:00.430> like<00:03:00.760> a<00:03:00.790> half

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
recommend is maybe going like a half

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:02.490 
recommend is maybe going like a half
size<00:03:01.239> smaller<00:03:01.299> than<00:03:01.720> you<00:03:01.930> would<00:03:02.079> typically

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
size smaller than you would typically

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.520 
size smaller than you would typically
wear<00:03:02.889> but<00:03:03.819> since<00:03:04.090> i<00:03:04.269> have<00:03:04.359> a<00:03:04.629> ton<00:03:04.900> of<00:03:04.930> insoles

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
wear but since i have a ton of insoles

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.319 
wear but since i have a ton of insoles
at<00:03:05.889> least<00:03:06.220> since<00:03:06.370> i<00:03:06.459> obviously<00:03:06.849> work<00:03:07.180> at<00:03:07.299> a

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:07.329
