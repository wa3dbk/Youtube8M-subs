00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.070 
and they're all I guess we were just
saying<00:02:41.940> that<00:02:42.150> is<00:02:42.270> kind<00:02:42.480> of<00:02:42.570> Makoto's<00:02:42.900> power

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
saying that is kind of Makoto's power

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.360

but that's not how I expected it to
happen<00:02:44.580> though<00:02:44.940> but<00:02:45.930> he<00:02:45.990> pulled<00:02:46.200> it<00:02:46.260> down<00:02:46.760> k<00:02:47.760> 1
