 It's one thing I've never been asked and 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.620
 I was shocked, said mine, it's a 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.949
 end of the biennial book is a word that 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.930

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.019
 of Rio de Janeiro every two years has 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.030

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.530

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.450

 someone like him is not worth going back but 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.630

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.180

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.950

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.619
 and blue flag is the most voted of all 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:46.439

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:49.560
 intrinsic rocco galera record ney de 70 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:52.619
 And today we had a lot of autographs. 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.570
 famous people had the only shot that 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.820
 Ivory knows what pixi is having now 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.040
 paula pimenta had thalita rebouças 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.909
 There are a lot of people here, then. 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.829
 very full and unique series in the parks is 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:07.950
 absurd people will see him and 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:09.050
 women screaming and running and when 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.790
 speak the password 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.520
 they ran and jumped 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:15.590
 to wear high heels fall into the 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.320
 floor so you can run faster and 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.610
 Wow, it was crazy, I was shocked. 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.620
 shocked dr 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.000
 So what happened I got the performance of 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.100
 half stay and I'll show you 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.110
 now it was a minute because I'm getting 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.940
 alone I did not have to stick to me 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.780
 so it is very difficult to hold this 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:40.630
 microphone you are using 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:40.630
 and the camera is running around 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:52.890
 because it's this guy's autograph and he's not 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:55.020
 write the name he does not look right at you 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.670
 It was very fast so it did not 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:59.370
 to take a picture with him I think 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.800
 publisher took but I 'm not sure 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.170
 that she on their site could later 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.120
 continue working and self-centered 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.830
 booth editorial chalk that my 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.319
 favorite editor of all biennials 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.690
 because everyone is very nice and 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:15.690
