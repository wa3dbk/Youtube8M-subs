00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.940
 with systems 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.310
 and I'm investigating more and the truth is 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.020
 which has an excellent reputation and I have 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:52.400

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:58.670
 mother cards decided but it should be 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.500

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.940
 intimations in what later we can 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.020
 give what is after we can give 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.420

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.230
 let's do is we're going to see you 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.640
 alone with the pure fact of following them 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.739
 follow us on twitter 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.940
 if you have not followed them yet let's continue now 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:49.880
 protest 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:52.400
 gb mx and they simply have to put a 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.930
 text because with that we will know for 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.140
 get the winner 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:59.060
 let's use the hashtag that is called gb 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.430
 talent like that is 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.440
 came the talent is very very good 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:06.070
 so they have to use it they have to 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.070
 follow gb 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.520
 then we will have 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.510
 has its logo 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.719
 that's it 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.900
 here is another one with the wolf 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:51.630
 we have the fourth and the fifth is the 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:54.350
 different not fifth says I'm super 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.350
 overclock 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.060
 yes 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.860
 it's like after going to pick up this 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:22.070
 then we will open with a my 

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:24.020
 knowledge 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:26.750
 but hey, just use the hashtag 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:28.400
 I have talent and if I win if that already 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:29.870
 we are going to randomly choose 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.430
 organ 2 are going to get all the 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.720
 names by means of matter only 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:35.210
 choosing in our five t- shirts 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.920
