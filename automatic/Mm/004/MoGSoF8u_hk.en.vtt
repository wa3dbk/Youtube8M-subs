00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.279 
still pretty yellow but maybe I'll go
and<00:00:17.640> see<00:00:17.850> what<00:00:18.150> I<00:00:18.180> can<00:00:18.300> do<00:00:18.510> about<00:00:18.539> making<00:00:19.109> some

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
and see what I can do about making some

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.740 
and see what I can do about making some
of<00:00:19.410> that<00:00:19.529> retro<00:00:19.890> bright<00:00:20.189> it's<00:00:21.119> a<00:00:21.300> little<00:00:21.660> bit

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
of that retro bright it's a little bit

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.150 
of that retro bright it's a little bit
difficult<00:00:21.930> here<00:00:22.350> in<00:00:22.439> Japan<00:00:22.680> because<00:00:22.920> a<00:00:22.980> lot<00:00:23.130> of

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
difficult here in Japan because a lot of

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.480 
difficult here in Japan because a lot of
those<00:00:23.390> those<00:00:24.390> products<00:00:25.380> like<00:00:25.560> the<00:00:25.740> peroxide

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
those those products like the peroxide

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:27.859 
those those products like the peroxide
and<00:00:26.670> stuff<00:00:26.820> like<00:00:26.910> that<00:00:26.970> isn't<00:00:27.269> sold<00:00:27.599> over<00:00:27.840> the

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
and stuff like that isn't sold over the

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.839 
and stuff like that isn't sold over the
counter<00:00:27.960> so<00:00:28.529> it's<00:00:29.220> going<00:00:29.310> to<00:00:29.369> be<00:00:29.460> a<00:00:29.519> little<00:00:29.670> bit

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
counter so it's going to be a little bit

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.389 
counter so it's going to be a little bit
difficult<00:00:30.029> if<00:00:30.420> I<00:00:30.510> can't<00:00:30.720> find<00:00:30.990> it<00:00:31.279> I'll<00:00:32.279> try

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
difficult if I can't find it I'll try

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:33.979 
difficult if I can't find it I'll try
something<00:00:32.880> else<00:00:32.969> but<00:00:33.300> at<00:00:33.390> least<00:00:33.510> for<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:33.870> most

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
something else but at least for the most

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.500

like I don't know rigged up this
makeshift<00:01:40.920> lock<00:01:41.189> I'm<00:01:41.400> not<00:01:41.549> a<00:01:41.579> big<00:01:41.759> fan<00:01:41.790> of<00:01:42.030> it

guess it'll be alright this door here
was<00:01:47.310> actually<00:01:47.790> bent<00:01:48.360> as<00:01:48.630> you<00:01:48.750> can<00:01:48.869> see<00:01:49.049> it's

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
was actually bent as you can see it's

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.630 
was actually bent as you can see it's
kind<00:01:49.380> of<00:01:49.500> got<00:01:49.619> a<00:01:49.649> little<00:01:49.710> bit<00:01:50.009> of<00:01:50.040> a<00:01:50.159> bend<00:01:50.369> to<00:01:50.610> it

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
kind of got a little bit of a bend to it

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.090 
kind of got a little bit of a bend to it
and<00:01:51.000> I've<00:01:51.119> tried<00:01:51.270> my<00:01:51.479> best<00:01:51.509> to<00:01:51.750> try<00:01:51.990> and

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
and I've tried my best to try and

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.260 
and I've tried my best to try and
flatten<00:01:53.100> it<00:01:53.159> back<00:01:53.310> out<00:01:53.490> but<00:01:53.700> I<00:01:53.729> don't<00:01:53.970> want<00:01:54.149> to

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
flatten it back out but I don't want to

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.230 
flatten it back out but I don't want to
put<00:01:54.630> a<00:01:54.829> crease<00:01:55.829> in<00:01:56.040> it<00:01:56.159> by<00:01:56.670> trying<00:01:56.939> to<00:01:56.969> bend<00:01:57.149> it

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
put a crease in it by trying to bend it

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.510 
put a crease in it by trying to bend it
too<00:01:57.390> much<00:01:57.570> so<00:01:57.630> I<00:01:58.140> took<00:01:58.500> a<00:01:58.649> lock<00:01:58.890> out<00:01:59.130> of<00:01:59.310> one<00:01:59.490> of

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
too much so I took a lock out of one of

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.870 
too much so I took a lock out of one of
my<00:01:59.670> other<00:01:59.790> neogeo<00:02:00.299> cabs<00:02:00.659> and<00:02:00.990> then<00:02:01.670> just<00:02:02.670> put

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
my other neogeo cabs and then just put

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.160 
my other neogeo cabs and then just put
that<00:02:02.909> in<00:02:03.210> there<00:02:03.420> and<00:02:03.570> it<00:02:03.810> holds<00:02:03.990> it<00:02:04.140> down

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
that in there and it holds it down

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.679 
that in there and it holds it down
pretty<00:02:04.500> good<00:02:04.880> also<00:02:05.880> I<00:02:05.909> switched<00:02:06.240> out<00:02:06.450> that

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
pretty good also I switched out that

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.139 
pretty good also I switched out that
that<00:02:07.500> for<00:02:07.770> slot<00:02:07.979> board<00:02:08.310> and<00:02:08.489> put<00:02:08.640> into<00:02:08.759> six

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
that for slot board and put into six

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.330 
that for slot board and put into six
main<00:02:09.679> reason<00:02:10.679> was<00:02:11.280> you<00:02:11.610> know<00:02:11.730> that<00:02:11.970> I<00:02:12.000> want

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
main reason was you know that I want

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.610 
main reason was you know that I want
to<00:02:12.370> have<00:02:12.519> at<00:02:12.670> least<00:02:12.730> six<00:02:13.060> cards<00:02:13.450> that<00:02:14.379> I<00:02:14.410> could

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
to have at least six cards that I could

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.729 
to have at least six cards that I could
play<00:02:14.769> at<00:02:15.010> one<00:02:15.190> time<00:02:15.430> but<00:02:16.180> on<00:02:16.690> top<00:02:16.840> of<00:02:16.900> that<00:02:17.050> when

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:17.739 
play at one time but on top of that when

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:19.710 
play at one time but on top of that when
I<00:02:17.769> got<00:02:17.950> the<00:02:18.190> four<00:02:18.550> slot<00:02:18.819> and<00:02:19.120> I<00:02:19.180> plugged<00:02:19.480> in<00:02:19.599> all

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:22.599 
the I plugged in all the cables to it

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:24.930 
the I plugged in all the cables to it
and<00:02:22.980> turned<00:02:23.980> it<00:02:24.069> on<00:02:24.190> there<00:02:24.459> was<00:02:24.580> no<00:02:24.700> sound

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940
