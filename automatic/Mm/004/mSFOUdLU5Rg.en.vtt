00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.420 

make<00:00:20.770> a<00:00:20.800> loop<00:00:21.070> the<00:00:21.250> other<00:00:21.430> way<00:00:21.930> and<00:00:23.190> I've<00:00:24.190> made

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:24.430 
make a loop the other way and I've made

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:25.950 
make a loop the other way and I've made
a<00:00:24.490> real<00:00:24.790> nice<00:00:24.970> tight<00:00:25.300> knot<00:00:25.330> on<00:00:25.660> there<00:00:25.810> I<00:00:25.840> can

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:25.960 
a real nice tight knot on there I can

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.600 
a real nice tight knot on there I can
then<00:00:26.260> just<00:00:26.440> follow<00:00:26.620> off<00:00:26.890> with<00:00:27.070> a<00:00:27.130> couple<00:00:27.340> half

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:27.610 
then just follow off with a couple half

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:28.200 
then just follow off with a couple half
hitches

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:28.210 
hitches

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:30.780 
hitches
I'll<00:00:28.300> make<00:00:29.050> them<00:00:29.230> slippery<00:00:29.860> so<00:00:30.460> that<00:00:30.490> it's

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:30.790 
I'll make them slippery so that it's

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:33.870 
I'll make them slippery so that it's
easy<00:00:30.970> to<00:00:31.090> get<00:00:31.300> them<00:00:31.480> out<00:00:32.280> later<00:00:33.280> on<00:00:33.550> when<00:00:33.790> I'm

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:33.880 
easy to get them out later on when I'm

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.060 
easy to get them out later on when I'm
finished<00:00:34.240> camp<00:00:34.570> so<00:00:35.380> now<00:00:35.530> I've<00:00:35.650> got<00:00:35.830> a<00:00:35.860> nice

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:36.070 
finished camp so now I've got a nice

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.900 
finished camp so now I've got a nice
tight<00:00:36.400> string<00:00:37.920> and<00:00:38.920> I<00:00:39.130> can<00:00:39.340> just<00:00:39.520> spread<00:00:39.880> my

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:39.910 
tight string and I can just spread my

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:45.780 
tight string and I can just spread my
tube<00:00:40.330> pin<00:00:40.630> out<00:00:43.980> so<00:00:44.980> now<00:00:45.100> if<00:00:45.220> you<00:00:45.340> can<00:00:45.520> imagine

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:45.790 
tube pin out so now if you can imagine

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:47.940 
tube pin out so now if you can imagine
that<00:00:46.120> this<00:00:46.270> is<00:00:46.330> 4-foot<00:00:47.110> is<00:00:47.230> 8<00:00:47.379> foot<00:00:47.650> we've

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:47.950 
that this is 4-foot is 8 foot we've

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:50.160 
that this is 4-foot is 8 foot we've
actually<00:00:48.160> tied<00:00:48.520> two<00:00:48.730> of<00:00:48.820> these<00:00:48.910> together<00:00:49.170> you

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.170 
actually tied two of these together you

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.509 
actually tied two of these together you
can<00:00:50.410> see<00:00:50.970> that<00:00:51.970> we've<00:00:52.120> got<00:00:52.300> our<00:00:52.360> toothed<00:00:52.720> tail

00:00:53.509 --> 00:00:53.519 
can see that we've got our toothed tail

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:57.930 
can see that we've got our toothed tail
so<00:00:54.519> where<00:00:54.760> we<00:00:55.379> get<00:00:56.379> in<00:00:56.500> the<00:00:56.620> ground<00:00:56.920> we<00:00:57.580> can<00:00:57.760> get

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 
so where we get in the ground we can get

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.200 
so where we get in the ground we can get
that<00:00:58.150> get<00:00:59.080> right<00:00:59.230> in<00:00:59.440> there<00:00:59.650> and<00:01:00.000> have<00:01:01.000> our

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.210 
that get right in there and have our

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.780 
that get right in there and have our
material<00:01:01.720> covered<00:01:02.080> over<00:01:02.230> for<00:01:02.559> the<00:01:02.680> night<00:01:02.890> one

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:03.790 
material covered over for the night one

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:05.700 
material covered over for the night one
problem<00:01:04.210> is<00:01:04.390> that<00:01:04.690> this<00:01:04.839> is<00:01:04.900> going<00:01:05.230> to<00:01:05.320> slide

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:05.710 
problem is that this is going to slide

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.550 
problem is that this is going to slide
so<00:01:06.460> let<00:01:06.610> me<00:01:06.730> show<00:01:06.940> you<00:01:07.000> a<00:01:07.120> trick<00:01:07.240> that<00:01:07.840> will

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.560 
so let me show you a trick that will

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.920 
so let me show you a trick that will
stop<00:01:08.830> that<00:01:08.860> from<00:01:09.310> sliding<00:01:09.670> and<00:01:10.030> how<00:01:10.570> to<00:01:10.630> tie

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:10.930 
stop that from sliding and how to tie

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.850 
stop that from sliding and how to tie
off<00:01:11.110> a<00:01:11.140> tarp<00:01:11.590> or<00:01:11.860> a<00:01:12.120> tent<00:01:13.120> to<00:01:13.780> a<00:01:13.810> court<00:01:14.200> what<00:01:14.830> I

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:14.860 
off a tarp or a tent to a court what I

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.219 
off a tarp or a tent to a court what I
do<00:01:14.979> to<00:01:15.220> tie<00:01:15.400> this<00:01:15.460> off<00:01:15.850> you<00:01:16.479> simply<00:01:16.990> have<00:01:17.200> a

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:17.229 
do to tie this off you simply have a

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:19.410 
do to tie this off you simply have a
little<00:01:17.680> loop<00:01:17.890> of<00:01:18.070> cordage<00:01:18.790> this<00:01:19.060> is<00:01:19.180> about<00:01:19.360> a

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
little loop of cordage this is about a

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.500 
little loop of cordage this is about a
foot<00:01:19.690> long<00:01:19.750> and<00:01:20.110> a<00:01:21.100> small<00:01:21.460> rock<00:01:21.790> now<00:01:22.330> I<00:01:22.360> have

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:22.510 
foot long and a small rock now I have

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:24.749 
foot long and a small rock now I have
two<00:01:22.780> one<00:01:23.020> for<00:01:23.259> each<00:01:23.320> end<00:01:23.619> let<00:01:24.310> me<00:01:24.399> show<00:01:24.549> you<00:01:24.640> how

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:24.759 
two one for each end let me show you how

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:28.260 
two one for each end let me show you how
I<00:01:24.790> use<00:01:25.030> those<00:01:25.890> if<00:01:26.890> I<00:01:27.130> lay<00:01:27.280> this<00:01:27.460> loop<00:01:27.759> here<00:01:28.090> and

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
I use those if I lay this loop here and

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.969 
I use those if I lay this loop here and
I<00:01:28.899> pull<00:01:29.229> it<00:01:29.409> around<00:01:30.159> and<00:01:31.320> then<00:01:32.320> around<00:01:32.649> again

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:32.979 
I pull it around and then around again

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:34.770 
I pull it around and then around again
we<00:01:33.460> make<00:01:33.640> a<00:01:33.670> little<00:01:33.880> knot<00:01:34.119> called<00:01:34.390> a<00:01:34.509> prusik

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 
we make a little knot called a prusik

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.149 
we make a little knot called a prusik
knot<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:36.310> when<00:01:36.430> you<00:01:36.549> pull<00:01:36.729> this<00:01:36.880> knot<00:01:37.149> tight

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
knot and when you pull this knot tight

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.520 
knot and when you pull this knot tight
it<00:01:39.159> has<00:01:39.189> some<00:01:39.579> neat<00:01:39.759> characteristics<00:01:40.530> it

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
it has some neat characteristics it

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.969 
it has some neat characteristics it
won't<00:01:41.799> slide<00:01:42.219> on<00:01:42.579> the<00:01:42.969> cordage<00:01:43.360> very<00:01:43.600> easy<00:01:43.979> but

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:44.979 
won't slide on the cordage very easy but

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:47.310 
won't slide on the cordage very easy but
I<00:01:45.009> can<00:01:45.280> move<00:01:45.430> it<00:01:45.610> simply<00:01:46.090> by<00:01:46.630> just<00:01:46.899> pushing<00:01:47.110> it

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 
I can move it simply by just pushing it

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.399 
I can move it simply by just pushing it
with<00:01:47.409> my<00:01:47.619> fingers<00:01:48.009> on<00:01:48.359> the<00:01:49.359> other<00:01:49.509> end<00:01:49.780> what

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:50.409

with my fingers on the other end what
I'm<00:01:50.530> going<00:01:50.829> to<00:01:50.920> do<00:01:51.240> is<00:01:52.240> to<00:01:52.960> tie<00:01:53.399> another<00:01:54.399> prusik

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:54.939 
I'm going to do is to tie another prusik

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:57.330 
I'm going to do is to tie another prusik
knot<00:01:55.619> let<00:01:56.619> me<00:01:56.740> show<00:01:56.890> you<00:01:56.950> how<00:01:57.039> to<00:01:57.130> do<00:01:57.219> that

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
knot let me show you how to do that

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.420 
knot let me show you how to do that
again<00:01:57.670> just<00:01:58.060> put<00:01:58.240> my<00:01:58.329> fingers<00:01:58.689> through<00:01:59.430> flip

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 
again just put my fingers through flip

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.810 
again just put my fingers through flip
it<00:02:00.579> over<00:02:00.729> so<00:02:01.000> I<00:02:01.030> have<00:02:01.210> two<00:02:01.509> loops<00:02:02.670> then<00:02:03.670> I'm

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
it over so I have two loops then I'm

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.499 
it over so I have two loops then I'm
going<00:02:04.090> to<00:02:04.179> put<00:02:04.359> the<00:02:04.509> loops<00:02:04.750> together<00:02:06.119> and<00:02:07.119> I

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:07.509 
going to put the loops together and I

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:11.700 
going to put the loops together and I
take<00:02:07.750> my<00:02:07.780> little<00:02:08.200> rock<00:02:08.410> and<00:02:08.800> I<00:02:09.310> put<00:02:09.580> inside<00:02:10.710> of

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
my garbage bag and I attach my prusik

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.830 
my garbage bag and I attach my prusik
knot<00:02:16.510> over<00:02:17.380> top<00:02:17.740> of<00:02:17.890> the<00:02:17.950> rock<00:02:18.600> that<00:02:19.600> will<00:02:19.750> hold

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
knot over top of the rock that will hold

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.110 
knot over top of the rock that will hold
that<00:02:20.050> plastic<00:02:20.590> in<00:02:20.710> place<00:02:20.740> for<00:02:21.310> me<00:02:21.430> when<00:02:21.820> I<00:02:21.850> pull

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
that plastic in place for me when I pull

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.870 
that plastic in place for me when I pull
that<00:02:22.150> tight<00:02:22.920> it's<00:02:23.920> not<00:02:24.160> going<00:02:24.370> to<00:02:24.430> go<00:02:24.550> anywhere

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
that tight it's not going to go anywhere

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.350 
that tight it's not going to go anywhere
and<00:02:25.740> then<00:02:26.740> I<00:02:26.860> can<00:02:27.069> simply<00:02:27.310> slide<00:02:27.819> this<00:02:28.090> to

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
and then I can simply slide this to

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.360 
and then I can simply slide this to
where<00:02:28.480> I<00:02:28.510> want<00:02:28.750> it<00:02:28.810> to<00:02:28.959> keep<00:02:29.080> its<00:02:29.319> trumped<00:02:29.800> so

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
where I want it to keep its trumped so

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:31.530 
where I want it to keep its trumped so
let's<00:02:30.580> go<00:02:30.760> ahead<00:02:30.970> and<00:02:31.090> do<00:02:31.180> it<00:02:31.300> on<00:02:31.390> the<00:02:31.510> other

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
let's go ahead and do it on the other

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:32.700 
let's go ahead and do it on the other
side<00:02:31.750> and<00:02:32.230> show<00:02:32.560> you

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:32.710 
side and show you

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:38.190 
side and show you
how<00:02:32.800> it<00:02:32.950> sets<00:02:33.190> up<00:02:36.450> again<00:02:37.450> to<00:02:37.600> make<00:02:37.750> that<00:02:37.930> press

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
how it sets up again to make that press

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.400 
how it sets up again to make that press
ik<00:02:38.440> simply<00:02:38.860> pull<00:02:39.100> it<00:02:39.220> over<00:02:39.370> twice<00:02:40.300> you<00:02:41.200> go

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
ik simply pull it over twice you go

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.410 
ik simply pull it over twice you go
three<00:02:41.680> times<00:02:41.920> if<00:02:42.130> you<00:02:42.190> want<00:02:42.490> twice<00:02:42.850> as<00:02:43.150> enough

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
three times if you want twice as enough

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.120 
three times if you want twice as enough
and<00:02:43.750> really<00:02:44.140> suffice<00:02:44.650> this<00:02:44.860> for<00:02:45.070> an

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
and really suffice this for an

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:50.760 
and really suffice this for an
application<00:02:45.490> like<00:02:45.790> this<00:02:47.070> put<00:02:48.070> my<00:02:48.220> rock<00:02:49.770> right

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:50.770 
application like this put my rock right

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:56.820 
application like this put my rock right
inside<00:02:51.160> the<00:02:51.310> plastic<00:02:55.050> make<00:02:56.050> another<00:02:56.350> prusik

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
inside the plastic make another prusik

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:01.040 
inside the plastic make another prusik
knot<00:02:57.120> and<00:02:58.590> just<00:02:59.590> throw<00:02:59.800> that<00:03:00.010> over<00:03:00.160> my<00:03:00.400> rock

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
knot and just throw that over my rock

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:07.470 
knot and just throw that over my rock
and<00:03:02.050> pull<00:03:02.560> it<00:03:02.710> tight<00:03:04.860> now<00:03:05.860> you<00:03:06.700> can<00:03:06.940> see<00:03:07.150> I<00:03:07.180> can

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
and pull it tight now you can see I can

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.250 
and pull it tight now you can see I can
stretch<00:03:07.780> out<00:03:08.730> the<00:03:09.730> top<00:03:09.970> of<00:03:10.000> this<00:03:10.300> and<00:03:10.600> keep<00:03:11.110> it

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
stretch out the top of this and keep it

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.250 
stretch out the top of this and keep it
nice<00:03:11.440> and<00:03:11.470> taut<00:03:12.450> so<00:03:13.450> let's<00:03:13.660> see<00:03:13.840> how<00:03:13.990> it<00:03:14.110> works

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
nice and taut so let's see how it works

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.260 
nice and taut so let's see how it works
out

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.270 
out

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:17.580 
out
what<00:03:16.270> I've<00:03:16.390> done<00:03:16.660> because<00:03:16.870> this<00:03:17.170> is<00:03:17.320> only<00:03:17.440> a

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
what I've done because this is only a

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.320 
what I've done because this is only a
four<00:03:17.830> foot<00:03:18.040> model<00:03:18.370> as<00:03:18.460> I've<00:03:18.580> asked<00:03:18.880> Ricci<00:03:19.090> to

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330 
four foot model as I've asked Ricci to

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.090 
four foot model as I've asked Ricci to
get<00:03:19.480> in<00:03:19.600> there<00:03:19.810> and<00:03:19.990> to<00:03:20.560> show<00:03:20.710> you<00:03:20.770> how<00:03:20.860> it

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
get in there and to show you how it

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.630 
get in there and to show you how it
works

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
works

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.060 
works
but<00:03:22.000> you<00:03:22.120> can<00:03:22.360> see<00:03:22.630> that<00:03:23.350> we<00:03:23.500> have<00:03:23.680> our<00:03:23.830> tube

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
but you can see that we have our tube

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:26.640 
but you can see that we have our tube
tent<00:03:24.400> plenty<00:03:25.270> of<00:03:25.360> room<00:03:25.510> in<00:03:25.690> there<00:03:25.840> and<00:03:26.050> if<00:03:26.500> that

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
tent plenty of room in there and if that

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.110 
tent plenty of room in there and if that
was<00:03:26.830> eight<00:03:27.010> foot<00:03:27.280> we'd<00:03:27.460> have<00:03:27.580> plenty<00:03:27.790> of<00:03:27.940> room

for us and our gear let me show you one
more<00:03:31.300> trick<00:03:31.720> with<00:03:32.020> the<00:03:32.140> garbage<00:03:32.500> bag<00:03:32.770> and<00:03:33.040> how

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
more trick with the garbage bag and how

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.300 
more trick with the garbage bag and how
you<00:03:33.670> can<00:03:33.970> make<00:03:34.150> a<00:03:34.180> shelter<00:03:34.750> that's<00:03:35.380> a<00:03:35.920> little

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
you can make a shelter that's a little

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:37.500 
you can make a shelter that's a little
more<00:03:37.030> Airy

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
more Airy

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.410 
more Airy

garbage bag and there's probably other

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:43.200 
garbage bag and there's probably other
ways<00:03:42.040> than<00:03:42.250> this<00:03:42.400> but<00:03:42.610> the<00:03:42.730> last<00:03:42.910> way<00:03:43.090> we're

couple of different tie offs out here to

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:37.640 
couple of different tie offs out here to
demonstrate<00:04:35.520> for<00:04:35.760> you<00:04:36.140> this<00:04:37.140> is<00:04:37.320> just<00:04:37.530> a

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
demonstrate for you this is just a

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.510 
demonstrate for you this is just a
little<00:04:37.800> stake<00:04:38.190> and<00:04:39.180> that's<00:04:39.780> tied<00:04:40.050> out<00:04:40.520> over

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
little stake and that's tied out over

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:46.190 
little stake and that's tied out over
here<00:04:42.620> we<00:04:43.620> have<00:04:43.860> a<00:04:44.190> tree<00:04:44.760> branch<00:04:44.970> or<00:04:45.360> tree

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:46.200 
here we have a tree branch or tree

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.170 
here we have a tree branch or tree
perhaps<00:04:46.500> that's<00:04:46.980> standing<00:04:47.460> up<00:04:47.580> out<00:04:47.760> here<00:04:47.820> that

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180 
perhaps that's standing up out here that

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.990 
perhaps that's standing up out here that
we<00:04:48.300> could<00:04:48.510> tie<00:04:48.690> off<00:04:48.900> to<00:04:49.200> and<00:04:49.620> put<00:04:50.160> that<00:04:50.340> out<00:04:50.490> but

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
we could tie off to and put that out but

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.050 
we could tie off to and put that out but
you<00:04:51.150> can<00:04:51.330> see<00:04:51.570> our<00:04:51.690> tarp<00:04:52.050> has<00:04:52.490> now<00:04:53.490> opened<00:04:53.670> up

you can see our tarp has now opened up

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:58.760 
you can see our tarp has now opened up
to<00:04:54.780> give<00:04:54.960> us<00:04:55.430> almost<00:04:56.430> a<00:04:56.700> three<00:04:57.000> foot<00:04:57.270> by<00:04:57.770> six

could have been eight foot long but now

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:12.110 
could have been eight foot long but now
