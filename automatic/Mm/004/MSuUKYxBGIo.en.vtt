00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:10.360
 at this moment he accepted we met 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.880
 in the national monument the week hill 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.709
 castle is a site that is located 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.960
 100 kilometers from coyhaique and 3 kilometers 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:18.100
 kilometers from the castle hill town and 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.780
 who were around here were 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.090
 nomadic hunters and gatherers 

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:24.369
 tehuelches and these date roughly 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.180
 between 3000 asida seven thousand seven thousand 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:29.390
 years 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:32.599
 well the beginning starts from here and 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:35.420
 has about 40 meters long is 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:38.570
 a wall or an eaves with the orientation 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:40.310
 north therefore concept of having 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.410
 North orientation we have sunlight 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:44.390
 all day here is a very site 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.220
 protected from the wind from the rain that 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.739
 you observe not being very dry that 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.030
 We can notice or spend time without 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:51.770
 realize without looking for them and 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.239
 protect them here we already have we can 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.790
 start to locate do not do everything 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:57.710
 some hands of imprints of hands that 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:00.560
 we have on the rocks we can start 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.090
 to see us in your negative hands my 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.480
 positive hands 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:07.240
 here I'm sorry there are two hands that 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:09.160
 they are clearly positive and positive 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:13.120
 when I painted the palm of my hand 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:15.370
 the new concept took him to the rock and 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.780
 negative is this that is here 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.790
 example we are very marked very 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.820
 clearly is to place your hand on the rock 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:24.520
 and then some strip paint by the 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:27.400
 surroundings and how they did it at the most 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.900
 It was practical to put the paint on 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:32.290
 mouth 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:34.890
 solar the paint is believed to be an oxide 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:37.270
 of rock as the land of color 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.680
 obviously mixed with fats and 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.350
 the stockings of the animals that they 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.810
 they hunted and with that it is believed that asia the 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.310
 paint if we observe it first 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.760
 bet for truth that in the hands of 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:51.010
 guagua that the fingers are very small 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:54.760
 then beyond there is less positive of 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:57.580
 children also and also for there and 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:59.890
 small hands and you do us 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.630
 white hands 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.659
 It is generally true that almost all 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.760
 the panels if we look at them from afar 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:09.970
 we can observe more than look at it from 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:12.160
 close when one is very close is not 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:15.569
 only that the red blotch that if the 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.569
 we move away a little they are very clearly 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.730
 if you observe today here there are more 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.860
 hand but there is also something different already 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.690
 we can tell something that is no longer hand 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.780
 like this the rectangle that is here does not 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:32.200
 you see clearly speaks right of the 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:35.290
 sole of a shoe or plates plates like 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.870
 a good bell there are many hands 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.430
 negative there is that there is a yellow 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.980
 that we had not seen in three or four 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:44.350
 very marked fingers and this panel that 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.360
 he has very high hands 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.930
 we go have a hand up very 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:51.170
 above 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:53.340
 because ceremonies can be meetings 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.739
 rituals 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.140
 etcetera etcetera and all the certain 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:59.519
 posts all are hypotheses we can 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.330
 think many things and I think posts 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:02.330
 they can be positive
