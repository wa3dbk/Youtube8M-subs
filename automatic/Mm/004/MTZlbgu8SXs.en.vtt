pattern<00:02:11.709> of<00:02:11.980> the<00:02:12.700> trample<00:02:13.090> steam<00:02:13.120> now<00:02:13.930> once

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
pattern of the trample steam now once

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:15.660 
pattern of the trample steam now once
you<00:02:14.230> have<00:02:14.349> that<00:02:14.500> place<00:02:14.770> you<00:02:15.099> just<00:02:15.130> want<00:02:15.430> to<00:02:15.520> go

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
you have that place you just want to go

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.210 
you have that place you just want to go
and<00:02:16.000> stand<00:02:16.360> up<00:02:16.690> against<00:02:16.959> the<00:02:17.140> fence<00:02:17.410> and<00:02:17.920> walk

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
and stand up against the fence and walk

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.640 
and stand up against the fence and walk
very<00:02:18.550> very<00:02:18.880> slowly<00:02:19.390> into<00:02:20.140> that<00:02:20.260> trample<00:02:20.620> steam

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
very very slowly into that trample steam

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.650 
very very slowly into that trample steam
now<00:02:21.280> sometimes<00:02:21.640> it's<00:02:21.790> gonna<00:02:21.880> throw<00:02:22.209> you<00:02:22.270> over

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660

now sometimes it's gonna throw you over
the<00:02:22.780> fence<00:02:22.959> sometimes<00:02:23.830> you<00:02:24.010> won't<00:02:24.130> hit<00:02:24.370> it<00:02:24.400> but

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
the fence sometimes you won't hit it but

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.430 
the fence sometimes you won't hit it but
just<00:02:25.060> keep<00:02:25.180> trying<00:02:25.209> you'll<00:02:25.660> get<00:02:25.870> in<00:02:25.989> this<00:02:26.140> spot
