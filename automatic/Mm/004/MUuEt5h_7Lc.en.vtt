you're<00:00:36.149> climbing<00:00:36.329> ropes<00:00:36.750> unassisted<00:00:37.290> with

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
you're climbing ropes unassisted with

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.650 
you're climbing ropes unassisted with
gesture<00:00:38.010> strength<00:00:38.309> obviously<00:00:39.149> you<00:00:39.480> need<00:00:39.570> to

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
gesture strength obviously you need to

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.530 
gesture strength obviously you need to
make<00:00:39.809> sure<00:00:39.840> you're<00:00:40.050> physically<00:00:40.440> capable<00:00:41.540> make

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
make sure you're physically capable make

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.110 
make sure you're physically capable make
sure<00:00:42.690> you<00:00:42.809> warm<00:00:43.110> up<00:00:43.430> make<00:00:44.430> sure<00:00:44.460> you<00:00:44.850> stretch

sure you warm up make sure you stretch
off<00:00:45.480> I<00:00:46.410> always<00:00:47.309> use<00:00:49.100> resistance<00:00:50.100> bands<00:00:50.660> to

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
off I always use resistance bands to

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.450 
off I always use resistance bands to
warm<00:00:52.199> up<00:00:52.320> my<00:00:52.440> shoulders<00:00:52.890> everything<00:00:53.190> else

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
warm up my shoulders everything else

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.920 
warm up my shoulders everything else
obviously<00:00:53.820> we're<00:00:54.149> doing<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.360> basics<00:00:54.750> just

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
obviously we're doing the basics just

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.709 
obviously we're doing the basics just
now<00:00:55.140> which<00:00:55.320> is<00:00:55.500> not<00:00:56.190> too<00:00:56.399> bad<00:00:56.699> but<00:00:57.149> if<00:00:57.539> you're

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
now which is not too bad but if you're

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.590 
now which is not too bad but if you're
going<00:00:57.899> to<00:00:58.199> do<00:00:58.320> any<00:00:58.559> more<00:00:58.680> intense<00:00:59.280> stuff

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
going to do any more intense stuff

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.580 
going to do any more intense stuff
you've<00:01:00.600> got<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:00.809> make<00:01:00.899> sure<00:01:01.050> your<00:01:01.230> body<00:01:01.440> is

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
you've got to make sure your body is

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.490 
you've got to make sure your body is
properly<00:01:02.129> prepared<00:01:02.840> most<00:01:03.840> strength<00:01:04.229> and

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
properly prepared most strength and

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.620 
properly prepared most strength and
flexibility<00:01:05.129> we<00:01:05.880> might<00:01:06.030> go<00:01:06.150> into<00:01:06.270> some<00:01:06.540> of

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
flexibility we might go into some of

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.390 
flexibility we might go into some of
that<00:01:06.659> in<00:01:06.960> detail<00:01:07.020> in<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.710> future<00:01:08.010> but<00:01:08.189> just

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
that in detail in the future but just

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.910 
that in detail in the future but just
now<00:01:08.520> we're<00:01:08.820> going<00:01:09.180> over<00:01:09.299> some<00:01:09.990> basic<00:01:10.409> claims

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
now we're going over some basic claims

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.859 
now we're going over some basic claims
from<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.280> fake<00:01:11.490> manual<00:01:11.850> this<00:01:12.570> one<00:01:12.720> is

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
from the fake manual this one is

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.929 
from the fake manual this one is
basically<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.799> basic<00:01:14.250> claim<00:01:14.490> as<00:01:14.790> it's

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
basically the basic claim as it's

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.030 
basically the basic claim as it's
referred<00:01:15.090> to<00:01:15.240> in<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.479> manual<00:01:15.810> it's<00:01:16.530> a<00:01:16.680> rope

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040

climb using your feet as with the

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:26.510 
climb using your feet as with the
systems<00:01:22.009> so<00:01:23.330> very<00:01:24.330> easily<00:01:25.280> what<00:01:26.280> you're<00:01:26.400> going

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
systems so very easily what you're going

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.370 
systems so very easily what you're going
to<00:01:26.549> do<00:01:26.670> is<00:01:26.880> you're<00:01:27.060> gonna<00:01:27.119> have<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.509> Rope<00:01:27.720> the

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
to do is you're gonna have the Rope the

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.350 
to do is you're gonna have the Rope the
Rope<00:01:28.560> is<00:01:28.590> gonna<00:01:28.799> come<00:01:29.070> down<00:01:29.100> on<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.579> inside<00:01:30.150> of

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
Rope is gonna come down on the inside of

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.969 
Rope is gonna come down on the inside of
the<00:01:30.900> knee<00:01:31.579> and<00:01:32.579> lower<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.939> camera<00:01:33.299> slightly

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:36.979 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:41.719 

so<00:01:38.329> the<00:01:39.329> rope<00:01:39.509> is<00:01:39.780> going<00:01:40.020> to<00:01:40.110> come<00:01:40.490> from<00:01:41.490> the

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
so the rope is going to come from the

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.149 
so the rope is going to come from the
top<00:01:41.759> that's<00:01:42.180> coming<00:01:42.450> inside<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:42.930> knee<00:01:43.159> what's

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
top that's coming inside the knee what's

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.810 
top that's coming inside the knee what's
going<00:01:44.430> on<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.610> outside<00:01:45.090> of<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:46.350> calf<00:01:46.820> and

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
going on the outside of the calf and

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.050 
going on the outside of the calf and
you're<00:01:47.909> gonna<00:01:48.079> flex<00:01:49.079> your<00:01:49.320> foot<00:01:49.790> and<00:01:50.790> the

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
you're gonna flex your foot and the

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.600 
you're gonna flex your foot and the
other<00:01:51.210> foot<00:01:51.360> is<00:01:51.810> simply<00:01:52.409> going<00:01:52.590> to<00:01:52.680> come<00:01:53.430> up

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
other foot is simply going to come up

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:59.120 
other foot is simply going to come up
and<00:01:56.930> the<00:01:57.930> ball<00:01:58.110> of<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.469> other<00:01:58.680> foot<00:01:58.920> is<00:01:59.009> going

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
and the ball of the other foot is going

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.940 
and the ball of the other foot is going
to<00:01:59.219> just<00:01:59.369> press<00:01:59.610> down<00:02:01.250> against<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.310> foot<00:02:03.950> like

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
to just press down against the foot like

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.809 
to just press down against the foot like
so<00:02:05.630> very<00:02:06.630> simple<00:02:07.200> I'm<00:02:07.979> swinging<00:02:08.369> around<00:02:08.459> in

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
so very simple I'm swinging around in

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.180 
so very simple I'm swinging around in
frame<00:02:09.149> but<00:02:09.450> you<00:02:09.690> get<00:02:10.229> the<00:02:10.319> idea<00:02:10.349> so<00:02:10.890> you<00:02:10.920> just

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
frame but you get the idea so you just

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.460 
frame but you get the idea so you just
go<00:02:11.340> inside<00:02:12.090> me<00:02:12.360> outside<00:02:13.200> calf

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
go inside me outside calf

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.260 
go inside me outside calf
flex<00:02:15.470> the<00:02:15.680> foot<00:02:15.860> and<00:02:16.160> the<00:02:16.670> other<00:02:16.730> foot<00:02:16.970> comes
