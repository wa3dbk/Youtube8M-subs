and<00:00:41.399> consistency<00:00:42.329> in<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.020> rotation<00:00:43.350> and

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
and consistency in the rotation and

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.860 
and consistency in the rotation and
Santana<00:00:44.040> is<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:45.030> guy<00:00:45.180> who<00:00:45.239> would<00:00:45.510> provide

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
Santana is the guy who would provide

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.779 
Santana is the guy who would provide
that<00:00:46.110> but<00:00:46.590> in<00:00:46.800> terms<00:00:46.980> of<00:00:47.129> how<00:00:47.250> hot<00:00:47.520> and<00:00:47.640> heavy

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
that but in terms of how hot and heavy

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.690 
that but in terms of how hot and heavy
they<00:00:48.030> are<00:00:48.059> I<00:00:48.180> think<00:00:48.360> it<00:00:48.840> remains<00:00:49.129> the<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.550> way

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
they are I think it remains the the way

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.850 
they are I think it remains the the way
it's<00:00:50.910> been<00:00:51.059> all<00:00:51.210> winter<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.500> Blue<00:00:52.680> Jays

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
it's been all winter the the Blue Jays

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.799 
it's been all winter the the Blue Jays
have<00:00:52.980> their<00:00:53.190> price<00:00:53.460> I<00:00:53.789> don't<00:00:54.239> think<00:00:54.300> that's

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
have their price I don't think that's

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.779 
have their price I don't think that's
anywhere<00:00:55.379> near<00:00:55.649> what<00:00:55.860> Santana<00:00:56.309> is<00:00:56.430> seeking

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
anywhere near what Santana is seeking

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.250 
anywhere near what Santana is seeking
and<00:00:56.969> there's<00:00:57.449> a<00:00:57.510> bit<00:00:57.690> of<00:00:57.780> a<00:00:57.840> stalemate<00:00:58.079> between

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
and there's a bit of a stalemate between

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.979 
and there's a bit of a stalemate between
the<00:00:58.649> two<00:00:58.800> now<00:00:59.120> does<00:01:00.120> him<00:01:00.329> in<00:01:00.449> as<00:01:00.570> assigning

push Alex to to get involved more
heavily<00:01:04.350> at<00:01:04.530> this<00:01:04.680> point<00:01:04.949> I'm<00:01:05.670> not<00:01:05.729> sure

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
heavily at this point I'm not sure

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.719 
heavily at this point I'm not sure
because<00:01:06.420> a<00:01:06.810> one<00:01:07.770> thing<00:01:07.950> that<00:01:08.100> we've<00:01:08.220> seen<00:01:08.520> so

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
because a one thing that we've seen so

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.310 
because a one thing that we've seen so
far<00:01:08.909> in<00:01:09.030> camp<00:01:09.240> is<00:01:09.390> that<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.630> Blue<00:01:09.810> Jays<00:01:09.960> like

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
far in camp is that the Blue Jays like

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.990 
far in camp is that the Blue Jays like
the<00:01:10.530> internal<00:01:10.950> options<00:01:11.310> that<00:01:11.430> they<00:01:11.460> have<00:01:11.760> and

the internal options that they have and

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.210 
the internal options that they have and
whether<00:01:12.150> that's<00:01:12.360> posturing<00:01:12.960> or<00:01:13.049> not<00:01:13.200> they<00:01:14.070> at

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
whether that's posturing or not they at

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.249 
whether that's posturing or not they at
least<00:01:14.369> seem<00:01:14.640> willing<00:01:14.970> to<00:01:15.299> go<00:01:15.750> into<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.049> season

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.080 
a pretty big list of guys all fighting
for<00:01:34.439> that<00:01:34.560> spot<00:01:34.890> sure<00:01:35.369> there's<00:01:35.640> a<00:01:35.700> big<00:01:35.909> group

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
for that spot sure there's a big group

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.060 
for that spot sure there's a big group
but<00:01:36.329> I<00:01:36.509> think<00:01:36.900> what<00:01:37.049> you<00:01:37.140> can<00:01:37.320> do<00:01:37.680> is<00:01:37.829> probably

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
but I think what you can do is probably

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.969 
but I think what you can do is probably
narrow<00:01:38.579> it<00:01:38.820> down<00:01:38.850> to<00:01:39.360> four<00:01:40.200> real<00:01:40.380> contenders

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
narrow it down to four real contenders

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.940 
narrow it down to four real contenders

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
put on an impressive display now you

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.039

going to get from Rogers and Redman but

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.080 
going to get from Rogers and Redman but
there<00:01:58.140> there's<00:01:58.439> some<00:01:58.649> upside<00:01:59.100> to<00:01:59.579> Hutchison

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
there there's some upside to Hutchison
