in<00:00:32.250> this<00:00:32.309> hydrofoil<00:00:32.910> if<00:00:33.149> I<00:00:33.239> didn't<00:00:33.510> know<00:00:33.600> that

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
in this hydrofoil if I didn't know that

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.389 
in this hydrofoil if I didn't know that
he<00:00:33.870> went<00:00:34.020> to<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.260> middle<00:00:34.469> of<00:00:34.530> a<00:00:34.590> map<00:00:34.829> before<00:00:35.070> we

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
he went to the middle of a map before we

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.610 
he went to the middle of a map before we
used<00:00:35.700> fear<00:00:36.120> itself<00:00:36.480> then<00:00:36.989> I<00:00:37.020> may<00:00:37.410> not<00:00:37.559> have

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
used fear itself then I may not have

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.170 
used fear itself then I may not have
moves<00:00:37.890> quick<00:00:38.160> enough<00:00:38.190> as<00:00:38.610> you<00:00:38.879> can<00:00:38.940> see<00:00:39.090> you

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
moves quick enough as you can see you

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.520 
moves quick enough as you can see you
coming<00:00:39.420> people<00:00:39.600> don't<00:00:39.750> actually<00:00:39.899> make<00:00:40.320> it

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
coming people don't actually make it

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.619 
coming people don't actually make it
it's<00:00:41.070> just<00:00:41.219> about<00:00:41.460> knowing<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:41.969> fight<00:00:42.239> and<00:00:42.510> if

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
it's just about knowing the fight and if

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:43.910 
it's just about knowing the fight and if
you're<00:00:42.719> only<00:00:42.780> looking<00:00:42.899> through<00:00:43.140> that<00:00:43.170> kasbah

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
you're only looking through that kasbah

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.139 
you're only looking through that kasbah
then<00:00:44.129> you<00:00:44.250> might<00:00:44.399> not<00:00:44.430> make<00:00:44.640> it<00:00:44.700> in<00:00:44.879> time<00:00:45.090> so

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
then you might not make it in time so

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.790 
then you might not make it in time so
you're<00:00:45.780> just<00:00:45.870> going<00:00:46.020> to<00:00:46.110> know<00:00:46.230> exactly<00:00:46.649> what's

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
you're just going to know exactly what's

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.110 
you're just going to know exactly what's
going<00:00:46.920> to<00:00:47.010> happen<00:00:47.250> exactly<00:00:47.399> what<00:00:47.879> you<00:00:48.000> better

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
going to happen exactly what you better

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.540 
going to happen exactly what you better
do<00:00:48.329> it<00:00:48.360> in<00:00:48.480> reaction<00:00:48.930> to<00:00:48.960> that<00:00:49.230> step<00:00:49.739> 2<00:00:49.980> latency

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
do it in reaction to that step 2 latency

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.729 
do it in reaction to that step 2 latency
works<00:00:50.760> both<00:00:51.030> ways<00:00:51.329> just<00:00:52.020> as<00:00:52.140> you<00:00:52.289> get<00:00:52.440> hit<00:00:52.649> when

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
works both ways just as you get hit when

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.500 
works both ways just as you get hit when
you<00:00:52.890> appear<00:00:53.190> to<00:00:53.219> be<00:00:53.309> out<00:00:53.520> of<00:00:53.550> an<00:00:53.730> ability<00:00:53.969> you

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
you appear to be out of an ability you

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.060 
you appear to be out of an ability you
can<00:00:54.539> appear<00:00:54.930> to<00:00:55.020> get<00:00:55.140> hit<00:00:55.350> by<00:00:55.500> an<00:00:55.559> ability<00:00:55.829> but

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
can appear to get hit by an ability but

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.189 
can appear to get hit by an ability but
not<00:00:56.219> actually<00:00:56.430> get<00:00:56.879> hit<00:00:57.210> this<00:00:57.780> means<00:00:58.079> that

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
not actually get hit this means that

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.869 
not actually get hit this means that
alfred<00:00:58.590> ability<00:00:58.859> finishes<00:00:59.340> you<00:00:59.579> can<00:00:59.760> move

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
alfred ability finishes you can move

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.549 
alfred ability finishes you can move
into<00:01:00.149> it<00:01:00.359> faster<00:01:00.750> than<00:01:00.870> what<00:01:00.989> it<00:01:01.079> appears<00:01:01.379> you

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
into it faster than what it appears you

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:02.900 
into it faster than what it appears you

not<00:01:21.750> get<00:01:22.020> hit<00:01:22.170> by<00:01:22.409> it<00:01:22.470> which<00:01:22.740> is<00:01:22.890> really<00:01:22.920> handy

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
not get hit by it which is really handy

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.429 
not get hit by it which is really handy
in<00:01:23.610> fights<00:01:23.939> that<00:01:24.150> have<00:01:24.299> multiple<00:01:24.630> AOS<00:01:25.140> going

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
in fights that have multiple AOS going

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:26.929 
in fights that have multiple AOS going
everywhere<00:01:25.799> because<00:01:25.979> you<00:01:26.159> can<00:01:26.280> dodge<00:01:26.490> one<00:01:26.729> AOE

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
everywhere because you can dodge one AOE

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.850 
everywhere because you can dodge one AOE
by<00:01:27.180> moving<00:01:27.390> into<00:01:27.810> another<00:01:27.930> one<00:01:28.229> earlier<00:01:28.590> so

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
by moving into another one earlier so

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.499 
by moving into another one earlier so
that's<00:01:29.009> step<00:01:29.280> number<00:01:29.340> two<00:01:29.729> which<00:01:30.060> brings<00:01:30.360> us

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
that's step number two which brings us

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.510 
that's step number two which brings us
to<00:01:30.540> step<00:01:30.689> number<00:01:30.900> three<00:01:31.560> being<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.070> safest

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
to step number three being the safest

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.880 
to step number three being the safest
spot<00:01:32.790> possible<00:01:33.090> now<00:01:33.750> this<00:01:33.930> includes<00:01:34.530> being

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
spot possible now this includes being

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.950 
spot possible now this includes being
away<00:01:35.130> from<00:01:35.189> your<00:01:35.430> teammates<00:01:35.970> and<00:01:36.180> anyone<00:01:36.780> else

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
away from your teammates and anyone else

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.080 
away from your teammates and anyone else
who<00:01:37.229> can<00:01:37.439> draw<00:01:37.770> fire<00:01:38.250> towards<00:01:38.820> your<00:01:38.909> position

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
who can draw fire towards your position

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.390 
who can draw fire towards your position
that's<00:01:39.930> a<00:01:40.049> good<00:01:40.200> way<00:01:40.380> to<00:01:40.439> to<00:01:40.860> not<00:01:41.009> get<00:01:41.159> hit<00:01:41.280> by

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
that's a good way to to not get hit by

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.649 
that's a good way to to not get hit by
stuff<00:01:41.640> just<00:01:41.820> being<00:01:41.970> away<00:01:42.210> from<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.509> other

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
stuff just being away from the other

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.359 
stuff just being away from the other
teammates<00:01:43.020> if<00:01:43.170> possible<00:01:43.619> but<00:01:43.770> still<00:01:43.890> keep

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
teammates if possible but still keep

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.370 
teammates if possible but still keep
near<00:01:44.579> healers<00:01:45.060> but<00:01:45.329> well<00:01:45.600> I<00:01:45.630> really<00:01:45.990> mean<00:01:46.200> by

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
near healers but well I really mean by

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.990 
near healers but well I really mean by
being<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:46.770> safest<00:01:47.070> spot<00:01:47.280> possible<00:01:47.549> is

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
being the safest spot possible is

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.819 
being the safest spot possible is
knowing<00:01:48.630> where<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:48.960> AO<00:01:49.110> is<00:01:49.380> going<00:01:49.590> to<00:01:49.680> be<00:01:49.770> in

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
knowing where the AO is going to be in

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:50.870 
knowing where the AO is going to be in
the<00:01:49.920> fight<00:01:50.130> it<00:01:50.310> goes<00:01:50.430> back<00:01:50.610> to<00:01:50.640> step<00:01:50.850> one

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
the fight it goes back to step one

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.880 
the fight it goes back to step one
knowing<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.479> fire<00:01:51.720> but<00:01:52.259> being<00:01:52.680> in<00:01:52.799> that

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
knowing the fire but being in that

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.310 
knowing the fire but being in that
safest<00:01:53.340> position<00:01:53.430> so<00:01:54.000> that<00:01:54.030> you<00:01:54.390> can<00:01:54.659> move<00:01:54.899> the

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
safest position so that you can move the

step<00:02:43.060> four<00:02:43.120> move<00:02:43.930> a<00:02:44.079> lot<00:02:44.260> now<00:02:44.560> this<00:02:44.739> doesn't

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
step four move a lot now this doesn't

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:46.470 
step four move a lot now this doesn't
necessarily<00:02:45.190> mean<00:02:45.790> run<00:02:46.060> around<00:02:46.299> like<00:02:46.420> a

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
necessarily mean run around like a

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.449 
necessarily mean run around like a
headless<00:02:46.720> truck<00:02:47.200> or<00:02:47.349> anything<00:02:47.769> this<00:02:48.220> just

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
headless truck or anything this just

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:50.670 
headless truck or anything this just
means<00:02:48.700> once<00:02:49.360> you<00:02:49.450> find<00:02:49.750> that<00:02:49.900> safer<00:02:50.319> spot<00:02:50.530> in

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
means once you find that safer spot in

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.440 
means once you find that safer spot in
the<00:02:50.739> fight<00:02:51.010> don't<00:02:51.670> be<00:02:51.760> just<00:02:51.910> rooted<00:02:52.180> in<00:02:52.269> that

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
the fight don't be just rooted in that

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.059 
the fight don't be just rooted in that
spot<00:02:52.810> just<00:02:53.170> move<00:02:53.410> around<00:02:53.560> even<00:02:54.040> though

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:54.069 
spot just move around even though

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:55.470 
spot just move around even though
whether<00:02:54.280> if<00:02:54.489> it's<00:02:54.579> just<00:02:54.760> like<00:02:54.879> a<00:02:54.910> few<00:02:55.180> meters

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
whether if it's just like a few meters

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.479 
whether if it's just like a few meters
sort<00:02:55.629> of<00:02:55.690> thing<00:02:55.810> from<00:02:55.959> side<00:02:56.230> to<00:02:56.379> side<00:02:56.410> I<00:02:56.950> found

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489 
sort of thing from side to side I found

00:02:57.489 --> 00:02:59.910 
sort of thing from side to side I found
it<00:02:57.610> easier<00:02:57.970> in<00:02:58.090> my<00:02:58.239> time<00:02:58.480> that<00:02:58.930> to<00:02:59.140> stop<00:02:59.650> to

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
it easier in my time that to stop to

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.920 
it easier in my time that to stop to
avoid<00:03:00.160> ability<00:03:00.700> than<00:03:01.030> to<00:03:01.269> try<00:03:01.660> and<00:03:01.750> start

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
avoid ability than to try and start

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.420 
avoid ability than to try and start
running<00:03:02.110> especially<00:03:02.440> if<00:03:02.739> they're<00:03:02.890> targeting

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
running especially if they're targeting

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.069 
running especially if they're targeting
you<00:03:03.700> because<00:03:03.940> hopefully<00:03:04.480> you're<00:03:04.750> standing

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:05.079 
you because hopefully you're standing

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:06.390 
you because hopefully you're standing
out<00:03:05.170> by<00:03:05.319> itself<00:03:05.620> so<00:03:05.829> the<00:03:05.920> only<00:03:06.010> time<00:03:06.190> you're

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
out by itself so the only time you're

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.890 
out by itself so the only time you're
going<00:03:06.519> to<00:03:06.579> get<00:03:06.640> hit<00:03:06.819> by<00:03:06.940> something<00:03:07.209> is<00:03:07.480> if<00:03:07.750> it's

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
going to get hit by something is if it's

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.559 
going to get hit by something is if it's
actually<00:03:08.230> targeted<00:03:08.739> at<00:03:08.920> you<00:03:09.160> and<00:03:09.430> I<00:03:10.150> always

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:10.569 
actually targeted at you and I always

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:12.930 
actually targeted at you and I always
get<00:03:10.750> thrown<00:03:11.140> where<00:03:11.829> you<00:03:12.099> are<00:03:12.250> standing<00:03:12.489> not

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
get thrown where you are standing not

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.640 
get thrown where you are standing not
where<00:03:13.150> you're<00:03:13.239> going<00:03:13.600> so<00:03:13.630> if<00:03:14.019> you're<00:03:14.170> moving

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
where you're going so if you're moving

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.199 
where you're going so if you're moving
then<00:03:14.920> it's<00:03:15.160> not<00:03:15.310> going<00:03:15.370> to<00:03:15.579> hit<00:03:15.670> you<00:03:15.700> anyway<00:03:16.150> so

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
then it's not going to hit you anyway so

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:18.599 
then it's not going to hit you anyway so
I<00:03:16.780> just<00:03:17.290> found<00:03:17.410> it<00:03:17.500> a<00:03:17.590> lot<00:03:17.769> easier<00:03:17.799> if<00:03:18.400> I'm

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:18.609 
I just found it a lot easier if I'm

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:20.550 
I just found it a lot easier if I'm
already<00:03:18.850> moving<00:03:19.150> to<00:03:19.510> avoid<00:03:19.840> the<00:03:19.959> AOS<00:03:20.290> rather

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
already moving to avoid the AOS rather

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:21.840 
already moving to avoid the AOS rather
than<00:03:20.680> when<00:03:20.799> I'm<00:03:20.950> standing<00:03:21.280> still<00:03:21.519> are<00:03:21.670> not

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
than when I'm standing still are not

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:23.460 
than when I'm standing still are not
going<00:03:21.970> to<00:03:22.060> be<00:03:22.120> harder<00:03:22.510> for<00:03:22.540> you<00:03:22.720> casters<00:03:23.319> and

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
going to be harder for you casters and

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.020 
going to be harder for you casters and
that<00:03:23.590> when<00:03:23.799> you're<00:03:23.920> rooted<00:03:24.310> but<00:03:24.489> try<00:03:24.700> casting

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
that when you're rooted but try casting

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:26.729 
that when you're rooted but try casting
and<00:03:25.450> moving<00:03:25.720> just<00:03:25.930> get<00:03:26.049> that<00:03:26.170> momentum<00:03:26.440> up

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
and moving just get that momentum up

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:28.650 
and moving just get that momentum up
it's<00:03:26.920> going<00:03:27.040> to<00:03:27.099> make<00:03:27.220> it<00:03:27.370> a<00:03:27.430> lot<00:03:27.639> easier<00:03:27.849> now

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
it's going to make it a lot easier now

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.270 
it's going to make it a lot easier now
just<00:03:28.840> a<00:03:28.930> few<00:03:29.019> more<00:03:29.290> tips<00:03:29.530> so<00:03:29.709> just<00:03:29.889> aren't<00:03:30.190> in

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
just a few more tips so just aren't in

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.460 
just a few more tips so just aren't in
the<00:03:30.370> steps<00:03:30.700> but<00:03:31.209> I<00:03:31.480> didn't<00:03:31.780> want<00:03:31.810> to<00:03:32.049> try<00:03:32.380> and

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
the steps but I didn't want to try and

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.650 
the steps but I didn't want to try and
exclude<00:03:32.859> classes<00:03:33.400> or<00:03:33.579> do<00:03:33.790> anything<00:03:34.000> it's<00:03:34.599> just

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
exclude classes or do anything it's just

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.089 
exclude classes or do anything it's just
anything<00:03:35.019> that<00:03:35.109> people<00:03:35.290> couldn't<00:03:35.530> do<00:03:35.739> but

00:03:36.089 --> 00:03:36.099 
anything that people couldn't do but

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:37.259 
anything that people couldn't do but
it's<00:03:36.579> always<00:03:36.670> going<00:03:36.819> to<00:03:36.880> be<00:03:36.940> a<00:03:37.000> little<00:03:37.120> bit

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:37.269 
it's always going to be a little bit

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:39.330 
it's always going to be a little bit
easier<00:03:37.569> if<00:03:37.630> your<00:03:37.780> ranged<00:03:38.380> if<00:03:38.590> your<00:03:38.799> melee<00:03:38.950> dps

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
easier if your ranged if your melee dps

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:40.530 
easier if your ranged if your melee dps
is<00:03:39.400> going<00:03:39.519> to<00:03:39.579> struggle<00:03:39.790> a<00:03:39.940> little<00:03:40.030> bit<00:03:40.150> more

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
is going to struggle a little bit more

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:41.849 
is going to struggle a little bit more
because<00:03:40.780> there's<00:03:41.019> a<00:03:41.079> lot<00:03:41.230> more<00:03:41.260> going<00:03:41.530> on<00:03:41.799> in

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:41.859 
because there's a lot more going on in

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:44.909 
because there's a lot more going on in
close<00:03:42.549> in<00:03:42.940> most<00:03:43.209> fights<00:03:43.540> and<00:03:43.840> tanks<00:03:44.530> for<00:03:44.889> the

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.000 
didn't think it deserved a step but it's
pretty<00:04:04.690> obvious<00:04:04.989> he's<00:04:05.109> moved<00:04:05.349> so<00:04:05.530> slowly<00:04:05.590> like

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
pretty obvious he's moved so slowly like

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:07.559 
pretty obvious he's moved so slowly like
sometimes<00:04:06.340> you<00:04:06.459> get<00:04:06.549> caught<00:04:06.819> out<00:04:06.970> do<00:04:07.480> you

00:04:07.559 --> 00:04:07.569 
sometimes you get caught out do you

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:09.089 
sometimes you get caught out do you
think<00:04:07.810> I'm<00:04:08.079> pretty<00:04:08.230> close<00:04:08.530> i<00:04:08.560> can<00:04:08.799> just<00:04:08.950> walk

00:04:09.089 --> 00:04:09.099 
think I'm pretty close i can just walk

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:10.229 
think I'm pretty close i can just walk
backwards<00:04:09.489> out<00:04:09.579> of<00:04:09.609> it<00:04:09.790> but<00:04:09.910> it<00:04:10.000> doesn't

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:10.239 
backwards out of it but it doesn't

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:12.000 
backwards out of it but it doesn't
really<00:04:10.299> work<00:04:10.510> try<00:04:10.750> and<00:04:10.900> stick<00:04:11.139> to<00:04:11.169> walking

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
really work try and stick to walking

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.210 
really work try and stick to walking
sideways<00:04:12.459> or<00:04:12.910> forward<00:04:13.319> preferably<00:04:14.319> so<00:04:14.709> i<00:04:15.040> hope

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
sideways or forward preferably so i hope

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.009
