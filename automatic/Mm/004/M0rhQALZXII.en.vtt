think<00:01:00.750> that's<00:01:00.870> most<00:01:00.960> because<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.379> sniper

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
think that's most because the sniper

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.740 
think that's most because the sniper
rifle<00:01:02.070> we<00:01:02.820> don't<00:01:02.910> know<00:01:03.059> too<00:01:03.120> much<00:01:03.300> of<00:01:03.449> talk<00:01:03.629> to

objective<00:01:48.840> maybe<00:01:49.530> this<00:01:49.740> little<00:01:49.770> point<00:01:50.159> on<00:01:50.250> the

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
objective maybe this little point on the

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.190 
objective maybe this little point on the
map<00:01:50.369> that<00:01:50.759> otherwise<00:01:51.149> wouldn't<00:01:51.509> be<00:01:51.689> important

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
map that otherwise wouldn't be important

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.620 
map that otherwise wouldn't be important
maybe<00:01:52.770> it's<00:01:52.860> out<00:01:53.040> of<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.250> way<00:01:53.329> but<00:01:54.329> now

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
maybe it's out of the way but now

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:55.760 
maybe it's out of the way but now
something<00:01:55.110> you're<00:01:55.200> gonna<00:01:55.290> have<00:01:55.409> to<00:01:55.500> think

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
something you're gonna have to think

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.620 
something you're gonna have to think
okay<00:01:56.100> quite<00:01:56.640> a<00:01:56.670> bit<00:01:56.729> of<00:01:56.909> standing<00:01:57.240> here<00:01:57.360> maybe

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
okay quite a bit of standing here maybe

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.510 
okay quite a bit of standing here maybe
I'm<00:01:57.750> going<00:01:57.869> to<00:01:57.960> go<00:01:58.020> try<00:01:58.079> and<00:01:58.229> control<00:01:58.619> that<00:01:58.979> so

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
I'm going to go try and control that so

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.920 
I'm going to go try and control that so
that<00:01:59.670> we<00:01:59.820> can<00:02:00.000> pick<00:02:00.149> up<00:02:00.240> that<00:02:00.390> item<00:02:00.719> that

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
that we can pick up that item that

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.170 
that we can pick up that item that
weapon<00:02:01.350> that<00:02:01.890> that<00:02:02.250> equipment<00:02:02.729> whatever<00:02:02.909> it

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
weapon that that equipment whatever it

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.429 
weapon that that equipment whatever it
may<00:02:03.329> be<00:02:03.360> that<00:02:03.509> may<00:02:03.840> give<00:02:04.079> us<00:02:04.200> a<00:02:04.320> little

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
may be that may give us a little

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.679 
may be that may give us a little
advantage<00:02:04.770> now<00:02:05.070> you<00:02:05.549> know<00:02:05.670> they're<00:02:06.119> creating

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
advantage now you know they're creating

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.150 
advantage now you know they're creating
another<00:02:06.869> objective<00:02:07.290> they're<00:02:07.619> creating<00:02:08.009> more

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
another objective they're creating more

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.240 
another objective they're creating more
strategy<00:02:08.640> and

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
strategy and

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.940 
strategy and
and<00:02:09.369> by<00:02:10.149> extension<00:02:10.270> more<00:02:10.720> tactical<00:02:11.230> play<00:02:11.440> you

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
and by extension more tactical play you

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.120 
and by extension more tactical play you

don't know what kind of balancing

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:37.230 
don't know what kind of balancing
they're<00:02:35.860> gonna<00:02:35.950> have<00:02:36.190> to<00:02:36.370> make<00:02:36.910> this<00:02:36.970> bounce

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240 
they're gonna have to make this bounce

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.090 
they're gonna have to make this bounce
out<00:02:37.390> maybe<00:02:37.540> you<00:02:37.690> can't<00:02:37.900> sprint<00:02:38.290> with<00:02:38.410> it<00:02:38.560> may

crutch for gun balancing this this idea
this<00:03:17.470> concept<00:03:17.680> as<00:03:18.070> Matt<00:03:18.549> balancing<00:03:19.090> I<00:03:19.239> like

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
this concept as Matt balancing I like

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.720 
this concept as Matt balancing I like
you're<00:03:20.440> creating<00:03:20.860> another<00:03:21.070> you<00:03:21.670> know

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
you're creating another you know

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.520 
you're creating another you know
strategic<00:03:22.269> point<00:03:22.480> to<00:03:22.570> fight<00:03:22.780> over<00:03:22.930> as<00:03:23.140> I<00:03:23.260> said

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
strategic point to fight over as I said

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.080 
strategic point to fight over as I said
something<00:03:24.130> you're<00:03:24.310> gonna<00:03:24.430> want<00:03:24.519> to<00:03:24.640> control

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
something you're gonna want to control

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.030 
something you're gonna want to control
now<00:03:25.720> I<00:03:25.750> do<00:03:25.959> worry<00:03:26.260> the<00:03:26.410> people<00:03:26.680> are<00:03:26.769> going<00:03:26.890> to

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
now I do worry the people are going to

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.830 
now I do worry the people are going to
just<00:03:27.190> camp<00:03:27.519> this<00:03:27.730> spawn<00:03:28.060> so<00:03:28.360> I<00:03:28.390> need<00:03:28.660> to<00:03:28.750> hear

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
just camp this spawn so I need to hear

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.229 
just camp this spawn so I need to hear
more<00:03:29.049> about<00:03:29.110> how<00:03:29.560> it<00:03:29.590> spawns<00:03:30.040> is<00:03:30.670> on<00:03:30.850> a<00:03:30.910> timer

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:31.239 
more about how it spawns is on a timer

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:33.360 
more about how it spawns is on a timer
again<00:03:31.720> is<00:03:31.989> it<00:03:32.110> is<00:03:32.260> it<00:03:32.410> just<00:03:32.440> dynamic<00:03:33.100> is<00:03:33.250> it

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
again is it is it just dynamic is it

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:34.830 
again is it is it just dynamic is it
totally<00:03:33.790> random<00:03:34.120> so<00:03:34.269> that<00:03:34.420> there's<00:03:34.570> no<00:03:34.600> reason

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
totally random so that there's no reason

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.420 
totally random so that there's no reason
to<00:03:34.870> even<00:03:34.930> look<00:03:35.170> for<00:03:35.320> this<00:03:35.410> thing<00:03:35.620> you<00:03:36.070> may<00:03:36.250> just

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
to even look for this thing you may just

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.880 
to even look for this thing you may just
happen<00:03:36.640> upon<00:03:36.880> it<00:03:37.360> I<00:03:37.510> don't<00:03:38.019> know<00:03:38.170> is<00:03:38.410> it<00:03:38.829> a

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
happen upon it I don't know is it a

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:40.560 
happen upon it I don't know is it a
prize<00:03:39.100> you<00:03:39.340> get<00:03:39.459> for<00:03:39.670> holding<00:03:40.000> some<00:03:40.120> objective

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:40.570 
prize you get for holding some objective

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:41.819 
prize you get for holding some objective
point<00:03:40.690> as<00:03:40.870> we<00:03:40.989> know<00:03:41.079> the<00:03:41.200> kind<00:03:41.380> of<00:03:41.410> how<00:03:41.500> I<00:03:41.530> have

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:41.829 
point as we know the kind of how I have

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:45.870

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
control a certain point you get that

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:48.780 
control a certain point you get that
controlled<00:03:47.650> by<00:03:47.769> your<00:03:47.860> team<00:03:48.100> could<00:03:48.549> be<00:03:48.670> the

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 
so I don't know we obviously need to

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.290 
so I don't know we obviously need to
hear<00:04:36.800> more<00:04:36.920> information<00:04:37.130> about<00:04:37.790> this<00:04:38.030> we<00:04:38.210> need

to<00:04:38.390> hear<00:04:38.480> more<00:04:38.630> details<00:04:38.660> need<00:04:39.170> to<00:04:39.230> see<00:04:39.350> how<00:04:39.410> it

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:39.500 
to hear more details need to see how it

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.890 
to hear more details need to see how it
plays<00:04:39.590> out<00:04:39.860> but<00:04:40.430> once<00:04:40.730> again<00:04:40.880> the<00:04:41.240> caveat<00:04:41.870> on

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:41.900 
plays out but once again the caveat on
