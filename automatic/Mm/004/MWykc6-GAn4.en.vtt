always light things on fire absolutely

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.230 
always light things on fire absolutely
so<00:00:24.440> I'm<00:00:24.920> going<00:00:24.980> to<00:00:25.130> let<00:00:25.280> you<00:00:25.340> take<00:00:25.670> it<00:00:25.820> over<00:00:26.060> and

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:26.240 
so I'm going to let you take it over and

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.359 
so I'm going to let you take it over and
you<00:00:26.570> can<00:00:26.840> teach<00:00:26.960> me<00:00:27.020> how<00:00:27.230> to<00:00:27.320> make<00:00:27.380> fire<00:00:27.650> okay

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:28.369 
you can teach me how to make fire okay

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:30.670 
you can teach me how to make fire okay
so<00:00:28.430> we're<00:00:28.789> here<00:00:29.000> in<00:00:29.210> in<00:00:29.539> a<00:00:29.630> wetland<00:00:29.930> forest<00:00:30.440> in

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:30.680 
so we're here in in a wetland forest in

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.100 
so we're here in in a wetland forest in
southern<00:00:31.010> Ontario<00:00:31.580> so<00:00:32.360> in<00:00:32.509> a<00:00:32.570> wetland<00:00:32.840> it<00:00:33.020> can

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.110 
southern Ontario so in a wetland it can

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:34.900 
southern Ontario so in a wetland it can
be<00:00:33.200> very<00:00:33.350> challenging<00:00:33.530> to<00:00:33.920> find<00:00:33.950> dry<00:00:34.460> material

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:34.910 
be very challenging to find dry material

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:36.220 
be very challenging to find dry material
the<00:00:35.000> best<00:00:35.210> thing<00:00:35.390> to<00:00:35.480> do<00:00:35.600> is<00:00:35.720> to<00:00:35.750> find<00:00:36.050> any

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:36.230 
the best thing to do is to find any

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:37.960 
the best thing to do is to find any
material<00:00:36.739> that<00:00:36.860> sticks<00:00:37.160> up<00:00:37.280> off<00:00:37.640> the<00:00:37.850> ground

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:37.970 
material that sticks up off the ground

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.660 
material that sticks up off the ground
so<00:00:38.720> if<00:00:38.810> you<00:00:38.930> have<00:00:39.079> a<00:00:39.110> stick<00:00:39.590> like<00:00:39.800> this<00:00:40.130> and<00:00:40.550> its

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:40.670 
so if you have a stick like this and its

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:42.760 
so if you have a stick like this and its
resting<00:00:41.329> on<00:00:41.480> the<00:00:41.660> ground<00:00:41.690> up<00:00:42.200> right<00:00:42.500> kind<00:00:42.739> of

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:42.770 
resting on the ground up right kind of

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:44.350 
resting on the ground up right kind of
like<00:00:42.920> that<00:00:43.100> chances<00:00:43.850> are<00:00:44.000> that's<00:00:44.090> going<00:00:44.300> to

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:44.360 
like that chances are that's going to

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.240 
like that chances are that's going to
get<00:00:44.450> dry<00:00:44.690> so<00:00:45.020> this<00:00:45.170> is<00:00:45.320> really<00:00:45.530> really<00:00:45.800> usable

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.250 
get dry so this is really really usable

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.340 
get dry so this is really really usable
what<00:00:46.430> this<00:00:46.579> is<00:00:46.730> is<00:00:46.850> a<00:00:46.880> piece<00:00:47.149> of<00:00:47.180> cattail<00:00:47.690> after

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350 
what this is is a piece of cattail after

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:49.960 
what this is is a piece of cattail after
this<00:00:48.500> fluffy<00:00:49.040> looking<00:00:49.370> thing<00:00:49.550> this<00:00:49.730> is<00:00:49.940> a

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:49.970 
this fluffy looking thing this is a

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.030 
this fluffy looking thing this is a
cattail<00:00:50.239> as<00:00:50.600> well<00:00:50.750> but<00:00:51.170> this<00:00:51.230> is<00:00:51.440> one<00:00:51.590> to<00:00:51.950> the

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:52.040 
cattail as well but this is one to the

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.770 
cattail as well but this is one to the
summer<00:00:52.250> so<00:00:52.489> it's<00:00:52.520> kind<00:00:52.850> of<00:00:52.910> yeah<00:00:53.329> it<00:00:53.480> sort<00:00:53.750> of

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:53.780 
summer so it's kind of yeah it sort of

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.590 
summer so it's kind of yeah it sort of
exploded<00:00:54.320> and<00:00:54.590> I<00:00:55.250> was<00:00:55.700> trying<00:00:55.969> to<00:00:56.030> find<00:00:56.239> some

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 
exploded and I was trying to find some

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.420 
exploded and I was trying to find some
in<00:00:56.960> the<00:00:57.170> forest<00:00:57.530> that<00:00:57.649> were<00:00:57.800> tight<00:00:58.070> so<00:00:58.340> we

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:58.430 
in the forest that were tight so we

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:00.670 
in the forest that were tight so we
could<00:00:58.579> open<00:00:58.790> them<00:00:58.879> up<00:00:59.000> but<00:00:59.180> that's<00:00:59.390> okay<00:00:59.690> they

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680 
could open them up but that's okay they

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.290 
could open them up but that's okay they
still<00:01:00.950> work<00:01:01.100> very<00:01:01.370> very<00:01:01.460> well<00:01:01.670> and<00:01:01.940> as<00:01:02.059> you<00:01:02.149> can

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
still work very very well and as you can

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.549 
still work very very well and as you can
see<00:01:02.329> it's<00:01:02.600> kind<00:01:02.840> of<00:01:02.899> looks<00:01:03.260> almost<00:01:03.410> like

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:03.559 
see it's kind of looks almost like

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:05.679 
see it's kind of looks almost like
fiberglass<00:01:03.950> insulation<00:01:04.249> it<00:01:04.819> has<00:01:04.939> a<00:01:04.969> lot<00:01:05.659> of

00:01:05.679 --> 00:01:05.689 
fiberglass insulation it has a lot of

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:08.469 
fiberglass insulation it has a lot of
nice<00:01:05.929> loft<00:01:06.259> to<00:01:06.619> it<00:01:06.649> and<00:01:06.889> that<00:01:06.950> it<00:01:07.670> sparks<00:01:08.240> and

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:08.479 
nice loft to it and that it sparks and

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:10.599 
nice loft to it and that it sparks and
burns<00:01:08.719> very<00:01:09.020> very<00:01:09.289> well<00:01:09.530> so<00:01:10.189> what<00:01:10.459> we've<00:01:10.579> done

00:01:10.599 --> 00:01:10.609 
burns very very well so what we've done

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:12.459 
burns very very well so what we've done
is<00:01:10.789> we've<00:01:11.030> collected<00:01:11.450> some<00:01:11.569> fire<00:01:11.840> tinder<00:01:12.170> here

00:01:12.459 --> 00:01:12.469 
is we've collected some fire tinder here

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:14.620 
is we've collected some fire tinder here
so<00:01:12.679> again<00:01:12.950> we<00:01:13.100> have<00:01:13.249> a<00:01:13.280> cattail<00:01:14.030> and<00:01:14.389> these<00:01:14.509> are

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
so again we have a cattail and these are

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.539 
so again we have a cattail and these are
available<00:01:15.079> throughout<00:01:15.740> a<00:01:15.829> lot<00:01:16.069> of<00:01:16.159> places<00:01:16.310> in

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:16.549 
available throughout a lot of places in

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:17.859 
available throughout a lot of places in
the<00:01:16.639> world<00:01:16.759> anytime<00:01:17.060> you<00:01:17.329> have<00:01:17.479> around<00:01:17.719> the

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
the world anytime you have around the

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:20.169

edges<00:01:18.079> of<00:01:18.229> ponds<00:01:18.740> things<00:01:19.670> like<00:01:19.850> that<00:01:19.999> they're

00:01:20.169 --> 00:01:20.179 
edges of ponds things like that they're

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:21.910 
edges of ponds things like that they're
very<00:01:20.209> common<00:01:20.659> in<00:01:20.749> North<00:01:20.899> America<00:01:21.319> very<00:01:21.619> common

00:01:28.779 --> 00:01:28.789 
that we found on the forest floor that

00:01:46.029 --> 00:01:46.039 
in a position where this is maybe life

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:49.389 
in a position where this is maybe life
or<00:01:46.219> death<00:01:46.310> right<00:01:47.289> so<00:01:48.289> one<00:01:48.499> of<00:01:48.529> the<00:01:48.709> best<00:01:49.069> tools

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
spark and oh how you do it you hold it

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.930 
spark and oh how you do it you hold it
in<00:02:11.330> your<00:02:11.420> hand

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940

you just push down and run it off I'm

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.010 
you just push down and run it off I'm
not<00:02:13.920> just<00:02:14.130> creating<00:02:14.340> a<00:02:14.610> really<00:02:15.390> intense<00:02:15.720> heat

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.510 
not just creating a really intense heat
and<00:02:16.230> that's<00:02:16.530> right<00:02:16.710> cause<00:02:16.920> this<00:02:17.130> thing<00:02:17.250> it's

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
and that's right cause this thing it's

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.700 
and that's right cause this thing it's
about<00:02:17.840> 3,000<00:02:18.840> degree<00:02:19.080> heat<00:02:19.290> spark<00:02:19.590> that

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
about 3,000 degree heat spark that

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.410 
about 3,000 degree heat spark that

this cattail on now I'm going to see

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:53.000 
this cattail on now I'm going to see
we're<00:03:52.170> going<00:03:52.230> to<00:03:52.320> see<00:03:52.470> these<00:03:52.650> big<00:03:52.830> pieces

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
we're going to see these big pieces

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.830 
we're going to see these big pieces
we've<00:03:53.370> got<00:03:53.550> some<00:03:53.730> bark<00:03:54.000> here<00:03:54.269> and<00:03:54.570> actually

available<00:03:59.700> you're<00:04:00.090> going<00:04:00.209> to<00:04:00.269> Orin<00:04:00.480> acts<00:04:00.630> with

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
available you're going to Orin acts with

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.720 
available you're going to Orin acts with
the<00:04:01.050> ideal<00:04:01.470> is<00:04:01.680> you're<00:04:02.070> going<00:04:02.190> to<00:04:02.250> split<00:04:02.489> this

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
the ideal is you're going to split this

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:04.850 
the ideal is you're going to split this
right<00:04:03.030> and<00:04:03.269> since<00:04:03.510> we<00:04:03.690> don't<00:04:03.720> we<00:04:04.470> can<00:04:04.650> take<00:04:04.830> a

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:04.860 
right and since we don't we can take a

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:06.650 
right and since we don't we can take a
knife<00:04:05.100> and<00:04:05.340> we<00:04:05.580> can<00:04:05.790> that<00:04:06.030> we<00:04:06.060> can<00:04:06.269> split<00:04:06.480> this

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
knife and we can that we can split this

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.410 
knife and we can that we can split this
into<00:04:06.870> little<00:04:07.140> strips<00:04:07.230> all<00:04:08.160> right<00:04:08.280> ok<00:04:08.790> now<00:04:09.000> you

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
into little strips all right ok now you

00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:41.949 
on now if this was an actual survival

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:43.589 
on now if this was an actual survival
situation<00:04:42.669> I<00:04:42.789> would<00:04:42.849> spend<00:04:43.090> probably<00:04:43.270> 10

00:04:43.589 --> 00:04:43.599 
situation I would spend probably 10

00:04:43.599 --> 00:04:44.909 
situation I would spend probably 10
minutes<00:04:43.870> doing<00:04:44.020> this<00:04:44.199> and<00:04:44.409> I<00:04:44.439> would<00:04:44.590> carve<00:04:44.770> the

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:44.919 
minutes doing this and I would carve the

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:46.830 
minutes doing this and I would carve the
whole<00:04:45.099> thing<00:04:45.340> up<00:04:45.490> okay<00:04:46.030> the<00:04:46.210> idea<00:04:46.509> with<00:04:46.659> that

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 
whole thing up okay the idea with that

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.749 
whole thing up okay the idea with that
is<00:04:46.990> you<00:04:47.080> want<00:04:47.259> as<00:04:47.349> many<00:04:47.620> savings<00:04:48.189> as<00:04:48.370> much<00:04:48.580> as

00:04:48.749 --> 00:04:48.759 
is you want as many savings as much as

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:51.719 
is you want as many savings as much as
you<00:04:48.879> can<00:04:49.060> a<00:04:49.330> little<00:04:49.960> reservoir<00:04:50.620> of<00:04:51.159> things

00:04:51.719 --> 00:04:51.729 
you can a little reservoir of things

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:53.249 
you can a little reservoir of things
that's<00:04:52.090> right<00:04:52.300> to<00:04:52.479> keep<00:04:52.659> cool<00:04:52.840> I<00:04:53.110> would

00:04:53.249 --> 00:04:53.259 
that's right to keep cool I would

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:54.659 
that's right to keep cool I would
probably<00:04:53.409> take<00:04:53.740> this<00:04:53.889> and<00:04:54.069> I<00:04:54.099> carve<00:04:54.370> all<00:04:54.520> of

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:54.669 
probably take this and I carve all of

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:58.800 
probably take this and I carve all of
India<00:04:54.939> shavings<00:04:57.090> this<00:04:58.090> might<00:04:58.300> not<00:04:58.389> start<00:04:58.689> the
