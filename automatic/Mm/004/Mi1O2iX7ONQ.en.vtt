00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:29.929 
i don't know but it's just stupid i mean

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:32.840 
i don't know but it's just stupid i mean
if<00:00:30.929> you<00:00:31.080> have<00:00:31.230> a<00:00:31.260> villain<00:00:32.009> that's<00:00:32.399> as<00:00:32.579> badass

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
if you have a villain that's as badass

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.479 
if you have a villain that's as badass
as<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.420> Dark<00:00:33.660> Master<00:00:33.899> or<00:00:34.500> just<00:00:34.920> as<00:00:35.040> evil<00:00:35.250> as

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
as the Dark Master or just as evil as

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.069

that so just ditch the toss series okay
a<00:00:41.340> good<00:00:41.760> idea<00:00:42.030> for<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.300> toss<00:00:42.480> series<00:00:42.809> Legend

a good idea for the toss series Legend
of<00:00:43.530> Spyro<00:00:43.620> series<00:00:44.160> might<00:00:44.730> be<00:00:44.940> that<00:00:45.149> they<00:00:45.270> have

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
of Spyro series might be that they have

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.869 
of Spyro series might be that they have
a<00:00:45.420> prequel<00:00:45.930> starring<00:00:46.649> ignitus<00:00:47.160> or<00:00:47.370> maybe<00:00:47.579> like

Star<00:01:00.480> Wars<00:01:00.510> actually<00:01:01.320> that<00:01:01.829> would<00:01:01.920> be<00:01:02.039> a

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
Star Wars actually that would be a

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.910 
Star Wars actually that would be a
complete<00:01:02.760> ripoff<00:01:03.149> of<00:01:03.210> Star<00:01:03.600> Wars<00:01:03.629> so<00:01:04.110> you<00:01:04.769> know

if<00:01:05.129> they<00:01:05.250> do<00:01:05.309> that<00:01:05.670> I<00:01:05.850> think<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.630> fans<00:01:06.840> will

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
if they do that I think the fans will

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.520 
if they do that I think the fans will
notice<00:01:07.350> that<00:01:07.490> anyway<00:01:08.490> um<00:01:09.320> back<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.439> the

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
notice that anyway um back to the

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.410 
notice that anyway um back to the
subject<00:01:10.710> of<00:01:10.950> ditching<00:01:11.250> toss<00:01:11.460> I<00:01:11.729> think<00:01:12.330> they

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
subject of ditching toss I think they

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.109 
subject of ditching toss I think they
should<00:01:12.570> run<00:01:13.080> right<00:01:13.470> now<00:01:13.500> just<00:01:14.280> go<00:01:14.460> back<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:14.880> the

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
should run right now just go back to the

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.320 
should run right now just go back to the

shredders after enter the dragonfly and

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.560 
shredders after enter the dragonfly and
hero's<00:01:25.710> tale<00:01:25.950> as<00:01:26.189> well<00:01:26.759> as<00:01:26.850> those<00:01:27.030> crappy

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
hero's tale as well as those crappy

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.530 
hero's tale as well as those crappy
handheld<00:01:28.020> games<00:01:28.259> but<00:01:29.130> it<00:01:29.729> doesn't<00:01:30.390> mean<00:01:30.479> that

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
handheld games but it doesn't mean that

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.230 
handheld games but it doesn't mean that
it<00:01:30.780> can't<00:01:30.990> be<00:01:31.140> revived<00:01:31.500> it<00:01:31.890> was<00:01:32.070> an<00:01:32.250> absolutely

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
it can't be revived it was an absolutely

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.050 
it can't be revived it was an absolutely
awesome<00:01:33.750> series<00:01:34.470> I<00:01:34.650> think<00:01:35.220> they<00:01:35.369> should<00:01:35.579> get

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
awesome series I think they should get

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.819 
awesome series I think they should get
it<00:01:36.240> make<00:01:36.780> it<00:01:36.960> darker<00:01:37.530> not<00:01:38.250> not<00:01:39.000> too<00:01:39.659> dark<00:01:40.140> but

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
it make it darker not not too dark but

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.670 
it make it darker not not too dark but
make<00:01:41.610> it<00:01:41.640> darker<00:01:42.479> as<00:01:42.659> in<00:01:42.899> a<00:01:43.020> more<00:01:43.259> complex

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
make it darker as in a more complex

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.870 
make it darker as in a more complex
story<00:01:44.100> and<00:01:45.770> put<00:01:46.770> it<00:01:46.890> back<00:01:47.009> onto<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.579> shelves

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:32.990 
have this try and stop dunk must of a

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.370 
have this try and stop dunk must of a
coming<00:02:33.200> and<00:02:33.970> gift<00:02:34.970> but<00:02:35.360> it's<00:02:35.570> really<00:02:35.750> just<00:02:35.900> the

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
coming and gift but it's really just the

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.660 
coming and gift but it's really just the
cloth<00:02:37.370> series<00:02:37.820> told<00:02:38.150> again<00:02:38.420> isn't<00:02:38.660> it<00:02:38.900> so<00:02:39.670> you

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
cloth series told again isn't it so you

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.270 
cloth series told again isn't it so you
don't<00:02:40.700> really<00:02:40.940> need<00:02:41.150> to<00:02:41.300> do<00:02:41.450> that<00:02:41.480> but<00:02:42.320> what

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
don't really need to do that but what

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.250 
don't really need to do that but what
I'm<00:02:43.400> saying<00:02:43.430> is<00:02:43.790> they<00:02:44.300> should<00:02:44.360> really<00:02:44.900> go<00:02:45.020> back

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
I'm saying is they should really go back

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.500 
I'm saying is they should really go back
to<00:02:45.410> the<00:02:45.530> original<00:02:46.160> spyros<00:02:46.610> I<00:02:46.760> really<00:02:47.180> like<00:02:47.390> to

very tedious for many many people and
one<00:03:56.239> of<00:03:56.300> the<00:03:56.390> things<00:03:56.420> that<00:03:56.630> turn<00:03:57.260> people<00:03:57.290> off

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
one of the things that turn people off

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:03.120 
one of the things that turn people off
of<00:03:57.950> the<00:03:58.220> spyro<00:03:58.550> games<00:03:58.880> so<00:03:59.630> i'd<00:04:00.230> say<00:04:01.330> ditch<00:04:02.330> the

gym<00:04:04.130> collecting<00:04:04.790> just<00:04:05.660> keep<00:04:05.870> it<00:04:06.019> a<00:04:06.080> little<00:04:06.110> bit

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:06.350 
gym collecting just keep it a little bit

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:09.550 
gym collecting just keep it a little bit
too<00:04:06.440> gem<00:04:06.650> like<00:04:06.890> Ratchet<00:04:07.430> and<00:04:07.550> Clank<00:04:07.610> um<00:04:08.560> the

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
too gem like Ratchet and Clank um the

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.100 
too gem like Ratchet and Clank um the
three<00:04:10.370> breaths<00:04:10.910> I<00:04:11.239> don't<00:04:11.540> know<00:04:11.660> whether<00:04:11.930> the

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:12.110 
three breaths I don't know whether the

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:13.280 
three breaths I don't know whether the
keypad<00:04:12.530> or<00:04:12.560> not

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
keypad or not

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.249 
keypad or not
because<00:04:13.739> a<00:04:14.069> game<00:04:14.640> would<00:04:14.819> seem<00:04:15.060> inferior<00:04:15.719> to

00:04:16.249 --> 00:04:16.259 
because a game would seem inferior to
