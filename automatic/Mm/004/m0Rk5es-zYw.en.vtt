00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:02.820
 phone 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:04.810
 and I'll tell you where some connectors 

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:07.240
 is located and which key plant for what 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.389
 notes as you can see great 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.330
 part takes on your own dispute as 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:13.759
 it always happens touch phones 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:16.519
 he could back so 

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:18.560
 mirror such surface 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.140
 who does not know about plus or minus but not 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:22.380
 less satisfied elegant as 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.039
 looks but nonetheless 7 from how are you 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:27.689
 can see and video reflect the surface 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.880
 the fifth part is the speaker itself 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.160
 dynamics we are both for 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.930
 wiretapping so for 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.359
 output polyphony 

00:00:35.359 --> 00:00:37.279
 here is a small indicator 

00:00:37.279 --> 00:00:39.800
 which erupt during he 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.970

 bai ii work or 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:50.850
 that's it 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.880
 at the bottom he is two sons 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.220

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.420
 right is responsible to act 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:06.880

 they are pretty good pressed well 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.000
 I consider it a plus when it is sensory 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.700
 the phone is present km though 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.250

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:50.290
 a little bit 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:54.170
 it holds down the keys 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:55.070
 throughout 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.500
 either the same or this one 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:58.480
