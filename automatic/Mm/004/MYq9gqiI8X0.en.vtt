00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
video but it added an extra 10 minutes

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.230 
video but it added an extra 10 minutes
to<00:00:19.680> the<00:00:19.800> video<00:00:20.070> and<00:00:20.279> it<00:00:20.340> was<00:00:20.400> already<00:00:20.730> an<00:00:21.000> hour

to the video and it was already an hour

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.410 
to the video and it was already an hour
long<00:00:21.539> so<00:00:22.109> I<00:00:22.439> cut<00:00:22.920> that<00:00:23.070> part<00:00:23.310> out<00:00:23.519> entirely<00:00:24.029> I

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
long so I cut that part out entirely I

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.540 
long so I cut that part out entirely I
had<00:00:25.019> originally<00:00:25.289> planned<00:00:25.830> on<00:00:26.039> doing<00:00:26.250> this

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
had originally planned on doing this

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.269 
had originally planned on doing this
just<00:00:27.210> for<00:00:27.359> when<00:00:27.960> when<00:00:28.289> I<00:00:28.320> got<00:00:28.619> the<00:00:28.800> ruination

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
just for when when I got the ruination

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.510 
just for when when I got the ruination
figure<00:00:30.060> which<00:00:30.630> is<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:31.019> combiner<00:00:31.679> form<00:00:32.099> of<00:00:32.340> the

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
figure which is the combiner form of the

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.280 
figure which is the combiner form of the
Wreckers<00:00:32.940> from<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.360> war<00:00:33.600> for<00:00:33.750> Cybertron<00:00:33.899> u

Wreckers from the war for Cybertron u
which<00:00:34.800> is<00:00:34.950> basically<00:00:35.309> just<00:00:35.399> kind<00:00:35.850> of<00:00:36.000> repaint

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
which is basically just kind of repaint

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.810 
which is basically just kind of repaint
and<00:00:37.110> reach<00:00:37.559> will<00:00:37.800> slightly<00:00:38.040> tools<00:00:38.550> of

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
and reach will slightly tools of

all you have to do to get him into leg

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.310 
all you have to do to get him into leg
mode<00:01:22.890> let's<00:01:23.640> see<00:01:23.909> if<00:01:24.030> I<00:01:24.180> can<00:01:24.740> do<00:01:25.740> this<00:01:27.320> pretty

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
mode let's see if I can do this pretty

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.910 
mode let's see if I can do this pretty
good<00:01:28.590> here<00:01:29.150> it's<00:01:30.150> going<00:01:30.659> to<00:01:30.750> reverse<00:01:31.110> such

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
good here it's going to reverse such

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.350 
good here it's going to reverse such
like<00:01:32.189> this<00:01:32.990> um<00:01:34.610> and<00:01:35.610> without<00:01:36.060> having

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
like this um and without having

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.230 
like this um and without having
instructions<00:01:37.290> it's<00:01:37.530> kind<00:01:37.860> of<00:01:37.950> hard<00:01:38.250> really<00:01:39.000> to

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
instructions it's kind of hard really to

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.109 
instructions it's kind of hard really to
tell<00:01:39.750> how<00:01:40.680> it's<00:01:40.920> going<00:01:41.189> to<00:01:41.280> be<00:01:41.400> I'm<00:01:41.670> looking<00:01:42.030> at

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
tell how it's going to be I'm looking at

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.600 
tell how it's going to be I'm looking at
a<00:01:42.150> picture<00:01:42.420> of<00:01:42.659> it<00:01:42.930> right<00:01:42.960> now<00:01:43.170> actually<00:01:43.740> ah<00:01:44.009> I

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
a picture of it right now actually ah I

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:45.950 
a picture of it right now actually ah I
think<00:01:44.790> this<00:01:45.090> is<00:01:45.240> how<00:01:45.360> it's<00:01:45.509> supposed<00:01:45.540> to<00:01:45.869> be

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
think this is how it's supposed to be

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.200 
think this is how it's supposed to be
some<00:01:46.380> something<00:01:46.649> along<00:01:47.040> these<00:01:47.250> lines<00:01:47.549> and<00:01:47.790> as

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
some something along these lines and as

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.740 
some something along these lines and as
you<00:01:48.689> can<00:01:48.810> see<00:01:49.079> it<00:01:49.409> basically<00:01:50.100> just<00:01:50.750> replaces

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
you can see it basically just replaces

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.969 
you can see it basically just replaces
what<00:01:52.290> whatever<00:01:52.619> limb<00:01:53.189> you<00:01:53.880> have<00:01:54.119> here<00:01:54.750> in<00:01:55.140> LA<00:01:55.950> I

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
what whatever limb you have here in LA I

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.800 
what whatever limb you have here in LA I
mean<00:01:56.280> it<00:01:56.399> can<00:01:56.520> be<00:01:56.549> a<00:01:56.850> write<00:01:57.060> you<00:01:57.180> like<00:01:57.360> or<00:01:57.600> left

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
mean it can be a write you like or left

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.899 
mean it can be a write you like or left
leg<00:01:58.020> so<00:01:58.290> I'm<00:01:58.710> gonna<00:01:58.920> set<00:01:59.130> this<00:01:59.280> right<00:01:59.340> up<00:01:59.700> here

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
leg so I'm gonna set this right up here

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.280 
leg so I'm gonna set this right up here
and<00:01:59.969> I'm<00:02:00.090> going<00:02:00.360> to<00:02:00.420> assemble<00:02:00.810> him<00:02:01.110> in<00:02:01.229> a

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
and I'm going to assemble him in a

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.200 
and I'm going to assemble him in a
different<00:02:01.500> configuration<00:02:01.770> for<00:02:02.549> you<00:02:02.670> and<00:02:02.880> then

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
different configuration for you and then

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.260 
different configuration for you and then
you<00:02:03.329> can<00:02:03.570> take<00:02:03.780> vortex<00:02:04.770> here<00:02:05.040> and<00:02:05.250> again<00:02:05.939> you

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
you can take vortex here and again you

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.330 
you can take vortex here and again you
can<00:02:06.479> make<00:02:06.570> this<00:02:06.780> guy<00:02:07.020> a<00:02:07.049> right<00:02:07.619> arm<00:02:07.860> or<00:02:08.069> left

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
can make this guy a right arm or left

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.309 
can make this guy a right arm or left
arm<00:02:08.550> all<00:02:08.789> you<00:02:08.879> have<00:02:09.030> to<00:02:09.149> do<00:02:09.300> is<00:02:09.569> separate<00:02:10.110> this

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
arm all you have to do is separate this

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.130 
arm all you have to do is separate this
flip<00:02:11.310> this<00:02:11.520> in<00:02:11.849> now<00:02:12.180> if<00:02:12.420> you<00:02:12.540> do

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
flip this in now if you do

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.950 
flip this in now if you do
where<00:02:13.590> he's<00:02:13.860> going<00:02:14.160> to<00:02:14.250> be<00:02:14.400> a<00:02:14.730> right<00:02:15.000> arm<00:02:15.270> this

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
where he's going to be a right arm this

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.510 
where he's going to be a right arm this
is<00:02:16.020> the<00:02:16.260> hand<00:02:16.530> he<00:02:16.620> doesn't<00:02:16.800> have<00:02:17.040> a<00:02:17.069> second

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
is the hand he doesn't have a second

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.510 
is the hand he doesn't have a second
hand<00:02:17.730> he<00:02:18.240> actually<00:02:18.600> has<00:02:18.810> just<00:02:19.290> a<00:02:19.440> cannon<00:02:20.100> here

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
hand he actually has just a cannon here

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.760 
hand he actually has just a cannon here
and<00:02:20.730> then<00:02:20.880> you<00:02:21.000> rotate<00:02:21.540> this<00:02:21.780> around<00:02:22.020> and<00:02:22.620> then

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
and then you rotate this around and then

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.930 
and then you rotate this around and then
you<00:02:23.760> put<00:02:24.030> this<00:02:24.209> here<00:02:24.900> oops<00:02:25.500> and<00:02:26.040> now<00:02:26.880> you

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
you put this here oops and now you

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.260 
you put this here oops and now you
basically<00:02:27.209> have<00:02:27.810> just<00:02:28.170> a<00:02:28.709> cannon<00:02:29.430> arm<00:02:29.670> on<00:02:30.000> here

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
basically have just a cannon arm on here

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.740 
basically have just a cannon arm on here
which<00:02:30.800> you<00:02:31.800> know<00:02:31.950> it's<00:02:32.310> it's<00:02:32.610> it's<00:02:32.880> it<00:02:33.390> is<00:02:33.570> what

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
which you know it's it's it's it is what

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.420 
which you know it's it's it's it is what
it<00:02:33.840> is<00:02:33.990> but<00:02:34.770> it's<00:02:34.890> it's<00:02:35.130> kind<00:02:35.370> of

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
it is but it's it's kind of

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:36.050 
it is but it's it's kind of
weird-looking

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
weird-looking

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.630 
weird-looking
but<00:02:36.630> this<00:02:37.020> also<00:02:37.260> really<00:02:37.709> is<00:02:37.830> can<00:02:38.040> how<00:02:38.310> he<00:02:38.370> is

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
but this also really is can how he is

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.729 
but this also really is can how he is
going<00:02:38.940> to<00:02:39.060> be<00:02:39.239> for<00:02:39.540> a<00:02:39.570> leg<00:02:39.900> all<00:02:40.200> you<00:02:40.410> have<00:02:40.530> to<00:02:40.620> do

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
going to be for a leg all you have to do

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:44.620 
going to be for a leg all you have to do
for<00:02:40.920> this<00:02:41.420> rotate<00:02:42.420> this<00:02:42.780> all<00:02:43.170> the<00:02:43.530> way<00:02:43.650> around

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
for this rotate this all the way around

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:49.310 
for this rotate this all the way around
and<00:02:45.739> it's<00:02:46.739> basically<00:02:47.190> going<00:02:47.580> to<00:02:47.670> be<00:02:47.880> this<00:02:48.810> for

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
and it's basically going to be this for

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.060 
and it's basically going to be this for
his<00:02:49.470> leg<00:02:49.830> and<00:02:50.250> here<00:02:50.489> is<00:02:51.019> basically<00:02:52.019> in<00:02:52.380> his<00:02:52.769> leg

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
his leg and here is basically in his leg

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:54.560 
his leg and here is basically in his leg
configuration<00:02:53.670> again<00:02:53.790> I'm<00:02:54.120> going<00:02:54.360> by

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
configuration again I'm going by

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.810 
configuration again I'm going by
pictures<00:02:54.989> and<00:02:55.170> I'm<00:02:55.230> seeing<00:02:55.470> a<00:02:55.680> line<00:02:55.950> but<00:02:56.580> this

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
pictures and I'm seeing a line but this

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.310 
pictures and I'm seeing a line but this
kind<00:02:57.060> of<00:02:57.150> gives<00:02:57.300> you<00:02:57.420> an<00:02:57.510> idea<00:02:57.570> of<00:02:58.080> what<00:02:58.260> he

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
kind of gives you an idea of what he

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.440 
kind of gives you an idea of what he
kind<00:02:58.530> of<00:02:58.590> would<00:02:58.739> look<00:02:58.920> like<00:02:59.160> as<00:02:59.340> an<00:02:59.850> actual<00:03:00.239> leg

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
kind of would look like as an actual leg

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.320 
kind of would look like as an actual leg
now<00:03:01.440> with<00:03:01.680> these<00:03:01.830> other<00:03:02.040> guys<00:03:02.250> again<00:03:03.000> you<00:03:03.150> can

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
now with these other guys again you can

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.850 
now with these other guys again you can
swap<00:03:03.600> these<00:03:03.750> out<00:03:03.930> obviously<00:03:04.620> and<00:03:04.830> make<00:03:05.040> them

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
swap these out obviously and make them

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.410 
swap these out obviously and make them
other<00:03:07.860> sides<00:03:08.310> of<00:03:08.550> the<00:03:08.640> legend<00:03:09.000> and<00:03:09.120> you<00:03:09.209> can

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
other sides of the legend and you can

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.080 
other sides of the legend and you can
put<00:03:09.660> Brawl<00:03:10.110> over<00:03:10.620> here<00:03:10.890> you<00:03:11.100> can<00:03:11.250> put<00:03:11.459> Swingle

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
put Brawl over here you can put Swingle

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.420 
put Brawl over here you can put Swingle
over<00:03:12.810> here<00:03:13.050> it<00:03:13.350> really<00:03:13.560> kind<00:03:13.739> of<00:03:13.800> depends<00:03:14.130> this

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
over here it really kind of depends this

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.729 
over here it really kind of depends this
guy<00:03:14.640> is<00:03:14.700> obviously<00:03:15.390> always<00:03:15.720> going<00:03:16.290> to<00:03:16.350> be<00:03:16.440> a

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
guy is obviously always going to be a

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:19.819 
guy is obviously always going to be a
torso<00:03:17.370> so<00:03:17.880> that's<00:03:18.630> all<00:03:18.989> that<00:03:19.049> you<00:03:19.620> get<00:03:19.769> with

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:19.829 
torso so that's all that you get with

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:22.940 
torso so that's all that you get with
him<00:03:20.130> now<00:03:20.610> with<00:03:21.060> Swingle<00:03:21.450> you<00:03:22.230> just<00:03:22.470> take<00:03:22.709> this

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
him now with Swingle you just take this

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.420 
him now with Swingle you just take this
kind<00:03:23.370> of<00:03:23.489> fold<00:03:23.850> this<00:03:23.970> down<00:03:24.030> and<00:03:24.660> then<00:03:25.590> he's<00:03:26.220> got

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
kind of fold this down and then he's got

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:31.330 
kind of fold this down and then he's got
his<00:03:26.670> little<00:03:26.850> hands<00:03:28.400> inside<00:03:29.400> here<00:03:30.209> and<00:03:30.390> I<00:03:31.140> mean

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
his little hands inside here and I mean

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.550 
his little hands inside here and I mean
basically<00:03:32.340> this<00:03:32.820> is<00:03:33.060> all<00:03:33.390> you<00:03:33.570> do<00:03:33.750> for<00:03:34.079> making

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
basically this is all you do for making

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.020 
basically this is all you do for making
him<00:03:34.799> a<00:03:34.980> hand<00:03:35.310> to<00:03:35.579> kind<00:03:35.820> of<00:03:35.880> untap<00:03:36.420> this<00:03:38.030> which

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
him a hand to kind of untap this which

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.759 
him a hand to kind of untap this which
is<00:03:39.299> going<00:03:39.540> to<00:03:39.720> give<00:03:40.019> him<00:03:40.320> a<00:03:40.560> swivel<00:03:42.470> not<00:03:43.470> much

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
is going to give him a swivel not much

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:47.660 
is going to give him a swivel not much
of<00:03:43.799> a<00:03:44.040> swell<00:03:44.340> and<00:03:44.760> I<00:03:45.060> don't<00:03:45.120> think<00:03:45.530> um<00:03:46.530> I<00:03:46.670> guess

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
of a swell and I don't think um I guess

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.789 
of a swell and I don't think um I guess
he<00:03:47.820> bends<00:03:48.150> here<00:03:48.570> maybe<00:03:48.840> maybe<00:03:49.470> you<00:03:49.650> just

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
he bends here maybe maybe you just

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:52.220 
he bends here maybe maybe you just
extend<00:03:50.400> out<00:03:50.579> like<00:03:50.760> that<00:03:51.030> let<00:03:51.750> me<00:03:51.840> take<00:03:51.989> a<00:03:52.019> look

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
extend out like that let me take a look

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.319 
extend out like that let me take a look
at<00:03:52.380> a<00:03:52.440> picture<00:03:52.620> real<00:03:52.920> quick<00:03:52.950> yeah<00:03:53.610> I<00:03:53.640> really

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:54.329 
at a picture real quick yeah I really

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:55.729 
at a picture real quick yeah I really
can't<00:03:54.540> figure<00:03:54.750> this<00:03:54.959> guy<00:03:55.019> out<00:03:55.170> he's<00:03:55.470> a<00:03:55.500> little

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
can't figure this guy out he's a little

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:57.319 
can't figure this guy out he's a little
bit<00:03:55.829> more<00:03:55.980> complicated<00:03:56.340> but<00:03:56.640> you<00:03:56.700> can<00:03:56.970> kind<00:03:57.180> of

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:57.329 
bit more complicated but you can kind of

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:00.020 
bit more complicated but you can kind of
see<00:03:57.540> this<00:03:58.230> is<00:03:58.440> his<00:03:58.650> a<00:03:58.680> right<00:03:59.160> hand<00:03:59.459> now<00:03:59.730> if<00:03:59.940> you

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
see this is his a right hand now if you

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.150 
see this is his a right hand now if you
wanted<00:04:00.329> to<00:04:00.390> put<00:04:00.630> him<00:04:00.720> on<00:04:00.810> the<00:04:00.870> left<00:04:01.200> side<00:04:01.440> he

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
wanted to put him on the left side he

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.490 
wanted to put him on the left side he
also<00:04:02.190> has<00:04:02.700> a<00:04:03.000> left<00:04:03.480> hand<00:04:03.780> that<00:04:04.019> you<00:04:04.140> can<00:04:04.320> also

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
also has a left hand that you can also

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.080 
also has a left hand that you can also
use<00:04:04.650> you<00:04:05.010> just<00:04:05.040> choose<00:04:05.610> which<00:04:05.790> one<00:04:05.970> you<00:04:06.060> want

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
and keep it tucked in so there's that

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.860 
and keep it tucked in so there's that
guy<00:04:09.090> now<00:04:09.750> with<00:04:10.280> Brawl<00:04:11.280> he's<00:04:12.150> kind<00:04:12.690> of<00:04:12.750> a

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
guy now with Brawl he's kind of a

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.430 
guy now with Brawl he's kind of a
complicated<00:04:13.350> mess<00:04:13.890> kind<00:04:14.459> of<00:04:14.959> loosen<00:04:15.959> this<00:04:16.169> up

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
complicated mess kind of loosen this up

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.819 
complicated mess kind of loosen this up
again<00:04:17.280> I'm<00:04:17.729> not<00:04:18.150> 100%<00:04:18.840> sure<00:04:18.900> how<00:04:19.229> any<00:04:19.530> of<00:04:19.709> this

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:19.829 
again I'm not 100% sure how any of this

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:22.940 
again I'm not 100% sure how any of this
actually<00:04:20.190> is<00:04:20.880> supposed<00:04:21.419> to<00:04:21.539> look<00:04:21.840> because<00:04:22.740> we

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
actually is supposed to look because we

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:23.590 
actually is supposed to look because we
don't<00:04:23.250> have

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:23.600 
don't have

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.900 
don't have
instructions<00:04:24.290> on<00:04:24.470> it<00:04:24.680> which<00:04:24.860> is<00:04:24.890> part<00:04:25.730> of<00:04:25.820> the

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:25.910 
instructions on it which is part of the

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:27.700 
instructions on it which is part of the
reason<00:04:26.030> why<00:04:26.300> I<00:04:26.330> also<00:04:26.840> part<00:04:27.230> of<00:04:27.260> the<00:04:27.350> reason<00:04:27.380> why

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710 
reason why I also part of the reason why

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:30.750 
reason why I also part of the reason why
I<00:04:27.740> decided<00:04:28.070> to<00:04:28.370> cut<00:04:28.640> out<00:04:28.790> that<00:04:28.820> previous<00:04:29.560> video

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:30.760 
I decided to cut out that previous video

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.030 
I decided to cut out that previous video
segment<00:04:31.760> so<00:04:32.200> something<00:04:33.200> like<00:04:33.230> this<00:04:33.590> and<00:04:33.950> then

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.040 
segment so something like this and then

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.360 
segment so something like this and then
you<00:04:34.130> can<00:04:34.310> see<00:04:34.580> these<00:04:35.360> are<00:04:35.720> hands<00:04:36.530> right<00:04:37.160> down

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
you can see these are hands right down

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:42.730 
you can see these are hands right down
here<00:04:38.140> that<00:04:39.140> will<00:04:39.500> rotate<00:04:39.980> around<00:04:41.290> come<00:04:42.290> on<00:04:42.470> get

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 
here that will rotate around come on get

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.140 
here that will rotate around come on get
get<00:04:43.550> out<00:04:43.580> of<00:04:43.790> there

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:44.150 
get out of there

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:54.240 
get out of there
hand<00:04:45.940> something<00:04:46.940> like<00:04:46.970> this<00:04:49.720> like<00:04:50.720> so<00:04:51.430> maybe

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:54.250 
hand something like this like so maybe

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:58.570 
hand something like this like so maybe
alright<00:04:55.360> and<00:04:56.360> again<00:04:56.990> like<00:04:57.530> I<00:04:57.680> said<00:04:57.740> of<00:04:58.160> a

00:04:58.570 --> 00:04:58.580 
alright and again like I said of a

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:00.580 
alright and again like I said of a
bumbling<00:04:59.150> mess<00:04:59.450> right<00:04:59.840> now<00:04:59.900> then<00:05:00.230> you<00:05:00.320> put

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:00.590 
bumbling mess right now then you put

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:05.500 
bumbling mess right now then you put
this<00:05:00.770> together<00:05:03.130> down<00:05:04.130> here<00:05:04.760> something<00:05:05.270> like

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:05.510 
this together down here something like

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:12.810 
this together down here something like
that<00:05:05.780> and<00:05:08.290> put<00:05:09.290> this<00:05:09.560> up<00:05:09.860> here<00:05:10.610> like<00:05:10.640> so<00:05:11.360> and

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:12.820 
that and put this up here like so and

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:16.630 
that and put this up here like so and
basically<00:05:13.820> I<00:05:13.940> think<00:05:14.030> rotate<00:05:14.660> this<00:05:14.900> around<00:05:15.640> and

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:16.640 
basically I think rotate this around and

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:18.540 
basically I think rotate this around and
keep<00:05:16.850> it<00:05:17.030> kind<00:05:17.240> of<00:05:17.300> up<00:05:17.450> like<00:05:17.660> this<00:05:17.840> and

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:18.550 
keep it kind of up like this and

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:21.990 
keep it kind of up like this and
essentially<00:05:19.550> here<00:05:19.940> you<00:05:20.090> have<00:05:20.360> his<00:05:20.690> other<00:05:20.930> arm

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.000 
essentially here you have his other arm

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.050 
essentially here you have his other arm
or<00:05:23.000> him<00:05:23.270> in<00:05:23.480> his<00:05:23.690> arm<00:05:23.990> mode<00:05:24.320> and<00:05:24.590> this<00:05:25.550> really

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:26.060 
or him in his arm mode and this really

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:31.330 
or him in his arm mode and this really
again<00:05:26.990> is<00:05:27.740> really<00:05:28.220> kind<00:05:28.490> of<00:05:29.710> oops<00:05:30.710> probably

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:31.340 
again is really kind of oops probably

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:32.410 
again is really kind of oops probably
wasn't<00:05:31.490> supposed<00:05:31.760> to<00:05:31.790> do<00:05:31.940> that

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:32.420 
wasn't supposed to do that

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:35.200 
wasn't supposed to do that
there<00:05:32.900> we<00:05:32.990> go<00:05:33.320> and<00:05:33.410> then<00:05:33.800> probably<00:05:34.790> wasn't

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:35.210 
there we go and then probably wasn't

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:36.490 
there we go and then probably wasn't
supposed<00:05:35.390> to<00:05:35.420> do<00:05:35.570> that<00:05:35.690> now<00:05:35.870> again<00:05:36.140> I<00:05:36.320> don't

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:36.500 
supposed to do that now again I don't

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:37.390 
supposed to do that now again I don't
know<00:05:36.560> what<00:05:36.680> this<00:05:36.830> is<00:05:36.980> the<00:05:37.100> proper

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:37.400 
know what this is the proper

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.070 
know what this is the proper
configuration<00:05:37.730> and<00:05:38.360> part<00:05:38.570> of<00:05:38.630> the<00:05:38.720> reason<00:05:38.960> why

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:39.080 
configuration and part of the reason why

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:40.480 
configuration and part of the reason why
I<00:05:39.110> didn't<00:05:39.500> want<00:05:39.530> to<00:05:39.680> show<00:05:39.830> this<00:05:40.010> because<00:05:40.190> I

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:40.490 
I didn't want to show this because I

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:43.180 
I didn't want to show this because I
don't<00:05:41.120> exactly<00:05:41.420> know<00:05:41.780> how<00:05:41.960> to<00:05:42.020> do<00:05:42.230> it<00:05:42.410> but<00:05:42.620> what

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:43.190 
don't exactly know how to do it but what

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:45.610 
don't exactly know how to do it but what
you<00:05:43.220> basically<00:05:43.550> have<00:05:44.000> is<00:05:44.240> this<00:05:44.420> arm<00:05:44.720> now<00:05:45.020> you

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:45.620 
you basically have is this arm now you

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:49.440 
you basically have is this arm now you
can<00:05:45.800> take<00:05:46.010> this<00:05:46.310> you<00:05:47.120> can<00:05:47.180> plug<00:05:47.600> this<00:05:47.660> in<00:05:48.440> to

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:49.450 
can take this you can plug this in to

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:55.960 
can take this you can plug this in to
this<00:05:50.830> slot<00:05:51.830> right<00:05:52.070> here<00:05:54.610> come<00:05:55.610> on

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:55.970 
this slot right here come on

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:58.720 
this slot right here come on
why<00:05:56.540> there<00:05:57.200> you<00:05:57.350> go<00:05:57.410> that's<00:05:57.710> a<00:05:57.920> really<00:05:58.280> tight

00:05:58.720 --> 00:05:58.730 
why there you go that's a really tight

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:02.050 
why there you go that's a really tight
joint<00:05:59.300> right<00:05:59.570> inside<00:05:59.990> there<00:06:00.430> then<00:06:01.430> let's<00:06:01.670> see

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:02.060 
joint right inside there then let's see

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:07.510 
joint right inside there then let's see
what<00:06:02.540> we<00:06:02.840> got<00:06:03.550> him<00:06:04.870> being<00:06:05.870> an<00:06:05.990> arm<00:06:06.520> something

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:07.520 
what we got him being an arm something

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:10.090 
what we got him being an arm something
like<00:06:07.670> this<00:06:07.970> gonna<00:06:08.840> bring<00:06:09.140> him<00:06:09.410> down<00:06:09.440> make<00:06:10.040> him

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:10.100 
like this gonna bring him down make him

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:18.510 
like this gonna bring him down make him
a<00:06:10.760> leg<00:06:12.010> bring<00:06:13.010> him<00:06:13.310> over<00:06:13.340> and<00:06:14.060> make<00:06:14.780> him<00:06:15.650> a<00:06:16.090> leg

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:18.520 
a leg bring him over and make him a leg

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:22.870 
a leg bring him over and make him a leg
just<00:06:19.520> like<00:06:19.730> so<00:06:20.060> and<00:06:20.590> basically<00:06:21.590> here<00:06:22.400> you<00:06:22.580> have

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:22.880 
just like so and basically here you have

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:25.900 
just like so and basically here you have
what<00:06:23.450> it's<00:06:24.050> really<00:06:24.440> kind<00:06:24.590> of<00:06:24.620> floppy<00:06:24.910> here's

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:25.910 
what it's really kind of floppy here's

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:30.910 
what it's really kind of floppy here's
basically<00:06:26.290> ruination<00:06:27.290> um<00:06:28.100> although<00:06:29.920> he

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:30.920 
basically ruination um although he

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:33.760 
basically ruination um although he
really<00:06:31.160> doesn't<00:06:31.460> seem<00:06:31.910> too<00:06:32.300> stable<00:06:33.140> in<00:06:33.350> this

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:33.770 
really doesn't seem too stable in this

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:36.340 
really doesn't seem too stable in this
so<00:06:34.490> again<00:06:35.060> I<00:06:35.169> very

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:36.350 
so again I very

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:40.240 
so again I very
me<00:06:36.620> will<00:06:37.130> have<00:06:37.430> the<00:06:37.580> wrong<00:06:38.500> way<00:06:39.500> to<00:06:39.560> transform

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:40.250 
me will have the wrong way to transform

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:45.300 
me will have the wrong way to transform
these<00:06:40.460> guys<00:06:40.760> and<00:06:41.350> if<00:06:42.350> that's<00:06:42.890> the<00:06:43.070> case<00:06:43.190> I<00:06:44.060> mean

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:45.310

there you go um but yeah he doesn't seem

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:56.110 
there you go um but yeah he doesn't seem
very<00:06:52.660> stable<00:06:53.660> it<00:06:54.590> in<00:06:54.890> this<00:06:55.160> mode<00:06:55.550> to<00:06:55.880> be

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:56.120 
very stable it in this mode to be

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:57.520 
very stable it in this mode to be
totally<00:06:56.570> honest<00:06:56.840> and<00:06:56.870> you<00:06:57.080> can<00:06:57.200> see<00:06:57.350> he's
