we were limited on memory and animations

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.140 
we were limited on memory and animations
and<00:01:39.689> things<00:01:39.720> like<00:01:39.930> that<00:01:40.079> we<00:01:40.200> just<00:01:40.229> couldn't

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.150

couldn't<00:01:43.680> do<00:01:43.740> it<00:01:43.860> well<00:01:44.009> then<00:01:44.159> we're<00:01:44.369> going<00:01:44.490> to

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
couldn't do it well then we're going to

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.609 
couldn't do it well then we're going to
do<00:01:44.640> it<00:01:44.729> at<00:01:44.790> all<00:01:44.880> so<00:01:45.060> we<00:01:45.149> just<00:01:45.299> didn't<00:01:45.869> do<00:01:45.960> it<00:01:46.110> but

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
do it at all so we just didn't do it but

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.679 
do it at all so we just didn't do it but
now<00:01:46.770> now<00:01:47.340> we<00:01:47.399> have<00:01:47.520> a<00:01:47.640> more<00:01:47.850> space<00:01:48.090> more<00:01:48.360> memory

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
now now we have a more space more memory

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.600 
now now we have a more space more memory
created<00:01:49.140> a<00:01:49.290> very<00:01:49.439> strong<00:01:49.710> character<00:01:49.979> so<00:01:50.430> when

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
created a very strong character so when

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.010 
created a very strong character so when
he<00:01:50.759> grapples<00:01:51.180> an<00:01:51.270> enemy<00:01:51.540> he<00:01:51.630> kind<00:01:51.840> of<00:01:51.869> just

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
he grapples an enemy he kind of just

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.440 
he grapples an enemy he kind of just
charges<00:01:52.649> right<00:01:52.799> in<00:01:52.979> and<00:01:53.220> plows<00:01:53.820> to<00:01:54.060> everybody

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
charges right in and plows to everybody

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.569 
charges right in and plows to everybody
so<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:54.960> graphical<00:01:55.290> system<00:01:55.439> is<00:01:55.979> exactly<00:01:56.430> like

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
so the graphical system is exactly like

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:56.840 
so the graphical system is exactly like
that

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
that

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.130 
that
you<00:01:57.000> can<00:01:57.090> watch<00:01:57.240> somebody<00:01:57.570> in<00:01:57.659> there<00:01:57.869> and<00:01:58.079> you

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
you can watch somebody in there and you

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.660 
you can watch somebody in there and you
grab<00:01:58.350> them<00:01:58.619> and<00:01:58.740> fly<00:01:59.009> yourself<00:01:59.399> right<00:01:59.549> into

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
grab them and fly yourself right into

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:00.280 
grab them and fly yourself right into
the<00:01:59.820> air<00:01:59.939> right

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
the air right

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.560 
the air right
to<00:02:00.440> them<00:02:00.590> as<00:02:00.830> a<00:02:00.860> crowd<00:02:01.160> of<00:02:01.310> enemies<00:02:01.460> you'll<00:02:02.240> ply

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
to them as a crowd of enemies you'll ply

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.960 
to them as a crowd of enemies you'll ply
sell<00:02:02.870> food<00:02:03.080> all<00:02:03.260> all<00:02:03.980> the<00:02:04.190> stuff<00:02:04.400> was<00:02:04.520> set<00:02:04.940> up

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
sell food all all the stuff was set up

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.219 
sell food all all the stuff was set up
on<00:02:05.150> on<00:02:05.470> Jason's<00:02:06.760> free<00:02:07.760> time<00:02:07.970> he<00:02:08.840> gets<00:02:09.020> a<00:02:09.080> little

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
on on Jason's free time he gets a little

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.260 
on on Jason's free time he gets a little
bit<00:02:09.410> of<00:02:09.440> free<00:02:09.649> time<00:02:09.800> he<00:02:10.009> like<00:02:10.429> sticks<00:02:10.700> for<00:02:10.940> a

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
bit of free time he like sticks for a

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.690 
bit of free time he like sticks for a
couple<00:02:11.780> ideas<00:02:11.870> here<00:02:12.260> and<00:02:12.380> there<00:02:12.560> and<00:02:12.740> you<00:02:13.580> know

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
couple ideas here and there and you know

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.460 
couple ideas here and there and you know
everybody<00:02:14.000> gets<00:02:14.150> inspired<00:02:14.960> different<00:02:15.350> ways

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
everybody gets inspired different ways

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:16.990 
everybody gets inspired different ways
so<00:02:15.650> like<00:02:15.830> some<00:02:16.130> of<00:02:16.190> the<00:02:16.280> animators<00:02:16.700> will<00:02:16.850> hang

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
so like some of the animators will hang

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.030 
so like some of the animators will hang
out<00:02:17.150> a<00:02:17.420> little<00:02:17.570> bit<00:02:17.750> after<00:02:17.960> hours<00:02:18.410> and<00:02:18.680> go<00:02:18.770> okay

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
out a little bit after hours and go okay

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.680 
out a little bit after hours and go okay
let's<00:02:19.280> try<00:02:19.400> this<00:02:19.490> move<00:02:19.730> out<00:02:19.940> and<00:02:20.270> we<00:02:20.360> find<00:02:20.570> it's

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
let's try this move out and we find it's

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.600 
let's try this move out and we find it's
good<00:02:20.810> to<00:02:20.900> do<00:02:21.020> that<00:02:21.170> too<00:02:21.350> because<00:02:21.530> if<00:02:21.830> you<00:02:21.980> we

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
good to do that too because if you we

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.090 
good to do that too because if you we
have<00:02:22.700> an<00:02:22.790> idea<00:02:23.060> and<00:02:23.330> everybody's<00:02:23.750> like<00:02:24.590> oh<00:02:24.800> man

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
have an idea and everybody's like oh man

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.530 
have an idea and everybody's like oh man
and<00:02:25.220> what<00:02:25.520> kind<00:02:25.670> of<00:02:25.700> code<00:02:25.910> is<00:02:26.060> I<00:02:26.150> can<00:02:26.270> require

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
and what kind of code is I can require

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.150 
and what kind of code is I can require
what<00:02:26.720> kind<00:02:26.840> of<00:02:26.870> animations<00:02:27.380> I<00:02:27.440> can<00:02:27.560> require<00:02:27.860> so

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
what kind of animations I can require so

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.590 
what kind of animations I can require so
everybody's<00:02:28.490> worried<00:02:29.000> about<00:02:29.150> the<00:02:29.270> time<00:02:29.480> it's

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
everybody's worried about the time it's

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
everybody's worried about the time it's
going<00:02:29.690> to<00:02:29.750> take<00:02:29.810> but<00:02:30.110> once<00:02:30.260> you<00:02:30.380> kind<00:02:30.560> of

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
going to take but once you kind of

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.540 
going to take but once you kind of
implement<00:02:31.070> it<00:02:31.160> and<00:02:31.480> they<00:02:32.480> see<00:02:32.540> it<00:02:32.810> and<00:02:33.680> you

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
implement it and they see it and you

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.610 
implement it and they see it and you
know<00:02:34.670> more<00:02:35.660> apt<00:02:35.840> to<00:02:35.959> get<00:02:36.290> everybody's

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
know more apt to get everybody's

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:37.840 
know more apt to get everybody's
attention<00:02:36.709> and<00:02:37.160> they<00:02:37.220> want<00:02:37.430> to<00:02:37.520> actually

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
attention and they want to actually

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.230 
attention and they want to actually
spend<00:02:38.090> the<00:02:38.180> time<00:02:38.360> to<00:02:38.570> perfect
