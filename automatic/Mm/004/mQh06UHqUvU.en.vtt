00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:32.189
 and he punished was not Chinese then 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.079
 there is exactly blackberry brand 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.270
 that is, those that are firing phones and 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.969
 do you hear they release another tablet but 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.360
 that's never in the hands did not come across here 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:45.649
 got caught now 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:48.149
 there was a carcass problem not included not 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:54.329
 charging that is, we replaced here 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:56.660
 controller with l95 19 thousand something 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:00.239
 such a long name 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:05.880
 turned on it started charging here with us 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:10.950
 there is between may mini usb and microb 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:13.380
 And here is such a little charge as on as on and 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.770
 bloke that is magnet here screwdriver 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.350
 here 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:20.909
 but such a profitable client did not seem 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:24.509
 you decide to sell such a charge to the client 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:28.560
 charger principle inside but 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:30.509
 absolutely normal 5 volts 2 1 well here 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.259
 hooked it up now show that 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.970
 turned on we connect to the outlet 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.640
 here you see enough good 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:42.350
 quality cable connect and 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.350
 we have such a result 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:52.540
 that is, it caught fire and there is no charge then 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:57.080
 there is like connected and there is nothing 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:58.120
 here by the way, not some kind of android tablet os 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:02.690
 own 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:05.960
 blackberry playbook os settings 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:09.440
 by the way to play books for pro and chabad 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:11.750
 version so here we rushed to our 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:15.530
 puzzles running from 1 this is chinese with 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.670
 life is not well, then they thought that 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:21.130
 problem cables 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:26.510
 replaced the cable anyway the problem 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:33.460
 That is, it remains from such a charger 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:33.460
 does not end stubbornly turn on 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:46.420
 that is, the display lights up so that 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:52.230
 There is no charge, but based charge 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:52.230
 that I personally charge my phone 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:03:00.840
 tied like this a little bit bred 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:10.230
 hands it is not clear how it happens 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:13.260
 but then analyzing tell samsung 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.820
 From Samsung is charging from asus 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.120
 charging by these chinese not 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:21.140
 are loaded we came to such from the solution 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:25.830
 it turned out two problems the first problem 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:29.760
 cable, I'll show you a little bit here 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:36.600
 thick simpler there with the extra 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:39.690
 contacts and that's from such she charges 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:41.820
 just equal was the charger then 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:50.720
 here we have already converted charger 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:52.310
 customer device ie charging 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:04:00.080
 happens 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:04:00.080
 what was the remake show 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:15.590
 let's go was that date 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:20.270
 minus is a plus it was necessary to close the war 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:22.850
 whether she was closed to earth 

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:26.840
 and it was necessary to close each other and 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:29.270
 tear off this finding then the battle identifies 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:34.400
 like a charger and it charges from 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:37.760
 him so we opened for you 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:44.950
 show that not everything is so simple and 7 and 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:47.840
 charger can see samsung said 1 

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:50.470
 asus regret there is quite difficult 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.470
 to show 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:05:07.090
 here samsung say one drown the wire then 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:12.490
 there is here here so from this side 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:17.260
 Yes, it is clear that between date + and dates of us 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:19.360
 here it is the resistors are she somehow 

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:25.210
 closed that is certain that is 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:28.660
 true to cut a is even like iPhones we 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:31.210
 looked here found a site on which 

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:34.360
 fully painted but what are 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:36.550
 it's for nokia philips samsung htc in 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:40.150
 in our case, there are even 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:43.150
 here are the options for connecting here 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:47.470
 just in iPhones at samsung 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:51.340
 the scheme was this one motorola so here 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:56.980
 A resistor is needed so that it will catch fire or 

00:05:51.340 --> 00:06:01.480
 here i am samsung galaxy resistor for 4. 

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:03.580
 it's like a galaxy tab like this 

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:08.680
 specifically only from this version 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:12.260
 he will charge it and then i not he 

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:16.010
 same way 

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:18.200
 same different charger 

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:21.350
 the device that is not so simple then 

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:24.080
 you can even have it yourself 

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:26.750
 buy a charger like a phone she will 

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:29.990
 charge the phone let's say it charges from 

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:32.480
 all these chargers it does not matter what 

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:34.790
 connection and it charges only here 

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:39.830
 But from this redone only with 

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:49.700
 By a certain male by the way I am 

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:51.470
 missed here and accordingly 

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:56.480
 charging him well, we 

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:57.770
 completely dirtied bred here 

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:58.550
 subscribe to our channel put 

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:02.390
 huskies 

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:05.810
 we'll be back again tablets hopefully still 

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:09.220
 will wear in our hard time so 

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:09.220
