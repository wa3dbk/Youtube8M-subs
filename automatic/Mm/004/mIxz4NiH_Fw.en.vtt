00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.260
 alveolar polycarbonate are very 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.300
 appreciated for their transparency and 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.039
 rigidity associated with profiles and 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.230
 self-supporting they allow you to 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.869
 design and realize roofs of 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.750
 verandahs you will need plaque 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.360
 profile alveolar polycarbonate is 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.940

 with in appropriate words and a mallet 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:42.540
 choose has been profiled according to the 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.579
 resistance search you can 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.009
 choose profiles is meant for a 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:50.340
 Existing framework carry up to one 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:52.350
 meter sixty or use profits 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.430
 the most rigid for roofs 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.770
 his frame 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.710
 the profiles can then be carrying 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:01.560
 up to 3 meters 50 or four meters 50 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.890
 according to model calculate a roof slope 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.479
 to calculate your roof slopes 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.970
 postpone the height of the bottom rail 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:12.030
 on the support wall then add the 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.370
 length separating them x percentage 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.430
 wish 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:19.489
 here in this case three meters x 20 % 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:22.159
 you have to add 60 cm to the height 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:24.409
 on the support wall the lower ridge 

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:27.990
 position the lower ridge on the 

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:30.060
 wall respecting a slope of 20% 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:33.480
 check the high level horizontality at 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:37.350
 breakthrough bubble is fixed by peg a 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:40.710
 hit engaged the little joint all the 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:42.480
 along the lower ridge if you 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:44.700
 must cross a profile and place them 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.420
 in a cutting box and used a 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.210
 metal saw 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:51.900
 do not forget to add 10 cm to your 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:54.420
 cutting measurement for the overflow prepare 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:57.330

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.960
 side 3 cm long locate the 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:07.620
 indelible felt cups then 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:09.570
 sliced ​​at the angle grinder set a 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:13.170
 plate stop at the bottom of each profile 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:15.120
 and leave a space of 2.5 cm between 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.930
 the end of the profile and the plate 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:20.520
 stop assembly with two vices 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:22.350
 insert the little ones that will be under 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:25.830
 the plates and letting them overtake 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:27.210
 of 2 5 cm as they can shrink in 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:31.230
 time under the effect of variations 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:33.720
 thermal fix the profiles and engage 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.970
 the profile and on the ridge set the 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.370
 wise forecourt at the ridge with two 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:41.850
 vices self drilling then at the cross 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:43.800
 bass of your achievement install a 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:46.260
 profile and at a distance corresponding to 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:49.620
 the width of your plate increased by 1 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:51.870
 cm fixed by two self-drilling vices in 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:58.230
 the profit the two ridge lines aligned 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:04:00.660
 also the bottom of the profile in addition to the 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:03.330
 5 mm each side for free 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:06.030
 dilation also provided a space for 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:07.980
 10 mm between the edge of the plates and the 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:11.440
 umbrella 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:13.540
 prepare the plates to cut the 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:16.989
 plates placed first tape 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:19.180
 then used a circular saw 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:22.730
 preferably with fine-toothed core 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:25.160
 set to slow speed 

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:27.950
 remove the protective film on the side 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:30.500
 upturned also the film uv side 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:32.690
 to glue a perforated adhesive tape 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:35.270
 anti dust at the top and bottom of the 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:37.430
 plate and then add a profile an eye 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:39.110
 shutter down the drop of water 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:41.060
 head down 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:42.860
 this combination will prevent dust 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.540
 to penetrate into the alveoli and 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:47.540
 will allow the evacuation of water from 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:50.330
 condensation install the plates 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:52.880
 installed puddles by orienting the 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:55.580
 treated anti-uv side outward 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:58.460
 center and each plate to save the 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:00.590
 5 mm of play on each side the treatment 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:04.670
 anti uv prevents yellowing of the 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:06.650
 plate in time the hoods prepare 

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:09.770
