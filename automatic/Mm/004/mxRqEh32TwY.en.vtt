 I'll do it again with something this time 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.759
 I announced at the lawn 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.369

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:29.229
 tennis magazine reader cup who is now 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:31.630

00:00:29.229 --> 00:00:33.580
 cup that said it's mix tournament 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.500
 Sounds like nothing but dollar 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:36.760
 but because it plays on the pitches 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.310
 at gerry weber 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.990
 the tournament takes place once a year 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:42.520
 instead of and i think this year it was 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:44.530
 the eighth edition I hope then lie 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.450

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.149
 Hope you get a little insight 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:09.310
 how enjoyable and how fun the tournament 

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:10.990
 is fun of course in the 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.469
 foreground for a lynx 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.899
 competition 

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:15.280
 but it's also about what the winner 

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:17.679

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.569

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.259

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:42.579

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:48.100
 This sense of fun so much my values 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:49.779
 ladies and gentlemen I am like 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.270
 it is easy to recognize with gerry 

00:01:49.779 --> 00:01:54.069
 Weber and it's about the tennis magazine 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.849
 readers cup 2012 

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:59.469
 It is good weather as you can see 

00:01:56.849 --> 00:02:01.090
 behind me already playing diana back there 

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:03.100
 is still somewhere the sebastian 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.619
 I am here we are playing too 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.689
 third as centercourt de team here 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:09.039
 we change a bit and so on 

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:10.660
 someone always has a hand free for one 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.099
 Camera shows you the tournament 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.870
 a bit and a little bit typical 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:15.640
 or match him to start 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.920
 the olympic games on the lawn 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.599
 held so that lawn tennis on 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.790
 has become gradually all 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:23.349
 So a few follow is what 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.120
 startschuss in the cold weather on 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:25.540
 the biggest grain if you have 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.819
 to have 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.840
 total are seven places to rest 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:36.849
 shows you later is still here 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:38.260
 you have to first the lady's individual 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:40.540
 play mode provides 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.549
 It is only the ladies single use 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.069
 then played the single use 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:47.650
 should be decided afterwards eg man 2 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:51.610
 0 would then lead in this case 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:53.440
 not played what starts at 22 if 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.269
 It then becomes 1 1 after the individual stands 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.280
 a complete set of matches played in 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:03:00.040
 In that case , he won the first set 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:07.930
 then the lake was bodhrán and also the 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:09.819
 something won then like ours 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.530
 plan was always changed to me 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:13.450
 who just had not played plays 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.220
 then the mixed diana of course through the 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.760
 we can not replace this one 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:21.480
 case was mixed with my turn and now 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.480
 we gave everything 

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:30.069
 In this case, it would be a smooth 3 0 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:33.030
 for us and then it went 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:33.030
 even to round two 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:38.770
 the new lawn for the new year for center 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:42.060
 court and bs right next door 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:42.060
 the tennis magazine 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:04.130
 something to which I would rather not 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:04.130
 the software too much 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:19.959
 according to the first round where sebo 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.530
 the first one I had played 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:22.150
 now turn 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:24.420
 Again, you can say diana 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:27.430
 has won her single before 

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:31.200
 I was then allowed to go against the markus and 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:31.200
 I think it was 62 or so 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:43.970
 After a 2 0-leadership, it went completely 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.560
 relaxes as you can see everyone 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:47.900
 have fun in the places sebastian 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:50.650
 came in again and also the 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:50.650
 we still have a point 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:56.880
 then it was then again 

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:59.010
 back to the hotel we have two games 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.420
 made as you see on the top right 

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:02.160
 a bit of thunderstorm came on 

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:04.020
 were glad that I was able to play 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:06.270
 then there was the acquaintance evening 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:08.430
 here on the way in the player's hotel or 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:09.960
 into play then the hotel's restaurant 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:13.910
 there was something to eat 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:13.910
 and here you continue with 2
