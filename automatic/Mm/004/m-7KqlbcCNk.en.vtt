00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:28.159 
fairly straightforward and really the

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:29.319 
fairly straightforward and really the
only<00:01:28.219> thing<00:01:28.490> that<00:01:28.670> you'll<00:01:28.909> need<00:01:29.060> to<00:01:29.179> worry

only thing that you'll need to worry

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:31.840 
only thing that you'll need to worry
about<00:01:29.389> is<00:01:29.810> positioning<00:01:30.619> you'll<00:01:31.429> really<00:01:31.729> want

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
about is positioning you'll really want

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.480 
about is positioning you'll really want
to<00:01:32.119> have<00:01:32.329> a<00:01:32.630> clear<00:01:33.200> path<00:01:33.499> set<00:01:33.920> out<00:01:34.039> that<00:01:34.369> you'll

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
to have a clear path set out that you'll

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.580 
to have a clear path set out that you'll
be<00:01:34.639> taking<00:01:35.060> the<00:01:35.090> boss<00:01:35.420> and<00:01:35.689> where<00:01:36.139> the<00:01:36.319> range

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
be taking the boss and where the range

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.529 
be taking the boss and where the range
DPS<00:01:36.889> and<00:01:37.130> healers<00:01:37.579> will<00:01:37.789> be<00:01:37.939> standing

00:01:38.529 --> 00:01:38.539 
DPS and healers will be standing

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:40.599

considering<00:01:39.409> that<00:01:39.560> the<00:01:39.740> green<00:01:39.979> circles<00:01:40.429> will

00:01:40.599 --> 00:01:40.609

not<00:01:40.789> disappear

00:01:41.559 --> 00:01:41.569 
not disappear

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:44.050 
not disappear
we<00:01:42.109> suggest<00:01:42.529> having<00:01:42.740> the<00:01:42.950> ranged<00:01:43.340> DPS<00:01:43.849> and

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
we suggest having the ranged DPS and

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.969 
we suggest having the ranged DPS and
healers<00:01:44.599> be<00:01:45.079> kind<00:01:45.349> of<00:01:45.469> clustered<00:01:45.829> together

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
healers be kind of clustered together

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:47.469 
healers be kind of clustered together
you<00:01:46.340> don't<00:01:46.490> have<00:01:46.579> to<00:01:46.700> stack<00:01:46.909> on<00:01:47.149> each<00:01:47.179> other

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
you don't have to stack on each other

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:48.940 
you don't have to stack on each other
but<00:01:47.719> if<00:01:47.840> you're<00:01:48.020> clustered<00:01:48.409> together<00:01:48.560> you

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
but if you're clustered together you

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.279 
but if you're clustered together you
accomplish<00:01:49.459> two<00:01:49.700> things<00:01:49.749> the<00:01:50.749> first<00:01:50.779> is<00:01:51.169> that

00:01:51.279 --> 00:01:51.289 
accomplish two things the first is that

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:53.199 
accomplish two things the first is that
the<00:01:51.439> green<00:01:51.649> circles<00:01:52.069> will<00:01:52.249> be<00:01:52.369> placed<00:01:52.639> fairly

00:01:53.199 --> 00:01:53.209 
the green circles will be placed fairly

00:01:53.209 --> 00:01:54.669 
the green circles will be placed fairly
close<00:01:53.419> to<00:01:53.599> each<00:01:53.719> other<00:01:53.899> so<00:01:54.079> that<00:01:54.259> way<00:01:54.529> you're

00:01:54.669 --> 00:01:54.679 
close to each other so that way you're

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:56.830 
close to each other so that way you're
not<00:01:54.709> wasting<00:01:54.829> any<00:01:55.579> of<00:01:55.669> the<00:01:55.880> land<00:01:56.119> space<00:01:56.479> within

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
not wasting any of the land space within

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.109 
not wasting any of the land space within
the<00:01:57.079> room<00:01:57.109> the<00:01:57.799> second<00:01:58.189> is<00:01:58.340> that<00:01:58.459> it<00:01:58.639> makes<00:01:58.909> for

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
the room the second is that it makes for

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:01.690 
the room the second is that it makes for
an<00:01:59.209> easier<00:01:59.599> time<00:01:59.810> AoE<00:02:00.289> down<00:02:00.709> and<00:02:01.039> killing<00:02:01.549> the
