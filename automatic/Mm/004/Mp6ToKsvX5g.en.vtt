00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:07.910
 well, good afternoon everyone 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.100
 I am in el agoncillo elderberry I come to give you 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.290
 the second part of the first round of 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:14.630
 nephrology we are going to study physiology and 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:17.090
 tubular pathology we will see first 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:18.830
 place if a dh diabetes insipid that are 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.230
 questions forced almost every year 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:23.600
 drops or a chair's h or one's 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:27.170
 diabetes insipidus and then we will continue by 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:29.120
 the different tubular segments 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.920
 let's start with question number 7 

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.239
 which was question of the month of last year 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.010
 if you want we start reading here 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:38.020
 in front we use the dynamics of 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.020
 hands up that helps me a lot 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.600
 okay hands up that you think what 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.160
 you have super clear most of the 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.560
 water and the solutes are reabsorbed in 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:56.260
 the proximal tubule between 60 and 80 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.820
 percent of the water and the solutes is 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.710
 very important that you remember that there 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.690
 solutes like the magnesium that they have 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.970
 specific conveyors in the handle of 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:06.280
 people and that will therefore be reabsorbed in 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:08.770
 greater measure in this area we will do 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.810
 a very basic scheme of the nephron in 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.910
 what will we divide in the cortical zone and 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.160
 in the core area and first we're going to 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:16.869
 differentiate the different segments and 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.729
 what functions take place in each one 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:20.710
 of them if the aquaporins are 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:22.869
 open the water is going to find that 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.130
 it's in a very diluted medium and it's going 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:26.080
 to put in contact with an interstice 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.060
 very hypertonic you understand that as soon as 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.130
 the channel is open the water will tend to 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.860
 go out with a lot of greed and this what 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:35.340
 regulates a hormone that is the dh that is 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.340
 synthesize 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:41.030
 it is almost stored in the neuro pituitary and 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.470
 is synthesized in the hypothalamus this is a 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.820
 very frequent endocrine error but 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.470
 I say it just in case when a patient 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.090
 has a tumor which is the typical tumor 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.979
 that synthesizes the antidiuretic hormone 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.390
 the lung small cell you have it 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.280
 to know what is the most frequent that you 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.960
 they can ask or some drugs that 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.000
 stimulate the synthesis of h of form 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.500
 direct what there is a list follow in 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.130
 harrison but we just want to know 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.319
 a few 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.200
 then we see them worth but between them 

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:05.640
 the aines the benzodiazepines things that 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.030
 we use very commonly in the 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.030
 hospital
