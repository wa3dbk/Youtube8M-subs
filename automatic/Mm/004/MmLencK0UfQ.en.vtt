00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:06.109
 welcome to pino dellasega and fabio 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:10.650
 moretti of the italian nordic school 

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:12.660
 welcome walking not us aguero and hodge 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.059
 the cemeteries of the two very beautiful things 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.760
 meanwhile this is now a rediscovery 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.390
 because it starts to go much more than 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.150
 once 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.029
 the walk with the short rackets 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:27.300
 snowshoes not that this is in the hands Tutino 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.699
 what is it but this is the sporadic cia that 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.679
 it was used by the mountaineers for the 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.930
 mountain activities that were done one 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.300
 once move from one hut to the other 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.149
 from a cabin or even even go 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.610
 to hunt fishing and it is with this you can 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.860
 walk on the snow walking on the 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.980
 comes without sinking true certain 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:51.329
 because they are quite wide allow 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:53.520
 the version alone on the species 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.520
 modern of these are just those that 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:01:00.180
 these feet for a child 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:04.019
 towards the very light sailor of 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.909
 plastic and easy to put on very often 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.950
 among the exhibits for me with the attacks 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.900
 soft which is very simple forehead it 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.729
 succeed of the zealand scale and also 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.790
 this is the modern version of this 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.860
 ancient with the above all also allows 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.210
 not to slip on the ice because it is 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.830
 provided with this too much genius 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:25.110
 can walk safety that i 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.200
 children on the ice now tense up 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.689
 for a small demonstration and I would do it 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.090
 see with your beautiful modern snowshoes 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.400
 as accusations that actually do not 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.650
 collapse obviously we send it snow 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.320
 in the studio but wait until I put it here 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.270
 we have a political say let 's say 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.729
 demonstration without snowshoes are 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.450
 practically with promised feet 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.740
 sinks 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:52.240
 sorry with the snowshoe you are warming up 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.340
 quietly sees quietly 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.049
 of course , sometimes this choice does not exist 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.950
 thanks to scola changes in feet of 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:59.320
 to come in 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.969
 here now the foot sinks and like 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.920
 jasper not to sink 

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:05.500
 here is who this type of is suitable for 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.909
 practice we say that we have seen the 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.000
 children who can do it 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:12.660
 snowshoeing and fit a 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.610
 all from children to the elderly 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.799
 the important thing is however to go sui 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.500
 snowy grounds with some security 

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:21.880
 because in the mountains it is still necessary 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.430
 enter the mountain with respect 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:27.190
 because safety comes first 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.620
 according to a path 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:32.860
 if one remains in preparation one becomes one 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.750
 easy to be careful also because 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:38.099
 unfortunately the mountain winter means 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:40.450
 also many accidents almost always well 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:41.380
 held and unwary was not 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.780
 prudent 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.060
 but this is the common walk with the 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:49.000
 snowshoes are and there is another practice 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:51.519
 sport that is Nordic walking of which 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.090
 you are from the Italian school 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:57.250
 fabio I know it's a practice he does 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.920
 very good at all the real physique 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:02.380
 sir what then consists in 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.239
 Nordic walking is different from 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.459
 what one usually knows as 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:08.980
 trekking in the mountains is a 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:11.590
 particular stick that comes 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:14.410
 matched our walk then to the 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.299
 our movement with a well technique 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:18.380
 we are talking about is not raiders in this 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:23.180
 case that simona sodini is 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:25.610
 yes, then he sets off a lot to walk 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.200
 with sticks and these sticks that are 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:28.970
 characterized by this strap which 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.430
 always allows you to keep the 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:34.850
 pastry chef in hand and allows us to do 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:36.170
 a very wide movement in space e 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:37.730
 so thanks to this movement not 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:39.830
 we can almost involve the 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.750
 all the muscle before doing steps 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:44.000
 they make your fans fail 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.500
 movement yes and you learn a lot 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.100
 easily 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:51.680
 it is a broad movement I made myself is the 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:54.470
 stick add features 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.570
 which lead to the service while walking 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:58.310
 new shoulders exact new shoulders 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:00.020
 all the upper muscle that 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:02.900
 normally in additional walking 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:05.300
 we do not use work even with level 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.350
 postural all but beating from a 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:09.020
 recovery of what is ours 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:10.730
 natural walking performed in a manner 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:13.100
 fault of a correct walk with the 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:17.930
 posture is known by whom and by what age 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:20.420
 success from children to the elderly too 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:22.730
 because then every person can practice 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:25.040
 there are those with their own goals 

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:28.280
 practice king lion of well-being and chi a 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:29.750
 level also that the writer of the sportsman 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.870
 and of training as we say is really 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:34.880
 the scope all in 360 degree activity 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:36.140
 please better dress as a team 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.600
 transform the shopping that you are into 

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:40.280
 sports and national competition compliments 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:42.410
 from the training of the instructors why 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.720
 the advice we give is always 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:46.340
 to do a course for first 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.930
 learn the technique obviously for 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.190
 get these benefits 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:51.290
 the instructor is a little in 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:51.810
 all Italy and then then mine 

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:53.520
 obviously 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:56.010
 a man from putting advertising can 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.090
 find ways to do it in a bodice fashion 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:59.190
 and if there is snow 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:03.480
 look at what there is for smoking that 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:04.590
 with to allow considering that the 40 

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:07.230
 percent of people maybe 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:09.000
 mountains in winter are not we are 

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:11.160
 invented the winter nordic walking with 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.280
 this already bobbins with this attack 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:17.160
 very easy and light steppin that 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:19.740
 allows the roll of Nordic walking 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:22.080
 so I would set myself on the snow 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:24.000
 at least this if Black has 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.530
 discovered that seeing one of a thing 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.330
 that we the inter nordic walking it 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:29.520
 we propose exclusively on tracks 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:31.500
 jokes to avoid that there are 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:33.780
 of dangers so it seems like one thing 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:36.139
 had perfect thank you so much a 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:39.139
 fabio maletti at the day price instead 

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:39.139
 from
