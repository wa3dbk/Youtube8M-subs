00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
and then you guys have seen this little

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.580 
and then you guys have seen this little
top<00:01:42.249> too<00:01:42.549> before<00:01:42.850> it's<00:01:43.179> from<00:01:43.329> forever<00:01:43.479> 21<00:01:43.630> um

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590
