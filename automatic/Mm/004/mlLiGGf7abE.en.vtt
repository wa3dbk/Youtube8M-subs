how often they feature impacts and it's

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.700 
how often they feature impacts and it's
obviously<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.689> more<00:01:39.840> they<00:01:40.049> feature<00:01:40.259> impact

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
obviously the more they feature impact

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.679 
obviously the more they feature impact
the<00:01:41.250> more<00:01:41.460> they<00:01:41.579> feature<00:01:41.820> in<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.090> market<00:01:42.509> so

the more they feature in the market so

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.600 
the more they feature in the market so
depending<00:01:43.350> on<00:01:43.439> a<00:01:43.470> someone's<00:01:44.100> card<00:01:44.369> way<00:01:44.490> if

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
depending on a someone's card way if

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:45.889 
depending on a someone's card way if

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
and usually the lower the rating the

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.850 
and usually the lower the rating the
higher<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.250> pack<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:51.210> card<00:01:51.479> way<00:01:51.630> but<00:01:52.170> yeah<00:01:52.680> it

00:05:45.589 --> 00:05:45.599 
started it just yet because when I play

00:05:45.599 --> 00:05:47.959 
started it just yet because when I play
him<00:05:45.659> in<00:05:45.810> a<00:05:45.870> 352<00:05:46.620> formation<00:05:47.159> I<00:05:47.279> don't<00:05:47.639> find<00:05:47.849> a

00:05:47.959 --> 00:05:47.969 
him in a 352 formation I don't find a

00:05:47.969 --> 00:05:49.939 
him in a 352 formation I don't find a
Zoe<00:05:48.150> gets<00:05:48.479> you<00:05:48.779> know<00:05:48.900> he<00:05:49.050> gets<00:05:49.080> the<00:05:49.500> ball<00:05:49.529> a<00:05:49.710> lot

00:05:49.939 --> 00:05:49.949 
Zoe gets you know he gets the ball a lot

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:51.680 
Zoe gets you know he gets the ball a lot
and<00:05:50.159> I<00:05:50.490> find<00:05:50.729> that<00:05:50.819> with<00:05:51.000> a<00:05:51.029> lot<00:05:51.240> of<00:05:51.270> the<00:05:51.449> left

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:51.690 
and I find that with a lot of the left

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:53.689 
and I find that with a lot of the left
mins<00:05:51.900> of<00:05:52.050> right<00:05:52.229> meds<00:05:52.409> in<00:05:52.529> the<00:05:52.560> 352<00:05:53.039> formation

00:05:53.689 --> 00:05:53.699 
mins of right meds in the 352 formation

00:05:53.699 --> 00:05:55.339 
mins of right meds in the 352 formation
so<00:05:54.150> I<00:05:54.180> might<00:05:54.330> have<00:05:54.479> to<00:05:54.509> maybe<00:05:54.779> move<00:05:55.050> him<00:05:55.199> to

00:05:55.339 --> 00:05:55.349 
so I might have to maybe move him to

00:05:55.349 --> 00:05:56.570 
so I might have to maybe move him to
like<00:05:55.469> a<00:05:55.500> left<00:05:55.800> wing<00:05:56.009> or<00:05:56.159> something<00:05:56.190> like<00:05:56.520> that
