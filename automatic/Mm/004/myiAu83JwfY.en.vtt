the site and talk you through it's just

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.100 
the site and talk you through it's just
important<00:00:54.670> to<00:00:54.700> note<00:00:54.940> that<00:00:54.970> the<00:00:55.330> architecture

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:56.110 
important to note that the architecture

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:57.990 
important to note that the architecture
and<00:00:56.290> building<00:00:56.680> designs<00:00:57.010> that<00:00:57.310> you<00:00:57.430> see<00:00:57.460> along

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:58.000 
and building designs that you see along

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.900 
and building designs that you see along
the<00:00:58.120> way<00:00:58.300> are<00:00:58.660> not<00:00:59.110> the<00:00:59.380> finished<00:00:59.650> products<00:01:00.100> by

buildings<00:01:03.130> and<00:01:03.370> designs<00:01:03.700> that<00:01:03.940> will<00:01:04.150> actually

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:04.510 
buildings and designs that will actually

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:06.870 
buildings and designs that will actually
be<00:01:04.660> there<00:01:04.900> in<00:01:05.050> 10<00:01:05.290> years<00:01:05.500> time<00:01:05.740> because<00:01:06.670> those

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:06.880 
be there in 10 years time because those

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.850 
be there in 10 years time because those
specifics<00:01:07.480> will<00:01:07.690> all<00:01:07.810> get<00:01:07.990> designed<00:01:08.440> and

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:08.860 
specifics will all get designed and

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.040 
specifics will all get designed and
finalized<00:01:09.430> as<00:01:09.760> the<00:01:09.880> areas<00:01:10.240> of<00:01:10.360> land<00:01:10.540> are<00:01:10.780> sold

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:11.050 
finalized as the areas of land are sold

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:13.530 
finalized as the areas of land are sold
and<00:01:11.350> developed<00:01:11.770> over<00:01:12.010> time<00:01:12.390> and<00:01:13.390> they'll

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:13.540 
and developed over time and they'll

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.120 
and developed over time and they'll
obviously<00:01:13.870> need<00:01:14.020> to<00:01:14.050> fit<00:01:14.290> into<00:01:14.470> the<00:01:14.710> overall

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130 
obviously need to fit into the overall

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:16.950 
obviously need to fit into the overall
character<00:01:15.550> of<00:01:15.640> the<00:01:15.790> site<00:01:16.000> and<00:01:16.270> be<00:01:16.570> consistent

character of the site and be consistent
with<00:01:17.260> the<00:01:17.410> master<00:01:17.800> plan<00:01:17.830> and<00:01:18.280> there'll<00:01:19.030> be<00:01:19.060> a

with the master plan and there'll be a

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:20.730 
with the master plan and there'll be a
good<00:01:19.420> deal<00:01:19.630> of<00:01:19.660> community<00:01:20.290> input<00:01:20.500> and

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
good deal of community input and

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.800 
good deal of community input and
ownership<00:01:21.130> along<00:01:21.760> the<00:01:21.940> way<00:01:22.120> through<00:01:22.630> that

process but in general we do know

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.960 
process but in general we do know
roughly<00:01:26.440> where<00:01:26.740> the<00:01:26.770> new<00:01:27.070> community<00:01:27.550> hub<00:01:27.790> is

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:27.970 
roughly where the new community hub is

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.030 
roughly where the new community hub is
going<00:01:28.030> to<00:01:28.300> be<00:01:28.420> for<00:01:28.630> example<00:01:28.660> and<00:01:29.200> where<00:01:29.890> the

the whole development and you can see at

the whole development and you can see at

this point that the promenade becomes
pedestrian<00:04:21.739> only<00:04:21.829> so<00:04:22.190> the<00:04:22.310> cars<00:04:22.520> stop

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
pedestrian only so the cars stop

pedestrian only so the cars stop
and<00:04:23.590> it<00:04:23.830> becomes<00:04:24.190> much<00:04:24.400> more<00:04:24.750> pedestrian

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
and it becomes much more pedestrian
