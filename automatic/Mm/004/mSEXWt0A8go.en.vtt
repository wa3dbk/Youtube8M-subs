or maybe like a carbon or like a g10
backspacer<00:02:12.180> he<00:02:13.080> actually<00:02:13.170> did<00:02:13.440> a

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
backspacer he actually did a

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.460 
backspacer he actually did a
full<00:02:14.220> titanium<00:02:14.580> back<00:02:14.940> spacer<00:02:15.210> which<00:02:16.110> it<00:02:16.290> looks

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
full titanium back spacer which it looks

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.110 
full titanium back spacer which it looks
like<00:02:16.590> it<00:02:16.950> makes<00:02:17.130> it's<00:02:17.340> nice<00:02:17.460> looks<00:02:17.760> like<00:02:17.910> it's

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
like it makes it's nice looks like it's

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.600 
like it makes it's nice looks like it's
a<00:02:18.330> almost<00:02:19.140> one<00:02:19.410> piece<00:02:19.710> solid<00:02:19.950> titanium<00:02:20.190> but

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
a almost one piece solid titanium but

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.670 
a almost one piece solid titanium but
it's<00:02:20.700> not<00:02:20.880> it's<00:02:21.090> it's<00:02:21.300> two<00:02:22.050> slides<00:02:22.380> one<00:02:22.590> on

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
it's not it's it's two slides one on

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.370 
it's not it's it's two slides one on
each<00:02:22.830> side<00:02:22.890> and<00:02:23.070> then<00:02:23.430> a<00:02:23.460> TI<00:02:23.940> back<00:02:24.900> specialist

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
each side and then a TI back specialist

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.560 
each side and then a TI back specialist
blended<00:02:25.800> in<00:02:25.950> pretty<00:02:26.280> much<00:02:26.400> perfectly<00:02:27.890> so

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:29.570 
blended in pretty much perfectly so

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:31.910

fingerprints on his fingerprints types

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.090 
fingerprints on his fingerprints types
in<00:02:50.700> about<00:02:50.910> perfect<00:02:51.180> condition<00:02:51.890> there<00:02:52.890> is<00:02:52.980> a

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
in about perfect condition there is a

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.420 
in about perfect condition there is a
scratch<00:02:53.370> on<00:02:53.580> it<00:02:54.590> feels<00:02:55.590> very<00:02:55.709> nice<00:02:56.190> in<00:02:56.370> the

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
hand if it was tip up I'd probably I

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.690 
hand if it was tip up I'd probably I
don't<00:03:03.810> know<00:03:03.900> if<00:03:03.989> I<00:03:04.080> keep<00:03:04.290> it<00:03:04.350> or<00:03:04.380> not<00:03:04.700> it's

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
don't know if I keep it or not it's

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:11.090 
don't know if I keep it or not it's
awesome<00:03:08.270> but<00:03:09.270> I'll<00:03:09.870> carry<00:03:10.170> on<00:03:10.350> numbs<00:03:10.590> in<00:03:10.830> I'll

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
awesome but I'll carry on numbs in I'll

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.250 
awesome but I'll carry on numbs in I'll
use<00:03:11.250> a<00:03:11.280> lot<00:03:11.610> so<00:03:12.540> it's<00:03:12.660> really<00:03:12.780> gives<00:03:13.020> you<00:03:13.110> put

I've never carried even sounds also when

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.090 
I've never carried even sounds also when
you<00:03:21.540> flip<00:03:21.720> it<00:03:21.810> open<00:03:21.930> and<00:03:22.290> you<00:03:22.350> can't<00:03:22.769> flip<00:03:23.010> it

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
you flip it open and you can't flip it

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.430 
you flip it open and you can't flip it
over<00:03:23.220> with<00:03:23.459> no<00:03:23.840> am<00:03:24.840> I<00:03:24.930> really<00:03:25.110> gonna<00:03:25.290> suck

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
over with no am I really gonna suck

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:26.990 
over with no am I really gonna suck
that's<00:03:25.620> not<00:03:25.739> you<00:03:26.130> can't<00:03:26.370> flip<00:03:26.580> it<00:03:26.670> open<00:03:26.760> with

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
that's not you can't flip it open with

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.420 
that's not you can't flip it open with
no<00:03:27.150> thumb<00:03:27.420> with<00:03:28.080> no<00:03:28.230> wrist<00:03:28.500> flick<00:03:28.739> as<00:03:29.280> long<00:03:29.400> as

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
no thumb with no wrist flick as long as

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:30.680 
no thumb with no wrist flick as long as
you<00:03:29.580> push<00:03:29.880> down<00:03:29.910> and<00:03:30.299> build<00:03:30.450> a<00:03:30.510> pool<00:03:30.630> of

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
you push down and build a pool of

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.870 
you push down and build a pool of
pressure<00:03:30.900> down<00:03:31.170> before<00:03:32.130> you<00:03:32.220> let<00:03:32.370> it<00:03:32.459> go<00:03:32.580> or

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
pressure down before you let it go or

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.090 
pressure down before you let it go or
just<00:03:33.120> use<00:03:33.299> the<00:03:33.420> thumb<00:03:33.600> stud<00:03:33.840> it<00:03:34.590> flips<00:03:34.920> like<00:03:35.040> a

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
just use the thumb stud it flips like a

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.160 
just use the thumb stud it flips like a
champ<00:03:35.400> fossa<00:03:35.850> and<00:03:36.060> it<00:03:36.299> definitely<00:03:36.600> looks<00:03:36.900> at<00:03:37.049> I

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
champ fossa and it definitely looks at I

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:40.460 
champ fossa and it definitely looks at I
it<00:03:37.380> still<00:03:37.620> needs<00:03:38.489> to<00:03:38.519> be<00:03:38.610> broken<00:03:38.850> in<00:03:39.440> but<00:03:40.440> a

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
it still needs to be broken in but a

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.420 
it still needs to be broken in but a
very<00:03:41.070> nice<00:03:41.370> not<00:03:41.610> very<00:03:42.150> nice<00:03:42.420> knife<00:03:42.739> now<00:03:43.739> I

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
very nice not very nice knife now I

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.039 
very nice not very nice knife now I
think<00:03:44.970> it<00:03:45.120> blades<00:03:45.330> right<00:03:45.570> at<00:03:45.750> three<00:03:45.930> and<00:03:45.989> a

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:46.049 
think it blades right at three and a

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:48.199 
think it blades right at three and a
half<00:03:46.080> inches<00:03:46.260> so<00:03:46.590> it<00:03:46.620> should<00:03:46.799> be<00:03:46.830> just<00:03:47.209> smaller

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
half inches so it should be just smaller

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:52.460 
half inches so it should be just smaller
than<00:03:48.420> a<00:03:48.480> large<00:03:48.780> sebenza<00:03:50.690> just<00:03:51.690> smaller<00:03:51.989> I<00:03:52.290> mean

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
than a large sebenza just smaller I mean

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:57.789 
than a large sebenza just smaller I mean
it's<00:03:52.590> they're<00:03:52.830> pretty<00:03:53.519> close<00:03:53.700> in<00:03:53.970> size

00:03:57.789 --> 00:03:57.799 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:00.350 

awesome<00:03:58.799> knife

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 
awesome knife

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.510 
awesome knife
yeah<00:04:01.110> I'm<00:04:01.350> already<00:04:01.560> kind<00:04:01.830> of<00:04:01.950> regret<00:04:02.250> and<00:04:02.280> so

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:02.520
