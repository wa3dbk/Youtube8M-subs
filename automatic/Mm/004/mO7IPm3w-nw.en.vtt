00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:25.880 
celebrate we have a device which is very

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.440 
celebrate we have a device which is very
similar<00:00:26.210> from<00:00:26.930> the<00:00:27.649> original<00:00:28.340> design<00:00:28.640> from

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:29.450 
similar from the original design from

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:34.690 
similar from the original design from
the<00:00:30.550> from<00:00:31.550> the<00:00:31.669> late<00:00:31.820> 1960s<00:00:33.489> many<00:00:34.489> of<00:00:34.610> the

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:34.700 
the from the late 1960s many of the

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.610 
the from the late 1960s many of the
components<00:00:34.970> are<00:00:35.329> very<00:00:35.540> much<00:00:35.720> the<00:00:35.899> same

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:36.620 
components are very much the same

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:38.560 
components are very much the same
we've<00:00:37.100> smartened<00:00:37.579> up<00:00:37.670> some<00:00:38.359> of<00:00:38.449> the

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:38.570 
we've smartened up some of the

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.020 
we've smartened up some of the
aesthetics<00:00:38.840> but<00:00:39.429> essentially<00:00:40.429> it<00:00:40.640> is<00:00:40.789> the

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.030 
aesthetics but essentially it is the

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:42.250 
aesthetics but essentially it is the
same<00:00:41.239> machine<00:00:41.629> that<00:00:41.660> was<00:00:41.960> designed

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:42.260 
same machine that was designed

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:47.349 
same machine that was designed
originally<00:00:42.589> for<00:00:43.100> the<00:00:43.129> BBC<00:00:44.469> 40<00:00:45.469> years<00:00:45.620> ago<00:00:46.359> it

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.199 
fluids for the record cleaning machine
we<00:02:34.380> have<00:02:34.500> a<00:02:34.530> fluid<00:02:35.400> that<00:02:35.520> we're<00:02:35.700> using<00:02:35.910> here

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
we have a fluid that we're using here

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.170 
we have a fluid that we're using here
today<00:02:36.330> in<00:02:36.630> the<00:02:36.750> machine<00:02:37.050> for<00:02:37.380> vinyl<00:02:38.160> discs

that's<00:02:39.600> the<00:02:39.780> discovery<00:02:40.280> 3345<00:02:41.310> we<00:02:42.060> do<00:02:42.630> a<00:02:42.660> lot<00:02:42.810> of

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
that's the discovery 3345 we do a lot of

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.840 
that's the discovery 3345 we do a lot of
work<00:02:43.080> with<00:02:43.260> archives<00:02:43.739> and<00:02:44.010> libraries<00:02:44.430> so<00:02:44.700> we

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
work with archives and libraries so we

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.680 
work with archives and libraries so we
have<00:02:44.970> a<00:02:45.110> separate<00:02:46.110> a<00:02:46.700> separate<00:02:47.700> of<00:02:48.060> cleaning

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
have a separate a separate of cleaning

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.370 
have a separate a separate of cleaning
fluid<00:02:48.780> for<00:02:49.230> 78<00:02:49.800> for<00:02:50.550> shellac<00:02:50.850> and<00:02:51.180> then<00:02:51.870> we

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
fluid for 78 for shellac and then we

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.229 
fluid for 78 for shellac and then we
have<00:02:52.590> our<00:02:52.739> pre-wash<00:02:53.190> concentrate<00:02:53.850> which<00:02:54.060> is

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
have our pre-wash concentrate which is

have our pre-wash concentrate which is
when<00:02:54.720> you've<00:02:54.900> got<00:02:54.930> a<00:02:55.320> very<00:02:55.709> small<00:02:56.209> small

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
when you've got a very small small

moisture building up and that's turned

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.340 
moisture building up and that's turned
to<00:03:10.799> mold<00:03:11.040> and<00:03:11.310> this<00:03:12.269> pre-wash<00:03:12.750> concentrate

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
to mold and this pre-wash concentrate

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:15.220 
to mold and this pre-wash concentrate
which<00:03:13.560> you<00:03:13.709> manually<00:03:14.250> put<00:03:14.459> on<00:03:14.580> the<00:03:14.730> record

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
which you manually put on the record

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.199 
which you manually put on the record
using<00:03:16.230> the<00:03:16.500> spout<00:03:16.739> they're<00:03:17.100> imagining<00:03:18.090> that

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
using the spout they're imagining that

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:19.789 
using the spout they're imagining that
there<00:03:18.390> was<00:03:18.510> a<00:03:18.540> sustain<00:03:18.959> on<00:03:19.200> this<00:03:19.440> particular

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:19.799 
there was a sustain on this particular

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:22.220 
there was a sustain on this particular
record<00:03:20.190> we<00:03:20.790> let<00:03:20.940> that<00:03:21.060> drip<00:03:21.299> onto<00:03:21.540> that<00:03:21.840> record

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
record we let that drip onto that record

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.820 
record we let that drip onto that record
there<00:03:22.610> work<00:03:23.610> it<00:03:23.820> in<00:03:23.940> with<00:03:24.120> a<00:03:24.180> brush<00:03:24.450> and<00:03:24.830> then

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 
there work it in with a brush and then

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:27.440 
there work it in with a brush and then
vacuum<00:03:26.160> it<00:03:26.489> through<00:03:26.610> in<00:03:26.730> the<00:03:26.790> normal<00:03:27.090> way<00:03:27.180> it's

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
vacuum it through in the normal way it's

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.180 
vacuum it through in the normal way it's
it's<00:03:27.750> much<00:03:27.959> the<00:03:27.989> same<00:03:28.200> as<00:03:28.739> a<00:03:28.799> stain<00:03:29.160> remover

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
it's much the same as a stain remover

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.550 
it's much the same as a stain remover
for<00:03:29.760> your<00:03:29.880> laundry<00:03:30.030> if<00:03:30.390> you<00:03:30.540> had<00:03:30.930> a<00:03:30.959> dirty<00:03:31.230> cup

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
or something and put the stain really

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.360 
or something and put the stain really
far<00:03:33.780> on<00:03:33.810> there<00:03:34.260> and<00:03:34.530> and<00:03:34.769> then<00:03:35.100> put<00:03:35.250> it<00:03:35.340> through

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
far on there and and then put it through

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.060 
far on there and and then put it through
in<00:03:35.670> the<00:03:35.730> wash<00:03:35.880> with<00:03:36.120> your<00:03:36.209> normal<00:03:36.360> stuff<00:03:36.720> so
