00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
really like a lot has a lot of the green

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.719 
really like a lot has a lot of the green
design<00:01:03.120> going<00:01:03.359> down<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.780> white<00:01:04.019> on<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.290> side

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:04.729

game<00:01:10.140> online<00:01:11.390> which<00:01:12.390> I<00:01:12.540> think<00:01:12.750> it's<00:01:12.869> kind<00:01:13.140> of

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
game online which I think it's kind of

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.320 
game online which I think it's kind of
ridiculous<00:01:13.560> they<00:01:14.369> eliminated<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:15.000> battle

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
ridiculous they eliminated the battle

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.630 
ridiculous they eliminated the battle
game<00:01:15.509> so<00:01:15.930> it<00:01:16.110> is<00:01:16.320> it<00:01:16.590> does<00:01:16.799> not<00:01:16.920> include<00:01:17.220> a<00:01:17.340> die

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
game so it is it does not include a die

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.690 
game so it is it does not include a die
or<00:01:18.000> a<00:01:18.030> stand<00:01:19.009> which<00:01:20.009> is<00:01:20.130> sort<00:01:20.369> of<00:01:20.400> a<00:01:20.490> shame

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
or a stand which is sort of a shame

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.800 
or a stand which is sort of a shame
stands<00:01:21.119> are<00:01:21.299> always<00:01:21.509> good<00:01:21.689> to<00:01:21.960> have<00:01:23.600> not<00:01:24.600> much

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
stands are always good to have not much

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.570 
stands are always good to have not much
