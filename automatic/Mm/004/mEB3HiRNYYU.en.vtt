00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
treatment and I did get a question

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.900 
treatment and I did get a question
asking<00:02:51.810> me<00:02:52.080> about<00:02:53.299> protein<00:02:54.299> that<00:02:55.080> is<00:02:55.290> my<00:02:55.500> hair

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
asking me about protein that is my hair

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.509 
asking me about protein that is my hair

those products or heat styling and it's

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:16.850 
those products or heat styling and it's
very<00:03:13.560> rare<00:03:13.860> that<00:03:13.890> I<00:03:14.310> do<00:03:14.370> that<00:03:15.290> sometimes<00:03:16.290> I

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
very rare that I do that sometimes I

that up with moisture everything is

that up with moisture everything is
about<00:03:56.400> the<00:03:56.730> balance<00:03:56.940> when<00:03:57.450> you<00:03:57.540> have<00:03:57.690> the

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
about the balance when you have the

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.620 
about the balance when you have the
protein<00:03:58.290> when<00:03:58.980> you<00:03:59.160> up<00:03:59.430> the<00:03:59.730> protein<00:04:00.239> you<00:04:00.450> need

protein when you up the protein you need
to<00:04:00.810> up<00:04:01.049> the<00:04:01.079> moisture<00:04:01.739> so<00:04:02.340> that<00:04:02.549> there's

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
to up the moisture so that there's

to up the moisture so that there's
always<00:04:03.239> maintaining<00:04:03.810> that<00:04:04.019> balance<00:04:04.079> um<00:04:05.299> I'd

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:06.299 
always maintaining that balance um I'd

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:08.690 
always maintaining that balance um I'd
like<00:04:06.540> to<00:04:06.720> do<00:04:06.900> a<00:04:06.930> lot<00:04:07.410> of<00:04:07.470> moisturizing<00:04:08.280> things
