00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.500
 The Most Amazing Thing I Came To Work For A Caritas For AIDS Victims 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:11.500
 was that this is the best leaflet in the world. 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.000
 This is a real flyer that was released by Terrence Higgins Trust 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
 He circulated at the university I was working on. Around 1999. 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.500
 And ... he was focused on the last group of gays who still didn't take protection seriously. AIDS simply took the risk of occupation. 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.000
 Of course, they fought this disease, but they just coughed for preventive measures, 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
 so, by being a leaflet aimed at this last group, it goes very hard, 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 the top is just a picture of bananas and the word "mrdat". I don't know why this is so ... 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:50.000
 And the content is actually a ten-point plan - medical advice on how not to infect HIV. 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.400
 And ... this is the headline of that leaflet ... You just know it's worth it when the headline is like this: 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.200
 Good. Ready? 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.000
 "You don't have to have anal sex every time" 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.000
 It's good to know what? 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.000
 Imagine an elderly couple in a doctor's waiting room. 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.400
 Just flipping through Reader's Digest and saying, "What is this?" 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.500
 "You don't have to have anal sex every time" 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.000
 "See, I fucking told you!" 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.100
 Ok, here's just ten tips - alternatives to this funny activity. 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.000
 Okay, I'll read you here ... 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.200
 ...number one... 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.500
 ..so yeah. This is right! Ok ... 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.700
 ... number one: "Why not try" - it always starts with "Why not try ..." 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.200
 just give it to you so easily, don't want to push you, but ... 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.500
 ...number one: 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.200
 "Why not just try and win each other out?" 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.300
 Imagine: "I have a new leaflet, Larry!" 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.000
 - "What's in it?" - "Let's check it out, 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.500
 we can do one of these right now! " 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.100
 ... never more in the back ... Number One: 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.400
 "Why not just try and win each other out?" - "All right then..." 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.900
 Number two: 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.200
 It starts with the same again. Why not try ... 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.200
 Number two: 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.000
 "Why not try to do it on his back?" 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.200
 That's natural itself! 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.800
 As if it was a cooking recipe: "Why not try to add onions?" 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.800
 How do they do it to the doctor? "Hello, Doctor. I'm gay and I have a relationship at the moment 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.400
 and I'm afraid of HIV infection. Is there anything I should do? " 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.400
 "Ahhh, just do it on your back ..." 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.800
 Number Three: 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.300
 Number three ... yeah, it looked like everyone I met. 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.500
 He laughed a lot at one and two, but when I got to number three, he did ... 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.200
 Number Three: 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.200
 "Why not try to make it into his hair?" 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.500
 Not in the hair ... 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.000
 ... on your back. 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.500
 On back! Come on! 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.500
 On back. Do it on your back ... 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.300
 Where the fuck are you going with? No! 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:07.500
 Not in the hair! No, no ... there! Push... 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.000
 ... I don't trust you, I take my shower cap. 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.300
 Not in the hair ... 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:23.000
 Number Four: Yeah! Okay, I've been through since 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:28.500
 he did not hear such a perfect use of the term "for example" as in this next sentence. 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
 Number Four: 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.400
 "Why not try ..." 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.800
 "try" - as if it was something complicated for people 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.600
 something like, "Please at least try ..." 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000
 It's not about neurosurgery, this next sentence, but they put it there. 

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.200
 "Why not..." 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.000
 "Why not try to make fruit, 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.400
 for example in watermelon. " 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.700
 How does it end up joining it, as if people were doing: 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:02.200
 "What fruit? Oh, pineapple! 

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.900
 Fuck no! Au! What fruit? 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:10.100
 You must be specific! We thought it was right in the ass, not in the fruit! " 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:12.200
 - "Melon!" - "Thank you ..." 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.200
 And so on ... Okay. 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:22.900
 I want to jump to ten. Ok? 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:24.900
 Because ... this ... 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:28.100
 ... could be the most amazing sentence ever written. 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:31.200
 And I count Shakespeare ... 

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.000
 ... Dickens ... 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.600
 ... Office 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:41.000
 Thank you. 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:45.500
 Are you ready for this? Number ten! Ok. 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:49.700
 Well, I think the guy who wrote it didn't know much about it. 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:52.900
 I think he just came to the boss and says: 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:56.200
 "Boss, I'm done, I made nine." And the boss says, "But we need ten." 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.300
 -"Seriously?" - "Yeah, we need ten." 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:03.800
 - "I have nine of them ..." - "Yeah, but we need ten, really." 

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.000
 - "I've already done the hair, the fruit, everything ... 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
 ... so I mean ... " 

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:16.300
 - "There must be ten of them. We need two rows of five. 

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:21.300
 Two rows of five, unequivocally. 

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:24.000
 I like it when it's symmetrical. 

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.500
 So just think of one more thing, you've got half an hour. Then we're going to print. " 

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.500
 So he came back and invented number ten. So a minute before the deadline, I suppose. 

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:36.300
 So yeah. Number Ten: 

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:40.100
 "Why..." 

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.600
 Still with "Why not try ..." 

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:46.800
 Ok. Number ten, absolutely right. Ready? 

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:53.100
 "Why not try both to splash out the window?" 

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:01.800
 And they don't even say there may be a ground floor window. 

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.300
 "Brother!" 

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:10.700
 "No, this is number 17, number 19 is a little over there. Please, keep ..." 

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:14.000
 That's why this is my favorite leaflet of all! Thank you. 

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:19.500
 Fun and educational! 

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
