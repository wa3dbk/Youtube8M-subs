00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.450 

so<00:00:00.900> this<00:00:01.050> is<00:00:01.170> a<00:00:01.199> short<00:00:01.439> Peter<00:00:01.829> to<00:00:01.949> demonstrate

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:02.460 
so this is a short Peter to demonstrate

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:04.789 
so this is a short Peter to demonstrate
the<00:00:02.610> pioneer<00:00:03.090> went<00:00:03.330> to<00:00:03.510> 5:00<00:00:03.870> to<00:00:04.319> show<00:00:04.500> that<00:00:04.650> it

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
the pioneer went to 5:00 to show that it

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.299 
the pioneer went to 5:00 to show that it
runs<00:00:05.930> shows<00:00:06.930> got<00:00:07.170> claps<00:00:07.440> gears<00:00:07.799> breaks<00:00:08.099> that

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
runs shows got claps gears breaks that

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:09.740 
runs shows got claps gears breaks that
kind<00:00:08.519> of<00:00:08.610> thing<00:00:08.820> so<00:00:09.030> first<00:00:09.269> maybe<00:00:09.510> there's<00:00:09.660> a

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
kind of thing so first maybe there's a

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:18.380 
kind of thing so first maybe there's a
climb<00:00:09.960> on<00:00:10.080> to<00:00:10.170> start<00:00:10.469> the<00:00:10.620> engine<00:00:17.240> notice<00:00:18.240> that

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
climb on to start the engine notice that

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:19.820 
climb on to start the engine notice that
the<00:00:18.539> starter<00:00:18.960> matter<00:00:19.170> didn't<00:00:19.500> seem<00:00:19.619> to<00:00:19.710> sort

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
the starter matter didn't seem to sort

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.439 
the starter matter didn't seem to sort
of<00:00:19.890> work<00:00:20.039> every<00:00:20.340> time<00:00:20.550> I<00:00:20.580> use<00:00:20.850> the<00:00:21.000> kick<00:00:21.180> start

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
of work every time I use the kick start

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:22.759 
of work every time I use the kick start
at<00:00:21.630> last<00:00:21.810> I'm<00:00:22.020> only<00:00:22.199> waiting<00:00:22.380> well<00:00:22.650> at<00:00:22.740> that

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
at last I'm only waiting well at that

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:29.510 
at last I'm only waiting well at that
time<00:00:23.269> so<00:00:24.830> I'm<00:00:25.830> for<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.099> junction<00:00:26.430> first

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:29.520 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.580 

just<00:00:30.480> a<00:00:30.570> plain<00:00:30.750> little<00:00:30.990> bit<00:00:31.080> every<00:00:31.290> break

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
just a plain little bit every break

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.080 
just a plain little bit every break
which<00:00:31.740> I'm<00:00:31.890> doing<00:00:32.130> now<00:00:32.340> a<00:00:32.610> little<00:00:33.180> bit<00:00:33.420> more<00:00:33.630> I

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:35.090 
which I'm doing now a little bit more I

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.310 
which I'm doing now a little bit more I
can<00:00:36.090> feel<00:00:36.360> from<00:00:36.510> that<00:00:36.660> that<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:36.900> rear<00:00:37.080> drum

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
can feel from that that the rear drum

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.910 
can feel from that that the rear drum
feels<00:00:37.620> nice<00:00:37.830> and<00:00:38.010> round<00:00:38.989> and<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.530> rear<00:00:40.710> break

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
feels nice and round and the rear break

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.930 
feels nice and round and the rear break
was<00:00:41.130> as<00:00:41.280> fat<00:00:41.489> as<00:00:41.670> it<00:00:41.820> should<00:00:42.000> do<00:00:43.670> now<00:00:44.670> it's<00:00:44.790> same

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
was as fat as it should do now it's same

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.250 
was as fat as it should do now it's same
for<00:00:44.970> the<00:00:45.180> front<00:00:45.330> a<00:00:45.720> little<00:00:45.809> bit<00:00:45.930> of<00:00:46.080> front

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
for the front a little bit of front

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.150 
for the front a little bit of front
break<00:00:46.559> a<00:00:46.830> little<00:00:47.040> bit<00:00:47.280> more<00:00:47.489> I<00:00:48.800> can<00:00:49.800> prove<00:00:49.980> that

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
break a little bit more I can prove that

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.710 
break a little bit more I can prove that
the<00:00:50.340> front<00:00:50.550> disc<00:00:50.730> was<00:00:51.000> nice<00:00:51.150> and<00:00:51.360> flat<00:00:52.970> and<00:00:53.970> the

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:54.720 
the front disc was nice and flat and the

00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:02.160 
the front disc was nice and flat and the
front<00:00:54.809> break<00:00:55.080> feels<00:00:55.320> as<00:00:55.470> perhaps<00:00:55.620> was<00:00:55.890> issued

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.170 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.670 

so<00:01:02.740> I<00:01:02.800> go<00:01:03.040> around<00:01:03.220> through<00:01:03.580> the<00:01:03.700> gears<00:01:04.680> this

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:05.680 
so I go around through the gears this

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.950 
so I go around through the gears this
thing<00:01:05.860> for<00:01:05.980> any<00:01:06.540> transmission<00:01:07.540> noises<00:01:07.870> or

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:07.960 
thing for any transmission noises or

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.740 
thing for any transmission noises or
anything<00:01:08.140> unusual<00:01:08.470> that

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.420 

I'm<00:01:13.750> going<00:01:14.020> top<00:01:14.260> gear<00:01:14.500> now<00:01:14.710> the<00:01:15.040> transmission

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:15.430 
I'm going top gear now the transmission

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.400 
I'm going top gear now the transmission
tells<00:01:15.820> us<00:01:16.030> and<00:01:16.240> quiet<00:01:16.450> there's<00:01:16.720> no<00:01:16.870> gear<00:01:17.140> noise

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:17.410 
tells us and quiet there's no gear noise

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:18.840 
tells us and quiet there's no gear noise
chain<00:01:17.800> nose<00:01:18.040> or<00:01:18.190> anything<00:01:18.280> else<00:01:18.610> like<00:01:18.790> that

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
chain nose or anything else like that

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.960 
chain nose or anything else like that
the<00:01:19.630> engine<00:01:19.960> itself<00:01:20.260> sounds<00:01:21.250> nice<00:01:21.460> and<00:01:21.700> quiet

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:21.970 
the engine itself sounds nice and quiet

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.810 
the engine itself sounds nice and quiet
mechanically<00:01:22.540> good<00:01:23.040> and<00:01:24.040> it<00:01:24.250> runs<00:01:24.460> smoothly

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:24.820 
mechanically good and it runs smoothly

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.240 
mechanically good and it runs smoothly
and<00:01:25.440> they're<00:01:26.440> going<00:01:26.650> to<00:01:26.740> pull<00:01:26.950> the<00:01:27.070> throttle

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250 
and they're going to pull the throttle

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.300 
and they're going to pull the throttle
back<00:01:27.580> in<00:01:27.910> fifth<00:01:28.690> gear<00:01:28.930> in<00:01:29.260> top<00:01:29.650> just<00:01:29.980> this<00:01:30.070> make

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 
back in fifth gear in top just this make

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:36.030 
back in fifth gear in top just this make
sure<00:01:30.430> there's<00:01:30.550> no<00:01:30.640> electrical<00:01:31.030> breakdown

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:36.040 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.110 

it<00:01:36.580> accelerates<00:01:38.010> not<00:01:39.010> as<00:01:39.220> well<00:01:39.670> as<00:01:39.820> you<00:01:40.000> would

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:40.120 
it accelerates not as well as you would

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.700 
it accelerates not as well as you would
think

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
think

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:48.990 
think
it<00:01:41.710> should<00:01:41.980> do<00:01:42.360> it's<00:01:43.360> getting<00:01:43.750> there

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.390 

show<00:01:50.000> the<00:01:50.150> horn<00:01:52.390> no<00:01:53.390> horn<00:01:53.690> on<00:01:53.870> it<00:01:54.400> anyway

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:55.400 
show the horn no horn on it anyway

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.150 
show the horn no horn on it anyway
that's<00:01:55.610> my<00:01:55.730> test<00:01:55.970> down
