hey<00:00:00.750> what's<00:00:00.989> up<00:00:01.170> you<00:00:01.439> guys<00:00:01.560> bring<00:00:01.890> another

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:02.220 
hey what's up you guys bring another

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:03.860 
hey what's up you guys bring another
tutorial<00:00:02.669> video<00:00:03.000> this<00:00:03.419> time<00:00:03.480> on<00:00:03.780> the

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:03.870 
tutorial video this time on the

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:05.480 
tutorial video this time on the
difference<00:00:04.200> between<00:00:04.259> a<00:00:04.589> cheese<00:00:04.980> shells<00:00:05.250> and

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
difference between a cheese shells and

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.120 
difference between a cheese shells and
AP<00:00:05.819> shells<00:00:06.120> and<00:00:06.420> the<00:00:07.080> disadvantages<00:00:07.950> and

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
AP shells and the disadvantages and

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.669 
AP shells and the disadvantages and
advantages<00:00:08.280> of<00:00:08.849> each<00:00:09.210> and<00:00:09.540> why<00:00:10.290> you<00:00:10.349> should

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
advantages of each and why you should

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.459 
advantages of each and why you should
use<00:00:10.889> each<00:00:11.519> of<00:00:11.700> them<00:00:11.880> and<00:00:12.090> so<00:00:12.929> I<00:00:12.960> thought<00:00:13.349> I'd

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
use each of them and so I thought I'd

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.400 
use each of them and so I thought I'd
use<00:00:13.650> the<00:00:13.799> kV<00:00:14.160> tank<00:00:14.519> for<00:00:14.820> this<00:00:15.030> video<00:00:15.750> because

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
use the kV tank for this video because

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.550 
use the kV tank for this video because
it's<00:00:16.859> got<00:00:17.070> a<00:00:17.100> huge<00:00:17.640> derp<00:00:18.029> gun<00:00:18.060> on<00:00:18.449> it<00:00:18.660> that<00:00:19.410> does

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
it's got a huge derp gun on it that does

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.320 
it's got a huge derp gun on it that does
lots<00:00:19.859> of<00:00:20.010> damage<00:00:20.340> we<00:00:20.520> could<00:00:20.640> see<00:00:20.820> the<00:00:20.970> tier<00:00:21.150> 5

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
lots of damage we could see the tier 5

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.590 
lots of damage we could see the tier 5
gun<00:00:22.050> it<00:00:22.320> can<00:00:22.380> do<00:00:22.769> up<00:00:22.949> to<00:00:22.980> about<00:00:23.640> 700<00:00:24.150> damage

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
gun it can do up to about 700 damage

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.170 
gun it can do up to about 700 damage
that's<00:00:25.199> what<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.500> average<00:00:25.650> is<00:00:26.130> now<00:00:26.880> and

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
that's what the average is now and

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.419 
that's what the average is now and
compared<00:00:27.869> to<00:00:28.140> its<00:00:28.289> higher<00:00:28.529> tier<00:00:28.859> gun<00:00:29.130> which

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
compared to its higher tier gun which

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.669 
compared to its higher tier gun which
does<00:00:29.640> less<00:00:29.880> damage<00:00:29.910> as<00:00:30.840> higher<00:00:31.080> tier<00:00:31.320> and<00:00:31.560> it

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
does less damage as higher tier and it

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.100 
does less damage as higher tier and it
has<00:00:31.800> higher<00:00:32.070> penetration<00:00:32.489> and<00:00:33.059> as<00:00:33.870> you<00:00:34.020> can

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
has higher penetration and as you can

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.319 
has higher penetration and as you can
see<00:00:34.170> it's<00:00:34.829> a<00:00:34.950> higher<00:00:35.130> caliber<00:00:35.460> than<00:00:35.880> their<00:00:36.030> gun

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
see it's a higher caliber than their gun

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.209 
see it's a higher caliber than their gun
which<00:00:36.540> means<00:00:36.750> it<00:00:36.930> has<00:00:37.410> a<00:00:37.440> potential<00:00:37.980> to<00:00:38.010> do

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
which means it has a potential to do

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.430 
which means it has a potential to do
more<00:00:38.430> damage<00:00:38.730> just<00:00:39.540> with<00:00:39.690> less<00:00:39.840> penetration

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
more damage just with less penetration

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.250 
more damage just with less penetration
and<00:00:40.770> you<00:00:40.860> can<00:00:41.010> see<00:00:41.219> from<00:00:41.700> our<00:00:42.050> penetration<00:00:43.050> to

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
and you can see from our penetration to

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.889 
and you can see from our penetration to
a<00:00:43.290> chi<00:00:43.680> here<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.430> H<00:00:44.640> II<00:00:44.850> does<00:00:45.030> more<00:00:45.239> damage<00:00:45.270> but

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
a chi here the H II does more damage but

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.209 
a chi here the H II does more damage but
has<00:00:46.020> less<00:00:46.289> penetration

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
has less penetration

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.330 
has less penetration
well<00:00:47.730> armor<00:00:48.450> penetration<00:00:48.930> does<00:00:49.530> more<00:00:49.950> less

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
well armor penetration does more less

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.400 
well armor penetration does more less
damage<00:00:50.760> but<00:00:50.969> has<00:00:51.120> a<00:00:51.180> higher<00:00:51.480> penetration<00:00:51.870> rate

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
damage but has a higher penetration rate

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.760 
damage but has a higher penetration rate
and<00:00:52.760> that<00:00:53.760> falls<00:00:54.030> into<00:00:54.239> character<00:00:54.870> where<00:00:55.079> ap

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
and that falls into character where ap

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.880 
and that falls into character where ap
is<00:00:56.120> purely<00:00:57.120> straight<00:00:57.899> on<00:00:58.050> damage<00:00:58.469> while<00:00:58.680> a<00:00:58.829> chi

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
is purely straight on damage while a chi

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.790 
is purely straight on damage while a chi
is<00:00:59.370> a<00:00:59.609> mix<00:00:59.969> of<00:01:00.180> damage<00:01:00.660> as<00:01:01.079> well<00:01:01.289> with<00:01:01.500> Splash

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
is a mix of damage as well with Splash

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:02.389 
is a mix of damage as well with Splash
Damage

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
Damage

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.060 
Damage
so<00:01:02.910> take<00:01:03.180> I'm<00:01:03.690> gonna<00:01:04.110> be<00:01:04.290> shooting<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.830> tight

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
so take I'm gonna be shooting the tight

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.910 
so take I'm gonna be shooting the tight
the<00:01:05.820> t28<00:01:06.390> in<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:07.049> front<00:01:07.260> in<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.409> back<00:01:07.500> at

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
the t28 in the front in the back at

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.539 
the t28 in the front in the back at
first<00:01:08.189> in<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.400> front<00:01:08.670> now<00:01:09.450> using<00:01:09.900> AP<00:01:10.590> I<00:01:10.890> don't

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
first in the front now using AP I don't

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.010 
first in the front now using AP I don't
really<00:01:11.729> have<00:01:11.909> a<00:01:11.939> chance<00:01:12.150> to<00:01:12.360> pennant<00:01:12.720> because

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
really have a chance to pennant because

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.060 
really have a chance to pennant because
the<00:01:13.170> top<00:01:13.380> ap<00:01:13.830> pen<00:01:14.100> for<00:01:14.369> this<00:01:14.490> gun<00:01:14.760> is<00:01:15.060> a<00:01:15.119> hundred

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
the top ap pen for this gun is a hundred

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.469 
the top ap pen for this gun is a hundred
millimeters<00:01:17.070> around<00:01:17.430> there<00:01:17.670> so<00:01:18.090> when<00:01:18.180> I<00:01:18.210> shoot

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
millimeters around there so when I shoot

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.830 
millimeters around there so when I shoot
it<00:01:18.600> it<00:01:18.750> just<00:01:18.900> bounces<00:01:19.320> off<00:01:20.119> although<00:01:21.119> when<00:01:21.810> I

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
it it just bounces off although when I

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.260 
it it just bounces off although when I
switched<00:01:22.170> it<00:01:22.439> a<00:01:22.650> cheat<00:01:23.220> although<00:01:23.909> it<00:01:24.090> has<00:01:24.240> a

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
switched it a cheat although it has a

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.710 
switched it a cheat although it has a
lower<00:01:24.600> pen<00:01:24.990> Hg<00:01:25.950> still<00:01:26.250> has<00:01:26.490> a<00:01:26.520> splash<00:01:27.060> factor

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
lower pen Hg still has a splash factor

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.690 
lower pen Hg still has a splash factor
so<00:01:28.200> there's<00:01:28.439> a<00:01:28.530> chance<00:01:28.860> that<00:01:28.979> I'm<00:01:29.189> still<00:01:29.490> gonna

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
so there's a chance that I'm still gonna

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.260 
so there's a chance that I'm still gonna
do<00:01:29.880> splash<00:01:30.329> damage<00:01:30.750> to<00:01:31.110> a<00:01:31.140> tank<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:31.740> so<00:01:32.460> this

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
do splash damage to a tank and so this

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.149 
do splash damage to a tank and so this
is<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.600> strategy<00:01:33.869> for<00:01:34.170> facing<00:01:34.710> higher<00:01:34.950> to

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
is the strategy for facing higher to

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.039 
is the strategy for facing higher to
your<00:01:35.280> tanks<00:01:35.700> if<00:01:35.820> your<00:01:35.970> lower<00:01:36.180> to<00:01:36.630> still<00:01:36.930> do

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
your tanks if your lower to still do

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.910 
your tanks if your lower to still do
damage<00:01:37.259> towards<00:01:37.979> them<00:01:39.500> because<00:01:40.500> even<00:01:40.799> though

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
damage towards them because even though

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.080 
damage towards them because even though
you're<00:01:41.100> not<00:01:41.220> going<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.490> be<00:01:41.610> penning<00:01:41.939> them

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
you're not going to be penning them

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.520 
you're not going to be penning them
you're<00:01:42.360> still<00:01:42.630> going<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:42.840> be<00:01:42.960> doing<00:01:43.110> Splash

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
you're still going to be doing Splash

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:44.899 
you're still going to be doing Splash
Damage<00:01:43.560> and<00:01:44.130> have<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.369> potential<00:01:44.729> of

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
Damage and have the potential of

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.600 
Damage and have the potential of
damaging<00:01:45.060> modules<00:01:45.960> with<00:01:46.140> it<00:01:46.350> you<00:01:47.340> can<00:01:47.490> see

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
damaging modules with it you can see

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.429 
damaging modules with it you can see
here<00:01:47.850> I<00:01:48.000> am<00:01:48.299> managed<00:01:48.659> to<00:01:48.780> do<00:01:48.899> splash<00:01:49.170> damage

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
here I am managed to do splash damage

and damage the tracks and if you can't
see<00:01:51.570> I'm<00:01:51.689> in<00:01:51.840> take<00:01:52.229> off<00:01:52.439> about<00:01:52.970> 20%<00:01:53.970> of<00:01:54.119> its

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
see I'm in take off about 20% of its

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.569 
see I'm in take off about 20% of its
health<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:54.869> a<00:01:55.079> couple<00:01:55.439> hundred<00:01:55.619> with<00:01:56.250> just

gun<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.729> more<00:01:59.880> splash<00:02:00.240> damage<00:02:00.540> you're<00:02:00.840> going

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
gun the more splash damage you're going

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.539 
gun the more splash damage you're going
to<00:02:01.079> do<00:02:01.200> now<00:02:01.710> as<00:02:01.860> you<00:02:01.979> can<00:02:02.070> see<00:02:02.159> in<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.340> back

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
to do now as you can see in the back

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.090 
to do now as you can see in the back
here<00:02:02.579> I'm<00:02:02.909> showing<00:02:03.060> you<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.899> back<00:02:04.140> for<00:02:04.860> the

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
here I'm showing you the back for the

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.119 
here I'm showing you the back for the
t28<00:02:06.000> is<00:02:06.119> 50<00:02:06.780> millimeters<00:02:07.229> so<00:02:07.439> both<00:02:07.680> can<00:02:07.710> pen

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
t28 is 50 millimeters so both can pen

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.690 
t28 is 50 millimeters so both can pen
and<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:09.000> AP<00:02:09.330> does<00:02:09.539> about<00:02:09.780> 600<00:02:10.500> and<00:02:10.739> after<00:02:11.580> the

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
and the AP does about 600 and after the

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.000 
and the AP does about 600 and after the
AP<00:02:12.120> the

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
AP the

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.460 
AP the
ehe<00:02:13.310> that's<00:02:13.760> coming<00:02:14.090> up<00:02:14.180> does<00:02:14.420> about<00:02:14.659> 800

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
ehe that's coming up does about 800

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.039 
ehe that's coming up does about 800
damage<00:02:15.769> in<00:02:15.950> total<00:02:16.340> but<00:02:17.269> the<00:02:17.330> difference<00:02:17.810> is

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:18.049 
damage in total but the difference is

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:20.710 
damage in total but the difference is
you<00:02:18.470> do<00:02:18.650> more<00:02:18.860> damage<00:02:19.069> and<00:02:19.489> HG<00:02:19.970> also<00:02:20.299> has<00:02:20.690> a

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
you do more damage and HG also has a

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.350 
you do more damage and HG also has a
higher<00:02:21.049> chance<00:02:21.080> of<00:02:21.620> damaging<00:02:22.159> modules<00:02:22.700> so<00:02:23.239> if

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
higher chance of damaging modules so if

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.940 
higher chance of damaging modules so if
you<00:02:23.510> can<00:02:23.690> work<00:02:23.930> your<00:02:24.110> tank<00:02:24.379> into<00:02:24.650> a<00:02:24.680> position

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
you can work your tank into a position

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.699 
you can work your tank into a position
where<00:02:25.400> you<00:02:25.580> can<00:02:25.610> guarantee<00:02:26.540> penetration<00:02:27.440> of<00:02:27.590> a

cheat<00:02:28.010> you're<00:02:28.400> gonna<00:02:28.549> have<00:02:28.760> a<00:02:28.790> higher<00:02:29.090> chance

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
cheat you're gonna have a higher chance

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.440 
cheat you're gonna have a higher chance
of<00:02:29.569> damaging<00:02:30.110> modules<00:02:30.769> and<00:02:31.069> causing<00:02:31.879> the<00:02:32.180> tank

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
of damaging modules and causing the tank
