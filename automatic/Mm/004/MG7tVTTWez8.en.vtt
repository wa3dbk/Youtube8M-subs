00:02:09.159 --> 00:02:12.159
 He can therefore take the chance 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:16.279

 with time to the last 

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:28.639

 unabashed at one of the barber platz 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:41.850
 and I became so wanting to think and do that through the world rude 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.079
 but I am opposed to the newspaper 

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:45.969

00:02:45.969 --> 00:02:48.969

00:03:07.419 --> 00:03:09.939
 source sometimes thought about it 

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:11.139
 then come 

00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:14.290
 even though the puddles can stand and that makes it easier to 

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:17.359
 play 

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:21.889
 I already say under the title why the third place we learn but I am not there 

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:23.029
 as much as possible 

00:03:23.029 --> 00:03:25.879
 more and more went on 

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:28.879
 but I am completely in the clouds to discuss the Africa Cup 

00:03:30.089 --> 00:03:33.829
 it is difficult to calculate this choice and we will see that these people experience it 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:37.229
 everyone who starts 

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:39.079
 everyone watching 

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:41.999
 people who don't understand 

00:03:41.999 --> 00:03:44.999
 so I put my message as country calm 

00:03:46.899 --> 00:03:51.249

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:06.979

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:08.849

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:12.189
 often not parking because they are not on the map I say such a packet of butter 

00:04:12.189 --> 00:04:15.189
 I am more friendly 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.430
 the aspects on which one of the VIPs everyone likes 

00:04:23.939 --> 00:04:25.860
 I can imagine that I am in the image 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.189
 I have I with the increasing tightness 

00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:33.049
 but i am and i have marketing event build in addition to that 

00:04:33.049 --> 00:04:36.049
 americans 

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:38.960
 to make a long story short 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.960
 I came out with two fines after all, the police reports 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.990
 capelle 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.969
 I can now also improvise to hijack the NBA 

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:52.969
 what does something go through as unemployed couples family business 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:55.639
 I was a while ago 

00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:58.639
 if I went to what you are doing 

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:03.009
 walk along endangered species 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.280
 and I had to be at my old church and the chance for the tight side to the point 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:09.529
 of giving birth 

00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:12.529
 we will be running it again 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.059

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:22.270
 courard 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:25.270
 and nothing known 

00:05:31.499 --> 00:05:34.499
 on that for the walk 

00:05:37.589 --> 00:05:40.589
 the man claimed dortmund walking over again to became 8 at the same time 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:46.949
 in it is a walk along endangered species 

00:05:46.949 --> 00:05:48.710
 satisfied 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:51.710
 this is something of nature 

00:05:53.099 --> 00:05:56.599
 how do you think that would not be immediately threatened if the new plans have 

00:06:00.119 --> 00:06:03.389
 I can close but I will have you on my book again later 

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:06.389
 I also see an idea there 

00:06:07.009 --> 00:06:08.100
 for example only 

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:11.410
 I have her already you come as Hans Labohm as always as shows I have 

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:14.719
 a fantastic idea that the screen of cap and then normal that is 

00:06:14.719 --> 00:06:17.719
 that turns out not to be that wild looking they are still a few 

00:06:18.619 --> 00:06:21.139
 you must try to make something of it yourself 

00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:24.139
 karimi 

00:06:29.059 --> 00:06:32.059

00:06:35.509 --> 00:06:37.800
 Wow 

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:40.800

00:06:44.439 --> 00:06:49.239
 DPA Sam research suggests that Mother's Goes is that the study already has Sabah 

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:55.300
 helena image of the saint to the buttons 

00:06:57.029 --> 00:06:59.130

00:07:11.479 --> 00:07:14.490
 ideal Christmas gift for the big city 

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:16.210
 the city was not like that 

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:18.639
 nowhere 

00:07:18.639 --> 00:07:21.639

00:07:23.899 --> 00:07:26.899
 first child with the main man who is the farmer 

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:30.460
 they took the pee 

00:07:33.319 --> 00:07:36.629
 but that with that you can of course on the warm side the risk that I have
