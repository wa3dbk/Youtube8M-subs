00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:07.510
 years 

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:09.639
 friends of charades many times we have 

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:12.040
 gone to talk about gel nails we know 

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:14.320
 that last longer than it is an enameled 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.490
 permanent that comes great for us 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.050
 then continue with our daily life 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:19.509
 but we're going to present you today 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.340
 It also has something special about everything 

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:23.500
 for those women who in some 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:26.020
 moment of your life have gone through a 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:28.149
 chemo treatment we know that the 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:30.430
 nails not only the hair but also the 

00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:32.230
 nails are very, very weakened 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:33.880
 and marisol is applying precisely 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:35.710
 that treatment to the aura or the marisol 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.809
 hello how about tell me a bit 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.750
 advantages of what you are doing 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:45.789
 Well look is a new treatment that 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:48.399
 It takes q10 takes keratin everything 

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:50.100
 you need the nail that is damaged so that 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:53.340
 be regenerated 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.899
 thanks to this treatment the nail of the 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.089
 good person in this case is laura that 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.010
 laura the truth that I had them had 

00:00:57.089 --> 00:01:01.440
 well not as I had them very well had 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.359
 very good nails we have been 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.229
 nothing but putting a little bit of 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:08.880
 coating so that but in case of 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.320
 that was weakened because it is 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.509
 what for the case we talked about 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.420
 equally the result is the same if 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:17.549
 if they have a spectacular result 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.740
 because I already tell you that everything that takes 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.720
 is the component that has the nail 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.800
 we want to ask you one thing because it is 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.330
 true that when we talk about nail 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.250
 gel as we know they are nails that 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.899
 they last us a lot of time 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.340
 maybe we think but they are already gel 

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:30.750
 then it does not sweat we can 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.240
 spoil is completely different 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.550
 your treatment yes yes yes everything 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.159
 It's totally acid free you do not have 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:40.200
 no problem does not break down and the 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.810
 you can remove perfectly once 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.549
 you get tired of wearing it without any kind of 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.560
 problem and as the 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:49.259
 nail that you do we are filling 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.840
 we have to fill it in hard as 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.380
 three to four weeks and we are doing 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.030
 its filling 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.820
 ask Laura here how she is doing 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:00.460
 being laura happy if you have put 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.200

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.240

 I love you now you did the 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:18.010
 simple manicure yes yes much 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:19.959
 when it lasted two days with all the 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.519
 what we do at home is not that 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:23.530
 that we do at home many already know that 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:24.910
 same to say no to me the manicure does not last 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.290
 but you have to admit that as long as you're not 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.459
 a professional and apply the 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:27.970
 treatments that you are applying in this 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:31.030
 case 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.590
 marisol is impossible because nothing marisol 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.810
 what encourages us is that we put ourselves 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.120
 these nails to your question that I encourage you 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:40.120
 They are battle unhas for all kinds of 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.910
 people and price before are very 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:46.900
 affordable without unanimously the price 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:48.670
 Well, between 45 or 50 euros is not 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.650
 bad is not bad if you know that you are going to 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.989

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.549
