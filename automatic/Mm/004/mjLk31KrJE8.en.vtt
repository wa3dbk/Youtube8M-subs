 freezing and shock 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.860
 heat in the popsicles that makes them 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.740
 the form for analysis and 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.170
 routing at that time is performed 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.810
 the quality inspection to test that

 our products the packer 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:30.030
 automation provides high accuracy 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.549
 application of the package in each 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.920
 unit is doing all the

 high precision insulation 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:50.729
 the product protecting from all contact 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.860
 process at the end of the 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.590
 pack each popsicle unit 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.659
 forwarded finishing track where 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.039
