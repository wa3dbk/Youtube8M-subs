thousand as many of you guys know this
is<00:00:12.030> this<00:00:12.690> nitro<00:00:13.410> engine<00:00:13.530> in<00:00:13.860> it<00:00:14.009> but<00:00:14.759> I

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
is this nitro engine in it but I

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.939 
is this nitro engine in it but I
modified<00:00:15.330> it<00:00:15.660> so<00:00:16.109> I'm<00:00:16.410> just<00:00:16.560> going<00:00:16.710> to<00:00:16.770> show

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
modified it so I'm just going to show

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:23.259 
modified it so I'm just going to show
you<00:00:17.010> what<00:00:17.340> I've<00:00:17.460> done<00:00:18.830> let's<00:00:19.830> take<00:00:19.980> a<00:00:20.039> peek

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:23.269 

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:30.169 

okay<00:00:24.269> I<00:00:27.859> some<00:00:28.859> of<00:00:28.890> you<00:00:29.070> might<00:00:29.250> frown<00:00:29.609> upon<00:00:29.670> this

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
okay I some of you might frown upon this

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.139 
okay I some of you might frown upon this
but<00:00:30.570> you<00:00:30.750> know<00:00:30.869> it's<00:00:31.080> just<00:00:31.260> a<00:00:31.940> work<00:00:32.940> in

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
but you know it's just a work in

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.139 
but you know it's just a work in
progress<00:00:33.420> to<00:00:33.930> be<00:00:34.050> honest<00:00:34.820> what<00:00:35.820> I've<00:00:35.940> done<00:00:35.969> is

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
progress to be honest what I've done is

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.479 
progress to be honest what I've done is
I've<00:00:36.600> put<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:39.379> motor<00:00:40.379> is<00:00:40.680> a<00:00:40.710> brushless<00:00:41.040> motor

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
I've put the motor is a brushless motor

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:47.389 
I've put the motor is a brushless motor
of<00:00:41.610> course<00:00:41.910> it's<00:00:42.239> called<00:00:42.960> a<00:00:43.050> b-36<00:00:44.329> 774<00:00:45.500> 15<00:00:46.500> XL

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
of course it's called a b-36 774 15 XL

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:53.479 
of course it's called a b-36 774 15 XL
it's<00:00:48.180> a<00:00:48.450> kv<00:00:49.370> 1100<00:00:50.370> so<00:00:51.230> with<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.949> batteries

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
it's a kv 1100 so with the batteries

00:00:53.489 --> 00:01:00.040 
it's a kv 1100 so with the batteries
there<00:00:54.329> are<00:00:54.480> six<00:00:54.809> cells<00:00:55.610> 5,000<00:00:57.469> milliamps<00:00:58.469> each

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.050 
there are six cells 5,000 milliamps each

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.110 
there are six cells 5,000 milliamps each
so<00:01:01.050> you<00:01:01.350> know<00:01:01.469> should<00:01:02.430> last<00:01:02.609> a<00:01:02.879> little<00:01:03.030> while

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
so you know should last a little while

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.789 
so you know should last a little while
and<00:01:04.970> the<00:01:05.970> s<00:01:06.180> core<00:01:06.630> speed<00:01:06.990> controller<00:01:07.439> is<00:01:07.770> a

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
and the s core speed controller is a

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:17.120 
and the s core speed controller is a
turnigy<00:01:09.500> 120<00:01:10.500> and<00:01:11.210> has<00:01:12.210> also<00:01:15.710> orders<00:01:16.710> on<00:01:17.100> this

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
turnigy 120 and has also orders on this

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.850 
turnigy 120 and has also orders on this
one<00:01:17.520> but<00:01:17.939> you<00:01:18.150> know<00:01:18.270> problem<00:01:19.259> oakley<00:01:19.500> you<00:01:19.680> so

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
one but you know problem oakley you so

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.260 
one but you know problem oakley you so
much<00:01:21.860> I've<00:01:22.860> used<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.280> standard<00:01:23.490> box<00:01:23.820> and<00:01:24.150> use

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
much I've used the standard box and use

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:30.490 
much I've used the standard box and use
the<00:01:24.479> same<00:01:26.630> servo<00:01:27.630> as<00:01:27.900> you<00:01:28.890> can<00:01:29.040> see<00:01:29.340> I'm<00:01:30.150> using

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
the same servo as you can see I'm using

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.770 
the same servo as you can see I'm using
2.4<00:01:31.500> g<00:01:31.799> hurts<00:01:32.040> now<00:01:32.220> so<00:01:33.119> it's<00:01:33.270> a<00:01:33.299> short<00:01:33.600> antenna

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
2.4 g hurts now so it's a short antenna

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.069 
2.4 g hurts now so it's a short antenna
it's<00:01:36.780> pretty<00:01:36.990> much<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.259> same<00:01:37.650> I<00:01:38.990> don't<00:01:39.990> know

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
it's pretty much the same I don't know

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.340 
it's pretty much the same I don't know
if<00:01:40.320> you<00:01:40.590> can<00:01:40.740> see<00:01:40.979> this<00:01:41.189> but<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:42.180> cooling<00:01:42.720> here

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
if you can see this but the cooling here

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.260 
if you can see this but the cooling here
I<00:01:43.500> don't<00:01:44.220> know<00:01:44.280> if<00:01:44.399> this<00:01:44.729> is<00:01:44.790> wide<00:01:45.299> enough<00:01:45.509> in

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
I don't know if this is wide enough in

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.850 
I don't know if this is wide enough in
this<00:01:48.270> calling<00:01:48.780> is<00:01:48.960> just<00:01:49.259> about<00:01:49.530> I<00:01:50.340> don't<00:01:51.060> know

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
this calling is just about I don't know

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.719 
this calling is just about I don't know
still<00:01:52.860> over<00:01:54.350> two<00:01:55.350> and<00:01:55.470> a<00:01:55.530> half<00:01:55.680> centimeters<00:01:56.070> or

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
still over two and a half centimeters or

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.340 
still over two and a half centimeters or
about<00:01:57.590> an<00:01:58.590> inch<00:01:58.770> more<00:01:59.399> than<00:01:59.460> an<00:01:59.759> inch<00:02:00.350> also

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
about an inch more than an inch also

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:08.660 
about an inch more than an inch also
what<00:02:01.469> I've<00:02:01.560> done<00:02:01.740> this<00:02:04.399> I've<00:02:07.220> as<00:02:08.220> you<00:02:08.340> can<00:02:08.489> see

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
what I've done this I've as you can see

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.520 
what I've done this I've as you can see
this<00:02:08.910> is<00:02:09.090> kind<00:02:09.330> of<00:02:09.360> noobish

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
this is kind of noobish

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.640 
this is kind of noobish
but<00:02:10.860> you<00:02:11.100> know<00:02:11.190> it<00:02:11.370> works<00:02:11.580> it's<00:02:12.200> it's<00:02:13.200> pretty

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
but you know it works it's it's pretty

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.990 
but you know it works it's it's pretty
rigid<00:02:13.830> so<00:02:14.390> it's<00:02:15.390> it's<00:02:15.930> supposed<00:02:16.290> to<00:02:17.000> you

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
rigid so it's it's supposed to you

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.260 
rigid so it's it's supposed to you
should<00:02:18.240> you<00:02:18.510> know<00:02:18.569> not<00:02:19.230> break<00:02:19.560> hopefully

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
should you know not break hopefully

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:25.220 
should you know not break hopefully
we'll<00:02:21.270> see<00:02:21.480> I<00:02:22.140> stopped<00:02:22.590> in<00:02:22.740> tested<00:02:23.130> yet<00:02:24.230> reason

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
we'll see I stopped in tested yet reason

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.650 
we'll see I stopped in tested yet reason
why<00:02:25.350> I<00:02:25.380> put<00:02:25.590> in<00:02:25.800> this<00:02:25.920> box<00:02:26.190> is<00:02:26.610> because<00:02:26.940> the<00:02:27.420> esk

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
why I put in this box is because the esk

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.280 
why I put in this box is because the esk
is<00:02:27.959> somewhat<00:02:28.830> expensive<00:02:29.640> so<00:02:30.390> you<00:02:30.989> know<00:02:31.140> if

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
is somewhat expensive so you know if

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.000 
is somewhat expensive so you know if
anything<00:02:31.680> you<00:02:32.160> know<00:02:32.220> if<00:02:32.780> if<00:02:33.780> the<00:02:33.840> boat<00:02:34.170> tips

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
anything you know if if the boat tips

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.930 
anything you know if if the boat tips
over<00:02:35.370> i<00:02:35.430> can<00:02:35.870> probably<00:02:36.870> save<00:02:37.560> risk<00:02:37.950> hopefully

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
over i can probably save risk hopefully

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.920 
over i can probably save risk hopefully
and<00:02:39.540> also<00:02:39.660> the<00:02:40.020> batteries<00:02:40.440> are<00:02:40.680> just<00:02:40.830> a<00:02:41.930> used

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
and also the batteries are just a used

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.340 
and also the batteries are just a used
well<00:02:43.170> crow<00:02:43.470> just<00:02:43.920> to<00:02:44.040> fasten<00:02:44.459> them<00:02:44.580> and<00:02:44.790> in<00:02:45.570> a

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
well crow just to fasten them and in a

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.650 
well crow just to fasten them and in a
plastic<00:02:46.680> bag<00:02:47.070> just<00:02:47.370> you<00:02:47.700> know<00:02:47.820> if<00:02:48.000> anything
