so first I'm just going to cut out cut
off<00:02:25.939> a<00:02:26.420> piece<00:02:28.719> doesn't<00:02:29.719> have<00:02:29.959> to<00:02:30.079> be<00:02:30.230> this<00:02:31.219> is

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
off a piece doesn't have to be this is

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.190 
off a piece doesn't have to be this is
this<00:02:31.790> is<00:02:31.939> just<00:02:32.180> so<00:02:32.359> that<00:02:32.540> you<00:02:32.689> can<00:02:32.840> have<00:02:32.989> like<00:02:33.170> a

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
this is just so that you can have like a

00:02:52.149 --> 00:02:52.159 
laptop face down just like that and then

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:55.240 
laptop face down just like that and then
you're<00:02:52.549> going<00:02:52.639> to<00:02:52.730> take<00:02:52.909> a<00:02:52.939> pen<00:02:53.980> right<00:02:54.980> off<00:02:55.099> to

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:08.439 
get but I'm going to take a pen and then
just<00:03:01.930> trace<00:03:04.810> your<00:03:05.810> nap<00:03:06.109> top<00:03:06.379> a<00:03:06.560> try<00:03:07.099> to<00:03:07.449> bend

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:08.449 
just trace your nap top a try to bend

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:10.420 
just trace your nap top a try to bend
the<00:03:08.599> pen<00:03:08.810> in<00:03:09.019> just<00:03:09.230> a<00:03:09.409> slight<00:03:09.680> bit<00:03:09.709> like<00:03:10.159> if<00:03:10.310> you

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
the pen in just a slight bit like if you

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:16.539 
the pen in just a slight bit like if you
tilt<00:03:10.730> it<00:03:10.939> this<00:03:11.239> way<00:03:11.480> um<00:03:13.030> so<00:03:14.030> that<00:03:15.370> you're<00:03:16.370> kind

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:16.549 
tilt it this way um so that you're kind

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:20.920 
tilt it this way um so that you're kind
of<00:03:16.699> getting<00:03:16.819> closer<00:03:17.419> to<00:03:17.989> the<00:03:18.639> actual<00:03:19.780> type<00:03:20.780> so

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
of getting closer to the actual type so

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.119 
of getting closer to the actual type so
it's<00:03:21.049> not<00:03:21.169> like<00:03:21.319> wider<00:03:21.680> than<00:03:22.040> it<00:03:22.159> should<00:03:22.370> be

00:03:25.119 --> 00:03:25.129 

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:28.699 

then<00:03:26.129> you<00:03:26.250> can<00:03:26.400> just<00:03:26.549> cut<00:03:26.760> it<00:03:26.849> out<00:03:27.530> and<00:03:28.530> then

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
then you can just cut it out and then

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:38.910 
then you can just cut it out and then
cut<00:03:29.159> out<00:03:29.189> your

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:46.059 

you

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:46.069 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:52.869 

do<00:03:47.200> and<00:03:48.200> peel<00:03:49.040> it<00:03:49.069> off<00:03:50.980> and<00:03:51.980> this<00:03:52.519> is<00:03:52.670> going<00:03:52.819> to

00:03:52.869 --> 00:03:52.879 
do and peel it off and this is going to

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 
can buy I bought at one time it looks

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:30.250

it's<00:04:30.560> like<00:04:30.680> spray<00:04:31.070> paint<00:04:31.340> but<00:04:31.580> it's<00:04:31.850> actually

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 
it's like spray paint but it's actually

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.920 
it's like spray paint but it's actually
glue<00:04:32.540> and<00:04:33.610> it<00:04:34.610> works<00:04:34.850> on<00:04:35.000> so<00:04:35.210> many<00:04:35.330> things<00:04:35.450> okay

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:35.930
