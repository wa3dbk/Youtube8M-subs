now<00:00:07.080> we've<00:00:07.259> got<00:00:07.529> our<00:00:07.680> continuous<00:00:08.309> ink<00:00:08.519> system

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
now we've got our continuous ink system

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.350 
now we've got our continuous ink system
in<00:00:09.170> with<00:00:10.170> our<00:00:10.320> new<00:00:10.530> COC<00:00:11.160> smart<00:00:11.639> chips<00:00:11.969> and

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
in with our new COC smart chips and

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.749 
in with our new COC smart chips and
we're<00:00:13.259> going<00:00:13.410> to<00:00:13.440> do<00:00:13.590> a<00:00:13.620> firmware<00:00:13.950> update<00:00:14.250> and

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
we're going to do a firmware update and

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:31.120 
we're going to do a firmware update and
take<00:00:15.599> that<00:00:15.809> just<00:00:16.109> these<00:00:16.320> chips<00:00:16.650> down

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:31.130 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.820 

now<00:00:31.670> you<00:00:31.730> should<00:00:32.270> disable<00:00:32.830> automatic

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:33.830 
now you should disable automatic

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:37.060 
now you should disable automatic

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.070 
checking mark disable automatic tracking

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.430 
checking mark disable automatic tracking
that's<00:00:37.340> what<00:00:37.550> you<00:00:37.670> should<00:00:38.600> do<00:00:38.750> otherwise<00:00:39.110> you

this<00:01:52.450> shuts<00:01:52.750> down<00:01:52.990> any<00:01:53.259> chip<00:01:53.710> if<00:01:54.069> it<00:01:54.250> does<00:01:54.490> then

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:55.119 
this shuts down any chip if it does then

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:59.429 
this shuts down any chip if it does then
you<00:01:55.149> know<00:01:55.600> not<00:01:55.929> to<00:01:56.079> do<00:01:56.259> this<00:01:58.200> although<00:01:59.200> you

you're having a serious problem with the

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:10.010 
you're having a serious problem with the
printer

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.530 

now<00:02:10.830> I've<00:02:11.010> got<00:02:11.250> our<00:02:11.430> continuous<00:02:12.090> ink<00:02:12.300> system

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
now I've got our continuous ink system

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.630 
now I've got our continuous ink system
in<00:02:14.090> with<00:02:15.090> our<00:02:15.300> chips<00:02:15.690> on<00:02:15.930> the<00:02:16.080> cartridges<00:02:16.740> so

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
in with our chips on the cartridges so

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:18.620 
in with our chips on the cartridges so
we're<00:02:17.760> going<00:02:17.850> to<00:02:17.910> see<00:02:18.090> if<00:02:18.240> it's<00:02:18.390> going<00:02:18.570> to

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
we're going to see if it's going to

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.460 
we're going to see if it's going to
detect<00:02:19.050> them<00:02:19.290> and<00:02:19.440> then<00:02:19.830> shut<00:02:20.100> them<00:02:20.220> down<00:02:20.430> I

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
detect them and then shut them down I

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.550 
detect them and then shut them down I
just<00:02:22.470> installed<00:02:22.890> that<00:02:23.190> new<00:02:23.460> firmware<00:02:24.410> so<00:02:25.410> now

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
just installed that new firmware so now

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:33.530 
just installed that new firmware so now
we're<00:02:25.800> going<00:02:25.920> to<00:02:26.390> close<00:02:27.390> down<00:02:32.030> back<00:02:33.030> up<00:02:33.270> to

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
we're going to close down back up to

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.840 
we're going to close down back up to
print<00:02:34.340> go<00:02:35.340> to<00:02:35.400> properties<00:02:37.430> and<00:02:38.430> you<00:02:38.520> can<00:02:38.700> see

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
print go to properties and you can see

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.300 
print go to properties and you can see
I've<00:02:38.940> been<00:02:38.970> using<00:02:39.270> this<00:02:39.510> CIS<00:02:40.110> system<00:02:40.620> my<00:02:41.100> ink

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
I've been using this CIS system my ink

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:49.280 
I've been using this CIS system my ink
levels<00:02:41.730> are<00:02:41.880> down<00:02:47.600> everything<00:02:48.600> appears<00:02:49.080> to

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
levels are down everything appears to

00:02:49.290 --> 00:03:01.160 
levels are down everything appears to
look<00:02:49.470> ok<00:02:51.170> set<00:02:52.170> for<00:02:52.470> text<00:02:53.250> image<00:02:55.070> say<00:02:56.070> ok<00:02:58.550> ok<00:03:00.170> now

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
look ok set for text image say ok ok now

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.310 
look ok set for text image say ok ok now
let's<00:03:01.440> print<00:03:01.680> it<00:03:01.800> out<00:03:02.540> and<00:03:03.540> then<00:03:03.810> ask<00:03:04.020> me<00:03:04.200> again

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
let's print it out and then ask me again

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.690 
let's print it out and then ask me again
they're<00:03:04.710> not<00:03:04.740> genuine

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
they're not genuine

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:12.160 
they're not genuine
continue

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.039 

now<00:03:13.170> let's<00:03:13.349> go<00:03:13.530> over<00:03:13.680> to<00:03:13.709> the<00:03:13.920> printer<00:03:14.190> and

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:15.049 
now let's go over to the printer and

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:18.770 
now let's go over to the printer and
watch<00:03:16.049> it<00:03:16.260> print<00:03:16.530> out<00:03:16.760> get<00:03:17.760> up<00:03:17.909> the<00:03:18.060> top<00:03:18.299> open

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
watch it print out get up the top open
