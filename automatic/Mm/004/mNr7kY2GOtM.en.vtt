00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
take pictures and as you can tell I

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.800 
take pictures and as you can tell I
completely<00:02:58.930> killed<00:02:59.650> the<00:03:00.310> keypad<00:03:00.820> if<00:03:01.270> you<00:03:01.600> look

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
completely killed the keypad if you look

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.210 
completely killed the keypad if you look
right<00:03:02.680> here<00:03:02.820> so<00:03:03.820> yeah<00:03:04.630> and<00:03:04.870> it<00:03:05.380> lit<00:03:05.680> up<00:03:05.710> on<00:03:06.100> the

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
right here so yeah and it lit up on the

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.060 
right here so yeah and it lit up on the
sides<00:03:06.490> you<00:03:07.300> can<00:03:07.360> see<00:03:07.720> there<00:03:08.140> the<00:03:08.350> side<00:03:08.560> areas

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:09.070 
sides you can see there the side areas

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:10.530 
sides you can see there the side areas
where<00:03:09.310> it<00:03:09.400> would<00:03:09.520> light<00:03:09.700> up<00:03:09.730> when<00:03:10.090> it<00:03:10.210> writing

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
where it would light up when it writing

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.810 
where it would light up when it writing
so<00:03:10.780> it's<00:03:11.020> a<00:03:11.200> little<00:03:11.380> bit<00:03:11.470> different<00:03:11.980> a<00:03:12.130> little

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
so it's a little bit different a little

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.170 
so it's a little bit different a little
bit<00:03:13.030> more<00:03:13.210> of<00:03:13.300> an<00:03:13.390> upgrade<00:03:14.430> so<00:03:15.430> anyways<00:03:15.970> those

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
bit more of an upgrade so anyways those

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.720 
bit more of an upgrade so anyways those
are<00:03:16.210> the<00:03:16.420> nokias<00:03:16.900> and<00:03:17.170> then<00:03:17.830> finally<00:03:18.490> two

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
are the nokias and then finally two

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.460
