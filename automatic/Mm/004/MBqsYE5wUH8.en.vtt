 hello my name is alexander brother 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:22.830
 cue idea to record a series of instructional videos 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:25.170
 It was not by chance that the fact that 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.269
 currently on the internet is contained 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.240
 a lot of methodical videos that 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.369
 devoted to general issues I would like 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:38.940
 focus on articulation and on 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:41.340
 respiratory breathing techniques 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.110
 harmonica patterns these 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.180
 exercises contribute to working out 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.340
 diaphragmatic breathing once again want 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:51.120
 remind diaphragmatic breathing this 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:54.329
 the work of the lower abdomen works everything 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:58.590
 what is below the navel and all that is above the groin 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:01.379
 chest does not work shoulders together 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.670
 with the blades lowered down for 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.780
 demonstration first exercises 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:09.390

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.979
 hohner marine band steve backer hurry 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.310
 tool low 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:17.240
 has an added octave and velvety 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.360
 timbre it just enough to swing 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.360
 beginner 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.869
 the belly performer is the reason for 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:29.850
 which he applies first two 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:33.920
 exhalation two breaths dual you and exhalation three 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.920
 inhaling trioli first exercise 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.220
 the second exercise is triple 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:24.160
 it's always a soft rhythmic jerk 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:25.960
 belly and exercise test which can 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.300
 use to check status 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:30.360
 your throat let's say it works for you 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:33.400
 very good belly and you feel it 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:36.120
 but the sound is still dirty then rather 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:39.970
 total obstacle at throat level 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:43.110
 clamped glottis not necessary 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.110
 how it will sound 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:56.959
 use all the techniques for testing 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:03:01.549
 relax your throat and breathe 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:01.549
 free breath out 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.240
 power breath always set recruit 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:22.300
 from smaller to bigger 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:24.640
 do not start with a jerk if after 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:27.100
