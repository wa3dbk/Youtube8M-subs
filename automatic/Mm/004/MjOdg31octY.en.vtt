00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.759
 this time I will teach how to buy how 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.550
 the applications that are purchased are made 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:11.940
 with interest credit we do not buy them 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:15.269
 totally free with the application and 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.750
 app was good to install them we go 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.660
 that's good 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:23.260
 and we're going to add the official time of the 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.260
 application 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:30.529
 edit add and we write 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.529
 Silvia 

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:35.680
 crazy point doraemon puntocom 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.250
 the chairs I'll leave in the 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.600
 video description one you see added to 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.770
 the repo 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:50.090
 we go and install these 2 jeffrey 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:52.100
 instead of modifying you will continue 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.050
 installed the install then confirm 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.580
 is going to restart the stirrup and 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:59.710
 it will automatically install this 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:59.710
 another once the application is installed 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.530
 we open the application and we will 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:06.979
 appear this general window where 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:10.700
 says general we should have in speak in 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:14.060
 where it says of a love this is supposed 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.860
 plugin here is going to tell you to install 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.420
 You can also install any other 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.130
 application that these are applications 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.320
 that may not be compatible 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:24.220
 install the plugin so you can do 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.220
 that show how it works 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.579
 this application what is very well known 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.509
 for all you can get coins and 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.509
 free credit 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.729
 how can you see if nothing happened 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.840
 where he says get coins 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.369
 when they cost if you continue with the 9 pesos 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.580
 As you can see they are going up a thousand 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.789
 visits 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:12.709
 I can also raise the money 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:14.090
 and not in fact this is the only 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:15.939
 application with which it is compatible is 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:19.159
 compatible with plants by their zombies 

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:21.950
 captured from lyon 

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:23.840
 angry birds space 1 compatibility is 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:27.319
 practically with all the applications 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:30.470
 you disappoint for example this new no 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:31.849
 it's compatible but the truth is 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.930
 very few applications that do not 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:37.189
 are compatible with this application 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:40.810
 well this is all for today friends 

00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:40.810
 after they liked it, serve them
