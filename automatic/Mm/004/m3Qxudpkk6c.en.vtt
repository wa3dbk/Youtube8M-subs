00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:13.170
 hello dear user my name is with 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.920
 walker in this video any one 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:19.050
 Show trick as you often used 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.119
 system settings directly into the print 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.029
 gets here just like me just this 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:29.300
 attitude that is relatively simple he 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:31.769
 just go with the fender on the 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.380
 Hard disk of your computer on a card 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:39.210
 it is with me in the directory 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:44.010
 system libori and then there is here 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:47.160
 Preference pains that you follow the principle of 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.480
 whole hall program the the 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.670
 change settings 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:55.140
 and if is too powerful would to 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.090
 For example, let's take the energy saver 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.660
 options 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:04.589
 a right click or two fingers look 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:07.890
 so that should be a known this he needs 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:10.049
 of course the administrator password was 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.170
 he is here acting in the system around in 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.549
 principle I have here that is alias that 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.220
 is that with this little arrow 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.979
 the goal is to get out of my here 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.020
 desktop then copies that and that 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.490
 original so this is the one I delete 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.430
 Now watch again that he really does 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:31.100
 only the linkage clears it needs 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:34.259
 The password is spoils the 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:36.150
 if yes then you have the icon you take that 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.829
 just push it into the dock here 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.590
 Of course, there is only that right 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.540
 area and you can do that too 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:46.290
 delete again 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:51.090
 Whether you start with a click here 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:52.950
 left the system settings with the same 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.380
 Saving energy just like you do right now 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.780
 have set 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.280
 the s was the forces could all be 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.409
 make the ones you can find inside 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.320
 I hope the whole helps a bit 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.060
 for doing activities here again and again 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.619
 would have to be faster so so with 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.580
 Thank you for watching 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.580
