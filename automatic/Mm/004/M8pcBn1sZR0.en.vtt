00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
and now I'm gonna pull these pieces back

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.880 
and now I'm gonna pull these pieces back
in<00:02:09.300> the<00:02:09.450> same<00:02:09.660> manner<00:02:09.869> that<00:02:09.959> I<00:02:10.170> did<00:02:10.440> on<00:02:10.590> the

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
in the same manner that I did on the

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.130 
in the same manner that I did on the
other<00:02:11.039> side<00:02:11.340> and<00:02:11.700> as<00:02:12.480> you<00:02:12.510> pinned<00:02:12.870> them<00:02:12.989> back

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
other side and as you pinned them back

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.720 
other side and as you pinned them back
you<00:02:13.349> just<00:02:13.560> want<00:02:13.739> to<00:02:13.800> watch<00:02:13.950> the<00:02:14.220> top<00:02:14.430> of<00:02:14.610> this

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
you just want to watch the top of this

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.070 
you just want to watch the top of this
little<00:02:15.000> section<00:02:15.360> and<00:02:15.450> make<00:02:15.690> sure<00:02:15.840> that<00:02:15.959> it

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
little section and make sure that it

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.410 
little section and make sure that it
still<00:02:16.319> looks<00:02:16.590> pretty<00:02:16.890> because<00:02:17.640> it<00:02:18.030> might<00:02:18.209> peek

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
still looks pretty because it might peek

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.120 
still looks pretty because it might peek
out<00:02:18.599> from<00:02:18.780> over<00:02:19.050> the<00:02:19.140> little<00:02:19.410> looped<00:02:19.650> bun<00:02:19.950> that

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
out from over the little looped bun that

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.340 
out from over the little looped bun that
we<00:02:20.250> make<00:02:20.459> later<00:02:20.730> so<00:02:21.450> just<00:02:21.630> kind<00:02:21.810> of<00:02:21.900> arrange<00:02:22.200> it

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
we make later so just kind of arrange it

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:23.870 
we make later so just kind of arrange it
as<00:02:22.470> you<00:02:22.590> see<00:02:22.770> fit<00:02:22.980> to<00:02:23.040> make<00:02:23.310> it<00:02:23.459> as<00:02:23.550> pretty<00:02:23.760> as

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
as you see fit to make it as pretty as

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.500 
as you see fit to make it as pretty as
possible<00:02:24.510> and<00:02:25.250> then<00:02:26.250> for<00:02:26.550> her<00:02:26.670> size<00:02:26.910> things<00:02:27.330> I

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
possible and then for her size things I

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.240 
possible and then for her size things I
went<00:02:27.690> ahead<00:02:27.810> and<00:02:28.200> pinned<00:02:28.500> them<00:02:28.650> over<00:02:28.920> just<00:02:29.160> a

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
went ahead and pinned them over just a

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:30.590 
went ahead and pinned them over just a
little<00:02:29.280> bit<00:02:29.610> to<00:02:29.760> keep<00:02:29.880> them<00:02:30.060> from<00:02:30.209> falling<00:02:30.360> in

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
little bit to keep them from falling in

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.839 
little bit to keep them from falling in
her<00:02:30.690> face<00:02:30.900> throughout<00:02:31.290> the<00:02:31.440> day<00:02:31.590> and<00:02:31.890> then<00:02:32.819> she

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:32.849 
her face throughout the day and then she

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:34.610 
her face throughout the day and then she
was<00:02:33.209> wearing<00:02:33.450> in<00:02:33.569> jewels<00:02:33.750> headband<00:02:34.200> so<00:02:34.410> I<00:02:34.470> went

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
was wearing in jewels headband so I went

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.320 
was wearing in jewels headband so I went
ahead<00:02:34.680> and<00:02:34.800> applied<00:02:35.010> that<00:02:35.250> after<00:02:35.940> sweeping

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
ahead and applied that after sweeping

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:37.880 
ahead and applied that after sweeping
everything<00:02:36.569> back<00:02:36.930> because<00:02:37.290> it<00:02:37.440> makes<00:02:37.590> it<00:02:37.739> look

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
everything back because it makes it look

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.860 
everything back because it makes it look
much<00:02:38.040> more<00:02:38.310> organic<00:02:38.670> than<00:02:39.060> if<00:02:39.510> I<00:02:39.600> were<00:02:39.720> to

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
much more organic than if I were to

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.420 
much more organic than if I were to
sweep<00:02:40.080> everything<00:02:40.560> around<00:02:40.799> the<00:02:41.040> headband

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
sweep everything around the headband

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.059 
sweep everything around the headband
once<00:02:41.610> it<00:02:41.730> was<00:02:41.850> already<00:02:42.030> on<00:02:42.239> her<00:02:42.390> head<00:02:42.569> and<00:02:43.069> now

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
once it was already on her head and now

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:45.800 
once it was already on her head and now
we're<00:02:44.220> moving<00:02:44.340> on<00:02:44.580> to<00:02:44.730> the<00:02:44.850> back<00:02:45.000> this<00:02:45.630> is

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
we're moving on to the back this is

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.120 
we're moving on to the back this is
where<00:02:45.989> having<00:02:46.140> a<00:02:46.380> curling<00:02:46.620> iron<00:02:46.769> with<00:02:47.010> the

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
where having a curling iron with the

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:48.559 
where having a curling iron with the
clip<00:02:47.370> comes<00:02:47.610> in<00:02:47.730> really<00:02:47.880> handy<00:02:48.000> because<00:02:48.480> I

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
clip comes in really handy because I

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:50.120 
clip comes in really handy because I
tried<00:02:48.840> using<00:02:49.019> a<00:02:49.200> clipless<00:02:49.410> curling<00:02:49.799> iron<00:02:49.950> with

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
tried using a clipless curling iron with

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.470 
tried using a clipless curling iron with
her<00:02:50.250> when<00:02:50.400> we<00:02:50.489> did<00:02:50.610> her<00:02:50.730> trial<00:02:51.030> and<00:02:51.269> it<00:02:51.360> was

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
her when we did her trial and it was

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.330 
her when we did her trial and it was
basically<00:02:51.780> impossible<00:02:52.110> but<00:02:53.100> what<00:02:53.220> you're

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
basically impossible but what you're

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.400 
basically impossible but what you're
gonna<00:02:53.400> do<00:02:53.670> is<00:02:53.880> curl<00:02:54.209> the<00:02:54.330> hair<00:02:54.540> and<00:02:54.780> then

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
gonna do is curl the hair and then

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:56.750 
gonna do is curl the hair and then
you're<00:02:55.530> gonna<00:02:55.650> take<00:02:55.890> that<00:02:55.920> little<00:02:56.160> curl<00:02:56.519> and

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
you're gonna take that little curl and

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.610 
you're gonna take that little curl and
place<00:02:57.299> it<00:02:57.450> against<00:02:57.630> the<00:02:57.780> head<00:02:57.959> and<00:02:58.200> pin<00:02:58.530> it

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
place it against the head and pin it

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.620 
place it against the head and pin it
into<00:02:58.769> place<00:02:58.890> against<00:02:59.610> the<00:02:59.760> head<00:02:59.910> that's

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
into place against the head that's

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.090 
into place against the head that's
basically<00:03:01.200> what<00:03:01.380> you're<00:03:01.530> going<00:03:01.620> to<00:03:01.680> do<00:03:01.860> just

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
basically what you're going to do just

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.740 
basically what you're going to do just
pinning<00:03:02.310> it<00:03:02.549> at<00:03:02.700> different<00:03:02.970> angles<00:03:03.330> I

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
pinning it at different angles I

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.360 
pinning it at different angles I
recommend<00:03:04.500> taking<00:03:04.620> one<00:03:04.920> to<00:03:05.040> two<00:03:05.190> inch

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
recommend taking one to two inch

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.039 
recommend taking one to two inch
sections<00:03:05.819> because<00:03:06.060> the<00:03:06.360> bigger<00:03:06.540> sections

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.049 
sections because the bigger sections

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:12.070 
sections because the bigger sections
look<00:03:07.230> a<00:03:07.260> little<00:03:07.470> bit<00:03:07.650> prettier

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.420 

when<00:03:13.080> you<00:03:13.170> get<00:03:13.320> to<00:03:13.440> the<00:03:13.530> outside<00:03:13.980> you<00:03:14.160> want<00:03:14.250> to

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
when you get to the outside you want to

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.790 
when you get to the outside you want to
curl<00:03:14.670> back<00:03:14.940> in<00:03:15.150> toward<00:03:15.780> the<00:03:16.080> little<00:03:16.440> bun<00:03:16.620> that

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
curl back in toward the little bun that

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.920 
curl back in toward the little bun that
we're<00:03:16.920> making<00:03:17.040> here<00:03:17.460> and<00:03:17.670> then<00:03:18.270> arrange<00:03:18.540> that

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
we're making here and then arrange that

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.600 
we're making here and then arrange that
in<00:03:19.170> a<00:03:19.260> way<00:03:19.380> that's<00:03:19.590> really<00:03:19.740> pretty<00:03:20.100> I<00:03:20.190> kind<00:03:20.580> of

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
in a way that's really pretty I kind of

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.310 
in a way that's really pretty I kind of
like<00:03:20.790> taking<00:03:21.120> it<00:03:21.240> on<00:03:21.390> top<00:03:21.660> like<00:03:21.690> you<00:03:21.900> see<00:03:22.170> here

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
like taking it on top like you see here

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.230 
like taking it on top like you see here
cuz<00:03:22.560> it<00:03:22.710> creates<00:03:22.980> that<00:03:23.070> cool<00:03:23.370> upswept<00:03:23.880> effect

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:24.240 
cuz it creates that cool upswept effect

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.420 
cuz it creates that cool upswept effect
on<00:03:24.420> the<00:03:24.510> side<00:03:24.720> and<00:03:25.440> pinning<00:03:25.770> it<00:03:25.830> back<00:03:26.040> in<00:03:26.250> right

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
on the side and pinning it back in right

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.850 
on the side and pinning it back in right
there<00:03:26.700> in<00:03:26.970> the<00:03:27.090> middle<00:03:27.270> and<00:03:27.560> then<00:03:28.560> you'll<00:03:28.710> see

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
there in the middle and then you'll see

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.110 
there in the middle and then you'll see
that<00:03:29.010> I<00:03:29.040> do<00:03:29.130> this<00:03:29.340> on<00:03:29.490> the<00:03:29.610> other<00:03:29.730> side<00:03:29.940> as<00:03:30.090> well

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
that I do this on the other side as well

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.780 
that I do this on the other side as well
I<00:03:30.510> think<00:03:31.170> a<00:03:31.560> lot<00:03:31.860> of<00:03:31.890> what<00:03:32.160> has<00:03:32.310> to<00:03:32.460> do<00:03:32.580> with

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
I think a lot of what has to do with

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.590 
I think a lot of what has to do with
