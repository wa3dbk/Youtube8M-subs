close to recharge that are side by side
so<00:03:48.360> we<00:03:48.930> get<00:03:49.110> 18<00:03:50.070> laps<00:03:50.280> to<00:03:50.610> figure<00:03:51.060> out<00:03:51.150> who's

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
so we get 18 laps to figure out who's

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
not trying to sit behind and learn

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.780 
not trying to sit behind and learn
so<00:04:07.470> obviously<00:04:08.470> we're<00:04:08.680> close<00:04:09.099> sometimes<00:04:09.519> we

so obviously we're close sometimes we

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:11.910 
so obviously we're close sometimes we
start<00:04:10.060> side<00:04:10.299> by<00:04:10.420> side

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:11.920
