hi<00:00:04.859> I'm<00:00:05.009> Brent<00:00:05.279> with<00:00:05.430> LED<00:00:05.730> technologies<00:00:06.330> and

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
hi I'm Brent with LED technologies and

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.839 
hi I'm Brent with LED technologies and
you're<00:00:07.529> watching<00:00:07.710> Brent's<00:00:08.160> blog<00:00:08.370> and<00:00:08.670> I'm

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
you're watching Brent's blog and I'm

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:10.940 
you're watching Brent's blog and I'm
excited<00:00:09.210> about<00:00:09.360> today's<00:00:09.780> training<00:00:10.260> we're

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
excited about today's training we're

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.259 
excited about today's training we're
going<00:00:10.980> to<00:00:11.130> be<00:00:11.190> talking<00:00:11.400> about<00:00:11.460> infrared<00:00:11.910> light

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
going to be talking about infrared light

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.289 
going to be talking about infrared light
so<00:00:12.960> people<00:00:13.110> buy<00:00:13.380> our<00:00:13.410> nube<00:00:14.040> and<00:00:14.730> they<00:00:15.030> turn<00:00:15.210> it

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
so people buy our nube and they turn it

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:16.760 
so people buy our nube and they turn it
on<00:00:15.389> for<00:00:15.719> the<00:00:15.750> first<00:00:15.990> time<00:00:16.199> at<00:00:16.350> home<00:00:16.529> and<00:00:16.710> they

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
on for the first time at home and they

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.680 
on for the first time at home and they
say<00:00:16.949> there's<00:00:17.310> only<00:00:17.460> four<00:00:17.760> lights<00:00:18.000> working<00:00:18.480> all

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
say there's only four lights working all

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.630 
say there's only four lights working all
the<00:00:18.900> other<00:00:19.020> lights<00:00:19.230> aren't<00:00:19.439> working<00:00:19.560> well<00:00:20.520> in

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
the other lights aren't working well in

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.130 
the other lights aren't working well in
fact<00:00:20.789> they<00:00:21.029> are<00:00:21.150> working<00:00:21.480> there<00:00:21.900> are<00:00:21.990> all

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
fact they are working there are all

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.410 
fact they are working there are all
infrared<00:00:22.710> light<00:00:22.920> and<00:00:23.100> our<00:00:23.609> naked<00:00:23.970> eye<00:00:24.060> can't

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
infrared light and our naked eye can't

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.779 
infrared light and our naked eye can't
see<00:00:24.510> infrared<00:00:24.869> light<00:00:25.350> so<00:00:25.650> I<00:00:26.160> thought<00:00:26.550> I'd<00:00:26.670> talk

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
see infrared light so I thought I'd talk

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.970 
see infrared light so I thought I'd talk
about<00:00:27.060> that<00:00:27.240> briefly<00:00:27.480> and<00:00:27.930> how<00:00:28.080> I<00:00:28.410> can<00:00:28.619> prove

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
about that briefly and how I can prove

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.740 
about that briefly and how I can prove
to<00:00:29.039> you<00:00:29.250> in<00:00:29.609> a<00:00:29.880> little<00:00:30.000> some<00:00:30.269> couple<00:00:30.570> little

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
to you in a little some couple little

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.600 
to you in a little some couple little
flames<00:00:30.990> experiments<00:00:31.590> that<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.250> infrared

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
flames experiments that the infrared

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:33.830 
flames experiments that the infrared
light<00:00:32.640> is<00:00:33.030> actually<00:00:33.420> working

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
light is actually working

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.350 
light is actually working
some<00:00:34.469> people<00:00:34.710> say<00:00:34.860> they<00:00:35.100> saw<00:00:35.340> it<00:00:35.520> alight<00:00:35.760> and

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
some people say they saw it alight and

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.090 
some people say they saw it alight and
they<00:00:36.690> were<00:00:36.750> working<00:00:37.230> when<00:00:37.350> I<00:00:37.380> bought<00:00:37.620> them<00:00:37.860> and

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
they were working when I bought them and

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.130 
they were working when I bought them and
now<00:00:38.670> they're<00:00:38.850> not<00:00:39.030> and<00:00:39.420> we<00:00:39.540> never<00:00:39.719> never<00:00:39.899> I

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
now they're not and we never never I

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.299 
now they're not and we never never I
don't<00:00:40.290> necessarily<00:00:40.410> understand<00:00:41.010> how<00:00:41.160> that

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
don't necessarily understand how that

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.220 
don't necessarily understand how that
can<00:00:41.430> possibly<00:00:41.610> happen<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.719> only<00:00:42.870> thing<00:00:42.989> I<00:00:43.050> can

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
can possibly happen the only thing I can

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.810 
can possibly happen the only thing I can
think<00:00:43.260> of<00:00:43.500> is<00:00:43.649> when<00:00:43.800> you<00:00:43.890> look<00:00:44.070> at<00:00:44.219> this<00:00:44.399> the

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
think of is when you look at this the

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.400 
think of is when you look at this the
red<00:00:45.000> are<00:00:45.149> actually<00:00:45.480> shining<00:00:45.899> through<00:00:46.230> the

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
red are actually shining through the

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.250 
red are actually shining through the
infrared<00:00:46.950> so<00:00:47.879> sometimes<00:00:48.450> maybe<00:00:48.690> make<00:00:49.079> them

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
infrared so sometimes maybe make them

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.600 
infrared so sometimes maybe make them
look<00:00:49.500> like<00:00:49.710> they're<00:00:49.920> lighting<00:00:50.129> up<00:00:50.340> but

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
look like they're lighting up but

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.490 
look like they're lighting up but
they're<00:00:50.760> really<00:00:50.910> not<00:00:51.120> so<00:00:52.050> what<00:00:52.170> I've<00:00:52.260> done<00:00:52.440> is

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
they're really not so what I've done is

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.040 
they're really not so what I've done is
the<00:00:52.770> first<00:00:52.980> I<00:00:53.129> set<00:00:53.370> up<00:00:53.399> a<00:00:53.660> handheld<00:00:54.660> at<00:00:54.899> where

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
the first I set up a handheld at where

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.260 
the first I set up a handheld at where
I've<00:00:55.140> taken<00:00:55.170> black<00:00:55.710> tape<00:00:56.039> and<00:00:56.340> blocked<00:00:57.059> off

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
I've taken black tape and blocked off

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.000 
I've taken black tape and blocked off
all<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.690> red<00:00:57.840> lights<00:00:57.870> so<00:00:58.530> now<00:00:58.800> we're<00:00:58.980> just

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
all the red lights so now we're just

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.830 
all the red lights so now we're just
seeing<00:00:59.370> pretty<00:00:59.760> much<00:00:59.969> pretty<00:01:00.270> much<00:01:00.329> infrared

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
seeing pretty much pretty much infrared

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.000 
seeing pretty much pretty much infrared
there's<00:01:01.020> a<00:01:01.079> little<00:01:01.289> red<00:01:01.440> that's<00:01:01.620> still<00:01:01.829> going

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
there's a little red that's still going

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.950 
there's a little red that's still going
through<00:01:02.190> so<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.239> first<00:01:03.449> experiment<00:01:03.719> I'm

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
through so the first experiment I'm

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.870 
through so the first experiment I'm
going<00:01:04.080> to<00:01:04.140> do<00:01:04.229> is<00:01:04.350> I<00:01:04.470> got<00:01:04.500> some<00:01:04.860> heat<00:01:05.400> sensitive

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
going to do is I got some heat sensitive

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.609 
going to do is I got some heat sensitive
paper<00:01:06.060> I<00:01:06.420> took<00:01:06.659> this<00:01:06.810> heat<00:01:07.020> sensitive<00:01:07.350> paper

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
paper I took this heat sensitive paper

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.149 
paper I took this heat sensitive paper
here<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:09.260> what<00:01:10.260> this<00:01:10.380> is<00:01:10.590> is<00:01:10.799> when<00:01:10.950> we<00:01:11.040> you

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
here and what this is is when we you

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.700 
here and what this is is when we you
know<00:01:11.189> if<00:01:11.369> I<00:01:11.460> put<00:01:11.610> some<00:01:11.820> heat<00:01:12.000> against<00:01:12.420> it<00:01:12.710> you

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
know if I put some heat against it you

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.590 
know if I put some heat against it you
can<00:01:13.860> see<00:01:14.010> my<00:01:14.189> hand<00:01:14.430> print<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:15.150> heat<00:01:15.299> comes

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
can see my hand print the heat comes

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.810 
can see my hand print the heat comes
through<00:01:15.930> so<00:01:16.799> what<00:01:17.189> we're<00:01:17.310> going<00:01:17.400> to<00:01:17.460> do<00:01:17.580> is<00:01:17.729> I

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
through so what we're going to do is I

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.640 
through so what we're going to do is I
cut<00:01:18.060> out<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.210> little<00:01:18.360> section<00:01:18.630> of<00:01:18.900> that<00:01:19.020> paper

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
cut out a little section of that paper

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.670 
cut out a little section of that paper
and<00:01:20.189> I've<00:01:21.030> got<00:01:21.180> it<00:01:21.299> here<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:22.439> first<00:01:22.619> thing

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
and I've got it here and the first thing

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.740 
and I've got it here and the first thing
I'm<00:01:22.890> going<00:01:22.979> to<00:01:23.070> do<00:01:23.159> is<00:01:23.340> put<00:01:23.909> it<00:01:24.000> on<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.210> nube

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
I'm going to do is put it on the nube

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.480 
I'm going to do is put it on the nube
we're<00:01:25.619> just<00:01:25.799> going<00:01:25.920> to<00:01:25.950> stick<00:01:26.189> it<00:01:26.310> right<00:01:26.340> on

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
we're just going to stick it right on

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.300 
we're just going to stick it right on
here<00:01:26.850> like<00:01:26.970> this<00:01:27.210> for<00:01:28.020> a<00:01:28.049> couple<00:01:28.350> seconds<00:01:28.740> pull

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
here like this for a couple seconds pull

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.330 
here like this for a couple seconds pull
away<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:29.909> you<00:01:30.060> should<00:01:30.270> see<00:01:30.540> now<00:01:31.159> little<00:01:32.159> red

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
away and you should see now little red

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.390 
away and you should see now little red
dots<00:01:32.640> or<00:01:33.600> little<00:01:33.930> white<00:01:34.079> dot<00:01:34.320> excuse<00:01:34.680> me<00:01:34.829> I'm

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
dots or little white dot excuse me I'm

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.010 
dots or little white dot excuse me I'm
going<00:01:35.490> to<00:01:35.549> put<00:01:35.700> on<00:01:35.729> here<00:01:36.000> again<00:01:36.270> you'll<00:01:36.869> see

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
going to put on here again you'll see

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.319 
going to put on here again you'll see
little<00:01:37.200> white<00:01:37.439> dots<00:01:37.710> where<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.159> heat<00:01:38.369> was<00:01:38.549> see

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
little white dots where the heat was see

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.980 
little white dots where the heat was see
you<00:01:39.479> see<00:01:40.409> just<00:01:40.590> a<00:01:40.680> little<00:01:40.770> bit<00:01:40.920> yep<00:01:41.729> so<00:01:42.270> that's

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
you see just a little bit yep so that's

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.840 
you see just a little bit yep so that's
one<00:01:43.350> example<00:01:43.530> I<00:01:43.950> could<00:01:44.100> put<00:01:44.220> that<00:01:44.340> on<00:01:44.460> longer

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
one example I could put that on longer

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.969 
one example I could put that on longer
I've<00:01:44.970> got<00:01:45.119> some<00:01:45.299> more<00:01:45.450> sensitive<00:01:45.960> paper<00:01:46.140> that

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
I've got some more sensitive paper that

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.179 
I've got some more sensitive paper that
works<00:01:47.159> a<00:01:47.280> little<00:01:47.399> better<00:01:47.960> this<00:01:48.960> is<00:01:49.020> a<00:01:49.649> liquid

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
works a little better this is a liquid

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.069 
works a little better this is a liquid
crystal<00:01:50.460> paper<00:01:50.970> that<00:01:51.240> shows<00:01:51.420> heat<00:01:51.750> a<00:01:51.780> lot

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
crystal paper that shows heat a lot

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.620 
crystal paper that shows heat a lot
better<00:01:52.320> and<00:01:52.530> so<00:01:52.649> if<00:01:52.710> I<00:01:52.770> put<00:01:53.009> it<00:01:53.100> on<00:01:53.220> here<00:01:53.640> and<00:01:53.759> I

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
better and so if I put it on here and I

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.830 
better and so if I put it on here and I
take<00:01:54.840> it<00:01:54.960> off<00:01:55.170> get<00:01:56.040> to<00:01:56.189> put<00:01:56.340> it<00:01:56.399> on<00:01:56.490> enough<00:01:56.850> so

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
take it off get to put it on enough so

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.709 
take it off get to put it on enough so
you<00:01:57.930> can<00:01:58.079> see<00:01:58.320> it<00:01:58.939> you<00:01:59.939> start<00:02:00.390> to<00:02:00.420> see<00:02:00.570> the

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
you can see it you start to see the

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:04.539 
you can see it you start to see the
color<00:02:01.110> come<00:02:01.469> through<00:02:01.680> I'll<00:02:01.799> do<00:02:01.920> it<00:02:01.979> again

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:04.549 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:06.069 

after<00:02:05.180> a<00:02:05.240> little<00:02:05.359> bit<00:02:05.479> you<00:02:05.719> see<00:02:05.899> how<00:02:06.020> the

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:06.079 
after a little bit you see how the

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:07.749 
after a little bit you see how the
little<00:02:06.380> red<00:02:06.560> the<00:02:06.799> little<00:02:07.100> dots<00:02:07.280> are<00:02:07.520> coming

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:07.759 
little red the little dots are coming

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:09.790 
little red the little dots are coming
through<00:02:07.969> on<00:02:08.269> the<00:02:08.810> whole<00:02:08.959> system<00:02:09.379> that<00:02:09.530> shows

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
through on the whole system that shows

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.610 
through on the whole system that shows
that<00:02:10.399> the<00:02:10.550> other<00:02:10.750> the<00:02:11.750> other<00:02:11.900> lights<00:02:12.200> on<00:02:12.440> the

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
that the other the other lights on the

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:13.900 
that the other the other lights on the
system<00:02:12.920> are<00:02:13.040> actually<00:02:13.129> working<00:02:13.459> we<00:02:13.730> just

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
system are actually working we just

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:15.130 
system are actually working we just
can't<00:02:14.090> see<00:02:14.360> them<00:02:14.480> you<00:02:14.660> can<00:02:14.780> see<00:02:14.930> all<00:02:15.019> the

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
can't see them you can see all the

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.979 
can't see them you can see all the
little<00:02:15.290> dots<00:02:15.530> there<00:02:15.940> the<00:02:16.940> last<00:02:17.120> experiment<00:02:17.840> is

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 
little dots there the last experiment is

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:20.380 
little dots there the last experiment is
a<00:02:18.340> different<00:02:19.340> temperature<00:02:19.610> paper<00:02:20.000> I'll<00:02:20.209> put

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
a different temperature paper I'll put

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.050 
a different temperature paper I'll put
on<00:02:20.420> here<00:02:20.900> and<00:02:21.019> you'll<00:02:21.709> see<00:02:21.819> the<00:02:22.819> lights

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
on here and you'll see the lights

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.000 
on here and you'll see the lights
shining<00:02:23.690> will<00:02:24.470> change<00:02:25.190> the<00:02:25.340> color<00:02:25.519> of<00:02:25.700> the<00:02:27.010> all

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
shining will change the color of the all

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.440 
shining will change the color of the all
at<00:02:28.250> once<00:02:28.459> you'll<00:02:28.640> see<00:02:28.790> them<00:02:28.910> change<00:02:29.180> color

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
at once you'll see them change color

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.390 
at once you'll see them change color
there<00:02:30.260> it's<00:02:30.440> starting<00:02:30.680> to<00:02:30.739> come<00:02:30.890> through<00:02:31.220> and

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
there it's starting to come through and

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.280 
there it's starting to come through and
that<00:02:31.879> shows<00:02:32.150> you<00:02:32.330> all<00:02:32.540> the<00:02:32.720> other<00:02:32.870> lights<00:02:33.140> are

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
that shows you all the other lights are

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.390 
that shows you all the other lights are
actually<00:02:33.410> producing<00:02:34.120> producing<00:02:35.120> Heat<00:02:36.400> even

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
actually producing producing Heat even

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.370 
actually producing producing Heat even
though<00:02:37.489> you<00:02:37.549> can't<00:02:37.819> see<00:02:37.910> them<00:02:38.209> that's<00:02:39.140> pretty

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
though you can't see them that's pretty

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.170 
though you can't see them that's pretty
interesting<00:02:39.590> to<00:02:39.920> me<00:02:40.040> and<00:02:40.250> the<00:02:40.910> final

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
interesting to me and the final

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.330 
interesting to me and the final
experiment<00:02:41.480> which<00:02:41.840> is<00:02:42.019> why<00:02:42.799> far<00:02:43.010> the<00:02:43.160> coolest

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
experiment which is why far the coolest

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.330 
experiment which is why far the coolest
I<00:02:43.700> think<00:02:44.000> is<00:02:44.150> you<00:02:44.900> can<00:02:45.049> see<00:02:45.290> like<00:02:45.769> if<00:02:45.980> I<00:02:46.099> take<00:02:46.310> a

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
I think is you can see like if I take a

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.089 
I think is you can see like if I take a
digital<00:02:47.239> camera<00:02:47.690> and<00:02:48.019> I<00:02:48.650> turn<00:02:48.829> on<00:02:48.860> the<00:02:49.069> camera

00:02:49.089 --> 00:02:49.099 
digital camera and I turn on the camera

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:52.180 
digital camera and I turn on the camera
part<00:02:49.819> of<00:02:49.940> it<00:02:50.060> you<00:02:50.480> can<00:02:50.630> actually<00:02:50.780> see<00:02:51.190> infrared

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
part of it you can actually see infrared

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:53.800 
part of it you can actually see infrared
light<00:02:52.459> show<00:02:52.670> up<00:02:52.819> in<00:02:52.940> a<00:02:53.030> camera<00:02:53.510> where<00:02:53.720> you

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
light show up in a camera where you

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.470 
light show up in a camera where you
can't<00:02:54.049> see<00:02:54.290> it<00:02:54.489> without<00:02:55.489> the<00:02:55.760> digital<00:02:55.910> camera

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
can't see it without the digital camera

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.870 
can't see it without the digital camera
so<00:02:56.959> what<00:02:57.110> I've<00:02:57.200> done<00:02:57.349> is<00:02:57.410> I've<00:02:57.680> got<00:02:57.860> a<00:02:57.920> I've<00:02:58.310> got

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
so what I've done is I've got a I've got

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.330 
so what I've done is I've got a I've got
a<00:02:59.030> second<00:02:59.450> camera<00:02:59.690> here<00:03:00.170> I'm<00:03:00.980> going<00:03:01.130> to<00:03:01.220> show

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
a second camera here I'm going to show

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:02.740 
a second camera here I'm going to show
it<00:03:01.400> to<00:03:01.549> you<00:03:01.640> it's<00:03:01.760> just<00:03:01.910> one<00:03:02.060> of<00:03:02.090> these<00:03:02.209> I<00:03:02.269> you

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
it to you it's just one of these I you

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.559 
it to you it's just one of these I you
know<00:03:02.870> eyeball<00:03:03.230> as<00:03:03.349> you<00:03:03.440> put<00:03:03.590> on<00:03:03.709> a<00:03:04.569> computer

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:05.569 
know eyeball as you put on a computer

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:06.699 
know eyeball as you put on a computer
the<00:03:05.690> camera<00:03:05.989> you're<00:03:06.110> watching<00:03:06.440> me<00:03:06.530> the

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
the camera you're watching me the

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:09.759 
the camera you're watching me the
primary<00:03:07.099> camera<00:03:07.310> are<00:03:07.489> watching<00:03:07.760> me<00:03:08.769> filters

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
primary camera are watching me filters

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:11.470 
primary camera are watching me filters
out<00:03:09.920> infrared<00:03:10.280> just<00:03:10.579> like<00:03:10.730> our<00:03:10.880> eyes<00:03:10.910> so

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
out infrared just like our eyes so

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:12.610 
out infrared just like our eyes so
you're<00:03:11.630> not<00:03:11.720> seeing<00:03:11.959> it<00:03:12.200> when<00:03:12.500> you're

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
you're not seeing it when you're

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.319 
you're not seeing it when you're
watching<00:03:12.709> it<00:03:12.980> here<00:03:13.340> but<00:03:13.790> you're<00:03:13.940> seeing<00:03:14.120> it<00:03:14.299> on

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:14.329 
watching it here but you're seeing it on

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:15.849 
watching it here but you're seeing it on
this<00:03:14.510> little<00:03:14.720> video<00:03:14.870> that<00:03:15.200> I<00:03:15.260> just<00:03:15.290> popped<00:03:15.650> up

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:15.859 
this little video that I just popped up

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:18.490 
this little video that I just popped up
and<00:03:16.120> you're<00:03:17.120> seeing<00:03:17.420> infrared<00:03:17.840> light<00:03:18.019> shining

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
and you're seeing infrared light shining

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.229 
and you're seeing infrared light shining
there<00:03:18.680> because<00:03:18.859> it's<00:03:19.010> a<00:03:19.100> cheaper<00:03:19.430> cheaper<00:03:19.880> and

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239 
there because it's a cheaper cheaper and

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:24.759 
there because it's a cheaper cheaper and
lower<00:03:20.780> quality<00:03:21.230> camera<00:03:21.680> so<00:03:23.380> you<00:03:24.380> know<00:03:24.470> that's

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769 
lower quality camera so you know that's

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:26.050 
lower quality camera so you know that's
pretty<00:03:25.010> interesting<00:03:25.250> that<00:03:25.549> you<00:03:25.639> can<00:03:25.790> see<00:03:25.940> the

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
pretty interesting that you can see the

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:27.400 
pretty interesting that you can see the
light<00:03:26.209> there<00:03:26.480> but<00:03:26.690> you<00:03:26.780> can't<00:03:26.989> see<00:03:27.170> the<00:03:27.260> light

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
light there but you can't see the light

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:28.930 
light there but you can't see the light
on<00:03:27.440> the<00:03:27.650> other<00:03:27.680> camera<00:03:28.190> I've<00:03:28.579> got<00:03:28.819> this

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
on the other camera I've got this

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.210 
on the other camera I've got this
infrared<00:03:29.329> filter<00:03:29.840> that<00:03:30.650> I'm<00:03:30.769> going<00:03:30.950> to<00:03:31.010> shine

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
infrared filter that I'm going to shine

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.460 
infrared filter that I'm going to shine
I'm<00:03:31.370> going<00:03:31.519> to<00:03:31.579> block<00:03:31.760> the<00:03:31.970> light<00:03:32.180> and<00:03:32.450> it's<00:03:33.349> an

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
I'm going to block the light and it's an

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:34.780 
I'm going to block the light and it's an
infrared<00:03:33.769> filter<00:03:34.190> that<00:03:34.280> you<00:03:34.370> would<00:03:34.489> put<00:03:34.639> on<00:03:34.670> a

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
infrared filter that you would put on a

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.000 
infrared filter that you would put on a
camera<00:03:35.180> and<00:03:35.269> so<00:03:35.420> if<00:03:35.480> I<00:03:35.599> put<00:03:36.260> that<00:03:36.290> over<00:03:36.620> top<00:03:36.980> of

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
camera and so if I put that over top of

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.089 
camera and so if I put that over top of
this<00:03:37.280> you'll<00:03:37.579> see<00:03:38.380> interestingly<00:03:39.380> enough

00:03:40.089 --> 00:03:40.099 
this you'll see interestingly enough

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:42.940 
this you'll see interestingly enough
maybe<00:03:41.090> at<00:03:41.269> the<00:03:41.359> right<00:03:41.480> camera<00:03:41.660> you'll<00:03:42.470> see<00:03:42.709> it

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:42.950 
maybe at the right camera you'll see it

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:44.559 
maybe at the right camera you'll see it
actually<00:03:43.310> blocks<00:03:43.549> the<00:03:43.760> infrared<00:03:44.269> so<00:03:44.450> that

00:03:44.559 --> 00:03:44.569 
actually blocks the infrared so that

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:46.900 
actually blocks the infrared so that
shows<00:03:44.870> you<00:03:44.900> these<00:03:45.739> infrared<00:03:46.160> are<00:03:46.459> putting<00:03:46.790> out

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:46.910 
shows you these infrared are putting out

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:48.789 
shows you these infrared are putting out
a<00:03:46.940> lot<00:03:47.180> of<00:03:47.209> energy<00:03:47.419> our<00:03:47.870> eyes<00:03:48.260> can't<00:03:48.590> pick<00:03:48.769> that

00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:48.799 
a lot of energy our eyes can't pick that

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:50.740 
a lot of energy our eyes can't pick that
up<00:03:48.980> so<00:03:49.730> when<00:03:49.849> you<00:03:49.940> think<00:03:50.150> your<00:03:50.269> system<00:03:50.599> is<00:03:50.660> not

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
up so when you think your system is not

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.170 
up so when you think your system is not
working<00:03:50.959> it<00:03:51.349> is<00:03:51.650> in<00:03:51.859> fact<00:03:52.069> working<00:03:52.370> and<00:03:52.790> you

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
working it is in fact working and you

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.150 
working it is in fact working and you
can<00:03:53.299> especially<00:03:53.780> tell<00:03:53.989> at<00:03:54.169> home<00:03:54.560> if<00:03:54.829> you<00:03:54.919> don't

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.160 
can especially tell at home if you don't

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.069 
can especially tell at home if you don't
have<00:03:55.280> a<00:03:55.310> digital<00:03:55.459> camera<00:03:55.819> you<00:03:56.060> can<00:03:56.209> feel<00:03:56.510> and

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:57.079 
have a digital camera you can feel and

00:03:57.079 --> 00:03:58.479 
have a digital camera you can feel and
you'll<00:03:57.200> feel<00:03:57.349> warmth<00:03:57.769> up<00:03:57.950> to<00:03:58.069> the<00:03:58.160> system's

00:03:58.479 --> 00:03:58.489 
you'll feel warmth up to the system's

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:00.339 
you'll feel warmth up to the system's
been<00:03:58.609> on<00:03:58.730> for<00:03:59.000> 2<00:03:59.150> 3<00:03:59.359> minutes<00:03:59.660> you'll<00:04:00.139> feel

00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:00.349 
been on for 2 3 minutes you'll feel

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:01.930 
been on for 2 3 minutes you'll feel
warmth<00:04:00.680> on<00:04:00.799> all<00:04:00.919> those<00:04:01.010> LEDs<00:04:01.430> that<00:04:01.639> tells<00:04:01.849> you

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940 
warmth on all those LEDs that tells you

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.960 
warmth on all those LEDs that tells you
it's<00:04:02.090> working<00:04:02.419> those<00:04:03.349> little<00:04:03.650> red<00:04:03.799> lights<00:04:04.040> put

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 
it's working those little red lights put

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:06.759 
it's working those little red lights put
out<00:04:05.090> energy<00:04:05.450> but<00:04:05.720> nowhere<00:04:06.049> near<00:04:06.109> the<00:04:06.620> actual

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:06.769 
out energy but nowhere near the actual

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:09.129 
out energy but nowhere near the actual
infrared<00:04:07.340> light<00:04:07.549> thing<00:04:07.910> just<00:04:08.150> came<00:04:08.299> on<00:04:08.450> anyway

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:09.139 
infrared light thing just came on anyway

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:10.930 
infrared light thing just came on anyway
I<00:04:09.169> hope<00:04:09.349> that<00:04:09.440> helps<00:04:09.620> to<00:04:10.010> clarify<00:04:10.250> it<00:04:10.519> infrared

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:10.940 
I hope that helps to clarify it infrared

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:12.939 
I hope that helps to clarify it infrared
light<00:04:11.150> and<00:04:11.419> if<00:04:12.049> you<00:04:12.139> have<00:04:12.230> any<00:04:12.380> more<00:04:12.500> questions
