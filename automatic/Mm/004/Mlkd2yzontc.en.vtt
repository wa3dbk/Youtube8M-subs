00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:07.930
 Oh Jesus of Good Hope, Redeemer of my soul, Lord of heaven and earth, 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:14.930
 I come to You attracted by your fatherly love. Who but You will be able to cure my ailments? 

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:22.239
 I approach your holy temple as the source of your kindness. Favor me with your help, 

00:00:22.239 --> 00:00:28.800
 purify me with your eyes as you did with your apostle Peter, heal me of the mortals 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.660
 wounds that sin has left in my soul. 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:39.019
 I well know that all those who have requested your image before your divine favors have been 

00:00:39.019 --> 00:00:46.639
 rescued and that there is no one who has not experienced your consolations, or left your presence without 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.640
 hopes Full of the highest confidence I ask you for the 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:59.860
 Holy Church today persecuted and slandered, by the Pope, by the bishops, by the priests, 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:06.720
 for the poor and for the difficulty in which I am currently and that You know what it is. 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:15.360
 I place it in your merciful hands in order that you may bless and sanctify them. I am 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:22.060
 willing to accept everything you have, because that will be the best for me. If what 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:29.060
 I ask you not to be for the good of my soul, then give me the grace to understand it and so 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:36.720
 accept it willingly. I know, then, my support, my guide, my good, my hope. 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.820
 Amen. 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.600
 Glory to the Father, Glory to the Son 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.780
 And Glory to the Holy Spirit. 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.760
 As it was in the beginning, Now and always 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.900
 Forever and ever. 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.020
 Amen.
