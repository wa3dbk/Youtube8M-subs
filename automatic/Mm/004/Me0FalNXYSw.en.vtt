00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.900
 the xxi as if you welcome another 9 and you 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.890
 with what they saw in the title 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:26.939
 gta 5 dlc filtered information jetpacks 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:30.570
 new drug trafficking cars and garages 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:32.730
 three-floor marine hangars heliports 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.559
 and more things that are going to come for big 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.690
 5 cars and large auto online ok 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.640
 so let's start with this and 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.040
 look here is the first thing that goes 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.050
 making the list of what is new 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.970
 that connote in two new cars that 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.250
 are what is doing the most sacred and the 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:49.140
 pse environment and also the beat there because 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.210
 So these are the new cars that 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.670
 have been filtered by information of what 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.129
 I 've been reading from twitter 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.839
 that I read about a guy that I think like 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.269
 to say but the game and they are more things 

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:02.460
 and saw these new cars as they are all 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:05.129
 the cars that are in the dlc as they have 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.049
 been the others with output then that 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.700
 what seems to me quite amazing 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.260
 and how can you see all the files 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.909
 hidden from the game so many things like 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.250
 before I had taught them what for 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.650
 flamethrower and look here is what goes 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.619
 doing the yacht what jet pack that 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.390
 is the item that jetpack gadget then 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.700
 here a new possibility that in him 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.229
 l are going to put a jetpack apart from 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.000
 what is called flight school 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.280
 they can fit what the 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.590
 jetpack because it is something that has to do 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.200
 with flying and it might be the one that trevor 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.479
 go to use and he will teach you to fly it 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.210
 give you a little tutorial on how 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.430
 use it and more things not then it's something 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.020
 that seems pretty good to me and I told them 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.150
 several little things then you follow me 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.670
 on twitter in the description I'll leave you 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:50.479
 the guy who posted everything that the 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.409
 I really find it a bit unreliable because 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:54.090
 because I've seen that he's with some 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.009
 american youtubers of grand theft auto 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.960
 5 and 1000 here as you see are the 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.780
 drug trafficking like dovena says cocaine 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.390
 heroin marijuana mentafetamine and money 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:08.759
 then it is in multiplayer spec item 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:10.590
 how this is like an object speculum or 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.450
 something like that I do not know very well those words of 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.280
 English but from what I see, they all come out 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.570
 these drugs and other things that the truth 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.610
 the game would be pretty good 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:20.190
 imagine that they asked you to traffic 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.560
 drugs or like the chinatown wars of that 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.910
 you decide to buy drugs and go with another 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.959
 trafficker on the avenue is more expensive and 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.030
 well that 's a little more money 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:28.250
 then he comes with the possibility I 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.719
 I remember 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.280
 and the truth was that something that was left 

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:34.290
 pretty good then for which 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.180
 have the doubt on twitter I will leave you 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.739
 the 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.299
 in the description is to leave what 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:40.069
 doing the twitter of this show for 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:41.239
 that you are going to see it and if you 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:43.730
 they ask what are they looking at in the background 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:45.290
 are watching in the background a gameplay of what 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.810
 that is doing the story mode that I 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.790
 I started playing with franklin and a day ago 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.099
 I think and this is what came out I was not 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.810
 playing with a car look here is the 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:55.189
 another tweet that told them that this was in 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.079
 a tweet that I saw that he was sent to believe 

00:02:55.189 --> 00:03:00.049
 you have to visit and that the one who knows him 

00:02:57.079 --> 00:03:02.540
 is a youtube and English that arise in the 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:05.359
 point 5 look says three-story garage 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.769
 marine hangars heliports and more things 

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:08.629
 that they come to great auto line 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:10.310
 then you tell me what do you think 

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:12.200
 all this information what hopes 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.540
 you have the truth I have 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.220
 enough hope in a dlc but not 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.470
 so much in that tlc that you think that 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.000
 it's the jet pack to me what I most 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.079
 love are the zombies so I think 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.060
 that the zombies are pretty 

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:25.190
