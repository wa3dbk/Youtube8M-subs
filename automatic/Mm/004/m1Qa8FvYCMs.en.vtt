00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.700
 I get a lot of accidents again, so this Gapachi 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:16.139
 What tojeong yijiham Seo Gyeong-deok these young intellectuals of the pack to move the Joseon era 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.789
 It is full. 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:23.850
 So how does this world and these three g 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:27.150
 And how the lives of women are related g 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:32.550
 I can see through all these things. 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:36.840
 Of course , because this Gwang-gwon comes out, there will be a mediocre and a public figure. 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:42.570
 So now the court can also buy dutiful 1 or 4 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:47.550
 Comes to the door jeongran context and define another character appeared in the tea lady 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:48.360
 So the episode out there is far more extravagant than anything else on TV 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:54.210
 It's 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:54.809
 So , it is difficult for us to get the details of the historical drama on TV 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:01.800
 same 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:05.880
 Because in this emotional and moral sense modern people are much more timid. 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:09.460
 Yeah, so now it's very exciting to taste this. 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:13.840
 Now here comes the Hwang Jin-yi. 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:19.450
 But Hwang Jin-yi's appearance probably could not have seen anywhere. 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:21.100
 Hwang Jin-yi is the second-stage philosopher of Seo Kyung-duk of Seo Kyung- duk . 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:28.000
 Come out as a homemaker. 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:33.400
 It appears as though it is laid-up. 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:39.070
 For example, whether it should belong where your direct reports check book 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:43.540
 Yes, so much so that we know generally stereotypes and very 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:48.820
 There are a lot of different characters 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:54.010
 Now then, this is now the first and worry about his friend, seven heads 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:02:00.790
 Later, I went into the clean room, and I became 7 2nd generation. 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:02:05.920
 Worried that joining the base oil seal now view these friends are now brotherhood 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:07.570
 I have lived together since I was a child. How can I grow up together ? 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:14.130
 Because I lived at home 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:15.970
 This makes Apache so that now its value fall short in Seoul Hyehwamun God 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:20.890
 He's the maker. 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:27.370
 It's not just about making things crazy , 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:28.600
 Who together did the endlessly twisting So now Joe stressed that even friends every night 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:34.330
 To come 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:36.670
 At home, I now have some cracks at home, 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:43.900
 I was growing up. 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:44.660
 Griseth meets the brotherhood first, and now I am very angry with friendship and righteousness 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:50.630
 uh 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:51.350
 I decided to do this and later I tear myself apart and then meet again. 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:57.470
 It's possible 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:03:02.150
 So the guys went negative material heeojyeoseo each other or something sulfur cheonwangbong 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:03.110
 Now other boats rotting meet dwaeseo seven of these 72 commands are my friends 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:08.060
 It was. 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:14.690
 Yeah, so from the beginning so as to meet the Taoyuan City solved without our town 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:17.420
 It's not like this, but suddenly I'm living hard while keeping my self-esteem. 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:24.650
 I met this way for the length. 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:26.960
 4 But now Well, where I'm a child that, from now on, important in modern 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:29.620
 I thought it was point 

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:33.220
 It's a pauper. 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:37.180
 So it's not important to be first, but it 's important 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:43.420
 So there was this in the Chosun Dynasty. 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:49.239
 It is more than that, 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:50.610
 Now the rest of Novi gag something so under the second minute other untouchables 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:56.110
 It is now. 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:58.750
 It's a long , butcher's but the rest is not a butcher . 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:03.790
 It's just a guy, u loser 9 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:05.850
 There are also shopkeepers and a variety of different people now 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:09.600
 there is 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:13.890
 Cushion Now here's what's out there 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:19.049
 And then we think about it. 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:22.650
 I do not want you to be a money-taker. 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:27.390
 You let me see the past . 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:34.050
 Or do you have a bigger symbiotic work and guess the riches? 

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:40.140
 I will buy a lot of non-pairs and become a landlord. I have to have this desire. 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:42.900
 There was no desire for this kind of settler 

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:50.400
 I have no desire for the job itself. 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:53.070
 5 So now I mean to go and held feretory now I've been doing another one newspaper 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:58.330
 If you know something, you're a man. 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:05:02.500
 Say it like this. 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:08.889
 I'm just playing with my nose. 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:09.789
 So stupidly now, now how can he now eat 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:12.570
 It is a butcher . 

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:17.250
 That's how it is now . 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:22.259
 So this guy just come and play men 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:23.550
 This is too loud, but it's not what I did in my youth , 

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:26.139
 To 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:28.780
 Even when I have a wife 

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:34.810
 How do you blow her? 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:38.950
 And it's too warm in the house so much that even the wife can not look stressed 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:43.419
 Why do not you talk to me about something like this. 

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:46.930
 So now our era is too hard on the shoulder of music, 

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:52.360
 I 'm just going to be fired until I 'm finished. 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:56.080
 I do not have anything to do with my ears at home 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:06:00.040
 But here , 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:05.230
 My family can not describe it. 

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:08.500
 This is why we think something is wrong. 

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:12.910
 For one that geureongeogo 

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:18.700
 I do not have a desire for that job . 

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:21.220
 Or naeseun the wall and shot jomiseon character but rather it 

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:25.780
 I studied 2 

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:31.270
 The penis is actually a person who plays . 

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:35.229
 Having told you said no jobs will be careful sliced moment with a professional scholar 

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:40.000
 In the Greek age, however , 

00:06:35.229 --> 00:06:44.590
 There were free men and slaves, but slaves were full-time workers. 

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:48.170
 Someone to say laundry. Served only with arrogance. 

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:53.480
 People do not have the free profession 

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:56.060
 So now, if we study a lot , this view of life is different. 

00:06:53.480 --> 00:07:03.080
 It's better to eat meat. 

00:06:56.060 --> 00:07:05.750
 Oh yeah, so I keep doing this as a freelance interest simultaneous 

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:10.970
 I keep getting that assurance through . 

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:13.970
 Or more and 1 trillion in salty ah Joseon Dynasty since Greek times to something like this now 

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:19.850
 Studying your vision. 

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:24.800
 This was a free man, so the philosophy of the Greeks Oh it's just the weeping 

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:28.790
 Because there are two days that free men do. I have no job. What rapnikka 

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:32.780
 We come out of the square and hold people and talk. 

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:36.560
 We do special chickens. Socrates does it that way. 

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:41.720
 I torture until I say I do not know. 

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:47.709
 That 's the kiss of continuing. Yeah. Diogenes. 

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:52.479
 It is famous that you find someone who really loves philosophy in the square. 

00:07:47.709 --> 00:07:53.649
 So it's free, so there's no job that philosophy is possible. 

00:07:52.479 --> 00:07:59.709
 It is. 

00:07:53.649 --> 00:08:03.189
 A philosophy of living a life that is a regular expression, only the money issue can not be reduced geolro 

00:07:59.709 --> 00:08:09.239
 Baby, we have to secure this free space somehow. 

00:08:03.189 --> 00:08:13.949
 Yes, that's the way I really care about my life now . 

00:08:09.239 --> 00:08:13.949
 This desire can be natural.
