all these interesting conversations bars

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:09.729 
all these interesting conversations bars
bars<00:03:08.480> would<00:03:08.690> also<00:03:08.840> be<00:03:09.109> better<00:03:09.290> to<00:03:09.500> I<00:03:09.650> think

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:09.739

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:36.610 
avoid at all costs like constantly to
like<00:03:35.209> probably<00:03:35.450> to<00:03:35.630> a<00:03:35.660> fault<00:03:35.750> and<00:03:36.290> so<00:03:36.470> that'd

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
like probably to a fault and so that'd

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:37.839 
like probably to a fault and so that'd
be<00:03:36.739> really<00:03:36.859> great<00:03:36.950> if<00:03:37.130> like<00:03:37.370> I<00:03:37.459> didn't<00:03:37.639> have<00:03:37.669> to

00:03:37.839 --> 00:03:37.849 
be really great if like I didn't have to

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:39.970 
be really great if like I didn't have to
worry<00:03:38.000> about<00:03:38.120> it<00:03:38.329> so<00:03:38.480> much<00:03:38.510> I<00:03:38.750> could<00:03:38.900> just<00:03:39.049> get

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980 
worry about it so much I could just get

worry about it so much I could just get
a<00:03:40.010> help<00:03:40.220> yeah<00:03:40.639> exactly<00:03:40.760> they<00:03:41.209> probably<00:03:41.389> cost<00:03:41.660> a

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
a help yeah exactly they probably cost a

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:42.849 
a help yeah exactly they probably cost a
lot<00:03:41.930> though<00:03:42.139> and<00:03:42.290> insurance<00:03:42.620> wouldn't<00:03:42.769> cover

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
annoying but I like the idea of like I

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:30.960 
annoying but I like the idea of like I
know<00:04:28.930> it's<00:04:29.080> not<00:04:29.290> for<00:04:29.500> them<00:04:29.620> feeling<00:04:30.610> great<00:04:30.760> for

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.120 
term um but like I like the idea of

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:35.670 
term um but like I like the idea of
being<00:04:34.180> able<00:04:34.330> to<00:04:34.510> do<00:04:34.600> a<00:04:34.630> certain<00:04:34.900> thing<00:04:35.050> and<00:04:35.530> you

but I assume that if you like work
towards<00:05:02.140> goal<00:05:02.440> then<00:05:02.710> you<00:05:02.860> get<00:05:03.070> it<00:05:03.250> going

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:03.460 
towards goal then you get it going

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.280 
towards goal then you get it going
towards<00:05:04.000> the<00:05:04.060> next<00:05:04.270> goal<00:05:04.450> we're<00:05:04.630> in<00:05:04.750> life<00:05:04.990> like

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:05.290 
towards the next goal we're in life like

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:06.510 
towards the next goal we're in life like
sometimes<00:05:05.710> it<00:05:05.800> doesn't<00:05:06.040> always<00:05:06.070> work<00:05:06.250> out

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:06.520 
sometimes it doesn't always work out

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.460 
sometimes it doesn't always work out
that<00:05:06.580> way<00:05:06.910> sometimes<00:05:07.300> thrown<00:05:07.720> curveballs<00:05:08.230> and

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:08.470 
that way sometimes thrown curveballs and

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:11.070 
that way sometimes thrown curveballs and
whatnot<00:05:08.890> um<00:05:09.460> and<00:05:09.970> maybe<00:05:10.000> if<00:05:10.600> you<00:05:10.720> work<00:05:10.900> really

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.080 
whatnot um and maybe if you work really

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:12.030 
whatnot um and maybe if you work really
hard<00:05:11.169> you<00:05:11.380> still<00:05:11.560> don't<00:05:11.680> get<00:05:11.770> what<00:05:11.890> you're

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:12.040

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:11.080 
not your computer um let's see oh god

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:12.540 
not your computer um let's see oh god
there's<00:06:11.290> so<00:06:11.500> there's<00:06:11.530> a<00:06:12.100> million<00:06:12.400> different

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:12.550 
there's so there's a million different

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:13.860 
there's so there's a million different
ways<00:06:12.850> that<00:06:12.970> this<00:06:13.300> would<00:06:13.450> work<00:06:13.570> out<00:06:13.690> i<00:06:13.750> think

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:13.870 
ways that this would work out i think

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:15.450 
ways that this would work out i think
the<00:06:14.050> faction<00:06:14.470> thing<00:06:14.650> is<00:06:14.800> definitely<00:06:15.280> pretty

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:15.460 
the faction thing is definitely pretty

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:17.430 
the faction thing is definitely pretty
cool<00:06:15.790> i<00:06:16.060> mean<00:06:16.360> the<00:06:16.479> idea<00:06:16.600> that<00:06:16.840> like<00:06:17.140> in<00:06:17.350> a

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:17.440 
cool i mean the idea that like in a

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:19.800 
cool i mean the idea that like in a
video<00:06:17.710> game<00:06:17.770> everything<00:06:18.640> is<00:06:18.790> about<00:06:18.940> you<00:06:19.120> like

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:19.810 
video game everything is about you like

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:21.270 
video game everything is about you like
you<00:06:19.930> don't<00:06:20.020> play<00:06:20.320> as<00:06:20.440> a<00:06:20.500> video<00:06:20.620> game<00:06:20.860> is<00:06:21.039> one<00:06:21.220> of

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:21.280 
you don't play as a video game is one of

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:23.550 
you don't play as a video game is one of
the<00:06:21.510> background<00:06:22.510> characters<00:06:23.140> or<00:06:23.260> something

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:23.560 
the background characters or something

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:25.200 
the background characters or something
but<00:06:24.070> in<00:06:24.220> life<00:06:24.430> that's<00:06:24.669> the<00:06:25.030> way

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:25.210 
but in life that's the way

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:27.870 
but in life that's the way
for<00:06:25.449> a<00:06:25.479> lot<00:06:25.539> of<00:06:25.600> people<00:06:25.690> through<00:06:26.199> sad<00:06:26.880> okay

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:27.880

that's better anyway um I mean obviously

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:32.129 
that's better anyway um I mean obviously
the<00:06:30.639> idea<00:06:30.910> that<00:06:30.970> if<00:06:31.180> you<00:06:31.270> die<00:06:31.509> you<00:06:31.539> can<00:06:32.110> have
