00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:06.930
 hello and welcome tsum 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:09.179
 motivational kick for riders on Mondays 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.550
 and rider my name is stephanie 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.490
 Apartment and I am for the instructor 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.260
 and teacher and this week have 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.750
 I brought the exercise with you 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.439
 help will continue to shoulder here 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.470
 to have 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.720
 to help you keep a close contact to 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.670
 to keep horses tomorrow which I like very much 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.570
 much they travel on my're so after 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.340
 the shoulders and shoulders are rolled 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.989
 those riding with such shoulders are there 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.930
 mostly relatively unhappy about it 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.760
 that it is incredibly difficult for example 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.829
 little movement in step and gallop too 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.410
 follow when the shoulders forward 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:47.090
 rolled yes then come the elbows 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:49.710
 get out of here and just make it too stiff 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:52.379
 It's not that easy from the position 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.899
 to get out of the case of ford too because 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.820
 you usually when you 're riding 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.910
 maybe the whole day maybe from 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.010
 Computer is sitting or behind the steering wheel and 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:06.060
 but there is a great exercise you 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:08.280
 can really help and that is one 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.400
 Art massage combined with one 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:14.340
 visualization and to this position 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:18.000
 you have to remember there is mostly here 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:20.520
 front of the large breast muscle to tense 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.380
 allow up the shoulders so 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:27.420
 quite open and of course fall and if 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.130
 This muscle fiber is very strong when he 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.590
 first is shortened and then stays 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.329
 mostly in position a good one 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.710
 Message is the muscle is relative 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.930
 easy to find 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.070
 so if you raise the arm bit and 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.259
 here with the fingers under the 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.420
 AchselhÃ¶hle is what's going on here 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:45.810
 get access this is the effect 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:49.220
 oral of the breast muscle and for example 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:52.530
 an exercise can help you and indeed 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:54.899
 gently pressed together and provides 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.000
 you is floated before the muscles of 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:00.659
 So everything pushes out of this sponge 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.930
 get out the water for example and if he does 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:07.300
 very slowly and gently again 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:14.740
 Imagine that there fresh nice 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:17.740
 water pure as a press he presses that 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:20.620
 water out and then you stop 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:23.830
 he lives a bit and then very slowly 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:26.590
 go back and introduce yourself to fresh 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:29.860
 clear water in the muscle again rhine 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:32.560
 you can flow your arm and you can do that too 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.910
 move a bit so gently 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.120
 so do not squeeze 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:39.070
 So press then imagine 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.650
 like the water from the swarm 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:46.780
 being pushed out will hold up a bit 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:49.330
 after that and slowly we therefore still 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:52.330
 Press twice to imagine how the 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:55.660
 water out reads the position 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:58.420
 Keep a little bit and very slowly 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:03.690
 after reading one could imagine the fresh one 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:06.010
 Water sponge feels fine 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.709
 little simple exercises can really help you 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.690
 help that shoulders here 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:13.239
 can open again and make it easier for you 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:17.799
 the nick move of the horse falls in the 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:20.489
 step and especially gallop up until 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:20.489
 next time
