 I greet everyone with you lech and this 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.750
 fourth series of the most fun and 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:22.380
 comic moments of world of tanks 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.800
 and we began to look like a player more beautiful than 20 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.070
 the yard 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:29.520
 on t37 the zigfried line is shining on the map 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.739
 he chooses a breakthrough tactic on the flank but 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:34.800
 at the time understands that his manner 

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:38.010
 uncovered and trying to hide behind concrete 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.710
 strengthening already felt in 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.890
 security he began to look around but 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.320
 here the enemy applies the newest 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:50.550
 technology and here so unknown force 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:53.010
 throws almost a hundred meters weapon 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:01:02.249
 so strong that right there 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:01:04.170
 destroyed it he did not exactly expect 

00:01:02.249 --> 00:01:06.600
 second moment we are again on the map 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.250
 lasville this map is just famous 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.040
 sniper hits 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.470
 but if in the previous series we saw 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.170
 single shot what can be attributed to 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.450
 good luck then now we see that player bruce 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.630
 76 on isu-152 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.880
 decided to prove to us that this is a failure attack 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.940
 mastery 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:29.790
 immediately three shots he makes 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:33.120
 half a kilometer away and all three 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:37.320
 hit the mark first 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:38.100
 enemy su su 101 in one he destroyed 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.980
 of 3 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.140
 well, as a logical ending hit 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:45.780
 waffenturger who also tried 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:50.670
 hide behind the carcasses of the murdered comrades 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.270
 but the exact shot found him in it 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.020
 moment 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:57.180
 corocut player on em 41 bulldogs decide 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.580
 outrun your slower 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:03.750
 Comrade but can not cope with the management 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:06.540
 and broadcasts to the house yes of course there is 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:09.300
 gate but was it worth it to call in 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:12.390
 more that exit from there he already find so 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.900
 and could not but we saw armed 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:18.409
 cannon house 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:21.739
 and in this episode the player Oleg Beach like this 

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:25.849
 nick took a position for shooting and charged 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:28.159
 super powerful shells however recoil from 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:32.659
 them so much that it unfolds 

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:35.299
 47 tons of metal 180 degrees offensive 

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:37.239
 that despite the full power of the projectile shot 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:40.400
 ricocheted from falling 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:43.939
 well and lastly we are fed 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:47.209
 controls the player with the nickname tr3 j &amp; d 

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:50.090
 score 10 9 and our hero decides to stand on 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:53.000
 capture on capture he is one and you have to stand 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:55.340
 more than a minute during this time opponents 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.909
 decide that this is not in their plans and 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:02.269
 comes to punish faces 

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:05.840
 by 1111 are to capture the remaining 15 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:08.599
 seconds and then he sees in too arrived no 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:11.810
 these are not some pathetic fireflies of level 4 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:15.019
 these are Soviet tyazh kv-1 with and 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:19.250
 from any of them easily punches 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:23.090
 our invader but first shoots from 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:25.040
 and ricochet last second shot 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:28.790
 kvass and ricochet again 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:31.280
 inscription base captured already appeared but 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:34.489
 of still trying to knock down a grab ram 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:39.230
 side but still go but the train had already left 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:41.299
