so to do this you will just need some

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:48.180 
so to do this you will just need some
gel<00:00:44.550> this<00:00:45.550> nothing<00:00:45.910> was<00:00:46.390> like<00:00:46.980> created<00:00:47.980> by

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:48.190 
gel this nothing was like created by

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.639 
gel this nothing was like created by
Jonathan<00:00:48.670> torch<00:00:49.210> of<00:00:49.600> killing<00:00:50.140> her<00:00:50.230> solution

00:00:50.639 --> 00:00:50.649 
Jonathan torch of killing her solution

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:53.540 
Jonathan torch of killing her solution
so<00:00:50.890> he<00:00:51.100> just<00:00:51.309> don't<00:00:51.730> like<00:00:51.879> curl<00:00:52.750> keep<00:00:53.050> your<00:00:53.230> yo

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
so he just don't like curl keep your yo

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.880 
so he just don't like curl keep your yo
but<00:00:54.550> it's<00:00:55.359> rather<00:00:55.510> expensive<00:00:55.780> so<00:00:56.260> Anthony<00:00:56.440> is

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:56.890 
but it's rather expensive so Anthony is

things<00:02:59.480> are<00:02:59.660> here

00:03:13.869 --> 00:03:13.879 

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:15.580 

those<00:03:14.390> are<00:03:14.569> so<00:03:14.719> short<00:03:14.959> of<00:03:15.079> them<00:03:15.230> with<00:03:15.439> the

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
those are so short of them with the

those are so short of them with the
natural<00:03:16.129> appearance<00:03:16.760> of<00:03:17.120> this<00:03:17.329> by<00:03:17.540> binaries

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:18.079 
natural appearance of this by binaries

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:31.370 
natural appearance of this by binaries
coming<00:03:18.500> this<00:03:18.739> way

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:42.670 

the<00:03:32.190> son

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.890 

maybe<00:03:43.370> come<00:03:43.670> let's<00:03:44.060> go<00:03:44.239> channel<00:03:44.720> we're<00:03:44.870> going

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
maybe come let's go channel we're going

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.890 
maybe come let's go channel we're going
to<00:03:45.290> make<00:03:45.409> them<00:03:45.590> look<00:03:45.709> Lois<00:03:46.220> true<00:03:47.120> really

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
to make them look Lois true really

that's it

00:03:52.900 --> 00:04:05.680 
that's it
so<00:03:54.280> once<00:03:55.280> they<00:03:55.430> do<00:03:55.489> this<00:03:55.760> to<00:03:55.970> pull<00:03:56.209> me<00:03:59.709> down<00:04:04.690> and

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:05.690 
so once they do this to pull me down and

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:08.500 
so once they do this to pull me down and
then<00:04:06.250> do<00:04:07.250> all<00:04:07.280> the<00:04:07.549> nice<00:04:07.730> colors<00:04:08.090> it's<00:04:08.390> gonna

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
then do all the nice colors it's gonna

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:11.319 
then do all the nice colors it's gonna
form<00:04:08.840> nicely<00:04:09.579> this<00:04:10.579> is<00:04:10.730> sort<00:04:10.909> of<00:04:10.970> just<00:04:11.180> a

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:11.329 
form nicely this is sort of just a

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:13.569 
form nicely this is sort of just a
foolproof<00:04:11.599> way<00:04:12.019> to<00:04:12.290> define<00:04:12.799> some<00:04:13.280> of<00:04:13.310> your

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:13.579 
foolproof way to define some of your

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:23.710 
foolproof way to define some of your
problems<00:04:21.100> like<00:04:22.100> this<00:04:22.370> I<00:04:22.669> like<00:04:23.030> skip<00:04:23.330> growing

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 
problems like this I like skip growing

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:28.110 
problems like this I like skip growing
so<00:04:24.020> much<00:04:24.199> that<00:04:24.560> I<00:04:24.590> do<00:04:24.800> it<00:04:25.100> every<00:04:25.760> single<00:04:25.880> day<00:04:26.210> so

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 
so much that I do it every single day so

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:42.870 
so much that I do it every single day so
it's<00:04:29.120> good

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:49.140 

is<00:04:43.880> you<00:04:44.300> paid<00:04:44.540> out

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.150 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.129 

take<00:04:50.150> your<00:04:50.479> shoes<00:04:50.750> off

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:51.139
