00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.250
 what is the last to look like the 

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:05.839
 last training agreement owner what 

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:07.700
 to decide the technical team team 

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:09.530
 to play in Buenos Aires before leaving 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.290
 they go to catamarca and then they have a 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:13.910
 party more friendly outside good 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:15.590
 we enjoy the players 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.749
 they like this field the players 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:20.539
 They wanted to be fired in Buenos Aires 

00:00:17.749 --> 00:00:23.539
 in this court so it's a night that 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:27.409
 not every night we use light 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:29.480
 artificial is good this good is a 

00:00:27.409 --> 00:00:31.039
 place that is the one that deserves the farewell 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:34.070
 go they go to the world that 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:35.629
 we enjoyed a nice game they came out 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.160
 many things that we deliver 

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:39.320
 obviously there are things to improve but 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.789
 It was a nice attractive party for me 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.309
 it was amazing to play on the court 

00:00:40.789 --> 00:00:44.390
 where I debuted first and now as a boy 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:46.850
 never throw away more to play with what 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.590
 almost a dream is fulfilled and what 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.910
 can get very very cute is very cute 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.190
 the club and nothing the truth 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.960
 well for the cougars all this all 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.150
 movement that are doing all the 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:59.480
 people exchange the truth that I like 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:01.840
 that this team was good was 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:05.059
 pretty compact they played well I think that 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:07.520
 they are preparing well it is a match 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:10.400
 preparatory so neither is much 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:13.340
 to reduce so nothing was good 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.900
 fun and I think I study what 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.550
 it came was the first game after 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.990
 the pensacola preparation and it's 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:20.930
 weeks training here in buenos aires 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:23.060
 so it was a good step and continue 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.100
 training and thinking in South Africa well 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.030
 the group is fine is killing 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.640
 training all of them 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.200
 workouts I'm a quiet and 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.990
 confident that things are 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.310
 doing public good very literally 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.720
 the environment and a little bit of time 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.910
 quieter for and then started to 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.410
 Slowly and use the time that the entrance 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:41.780
 of google and more intense he lives and that the 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:43.640
 rebién not well liked game I could 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.590
 come and see it so good recontenta 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.649
 I liked that they won so nothing 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.750
 very well the truth that excellent look 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:52.220
 very good game well I think it 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.240
 they understand a lot they are getting ready and 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.830
 how important they are getting to know each other 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.690
 among them 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.240
 I hate to put them together that I was playing and 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.980
 the old ones as they say they liked me 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.690
 same view that when we did them the 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.760
 We did not go along with the players 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:07.490
 of the cougars we put there were players that 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:09.080
 pucará not come then you 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.390
 We used to say what's called the cup then 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.910
 reluctantly they said the cup was 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.560
 San Isidro called capital of lightning but 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.420
 it's actually something shared by all 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.280
 the Argentines the players the 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.580
 semifinals of the city that is the most 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.250
 important in terms of tournaments is 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.930
 play here 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.880
 the next four years we have 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.860
 contract to be able to continue when here 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.110
 so much to guard in this case to 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.210
 the pumas players are interested in us 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.920
 and we thank you for the fact that 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:38.170
 I liked that the farewell was here 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:41.290
 we are looking forward to play against 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:45.010
 a French club gives us a very good 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:46.810
 measure and also good you can always 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.100
 keep improving and adjusting will not 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.550
 forget that some of the players 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.550
 they come from outside
