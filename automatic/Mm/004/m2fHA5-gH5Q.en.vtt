00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
we are going to start to another vision

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.880 
we are going to start to another vision
from<00:00:23.010> ear<00:00:23.340> to<00:00:23.369> ear<00:00:23.779> on<00:00:24.779> this<00:00:25.109> side<00:00:25.410> will<00:00:25.680> be<00:00:25.710> the

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
from ear to ear on this side will be the

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.519 
from ear to ear on this side will be the
end<00:00:26.250> of<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.519> braid<00:00:26.760> so<00:00:27.090> we're<00:00:27.810> going<00:00:28.080> to<00:00:28.230> the

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
end of the braid so we're going to the

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:34.270 
end of the braid so we're going to the
vision<00:00:29.039> as<00:00:29.189> well<00:00:29.400> in<00:00:29.580> here<00:00:30.060> right<00:00:30.660> on<00:00:30.689> the<00:00:31.080> head

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:36.979 

now<00:02:34.439> we<00:02:34.500> can<00:02:35.040> take<00:02:35.340> off<00:02:35.580> the<00:02:35.610> regular<00:02:36.269> band<00:02:36.540> and

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
now we can take off the regular band and

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:38.920 
now we can take off the regular band and
there<00:02:37.920> you<00:02:38.129> go

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930

the revision all you have to list fold a
little<00:02:47.760> bit<00:02:47.970> just<00:02:48.720> from<00:02:49.200> the<00:02:49.440> side<00:02:49.829> of<00:02:49.860> the

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
little bit just from the side of the

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:59.330 
little bit just from the side of the
break<00:02:50.459> and<00:02:51.560> it<00:02:52.560> will<00:02:52.769> be<00:02:52.920> perfect<00:02:53.430> for<00:02:58.340> the

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
break and it will be perfect for the

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.610 
break and it will be perfect for the
second<00:02:59.760> option<00:02:59.909> we're<00:03:00.450> going<00:03:00.720> to<00:03:00.870> start<00:03:01.260> doing

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
second option we're going to start doing

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.280 
second option we're going to start doing
the<00:03:01.980> same<00:03:02.220> division<00:03:02.670> with<00:03:03.329> eating<00:03:03.810> the<00:03:03.989> first

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
the same division with eating the first

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.759 
the same division with eating the first
option<00:03:05.040> and<00:03:05.780> now<00:03:06.780> we're<00:03:07.109> going<00:03:07.319> to<00:03:07.409> take<00:03:07.739> a

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
option and now we're going to take a

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:10.629 
option and now we're going to take a
small<00:03:08.280> piece<00:03:08.519> of<00:03:08.579> hair<00:03:09.090> to<00:03:09.150> start<00:03:09.720> braiding

split<00:03:11.639> it<00:03:11.760> into<00:03:11.940> three<00:03:12.359> equal<00:03:12.389> sections<00:03:13.019> and

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
split it into three equal sections and

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.910 
split it into three equal sections and

perfect when we are here we're going to

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.099 
perfect when we are here we're going to
keep<00:04:17.229> break-in<00:04:17.699> but<00:04:18.699> we<00:04:19.000> are<00:04:19.299> going<00:04:19.720> to<00:04:19.930> add

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.109 
keep break-in but we are going to add

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:22.710 
keep break-in but we are going to add

it's<00:04:23.410> a<00:04:23.770> little<00:04:24.250> bit<00:04:24.430> different<00:04:25.000> from<00:04:25.270> the

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
it's a little bit different from the

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:29.070 
it's a little bit different from the
first<00:04:25.870> option<00:04:26.970> so<00:04:27.970> we're<00:04:28.330> going<00:04:28.570> to<00:04:28.690> cross

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
first option so we're going to cross

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:33.029 
first option so we're going to cross
