okay thank you you're some things I

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.160 
okay thank you you're some things I
invented<00:02:42.640> over<00:02:42.790> the<00:02:42.970> years<00:02:43.150> that<00:02:43.330> didn't

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
invented over the years that didn't

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.680 
invented over the years that didn't
quite<00:02:44.320> catch<00:02:44.620> on<00:02:44.830> this<00:02:45.400> is<00:02:45.790> a<00:02:45.850> light<00:02:46.300> bulb<00:02:46.540> that

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
quite catch on this is a light bulb that

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:47.850 
quite catch on this is a light bulb that
subtracts<00:02:47.470> like

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
subtracts like

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:49.110 
subtracts like
it<00:02:47.980> could<00:02:48.100> never<00:02:48.280> really<00:02:48.460> figure<00:02:48.820> out<00:02:48.880> how<00:02:49.060> to

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
it could never really figure out how to

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.850 
it could never really figure out how to
make<00:02:49.300> it<00:02:49.480> though<00:02:49.660> this<00:02:50.230> is<00:02:50.440> just<00:02:50.530> a<00:02:50.650> normal

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
make it though this is just a normal

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.470 
make it though this is just a normal
light<00:02:51.100> bulb<00:02:51.310> so<00:02:51.760> what<00:02:51.850> else<00:02:51.970> invented<00:02:52.360> this

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
light bulb so what else invented this

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.780 
light bulb so what else invented this
