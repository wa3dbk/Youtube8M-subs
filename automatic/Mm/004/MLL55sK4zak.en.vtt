00:00:09.339 --> 00:00:12.339
 The more you use Galaxy s, the faster you'll hear it. 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:15.909
 It's part of Galaxy's system. 

00:00:15.909 --> 00:00:18.980
 Employees do not have a clear understanding and concept 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:19.890
 In state 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.319
 It's a lot of mistakes. 

00:00:22.319 --> 00:00:26.859
 First, the biggest reason for slowing down is Galaxy 's home 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.069
 After a lot of installs or after certain green 

00:00:31.069 --> 00:00:34.260
 If you are in conflict with the system, 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:37.640
 And that's because of species. 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.230
 There are related laws that can improve the speed of the genuine 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.340
 Let's take advantage of Galaxy's pure memory organizing function. 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.020
 Let's take good advantage of the system management business Firstly, 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.390
 Let's manage well 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:54.330
 Baek jae 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:57.860
 Do not install unnecessary restrictions on your home screen. 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.550
 If the pool is unstable, the battery consumption is 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:03.479
 Or faster 

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:06.530
 A fever can occur and a galaxy can become a bogey. 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.820
 Therefore, when you install the 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.580
 Rather than installing it all at once, 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.630
 After installation, check to see if the system crashes 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.280
 and. Jeju City has a habit 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.010
 Very good 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.659
 And if you study a lot of the mistakes of setting the presentation 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:29.259
 Galaxy is in sleep mode 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:32.260
 Because you are always performing those functions 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.780
 Unnecessary battery consumption occurs 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.780
 There are people who are slowing down. 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.860
 System management free is also a pure memory 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.480
 If you are only doing automatic or manual management, 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:49.149
 There was no problem. 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:52.229
 There are faces like governors who survive even if we organize them. 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.600
 These bloated faces 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.180
 I will take charge of the country and install it separately. 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.479
 Is there a way to manage it? 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:03.030
 From Samsung 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.710
 There will be a good company among the built-in upgrades 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:07.140
 If 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.799
 It is basically impossible by itself 

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:12.799
 Because I want to eat my hair, which is unnecessary. 

00:02:13.619 --> 00:02:17.379
 Samsung is somewhat of a surge in the number of developers 

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:22.159
 Dangerous tasks can make unnecessary applications 

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:25.159
 I'm deleting the upgrade. 

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:29.180
 After that, if you do the routine, you will get more comedy 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.999
 You can 

00:02:31.999 --> 00:02:35.409
 If you touch the bridge that you should not touch, 

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:36.560
 Bricks 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.009
 Spirituality also grows. 

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:42.929
 System management industry Greening order For sale property 

00:02:42.929 --> 00:02:45.929
 It is annoying itself 

00:02:45.929 --> 00:02:48.929
 Patches that you want at a faster rate than that 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.560
 Samsung provides conference developers 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.609
 Speed ​​patches. 

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:55.920
 So the original system 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.440
 I already made changes to the speed and feel 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.120
 Taxis 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.349
 Because it is not a patch provided by Samsung 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:08.530
 All the responsibility is always on me. 

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:11.169
 Speed ​​at the end of the discharge 

00:03:11.169 --> 00:03:14.759
 All the overlapping is the fatigue that was the person's 

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:16.249
 Do the layout 

00:03:16.249 --> 00:03:18.600
 Without accurate knowledge 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:19.970
 Follow him blindly 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:21.360
 Chin 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:22.799
 Are there injuries? 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:27.349
 This work also requires management and understanding. 

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:28.729
 That would mean. 

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:30.550
 Briefing The selection of various patches 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:35.070
 It is your freedom, but employees are 

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:36.650
 Exact 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.510
 It's about establishing understanding and concept. 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:40.389
 It's top priority. 

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:44.169
 Learn how to use this as a deployment and conceptualization of new and old 

00:03:44.749 --> 00:03:45.890
 Then 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:48.890
 I need to implement some more functionality 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:52.039
 You choose to make surge or pc work 

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:56.169
 How to use your Galaxy s more smarter 

00:03:56.169 --> 00:03:57.439
 I will. 

00:03:57.439 --> 00:04:01.709
 Through our site, you can play volleyball with basic concepts and 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:03.599
 Learn how to use it first 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:07.739
 Then you can use it according to your needs and choices. 

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:09.559
 Thank you.
