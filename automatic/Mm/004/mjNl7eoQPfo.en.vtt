00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
guess I well the first thing that caught

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.549 
guess I well the first thing that caught
had<00:00:58.829> said<00:00:59.010> to<00:00:59.039> me<00:00:59.160> when<00:00:59.550> they<00:00:59.940> asked<00:01:00.899> me<00:01:01.079> fall

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
had said to me when they asked me fall

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.189 
had said to me when they asked me fall
when<00:01:02.010> they<00:01:02.160> approved<00:01:03.090> me<00:01:03.329> as<00:01:03.480> their<00:01:03.660> top<00:01:03.930> five

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
when they approved me as their top five

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.469 
when they approved me as their top five
plays<00:01:04.500> commentator<00:01:05.100> was<00:01:05.850> that<00:01:06.060> they<00:01:06.420> were

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
plays commentator was that they were

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.039 
plays commentator was that they were
looking<00:01:06.750> for<00:01:06.930> quality<00:01:07.500> and<00:01:07.619> not<00:01:07.890> quantity<00:01:08.610> and

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:09.049 
looking for quality and not quantity and

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:11.270 
looking for quality and not quantity and
I<00:01:10.049> think<00:01:10.110> this<00:01:10.409> has<00:01:10.560> got<00:01:10.710> away<00:01:10.890> from<00:01:10.950> me<00:01:11.130> a

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
I think this has got away from me a

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.630 
I think this has got away from me a
little<00:01:11.460> bit<00:01:11.640> where<00:01:12.150> I've<00:01:13.080> been<00:01:13.530> doing<00:01:13.860> the

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
little bit where I've been doing the

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.780 
little bit where I've been doing the
commentated<00:01:15.380> commentating<00:01:16.430> common<00:01:17.430> tations

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
commentated commentating common tations

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.810 
commentated commentating common tations
I<00:01:18.060> don't<00:01:18.240> know<00:01:18.830> commentaries<00:01:19.830> that<00:01:20.100> is<00:01:20.700> the

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
I don't know commentaries that is the

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.030 
I don't know commentaries that is the
word<00:01:20.970> I<00:01:21.119> should<00:01:21.360> have<00:01:21.450> been<00:01:21.570> looking<00:01:21.810> for<00:01:22.040> on

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
word I should have been looking for on

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.760 
word I should have been looking for on
days<00:01:23.520> that<00:01:23.759> I<00:01:24.080> wasn't<00:01:25.080> really<00:01:25.380> in<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.530> mood

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
days that I wasn't really in the mood

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.280 
days that I wasn't really in the mood
and<00:01:26.159> it<00:01:27.090> was<00:01:27.210> kind<00:01:27.360> of<00:01:27.450> just<00:01:27.600> an<00:01:27.780> extra<00:01:28.110> thing

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
and it was kind of just an extra thing

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.410 
and it was kind of just an extra thing
so<00:01:28.619> I<00:01:28.650> think<00:01:28.770> you<00:01:28.979> guys<00:01:29.130> were<00:01:29.400> a<00:01:29.700> little<00:01:29.790> upset

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
so I think you guys were a little upset

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.960 
so I think you guys were a little upset
that<00:01:30.689> my<00:01:31.130> commentaries<00:01:32.130> weren't<00:01:32.490> up<00:01:32.670> to<00:01:32.939> par

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
that my commentaries weren't up to par

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.859 
that my commentaries weren't up to par
and<00:01:33.799> so<00:01:34.799> I<00:01:34.829> I<00:01:35.220> kind<00:01:35.790> of<00:01:35.850> rebelled<00:01:36.180> on<00:01:36.390> that<00:01:36.600> and

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
and so I I kind of rebelled on that and

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.980 
and so I I kind of rebelled on that and
I<00:01:37.229> did<00:01:37.530> one<00:01:37.740> with<00:01:37.770> my<00:01:38.100> friend<00:01:38.430> and<00:01:38.869> you<00:01:39.869> guys

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
I did one with my friend and you guys

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.539 
I did one with my friend and you guys
didn't<00:01:40.290> seem<00:01:40.439> to<00:01:40.590> take<00:01:40.619> to<00:01:40.890> that<00:01:41.040> either<00:01:41.189> so<00:01:41.520> I

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
didn't seem to take to that either so I

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.770 
didn't seem to take to that either so I
think<00:01:41.670> I<00:01:42.090> think<00:01:42.990> I<00:01:44.030> really<00:01:45.030> think<00:01:45.420> that<00:01:45.570> this

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
think I think I really think that this

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.130 
think I think I really think that this
community<00:01:46.439> is<00:01:46.470> a<00:01:46.590> great<00:01:47.159> community<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:48.140> so

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
community is a great community and so

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.350 
community is a great community and so
I'm<00:01:49.229> going<00:01:49.380> to<00:01:49.439> make<00:01:49.560> sure<00:01:49.740> that<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.159> next<00:01:50.369> top

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
I'm going to make sure that the next top

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.319 
I'm going to make sure that the next top
five<00:01:51.570> plays<00:01:51.899> week<00:01:52.680> 10<00:01:53.040> is<00:01:53.369> amazing<00:01:54.090> for<00:01:54.210> you

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
guys and but what I need is for you guys

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.780 
guys and but what I need is for you guys
to<00:01:57.960> send<00:01:58.170> in<00:01:58.259> your<00:01:58.290> clip<00:01:58.560> because<00:01:58.740> honestly<00:01:59.460> we

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
to send in your clip because honestly we

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.270 
to send in your clip because honestly we
got<00:02:00.000> for<00:02:00.840> submissions<00:02:01.439> this<00:02:01.710> week<00:02:01.950> and

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
got for submissions this week and

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.249 
got for submissions this week and
clearly<00:02:02.909> that<00:02:03.180> is<00:02:03.299> not<00:02:03.329> enough<00:02:03.750> for<00:02:03.780> a<00:02:04.049> top

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
clearly that is not enough for a top

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.679 
clearly that is not enough for a top
five<00:02:04.469> plays<00:02:04.770> so<00:02:05.390> hopefully<00:02:06.390> you<00:02:06.509> guys<00:02:06.630> can
