you think that they could do a little
better<00:00:56.699> than<00:00:56.879> 1200<00:00:57.780> because<00:00:57.930> that's<00:00:58.199> still

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
better than 1200 because that's still

fly<00:01:17.549> very<00:01:17.610> well<00:01:18.060> and<00:01:18.420> then<00:01:18.570> these<00:01:18.810> items<00:01:20.060> the

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
fly very well and then these items the

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.660 
fly very well and then these items the
these<00:01:21.450> are<00:01:21.600> $5<00:01:22.259> a<00:01:22.290> piece<00:01:22.590> I<00:01:22.920> don't<00:01:25.310> okay<00:01:26.310> all

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
right and then this is this is 30 so

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.280 
right and then this is this is 30 so
there'd<00:01:30.299> be<00:01:30.390> a<00:01:30.479> little<00:01:30.750> bit<00:01:30.900> of<00:01:31.049> movement

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290

giving<00:01:35.670> some<00:01:36.119> kind<00:01:36.360> of<00:01:36.390> a<00:01:36.479> discount<00:01:36.900> can<00:01:37.259> be

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
giving some kind of a discount can be

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:43.830 
giving some kind of a discount can be
10%<00:01:37.650> could<00:01:38.280> be<00:01:38.400> 20%<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:39.360> then<00:01:40.490> yep
