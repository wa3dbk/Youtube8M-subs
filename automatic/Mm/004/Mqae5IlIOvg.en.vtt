 [Music] 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:16.529
 hi friends youtube 2 here your friend with 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:20.070
 points 86 with a new tutorial in this 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:25.520
 new tutorial I'm going to show you 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:28.770
 how to install an aaron and configure it 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:33.350
 especially to accelerate what's coming 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:37.160
 being the buffer cache also the 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:40.399
 it helps us a lot so that it is not 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:43.430
 constantly loading the buffer of the 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:46.730
 catcher, I'm going to leave you a link 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:50.059
 download below the video so that it 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.840
 download the aaron I'm going to show you 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:55.130
 this 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.130
 how are they going to lower it 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.080
 Once you are in the link, this will 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.740
 see this 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:10.520
 they just have to this 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:13.970
 how is the promotion you only give 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:19.090
 loyal to the video and it will give you the code of 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:19.090
 security where are we going to enter here 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.300
 and he is going to leave you and he will give you the 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.200
 permission will give you the obligation to 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:30.320
 that you can download it is something that 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:32.920
 it comes from medium to medium fire is not something 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:36.540
 that I am doing it yes no 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.540
 it's on their part 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.750
 and once the file is downloaded it goes 

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:46.420
 to be this 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:49.240
 so they want to save them this they can 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:52.390
 to save in a folder like me 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.850
 had commented from the beginning this 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.900
 I have my own folder created where 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:01.010
 something I await each one of my 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:04.550
 repositories each of my hoops 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:06.200
 did not really occupy them this once 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:11.660
 that installed them but I also like 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:14.060
 keep them in case one day I have this 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.100
 problems with my code although it's 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:19.490
 installed x something thing that loses something 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:22.370
 something some information there I have it 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:24.230
 to be able to install it again and good 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.920
 this we are going to go to what has been 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:31.470
 code I will show you how 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.470
 and configure it practically 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:36.380
 and here in code since we are here in 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:39.670
 code 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:41.740
 let's go where it is 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.720
 system 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:45.510
 and in the system let's go where it says 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.030
 accessories 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.480
 or aarÃ³n depending on the language that 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.670
 have 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.690
 let's go where French was installed 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.850
 files 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.830
 let's find it where we have it to 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:03.180
 saved as this link 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:05.670
 in mine it depends on you that you have 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:08.310
 already as good here I have it only 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:12.569
 I give this 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:16.180
 ok once found and as in the part 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:19.930
 below shows us that it is already active 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:22.950
 once active we will go to what comes 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:26.099
 being programs 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:30.920
 and in the program we are going to give 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:35.030
 find the law is said and series are given 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:38.300
 and we will edit where they will be edited 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:40.700
 sedet to the aliens we are going to enter 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:44.270
 then where network network 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:47.959
 experience then again where is 

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:51.280
 network and this is where we are going to change 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:57.350
 this some things this where says cachet 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:04:01.819
 member to see if we're going to give you play let's go 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:04.790
 to remove this that is the uninhabited what 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:07.580
 let's put 0 let's click on 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:10.790
 fact will activate us 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:13.569
 and the second the third will be the network 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:17.829
 woofer factor 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:20.609
 we 're going to put it in 10 we remove this and 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:20.609
 we have 10 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.260
 here we come back 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:30.820
 [Music] 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:33.010
 how far is the interest 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:37.950
 and we're going to go to the bottom where 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:37.950
 is saved to war game show 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:45.820
 let's create this one a folder from 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:48.610
 far from the mx file 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:51.150
 below says file that the 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:51.150
 binder 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:05:00.700
 now we go back to where it is 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:05:02.830
 video and video add-ons and we're going to 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:05.560
 see here already 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:08.460
 overcome 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:12.750
 and as you can see here in the leds part 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:12.750
 enable will be the lists of 

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:20.270
 enabled series 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:20.270
 we already see the two we did 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:25.710
 this now 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:29.720
 only what needs to be done is 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:33.180
 and give me the main menu and restart your 

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:36.350
 your code to be only should come out 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:36.350
 if you are in a pc 

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:41.239
 so it gives you to reboot is going to perform 

00:05:37.939 --> 00:05:43.230
 your computer completes only 

00:05:41.239 --> 00:05:45.990
 go out 

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:52.470
 and this works is not practically in 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:56.570
 the android linux windows mac works on 

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:56.570
 all operating systems 

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:05.770
 once we leave that has been closed 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:07.690
 we will see it again 

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:09.360
 well this is all being friends 

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:11.520
