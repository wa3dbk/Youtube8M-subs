00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
alright let's go ahead and see what we

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.219 
alright let's go ahead and see what we
can<00:01:25.409> do<00:01:25.530> then<00:01:25.710> we<00:01:26.340> equipped<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.670> power<00:01:26.880> glove

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229 
can do then we equipped the power glove

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:29.780 
can do then we equipped the power glove
there<00:01:28.229> seems<00:01:28.590> to<00:01:28.680> these<00:01:28.890> be<00:01:29.280> these<00:01:29.460> blocks

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
there seems to these be these blocks

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.910 
there seems to these be these blocks
over<00:01:30.030> there<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.390> then<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.600> chest<00:01:30.960> is<00:01:31.140> here<00:01:31.500> so

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
over there and then the chest is here so

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.410 
over there and then the chest is here so
there's<00:01:32.189> something<00:01:32.579> going<00:01:32.820> on<00:01:32.909> here<00:01:32.970> but<00:01:33.299> I'm

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
there's something going on here but I'm

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.300 
there's something going on here but I'm
not<00:01:33.450> sure<00:01:33.659> I<00:01:34.079> think<00:01:34.710> we're<00:01:34.890> gonna<00:01:34.979> have<00:01:35.220> to

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
not sure I think we're gonna have to

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.670 
not sure I think we're gonna have to
pull<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.729> blocks<00:01:36.119> over<00:01:36.420> there<00:01:36.720> to<00:01:37.290> one<00:01:37.560> of

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
pull the blocks over there to one of

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.710 
pull the blocks over there to one of
these<00:01:37.770> locations<00:01:38.460> here<00:01:38.909> and<00:01:39.119> then<00:01:39.570> hopefully

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
these locations here and then hopefully

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.510 
these locations here and then hopefully
from<00:01:40.079> there<00:01:40.290> is<00:01:40.500> when<00:01:40.650> we'll<00:01:40.829> be<00:01:40.950> able<00:01:41.040> to<00:01:41.220> jump

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
from there is when we'll be able to jump

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.490 
from there is when we'll be able to jump
on<00:01:41.670> top<00:01:41.909> of<00:01:42.119> there<00:01:42.360> that's<00:01:42.869> what<00:01:43.079> I'm<00:01:43.200> thinking

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
on top of there that's what I'm thinking

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.560 
on top of there that's what I'm thinking
so<00:01:43.619> let's<00:01:43.799> just<00:01:43.920> go<00:01:43.950> ahead<00:01:44.040> and<00:01:44.220> do<00:01:44.399> that<00:01:44.570> yeah

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
so let's just go ahead and do that yeah

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:46.670 
so let's just go ahead and do that yeah
that<00:01:45.780> i'm<00:01:45.869> pretty<00:01:46.110> sure<00:01:46.200> it's<00:01:46.320> gonna<00:01:46.439> be<00:01:46.560> like

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
that i'm pretty sure it's gonna be like

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.289 
that i'm pretty sure it's gonna be like
two<00:01:46.890> blocks<00:01:47.100> or<00:01:47.310> something<00:01:47.549> maybe<00:01:47.670> even<00:01:47.970> one<00:01:48.270> i

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
two blocks or something maybe even one i

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:49.760 
two blocks or something maybe even one i
think<00:01:48.509> i'd<00:01:48.689> probably<00:01:48.840> do<00:01:49.020> it<00:01:49.049> with<00:01:49.170> one<00:01:49.229> I'm

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
think i'd probably do it with one I'm

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.020 
think i'd probably do it with one I'm
just<00:01:49.920> gonna<00:01:50.040> go<00:01:50.100> ahead<00:01:50.189> and<00:01:50.280> start<00:01:50.610> taking<00:01:50.759> one

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
just gonna go ahead and start taking one

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.100 
just gonna go ahead and start taking one
block<00:01:51.240> over<00:01:51.270> there<00:01:51.570> because<00:01:51.689> I'm<00:01:51.840> pretty<00:01:51.990> sure

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
block over there because I'm pretty sure

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.929 
block over there because I'm pretty sure
I'm<00:01:52.200> gonna<00:01:52.320> be<00:01:52.380> able<00:01:52.470> to<00:01:52.710> do<00:01:52.799> this<00:01:52.950> let's<00:01:53.820> just

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
I'm gonna be able to do this let's just

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.310 
I'm gonna be able to do this let's just
go<00:01:54.030> ahead<00:01:54.119> and<00:01:54.210> push<00:01:54.450> it<00:01:54.570> over<00:01:54.780> there<00:01:54.930> it's

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
go ahead and push it over there it's

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.780 
go ahead and push it over there it's
pretty<00:01:55.619> pretty<00:01:55.890> simple<00:01:56.310> once<00:01:56.430> you<00:01:56.460> get<00:01:56.640> the

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
pretty pretty simple once you get the

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.219 
pretty pretty simple once you get the
hand<00:01:56.969> of<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.060> power<00:01:57.210> glove<00:01:57.420> remember<00:01:57.869> control

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
hand of the power glove remember control

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.560 
hand of the power glove remember control
to<00:01:58.350> pull<00:01:58.530> it<00:01:58.710> if<00:01:59.460> you<00:01:59.640> just<00:01:59.850> click<00:02:00.060> it<00:02:00.119> it'll

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
to pull it if you just click it it'll

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.389 
to pull it if you just click it it'll
automatically<00:02:01.320> just<00:02:01.590> push<00:02:01.829> it<00:02:01.860> so<00:02:02.189> it's

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
automatically just push it so it's

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.010 
automatically just push it so it's
pretty<00:02:02.579> simple<00:02:02.820> to<00:02:03.000> use<00:02:03.030> let's<00:02:03.570> climb<00:02:03.750> up<00:02:03.869> here

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
pretty simple to use let's climb up here

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.450 
pretty simple to use let's climb up here
I'm<00:02:04.170> i<00:02:04.320> think<00:02:04.560> i'm<00:02:04.619> gonna<00:02:04.740> be<00:02:04.799> able<00:02:04.920> to<00:02:05.130> make<00:02:05.250> it

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
I'm i think i'm gonna be able to make it

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.550 
I'm i think i'm gonna be able to make it
it's<00:02:05.610> not<00:02:05.759> that<00:02:05.939> bad<00:02:06.090> right<00:02:06.360> um<00:02:06.600> yeah<00:02:07.409> it's

have seen in the spear temple of ocarina

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.550 
have seen in the spear temple of ocarina
of<00:02:15.670> time<00:02:15.760> it<00:02:16.300> does<00:02:16.600> take<00:02:16.780> a<00:02:16.810> couple<00:02:17.080> tries<00:02:17.350> as

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
of time it does take a couple tries as

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.530 
of time it does take a couple tries as
you<00:02:17.650> guys<00:02:17.830> are<00:02:18.040> able<00:02:18.460> to<00:02:18.550> tell<00:02:18.730> here<00:02:18.940> because

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
you guys are able to tell here because

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.240 
you guys are able to tell here because
it<00:02:19.780> can<00:02:20.080> be<00:02:20.200> difficult<00:02:20.410> to<00:02:20.800> time<00:02:21.070> this

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
it can be difficult to time this

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.550 
it can be difficult to time this
perfectly<00:02:21.670> I<00:02:21.760> know<00:02:21.940> you<00:02:22.810> just<00:02:22.990> basically<00:02:23.200> have

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
perfectly I know you just basically have

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.590 
perfectly I know you just basically have
to<00:02:23.710> like<00:02:23.860> run<00:02:24.100> in<00:02:24.220> front<00:02:24.490> of<00:02:24.580> it<00:02:24.730> and<00:02:24.850> then<00:02:25.270> jump

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
to like run in front of it and then jump

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.630 
to like run in front of it and then jump
off<00:02:25.750> the<00:02:26.080> edge<00:02:26.260> at<00:02:26.500> the<00:02:26.530> perfect<00:02:26.830> time<00:02:27.280> to<00:02:27.520> be

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
off the edge at the perfect time to be

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.130 
off the edge at the perfect time to be
able<00:02:27.730> to<00:02:27.880> land<00:02:28.090> there<00:02:28.360> it<00:02:28.690> can<00:02:28.840> take<00:02:28.990> you<00:02:29.110> a

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
able to land there it can take you a

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.110 
able to land there it can take you a
couple<00:02:29.230> tries<00:02:29.680> as<00:02:29.860> you<00:02:30.100> can<00:02:30.250> see<00:02:30.520> but<00:02:30.850> you

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
couple tries as you can see but you

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.490 
couple tries as you can see but you
should<00:02:31.600> be<00:02:31.630> able<00:02:31.810> to<00:02:31.960> get<00:02:32.050> the<00:02:32.170> hang<00:02:32.260> of<00:02:32.410> it

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
should be able to get the hang of it

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.170 
should be able to get the hang of it
eventually<00:02:32.560> I<00:02:33.220> like<00:02:33.520> that<00:02:33.670> they<00:02:33.820> make<00:02:34.030> all

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
eventually I like that they make all

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.850 
eventually I like that they make all
these<00:02:34.300> things<00:02:34.630> that<00:02:34.840> are<00:02:34.930> pretty<00:02:35.170> tricky<00:02:35.650> in

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
these things that are pretty tricky in

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.470 
these things that are pretty tricky in
this<00:02:36.010> game<00:02:36.250> I<00:02:36.460> think<00:02:36.910> they're<00:02:37.000> pretty<00:02:37.180> cool<00:02:37.420> I

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
this game I think they're pretty cool I

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.810 
this game I think they're pretty cool I
think<00:02:37.630> they<00:02:37.900> do<00:02:37.960> a<00:02:38.050> nice<00:02:38.260> job<00:02:38.320> of<00:02:38.590> it<00:02:38.920> and<00:02:39.100> I'm

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560

long<00:03:11.740> and<00:03:12.010> I<00:03:12.070> was<00:03:12.280> hoping<00:03:12.640> it<00:03:12.790> wasn't<00:03:12.910> gonna

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
long and I was hoping it wasn't gonna

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.760 
long and I was hoping it wasn't gonna
take<00:03:13.270> this<00:03:13.390> long<00:03:13.600> but<00:03:13.780> wow<00:03:14.380> this<00:03:14.590> is

ridiculous this is like a minute of us
just<00:03:16.930> jumping<00:03:17.350> around<00:03:17.410> but<00:03:18.190> whatever<00:03:18.610> we'll

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
just jumping around but whatever we'll

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.060 
just jumping around but whatever we'll
make<00:03:19.150> it<00:03:19.330> through<00:03:19.450> here<00:03:19.750> eventually<00:03:20.560> it<00:03:20.770> stuff

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.070

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:22.240 
like I just can't get the hang of it

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.060 
like I just can't get the hang of it
sometimes<00:03:22.930> I'll<00:03:23.080> land<00:03:23.290> it<00:03:23.440> and<00:03:23.590> sometimes<00:03:23.770> I

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
sometimes I'll land it and sometimes I

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:26.010 
sometimes I'll land it and sometimes I
won't<00:03:24.280> it's<00:03:24.459> all<00:03:24.610> about<00:03:24.850> you<00:03:25.000> know<00:03:25.030> timing<00:03:25.870> it

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:26.020 
won't it's all about you know timing it

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:27.510 
won't it's all about you know timing it
really<00:03:26.350> is<00:03:26.470> all<00:03:26.620> about<00:03:26.830> timing<00:03:27.010> it<00:03:27.250> together

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:27.520 
really is all about timing it together

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.790 
really is all about timing it together
and<00:03:27.730> putting<00:03:28.540> it<00:03:28.720> through<00:03:28.870> so<00:03:29.320> this<00:03:29.650> just

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:29.800 
and putting it through so this just

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.620 
and putting it through so this just
shows<00:03:29.890> you<00:03:30.220> how<00:03:30.370> difficult<00:03:30.850> this<00:03:30.970> challenges

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 
shows you how difficult this challenges

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:33.600

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
actually you know how challenging it is

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.000 
actually you know how challenging it is
and<00:03:34.060> how<00:03:34.090> many<00:03:34.720> tricky<00:03:35.440> things<00:03:35.650> are<00:03:35.800> actually

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
and how many tricky things are actually

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.400 
and how many tricky things are actually
in<00:03:36.400> this<00:03:36.520> dungeon<00:03:36.850> so<00:03:37.810> hopefully<00:03:38.140> we'll<00:03:38.290> be

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
in this dungeon so hopefully we'll be

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.080 
in this dungeon so hopefully we'll be
able<00:03:38.440> to<00:03:38.590> get<00:03:38.740> through<00:03:38.950> it<00:03:38.980> and<00:03:39.190> then<00:03:39.430> make<00:03:39.880> our

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:19.830 
guys can see it a little up closer I

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:21.020 
guys can see it a little up closer I
don't<00:06:19.919> know<00:06:20.069> I<00:06:20.099> kind<00:06:20.340> of<00:06:20.370> like<00:06:20.520> that<00:06:20.669> view<00:06:20.849> I

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:21.030 
don't know I kind of like that view I

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:22.249 
don't know I kind of like that view I
don't<00:06:21.419> know<00:06:21.479> I<00:06:21.509> think<00:06:21.659> it<00:06:21.870> looks<00:06:22.020> pretty<00:06:22.080> cool

00:06:22.249 --> 00:06:22.259 
don't know I think it looks pretty cool

00:06:22.259 --> 00:06:24.230 
don't know I think it looks pretty cool
actually<00:06:22.620> but<00:06:23.430> let's<00:06:23.639> go<00:06:23.789> ahead<00:06:23.849> and<00:06:23.940> look<00:06:24.060> for

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:24.240 
actually but let's go ahead and look for

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:25.580 
actually but let's go ahead and look for
the<00:06:24.300> switch<00:06:24.539> we're<00:06:25.169> gonna<00:06:25.259> go<00:06:25.409> ahead<00:06:25.500> and

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:25.590 
the switch we're gonna go ahead and

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:27.499 
the switch we're gonna go ahead and
activate<00:06:26.009> it<00:06:26.159> and<00:06:26.400> then<00:06:26.849> I<00:06:27.000> think<00:06:27.210> it<00:06:27.270> triggers

00:06:27.499 --> 00:06:27.509 
activate it and then I think it triggers

00:06:27.509 --> 00:06:29.600 
activate it and then I think it triggers
a<00:06:27.539> little<00:06:27.840> cutscene<00:06:28.169> and<00:06:28.409> as<00:06:29.280> you<00:06:29.400> just<00:06:29.580> heard

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:29.610 
a little cutscene and as you just heard

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:31.040 
a little cutscene and as you just heard
that<00:06:29.909> little<00:06:30.300> bit<00:06:30.479> of<00:06:30.509> doodoo<00:06:30.720> route

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:31.050 
that little bit of doodoo route
