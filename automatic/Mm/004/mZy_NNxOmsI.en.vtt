 and 2014 that did apple and good the 

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:39.290
 true that many rumors of what 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.940
 had what was going to be presented by 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:44.840
 below were certain as for example 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:47.000
 that apple would be involved in the field of 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:48.740
 health with the new herald book or 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.750
 well the truth is that it was a rumor 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:53.570
 quite the people it is true that it was 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:55.820
 wait as they presented ios 8 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:57.290
 as such they did and the truth was that 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:59.720
 an operating system that will be 

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:01.670
 super super cool has many improvements 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:03.020
 it has the truth that it will be super 

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:05.630
 super cool this new system 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:07.370
 operative apple for ios ios 8 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:09.590
 pretty amazing the truth promises 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:11.060
 very much the truth I do recommend anything 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:12.800
 more you have to wait for some 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:15.260
 months as I mentioned them in 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.750
 Job in November or October 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:19.640
 forgiveness September or November of the same 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:22.040
 way it is most likely that it is also 

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:25.190
 true the rumor that 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:27.050
 the ios 8 come out together with what is the 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:30.380
 iphone 6 world next iphone so that 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:32.720
 come out at par and well then have a 

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:34.370
 success whatever in the sales of apple 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:36.710
 and the truth is that I think that they are going 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:39.050
 to follow together what is iphone 6 and 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:41.480
 ios 8 that's super safe since the 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:43.550
 iphone 6 date is obviously so 

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:46.610
 at the exit of what is air 8 and 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:48.710
 you just have to wait to kill 

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:50.690
 the rumors and good bands already know that 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:52.580
