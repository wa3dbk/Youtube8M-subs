motion<00:02:03.979> to<00:02:04.159> it<00:02:04.310> cast<00:02:04.939> it<00:02:05.119> out<00:02:05.210> let<00:02:05.450> it<00:02:05.479> let<00:02:06.049> it

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
motion to it cast it out let it let it

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.150 
motion to it cast it out let it let it
drop<00:02:06.380> let<00:02:06.679> it<00:02:06.909> you<00:02:07.909> know<00:02:07.999> hit<00:02:08.179> the<00:02:08.269> bottom<00:02:08.569> and

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
drop let it you know hit the bottom and

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.949 
drop let it you know hit the bottom and
twitch<00:02:10.160> it<00:02:10.340> give<00:02:11.120> it<00:02:11.209> a<00:02:11.269> you<00:02:11.569> know<00:02:11.660> a<00:02:11.690> few

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 
twitch it give it a you know a few

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:14.199 
twitch it give it a you know a few
seconds<00:02:12.440> to<00:02:12.560> pause<00:02:12.769> and<00:02:13.310> then<00:02:13.519> torch<00:02:13.819> it<00:02:13.910> again

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
seconds to pause and then torch it again

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:15.339 
seconds to pause and then torch it again
and<00:02:14.360> just<00:02:14.480> kind<00:02:14.629> of<00:02:14.660> work<00:02:14.810> it<00:02:14.840> back<00:02:15.110> to<00:02:15.260> the

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:15.349 
and just kind of work it back to the

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:17.080 
and just kind of work it back to the
boat<00:02:15.530> so<00:02:15.890> let's<00:02:16.220> see<00:02:16.400> if<00:02:16.489> we<00:02:16.580> get<00:02:16.700> back<00:02:16.910> on

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
boat so let's see if we get back on

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.229 
boat so let's see if we get back on
these<00:02:17.239> fish<00:02:17.510> cuz<00:02:18.080> I<00:02:18.140> want<00:02:18.349> to<00:02:18.410> show<00:02:18.620> you<00:02:18.680> guys

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
these fish cuz I want to show you guys

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:21.699 
these fish cuz I want to show you guys
how<00:02:20.239> to<00:02:20.269> catch<00:02:20.599> more<00:02:20.780> fish<00:02:21.019> on<00:02:21.200> the<00:02:21.290> drop<00:02:21.500> shot

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
how to catch more fish on the drop shot

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:24.070 
how to catch more fish on the drop shot
but<00:02:22.549> also<00:02:22.640> how<00:02:23.060> to<00:02:23.120> be<00:02:23.269> confident<00:02:23.810> with<00:02:23.989> the

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
but also how to be confident with the

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.750 
but also how to be confident with the
technique<00:02:24.440> because<00:02:24.799> it's<00:02:24.950> very<00:02:25.190> important

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
technique because it's very important

00:02:25.760 --> 00:03:18.470 
technique because it's very important
and<00:02:26.379> so<00:02:27.379> let's<00:02:27.739> hit<00:02:27.829> the<00:02:27.950> water<00:02:28.099> here

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.869 

so<00:03:19.480> prime<00:03:19.720> example<00:03:20.200> right<00:03:20.349> there<00:03:20.530> guys

00:03:20.869 --> 00:03:20.879 
so prime example right there guys

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:26.100 
so prime example right there guys
casting<00:03:21.879> it<00:03:21.970> out<00:03:22.090> letting<00:03:23.050> it<00:03:23.140> drop<00:03:25.110> and

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.110 
casting it out letting it drop and

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.640 
casting it out letting it drop and
essentially<00:03:26.980> if<00:03:27.310> you're<00:03:27.550> fishing<00:03:27.970> on<00:03:28.060> a<00:03:28.120> river

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
essentially if you're fishing on a river

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.180 
essentially if you're fishing on a river
you<00:03:29.650> kind<00:03:29.920> of<00:03:29.980> want<00:03:30.190> to<00:03:30.750> feel<00:03:31.750> your<00:03:32.590> drop<00:03:32.950> shot

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
you kind of want to feel your drop shot

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:36.630 
you kind of want to feel your drop shot
weight<00:03:33.370> bounce<00:03:33.670> along<00:03:33.940> and<00:03:35.160> it's<00:03:36.160> it's<00:03:36.430> kind

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
weight bounce along and it's it's kind

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.550 
weight bounce along and it's it's kind
of<00:03:36.700> hard<00:03:36.880> to<00:03:36.940> teach<00:03:37.150> people<00:03:37.510> over<00:03:37.750> video<00:03:38.050> it's

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
of hard to teach people over video it's

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.550 
of hard to teach people over video it's
a<00:03:38.620> lot<00:03:38.769> easier<00:03:39.099> to<00:03:39.220> do<00:03:39.400> it<00:03:39.430> in<00:03:40.260> person

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
a lot easier to do it in person

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.949 
a lot easier to do it in person
but<00:03:42.459> if<00:03:42.549> you<00:03:42.640> can<00:03:42.790> kind<00:03:43.030> of<00:03:43.090> feel<00:03:43.390> that<00:03:43.599> drop

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
but if you can kind of feel that drop

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:45.440 
but if you can kind of feel that drop
shot<00:03:44.200> wait<00:03:44.380> tick<00:03:44.739> along<00:03:45.040> the<00:03:45.190> rocks

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
shot wait tick along the rocks

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:46.979 
shot wait tick along the rocks
essentially<00:03:46.450> what<00:03:46.569> you're<00:03:46.690> doing<00:03:46.870> you're
