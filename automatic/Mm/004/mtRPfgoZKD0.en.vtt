excited so I filmed it in case I wanted
to<00:01:00.870> make<00:01:00.989> a<00:01:01.020> video<00:01:01.199> or<00:01:01.649> just<00:01:01.680> relive<00:01:02.460> the

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
to make a video or just relive the

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.179 
to make a video or just relive the
moments<00:01:03.059> that<00:01:03.619> occurred<00:01:04.619> because<00:01:04.799> it<00:01:05.040> was

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
moments that occurred because it was

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.120 
moments that occurred because it was
really<00:01:05.460> momentous<00:01:05.610> and<00:01:06.470> it<00:01:07.470> actually<00:01:07.680> meant<00:01:08.040> a

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
really momentous and it actually meant a

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.990 
really momentous and it actually meant a
lot<00:01:08.280> to<00:01:08.340> me<00:01:08.610> as<00:01:08.729> silly<00:01:08.939> as<00:01:09.090> that<00:01:09.119> might<00:01:09.420> sound

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 
lot to me as silly as that might sound

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.420 
lot to me as silly as that might sound
so<00:01:12.000> anyways<00:01:12.360> I<00:01:12.600> mounted<00:01:13.320> up<00:01:13.439> on<00:01:13.590> my<00:01:14.100> neck<00:01:14.159> see

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
so anyways I mounted up on my neck see

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.840 
so anyways I mounted up on my neck see
and<00:01:14.520> Drake<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:14.939> flew<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:15.840> wear<00:01:16.140> a<00:01:16.290> longing<00:01:16.590> was

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
and Drake and flew to wear a longing was

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:18.830 
and Drake and flew to wear a longing was
usually<00:01:17.850> flies<00:01:18.090> around<00:01:18.270> in<00:01:18.479> like<00:01:18.570> a<00:01:18.630> big

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
usually flies around in like a big

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.609 
usually flies around in like a big
serpentine<00:01:19.350> pattern<00:01:19.560> for<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.400> map<00:01:20.580> and

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:21.619 
serpentine pattern for the map and

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:23.510 
serpentine pattern for the map and
targeted<00:01:22.619> it<00:01:22.740> it's<00:01:22.950> next<00:01:23.250> to<00:01:23.400> a<00:01:23.430> giant

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
targeted it it's next to a giant

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.789 
targeted it it's next to a giant
mountain<00:01:23.939> which<00:01:24.900> is<00:01:25.140> helpful<00:01:25.380> because<00:01:25.590> I

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
mountain which is helpful because I

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.590 
mountain which is helpful because I
didn't<00:01:26.040> know<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.549> range<00:01:26.790> on<00:01:27.030> this<00:01:27.150> crystal

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
didn't know the range on this crystal

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.810 
didn't know the range on this crystal
apparently<00:01:28.200> after<00:01:28.350> researching<00:01:28.799> it<00:01:29.040> it<00:01:29.280> has

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
apparently after researching it it has

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.700 
apparently after researching it it has
infinite<00:01:30.360> range<00:01:30.540> so<00:01:30.840> you<00:01:31.200> could<00:01:31.380> really<00:01:31.680> just

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
infinite range so you could really just

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.440 
infinite range so you could really just
target<00:01:32.280> it<00:01:32.340> as<00:01:32.430> far<00:01:32.700> away<00:01:32.790> as<00:01:32.880> you<00:01:33.000> kill<00:01:33.240> it<00:01:33.270> in

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
target it as far away as you kill it in

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.359 
target it as far away as you kill it in
it<00:01:33.960> will<00:01:34.079> instantly<00:01:34.409> aggro<00:01:34.860> and<00:01:35.070> come<00:01:35.220> right

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
it will instantly aggro and come right

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.660 
it will instantly aggro and come right
up<00:01:35.579> to<00:01:35.610> you<00:01:35.850> so<00:01:36.780> you<00:01:36.840> use<00:01:37.140> it<00:01:37.320> and<00:01:37.710> lightning

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
up to you so you use it and lightning

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:39.859 
up to you so you use it and lightning
beam<00:01:38.790> comes<00:01:39.000> down<00:01:39.180> and<00:01:39.360> he<00:01:39.420> comes<00:01:39.630> right<00:01:39.810> to

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
beam comes down and he comes right to

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.039 
beam comes down and he comes right to
you<00:01:40.280> the<00:01:41.280> attacks<00:01:41.579> are<00:01:41.700> really<00:01:42.000> weak<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:42.570> I

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
you the attacks are really weak and I

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.350 
you the attacks are really weak and I
didn't<00:01:43.320> pop<00:01:43.439> any<00:01:43.680> cooldowns<00:01:44.130> I<00:01:44.399> just<00:01:44.610> went<00:01:45.149> for

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
didn't pop any cooldowns I just went for

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.569 
didn't pop any cooldowns I just went for
it<00:01:45.390> I<00:01:45.720> did<00:01:46.530> notice<00:01:46.710> that<00:01:46.860> it's<00:01:47.100> on<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.250> edge<00:01:47.430> of

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
it I did notice that it's on the edge of

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.429 
it I did notice that it's on the edge of
the<00:01:47.700> mountain<00:01:47.820> and<00:01:48.149> I<00:01:48.659> didn't<00:01:48.930> want<00:01:49.140> it<00:01:49.380> to

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
the mountain and I didn't want it to

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.410 
the mountain and I didn't want it to
fall<00:01:49.890> somewhere<00:01:50.490> where<00:01:50.790> I<00:01:50.820> couldn't<00:01:51.060> loot<00:01:51.270> it

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
fall somewhere where I couldn't loot it

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.630 
fall somewhere where I couldn't loot it
so<00:01:51.750> I<00:01:51.780> keep<00:01:52.259> backing<00:01:52.649> up<00:01:52.979> and<00:01:53.159> backing<00:01:53.490> up

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
so I keep backing up and backing up

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.440 
so I keep backing up and backing up
backing<00:01:53.909> up<00:01:54.350> but<00:01:55.350> uh<00:01:55.380> as<00:01:55.770> you'll<00:01:56.610> soon<00:01:56.790> see<00:01:56.850> it

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
backing up but uh as you'll soon see it

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.990 
backing up but uh as you'll soon see it
didn't<00:01:58.320> really<00:01:58.590> matter<00:01:58.920> because<00:01:59.280> it<00:01:59.670> still

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
didn't really matter because it still

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.819 
didn't really matter because it still
fell<00:02:00.270> somewhere<00:02:00.719> where<00:02:00.930> I<00:02:00.990> absolutely<00:02:01.560> could

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
fell somewhere where I absolutely could

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.249 
fell somewhere where I absolutely could
not<00:02:01.860> loot<00:02:02.219> it<00:02:02.750> at<00:02:03.750> least<00:02:03.899> that's<00:02:04.079> what<00:02:04.200> I

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
not loot it at least that's what I

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.469 
not loot it at least that's what I
thought<00:02:04.439> because<00:02:04.740> it<00:02:04.979> falls<00:02:05.369> and<00:02:05.759> gets<00:02:06.210> stuck

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
thought because it falls and gets stuck

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.600 
thought because it falls and gets stuck
in<00:02:06.509> the<00:02:06.630> side<00:02:06.960> of<00:02:06.990> a<00:02:07.229> sheer<00:02:07.439> cliff<00:02:07.469> and<00:02:08.039> you

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
in the side of a sheer cliff and you

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.150 
in the side of a sheer cliff and you
can't<00:02:08.989> land<00:02:09.989> near<00:02:10.440> it

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
can't land near it

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.130 
can't land near it
and<00:02:11.280> you<00:02:11.730> can't<00:02:11.970> walk<00:02:12.210> close<00:02:12.480> enough<00:02:12.840> to<00:02:12.990> it<00:02:13.110> to

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
and you can't walk close enough to it to

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.340 
and you can't walk close enough to it to
loot<00:02:13.620> it<00:02:13.770> so<00:02:14.430> I<00:02:14.460> dismount<00:02:15.150> and<00:02:15.420> I<00:02:15.630> loot<00:02:15.930> as<00:02:16.110> fast

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
loot it so I dismount and I loot as fast

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.670 
loot it so I dismount and I loot as fast
as<00:02:16.530> I<00:02:16.620> hand<00:02:16.920> to<00:02:17.310> see<00:02:17.460> if<00:02:17.550> that<00:02:17.670> would<00:02:17.790> work<00:02:17.820> and

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
as I hand to see if that would work and

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.910 
as I hand to see if that would work and
luckily<00:02:19.680> enough<00:02:20.040> it<00:02:20.310> did<00:02:20.940> however<00:02:21.840> I<00:02:22.380> forgot

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
luckily enough it did however I forgot

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.950 
luckily enough it did however I forgot
that<00:02:23.130> there<00:02:23.250> is<00:02:23.430> a<00:02:23.460> reputation<00:02:24.330> requirement

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
that there is a reputation requirement

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:29.450 
that there is a reputation requirement
so<00:02:25.470> I<00:02:26.510> started<00:02:27.510> grinding<00:02:27.720> reputation<00:02:28.620> all<00:02:29.130> day

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.460 
so I started grinding reputation all day

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.250 
so I started grinding reputation all day
that<00:02:29.700> day<00:02:29.910> just<00:02:30.180> killing<00:02:30.570> zandalari<00:02:31.050> war

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
that day just killing zandalari war

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.810 
that day just killing zandalari war
scouts<00:02:31.560> over<00:02:32.070> and<00:02:32.220> over<00:02:32.280> and<00:02:32.460> over<00:02:32.520> and<00:02:32.760> over

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
scouts over and over and over and over

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.760 
scouts over and over and over and over
and<00:02:33.000> over<00:02:33.090> until<00:02:33.450> I<00:02:33.780> became<00:02:34.110> exalted<00:02:34.620> with

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
and over until I became exalted with

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.210 
and over until I became exalted with
them<00:02:34.980> so<00:02:35.670> I<00:02:36.090> jump<00:02:36.720> cut<00:02:36.930> to<00:02:37.110> later<00:02:37.350> when<00:02:37.770> I'm<00:02:38.010> in

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
them so I jump cut to later when I'm in

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.590 
them so I jump cut to later when I'm in
the<00:02:38.370> Firelands<00:02:38.850> because<00:02:39.270> I<00:02:39.360> thought<00:02:39.540> that

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
the Firelands because I thought that

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.990 
the Firelands because I thought that
would<00:02:39.870> make<00:02:39.900> be<00:02:40.260> a<00:02:40.290> I<00:02:40.830> thought<00:02:41.550> the<00:02:41.670> colors<00:02:41.970> of

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
would make be a I thought the colors of

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.600 
would make be a I thought the colors of
the<00:02:42.150> fire<00:02:42.390> and<00:02:42.690> the<00:02:42.990> environment<00:02:43.260> would<00:02:44.160> suit

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
the fire and the environment would suit

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.960 
the fire and the environment would suit
this<00:02:44.850> Ruby<00:02:45.330> Drake<00:02:45.600> really<00:02:45.960> well<00:02:46.170> and<00:02:46.670> so<00:02:47.670> I

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
this Ruby Drake really well and so I

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.750 
this Ruby Drake really well and so I
finally<00:02:48.690> get<00:02:48.960> to<00:02:49.020> learn<00:02:49.230> this<00:02:49.500> after<00:02:50.370> hours<00:02:50.730> of

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
finally get to learn this after hours of

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.990 
finally get to learn this after hours of
grinding<00:02:51.980> after<00:02:52.980> having<00:02:53.160> brown<00:02:53.520> like

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000
