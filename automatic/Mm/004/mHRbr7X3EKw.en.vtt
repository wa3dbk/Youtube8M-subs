00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
know and I think that that's important

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.630 
know and I think that that's important
the<00:03:18.840> way<00:03:18.959> that<00:03:19.170> a<00:03:19.200> woman<00:03:19.230> carries<00:03:20.100> herself<00:03:20.250> and

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
the way that a woman carries herself and

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.670 
the way that a woman carries herself and
holds<00:03:20.910> herself<00:03:21.270> and<00:03:21.540> is<00:03:21.750> confident<00:03:22.410> in<00:03:22.560> her

long<00:04:50.400> pencil<00:04:50.910> skirt<00:04:51.180> so<00:04:52.050> it's<00:04:52.200> not

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:52.290 
long pencil skirt so it's not

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:55.280 
long pencil skirt so it's not
necessarily<00:04:52.770> showing<00:04:53.190> too<00:04:53.490> much<00:04:53.520> skin<00:04:54.360> but<00:04:55.260> a

necessarily showing too much skin but a

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:56.810 
necessarily showing too much skin but a

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:56.820 
little bit there's something youthful

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:59.000 
little bit there's something youthful
about<00:04:57.540> the<00:04:57.840> crop<00:04:58.050> top<00:04:58.230> I<00:04:58.440> mean<00:04:58.560> it's<00:04:58.710> not<00:04:58.830> for

00:04:59.000 --> 00:04:59.010
