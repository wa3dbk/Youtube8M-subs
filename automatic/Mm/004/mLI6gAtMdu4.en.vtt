with our training schedule and Huck is
living<00:02:10.800> proof<00:02:10.920> and<00:02:11.159> I'm<00:02:11.310> so<00:02:11.610> proud<00:02:11.790> of<00:02:11.849> him

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060

think<00:02:14.519> like<00:02:14.909> what<00:02:15.690> we<00:02:15.810> see<00:02:16.080> lately<00:02:16.500> that<00:02:16.970> not

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
think like what we see lately that not

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.550 
think like what we see lately that not
many<00:02:18.239> foreigners<00:02:18.690> are<00:02:18.900> willing<00:02:19.200> to<00:02:19.349> go<00:02:19.530> to

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
many foreigners are willing to go to

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.190 
many foreigners are willing to go to
korea<00:02:20.099> since<00:02:20.459> there's<00:02:20.700> so<00:02:20.760> much<00:02:21.030> money<00:02:21.360> and

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
korea since there's so much money and

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.800 
korea since there's so much money and
stuff<00:02:22.469> going<00:02:22.859> in<00:02:23.159> in<00:02:23.790> the<00:02:24.120> europe<00:02:24.329> in<00:02:24.540> the<00:02:24.629> rest

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
stuff going in in the europe in the rest

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:25.880 
stuff going in in the europe in the rest
of<00:02:24.959> the<00:02:25.049> world<00:02:25.260> and<00:02:25.439> she<00:02:25.590> said

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
of the world and she said

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.850 
of the world and she said
takes<00:02:26.069> a<00:02:26.190> long<00:02:26.340> time<00:02:26.370> but<00:02:27.270> I<00:02:27.480> think<00:02:27.990> we've<00:02:28.530> seen

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
takes a long time but I think we've seen

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.410 
takes a long time but I think we've seen
how<00:02:29.040> to<00:02:29.100> prove<00:02:29.430> that<00:02:29.460> it's<00:02:29.790> still<00:02:30.090> possible

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
how to prove that it's still possible

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.140 
how to prove that it's still possible
playing<00:02:31.140> in<00:02:31.380> the<00:02:31.410> gsl<00:02:31.980> and<00:02:32.190> attending<00:02:32.910> some

other<00:02:33.780> events<00:02:34.410> and<00:02:34.640> winning<00:02:35.640> I<00:02:35.850> think<00:02:36.420> winning

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
other events and winning I think winning

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.440 
other events and winning I think winning
and<00:02:36.930> and<00:02:37.200> I<00:02:37.290> hope<00:02:37.800> that<00:02:38.069> it<00:02:38.310> will<00:02:38.520> start<00:02:39.300> a

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
and and I hope that it will start a

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.320 
and and I hope that it will start a
chain<00:02:39.630> reaction<00:02:39.870> even<00:02:40.740> though<00:02:41.130> you<00:02:41.190> there<00:02:41.819> he

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
chain reaction even though you there he

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.300 
chain reaction even though you there he
cannot<00:02:42.690> attend<00:02:43.050> that<00:02:43.290> many<00:02:43.500> events<00:02:43.890> or<00:02:44.130> that
