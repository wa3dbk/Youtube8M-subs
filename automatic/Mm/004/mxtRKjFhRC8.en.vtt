be able to cure baldness by genetic
really<00:03:09.050> well<00:03:09.980> I<00:03:10.010> think<00:03:10.340> near<00:03:10.640> baldness<00:03:11.150> is<00:03:11.300> a

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360 
really well I think near baldness is a

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.660 
really well I think near baldness is a
very<00:03:11.570> good<00:03:11.630> thing<00:03:11.780> i<00:03:12.110> think<00:03:12.170> the<00:03:12.320> a<00:03:12.459> great<00:03:13.459> new

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
very good thing i think the a great new

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:15.430 
very good thing i think the a great new
bold<00:03:14.150> figure<00:03:14.480> to<00:03:14.600> become<00:03:14.900> with<00:03:15.110> the<00:03:15.140> aid<00:03:15.410> of
