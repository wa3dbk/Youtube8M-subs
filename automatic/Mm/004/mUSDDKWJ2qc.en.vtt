everyone's<00:00:00.810> last<00:00:01.050> username<00:00:01.319> I<00:00:02.220> just<00:00:02.730> wanted

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:02.970 
everyone's last username I just wanted

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.990 
everyone's last username I just wanted
to<00:00:03.030> show<00:00:03.300> you<00:00:03.330> a<00:00:04.220> great<00:00:05.220> little<00:00:05.430> command<00:00:05.819> block

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
to show you a great little command block

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.460 
to show you a great little command block
trick<00:00:06.240> that<00:00:06.450> I<00:00:06.480> just<00:00:06.720> figured<00:00:06.990> out<00:00:07.080> tonight

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
trick that I just figured out tonight

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.470 
trick that I just figured out tonight
don't<00:00:08.280> normally<00:00:08.550> do<00:00:08.639> videos<00:00:08.910> on<00:00:09.059> things<00:00:09.269> this

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
don't normally do videos on things this

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.000 
don't normally do videos on things this
small<00:00:09.750> but<00:00:09.929> this<00:00:10.019> is<00:00:10.110> a<00:00:10.139> really<00:00:10.530> nice<00:00:10.650> little

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
small but this is a really nice little

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.230 
small but this is a really nice little
trick<00:00:11.190> I<00:00:11.219> know<00:00:11.309> a<00:00:11.429> lot<00:00:11.610> of<00:00:11.639> map<00:00:11.849> makers<00:00:12.150> are

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
trick I know a lot of map makers are

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.759 
trick I know a lot of map makers are
going<00:00:12.360> to<00:00:12.420> appreciate<00:00:12.660> this<00:00:13.019> thanks<00:00:13.740> to

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
going to appreciate this thanks to

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.169 
going to appreciate this thanks to
sethbling<00:00:14.219> for<00:00:14.429> helping<00:00:14.639> me<00:00:14.700> figure<00:00:14.849> this<00:00:14.940> out

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
sethbling for helping me figure this out

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.510 
sethbling for helping me figure this out
by<00:00:15.839> the<00:00:15.900> way<00:00:16.220> so<00:00:17.220> oftentimes<00:00:19.160> you<00:00:20.160> will<00:00:20.310> want

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
by the way so oftentimes you will want

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.970 
by the way so oftentimes you will want
to<00:00:20.580> detect<00:00:21.000> players<00:00:21.600> in<00:00:21.990> a<00:00:22.350> very<00:00:22.380> specific

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
to detect players in a very specific

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.420 
to detect players in a very specific
location<00:00:23.699> let<00:00:23.880> go<00:00:24.000> 1<00:00:24.210> 1<00:00:24.840> block<00:00:25.050> location<00:00:25.560> to<00:00:26.340> do

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
location let go 1 1 block location to do

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:27.939 
location let go 1 1 block location to do
that<00:00:26.609> you<00:00:26.699> might<00:00:26.820> use<00:00:26.849> a<00:00:26.970> command<00:00:27.210> block<00:00:27.390> with

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:27.949 
that you might use a command block with

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:30.679 
that you might use a command block with
command<00:00:28.949> like<00:00:29.099> this<00:00:29.310> that's<00:00:30.119> for<00:00:30.330> the

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
command like this that's for the

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.740 
command like this that's for the
location<00:00:30.960> radius<00:00:31.590> equals<00:00:31.920> 1<00:00:32.520> and<00:00:33.510> this<00:00:33.600> will

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
location radius equals 1 and this will

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.430 
location radius equals 1 and this will
detect<00:00:34.020> players<00:00:34.260> at<00:00:34.590> that<00:00:35.040> location<00:00:35.309> but

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:36.440 
detect players at that location but

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.420 
detect players at that location but
unfortunately<00:00:37.440> it<00:00:37.559> will<00:00:37.620> also<00:00:37.920> detect<00:00:38.219> them

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
unfortunately it will also detect them

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:44.410 
unfortunately it will also detect them
in<00:00:39.020> some<00:00:40.020> adjacent<00:00:40.260> locations<00:00:41.690> like<00:00:42.690> this

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420 
in some adjacent locations like this

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.810 
in some adjacent locations like this
once<00:00:45.420> detected<00:00:45.719> in<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:45.840> corners<00:00:46.489> so<00:00:47.489> this<00:00:47.670> is

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
once detected in the corners so this is

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.900 
once detected in the corners so this is
kind<00:00:48.149> of<00:00:48.180> like<00:00:48.329> a<00:00:48.390> star-shaped<00:00:49.910> detection

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
kind of like a star-shaped detection

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.010 
kind of like a star-shaped detection
area<00:00:51.149> and<00:00:52.100> you<00:00:53.100> might<00:00:53.250> say<00:00:53.280> to<00:00:53.520> use<00:00:53.850> r<00:00:54.329> equals<00:00:54.660> 0

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
area and you might say to use r equals 0

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.170 
area and you might say to use r equals 0
but<00:00:55.469> that<00:00:55.800> doesn't<00:00:55.890> work<00:00:56.190> because<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:57.000> game

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
but that doesn't work because the game

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.529 
but that doesn't work because the game
consider<00:00:57.780> 0<00:00:58.230> and<00:00:58.500> invalid<00:00:58.890> value<00:00:59.010> and<00:00:59.430> it<00:01:00.359> will

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
consider 0 and invalid value and it will

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.719 
consider 0 and invalid value and it will
just<00:01:00.809> ignore<00:01:01.020> it<00:01:03.619> so<00:01:04.619> until<00:01:05.129> now<00:01:05.309> there<00:01:05.549> hasn't

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
just ignore it so until now there hasn't

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.870 
just ignore it so until now there hasn't
been<00:01:05.880> a<00:01:06.000> good<00:01:06.150> way<00:01:06.540> to<00:01:07.220> detect<00:01:08.220> a<00:01:08.430> player<00:01:08.640> in

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
been a good way to detect a player in

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.310 
been a good way to detect a player in
one<00:01:09.090> block<00:01:09.270> there's<00:01:09.510> some<00:01:09.659> complicated<00:01:10.110> ways

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
one block there's some complicated ways

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.230 
one block there's some complicated ways
where<00:01:10.590> you<00:01:10.650> have<00:01:10.770> multiple<00:01:10.950> areas<00:01:11.939> that

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
where you have multiple areas that

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.380 
where you have multiple areas that
overlap<00:01:12.600> but<00:01:12.900> nothing<00:01:13.890> simple<00:01:14.250> but<00:01:15.119> tonight<00:01:15.360> I

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
overlap but nothing simple but tonight I

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.050 
overlap but nothing simple but tonight I
discovered<00:01:15.930> you<00:01:16.020> can<00:01:16.140> do<00:01:16.259> this<00:01:16.520> r<00:01:17.520> equals

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
discovered you can do this r equals

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:25.010 
discovered you can do this r equals
65,536<00:01:21.590> this<00:01:22.590> is<00:01:22.680> a<00:01:22.770> magical<00:01:23.220> number<00:01:23.930> set<00:01:24.930> the

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
65,536 this is a magical number set the

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.160 
65,536 this is a magical number set the
radius<00:01:25.170> to<00:01:25.439> that<00:01:25.619> it<00:01:26.549> will<00:01:26.729> not<00:01:26.880> detect<00:01:27.210> the

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
radius to that it will not detect the

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.490 
radius to that it will not detect the
player<00:01:28.439> in<00:01:28.860> any<00:01:29.729> of<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.090> adjacent<00:01:30.500> locations

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
player in any of the adjacent locations

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.800 
player in any of the adjacent locations
but<00:01:32.460> it<00:01:32.549> will<00:01:32.670> detect<00:01:32.820> them<00:01:33.119> in<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.360> location

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
but it will detect them in the location

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:40.460 
but it will detect them in the location
that<00:01:34.079> you<00:01:34.500> specify<00:01:37.310> it's<00:01:38.310> that<00:01:38.520> simple<00:01:39.140> so<00:01:40.140> so

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
that you specify it's that simple so so

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.230 
that you specify it's that simple so so
useful<00:01:40.890> i<00:01:40.950> know<00:01:41.040> a<00:01:41.130> lot<00:01:41.189> of<00:01:41.310> map<00:01:41.490> makers<00:01:41.820> who

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
useful i know a lot of map makers who

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.710 
useful i know a lot of map makers who
could<00:01:42.420> really<00:01:42.630> really<00:01:42.930> use<00:01:43.350> this<00:01:44.420> so<00:01:45.420> why<00:01:45.570> does

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
could really really use this so why does

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.679 
could really really use this so why does
it<00:01:45.810> work<00:01:46.850> some<00:01:47.850> rather<00:01:48.060> arcane<00:01:48.720> math<00:01:49.470> involved

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:50.689 
it work some rather arcane math involved

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:54.530 
it work some rather arcane math involved
essentially<00:01:51.689> in<00:01:52.470> order<00:01:52.649> to<00:01:52.740> calculate<00:01:53.540> if

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
essentially in order to calculate if

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.149 
essentially in order to calculate if
there's<00:01:54.750> players<00:01:55.049> and<00:01:55.290> range<00:01:55.439> of<00:01:55.590> that<00:01:55.649> radius

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
there's players and range of that radius

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.899 
there's players and range of that radius
it<00:01:56.310> needs<00:01:56.520> to<00:01:56.869> square<00:01:57.869> that<00:01:58.320> number<00:01:58.909> some

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
it needs to square that number some

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.870 
it needs to square that number some
point<00:02:00.149> part<00:02:00.479> of<00:02:00.540> the<00:02:00.600> calculation<00:02:01.170> it<00:02:01.979> does

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
point part of the calculation it does

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.860 
point part of the calculation it does
the<00:02:03.240> calculation<00:02:03.360> using<00:02:04.049> integer<00:02:05.009> math

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:05.870 
the calculation using integer math

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:13.020 
the calculation using integer math
and<00:02:05.990> integers<00:02:07.780> overflow<00:02:09.250> at<00:02:10.250> a<00:02:10.310> certain<00:02:10.870> value

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
and integers overflow at a certain value

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.640 
and integers overflow at a certain value
the<00:02:14.030> numbers<00:02:14.270> get<00:02:14.390> big<00:02:14.600> enough<00:02:14.690> and<00:02:14.990> when<00:02:15.560> they

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
the numbers get big enough and when they

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.470 
the numbers get big enough and when they
overflow<00:02:16.040> they<00:02:16.310> start<00:02:16.940> getting<00:02:17.090> weird

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
overflow they start getting weird

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.840 
overflow they start getting weird
negative<00:02:17.930> values<00:02:18.230> and<00:02:18.680> weird<00:02:19.370> stuff<00:02:19.490> starts

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
negative values and weird stuff starts

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:22.000 
negative values and weird stuff starts
to<00:02:19.940> happen<00:02:20.110> it<00:02:21.110> just<00:02:21.320> so<00:02:21.380> happens<00:02:21.710> that<00:02:21.770> if<00:02:21.920> you

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
to happen it just so happens that if you

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.280 
to happen it just so happens that if you
square<00:02:22.430> this<00:02:22.700> number<00:02:23.120> it<00:02:23.330> overflows<00:02:23.900> to

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
square this number it overflows to

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.310 
square this number it overflows to
exactly<00:02:24.800> zero<00:02:25.300> so<00:02:26.300> essentially<00:02:26.990> what<00:02:27.170> we've

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320 
exactly zero so essentially what we've

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.460 
exactly zero so essentially what we've
done<00:02:27.470> is<00:02:27.680> we've<00:02:27.830> given<00:02:28.040> radius<00:02:29.290> value<00:02:30.290> that's

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
done is we've given radius value that's

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.560 
done is we've given radius value that's
bigger<00:02:30.950> than<00:02:31.040> 0<00:02:31.190> so<00:02:31.430> it<00:02:31.550> gets<00:02:31.700> past<00:02:32.000> the<00:02:32.210> filter

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:32.570 
bigger than 0 so it gets past the filter

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:34.630 
bigger than 0 so it gets past the filter
but<00:02:33.560> then<00:02:33.710> it<00:02:33.860> gets<00:02:33.920> squared<00:02:34.220> and<00:02:34.490> it<00:02:34.550> gets

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
but then it gets squared and it gets

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.330 
but then it gets squared and it gets
changed<00:02:34.910> to<00:02:35.090> 0<00:02:35.300> so<00:02:35.720> this<00:02:35.900> is<00:02:36.080> essentially<00:02:37.070> r

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
changed to 0 so this is essentially r

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.860 
changed to 0 so this is essentially r
equals<00:02:37.640> 0<00:02:38.950> it's<00:02:39.950> that<00:02:40.100> simple<00:02:40.540> and<00:02:41.540> if<00:02:41.750> you're

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
equals 0 it's that simple and if you're

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.200 
equals 0 it's that simple and if you're
wondering<00:02:41.900> what<00:02:42.440> is<00:02:42.650> the<00:02:42.830> largest<00:02:43.280> radius<00:02:43.850> you

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:44.210 
wondering what is the largest radius you

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:47.110 
wondering what is the largest radius you
can<00:02:44.360> use<00:02:44.540> the<00:02:44.690> doesn't<00:02:45.080> overflow<00:02:45.880> can<00:02:46.880> tell

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
can use the doesn't overflow can tell

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:53.820 
can use the doesn't overflow can tell
you<00:02:47.270> that<00:02:47.450> it's<00:02:47.780> 40<00:02:49.510> 6340<00:02:51.460> that<00:02:52.460> is<00:02:53.060> just<00:02:53.450> the

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
you that it's 40 6340 that is just the

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:55.930 
you that it's 40 6340 that is just the
largest<00:02:54.830> number<00:02:55.100> that<00:02:55.130> you<00:02:55.400> can<00:02:55.430> square

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
largest number that you can square

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.470 
largest number that you can square
without<00:02:56.150> overflowing<00:02:57.080> and<00:02:57.430> integer<00:02:58.480> by

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
without overflowing and integer by

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.910 
without overflowing and integer by
priests<00:03:00.320> it<00:03:00.440> by<00:03:00.560> one<00:03:00.800> then<00:03:01.160> it<00:03:01.550> stops<00:03:01.850> working

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
priests it by one then it stops working

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.200 
priests it by one then it stops working
so<00:03:03.920> I<00:03:04.220> should<00:03:04.430> probably<00:03:04.460> take<00:03:05.030> this

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:05.210 
so I should probably take this

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:07.240 
so I should probably take this
opportunity<00:03:05.420> to<00:03:05.720> give<00:03:06.440> you<00:03:06.530> a<00:03:06.590> little<00:03:06.710> channel

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
opportunity to give you a little channel

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:08.860 
opportunity to give you a little channel
update<00:03:07.580> because<00:03:07.820> it's<00:03:08.000> been<00:03:08.120> a<00:03:08.150> long<00:03:08.450> time

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
update because it's been a long time

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.590 
update because it's been a long time
since<00:03:08.900> I<00:03:09.290> made<00:03:09.500> any<00:03:09.830> videos<00:03:10.300> the<00:03:11.300> reason<00:03:11.570> for

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600 
since I made any videos the reason for

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.680 
since I made any videos the reason for
that<00:03:11.810> is<00:03:12.200> I've<00:03:12.770> been<00:03:12.950> very<00:03:13.340> very<00:03:13.640> hard<00:03:13.940> at<00:03:14.330> work

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
that is I've been very very hard at work

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.340 
that is I've been very very hard at work
on<00:03:14.989> who<00:03:15.530> do<00:03:15.739> my<00:03:16.520> custom<00:03:17.090> PvP<00:03:17.510> map<00:03:17.720> but<00:03:18.110> working

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:18.350 
on who do my custom PvP map but working

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:20.340 
on who do my custom PvP map but working
on<00:03:18.440> it<00:03:18.620> intensely<00:03:19.459> for<00:03:19.670> the<00:03:19.790> last<00:03:19.910> few<00:03:20.090> months

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
on it intensely for the last few months

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:24.040 
on it intensely for the last few months
playing<00:03:21.350> it<00:03:21.680> tweaking<00:03:22.340> it<00:03:22.640> and<00:03:22.820> this<00:03:23.450> point<00:03:23.750> it

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:24.050 
playing it tweaking it and this point it

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:28.120 
playing it tweaking it and this point it
is<00:03:24.370> done<00:03:25.370> pretty<00:03:26.000> much<00:03:26.380> there's<00:03:27.380> last<00:03:27.739> some

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
is done pretty much there's last some

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:29.920 
is done pretty much there's last some
finishing<00:03:28.400> touches<00:03:28.459> have<00:03:28.760> to<00:03:28.880> put<00:03:29.030> on<00:03:29.180> it<00:03:29.209> I'm

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
finishing touches have to put on it I'm

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.229 
finishing touches have to put on it I'm
gonna<00:03:30.020> make<00:03:30.140> like<00:03:30.920> a<00:03:30.980> tutorial<00:03:31.310> video<00:03:31.700> maybe<00:03:32.150> a

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:32.239 
gonna make like a tutorial video maybe a

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:34.750 
gonna make like a tutorial video maybe a
trailer<00:03:32.720> but<00:03:33.650> I'm<00:03:33.950> going<00:03:34.250> to<00:03:34.310> try<00:03:34.430> to<00:03:34.459> release

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
trailer but I'm going to try to release

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.660 
trailer but I'm going to try to release
it<00:03:34.940> in<00:03:35.060> the<00:03:35.150> next<00:03:35.360> few<00:03:35.480> days<00:03:35.720> so<00:03:36.470> got<00:03:37.430> that

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670 
it in the next few days so got that

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:40.630 
it in the next few days so got that
coming<00:03:38.060> up<00:03:38.470> once<00:03:39.470> that's<00:03:39.709> done<00:03:40.040> I'm<00:03:40.400> going<00:03:40.550> to

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 
coming up once that's done I'm going to

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.710 
coming up once that's done I'm going to
have<00:03:40.760> more<00:03:40.970> time<00:03:41.330> to<00:03:41.630> make<00:03:41.750> videos<00:03:42.520> I<00:03:43.720> am

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
have more time to make videos I am

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.350 
have more time to make videos I am
probably<00:03:45.170> going<00:03:45.590> to<00:03:45.860> wrap<00:03:46.340> up<00:03:46.580> my<00:03:47.030> feed<00:03:47.270> the

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.360 
probably going to wrap up my feed the

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.960 
probably going to wrap up my feed the
beast<00:03:47.540> series<00:03:47.800> make<00:03:48.800> one<00:03:48.950> last<00:03:49.160> episode<00:03:49.640> to

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
beast series make one last episode to

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:53.560 
beast series make one last episode to
kind<00:03:50.420> of<00:03:50.480> tie<00:03:50.690> up<00:03:50.840> loose<00:03:50.870> ends<00:03:51.489> and<00:03:52.489> then<00:03:52.670> then

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:53.570 
kind of tie up loose ends and then then

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:55.300 
kind of tie up loose ends and then then
stop<00:03:53.840> that<00:03:54.080> for<00:03:54.560> various<00:03:54.769> reasons<00:03:54.800> which<00:03:55.160> I'll

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
stop that for various reasons which I'll

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.170 
stop that for various reasons which I'll
explain<00:03:55.640> in<00:03:56.150> that<00:03:56.269> video<00:03:57.400> might<00:03:58.400> do<00:03:58.580> some<00:03:58.850> some

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
explain in that video might do some some

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.710 
explain in that video might do some some
tutorials<00:03:59.660> on<00:03:59.780> feed<00:03:59.959> the<00:04:00.080> beast<00:04:00.489> but<00:04:01.489> the<00:04:02.060> what

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 
tutorials on feed the beast but the what

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:03.910 
tutorials on feed the beast but the what
I<00:04:02.750> really<00:04:02.989> want<00:04:03.110> to<00:04:03.140> do<00:04:03.230> is<00:04:03.380> start<00:04:03.560> up<00:04:03.680> a<00:04:03.739> map

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:03.920 
I really want to do is start up a map

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.590 
I really want to do is start up a map
making<00:04:04.130> serious<00:04:04.610> because<00:04:05.390> I<00:04:06.230> learned<00:04:07.010> so<00:04:07.370> much

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:07.600 
making serious because I learned so much

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.960 
making serious because I learned so much
great<00:04:08.600> and<00:04:08.780> stuff<00:04:09.190> building<00:04:10.190> who<00:04:10.310> to<00:04:10.489> figure

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:10.970 
great and stuff building who to figure

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:12.550 
great and stuff building who to figure
some<00:04:11.120> stuff<00:04:11.150> out<00:04:11.420> myself<00:04:11.600> and<00:04:12.110> learn<00:04:12.260> stuff

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
some stuff out myself and learn stuff

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.770 
some stuff out myself and learn stuff
from<00:04:12.590> other<00:04:12.860> map<00:04:13.100> makers<00:04:13.459> and<00:04:13.700> I<00:04:14.420> really<00:04:14.690> like

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
from other map makers and I really like

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.479 
from other map makers and I really like
to<00:04:14.900> share<00:04:15.079> that<00:04:15.200> with<00:04:15.260> you<00:04:15.470> guys<00:04:15.650> so<00:04:16.519> I'm
