00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110 
she said it and then all of a sudden

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.510 
she said it and then all of a sudden
everybody<00:01:58.110> wanted<00:01:58.500> to<00:01:58.590> wear<00:01:58.770> lace<00:01:58.979> friends<00:01:59.399> I

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
everybody wanted to wear lace friends I

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.420 
everybody wanted to wear lace friends I
don't<00:01:59.729> know<00:01:59.850> but<00:02:00.540> um<00:02:00.829> she<00:02:01.829> just<00:02:02.009> happened<00:02:02.340> to

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
don't know but um she just happened to

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.060 
don't know but um she just happened to
have<00:02:02.549> a<00:02:02.610> better<00:02:03.060> stylist<00:02:03.600> then<00:02:03.840> most<00:02:04.560> of<00:02:04.680> us<00:02:04.860> do

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
have a better stylist then most of us do

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.010 
have a better stylist then most of us do
so<00:02:05.310> it<00:02:05.520> will<00:02:05.610> look<00:02:05.640> more<00:02:06.000> natural<00:02:06.420> like<00:02:06.540> yes<00:02:06.750> I

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.800 
so it will look more natural like yes I
don't<00:02:07.229> know<00:02:07.290> how<00:02:07.439> much<00:02:07.590> more<00:02:07.829> to<00:02:07.979> say<00:02:08.160> it<00:02:08.220> um

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.240 
don't know how much more to say it um
like<00:02:09.810> I<00:02:09.989> said<00:02:10.020> I<00:02:10.229> think<00:02:10.379> everybody<00:02:11.009> have<00:02:11.220> their

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
like I said I think everybody have their

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.760 
like I said I think everybody have their
own<00:02:11.459> reason<00:02:12.120> for<00:02:12.660> wearing<00:02:12.810> here

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
own reason for wearing here

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.160 
own reason for wearing here
maybe<00:02:14.130> they<00:02:14.610> can't<00:02:14.880> achieve<00:02:15.000> it<00:02:15.450> so<00:02:15.660> that

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
maybe they can't achieve it so that

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.830 
maybe they can't achieve it so that
aside<00:02:16.470> to<00:02:16.680> weave<00:02:16.890> it<00:02:17.130> maybe<00:02:18.060> they<00:02:18.300> can't<00:02:18.570> grow

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
aside to weave it maybe they can't grow

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
aside to weave it maybe they can't grow
it<00:02:19.050> so<00:02:19.590> they<00:02:19.740> decide<00:02:20.100> to<00:02:20.130> so<00:02:20.580> it<00:02:21.470> may<00:02:22.470> be<00:02:22.650> some

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
it so they decide to so it may be some

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.770
