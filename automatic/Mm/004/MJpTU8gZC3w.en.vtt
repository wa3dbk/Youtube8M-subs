was<00:02:36.280> a<00:02:36.460> superb<00:02:36.970> game<00:02:37.270> for<00:02:37.900> optic<00:02:38.350> gaming

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
was a superb game for optic gaming

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.040 
was a superb game for optic gaming
prophecy<00:02:39.190> was<00:02:39.340> keeping<00:02:39.700> it<00:02:39.820> close<00:02:40.090> as<00:02:40.420> well

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
prophecy was keeping it close as well

but when you have someone dropping fifty
five<00:02:43.480> kills<00:02:43.810> it's<00:02:44.080> very<00:02:44.560> difficult<00:02:44.980> to

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
five kills it's very difficult to

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.630
