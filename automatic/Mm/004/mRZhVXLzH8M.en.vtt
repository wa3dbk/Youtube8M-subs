00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:08.379
 fernandez 

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:08.379
 he wants to advance so fernandez 

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:15.959
 medel want to live 12 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:18.360
 vidal waiting up the rivers at 

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:20.700
 wide and comes to inside is 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:23.009
 destined alexis mati fernandez kills and 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:25.289
 fernandes the short touch for them to come 

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:26.669
 if he wants it, move forward 14 look 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.230
 fernandez touching again towards the 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:31.369
 left the center and pinilla the center 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.369
 and arturo the center and muslera 

00:00:52.589 --> 00:00:56.309
 there is no 10 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.219
 perhaps here in the far version of what 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.140
 that has been previously chiles because 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.900
 was done with receiving the second play 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.750
 and that second ball allows that 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.040
 player who got tired of going and going for the 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.660
 right to supply your peers 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:17.600
 finish the play 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:19.390
 then and a national stadium that screams 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.300
 by island that closed the play very well 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.550
 there is a component of it 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:27.520
 that stands out 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:30.430
 in all the mess the push 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.200
 the 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.869
 to the match 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.420
 things that go beyond the rational and 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:40.810
 that have to do with motivational and 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:44.229
 luke be it this pass here and this space 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:46.179
 there is that I think everything in the goal in 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:48.369
 Valdivia's pass is released when 

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:50.229
 they will mark the release and let it go 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:52.479
 the first control and great definition 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:54.429
 dry down but this I want to highlight 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:55.750
 when everyone was feeling the 

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:58.090
 match 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:01.159
 valdivia was thinking about it and resolved 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:06.140
 well then it serves to mark in 1 to 0 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:08.210
 Chile 10 for this result Chile and in 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.920
 semifinals 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:12.810
 from bolivia but but it looks black uruguay 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.790
 hid only dance remembrance 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:18.590
 if he did not say serrat or maybe mauricio 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.590
 islands by the incidence of this goal 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.860
 is giving the classification but also 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.920
 I want to put in a second step the 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.120
 man who has made the determinations 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.280
 most rational party is called 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.840
 jorge valdivia like this pass for 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.150
 Mauritius and those that because of the incidence in 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.070
 the game that he had for the goal and 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:39.100
 for his very good first time he said it 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:42.170
 as a good figure that will add to that podium 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:45.010
 harang and also also 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.010
 nice weather
