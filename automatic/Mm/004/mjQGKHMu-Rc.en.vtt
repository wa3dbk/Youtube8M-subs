follow it along and very very be very

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:46.199 
follow it along and very very be very
unlikely<00:02:44.739> that<00:02:45.129> this<00:02:45.549> would<00:02:45.760> puncture<00:02:45.970> the

unlikely that this would puncture the

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:49.020 
unlikely that this would puncture the
abdomen<00:02:46.659> so<00:02:46.870> it's<00:02:47.620> got<00:02:47.859> a<00:02:47.889> great<00:02:48.220> utility<00:02:48.790> for

is the reason they call the snipe the

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.580 
is the reason they call the snipe the
