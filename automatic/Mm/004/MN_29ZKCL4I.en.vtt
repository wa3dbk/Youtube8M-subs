have<00:00:34.410> been<00:00:34.620> on<00:00:34.800> what<00:00:35.309> am<00:00:35.399> I<00:00:35.489> missing<00:00:35.550> because

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
have been on what am I missing because

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.510 
have been on what am I missing because
it's<00:00:36.690> unlike<00:00:37.290> anything<00:00:37.590> else<00:00:37.829> I<00:00:38.070> think<00:00:38.100> it

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
it's unlike anything else I think it

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.209 
it's unlike anything else I think it
takes<00:00:38.760> a<00:00:38.879> little<00:00:39.030> while<00:00:39.210> to<00:00:39.420> warm<00:00:39.540> to<00:00:39.780> it<00:00:39.890> or<00:00:40.890> to

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
takes a little while to warm to it or to

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.799 
takes a little while to warm to it or to
kind<00:00:41.520> of<00:00:41.670> understand<00:00:42.420> where<00:00:42.510> it's<00:00:42.690> coming

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
fun so I've been playing basically

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.710 
fun so I've been playing basically
pretty<00:01:07.260> much<00:01:07.409> exclusively<00:01:07.939> the<00:01:08.939> online<00:01:09.420> mode

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
pretty much exclusively the online mode

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.539 
pretty much exclusively the online mode
which<00:01:10.080> kind<00:01:10.320> of<00:01:10.409> boils<00:01:10.680> down<00:01:10.770> to<00:01:11.189> at<00:01:11.460> the

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
which kind of boils down to at the

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.980 
which kind of boils down to at the
moment<00:01:11.760> just<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.650> the<00:01:13.650> turf<00:01:13.890> war<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.990> it's

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
moment just the the turf war and it's

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.530 
moment just the the turf war and it's
like<00:01:16.170> two<00:01:16.439> levels<00:01:16.650> rotated<00:01:17.549> every<00:01:17.880> four<00:01:18.390> hours

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
like two levels rotated every four hours

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.020 
like two levels rotated every four hours
and<00:01:19.110> a<00:01:19.140> change<00:01:19.560> and<00:01:19.770> they<00:01:20.280> got<00:01:20.549> it<00:01:20.729> at<00:01:20.939> the

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
and a change and they got it at the

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.510 
and a change and they got it at the
moment<00:01:21.330> there's<00:01:21.479> five<00:01:21.659> maps<00:01:22.110> and<00:01:22.530> with<00:01:23.400> the

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
moment there's five maps and with the

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.980 
moment there's five maps and with the
game<00:01:23.670> and<00:01:24.150> so<00:01:24.330> you're<00:01:24.450> kind<00:01:24.600> of<00:01:24.630> locked<00:01:24.750> into

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
game and so you're kind of locked into

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.240 
game and so you're kind of locked into
two<00:01:25.200> maps<00:01:25.409> which<00:01:25.650> some<00:01:26.549> people<00:01:27.920> don't<00:01:28.920> like<00:01:29.070> I

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
two maps which some people don't like I

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.830 
two maps which some people don't like I
understand<00:01:30.060> why<00:01:30.210> they're<00:01:30.360> doing<00:01:30.390> it<00:01:30.689> they're

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
understand why they're doing it they're

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.929 
understand why they're doing it they're
basically<00:01:31.229> trying<00:01:31.590> to<00:01:31.829> just<00:01:32.100> kind<00:01:32.579> of<00:01:32.610> spread

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
basically trying to just kind of spread

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.240 
basically trying to just kind of spread
what<00:01:33.689> they've<00:01:33.869> got<00:01:34.049> out<00:01:34.170> and<00:01:34.530> making<00:01:34.890> people

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
what they've got out and making people

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.740 
what they've got out and making people
making<00:01:35.700> sure<00:01:35.820> people<00:01:36.150> don't<00:01:36.240> get<00:01:36.390> burnt<00:01:36.630> out

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
making sure people don't get burnt out

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.249 
making sure people don't get burnt out
on<00:01:36.930> it<00:01:37.079> and<00:01:37.820> the<00:01:38.820> plan<00:01:39.090> is<00:01:39.299> to<00:01:39.329> update<00:01:39.600> it<00:01:40.049> on<00:01:40.200> a

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
on it and the plan is to update it on a

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.740 
on it and the plan is to update it on a
weekly<00:01:40.950> basis<00:01:41.369> image<00:01:41.729> plays<00:01:42.180> with<00:01:42.420> new<00:01:42.540> maps

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
weekly basis image plays with new maps

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.499

considering<00:03:38.310> it's<00:03:38.609> like<00:03:38.819> a<00:03:38.849> team-based

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:39.359 
considering it's like a team-based

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:42.110 
considering it's like a team-based
shooter<00:03:39.569> is<00:03:40.049> that<00:03:40.290> there<00:03:40.709> were<00:03:40.829> no<00:03:41.040> real<00:03:41.280> voice

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
shooter is that there were no real voice

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.640 
shooter is that there were no real voice

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:51.800 
though there's no real party system
either<00:03:49.970> lobby<00:03:50.970> wise<00:03:51.180> you<00:03:51.389> think<00:03:51.540> that's<00:03:51.690> gonna

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
either lobby wise you think that's gonna

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.680 
either lobby wise you think that's gonna
hurt<00:03:52.049> it<00:03:52.260> at<00:03:52.380> all<00:03:52.819> at<00:03:53.819> the<00:03:53.970> moment<00:03:54.000> it<00:03:54.450> doesn't

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
hurt it at all at the moment it doesn't

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.180 
hurt it at all at the moment it doesn't
feel<00:03:54.959> like<00:03:55.019> a<00:03:55.139> bit<00:03:55.319> of<00:03:55.380> a<00:03:55.410> weird<00:03:55.620> omission<00:03:56.010> I

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
feel like a bit of a weird omission I

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.370 
feel like a bit of a weird omission I
think<00:03:56.609> from<00:03:57.120> what<00:03:57.239> I<00:03:57.269> understand<00:03:57.720> the<00:03:57.930> August

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
think from what I understand the August

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.770 
think from what I understand the August

omission<00:04:40.810> I<00:04:40.870> do<00:04:41.020> understand<00:04:41.470> why<00:04:41.650> they've

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:41.890 
omission I do understand why they've

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:45.450 
omission I do understand why they've
done<00:04:42.070> it<00:04:42.220> and<00:04:42.400> and<00:04:43.390> I<00:04:44.110> think<00:04:44.950> there's<00:04:45.160> a<00:04:45.220> really

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:45.460 
done it and and I think there's a really

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.700 
done it and and I think there's a really
tactical<00:04:46.090> going<00:04:46.330> there<00:04:46.540> in<00:04:46.810> splatoon<00:04:47.290> which

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:47.710 
tactical going there in splatoon which

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.610 
tactical going there in splatoon which
isn't<00:04:48.040> quite<00:04:48.430> being<00:04:48.960> unleashed<00:04:49.960> yet<00:04:50.230> because

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620 
isn't quite being unleashed yet because

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.350 
isn't quite being unleashed yet because
of<00:04:50.740> the<00:04:50.800> voice<00:04:50.920> limit<00:04:51.280> restrictions<00:04:51.400> but<00:04:52.150> in

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:52.360 
of the voice limit restrictions but in

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.570 
of the voice limit restrictions but in
its<00:04:52.510> place<00:04:52.720> there's<00:04:53.080> a<00:04:53.140> and<00:04:53.560> I<00:04:53.920> think<00:04:54.490> the

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580 
its place there's a and I think the

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:56.580 
its place there's a and I think the
matchmaking<00:04:55.000> is<00:04:55.240> quite<00:04:55.420> interesting<00:04:56.260> in

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:56.590 
matchmaking is quite interesting in

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:58.860 
matchmaking is quite interesting in
splatoon<00:04:56.800> you<00:04:57.100> never<00:04:57.310> get<00:04:57.550> it<00:04:58.330> balances<00:04:58.780> the

00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:58.870 
splatoon you never get it balances the

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:00.320 
splatoon you never get it balances the
team's<00:04:59.080> out<00:04:59.230> in<00:04:59.380> terms<00:04:59.590> of<00:04:59.710> weapons<00:05:00.010> I<00:05:00.160> think

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
team's out in terms of weapons I think

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.300 
team's out in terms of weapons I think
and<00:05:01.330> does<00:05:01.750> it<00:05:01.900> quite<00:05:02.080> well<00:05:02.110> I've<00:05:02.710> never<00:05:02.920> I've

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:03.310 
and does it quite well I've never I've

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:04.890 
and does it quite well I've never I've
never<00:05:03.580> come<00:05:03.760> across<00:05:03.880> a<00:05:04.060> team<00:05:04.330> of<00:05:04.450> like<00:05:04.660> four

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:04.900 
never come across a team of like four

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.170 
never come across a team of like four
rollers<00:05:05.320> and<00:05:05.640> I've<00:05:06.640> never<00:05:06.850> been<00:05:07.000> outnumbered

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:07.180 
rollers and I've never been outnumbered

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.120 
rollers and I've never been outnumbered
or<00:05:07.540> outgunned<00:05:07.690> ring<00:05:08.110> like<00:05:08.290> that<00:05:08.470> and<00:05:08.890> so<00:05:09.100> I

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:09.130 
or outgunned ring like that and so I

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:11.430 
or outgunned ring like that and so I
think<00:05:09.660> it<00:05:10.660> doesn't<00:05:10.900> have<00:05:10.990> the<00:05:11.080> boys<00:05:11.230> chat

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:11.440 
think it doesn't have the boys chat

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:12.810 
think it doesn't have the boys chat
stuff<00:05:11.650> or<00:05:11.770> no<00:05:11.860> but<00:05:11.980> the<00:05:12.070> matchmaking<00:05:12.490> stuff

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:12.820 
stuff or no but the matchmaking stuff

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:16.560 
stuff or no but the matchmaking stuff
basically<00:05:13.440> it<00:05:14.440> already<00:05:14.940> composes<00:05:15.940> teams<00:05:16.300> that

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:16.570 
basically it already composes teams that

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:18.360 
basically it already composes teams that
work<00:05:16.750> will<00:05:17.230> directly<00:05:17.919> work<00:05:18.130> quite<00:05:18.340> well

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:18.370 
work will directly work quite well

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:19.890 
work will directly work quite well
together<00:05:18.610> I've<00:05:19.180> got<00:05:19.360> a<00:05:19.390> problem<00:05:19.570> with<00:05:19.720> much

for me to stick with it I'm quite I pass

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:06.570

over<00:06:03.310> games<00:06:03.610> really<00:06:03.910> quick<00:06:04.300> so<00:06:05.100> possibly<00:06:06.100> I

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:06.580 
over games really quick so possibly I

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:09.420

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:13.140 
you know I'm probably won't play this
much<00:06:09.840> unless<00:06:10.840> they<00:06:11.230> do<00:06:11.290> regularly<00:06:11.860> add<00:06:12.610> to<00:06:13.000> it

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:13.150

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:14.730 
much unless they do regularly add to it
I<00:06:13.300> think<00:06:13.660> you<00:06:14.080> said<00:06:14.260> there's<00:06:14.410> going<00:06:14.530> to<00:06:14.590> be<00:06:14.650> an

I think you said there's going to be an

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:16.770 
I think you said there's going to be an
August<00:06:15.070> update<00:06:15.220> and<00:06:15.700> the<00:06:15.820> ranked<00:06:16.180> matches<00:06:16.450> are

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:18.760 
coming soon so if it keeps building

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:21.090 
coming soon so if it keeps building
content<00:06:19.450> it<00:06:19.630> will<00:06:19.690> keep<00:06:19.930> me<00:06:20.200> more<00:06:20.440> keep<00:06:20.980> me

content it will keep me more keep me
more<00:06:21.280> interested<00:06:21.550> but<00:06:22.120> if<00:06:22.270> it<00:06:22.390> sticks<00:06:22.690> as<00:06:23.020> it

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:23.680 
more interested but if it sticks as it

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:28.470 
more interested but if it sticks as it
is<00:06:23.830> and<00:06:24.630> it's<00:06:25.630> just<00:06:25.930> a<00:06:26.500> nice<00:06:27.400> way<00:06:27.670> to<00:06:27.700> do<00:06:27.940> short

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.930 
sweet matches every soft and I'll
probably<00:06:30.760> dive<00:06:31.240> into<00:06:31.540> it<00:06:32.040> you<00:06:33.040> know<00:06:33.160> not<00:06:33.700> so

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:33.940 
probably dive into it you know not so

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:35.820 
probably dive into it you know not so
regularly<00:06:34.390> like<00:06:34.600> like<00:06:34.840> I<00:06:34.900> do<00:06:35.080> Mario<00:06:35.440> Kart<00:06:35.740> I

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:35.830

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:40.240 
bursts every now and again I think it's

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:41.730 
bursts every now and again I think it's
been<00:06:40.420> designed<00:06:40.720> it's<00:06:41.140> been<00:06:41.260> designed<00:06:41.530> like

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:41.740 
been designed it's been designed like

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:43.290 
been designed it's been designed like
that<00:06:41.890> as<00:06:41.980> well<00:06:42.130> it's<00:06:42.280> not<00:06:42.400> a<00:06:42.460> game<00:06:42.700> this<00:06:43.000> isn't

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:43.300 
that as well it's not a game this isn't

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:45.960 
that as well it's not a game this isn't
like<00:06:43.540> an<00:06:43.780> MMO<00:06:44.500> on<00:06:45.160> my<00:06:45.310> shoes<00:06:45.580> where<00:06:45.850> you

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:45.970 
like an MMO on my shoes where you

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:47.970 
like an MMO on my shoes where you
basically<00:06:46.180> play<00:06:47.140> the<00:06:47.170> weekend<00:06:47.650> unless<00:06:47.800> you

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:52.000 
like me and the way the loop works and

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.370 
like me and the way the loop works and
the<00:06:52.090> way<00:06:52.180> the<00:06:52.300> leveling<00:06:52.630> works<00:06:52.840> and<00:06:53.170> the<00:06:53.350> way
