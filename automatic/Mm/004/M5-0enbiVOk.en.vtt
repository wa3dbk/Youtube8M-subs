there<00:02:19.040> goes

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:24.660 

some<00:02:23.680> of<00:02:23.770> you<00:02:23.860> have<00:02:23.890> probably<00:02:24.070> already<00:02:24.340> heard

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
some of you have probably already heard

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.310 
some of you have probably already heard
this<00:02:24.910> but<00:02:25.290> for<00:02:26.290> those<00:02:26.470> of<00:02:26.530> you<00:02:26.770> all<00:02:26.800> who<00:02:26.950> having

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
this but for those of you all who having

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.560 
this but for those of you all who having
this<00:02:29.320> is<00:02:29.500> a<00:02:29.530> nice<00:02:29.860> one<00:02:30.280> to<00:02:30.640> have<00:02:30.850> in<00:02:31.210> your

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:31.570 
this is a nice one to have in your

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:36.750 
this is a nice one to have in your
library<00:02:32.200> so<00:02:33.130> here<00:02:33.310> we<00:02:33.340> go<00:02:34.770> B<00:02:35.770> flat<00:02:36.130> on<00:02:36.400> the<00:02:36.550> base

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
library so here we go B flat on the base

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.810 
library so here we go B flat on the base
a<00:02:37.120> flat<00:02:38.110> D<00:02:38.590> flat<00:02:38.620> if<00:02:39.460> it's<00:02:40.000> the<00:02:40.120> first<00:02:40.360> core

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
a flat D flat if it's the first core

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.340 
a flat D flat if it's the first core
eight<00:02:42.820> flat<00:02:43.150> on<00:02:43.270> the<00:02:43.390> bigs<00:02:43.600> going<00:02:43.840> down<00:02:43.960> whole

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
eight flat on the bigs going down whole

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:48.630 
eight flat on the bigs going down whole
steps<00:02:44.680> a<00:02:44.890> flat<00:02:45.820> on<00:02:46.060> the<00:02:46.240> base<00:02:46.420> B<00:02:47.320> flat<00:02:47.650> E<00:02:47.950> flat<00:02:48.250> G

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
steps a flat on the base B flat E flat G

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.059 
steps a flat on the base B flat E flat G
so

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:03:00.140 

G<00:02:53.969> flat<00:02:54.239> on<00:02:54.420> the<00:02:54.540> base<00:02:55.189> B<00:02:56.189> II<00:02:56.459> a<00:02:57.329> flat<00:02:59.150> alright

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
G flat on the base B II a flat alright

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:06.300 
G flat on the base B II a flat alright
so

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:14.230
