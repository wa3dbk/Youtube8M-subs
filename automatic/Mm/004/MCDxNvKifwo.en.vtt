00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.900
 So... 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:46.900
 ...what you think? 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.700
 It's a lot to think about, boy ... 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.500
 I do not even know where to start. 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.600
 You have been out of the game for a long time. 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.500
 Maybe you need to be reminded of the kind of people we're going to cross. 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.400
 Sully I know the risks ... 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.600
 but come on, it's a quick and simple plan. 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.000
 puff..if .. 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.160
 If there is one thing that I have learned in these years, it is that there is no quick and simple plan. 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:24.480
 I really do not have an option .. 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:26.000
 you know it. 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.520
 If maybe you're right I've been out of the game but ... I need to go back. 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.100
 So I'm counting on you? 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.240
 One last time? 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:46.080
 Very good child ... 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:48.320
 let's do it. 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.480
 One last time.....
