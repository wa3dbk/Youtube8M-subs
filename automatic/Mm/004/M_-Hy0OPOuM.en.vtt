00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.210 
I only started with thousand at the tops

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:29.130 
I only started with thousand at the tops
and<00:02:26.550> then<00:02:27.550> immediately<00:02:28.120> run<00:02:28.420> down<00:02:28.690> to<00:02:29.110> the

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
and then immediately run down to the

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.950 
and then immediately run down to the
nearest<00:02:29.440> roulette<00:02:30.010> wheel<00:02:30.220> or<00:02:30.640> a<00:02:30.700> slots<00:02:31.270> game<00:02:31.630> I

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:31.960 
nearest roulette wheel or a slots game I

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.740 
nearest roulette wheel or a slots game I
wouldn't<00:02:32.860> suggest<00:02:33.130> blackjack<00:02:33.910> because<00:02:34.570> it's

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
wouldn't suggest blackjack because it's

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.900 
wouldn't suggest blackjack because it's
slow<00:02:35.430> if<00:02:36.430> you're<00:02:36.670> at<00:02:36.880> like<00:02:37.150> I<00:02:37.920> don't<00:02:38.920> know<00:02:39.130> say

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
slow if you're at like I don't know say

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.730 
slow if you're at like I don't know say
you're<00:02:40.270> at<00:02:40.420> the<00:02:40.540> tops<00:02:40.810> you<00:02:41.230> get<00:02:41.380> banned<00:02:41.560> at

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:41.740 
you're at the tops you get banned at

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:45.050 
you're at the tops you get banned at
10,000<00:02:42.430> and<00:02:42.580> you're<00:02:43.180> at<00:02:43.300> like<00:02:43.510> nine<00:02:44.110> thousand

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
10,000 and you're at like nine thousand

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.550 
10,000 and you're at like nine thousand
then<00:02:46.060> blackjack<00:02:46.660> would<00:02:46.840> be<00:02:46.960> the<00:02:47.080> way<00:02:47.290> to<00:02:47.320> go

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
then blackjack would be the way to go

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:48.900 
then blackjack would be the way to go
because<00:02:47.800> you<00:02:48.010> don't<00:02:48.160> have<00:02:48.280> to<00:02:48.460> keep<00:02:48.640> waiting

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
because you don't have to keep waiting

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:53.830 
because you don't have to keep waiting
for<00:02:49.210> a<00:02:49.240> lucky<00:02:50.520> lucky<00:02:51.520> draw<00:02:51.940> I<00:02:52.239> guess

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
for a lucky lucky draw I guess

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.229 
for a lucky lucky draw I guess
so<00:02:54.440> you<00:02:54.500> go<00:02:54.920> down<00:02:55.130> to<00:02:55.310> the<00:02:55.430> roulette<00:02:55.670> wheel<00:02:55.730> and

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
so you go down to the roulette wheel and

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:00.130 
so you go down to the roulette wheel and
you<00:02:56.900> bet<00:02:57.590> on<00:02:57.800> some<00:02:58.430> really<00:02:59.330> stupid<00:02:59.599> number

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
you bet on some really stupid number

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.140 
you bet on some really stupid number
that<00:03:00.440> you<00:03:01.130> just<00:03:01.310> know<00:03:01.550> you'll<00:03:01.790> lose<00:03:01.940> your

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
that you just know you'll lose your

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.910 
that you just know you'll lose your
chips<00:03:02.450> I<00:03:04.360> would<00:03:05.360> recommend<00:03:05.840> double<00:03:06.200> zero<00:03:06.500> or

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
chips I would recommend double zero or

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.630 
chips I would recommend double zero or
zero<00:03:08.620> or<00:03:09.620> some<00:03:09.860> other<00:03:10.010> it<00:03:10.280> doesn't<00:03:10.459> really

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
zero or some other it doesn't really

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.850 
zero or some other it doesn't really
matter<00:03:10.910> what<00:03:11.180> number<00:03:11.540> you<00:03:11.569> pick<00:03:11.870> just<00:03:12.470> pick<00:03:12.830> a

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
matter what number you pick just pick a

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.670 
matter what number you pick just pick a
certain<00:03:13.130> number<00:03:13.459> and<00:03:13.849> then<00:03:14.630> bet<00:03:15.260> all<00:03:15.440> your

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
certain number and then bet all your

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.770 
certain number and then bet all your
chips<00:03:15.890> away<00:03:16.069> so<00:03:16.580> if<00:03:16.880> you<00:03:17.000> buy<00:03:17.120> a<00:03:17.150> thousand<00:03:17.690> you

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
chips away so if you buy a thousand you

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:23.880 
chips away so if you buy a thousand you
have<00:03:18.370> 500<00:03:19.370> rolls<00:03:19.580> or<00:03:19.970> five<00:03:20.930> rolls<00:03:21.519> and<00:03:22.519> then

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890 
have 500 rolls or five rolls and then

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.740 
have 500 rolls or five rolls and then
just<00:03:24.890> load<00:03:25.130> it<00:03:25.160> up<00:03:25.430> if<00:03:25.610> you<00:03:25.700> don't<00:03:25.910> win<00:03:26.150> looks
