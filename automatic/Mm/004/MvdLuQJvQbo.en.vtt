00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:21.250 
let's get right into it here coming to

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:23.160 
let's get right into it here coming to
number<00:00:21.490> 5<00:00:21.700> we're<00:00:22.090> gonna<00:00:22.180> have<00:00:22.390> the<00:00:22.600> Nexus

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:23.170 
number 5 we're gonna have the Nexus

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:25.890 
number 5 we're gonna have the Nexus
which<00:00:23.380> i<00:00:23.680> think<00:00:24.040> is<00:00:24.280> a<00:00:24.400> really<00:00:24.970> nice<00:00:25.510> server

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:25.900 
which i think is a really nice server

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.230 
which i think is a really nice server
the<00:00:26.590> only<00:00:26.800> downside<00:00:27.340> of<00:00:27.370> the<00:00:27.700> server<00:00:27.940> it<00:00:28.090> is

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:28.240 
the only downside of the server it is

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.050 
the only downside of the server it is
the<00:00:28.900> fact<00:00:29.110> that<00:00:29.289> they<00:00:29.800> have<00:00:30.280> some<00:00:30.490> bugs<00:00:30.730> and

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:31.060 
the fact that they have some bugs and

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:32.459 
the fact that they have some bugs and
they<00:00:31.180> really<00:00:31.480> haven't<00:00:31.690> got<00:00:31.990> straightened<00:00:32.379> out

00:00:32.459 --> 00:00:32.469 
they really haven't got straightened out

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:34.830 
they really haven't got straightened out
yet<00:00:32.710> which<00:00:32.890> you<00:00:33.670> know<00:00:33.760> if<00:00:34.000> you<00:00:34.149> got<00:00:34.239> bugs

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:34.840 
yet which you know if you got bugs

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.080 
yet which you know if you got bugs
you<00:00:35.170> should<00:00:35.320> probably<00:00:35.469> figure<00:00:35.710> them<00:00:35.890> out<00:00:36.090> but

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:37.090 
you should probably figure them out but

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.000 
you should probably figure them out but
like<00:00:37.510> I<00:00:37.630> said<00:00:37.690> otherwise<00:00:38.410> the<00:00:38.710> server<00:00:38.920> is

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.010 
like I said otherwise the server is

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.160 
like I said otherwise the server is
really<00:00:39.370> nice<00:00:39.520> this<00:00:40.390> one<00:00:40.630> is<00:00:40.780> a<00:00:40.810> little<00:00:40.960> bit

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:41.170 
really nice this one is a little bit

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.040 
really nice this one is a little bit
laggy<00:00:41.380> as<00:00:41.620> well<00:00:41.829> not<00:00:42.700> too<00:00:43.030> too<00:00:43.450> bad<00:00:43.630> but<00:00:44.020> you

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:44.050 
laggy as well not too too bad but you

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.380 
laggy as well not too too bad but you
know<00:00:44.290> a<00:00:44.500> little<00:00:44.800> laggy<00:00:45.090> but<00:00:46.090> when<00:00:46.210> you're<00:00:46.329> in

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:46.390 
know a little laggy but when you're in

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.600 
know a little laggy but when you're in
game<00:00:46.570> everything's<00:00:46.899> fine<00:00:47.250> as<00:00:48.250> you<00:00:48.370> can<00:00:48.489> see

coming<00:01:14.499> in<00:01:14.799> at<00:01:14.979> number<00:01:15.249> four<00:01:15.850> we<00:01:16.030> have<00:01:16.060> the

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.450 
coming in at number four we have the

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.559 
coming in at number four we have the
high<00:01:16.780> pixel<00:01:17.619> server<00:01:17.920> which<00:01:18.729> you<00:01:19.029> know<00:01:19.209> this

00:01:19.559 --> 00:01:19.569 
high pixel server which you know this

00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:22.469 
high pixel server which you know this
server<00:01:19.840> is<00:01:20.200> really<00:01:20.979> really<00:01:21.399> nice<00:01:21.639> I<00:01:21.939> would

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:22.479 
server is really really nice I would

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:24.779 
server is really really nice I would
probably<00:01:22.749> rate<00:01:23.139> it<00:01:23.289> a<00:01:23.350> little<00:01:23.619> bit<00:01:23.770> higher<00:01:24.039> if

00:01:24.779 --> 00:01:24.789 
probably rate it a little bit higher if

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:27.389 
probably rate it a little bit higher if
there<00:01:25.090> wasn't<00:01:25.389> some<00:01:25.659> way<00:01:26.229> way<00:01:26.740> better<00:01:26.979> servers

00:01:27.389 --> 00:01:27.399 
there wasn't some way way better servers

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:29.429 
there wasn't some way way better servers
in<00:01:27.520> this<00:01:27.700> but<00:01:28.479> this<00:01:28.600> is<00:01:28.810> you<00:01:29.020> know<00:01:29.139> still<00:01:29.380> a

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:29.439 
in this but this is you know still a

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:31.859 
in this but this is you know still a
really<00:01:29.859> good<00:01:29.950> server<00:01:30.539> one<00:01:31.539> of<00:01:31.600> the<00:01:31.689> main

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:31.869 
really good server one of the main

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:33.480 
really good server one of the main
reasons<00:01:32.259> it<00:01:32.469> is<00:01:32.499> number<00:01:32.859> 4<00:01:33.039> though<00:01:33.159> is<00:01:33.310> because

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
reasons it is number 4 though is because

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.639 
reasons it is number 4 though is because
it's<00:01:33.639> not<00:01:33.700> exactly<00:01:34.109> focused<00:01:35.109> around<00:01:35.259> hard

00:01:35.639 --> 00:01:35.649 
it's not exactly focused around hard

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:37.800 
it's not exactly focused around hard
games<00:01:35.859> as<00:01:36.819> you<00:01:37.029> can<00:01:37.149> see<00:01:37.270> they<00:01:37.450> have<00:01:37.539> a<00:01:37.569> bunch

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
games as you can see they have a bunch

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.499 
games as you can see they have a bunch
of<00:01:37.840> other<00:01:38.020> things<00:01:38.229> like<00:01:38.499> the<00:01:39.219> walls<00:01:39.520> vampires

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:40.509 
of other things like the walls vampires

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:44.039 
of other things like the walls vampires
ee<00:01:41.130> they<00:01:42.130> have<00:01:42.310> like<00:01:42.459> paintball<00:01:43.029> they<00:01:43.869> have

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:44.049 
ee they have like paintball they have

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:45.809 
ee they have like paintball they have
all<00:01:44.170> kinds<00:01:44.499> of<00:01:44.619> you<00:01:44.920> know<00:01:44.979> other<00:01:45.099> other<00:01:45.429> game

00:01:45.809 --> 00:01:45.819

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:48.779 
all kinds of you know other other game
types<00:01:45.849> so<00:01:46.719> it's<00:01:46.869> not<00:01:46.959> really<00:01:47.259> focused<00:01:47.979> just<00:01:48.219> on

00:01:48.779 --> 00:01:48.789 
types so it's not really focused just on

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:50.609 
types so it's not really focused just on
home<00:01:48.969> games<00:01:49.209> but<00:01:49.450> the<00:01:49.630> home<00:01:49.749> games<00:01:49.990> is<00:01:50.229> pretty

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:50.619 
home games but the home games is pretty

home games but the home games is pretty
nice<00:01:51.009> in<00:01:51.189> the<00:01:51.279> server<00:01:51.490> very<00:01:52.479> little<00:01:52.779> die

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
nice in the server very little die

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.499

you<00:02:12.240> on<00:02:12.360> the<00:02:12.450> server<00:02:12.660> just<00:02:12.900> a<00:02:13.050> little<00:02:13.410> bit

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
you on the server just a little bit

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.700 
you on the server just a little bit
yelling<00:02:13.770> go<00:02:13.920> to<00:02:13.980> spawn<00:02:14.930> it's<00:02:15.930> not<00:02:16.110> very<00:02:16.440> laggy

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
yelling go to spawn it's not very laggy

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.980 
yelling go to spawn it's not very laggy
I<00:02:16.920> would<00:02:17.100> say<00:02:17.310> but<00:02:17.820> you<00:02:17.880> know<00:02:18.030> once<00:02:18.480> again<00:02:18.600> a

I would say but you know once again a

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:22.670 
I would say but you know once again a
little<00:02:19.200> bit<00:02:20.090> chunky<00:02:21.090> to<00:02:21.420> load<00:02:21.570> in<00:02:21.690> here<00:02:21.840> as<00:02:22.560> you

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
little bit chunky to load in here as you

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.240 
little bit chunky to load in here as you
can<00:02:22.800> see<00:02:22.920> here<00:02:23.130> is<00:02:23.310> very<00:02:23.940> very<00:02:24.270> nice<00:02:24.540> I<00:02:24.810> mean

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
can see here is very very nice I mean

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.790 
can see here is very very nice I mean
good<00:02:26.250> good<00:02:26.940> spawn<00:02:27.240> like<00:02:27.930> I<00:02:27.960> said<00:02:28.170> mostly<00:02:28.530> good

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
good good spawn like I said mostly good

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.690 
good good spawn like I said mostly good
community<00:02:29.220> and<00:02:30.440> so<00:02:31.440> that's<00:02:32.190> why<00:02:32.400> I<00:02:32.430> picked

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
community and so that's why I picked

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.010 
community and so that's why I picked
this<00:02:32.790> for<00:02:32.850> number<00:02:33.150> 4<00:02:33.390> it<00:02:33.480> like<00:02:33.600> I<00:02:33.720> said<00:02:33.780> it

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
this for number 4 it like I said it

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.660 
this for number 4 it like I said it
probably<00:02:34.140> a<00:02:34.380> little<00:02:34.590> bit<00:02:34.770> higher<00:02:34.950> if<00:02:35.250> there

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
probably a little bit higher if there

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.570 
probably a little bit higher if there
wasn't<00:02:35.970> such<00:02:36.240> you<00:02:36.720> know<00:02:36.840> good<00:02:37.740> other<00:02:37.980> game

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
wasn't such you know good other game

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.100 
wasn't such you know good other game
servers<00:02:38.910> because<00:02:39.030> this<00:02:39.240> is<00:02:39.390> focused<00:02:39.660> more<00:02:39.960> on

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
servers because this is focused more on

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.290 
servers because this is focused more on
hunger<00:02:40.350> games<00:02:40.590> not<00:02:40.920> just<00:02:40.950> the<00:02:41.700> overall<00:02:41.970> server

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
hunger games not just the overall server

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.810 
hunger games not just the overall server
but<00:02:43.170> if<00:02:43.260> it<00:02:43.350> was<00:02:43.440> just<00:02:43.590> an<00:02:43.830> overall<00:02:44.130> server<00:02:44.400> you

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
but if it was just an overall server you

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.490 
but if it was just an overall server you
know<00:02:44.970> review<00:02:45.360> or<00:02:45.570> top<00:02:45.750> 5<00:02:45.930> I<00:02:46.230> would<00:02:46.290> probably

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
know review or top 5 I would probably

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.220 
know review or top 5 I would probably
pick<00:02:46.770> this<00:02:46.950> you<00:02:47.790> know<00:02:47.880> as<00:02:48.030> like<00:02:48.270> number<00:02:48.900> one<00:02:49.050> so

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
pick this you know as like number one so

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.480 
pick this you know as like number one so
anyway<00:02:50.070> be<00:02:50.640> right<00:02:50.820> back<00:02:51.030> with<00:02:51.510> number<00:02:51.840> three

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:52.490 
anyway be right back with number three

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:55.340 
anyway be right back with number three
coming<00:02:53.490> in<00:02:53.730> at<00:02:53.880> number<00:02:54.360> 3<00:02:54.870> we<00:02:54.900> have<00:02:55.140> the

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
coming in at number 3 we have the

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.410 
coming in at number 3 we have the
mineplex<00:02:55.980> over<00:02:56.460> which<00:02:56.580> I'm<00:02:56.760> sure<00:02:56.940> a<00:02:57.120> lot<00:02:57.390> of

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
mineplex over which I'm sure a lot of

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.840 
mineplex over which I'm sure a lot of
you<00:02:57.600> guys<00:02:57.720> know<00:02:58.260> about<00:02:58.290> this<00:02:58.650> server<00:02:58.920> it's<00:02:59.790> a

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
you guys know about this server it's a

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:01.580 
you guys know about this server it's a
very<00:03:00.120> big<00:03:00.390> server<00:03:00.690> I<00:03:00.840> think<00:03:01.080> you'd<00:03:01.170> hold<00:03:01.350> up<00:03:01.440> to

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
very big server I think you'd hold up to

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.040 
very big server I think you'd hold up to
30,000<00:03:02.490> players<00:03:02.790> so<00:03:03.450> that's<00:03:03.630> just<00:03:03.780> you<00:03:04.020> know

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
30,000 players so that's just you know

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.430 
30,000 players so that's just you know
very<00:03:04.560> huge<00:03:04.980> like<00:03:05.250> I<00:03:05.310> said<00:03:05.540> now<00:03:06.540> the<00:03:07.110> reason

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
very huge like I said now the reason

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.050 
very huge like I said now the reason
this<00:03:07.500> is<00:03:07.680> number<00:03:07.860> three<00:03:08.250> is<00:03:08.460> just<00:03:08.490> due<00:03:08.820> to<00:03:08.850> the

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
this is number three is just due to the

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.790 
this is number three is just due to the
fact<00:03:09.270> that<00:03:09.360> once<00:03:09.600> again<00:03:09.840> this<00:03:10.050> isn't<00:03:10.260> mainly

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
fact that once again this isn't mainly

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.340 
fact that once again this isn't mainly
focused<00:03:11.280> around<00:03:11.400> her<00:03:11.760> games<00:03:12.060> it<00:03:12.870> does<00:03:13.140> have<00:03:13.320> a

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
focused around her games it does have a

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.250 
focused around her games it does have a
really<00:03:13.620> good<00:03:13.860> home<00:03:14.070> game<00:03:14.250> system<00:03:14.750> but<00:03:15.750> it<00:03:16.050> like

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
really good home game system but it like

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.190 
really good home game system but it like
I<00:03:16.350> said<00:03:16.410> not<00:03:16.770> focused<00:03:17.250> so<00:03:17.580> therefore<00:03:18.090> you<00:03:19.080> know

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
I said not focused so therefore you know

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.350 
I said not focused so therefore you know
it's<00:03:19.560> gonna<00:03:19.650> be<00:03:19.800> a<00:03:19.830> little<00:03:19.950> higher<00:03:20.220> but<00:03:20.730> the

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
it's gonna be a little higher but the

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.020 
it's gonna be a little higher but the
server<00:03:21.600> is<00:03:21.810> really<00:03:22.380> really<00:03:22.980> nice<00:03:23.280> they<00:03:23.820> have
