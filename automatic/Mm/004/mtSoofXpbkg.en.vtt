I<00:01:52.200> think<00:01:53.009> I<00:01:53.310> mean<00:01:53.759> I'm<00:01:53.909> perhaps<00:01:54.240> not<00:01:54.720> on<00:01:54.750> the

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
I think I mean I'm perhaps not on the

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.420 
I think I mean I'm perhaps not on the
side<00:01:55.320> of<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.590> nutritionist<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:56.399> the

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
side of the nutritionist and the

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:57.800 
side of the nutritionist and the
dietitians<00:01:57.030> and<00:01:57.149> is<00:01:57.240> as<00:01:57.390> you<00:01:57.509> can<00:01:57.540> probably

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
dietitians and is as you can probably

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.889 
dietitians and is as you can probably
see<00:01:58.049> which<00:01:58.950> is<00:01:59.159> that<00:01:59.369> I<00:01:59.399> think<00:01:59.909> a<00:02:00.240> little<00:02:00.780> bit

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
see which is that I think a little bit

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.690 
see which is that I think a little bit
of<00:02:00.990> fat<00:02:01.200> gives<00:02:01.469> flavor<00:02:01.829> and<00:02:02.219> it<00:02:02.310> keeps<00:02:02.520> your

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
of fat gives flavor and it keeps your

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:03.410 
of fat gives flavor and it keeps your

skin soft
I<00:02:03.509> always<00:02:03.689> think<00:02:03.899> people<00:02:04.200> on<00:02:04.290> low-fat<00:02:04.710> diets

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
I always think people on low-fat diets

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.649 
I always think people on low-fat diets
always<00:02:05.820> look<00:02:06.030> like<00:02:06.060> they<00:02:06.329> have<00:02:06.450> very

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
always look like they have very

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.459 
always look like they have very
desiccated<00:02:07.290> anxious<00:02:08.069> cobbles
