actual parts that we're going to use out

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.300 
actual parts that we're going to use out
of<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:17.970> kit<00:01:18.180> I<00:01:18.420> would<00:01:19.049> remove<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.619> spacer<00:01:20.130> and

fashion however you like to work just

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.390 
fashion however you like to work just
make<00:01:23.729> sure<00:01:23.880> it<00:01:23.939> doesn't<00:01:24.060> bind<00:01:24.920> we<00:01:25.920> had<00:01:26.100> ground

it fit secure against the steering

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:43.880 
it fit secure against the steering
column<00:01:37.110> and<00:01:37.229> looks<00:01:37.799> a<00:01:37.890> lot<00:01:38.070> neater<00:01:38.220> -<00:01:42.890> inside
