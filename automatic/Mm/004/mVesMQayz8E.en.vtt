ncess it puts a border around it
three<00:01:37.090> pixels<00:01:37.750> wide<00:01:37.960> like<00:01:38.649> the<00:01:38.770> one<00:01:38.920> in<00:01:38.950> my

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:39.189 
three pixels wide like the one in my

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:45.330 
three pixels wide like the one in my
post<00:01:42.329> and<00:01:43.329> it<00:01:43.479> centers<00:01:43.780> it<00:01:43.929> as<00:01:44.049> well<00:01:44.340> don't

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
post and it centers it as well don't

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.150 
post and it centers it as well don't
have<00:01:45.520> to<00:01:45.640> use<00:01:45.759> the<00:01:45.880> center<00:01:46.210> roll

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:50.160 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.160 

and<00:01:51.160> it<00:01:51.340> pushed<00:01:51.550> to<00:01:51.670> the<00:01:51.820> margin<00:01:52.630> on<00:01:52.840> the<00:01:52.960> top

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
and it pushed to the margin on the top

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.050 
and it pushed to the margin on the top
side<00:01:53.380> so<00:01:53.620> its<00:01:53.770> paces<00:01:54.160> it<00:01:54.280> out<00:01:54.400> enough<00:01:54.670> for<00:01:54.910> it's

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
side so its paces it out enough for it's

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.640 
side so its paces it out enough for it's
not<00:01:55.240> close<00:01:55.540> you<00:01:55.780> don't<00:01:55.960> have<00:01:56.050> to<00:01:56.140> pre<00:01:56.350> break

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:56.650 
not close you don't have to pre break

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:21.850 
not close you don't have to pre break
something<00:01:57.190> install<00:01:57.970> automatic

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.210 

think<00:02:22.860> eventually<00:02:23.069> what<00:02:23.790> I'm<00:02:23.879> going<00:02:24.000> to<00:02:24.030> do

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
think eventually what I'm going to do

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.070 
think eventually what I'm going to do
seems<00:02:26.220> like<00:02:26.340> it<00:02:26.459> better<00:02:26.610> at<00:02:26.790> PHP<00:02:27.090> programming

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
seems like it better at PHP programming

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.150 
seems like it better at PHP programming
real<00:02:28.470> down<00:02:29.400> their<00:02:29.610> language
