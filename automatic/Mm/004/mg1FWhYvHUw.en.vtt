and here's the startup of the car after

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:07.150 
and here's the startup of the car after
my<00:00:04.830> exhaust<00:00:05.400> has<00:00:05.549> been<00:00:05.879> modified<00:00:06.660> and

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:07.160 
my exhaust has been modified and

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.860 
my exhaust has been modified and
installed<00:00:08.160> I'm<00:00:08.940> now<00:00:09.210> in<00:00:09.360> the<00:00:09.450> parking<00:00:09.719> lot<00:00:09.840> of

installed I'm now in the parking lot of
mcdonalds<00:00:10.050> and<00:00:10.500> I'm<00:00:10.590> about<00:00:10.740> to<00:00:10.800> start<00:00:10.950> the<00:00:11.250> car

mcdonalds and I'm about to start the car

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:25.550 
mcdonalds and I'm about to start the car
and<00:00:11.660> proceed<00:00:12.660> to<00:00:12.690> drive<00:00:12.960> away<00:00:24.260> we<00:00:25.260> are<00:00:25.320> now

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
and proceed to drive away we are now

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:34.630 
and proceed to drive away we are now
currently<00:00:25.890> idling<00:00:26.490> just<00:00:26.730> below<00:00:28.310> 1000<00:00:29.310> rpm<00:00:29.730> and

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:34.640 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:46.410 

we're<00:00:35.640> now<00:00:35.850> about<00:00:36.090> to<00:00:36.390> reverse

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:46.420 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.700 

and<00:00:47.420> we're<00:00:47.600> waiting<00:00:47.750> for<00:00:48.019> somebody<00:00:48.230> to<00:00:48.410> back

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
and we're waiting for somebody to back

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.779 
and we're waiting for somebody to back
out<00:00:48.920> i<00:00:48.949> guess<00:00:49.129> because<00:00:49.489> they<00:00:49.640> don't<00:00:50.769> see<00:00:51.789> that

00:00:52.779 --> 00:00:52.789 
out i guess because they don't see that

00:00:52.789 --> 00:01:24.980 
out i guess because they don't see that
I<00:00:52.879> am<00:00:53.300> trying<00:00:53.750> to<00:00:53.839> leave<00:00:53.989> as<00:00:54.140> well

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:46.850 

ah

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.870 

now<00:01:47.860> I'm<00:01:47.979> making<00:01:48.100> a<00:01:48.340> left<00:01:48.580> on<00:01:48.810> to<00:01:50.100> warden<00:01:51.100> going

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
now I'm making a left on to warden going

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:59.490 
now I'm making a left on to warden going
south<00:01:52.270> from<00:01:52.810> highway<00:01:53.260> 7<00:01:55.710> and<00:01:57.030> I<00:01:58.030> can<00:01:58.450> see<00:01:58.659> the

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
south from highway 7 and I can see the

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.139 
south from highway 7 and I can see the
traffic<00:01:59.770> lights<00:02:00.100> of<00:02:00.220> change<00:02:00.659> on<00:02:01.950> Ward<00:02:02.950> and<00:02:03.220> so

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:04.149 
traffic lights of change on Ward and so

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:30.009 
traffic lights of change on Ward and so
I<00:02:04.540> won't<00:02:05.350> be<00:02:05.409> able<00:02:05.500> to<00:02:05.649> go<00:02:05.770> full<00:02:06.040> throttle

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:30.019 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:48.229 

okay<00:02:31.019> we're<00:02:31.319> about<00:02:31.469> to<00:02:31.799> go<00:02:31.950> full<00:02:32.310> throttle

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:52.350 

we're<00:02:49.239> already<00:02:49.390> doing<00:02:49.690> 80<00:02:50.200> kilometers<00:02:51.209> so<00:02:52.209> I'm

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
we're already doing 80 kilometers so I'm

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.759 
we're already doing 80 kilometers so I'm
just<00:02:52.569> holding<00:02:52.720> back<00:02:53.019> because<00:02:53.230> there's<00:02:53.530> a<00:02:53.620> red

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:53.769 
just holding back because there's a red

00:02:53.769 --> 00:03:14.260 
just holding back because there's a red
light<00:02:53.980> up<00:02:54.129> ahead

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:14.270 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:19.720 

full<00:03:15.270> throttle<00:03:16.340> second<00:03:17.340> gear

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.460 

third<00:03:20.239> gear

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.950 

fourth<00:03:23.100> year<00:03:23.520> and<00:03:23.850> I<00:03:24.000> held<00:03:24.240> it<00:03:24.360> up<00:03:24.480> at<00:03:24.630> 80

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:24.960 
fourth year and I held it up at 80

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.440 
fourth year and I held it up at 80
kilometers<00:03:25.700> don't<00:03:26.700> want<00:03:26.940> any<00:03:27.090> speeding

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
kilometers don't want any speeding

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:32.350 
kilometers don't want any speeding
tickets

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.060 

now<00:03:32.900> in<00:03:33.080> fifth<00:03:33.350> gear<00:03:33.680> just<00:03:34.610> over<00:03:34.850> 2,000<00:03:35.360> rpms

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.070 
now in fifth gear just over 2,000 rpms

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:40.570 
now in fifth gear just over 2,000 rpms
so<00:03:37.070> it's<00:03:37.220> actually<00:03:37.310> quite<00:03:37.670> quiet<00:03:39.580> depending

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:40.580 
so it's actually quite quiet depending

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:44.280 
so it's actually quite quiet depending
on<00:03:40.670> the<00:03:40.910> RPMs<00:03:41.390> if<00:03:41.780> you've<00:03:42.260> matched<00:03:42.820> your<00:03:43.820> speed

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
on the RPMs if you've matched your speed

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.670 
on the RPMs if you've matched your speed
with<00:03:45.290> your<00:03:45.590> gear<00:03:46.130> it<00:03:47.090> virtually<00:03:47.810> knowns<00:03:48.260> drone

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
with your gear it virtually knowns drone

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.420 
with your gear it virtually knowns drone
only<00:03:49.370> under<00:03:49.610> full<00:03:49.820> won't<00:03:51.070> second<00:03:52.070> gear<00:03:52.220> right

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
only under full won't second gear right

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.210 
only under full won't second gear right
now<00:03:52.610> accelerating<00:03:53.480> but<00:03:54.200> I'm<00:03:54.350> not<00:03:54.530> stomping<00:03:55.100> on

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
now accelerating but I'm not stomping on

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:03.460 
now accelerating but I'm not stomping on
the<00:03:55.370> gas<00:03:55.580> pedal<00:04:01.480> it's<00:04:02.480> actually<00:04:02.660> a<00:04:02.870> very<00:04:03.020> deep

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 
the gas pedal it's actually a very deep

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:07.660 
the gas pedal it's actually a very deep
throaty<00:04:04.040> exhaust<00:04:04.540> note<00:04:05.709> if<00:04:06.709> anybody<00:04:07.250> wants

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:07.670 
throaty exhaust note if anybody wants

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:09.970 
throaty exhaust note if anybody wants
that<00:04:07.820> there's<00:04:08.300> no<00:04:08.510> raspiness<00:04:09.050> to<00:04:09.440> it<00:04:09.590> you<00:04:09.830> can

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 
that there's no raspiness to it you can

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.680 
that there's no raspiness to it you can
still<00:04:10.190> hear<00:04:10.459> the<00:04:10.940> air<00:04:11.720> intake<00:04:12.260> sucking<00:04:13.070> in<00:04:13.220> air

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:13.690 
still hear the air intake sucking in air

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:16.720 
still hear the air intake sucking in air
but<00:04:14.690> you<00:04:14.840> do<00:04:14.989> hear<00:04:15.260> the<00:04:15.590> exhaust<00:04:16.160> it's<00:04:16.459> much

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:16.730 
but you do hear the exhaust it's much

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:48.570 
but you do hear the exhaust it's much
more<00:04:16.910> predominant<00:04:17.600> in<00:04:17.690> solving

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.659 

just<00:04:49.210> I'm<00:04:49.360> coasting<00:04:49.960> down<00:04:50.199> in<00:04:50.439> in<00:04:51.039> the<00:04:51.400> gear

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:51.669 
just I'm coasting down in in the gear

00:04:51.669 --> 00:05:27.710 
just I'm coasting down in in the gear
right<00:04:51.939> now

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:27.720 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.890 

the<00:05:28.290> exhaust<00:05:28.530> seem<00:05:28.800> to<00:05:28.980> make<00:05:29.130> the<00:05:29.190> most<00:05:29.400> noise

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:29.900 
the exhaust seem to make the most noise

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:35.150 
the exhaust seem to make the most noise
from<00:05:30.900> where<00:05:31.110> 24<00:05:32.070> XE<00:05:32.490> 2500<00:05:33.180> just<00:05:33.990> over<00:05:34.260> 3,000

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:35.160

from where 24 XE 2500 just over 3,000
rpm<00:05:35.610> so<00:05:36.600> if<00:05:36.720> your<00:05:36.870> full<00:05:37.140> wood<00:05:37.440> it'll<00:05:37.920> actually

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:38.160 
rpm so if your full wood it'll actually

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:41.270 
rpm so if your full wood it'll actually
make<00:05:38.340> quite<00:05:39.090> a<00:05:39.150> ruckus<00:05:39.650> but<00:05:40.650> depending<00:05:41.190> on

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:41.280 
make quite a ruckus but depending on

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:42.710 
make quite a ruckus but depending on
where<00:05:41.430> you<00:05:41.580> are<00:05:41.610> in<00:05:41.730> the<00:05:41.910> power<00:05:42.120> band<00:05:42.390> in<00:05:42.570> your

where you are in the power band in your
rpm<00:05:43.110> it<00:05:43.740> may<00:05:43.890> actually<00:05:44.040> be<00:05:44.340> quite<00:05:45.000> civilized

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:45.690 
rpm it may actually be quite civilized

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:49.310 
rpm it may actually be quite civilized
and<00:05:45.990> and<00:05:46.770> it<00:05:47.580> highly<00:05:47.880> tolerable<00:05:48.480> so<00:05:49.200> it

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:49.320 
and and it highly tolerable so it

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:50.390 
and and it highly tolerable so it
shouldn't<00:05:49.560> have<00:05:49.650> any<00:05:49.770> problem<00:05:50.070> if<00:05:50.160> you<00:05:50.280> are

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:50.400 
shouldn't have any problem if you are

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:53.120 
shouldn't have any problem if you are
looking<00:05:50.580> to<00:05:51.140> put<00:05:52.140> in<00:05:52.230> this<00:05:52.380> type<00:05:52.590> of<00:05:52.620> exhaust

looking to put in this type of exhaust

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:57.230 
looking to put in this type of exhaust
