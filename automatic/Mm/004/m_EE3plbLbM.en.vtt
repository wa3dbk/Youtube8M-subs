00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 hello and welcome we do not care 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.839
 how to fly right view the years 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.280
 It could also be that one still 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.670
 i can not fly i mean i would 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:14.820
 like to do more outdoors but easy 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:17.430
 one is just a little inhibited because 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.320
 you just do not feel so spontaneous to me 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:24.570
 anyway it is so I drink too 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:27.060
 hardly and that argument yes because of the 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.750
 content with the estimate then much too 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.070
 simply who where you have to look for them 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.110
 count for me not because the treasures 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.930
 bring on level on the way the bring 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.989
 if you are high level and most 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.420
 You just do not need treasures anymore 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.610
 with level 100 the garnison resources yes 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.820
 so my god that is not for me 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.190
 reason to ban the fly and the 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.960
 beautiful world yes I'm sorry it is 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.030
 been seen long enough now 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.969
 new players could be up to level 100 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:00.300
 but it has to fly high 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:02.910
 to be made slowly but there that 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.250
 unfortunately not the case because yes no 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.250
 Idea where too many for the no-fly 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.650
 the customers are in the comments 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:14.070
 Write what he think about it I think 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.200
 It takes just rubbish here 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.000
 spontaneity from the game and that's why 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.250
 I show you now was a few here 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.310
 alternative as you still peace 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.990
 Of course you could not do that 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.180
 Compare right flight mount 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.310
 First of all you need magic atom 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.060
 and here everyone could at least 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.740
 simulate 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:36.810
 So you can put two servants down 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.880
 ampere real construct that could too 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.159
 move or out at least 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.420
 and fly here and it looks pretty good 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.700
 out 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:50.350
 Of course that does not do the right thing 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:52.360
 replace fly but it is still wet 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.970
 feather and that he gets from the 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:58.960
 inn and there i can give you up 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:01.210
 Any case just to heart because these 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.909
 relatively nice you have to ten minutes 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.680
 cooldown but he really comes with it 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:09.030
 everywhere as you will only times high 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:12.100
 flung and then you fly fast 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:14.500
 back and forth and you can also control how 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:17.860
 So you really want to reach there 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.720
 almost every place as I said ten minutes 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.720
 time is a bit stupid should 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:25.330
 it gets right now you take in 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:29.620
 che flight ladder so you can also 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:33.160
 fly and although you can with the inci the 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:37.290
 make canvas where you probably everyone away 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:41.340
 Unfortunately, you can use it without her 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:43.450
 Look, I'm goffin kleiter 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.549
 completely dresses kit five 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.049
 Charges can be relatively cheap 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:49.480
 You can easily make in hama 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:50.709
 look there you can from the mountain down 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.840
 jump and then you have the 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:57.730
 parachute we can control so 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:03:02.019
 dress and then there are still the yes 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:04.540
 What's her name because she has to look short 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:06.850
 the funny workshop and there is 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.359
 always inventions and in the 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:13.239
 invention the income teschner pure 

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:15.010
 and in the invention there is today so 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:18.220
 There are always two inventions if you can 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:21.190
 At level 3 there is a room sweeper 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:23.769
 eyepiece does a lot of work with it 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:26.519
 500,000 damage and there are these 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:29.170
 rocket box for steering missiles 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:31.720
 full hit and you can almost 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:35.230
 set up everywhere and you can 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:40.000
 So I fly up for a minute 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:42.790
 on it 321 and off you go 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.320
 so and now you can have your own minute 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:47.260
 long here bio the flies she has her 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.860
 can theoretically hence every point 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.530
 to reach 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:54.010
 so I have to say sorry 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.760
 dear developer team of the blizzard 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:58.180
 developer team 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:03.670
 I think the flight ban just 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:05.620
 ridiculous and simply yes is what is called 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.440
 in the beginning now if you have the one 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:11.500
 all day makes ok I do not say no 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:13.570
 but it was tuesday 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.590
 fly once again comes everywhere 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:18.060
 where you want to go 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:23.350
 if you do it right and that's why 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:25.060
 I'm in favor of it at least 6.2 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:25.900
 that the fly is turned on again 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.030
 becomes 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.980
 But I would like your opinion 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:33.120
 know what do you think of the flight ban 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:37.090
 would also like to fly in bio de 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:40.030
 and fall down but I have one more 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:43.810
 charging at the rocket d3 charging 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:44.979
 there's even and yes maybe you could 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:50.350
 her with tips a little something 

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:53.560
 employed that you also so romberg 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:56.590
 Jackpot or something else yes I say 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:58.510
 Bye and bye and I hope soon 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:02.860
 then we can fly so easily 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:06.310
 For example, if a gang is going by 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:07.300
 the horde one of the guild and facts 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:09.700
 Can someone help me 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:13.120
 who comes over today who if 

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:16.210
 you're close or something else then 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:18.240
 you fly fast and that's what I do 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:21.370
 my playful interaction 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:26.200
 is not promoted by it is that 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:28.090
 so and i do not see any more players because 

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:29.770
 I do not fly but on the ground 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:32.400
 I am sorry that is not a row 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:34.560
 argument for me 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.449
 if you 're on the ground right here 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:39.090
 I can not see that either 

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:42.570
 as we will not fly over so yes 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:45.240
 I'm sorry of flying the no-fly 

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:47.630
 just bugs me right it belongs 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:51.830
 there is a player and a flight controller 

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:51.830
 Laughter makes you happy and in the process
