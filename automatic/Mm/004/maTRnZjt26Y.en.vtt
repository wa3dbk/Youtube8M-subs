00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.110
 hello good evening it's kenshin of no 7 7 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.490
 in our videos on the bedroom I had 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.920
 soon enough to bring up the subject of 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.480
 custom maps in black ops I said that 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.130
 I had seen a video of the right thing 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.230
 end where he used the stick in front 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.960
 original this on a little bit all the maps 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.789
 of black ops especially invites you to see 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.380
 the video he did on call of the 

00:00:32.789 --> 00:00:36.450
 dead that I had found quite funny 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.370
 if you also want to do that it refers 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.050
 in the description of his video to a 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.790
 tutorial in English quite simple to follow 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.840
 even if you do not speak English and who 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.489
 is regularly updated 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.690
 I could always do a tutorial 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.340
 if you ever think it's helpful 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.379
 but after that a lot of 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.090
 people mistakenly thought that maps 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.440
 custom on black ops low wages for 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.760
 soon 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.690
 nothing is more wrong at the moment all 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.980
 what is feasible is to modify 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.660
 the weapons that are present on the 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.160
 tablecloths in the videos of the relaxine 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.510
 guen we could also see a striker at 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.430
 the place of the Olympiad taking over 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.140
 alone of kilos of autumn grass where the 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.859
 start weapons that change and where even the 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.499
 weapons in the box 

00:01:04.859 --> 00:01:10.079
 it's only possible on pc not on 

00:01:07.499 --> 00:01:11.939
 console only on pc but that's it 

00:01:10.079 --> 00:01:13.920
 between replacing the weapons of a map and 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.869
 and creates his own map is a ditch 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.950
 monster in terms of difficulty remains that 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.270
 you may have heard of a 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.619
 small group of people trying 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.240
 to adapt on the coop only tool of 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.759
 map development in front of the web 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.259
 the fact is that there is still a lot of 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.420
 things to do before it's at 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.830
 point 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.720
 basically that means you can 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.310
 still wait for at least several 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.759
 years before it starts to take 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.259
 form 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:34.580
 here I wanted to do this all 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:35.750
 little video because I did not want to 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.399
 to participate in any of 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.750
 information hoping do not you 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:39.799
 having trouble with a video that 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.360
 does not really bring great 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:43.360
 new me i tell you next 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.670
 after saying
