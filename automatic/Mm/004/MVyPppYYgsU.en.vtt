00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:08.670
 Hello here is the hertha with one 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:10.969
 new sign video and although I have in 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:17.310
 Lately, more often taken out 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:21.359
 when men have such important lives 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:26.250
 and when not there are people so 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:28.560
 drawn the people who act real and 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.050
 as if they had their own character 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.020
 And then there are people who like the effect 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:37.320
 drawn drawings 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:38.930
 that sounds more valid now but it is 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.600
 already so common here for example 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:45.149
 looks like a drawn sometimes the 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:50.760
 is very nice but he has none 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:55.129
 correct personality of the other hand 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:58.859
 i also flex here as on the 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:01:06.420
 postcards and posters have page that 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:09.260
 had own character also the has 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.260
 a character of its own 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:18.060
 what is different with this sometimes 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:21.450
 In this man can as a matter the 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.700
 is essential I've noticed how 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.939
 you place the face so if I am 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:30.170
 do something like an example now 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.710
 then I can do such good 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:35.579
 make facial expression 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.470
 it does not look right because they are so 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:41.299
 you do not look like you have me at the end 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:44.009
 the hair accuses this one 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:46.590
 facial form that is definitely 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.960
 sometimes something where I have noticed the 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:53.549
 monks look more natural when on 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:55.790
 any point which is free of hair 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:59.430
 So if you take it again 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:02.969
 then you can see it here, too 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.440
 down and already looks different if 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:07.250
 I would have connected here 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:11.160
 So like this, you're wrong 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:14.160
 with that it is also so there the hair hangs 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.530
 right and left something out how stop that 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.100
 anyway, the sony top has 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.740
 hairstyle 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:23.820
 but that does no harm 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:26.370
 no it is more natural if the 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:28.500
 hair in any form survive the 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.290
 press full on the face have it there 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.970
 yes, people the thinner narrower 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.560
 have face and which the fuller 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:38.250
 face have that for legal 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:40.890
 The second thing is the face 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:44.400
 which is always nice, of course 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:47.330
 you have the big eyes 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:50.190
 we are in shape as the video already 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:52.320
 that one then has the possibility the 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.320
 eyeballs to place different 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:57.180
 So sometimes in the other direction 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:03.270
 let's look at the side 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:05.610
 or look up and then come 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:08.180
 always on it like the rice of 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:16.580
 So look at the face 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:19.470
 first you have seen little drawn 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:21.450
 is with the eyes looks wrong so 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.400
 you can see that is drawn correctly and 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:26.910
 the eyes because I can so funny 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:29.220
 Now this one we made this one here 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:31.800
 it does not have that nice but if you do 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:35.610
 the a bit clearer it works 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:38.820
 in any case, the real nose 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:44.269
 some things look pretty without a nose 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:44.269
 but a real one so his mannen 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.280
 without a nose these are not the hair now 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.880
 so great 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:57.540
 He looks funny and courage 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:04:03.060
 So often just eyes and mouth 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:04.600
 but as a real human, so to speak 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.940
 one of course one 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:09.940
 and that also makes something like 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:12.030
 alive that sometimes work as he still does 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:17.220
 once the video is the difference 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:20.650
 sometimes drawn in proportion to 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:22.030
 Livelier was not so I hope so 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:26.290
 have made reasonably understandable 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:29.400
 what I tried to say because its 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:33.010
 style is a bit more childlike and 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:35.530
 Cardboard is her moderate show is 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:40.060
 maybe more serious or elegant and 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:43.030
 was so realistic maybe 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:46.210
 look their male right out too 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:48.160
 in the face as I the people with that 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:49.990
 But the difference is true 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.940
 for every style 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:54.670
 that means you will make drawings 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:56.380
 who live more from their own point of view 

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:58.330
 where more skips the certain 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:00.330
 have something and others will 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:04.150
 drawings are where they say 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:06.130
 somehow it is plumper otherwise or 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:10.930
 somehow they wrong that 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:12.940
 Munich does not live right then it is 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:15.870
 these differences are clearly important 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:19.240
 do as in all other things too 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:22.690
 happened to write or because she was not 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:24.070
 in art making it is important if 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:26.080
 one wants to get ahead also so one 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:29.530
 little to analyze what's up 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:30.790
 well, what is not so good because so can 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:34.000
 They target the strengths they already have 

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:35.470
 have expand and the things still 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.030
 do not work so well that no need 

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:39.190
 to be weak but sometimes comes 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:41.550
 you simply not know exactly what it 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:45.180
 It is that they can then targeted 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:45.180
 improves a lot of fun while practicing
