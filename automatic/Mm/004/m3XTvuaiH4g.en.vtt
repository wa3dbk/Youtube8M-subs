00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:29.000
 so the chamois have taken over 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:31.130
 training a few days ago the 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.770
 really on the ground and the heat 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:36.649
 happened big heat how does it get 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.750
 passed something specific to 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:39.649
 web we will say that the conditions 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.970
 climatic conditions are part of 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:42.940
 training now it's true that 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:45.260
 as soon as it becomes a bit extreme 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:48.399
 we must take into consideration the 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.780
 this heat and then have an attitude 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:52.940
 adequate especially on training 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.550
 here we pay attention on the times of 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.660
 recovery hydration times 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:57.920
 there is during training and then he 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.359
 is especially after a workout it's up to 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:05.089
 to say also redo the water needs 

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:06.650
 to be able to also in the afternoon 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:10.100
 on the nap to stay in a 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:11.990
 cool and dark room here I go 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.330
 just pay attention to the 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.410
 high temperature 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:17.120
 there is still the cost of instructions 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:18.770
 specific as compared to read a time 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.610
 classic things that you ask for 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:24.470
 more or less to the players to drink more 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:27.080
 obligatorily so it's true that the 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:29.480
 accelerates heat accelerates the 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.970
 dehydration and fatigue is done 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.620
 feel the temperature faster 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.150
 body temperature also increases 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:37.730
 quickly so you have to predict when 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.800
 even its beaches its beaches where we try 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:41.000
 to hydrate and we also try to 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.380
 bring down the temperature in 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.830
 the poses at the training here and 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.830
 after training 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.130
 there have been training sessions with 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.450
 offbeat schedules if I believe this well 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.280
 week it was essential 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:13.040
 we are trying to adapt precisely by 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.170
 compared to what was what was said will 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.300
 just be earlier we train 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.040
 also cooler temperatures and 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.300
 in the evening we tried to rest we 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.490
 pushed back also to try to 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.470
 benefit from waste temperatures 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.630
 which was a little bit that they were a little 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.590
 shy anyway but good after after 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.080
 we have to train anyway 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.310
 here after we adapt and for you in 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.030
 as a fitness trainer is what 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.380
 it's penalizing 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:38.090
 it's a heat wave especially on 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:39.920
 the first week no no if we are so 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.020
 we are measured in the demand we have 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.330
 vis-Ã -vis the players it's not 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:46.520
 penalizing us for being so attentive 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:50.150
 with the staff for precisely calibrated our 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:51.680
 training in a suitable way and between 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.000
 quotation marks as soon as the temperatures are 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.250
 more lenient perhaps to the second 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.050
 week or even the third we will arrive at 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.160
 the iss and we will manage to smooth a little 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.600
 all this training load so 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.180
 we will accentuate a little more as soon as 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:06.080
 it will be cooler that's not late 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:08.360
 not a handicap not just precisely you 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:12.580
 be vigilant when you want 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.580
 on this first week of closely by
