00:00:01.259 --> 00:00:03.380
 as scanners face it 

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:07.320
 a topic that I see and if first because I always see that people who 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:07.999
 is it so 

00:00:07.999 --> 00:00:10.999
 they will interpret super job interview 

00:00:10.999 --> 00:00:13.429
 i am negotiating ahead of time 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:15.299
 what is your character 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:21.009
 they believe that the beginning and are negotiating salary conditions and they become 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:22.220
 distant 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.270
 I have on the stick and accessible 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.480
 because they feel that if they show a lot of interest or show a lot of enthusiasm for 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.339
 certain position 

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:33.330
 amsafe be the same that is a blunder 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:37.090
 It is imperative that the pil until the offer is not put on the table a 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:38.660
 note has nothing in hand 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.090
 churches the difficult 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.840
 oo 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.460
 with a 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.140
 ccoo in distant 1 when referring to the interviewer that is based on 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:49.550
 information 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.730
 in this eagerness to climb the perceived value of the photo efe seem more expensive 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:56.140
 it is a total error 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.290
 what gets most people who opt for balloting is whistled 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:01.990
 they weave some animal even so interview 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:06.330
 another important mistake is also a character start talking about silver 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.340
 very soon in interview they basically sit down and they already start to 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.420
 ask for good and when they know what the conditions are like and for 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.290
 parking and have health insurance etc 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:20.300
 comeaÃ±a to demonstrate an interest we demand in the part the compensation and 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:25.130
 I say decisive in another of November 1 out of it came the time but that if 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.320
 you put in advance one can negotiate neither talk about money nor about him nor 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.320
 conditions does not make you the other 15 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.510
 you can ask eventually come the time when I had to have gone 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:41.509
 buying your profile never never quote 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.610
 what and of course when you do not start with money it is always important to expect 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.820
 be the other and take the initiative 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.170
 And yes yes 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.360
 you have to talk about amounts is always to improve a great goal 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:58.050
 Beware of getting very emphatic the silver issue in general not very bad 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.860
 Print 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.400
 eye I know that you will not have good money and a lot of that think loads of 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.410
 work 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:06.970
 wolford for improvement but p how I repeat 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.289
 to show 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.939
 are afraid is the main reason why one is working is is 

00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:16.440
 interviewing sixth 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.709
 according to the job you are looking for work 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:22.430
 figueroa with confidence attitudes because almost one can have a 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:23.469
 arsenal 

00:02:23.469 --> 00:02:27.229
 in the image some details in gold in the posts of the list because 

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:29.669
 finally people are tired of that for money 

00:02:29.669 --> 00:02:33.979
 many others pillar yes but statistically most of 

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:35.249
 people work 

00:02:35.249 --> 00:02:36.360
 a tournament like that 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.600
 but also to develop to grow to learn 

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:44.419
 and I start are the things that one has to first demonstrate an interview 

00:02:44.419 --> 00:02:46.729
 before the monic desire 

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:49.739
 percent good not at all that idea percent 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:52.730
 I commented half and five rear seats chao
