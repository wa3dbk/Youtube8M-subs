everything<00:04:59.570> that<00:04:59.600> is<00:04:59.870> going<00:05:00.020> on<00:05:00.260> in<00:05:00.320> my<00:05:00.470> life

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:00.560 
everything that is going on in my life

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.860 
everything that is going on in my life
right<00:05:01.010> now<00:05:01.310> to<00:05:02.150> a<00:05:02.180> decision<00:05:02.479> that<00:05:02.660> I've<00:05:02.840> made

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:02.870 
right now to a decision that I've made

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:05.590 
right now to a decision that I've made
in<00:05:03.320> the<00:05:03.380> past<00:05:03.560> now<00:05:04.130> that<00:05:04.460> is<00:05:04.669> why<00:05:04.850> I<00:05:04.880> have<00:05:05.090> to

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:05.600 
in the past now that is why I have to

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.330 
in the past now that is why I have to
believe<00:05:05.750> that<00:05:05.990> everything<00:05:06.560> happens<00:05:06.740> for<00:05:07.310> a

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:07.340 
believe that everything happens for a

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:09.760 
believe that everything happens for a
reason<00:05:07.430> I<00:05:07.880> have<00:05:08.150> to<00:05:08.419> because<00:05:09.110> I<00:05:09.139> can<00:05:09.440> trace

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:09.770 
reason I have to because I can trace

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:12.460 
reason I have to because I can trace
back<00:05:09.800> everything<00:05:10.669> that<00:05:10.850> has<00:05:11.030> happened<00:05:11.600> to<00:05:12.260> be
