00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 Hello friends YouTube 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.330
 welcome to a broadcast more than 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:09.090
 fanatics server background on this occasion 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.639
 we will use as our jenson 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.099
 Android device for devra yernos 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.170
 draw or in case you have a 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:19.260
 rain of life and want to capture and not 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:22.289
 we have a pencil and notebook nearby 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:25.170
 We can use this technology to 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:28.800
 to be able to do it the application as always 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:33.030
 I leave it in the link of this video and the 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:35.540
 application is called sketch book here 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.540
 is the name 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.940
 and know in red and I have it different 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:43.790
 for an icon pack but in short 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.590
 this is the application and this would be your 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.930
 environment 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.400
 here you will appear you give the little circulito and 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:53.120
 you see all the things that 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:56.930
 you can use airbrush nibs one 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:01:00.680
 rubber and then you can put yourself 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:02.590
 trace anything in a very 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.930
 simple 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:09.300
 let's do an ulna here 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:13.920
 easy and simple 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:17.670
 anyway we take the rubber we do not erase for 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:20.480
 leave it a little more finite let's 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:25.740
 take what is the airbrush 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:29.150
 and let's give a little light a nuance 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.150
 and let's do it Mason 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.860
 so that it looks like our ulna 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:43.330
 and ready and what else can we do? 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:46.270
 changing color can blur everything 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:51.060
 what are the different shadows can you 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.060
 load predetermined figures 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:58.890
 a message the application is great and 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:01.020
 it would only be missing that he had eches a 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.370
 walk your creativity 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:09.140
 that you try everything that is 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:12.440
 and it's a very good photoshop touch something 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.690
 well and the application is very good can 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.510
 back I hope you liked it 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:20.060
 you can save the projects you put 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:23.900
 save and exit although in this case it was 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:27.260
 save let's go back to put 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:29.620
 the plan to see I still do not get used to 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.620
 my icons 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.879
 I thought that the idea was not very good 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:38.720
 to change them well we proceed to save 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:41.680
 to follow here we will give in little circles 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:44.740
 the windows come out 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:47.300
 and let's give it 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:48.110
 and here guys our projects that for 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.650
 example if I had already done it 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:54.200
 previously very easy is an eye was 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.390
 done here and then it's very easy to 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.210
 to do it just need that I wanted to talk about 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:02.330
 imagination that gauge wind windpipe and 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:05.540
 this is all I hope you recorded
