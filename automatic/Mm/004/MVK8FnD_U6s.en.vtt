to kind of maneuver move around I think

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.020 
to kind of maneuver move around I think
it'll<00:01:10.680> be<00:01:10.770> kind<00:01:10.950> of<00:01:11.010> a<00:01:11.100> little<00:01:11.250> bit<00:01:11.369> cumbersome

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
it'll be kind of a little bit cumbersome

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.280 
it'll be kind of a little bit cumbersome
just<00:01:12.270> because<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.630> buns<00:01:12.840> are<00:01:12.990> gonna<00:01:13.140> be<00:01:13.229> in

the way net person like buttons and
analog<00:01:15.299> sticks<00:01:15.540> rather<00:01:15.750> than<00:01:15.869> actually<00:01:16.170> using

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
analog sticks rather than actually using

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.380 
analog sticks rather than actually using
the<00:01:16.470> touchpad<00:01:16.680> just<00:01:17.520> because<00:01:17.759> my<00:01:17.880> damn<00:01:18.030> finger

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
the touchpad just because my damn finger

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.789 
the touchpad just because my damn finger

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
stick to move around is crucial it's

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.640

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
be a little bit more difficult but this

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:37.999 
be a little bit more difficult but this
is<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:36.840> PlayStation<00:01:37.350> Vita<00:01:37.439> and<00:01:37.740> it's<00:01:37.860> gonna

be<00:01:38.130> able<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:38.430> do<00:01:38.610> that<00:01:38.759> and<00:01:39.119> I<00:01:39.960> should<00:01:40.140> be

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
be able to do that and I should be

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.960 
be able to do that and I should be
awesome<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.710> rear<00:01:40.920> touchpad<00:01:41.220> what<00:01:41.700> it<00:01:41.820> could

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
awesome the rear touchpad what it could

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.060 
awesome the rear touchpad what it could
do<00:01:42.119> also<00:01:42.479> you'd<00:01:42.780> be<00:01:43.110> almost<00:01:43.470> as<00:01:43.680> similar<00:01:44.040> to

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
do also you'd be almost as similar to

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.560 
do also you'd be almost as similar to
the<00:01:44.189> touchscreen<00:01:44.640> maybe<00:01:45.060> you're<00:01:45.240> using<00:01:45.390> your

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
the touchscreen maybe you're using your

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:46.969 
the touchscreen maybe you're using your
buttons<00:01:45.869> and<00:01:46.020> you<00:01:46.079> want<00:01:46.229> to<00:01:46.320> swipe<00:01:46.500> something

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
buttons and you want to swipe something

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.530 
buttons and you want to swipe something
or<00:01:47.130> you<00:01:47.250> know<00:01:47.399> move<00:01:47.909> around<00:01:48.149> with<00:01:48.450> the

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
or you know move around with the

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.020 
or you know move around with the
category<00:01:49.049> or<00:01:49.350> scrolling<00:01:50.250> through<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.700> menus

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
category or scrolling through the menus

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.819 
category or scrolling through the menus
or<00:01:51.240> something<00:01:51.570> like<00:01:51.659> that<00:01:51.720> you<00:01:52.380> can<00:01:52.560> use<00:01:52.680> that

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
or something like that you can use that

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.050 
or something like that you can use that
though<00:01:52.979> but<00:01:53.159> I<00:01:53.189> personally<00:01:53.700> don't<00:01:53.880> like<00:01:53.939> the

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
though but I personally don't like the

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.240 
though but I personally don't like the
rear<00:01:54.299> touchpad<00:01:54.540> all<00:01:54.810> that<00:01:54.930> much<00:01:55.110> so<00:01:55.320> pipe<00:01:55.530> it

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
rear touchpad all that much so pipe it

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.560 
rear touchpad all that much so pipe it
obviously<00:01:56.700> would<00:01:56.790> be<00:01:56.880> an<00:01:57.030> option<00:01:57.210> you<00:01:57.450> can

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
obviously would be an option you can

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.539 
obviously would be an option you can
always<00:01:57.689> kind<00:01:58.380> of<00:01:58.500> configure<00:01:58.950> it<00:01:59.070> maybe<00:01:59.340> you

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
always kind of configure it maybe you

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:00.889 
always kind of configure it maybe you
can<00:01:59.670> use<00:01:59.790> a<00:01:59.820> touchpad<00:02:00.119> for<00:02:00.630> I<00:02:00.659> don't<00:02:00.780> know

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
can use a touchpad for I don't know

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.620 
can use a touchpad for I don't know
maybe<00:02:00.960> digging<00:02:01.500> a<00:02:01.590> hole<00:02:01.799> or<00:02:02.189> for<00:02:02.969> switching

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
maybe digging a hole or for switching

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:04.940 
maybe digging a hole or for switching
you<00:02:03.750> know<00:02:03.899> weapons<00:02:04.350> or<00:02:04.500> that<00:02:04.619> sort<00:02:04.799> of<00:02:04.860> thing

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
you know weapons or that sort of thing

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.789 
you know weapons or that sort of thing
or<00:02:05.310> you<00:02:05.520> know<00:02:05.610> attacking<00:02:06.149> or<00:02:06.530> running<00:02:07.530> I<00:02:07.649> don't

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
or you know attacking or running I don't

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.469 
or you know attacking or running I don't
know<00:02:07.890> it<00:02:08.069> could<00:02:08.190> be<00:02:08.220> that<00:02:08.459> right<00:02:08.910> because<00:02:09.119> some

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
know it could be that right because some

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.600 
know it could be that right because some
of<00:02:09.569> the<00:02:09.629> first-person<00:02:10.530> shooter<00:02:10.979> games<00:02:11.190> maybe

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
of the first-person shooter games maybe

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.330 
of the first-person shooter games maybe
hold<00:02:12.030> on<00:02:12.120> the<00:02:12.209> touchpad<00:02:12.450> to<00:02:12.660> the<00:02:12.870> direction

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
hold on the touchpad to the direction

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.699 
hold on the touchpad to the direction
want<00:02:13.430> to<00:02:13.489> run<00:02:13.640> it<00:02:13.819> actually<00:02:13.940> runs<00:02:14.870> but<00:02:15.470> I'm<00:02:15.560> not

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
want to run it actually runs but I'm not

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:17.350 
want to run it actually runs but I'm not
a<00:02:15.769> big<00:02:15.890> fan<00:02:16.069> I<00:02:16.129> like<00:02:16.489> using<00:02:16.670> the<00:02:16.849> button<00:02:17.150> and

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
a big fan I like using the button and

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.030 
a big fan I like using the button and
then<00:02:17.569> you<00:02:17.810> know<00:02:17.989> choosing<00:02:18.500> the<00:02:18.680> direction

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
then you know choosing the direction

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.650 
then you know choosing the direction
that<00:02:19.129> I<00:02:19.190> want<00:02:19.400> to<00:02:19.459> run<00:02:19.580> but<00:02:19.790> that'd<00:02:20.239> be<00:02:20.269> cool<00:02:20.510> if

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
that I want to run but that'd be cool if

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.570 
that I want to run but that'd be cool if
they<00:02:20.750> have<00:02:20.900> that<00:02:21.019> implementation<00:02:21.580> motion

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
they have that implementation motion

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.190 
they have that implementation motion
sensing<00:02:23.060> I<00:02:23.180> mean<00:02:23.390> it<00:02:23.510> could<00:02:23.660> have<00:02:23.690> it<00:02:24.050> though

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
sensing I mean it could have it though

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.320 
sensing I mean it could have it though
but<00:02:24.500> I<00:02:24.709> don't<00:02:24.890> really<00:02:25.129> see<00:02:25.340> a<00:02:25.370> huge<00:02:25.819> use<00:02:26.030> for<00:02:26.239> it

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
but I don't really see a huge use for it

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.830 
but I don't really see a huge use for it
you<00:02:26.480> know

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
you know

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.900 
you know
I<00:02:26.870> think<00:02:27.349> it<00:02:27.440> might<00:02:27.769> make<00:02:27.800> more<00:02:28.280> sense<00:02:28.640> if

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
I think it might make more sense if

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.910 
I think it might make more sense if
maybe<00:02:29.510> in<00:02:29.629> a<00:02:29.690> future<00:02:29.959> update<00:02:30.110> the<00:02:30.470> PlayStation

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
maybe in a future update the PlayStation

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.830 
maybe in a future update the PlayStation
4<00:02:30.950> or<00:02:31.430> the<00:02:31.790> PlayStation<00:02:32.209> 3<00:02:32.360> end<00:02:32.480> up<00:02:32.569> having

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
4 or the PlayStation 3 end up having

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.479 
4 or the PlayStation 3 end up having
like<00:02:32.930> move<00:02:33.140> support<00:02:33.530> so<00:02:33.980> if<00:02:34.040> you<00:02:34.129> want<00:02:34.310> to<00:02:34.370> use

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:34.489 
like move support so if you want to use

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:36.130 
like move support so if you want to use
almost<00:02:34.790> like<00:02:34.910> you<00:02:35.269> know<00:02:35.390> like<00:02:35.540> a<00:02:35.569> mouse<00:02:35.840> pad

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
almost like you know like a mouse pad

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:37.479 
almost like you know like a mouse pad
and<00:02:36.170> that<00:02:36.349> sort<00:02:36.620> of<00:02:36.650> thing<00:02:36.799> you<00:02:37.190> can<00:02:37.310> move

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489 
and that sort of thing you can move

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:39.520 
and that sort of thing you can move
around<00:02:37.610> and<00:02:38.150> I<00:02:38.390> think<00:02:38.750> I'd<00:02:38.989> be<00:02:39.080> kind<00:02:39.260> of<00:02:39.319> cool

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
around and I think I'd be kind of cool

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:40.960 
around and I think I'd be kind of cool
but<00:02:40.099> on<00:02:40.220> the<00:02:40.280> Vita<00:02:40.489> I<00:02:40.549> don't<00:02:40.760> think<00:02:40.879> it

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
but on the Vita I don't think it

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.190 
but on the Vita I don't think it
actually<00:02:41.000> makes<00:02:41.330> that<00:02:41.540> much<00:02:41.720> sense<00:02:41.959> you<00:02:42.110> know

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
actually makes that much sense you know

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.170 
actually makes that much sense you know
what<00:02:42.290> I<00:02:42.349> mean<00:02:42.470> so<00:02:42.709> motion<00:02:43.700> sensing<00:02:44.030> on<00:02:44.120> the

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
what I mean so motion sensing on the

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:45.910 
what I mean so motion sensing on the
PlayStation<00:02:44.599> 4<00:02:44.750> minecraft<00:02:45.260> probably<00:02:45.799> not<00:02:45.890> a

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
PlayStation 4 minecraft probably not a

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.740 
PlayStation 4 minecraft probably not a
good<00:02:46.069> idea<00:02:46.160> I<00:02:46.459> can't<00:02:46.970> wait<00:02:47.150> to<00:02:47.239> finally<00:02:47.540> be

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
good idea I can't wait to finally be

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:48.729 
good idea I can't wait to finally be
able<00:02:47.840> to<00:02:47.959> play<00:02:48.110> Minecraft<00:02:48.560> on<00:02:48.650> the
