00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.380
 ladsous and compass and welcome to another 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:08.730
 new video of how they saw it in the 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:11.820
 big title fauto 5 online 1.25 1.27 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.370
 is already here in the update on 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.440
 ghost in game ok or dirty money like 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.529
 what you want to call it is already in 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.300
 big missed 5 but that right now until the 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.449
 moment I have verified that only 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.849
 found in xbox juan and in play station 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.010
 4 ok on the old platform consoles 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.929
 still not found although I think that 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.210
 in a few hours they will include it not 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.250
 because they give you some small 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.190
 preference to what will be the 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.629
 new generation consoles or little thing 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.520
 more, if I'm not mistaken, it's already 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.500
 find to download in the 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.760
 computer but the most important thing is 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.710
 that are already the consoles of 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.230
 new generation so how do they see it 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.480
 here they may be watching what is going 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.340
 doing me downloading the update 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.469
 and how they can see it is 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.780
 practically the play station tab 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.090
 4 not as you see it is an update 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.559
 extremely heavy so if you guys 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.539
 they want to download they must have it 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.309
 some space on the hard drive though 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.510
 it is obvious that most people 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.700
 is going to have to why 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.680
 it's a console so practically new 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.860
 no I do not think nobody is running out 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.540
 hard drive of play station 4 and here 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.550
 As you may be observing they are 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.830
 seeing my xbox one tab in fact 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:22.020
 they will be able to account for the part of 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.180
 up what is my xbox and how do they see it? 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.210
 try to access what is doing the 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.230
 grand theft auto 5 jumps me the 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:31.140
 update in fact right now it's 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:32.850
 downloading and already includes the vehicles and 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.920
 all these new things I have seen by 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.470
 internet some things that of people who 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.050
 they already have it and I have to tell you that this is 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.190
 the most expensive update of all the 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.870
 history since there is an airplane 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.790
 but that you will see a little 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:46.290
 more later in the channel so kids 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.910
 As you can see, the 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.100
 update your opinion in the 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:51.570
 comments and I advise you to 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.790
 put down the posts that are 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.620
 it's going to take a little bit because it's 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.020
 something ship of the system because suddenly 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:00.810
 you are downloaded 4 gigas and a half and 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.570
 Suddenly it takes you a lot is not something 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.490
 extremely strange if they are from play 4 and they 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.220
 brand that is not yet being downloaded 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:11.340
 do not worry go to the tab 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.780
 gt5 give options and go to the panel 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.790
 downloads and there you will see how 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.440
 the update in real time so 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.390
 I hope you like this video if 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.950
 someone had a doubt I think that they 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.540
 I could have answered in this video to 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.890
 the people more than anything that has some 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.990
 Problems in play 4 with the 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.400
 update so I hope there will be 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.110
 informed so do not forget to leave your 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.580
