00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
because obviously that's where you get

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.810 
because obviously that's where you get
the<00:01:29.549> points<00:01:30.000> that's<00:01:30.390> how<00:01:30.600> you<00:01:30.659> level<00:01:30.990> up<00:01:31.110> and

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
the points that's how you level up and

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.940 
the points that's how you level up and
that's<00:01:32.820> what<00:01:33.030> call<00:01:33.479> of<00:01:33.630> duty<00:01:33.659> is<00:01:34.049> really<00:01:34.740> about

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
that's what call of duty is really about

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.640 
that's what call of duty is really about

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
isn't it can we all agree on that I

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.090 
isn't it can we all agree on that I
think<00:01:37.979> so<00:01:38.990> for<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.079> most<00:01:40.200> part<00:01:40.350> I<00:01:40.680> mean<00:01:40.860> you

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
yeah Search and Destroy is probably my

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.780 
yeah Search and Destroy is probably my

some reason I don't know why but I don't
even<00:03:05.859> know<00:03:06.100> why<00:03:07.060> anyone<00:03:07.299> would<00:03:07.510> go<00:03:07.630> to<00:03:07.690> that

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
even know why anyone would go to that

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.900 
even know why anyone would go to that
house<00:03:08.079> in<00:03:08.350> Search<00:03:08.590> and<00:03:08.709> Destroy<00:03:08.760> besides<00:03:09.760> the

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
house in Search and Destroy besides the

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.990 
house in Search and Destroy besides the
fact<00:03:10.060> that<00:03:10.180> you<00:03:10.329> spawn<00:03:10.870> right<00:03:11.200> by<00:03:11.380> it<00:03:11.410> but<00:03:12.000> it's

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
fact that you spawn right by it but it's

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.259 
fact that you spawn right by it but it's
not<00:03:13.180> a<00:03:13.209> very<00:03:13.389> good<00:03:14.160> tactical<00:03:15.160> approach<00:03:15.519> which

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269 
not a very good tactical approach which

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:19.319 
not a very good tactical approach which
leads<00:03:16.480> me<00:03:16.540> to<00:03:16.630> my<00:03:16.780> next<00:03:16.870> point<00:03:17.139> um<00:03:17.590> I<00:03:18.329> was

smart ways to approach certain
situations<00:03:49.530> whether<00:03:50.490> that<00:03:50.730> be<00:03:50.880> like<00:03:51.090> you<00:03:51.360> know

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
situations whether that be like you know

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.950 
situations whether that be like you know
search<00:03:53.040> and<00:03:53.220> destroy<00:03:53.340> or<00:03:53.910> even<00:03:54.450> free-for-all

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:54.960 
search and destroy or even free-for-all

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:56.690 
search and destroy or even free-for-all
because<00:03:55.620> they're<00:03:55.770> there<00:03:56.070> is<00:03:56.220> strategy

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
because they're there is strategy

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.700 
because they're there is strategy
involved<00:03:57.060> in<00:03:57.150> free<00:03:57.330> fall<00:03:57.540> and<00:03:57.600> I<00:03:58.050> think<00:03:58.560> that's

00:03:58.700 --> 00:03:58.710 
involved in free fall and I think that's

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:00.590 
involved in free fall and I think that's
the<00:03:59.010> main<00:03:59.370> reason<00:03:59.430> why<00:03:59.790> I<00:03:59.910> can<00:04:00.150> get<00:04:00.300> so<00:04:00.450> many

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
the main reason why I can get so many

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.690 
the main reason why I can get so many
kills<00:04:00.900> is<00:04:01.080> because<00:04:01.410> a<00:04:01.680> lot<00:04:02.160> of<00:04:02.190> people<00:04:02.280> don't

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
kills is because a lot of people don't

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.070 
kills is because a lot of people don't
think<00:04:02.940> there's<00:04:03.120> strategy<00:04:03.330> and<00:04:03.660> fruit<00:04:03.840> for<00:04:04.020> all

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 
think there's strategy and fruit for all

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.740 
think there's strategy and fruit for all
and<00:04:04.200> then<00:04:04.290> you<00:04:04.350> just<00:04:04.500> run<00:04:04.740> around<00:04:05.570> like<00:04:06.570> an

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
and then you just run around like an

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.070 
and then you just run around like an
idiot<00:04:06.840> and<00:04:08.150> those<00:04:09.150> idiots<00:04:09.540> are<00:04:09.720> the<00:04:09.870> ones<00:04:10.020> that

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:10.080 
idiot and those idiots are the ones that

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.410 
idiot and those idiots are the ones that
on<00:04:10.290> killing<00:04:10.740> so<00:04:11.070> that's<00:04:11.640> why<00:04:11.820> I'm<00:04:11.940> able<00:04:12.150> to<00:04:12.210> put

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
on killing so that's why I'm able to put

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.290 
on killing so that's why I'm able to put
up<00:04:12.540> some<00:04:12.720> pretty<00:04:12.930> pretty<00:04:13.770> good<00:04:13.980> scores<00:04:14.310> so

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:15.300 
up some pretty pretty good scores so

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:16.789 
up some pretty pretty good scores so
maybe<00:04:15.540> you<00:04:15.660> guys<00:04:15.780> want<00:04:16.080> some<00:04:16.290> tactical

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
maybe you guys want some tactical

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:19.520 
maybe you guys want some tactical
approaches<00:04:17.930> so<00:04:18.930> I'm<00:04:19.020> you<00:04:19.110> know<00:04:19.230> walkthrough

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
approaches so I'm you know walkthrough

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.199 
approaches so I'm you know walkthrough
videos<00:04:20.040> I<00:04:20.280> guess<00:04:20.489> I<00:04:20.730> don't<00:04:20.880> know<00:04:21.000> what<00:04:21.090> to<00:04:21.120> call

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
videos I guess I don't know what to call

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.450 
videos I guess I don't know what to call
but<00:04:21.690> hopefully<00:04:22.470> you<00:04:22.650> understand<00:04:23.130> what<00:04:23.280> i<00:04:23.310> mean

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:00.420 
something I don't know but yeah just let

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:01.430 
something I don't know but yeah just let
me<00:05:00.480> know<00:05:00.600> what<00:05:00.720> you<00:05:00.780> want<00:05:00.990> and<00:05:01.080> right<00:05:01.230> here<00:05:01.410> I

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440 
me know what you want and right here I

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:02.990 
me know what you want and right here I
should<00:05:01.980> have<00:05:02.070> planted<00:05:02.310> that<00:05:02.430> bomb<00:05:02.580> but<00:05:02.820> I<00:05:02.880> was

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.000 
should have planted that bomb but I was

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.500 
should have planted that bomb but I was
just<00:05:03.030> like<00:05:03.680> going<00:05:04.680> for<00:05:04.830> kills<00:05:05.070> because<00:05:05.510> our

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:06.510 
just like going for kills because our

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:08.840 
just like going for kills because our
team<00:05:06.720> was<00:05:06.900> completely<00:05:07.730> obliterating<00:05:08.730> these

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:08.850 
team was completely obliterating these

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:11.930 
team was completely obliterating these
guys<00:05:09.090> and<00:05:09.360> they<00:05:10.080> never<00:05:10.200> had<00:05:10.380> a<00:05:10.410> chance<00:05:10.520> and<00:05:11.520> I

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:11.940 
guys and they never had a chance and I

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:13.850 
guys and they never had a chance and I
think<00:05:12.600> this<00:05:12.780> is<00:05:12.840> towards<00:05:13.260> the<00:05:13.290> end<00:05:13.470> of<00:05:13.530> my<00:05:13.590> game

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:13.860 
think this is towards the end of my game

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:17.500 
think this is towards the end of my game
so<00:05:15.140> definitely<00:05:16.140> in<00:05:16.440> the<00:05:16.560> comments<00:05:17.040> section
