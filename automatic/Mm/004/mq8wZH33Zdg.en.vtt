00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.800 

and<00:01:47.920> then<00:01:48.070> I<00:01:48.130> pat<00:01:48.430> dry<00:01:48.700> just<00:01:49.630> a<00:01:49.810> little<00:01:50.049> bit

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
and then I pat dry just a little bit

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.389 
and then I pat dry just a little bit
just<00:01:52.810> the<00:01:52.990> big<00:01:53.140> drops<00:01:53.439> off<00:01:53.649> and<00:01:53.950> then<00:01:54.100> I<00:01:54.130> let<00:01:54.369> it

00:01:54.389 --> 00:01:54.399 
just the big drops off and then I let it

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:56.429 
just the big drops off and then I let it
air<00:01:54.610> dry<00:01:54.640> the<00:01:54.909> rest<00:01:55.090> of<00:01:55.299> the<00:01:55.390> way<00:01:55.509> one<00:01:56.409> thing

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:56.439 
air dry the rest of the way one thing

00:01:56.439 --> 00:01:58.770 
air dry the rest of the way one thing
that<00:01:56.860> I've<00:01:56.950> noticed<00:01:56.979> is<00:01:57.610> that<00:01:57.670> it's<00:01:58.090> harder<00:01:58.509> to

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
that I've noticed is that it's harder to

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.289 
that I've noticed is that it's harder to
rinse<00:01:59.200> off<00:01:59.409> I<00:01:59.920> should<00:02:00.549> probably<00:02:01.000> use<00:02:01.210> a

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:01.299 
rinse off I should probably use a

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:02.580 
rinse off I should probably use a
washcloth<00:02:01.720> with<00:02:01.780> it<00:02:02.049> because<00:02:02.229> it's<00:02:02.350> hard<00:02:02.530> to

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
washcloth with it because it's hard to

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.889 
washcloth with it because it's hard to
rinse<00:02:02.799> off<00:02:03.009> this<00:02:03.250> area<00:02:03.520> but<00:02:04.360> you<00:02:04.479> just<00:02:04.600> have<00:02:04.750> to

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:04.899 
rinse off this area but you just have to

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:06.510 
rinse off this area but you just have to

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:23.560 
two inches so put it kind of far away
right<00:04:21.470> on<00:04:21.620> the<00:04:21.739> bone<00:04:21.919> is<00:04:22.730> it<00:04:22.850> the<00:04:22.940> orbital<00:04:23.390> bone

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570 
right on the bone is it the orbital bone

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.500 
right on the bone is it the orbital bone
I<00:04:24.280> feel<00:04:25.280> like<00:04:25.400> it's<00:04:25.550> the<00:04:25.669> orbit<00:04:25.940> I<00:04:26.060> could<00:04:26.300> I

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:26.510 
I feel like it's the orbit I could I

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:28.720 
I feel like it's the orbit I could I
could<00:04:26.660> be<00:04:26.720> wrong<00:04:26.900> to<00:04:27.050> listen<00:04:27.320> but<00:04:27.919> on<00:04:28.190> the<00:04:28.490> bone

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:28.730 
could be wrong to listen but on the bone

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:31.300 
could be wrong to listen but on the bone
you<00:04:28.760> can<00:04:29.060> feel<00:04:29.480> it<00:04:29.660> on<00:04:29.870> your<00:04:30.140> eye<00:04:30.169> and<00:04:31.010> just<00:04:31.160> rub

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.310 
you can feel it on your eye and just rub

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:32.800 
you can feel it on your eye and just rub
it<00:04:31.340> there<00:04:31.610> because<00:04:31.850> it<00:04:32.030> will<00:04:32.300> move<00:04:32.570> in<00:04:32.720> the

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810 
it there because it will move in the

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:34.600 
it there because it will move in the
night<00:04:32.990> and<00:04:33.230> I<00:04:33.320> did<00:04:33.530> notice<00:04:33.800> after<00:04:34.130> I<00:04:34.280> stopped

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610 
night and I did notice after I stopped

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:36.850 
night and I did notice after I stopped
putting<00:04:34.970> it<00:04:35.120> right<00:04:35.330> next<00:04:35.990> to<00:04:36.200> my<00:04:36.230> eye<00:04:36.350> that<00:04:36.500> my

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
putting it right next to my eye that my

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.070 
putting it right next to my eye that my
eyes<00:04:36.919> were<00:04:37.220> better<00:04:37.520> in<00:04:37.700> the<00:04:37.730> morning<00:04:38.080> because

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080 
eyes were better in the morning because

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.650 
eyes were better in the morning because
when<00:04:39.440> it<00:04:39.560> moves<00:04:39.830> it<00:04:40.400> gets<00:04:40.669> in<00:04:40.880> your<00:04:40.910> eye<00:04:41.090> and

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:41.660 
when it moves it gets in your eye and

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:45.460 
when it moves it gets in your eye and
it'll<00:04:42.350> irritate<00:04:42.820> it'll<00:04:43.820> irritate<00:04:44.000> them<00:04:44.479> I<00:04:44.690> did

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:45.470 
it'll irritate it'll irritate them I did

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:47.260 
it'll irritate it'll irritate them I did
notice<00:04:45.680> that<00:04:45.830> that<00:04:46.160> did<00:04:46.460> make<00:04:46.610> an<00:04:46.760> immediate

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.270 
notice that that did make an immediate

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.469 
notice that that did make an immediate
difference<00:04:47.450> in<00:04:48.020> my<00:04:48.320> eyes<00:04:48.500> in<00:04:48.710> the<00:04:48.770> morning<00:04:49.479> but

00:04:50.469 --> 00:04:50.479 
difference in my eyes in the morning but

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:52.150 
difference in my eyes in the morning but
with<00:04:50.600> the<00:04:50.720> system<00:04:51.110> it's<00:04:51.260> been<00:04:51.440> great<00:04:51.710> it<00:04:52.040> is

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.160 
with the system it's been great it is

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.700 
with the system it's been great it is
kind<00:04:52.370> of<00:04:52.430> pricey<00:04:52.729> but<00:04:53.630> other<00:04:53.930> than<00:04:54.169> that<00:04:54.229> so

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:54.710
