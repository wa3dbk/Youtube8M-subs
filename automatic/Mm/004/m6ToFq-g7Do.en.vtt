00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:20.700
 the symmetry on both sides of the 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.940
 material ahead and behind what 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:27.480
 we name are 1000 baraldi 6 if os 

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:29.610
 look carefully around the edge of the phone is 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.800
 composed of a mars one of a material 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:33.450
 what's called penny what form what 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.340
 we call the frame skeleton is what you 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.399
 gives what the resistance brings and 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.170
 hardness to the terminal or all features 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.660
 identifiers apart in the strait 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.630
 design are the colors millimeters is the 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:49.210
 button one side of aluminum the far 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:52.300
 critical there was a more finished 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:54.129
 next to the reason that being because 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:01:01.170
 It is the most economical way 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:01:04.230
 general display equal to the second 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.210
 to turn it on 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:08.930
 and inside the display as you can 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:12.100
 observe we are talking about 5 inches 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.930
 with full hd resolution 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.220
 the pixel density increased 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.130
 considerably with respect to 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:20.170
 Previous models loading will be made 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:23.229
 443 pixels per inch a whole 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:25.350
 reference in the field of 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:25.350
 smartphones 

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:30.909
 has also changed the 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.690
 sonny interface being now much more 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:34.880
 attractive 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:37.280
 the live version is currently the 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:41.300
 version 4.1.2 because it is the same me 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:45.050
 living and the processor that brings the new 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:50.900
 smartphone xperia z is a room a 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:53.480
 snapdragon model of 2 gigabytes of memory 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.580
 internal equipment are 16 gigs and 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:58.630
 can expand thanks in login of 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.630
 up to 32 gigs 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.479
 is provided with nfc of 6 or nfc in the 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:07.299
 which will we be able to connect with 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:09.069
 different with different solutions with 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:12.580
 examples provided with nfc technology 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:14.650
 institute or speakers a new speaker 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.200
 how it will be charged later what 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.870
 we will see 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.370
 you think only 119 grams and 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.260
 mainly the advantage it has 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.790
 in front of the terminals is their 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.400
 resistance of liquids as you can 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.410
 observe as long as they are the 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:33.390
 is closed match we will be able to 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.390
 introduce any kind of problem 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:42.040
 even with wet hands we are going to 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:45.630
 to be able to access we will be able to slide 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.630
 by the problem virus 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:54.840
 the matter is interchangeable the battery 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.420
 we change him since it is a 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:00.390
 unibody design that is 2400 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.160
 milliamps and the work is just 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.710
 take out and this terminal is very important 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.260
 is a camera to the camera that removes this 

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:09.180
 team are 3 megapixels our 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.220
 full hd resolutions above all 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.830
 incorporates the new sensor exmor r that of 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:16.290
 soria and has also access sensor 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:17.720
 plant and shocking in photos as in 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.010
 video 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.780
 the front camera we are talking about 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.000
 a 2 megapixel camera also with 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.570
 resolution full hd and also has 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.570
 exmor sensor
