00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:06.440 

so<00:00:04.169> today<00:00:04.500> we're<00:00:04.710> going<00:00:04.799> to<00:00:04.890> talk<00:00:05.129> about<00:00:05.450> how

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
so today we're going to talk about how

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.880 
so today we're going to talk about how
we<00:00:06.509> monitor<00:00:07.079> the<00:00:07.200> health<00:00:07.349> of<00:00:07.740> SSDs<00:00:08.730> and<00:00:09.090> we've

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:09.890 
we monitor the health of SSDs and we've

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:13.100 
we monitor the health of SSDs and we've
began<00:00:10.890> to<00:00:11.190> use<00:00:11.430> a<00:00:11.850> technology<00:00:12.540> that's<00:00:12.930> been

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
began to use a technology that's been

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.220 
began to use a technology that's been
brought<00:00:13.290> over<00:00:13.500> from<00:00:13.740> the<00:00:13.830> hard<00:00:14.070> drive<00:00:14.220> world

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:15.230 
brought over from the hard drive world

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:18.069 
brought over from the hard drive world
technology<00:00:16.230> called<00:00:16.590> smart<00:00:17.009> which<00:00:17.189> stands<00:00:17.460> for

00:00:18.069 --> 00:00:18.079 
technology called smart which stands for

00:00:18.079 --> 00:00:20.149 
technology called smart which stands for
self-monitoring<00:00:19.079> analysis<00:00:19.679> and<00:00:19.829> reporting

00:00:20.149 --> 00:00:20.159 
self-monitoring analysis and reporting

00:00:20.159 --> 00:00:21.439 
self-monitoring analysis and reporting
technology<00:00:20.400> yep

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
technology yep

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.429 
technology yep
and<00:00:21.829> through<00:00:22.829> smart<00:00:23.249> we're<00:00:23.789> able<00:00:24.089> to<00:00:24.539> look<00:00:25.140> at

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
and through smart we're able to look at

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.700 
and through smart we're able to look at
different<00:00:25.919> key<00:00:26.130> attributes<00:00:26.699> of<00:00:26.849> the<00:00:26.939> SSD<00:00:27.710> in

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
different key attributes of the SSD in

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.669 
different key attributes of the SSD in
regards<00:00:29.279> to<00:00:29.369> overall<00:00:30.239> health<00:00:30.359> of<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:31.409> drive

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
regards to overall health of the drive

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.650 
regards to overall health of the drive
Smart's<00:00:32.250> been<00:00:32.399> around<00:00:32.610> a<00:00:32.790> long<00:00:32.970> time<00:00:33.210> it's<00:00:33.570> a

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
Smart's been around a long time it's a

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.720 
Smart's been around a long time it's a
hard<00:00:33.870> drive<00:00:34.020> technology<00:00:34.230> really<00:00:34.890> it<00:00:35.010> was<00:00:35.160> kind

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
hard drive technology really it was kind

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.100 
hard drive technology really it was kind
of<00:00:35.760> brought<00:00:35.910> about<00:00:36.210> to<00:00:36.450> let<00:00:36.630> you<00:00:36.660> know<00:00:36.900> there

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
of brought about to let you know there

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.870 
of brought about to let you know there
was<00:00:37.230> like<00:00:37.260> an<00:00:37.500> impending<00:00:37.800> failure<00:00:38.190> right<00:00:38.610> you

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:38.880 
was like an impending failure right you

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.220 
was like an impending failure right you
would<00:00:39.030> you<00:00:39.150> would<00:00:39.270> get<00:00:39.420> these<00:00:39.570> smart<00:00:39.840> warnings

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
would you would get these smart warnings

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.930 
would you would get these smart warnings
like<00:00:40.290> hey<00:00:40.500> you're<00:00:41.040> having<00:00:41.310> Drive<00:00:41.520> errors<00:00:41.790> and

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
like hey you're having Drive errors and

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:42.860 
like hey you're having Drive errors and
things<00:00:42.030> like<00:00:42.210> that<00:00:42.420> you<00:00:42.510> might<00:00:42.630> want<00:00:42.690> to

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
things like that you might want to

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.170 
things like that you might want to
replace<00:00:43.110> it<00:00:43.320> well<00:00:43.470> you<00:00:44.400> know<00:00:44.460> we<00:00:44.580> ought<00:00:44.850> put<00:00:45.060> to

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
replace it well you know we ought put to

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.060 
replace it well you know we ought put to
smart<00:00:45.480> but<00:00:45.810> what<00:00:45.960> we<00:00:46.110> output<00:00:46.470> -<00:00:46.650> basically

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
smart but what we output - basically

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.680 
smart but what we output - basically
it's<00:00:47.220> kind<00:00:47.340> of<00:00:47.460> flash<00:00:47.730> we're<00:00:48.000> right<00:00:48.240> so<00:00:48.480> what

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
it's kind of flash we're right so what

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.450 
it's kind of flash we're right so what
customers<00:00:49.140> are<00:00:49.200> able<00:00:49.440> to<00:00:49.470> do<00:00:49.650> there's

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
customers are able to do there's

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.220 
customers are able to do there's
actually<00:00:50.730> a<00:00:50.790> couple<00:00:50.880> things<00:00:51.210> we<00:00:51.360> can<00:00:51.390> we<00:00:52.110> have

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
actually a couple things we can we have

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.950 
actually a couple things we can we have
an<00:00:52.380> attribute<00:00:52.920> called<00:00:53.190> SSD<00:00:53.640> life<00:00:54.180> left<00:00:54.450> which

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
an attribute called SSD life left which

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.300 
an attribute called SSD life left which
is<00:00:55.080> kind<00:00:55.230> of<00:00:55.290> cool<00:00:55.470> I<00:00:55.500> mean<00:00:55.740> you're<00:00:55.980> really<00:00:56.070> the

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:56.310 
is kind of cool I mean you're really the

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:57.410 
is kind of cool I mean you're really the
best<00:00:56.340> way<00:00:56.610> to<00:00:56.670> think<00:00:56.790> of<00:00:56.910> it<00:00:56.970> it's<00:00:57.060> like<00:00:57.150> a<00:00:57.210> gas

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
best way to think of it it's like a gas

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.300 
best way to think of it it's like a gas
gauge<00:00:57.660> almost<00:00:58.110> right<00:00:58.320> you<00:00:58.740> know<00:00:58.829> you<00:00:58.920> you're

00:00:59.300 --> 00:00:59.310 
gauge almost right you know you you're

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:01.340 
gauge almost right you know you you're
every<00:00:59.700> time<00:01:00.000> you<00:01:00.150> write<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.570> an<00:01:00.660> SSD<00:01:00.870> you<00:01:01.050> wear

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
every time you write to an SSD you wear

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.140 
every time you write to an SSD you wear
it<00:01:01.470> up<00:01:01.560> just<00:01:01.800> a<00:01:01.920> little<00:01:01.950> bit<00:01:02.280> you<00:01:02.790> know<00:01:02.820> think

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:03.150 
it up just a little bit you know think

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:04.490 
it up just a little bit you know think
of<00:01:03.240> it<00:01:03.360> as<00:01:03.510> just<00:01:03.690> using<00:01:03.810> up<00:01:04.019> a<00:01:04.110> little<00:01:04.290> bit<00:01:04.409> of

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
of it as just using up a little bit of

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.590 
of it as just using up a little bit of
gas<00:01:04.650> it<00:01:04.949> starts<00:01:05.220> at<00:01:05.309> 100<00:01:05.790> and<00:01:05.970> kind<00:01:06.390> of<00:01:06.450> will

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
gas it starts at 100 and kind of will

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.030 
gas it starts at 100 and kind of will
kind<00:01:06.840> of<00:01:06.930> dwindle<00:01:07.230> all<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.440> way<00:01:07.500> down<00:01:07.680> to<00:01:07.830> zero

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
kind of dwindle all the way down to zero

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.560 
kind of dwindle all the way down to zero
it's<00:01:08.250> going<00:01:08.280> to<00:01:08.430> take<00:01:08.610> you<00:01:08.730> many<00:01:08.970> years<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.450> do

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
it's going to take you many years to do

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.149 
it's going to take you many years to do
that<00:01:09.750> but<00:01:10.260> it's<00:01:10.380> a<00:01:10.470> way<00:01:10.620> to<00:01:10.650> kind<00:01:10.920> of<00:01:10.980> monitor

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
that but it's a way to kind of monitor

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.920 
that but it's a way to kind of monitor
the<00:01:11.520> life<00:01:11.700> of<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.030> SSD<00:01:12.450> and<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.659> health<00:01:12.810> of

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
the life of the SSD and the health of

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.899 
the life of the SSD and the health of
USSD<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:14.100> other<00:01:14.250> couple<00:01:14.520> of<00:01:14.580> things<00:01:14.730> that<00:01:14.790> are

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
USSD the other couple of things that are

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.850 
USSD the other couple of things that are
there<00:01:15.150> what's<00:01:15.360> really<00:01:15.690> cool<00:01:15.960> are<00:01:16.260> you<00:01:16.650> can

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
there what's really cool are you can

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.250 
there what's really cool are you can
look<00:01:17.070> at<00:01:17.280> host<00:01:17.610> writes<00:01:17.940> and<00:01:18.240> flash<00:01:18.960> writes

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:19.260 
look at host writes and flash writes

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.140 
look at host writes and flash writes
right<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:19.860> so<00:01:20.250> you<00:01:20.310> can<00:01:20.520> really<00:01:20.729> kind<00:01:21.030> of

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
right and so you can really kind of

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.550 
right and so you can really kind of
determine<00:01:21.540> your<00:01:21.659> own<00:01:21.750> laughs<00:01:21.990> and<00:01:22.320> you<00:01:22.500> know

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
determine your own laughs and you know

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.219 
determine your own laughs and you know
we<00:01:22.650> talked<00:01:22.890> about<00:01:23.010> laughs<00:01:23.940> and<00:01:24.270> tbw<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:25.110> how

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
we talked about laughs and tbw and how

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.640 
we talked about laughs and tbw and how
it's<00:01:25.380> kind<00:01:25.560> of<00:01:25.620> it<00:01:25.890> really<00:01:26.190> is<00:01:26.280> dependent<00:01:26.940> on

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:27.650 
it's kind of it really is dependent on

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.410 
it's kind of it really is dependent on
your<00:01:28.650> own<00:01:28.710> workload<00:01:29.040> right<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.970> wife<00:01:30.150> that<00:01:30.360> I

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
your own workload right the wife that I

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.030 
your own workload right the wife that I
have<00:01:30.720> might<00:01:31.020> be<00:01:31.049> different<00:01:31.560> than<00:01:31.770> the

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
have might be different than the

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.200 
have might be different than the
laughter<00:01:32.310> you<00:01:32.430> have<00:01:32.580> right<00:01:32.760> whether<00:01:32.909> I<00:01:33.000> play

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
laughter you have right whether I play

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.910 
laughter you have right whether I play
games<00:01:33.360> whether<00:01:33.720> your<00:01:33.870> Photoshop<00:01:34.320> guy<00:01:34.500> any<00:01:34.799> of

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
games whether your Photoshop guy any of

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:35.990 
games whether your Photoshop guy any of
that<00:01:35.070> that<00:01:35.280> that's<00:01:35.400> all<00:01:35.640> going<00:01:35.790> to<00:01:35.850> make<00:01:35.940> a

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
that that that's all going to make a

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.480 
that that that's all going to make a
difference<00:01:36.450> so<00:01:37.080> with<00:01:37.470> with<00:01:37.860> those<00:01:38.010> features

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
difference so with with those features

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.340 
difference so with with those features
you<00:01:38.670> can<00:01:38.790> actually<00:01:39.060> take<00:01:39.180> a<00:01:39.210> look<00:01:39.420> and<00:01:39.600> see<00:01:39.810> how

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
you can actually take a look and see how

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.590 
you can actually take a look and see how
many<00:01:40.590> how<00:01:40.950> many<00:01:40.979> writes<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.850> host<00:01:42.090> is<00:01:42.330> saying

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
many how many writes the host is saying

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.480 
many how many writes the host is saying
that<00:01:42.780> it's<00:01:42.900> doing<00:01:43.200> versus<00:01:43.860> how<00:01:44.010> many<00:01:44.070> flash

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
that it's doing versus how many flash

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.460 
that it's doing versus how many flash
drives<00:01:44.790> how<00:01:44.970> many<00:01:45.150> how<00:01:45.510> many<00:01:45.540> writes<00:01:45.869> our<00:01:46.020> SSD

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
drives how many how many writes our SSD

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.109 
drives how many how many writes our SSD
is<00:01:46.590> actually<00:01:46.979> doing<00:01:47.280> in<00:01:47.430> that<00:01:47.520> case<00:01:47.729> and<00:01:47.970> so

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
is actually doing in that case and so

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.210 
is actually doing in that case and so
it'll<00:01:48.900> give<00:01:49.020> you<00:01:49.110> a<00:01:49.170> good<00:01:49.350> gauge<00:01:49.560> as<00:01:49.830> to<00:01:49.860> kind

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
it'll give you a good gauge as to kind

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.800 
it'll give you a good gauge as to kind
of<00:01:50.340> you<00:01:50.520> know<00:01:50.580> what<00:01:50.880> to<00:01:51.000> expect<00:01:51.360> and<00:01:51.510> how<00:01:51.630> long

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
of you know what to expect and how long

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.170 
of you know what to expect and how long
your<00:01:51.960> SSD<00:01:52.200> will<00:01:52.470> last<00:01:52.619> cool<00:01:53.369> so<00:01:53.610> we<00:01:53.729> actually

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
your SSD will last cool so we actually

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.690 
your SSD will last cool so we actually
provide<00:01:54.420> a<00:01:54.659> software<00:01:55.470> tool<00:01:55.680> to<00:01:55.920> look<00:01:56.340> at<00:01:56.520> this

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
provide a software tool to look at this

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.730 
provide a software tool to look at this
yeah<00:01:57.119> it's<00:01:57.299> our<00:01:57.420> toolbox<00:01:57.780> yeah<00:01:58.020> exactly<00:01:58.320> right

and so it's our Kingston toolbox you can
use<00:02:00.570> it<00:02:00.689> on<00:02:00.750> all<00:02:00.900> of<00:02:00.960> our<00:02:01.110> SSDs<00:02:01.619> get<00:02:02.460> it<00:02:02.549> off<00:02:02.670> of

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
use it on all of our SSDs get it off of

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.670 
use it on all of our SSDs get it off of
our<00:02:02.939> website<00:02:03.360> and<00:02:03.540> it's<00:02:04.020> really<00:02:04.200> easy<00:02:04.290> to<00:02:04.439> run

different things with the drive but it
really<00:02:12.050> is<00:02:12.230> just<00:02:12.260> a<00:02:12.500> way<00:02:12.770> to<00:02:12.830> kind<00:02:13.160> of<00:02:13.220> monitor

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
really is just a way to kind of monitor

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.580 
really is just a way to kind of monitor
you<00:02:13.970> know<00:02:14.030> the<00:02:14.209> aware<00:02:14.510> of<00:02:14.630> that<00:02:14.750> we<00:02:15.260> also<00:02:15.410> have

you know the aware of that we also have

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.350 
you know the aware of that we also have
a<00:02:15.620> Linux<00:02:15.890> tool<00:02:16.130> that<00:02:16.790> you<00:02:16.880> can<00:02:17.000> do<00:02:17.090> the<00:02:17.209> same

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
a Linux tool that you can do the same

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.910 
a Linux tool that you can do the same
with<00:02:17.510> so<00:02:17.720> our<00:02:17.840> Linux<00:02:18.140> users<00:02:18.470> you<00:02:18.650> know<00:02:18.770> we're

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
with so our Linux users you know we're

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.230 
with so our Linux users you know we're
not<00:02:19.040> kind<00:02:19.310> of<00:02:19.340> forgetting<00:02:19.700> about<00:02:19.790> them<00:02:20.060> as

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
not kind of forgetting about them as

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.420 
not kind of forgetting about them as

well so it's nice great so it sounds
like<00:02:22.459> we<00:02:22.610> really<00:02:22.760> have<00:02:23.110> kind<00:02:24.110> of<00:02:24.200> endurance

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
like we really have kind of endurance

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.280 
like we really have kind of endurance
covered<00:02:25.040> and<00:02:25.160> a<00:02:25.220> way<00:02:25.340> to<00:02:25.750> monitor<00:02:26.750> that<00:02:26.900> as<00:02:27.080> a

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
covered and a way to monitor that as a

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.229 
covered and a way to monitor that as a
user<00:02:27.560> definitely<00:02:28.310> yeah<00:02:28.550> yeah<00:02:28.819> I<00:02:28.850> mean<00:02:28.970> I<00:02:29.090> would

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:29.239 
user definitely yeah yeah I mean I would

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:31.210 
user definitely yeah yeah I mean I would
say<00:02:29.390> in<00:02:29.450> most<00:02:29.690> times<00:02:29.959> got<00:02:30.620> it's<00:02:30.890> like<00:02:31.010> you<00:02:31.100> and

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
say in most times got it's like you and

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:32.229 
say in most times got it's like you and
you<00:02:31.310> have<00:02:31.400> to<00:02:31.489> worry<00:02:31.640> about<00:02:31.790> it<00:02:32.000> for<00:02:32.150> the<00:02:32.209> first

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
you have to worry about it for the first

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:33.760 
you have to worry about it for the first
year<00:02:32.630> or<00:02:32.690> two<00:02:32.840> but<00:02:32.989> we<00:02:33.050> do<00:02:33.260> get<00:02:33.350> people<00:02:33.500> that

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
year or two but we do get people that

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:34.960 
year or two but we do get people that
look<00:02:33.950> and<00:02:34.130> I<00:02:34.190> think<00:02:34.220> on<00:02:34.489> our<00:02:34.580> enterprise

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
look and I think on our enterprise

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.780 
look and I think on our enterprise
customers<00:02:35.050> it<00:02:36.050> really<00:02:36.440> helps<00:02:36.830> us<00:02:37.010> help<00:02:37.580> them

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
customers it really helps us help them

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.520 
customers it really helps us help them
understand<00:02:38.330> their<00:02:38.510> workload<00:02:38.900> right<00:02:39.110> a<00:02:39.140> lot<00:02:39.440> of

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
understand their workload right a lot of

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.229 
understand their workload right a lot of
them<00:02:39.620> maybe<00:02:39.739> don't<00:02:40.040> realize<00:02:40.370> how<00:02:40.819> much<00:02:41.000> data

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:41.239 
them maybe don't realize how much data

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:42.699 
them maybe don't realize how much data
they're<00:02:41.450> writing<00:02:41.720> or<00:02:41.840> how<00:02:41.870> compressible<00:02:42.590> it

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
they're writing or how compressible it

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:44.620 
they're writing or how compressible it
is<00:02:42.860> so<00:02:43.400> with<00:02:43.519> our<00:02:43.640> enterprise<00:02:43.880> drives<00:02:44.450> like

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
is so with our enterprise drives like

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.259 
is so with our enterprise drives like
the<00:02:44.750> e100<00:02:45.050> and<00:02:45.440> ones<00:02:45.590> like<00:02:45.769> that<00:02:45.980> we<00:02:46.190> output<00:02:46.580> we

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:47.269 
the e100 and ones like that we output we

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:49.420 
the e100 and ones like that we output we
have<00:02:47.510> some<00:02:47.690> special<00:02:48.170> enterprise<00:02:48.890> attributes

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
have some special enterprise attributes

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.790 
have some special enterprise attributes
that<00:02:50.150> we<00:02:50.480> can<00:02:50.630> that<00:02:50.930> will<00:02:51.050> output<00:02:51.410> to<00:02:51.620> and<00:02:51.739> it

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
that we can that will output to and it

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.320 
that we can that will output to and it
helps<00:02:52.040> them<00:02:52.160> track<00:02:52.459> that<00:02:52.670> we're<00:02:52.850> right<00:02:53.150> you

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330 
helps them track that we're right you

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.390 
helps them track that we're right you
