the other thing we just did this is the
only<00:03:02.740> part<00:03:02.980> about<00:03:03.190> it<00:03:03.340> on<00:03:03.459> at<00:03:03.700> the<00:03:03.760> bottom<00:03:04.080> now

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
what it's doing is it's creating a

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.170 
what it's doing is it's creating a
variable<00:03:07.030> called<00:03:07.300> dead<00:03:08.250> inside<00:03:09.250> it<00:03:09.430> it's

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
variable called dead inside it it's

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.740 
variable called dead inside it it's
starting<00:03:10.750> this<00:03:11.290> batch<00:03:11.770> file<00:03:12.239> so<00:03:13.239> make<00:03:13.720> sure

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
starting this batch file so make sure

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.530 
starting this batch file so make sure
you<00:03:14.410> put<00:03:14.590> the<00:03:14.739> name<00:03:14.890> of<00:03:15.070> it<00:03:15.190> here<00:03:15.519> so<00:03:16.239> if<00:03:16.390> you

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
you put the name of it here so if you

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.740 
you put the name of it here so if you
called<00:03:16.840> it<00:03:17.160> blue<00:03:18.160> screen<00:03:18.580> then<00:03:19.000> right<00:03:19.269> blue

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
called it blue screen then right blue

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.750 
called it blue screen then right blue
screen<00:03:20.640> dot<00:03:21.640> dat<00:03:22.650> and<00:03:23.650> then<00:03:23.950> it<00:03:24.130> says<00:03:24.340> go<00:03:24.730> to

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
screen dot dat and then it says go to

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.000 
screen dot dat and then it says go to
dead<00:03:25.209> so<00:03:25.930> it<00:03:26.019> goes<00:03:26.170> back<00:03:26.440> to<00:03:26.680> the<00:03:26.769> dead

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
dead so it goes back to the dead

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.699 
dead so it goes back to the dead
variable<00:03:27.580> and<00:03:27.820> does<00:03:28.330> it<00:03:28.450> again<00:03:28.750> and<00:03:29.530> it<00:03:29.620> will

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
variable and does it again and it will

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:31.500 
variable and does it again and it will
keep<00:03:29.860> on<00:03:30.040> doing<00:03:30.340> that<00:03:30.489> and<00:03:30.670> eventually

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
keep on doing that and eventually

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:36.000 
keep on doing that and eventually
freezer<00:03:32.320> computer<00:03:33.450> and<00:03:34.450> that<00:03:34.690> was<00:03:35.590> the<00:03:35.800> blue

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
freezer computer and that was the blue

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.300 
freezer computer and that was the blue
screen<00:03:36.310> of<00:03:36.580> death<00:03:36.959> tutorial<00:03:38.010> thank<00:03:39.010> you<00:03:39.100> for
