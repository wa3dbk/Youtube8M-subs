00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.259 
real car so let's start off with the
chassis<00:00:55.559> now<00:00:55.769> chassis<00:00:56.069> is<00:00:56.280> simple<00:00:56.699> just<00:00:56.879> get

acceleration<00:01:01.559> speed<00:01:02.039> I<00:01:02.280> think<00:01:02.819> this<00:01:02.940> is

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:02.999 
acceleration speed I think this is

00:01:02.999 --> 00:01:05.149 
acceleration speed I think this is
similar<00:01:03.359> to<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.719> Baltic<00:01:04.199> speed<00:01:04.500> which<00:01:04.979> is

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
similar to the Baltic speed which is

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.469 
similar to the Baltic speed which is
quite<00:01:05.430> impressive<00:01:05.760> to<00:01:06.060> me<00:01:06.150> because<00:01:06.299> the

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
quite impressive to me because the

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:07.880 
quite impressive to me because the
voltage<00:01:06.600> is<00:01:06.869> actually<00:01:07.200> one<00:01:07.619> of<00:01:07.650> my<00:01:07.799> favorite

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890

buggy<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.410> vary<00:01:40.620> I<00:01:40.890> guess<00:01:41.370> not<00:01:42.060> street-ready

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
buggy to vary I guess not street-ready

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.440 
buggy to vary I guess not street-ready
car<00:01:43.530> or<00:01:43.740> street-ready<00:01:44.010> vehicle<00:01:44.520> but<00:01:45.000> with<00:01:45.330> the

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
car or street-ready vehicle but with the

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.060 
car or street-ready vehicle but with the
upgrades<00:01:45.840> you<00:01:45.930> can<00:01:46.110> make<00:01:46.260> to<00:01:46.410> it<00:01:46.530> this<00:01:46.800> thing

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
upgrades you can make to it this thing

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.250 
upgrades you can make to it this thing
can<00:01:47.280> be<00:01:47.310> Street<00:01:47.820> ready<00:01:48.000> all<00:01:48.240> day<00:01:48.270> especially

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:49.260 
can be Street ready all day especially

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.590 
can be Street ready all day especially
how<00:01:49.860> cool<00:01:50.250> it<00:01:50.370> looks<00:01:50.400> right<00:01:50.909> now<00:01:50.970> like<00:01:51.330> I'm<00:01:51.420> not

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
how cool it looks right now like I'm not

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.330 
how cool it looks right now like I'm not
even<00:01:51.720> done<00:01:51.960> upgrading<00:01:52.530> but<00:01:53.040> it<00:01:53.130> looks

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
even done upgrading but it looks

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.120 
even done upgrading but it looks
freaking<00:01:54.000> cool<00:01:54.330> my<00:01:54.480> opinion<00:01:54.780> now<00:01:55.290> this<00:01:55.800> car

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
freaking cool my opinion now this car

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.330 
freaking cool my opinion now this car
speed<00:01:56.610> is<00:01:56.900> similar<00:01:57.900> to<00:01:58.409> that<00:01:58.560> of<00:01:58.620> an<00:01:58.890> adder<00:01:59.159> or

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
speed is similar to that of an adder or

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.610 
speed is similar to that of an adder or
an<00:01:59.610> entity<00:01:59.820> for<00:02:00.210> some<00:02:00.330> reason<00:02:00.690> it's<00:02:01.050> very<00:02:01.380> high

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:01.620 
an entity for some reason it's very high

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.890 
an entity for some reason it's very high
up<00:02:01.650> there<00:02:01.920> it's<00:02:02.100> very<00:02:02.190> quick<00:02:02.790> it's<00:02:03.030> very<00:02:03.540> small

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:03.900 
up there it's very quick it's very small

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.080 
up there it's very quick it's very small
and<00:02:04.080> the<00:02:04.409> acceleration<00:02:04.620> it<00:02:05.070> puts<00:02:05.280> out<00:02:05.460> is<00:02:05.640> very

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
and the acceleration it puts out is very

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.139 
and the acceleration it puts out is very
very<00:02:06.420> quick<00:02:07.050> like<00:02:07.229> it's<00:02:07.260> like<00:02:07.800> the<00:02:08.399> I<00:02:08.610> guess<00:02:08.879> 0

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
very quick like it's like the I guess 0

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.240 
very quick like it's like the I guess 0
to<00:02:09.269> 60<00:02:09.569> I<00:02:09.599> guess<00:02:09.840> it<00:02:10.080> translation<00:02:10.590> be<00:02:10.709> just

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
to 60 I guess it translation be just

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.879 
to 60 I guess it translation be just
equal<00:02:12.000> to<00:02:12.269> the<00:02:13.019> voltage<00:02:13.469> because<00:02:13.709> the<00:02:13.769> voltage

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:13.889 
equal to the voltage because the voltage

00:02:13.889 --> 00:02:15.559 
equal to the voltage because the voltage
acceleration<00:02:14.489> is<00:02:14.579> very<00:02:14.730> fast<00:02:15.060> because<00:02:15.359> it<00:02:15.480> is

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
acceleration is very fast because it is

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.790 
acceleration is very fast because it is
electric<00:02:15.810> car<00:02:16.109> this<00:02:16.650> car<00:02:16.709> is<00:02:17.159> equally

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
electric car this car is equally

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.370 
electric car this car is equally
is<00:02:17.830> good<00:02:18.040> i<00:02:18.130> believe<00:02:18.460> i<00:02:18.760> do<00:02:19.510> appreciate<00:02:19.960> the

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
hardtop with this car and the color

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.570 
hardtop with this car and the color
schemes<00:02:22.660> you<00:02:22.810> can<00:02:22.990> pick<00:02:23.200> are<00:02:23.380> pretty<00:02:23.770> nice<00:02:23.980> now

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
schemes you can pick are pretty nice now

schemes you can pick are pretty nice now
you<00:02:24.640> can<00:02:24.850> either<00:02:24.940> go<00:02:25.180> with<00:02:25.300> the<00:02:25.420> two-tone<00:02:25.810> with

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
you can either go with the two-tone with

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.060 
you can either go with the two-tone with
the<00:02:26.020> stripe<00:02:26.230> in<00:02:26.380> the<00:02:26.410> middle<00:02:26.500> or<00:02:26.770> just<00:02:26.950> have

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:29.970 
the stripe in the middle or just have
one<00:02:27.310> solid<00:02:27.700> color<00:02:27.880> I<00:02:28.180> do<00:02:28.480> believe<00:02:28.900> I<00:02:29.080> go<00:02:29.470> with<00:02:29.800> a

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
one solid color I do believe I go with a

one solid color when I decided to pick

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.010 
one solid color when I decided to pick
this<00:02:32.650> but<00:02:33.250> the<00:02:33.490> striped<00:02:33.940> does<00:02:34.540> look<00:02:34.720> good<00:02:34.870> when

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
this but the striped does look good when

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.160 
this but the striped does look good when
you<00:02:35.110> have<00:02:35.140> bright<00:02:35.740> colors<00:02:36.270> earlier<00:02:37.270> this<00:02:37.960> week

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.520 
now that I mentioned it you guys are
probably<00:02:48.820> like<00:02:49.060> oh<00:02:49.210> man<00:02:49.450> yeah<00:02:49.810> it<00:02:50.290> does<00:02:50.500> look

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
probably like oh man yeah it does look

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.320 
probably like oh man yeah it does look
like<00:02:50.680> the<00:02:50.950> toys<00:02:51.190> toy<00:02:51.340> RC<00:02:51.550> car<00:02:51.910> so<00:02:52.060> it's<00:02:52.180> pretty

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
like the toys toy RC car so it's pretty

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.510 
like the toys toy RC car so it's pretty
funny<00:02:52.570> and<00:02:52.810> I<00:02:53.500> think<00:02:53.590> I<00:02:53.830> end<00:02:54.160> up<00:02:54.220> going<00:02:54.400> with

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:54.520 
funny and I think I end up going with

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.820 
funny and I think I end up going with
wine<00:02:54.760> red<00:02:55.120> as<00:02:55.300> my<00:02:55.450> primary<00:02:55.690> color<00:02:56.200> with<00:02:56.800> the

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
wine red as my primary color with the

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:58.860 
wine red as my primary color with the
pearlescent<00:02:57.280> coat<00:02:57.910> of<00:02:58.150> like<00:02:58.390> white<00:02:58.840> or

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
pearlescent coat of like white or

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.630 
pearlescent coat of like white or
something<00:02:59.470> or<00:02:59.620> something<00:03:00.070> along<00:03:00.250> those<00:03:00.520> lines

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
something or something along those lines

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.670 
something or something along those lines
to<00:03:00.970> make<00:03:01.090> the<00:03:01.240> red<00:03:01.390> really<00:03:01.660> shine<00:03:01.990> I<00:03:02.230> don't

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
to make the red really shine I don't

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.470 
to make the red really shine I don't
know<00:03:02.770> why<00:03:03.010> but<00:03:03.040> a<00:03:03.310> lot<00:03:03.640> of<00:03:03.670> cars<00:03:04.060> in<00:03:04.180> this<00:03:04.300> game

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
know why but a lot of cars in this game

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.810 
know why but a lot of cars in this game
look<00:03:04.810> really<00:03:05.440> really<00:03:05.740> nice<00:03:06.070> with<00:03:06.730> the

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:06.820 
look really really nice with the

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.160 
look really really nice with the
pearlescent<00:03:07.090> coat<00:03:07.510> and<00:03:07.660> if<00:03:07.750> you<00:03:07.840> have<00:03:07.930> never

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
pearlescent coat and if you have never

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:09.780 
pearlescent coat and if you have never
done<00:03:08.440> a<00:03:08.500> pearlescent<00:03:08.800> coat<00:03:09.100> I<00:03:09.310> highly

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
done a pearlescent coat I highly

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.100 
done a pearlescent coat I highly
recommend<00:03:09.940> it<00:03:10.330> just<00:03:10.510> to<00:03:10.600> see<00:03:10.720> what<00:03:10.840> it's<00:03:10.960> like

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
recommend it just to see what it's like

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.170 
recommend it just to see what it's like
so<00:03:11.740> I'm<00:03:12.070> just<00:03:12.340> gonna<00:03:12.430> fast<00:03:12.730> forward<00:03:12.850> right
