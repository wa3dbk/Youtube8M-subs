very<00:00:33.809> easy<00:00:33.989> to<00:00:34.110> scratch<00:00:34.500> up<00:00:34.559> like<00:00:35.430> I<00:00:35.610> did<00:00:35.820> over

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
very easy to scratch up like I did over

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.690 
very easy to scratch up like I did over
here<00:00:36.620> stuff<00:00:37.620> on<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:37.890> sides<00:00:38.160> when<00:00:38.579> you're

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
so what I have is part of the old broken

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.130 
so what I have is part of the old broken
one<00:00:42.120> because<00:00:42.300> I'm<00:00:42.390> not<00:00:42.540> going<00:00:42.690> to<00:00:42.780> take<00:00:42.960> this

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
one because I'm not going to take this

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.709 
one because I'm not going to take this
back<00:00:43.440> apart<00:00:43.829> well<00:00:44.610> basically<00:00:44.879> you<00:00:45.420> want<00:00:45.629> to

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
back apart well basically you want to

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.959 
back apart well basically you want to
get<00:00:46.530> this<00:00:46.710> and<00:00:47.070> it<00:00:47.190> can<00:00:47.309> be<00:00:47.489> on<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.730> other<00:00:47.850> side

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
get this and it can be on the other side

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.350 
get this and it can be on the other side
of<00:00:48.690> this<00:00:48.899> middle<00:00:49.649> brace<00:00:50.039> here<00:00:50.430> cuz<00:00:50.940> it'll<00:00:51.120> you

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
of this middle brace here cuz it'll you

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.500 
of this middle brace here cuz it'll you
can<00:00:51.539> lift<00:00:51.719> it<00:00:51.840> up<00:00:51.960> and<00:00:52.140> actually<00:00:52.530> pop<00:00:53.039> it<00:00:53.280> in

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
can lift it up and actually pop it in

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.670 
can lift it up and actually pop it in
afterward<00:00:54.510> if<00:00:54.629> it<00:00:54.750> makes<00:00:54.960> your<00:00:55.079> life<00:00:55.140> easier

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
afterward if it makes your life easier

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.119 
afterward if it makes your life easier
but<00:00:56.370> I<00:00:56.610> kind<00:00:57.059> of<00:00:57.149> took<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.360> vise<00:00:57.660> grips<00:00:58.050> on<00:00:58.980> the

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
but I kind of took the vise grips on the

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.180 
but I kind of took the vise grips on the
side<00:00:59.370> like<00:00:59.640> this<00:01:00.050> twisted<00:01:01.050> them<00:01:01.170> with<00:01:01.320> a<00:01:01.350> with

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
side like this twisted them with a with

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.579 
side like this twisted them with a with
a<00:01:02.219> screwdriver<00:01:02.609> in<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.750> middle<00:01:04.049> like<00:01:04.260> like

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
a screwdriver in the middle like like

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.350 
a screwdriver in the middle like like
that<00:01:05.299> kind<00:01:06.299> of<00:01:06.390> prying<00:01:06.840> them<00:01:06.990> over<00:01:07.350> just<00:01:08.360> just

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
that kind of prying them over just just

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.550 
that kind of prying them over just just
fighting<00:01:09.810> them<00:01:09.900> you<00:01:10.049> know<00:01:10.140> you<00:01:10.260> might<00:01:10.439> you

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
fighting them you know you might you

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.780 
fighting them you know you might you
might<00:01:10.710> even<00:01:10.860> want<00:01:11.100> to<00:01:11.130> use<00:01:11.250> two<00:01:11.520> people

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
might even want to use two people

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.130 
might even want to use two people
probably<00:01:12.659> make<00:01:12.810> things<00:01:13.049> a<00:01:13.140> lot<00:01:13.290> easier<00:01:15.140> the

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
probably make things a lot easier the

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.730 
probably make things a lot easier the
other<00:01:16.170> side<00:01:16.710> when<00:01:17.400> I<00:01:17.490> did<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.790> other<00:01:17.939> side<00:01:18.270> I

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
other side when I did the other side I

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.499 
other side when I did the other side I
kind<00:01:19.740> of<00:01:19.830> poked<00:01:20.070> it<00:01:20.250> in<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.460> hole<00:01:20.670> first<00:01:21.119> and

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
kind of poked it in the hole first and

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.410 
kind of poked it in the hole first and
then<00:01:22.439> twisted<00:01:23.070> it<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:23.460> it<00:01:23.880> seemed<00:01:24.150> to<00:01:24.270> be<00:01:24.299> the

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
then twisted it and it seemed to be the

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.260 
then twisted it and it seemed to be the
only<00:01:24.630> way<00:01:24.840> to<00:01:24.869> get<00:01:25.170> that<00:01:25.350> in<00:01:25.590> and<00:01:26.159> what<00:01:26.970> I<00:01:27.000> ended

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
only way to get that in and what I ended

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.929 
only way to get that in and what I ended
up<00:01:27.390> doing<00:01:27.710> and<00:01:28.710> I<00:01:28.799> taped<00:01:29.100> up<00:01:29.310> this<00:01:29.460> side<00:01:29.759> and

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
up doing and I taped up this side and

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.219 
up doing and I taped up this side and
protected<00:01:30.479> it<00:01:30.600> and<00:01:30.630> everything

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
protected it and everything

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.200 
protected it and everything
these<00:01:31.590> lips<00:01:31.890> should<00:01:32.100> be<00:01:32.159> up<00:01:32.460> in<00:01:32.670> case<00:01:32.880> you<00:01:33.060> get

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
these lips should be up in case you get

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.300 
these lips should be up in case you get
confused<00:01:33.390> because<00:01:33.990> it's<00:01:34.200> it's<00:01:34.650> such<00:01:34.950> a<00:01:34.979> hard

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
confused because it's it's such a hard

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.030 
confused because it's it's such a hard
push<00:01:35.610> you're<00:01:35.880> gonna<00:01:36.000> hope<00:01:36.810> that<00:01:36.840> you<00:01:37.770> would

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
push you're gonna hope that you would

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.230 
push you're gonna hope that you would
almost<00:01:38.189> think<00:01:38.369> you<00:01:38.579> could<00:01:38.729> put<00:01:38.909> them<00:01:39.000> in<00:01:39.119> the

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
almost think you could put them in the

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.359 
almost think you could put them in the
other<00:01:39.360> way<00:01:39.630> but<00:01:39.930> no<00:01:40.200> they<00:01:40.439> got<00:01:40.860> to<00:01:40.979> go<00:01:41.070> in<00:01:41.189> like

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
other way but no they got to go in like

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.370 
other way but no they got to go in like
this<00:01:41.610> and<00:01:41.880> there's<00:01:42.689> a<00:01:42.720> lot<00:01:42.869> of<00:01:42.899> pressure<00:01:43.200> on

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
this and there's a lot of pressure on

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.800 
this and there's a lot of pressure on
them<00:01:43.649> and<00:01:43.890> you're<00:01:44.040> gonna<00:01:44.189> fight<00:01:44.460> them<00:01:44.610> in<00:01:44.810> and

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810
