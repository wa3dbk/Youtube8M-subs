00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:06.750
 hello welcome to your fantastic channel 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.150
 today I bring you a demonstration of this 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:15.139
 Mask called Pilates is a 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:15.139
 korean mile brand face mask 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:21.050
 I see how I bring anything makeup 

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:22.550
 Lying just as I bring mask 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.010
 I just put on the mask and the truth 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:27.050
 is that it leaves a very fresh feeling and 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:29.240
 soft and that's why I did not want to put 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:32.090
 makeup and that's not all because 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:34.640
 I'm going to show my skin more closely to 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:37.280
 that see the pimples that I have and I say 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.290
 I have because it did not really achieve me 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.440
 get out much that we say the truth almost 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:44.390
 nothing, I just feel like I waxed because I 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.910
 pulled off several little vellitos that I have in the 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.690
 face were if pimples shins not 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.970
 I saw as such 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.739
 that mask is made of silicone says that 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.899
 It is effective to clean the pores 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:56.210
 eliminate blackheads also acne 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:59.149
 which helps to remove fat and 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:01.489
 society more embedded in the skin 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:04.130
 cleans the pores deeply leaving 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:05.990
 a cleaner skin with pores 

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:07.850
 less visible I'll start with 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.759
 application of the mask but before 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.619
 of that I want you to notice my skin in this 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:14.600
 part of the media I have many 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:16.610
 pimples has this part I have the 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.580
 open forums 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:22.160
 now here I have these granites 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:25.210
 first I have to open the pores with 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.210
 hot water 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:31.640
 and as you see, since this city is 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:33.950
 I have to dry and now I'm going to open the 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.140
 special mask on how they are 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:39.260
 seeing 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:42.950
 and I'm going to start with the application in 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:44.630
 the indications of the mask that 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.690
 certainly not brings about 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.850
 I searched the internet to tell us that we have 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:53.500
 that apply it with your fingers 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:55.540
 preference since with a brush 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:59.110
 and it would be difficult and good, as they are 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:01.570
 seeing is the way we have to 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:04.240
 apply a generous amount of the 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.790
 bone mask that is somewhat thick and 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.530
 you have to avoid simple areas and 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.850
 here half the envelope of 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:14.680
 mask 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.680
 and I have to wait 20 minutes 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.440
 once the mask is dry 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.810
 it's time to remove the little by little we 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.060
 we can help from the other hand with a 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.880
 we will hold the skin and with the other 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.850
 we will be taking off the mask of this 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:36.030
 way will be much easier and we will not 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:39.180
 occasion we will damage the face but 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:42.540
 still for the crimes that it's like that 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:45.170
 a little painful but nothing that we of 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.170
 when supporting 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:06.480
 and well after a while I managed 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:09.310
 remove all the mask and as you see 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.830
 here I am mustache 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:14.020
 there were also parts that did not dry 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:17.080
 they stayed on the skin now they are 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:19.989
 seeing the mask how it looked and can 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:23.640
 see that it has like holes and 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:25.560
 also certain white dots 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:28.260
 and I really did not know what to appreciate the 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.520
 crimes that remain with king but you do not see 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.890
 very good 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:35.440
 this what these children look like are not 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:38.230
 pimples are howls of the mask 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:41.530
 as I mentioned earlier after 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:43.600
 I have to wash the face with cold water and 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:46.540
 dry until it is with a washcloth 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:49.600
 clean and finally ask for the 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:56.770
 instructions that we apply a tonic and 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:59.080
 Well that's how it is what he did 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:01.030
 it was if you decrease the pores and clean it 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:03.430
 somehow but actually the 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.740
 pimples I do not take it out the truth is 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:08.050
 that if I would buy it because I feel that 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:10.810
 maybe how was the envelope in this apply 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:12.550
 a thick layer maybe that's what I 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:15.460
 missed but what was the nose that is 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:17.380
 where I have more I feel that I put quantity 

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:19.420
 enough I decided to try it because 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.549
 he said that he eliminated blackheads and 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:23.890
 the acne the whole truth I feel that I do not 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:25.210
 eliminated a lot I hope it's 

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:27.580
 by the application that was not 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:29.860
 thick enough because I wanted to 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:32.020
 cover the largest amount of the face 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:34.120
 possible but since it was about maybe I 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.920
 it was convenient to apply it in these 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.550
 parts of here but nevertheless I tell them 

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:39.970
 the skin 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:42.370
 this soft this smooth closed some 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:44.290
 pores yes but they keep popping up 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:46.090
 pimples but well that's the first 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:48.900
 impression of this mask and they are already 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.900
 I wanted to share 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:54.110
 and well I say goodbye as always 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:56.150
 wishing you the best of the best and 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:58.759
 I hope you are very well we 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:01.219
 we are seeing in the next video is not going 

00:04:58.759 --> 00:05:05.530
 I bring this makeup and this is a 

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:05.530
 collaboration with my little friend damaris and 

00:05:07.509 --> 00:05:12.129
 that's how this makeup looks
