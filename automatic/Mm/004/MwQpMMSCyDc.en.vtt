00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
forever you guys know the applications

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.210 
forever you guys know the applications

expensive and hopefully they'll

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.600

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
are really expensive right now and

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.940 
are really expensive right now and
