00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
i thought was pretty dang cool someone

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:33.620 
i thought was pretty dang cool someone
brought<00:00:32.700> up<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:32.910> possibility<00:00:33.059> of<00:00:33.450> there

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
brought up the possibility of there

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.090 
brought up the possibility of there
being<00:00:33.660> a<00:00:33.870> horn<00:00:34.140> boating<00:00:34.440> titanfall<00:00:34.739> and

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
being a horn boating titanfall and

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.590 
being a horn boating titanfall and
apparently<00:00:35.730> it<00:00:35.790> sounded<00:00:36.059> like<00:00:36.090> there<00:00:36.300> was<00:00:36.329> a

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
apparently it sounded like there was a

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.869 
apparently it sounded like there was a
planned<00:00:37.260> version<00:00:38.100> of<00:00:38.219> some<00:00:38.430> sort<00:00:38.610> of<00:00:38.670> horde

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
planned version of some sort of horde

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.549 
planned version of some sort of horde
mode<00:00:39.030> where<00:00:39.540> I<00:00:39.570> guess<00:00:39.809> you<00:00:39.960> go<00:00:40.170> up<00:00:40.320> with<00:00:40.530> the

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
mode where I guess you go up with the

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.590 
mode where I guess you go up with the
team<00:00:40.829> against<00:00:41.280> just<00:00:41.610> obviously<00:00:41.910> minions<00:00:42.420> or

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
team against just obviously minions or

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.630 
team against just obviously minions or
BOTS<00:00:42.960> or<00:00:43.290> what<00:00:43.559> we<00:00:43.680> have<00:00:43.770> minions<00:00:44.160> bought<00:00:44.370> same

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
BOTS or what we have minions bought same

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.549 
BOTS or what we have minions bought same
thing<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:45.030> I<00:00:45.600> thought<00:00:45.930> this<00:00:46.050> would<00:00:46.200> be<00:00:46.260> pretty

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
thing and I thought this would be pretty

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.020 
thing and I thought this would be pretty
dang<00:00:46.710> cool<00:00:46.860> apparently<00:00:47.280> there<00:00:47.370> was<00:00:47.489> a<00:00:47.550> there's

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
dang cool apparently there was a there's

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.700 
dang cool apparently there was a there's
actually<00:00:48.360> a<00:00:48.390> piece<00:00:48.600> of<00:00:48.629> audio<00:00:48.809> that<00:00:49.440> they<00:00:49.559> did

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
actually a piece of audio that they did

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.260 
actually a piece of audio that they did
record<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:50.340> it<00:00:50.670> didn't<00:00:50.850> make<00:00:50.969> it<00:00:51.000> into<00:00:51.180> the

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
record and it didn't make it into the

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.610 
record and it didn't make it into the
final<00:00:51.570> game<00:00:51.750> or<00:00:51.899> some<00:00:52.020> I'll<00:00:52.140> added<00:00:52.440> this

before is just a lack of customization
but<00:01:22.439> just<00:01:22.860> think<00:01:22.979> about<00:01:23.100> if<00:01:23.340> you<00:01:23.430> could<00:01:23.549> maybe

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
but just think about if you could maybe

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.940 
but just think about if you could maybe
get<00:01:24.330> a<00:01:24.390> group<00:01:24.630> of<00:01:24.750> friends<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.320> entire<00:01:25.590> party

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
of six or a party of four and just go up

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.840 
of six or a party of four and just go up
against<00:01:28.530> a<00:01:28.590> whole<00:01:28.770> bunch<00:01:28.950> of<00:01:29.070> enemies<00:01:29.369> i<00:01:29.549> don't

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
funnest game mode and i don't know how

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:36.800 
funnest game mode and i don't know how
they<00:01:35.759> do<00:01:35.909> it<00:01:36.119> it<00:01:36.210> would<00:01:36.270> be<00:01:36.329> something<00:01:36.540> cool<00:01:36.750> to

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
they do it it would be something cool to

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.830 
they do it it would be something cool to
maybe<00:01:37.020> do<00:01:37.170> in<00:01:37.259> private<00:01:37.439> match<00:01:38.189> but<00:01:38.700> um<00:01:38.850> maybe

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
maybe do in private match but um maybe

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.030 
maybe do in private match but um maybe
it's<00:01:40.079> completely<00:01:40.380> different<00:01:40.439> from<00:01:40.650> classic

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
it's completely different from classic

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.469 
it's completely different from classic
multiplayer<00:01:41.430> maybe<00:01:41.610> this<00:01:41.820> own<00:01:42.000> brand<00:01:42.390> new

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
multiplayer maybe this own brand new

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.660 
multiplayer maybe this own brand new
game<00:01:42.659> oh<00:01:42.720> like<00:01:43.020> own<00:01:43.470> brand<00:01:43.740> new<00:01:43.799> playlist<00:01:44.220> so

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
game oh like own brand new playlist so

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.340 
game oh like own brand new playlist so
it's<00:01:44.759> not<00:01:44.820> even<00:01:45.060> in<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.180> classic<00:01:45.600> it's<00:01:45.750> like<00:01:45.990> a

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
it's not even in the classic it's like a

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.010 
it's not even in the classic it's like a
new<00:01:47.040> edition<00:01:47.490> but<00:01:47.820> it's<00:01:48.299> scary<00:01:48.630> what<00:01:48.930> if

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
new edition but it's scary what if

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.330 
new edition but it's scary what if
there's<00:01:49.140> be<00:01:49.290> something<00:01:49.590> like<00:01:49.680> zombies<00:01:50.220> for

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
there's be something like zombies for

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.380 
there's be something like zombies for
example<00:01:50.670> i<00:01:50.700> was<00:01:50.850> not<00:01:50.939> actually<00:01:51.060> part<00:01:51.240> of<00:01:51.329> the

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
example i was not actually part of the

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.670 
example i was not actually part of the
multiplayer<00:01:51.720> but<00:01:51.899> its<00:01:52.140> its<00:01:52.290> own<00:01:52.380> separate

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
multiplayer but its its own separate

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.109 
multiplayer but its its own separate
thing<00:01:52.890> that<00:01:53.369> was<00:01:53.490> some<00:01:53.579> of<00:01:53.640> that<00:01:53.759> be<00:01:53.880> really

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
thing that was some of that be really

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.639 
thing that was some of that be really
cool<00:01:54.299> i'm<00:01:54.570> definitely<00:01:54.990> interested<00:01:55.290> in<00:01:55.500> that

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
cool i'm definitely interested in that

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.160 
cool i'm definitely interested in that
and<00:01:56.090> yeah<00:01:57.090> I<00:01:57.329> don't<00:01:57.420> know<00:01:57.540> this<00:01:57.750> video<00:01:57.960> was
