00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:57.540

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:06.070

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.260
 chop off and see what you've got where 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.470
 you really have to pay attention to is that you 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.300
 so quietly walk through those folders 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.280
 if you do that if you are the right way 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.570

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.620

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.570

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:55.450

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.220
 weather is but that's how we do the hairs 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.540

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.430
 him die immediately unfortunately 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.320

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.320
 so on the ok door we go the 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.290
 wrong boy 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:10.150

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.489

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.049

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:17.290

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:18.970
 okay take that one but a cool folder 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.070
 in my opinion it is a bit too 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.510
 open at some points like me 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:24.040
 for example, could go there now 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.049
 where you are trying to be the enemy 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.570
 I will die anyway 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:30.190
 because it's long and I'm too tall then 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:31.640
 in the over area where everyone 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.910
 of course from trust 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:36.620
 and how lists with 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:40.370
 as an invisibility cloak to fashion 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:43.400
 dick eyes hard guys 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.959

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.090

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:53.470
 make that peeling agent for my boy 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.470
 you get it if that number used 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:59.300
 he put it in his leg 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:01.220
 Concentric kills on the on are one 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:03.739
 but if that I had him 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.670

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:06.110
 rival 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:08.239

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:10.130

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:13.090

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:13.090
