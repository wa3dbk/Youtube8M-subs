00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.650 
if you put too much you won't be able to
close<00:01:59.160> it<00:01:59.400> and<00:01:59.550> I<00:01:59.700> think<00:01:59.940> I've<00:02:00.090> actually<00:02:00.300> put

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:00.660

close it and I think I've actually put
too<00:02:00.810> much<00:02:01.040> but<00:02:02.040> hopefully<00:02:02.460> I'll<00:02:02.580> still<00:02:02.730> be

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
too much but hopefully I'll still be

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:11.120 
too much but hopefully I'll still be
able<00:02:03.150> to<00:02:03.450> wrap<00:02:03.660> the<00:02:03.900> rice<00:02:04.110> around<00:02:04.530> it<00:02:10.070> now<00:02:11.070> the

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
and wrap it around the ceiling so that

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:40.620 
and wrap it around the ceiling so that
you<00:02:34.840> can't<00:02:35.050> see<00:02:35.170> the<00:02:35.440> filling<00:02:39.360> take<00:02:40.360> some

I

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:43.570 

the<00:03:29.270> corner

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:43.580 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:47.479 

now<00:03:44.580> you<00:03:44.640> have<00:03:45.769> triangular<00:03:46.769> rice<00:03:47.159> ball

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489
