00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
horizon you've seen the first couple of

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.030 
horizon you've seen the first couple of
rally<00:00:11.490> stages<00:00:12.030> in<00:00:12.150> there<00:00:12.330> I'll<00:00:12.420> showing<00:00:12.690> the

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
stage of each section and so I thought I

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.120 
stage of each section and so I thought I
tried<00:00:15.990> out<00:00:16.020> with<00:00:16.290> the<00:00:16.350> wheel<00:00:16.530> off<00:00:16.770> her<00:00:16.920> quite<00:00:17.100> a

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
tried out with the wheel off her quite a

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.410 
tried out with the wheel off her quite a
few<00:00:17.340> requests<00:00:17.640> for<00:00:17.790> wheel<00:00:17.940> I<00:00:18.060> haven't<00:00:18.330> played

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
few requests for wheel I haven't played

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:19.970 
few requests for wheel I haven't played
forza<00:00:18.750> horizon<00:00:18.990> with<00:00:19.380> the<00:00:19.410> wheel<00:00:19.620> since<00:00:19.860> I

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
forza horizon with the wheel since I

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.770 
forza horizon with the wheel since I
played<00:00:20.040> the<00:00:20.280> demo<00:00:20.460> and<00:00:20.880> I<00:00:21.270> thought<00:00:21.480> it<00:00:21.630> was

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:21.780 
played the demo and I thought it was

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.140 
played the demo and I thought it was
well<00:00:22.350> I<00:00:22.650> didn't<00:00:23.640> think<00:00:23.700> it<00:00:23.850> very<00:00:24.060> well

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
well I didn't think it very well

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.400 
well I didn't think it very well
implemented<00:00:24.540> let's<00:00:24.930> put<00:00:25.080> it<00:00:25.140> that<00:00:25.170> way<00:00:25.290> I

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
implemented let's put it that way I

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.050 
implemented let's put it that way I
didn't<00:00:25.800> feel<00:00:25.920> any<00:00:26.100> kind<00:00:26.280> of<00:00:26.370> grip<00:00:26.580> but<00:00:26.760> that

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
didn't feel any kind of grip but that

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.580 
didn't feel any kind of grip but that
was<00:00:27.150> kind<00:00:27.270> of<00:00:27.360> hovering<00:00:27.720> on<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:27.960> surface<00:00:28.380> and

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
was kind of hovering on the surface and

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.100 
was kind of hovering on the surface and
here<00:00:29.460> we<00:00:29.550> are<00:00:29.670> with<00:00:29.760> a<00:00:29.850> rally<00:00:30.060> and<00:00:30.360> you<00:00:30.870> can<00:00:30.990> see

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:31.110 
here we are with a rally and you can see

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:33.049 
here we are with a rally and you can see
similar<00:00:31.500> here<00:00:31.710> really<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.309> car<00:00:32.759> isn't

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
similar here really the the car isn't

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.729 
similar here really the the car isn't
going<00:00:33.239> where<00:00:33.390> I<00:00:33.420> wanted<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:33.989> you<00:00:34.290> can<00:00:34.440> see<00:00:34.620> it's

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
going where I wanted to you can see it's

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.160 
going where I wanted to you can see it's
just<00:00:34.770> not<00:00:35.100> reacting<00:00:35.700> it's<00:00:36.360> not<00:00:36.600> reacting

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
just not reacting it's not reacting

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.920 
just not reacting it's not reacting
there's<00:00:37.650> no<00:00:37.770> spontaneous<00:00:38.280> sort<00:00:39.270> of<00:00:39.360> reaction

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
there's no spontaneous sort of reaction

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.510 
there's no spontaneous sort of reaction
to<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.440> car<00:00:40.680> as<00:00:40.890> you're<00:00:41.010> turning<00:00:41.130> the<00:00:41.340> wheel

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
to the car as you're turning the wheel

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.130 
to the car as you're turning the wheel
you<00:00:41.790> don't<00:00:41.970> feel<00:00:42.120> at<00:00:42.210> all<00:00:42.390> connected<00:00:42.750> to<00:00:42.990> the

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
you don't feel at all connected to the

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.560 
you don't feel at all connected to the
action<00:00:43.650> and<00:00:43.860> so<00:00:44.280> I<00:00:44.310> knew<00:00:44.490> a<00:00:44.520> long<00:00:44.730> way<00:00:44.970> before

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
action and so I knew a long way before

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.870 
action and so I knew a long way before
that<00:00:45.780> that's<00:00:46.740> been<00:00:47.250> out<00:00:47.370> happened<00:00:47.730> there<00:00:47.850> that

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:47.880 
that that's been out happened there that

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.640 
that that's been out happened there that
it<00:00:48.060> was<00:00:48.150> coming<00:00:48.540> there's<00:00:49.020> two<00:00:49.170> options<00:00:49.200> you

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:49.650 
it was coming there's two options you

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:51.530 
it was coming there's two options you
have<00:00:49.680> you<00:00:49.950> can<00:00:50.100> lift<00:00:50.250> off<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:50.880> power<00:00:51.300> and

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:51.540 
have you can lift off the power and

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.330 
have you can lift off the power and
regain<00:00:52.230> control<00:00:52.440> of<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.800> car<00:00:53.040> but<00:00:53.220> then

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
regain control of the car but then

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.410 
regain control of the car but then
what's<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.610> point<00:00:53.790> in<00:00:53.970> that<00:00:54.000> you're<00:00:54.329> not

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
what's the point in that you're not

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.670 
what's the point in that you're not
going<00:00:54.570> to<00:00:54.630> be<00:00:54.720> competitive<00:00:55.020> if<00:00:55.350> you<00:00:55.470> need<00:00:55.620> to

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
going to be competitive if you need to

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.229 
going to be competitive if you need to
put<00:00:55.829> your<00:00:55.890> foot<00:00:56.100> down<00:00:56.130> and<00:00:56.640> play<00:00:56.880> like<00:00:57.060> you

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
put your foot down and play like you

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.240 
put your foot down and play like you
were<00:00:57.329> with<00:00:57.510> a<00:00:57.600> pad<00:00:57.840> so<00:00:58.500> I'm<00:00:58.710> trying<00:00:58.920> different

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
were with a pad so I'm trying different

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.010 
were with a pad so I'm trying different
techniques<00:00:59.430> here<00:01:00.060> I'm<00:01:00.239> trying<00:01:00.540> a<00:01:00.720> slow

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
techniques here I'm trying a slow

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.440 
techniques here I'm trying a slow
technique<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:01.890> drive<00:01:02.700> it<00:01:02.880> in<00:01:02.910> some<00:01:03.149> track

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:03.450 
technique to drive it in some track

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:05.749 
technique to drive it in some track
racing<00:01:03.899> way<00:01:04.049> and<00:01:04.320> I<00:01:04.409> occasionally<00:01:04.920> skip<00:01:05.430> to<00:01:05.640> it

00:01:05.749 --> 00:01:05.759 
racing way and I occasionally skip to it

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:07.100 
racing way and I occasionally skip to it
more<00:01:05.909> of<00:01:06.000> a<00:01:06.030> rally<00:01:06.240> technique<00:01:06.689> but<00:01:06.869> I<00:01:06.899> try<00:01:07.079> to

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
more of a rally technique but I try to

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.499 
more of a rally technique but I try to
work<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.560> car<00:01:07.799> but<00:01:08.249> you<00:01:08.369> can<00:01:08.549> see<00:01:08.729> whatever

00:01:09.499 --> 00:01:09.509 
work the car but you can see whatever

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:11.870 
work the car but you can see whatever
input<00:01:09.840> I<00:01:10.109> put<00:01:10.319> into<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.649> wheel<00:01:10.829> the<00:01:11.399> Carson's

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
input I put into the wheel the Carson's

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.120 
input I put into the wheel the Carson's
to<00:01:11.999> take<00:01:12.179> a<00:01:12.210> few<00:01:12.479> seconds<00:01:12.869> to<00:01:12.990> respond<00:01:13.439> it's

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
to take a few seconds to respond it's

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.069 
to take a few seconds to respond it's
just<00:01:14.429> there's<00:01:14.700> just<00:01:14.850> no<00:01:14.969> spontaneity<00:01:15.420> in<00:01:15.840> that

00:01:16.069 --> 00:01:16.079 
just there's just no spontaneity in that

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:19.959 
just there's just no spontaneity in that
in<00:01:16.259> a<00:01:16.319> handling<00:01:16.649> at<00:01:16.799> all<00:01:17.420> so<00:01:18.469> over<00:01:19.469> the<00:01:19.499> jump

00:01:19.959 --> 00:01:19.969 
in a handling at all so over the jump

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:23.149 
in a handling at all so over the jump
look<00:01:20.969> it<00:01:21.090> just<00:01:21.119> wasn't<00:01:21.719> having<00:01:21.840> it<00:01:22.049> it<00:01:22.859> wasn't

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
look it just wasn't having it it wasn't

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.649 
look it just wasn't having it it wasn't
having<00:01:23.369> it<00:01:23.490> and<00:01:23.639> I'd<00:01:23.729> be<00:01:24.240> interested<00:01:24.359> to<00:01:24.569> know

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659

00:01:28.639 --> 00:01:28.649 
that they can play it with the wheel

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:30.679 
that they can play it with the wheel
comfortably<00:01:29.639> but<00:01:29.909> I<00:01:29.969> can<00:01:30.240> see<00:01:30.389> straight<00:01:30.600> away

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
comfortably but I can see straight away

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.279 
comfortably but I can see straight away
that<00:01:31.100> yes<00:01:32.100> you<00:01:32.670> can<00:01:32.850> drive<00:01:33.090> cleanly<00:01:33.569> I<00:01:33.749> don't

00:01:34.279 --> 00:01:34.289 
that yes you can drive cleanly I don't

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:35.719 
that yes you can drive cleanly I don't
necessarily<00:01:34.859> have<00:01:34.979> to<00:01:35.039> have<00:01:35.189> these<00:01:35.429> crashes

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
necessarily have to have these crashes

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.569 
necessarily have to have these crashes
but<00:01:36.659> I<00:01:36.869> won't<00:01:37.259> be<00:01:37.439> competitive<00:01:38.009> so<00:01:38.249> there's<00:01:38.429> no

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
but I won't be competitive so there's no

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.389 
but I won't be competitive so there's no
point<00:01:38.819> you<00:01:39.810> need<00:01:40.380> to<00:01:40.439> be<00:01:40.829> able<00:01:40.950> to<00:01:41.100> get<00:01:41.219> on<00:01:41.310> the

00:01:41.389 --> 00:01:41.399 
point you need to be able to get on the

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:43.370 
point you need to be able to get on the
power<00:01:41.609> same<00:01:42.119> times<00:01:42.389> you<00:01:42.600> will<00:01:42.689> be<00:01:42.840> pad<00:01:43.109> and

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
power same times you will be pad and

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.410 
power same times you will be pad and
take<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.100> same<00:01:44.310> corners<00:01:44.700> flat<00:01:44.909> out<00:01:45.119> that<00:01:45.329> you

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
take the same corners flat out that you

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.209 
take the same corners flat out that you
would<00:01:45.569> as<00:01:45.689> well<00:01:45.719> now<00:01:46.469> this<00:01:46.590> is<00:01:46.649> a<00:01:46.799> similar

00:01:47.209 --> 00:01:47.219 
would as well now this is a similar

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:49.879 
would as well now this is a similar
issue<00:01:47.340> with<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.819> pad<00:01:48.029> anyone<00:01:48.779> using<00:01:49.200> a<00:01:49.259> pad<00:01:49.499> if

00:01:49.879 --> 00:01:49.889 
issue with the pad anyone using a pad if

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:52.699 
issue with the pad anyone using a pad if
you<00:01:50.009> turn<00:01:50.279> in<00:01:50.520> it<00:01:51.060> gets<00:01:51.240> movis<00:01:51.630> t<00:01:51.869> counted<00:01:52.590> out

00:01:52.699 --> 00:01:52.709 
you turn in it gets movis t counted out

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:55.099 
you turn in it gets movis t counted out

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
a tank slapper and loses control but

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.289 
a tank slapper and loses control but
it's<00:01:57.779> exacerbated<00:01:58.229> here<00:01:59.039> by<00:01:59.249> the<00:01:59.310> wheel<00:02:00.090> in

it's exacerbated here by the wheel in

to fund about you can see there again
you<00:02:21.810> know<00:02:21.900> I<00:02:21.930> knew<00:02:22.110> the<00:02:22.200> back<00:02:22.380> end<00:02:22.590> had<00:02:22.710> lost<00:02:22.890> it

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
you know I knew the back end had lost it

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.530 
you know I knew the back end had lost it
it<00:02:23.250> turned<00:02:23.490> in<00:02:23.640> the<00:02:23.700> right<00:02:23.880> into<00:02:24.450> the

it turned in the right into the

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.450 
it turned in the right into the

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
car it just ignores the steering input

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.020 
car it just ignores the steering input
entirely<00:02:29.010> and<00:02:29.130> just<00:02:29.280> continue<00:02:29.640> straight<00:02:29.880> into

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
entirely and just continue straight into

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.100 
entirely and just continue straight into
the<00:02:30.060> wall<00:02:31.010> which<00:02:32.010> is<00:02:32.160> a<00:02:32.190> real<00:02:32.400> shame<00:02:32.430> now<00:02:33.110> you

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
the wall which is a real shame now you

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.380 
the wall which is a real shame now you
know<00:02:34.230> an<00:02:34.380> arcade<00:02:34.770> game<00:02:34.800> yes<00:02:35.550> it<00:02:36.090> should<00:02:36.210> work

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
know an arcade game yes it should work

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:37.760 
know an arcade game yes it should work
well<00:02:36.600> with<00:02:36.750> the<00:02:36.780> wheel<00:02:37.020> you<00:02:37.200> know<00:02:37.320> sega<00:02:37.560> rally

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
well with the wheel you know sega rally

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.860 
well with the wheel you know sega rally
came<00:02:38.130> out<00:02:38.310> in<00:02:38.430> 95<00:02:39.030> and<00:02:39.480> it<00:02:39.600> worked<00:02:39.780> perfectly

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
came out in 95 and it worked perfectly

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.990 
came out in 95 and it worked perfectly
with<00:02:40.410> the<00:02:40.500> rule<00:02:40.680> there's<00:02:41.040> there's<00:02:41.400> no<00:02:41.580> reason

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
with the rule there's there's no reason

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.900 
with the rule there's there's no reason
why<00:02:42.150> today<00:02:42.480> the<00:02:42.720> fanatic<00:02:43.380> official<00:02:43.920> thoughts

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
why today the fanatic official thoughts

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.660 
why today the fanatic official thoughts
a<00:02:45.120> wheel<00:02:45.330> wouldn't<00:02:45.930> work<00:02:46.140> with<00:02:46.860> it<00:02:46.980> so<00:02:47.190> I<00:02:47.400> think

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
a wheel wouldn't work with it so I think

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.180 
a wheel wouldn't work with it so I think
themself<00:02:48.030> well<00:02:48.120> let's<00:02:48.270> have<00:02:48.420> a<00:02:48.450> restart<00:02:49.190> let's

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
themself well let's have a restart let's

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.730 
themself well let's have a restart let's
just<00:02:50.340> see<00:02:50.430> now<00:02:50.640> we've<00:02:50.790> learnt<00:02:51.090> some<00:02:51.870> some

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:52.740 
just see now we've learnt some some

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:56.510 
just see now we've learnt some some
issues<00:02:53.100> why<00:02:53.400> don't<00:02:53.580> we<00:02:53.670> try<00:02:53.940> and<00:02:55.160> work<00:02:56.160> on<00:02:56.340> some

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
issues why don't we try and work on some

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:57.560 
issues why don't we try and work on some
of<00:02:56.610> those<00:02:56.700> why<00:02:56.940> don't<00:02:57.090> we<00:02:57.150> try<00:02:57.240> a<00:02:57.300> different

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
of those why don't we try a different

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.010 
of those why don't we try a different
style<00:02:57.930> of<00:02:58.080> driving<00:02:58.350> here<00:02:58.800> so<00:02:58.980> now<00:02:59.100> I<00:02:59.160> try<00:02:59.460> to

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:00.020 
style of driving here so now I try to

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:02.870 
style of driving here so now I try to
try<00:03:01.020> bit<00:03:01.200> smoother<00:03:01.800> and<00:03:02.010> then<00:03:02.580> you'll<00:03:02.700> see<00:03:02.850> a

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
try bit smoother and then you'll see a

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.340 
try bit smoother and then you'll see a
bit<00:03:03.030> more<00:03:03.060> aggressive<00:03:03.240> driving<00:03:03.780> coming<00:03:04.110> as

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
bit more aggressive driving coming as

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:05.750 
bit more aggressive driving coming as
well<00:03:04.380> as<00:03:04.650> I<00:03:04.710> think<00:03:04.920> right<00:03:05.100> okay<00:03:05.490> because

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
well as I think right okay because

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.790 
well as I think right okay because
there's<00:03:05.910> yes<00:03:06.630> we<00:03:06.810> can<00:03:06.960> do<00:03:07.050> it<00:03:07.140> smoothly<00:03:07.380> and<00:03:07.710> we

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
there's yes we can do it smoothly and we

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.229 
there's yes we can do it smoothly and we
won't<00:03:07.950> crash<00:03:08.280> but<00:03:09.560> at<00:03:10.560> the<00:03:10.710> same<00:03:10.890> time<00:03:11.130> we<00:03:11.910> want

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
won't crash but at the same time we want

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:13.880 
won't crash but at the same time we want
to<00:03:12.360> win<00:03:12.480> races<00:03:12.660> we<00:03:13.140> want<00:03:13.290> to<00:03:13.350> hit<00:03:13.440> leaderboard

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
to win races we want to hit leaderboard

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:18.949 
to win races we want to hit leaderboard
so<00:03:14.070> it's<00:03:14.370> all<00:03:14.430> about<00:03:14.459> so<00:03:15.380> slow<00:03:16.380> down<00:03:17.840> had<00:03:18.840> to

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
so it's all about so slow down had to

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:20.690 
so it's all about so slow down had to
come<00:03:19.080> out<00:03:19.110> the<00:03:19.290> power<00:03:19.470> so<00:03:19.950> much<00:03:19.980> slower<00:03:20.580> than

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
come out the power so much slower than

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.340 
come out the power so much slower than
the<00:03:20.820> room<00:03:21.090> with<00:03:21.450> a<00:03:21.480> bit<00:03:21.660> of<00:03:21.690> the<00:03:21.780> pad<00:03:21.989> so<00:03:22.290> it

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
the room with a bit of the pad so it

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:23.900 
the room with a bit of the pad so it
just<00:03:22.530> shows<00:03:22.680> you<00:03:22.800> that<00:03:22.830> you<00:03:23.070> can't<00:03:23.250> do<00:03:23.430> it<00:03:23.550> but

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
just shows you that you can't do it but

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.030 
just shows you that you can't do it but
you're<00:03:24.060> just<00:03:24.239> going<00:03:24.360> to<00:03:24.450> be<00:03:24.540> slower<00:03:24.750> I<00:03:25.050> think

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
you're just going to be slower I think

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.979 
you're just going to be slower I think
right<00:03:26.250> on<00:03:26.580> the<00:03:26.760> power<00:03:26.970> and<00:03:27.150> it<00:03:27.270> costs<00:03:27.480> skipping

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
right on the power and it costs skipping

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:29.660 
right on the power and it costs skipping
along<00:03:28.080> the<00:03:28.290> surface<00:03:28.530> I<00:03:28.950> don't<00:03:29.130> really<00:03:29.250> get<00:03:29.459> any

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
along the surface I don't really get any

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:32.449 
along the surface I don't really get any
feedback<00:03:29.820> as<00:03:30.270> such<00:03:30.450> turning<00:03:31.290> in<00:03:31.410> trying<00:03:32.310> to<00:03:32.370> be

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
feedback as such turning in trying to be

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.040 
feedback as such turning in trying to be
more<00:03:32.580> aggressive<00:03:32.760> for<00:03:33.150> their<00:03:33.239> maybe<00:03:33.450> just<00:03:33.870> cut

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.050 
more aggressive for their maybe just cut

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:39.979 
more aggressive for their maybe just cut
the<00:03:34.200> grass<00:03:38.180> you<00:03:39.180> always<00:03:39.360> a<00:03:39.390> passenger<00:03:39.959> on

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
the grass you always a passenger on

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:41.630 
the grass you always a passenger on
those<00:03:40.260> jump<00:03:40.560> so<00:03:40.770> it<00:03:40.830> has<00:03:40.920> to<00:03:40.950> be<00:03:41.130> said<00:03:41.310> if<00:03:41.520> you

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
those jump so it has to be said if you

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.790 
those jump so it has to be said if you
come<00:03:41.850> down<00:03:41.880> badly<00:03:42.570> off<00:03:42.780> the<00:03:42.900> jump<00:03:43.140> likelihood

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:43.800 
come down badly off the jump likelihood

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.070 
come down badly off the jump likelihood
is<00:03:44.040> you're<00:03:44.160> going<00:03:44.310> to<00:03:44.370> spin<00:03:44.580> out<00:03:44.730> and<00:03:45.080> again

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 
is you're going to spin out and again

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.920 
is you're going to spin out and again
they're<00:03:46.550> like<00:03:47.550> answered<00:03:48.030> the<00:03:48.150> slide<00:03:48.420> and<00:03:48.450> yet

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
they're like answered the slide and yet

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.810 
they're like answered the slide and yet
it<00:03:49.020> just<00:03:49.200> wouldn't<00:03:49.530> it<00:03:50.040> wouldn't<00:03:50.220> counter<00:03:50.700> it

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
it just wouldn't it wouldn't counter it

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:54.259 
it just wouldn't it wouldn't counter it
at<00:03:50.910> all<00:03:51.120> so<00:03:51.830> it's<00:03:52.830> every<00:03:53.670> time<00:03:53.910> you<00:03:54.060> try<00:03:54.180> to

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
at all so it's every time you try to

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:57.440 
at all so it's every time you try to
push<00:03:54.540> a<00:03:54.570> bit<00:03:54.840> more<00:03:55.370> just<00:03:56.370> lift<00:03:56.640> every<00:03:57.150> time<00:03:57.330> you

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
push a bit more just lift every time you

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.300 
push a bit more just lift every time you
start<00:03:57.630> to<00:03:57.780> lose<00:03:57.959> the<00:03:58.140> car<00:03:58.350> lift<00:03:58.650> rather<00:03:59.130> than

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
start to lose the car lift rather than

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.830 
start to lose the car lift rather than
counter<00:03:59.670> steer<00:04:02.209> now<00:04:03.209> obviously<00:04:03.300> you<00:04:03.630> know

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
counter steer now obviously you know

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.030 
counter steer now obviously you know
when<00:04:03.989> you're<00:04:04.110> driving<00:04:04.290> a<00:04:04.470> car<00:04:04.650> like<00:04:04.709> this<00:04:04.830> it's

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
when you're driving a car like this it's

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.890 
when you're driving a car like this it's
all<00:04:05.130> throttle<00:04:05.580> control<00:04:05.970> that's<00:04:06.209> that's

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
all throttle control that's that's

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.240 
all throttle control that's that's
controlling<00:04:07.290> your<00:04:07.500> steering<00:04:07.800> angle<00:04:08.130> and

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
controlling your steering angle and

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:09.770 
controlling your steering angle and
everything<00:04:08.519> else<00:04:08.700> and<00:04:08.940> you're<00:04:09.150> controlling<00:04:09.570> a

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
everything else and you're controlling a

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.780 
everything else and you're controlling a
steer<00:04:10.019> the<00:04:10.170> car<00:04:10.350> the<00:04:10.530> throttle<00:04:10.890> but<00:04:11.070> on<00:04:11.459> here

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
steer the car the throttle but on here

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.790 
steer the car the throttle but on here
you're<00:04:11.970> just<00:04:12.150> not<00:04:12.300> able<00:04:12.420> easy<00:04:13.110> situated

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:13.800 
you're just not able easy situated

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.140 
you're just not able easy situated
because<00:04:14.010> the<00:04:14.280> steering<00:04:14.670> input<00:04:14.970> is<00:04:15.150> so

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
because the steering input is so

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.390 
because the steering input is so
delayed<00:04:16.959> and<00:04:17.500> so<00:04:17.650> sometimes<00:04:17.949> just

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 
delayed and so sometimes just

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.640 
delayed and so sometimes just
non-existent<00:04:19.150> because<00:04:19.750> just<00:04:20.199> not<00:04:20.380> going

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650 
non-existent because just not going

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:22.530 
non-existent because just not going
where<00:04:21.009> I'm<00:04:21.130> steering<00:04:21.430> like<00:04:22.090> there<00:04:22.300> i<00:04:22.330> was

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:22.540 
where I'm steering like there i was

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.200 
where I'm steering like there i was
doing<00:04:22.810> for<00:04:23.139> ages<00:04:23.500> to<00:04:24.100> the<00:04:24.190> right<00:04:24.400> and<00:04:24.639> then

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
doing for ages to the right and then

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.600 
doing for ages to the right and then
when<00:04:25.389> I<00:04:25.419> stay<00:04:25.630> to<00:04:25.690> the<00:04:25.870> left<00:04:26.020> I<00:04:26.490> wouldn't<00:04:27.490> go

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
when I stay to the left I wouldn't go

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.240 
when I stay to the left I wouldn't go
left<00:04:27.850> so<00:04:28.419> an<00:04:28.810> interesting<00:04:29.380> one<00:04:29.530> I've<00:04:29.979> been

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
left so an interesting one I've been

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.790 
left so an interesting one I've been
personally<00:04:30.729> I've<00:04:30.850> enjoyed<00:04:31.180> the<00:04:31.840> rally<00:04:32.050> pack<00:04:32.350> I

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800 
personally I've enjoyed the rally pack I

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.310 
personally I've enjoyed the rally pack I
find<00:04:33.699> it<00:04:33.789> really<00:04:33.910> good<00:04:34.120> fun<00:04:34.300> with<00:04:34.509> the<00:04:34.570> pad<00:04:34.780> and

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 
find it really good fun with the pad and

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:36.600 
find it really good fun with the pad and
it<00:04:35.410> for<00:04:35.560> what<00:04:35.680> it<00:04:35.770> is<00:04:35.800> it's<00:04:36.160> throwing<00:04:36.430> away

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.610 
it for what it is it's throwing away

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.400 
it for what it is it's throwing away
gaming<00:04:37.060> it's<00:04:37.180> great<00:04:37.419> fun<00:04:37.690> it's<00:04:37.960> intense

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:38.410 
gaming it's great fun it's intense

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:40.800 
gaming it's great fun it's intense
everything<00:04:38.979> else<00:04:39.190> it's<00:04:39.669> but<00:04:39.970> it's<00:04:40.000> very<00:04:40.240> basic

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
everything else it's but it's very basic

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.200 
everything else it's but it's very basic
at<00:04:41.020> the<00:04:41.110> same<00:04:41.320> time<00:04:41.560> it<00:04:41.830> is<00:04:41.949> just<00:04:42.250> dlc<00:04:42.820> wouldn't

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
at the same time it is just dlc wouldn't

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:44.700 
at the same time it is just dlc wouldn't
have<00:04:43.300> survived<00:04:43.630> as<00:04:43.780> a<00:04:43.810> game<00:04:44.050> on<00:04:44.199> its<00:04:44.320> own<00:04:44.470> right

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
have survived as a game on its own right

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:46.770 
have survived as a game on its own right
because<00:04:45.580> there's<00:04:45.880> not<00:04:45.970> enough<00:04:46.030> depth<00:04:46.449> to<00:04:46.720> it

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:46.780 
because there's not enough depth to it

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:48.420 
because there's not enough depth to it
there's<00:04:47.050> not<00:04:47.139> enough<00:04:47.410> to<00:04:47.590> learn<00:04:47.889> there's<00:04:48.310> not

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:48.430 
there's not enough to learn there's not

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:49.320 
there's not enough to learn there's not
enough<00:04:48.580> to<00:04:48.699> come<00:04:48.880> back<00:04:49.060> and<00:04:49.210> keep

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:49.330 
enough to come back and keep

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.540 
enough to come back and keep
experiencing<00:04:49.990> you<00:04:50.620> just<00:04:50.830> what<00:04:51.039> you<00:04:51.250> just<00:04:51.370> need

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 
experiencing you just what you just need

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:53.550 
experiencing you just what you just need
to<00:04:51.639> know<00:04:51.760> which<00:04:51.910> corners<00:04:52.449> to<00:04:52.600> cut<00:04:52.810> which<00:04:53.260> walls

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:53.560 
to know which corners to cut which walls

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.800 
to know which corners to cut which walls
you've<00:04:53.830> gotta<00:04:54.010> bounce<00:04:54.250> off<00:04:54.520> to<00:04:55.090> and<00:04:55.630> where

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:55.810 
you've gotta bounce off to and where

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:57.810 
you've gotta bounce off to and where
where<00:04:56.139> you<00:04:56.260> can<00:04:56.440> scrub<00:04:56.680> or<00:04:56.830> speed<00:04:57.160> instead<00:04:57.490> of

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:57.820 
where you can scrub or speed instead of

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:00.390 
where you can scrub or speed instead of
using<00:04:58.030> the<00:04:58.270> brakes<00:04:58.510> basically<00:04:59.370> where<00:05:00.370> the

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:00.400 
using the brakes basically where the

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.400 
using the brakes basically where the
wheels<00:05:00.610> concerned<00:05:01.120> it's<00:05:01.810> not<00:05:02.110> been<00:05:02.260> well

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:02.410 
wheels concerned it's not been well

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:03.930 
wheels concerned it's not been well
implemented<00:05:02.830> a<00:05:03.100> tour<00:05:03.310> to<00:05:03.580> complete

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:03.940 
implemented a tour to complete

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:06.270 
implemented a tour to complete
afterthought<00:05:04.510> and<00:05:05.500> i<00:05:05.590> think<00:05:05.650> that's<00:05:05.949> a<00:05:06.070> shame

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:06.280 
afterthought and i think that's a shame

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:08.040 
afterthought and i think that's a shame
on<00:05:06.550> the<00:05:06.610> game<00:05:06.789> like<00:05:07.000> this<00:05:07.150> they<00:05:07.750> could<00:05:07.930> have

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.050 
on the game like this they could have

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:10.469 
on the game like this they could have
done<00:05:08.229> so<00:05:08.500> much<00:05:08.680> more<00:05:08.740> with<00:05:09.160> it<00:05:09.220> but<00:05:09.970> at<00:05:10.300> the<00:05:10.389> end

00:05:10.469 --> 00:05:10.479 
done so much more with it but at the end

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:12.390 
done so much more with it but at the end

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:17.830 
experience of the wheel here is

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:19.740 
experience of the wheel here is
unrealistic<00:05:18.610> to<00:05:18.970> what<00:05:19.060> some<00:05:19.210> of<00:05:19.240> you<00:05:19.419> guys<00:05:19.570> are

unrealistic to what some of you guys are

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:20.969 
unrealistic to what some of you guys are
experiencing<00:05:20.380> and<00:05:20.560> you've<00:05:20.650> got<00:05:20.800> perfect

handling<00:05:21.639> certainly<00:05:22.599> for<00:05:22.750> me<00:05:22.870> though<00:05:23.050> that

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:23.740 
handling certainly for me though that

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:26.330 
handling certainly for me though that
was<00:05:24.240> something<00:05:25.240> like<00:05:25.419> this<00:05:25.479> should<00:05:25.660> handle

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:26.340 
was something like this should handle

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:28.860 
was something like this should handle
well<00:05:27.340> and<00:05:27.639> there's<00:05:27.940> nothing<00:05:28.060> i'm<00:05:28.330> going<00:05:28.599> to<00:05:28.660> be

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:28.870 
well and there's nothing i'm going to be

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:31.830 
well and there's nothing i'm going to be
able<00:05:28.990> to<00:05:29.139> do<00:05:29.289> my<00:05:29.500> wheel<00:05:29.710> in<00:05:29.860> terms<00:05:30.099> of<00:05:30.840> settings

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:31.840 
able to do my wheel in terms of settings

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:34.830 
able to do my wheel in terms of settings
it's<00:05:32.110> going<00:05:32.260> to<00:05:32.320> cure<00:05:32.620> you<00:05:33.490> know<00:05:33.840> fundamental

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:34.840 
it's going to cure you know fundamental

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:36.450 
it's going to cure you know fundamental
problem<00:05:35.229> with<00:05:35.260> the<00:05:35.470> actual<00:05:35.590> handling<00:05:36.099> itself

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:36.460 
problem with the actual handling itself

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:38.730 
problem with the actual handling itself
so<00:05:37.270> it's<00:05:37.750> interesting<00:05:37.870> but<00:05:38.320> obviously<00:05:38.590> has

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:38.740 
so it's interesting but obviously has

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:42.360 
so it's interesting but obviously has
ever<00:05:38.919> i<00:05:39.010> tested<00:05:39.490> out<00:05:39.580> lots<00:05:39.849> and<00:05:40.659> try<00:05:41.139> and<00:05:41.370> find

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:42.370 
ever i tested out lots and try and find

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:44.909 
ever i tested out lots and try and find
the<00:05:42.490> cause<00:05:42.729> of<00:05:42.760> the<00:05:42.970> problem<00:05:43.360> and<00:05:43.650> always<00:05:44.650> try

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:44.919 
the cause of the problem and always try

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:47.430 
the cause of the problem and always try
and<00:05:45.479> maximize<00:05:46.479> it<00:05:46.659> to<00:05:46.780> see<00:05:46.900> if<00:05:47.020> i'm<00:05:47.169> going

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:47.440 
and maximize it to see if i'm going

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:48.750 
and maximize it to see if i'm going
wrong<00:05:47.650> somewhere<00:05:48.010> so<00:05:48.190> i<00:05:48.250> try<00:05:48.430> different

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:48.760 
wrong somewhere so i try different

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:50.850 
wrong somewhere so i try different
techniques<00:05:49.150> but<00:05:49.419> as<00:05:49.539> you<00:05:49.630> can<00:05:49.750> see<00:05:49.960> here<00:05:50.229> no

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:50.860 
techniques but as you can see here no

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:52.529 
techniques but as you can see here no
there's<00:05:51.159> just<00:05:51.310> no<00:05:51.520> more<00:05:51.699> speed<00:05:52.030> and<00:05:52.210> that

00:05:52.529 --> 00:05:52.539 
there's just no more speed and that

00:05:52.539 --> 00:05:55.200 
there's just no more speed and that
viewers<00:05:53.349> is<00:05:53.560> that<00:05:54.190> on<00:05:54.490> the<00:05:54.699> wheel<00:05:54.849> we<00:05:55.000> fought

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:55.210 
viewers is that on the wheel we fought

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:57.330 
viewers is that on the wheel we fought
so<00:05:55.389> horizon<00:05:55.870> but<00:05:56.229> as<00:05:56.380> ever<00:05:56.590> the<00:05:57.010> view<00:05:57.159> more

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:57.340 
so horizon but as ever the view more

00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:59.189 
so horizon but as ever the view more
videos<00:05:57.370> with<00:05:57.789> a<00:05:57.880> pad<00:05:58.060> coming<00:05:58.360> in<00:05:58.630> the<00:05:58.900> coming
