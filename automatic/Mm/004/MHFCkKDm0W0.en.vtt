00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
what we saw from duel terminal sets

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.260 
what we saw from duel terminal sets
evidently<00:01:20.100> and<00:01:20.400> I<00:01:20.790> think<00:01:20.970> I<00:01:21.030> know<00:01:21.090> what<00:01:21.180> the

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
evidently and I think I know what the

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.820 
evidently and I think I know what the
time<00:01:21.420> out<00:01:21.570> on<00:01:21.659> that<00:01:21.810> like<00:01:22.049> it<00:01:22.290> it<00:01:22.560> looks

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
time out on that like it it looks

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.499 
time out on that like it it looks
actually<00:01:23.220> pretty<00:01:23.460> cool<00:01:23.790> I<00:01:24.060> remember<00:01:24.450> from

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
actually pretty cool I remember from

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:25.730 
actually pretty cool I remember from
duel<00:01:24.720> terminal<00:01:24.869> so<00:01:25.110> I'm<00:01:25.170> hoping<00:01:25.439> that<00:01:25.500> will

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
duel terminal so I'm hoping that will

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.440 
duel terminal so I'm hoping that will
pretty<00:01:26.009> much<00:01:26.130> be<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.400> same<00:01:26.520> exactly<00:01:27.299> from

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
pretty much be the same exactly from

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:28.399 
pretty much be the same exactly from
that<00:01:27.570> hope<00:01:27.659> they<00:01:27.780> don't<00:01:27.930> change<00:01:28.080> it<00:01:28.200> up<00:01:28.290> really

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
that hope they don't change it up really

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.980 
that hope they don't change it up really
too<00:01:28.619> much<00:01:29.360> but<00:01:30.360> yeah<00:01:30.450> that<00:01:30.630> sounds<00:01:30.840> like<00:01:30.869> a

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
too much but yeah that sounds like a

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.929 
too much but yeah that sounds like a
cool<00:01:31.170> idea<00:01:31.619> for<00:01:32.100> a<00:01:32.250> new<00:01:32.369> rarity<00:01:32.670> I<00:01:32.700> always

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
cool idea for a new rarity I always

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:33.980
