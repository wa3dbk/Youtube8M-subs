parts on the top and what I want to show

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.890 
parts on the top and what I want to show
is<00:00:20.609> some<00:00:20.760> of<00:00:20.850> these<00:00:20.939> components<00:00:21.150> you<00:00:21.600> can't

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
is some of these components you can't

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.890 
is some of these components you can't
easily<00:00:22.109> see<00:00:22.650> when<00:00:23.550> the<00:00:23.850> inlet<00:00:24.330> manifold<00:00:24.750> in

you<00:00:33.989> can<00:00:34.110> see<00:00:34.260> we've<00:00:34.410> got<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:34.590> Cosworth

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:35.239 
you can see we've got the Cosworth

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:37.910 
you can see we've got the Cosworth
tumble<00:00:36.239> generator<00:00:36.690> belt<00:00:36.960> delete<00:00:37.350> risers

which<00:00:38.129> are<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.489> replacement<00:00:39.030> component<00:00:39.540> of

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
which are the replacement component of

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.630 
which are the replacement component of
the<00:00:39.750> original<00:00:40.170> STI<00:00:40.559> Inlet<00:00:40.980> manifold<00:00:41.430> and

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
the original STI Inlet manifold and

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.020 
the original STI Inlet manifold and
these<00:00:42.450> components<00:00:43.079> are<00:00:43.230> a<00:00:43.820> effectively<00:00:44.820> made

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
these components are a effectively made

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.810 
these components are a effectively made
from<00:00:45.270> plastic<00:00:45.690> but<00:00:46.469> they<00:00:46.860> flow<00:00:47.340> more<00:00:47.550> air

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
from plastic but they flow more air

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.760 
from plastic but they flow more air
they've<00:00:48.329> got<00:00:48.600> less<00:00:48.809> restriction<00:00:49.379> in<00:00:49.530> the

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
they've got less restriction in the

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.350 
they've got less restriction in the
original<00:00:50.160> factory<00:00:50.309> parts<00:00:50.789> and<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.000> good<00:00:51.149> part

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
original factory parts and the good part

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.490 
original factory parts and the good part
is<00:00:51.680> they<00:00:52.680> reduce<00:00:53.550> heat<00:00:54.300> soak<00:00:54.570> between<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.230> hot

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
is they reduce heat soak between the hot

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.549 
is they reduce heat soak between the hot
Headz<00:00:55.739> and<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.730> inlet<00:00:57.270> side<00:00:57.510> of<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.780> inlet

itself<00:01:03.809> of<00:01:04.170> course<00:01:04.379> you've<00:01:04.500> got<00:01:04.650> one<00:01:04.799> on

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
itself of course you've got one on

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.490 
itself of course you've got one on
either<00:01:05.100> side<00:01:05.489> on<00:01:06.270> this<00:01:06.750> side<00:01:06.990> though<00:01:07.170> this<00:01:07.320> is

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
either side on this side though this is

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.990 
either side on this side though this is
where<00:01:07.650> all<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:07.830> complicated<00:01:08.280> part<00:01:08.850> is

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
where all the complicated part is

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.399 
where all the complicated part is
because<00:01:09.330> it's<00:01:09.479> a<00:01:09.540> very<00:01:09.720> tight<00:01:09.960> fit<00:01:10.170> between

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
because it's a very tight fit between

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.000 
because it's a very tight fit between
the<00:01:10.830> modified<00:01:11.369> turbo<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.840> TGV<00:01:13.590> deletes

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
the modified turbo and the TGV deletes

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.590 
the modified turbo and the TGV deletes
but<00:01:14.490> what<00:01:14.610> I<00:01:14.640> want<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:14.909> show<00:01:15.090> you<00:01:15.150> here<00:01:15.420> was

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
but what I want to show you here was

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.910 
but what I want to show you here was
just<00:01:15.780> how<00:01:15.930> important<00:01:16.350> it<00:01:16.439> is<00:01:16.500> to<00:01:16.560> get<00:01:16.799> this

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
just how important it is to get this

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.679 
just how important it is to get this
component<00:01:17.520> here<00:01:17.610> fitted<00:01:17.970> prep<00:01:18.210> correctly

of<00:01:39.540> that<00:01:39.659> soon<00:01:39.930> but<00:01:40.650> what<00:01:41.250> I<00:01:41.280> was<00:01:41.430> talking

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
of that soon but what I was talking

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.670 
of that soon but what I was talking
about<00:01:41.729> was<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.509> riser<00:01:42.780> pipe<00:01:43.110> that<00:01:43.320> goes<00:01:43.350> up

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
about was the riser pipe that goes up

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.210 
about was the riser pipe that goes up
here<00:01:44.030> into<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.210> up<00:01:46.200> pipe<00:01:46.530> which<00:01:46.799> goes<00:01:47.009> up

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
here into the up pipe which goes up

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.340 
here into the up pipe which goes up
