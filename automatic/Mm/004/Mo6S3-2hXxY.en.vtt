00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
driver updating utility why would you

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.129 
driver updating utility why would you
need<00:00:07.830> new<00:00:08.130> drivers<00:00:08.550> it<00:00:09.360> all<00:00:09.510> depends<00:00:09.900> on<00:00:09.960> what

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
need new drivers it all depends on what

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:11.180 
need new drivers it all depends on what
you're<00:00:10.290> doing<00:00:10.320> if<00:00:10.590> you're<00:00:10.710> a<00:00:10.769> gamer<00:00:11.070> you

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190

it's<00:00:41.520> very<00:00:41.640> very<00:00:41.940> fast<00:00:42.510> I'm<00:00:42.870> sure<00:00:43.020> if<00:00:43.140> I<00:00:43.260> had

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:43.430 
it's very very fast I'm sure if I had

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.490 
it's very very fast I'm sure if I had
