gallons the hippo water roller was
designed<00:00:33.090> by<00:00:33.270> to<00:00:33.780> South<00:00:34.050> African<00:00:34.410> engineers<00:00:34.980> I

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
designed by to South African engineers I

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.280 
designed by to South African engineers I
started<00:00:36.000> designing<00:00:36.120> a<00:00:36.510> wheelbarrow<00:00:36.930> that<00:00:37.170> had

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
started designing a wheelbarrow that had

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.560 
started designing a wheelbarrow that had
a<00:00:37.320> low<00:00:37.559> center<00:00:37.860> of<00:00:38.010> gravity<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:39.059> wheel<00:00:39.300> was

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
a low center of gravity the wheel was

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.869 
a low center of gravity the wheel was
the<00:00:39.660> most<00:00:39.870> expensive<00:00:40.230> component<00:00:40.550> that's<00:00:41.550> when

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
the most expensive component that's when

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.030 
the most expensive component that's when
the<00:00:42.149> idea<00:00:42.180> was<00:00:42.660> born<00:00:43.020> let's<00:00:43.590> put<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:43.890> water

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
the idea was born let's put the water

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:50.720 
the idea was born let's put the water
inside<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.550> wheel<00:00:48.590> then<00:00:49.590> I<00:00:49.620> supposed<00:00:50.250> to<00:00:50.340> with

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
inside the wheel then I supposed to with

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.540 
inside the wheel then I supposed to with
this<00:00:51.090> water<00:00:51.390> I<00:00:51.719> fish<00:00:52.170> from<00:00:52.440> there<00:00:52.710> I<00:00:52.920> supposed

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
this water I fish from there I supposed

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.910 
this water I fish from there I supposed
to<00:00:53.670> a<00:00:53.699> share<00:00:54.059> and<00:00:54.239> I<00:00:54.930> supposed<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:55.410> cook<00:00:55.710> I

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
to a share and I supposed to cook I

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.189 
to a share and I supposed to cook I
supposed<00:00:56.309> to<00:00:56.370> think<00:00:56.460> therefore<00:00:56.850> then<00:00:57.449> this<00:00:57.690> 20

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199
