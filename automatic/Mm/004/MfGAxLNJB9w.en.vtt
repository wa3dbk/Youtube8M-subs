00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.460 
the machine as my guide for where about
the<00:02:38.940> dolls<00:02:39.180> ears<00:02:39.630> would<00:02:39.959> be<00:02:40.140> in<00:02:40.500> her<00:02:40.980> eye<00:02:42.470> sight

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
the dolls ears would be in her eye sight

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.910 
the dolls ears would be in her eye sight
line<00:02:43.769> so<00:02:44.579> that<00:02:45.000> it<00:02:45.150> the<00:02:45.780> face<00:02:45.989> will<00:02:46.230> be<00:02:46.380> fairly

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
line so that it the face will be fairly

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.600 
line so that it the face will be fairly
symmetrical<00:02:47.730> and<00:02:47.910> lined<00:02:48.150> up<00:02:48.590> then<00:02:49.590> you<00:02:50.400> take

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
symmetrical and lined up then you take

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.440 
symmetrical and lined up then you take
the<00:02:50.760> other<00:02:50.790> part<00:02:51.720> of<00:02:51.959> your<00:02:52.230> hoop<00:02:52.890> and<00:02:53.130> you<00:02:54.120> just

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
the other part of your hoop and you just

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:00.170 
the other part of your hoop and you just
want<00:02:54.959> to<00:02:55.079> press<00:02:55.620> it<00:02:55.650> down<00:02:58.400> now<00:02:59.400> on<00:02:59.730> your<00:02:59.940> hoop

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
want to press it down now on your hoop

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.710 
want to press it down now on your hoop
there's<00:03:01.109> a<00:03:01.319> little<00:03:01.920> device<00:03:02.850> that<00:03:02.880> you<00:03:03.420> tighten

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
there's a little device that you tighten

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.920 
there's a little device that you tighten
the<00:03:04.470> hoop<00:03:04.680> and<00:03:05.010> it<00:03:05.670> does<00:03:05.910> have<00:03:06.150> to<00:03:06.269> be<00:03:06.299> as<00:03:06.600> tight

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
the hoop and it does have to be as tight

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.250 
the hoop and it does have to be as tight
as<00:03:07.260> you<00:03:07.319> can<00:03:07.950> get<00:03:08.880> it<00:03:09.090> because<00:03:09.840> if<00:03:09.959> you<00:03:10.109> don't

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
as you can get it because if you don't

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.340 
as you can get it because if you don't
tighten<00:03:10.769> this<00:03:11.269> when<00:03:12.269> your<00:03:12.450> machine<00:03:12.600> starts

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
tighten this when your machine starts

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:15.800 
tighten this when your machine starts
embroidering<00:03:13.950> it's<00:03:14.370> it<00:03:14.880> can<00:03:15.060> come<00:03:15.239> apart<00:03:15.329> it

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
embroidering it's it can come apart it

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.270 
embroidering it's it can come apart it
can<00:03:15.840> jam<00:03:16.170> up<00:03:16.410> I'm<00:03:16.590> sure<00:03:16.739> a<00:03:16.769> lot<00:03:16.980> of<00:03:17.069> bad<00:03:17.250> things

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280

can happen they're just going to slow

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.729 
can happen they're just going to slow

actually let me say I'm going to pin it

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.960 
actually let me say I'm going to pin it
back<00:04:16.100> because<00:04:17.100> you<00:04:17.190> want<00:04:17.340> to<00:04:17.400> keep<00:04:17.580> this<00:04:17.760> out

what<00:04:20.460> it<00:04:20.580> has<00:04:20.730> to<00:04:20.910> do<00:04:21.050> okay<00:04:22.050> so<00:04:22.260> now<00:04:22.560> we<00:04:22.620> will

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
what it has to do okay so now we will

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.650 
what it has to do okay so now we will
take<00:04:22.980> this<00:04:23.130> over<00:04:23.340> to<00:04:23.430> the<00:04:23.550> border<00:04:24.000> machine<00:04:24.360> and

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
take this over to the border machine and

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:27.770 
take this over to the border machine and
start<00:04:25.290> on<00:04:25.410> the<00:04:25.440> next<00:04:25.530> step
