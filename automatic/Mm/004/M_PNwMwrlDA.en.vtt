going to be talking to you about the
different<00:00:19.949> types<00:00:19.980> of<00:00:20.369> brain<00:00:20.609> injury<00:00:21.029> and<00:00:21.210> some

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
different types of brain injury and some

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.710 
different types of brain injury and some
of<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.109> causes<00:00:22.560> of<00:00:22.590> brain<00:00:22.920> injury<00:00:23.720> brain

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
of the causes of brain injury brain

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.779 
of the causes of brain injury brain
injury<00:00:24.990> can<00:00:25.350> occur<00:00:25.500> even<00:00:25.980> if<00:00:26.279> there<00:00:26.430> is<00:00:26.550> no

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
injury can occur even if there is no

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.220 
injury can occur even if there is no
loss<00:00:27.060> of<00:00:27.269> consciousness<00:00:27.480> and<00:00:28.050> that's

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
loss of consciousness and that's

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.220 
loss of consciousness and that's
something<00:00:28.529> really<00:00:28.980> important<00:00:29.460> to<00:00:29.519> remember

contrecoup<00:02:08.849> and<00:02:09.629> these<00:02:10.410> make<00:02:11.009> up<00:02:11.039> moderate

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
contrecoup and these make up moderate

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.970 
contrecoup and these make up moderate
and<00:02:12.180> severe<00:02:12.690> brain<00:02:13.379> injuries

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
and severe brain injuries

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.699 
and severe brain injuries
and<00:02:14.069> when<00:02:14.640> coup<00:02:14.909> contrecoup<00:02:15.349> occurs<00:02:16.349> and<00:02:16.650> you

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
and when coup contrecoup occurs and you

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:18.410 
and when coup contrecoup occurs and you
might<00:02:16.890> hear<00:02:17.159> this<00:02:17.340> expression<00:02:18.120> from<00:02:18.239> your

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
might hear this expression from your

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.780 
might hear this expression from your
doctor<00:02:18.810> it's<00:02:19.290> really<00:02:19.799> when<00:02:19.980> the<00:02:20.190> brain<00:02:20.489> is

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
doctor it's really when the brain is

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.960 
doctor it's really when the brain is
rocked<00:02:21.540> back<00:02:22.170> and<00:02:22.230> forth<00:02:22.530> and<00:02:23.069> that<00:02:23.129> rocking

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
rocked back and forth and that rocking

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.199 
rocked back and forth and that rocking
in<00:02:24.239> the<00:02:24.269> brain<00:02:25.069> causes<00:02:26.069> damage<00:02:26.610> as<00:02:26.819> it<00:02:26.970> rocks

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
in the brain causes damage as it rocks

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.479 
in the brain causes damage as it rocks
back<00:02:27.390> and<00:02:27.569> forth<00:02:27.810> so<00:02:28.769> if<00:02:28.920> you<00:02:29.069> think<00:02:29.310> about

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
back and forth so if you think about

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:32.750 
back and forth so if you think about
going<00:02:30.060> on<00:02:30.209> one<00:02:30.720> of<00:02:30.750> the<00:02:30.930> rides<00:02:31.170> at<00:02:31.560> a<00:02:31.620> fair<00:02:32.459> or

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
going on one of the rides at a fair or

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.180 
going on one of the rides at a fair or
at<00:02:33.450> Six<00:02:33.750> Flags<00:02:33.959> and<00:02:34.440> you<00:02:34.560> think<00:02:34.799> about<00:02:35.010> the

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
at Six Flags and you think about the

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.250 
at Six Flags and you think about the
times<00:02:35.879> that<00:02:36.090> you're<00:02:36.390> thrown<00:02:36.720> back<00:02:36.989> and<00:02:37.170> forth

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
times that you're thrown back and forth

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.640 
times that you're thrown back and forth
like<00:02:37.620> that<00:02:37.860> if<00:02:38.190> it's<00:02:38.700> severely<00:02:39.420> you<00:02:39.840> could

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
like that if it's severely you could

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.399 
like that if it's severely you could
have<00:02:40.860> some<00:02:41.280> damage<00:02:41.790> to<00:02:41.970> your<00:02:42.090> brain<00:02:42.409> another

00:02:43.399 --> 00:02:43.409 
have some damage to your brain another

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:45.759 
have some damage to your brain another
term<00:02:43.799> that<00:02:43.829> physicians<00:02:44.489> use<00:02:44.579> is<00:02:45.000> diffuse

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:45.769 
term that physicians use is diffuse

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:49.150 
term that physicians use is diffuse
axonal<00:02:46.769> brain<00:02:47.519> injury<00:02:47.910> and<00:02:48.120> this

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
axonal brain injury and this

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.619 
axonal brain injury and this
unfortunately<00:02:50.160> is<00:02:50.370> a<00:02:50.400> devastating<00:02:50.849> cause<00:02:51.360> of

00:02:51.619 --> 00:02:51.629 
unfortunately is a devastating cause of

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:53.030 
unfortunately is a devastating cause of
brain<00:02:51.840> injury<00:02:52.140> because<00:02:52.230> it<00:02:52.500> means<00:02:52.680> that<00:02:52.829> the

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
brain injury because it means that the

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:55.079 
brain the brain injury is occurring

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:57.920 
brain the brain injury is occurring
across<00:02:55.650> all<00:02:56.129> aspects<00:02:56.819> of<00:02:56.970> the<00:02:57.090> brain<00:02:57.269> not<00:02:57.599> just

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
across all aspects of the brain not just

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.770 
across all aspects of the brain not just
in<00:02:58.049> one<00:02:58.260> focal<00:02:58.769> point<00:02:59.040> this<00:02:59.970> really<00:03:00.420> is<00:03:00.599> the

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
in one focal point this really is the

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.559 
in one focal point this really is the
most<00:03:00.810> common<00:03:01.680> cause<00:03:01.980> of<00:03:02.370> severe<00:03:03.030> and<00:03:03.239> moderate

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
most common cause of severe and moderate

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:05.509 
most common cause of severe and moderate
brain<00:03:03.840> injury<00:03:04.170> but<00:03:04.620> it<00:03:04.680> is<00:03:04.920> also<00:03:05.099> the<00:03:05.250> most

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
brain injury but it is also the most

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:07.599 
brain injury but it is also the most
devastating<00:03:06.239> because<00:03:06.359> the<00:03:06.690> whole<00:03:06.900> brain<00:03:07.290> is

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:07.609 
devastating because the whole brain is

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:10.849 
devastating because the whole brain is
involved<00:03:08.690> another<00:03:09.690> cause<00:03:10.049> of<00:03:10.079> brain<00:03:10.560> injury

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:13.670 
involved another cause of brain injury
occurs<00:03:11.250> right<00:03:11.970> at<00:03:12.209> the<00:03:12.420> at<00:03:12.690> the<00:03:13.019> neuron<00:03:13.440> level

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
occurs right at the at the neuron level

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.259 
occurs right at the at the neuron level
and<00:03:13.980> if<00:03:14.069> you<00:03:14.160> think<00:03:14.400> about<00:03:14.519> these<00:03:14.879> little

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
and if you think about these little

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:19.940 
and if you think about these little
neurons<00:03:16.700> they<00:03:17.700> begin<00:03:18.209> to<00:03:18.510> as<00:03:18.720> the<00:03:19.109> shaking<00:03:19.680> or

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
neurons they begin to as the shaking or

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.280 
neurons they begin to as the shaking or
as<00:03:20.130> the<00:03:20.549> impact<00:03:21.150> of<00:03:21.359> whatever<00:03:21.540> happens<00:03:22.109> to

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
as the impact of whatever happens to

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.009 
as the impact of whatever happens to
your<00:03:22.380> brain<00:03:22.590> they<00:03:23.400> begin<00:03:23.790> to<00:03:23.940> split<00:03:24.209> apart<00:03:24.480> and

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
your brain they begin to split apart and

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:26.990 
your brain they begin to split apart and
they<00:03:25.290> get<00:03:25.620> diffused<00:03:26.010> all<00:03:26.280> over<00:03:26.579> your<00:03:26.760> brain

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
they get diffused all over your brain

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.059 
they get diffused all over your brain
and<00:03:27.239> again<00:03:28.109> this<00:03:28.349> is<00:03:28.530> a<00:03:28.560> very<00:03:28.829> devastating

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:29.069 
and again this is a very devastating

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:32.030 
and again this is a very devastating
cause<00:03:29.760> of<00:03:30.090> brain<00:03:30.329> injury<00:03:30.799> severe<00:03:31.799> brain
