00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.380
 but like 5 kilometers 

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:10.380
 56 laps 306 kilometers in total 

00:00:11.149 --> 00:00:12.819
 six rapid sections 

00:00:12.819 --> 00:00:16.059
 five slow curves three are ideal for lifting 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:19.059
 maximum speed 210 kilometers per hour 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:24.130
 here the return to the grand prize of china in the formula one simulator of network 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.130
 bull 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.180
 quick entry into the so-called snail curve a right curve 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.180
 incredibly the work that is becoming more and more narrow 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:40.030
 it closes suddenly at the end followed by a very accused bull to the left a 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:41.570
 good place for a heads-up 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.800
 then you rush down a long humala left is that it is 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.380
 incredibly fast and he knows a lot 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.440
 and you have to open many brizuela another power refers 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.360
 we accelerated strong by the rise 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.780
 we braked hard going down in a sharp curve right very important 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.980
 get out correctly 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.890
 then we go to a very fast sequence of curves 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:05.870
 a long lefts that is incredibly fast to a curve of 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.710
 right again quite long with a large margin also the middle of that 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:10.570
 turn 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.540
 then a double left curve very complicated in which the car goes well 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.860
 balanced and respond consistently so you think it's important 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.860
 go through them in the cleanest way possible 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.150
 then a short straight to a very sharp fork closed 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.340
 left 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.900
 we accelerate a bit along the slope 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.470
 you have to place the car in the correct position for this long exit that the 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.470
 will carry important and extensive back straight of shanghai 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.370
 a few fantastic weeks at the end of this straight 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.930
 Normally, it is a fight. It is advancing by hurrying the egg whites to be here 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.580
 we have strong 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.090
 We started a turn slowly calmly making sure we get also 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.960
 that a smooth and good output 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.490
 we accelerated briefly out of the we arrived at this fifth gear and then 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.080
 offend for last turn 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.980
 It is important that this Cuba goes well 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:05.010
 little above the curb to the exit we accelerate decisively until the 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.890
 goal line and that's how it has been a great return
