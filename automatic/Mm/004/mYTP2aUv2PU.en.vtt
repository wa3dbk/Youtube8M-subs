meter<00:00:42.879> pump<00:00:43.239> in<00:00:43.390> it<00:00:43.540> so<00:00:43.809> it<00:00:43.989> doesn't<00:00:44.320> have<00:00:44.470> to

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:44.620 
meter pump in it so it doesn't have to

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.380 
meter pump in it so it doesn't have to
work<00:00:44.650> very<00:00:44.830> hard<00:00:45.190> to<00:00:45.610> get<00:00:45.729> where<00:00:45.909> it's<00:00:46.089> going

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:46.390 
work very hard to get where it's going

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.229

this eliminates a lot of punctures that

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.380 
this eliminates a lot of punctures that
may<00:01:23.289> happen<00:01:23.560> when<00:01:23.890> you<00:01:24.039> have<00:01:24.219> bones<00:01:24.549> or<00:01:25.060> sharp

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390 
may happen when you have bones or sharp

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.639 
may happen when you have bones or sharp
objects<00:01:25.899> inside<00:01:26.289> the<00:01:26.530> bag<00:01:28.200> well<00:01:29.200> let's<00:01:29.439> give

00:01:29.639 --> 00:01:29.649 
objects inside the bag well let's give

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:31.469 
objects inside the bag well let's give
it<00:01:29.770> a<00:01:29.859> try<00:01:30.070> and<00:01:30.130> see<00:01:30.460> exactly<00:01:31.000> what<00:01:31.270> this<00:01:31.420> thing

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:31.479 
it a try and see exactly what this thing

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:36.029 
it a try and see exactly what this thing
can<00:01:31.869> do<00:01:34.049> it<00:01:35.049> does<00:01:35.320> have<00:01:35.530> 10<00:01:35.799> different

00:01:36.029 --> 00:01:36.039 
can do it does have 10 different

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:38.310 
can do it does have 10 different
programmable<00:01:36.880> settings<00:01:37.270> on<00:01:37.570> the<00:01:37.719> dial<00:01:37.960> you

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 
programmable settings on the dial you

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.999 
programmable settings on the dial you
can<00:01:38.649> vary<00:01:39.399> so<00:01:40.179> if<00:01:40.359> you<00:01:40.479> set<00:01:40.840> the<00:01:40.990> programs<00:01:41.590> you

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:42.009 
can vary so if you set the programs you

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:45.529 
can vary so if you set the programs you
can<00:01:42.189> run<00:01:43.060> them<00:01:43.329> up<00:01:43.770> so<00:01:44.770> you<00:01:44.859> can<00:01:45.159> set<00:01:45.490> different

00:01:45.529 --> 00:01:45.539 
can run them up so you can set different

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:48.419 
can run them up so you can set different
programs<00:01:46.539> on<00:01:46.810> the<00:01:47.020> machine<00:01:47.350> for<00:01:47.920> different

back in slowly for six seconds and then

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:39.040 
back in slowly for six seconds and then
it<00:02:37.370> will<00:02:37.580> let<00:02:37.850> the<00:02:38.030> rest<00:02:38.240> of<00:02:38.390> the<00:02:38.480> air<00:02:38.630> back<00:02:38.870> in

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 
it will let the rest of the air back in

it will let the rest of the air back in
the<00:02:39.170> chamber<00:02:39.380> quickly<00:02:39.920> what<00:02:40.160> this<00:02:40.340> does<00:02:40.610> is

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
the chamber quickly what this does is

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.330 
the chamber quickly what this does is
allow<00:02:41.600> the<00:02:41.630> bag<00:02:41.990> to<00:02:42.260> lay<00:02:42.560> on<00:02:42.800> the<00:02:42.950> top<00:02:43.130> of<00:02:43.310> your

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
allow the bag to lay on the top of your

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.430 
allow the bag to lay on the top of your
product<00:02:43.880> instead<00:02:44.270> of<00:02:44.330> getting<00:02:44.720> slapped<00:02:45.140> up

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
product instead of getting slapped up

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.830 
product instead of getting slapped up
against<00:02:45.830> it<00:02:45.980> which<00:02:46.160> may<00:02:46.370> deform<00:02:47.090> some<00:02:47.600> of<00:02:47.720> your

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
against it which may deform some of your

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.080 
against it which may deform some of your
softer<00:02:48.320> more<00:02:48.560> delicate<00:02:49.010> pieces<00:02:49.190> of<00:02:49.520> meats<00:02:49.850> or

softer more delicate pieces of meats or
fish<00:02:51.220> vegetables<00:02:52.220> and<00:02:52.550> things<00:02:52.640> like<00:02:52.850> that<00:02:53.680> to

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
fish vegetables and things like that to

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.530 
fish vegetables and things like that to
start<00:02:54.890> this<00:02:55.100> machine<00:02:55.520> all<00:02:55.790> you<00:02:55.910> have<00:02:56.090> to<00:02:56.240> do<00:02:56.390> is

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
start this machine all you have to do is

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.660 
start this machine all you have to do is
push<00:02:56.750> the<00:02:56.900> lid<00:02:57.080> down

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.110 

and<00:03:01.410> just<00:03:02.410> let<00:03:02.650> the<00:03:02.830> 10-meter<00:03:03.160> pump<00:03:03.520> take<00:03:03.760> over

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
and just let the 10-meter pump take over

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.800 
and just let the 10-meter pump take over
these<00:03:04.870> machines<00:03:05.410> do<00:03:05.680> also<00:03:05.890> run<00:03:06.850> on<00:03:07.180> a<00:03:07.209> pressure

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
these machines do also run on a pressure

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.520 
these machines do also run on a pressure
cycle<00:03:08.590> so<00:03:08.950> the<00:03:09.310> pressure<00:03:09.610> was<00:03:09.940> set<00:03:10.240> at<00:03:10.530> 99.9

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
cycle so the pressure was set at 99.9

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.910 
cycle so the pressure was set at 99.9
percent<00:03:12.100> which<00:03:13.060> means<00:03:13.420> that<00:03:14.110> it's<00:03:14.440> going<00:03:14.740> to

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
percent which means that it's going to

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.800 
percent which means that it's going to
suck<00:03:15.130> out<00:03:15.600> 99.9%<00:03:16.600> of<00:03:17.260> the<00:03:17.350> air<00:03:17.470> and<00:03:18.510> as<00:03:19.510> soon<00:03:19.720> as

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
suck out 99.9% of the air and as soon as

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.440 
suck out 99.9% of the air and as soon as
it<00:03:19.990> gets<00:03:20.110> up<00:03:20.380> there<00:03:20.650> we'll<00:03:21.209> watch<00:03:22.209> the

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
it gets up there we'll watch the

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.100 
it gets up there we'll watch the
heat-seal<00:03:22.870> var<00:03:23.140> take<00:03:23.410> over<00:03:23.740> and<00:03:24.690> the<00:03:25.690> heat<00:03:25.870> co

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.110 
heat-seal var take over and the heat co

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.180 
heat-seal var take over and the heat co
will<00:03:26.380> run<00:03:26.650> when<00:03:26.920> it<00:03:27.070> gets<00:03:27.250> to<00:03:27.400> 99

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
will run when it gets to 99

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:33.400 
will run when it gets to 99
I<00:03:29.410> should<00:03:30.410> be<00:03:30.530> right<00:03:30.710> about<00:03:30.950> now<00:03:31.160> and<00:03:32.410> the

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
I should be right about now and the

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:36.130 
I should be right about now and the
heat-seal<00:03:33.800> runs<00:03:34.100> for<00:03:34.430> two<00:03:34.610> seconds<00:03:35.120> and<00:03:35.330> this

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.140 
heat-seal runs for two seconds and this

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.530 
heat-seal runs for two seconds and this

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
is that soft air feature it's going to

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.050 
is that soft air feature it's going to
let<00:03:38.660> the<00:03:38.840> air<00:03:39.020> softly<00:03:39.770> into<00:03:40.100> the<00:03:40.340> machine<00:03:40.730> and

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
let the air softly into the machine and

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:46.540 
let the air softly into the machine and
then<00:03:41.950> once<00:03:42.950> the<00:03:44.140> timer<00:03:45.140> runs<00:03:45.530> out<00:03:45.740> it<00:03:46.040> lets<00:03:46.250> all

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:46.550 
then once the timer runs out it lets all

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:48.040 
then once the timer runs out it lets all
