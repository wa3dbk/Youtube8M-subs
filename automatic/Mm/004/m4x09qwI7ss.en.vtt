00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 
on the part I hope that makes sense and

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:32.349 
on the part I hope that makes sense and
so<00:03:28.640> this<00:03:29.560> this<00:03:30.560> is<00:03:30.769> also<00:03:31.250> really<00:03:31.549> not<00:03:31.940> neat<00:03:32.239> at

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:32.359 
so this this is also really not neat at

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:36.789 
so this this is also really not neat at
all<00:03:32.980> but<00:03:33.980> see<00:03:34.909> how<00:03:35.030> much<00:03:35.299> faster<00:03:35.599> I'm<00:03:35.930> going<00:03:36.260> it

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:36.799 
all but see how much faster I'm going it

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:50.630 
all but see how much faster I'm going it
is<00:03:37.609> so<00:03:37.879> much<00:03:38.090> faster

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.430 

and<00:03:51.640> it's<00:03:51.970> also<00:03:52.180> really<00:03:52.570> good<00:03:52.840> if<00:03:53.050> you<00:03:53.230> have

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440

getting<00:04:13.540> to<00:04:13.870> a<00:04:13.900> part<00:04:14.290> of<00:04:14.350> my<00:04:14.530> hair<00:04:14.770> that's

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
getting to a part of my hair that's

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:20.400 
getting to a part of my hair that's
shorter<00:04:16.030> in<00:04:16.870> the<00:04:16.930> rest<00:04:17.230> of<00:04:17.380> them<00:04:18.660> so<00:04:19.660> this<00:04:20.049> is<00:04:20.350> a

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:20.410 
shorter in the rest of them so this is a

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:24.480 
shorter in the rest of them so this is a
very<00:04:21.070> good<00:04:21.250> technique<00:04:22.080> for<00:04:23.080> that<00:04:23.340> for<00:04:24.340> those
