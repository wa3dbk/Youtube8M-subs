coming<00:00:46.500> up<00:00:46.680> up<00:00:46.860> here<00:00:47.100> and<00:00:47.370> let's<00:00:47.730> not<00:00:47.940> for

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
coming up up here and let's not for

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.540 
coming up up here and let's not for
later<00:00:48.360> on<00:00:48.539> but<00:00:48.780> pretty<00:00:49.680> much<00:00:49.739> what<00:00:50.309> we<00:00:50.340> did

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
later on but pretty much what we did

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.540 
later on but pretty much what we did
this<00:00:50.700> game<00:00:50.969> is<00:00:51.239> we<00:00:51.629> pushed<00:00:51.870> up<00:00:52.140> far<00:00:52.980> enough<00:00:53.010> to

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
this game is we pushed up far enough to

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.330 
this game is we pushed up far enough to
pretty<00:00:54.000> much<00:00:54.149> almost<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.660> their<00:00:54.780> spawn

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:55.340 
pretty much almost to their spawn

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.240 
pretty much almost to their spawn
whether<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.610> attackers<00:00:57.239> are<00:00:57.859> spawning<00:00:58.859> in<00:00:59.070> at

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
whether the attackers are spawning in at

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.810 
whether the attackers are spawning in at
parachuting<00:01:00.000> down<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.510> stuff<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:01.699> there<00:01:02.699> was

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
parachuting down and stuff and there was

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.119 
parachuting down and stuff and there was
quite<00:01:03.539> a<00:01:03.600> few<00:01:03.660> snipers<00:01:04.229> on<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.470> other<00:01:04.589> team<00:01:04.890> so

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
quite a few snipers on the other team so

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.429 
quite a few snipers on the other team so
that's<00:01:05.309> always<00:01:05.750> kind<00:01:06.750> of<00:01:06.900> annoying<00:01:07.170> you'll

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
that's always kind of annoying you'll

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.219 
that's always kind of annoying you'll
see<00:01:07.650> they'll<00:01:07.830> be<00:01:08.030> camping<00:01:09.030> up<00:01:09.150> way<00:01:09.360> way<00:01:09.780> up<00:01:09.810> on

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
see they'll be camping up way way up on

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.210 
see they'll be camping up way way up on
top<00:01:10.260> of<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.680> mountain<00:01:11.070> and<00:01:12.830> gets<00:01:13.830> shot<00:01:14.040> in<00:01:14.159> the

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
top of the mountain and gets shot in the

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.950 
top of the mountain and gets shot in the
back<00:01:14.400> right<00:01:14.610> there<00:01:14.790> actually<00:01:15.270> think<00:01:15.600> i<00:01:15.720> was

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
back right there actually think i was

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.810 
back right there actually think i was
looking<00:01:16.229> at<00:01:16.320> didn't<00:01:16.590> kill<00:01:16.770> me<00:01:16.920> but<00:01:17.130> yeah

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
looking at didn't kill me but yeah

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.539 
looking at didn't kill me but yeah
pretty<00:01:18.060> much<00:01:18.150> they<00:01:18.509> I<00:01:18.780> don't<00:01:19.170> know<00:01:19.259> we<00:01:19.549> had

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
pretty much they I don't know we had

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.179 
pretty much they I don't know we had
them<00:01:20.990> we<00:01:21.990> had<00:01:22.140> a<00:01:22.170> pretty<00:01:22.350> good<00:01:22.590> defense<00:01:22.740> right

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
them we had a pretty good defense right

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.770 
them we had a pretty good defense right
here<00:01:23.369> so<00:01:23.549> they<00:01:23.670> couldn't<00:01:23.880> really<00:01:24.090> push<00:01:24.330> up<00:01:24.570> and

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
here so they couldn't really push up and

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.240 
here so they couldn't really push up and
pretty<00:01:24.990> much<00:01:25.080> if<00:01:25.350> you're<00:01:25.470> attacking<00:01:25.950> on<00:01:26.070> this

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
pretty much if you're attacking on this

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.800 
pretty much if you're attacking on this
map<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.610> key<00:01:26.759> to<00:01:26.909> this<00:01:27.030> first<00:01:27.270> base<00:01:27.540> is

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
map the key to this first base is

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.810 
map the key to this first base is
pushing<00:01:28.350> up<00:01:28.500> right<00:01:28.799> away<00:01:28.950> with<00:01:29.400> your<00:01:29.549> whole

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
pushing up right away with your whole

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.410 
pushing up right away with your whole
team<00:01:30.090> and<00:01:30.680> you<00:01:31.680> know<00:01:31.799> if<00:01:31.950> you<00:01:32.100> kind<00:01:32.700> of<00:01:32.850> fail<00:01:33.090> at

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
team and you know if you kind of fail at

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.390 
team and you know if you kind of fail at
pushing<00:01:34.049> up<00:01:34.290> in<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.500> beginning<00:01:34.920> it<00:01:35.159> kind<00:01:35.369> of

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
pushing up in the beginning it kind of

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.819 
pushing up in the beginning it kind of
makes<00:01:35.549> it<00:01:35.640> a<00:01:35.759> little<00:01:35.909> hard<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:37.020> push<00:01:37.530> up<00:01:37.740> and

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
makes it a little hard to push up and

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.429 
makes it a little hard to push up and
arm<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.540> objectives<00:01:39.540> and<00:01:39.750> especially<00:01:40.079> when

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
arm the objectives and especially when

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.010 
arm the objectives and especially when
you<00:01:40.560> got<00:01:41.119> like<00:01:42.119> pretty<00:01:42.360> much<00:01:42.450> like<00:01:42.720> in<00:01:42.869> this

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
you got like pretty much like in this

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.630 
you got like pretty much like in this
game<00:01:43.229> our<00:01:43.380> whole<00:01:43.560> team<00:01:43.740> is<00:01:43.950> pushed<00:01:44.189> up<00:01:44.399> they're

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
game our whole team is pushed up they're
