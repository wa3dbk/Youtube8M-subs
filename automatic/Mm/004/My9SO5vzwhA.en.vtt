00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609
 most open television chain that 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.849
 never look at a very low temperature 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.050
 and I'm going to add low when we're not 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.450
 when we are cooking at a 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:16.139
 low temperature I'm not frying I'm 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:18.210
 aware of what we need to cook 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:22.980
 garlic 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:25.320
 the oregano and chile guajillo in h and as 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.269
 I was saying it I have a big complaint 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.880
 for the delegation of the families of 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:33.500
 that I live in the setting 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.170
 in adjustment gardens of who is your 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.910
 house for when the owner is small and 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.860
 to get to the peripheral I have to 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.220
 take the road picacho I want them 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:45.590
 say that today we made an hour 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:48.500
 one hour nothing more than three traffic lights 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:52.730
 before six flags to the peripheral and knows 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:56.059
 what happened what happened nothing there was nothing 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:58.519
 so what happens that I 'm from 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:01.190
 agreement that there are people who do not have 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:03.559
 work that uses the ambulantaje as a 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.390
 I think it's good to work 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:07.820
 that occupy apart from exceeding the 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.950
 stool that occupy a lane is 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.130
 incredible because suddenly we have three 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.509
 lanes of cars and suddenly we were 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.100
 I do not know why the people who are 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:20.780
 selling their products outside of a 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:22.729
 building that obstruct and navas in two 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.220
 lanes and to this day it was crazy 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:26.509
 madness the descent to which I do not know if it has 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.329
 to do with the delegate any of the 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:31.640
 sector but please in the mornings is 

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:32.690
 really need someone to transit 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.490
 that he directed 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:39.650
 although here you have these people there 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:41.210
 or do something the truth but good you 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.010

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.870
 they made that courage they came late 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:47.150

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:49.400
 of not getting here and well that's all 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.650

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:54.650

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:57.640

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.569
