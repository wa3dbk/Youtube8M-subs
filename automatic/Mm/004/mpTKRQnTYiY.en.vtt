00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.730 
of course if we look down here we can
see<00:01:38.430> with<00:01:38.700> these<00:01:38.880> drilled<00:01:39.600> speaker<00:01:40.200> holes<00:01:40.470> and

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
see with these drilled speaker holes and

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.069 
see with these drilled speaker holes and
an<00:01:41.310> interesting<00:01:41.729> addition<00:01:41.880> is<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.509> USB

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
an interesting addition is the USB

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.319 
an interesting addition is the USB
type-c<00:01:43.470> connector<00:01:44.280> here<00:01:44.460> now<00:01:44.850> that<00:01:45.060> is<00:01:45.180> the

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
type-c connector here now that is the

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.060 
type-c connector here now that is the
new<00:01:45.630> version<00:01:45.990> of<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.170> USB<00:01:46.409> connector<00:01:46.829> which

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
new version of the USB connector which

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.859 
new version of the USB connector which
means<00:01:47.340> you<00:01:47.670> can<00:01:47.820> plug<00:01:48.000> it<00:01:48.119> in<00:01:48.240> either<00:01:48.450> way

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
means you can plug it in either way

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.630 
means you can plug it in either way
round<00:01:49.170> so<00:01:49.710> no<00:01:49.920> more<00:01:50.130> of<00:01:50.280> that<00:01:50.310> awkward

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
round so no more of that awkward

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.030 
round so no more of that awkward
swapping<00:01:51.299> when<00:01:51.450> you<00:01:51.540> go<00:01:51.659> to<00:01:51.720> bed<00:01:51.990> it's<00:01:52.799> fairly

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
swapping when you go to bed it's fairly

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.920 
swapping when you go to bed it's fairly
lightweight<00:01:53.310> and<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:54.000> metal<00:01:54.360> design<00:01:54.600> does

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
lightweight and the metal design does

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.719 
lightweight and the metal design does
make<00:01:55.110> it<00:01:55.259> feel<00:01:55.409> like<00:01:55.439> a<00:01:55.590> very<00:01:55.799> premium<00:01:56.310> device
