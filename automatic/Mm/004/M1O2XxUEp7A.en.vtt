00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
let's take a look at what the forecast

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.610 
let's take a look at what the forecast
is<00:00:42.899> going<00:00:43.050> to<00:00:43.230> be<00:00:43.320> like<00:00:45.200> ok<00:00:46.200> so<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.440> pressure

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
is going to be like ok so the pressure

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.350 
is going to be like ok so the pressure
chart<00:00:46.920> for<00:00:47.100> Friday<00:00:47.340> then<00:00:47.550> shows<00:00:47.820> low<00:00:48.059> pressure

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
chart for Friday then shows low pressure

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.450 
chart for Friday then shows low pressure
off<00:00:48.690> northern<00:00:49.320> Scotland<00:00:49.890> high<00:00:50.160> pressure

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
off northern Scotland high pressure

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.490 
off northern Scotland high pressure
across<00:00:51.059> Northern<00:00:51.600> Europe<00:00:51.629> and<00:00:52.050> we've<00:00:52.379> got

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
across Northern Europe and we've got

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.049 
across Northern Europe and we've got
that<00:00:52.649> front<00:00:52.980> that<00:00:53.100> cold<00:00:53.399> front<00:00:53.550> line<00:00:53.820> through

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
that front that cold front line through

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.389 
that front that cold front line through
Scotland<00:00:54.420> had<00:00:54.809> also<00:00:55.050> Ireland<00:00:55.500> -<00:00:55.680> I<00:00:55.890> think

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
Scotland had also Ireland - I think

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:57.560 
Scotland had also Ireland - I think
along<00:00:56.579> that<00:00:56.789> front<00:00:57.059> we're<00:00:57.210> going<00:00:57.239> to<00:00:57.390> find

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
along that front we're going to find

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.750 
along that front we're going to find
basis<00:00:57.960> of<00:00:58.050> about<00:00:58.260> a<00:00:58.289> thousand<00:00:58.829> feet<00:00:58.859> top<00:00:59.430> sonic

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
basis of about a thousand feet top sonic

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.209 
basis of about a thousand feet top sonic
and<00:01:00.000> about<00:01:00.329> 10,000<00:01:01.020> feet<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:01.379> that<00:01:01.800> breaks<00:01:02.070> of

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
and about 10,000 feet and that breaks of

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.340 
and about 10,000 feet and that breaks of
rain<00:01:02.460> -<00:01:02.789> so<00:01:03.059> moderate<00:01:03.480> or<00:01:03.629> pull<00:01:03.870> visibility

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
rain - so moderate or pull visibility

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.740 
rain - so moderate or pull visibility
right<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.830> way<00:01:04.949> along<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.309> front<00:01:05.750> also

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
right the way along the front also

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.420 
right the way along the front also
through<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.290> Irish<00:01:07.590> Sea<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:07.979> I<00:01:08.040> think<00:01:08.250> coming

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
through the Irish Sea and I think coming

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.250 
through the Irish Sea and I think coming
up<00:01:08.610> through<00:01:08.760> parts<00:01:08.820> of<00:01:09.150> Cornwall<00:01:09.689> -<00:01:09.960> off<00:01:10.110> the

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
up through parts of Cornwall - off the

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.020 
up through parts of Cornwall - off the
southwest<00:01:10.680> approaches<00:01:11.189> we<00:01:11.549> could<00:01:11.700> have<00:01:11.850> low

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
southwest approaches we could have low

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.050 
southwest approaches we could have low
cloud<00:01:12.330> -<00:01:12.689> I<00:01:12.900> think<00:01:13.290> they're<00:01:13.520> probably<00:01:14.520> bases

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
cloud - I think they're probably bases

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.320 
cloud - I think they're probably bases

6000 feet and good visibility

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:23.159
