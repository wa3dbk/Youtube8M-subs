about a generation ago and gives me the

about a generation ago and gives me the
shudders<00:00:06.750> to<00:00:07.020> think<00:00:07.439> that<00:00:08.189> it<00:00:08.280> was<00:00:08.400> a

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:08.430 
shudders to think that it was a

these funny lights in the sky that were

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.950 
these funny lights in the sky that were
everywhere<00:00:24.000> in<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.300> 1960s<00:00:26.630> there<00:00:27.630> was<00:00:27.750> one

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
everywhere in the 1960s there was one

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.500 
everywhere in the 1960s there was one
hilltop<00:00:28.440> in<00:00:28.650> particular<00:00:29.250> that<00:00:30.060> overlooked

sky

00:00:41.999 --> 00:00:45.160 
sky
and<00:00:42.620> circle<00:00:43.620> around<00:00:43.739> these<00:00:44.100> boats<00:00:44.429> that<00:00:44.760> were

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.170 
and circle around these boats that were

the<00:00:48.899> boat<00:00:49.079> men<00:00:49.350> would<00:00:49.589> turn<00:00:49.829> on<00:00:49.949> the

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:50.069 
the boat men would turn on the

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:52.369 
the boat men would turn on the
searchlights<00:00:50.339> and<00:00:50.940> play<00:00:51.569> games<00:00:51.899> with<00:00:52.289> these

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
searchlights and play games with these

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.799 
searchlights and play games with these
lights<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:53.640> lights<00:00:53.909> would<00:00:54.120> jump<00:00:54.420> out<00:00:54.569> of<00:00:54.600> the

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
lights the lights would jump out of the

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.469 
lights the lights would jump out of the
way<00:00:54.960> of<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.260> searchlights<00:00:56.089> and<00:00:57.089> I<00:00:57.300> was

00:00:57.469 --> 00:00:57.479 
way of the searchlights and I was

00:00:57.479 --> 00:00:59.209 
way of the searchlights and I was
sitting<00:00:57.659> on<00:00:57.870> my<00:00:57.989> hilltop<00:00:58.199> watching<00:00:58.890> them<00:00:59.039> that

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
sitting on my hilltop watching them that

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.939 
sitting on my hilltop watching them that
these<00:00:59.399> games<00:00:59.699> Daria<00:01:00.269> but<00:01:01.109> I<00:01:01.139> would<00:01:01.379> flash<00:01:01.679> this

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
these games Daria but I would flash this

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.219 
these games Daria but I would flash this
flashlight<00:01:02.309> at<00:01:02.850> these<00:01:03.030> funny<00:01:03.300> lights<00:01:03.600> and

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
flashlight at these funny lights and

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.420 
flashlight at these funny lights and
they<00:01:04.350> would<00:01:04.500> jump<00:01:04.680> out<00:01:04.800> of<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:05.070> way<00:01:05.190> of<00:01:05.309> my

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
they would jump out of the way of my

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.330 
they would jump out of the way of my
flashlight<00:01:06.259> and<00:01:07.259> so<00:01:07.439> I<00:01:07.469> had<00:01:07.560> flash<00:01:07.860> in<00:01:08.130> Morse

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
flashlight and so I had flash in Morse

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.160 
flashlight and so I had flash in Morse
code<00:01:08.640> at<00:01:09.030> these<00:01:09.210> lights<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:09.780> they<00:01:09.869> would<00:01:10.020> do

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
code at these lights and they would do

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.219 
code at these lights and they would do
whatever<00:01:10.439> I<00:01:10.619> ordered<00:01:11.040> them<00:01:11.159> to<00:01:11.219> do<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:12.390> then

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
whatever I ordered them to do and then

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.490 
whatever I ordered them to do and then
later<00:01:13.500> I<00:01:14.270> decided<00:01:15.270> that<00:01:15.420> instead<00:01:15.750> using<00:01:16.259> Morse

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
later I decided that instead using Morse

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.800 
later I decided that instead using Morse
code<00:01:16.799> I'd<00:01:17.009> make<00:01:17.250> up<00:01:17.280> my<00:01:17.579> own<00:01:17.759> code<00:01:18.060> and<00:01:18.329> they

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
code I'd make up my own code and they

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.240 
code I'd make up my own code and they
knew<00:01:19.200> this<00:01:19.409> code<00:01:20.600> which<00:01:21.600> gave<00:01:21.869> me<00:01:21.899> a<00:01:22.439> lot<00:01:22.950> of

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
knew this code which gave me a lot of

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.410 
knew this code which gave me a lot of
concern<00:01:24.259> and<00:01:25.280> I<00:01:26.280> gradually<00:01:26.789> figured<00:01:27.299> out

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
concern and I gradually figured out

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.319 
concern and I gradually figured out
during<00:01:27.750> this<00:01:27.869> period<00:01:28.170> that<00:01:28.700> we<00:01:29.700> could<00:01:29.939> control

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
during this period that we could control

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:31.999 
during this period that we could control
these<00:01:30.689> so-called<00:01:30.869> flying<00:01:31.320> saucers<00:01:31.859> they

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
these so-called flying saucers they

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.609 
these so-called flying saucers they
weren't<00:01:32.189> sausage<00:01:32.640> they<00:01:32.789> were<00:01:32.850> lace<00:01:33.180> and<00:01:33.689> I<00:01:34.469> was

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
weren't sausage they were lace and I was

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.709 
weren't sausage they were lace and I was
sitting<00:01:34.770> alone<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:35.460> one<00:01:36.180> of<00:01:36.329> these<00:01:36.420> lights

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:36.719 
sitting alone and one of these lights

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:38.840 
sitting alone and one of these lights
came<00:01:37.020> down<00:01:37.229> very<00:01:37.590> close<00:01:37.859> to<00:01:38.070> my<00:01:38.219> car<00:01:38.549> and

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
came down very close to my car and

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.599 
came down very close to my car and
passed<00:01:39.719> over<00:01:39.960> that<00:01:40.289> there<00:01:40.950> was<00:01:41.070> a<00:01:41.100> wooded<00:01:41.460> area

00:01:41.599 --> 00:01:41.609 
passed over that there was a wooded area

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:43.819 
passed over that there was a wooded area
all<00:01:41.939> around<00:01:41.969> me<00:01:42.479> diesel<00:01:42.869> were<00:01:43.079> all<00:01:43.409> head<00:01:43.710> of

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
all around me diesel were all head of

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.880 
all around me diesel were all head of
wooded<00:01:44.189> hills<00:01:44.960> and<00:01:45.960> it<00:01:46.049> passed<00:01:46.350> over<00:01:46.710> these

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
wooded hills and it passed over these

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.880 
wooded hills and it passed over these
woods<00:01:47.219> and<00:01:47.789> it<00:01:47.909> seemed<00:01:48.149> to<00:01:48.179> descend<00:01:48.890> right

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
woods and it seemed to descend right

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.669 
woods and it seemed to descend right
into<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.759> forest<00:01:51.149> right<00:01:51.509> next<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:51.869> my<00:01:52.020> car<00:01:52.289> and

00:01:52.669 --> 00:01:52.679 
into the forest right next to my car and

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:54.859 
into the forest right next to my car and
the<00:01:53.159> next<00:01:53.399> day<00:01:53.520> when<00:01:53.700> I<00:01:53.729> woke<00:01:53.939> up<00:01:54.119> in<00:01:54.270> my<00:01:54.299> motel

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
the next day when I woke up in my motel

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.859 
the next day when I woke up in my motel
room<00:01:54.929> there<00:01:55.409> my<00:01:56.340> eyes<00:01:56.369> were<00:01:56.939> very<00:01:56.969> sore<00:01:57.570> like

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869

they were full

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.029 
they were full
and<00:01:58.729> and<00:01:59.689> this<00:01:59.930> is<00:02:00.079> a<00:02:00.109> common<00:02:00.530> effect<00:02:00.859> of

00:02:01.029 --> 00:02:01.039 
and and this is a common effect of

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:02.139 
and and this is a common effect of
looking<00:02:01.219> at<00:02:01.490> these<00:02:01.670> lights

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:02.149 
looking at these lights

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:05.440 
looking at these lights
it's<00:02:02.810> called<00:02:03.049> conjunctivitis<00:02:04.210> it's<00:02:05.210> like

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450
