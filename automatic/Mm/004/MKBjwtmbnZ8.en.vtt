kites<00:00:20.400> is<00:00:20.580> here<00:00:20.760> let's<00:00:20.939> talk<00:00:21.060> about<00:00:21.270> them<00:00:21.480> okay

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
kites is here let's talk about them okay

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.500 
kites is here let's talk about them okay
so<00:00:24.439> in<00:00:25.439> here<00:00:25.500> today<00:00:26.250> is<00:00:26.580> the<00:00:27.000> new<00:00:27.150> Bennett

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
so in here today is the new Bennett

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.810 
so in here today is the new Bennett
that's<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:27.840> number<00:00:28.080> of<00:00:28.170> eight<00:00:28.580> that's<00:00:29.580> a<00:00:29.670> 9

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
that's the number of eight that's a 9

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.490 
that's the number of eight that's a 9
meter<00:00:32.000> so<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.540> Bandit<00:00:33.840> that<00:00:33.989> may<00:00:34.140> not<00:00:34.260> go<00:00:34.440> to

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
meter so the Bandit that may not go to

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.729 
meter so the Bandit that may not go to
kite<00:00:34.800> right<00:00:35.100> and<00:00:35.399> but<00:00:36.390> this<00:00:36.600> year<00:00:36.930> we<00:00:37.290> we<00:00:37.620> have

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
kite right and but this year we we have

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.310 
kite right and but this year we we have
also<00:00:37.860> a<00:00:38.010> second<00:00:38.370> kite<00:00:38.899> which<00:00:39.899> is<00:00:40.050> called<00:00:40.230> a

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
also a second kite which is called a

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.319 
also a second kite which is called a
trust<00:00:40.620> which<00:00:41.340> will<00:00:41.550> come<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:41.760> little<00:00:41.910> later

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
trust which will come a little later

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.600 
trust which will come a little later
which<00:00:42.840> is<00:00:42.989> based<00:00:43.230> on<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.500> bandit<00:00:43.890> just<00:00:44.340> more

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
which is based on the bandit just more

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.670 
which is based on the bandit just more
like<00:00:44.700> a<00:00:44.730> friendly<00:00:45.149> when<00:00:45.539> your<00:00:45.719> kite<00:00:45.930> for

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
like a friendly when your kite for

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.819 
like a friendly when your kite for
school<00:00:47.010> and<00:00:47.340> intermediate<00:00:47.879> people<00:00:48.239> and<00:00:48.829> also

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
school and intermediate people and also

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.709 
school and intermediate people and also
this<00:00:49.980> year<00:00:50.039> we<00:00:50.309> will<00:00:50.520> add<00:00:50.700> a<00:00:50.969> third<00:00:51.239> kite<00:00:51.510> so

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
this year we will add a third kite so

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.319 
this year we will add a third kite so
that's<00:00:51.899> when<00:00:52.260> you<00:00:52.379> for<00:00:52.649> us<00:00:52.910> they<00:00:53.910> are<00:00:53.940> still

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
that's when you for us they are still

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.389 
that's when you for us they are still
working<00:00:54.480> on<00:00:54.750> it<00:00:54.809> should<00:00:55.320> be<00:00:55.440> released<00:00:55.770> before

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
working on it should be released before

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.819 
working on it should be released before
the<00:00:56.610> end<00:00:56.969> of<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.149> Europe<00:00:57.449> we<00:00:58.170> don't<00:00:58.590> know<00:00:58.710> the

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
the end of the Europe we don't know the

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.869 
the end of the Europe we don't know the
name<00:00:59.010> yet<00:00:59.219> so<00:00:59.600> that<00:01:00.600> third<00:01:01.320> cut<00:01:01.680> will<00:01:02.460> address

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
name yet so that third cut will address

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.810 
name yet so that third cut will address
like<00:01:03.239> a<00:01:03.270> niche<00:01:03.960> market<00:01:03.989> kind<00:01:04.739> of<00:01:04.860> way<00:01:05.010> will<00:01:05.670> be

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
like a niche market kind of way will be

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.530 
like a niche market kind of way will be
Malacca<00:01:06.090> as<00:01:06.360> I<00:01:06.390> expect<00:01:07.140> by<00:01:07.260> show<00:01:07.439> kite<00:01:07.680> and

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:08.540 
Malacca as I expect by show kite and

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.210 
Malacca as I expect by show kite and
made<00:01:09.540> for<00:01:09.930> more<00:01:10.110> like<00:01:10.229> waste<00:01:10.560> wasting

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
made for more like waste wasting

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.830 
made for more like waste wasting
following<00:01:12.260> because<00:01:13.820> f1<00:01:14.820> is<00:01:14.939> also<00:01:15.270> working<00:01:15.540> on

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
following because f1 is also working on

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.800 
following because f1 is also working on
a4<00:01:16.229> which<00:01:16.799> will<00:01:17.040> be<00:01:17.220> available<00:01:17.490> in<00:01:18.150> a<00:01:18.540> spring

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
a4 which will be available in a spring

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.630 
a4 which will be available in a spring
so<00:01:19.290> that<00:01:19.320> will<00:01:19.530> be<00:01:19.650> like<00:01:19.770> more<00:01:20.009> like<00:01:20.040> a<00:01:20.189> package

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
so that will be like more like a package

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.719 
so that will be like more like a package
you<00:01:21.299> know<00:01:21.450> for<00:01:21.840> plus<00:01:22.320> that<00:01:22.560> new<00:01:22.799> kite<00:01:23.040> that<00:01:23.580> is

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
you know for plus that new kite that is

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.390 
you know for plus that new kite that is
coming<00:01:23.970> up<00:01:24.119> so<00:01:24.960> some<00:01:25.680> of<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.890> changes<00:01:26.130> from

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
coming up so some of the changes from

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.910 
coming up so some of the changes from
last<00:01:26.880> year's<00:01:27.180> banded<00:01:27.689> to<00:01:27.840> this<00:01:27.990> year<00:01:28.259> so<00:01:28.680> for

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
last year's banded to this year so for

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.640 
last year's banded to this year so for
the<00:01:29.040> bandit<00:01:29.490> basically<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.390> idea<00:01:30.630> is<00:01:30.780> always

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
the bandit basically the idea is always

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.830 
the bandit basically the idea is always
the<00:01:32.009> same<00:01:32.220> way<00:01:32.549> so<00:01:32.610> it's<00:01:33.030> based<00:01:33.210> on<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.420> delta

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
the same way so it's based on the delta

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.929 
the same way so it's based on the delta
which<00:01:34.290> has<00:01:34.439> been<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.710> case<00:01:34.860> since<00:01:35.490> day<00:01:35.729> one

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
which has been the case since day one

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.990 
which has been the case since day one
since<00:01:36.180> 2008<00:01:36.810> now<00:01:37.100> so<00:01:38.100> it's<00:01:38.220> very<00:01:38.369> easy<00:01:38.549> to<00:01:38.880> be

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
since 2008 now so it's very easy to be

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.870 
since 2008 now so it's very easy to be
launched<00:01:39.210> and<00:01:39.479> that<00:01:39.540> is<00:01:40.350> I<00:01:40.680> think<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:41.670> best

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
launched and that is I think the best

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.410 
launched and that is I think the best
word<00:01:42.240> to<00:01:42.630> describe<00:01:43.079> it<00:01:43.619> is<00:01:43.970> versatility<00:01:44.970> so

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
word to describe it is versatility so

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.840 
word to describe it is versatility so
that's<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.899> most<00:01:46.079> versatile<00:01:46.770> kite<00:01:47.100> you<00:01:47.640> can

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
that's the most versatile kite you can

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.069 
that's the most versatile kite you can
find<00:01:48.119> ok<00:01:49.579> new<00:01:50.579> for<00:01:50.850> this<00:01:50.939> year<00:01:51.000> so<00:01:51.299> they<00:01:51.630> did

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
find ok new for this year so they did

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.080 
find ok new for this year so they did
what<00:01:52.470> they<00:01:52.590> do<00:01:52.649> every<00:01:53.250> year<00:01:53.280> which<00:01:53.700> is<00:01:53.909> to

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
what they do every year which is to

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.929 
what they do every year which is to
basically<00:01:54.600> deconstruct<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:55.649> kites<00:01:55.939> entirely

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
basically deconstruct the kites entirely

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.649 
basically deconstruct the kites entirely
and<00:01:57.329> go<00:01:58.020> and<00:01:58.380> you<00:01:58.979> one<00:01:59.729> prototype<00:02:00.119> at<00:02:00.420> a<00:02:00.479> time

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
and go and you one prototype at a time

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.679 
and go and you one prototype at a time
and<00:02:00.840> they<00:02:01.290> did<00:02:01.439> 58<00:02:02.040> again<00:02:02.369> on<00:02:02.579> one<00:02:02.939> size<00:02:03.240> which

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
and they did 58 again on one size which

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.270 
and they did 58 again on one size which
is<00:02:03.840> no<00:02:03.930> 9<00:02:04.110> which<00:02:04.380> you<00:02:04.799> have<00:02:04.950> a<00:02:05.030> opinion

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
is no 9 which you have a opinion

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.160 
is no 9 which you have a opinion
and<00:02:07.860> we<00:02:08.860> walked<00:02:09.160> the<00:02:09.819> profile<00:02:10.240> we<00:02:10.750> walked<00:02:11.020> the

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
and we walked the profile we walked the

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.449 
and we walked the profile we walked the
attachments<00:02:11.740> we<00:02:12.340> walked<00:02:13.830> the<00:02:14.830> idea<00:02:15.100> was<00:02:15.430> to

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
attachments we walked the idea was to

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:18.150 
attachments we walked the idea was to
just<00:02:15.790> try<00:02:16.330> to<00:02:16.390> improve<00:02:16.930> the<00:02:17.650> way<00:02:17.830> the<00:02:17.890> kite

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
just try to improve the way the kite

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.960 
just try to improve the way the kite
will<00:02:18.370> fly<00:02:18.400> forward<00:02:19.120> and<00:02:19.420> with<00:02:20.380> less<00:02:21.010> lateral

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
will fly forward and with less lateral

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.510 
will fly forward and with less lateral
pull<00:02:22.209> that<00:02:22.959> was<00:02:23.110> the<00:02:23.260> idea<00:02:23.530> to<00:02:23.739> get<00:02:24.100> something

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
pull that was the idea to get something

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.000 
pull that was the idea to get something
where<00:02:24.760> the<00:02:25.450> kite<00:02:25.720> you<00:02:26.230> don't<00:02:26.440> need<00:02:26.590> you<00:02:26.860> know

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
where the kite you don't need you know

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:28.920 
where the kite you don't need you know
you<00:02:27.880> don't<00:02:28.030> know<00:02:28.180> you<00:02:28.450> don't<00:02:28.480> have<00:02:28.660> a<00:02:28.720> lot<00:02:28.900> of

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
you don't know you don't have a lot of

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.250 
you don't know you don't have a lot of
traction<00:02:29.340> in<00:02:30.340> a<00:02:30.459> lateral<00:02:30.730> way<00:02:31.000> so<00:02:31.540> that<00:02:31.900> was

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
traction in a lateral way so that was

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.530 
traction in a lateral way so that was
the<00:02:32.380> idea<00:02:32.620> they<00:02:33.069> leave<00:02:33.250> us<00:02:33.370> at<00:02:33.550> that<00:02:33.670> kind<00:02:33.910> yeah

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
the idea they leave us at that kind yeah

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
the idea they leave us at that kind yeah
now<00:02:35.170> with<00:02:35.380> other<00:02:35.620> kites<00:02:36.150> yeah<00:02:37.150> I<00:02:37.180> know<00:02:37.530> one<00:02:38.530> of

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
now with other kites yeah I know one of

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:39.840 
now with other kites yeah I know one of
the<00:02:38.739> kites<00:02:38.950> you<00:02:39.100> really<00:02:39.370> can't<00:02:39.610> talk<00:02:39.790> about

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
the kites you really can't talk about

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.150 
the kites you really can't talk about
because<00:02:40.510> it's<00:02:40.870> not<00:02:41.080> out<00:02:41.290> yet<00:02:41.590> but<00:02:41.650> the<00:02:41.980> other

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
because it's not out yet but the other

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.060 
because it's not out yet but the other
one<00:02:42.489> let's<00:02:43.420> talk<00:02:43.570> about<00:02:43.690> West<00:02:44.019> so<00:02:44.650> the<00:02:44.769> trust

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.070 
one let's talk about West so the trust

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:48.930 
one let's talk about West so the trust
is<00:02:45.600> it's<00:02:46.600> not<00:02:46.720> a<00:02:46.950> new<00:02:47.950> kite<00:02:48.160> per<00:02:48.340> se<00:02:48.519> because<00:02:48.670> we

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
is it's not a new kite per se because we

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.880 
is it's not a new kite per se because we
have<00:02:49.030> had<00:02:49.120> the<00:02:49.269> trust<00:02:49.570> in<00:02:50.019> the<00:02:50.080> past<00:02:50.380> years<00:02:50.620> so

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
have had the trust in the past years so

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.370 
have had the trust in the past years so
it's<00:02:51.430> always<00:02:51.610> the<00:02:51.819> idea<00:02:52.030> was<00:02:52.239> to<00:02:52.269> get<00:02:52.569> you<00:02:53.260> use
