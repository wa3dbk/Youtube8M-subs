00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.529
 I did a brief video about the topic and 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.570
 I received a lot of questions, the guys asked. 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.970
 quite a lot of doubt about 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.760

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.640
 make a new video then the only people 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.070
 difference that you will have is a 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.869
 with a wire is that in the control 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.620
 you will need to buy one 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:36.719
 adapter is a receiver is always a 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.420
 receiver to receive the wireless signal 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.070

 The camera is making the connection, right? 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.420

 it's asking for dearly 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:17.540
 control with receiver comes out cheaper 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.550

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.150
 install windows 7 version will 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.680
 function perfectly well in a 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:56.150
 partition on my computer has windows 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:58.100
 7 and on the other partition has 128.1 both I 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.260
 I installed the neural control of the 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.400
 control windows 7 and worked 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.490
 perfectly 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:07.220
 then people beauty in this part here and 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:09.680
 You 're going to install the next step here. 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.270
 né ô ô ô control drive 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.210
 basically you have to be told that 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:16.730
 it was not only there or if you made the 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:20.120
 transfer of the site file is only 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:22.400
 click on execute click here 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:25.370
 I accepted the terms and ordered 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.430
 it will install the control driver 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.480
 let's wait 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:33.620
 beauty people finished 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:36.050
 It's very important when you finish 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:38.360
 the program will ask you to restart the 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:40.850
 computer race for the computer does not 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:43.250
 error I already tried to install the control 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:45.590
 without restarting and the control did not work 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.910
 so you will click here to finalize 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.100
 it will ask you to restart the 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:50.720
 computer you will restart your computer. 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:54.080
 computer and the next step is 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.820
 making with the camera beauty people I'm 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:57.950
 here with control and I'm here with 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:58.910
 receiver, how is the respect here for 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:01.520
 you 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:04.700
 basically an end button receiver 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:07.190
 it's not that you're going to push to do 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:08.900
 the connection with the control people one 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:11.780
 doubt that everyone has got 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:15.980
 asked is that the people who have the 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:19.010
 keyboard is from microsoft wireless to o 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:20.900
 similar to this here and all 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:23.660
 world asks if keyboard respect 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:25.910
 is used to connect the xbox control 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:28.760
 360 I believe 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:30.920
 because otherwise microsoft is maybe not me 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:33.170
 give this receiver separate 

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:35.240
 then the following you have a control the 

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:37.820
 that sometimes you have a receiver of the 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:40.160
 microsoft keyboard tests there if 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:42.680
 show here the video here if 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.660
 worked or not to help the crew 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.880
 beauty people then beauty the next 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:50.000
 step is we will be the attack 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:52.790
 taking out that there is the aran me that not 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:57.410
 learned a thread and I will connect 

00:04:52.790 --> 00:05:01.940
 this receiver on the USB port of my 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:06.110
 computer is important it came right with 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:07.520
 this disk here is the drive is dodo with 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:09.940
 of the executor 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:12.560
 so basically if you do not have 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:15.230
 neder will get your computer just enough 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:17.120
 you use the transfer in the 

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:19.460
 the drive's website to install the 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:22.780
 receiver and come back here people bounce 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:25.690
 connecting to the USB port on the computer 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:30.050
 receptor 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:32.180
 I already put a sink in my control with the 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:35.480
 next step people will be you 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:37.730
 control button presses this button. 

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:41.060
 here and here on the people side 

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:44.330
 you have a connection button leaves 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:47.240
 the team near here to focus the camera 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:51.140
 You see people here, we have a 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:54.980
 little button here for us is to make the 

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:57.290
 connection between the control and the 

00:05:54.980 --> 00:06:01.190
 We're going to make people call the 

00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:03.800
 control will press the 

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:04.730
 the receiver until the receiver 

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.890
 flashing 

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:09.770
 let's turn the control on by the button 

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:12.080
 and let's tighten the 

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:16.370
 button here on the connection side and 

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:19.760
 let's wait in beauty connector ready 

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:21.770
 basically the game right you will 

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:23.600
 start ali zardari on your computer 

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:25.580
 If you're playing china, you do not have 

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:28.790
 problem for another program or if you 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:31.730
 is the game can be by disk anyway 

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:33.919
 is the game basically it will have 

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:35.150
 support this control here and you do not 

00:06:33.919 --> 00:06:37.160
 have to make with fig 

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:39.710
 the button action none I believe the 

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:43.340
 from 2005 onwards every game that has gone to 

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:47.240

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:51.140
 for this control here 

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:53.930
 basically you did the configuration of the 

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:56.270
 receiver control with a wire goes 

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:59.750
