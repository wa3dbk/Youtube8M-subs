00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
 the sky that day we leave ourselves 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:06.859

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.450
 spain 

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:12.080
 a little point turn to the 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.080
 African continent 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:19.680
 tarifa is only 11 km as the crow flies 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:22.640
 of Morocco and it is the most Moroccan of 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.640
 all the Andalusian villages 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.910
 but the comparison stops there because for 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.910
 the rest is rather saint tropez 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.590
 every summer a horde of invaders 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.620

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:54.920
 that people have been told about tarifa for 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:57.410
 that they all come here they have the 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.660
 feeling of being free they do this 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:03.410
 what they want is that which attracts the 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:06.040
 the world was before because of the wind 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:09.350

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.570

 without wind in the month it's really the 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:25.970
