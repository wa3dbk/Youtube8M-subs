 romance simply this top is going 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.740
 differ from others since indeed I 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.289
 will not read you the summary but 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.970
 the encrusted in picture why so everything 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.070
 just so the episode is less 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.109
 heavy and less lengthy for you say my 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.240
 comment what do you think about it and its 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.519
 number 10 body parts of a gas 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.930
 stopped and then hike from a quasar and 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.580
 Tehran all I will say simply 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.019
 that it's a good animated started 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.300
 when you are young since it is the 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.399
 target audience frozen indeed look there are 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.930
 a few years when I had what 14 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.090
 15 years old and he was not bad 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.980
 I was there simply that at my age 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.600
 if you want to watch it it's a 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.969
 to watch without breaking his head 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.010
 who is comical the economic situation 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.840
 be seen that it will be a boy arrived 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.670
 on an idea that will be done to hunt 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.590
 by several girls who will want everything 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.660
 just lying down with that's the 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.579
 only guy who raps you a friend 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.309
 look to have a good time without 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.890
 too much to break the head 1h09 dengeki 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.989
 daisy lowe honestly dengeki daisy me 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.630
 much better I put them much higher 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.820
 if he had not taken a turn that 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.950
 dislikes me ie the evolution of a 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.720
 characters that was for me one 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.340
 of the most interesting in the history does 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.409
 will not please me anyway 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.030
 grids dy is a good show I 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.100
 advise enormously the story is 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.659
 interesting intrigue him also a lot 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.920
 of mystery questions that hovers around 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.900
 characters 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.340
 short very interesting I think even 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.689
 the boys will be able to read it since he 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.400
 do not animate but like me from the 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.170
 turn of a character you will not like 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.720
 not necessarily but hey I would not 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.820
 not too far ahead number 8 blue wright 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.530
 the story is interesting a lot 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.509
 of emotion I liked because it's 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.100
 a situation that could happen in 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.420
 everyone's life in any case it's a 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.350
 very beautiful story that devours in 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.079
 some episodes 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.820
 a dozen or more but hey it's drawn 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.189
 of a show so I think it will please 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.140
 especially to girls and my boy well 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.450
 that I interested in a recipe 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.759
 this July 8th following guard is actually 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.079
 the first show I started and him 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.750
 it's my girlfriend who advised me 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.549
 frozen started there was 25 volume and 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.810
 honestly it was not bad why 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.909
 I found it not bad simply 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.720
 because the on and off mode is a mode 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.700
 than 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.140
 all girls not everything but a lot 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.649
 of girls adepts I found that 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.270
 interesting 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.760
 I found it interesting to me as well 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.080
 even with this mode on and off we can very 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.730
 find love and who one who 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.320
 we accept as we approach 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.000
 places and in humor 7 or that I 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.620
 appreciated it simply because at the 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.480
 late I thought it might be 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.190
 a little too much that everything goes well then 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.960
 the shore something and I find that 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.880
 the manga run out of steam a little and 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.290
 luckily who ended up in the top 25 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.720
 but it's still a good manga say 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.910
 number 6 as pionners campo snow 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.680
 icy after if it's a harem manga 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.450
 so there will be several movies every 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.130
 hero so I placed in this top for 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.270
 to please boys that it is 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.470
 egalitarian a little bit anyway 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.580
 in any case what I appreciated in 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.020
 this year but it's just 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.430
 not really the relationship between 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.910
 characters since she has a little what 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.650
 the fuck 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.380
 but just fighting the side 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.730
 historical that it interests me enough of 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.320
 place them as a wholesaler because 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.990
 just for me there was a 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.730
 some potential unused as I 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:01.470
 you explained I expect them to 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.530
 take a good turn where there is 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.940
 good epic fights and actually no 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.170
 he did not say you do not you that's it 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.430
 but it's still a good animated 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.410
 follow at number 5 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.790
 Camille its brand chimay machine 7 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.590
 Animated I can appreciate since in 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.209
 effect this is the first animated type 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.080
 shoujo i looked i appreciate 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:17.790
 several things in 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.560
 already the character of our granny I the 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.060
 finds interesting drones and then the 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.980
 situation in which is found is 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.540
 fun enough but the character who took me 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.430
 the most interested and the character of 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.050
 fall as tomoe over episodes 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.540
 we realize that he has some 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:32.010
 passed heavy sad and I find this 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.690
 aspect of his interesting personality 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.280
 and that we discover over the episodes 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.970
 and that we still discover in the 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.650
 season 2 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.480
 so I'm very happy with it all 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.130
 kamisama case to gimeuse machida i would say 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.390
 that he is a friend but that both 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:45.299
 boys that girls can watch 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:47.220
 romance is present but fun at 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:49.049
 number 4 kg or kane to katana to 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.340
 welcome or kent katana it will do 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:52.320
 pleasure to both boys and 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.820
 girls since the fights are epic 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.080
 I liked it but it's not just that 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:56.549
 which I liked because there is also 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.049
 the story of the characters the 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:00.209
 protagonists of history we certainly 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:02.100
 a painful past that is interesting 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:03.510
 to discover then what I liked to follow 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:05.730
 is the relationship between the two 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.490
 protagonists who will be in my opinion very 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:08.500
 pretty 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:10.630
 very good until the end and precisely 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.710
 the end is what I liked the most I 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:13.720
 found very pregnant 

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:16.450
 short I liked it I advise you to 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:18.190
 huge in number 3 to be you know 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:20.080
 of enamels welcome daiichi size this 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.970
 year but I loved why so everything 

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:23.470
 simply because at the beginning we say 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.700
 that he is a friend but to watch without 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:26.470
 Too much to break his head which is fun 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.970
 but more we advance in the episodes 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:30.190
 opus we realize that there is a 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:32.470
 some depth to some past 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:34.570
 painful that surrounds the characters 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:36.220
 especially that of the protagonist more 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:37.480
 I like the delusions that are typing in 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.490
 believing they have super powers 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:41.020
 it's pretty fun to finally follow 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:42.730
 as I say it's a friend who 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.770
 hide more depth than there 

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:45.970
 looks good and even if at first it does not 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:47.410
 I do not like you 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.150
 advise to continue and do not 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:51.490
 hang on because the end I find 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:54.220
 rather beautiful in humor two shows beats 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:56.380
 lime beats and I really hesitated 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:58.080
 at the subway number 1 but finally 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:00.070
 admitted to number 2 but I love 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.390
 enormously what so simply 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:03.100
 because the story I find 

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:04.930
 really really really really 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:06.820
 beautiful already at the level of the characters and 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:08.740
 a certain depth then the past of the 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:10.090
 showbiz is interesting we wonder 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.890
 where does it come from but what really 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:13.480
 More in the manga than I read the manga 

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:15.100
 and watch us but that's it 

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:17.500
 simply because it addresses a 

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:19.000
 thematic that we will soon or that 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.440
 we are already asking now it's up to 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.330
 to say do robots form 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.740
 humanoid will one day replace 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:25.390
 women this is a question that we can 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:26.770
 already arise today since at 

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:28.990
 today's time we are dragging 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:31.090
 dolls models who really have 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:32.860
 a human form close to reality 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:34.240
 and if already today we can create 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:36.340
 that means that soon in a 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:38.140
 near future we can create robots 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:40.390
 in human form very close to the stop 

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:41.800
 could not replace women 

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:43.660
 where we will see men all 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.800
 simply in everyone's life finally 

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:46.210
 in short I found it very interesting 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.380
 since in the manga currently in 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:48.310
 question is asking 

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:49.810
 and what is good in the end 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:51.490
 is it better to have 

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:53.050
 feelings for this robot that looks 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:54.760
 to have feelings promised or else 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:56.470
 it's badly short I let you debate 

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:59.350
 in the comments about this and in 

00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:02.350
 number 1 hirono kaka enlivened me the 

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:04.730
 look a few years ago is no longer 

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:06.710
 I loved it just why 

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:08.240
 already it changes the protagonist of 

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:09.320
 the story is a girl and there is 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:11.060
 several boys circling around 

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:13.370
 it's quite funny because it 

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:15.140
 blunt art type changes the boy who 

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:15.710
 pleased with the reflections around him me I 

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:17.060
 found it funny 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:18.140
 but besides that because I found 

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:19.640
 interesting is the story in it 

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:21.170
 even since in my eyes the interesting 

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:23.090
 there is a lot of mystery that hangs 

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:24.620
 around the different characters and 

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:26.330
 you know me well I love the mystery 

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:26.840
 then you know it 's not just that 

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:28.610
 that I love 

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:30.590
 there are the love stories there I go 

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:32.930
 have my account and then there is not that 

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:34.760
 that I also love magic that I 

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:36.950
 must also have my account since he 

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:38.150
 there are powers and epic fights 

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:39.980
 it's like the people die 

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:41.360
 because I think it's a sum 

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:43.610
 the anime and I could you 

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:45.050

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:47.000

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:49.040
 of love is very touching that will please 

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.540

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:52.310
