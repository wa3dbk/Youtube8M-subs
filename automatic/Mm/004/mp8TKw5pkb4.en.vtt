00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:16.090
 hello everyone guys from the face game 

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:17.949
 as you see each state a small series 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.949
 su clash of france in many but you have it 

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:23.320
 recommended and accepted this star 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:26.860
 in life he says but to do the first series on 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:29.379
 clash of clans being also maybe one 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:33.340
 of the first in Italy to bring them this 

00:00:29.379 --> 00:00:34.690
 types of gameplay on smartphones are 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.870
 managed to upgrade the town hall 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:39.879
 level 9 the construction is finished approximately 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.800
 yesterday you all recommended me to 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:43.150
 build the hicks bow 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.760
 here he has already put it into production 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:47.290
 he told me a very powerful defense e 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.300
 now unfortunately I can't see the 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:53.770
 statistics because unfortunately when I go 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:56.770
 on the menu and press info you tell me 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:58.899
 only the description of the arc but not 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:03.610
 tells me exactly the statistics of the 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:04.780
 give the second life and points 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.000
 wound etcetera 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.729
 the laboratory was immediately strengthened 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.530
 research so that it lasts three days 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:14.289
 still the construction in these three 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:17.319
 days try to accumulate more elixirs 

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:18.490
 possible so I can immediately unlock the 

00:01:17.319 --> 00:01:20.709
 giants that know how to see you of the 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:24.759
 they cost about 6 million or 7 million 

00:01:20.709 --> 00:01:25.539
 exactly now I don't know how much they will cost 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:28.389
 at level 6 

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:30.759
 therefore I prevented already put in 

00:01:28.389 --> 00:01:33.520
 research laboratories production is a 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:36.100
 elixir deposit that I'm going to upgrade 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.229
 precisely because I will need it to increase 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.170
 the capacity of my deposits e 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:45.030
 make sure of 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:47.159
 get to 6 million elixirs in the 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.280
 time when it ends 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.960
 search so I don't waste time and that 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.909
 I will immediately start the search for the giants 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.000
 level you know I think was one 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:59.280
 beauty two stronger because you look 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.200
 when I'm joking about free info 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.350
 that you see them at level 5 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.570
 missing very little green bar 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.670
 let's say to get to the maximum damage e 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.560
 maximum hit points while for how much 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.900
 concerns the five level hard giants 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.280
 to you there is almost a quarter bar 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.130
 so I think they will come around 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.620
 at 1,000 hit points it is a damage to the 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:22.260
 second tri true on the 40 certainly 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.150
 I think about 40 so they will be a lot 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.980
 difficult to break down and are also 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.950
 very useful for destroying defenses i 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.840
 giants are the basic troupe for the 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.730
 gone then or strengthened they have of 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:36.269
 as you advised me made the wall 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.950
 at level 7 where to do this part 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:41.880
 this part but I don't do it yet 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:43.830
 because I decide why unfortunately the 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.260
 free mason you see I have a bricklayer 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.510
 which is making wide ex1 washing machine h1 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.609
 just put in to make the deposit 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.040
 on the contrary, I remind you of the strengthening of one 

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:54.840
 gem with a gem to double 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.570
 until the new one comes out 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.280
 update in which they will insert the 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:01.739
 clan wars 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:06.269
 you can double the production of 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:07.890
 elixir le dÃ©sir black and gold at the cost of 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:09.510
 only a gem now gone attacking 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.010
 someone even if the shield ends 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.510
 I have no problems in Cuba has found one 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.820
 beautiful 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.680
 this is a strong village though 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:20.100
 strong village I don't think I can succeed 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.840
 attack him because even if to the defenses 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:25.290
 of 20 guns are not right at the 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:27.780
 maximum between two powerful hickson bow 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.970
 actions are also strong at the town hall 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.530
 out so you can carlo and take 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.329
 the trophies but I don't care about this 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.079
 moment I want to make more resources 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:36.769
 possible 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:41.639
 here boy I finally found one 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:43.920
 attachable to what we say or in 

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:45.840
 this moment in the troops of how much 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.100
 I have not very strong troops I have tried to 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.100
 spend as little as possible 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:53.400
 now you see he left the 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:54.690
 at the town hall inside the wall so not 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.370
 directly attack unique 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:59.220
 completely it was just a rest I see that 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:02.430
 there are three defenses then attacked 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:04.170
 throw the wall splits destroy them 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.670
 wall the bomb went off i recommend you 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:09.060
 always throw the wall splitting 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:10.740
 at the beginning in order to succeed the data 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.170
 local mats how to use a 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:14.760
 spell of care always use the 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:17.630
 only practically to the spell of the 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:19.430
 care because it gives all 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:21.560
 other for much more energy then there is the 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:25.460
 level gives us a lot of energy and vi 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:28.420
 lets you keep the giants 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:32.660
 alive for much longer 

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:34.970
 now we say that having so many barbarians 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:38.020
 I must be able to destroy with i 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:40.610
 giant sorcerers and mortars 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:44.660
 killing distinguish the mortars they are 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:47.840
 the only ones to do harm to give about 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:50.150
 a large area in a single target 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:52.910
 they are the ones that surely me 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:54.920
 they worry more as the barbarians 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:56.870
 they are very strong if they go against a 

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:59.720
 cannon an archer but they are very weak 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:01.010
 when they go against a sorcerer or 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:06.540
 a mortar 

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:08.910
 therefore more more 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:11.250
 in defense he can kill this one 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:12.780
 type better and now as you see they have 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:14.850
 all the giants but it doesn't matter now 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:17.640
 I will send all my barbarians to a 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:19.770
 horror in a crazy horde and will try to 

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:23.160
 steal as much resources as possible when 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:25.380
 the sorcerer begins to kill me 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:27.420
 too many barbarians I do nothing but 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:29.849
 send a spell tosi with 

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:32.339
 the spell I can a 

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:34.080
 to make the troops recover more energy 

00:05:32.339 --> 00:05:36.929
 of sorcerer practically result 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:39.389
 useless and unable to access it as 

00:05:36.929 --> 00:05:41.009
 said all of them already stolen 

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:43.529
 I won the battle so I come 

00:05:41.009 --> 00:05:45.179
 also the trophies because they are also i 

00:05:43.529 --> 00:05:48.389
 trophies that momentarily I am 

00:05:45.179 --> 00:05:50.189
 trying to be pretty is back 

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:53.009
 of trophies so as not to be attacked 

00:05:50.189 --> 00:05:54.300
 often now barbaric comics are 

00:05:53.009 --> 00:05:56.490
 mounting says that in all defenses 

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:58.740
 I'm going to steal all the laws and the elixir 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:03.360
 I recovered everything because I spent 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:05.249
 about 60,000 elixirs anyway 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:07.740
 I recovered them and as for 

00:06:05.249 --> 00:06:09.449
 the gold stolen 600 thousand gold therefore with the 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:11.490
 bonus is fine 

00:06:09.449 --> 00:06:13.469
 now I just miss the two pretty much 

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:15.809
 guns to take out will make it 

00:06:13.469 --> 00:06:18.179
 surely there are the barbarians and the 

00:06:15.809 --> 00:06:21.629
 fees are at a very low level 

00:06:18.179 --> 00:06:23.249
 therefore indeed even an archer does not 

00:06:21.629 --> 00:06:24.959
 will certainly be a problem 

00:06:23.249 --> 00:06:27.809
 I win the battle one hundred percent 

00:06:24.959 --> 00:06:31.529
 in the exact 3 minutes and I managed to 

00:06:27.809 --> 00:06:33.629
 also take 94 thousand gold and 64,000 

00:06:31.529 --> 00:06:35.550
 to elixir a unit of black elixir it 

00:06:33.629 --> 00:06:37.229
 spend little on troops go to 

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:39.300
 detriment to win more attack 

00:06:37.229 --> 00:06:42.509
 easily this is normal 

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:45.119
 if you did about a dozen 

00:06:42.509 --> 00:06:47.550
 so attack the day and take yourself 

00:06:45.119 --> 00:06:50.550
 almost a million gold if you are at one 

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:52.680
 lower level take 20,000 hours 

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:54.839
 every attack and make 10 a day goes 

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:57.059
 very well and consider that doing the 

00:06:54.839 --> 00:06:59.879
 troops is so you spend little and troops 

00:06:57.059 --> 00:07:01.319
 they try very little to generate themselves or between 

00:06:59.879 --> 00:07:03.029
 ten minutes will already have the troops ready 

00:07:01.319 --> 00:07:04.800
 there the video you enjoyed it guys 

00:07:03.029 --> 00:07:07.829

 like and given to impose an advice on 

00:07:07.829 --> 00:07:12.779
