00:00:00.679 --> 00:00:04.859
 and after three days knowing the reality of the criciúma people in our 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.270
 The team shows how the return to the southern cruise is done by their 

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:11.609
 Juruá region 

00:00:11.609 --> 00:00:12.589
 in Port 

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:17.550
 people arrive early to ensure a better space on the boat the best space 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.250
 It is not quite the term because when you have the right day to go, there is no 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:23.779
 a lot of choice 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:28.970
 back to the southern cruise the trip takes longer and lasts approximately 23 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.509
 hours beyond the time of travel which is greater 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:35.760
 another difference is in the structure and accommodation of boats 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.920
 but we have the guarantee that the boat and safety 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.530
 mateus period worked 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.890
 happened the tragedy 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.480
 yesterday the councilman did not 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.000
 although it is a common practice in the region to board the port 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 there is still an action 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.430
 the bar that its route in the river Juruá resembles the routine of a bus in the 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:05.110
 road 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.380
 stops are always mandatory for the boarding of more passengers 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:16.250
 but a two or three new boat 17 meters long with three and a half 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.790
 wide is well filled 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.070
 presenting difficulties even for locomotion 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.840
 the reasons that lead people to cruising the south are many 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.230
 it's just lead to death 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.850
 It's carnival he said he could not 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:41.460
 to ward off 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.410
 34 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:47.620
 until you reach the place of destination the time is spent in which you live 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.620
 cormier how are you or sleep? 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:56.660
 but you also get time to look at the boats that cut the Juruá, including 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:02.530
 the ferries that sells manaus- with inputs for richter I taught the 4th course 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:07.550
 from the Amazonian capital to southern cruise with this type of material who lives 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.550
 around 20 to 30 days 

00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:18.369
 depending on the time of year travel by the Juruá can be quiet or not so much 

00:02:18.369 --> 00:02:22.829
 so for this floor in which now resides in southern cruise the 

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:26.639
 difficulties in the course of the trip were greater in the past 

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:29.249
 it looks like it was expected 

00:02:29.249 --> 00:02:32.379
 I was just waiting 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:34.039
 however the barriers 

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:36.029
 the scoreboard 

00:02:36.029 --> 00:02:38.829
 project 

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:42.259
 but if it gets to three parts 

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:45.369
 seven hundred reais 

00:02:45.369 --> 00:02:50.759
 but for the irony of the time we could also experience a bit of adrenaline 

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:53.950
 to face a storm in the middle of the Juruá river 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.300
 situation that further increases the attention of the commander of the boat 

00:03:05.499 --> 00:03:11.389
 after more than ten hours of rain horizonti adjustments pointed the arrival to the 

00:03:11.389 --> 00:03:13.149
 southern cruise port 

00:03:13.149 --> 00:03:17.009
 and the travels without a doubt was a safety painting 

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:20.280
 we had a lot of difficulty facing the storm like that 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.689
 not every day that happens but when the movie happens 

00:03:23.689 --> 00:03:26.559
 and we have to have the maximum attention 

00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:29.549
 But you can not deny it to Mary Sung 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:32.549
 luckily we managed to win and take a trip 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:38.369
 already in 300 people are looking without loss of time to solve their interests 

00:03:38.369 --> 00:03:42.479
 and by not having where to stay the majority stays in the boat 

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:44.629
 and I do not have a relative here 

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:47.819
 for me and for each country to indicate if we stay here at the bar 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:52.879
 - how about the Juruá that we found the leisure lady of the municipality of Ipixuna 

00:03:53.419 --> 00:03:58.579
 she was with the wife in the intensive care unit of the hospital as well 

00:03:58.579 --> 00:03:59.409
 here 

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:02.019
 Why is she? 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:05.319
 but one does not have to have to eat too 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:09.209
 I did not get much of a note 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:14.679
 last year more than 180 people were forwarded dividing to carry out 

00:04:14.679 --> 00:04:17.609
 treatment in other municipalities 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:22.650
 we stop for manaus- others for white river there is more came here for 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.370
 Juruá Hospital in Southern Cross 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:29.370
 not only of ipixuna but the service also extends to others 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:31.530
 municipalities of Amazonas the demo 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:33.610
 I walked from patients in the municipalities 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.610
 of Amazons that are close to August 3 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.870
 this reference has been constant rainfall 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.689
 then very often in receiving the patients 

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:45.689
 especially the municipalities of Guajará 

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:48.309
 and she even melts 

00:04:48.309 --> 00:04:50.930
 it seems that other needs 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:52.099
 and left months 

00:04:52.099 --> 00:04:54.830
 more amazonenses which acrians 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.259
 but to win with certainty 

00:04:57.259 --> 00:05:01.400
 each town stands a bit longer because the staff had very little 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:03.610
 by the way 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:07.509
 it's a very intimate project in the middle of the field even with one man over 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:12.939
 just enter the site and have been in the attack that is the project 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:17.069
 starts happening in singapore 

00:05:17.069 --> 00:05:22.329
 making it the city only next week developing and and for us 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:28.340
 is a great partner and that's where the Amazon is hard to get out of here 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:33.490
 to gilmar beyond the Juruá river and the Amazon forest 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:34.550
 to share 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:39.750
 until new policies are designed to better structure the city is by 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:44.310
 here we are going to stay like this at the bank in the health care business or 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:48.990
 education or even boat going up and that way the state there
