00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.330 

okay<00:00:18.830> so<00:00:19.820> to<00:00:20.450> get<00:00:20.570> this<00:00:20.720> we've<00:00:20.930> started<00:00:21.340> just

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:22.340 
okay so to get this we've started just

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:23.650 
okay so to get this we've started just
basically<00:00:22.730> working<00:00:22.910> on<00:00:23.090> making<00:00:23.270> a<00:00:23.450> little

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:23.660 
basically working on making a little

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.900 
basically working on making a little
basket<00:00:24.170> and<00:00:24.740> essentially<00:00:25.250> what<00:00:25.400> I've<00:00:25.490> done<00:00:25.670> is

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:25.910 
basket and essentially what I've done is

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.679 
basket and essentially what I've done is
I've<00:00:26.090> taken<00:00:26.570> about<00:00:27.640> 1/16<00:00:28.640> transcon<00:00:29.210> 8:1

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:29.689 
I've taken about 1/16 transcon 8:1

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:32.190 
I've taken about 1/16 transcon 8:1
direction<00:00:30.169> roughly<00:00:30.650> eight<00:00:30.829> another<00:00:31.099> and

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:32.200 
direction roughly eight another and

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.930 
direction roughly eight another and
started<00:00:33.200> the<00:00:33.410> center<00:00:33.650> square<00:00:34.130> and<00:00:34.430> all<00:00:34.730> I<00:00:34.790> did

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:34.940 
started the center square and all I did

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.330 
started the center square and all I did
to<00:00:35.120> do<00:00:35.239> that<00:00:35.420> was<00:00:35.660> basically<00:00:36.110> Center<00:00:36.500> up<00:00:36.649> the

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:37.340 
to do that was basically Center up the

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.060 
to do that was basically Center up the
links<00:00:37.670> of<00:00:37.820> the<00:00:37.850> cattail<00:00:38.300> leaves<00:00:39.110> and<00:00:39.440> then

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.070 
links of the cattail leaves and then

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.040 
links of the cattail leaves and then
just<00:00:40.399> started<00:00:40.670> doing<00:00:40.790> a<00:00:41.030> basic<00:00:41.239> over<00:00:41.810> and

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.050 
just started doing a basic over and

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:48.250 
just started doing a basic over and
under<00:00:42.320> pattern<00:00:42.680> and<00:00:42.860> interweaving<00:00:43.610> them<00:00:47.260> then

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:48.260 
under pattern and interweaving them then

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:53.710 
under pattern and interweaving them then
once<00:00:49.100> I<00:00:49.250> reached<00:00:49.520> the<00:00:51.610> approximate<00:00:52.610> size<00:00:52.910> you

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:53.720 
once I reached the approximate size you

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.740 
once I reached the approximate size you
know<00:00:53.840> roughly<00:00:54.350> you<00:00:54.680> know<00:00:54.970> say<00:00:55.970> five<00:00:56.240> inches<00:00:56.570> by

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 
know roughly you know say five inches by

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.780 
know roughly you know say five inches by
five<00:00:56.960> inches<00:00:56.990> of<00:00:57.410> what<00:00:57.950> I<00:00:57.980> wanted<00:00:58.370> my<00:00:58.550> little

00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:58.790 
five inches of what I wanted my little

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.110 
five inches of what I wanted my little
basket<00:00:59.060> to<00:00:59.390> be<00:00:59.570> then<00:01:00.530> I<00:01:00.920> went<00:01:01.340> ahead<00:01:01.430> and<00:01:01.580> the

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
basket to be then I went ahead and the

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.429 
basket to be then I went ahead and the
ends<00:01:02.620> took<00:01:04.269> took<00:01:05.269> the<00:01:05.420> one<00:01:05.600> piece<00:01:05.840> and<00:01:06.140> then

00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:06.439 
ends took took the one piece and then

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:09.850 
ends took took the one piece and then
just<00:01:06.680> doubled<00:01:07.009> it<00:01:07.100> back<00:01:07.250> on<00:01:07.490> himself<00:01:08.470> until<00:01:09.470> I

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
just doubled it back on himself until I

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.460 
just doubled it back on himself until I
basically<00:01:10.579> ran<00:01:10.880> out<00:01:11.119> and<00:01:11.450> that's<00:01:12.259> going<00:01:12.409> to

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
basically ran out and that's going to

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.789 
basically ran out and that's going to
give<00:01:12.710> me<00:01:13.000> the<00:01:14.000> beginning<00:01:14.689> of<00:01:14.810> my<00:01:14.990> side<00:01:15.259> and

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:15.799 
give me the beginning of my side and

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:17.289 
give me the beginning of my side and
I've<00:01:16.070> got<00:01:16.250> some<00:01:16.430> additional<00:01:16.610> weaving<00:01:17.180> that

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:17.299 
I've got some additional weaving that

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:18.399 
I've got some additional weaving that
I'm<00:01:17.390> gonna<00:01:17.509> have<00:01:17.659> to<00:01:17.750> do<00:01:17.869> there<00:01:18.049> and<00:01:18.109> I<00:01:18.170> did<00:01:18.319> the

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:18.409 
I'm gonna have to do there and I did the

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:19.840 
I'm gonna have to do there and I did the
same<00:01:18.590> thing<00:01:18.799> on<00:01:18.890> this<00:01:19.009> side<00:01:19.249> and<00:01:19.429> the<00:01:19.520> side<00:01:19.729> on

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
same thing on this side and the side on

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.599 
same thing on this side and the side on
this<00:01:19.969> side<00:01:20.030> and<00:01:20.659> then<00:01:21.140> I'll<00:01:21.649> fold<00:01:22.009> those<00:01:22.249> up

00:01:22.599 --> 00:01:22.609 
this side and then I'll fold those up

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:24.609 
this side and then I'll fold those up
and<00:01:22.789> then<00:01:22.850> take<00:01:23.509> some<00:01:23.719> additional<00:01:23.899> cattails

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619 
and then take some additional cattails

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:27.399 
and then take some additional cattails
and<00:01:24.920> put<00:01:25.189> around<00:01:25.399> it<00:01:25.700> to<00:01:26.179> begin<00:01:26.479> to<00:01:26.659> make<00:01:26.869> the

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 
and put around it to begin to make the

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:44.730 
and put around it to begin to make the
side

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.780 

okay<00:01:45.740> so

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
okay so

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.490 
okay so
basically<00:01:48.790> like<00:01:49.630> I<00:01:49.750> said<00:01:49.930> just<00:01:49.960> a<00:01:50.140> second<00:01:50.409> ago

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
basically like I said just a second ago

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.190 
basically like I said just a second ago
we<00:01:51.159> started<00:01:51.490> with<00:01:51.610> the<00:01:51.700> center<00:01:51.969> of<00:01:52.119> it<00:01:52.240> of<00:01:52.960> this

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
we started with the center of it of this

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.550 
we started with the center of it of this
basket<00:01:53.680> and<00:01:54.539> we<00:01:55.539> basically<00:01:55.750> got<00:01:56.110> to<00:01:56.259> the<00:01:56.350> size

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
basket and we basically got to the size

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.609 
basket and we basically got to the size
that<00:01:56.860> we<00:01:56.920> were<00:01:57.100> looking<00:01:57.250> for<00:01:57.399> and<00:01:58.060> then<00:01:58.780> we

00:01:59.609 --> 00:01:59.619 
that we were looking for and then we

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:04.169 
that we were looking for and then we
took<00:01:59.829> and<00:02:00.100> we<00:02:00.460> did<00:02:00.670> a<00:02:00.939> few<00:02:01.299> rows<00:02:01.829> just<00:02:03.090> where<00:02:04.090> we

00:02:04.169 --> 00:02:04.179 
took and we did a few rows just where we

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:05.969 
took and we did a few rows just where we
wrapped<00:02:04.450> the<00:02:04.990> leaves<00:02:05.229> back<00:02:05.619> around

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
wrapped the leaves back around

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:08.880 
wrapped the leaves back around
themselves<00:02:06.479> to<00:02:07.479> create<00:02:07.960> essentially<00:02:08.440> wings

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
themselves to create essentially wings

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.160 
themselves to create essentially wings
like<00:02:09.640> in<00:02:09.789> a<00:02:09.880> cardboard<00:02:10.149> box<00:02:10.390> if<00:02:10.840> a<00:02:10.929> cardboard

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
like in a cardboard box if a cardboard

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.120 
like in a cardboard box if a cardboard
box<00:02:11.470> was<00:02:11.739> unfolded<00:02:12.340> and<00:02:12.760> then<00:02:13.480> what<00:02:13.630> I<00:02:13.660> did<00:02:13.750> is

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
box was unfolded and then what I did is

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:21.780 
box was unfolded and then what I did is
I<00:02:15.130> started<00:02:15.910> new<00:02:16.900> fresh<00:02:18.930> runs<00:02:20.010> with<00:02:21.010> additional

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
I started new fresh runs with additional

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.880 
I started new fresh runs with additional
leaves<00:02:22.030> and<00:02:22.299> just<00:02:22.930> started<00:02:23.170> braiding<00:02:23.470> them<00:02:23.620> or

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
leaves and just started braiding them or

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.400 
leaves and just started braiding them or
weaving<00:02:24.519> them<00:02:24.760> together<00:02:24.880> and<00:02:25.299> then<00:02:25.930> continued

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
weaving them together and then continued

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.259 
weaving them together and then continued
all<00:02:26.530> the<00:02:26.620> way<00:02:26.709> up<00:02:26.920> and<00:02:27.220> this<00:02:27.489> is<00:02:27.640> the<00:02:27.819> end

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:28.269 
all the way up and this is the end

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:32.280 
all the way up and this is the end
result<00:02:28.540> here<00:02:30.390> got<00:02:31.390> a<00:02:31.420> little<00:02:31.660> integrated

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
result here got a little integrated

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.729 
result here got a little integrated
carrying<00:02:32.680> handle<00:02:33.010> and<00:02:34.260> then<00:02:35.260> we've<00:02:35.410> got<00:02:35.530> just

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
carrying handle and then we've got just

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:38.789 
carrying handle and then we've got just
a<00:02:35.799> flap<00:02:36.069> to<00:02:36.280> put<00:02:36.459> over<00:02:36.580> the<00:02:37.380> foot<00:02:38.380> over<00:02:38.530> the<00:02:38.590> top

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:38.799 
a flap to put over the foot over the top

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:41.370 
a flap to put over the foot over the top
of<00:02:38.829> it<00:02:39.099> to<00:02:39.190> keep<00:02:39.220> stuff<00:02:40.180> from<00:02:40.329> falling<00:02:40.660> out<00:02:40.750> and

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
of it to keep stuff from falling out and

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.500 
of it to keep stuff from falling out and
then<00:02:41.920> I've<00:02:42.549> also<00:02:42.640> kind<00:02:42.910> of<00:02:43.000> fashioned<00:02:43.450> a

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
then I've also kind of fashioned a

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:48.030 
then I've also kind of fashioned a
little<00:02:44.010> pass<00:02:45.010> so<00:02:45.790> to<00:02:45.849> speak<00:02:46.120> where<00:02:47.110> I<00:02:47.440> can<00:02:47.860> take

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
little pass so to speak where I can take

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.940 
little pass so to speak where I can take
the<00:02:48.190> end

00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:58.210 
primitive skill that everybody needs to

00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:02.129 
primitive skill that everybody needs to
know<00:06:58.330> how<00:06:58.599> to<00:06:58.629> do<00:06:58.900> but<00:06:59.800> it<00:07:00.550> certainly<00:07:01.080> is<00:07:02.080> a

00:07:02.129 --> 00:07:02.139 
know how to do but it certainly is a

00:07:02.139 --> 00:07:05.550 
know how to do but it certainly is a
skill<00:07:02.529> that<00:07:02.560> could<00:07:02.919> be<00:07:03.069> useful<00:07:03.249> so<00:07:04.409> give<00:07:05.409> it<00:07:05.469> a

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:05.560 
skill that could be useful so give it a

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:08.129 
skill that could be useful so give it a
shot<00:07:05.770> try<00:07:06.069> sometime<00:07:06.749> you<00:07:07.749> never<00:07:07.840> know<00:07:08.020> when

00:07:08.129 --> 00:07:08.139 
shot try sometime you never know when
