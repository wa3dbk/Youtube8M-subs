00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:13.919 
the charging port and that's really just

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:16.909 
the charging port and that's really just

about it 16 gig white I really do like
what<00:04:17.159> I<00:04:17.190> think<00:04:17.400> it<00:04:17.489> looks<00:04:17.669> nice<00:04:17.880> and<00:04:18.299> there<00:04:18.690> is

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
what I think it looks nice and there is

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:20.240 
what I think it looks nice and there is
the<00:04:19.079> much-talked-about

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
the much-talked-about

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.909 
the much-talked-about
3<00:04:20.669> megapixel<00:04:21.329> camera<00:04:21.719> which<00:04:22.229> is<00:04:22.380> capable<00:04:22.560> of

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 
3 megapixel camera which is capable of

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:26.360 
3 megapixel camera which is capable of

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
30 frames per second video let's compare

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:28.909 
30 frames per second video let's compare
to<00:04:26.760> the<00:04:26.910> iPhone<00:04:27.419> 3G<00:04:28.260> and<00:04:28.290> just<00:04:28.500> cool<00:04:28.680> it<00:04:28.770> looks

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:28.919 
to the iPhone 3G and just cool it looks

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:31.810 
to the iPhone 3G and just cool it looks
like<00:04:29.070> you<00:04:29.160> can<00:04:29.340> even<00:04:29.400> tell<00:04:29.669> a<00:04:29.699> difference<00:04:30.320> and

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:31.820 
like you can even tell a difference and

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:34.670 
like you can even tell a difference and
right<00:04:32.820> next<00:04:32.940> to<00:04:33.090> each<00:04:33.240> other<00:04:33.449> really<00:04:34.169> kind<00:04:34.620> of

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
right next to each other really kind of

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:35.990 
right next to each other really kind of
hard<00:04:34.830> to<00:04:34.949> tell<00:04:35.100> a<00:04:35.130> difference<00:04:35.460> this<00:04:35.639> screen

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
hard to tell a difference this screen

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.270 
hard to tell a difference this screen
looks<00:04:36.479> a<00:04:36.570> little<00:04:36.870> bit<00:04:37.139> darker<00:04:37.560> off<00:04:37.680> than<00:04:38.010> the

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
looks a little bit darker off than the

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.060 
looks a little bit darker off than the
3G<00:04:38.820> but<00:04:39.449> until<00:04:39.720> I<00:04:39.780> flip<00:04:39.930> them<00:04:40.139> over<00:04:40.229> it's<00:04:40.560> quite

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.070 
3G but until I flip them over it's quite

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.430 
3G but until I flip them over it's quite
difficult<00:04:41.340> to<00:04:41.639> tell<00:04:41.970> size-wise<00:04:42.750> they<00:04:43.169> look<00:04:43.320> to

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 
difficult to tell size-wise they look to

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.780 
difficult to tell size-wise they look to
be<00:04:43.620> absolutely<00:04:44.610> identical<00:04:46.400> let's<00:04:47.400> flip<00:04:47.669> them

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:47.790 
be absolutely identical let's flip them

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:49.939 
be absolutely identical let's flip them
over<00:04:47.850> and<00:04:48.000> the<00:04:48.180> reason<00:04:48.330> I<00:04:48.479> got<00:04:48.630> white<00:04:48.930> so<00:04:49.830> when

00:04:49.939 --> 00:04:49.949 
over and the reason I got white so when

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:52.400 
over and the reason I got white so when
these<00:04:50.220> two<00:04:50.280> are<00:04:50.550> next<00:04:50.699> to<00:04:50.820> each<00:04:50.880> other<00:04:51.410> you

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:52.410 
these two are next to each other you

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:57.260 
these two are next to each other you
could<00:04:52.710> tell<00:04:53.250> the<00:04:53.490> difference<00:04:55.520> to<00:04:56.520> be<00:04:56.639> just

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.270 
could tell the difference to be just

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:02.029 
could tell the difference to be just
exactly<00:04:58.190> the<00:04:59.190> same<00:04:59.900> let's<00:05:00.900> compare<00:05:01.320> the<00:05:01.500> 3GS

00:05:02.029 --> 00:05:02.039 
exactly the same let's compare the 3GS

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:03.620 
exactly the same let's compare the 3GS
with<00:05:02.490> some<00:05:02.669> other<00:05:02.850> devices<00:05:03.120> that<00:05:03.300> you<00:05:03.479> guys

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:03.630 
with some other devices that you guys

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:05.350 
with some other devices that you guys
may<00:05:03.840> know<00:05:04.080> you<00:05:04.440> can<00:05:04.620> get<00:05:04.710> a<00:05:04.770> size<00:05:04.979> comparison

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:05.360 
may know you can get a size comparison

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:11.500 
may know you can get a size comparison
here<00:05:06.360> is<00:05:06.539> the<00:05:06.780> Palm<00:05:07.080> Pre<00:05:08.120> certainly<00:05:09.120> smaller

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:11.510 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:15.590 

but<00:05:12.510> much<00:05:12.690> thicker<00:05:13.340> and<00:05:14.340> that's<00:05:15.060> due<00:05:15.330> to<00:05:15.360> the

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:15.600 
but much thicker and that's due to the

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:19.279 
but much thicker and that's due to the
Prius<00:05:15.930> slide<00:05:16.380> off<00:05:16.500> keyboard<00:05:16.710> and<00:05:18.289> another
