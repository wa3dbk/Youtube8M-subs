00:01:34.059 --> 00:01:34.069 
which equals seven hundred GP now they

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:38.169 
which equals seven hundred GP now they
sound<00:01:34.340> GE<00:01:34.789> for<00:01:35.119> about<00:01:35.299> 900<00:01:35.750> GP<00:01:36.530> so<00:01:37.220> i<00:01:37.670> just<00:01:38.000> sold

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:44.119 
about 200 GP margin on each so two

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:48.969 
about 200 GP margin on each so two
hundred<00:01:44.840> times<00:01:45.470> 28<00:01:46.240> g<00:01:47.240> equals<00:01:47.509> a<00:01:47.659> 5.6<00:01:48.350> k<00:01:48.590> margin

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
hundred times 28 g equals a 5.6 k margin

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:52.330 
hundred times 28 g equals a 5.6 k margin
