00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:11.460
 there are very good today we are here in 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.290
 minecraft have another tutorial of this 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.820
 in his lord build today well today 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.980
 perfect for structural der stone 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.539
 very interesting servers quite 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.250
 also very easy to build and it's a 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.840
 door with password 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.369
 yes how it has fit to go is a door with 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.080
 password that works with levers and 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.060
 right now we are going to see it is worth 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.880
 expandable and customizable to the taste of 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.460
 the person and good is this now 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.110
 let's see it and this is worth the door 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.480
 password is now okay 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.640
 open but let's close it and explain 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.290
 its operation is worth with promoting and 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.879
 six levers this is to expand that is 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.309
 I can put the 17 levers I can put 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.050
 a lever a a very foolish series or 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.600
 put three levers to put eight per 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.420
 put 10 17 21 can put the levers 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.550
 that I want is worth it 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.469
 a lever is worth and this door as 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.750
 as perez is closed as it opens 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.640
 for putting the combination that we should 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.559
 to memorize or learn so that it opens 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:06.000
 the door for example I do put this and 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:09.119
 it does not open and it does not and it does not and 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.610
 this is worth it as see all activated 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:14.939
 neither opens is a constant curious 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.830
 and the password is this is to say these 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.689
 first three and this one and how to move the 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:22.710
 door opens up okay if I put one in addition 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:25.050
 it closes if I remove one it closes if not 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.509
 I put one closes that is to say it must be 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.310
 that combination yes or yes is good and 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.990
 well let's go in and here as you can 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.750
 see we have a lever but course this 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.280
 lever closes from inside it's worth and 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.810
 asia is from within although this is the 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.789
 well- placed password does not open 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.619
 decided to put the password that I 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:43.080
 want and it's never going to open because it's 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:46.020
 closed from within it's worth and until I 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:48.569
 again from within the wta does not open 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.520
 ok is a blocking system that is 

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:53.340
 If I'm home and I give him nobody goes to 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.289
 to be able to enter no one is in change if 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.210
 I'm away from home and leave is 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:58.470
 open then you can enter then 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.720
 anyone who knows the contra 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.370
 or discover it because this can be 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.010
 discover then with much patience you 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:06.090
 can discover and well this mechanism 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.950
 as I have done before it is perfect for 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.080
 servers type that you have a plot and 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.360
 you can activate the buttons the 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.980
 levers and clear and a door because no 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.840
 they have to enter your house because they do not 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.270
 You want me to gossip in a bit you can 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.040
 this out and so people who know the 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.680
 password can enter problem of 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.700
 this when you enter must be fast 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.680
 out because if you will not run the 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.940
 password is a small problem 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.410
 what is there but good , nothing happens 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.650
 because it explains the mechanisms that is very 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.690
 simple and this is well worth first of 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.390
 everything as we can observe behind 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.130
 each block there is this system worth is 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.110
 applicant or the rest by the lever 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.910
 turned on is to say when we want that 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.770
 the lever is on, that is, 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:47.430
 the lamp is on there is a behind 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:49.800
 a reston torch is valid and when 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.570
 do not put a powder of reston and 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.610
 this what to put and in this way then 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:55.470
 we connect here we invest it with a 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.720
 inverter believe here and here is the 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.630
 closed system from within that is 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.250
 a piston that when right now is 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.260
 thrown back but when I give it 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.160
 is thrown forward and this block leaves 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.980
 to issue rest 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.960
 this block and stop having it 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.000
 submit to broadcast the signal here 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:15.390
 to say to the door that he is here 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:18.300
 over it is worth fine I had very simple 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:20.430
 very compact and we're going to build it 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:22.350
 ok this tutorial looks like this 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.610
 we will use these materials how to see are 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.950
 extremely always except for the 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.840
 sticky piston because good a ball is 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.460
 line but nothing happens and these are the 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.110
 additional materials say this is 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:33.210
 optional if we want to put it on and if not 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:35.250
 not in this case I used here for 

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:36.750
 make it a little more decorated but 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.070
 when to use them or not in this case I 'm not going 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.960
 to use the clay because it was for 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:41.430
 colors to do it by colors for 

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:44.970
 say a friend with look turns on the 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:46.830
 orange the octopus the pink the yellow and 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.060
 the green seems to be a friend for example 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:50.520
 but if we want we can not put it 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.290
 Okay now let's start doing 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.820
 the mechanism first let's do the 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.770
 door frame that will be here 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:58.050
 It is worth thinking that good you know of 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:00.060
 what you think that the output is 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:01.860
 tell this board this that comes by 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.030
 here this can take you to where 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:04.740
 we want in this case I have put 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.690
 and the door provoked can be a 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:08.310
 hidden door 2 x 2 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:11.310
 a mechanism of this is what we want 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:13.890
 ok is what you want and now 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:15.000
 you have to put a wall the size that 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:15.810
 we want in this case we're going to do it 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.390
 8 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:21.150
 made of 6 here we are going to do it of 8 that 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:25.920
 it's up to here it's worth it and we're going to put the 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:27.480
 levers that are going to be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:30.030
 9 let's do it again since 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:31.980
 we are well worth it and now if we want 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:33.360
 could we decorate it with the play or 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:35.250
 as we want in this case I will put 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.170
 the text lamp above that remains 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.520
 pretty cool and how to see so 

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:40.710
 quick with this lit up with is 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.910
 extinguished is good as how to see now 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.770
 they are many levers is much more 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:46.920
 complicated the combination but there's 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:48.860
 problem now comes the combination vale 

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:51.199
 we put here in block 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:53.539
 this we removed that they have strained and 

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:55.669
 let's put the combination attentive to 

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:58.099
 what do we want them to be 

00:04:55.669 --> 00:05:01.370
 on we are going to make the levers 

00:04:58.099 --> 00:05:02.509
 which will now be installed 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:05.030
 pointing up which are going to 

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:06.590
 be pointing down then we're going to 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:09.760
 when I left arona we are going to make 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:11.950
 be this one 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:15.280
 and these three for example is worth 

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:16.900
 example these are worth we can not change 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:18.760
 then when we finish we change it for 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:20.560
 that you see is worth here we put some blocks 

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:22.030
 here and now everything else is filled 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:23.740
 with remains all the spaces that there are 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:25.450
 here we fill it with remains this here 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:28.330
 I do not eat because the torch is all 

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:29.710
 we fill it with rest it's worth it now 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:31.270
 I'm going to make the mechanism that you're going to see 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:34.180
 in the door that I am going to put 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:36.490
 well and so it's good here we put a 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:38.580
 torch and here we put remains that 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:40.810
 attending to the making mechanism for 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:42.190
 block it from within here we are going to 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:44.320
 put a pointing gun does it already worth 

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:46.270
 this will stretch we remove the block that 

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:47.920
 there's here underneath it's worth as this one 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:50.440
 this block is thrown away we remove it for 

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:52.710
 that can be easily extended and what 

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:55.740
 we throw back 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:58.080
 and now this this block here does not 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:59.610
 So put this on like this but this 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.560
 block do not put that if not this 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:04.350
 loads everything that gives you there and does not 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:08.280
 we want that to happen that is worth fine let's 

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:09.840
 finish this now around here will come out the 

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:13.200
 rest wrong so let's put here a 

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:15.450
 repeater uy uy uy to the memory scheme 

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:18.510
 you have forgot the repeater guys 

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:20.010
 I'm sorry and this we put it like that and this 

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:22.820
 is plowing already at the door is well worth 

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:22.820
 we can cover this already 

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:28.600
 u and cap 

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:31.120
 I only remember that you do not put it and 

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:34.240
 the door is ready how to see was this 

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:36.500
 let's check this and these three 

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:38.810
 end 

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:41.150
 and how to move opens the door if not 

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:43.670
 I put here one closes if I put here 

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:45.920
 one closes in case I remove this one 

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:48.140
 close only that combination is valid 

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:50.750
 now we are going to change it a lot 

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:55.520
 let's see let's do that instead of instead 

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:56.930
 of this be this here is worth now how 

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:59.450
 move is closed but when I put 

00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:01.070
 it opens because he has modified and 

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:04.550
 if I want it to be also for example 

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:07.180
 these four these two here 

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:10.100
 we add and until these two are not 

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:11.780
 added does not open is to remember 

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:13.669
 those with the torch are those who 

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:15.410
 they will be activated remember that and 

00:07:13.669 --> 00:07:17.000
 is therefore to do all this something that 

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:20.270
 you want or as small as you want 

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:23.510
 ok and good as we can see the 

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:25.280
 piston you only hear the piston only you 

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:27.260
 listen when the door opens or 

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:29.240
