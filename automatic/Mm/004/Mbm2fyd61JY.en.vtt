application<00:01:14.939> basically<00:01:15.150> what<00:01:15.570> this

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
application basically what this

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.990 
application basically what this
application<00:01:16.050> does<00:01:16.560> is<00:01:16.800> it<00:01:17.250> tracks<00:01:17.580> from<00:01:17.760> what

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
application does is it tracks from what

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.730 
application does is it tracks from what
application<00:01:18.810> citizens<00:01:19.140> you<00:01:19.260> actually

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
application citizens you actually

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.190 
application citizens you actually
install<00:01:20.280> so<00:01:20.970> it<00:01:21.060> can<00:01:21.180> get<00:01:21.360> you<00:01:21.570> those<00:01:21.750> points

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
install so it can get you those points

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.100 
install so it can get you those points
so<00:01:22.260> it's<00:01:22.440> very<00:01:22.560> necessary<00:01:23.450> step<00:01:24.450> so<00:01:24.840> don't

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
so it's very necessary step so don't

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.290 
so it's very necessary step so don't
skip<00:01:25.500> it<00:01:25.530> it<00:01:25.860> also<00:01:26.130> gives<00:01:26.520> you<00:01:26.730> five<00:01:27.000> hundred

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:27.300 
skip it it also gives you five hundred

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.660 
skip it it also gives you five hundred
nana<00:01:28.080> points<00:01:28.590> once<00:01:28.890> you<00:01:29.040> do<00:01:29.250> this<00:01:29.400> for<00:01:29.580> the

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
first time so going back into hit

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.980 
first time so going back into hit
continue<00:01:34.770> for<00:01:35.220> this<00:01:35.430> part<00:01:36.300> of<00:01:36.390> it<00:01:36.510> basically

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
continue for this part of it basically
