00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.439
 But where does everyone come here is easy? 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.350
 talk like this everybody likes very much 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.449
 carlucci likes opal and the name paulo 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.980
 it would be a cultural fusion, it is not so 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.539
 automatically now also follows this 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.820
 same line of the mix sequence 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.920
 cultural and that is why he named paulo 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.440
 but you have an old car, not any 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.050
 there is not yet more of me talking in a 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:40.860
 short and direct you went 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:45.629
 words but the best is what the legend says 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:47.219
 that renato ran here for sure he 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.140
 asked the subtitles that is not 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:53.579
 doing nothing at the moment she drives 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:57.870
 Thus, they summarize the history of 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:01:00.449
 car named the band pride 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.770
 with his car is measured by the 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.710
 smile 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:06.610
 is a commodore 91 of the latest models of 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.400
 bullet line 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.740
 such a surrounding wraparound bumper 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.550
 it's because he does the same design as the 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.550
 shock 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:17.350
 following the lateral one with the borrachÃµes 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:19.870
 deposit 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:24.520
 it does not have the wind break is like the 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:27.310
 others it is an entire glass and has the 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.770
 flashlight and a single flashlight are 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:33.780
 here is a rear applique where the nozzle 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.780
 of the tank is hidden here 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:40.630
 the opal was the first touring car 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.680
 of gm in brazil released in 68 is to try 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.960
 regional 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.240
 it was born from a combination of 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.670
 body of the tongue the pawn and the 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:53.790
 mechanical one speaks 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.790
 hence the name or speech in 4 or 6 cylinders 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.120
 times are bullets 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:01.090
 This is 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:02.980
 super sport sportsmanship associated with 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.770
 four-speed gear shift lever with 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:08.670
 floor couplings more accurate to give 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:13.510
 a gain in the engine 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:19.290
 the steering wheel of three cosmic rays 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:19.290
 individual wheels painting with bands 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:26.160
 agent to embark on the retro wave that 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:26.160
 would be bali hai 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.470
 the drawings are of Eduard who so much 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.500
 closeness to the collection of brother took 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:37.150
 I like the thing and became a designer 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.940
 automobiles 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:42.160
 In this case the challenge is to find the 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.290
 balance to modernize the car 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.200
 that he loses his identity for example 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.070
 the 1970s models what needs to be 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.900
 sustained 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:56.110
 I think basically keeping the lighthouse 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:03:00.250
 round straight ahead 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:03.010
 this animal some straight bond in the hood and 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:05.880
 It is also this kind of bond of 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.690
 is also very characteristic of paulo 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.459
 at the rear 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.870
 I think everyone who likes to 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:12.870
 opal keepsake flashlight 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:18.549
 now in the major 1980s model 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:20.459
 characteristics of speech are lateral to the 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:25.719
 door without column on the rear window 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:27.909
 tilting and identifying opal is the 

00:03:25.719 --> 00:03:32.950
 lateral waistline line that she makes a 

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:37.810
 curve and I a crease it goes down 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:39.760
 so it gives the feeling of muscle and looks 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:43.510
 the face when the line 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:45.430
 the current design now asks if it were 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.540
 to choose to put it new and the 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.180
 old 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:51.760
 there the Eduardo who has the greatest firmness in 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:58.439
 stroke softens the heart 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:58.439
 if I could get 2 to 1
