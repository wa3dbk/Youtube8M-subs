the experiment about to begin has three
stages<00:02:41.940> in<00:02:42.450> which<00:02:42.959> the<00:02:43.110> Corporal<00:02:43.620> will<00:02:43.739> be<00:02:43.830> set

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
stages in which the Corporal will be set

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:46.039 
stages in which the Corporal will be set
on<00:02:44.190> the<00:02:44.310> ground<00:02:44.340> without<00:02:44.849> moving<00:02:45.420> a<00:02:45.510> muscle<00:02:45.720> of

on the ground without moving a muscle of

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:49.190 
on the ground without moving a muscle of
his<00:02:46.080> own

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
this is it with a flip of a switch he's

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.830 
this is it with a flip of a switch he's

awesome<00:03:00.270> place<00:03:00.480> to

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
awesome place to

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.110 
awesome place to

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
and he floats easily down to a safe

and he floats easily down to a safe
