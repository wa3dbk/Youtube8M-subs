 hello and welcome to 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.560
 press conference after the third league 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:31.090
 home game of sg dynamo dresden against 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.270
 the sg sonnenhof groÃŸaspach 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:35.620
 the game ended with 0 to 1 I greet 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.090
 all yesterday in the premises of the 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.220
 stadion dresden and the two coaches 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.690
 this next to me from our guest 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.000
 quiet talk and our chef trainer 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.640
 Peter Nemeth The first word is like 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.800
 always the guest around as her conclusion 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.800
 snatched away after the 2 1 away win 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.420
 first a huge compliment to mine 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.850
 guys 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.800
 I think that we have a very clear one 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.180
 plan we knew that dynamo 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.910
 dresden on wednesday on tuesday 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.350
 game had in the dfb cup and we wanted 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.580
 that they let off steam and then just 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.280
 again and again with needle sticks 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:11.290
 counter to success with ours 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.820
 quick tips in said first 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.610
 Half time already very well done there 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.140
 we have some some really good ones 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:20.380
 We unfortunately do not want to 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.670
 could accomplish because 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.440
 Of course, with goalkeeper in the gate was 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.119
 with Patrick Wiegers same class 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.819
 class performance delivered today 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:29.380
 laws has kept good balls and when 

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:31.420
 you then with 0 0 in the break is indeed 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.520
 Clear that we keep cool head 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.050
 It had to be logical too 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.720
 consequence that dynamo sometime with 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:39.100
 the forces will diminish even more 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.780
 and then we just have to be there 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.030
 Nevertheless , we wanted to continue to be active 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.410
 we wanted the half of ours extremely well 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.300
 we wanted to defend permanent 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:47.470
 put pressure on the opponent we exercise 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.440
 Always wanted to be in excess of ball 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.810
 his and my team has 100 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.560
 percent implemented 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.270
 that, of course, a bit too 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.709
 luck I was there I think there was 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.849
 the first so a two situations where 

00:01:56.709 --> 00:01:59.020
 also the names or lead 

00:01:57.849 --> 00:02:01.090
 can that was very annoying for us 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.280
 but I think that we are in the end 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:06.490
 winner of the game absolutely deserved 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.470
 were also in front of a great backdrop 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:11.650
 and that was fun and animal fun 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.569
 I have to say it again 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.340
 big greetings to the dynamo fans and also 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:17.830
 especially to our traveling fans 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.620
 Never believed such a large number 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:23.170
 and during the promotion game in 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.640
 wolfsburg and it just makes you animal 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.930
 fun my boys have fun I made 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.860
 I think that's what you saw and that's why 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.260
 big compliment 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.209

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.240

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:34.190
 dortmund and there would be 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:37.760

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:03.440
 the opponent was sparkling the opponent was 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:05.030
 movable and big mouth had easy 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.520
 felt what we expect 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:09.560
 Compact in the defensive and disorder 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.240
 forward and we have in this game 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.490
 no medium found 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:16.250
 to get ahead but it was too 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:19.070
 slow and also our individual 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:21.440
