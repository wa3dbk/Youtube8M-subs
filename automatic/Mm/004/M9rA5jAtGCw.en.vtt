gonna<00:00:57.910> fast<00:00:58.150> forward<00:00:58.240> a<00:00:58.420> little<00:00:58.540> bit<00:00:58.660> just

00:00:58.890 --> 00:00:58.900 
gonna fast forward a little bit just

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.700 
gonna fast forward a little bit just
because<00:00:58.990> the<00:00:59.260> ending<00:00:59.530> is<00:00:59.620> kind<00:00:59.829> of<00:00:59.890> lame

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
because the ending is kind of lame

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.200 
because the ending is kind of lame
because<00:01:02.710> then<00:01:02.860> the<00:01:03.280> pulser<00:01:03.640> drops<00:01:03.940> or

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.210 
because then the pulser drops or

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.420 
because then the pulser drops or
something<00:01:04.479> like<00:01:04.570> that<00:01:06.000> yay<00:01:07.000> fast<00:01:07.689> motion

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
the end do you need my only friend Veon

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
the end do you need my only friend Veon
yeah<00:02:24.660> this<00:02:24.840> would<00:02:24.960> need<00:02:25.050> to<00:02:25.110> fire<00:02:25.350> a<00:02:25.380> little

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
yeah this would need to fire a little

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.760 
yeah this would need to fire a little
bit<00:02:25.770> more

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.490 

yeah<00:02:31.770> well<00:02:32.040> I'm<00:02:32.099> gonna<00:02:32.190> spam<00:02:32.810> m10<00:02:33.810> oh<00:02:34.110> that's

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
another different m10 who's gonna say I

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:39.080 
another different m10 who's gonna say I
could<00:02:36.780> go<00:02:36.900> camo<00:02:37.440> I<00:02:37.650> know<00:02:38.160> the<00:02:38.459> yang<00:02:38.670> Panther

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
could go camo I know the yang Panther

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.360 
could go camo I know the yang Panther
can<00:02:39.300> I<00:02:39.360> think<00:02:39.989> that<00:02:40.080> may<00:02:40.170> be<00:02:40.200> a<00:02:40.319> different<00:02:40.739> mod

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
can I think that may be a different mod

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:51.480 
can I think that may be a different mod
I'm<00:02:41.610> thinking<00:02:41.880> of

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:51.490 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:55.020 

and<00:02:52.090> this<00:02:52.330> is<00:02:52.480> the<00:02:52.600> end<00:02:53.520> cuz<00:02:54.520> I<00:02:54.580> think<00:02:54.760> they<00:02:54.850> see

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
and this is the end cuz I think they see

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:56.370 
and this is the end cuz I think they see
how<00:02:55.120> many<00:02:55.330> tanks<00:02:55.600> and<00:02:55.870> they<00:02:55.930> don't<00:02:56.110> have<00:02:56.230> the

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
how many tanks and they don't have the

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.000 
how many tanks and they don't have the
infantry<00:02:56.800> to<00:02:56.890> hold<00:02:57.100> them<00:02:57.250> off<00:02:58.860> except<00:02:59.860> this

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
infantry to hold them off except this

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:08.550 
infantry to hold them off except this
hush<00:03:00.550> dude<00:03:00.940> yay<00:03:01.930> Stood<00:03:02.410> Still<00:03:02.880> deploy<00:03:03.880> now

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.220 

I<00:03:08.620> hate<00:03:09.340> this<00:03:09.489> thing<00:03:09.569> like<00:03:10.569> it<00:03:10.750> fires<00:03:10.930> one

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:32.250 

I<00:03:30.060> like<00:03:31.060> the<00:03:31.180> design<00:03:31.300> of<00:03:31.510> this<00:03:31.690> tank<00:03:31.959> it<00:03:32.110> looks

awesome<00:03:32.410> for<00:03:32.890> some<00:03:33.040> reason

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:37.610 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:41.180 

some<00:03:38.610> more<00:03:38.790> airborne<00:03:39.270> attacks<00:03:40.190> striping
