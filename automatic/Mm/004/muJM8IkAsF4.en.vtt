00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 hello youtube friends below is 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:07.230
 teach a little magic trick and to 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.660
 we only need it 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.700
 a deck of cards the first thing we have 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.990
 what to do is give the deck of cards to 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:19.250
 spectator to shuffle 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:22.130
 well already mixed will return the mallet 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:25.150
 and we will ask that we will pass 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:27.710
 our finger and he will tell us where to stop 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:32.000
 We pass our finger the viewer says 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:34.809
 enough and we will deliver the letter without 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.809
 we see her 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:44.760
 that you have selected well we return it to 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:47.420
 put the mallet and we ask you again 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.420
 reshuffle 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.380
 well you have already done this 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:56.290
 We'll cut in half and we'll tell you 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:59.650
 please place the letter above 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:02.830
 of the deck this will help us to have 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:05.330
 reference a guide letter in this case 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:07.520
 is the 5 of spades 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:10.850
 we place it on top of the letter of 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.800
 spectator and we do what they are called 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:18.460
 false cuts 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:18.460
 3 and we raise in the same order 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:27.970
 already having all this we will return the mallet 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:30.550
 and we will tell the viewer that his letter 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:33.400
 is found through the middle of the deck 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:35.380
 we know where it is 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.740
 but this will serve us for 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:41.640
 see which letters the viewer 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.640
 looking for our guide letter 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:50.870
 as we can see here is our letter 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.490
 guide and then that tells us that the 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:57.740
 letter from the viewer is the one that 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:59.450
 We found below would still good 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.330
 we say to the viewer here you go 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:05.500
 letter let's do some magic and what 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.500
 what we have to do is take 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:11.920
 leave the penultimate viewer's letter 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:15.370
 letter and make the cut in this way 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:17.470
 when we open the deck 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.099
 we will see the spectator's letter and 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.099
 we will take 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:27.220
 one before leaving a letter before the 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:30.770
 spectator we cut and we say to the 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.950
 viewer this is your letter no 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:36.190
 this is your letter 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:38.620
 not well let's do something we're going to 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:41.379
 remove it from the middle of the deck and what 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.520
 we have to do with these fingers is 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:45.770
 Push 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:49.160
 the letter 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:51.740
 the last letter and pull 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:55.270
 the viewer's letter being careful 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:58.510
 that your arm covers 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:01.180
 the letter that you are pushing and so the 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.680
 viewer will be able to see your good letter 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.510
