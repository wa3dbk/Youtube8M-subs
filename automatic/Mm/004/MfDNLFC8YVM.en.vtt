00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.480
 Healthy wholemeal rolls with us today 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:15.809
 Welcome to fit food style 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.859
 Today we show you wholegrain healthy 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.539
 quark breaks 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.180
 what is the difference to the normal 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:24.180
 buns we use wholegrain flour 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.369
 either spelled wholegrain bread wholegrain flour 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.010
 unlike wheat flour we have 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.400
 therefore many high quality 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.710
 carbohydrates in it 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.120
 the buns saturate much longer 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.030
 and are much healthier than normal 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:39.030
 Wheat buns further advantage or 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.430
 the difference is that we use quark 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.160
 and no typical yeast dough 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.110
 thus we save us the go 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.210
 let the yeast dough and enormous amount 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.649
 time we can prepare the dough and 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.660
 then the rolls come directly 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.449
 in the oven and are only a short time 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:59.070
 finished later much fun in the video today 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:04.070
 we need baking powder 1 wholegrain flour 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:09.950
 I suppose this morning then follows 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:14.250
 Quark the macaques of course an egg 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:17.820
 salt and on the rolls you can to 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.830
 example living fashion season make or 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.110
 oatmeal or pumpkin seeds or 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.600
 which we really like before we go with the 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:28.460
 The oven will start dough on 190 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.460
 grad upper and lower heat held 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.740
 First, the egg is opened 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:56.470
 there comes then we give a teaspoon 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:59.520
 Add the salt and the flour 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.520
 Good last of the pact 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.200
 to prepare dough from the ingredients a 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:07.600
 Could either be in the kitchen machine 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.020
 a hand mixer or your hands 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.020
 used 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.890
 the dough will be eight of the same size 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:19.540
 Buns shaped it to some extent 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.870
 could get even 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:27.269
 best to halve dough over again 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:27.269
 and then it gets reasonably even 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.220
 to keep the cows on the bun 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.630
 need her buns a bit 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.980
 moist I take here for such a 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:47.420
 but spray bottle could also be one 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.420
 paint or know what to capture 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:16.470
 20 minutes into the preheated 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:20.300
 oven the rolls are lightly browned 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.300
 we are ready and can get out of the oven 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:29.000
 Euro
