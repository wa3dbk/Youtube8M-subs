00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:12.820
 I'll count 69 minutes 

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:12.820
 to achieve the ski goal and text 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:27.240

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:32.970
 passive because he liked to proceed and 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.970
 third 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:43.989
 at 11 degrees a granddaughter we see here 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.989
 that we vote them 12 million 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.370
 different 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.649
 a cheesy year does not reach all this 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:07.390
 disaster equally 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.390
 and this one 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.430
 we have not retaken the competition that 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:38.289
 It's never easy after the break 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:41.799

 touch my great overflow come many 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:51.159
 players with many matches with many 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:55.740
 minutes we do not train together you can not 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:59.909
 prepare the next match if that 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.909
 is as anxious and creative 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.840
 but well the team has made a 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.549
 tremendous effort to get the 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.039
 victory get the three points I think 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:10.450
 that the first part we had 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.750
 possibility of having gone with more advantage 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.750
 to the marker 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.980
 since they were there I have some balls 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:20.019
 even estranged lawyers your vision 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.760
 smells of burning camps and then the second 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:23.860
 part or the team has defended well 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.140
 I was tired I did not have freshness anymore 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.849
 come out in attack but good has defended 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.099
 pretty organized and we've got 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:33.660
 the three most important points also 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:33.660
 the faces decisions 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:17.469
 and we separated elements 25 this 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:20.540
 happened because I would remember if 

00:03:17.469 --> 00:03:22.549
 we remember the match with him with the 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.769
 slovan the tied and we the 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:26.599
 last 20 minutes we made an effort 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:29.150
 great to trace the game the day 

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:30.319
 from the government to the same but I'm not 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.500
 nothing agrees the team makes a 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:34.849
 tremendous effort to endure perfect 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.219
 at 90 minutes what happens that the 

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:39.530
 opposing team also plays and when 

00:03:37.219 --> 00:03:43.239
 is lost by logically bid and a 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.239
 once they get it right and others do not 

00:03:57.159 --> 00:04:02.290

 Rags speak English 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:46.630
 and above all I think that the fourth 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:50.080
 the referee understood me perfectly when 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:51.450
 I talked to him a little bit was very rigorous 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.880
 with the faults that we were suffering 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:57.880
 he had called us several faults that I 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:59.380
 I think unfairly and I think that I 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:01.180
 I was measuring with the same resolve 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:03.450
