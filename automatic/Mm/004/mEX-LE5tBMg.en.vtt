00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
obviously the magic world one is already

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.709 
obviously the magic world one is already
taken<00:00:55.110> for<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.770> magic<00:00:55.949> world<00:00:56.250> deck<00:00:56.719> and

dragon world i built the Dragon Knight
deck<00:01:02.600> earlier<00:01:03.600> actually<00:01:03.780> I<00:01:03.960> gave<00:01:04.110> it<00:01:04.199> to<00:01:04.229> a

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
deck earlier actually I gave it to a

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.479 
deck earlier actually I gave it to a
friend<00:01:04.350> so<00:01:04.799> I<00:01:04.830> don't<00:01:05.070> actually<00:01:05.220> have<00:01:05.460> that

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
friend so I don't actually have that

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.539 
friend so I don't actually have that
decade<00:01:05.880> I'm<00:01:06.810> only<00:01:06.960> really<00:01:07.229> rolling<00:01:07.740> danger

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
decade I'm only really rolling danger

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.609 
decade I'm only really rolling danger
world<00:01:08.760> magic<00:01:09.180> world<00:01:09.570> and<00:01:09.900> I<00:01:09.990> guess<00:01:10.229> in<00:01:10.530> the

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
world magic world and I guess in the

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.050 
world magic world and I guess in the
case<00:01:10.770> of<00:01:10.799> generic<00:01:11.220> I<00:01:11.310> have<00:01:11.430> a<00:01:11.460> generic<00:01:11.850> deck

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
case of generic I have a generic deck

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.469 
case of generic I have a generic deck
here<00:01:12.680> so<00:01:13.680> anyway<00:01:13.979> let's<00:01:14.220> go<00:01:14.340> on<00:01:14.460> to<00:01:14.909> a<00:01:14.939> generic

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
here so anyway let's go on to a generic

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.539 
here so anyway let's go on to a generic
it's<00:01:16.140> technically<00:01:16.680> it's<00:01:17.100> considered<00:01:17.520> a

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
it's technically it's considered a

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.249 
it's technically it's considered a
danger<00:01:17.939> world<00:01:18.150> deck<00:01:18.330> because<00:01:18.960> it's<00:01:19.110> dangerous

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
danger world deck because it's dangerous

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.600 
danger world deck because it's dangerous
lag<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:20.509> but<00:01:21.509> it<00:01:21.750> is<00:01:21.990> at<00:01:22.710> heart<00:01:23.100> it's<00:01:23.340> supposed

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
lag and but it is at heart it's supposed

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.719 
lag and but it is at heart it's supposed
to<00:01:23.670> be<00:01:23.820> a<00:01:24.000> generic<00:01:24.540> deck<00:01:24.780> so<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.409> Buddy<00:01:25.729> for

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
to be a generic deck so the Buddy for

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.980 
to be a generic deck so the Buddy for
the<00:01:26.820> deck<00:01:27.030> is<00:01:27.299> a<00:01:27.360> TAC<00:01:27.780> unit<00:01:28.229> flying<00:01:28.530> Bishop<00:01:29.009> as

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
the deck is a TAC unit flying Bishop as

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.870 
the deck is a TAC unit flying Bishop as
you'll<00:01:30.990> see<00:01:31.259> interesting<00:01:32.220> thing<00:01:32.579> about<00:01:32.610> the

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
you'll see interesting thing about the

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.080 
you'll see interesting thing about the
current<00:01:33.380> generic<00:01:34.380> archetype<00:01:34.979> is<00:01:35.250> they<00:01:35.939> are

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
current generic archetype is they are

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.649 
current generic archetype is they are
based<00:01:36.270> off<00:01:36.450> of<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.630> chess<00:01:36.960> pieces<00:01:38.420> so<00:01:39.420> for

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
based off of the chess pieces so for

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.550 
based off of the chess pieces so for
size<00:01:39.869> 3<00:01:40.650> we<00:01:41.100> have<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.970> generic<00:01:42.299> size<00:01:42.479> 3<00:01:42.869> King

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
size 3 we have the generic size 3 King

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.190 
size 3 we have the generic size 3 King
the<00:01:43.710> Dominator<00:01:44.100> he<00:01:44.369> is<00:01:44.460> a<00:01:44.520> rare<00:01:44.790> and<00:01:44.820> set<00:01:45.329> one

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200

for<00:01:49.200> size<00:01:49.380> two<00:01:49.799> we<00:01:50.310> have<00:01:50.579> two<00:01:51.030> of<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.930> uncommon

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:52.549 
for size two we have two of the uncommon

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:55.480 
for size two we have two of the uncommon
control<00:01:53.549> unit<00:01:53.850> suppression<00:01:54.240> Queen<00:01:54.509> um

ideally<00:01:56.490> I<00:01:56.880> would<00:01:57.000> need<00:01:57.390> two<00:01:57.750> more<00:01:57.990> of<00:01:58.110> these

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
ideally I would need two more of these

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.499 
ideally I would need two more of these
if<00:01:58.619> I<00:01:58.829> wanted<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.250> deck<00:01:59.460> to<00:01:59.820> be<00:02:00.149> a<00:02:00.180> little<00:02:00.390> bit

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
if I wanted the deck to be a little bit

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.510 
if I wanted the deck to be a little bit
more<00:02:00.630> consistent<00:02:01.200> in<00:02:01.649> order<00:02:02.100> to<00:02:02.189> their<00:02:02.340> impact

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
more consistent in order to their impact

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.540 
more consistent in order to their impact
but<00:02:05.520> unfortunately<00:02:06.210> that's<00:02:06.360> all<00:02:06.509> I<00:02:06.570> have<00:02:06.899> and

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.550 
but unfortunately that's all I have and

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
opponent any damage I really think that

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:30.530 
opponent any damage I really think that
if<00:03:29.519> they<00:03:29.609> were<00:03:29.669> going<00:03:29.790> to<00:03:29.849> do<00:03:30.060> that<00:03:30.239> they

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
if they were going to do that they

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:31.879 
if they were going to do that they
should<00:03:30.720> have<00:03:30.810> made<00:03:30.989> this<00:03:31.139> a<00:03:31.199> size<00:03:31.500> zero

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:31.889 
should have made this a size zero

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:38.089 
should have made this a size zero
instead<00:03:32.220> of<00:03:32.370> a<00:03:32.400> size<00:03:32.579> one<00:03:36.019> next<00:03:37.019> attack<00:03:37.769> unit

instead of a size one next attack unit
flying<00:03:38.340> bishop<00:03:38.760> this<00:03:39.000> is<00:03:39.150> the<00:03:39.269> buddy<00:03:39.480> so

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260
