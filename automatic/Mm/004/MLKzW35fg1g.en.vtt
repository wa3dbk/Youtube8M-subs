00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:21.250 
perhaps seem to like to make it sound a

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:23.160 
perhaps seem to like to make it sound a
lot<00:00:21.400> different<00:00:21.939> it<00:00:22.060> was<00:00:22.180> all<00:00:22.330> like<00:00:22.599> robotic

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:23.170 
lot different it was all like robotic

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.070 
lot different it was all like robotic
and<00:00:23.410> staticky<00:00:24.160> and<00:00:24.279> weird<00:00:24.519> and<00:00:24.779> so<00:00:25.779> I'm<00:00:25.869> using

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:26.080 
and staticky and weird and so I'm using

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.570 
and staticky and weird and so I'm using
just<00:00:26.349> the<00:00:26.410> default<00:00:26.590> sound<00:00:27.039> recorded<00:00:27.460> that

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:27.580 
just the default sound recorded that

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.970 
just the default sound recorded that
comes<00:00:27.730> on<00:00:27.880> windows<00:00:28.150> 7<00:00:28.330> and<00:00:28.599> it<00:00:28.810> sounds<00:00:29.259> much

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:29.980 
comes on windows 7 and it sounds much

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:31.769 
comes on windows 7 and it sounds much
much<00:00:30.220> better<00:00:30.429> so<00:00:30.820> hopefully<00:00:31.300> on<00:00:31.480> your<00:00:31.630> guys

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:31.779 
much better so hopefully on your guys

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:35.580 
much better so hopefully on your guys
decided<00:00:32.169> uh<00:00:32.469> it's<00:00:33.219> better<00:00:33.489> um<00:00:34.320> what's<00:00:35.320> called

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:35.590 
decided uh it's better um what's called

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.040 
decided uh it's better um what's called
uh<00:00:35.829> the<00:00:36.239> background<00:00:37.239> gameplay<00:00:37.660> I<00:00:37.690> really

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.070 
pretty much what i'm doing now so we're
gonna<00:01:12.910> switch<00:01:13.120> over<00:01:13.210> to<00:01:13.330> the<00:01:13.510> second<00:01:13.810> mode<00:01:13.930> so

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.080 
gonna switch over to the second mode so

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.010 
gonna switch over to the second mode so
you<00:01:14.110> can<00:01:14.350> hear<00:01:14.560> it<00:01:14.760> just<00:01:15.760> give<00:01:16.000> me<00:01:16.030> a<00:01:16.180> sec<00:01:16.720> all

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
you can hear it just give me a sec all

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.380 
you can hear it just give me a sec all
right<00:01:17.740> so<00:01:18.070> I<00:01:18.100> we<00:01:18.520> are<00:01:18.640> on<00:01:18.730> the<00:01:18.820> second<00:01:19.120> mode<00:01:19.240> you

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 
right so I we are on the second mode you

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.680 
right so I we are on the second mode you
can<00:01:19.420> probably<00:01:19.780> tell<00:01:20.050> the<00:01:20.410> I<00:01:20.440> sound<00:01:20.830> quieter

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:21.690

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.330 
can probably tell the I sound quieter
this<00:01:22.690> is<00:01:22.930> for<00:01:23.140> pretty<00:01:23.320> much<00:01:23.380> music<00:01:24.040> and

whatnot<00:01:24.670> anything<00:01:25.150> louder<00:01:25.390> i<00:01:25.600> think<00:01:25.780> i<00:01:25.840> might

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
whatnot anything louder i think i might

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.070 
whatnot anything louder i think i might
have<00:01:26.080> said<00:01:26.110> that<00:01:26.350> maybe<00:01:26.560> not<00:01:26.770> so<00:01:27.520> um<00:01:27.790> i<00:01:28.090> will
