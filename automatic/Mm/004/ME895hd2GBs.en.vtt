00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.360
 The best of greetings from the modest cuisine 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.360
 in this section we have a beautiful recipe for catering 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.080
 we have a donut recipe; We will learn the production of "Basma Cake" 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.320
 But if you want to have a look at the necessary materials before 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.600
 1 pack of quick yeast 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.160
 1 cup yogurt 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.920
 1 big tea cup with water 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.680
 1 egg white 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.040
 1 teaspoon salt 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.800
 and as much flour as possible 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.200
 for inside; 3 tablespoons of butter 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.960
 half mold white cheese 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.600
 For the above; 1 egg yolk 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.200
 yes sir, we now know the necessary supplies for the donut 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.200
 let's just start making 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.200
 Firstly, we mix our quick yeast with some flour 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.880
 and transfer to kneading bowl 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.120
 on the juice ... 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.480
 salt... 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.520
 yogurt ... 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.600
 oil... 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.800
 1 piece of egg white ... 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.440
 we add a little after adding 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.400
 and until it becomes a non-sticky medium dough. 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.400
 knead by adding flour 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.640
 our dough was very nice 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.840
 We'll have a little flour 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.160
 Cover the cover 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.680
 and rest for 1 hour 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.680
 1 hour later 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.000
 Yes, sir, our dough has been listened to, a lot of bubbling 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 let's open it now 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.280
 Let's take our hand from where it is light flouring 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.240
 Let's turn upside down like this. 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.560
 take our machine 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:54.840
 and divide it in half 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.320
 let's roll it as a big cloth 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.880
 we sprinkle some flour under 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.360
 we spread some flour on 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:20.400
 with rollers, not too rounded, 1 inch thick 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:37.240
 now we melt from the butter and melt slightly 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.240
 and brushing 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:49.160
 now crumbled cheese 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:03.480
 you're making a roll so it won't be too tight, so it won't be too loose 

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.960
 in this way we made a regular roll 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:23.200
 cut the roll with the knife at the thickness of the thumb 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.320
 You know the name of our donut 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:34.280
 this way we will come up and push 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:38.040
 greasy paper 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.080
 we will prepare the other pulp in the same way 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.080
 after placing our last donut ... 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:50.320
 water-mixed egg yolk 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:57.760
 in the meantime we started heating our oven at 190 degrees 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:00.240
 time to meet now 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.240
 25 minutes later 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.520
 Our Printed Donuts 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.520
 We cooked it at 190 degrees for 25 minutes. 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.880
 it has a beautiful color, it has a nice scent, of course you can't smell it 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:21.560
 now we can offer a nice tea service 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:26.600
 Modest Flavors in the kitchen in the bub ... 

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:31.000
 we shared a recipe for a different donut. 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.920
 I would like you to try and remember us as soon as possible, sir 

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:37.240
 goodbye...
