now<00:00:54.120> hopefully<00:00:54.510> this<00:00:54.629> doesn't<00:00:54.809> happen<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.140> me

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
now hopefully this doesn't happen to me

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.889 
now hopefully this doesn't happen to me
because<00:00:55.469> my<00:00:55.829> channel<00:00:56.250> really<00:00:57.059> really<00:00:57.420> depends

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
because my channel really really depends

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.510 
because my channel really really depends
on<00:00:57.989> it<00:00:58.170> so<00:00:58.530> let's<00:00:58.710> hope<00:00:58.829> I<00:00:58.920> don't<00:00:58.980> run<00:00:59.219> into<00:00:59.430> any

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
on it so let's hope I don't run into any

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.920 
on it so let's hope I don't run into any
problems<00:00:59.760> with<00:01:00.059> that<00:01:00.090> graphics<00:01:00.539> card<00:01:00.750> and

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
problems with that graphics card and

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.840 
problems with that graphics card and
let's<00:01:01.140> hope<00:01:01.289> if<00:01:01.410> I<00:01:01.500> do<00:01:01.559> I'll<00:01:02.309> get<00:01:02.520> it<00:01:02.640> resolved

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
let's hope if I do I'll get it resolved
