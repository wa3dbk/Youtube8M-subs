00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
what I do but it's fine this is

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.470 
what I do but it's fine this is
primarily<00:00:51.719> just<00:00:51.989> a<00:00:52.050> training<00:00:52.350> route<00:00:52.649> and<00:00:53.480> I

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
primarily just a training route and I

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.240 
primarily just a training route and I
should<00:00:54.690> probably<00:00:54.899> actually<00:00:55.260> sunny<00:00:55.770> day<00:00:55.980> if<00:00:56.129> I

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250

have<00:00:56.520> it<00:00:56.670> on<00:00:56.760> like<00:00:56.940> Pokemon<00:00:57.390> and<00:00:57.510> even<00:00:57.690> think

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
have it on like Pokemon and even think

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.930 
have it on like Pokemon and even think
about<00:00:57.899> that<00:00:58.199> so<00:00:58.410> that<00:00:58.520> baltham<00:00:59.520> doesn't<00:00:59.820> have

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
about that so that baltham doesn't have

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.030 
about that so that baltham doesn't have

are<00:02:13.019> going<00:02:13.230> quite<00:02:13.290> well<00:02:13.620> I<00:02:14.220> thought<00:02:14.940> I<00:02:15.420> was

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
are going quite well I thought I was

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:18.680 
are going quite well I thought I was
worried<00:02:16.319> that<00:02:16.349> my<00:02:16.560> Pokemon<00:02:17.040> would<00:02:17.250> die<00:02:17.690> but

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
worried that my Pokemon would die but

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.830 
worried that my Pokemon would die but
that<00:02:19.579> immediately<00:02:22.069> isn't<00:02:23.069> really<00:02:23.250> a<00:02:23.310> factor

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
that immediately isn't really a factor

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.330 
that immediately isn't really a factor
there<00:02:24.840> they're<00:02:25.200> doing<00:02:25.440> really<00:02:25.590> well<00:02:25.769> on<00:02:25.829> HP

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
there they're doing really well on HP

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.850 
there they're doing really well on HP
and<00:02:26.690> even<00:02:27.690> if<00:02:27.780> the<00:02:27.870> Pokemon<00:02:28.260> get<00:02:28.440> by<00:02:28.590> it

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
and even if the Pokemon get by it

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.800 
and even if the Pokemon get by it
doesn't<00:02:29.069> really<00:02:29.160> matter<00:02:29.340> so<00:02:29.819> you<00:02:30.090> don't<00:02:30.690> have

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
doesn't really matter so you don't have

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.530 
doesn't really matter so you don't have
to<00:02:30.930> worry<00:02:31.110> too<00:02:31.440> much<00:02:32.090> seems<00:02:33.090> like<00:02:33.209> whenever<00:02:33.359> I

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
to worry too much seems like whenever I

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.990 
to worry too much seems like whenever I
level<00:02:34.260> up<00:02:34.350> a<00:02:34.440> Pokemon<00:02:34.920> it's<00:02:35.160> like<00:02:35.310> to<00:02:35.760> get

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
level up a Pokemon it's like to get

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
probably not doesn't look like it

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.059 
probably not doesn't look like it
there's<00:03:12.810> they're<00:03:13.200> just<00:03:13.319> flying<00:03:13.650> through

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
there I can't do anything yes yeah I

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.640

think<00:03:19.440> we're<00:03:19.530> fine<00:03:19.830> our<00:03:20.220> setup<00:03:20.550> at<00:03:20.760> the<00:03:20.790> moment

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
think we're fine our setup at the moment

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.809 
think we're fine our setup at the moment
setup<00:03:22.650> looks<00:03:22.860> pretty<00:03:23.069> good<00:03:23.280> it's<00:03:23.520> probably

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:23.819 
setup looks pretty good it's probably

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:25.100 
setup looks pretty good it's probably
the<00:03:23.880> best<00:03:23.970> setup<00:03:24.240> we<00:03:24.390> can<00:03:24.510> have<00:03:24.690> with<00:03:24.930> the

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
the best setup we can have with the

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:26.990 
the best setup we can have with the
Pokemon<00:03:25.560> that<00:03:25.770> we<00:03:25.920> have<00:03:26.130> on<00:03:26.370> our<00:03:26.490> team<00:03:26.520> at<00:03:26.970> the

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
Pokemon that we have on our team at the

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.590 
Pokemon that we have on our team at the
current<00:03:27.360> moment<00:03:28.580> are<00:03:29.580> we<00:03:29.700> let's<00:03:30.120> go<00:03:30.300> ahead<00:03:30.420> and

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
current moment are we let's go ahead and

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.290 
current moment are we let's go ahead and
drag<00:03:30.780> a<00:03:30.840> dance<00:03:31.110> again<00:03:31.910> and<00:03:32.910> let's<00:03:33.150> actually

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300 
drag a dance again and let's actually

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.320 
drag a dance again and let's actually
switch<00:03:33.660> to<00:03:33.780> a<00:03:34.190> flame<00:03:35.190> blast<00:03:35.459> see<00:03:36.030> how<00:03:36.120> that

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
switch to a flame blast see how that

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.500 
switch to a flame blast see how that
works<00:03:36.540> probably<00:03:37.470> really<00:03:37.860> well<00:03:38.300> apply<00:03:39.300> does<00:03:39.480> a

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
works probably really well apply does a

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.680 
works probably really well apply does a
ton<00:03:39.780> of<00:03:39.810> damage<00:03:39.930> to<00:03:41.000> some<00:03:42.000> of<00:03:42.090> those<00:03:42.180> Pokemon

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
ton of damage to some of those Pokemon

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.750 
ton of damage to some of those Pokemon
see<00:03:43.680> when<00:03:43.860> it<00:03:43.950> gets<00:03:43.980> when<00:03:44.280> it<00:03:44.310> gets<00:03:44.520> frozen

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
see when it gets when it gets frozen

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.729 
see when it gets when it gets frozen
solid<00:03:45.180> and<00:03:45.510> there's<00:03:45.630> not<00:03:45.720> much<00:03:45.930> that<00:03:45.989> Pidgeot

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
solid and there's not much that Pidgeot

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:49.250 
solid and there's not much that Pidgeot
can<00:03:46.980> do<00:03:47.130> but<00:03:47.519> the<00:03:48.450> problem<00:03:48.810> is<00:03:48.900> when<00:03:49.080> it<00:03:49.170> just

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
can do but the problem is when it just

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.550 
can do but the problem is when it just
speeds<00:03:49.620> on<00:03:49.800> by<00:03:50.010> like<00:03:50.280> that<00:03:50.489> right<00:03:51.290> you<00:03:52.290> can't

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
speeds on by like that right you can't

00:03:52.560 --> 00:04:00.140 
speeds on by like that right you can't
do<00:03:52.709> anything<00:03:54.200> okay<00:03:57.140> well<00:03:58.580> we're<00:03:59.580> almost<00:03:59.730> done

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
do anything okay well we're almost done

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.780 
do anything okay well we're almost done

some<00:04:22.440> good<00:04:22.620> stuff<00:04:23.000> but<00:04:24.000> this<00:04:24.660> being<00:04:24.900> the<00:04:25.080> half

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
some good stuff but this being the half

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:26.870

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530 
pretty fast and you do level up pretty

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.560 
pretty fast and you do level up pretty
fast<00:04:28.740> so<00:04:29.070> just<00:04:29.880> helps<00:04:30.150> you<00:04:30.210> so<00:04:30.330> you<00:04:30.390> don't<00:04:30.450> have

to<00:04:30.660> grind<00:04:30.930> as<00:04:31.140> much<00:04:31.350> but<00:04:31.650> at<00:04:32.190> a<00:04:32.250> certain<00:04:32.610> point

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:32.820 
to grind as much but at a certain point

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.560 
to grind as much but at a certain point
it<00:04:33.300> it's<00:04:34.080> really<00:04:34.320> like<00:04:34.590> you<00:04:34.860> know<00:04:35.360> your<00:04:36.360> way

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
overpowered but some of the levels are

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.520 
overpowered but some of the levels are
very<00:04:39.030> difficult<00:04:39.450> so<00:04:39.840> it<00:04:39.930> definitely<00:04:40.080> really

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:40.530 
very difficult so it definitely really

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:42.830
