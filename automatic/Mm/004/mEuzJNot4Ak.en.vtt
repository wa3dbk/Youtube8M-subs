beautiful color on a blue eyes and I

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:35.710 
beautiful color on a blue eyes and I
feel<00:02:34.790> like<00:02:34.880> a<00:02:34.910> lot<00:02:35.150> of<00:02:35.180> women<00:02:35.480> have<00:02:35.570> the

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
feel like a lot of women have the

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.000 
feel like a lot of women have the
misconception<00:02:35.870> that<00:02:36.380> if<00:02:36.590> you<00:02:36.680> have<00:02:36.770> blue<00:02:36.980> eyes

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
misconception that if you have blue eyes

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.680 
misconception that if you have blue eyes
you<00:02:37.160> should<00:02:37.580> stick<00:02:37.820> the<00:02:37.940> blues<00:02:38.209> and<00:02:38.480> greens

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
you should stick the blues and greens

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.240 
you should stick the blues and greens
and<00:02:39.080> if<00:02:39.170> you<00:02:39.260> have<00:02:39.350> Browns<00:02:39.650> you<00:02:39.890> should<00:02:40.070> stick

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
and if you have Browns you should stick

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.160 
and if you have Browns you should stick
to<00:02:40.370> the<00:02:40.459> Browns<00:02:40.670> but<00:02:41.000> I<00:02:41.120> believe<00:02:41.570> it's<00:02:41.930> the

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
to the Browns but I believe it's the

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.050 
to the Browns but I believe it's the
opposite<00:02:42.650> yeah<00:02:42.920> absolutely<00:02:43.340> when<00:02:43.850> you<00:02:43.910> have<00:02:44.030> a

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
opposite yeah absolutely when you have a

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:45.580 
opposite yeah absolutely when you have a
contrast<00:02:44.570> behind<00:02:44.930> there<00:02:45.110> it<00:02:45.170> really<00:02:45.380> gives

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
contrast behind there it really gives

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.410 
contrast behind there it really gives
you<00:02:45.709> that<00:02:45.860> that<00:02:46.670> chance<00:02:46.940> to<00:02:47.120> make<00:02:47.270> the<00:02:47.390> eye

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
you that that chance to make the eye

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:48.970 
you that that chance to make the eye
color<00:02:47.690> pop<00:02:47.959> so<00:02:48.230> when<00:02:48.380> you<00:02:48.440> just<00:02:48.560> open<00:02:48.860> your<00:02:48.890> eye
