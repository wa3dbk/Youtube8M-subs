00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:09.380
 at this moment I will give an idea how 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:12.470
 make a gas evaporator like 

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:16.410
 hydrolysates to make to generate 

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:19.500
 gasoline fuel thanks 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:22.900
 for that we need 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:27.240
 I did not bump 12 volts 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.240
 I was just a general view 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:36.380
 It is 4 lpm per minute of air ozone 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.480
 well thats um 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.440
 I'm going to do a drill here this is 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:45.260
 water ride 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.260
 a vacuum with water 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:52.280
 it will take 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.600
 new mortar policy or not 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.930
 wait 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.890
 Distribute well as he 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.890
 the amount of air 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.420
 what will make this system is 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:10.490
 system what you are going to do is bubble up 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:13.790
 air or ozone 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:16.790
 to fuel and through that 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:19.010
 bubbling will generate gas 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.210
 from gasoline 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:24.479
 s 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:27.990
 It can be used as a torch or 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.730
 also to help give performance of 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.570
 gas 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:34.300
 a test 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:38.540
 what am I going to do just to give you a 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:42.640
 idea how I'm going to make the system 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.640
 in the fuel vaporizer 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.340
 and connected the pump 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.560
 are milestones through the same 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.560
 and start looking at the shoulders 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.560
 bye 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.400
 there's the wide area policy 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.170
 in water 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.129
 of water and fuel but there is a 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.129
 special container 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.600
 where gasoline 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.500
 the normal system of gasoline and not 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.910
 marley to the gas 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.910
 possible com and so 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:58.940
 evaporating the fuel would last longer 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:06.050
 the gas 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.050
 it would yield
