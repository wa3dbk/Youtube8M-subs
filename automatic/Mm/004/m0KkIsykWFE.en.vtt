moving<00:01:20.789> on<00:01:20.909> pop<00:01:21.630> out<00:01:21.929> your<00:01:22.289> panel<00:01:22.619> start<00:01:23.490> by

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
moving on pop out your panel start by

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.210 
moving on pop out your panel start by
working<00:01:23.819> around<00:01:24.300> the<00:01:24.450> edge<00:01:24.600> and<00:01:28.069> just<00:01:29.069> like

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
working around the edge and just like

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.600 
working around the edge and just like
that<00:01:29.369> comes<00:01:30.270> right<00:01:30.569> off<00:01:31.190> now<00:01:32.190> we<00:01:32.250> have<00:01:32.490> these

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
that comes right off now we have these

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.510 
that comes right off now we have these
fancy<00:01:32.940> wires<00:01:33.679> you<00:01:34.679> probably<00:01:35.220> won't<00:01:35.340> have<00:01:35.490> that

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
fancy wires you probably won't have that

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.719 
fancy wires you probably won't have that
that's<00:01:35.880> for<00:01:36.060> my<00:01:36.149> XM<00:01:36.539> so<00:01:36.960> leave<00:01:37.380> that<00:01:37.500> alone

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:37.729 
that's for my XM so leave that alone

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:41.289 
that's for my XM so leave that alone
from<00:01:38.729> behind<00:01:39.060> this<00:01:39.420> if<00:01:39.960> you<00:01:40.110> haven't<00:01:40.470> noticed

from behind this if you haven't noticed

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:44.389 
from behind this if you haven't noticed
there's<00:01:42.299> this<00:01:42.479> little<00:01:42.929> connector<00:01:43.409> right<00:01:44.039> here

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
there's this little connector right here

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.910 
there's this little connector right here
it's<00:01:45.240> just<00:01:45.360> hanging<00:01:45.720> out<00:01:45.929> there<00:01:46.170> has<00:01:46.530> one

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
it's just hanging out there has one

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.719 
it's just hanging out there has one
purple<00:01:47.369> wire<00:01:47.550> hanging<00:01:47.879> from<00:01:48.179> it<00:01:48.770> okay<00:01:49.770> that's

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
purple wire hanging from it okay that's

out<00:01:52.379> the<00:01:52.560> system<00:01:53.840> from<00:01:54.840> there<00:01:55.429> you're<00:01:56.429> gonna

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
out the system from there you're gonna

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.570 
out the system from there you're gonna
need<00:01:56.700> to<00:01:56.819> get<00:01:56.910> a<00:01:56.970> strong<00:01:57.360> piece<00:01:58.289> of<00:01:58.470> wire<00:01:58.649> just

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.199 
don't see one right now for some reason
how<00:02:37.680> about<00:02:37.860> this<00:02:38.040> this<00:02:38.519> looks<00:02:38.730> like<00:02:38.849> a<00:02:38.970> ground

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
how about this this looks like a ground

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:42.410 
how about this this looks like a ground
point<00:02:39.480> it's<00:02:40.349> a<00:02:40.470> bolt<00:02:40.709> right<00:02:41.700> on<00:02:41.760> the<00:02:41.970> side<00:02:42.150> here

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
point it's a bolt right on the side here

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:47.390 
point it's a bolt right on the side here
that<00:02:43.129> goes<00:02:44.129> straight<00:02:44.670> into<00:02:45.360> the<00:02:46.019> metal<00:02:46.400> you

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
that goes straight into the metal you

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.770 
that goes straight into the metal you
should<00:02:47.700> be<00:02:47.819> able<00:02:47.879> to<00:02:47.970> ground<00:02:48.180> it<00:02:48.300> from<00:02:48.420> there

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
should be able to ground it from there

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.620 
should be able to ground it from there
if<00:02:48.930> not<00:02:49.260> there's<00:02:49.620> a<00:02:49.800> metal<00:02:50.580> tacet<00:02:51.030> right<00:02:51.209> here

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
if not there's a metal tacet right here

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.870 
if not there's a metal tacet right here
it<00:02:51.990> has<00:02:52.110> also<00:02:52.260> bolted<00:02:52.800> straight<00:02:53.400> to<00:02:53.550> the<00:02:53.640> metal

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
it has also bolted straight to the metal

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.460 
it has also bolted straight to the metal
and<00:02:54.480> you<00:02:54.600> should<00:02:54.780> be<00:02:54.870> able<00:02:54.960> to<00:02:55.050> ground<00:02:55.230> that

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
and you should be able to ground that

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:56.770 
and you should be able to ground that
there

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
there

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.509 
there

all right so first things first let's
turn<00:03:00.510> the<00:03:00.660> car<00:03:00.870> on<00:03:01.080> to<00:03:01.739> ignition<00:03:02.069> but<00:03:02.760> not<00:03:02.940> all

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
turn the car on to ignition but not all

turn the car on to ignition but not all
the<00:03:03.239> way<00:03:03.300> on<00:03:05.569> okay<00:03:06.569> you're<00:03:07.019> gonna<00:03:07.140> wait<00:03:07.319> a<00:03:07.349> few

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
the way on okay you're gonna wait a few

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.940 
the way on okay you're gonna wait a few
seconds<00:03:07.980> for<00:03:08.160> the<00:03:08.400> airbag<00:03:08.640> leg<00:03:08.849> to<00:03:09.000> stabilize

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
seconds for the airbag leg to stabilize

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:15.559 
seconds for the airbag leg to stabilize
and<00:03:11.450> then<00:03:13.010> you're<00:03:14.010> going<00:03:14.129> to<00:03:14.190> touch<00:03:14.400> this<00:03:14.700> to

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:15.569 
and then you're going to touch this to

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:17.780 
and then you're going to touch this to
your<00:03:15.750> ground<00:03:15.959> point<00:03:16.230> for<00:03:16.980> one<00:03:17.220> second<00:03:17.730> and

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
your ground point for one second and

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.839 
your ground point for one second and
then<00:03:18.390> off<00:03:18.569> for<00:03:18.959> a<00:03:18.989> second<00:03:19.410> five<00:03:20.040> times<00:03:20.370> within

00:03:20.839 --> 00:03:20.849 
then off for a second five times within

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:23.300 
then off for a second five times within
10<00:03:21.180> seconds<00:03:21.629> I<00:03:21.780> know<00:03:22.170> that's<00:03:22.440> difficult<00:03:22.650> but

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
10 seconds I know that's difficult but

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:40.039

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:43.430 
it works 1 2 3 4 5 and look at that it's
gone<00:03:40.400> it's<00:03:41.400> less<00:03:41.640> annoying<00:03:42.110> it's<00:03:43.110> not<00:03:43.230> bother

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440
