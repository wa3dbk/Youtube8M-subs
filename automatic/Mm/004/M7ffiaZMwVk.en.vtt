biostatistics<00:03:15.130> so<00:03:15.310> far<00:03:15.550> this<00:03:15.700> season<00:03:15.910> have

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
biostatistics so far this season have

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:21.090 
biostatistics so far this season have
been<00:03:16.570> impressive<00:03:19.680> because<00:03:20.680> it's<00:03:20.860> called<00:03:21.040> a

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
been impressive because it's called a

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.340 
been impressive because it's called a
lot<00:03:21.250> of<00:03:21.370> gold<00:03:21.640> for<00:03:21.820> the<00:03:22.330> team<00:03:22.740> I<00:03:23.740> think<00:03:24.730> that

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
lot of gold for the team I think that

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:29.370 
lot of gold for the team I think that
he's<00:03:26.350> going<00:03:26.620> to<00:03:26.710> prove<00:03:27.100> that<00:03:27.310> season<00:03:28.380> we

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
he's going to prove that season we

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.030 
he's going to prove that season we
started<00:03:29.740> with<00:03:30.130> us<00:03:30.960> yes<00:03:31.960> he<00:03:32.410> has<00:03:32.530> lucky<00:03:32.800> also

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
started with us yes he has lucky also

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.380 
started with us yes he has lucky also
because<00:03:33.460> it<00:03:33.610> doesn't<00:03:33.940> have<00:03:34.060> to<00:03:34.180> play<00:03:34.270> the

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 
because it doesn't have to play the

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:36.900 
because it doesn't have to play the
World<00:03:34.720> Cup<00:03:35.020> and<00:03:35.530> so<00:03:35.890> I<00:03:36.160> think<00:03:36.520> the<00:03:36.730> message

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
World Cup and so I think the message

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.030 
World Cup and so I think the message
will<00:03:37.390> be<00:03:37.420> better<00:03:37.690> but<00:03:38.170> we<00:03:38.410> have<00:03:38.740> really<00:03:39.010> a

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
will be better but we have really a

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.200 
will be better but we have really a
different<00:03:39.460> decision<00:03:41.700> of<00:03:42.700> all<00:03:42.850> the<00:03:43.030> British

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:43.210 
different decision of all the British

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:44.910 
different decision of all the British

arguably<00:03:45.760> the<00:03:45.970> most<00:03:46.090> successful<00:03:46.330> is<00:03:46.780> John
