Hello, I'm Christoph Schumacher from Bosch eBike Systems. 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.500
Today we are in Stuttgart at the Sparkassen Mountain Bike Festival.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.000
The Ebike Race was a very interesting experience
and also a lot of fun.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Especially the acceleration when you pedal.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:17.400
Everyone who took a seat on an ebike and rode
around with it was thrilled.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.880
At the Ebike Race in Stuttgart, we had a lot
of tight corners.

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.940
You needed to decelerate again and again,
almost to zero, and then speed up again.

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.530
The ebike fully demonstrated its strengths.

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.500
It was a great experience.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.500
I like to use the ebike when I am training
downhill techniques.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:43.140
This gives me the chance to get up the mountain
while expending very little energy.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.500
I trained this way a lot in 2012.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.100
And that worked out very well for the Olympics
in London.
