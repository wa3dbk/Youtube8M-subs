I actually don't know what it does but
here's<00:00:43.460> the<00:00:43.670> code

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030 
here's the code

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:58.300 
here's the code
it's<00:00:44.510> pH<00:00:45.320> H<00:00:46.060> P<00:00:47.060> as<00:00:47.330> in<00:00:47.390> puppy<00:00:50.200> P<00:00:56.020> passed<00:00:57.020> it<00:00:57.310> PHH

00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:58.310 
it's pH H P as in puppy P passed it PHH

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:18.370 
it's pH H P as in puppy P passed it PHH
H<00:00:59.030> is<00:00:59.360> in<00:00:59.570> hat<00:01:03.790> ph<00:01:04.790> h<00:01:05.150> g<00:01:05.780> ph

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.170 

feech<00:01:20.560> so<00:01:21.560> it's<00:01:21.710> unlocked<00:01:22.009> festive<00:01:22.670> hats<00:01:22.880> I

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
feech so it's unlocked festive hats I

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:24.370 
feech so it's unlocked festive hats I
don't<00:01:23.390> have<00:01:23.479> to<00:01:23.570> go<00:01:23.689> figure<00:01:23.869> out<00:01:24.049> what<00:01:24.200> that<00:01:24.320> is

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
don't have to go figure out what that is

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.700 
don't have to go figure out what that is
afterwards<00:01:25.039> but<00:01:25.450> now<00:01:26.450> you<00:01:26.509> have<00:01:26.720> the<00:01:26.869> code

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
afterwards but now you have the code

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.960 
afterwards but now you have the code
next<00:01:28.490> is<00:01:29.020> fight<00:01:30.039> captions<00:01:31.039> so<00:01:31.429> I<00:01:31.460> imagine<00:01:31.670> this

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
next is fight captions so I imagine this

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:33.999 
next is fight captions so I imagine this
is<00:01:32.030> I'm<00:01:32.390> guessing<00:01:33.259> this<00:01:33.409> is<00:01:33.560> probably<00:01:33.860> gonna

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:34.009 
is I'm guessing this is probably gonna

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:36.660 
is I'm guessing this is probably gonna
be<00:01:34.100> like<00:01:34.369> the<00:01:34.820> 60s<00:01:35.420> Batman<00:01:35.869> show<00:01:36.110> where<00:01:36.380> it's

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
be like the 60s Batman show where it's

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.609 
be like the 60s Batman show where it's
POW<00:01:37.670> punch<00:01:38.450> Wow

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 
POW punch Wow

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:42.490 
POW punch Wow
that<00:01:39.829> sort<00:01:40.069> of<00:01:40.130> thing<00:01:40.630> we<00:01:41.630> will<00:01:41.990> see<00:01:42.170> though<00:01:42.319> so

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
that sort of thing we will see though so

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.200 
that sort of thing we will see though so
here's<00:01:42.710> the<00:01:42.829> code<00:01:42.950> for<00:01:43.009> that<00:01:43.250> one<00:01:43.399> it's<00:01:43.549> e<00:01:43.850> w<00:01:46.210> e

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
here's the code for that one it's e w e

00:01:47.210 --> 00:02:19.240 
here's the code for that one it's e w e
as<00:01:48.020> in<00:01:48.079> Edward<00:01:51.789> II<00:01:57.399> W<00:01:58.399> TP<00:01:58.759> e<00:02:07.030> w<00:02:08.030> TP<00:02:08.360> k<00:02:09.049> a<00:02:18.250> bat

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
as in Edward II W TP e w TP k a bat

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.370 
as in Edward II W TP e w TP k a bat
fight<00:02:19.730> caption<00:02:20.450> so<00:02:20.720> yeah<00:02:20.870> that<00:02:21.049> sounds<00:02:21.319> like

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
fight caption so yeah that sounds like

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.780 
fight caption so yeah that sounds like
what<00:02:21.620> it<00:02:21.650> is<00:02:23.650> the<00:02:24.650> next<00:02:24.890> one<00:02:24.980> is<00:02:25.130> a<00:02:25.160> minikit

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
what it is the next one is a minikit

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.240 
what it is the next one is a minikit
detector<00:02:26.450> which<00:02:27.350> should<00:02:27.560> alert<00:02:27.829> you<00:02:27.980> in<00:02:28.160> the

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
detector which should alert you in the

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:29.860 
detector which should alert you in the
levels<00:02:28.579> when<00:02:28.730> you're<00:02:28.850> near<00:02:29.000> a<00:02:29.030> minikit<00:02:29.540> which

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
levels when you're near a minikit which

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.629 
levels when you're near a minikit which
could<00:02:30.049> be<00:02:30.170> handy<00:02:30.470> for<00:02:30.519> trying<00:02:31.519> to<00:02:33.639> unlock

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:34.639 
could be handy for trying to unlock

00:02:34.639 --> 00:02:37.140 
could be handy for trying to unlock
everything<00:02:35.030> I<00:02:35.299> guess<00:02:35.560> so<00:02:36.560> I'm<00:02:36.709> sorry<00:02:36.950> that's

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
everything I guess so I'm sorry that's

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:55.460 
everything I guess so I'm sorry that's

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:07.730 

man<00:02:57.590> JYJ<00:03:03.290> minikit<00:03:04.290> detector<00:03:06.410> next<00:03:07.410> one<00:03:07.530> is<00:03:07.710> a

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:07.740 
man JYJ minikit detector next one is a

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:12.350 
man JYJ minikit detector next one is a
quest<00:03:08.390> detector<00:03:10.820> so<00:03:11.820> maybe<00:03:12.030> that's<00:03:12.180> like<00:03:12.300> a

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
quest detector so maybe that's like a

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.110 
quest detector so maybe that's like a
side<00:03:12.690> quest<00:03:13.050> type<00:03:13.320> thing<00:03:13.590> I'm<00:03:13.740> not<00:03:13.890> sure<00:03:14.120> what

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
side quest type thing I'm not sure what

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.960 
side quest type thing I'm not sure what
they<00:03:15.240> mean<00:03:15.420> by<00:03:15.570> that<00:03:15.750> but<00:03:16.020> we<00:03:16.710> will<00:03:16.860> here's<00:03:17.850> the

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
they mean by that but we will here's the

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.300 
they mean by that but we will here's the
code<00:03:18.180> for<00:03:18.360> you<00:03:18.510> you<00:03:18.690> can<00:03:18.870> go<00:03:19.050> explore<00:03:20.040> and<00:03:20.130> see

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
code for you you can go explore and see

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:21.110 
code for you you can go explore and see
what<00:03:20.460> that<00:03:20.550> does

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
what that does

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:36.730 
what that does
so<00:03:21.360> that's<00:03:21.540> K<00:03:21.810> n<00:03:22.080> j<00:03:23.060> k<00:03:24.060> and<00:03:24.330> j<00:03:24.450> b<00:03:25.080> d<00:03:25.890> 8<00:03:26.690> b<00:03:30.680> 8<00:03:35.180> and

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:36.740 
so that's K n j k and j b d 8 b 8 and

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:39.350 
so that's K n j k and j b d 8 b 8 and
then<00:03:37.740> the<00:03:37.860> last<00:03:38.010> one<00:03:38.250> we're<00:03:38.400> gonna<00:03:38.459> do<00:03:38.730> here<00:03:39.120> is

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
then the last one we're gonna do here is

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
rack up studs the other way to get studs

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.110 
rack up studs the other way to get studs
multipliers<00:03:47.160> are<00:03:47.400> through<00:03:47.610> the<00:03:47.700> red<00:03:47.850> bricks

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120

in the game but you have to buy them so
you<00:03:50.970> earn<00:03:51.240> the<00:03:51.420> red<00:03:51.570> thick<00:03:51.810> brick<00:03:52.200> and<00:03:52.470> then

you<00:04:05.790> two<00:04:06.060> of<00:04:06.209> them<00:04:06.650> and<00:04:07.650> the<00:04:07.860> code<00:04:08.100> is<00:04:08.370> 5<00:04:08.820> in<00:04:09.120> so

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.600 
you two of them and the code is 5 in so

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.630
