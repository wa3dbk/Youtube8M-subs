case here I'm quite impressed with it
I'm<00:00:19.230> not<00:00:19.500> sure<00:00:19.680> if<00:00:19.800> it's<00:00:19.860> enough<00:00:20.130> to<00:00:20.310> get<00:00:20.550> me<00:00:20.699> to

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:20.940 
I'm not sure if it's enough to get me to

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.420 
I'm not sure if it's enough to get me to
get<00:00:21.210> away<00:00:21.449> from<00:00:21.510> my<00:00:21.810> no<00:00:21.869> case<00:00:22.380> ways<00:00:22.740> I<00:00:23.130> don't<00:00:23.340> we

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
get away from my no case ways I don't we

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.340 
get away from my no case ways I don't we
use<00:00:23.580> a<00:00:23.609> case<00:00:23.850> at<00:00:24.029> all<00:00:24.090> on<00:00:24.210> my<00:00:24.330> phone<00:00:24.600> but<00:00:25.230> this

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
use a case at all on my phone but this

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.050 
use a case at all on my phone but this
one's<00:00:25.560> getting<00:00:25.949> closer<00:00:26.250> to<00:00:26.520> what<00:00:26.670> I'm<00:00:26.760> looking

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
one's getting closer to what I'm looking

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.000 
one's getting closer to what I'm looking
for<00:00:27.270> so<00:00:27.539> let's<00:00:27.960> take<00:00:28.080> a<00:00:28.140> quick<00:00:28.380> look<00:00:28.590> and<00:00:28.800> see

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
for so let's take a quick look and see

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.920 
for so let's take a quick look and see
how<00:00:29.490> it<00:00:29.640> is<00:00:29.730> constructed<00:00:29.939> a<00:00:30.390> little<00:00:30.570> close<00:00:30.750> up

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:30.930 
how it is constructed a little close up

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.290 
how it is constructed a little close up
shot<00:00:31.140> here<00:00:31.170> so<00:00:31.619> you<00:00:32.070> can<00:00:32.189> see<00:00:32.309> it's<00:00:32.430> got<00:00:32.669> it's

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
shot here so you can see it's got it's

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.150 
shot here so you can see it's got it's
pretty<00:00:33.450> rigid<00:00:33.720> and<00:00:33.960> you<00:00:34.110> really<00:00:34.410> can't<00:00:34.710> bend

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
pretty rigid and you really can't bend

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.889 
pretty rigid and you really can't bend
it<00:00:35.340> too<00:00:35.489> much<00:00:35.640> it's<00:00:35.910> got<00:00:36.420> a<00:00:36.450> lot<00:00:36.630> of<00:00:36.660> back

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
it too much it's got a lot of back

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.260 
it too much it's got a lot of back
support<00:00:37.110> there<00:00:37.710> is<00:00:37.829> no<00:00:38.010> screen<00:00:38.430> cover<00:00:38.790> for<00:00:39.180> it

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
support there is no screen cover for it

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.549 
support there is no screen cover for it
which<00:00:39.390> is<00:00:39.510> fine<00:00:39.719> because<00:00:39.870> I<00:00:40.020> really<00:00:40.350> don't

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
which is fine because I really don't

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.950 
which is fine because I really don't
think<00:00:40.890> these<00:00:41.250> screen<00:00:41.550> covers<00:00:41.850> are<00:00:42.000> often<00:00:42.390> that

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
think these screen covers are often that

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.930 
think these screen covers are often that
great<00:00:43.320> for<00:00:43.469> interacting<00:00:44.010> with<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.280> phone<00:00:44.489> so

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
great for interacting with the phone so

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.910 
great for interacting with the phone so
what<00:00:45.570> I<00:00:45.600> do<00:00:45.690> like<00:00:45.960> is<00:00:46.020> when<00:00:46.290> you<00:00:46.410> put<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.710> phone

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
what I do like is when you put the phone

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.400 
what I do like is when you put the phone
in<00:00:47.219> it<00:00:47.489> is<00:00:47.790> really<00:00:48.300> in<00:00:48.540> you'll<00:00:48.840> hear<00:00:49.050> it<00:00:49.170> just

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
in it is really in you'll hear it just

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.590 
in it is really in you'll hear it just
kind<00:00:49.590> of<00:00:49.649> snap<00:00:49.920> into<00:00:50.100> place<00:00:50.190> here<00:00:50.670> it<00:00:51.539> just

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
kind of snap into place here it just

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.930 
kind of snap into place here it just
wraps<00:00:52.379> right<00:00:52.770> around<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:53.309> phone<00:00:53.550> which<00:00:53.820> is

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
wraps right around the phone which is

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.970 
wraps right around the phone which is
really<00:00:54.180> nice<00:00:54.450> it<00:00:54.960> leaves<00:00:55.110> a<00:00:55.289> nice<00:00:55.410> little<00:00:55.680> lip

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
really nice it leaves a nice little lip

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.250 
really nice it leaves a nice little lip
here<00:00:56.190> also<00:00:56.430> so<00:00:56.879> if<00:00:57.570> you<00:00:57.719> put<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.020> phone<00:00:58.230> down

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
here also so if you put the phone down

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.189 
here also so if you put the phone down
on<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.800> table<00:00:59.149> your<00:01:00.149> glass<00:01:00.480> is<00:01:00.750> not<00:01:00.899> going<00:01:01.110> to

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
on the table your glass is not going to

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.810 
on the table your glass is not going to
be<00:01:01.320> touching<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:01.800> table<00:01:02.430> you'll<00:01:02.610> have<00:01:02.760> a

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
be touching the table you'll have a

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.789 
be touching the table you'll have a
little<00:01:03.180> bit<00:01:03.629> of<00:01:03.780> depth<00:01:04.739> there<00:01:05.100> maybe<00:01:05.789> a<00:01:05.909> half<00:01:06.600> a

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:06.799 
little bit of depth there maybe a half a

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:08.929 
little bit of depth there maybe a half a
millimeter<00:01:07.799> or<00:01:07.889> two<00:01:08.009> but<00:01:08.279> just<00:01:08.340> enough<00:01:08.789> to

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
millimeter or two but just enough to

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.849 
millimeter or two but just enough to
keep<00:01:09.149> all<00:01:09.569> that<00:01:09.869> grit<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:10.380> stuff<00:01:10.619> from

00:01:10.849 --> 00:01:10.859 
keep all that grit and stuff from

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:13.219 
keep all that grit and stuff from
getting<00:01:11.279> on<00:01:11.459> your<00:01:11.700> screen<00:01:12.119> and<00:01:12.479> like<00:01:13.109> I<00:01:13.170> said

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
getting on your screen and like I said

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.080 
getting on your screen and like I said
it<00:01:13.439> wraps<00:01:13.649> around<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:14.039> phone<00:01:14.279> quite<00:01:14.549> well<00:01:14.759> and

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
it wraps around the phone quite well and

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.789 
it wraps around the phone quite well and
so<00:01:15.420> well<00:01:15.599> that<00:01:15.810> it's<00:01:15.929> really<00:01:16.170> hard<00:01:16.380> to<00:01:16.529> get<00:01:16.679> it

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
so well that it's really hard to get it

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.199 
so well that it's really hard to get it
out<00:01:16.950> you<00:01:17.219> almost<00:01:17.340> feel<00:01:17.579> like<00:01:17.639> you're<00:01:17.819> going<00:01:18.119> to

00:01:18.199 --> 00:01:18.209 
out you almost feel like you're going to

00:01:18.209 --> 00:01:20.269 
out you almost feel like you're going to
break<00:01:18.389> the<00:01:18.599> phone<00:01:18.869> when<00:01:19.469> you<00:01:19.560> try<00:01:19.770> to<00:01:19.799> cut<00:01:20.099> this

00:01:20.269 --> 00:01:20.279 
break the phone when you try to cut this

00:01:20.279 --> 00:01:22.699 
break the phone when you try to cut this
thing<00:01:20.340> off<00:01:20.700> of<00:01:20.759> it<00:01:20.999> it's<00:01:21.149> really<00:01:21.689> very<00:01:22.529> very

00:01:22.699 --> 00:01:22.709 
thing off of it it's really very very

00:01:22.709 --> 00:01:24.469 
thing off of it it's really very very
tight<00:01:23.219> fit<00:01:23.520> which<00:01:23.700> I<00:01:23.819> guess<00:01:23.969> is<00:01:23.999> a<00:01:24.119> good<00:01:24.329> thing

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
tight fit which I guess is a good thing

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.489 
tight fit which I guess is a good thing
it<00:01:25.139> has<00:01:25.319> a<00:01:25.349> little<00:01:26.130> opening<00:01:26.579> here<00:01:26.849> for<00:01:27.149> the

00:01:27.489 --> 00:01:27.499 
it has a little opening here for the

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:31.039 
it has a little opening here for the
vibration<00:01:28.499> switch<00:01:28.740> so<00:01:29.069> that<00:01:29.279> is<00:01:29.999> exposed<00:01:30.539> but

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
vibration switch so that is exposed but

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.169 
vibration switch so that is exposed but
it's<00:01:31.200> really<00:01:31.409> recessed<00:01:31.979> back<00:01:32.249> there<00:01:32.459> and<00:01:32.579> I'm

00:01:33.169 --> 00:01:33.179 
it's really recessed back there and I'm

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:35.569 
it's really recessed back there and I'm
not<00:01:33.689> too<00:01:33.869> hard<00:01:34.049> to<00:01:34.139> with<00:01:34.889> my<00:01:35.009> fingers<00:01:35.310> to<00:01:35.340> get

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
not too hard to with my fingers to get

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:36.980 
not too hard to with my fingers to get
at<00:01:35.729> but<00:01:35.909> it<00:01:35.999> might<00:01:36.149> be<00:01:36.329> if<00:01:36.450> you<00:01:36.569> have<00:01:36.659> larger

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
at but it might be if you have larger

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.779 
at but it might be if you have larger
hands<00:01:37.169> maybe<00:01:37.349> a<00:01:37.439> little<00:01:37.619> bit<00:01:37.859> difficult<00:01:38.009> the

00:01:38.779 --> 00:01:38.789 
hands maybe a little bit difficult the

itself and I'm pretty impressed with it
my<00:02:06.630> only<00:02:06.749> complaint<00:02:07.559> is<00:02:07.709> that<00:02:07.770> it<00:02:08.039> does<00:02:08.250> add<00:02:08.489> a

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:08.519 
my only complaint is that it does add a

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:10.100 
my only complaint is that it does add a
little<00:02:08.849> bit<00:02:09.060> of<00:02:09.119> width<00:02:09.479> to<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:09.869> phone<00:02:10.079> a
