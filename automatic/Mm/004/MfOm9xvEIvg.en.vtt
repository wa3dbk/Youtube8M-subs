00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:11.599 
reasons

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:15.209 
reasons
it's<00:00:12.440> the<00:00:12.619> occasion<00:00:13.219> in<00:00:13.430> which<00:00:13.849> God<00:00:14.180> Himself

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:15.219 
it's the occasion in which God Himself

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:18.040 
it's the occasion in which God Himself
intervenes<00:00:16.219> to<00:00:17.000> quell<00:00:17.300> the<00:00:17.570> silh<00:00:17.750> fated

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:18.050

invasion the invasion of Israel by Magog

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.450 
invasion the invasion of Israel by Magog
and<00:00:20.750> Sahlins<00:00:21.259> but<00:00:21.439> the<00:00:21.529> second<00:00:21.919> reason<00:00:21.950> so

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:22.460 
and Sahlins but the second reason so

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.120 
and Sahlins but the second reason so
well<00:00:22.700> known<00:00:22.939> is<00:00:23.119> because<00:00:23.329> of<00:00:23.480> the<00:00:23.539> technology

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:24.130 
well known is because of the technology

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.100 
well known is because of the technology
the<00:00:25.130> passage<00:00:25.669> appears<00:00:25.910> to<00:00:26.660> clearly

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:27.110 
the passage appears to clearly

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:29.700 
the passage appears to clearly
anticipate<00:00:27.980> the<00:00:28.700> use<00:00:28.910> of<00:00:29.149> nuclear<00:00:29.360> weapons

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:29.710 
anticipate the use of nuclear weapons

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.770 
anticipate the use of nuclear weapons
what<00:00:30.710> I<00:00:30.739> mean<00:00:30.980> by<00:00:31.099> that<00:00:31.250> well<00:00:31.550> the<00:00:32.329> passage

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:32.780 
what I mean by that well the passage

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.950 
what I mean by that well the passage
indicates<00:00:33.290> that<00:00:33.920> the<00:00:34.129> leftover<00:00:34.700> weapons<00:00:35.149> will

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 
indicates that the leftover weapons will

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.540 
indicates that the leftover weapons will
provide<00:00:36.200> all<00:00:36.260> the<00:00:36.559> energy<00:00:36.590> needs<00:00:37.070> of<00:00:37.190> Israel

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:37.550 
provide all the energy needs of Israel

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.180 
provide all the energy needs of Israel
for<00:00:37.730> seven<00:00:38.030> years<00:00:38.210> the<00:00:39.200> ancient<00:00:39.559> commentators

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.190 
for seven years the ancient commentators

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.880 
for seven years the ancient commentators
presume<00:00:41.059> that<00:00:41.089> had<00:00:41.420> to<00:00:41.510> be<00:00:41.629> an<00:00:42.350> allegory<00:00:42.769> or

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890 
presume that had to be an allegory or

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:43.810 
presume that had to be an allegory or
something<00:00:43.249> because<00:00:43.489> they<00:00:43.640> couldn't

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:43.820 
something because they couldn't

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.970 
something because they couldn't
visualize<00:00:44.059> anything<00:00:44.629> burning<00:00:44.809> for<00:00:45.170> seven

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:45.980 
visualize anything burning for seven

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:47.829 
visualize anything burning for seven
years<00:00:46.190> and<00:00:46.339> we<00:00:46.429> smile<00:00:46.730> about<00:00:46.850> today<00:00:47.300> because

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:47.839 
years and we smile about today because

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:49.720 
years and we smile about today because
there<00:00:48.019> clearly<00:00:48.170> is<00:00:48.559> a<00:00:48.649> weapons<00:00:49.129> technology

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.730 
there clearly is a weapons technology

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.329 
there clearly is a weapons technology
could<00:00:50.329> easily<00:00:50.480> provide<00:00:51.350> all<00:00:51.679> the<00:00:51.949> energy

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:52.339 
could easily provide all the energy

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:54.009 
could easily provide all the energy
needs<00:00:52.370> for<00:00:53.120> a<00:00:53.149> nation<00:00:53.449> even<00:00:53.569> larger<00:00:53.899> than

00:00:54.009 --> 00:00:54.019 
needs for a nation even larger than

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:56.739 
needs for a nation even larger than
Israel<00:00:54.199> for<00:00:54.499> more<00:00:54.649> than<00:00:54.800> seven<00:00:55.069> years<00:00:55.629> but<00:00:56.629> the
