00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:14.270
 it ended the third stage of the rally silk 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:15.890
 the way and what I would like to note on three 

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:17.540
 stages of victory won 

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:19.460
 completely different characters that is, for now 

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:22.220
 nothing and types that would have won though 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.690
 would be two victories well from the details of these 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.310
 competition as always our expert 

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:27.800
 Sergey Nikolsky he will talk about what 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:30.020
 KAMAZ still leading but still 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:33.530
 it is not clear which of them is the strongest 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:35.650
 after all, they even know how to fly attention to 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.650
 screen 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:50.629
 a third of the silk road behind think many 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.760
 of the participants that went to this race in 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:54.140
 dreams ever come to speak at dakar 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.930
 seriously thinking 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.629
 thoughts here are so hard what then 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:02.110
 Dakar is called the Silk Road 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:04.040
 rehearsals of the world famous marathon 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.110
 what are you guys doing here 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.060
 and the organizers talked about it by the way 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.869
 raid and famous tips marathoners and by 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.149
 part-time 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:13.880
 former pilots of formula 1 such as the feat 

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:16.520
 there b on the silk road there is an ambush 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.770
 more abruptly do care of ski be it in Africa 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.119
 or america 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.160
 famous racers are largely regarded 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:24.080
 Russian roles and how to practice before 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.220
 the main world marathon I am 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.860
 battle check 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.670
 but in their place I would not come status 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.409
 shock way 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.750
 if only because for many of them 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:35.569
 Kolka is already lost and truly 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.690
 military trials failed 

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:40.190
 would get to the finish line 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:42.590
 one can only guess what such 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:45.050
 super new parts run in happened and 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.209
 dakar sheep on their bugs losing already 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:50.539

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:55.190
 Forces chair inferior in power any tanks 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:56.750

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.759
 Boris muck his technical 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:02.190
 problems with the transmission chances came back 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:03.990
 in became leaders practically not 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:07.050
 Sorry on the front gearbox 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:10.740
 unscrew the shank it had to 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:12.240
 stop for repair now tail and 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.740
 cool stop putting back and 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.510

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.170
 him gimbal and about him in the back that 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.700
 nothing terrible interesting and important 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.260
 Vladimir Vasilyev today did not get into 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.230
 the top three winners of the stages are still 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.420
 has a chance to win the world for 23 minutes he 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.340
 inferior leader race perhaps 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.010
 the only ones who are still testing 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:35.540
 the silk way is a movie even 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.540
 he is now the leader of the works 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.720
 meanwhile heat and schlesser if that 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:46.490
 tests on the car you shut up and in 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.980
 whatever is going to win 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:50.240

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:59.300
 three days of race and at every stage 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:01.790
 won different pylon today very 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:04.640
 long grueling however 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:08.230
 nice to become his victorious but pure 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:10.640
 physically it was very very hard 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.620
 very badly tested 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.740
 money from a mosquito tomorrow technical 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:17.570
 problems seem overpowered Anton shibalova 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:19.160

 the rest is half past one half 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.160
 was very so complicated 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:01.980
 much off-road constant swotting 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:04.590
