there<00:01:21.200> have<00:01:21.320> been<00:01:21.350> quite<00:01:21.770> a<00:01:21.800> few<00:01:21.979> attempts<00:01:22.369> at

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
there have been quite a few attempts at

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.690 
there have been quite a few attempts at
it<00:01:22.580> over<00:01:22.820> the<00:01:22.940> years<00:01:23.920> rather<00:01:24.920> part<00:01:25.520> of<00:01:25.610> the

it over the years rather part of the
problem<00:01:26.090> I<00:01:26.180> think<00:01:26.210> is<00:01:26.509> this<00:01:26.720> sport<00:01:27.050> itself

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
problem I think is this sport itself

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.080 
problem I think is this sport itself
doesn't<00:01:27.740> lend<00:01:28.009> itself<00:01:28.160> to<00:01:28.490> the<00:01:28.729> kinds<00:01:29.030> of

doesn't lend itself to the kinds of

doesn't lend itself to the kinds of
