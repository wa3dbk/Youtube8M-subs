the<00:01:16.399> Wacken<00:01:16.700> Nets<00:01:16.909> I<00:01:17.240> just<00:01:17.780> think<00:01:17.899> it<00:01:17.990> quick<00:01:18.140> it

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
the Wacken Nets I just think it quick it

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:19.690 
the Wacken Nets I just think it quick it
was<00:01:18.380> much<00:01:18.619> more<00:01:18.770> harder<00:01:19.009> than<00:01:19.130> a<00:01:19.189> basketball

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
was much more harder than a basketball

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.190 
was much more harder than a basketball
and<00:01:19.909> could<00:01:20.000> do<00:01:20.090> a<00:01:20.119> lot<00:01:20.360> more<00:01:20.390> damage<00:01:20.540> and

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
and could do a lot more damage and

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.840 
and could do a lot more damage and
that's<00:01:21.470> just<00:01:21.890> about<00:01:22.130> the<00:01:22.189> right<00:01:22.490> height<00:01:22.790> for

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
that's just about the right height for

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.670
