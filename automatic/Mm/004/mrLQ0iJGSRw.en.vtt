 Good night this Saturday. 

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:20.670
 And, well, people here take it back in 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.369
 maine craft with another video for the 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.730
 version 1.4 points 6 as you can see 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.740
 So, guys, I'm going to tell you what I already said. 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.340
 I made a video of simon dineck is the 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.710
 biosphere mode biosphere nÃ© 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:38.190
 is the biosphere, it has been updated to 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.989
 version 1.4 1.6 so I decided to make a 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.530
 video being the mold is very cool to 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.890
 Last 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:46.500
 so come on, let's go and click here 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:48.090
 single player create in word beauty 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.879
 chrÃ©tienne word 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:54.000
 Come on, let's put the word here. 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:56.899
 options here will have the options in the beauty 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.629
 which is good at what it is that boy does not 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:04.080
 structures or not certain will have a new 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:06.270
 that it is the biosphere that is what the 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.630
 mold adds beauty then it is the following 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:12.320
 I created it is to create the biome that I will be back 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:15.270
 icon bioma created beauty was talked about 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.979
 So, beauty guys, we'll be right back here. 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.590
 begin to explain the biosphere mode 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.630
 for you right here as you can 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.549
 see the principal in this place that in the world 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.950
 which is the spawn, you may be in 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.409
 in these circles anywhere but 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.680
 You always go up there and do not 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.869
 glass and let's start explaining the 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.960
 mod sure if you are listening 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:40.710
 noise and bubu was the fireworks there to drop 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.689
 Alright then come on, look how you 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.810
 You can see, we have to 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.579
 survive within that 10 of that circle 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.009
 and glass we will not jump down here 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.960
 to take a look and it's the following here 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.369
 People are going to try to survive. 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.530
 right here 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.509
 remembering that you can move to 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.149
 other biomes there you can enter 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.759
 within that circle by connecting the 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:06.479
 bridges remembering that each circle of this 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:09.420
 here are four bridges look a two 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:12.300
 three four 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.230
 and most have a lake here in the 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.690
 medium 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.540
 most do not all because they have a myoma 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.400
 I'm going to show it here too. 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.430
 Look, we can mine what to find. 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:26.909
 Diamond coal iron anything just 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:29.129
 just be lucky beauty is cool that he 

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:31.799
 this template will also add type 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:33.870
 meteor-type flying stones do not 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:35.580
 I know if I'm going to zoom in here I 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:39.360
 search for one here I'll zoom in here 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:41.069
 want to see here, look here guys like 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.840
 You can see you have to make a 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:45.120
 way to get here remembering that 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.860
 will have several meteors scattered 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.959
 for the right map 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.390
 and it looks interesting here you think 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:53.489
 emerald diamond looks easier than 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.530
 has an emerald that has a diamond 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:58.920
 here is easier to say, let's say 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:01.859
 here is the right strategic point 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:05.609
 so let's show the other biomes if 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:08.910
 remembering that it has all the right biomes 

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:12.629
 just do not know if it has a biome of the end eu 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:14.790
 still do not know without it I did not see what I 

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:15.480
 I read the mod was not talking about the 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.370
 end 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.549
 so let's take a look around here 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:25.980
 Some people look at another biome. 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:31.069
 looking're frozen pond there that 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:31.069
 As you can see, it froze right. 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:38.400
 Let's take a look around here for a desert. 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:40.290
 and that's it a way guys today 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.209
 remembering here looks will have caves 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.370
 down here you can find caves 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:47.450
 here I will try to find one that will be a 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:50.910
 bit difficult but I'll try to find a 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:54.329
 It's you have to find it and you're mining it there. 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:56.310
 that you will find it right and that's it 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:58.829
 guys today's cast and hopefully 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:01.169
 You liked it if you liked unmik. 

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:02.160
 but the subscriber but the favorite if you can 

00:04:01.169 --> 00:04:05.430
 of course not 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:07.650
 and do not forget the people to check the 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:10.440
 minecraft downloads 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.569
 and installer the right way and I ended up 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.640
 to find a cave I think it 's kind of 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:17.630
 a cave 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:20.420
 It is not too small and right that's there 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:22.670
 Today's video was worth even more and only 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:24.230
 to make it clear that there is a biome of 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:27.920
 and not from neder 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:29.960
 I'm going to is one that wanted to do even leaves 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:32.330
 I think here I'll show him to 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:35.990
 You're right then when I find you. 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:38.450
 I told you, I went and then I found the 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:41.330
 biome of the nerd here just to show 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:43.160
 you who have the right neder biome have 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.900
 a flying best that have these little critters 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.310
 of gold sword right here that I do not 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:49.970
 I'm going to tell you that I know I'm going to die. 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:52.820
 I will not even catch it here. 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:54.200
 kumano right then this is it the video of 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:56.300
 today I went 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:05:02.530
 I directed called him the favorite so 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:02.530
 you know that I went to the ala 

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:15.419

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:21.660
