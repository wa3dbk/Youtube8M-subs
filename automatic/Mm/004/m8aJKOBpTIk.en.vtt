overclocking<00:00:13.019> in<00:00:13.170> tutorial<00:00:14.120> so<00:00:15.199> as<00:00:16.199> you<00:00:16.350> can

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
overclocking in tutorial so as you can

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.830 
overclocking in tutorial so as you can
see<00:00:16.529> there's<00:00:16.920> only<00:00:17.750> drawn<00:00:18.750> one<00:00:18.779> a<00:00:19.050> GUI<00:00:19.590> on<00:00:19.740> and

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:20.840 
see there's only drawn one a GUI on and

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:26.500 
see there's only drawn one a GUI on and
go<00:00:21.840> back<00:00:22.109> and<00:00:22.470> see<00:00:22.859> both<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:24.300> Icarus<00:00:25.019> and<00:00:25.310> ad

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:26.510 
go back and see both the Icarus and ad

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:30.919 
go back and see both the Icarus and ad
minor<00:00:27.510> one<00:00:27.810> it's<00:00:28.529> not<00:00:28.769> it's<00:00:29.250> not<00:00:29.429> hashing<00:00:29.929> so

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
minor one it's not it's not hashing so

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.510 
minor one it's not it's not hashing so
I'm<00:00:31.890> going<00:00:32.369> to<00:00:32.460> use<00:00:33.059> a<00:00:33.989> special<00:00:34.380> come<00:00:34.739> on

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
I'm going to use a special come on

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.709 
I'm going to use a special come on
this<00:00:36.210> works<00:00:36.480> for<00:00:36.719> PF<00:00:37.469> g<00:00:37.649> minor<00:00:37.940> not<00:00:38.940> cg<00:00:39.390> but<00:00:39.540> I'm

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
this works for PF g minor not cg but I'm

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.280 
this works for PF g minor not cg but I'm
not<00:00:39.899> sure<00:00:40.140> how<00:00:40.260> to<00:00:40.290> use<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.739> G<00:00:40.920> minor<00:00:41.719> but<00:00:42.719> this

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
not sure how to use the G minor but this

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.670 
not sure how to use the G minor but this
works<00:00:43.920> on<00:00:44.129> BF<00:00:44.910> g<00:00:45.059> minor<00:00:45.300> all<00:00:45.629> versions<00:00:46.620> so

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:48.680 
works on BF g minor all versions so

00:00:48.680 --> 00:01:02.830 
works on BF g minor all versions so
oopsies<00:00:56.449> so<00:00:57.449> click<00:00:57.840> on<00:00:58.399> search<00:00:59.399> and<00:00:59.699> type<00:01:00.180> CMD

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:02.840 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:12.469 

now<00:01:03.840> you<00:01:03.899> can<00:01:04.290> see<00:01:09.409> you<00:01:10.409> can<00:01:10.650> see<00:01:11.220> come<00:01:12.000> on<00:01:12.210> and

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
now you can see you can see come on and

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:19.219 
now you can see you can see come on and
I'll<00:01:12.840> just<00:01:12.900> open<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:14.509> folder<00:01:17.659> side<00:01:18.659> by<00:01:18.900> side

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
I'll just open the folder side by side

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:26.390 
I'll just open the folder side by side
and<00:01:20.360> you<00:01:21.950> can<00:01:22.950> see<00:01:23.869> the<00:01:24.869> terminal<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.530> things

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:57.360 

so<00:02:52.019> there<00:02:53.019> are<00:02:53.250> four<00:02:54.250> strings<00:02:55.620> with<00:02:56.620> each

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
so there are four strings with each

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.660 
so there are four strings with each
string<00:02:57.880> consists<00:02:58.360> of<00:02:58.540> four<00:02:59.430> character<00:03:00.430> at

string consists of four character at
alphanumeric<00:03:01.630> characters<00:03:02.190> so<00:03:03.190> you<00:03:03.849> can<00:03:04.540> find

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
alphanumeric characters so you can find

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.229 
alphanumeric characters so you can find

the hash rate configuration on the
description<00:03:08.139> below<00:03:08.400> so<00:03:09.400> I'll<00:03:09.639> choose<00:03:10.180> 2<00:03:11.170> point

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
description below so I'll choose 2 point

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
2 Giga hash so X 0 capital A and an 81

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:29.090 
2 Giga hash so X 0 capital A and an 81
so<00:03:22.139> and<00:03:23.139> minor<00:03:24.069> :<00:03:24.760> clock<00:03:25.090> equals<00:03:25.900> x<00:03:26.230> small<00:03:27.130> X<00:03:27.340> 0

so and minor : clock equals x small X 0

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:34.259 
so and minor : clock equals x small X 0
capital<00:03:30.100> a<00:03:30.340> 8<00:03:31.060> and<00:03:31.569> then<00:03:31.959> 1<00:03:32.579> and<00:03:33.579> then

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:34.269 
capital a 8 and then 1 and then

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:37.280 
capital a 8 and then 1 and then
afterwards<00:03:34.780> click<00:03:35.620> enter

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
afterwards click enter

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.800 
afterwards click enter
so<00:03:38.290> um<00:03:38.709> so<00:03:39.549> you<00:03:39.609> can<00:03:39.850> see<00:03:40.150> this<00:03:40.389> will<00:03:40.569> stop

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810

I<00:04:03.640> only<00:04:04.640> have<00:04:04.850> four<00:04:05.270> configurations<00:04:05.720> because

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
I only have four configurations because

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:11.020 
I only have four configurations because
that's<00:04:06.830> what<00:04:07.040> that<00:04:07.400> mean<00:04:08.320> showed<00:04:09.320> us<00:04:09.760> so<00:04:10.760> I

that's what that mean showed us so I

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.770 
that's what that mean showed us so I
have<00:04:11.240> one<00:04:11.570> point<00:04:11.780> six<00:04:12.080> which<00:04:12.440> is<00:04:12.470> the<00:04:12.650> default

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780

two<00:04:17.450> point<00:04:17.660> O<00:04:17.870> and<00:04:18.080> two<00:04:18.260> point<00:04:18.500> two<00:04:18.620> so<00:04:19.190> I'm

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
two point O and two point two so I'm

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:21.789 
two point O and two point two so I'm
using<00:04:19.519> the<00:04:19.760> highest<00:04:20.239> configuration<00:04:20.870> two

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799 
using the highest configuration two

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:24.370 
using the highest configuration two
point<00:04:22.070> two<00:04:22.310> and<00:04:22.570> as<00:04:23.570> you<00:04:23.660> can<00:04:23.810> see<00:04:24.080> it's

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
point two and as you can see it's

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.180 
point two and as you can see it's
already<00:04:25.480> more<00:04:26.480> than<00:04:26.690> two<00:04:27.140> plus<00:04:27.530> two<00:04:27.830> point<00:04:28.010> O

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190 
already more than two plus two point O

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:32.380 
already more than two plus two point O
plus<00:04:28.760> Giga<00:04:29.690> hash<00:04:29.930> and<00:04:30.700> sometimes<00:04:31.700> go<00:04:31.910> to<00:04:32.060> point

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:32.390 
plus Giga hash and sometimes go to point

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:37.900 
plus Giga hash and sometimes go to point
6<00:04:32.780> over<00:04:33.170> 2<00:04:33.350> 7<00:04:33.800> 3<00:04:33.830> because<00:04:34.790> your<00:04:34.940> hash<00:04:35.090> and<00:04:36.910> it's

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:37.910 
6 over 2 7 3 because your hash and it's

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:41.590 
6 over 2 7 3 because your hash and it's
it<00:04:38.360> it's<00:04:38.840> going<00:04:39.080> to<00:04:39.140> fluctuate<00:04:39.590> a<00:04:39.620> bit<00:04:40.600> but

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:41.600 
it it's going to fluctuate a bit but

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:46.420 
it it's going to fluctuate a bit but
let's<00:04:42.230> just<00:04:42.380> add<00:04:42.560> my<00:04:43.570> icarus<00:04:44.570> on<00:04:44.780> so<00:04:45.560> as<00:04:46.250> you

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
let's just add my icarus on so as you

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.670 
let's just add my icarus on so as you
can<00:04:46.490> see<00:04:46.550> this<00:04:47.000> the<00:04:47.870> green<00:04:48.080> light<00:04:48.260> is<00:04:48.380> on

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:48.680 
can see this the green light is on

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.850 
can see this the green light is on
I'll<00:04:48.980> just<00:04:49.130> add<00:04:49.370> my<00:04:49.490> icarus<00:04:50.590> block<00:04:51.590> you're<00:04:51.740> up

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:51.860 
I'll just add my icarus block you're up

00:04:51.860 --> 00:05:04.250 
I'll just add my icarus block you're up
to<00:04:52.040> so<00:04:52.730> manage<00:04:54.040> then<00:04:55.690> plus<00:04:56.690> all<00:04:58.780> also

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:04.260 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:12.520 

Oh<00:05:04.490> spoke<00:05:05.490> more<00:05:05.670> stuff

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:12.530 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:18.320 

eto

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:18.330 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:23.320 

I<00:05:18.360> don't<00:05:18.780> think<00:05:18.900> you<00:05:19.200> can<00:05:19.320> add<00:05:21.200> any<00:05:22.200> a<00:05:22.470> Chris

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:23.330 
I don't think you can add any a Chris

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:27.890 
I don't think you can add any a Chris
because<00:05:24.330> I<00:05:24.540> think<00:05:24.600> you<00:05:24.960> specified<00:05:25.770> I<00:05:26.900> might

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:27.900 
because I think you specified I might

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:31.460 
because I think you specified I might
add<00:05:28.290> -<00:05:28.590> but<00:05:29.430> let's<00:05:30.420> see<00:05:30.690> our<00:05:30.720> device<00:05:31.290> in

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:31.470 
add - but let's see our device in

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:40.700 
add - but let's see our device in
Princes<00:05:32.930> so<00:05:37.490> streamliner<00:05:39.170> says<00:05:40.170> either<00:05:40.320> four

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:40.710 
Princes so streamliner says either four

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:46.600 
Princes so streamliner says either four
of<00:05:40.860> those<00:05:41.070> either<00:05:41.340> so<00:05:41.580> let's<00:05:41.700> just<00:05:41.910> try<00:05:44.750> plus

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:46.610 
of those either so let's just try plus

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:51.140 
of those either so let's just try plus
ruptor<00:05:49.580> -<00:05:50.580> lon

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:51.150 
ruptor - lon

00:05:51.150 --> 00:06:02.920 
ruptor - lon
nice<00:05:51.660> nice<00:05:51.930> backslash<00:05:52.560> backslash<00:05:53.780> comm<00:05:56.840> 13

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:02.930 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:22.709 

so<00:06:03.590> that's<00:06:03.919> it<00:06:04.340> for<00:06:11.020> what

00:06:22.709 --> 00:06:22.719 

00:06:22.719 --> 00:06:26.279 

yep<00:06:23.319> as<00:06:23.529> you<00:06:23.679> can<00:06:23.830> see<00:06:24.659> instead<00:06:25.659> of<00:06:25.749> saying<00:06:26.049> I

00:06:26.279 --> 00:06:26.289 
yep as you can see instead of saying I

00:06:26.289 --> 00:06:32.119 
yep as you can see instead of saying I
see<00:06:27.009> a<00:06:27.869> now<00:06:28.869> they<00:06:29.110> say<00:06:29.319> block<00:06:29.860> a<00:06:30.069> ruptor<00:06:30.449> so<00:06:31.449> BES

00:06:32.119 --> 00:06:32.129 
see a now they say block a ruptor so BES

00:06:32.129 --> 00:06:37.789 
see a now they say block a ruptor so BES
so<00:06:33.129> and<00:06:34.469> those<00:06:35.469> extra<00:06:36.129> start<00:06:36.489> hashing

00:06:37.789 --> 00:06:37.799 
so and those extra start hashing

00:06:37.799 --> 00:06:41.189 
so and those extra start hashing
hopefully<00:06:38.799> the<00:06:39.039> blocker<00:06:39.399> after<00:06:39.849> yep<00:06:40.689> so<00:06:41.049> as

00:06:41.189 --> 00:06:41.199 
hopefully the blocker after yep so as

00:06:41.199 --> 00:06:44.249 
hopefully the blocker after yep so as
you<00:06:41.319> can<00:06:41.439> see<00:06:41.499> the<00:06:41.949> average<00:06:42.639> Giga<00:06:43.599> hash<00:06:43.809> is<00:06:44.079> now

00:06:44.249 --> 00:06:44.259 
you can see the average Giga hash is now

00:06:44.259 --> 00:06:49.049 
you can see the average Giga hash is now
to<00:06:44.319> point<00:06:44.889> to<00:06:45.360> something<00:06:46.360> -<00:06:47.159> while<00:06:48.159> the<00:06:48.459> block

00:06:49.049 --> 00:06:49.059 
to point to something - while the block

00:06:49.059 --> 00:06:51.239 
to point to something - while the block
Eruptor<00:06:49.539> remains<00:06:49.989> the<00:06:50.739> default

00:06:51.239 --> 00:06:51.249 
Eruptor remains the default

00:06:51.249 --> 00:06:57.889 
Eruptor remains the default
configuration<00:06:51.489> which<00:06:52.239> should<00:06:52.539> go<00:06:53.379> to<00:06:54.809> 3<00:06:55.809> 333

00:06:57.889 --> 00:06:57.899 
configuration which should go to 3 333

00:06:57.899 --> 00:07:06.569 
configuration which should go to 3 333
233<00:06:58.899> mega<00:06:59.199> hash<00:07:00.329> so<00:07:01.329> this<00:07:02.079> is<00:07:02.199> how<00:07:02.469> you<00:07:05.519> this<00:07:06.519> is

00:07:06.569 --> 00:07:06.579 
233 mega hash so this is how you this is

00:07:06.579 --> 00:07:09.989 
233 mega hash so this is how you this is
how<00:07:06.759> you<00:07:07.110> overclock<00:07:08.110> the<00:07:08.259> app<00:07:08.499> minor<00:07:08.999> the

00:07:09.989 --> 00:07:09.999 
how you overclock the app minor the

00:07:09.999 --> 00:07:12.149 
how you overclock the app minor the
configuration<00:07:10.749> strings<00:07:11.469> will<00:07:11.919> be<00:07:11.949> in<00:07:12.099> the
