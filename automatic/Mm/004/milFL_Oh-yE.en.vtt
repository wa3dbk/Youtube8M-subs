00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
times over and over it bends those wires

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.410 
times over and over it bends those wires
to<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.660> point<00:00:36.900> where<00:00:37.110> they<00:00:37.260> break<00:00:37.559> and<00:00:38.420> right

to the point where they break and right

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.200 
to the point where they break and right
now<00:00:39.539> the<00:00:39.600> automatic<00:00:40.579> the<00:00:41.579> locks<00:00:41.820> right<00:00:42.059> now

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.810 
cut this open we're going to supply some
new<00:01:24.990> wires<00:01:25.170> in<00:01:25.350> there<00:01:25.500> and<00:01:25.740> going<00:01:26.490> to<00:01:26.580> fix<00:01:26.700> the

new wires in there and going to fix the
problem

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
problem

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.100 
problem
all<00:01:27.360> right<00:01:27.480> so<00:01:27.630> it<00:01:27.780> said<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.890> door

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 
all right so it said the the door

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.830 
all right so it said the the door
probably<00:01:31.110> has<00:01:31.260> an<00:01:31.500> electrical<00:01:31.920> problem<00:01:32.840> most

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
probably has an electrical problem most

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.170 
probably has an electrical problem most
because<00:01:34.080> it<00:01:34.260> crimps<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:34.740> wires<00:01:34.980> right<00:01:35.880> here

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
because it crimps the wires right here

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.120 
because it crimps the wires right here
in<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.720> door<00:01:36.900> right<00:01:37.760> there<00:01:39.050> but<00:01:40.050> I<00:01:40.350> untaped<00:01:40.980> it

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
in the door right there but I untaped it

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.390 
in the door right there but I untaped it
all<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:41.780> none<00:01:42.780> of<00:01:42.900> the<00:01:42.960> wires<00:01:43.140> look<00:01:43.920> bad<00:01:44.100> so

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:44.400 
all and none of the wires look bad so

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.600 
all and none of the wires look bad so
I've<00:01:45.210> already<00:01:45.420> to<00:01:45.630> take<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:45.870> door<00:01:46.080> off<00:01:46.580> do<00:01:47.580> a

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
I've already to take the door off do a

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.530 
I've already to take the door off do a
panel<00:01:47.940> off<00:01:48.090> and<00:01:48.920> check<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.160> lock<00:01:51.150> mechanism

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
panel off and check the lock mechanism

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.990 
panel off and check the lock mechanism
itself<00:01:52.460> and<00:01:53.460> I<00:01:53.790> started<00:01:54.330> that<00:01:54.480> by<00:01:55.940> actually<00:01:56.940> I

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
itself and I started that by actually I

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.120 
itself and I started that by actually I
had<00:01:57.330> to<00:01:57.450> pull<00:01:57.630> off<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:58.020> handle<00:01:58.440> which<00:01:58.890> has<00:01:59.100> a

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
had to pull off the handle which has a

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.790 
had to pull off the handle which has a
store<00:01:59.640> type<00:02:00.090> connection<00:02:00.480> and<00:02:00.870> then<00:02:01.410> all<00:02:01.680> of

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:01.800 
store type connection and then all of

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.150 
store type connection and then all of
this<00:02:01.890> is<00:02:02.040> a<00:02:02.390> Phillips<00:02:03.390> head<00:02:03.680> right<00:02:04.680> there<00:02:04.920> so

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:05.160 
this is a Phillips head right there so

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.570 
this is a Phillips head right there so
I'm<00:02:05.250> going<00:02:05.370> to<00:02:05.400> do<00:02:05.490> that<00:02:05.670> real<00:02:05.940> quick

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:06.580 
I'm going to do that real quick

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.060 
I'm going to do that real quick
and<00:02:06.700> so<00:02:07.480> getting<00:02:07.810> the<00:02:07.900> door<00:02:08.050> off<00:02:08.259> or<00:02:08.530> the<00:02:08.740> door

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.070 
and so getting the door off or the door

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:12.330 
and so getting the door off or the door
panel<00:02:09.430> off<00:02:09.550> was<00:02:09.910> fairly<00:02:10.570> easy<00:02:11.100> there's<00:02:12.100> just

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
panel off was fairly easy there's just

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.700 
panel off was fairly easy there's just
one<00:02:12.550> logical<00:02:12.880> connection<00:02:13.360> here<00:02:13.690> and<00:02:13.870> then

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:14.710 
one logical connection here and then

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:16.800 
one logical connection here and then
that<00:02:15.400> screw<00:02:15.790> which<00:02:16.030> I<00:02:16.150> took<00:02:16.210> out<00:02:16.480> which<00:02:16.660> was

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
that screw which I took out which was

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.040 
that screw which I took out which was
there<00:02:17.020> was<00:02:17.260> holding<00:02:17.650> the<00:02:17.940> panel<00:02:18.940> on<00:02:19.060> and<00:02:19.840> then

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
there was holding the panel on and then

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.950 
there was holding the panel on and then
you<00:02:20.110> just<00:02:20.320> lift<00:02:20.620> straight<00:02:20.890> up<00:02:20.950> and<00:02:21.280> then<00:02:22.090> those

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:22.960 
you just lift straight up and then those

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.350 
you just lift straight up and then those
little<00:02:22.990> hooks<00:02:23.520> that<00:02:24.520> hook<00:02:24.580> into<00:02:24.970> the<00:02:25.180> door

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
little hooks that hook into the door

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:31.440 
little hooks that hook into the door
then<00:02:26.080> come<00:02:26.290> right<00:02:26.320> off<00:02:27.120> so<00:02:29.340> the<00:02:30.340> the<00:02:31.240> lock

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
then come right off so the the lock

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.990 
then come right off so the the lock
mechanism<00:02:31.600> looks<00:02:32.530> like<00:02:32.710> this<00:02:32.950> which<00:02:33.700> I'm

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
mechanism looks like this which I'm

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.300 
mechanism looks like this which I'm
going<00:02:34.090> to<00:02:34.150> replace<00:02:34.480> and<00:02:34.780> there's<00:02:35.680> three<00:02:36.010> bars

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
going to replace and there's three bars

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.390 
going to replace and there's three bars
on<00:02:36.670> it<00:02:36.820> that<00:02:37.000> have<00:02:37.210> to<00:02:37.330> come<00:02:37.510> undone

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
on it that have to come undone

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.480 
on it that have to come undone
they<00:02:39.940> actually<00:02:40.300> hook<00:02:40.540> in<00:02:40.860> right<00:02:41.860> here<00:02:42.310> and

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:42.490 
they actually hook in right here and

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:45.900 
they actually hook in right here and
then<00:02:43.090> these<00:02:43.300> clip<00:02:43.780> and<00:02:44.050> lock<00:02:44.980> the<00:02:45.250> bar<00:02:45.790> in

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
then these clip and lock the bar in

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.699 
then these clip and lock the bar in
place<00:02:46.090> so<00:02:46.540> in<00:02:47.080> this<00:02:47.890> case<00:02:48.130> this<00:02:48.310> is<00:02:48.490> for<00:02:48.520> the

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
place so in this case this is for the

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:54.870 
place so in this case this is for the
this<00:02:51.240> is<00:02:52.240> for<00:02:52.540> the<00:02:52.690> door<00:02:52.930> latching<00:02:53.920> when<00:02:54.760> you

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
this is for the door latching when you

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.360 
this is for the door latching when you
unlatch<00:02:55.690> the<00:02:55.840> door<00:02:56.020> from<00:02:56.140> the<00:02:56.230> inside<00:02:56.530> because

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
unlatch the door from the inside because

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:02.100 
unlatch the door from the inside because
it's<00:02:57.670> got<00:02:57.790> the<00:02:59.130> parental<00:03:00.130> controls<00:03:00.490> here<00:03:01.110> to

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
it's got the parental controls here to

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.570 
it's got the parental controls here to
lock<00:03:02.350> it<00:03:02.560> from<00:03:02.800> coming<00:03:03.160> undone<00:03:03.400> or<00:03:04.350> from<00:03:05.580> from

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.580 
lock it from coming undone or from from

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.270 
lock it from coming undone or from from
going<00:03:06.880> past<00:03:07.180> there<00:03:07.420> and<00:03:07.740> then<00:03:08.740> this<00:03:08.890> is<00:03:09.070> the

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
going past there and then this is the

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.780 
going past there and then this is the
the<00:03:10.000> lock<00:03:10.209> for<00:03:10.600> the<00:03:11.130> actual<00:03:12.130> electric<00:03:12.580> part

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
the lock for the actual electric part

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.720 
the lock for the actual electric part
that<00:03:13.000> doesn't<00:03:13.300> work<00:03:13.480> on<00:03:13.750> the<00:03:13.930> current<00:03:14.920> one<00:03:15.040> and

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.509 

but<00:03:18.730> yeah<00:03:18.820> that<00:03:19.000> part<00:03:19.209> locks<00:03:19.450> the<00:03:19.690> door<00:03:19.870> and

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
but yeah that part locks the door and

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:23.310 
but yeah that part locks the door and
then<00:03:21.519> this<00:03:21.700> would<00:03:21.880> be<00:03:22.030> for<00:03:22.269> the<00:03:22.300> outside<00:03:23.019> door

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
then this would be for the outside door

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:28.080 
then this would be for the outside door
outside<00:03:23.890> port<00:03:24.720> so<00:03:26.220> we're<00:03:27.220> going<00:03:27.340> to<00:03:27.400> take<00:03:27.940> the

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
outside port so we're going to take the

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:29.820 
outside port so we're going to take the
electrical<00:03:28.420> part<00:03:28.630> off<00:03:28.810> the<00:03:29.110> current<00:03:29.470> one<00:03:29.680> on

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:29.830 
electrical part off the current one on

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:31.920 
electrical part off the current one on
there<00:03:30.010> and<00:03:30.190> then<00:03:30.459> test<00:03:31.180> this<00:03:31.360> one<00:03:31.660> to<00:03:31.810> make

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
there and then test this one to make

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.860 
there and then test this one to make
sure<00:03:32.110> that<00:03:32.320> that<00:03:32.590> is<00:03:32.769> the<00:03:32.950> problem<00:03:33.780> so<00:03:34.780> we

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
sure that that is the problem so we

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.150 
sure that that is the problem so we
don't<00:03:35.019> have<00:03:35.200> to<00:03:35.350> take<00:03:35.590> a<00:03:35.620> look<00:03:35.800> because<00:03:35.890> it<00:03:36.100> is

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
don't have to take a look because it is

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.100 
don't have to take a look because it is
a<00:03:36.220> pain<00:03:36.459> to<00:03:36.519> go<00:03:36.730> the<00:03:36.880> cables<00:03:37.690> off<00:03:37.810> of<00:03:37.959> it<00:03:38.080> so

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
a pain to go the cables off of it so

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:46.009 
a pain to go the cables off of it so
okay<00:03:41.110> here's<00:03:41.320> the<00:03:41.560> new<00:03:42.600> the<00:03:43.600> new<00:03:43.630> lock<00:03:44.220> but<00:03:45.220> I

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
okay here's the new the new lock but I

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:48.180 
okay here's the new the new lock but I
disconnected<00:03:47.019> it<00:03:47.170> from<00:03:47.320> the<00:03:47.440> old<00:03:47.590> lock<00:03:47.800> just

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
disconnected it from the old lock just

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.790 
disconnected it from the old lock just
to<00:03:48.340> make<00:03:48.489> sure<00:03:48.670> that<00:03:48.850> that<00:03:49.000> was<00:03:49.150> a<00:03:49.180> problem<00:03:49.800> but

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:50.800 
to make sure that that was a problem but

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
to make sure that that was a problem but
all<00:03:51.280> it<00:03:51.400> does<00:03:51.550> is<00:03:51.700> you<00:03:51.790> actually<00:03:51.880> have<00:03:52.150> to<00:03:53.820> push

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:54.820 
all it does is you actually have to push

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:57.540 
all it does is you actually have to push
down<00:03:54.850> on<00:03:55.060> this<00:03:55.269> clip<00:03:55.540> right<00:03:55.720> here<00:03:56.220> and<00:03:57.220> then<00:03:57.400> it

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:57.550 
down on this clip right here and then it

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:00.960 
down on this clip right here and then it
pulls<00:03:58.030> off<00:03:58.410> like<00:03:59.410> so<00:03:59.620> but<00:04:00.580> you<00:04:00.640> gotta<00:04:00.790> get<00:04:00.880> the

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970 
pulls off like so but you gotta get the

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:02.400 
pulls off like so but you gotta get the
screwdriver<00:04:01.180> in<00:04:01.540> there<00:04:01.720> to<00:04:01.959> kind<00:04:02.080> of<00:04:02.200> cause<00:04:02.380> a

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:02.410 
screwdriver in there to kind of cause a

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:05.940 
screwdriver in there to kind of cause a
lock<00:04:02.680> is<00:04:02.890> is<00:04:03.880> behind<00:04:04.180> this<00:04:04.500> metal<00:04:05.500> piece<00:04:05.620> here

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:05.950 
lock is is behind this metal piece here

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:06.660 
lock is is behind this metal piece here
you<00:04:05.980> gotta<00:04:06.400> get

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:06.670 
you gotta get

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:08.910 
you gotta get
you<00:04:07.030> know<00:04:07.150> kind<00:04:07.390> of<00:04:07.510> hands<00:04:08.500> in<00:04:08.680> there<00:04:08.800> just

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 
you know kind of hands in there just

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.240 
you know kind of hands in there just
right<00:04:10.020> yeah<00:04:11.020> I<00:04:11.110> just<00:04:11.200> I'm<00:04:11.739> going<00:04:11.890> to<00:04:11.950> put<00:04:12.069> it<00:04:12.160> on

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
right yeah I just I'm going to put it on

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.560 
right yeah I just I'm going to put it on
here<00:04:12.580> just<00:04:12.760> to<00:04:13.090> test<00:04:13.300> it<00:04:13.480> and<00:04:13.690> then<00:04:15.450> I'm<00:04:16.450> gonna

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
here just to test it and then I'm gonna

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:18.030 
here just to test it and then I'm gonna
hit<00:04:16.720> the<00:04:16.810> button<00:04:16.930> and<00:04:17.230> you<00:04:17.530> can<00:04:17.650> watch<00:04:17.829> the

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:18.040 
hit the button and you can watch the

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.659 
hit the button and you can watch the
seeker<00:04:18.370> it<00:04:18.579> actually<00:04:18.970> goes<00:04:19.889> on<00:04:20.889> the<00:04:21.070> feet<00:04:21.459> not

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:21.669 
seeker it actually goes on the feet not

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:29.280 
seeker it actually goes on the feet not
but<00:04:24.150> there's<00:04:25.150> the<00:04:27.870> see<00:04:28.870> how<00:04:28.960> it's<00:04:29.110> moving

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:29.290 
but there's the see how it's moving

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:32.400 
but there's the see how it's moving
there<00:04:29.700> so<00:04:30.700> we<00:04:30.820> know<00:04:30.940> that<00:04:30.970> it's<00:04:31.900> the<00:04:32.139> actual

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.410 
there so we know that it's the actual

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:37.860 
there so we know that it's the actual
lock<00:04:32.680> mechanism<00:04:33.190> that's<00:04:33.400> broken<00:04:35.520> so<00:04:36.870> I'm

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 
lock mechanism that's broken so I'm

cables that are that are attached to

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:54.000 
cables that are that are attached to
these<00:04:51.820> right<00:04:52.090> here<00:04:52.360> off<00:04:52.990> while<00:04:53.500> it's<00:04:53.650> still<00:04:53.889> in

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:54.010

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:57.550 
fit on pretty tight so you're gonna get

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:59.370 
fit on pretty tight so you're gonna get
these<00:04:57.669> to<00:04:58.210> come<00:04:58.389> up<00:04:58.570> and<00:04:58.750> then<00:04:58.990> you<00:04:59.020> can<00:04:59.139> pull

these to come up and then you can pull

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:00.719 
these to come up and then you can pull
the<00:04:59.410> cable<00:04:59.530> right<00:04:59.979> out<00:05:00.100> of<00:05:00.130> the<00:05:00.250> hole<00:05:00.400> to<00:05:00.580> go

00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:00.729 
the cable right out of the hole to go

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:02.070 
the cable right out of the hole to go
right<00:05:00.880> into<00:05:01.090> that<00:05:01.210> hole<00:05:01.450> right<00:05:01.510> there<00:05:01.690> and

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.080 
right into that hole right there and

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.950 
right into that hole right there and
these<00:05:02.950> clip<00:05:03.250> on<00:05:03.460> and<00:05:04.030> there's<00:05:04.510> three<00:05:04.750> of<00:05:04.780> those

these clip on and there's three of those
so<00:05:05.290> and<00:05:05.500> they<00:05:05.620> make<00:05:06.010> it<00:05:06.040> pretty<00:05:06.220> difficult<00:05:06.460> to
