00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:44.050

 antich matching with the papers 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.600
 with the papers so you have to 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.420
 work to work to combine and 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:01.900
 work a lot to lucero ccs and more when 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.670

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:06.010
 teachers of this in the teaching staff 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.380
 but it's really worth it to see 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:10.920
 because they also work 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.560
 galicia and a barbarous taste 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:18.030
 how are we not going to work with the drawers 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.979
 as placing very easy Lenses 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.689
 Appliques have almost the same measurement as 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.689
 the front of the drawer 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:31.440
 and that are already prepared behind that 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.440
 everything ready is coming 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:37.409
 ah and the appliqué 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:42.149
 we have 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:44.299
 1 if we work the second of course 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:46.770
 previously applying the self-adhesive 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:49.200
 about suit all the furniture cited but 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.869
 they always have to work side by side 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.149
 side never suddenly put the car of 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.819
 sign because if you do not you will not be able to 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.810
 work and they are going to stick their fingers more 

00:01:56.819 --> 00:02:01.350
 that the paper 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.350
 there is 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.350
 we are withdrawing very good now we are going to 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.149
 take the module the mab quoted him there 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.310
 we have the sea I love this furniture if 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.950
 I am very beautiful this brought them Miguel 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:17.099
 from mexico to lovely furniture dating for 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:19.200
 save everything where everything goes to 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:22.080
 combine the animal print and the moles 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:25.290
 back one can 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.019
 paint or place paper only place 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.550
 paper and up we're going to put 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:32.550
 combine here let's play one can 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:36.180
 play then we're going to put this on 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:40.380
 front looks good there, perfectly there 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:42.420
 against straining there and it's very easy to 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:47.420
 all the people who are just getting started 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:49.459
 it's easy to fold 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:54.400
 so we have to have a plan of 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:54.400
 the cutting plate a good cutter 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:59.530
 and desire to work and really want to 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.530
 to work 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:09.200
 in the study of Miguel on Thursday 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.450
 then I'm in zárate in the ara 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.930
 dietetics 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:16.760
 and in private classes at home and 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:20.420
 I'm also in pacheco 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:23.930
 or whether they are all the pictures here 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:26.800
 let's combine now let's put the 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.800
 down here 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:30.880
 this line that is the modern model 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:34.210
 level 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:38.800
 is a line that has liked this a lot 

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:42.210
 also when one hurries there is what 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:45.060
 we mark well we turn it around again 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:47.140
 that is nothing 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.710
 it is cut 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.710
 there we are 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:56.020
 it's like it's a technique that 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:57.580
 quickly exactly here this stuck 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:59.380
 is what happens when you put it 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:03.460
 everywhere 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:05.320
 there is the paper of the dryer 

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:07.780
 hair exactly with a little bit of 

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:11.040
 good alcohol let's leave this is not 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:13.870
 does and I'm saying because if not after 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:16.400
 then we put this paper back 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:19.340
 from this side 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:22.820
 we put it 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:25.699
 and in a little while you can do this 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:28.280
 furniture also cited what he had to 

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:30.560
 comment is that the teaching staff of 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.389
 Miguel was usually not only here 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.970
 and on two sides 

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:37.070
 and you are an accredited teacher and when 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:38.900
 they do against casting there are many secrets 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:41.540
 of course many secrets 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:44.000
 no tips is easy for everyone but 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:46.760
 haiti for everyone is easy and I am a 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:53.060
 person who sees this the secrets to me 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:57.689
 Like some I keep only the contract 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:05:01.009
 just do not do not rest us then 

00:04:57.689 --> 00:05:01.009
 to get them well 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:07.140
 when we paint the boxes first 

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:10.500
 we paint and are the sellers always 

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:14.970
 before starting a job first what 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:17.850
 design and then I see the color then 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:20.940
 first paint is chosen with a sandpaper 

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:24.240
 number 150 and then you choose the color and 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:26.640
 everything is painted and then once 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:28.860
 does the counter-casting the same and then 

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:32.100
 they give in some touches the painting released 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:35.040
 according to a shading and here we go to 

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:37.710
 use the lines of 

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:41.129
 in the self-adhesive guards to see me 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:43.229
 what previously white 

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:45.760
 then here what can be done is 

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:48.070
 take out yes 

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:50.230
 there is what I wanted to comment 

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:51.640
 important of self-adhesive guards 

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:55.750
 that is applying alicia that are 

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:58.540
 barbarians for all retouch or cover 

00:05:55.750 --> 00:06:01.480
 some pasta some mistake some 

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:03.900
 Loose termination I place here in the 

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:03.900
 edge 

00:06:04.009 --> 00:06:12.680
 let's put the malice and the lace 

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:15.640
 there we are and we are putting and 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.640
 combining 

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:20.360
 what I'm going to do as we have a 

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:22.070
 Minutito is to bring these boxes with me 

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:24.800
 things that I love to show because the 

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:26.810
 true that we combine them with extras is 

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:30.040
 that is while it ends alicia the 

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:34.220
 work they see it as it is quickly 

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:37.580
 insert a drawer in a minute there 

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:41.940
 it's there and there are also the 

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:45.310
 little girls that you can combine 

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:48.100
 where I put it, we're going to put 

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:49.750
 career before following what I wanted 

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:51.370
 show them is that they were 

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:53.470
 watching white look at the black of 

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:55.270

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:58.990
 shines here put extras 

00:06:57.070 --> 00:07:01.380
