looking to get his head up he's looking

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.830 
looking to get his head up he's looking
for<00:00:41.460> a<00:00:41.520> cutback<00:00:41.879> that's<00:00:42.239> why<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.450> defender

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
for a cutback that's why the defender

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.540 
for a cutback that's why the defender
and<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.170> other<00:00:43.290> way<00:00:43.469> and<00:00:43.860> then<00:00:44.160> that<00:00:44.370> makes

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
and the other way and then that makes

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.100 
and the other way and then that makes
the<00:00:44.700> goal<00:00:44.850> keep<00:00:45.059> a<00:00:45.090> good<00:00:45.329> finish<00:00:45.660> and<00:00:45.690> great<00:00:46.020> to

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
the goal keep a good finish and great to

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.330 
the goal keep a good finish and great to
see<00:00:46.260> him<00:00:46.350> on<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.500> score<00:00:46.739> sheet<00:00:46.770> should<00:00:47.250> have

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
see him on the score sheet should have

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.029 
see him on the score sheet should have
been<00:00:47.430> a<00:00:47.460> penalty<00:00:47.820> this<00:00:48.780> but<00:00:49.050> not<00:00:49.320> given<00:00:49.800> I

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
been a penalty this but not given I

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.470 
been a penalty this but not given I
think<00:00:50.340> it<00:00:50.550> might<00:00:50.730> affect<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.090> game<00:00:51.270> the

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
think it might affect the game the

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.119 
think it might affect the game the
penalty<00:00:53.719> to<00:00:54.719> get<00:00:54.840> back<00:00:55.020> up<00:00:55.230> when<00:00:55.469> he<00:00:55.890> hasn't<00:00:56.010> at

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
penalty to get back up when he hasn't at

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.740 
penalty to get back up when he hasn't at
the<00:00:56.219> moment<00:00:56.460> at<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.579> referee<00:00:56.969> not<00:00:57.239> so<00:00:57.420> happy
