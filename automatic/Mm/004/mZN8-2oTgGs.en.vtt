got so lucky so many times and I take it
as<00:01:39.060> a<00:01:39.090> sign<00:01:39.210> now<00:01:39.600> that<00:01:39.840> whenever<00:01:40.079> I<00:01:40.319> get<00:01:40.560> super

00:01:40.879 --> 00:01:40.889 
as a sign now that whenever I get super

00:01:40.889 --> 00:01:42.649 
as a sign now that whenever I get super
lucky<00:01:41.189> it<00:01:41.369> just<00:01:41.549> means<00:01:41.759> that<00:01:41.909> I'm<00:01:42.270> on<00:01:42.479> my<00:01:42.630> way
