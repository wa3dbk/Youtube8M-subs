redstone here here here here and here
this<00:00:37.590> makes<00:00:37.860> a<00:00:38.040> randomizer<00:00:38.780> which<00:00:39.780> you<00:00:39.989> can

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
this makes a randomizer which you can

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.500 
this makes a randomizer which you can
tell<00:00:40.410> that<00:00:40.710> it<00:00:41.010> works<00:00:41.219> cited<00:00:41.610> i'm<00:00:41.969> using<00:00:42.210> this
