my you know future yes will not be what

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.260 
my you know future yes will not be what
motivates<00:01:04.409> you<00:01:04.860> because<00:01:04.890> if<00:01:05.670> you've<00:01:05.909> gotten

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
motivates you because if you've gotten

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.910 
motivates you because if you've gotten
to<00:01:06.390> this<00:01:06.510> point<00:01:06.780> you<00:01:07.320> know<00:01:07.439> you've<00:01:07.710> already

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
to this point you know you've already

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.560 
to this point you know you've already
made<00:01:08.280> that<00:01:08.520> first<00:01:08.700> step<00:01:08.970> and<00:01:09.090> you<00:01:09.180> found<00:01:09.420> that

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
made that first step and you found that

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.750 
made that first step and you found that
consistency<00:01:10.290> but<00:01:10.650> I<00:01:10.860> think<00:01:11.280> it's<00:01:11.430> deeper<00:01:11.729> than

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
consistency but I think it's deeper than

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.910 
consistency but I think it's deeper than
that<00:01:11.939> so<00:01:12.270> I<00:01:12.299> might<00:01:12.540> ask<00:01:12.659> you<00:01:12.990> what<00:01:13.470> is<00:01:13.650> your

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
that so I might ask you what is your

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.050 
that so I might ask you what is your
fitness<00:01:14.630> mission<00:01:15.630> statement<00:01:16.549> so<00:01:17.549> some<00:01:17.970> people

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
might say that and say ok basically

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.070
