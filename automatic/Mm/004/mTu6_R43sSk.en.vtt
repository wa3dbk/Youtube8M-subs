00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.030 
testing and games on the phone look
really<00:01:59.610> good<00:01:59.850> the<00:02:00.360> screen<00:02:00.930> resolution<00:02:01.890> is<00:02:01.979> the

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
really good the screen resolution is the

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.389 
really good the screen resolution is the
same<00:02:02.340> from<00:02:02.579> from<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.210> note<00:02:03.479> 1<00:02:03.840> but<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:04.860> screen

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
same from from the note 1 but the screen

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.730 
same from from the note 1 but the screen
is<00:02:05.549> actually<00:02:05.850> a<00:02:05.909> bigger<00:02:06.149> size<00:02:06.540> which<00:02:07.229> is<00:02:07.469> not

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
is actually a bigger size which is not

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.830 
is actually a bigger size which is not
really<00:02:08.039> noticeable<00:02:08.550> I<00:02:08.729> guess<00:02:08.970> from<00:02:09.690> the

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
really noticeable I guess from the
