00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:29.230

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:31.029
 heavy since the favors came with 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:33.640
 Antier families that were the party 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:37.000
 to be with them 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:39.190
 we had a slightly long flight of 22 50 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.420
 then get to the airport and we come 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.640
 here it 's like an hour and 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.559

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.649
 little bit the afternoon free I'm in 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:48.879

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.879
 relaxing resting a little bit I already 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:54.879
 He returned to training as one of the 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:56.769
 heads of this project what percentage 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:59.199
 you give miguel herrera about this 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:01.990
 going on how fast it will work 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:03.850
 all at least on the court 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:06.160
 the magnesium schalke is brought to that 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.010
 player is what are we going to go percentage 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:10.180
 important percentage is what 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.610
 we are actors we have is in the 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.710
 scenario are what make mourn the 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.900
 that make you laugh at joy for 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:19.000
 amateurs are the virtuosos of 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.950
 scenario obviously a director of 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.960
 orchestra that is what it is that in this 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.730
 case miguel herrera is very important not 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.620
 the tenor knows the touch he gives 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:29.200
 staff and anthill with those who makes 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:31.060
 many years and never never worked 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.330
 with him but I admire that he has 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.860
 a balance has a very good balance 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.660
 works very well the court is a 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.460
 squad that works the tactics very well 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:42.400
 on the court knows well has a great 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.380
 technical body as bathrooms I say diego 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.550
 It's terrible but being an angel is a 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.590
 extraordinary work in the physical 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:51.080
 and that combines it a lot with the group 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:55.280
 human because he has played gives you confidence 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:58.250
 a tutor becomes a mentor for them 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.500
 they ask him for advice he jokes with them 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.540
 gives his wish when the business of 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.150
 word catches your attention then 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.170
 the player receives justice from 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.000
 coach I think it has been very 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.550
 congruent in its decisions of the list 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.650
 in the decisions that you have taken 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.290
 very difficult is a complicated example of 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:18.020
 the alignment to start global then 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.580
 all that security and that justice that 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.190
 the player sends in what he says and 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.410
 does that congruence and consistency 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.450
 It has been very important because the group 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.100
 be united, be happy and very 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.530
 committed today that seems to 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.390
 you the this boom that is having 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.850
 the louse already in the world before in the 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.560
 america and the league now already in the 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:38.900
 world not in all the newspapers their 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.850
 celebrations with cocktails for stress like 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.310
 managers the truth is that I have a 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:45.250
 very good relationship with people we have made 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.660
 a great balance if a lot and now more 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:50.180
 endured is a personality is a 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:52.640
 character has a nice character 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.970
 he has a lot of empathy with people 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.380
 that is very nice 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.360
 talk with all the people ask them 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:02.290
 makes him laugh jokes 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:05.189
 let's go is the people with a 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:07.120
 interest is emotional very very very 

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:08.650
 important as people begin to 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.319
 become fond of the pse that falls in love with 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.939
 he sees how he lives they see the passion he has 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:15.159
 for the party they see how to enjoy the 

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:16.659
 goals wins and how he gets angry 

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:19.390
 when things are not right with the 

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:21.700
 players with the referee or in some in 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:25.269
 some action and that conveys to people 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:27.810
 that passion transmits that joy that 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:30.400
 love or that difficult moment or heart 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.530
 or anger and people have been 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.720
 infected everyone is also a great 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:38.079
 professional and is a great human being and 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:40.569
 all that brings together that this is also linked 

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:42.549
 with the results of procter comes the 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:44.379
 key match to give that first 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:46.689
 objective that was drawn that was to arrive 

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:48.519
 to the famous fifth party that Tabarez 

00:03:46.689 --> 00:03:50.650
 holland one of the perhaps teams 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:52.209
 what better have they been playing in achieving 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.819
 the world what do you think this is not 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:56.019
 a is a very complicated match is a 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:58.209
 great team has great 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:04:00.879
 individualities also has its 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:02.680
 weaknesses and good in the strength of 

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:05.019
 the offensive they have have three 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.269
 future cracks that are of care but 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:08.860
 they also have points that the 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:10.720
 coaching staff will analyze 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.430
 with the videos with the trainings and 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.110
 with the talks there will be supports that 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.480
 they can attack like they did with 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:17.500
 brazil with curves and with cameroon maybe 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:19.239
