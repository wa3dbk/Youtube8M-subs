00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
really problematic is chips and crackers

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.840 
really problematic is chips and crackers
so<00:02:11.989> you<00:02:12.989> know<00:02:13.080> obviously

so you know obviously
eating<00:02:14.060> chips<00:02:14.300> is<00:02:15.130> really<00:02:16.130> odd<00:02:16.310> calories<00:02:16.970> and

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
eating chips is really odd calories and

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.290 
eating chips is really odd calories and
fat<00:02:18.010> crackers<00:02:19.010> can<00:02:19.220> can<00:02:19.580> be<00:02:19.610> pretty<00:02:19.850> bad<00:02:20.030> too

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
fat crackers can can be pretty bad too

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:21.700 
fat crackers can can be pretty bad too
and<00:02:20.540> they're<00:02:20.660> easy<00:02:20.840> to<00:02:20.930> snack<00:02:21.260> on<00:02:21.290> they're

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:21.710 
and they're easy to snack on they're

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:24.130 
and they're easy to snack on they're
salty<00:02:22.100> and<00:02:22.280> you<00:02:22.490> just<00:02:22.640> kind<00:02:22.880> of<00:02:23.050> you<00:02:24.050> don't

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
salty and you just kind of you don't

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.890 
salty and you just kind of you don't
even<00:02:24.260> realize<00:02:24.770> that<00:02:25.420> you're<00:02:26.420> going<00:02:26.660> through

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.320 

there's<00:02:34.100> there's<00:02:34.460> people<00:02:34.610> that<00:02:34.760> have<00:02:34.880> been

one probably had cheese and who knows
why<00:02:54.530> down<00:02:54.590> there<00:02:54.920> so<00:02:55.360> you<00:02:56.360> know<00:02:56.450> you<00:02:56.540> really

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
why down there so you know you really

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.540 
why down there so you know you really
got<00:02:56.870> to<00:02:56.900> focus<00:02:57.080> on<00:02:57.350> the<00:02:57.500> big<00:02:57.890> picture<00:02:58.280> as<00:02:58.400> far

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.550 
got to focus on the big picture as far

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:01.930 
got to focus on the big picture as far
as<00:02:59.590> food<00:03:00.590> vegetables<00:03:00.890> legumes<00:03:01.430> and<00:03:01.880> whole

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
as food vegetables legumes and whole

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.330 
as food vegetables legumes and whole
grains<00:03:02.330> and<00:03:02.630> it's<00:03:03.500> really<00:03:03.710> that<00:03:03.890> simple

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
grains and it's really that simple

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:05.890 
grains and it's really that simple
if<00:03:04.700> you<00:03:05.060> if<00:03:05.300> you<00:03:05.390> think<00:03:05.420> about<00:03:05.690> all<00:03:05.780> the

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
if you if you think about all the

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.890 
if you if you think about all the
cookbooks<00:03:06.080> and<00:03:06.470> websites<00:03:06.920> and<00:03:07.190> just<00:03:07.900> the

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
cookbooks and websites and just the

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.690 
cookbooks and websites and just the
complexity<00:03:09.410> and<00:03:09.530> the<00:03:09.800> science<00:03:10.400> and<00:03:10.550> the

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
complexity and the science and the

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.070 
complexity and the science and the
questions<00:03:11.330> about<00:03:11.480> what<00:03:11.690> you<00:03:11.810> should<00:03:11.960> be

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080 
questions about what you should be

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.480 
questions about what you should be
eating<00:03:13.780> and<00:03:14.780> it<00:03:15.440> just<00:03:15.620> it<00:03:15.890> just<00:03:15.950> boils<00:03:16.340> down<00:03:16.370> to

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:16.490 
eating and it just it just boils down to

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:18.100 
eating and it just it just boils down to
those<00:03:16.760> four<00:03:16.940> things<00:03:17.150> I<00:03:17.390> mean<00:03:17.540> it's<00:03:17.690> it<00:03:17.900> I

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
those four things I mean it's it I

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:19.930 
those four things I mean it's it I
create<00:03:19.010> these<00:03:19.100> meals<00:03:19.340> that<00:03:19.490> are<00:03:19.550> like<00:03:19.760> a

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
create these meals that are like a

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.790 
create these meals that are like a
couple<00:03:20.360> of<00:03:20.600> ingredients<00:03:21.140> baked<00:03:21.290> fries<00:03:21.560> and

and but I just find that people are
really<00:03:48.280> having<00:03:49.280> trouble<00:03:49.400> to<00:03:49.760> really<00:03:50.300> identify

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 
really having trouble to really identify

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.160 
really having trouble to really identify
what<00:03:52.190> their<00:03:52.490> issues<00:03:52.970> are<00:03:53.180> they<00:03:53.870> might<00:03:54.050> think

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.170 
what their issues are they might think

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:56.080 
what their issues are they might think
they're<00:03:54.320> doing<00:03:54.530> everything<00:03:54.740> right

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
they're doing everything right

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:15.930 
that then you then you're looking at the

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:18.590 
that then you then you're looking at the
higher<00:05:16.140> ant<00:05:16.470> range<00:05:16.770> of<00:05:17.040> the<00:05:17.130> calories<00:05:17.600> density

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:18.600 
higher ant range of the calories density

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.680 
higher ant range of the calories density
scale<00:05:18.840> so<00:05:19.110> that<00:05:19.260> would<00:05:19.410> be<00:05:19.560> flowers<00:05:20.490> and<00:05:21.060> you

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:21.690 
scale so that would be flowers and you

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:24.380 
scale so that would be flowers and you
know<00:05:21.780> obviously<00:05:22.050> not<00:05:22.320> see<00:05:22.620> ona<00:05:23.180> reduce<00:05:24.180> though

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:24.390 
know obviously not see ona reduce though

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:29.540 
know obviously not see ona reduce though
is<00:05:24.600> quite<00:05:24.810> a<00:05:24.840> bit<00:05:25.160> and<00:05:26.240> then<00:05:27.240> and<00:05:27.540> then<00:05:27.690> the<00:05:28.550> you

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:29.550 
is quite a bit and then and then the you

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:31.220 
is quite a bit and then and then the you
know<00:05:29.640> even<00:05:29.940> lowering<00:05:30.330> the<00:05:30.420> starch<00:05:30.690> a<00:05:30.870> bit<00:05:31.050> and

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:31.230 
know even lowering the starch a bit and

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:32.990 
know even lowering the starch a bit and
having<00:05:31.500> more<00:05:31.590> vegetables<00:05:32.160> but<00:05:32.400> making<00:05:32.970> sure

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:34.980 
that you're still ciated so you could

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:37.670 
that you're still ciated so you could
move<00:05:35.160> down<00:05:35.190> towards<00:05:35.820> the<00:05:36.660> lower<00:05:36.810> end<00:05:37.080> of<00:05:37.290> you
