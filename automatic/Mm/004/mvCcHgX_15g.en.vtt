00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.339

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:09.179
 and come back doing a video lesson to 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:10.769
 You are about how to access the diploma is 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.580
 I will not stay in x of the question 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:21.150
 it is because it is a very tense subject of 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:22.470
 controversial pm with many stories and I 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.580
 I'm going straight to the point and I'll show you 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:29.429
 How do you get there? 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.929
 truth is the CÃ³mbita available for 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.489
 you access you can access from 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.100
 any browser from anywhere and 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.260
 with internet access 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.700
 if you need anything or just browsing 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.640
 and internet access 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.590
 but what we do is protect yourself, and we 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.820
 so besides you 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:50.160
 good, it 's always good to have an antivirus 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:54.420
 updated and used it even though I 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.379
 I just wanted to handle the message but could 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.710
 be any moment 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:03.690
 yeah, we 'll use a program called 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:06.330
 Right touch it will help us 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:11.040
 the iaaf how only he will even offer himself 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:12.630
 a support is for whoever wants to go bag 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.150
 to see that this is not only useful for 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.009
 indicated ebs is not even good for any 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.189
 thing you want to navigate anonymously 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.049
 on the internet to access any page 

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:25.080
 anonymously 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:28.439
 You can use the top and will use the 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:31.409
 own camouflaged internet nobody know 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:34.170
 sony teacher had to debut 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.549
 ok it is a good way to protect 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.920
 electronic processing 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:42.180
 in fact there is another way of 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:47.360
 ways but returns and to our children 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:50.430
 90% normal uses the topic to be practical is 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.860
 easy simple and very efficient 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.290
 if you put there a rotor download 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.270
 you will find this page to a low 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.810
 I commented in downtown that with a bag 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.189
 down now you know that microsoft 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.259
 You have Portuguese that you put 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.470
 portuguese and download linense 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.050
 keep flowing 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:12.370
 Sings to the smartphone but I 've never used it. 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:13.840
 smartphone is already downloaded so as not to lose 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.990
 time with this site victory is very 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:20.100
 slow I'm having a drink here a lot 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:23.680
 in New York wine so the principality 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:26.530
 Are you really going to be compacted? 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.690
 you will get 12 run will extract 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.040
 There is already a shoe here that I did 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:34.270
 right here 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:37.450
 You 're just remembering it's not illegal. 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:40.330
 Code access is legal and illegal 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:42.130
 some content that has more like 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:48.970
 anywhere in the world if you know 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:50.380
 filter a punch you see and make you go 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:55.780
 If you leave a lot, there's a lot of cool stuff. 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:59.290
 interesting tutorials also have a lot of 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:01.570
 bad thing but it's nothing of that 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.810
 people have been talking to a 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:05.170
 seven heads actually looks like it's a 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:09.100
 underworld 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:11.470
 Actually, it 's only right, but it 's only if you 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.540
 Look for if you surf on the good as 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:17.380
 Do you surf the internet? You'll find 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:19.450
 a lot of cool, it's the only thing is 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:23.620
 It's very difficult, you'll get it. 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:26.080
 find the links cool sites so at 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.540
 Sometimes it's good, you get in touch with 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:30.730
 someone who already knows more because it is not 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.890
 how google so you go there puts it 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.420
 find a fucking thing that you 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:34.930
 need to be more or less hot with 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.610
 ego 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:39.130
 You'll see I'm not going to dig deeper. 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:41.049
 much on the subject 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.730
 He has a search engine that I'll go later. 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:44.320
 show it to you but anyway he 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:49.260
 still can not negotiate all the 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:53.400
 pages that adp is a very 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:54.760
 dynamics so many pages are 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.430
 private 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:00.489
 anyway how soon stop talking is 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:04.620
 Agent distracted here right? 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:07.770
 we just click here to be bronze 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:10.260
 access 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:13.820
 He's going to be setting it up there. 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.820
 start a browser to us 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:20.010
 only remembering here when you use proxy 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:23.220
 in any way whatsoever that 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:27.210
 be configured 10 touch by setting 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:27.990
 usually your internet gets very 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:31.110
 slow 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:32.910
 It's because he's the one he uses. 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:35.130
 as an intermediary instead of leaving 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:40.170
 direct to the content it will pass through 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:43.590
 several steps so several places 

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:46.200
 different than what it would be 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:56.580
 conventional mode for example or show 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:59.340
 here to show you just here 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:01.230
 and here 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:04.590
 I just forgot to mention this one is ours. 

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:06.870
 Brazil is very similar to chrome 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:09.900
 sorry firefox is actually the same 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:12.120
 only thing is the bronze 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:15.030
 It's just important to remember, I'll show you 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.570
 You now have to access this 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:17.010
 page 

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:19.290
 here for example I have a clear 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:21.060
 approach also installed but drogba the 

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:25.200
 internet explorer just access here 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:28.290
 I'll prove it for you. 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:30.540
 identifying the ip is different if you 

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:34.160
 change your own for your computer 

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:34.160
 it will change a lot 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:44.490
 how can I say it will change the 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:46.020
 machine and the whole machine here neither 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:49.500
 when we return to its fashion of 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:51.930
 browsers is good also because it 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:53.520
 Are you accessing the web as it stands? 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:54.930
 slow you go there and you can 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.820
 access the regular content 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:59.630
 for example here you can see ip 

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:59.630
 right 

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:07.719
 in the mean real time 

00:06:02.139 --> 00:06:08.979
 I came here now and I'm going now by the seal 

00:06:07.719 --> 00:06:16.029
 top 

00:06:08.979 --> 00:06:19.919
 let's see how that's kind p're there 

00:06:16.029 --> 00:06:19.919
 Seeing that it is completely different 

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:26.710
 He is with one foot from another country. 

00:06:22.439 --> 00:06:33.909
 I do not know exactly what this is for 

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:38.560
 here is just network advertising you 

00:06:33.909 --> 00:06:43.689
 can see where the whole 

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:47.250
 mess is so important 

00:06:43.689 --> 00:06:49.659
 they can see here I'm camouflaged 

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:52.150
 even he shows pec when he 

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:53.860
 It ends if you want to be sure 

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:56.949
 here's the ip 

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:59.379
 if I speak in my firefox you can see how 

00:06:56.949 --> 00:07:02.289
 different peta does not have to pay 

00:06:59.379 --> 00:07:04.089
 attention to the adepts and sandra of stone 

00:07:02.289 --> 00:07:10.509
 You do not want to go there, it's going to work. 

00:07:04.089 --> 00:07:12.039
 nothing the authors use here is good 

00:07:10.509 --> 00:07:15.639
 now we are ready to 

00:07:12.039 --> 00:07:17.529
 access the web as I said it is 

00:07:15.639 --> 00:07:21.300
 very hard to find you have 

00:07:17.529 --> 00:07:24.550
 Seek out forum and is 

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:28.870
 other portuguese forum search is from 

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:31.599
 generally and through them you go 

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:35.080
 Finding the links because it's kind of chatinho 

00:07:31.599 --> 00:07:37.949
 to think that I have this show raise 

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:37.949
 rather the source 

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:46.190
 this is a search engine here which is 16 more 

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:48.440
 used but one is known but like me 

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:56.990
 I spoke and can not index all the 

00:07:48.440 --> 00:08:03.560
 pages of the whole soul here subscribe 

00:07:56.990 --> 00:08:06.410
