00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.470
 having done a long period of telling 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.390

 win it with the controller 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:18.530
 movements of new 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.490
 those who know often are 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.110
 such a possibility and actually between 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.010
 the way hall 3 is the first hardcore group 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:28.100
 who were not afraid to attach support

 magic rod usa eric as far as 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.350

 try out the novelty and share with you 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.940
 impressions 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.450
 launching this classic joke 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.420
 helped take with distrust it's all 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.860
 still not balls give yourself serious but 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.040
 this form of government is more convenient 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.800
 expected enough for a couple 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.500
 positions rid sensitivity and 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.510
 dock sight relate across the screen 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:03.260
 recharge is made easy by the cook 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.440
 dentists and to knock out the door or 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.220
 offend the enemy butt must be slightly 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.569
 throw hand forward 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.159
 thank god to be frank 

00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:12.590
 flirting with the controller 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.789
 developers slide down 

00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:16.959
 let's say climbing on the stairs to wave 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:19.959
 hands unnecessary 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:23.159
 manages the tour element shoot from 

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:25.249
 all sorts of weapons and fight your neighbor 

00:02:25.249 --> 00:02:27.349
 fighting with the bridge is a pleasure 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:29.909
 let for a casual observer player 

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:32.329
 wielding Kokoy glowing stick for 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:34.129
 it doesn't matter to him 

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:35.700
 so he engages with 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.999
 happening 

00:02:37.999 --> 00:02:39.919
 because the game itself is not easy 

00:02:39.919 --> 00:02:41.859
 significant help will be 

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:43.449
 additional controller for 

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:45.599
 movement although you can 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:47.369
 get by with a simple gamepad 

00:02:47.369 --> 00:02:49.089
 the only situations in which 

00:02:49.089 --> 00:02:51.579
 mmvb can bring money you give in your hands 

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:53.070
 sniper rifle 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.120
 then missed and killed once another 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.500
 imbued with respect for those from whom 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.719
 hand does not tremble and who shoots without a miss 

00:03:00.719 --> 00:03:02.989
 speak for more accurate shooting very 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:04.789
 helps special rifle 

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:07.789
 but we have not been given such 

00:03:13.529 --> 00:03:15.889
 important advice to all those who decide to take place in 

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:18.289
 band 3 with music 

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:19.779
 turn off and vibration 

00:03:19.779 --> 00:03:21.519
 each shot will be followed 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:22.619
 characteristic universities 

00:03:22.619 --> 00:03:25.159
 which will shoot down the scope itself we went out 

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:26.619
 sea â€‹â€‹on the scene when you need to manage 

00:03:26.619 --> 00:03:29.619
 huge walking robots 

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:42.949
 perhaps the only case 

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:44.930
 lack could this impossibility as 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:47.059
 talked in the same kitchen will play 

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:47.999
 increased 

00:03:47.999 --> 00:03:50.199
 as opposed to a number to keep control on 

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:52.559
 arm outstretched cube how uneasy 

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:54.689
 true faithful couch I stubbornly elbow in 

00:03:54.689 --> 00:03:57.509
 knee saves the day 

00:03:57.509 --> 00:04:00.119
 tel zones 3 is definitely worth trying in 

00:04:00.119 --> 00:04:02.659
 combination with 0 is a new sensation and 

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:05.229
 completely different degree of immersion in the process 

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:07.209
 In addition, it is a serious challenge 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:09.419
 quite like brothers import for the first time after 

00:04:09.419 --> 00:04:10.229
 above 

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:12.639
 however, as is the case with the latter 

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:14.320
 you quickly get used to the direction 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:15.780
 surprisingly day or 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.430
 often prefers to play 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.850
 tennis 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.040
 not only in single player mode but also 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.920
 on the net and our subjective assessment 

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:24.160
 October is growing compared to the past 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.950
 a cent on the whole three tenths points never 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:29.070
 still kasiche I was able to 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.620
 fascinatingly
