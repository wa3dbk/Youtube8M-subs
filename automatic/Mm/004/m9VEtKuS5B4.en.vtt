00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.490
 hello in this video we see the units from 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.589
 send in missions zg 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.260
 let's start with light infantry le 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:13.440
 four basic units that you will have after a few 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:17.070
 days all go well and represent 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.800
 the way to start kicking le 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.990
 units, however, always ideal infantry 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.660
 I'm the sniper explorer for 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.119
 the defensive missions and the command for 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:31.019
 offensive missions because this 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.759
 because the concept that there must be 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.420
 clear to all is what exists one 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:38.750
 taiji bank or a system holds 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.969
 account of all the units you lose 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:45.270
 calculate the resources that are worth these 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:49.410
 unity and the moment you repay 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:52.949
 that is, you always lose a unit value 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:55.469
 expressed resources equal to or higher than the 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:58.199
 last reward express receipt 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.480
 always resources then the probability of 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.969
 being rewarded will go up to 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.850
 drastically, however, to try 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.860
 command explorer are better 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:12.810
 the other concept we need to understand is 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:15.630
 that of the ratio between cost in units 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.470
 iniquitous its resources of every unity and time 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.330
 of production 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.090
 let's take a quick sniper example 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:25.020
 explorer costs us 200 two hundred 120 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:27.350
 for a total of 520 resources and to gods 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.450
 production time of 7 minutes 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.520
 let's take a light defensive infantry 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.490
 for example light sniper that there 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:39.810
 it costs 90 fuel 60 ammo 42 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:42.840
 nations or 192 resources against 520 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.600
 it takes four and a half minutes then 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.720
 two light snipers or a little less than 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.390
 400 resources take longer than one 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.520
 single explorer sniper and this is it 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.070
 the reason for making cecchin 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:59.969
 explorers is ideal if you want 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:02.810
 we must make sea zg or search 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:06.630
 as soon as possible to have units from 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:09.750
 crash zg to repay ours 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.280
 debt to the bank towards zg or 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:15.220
 for 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:18.989
 speed up this to speed up 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.230
 this payment quaestors say 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:22.269
 here we go 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.430
 same kind speech for what 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:26.080
 concerns riflemen or reconnaissance here 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.780
 if you make two accounts one more from 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:32.290
 reconnaissance takes 8 minutes per 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:36.010
 be produced and value in resources e 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:39.310
 520 a commando simply employs 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:41.910
 ten minutes but has a resource value is 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.810
 clearly higher or 1300 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.640
 heavy infantry 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.160
 same speech made for the infantry 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.920
 light the four base units go 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:53.079
 always good there are no problems 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:55.299
 built, however, in this case we have 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:03:02.200
 for offensive missions i 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:03:04.659
 4200 paratroopers plus 1200 farci 5.400 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:08.590
 resources for a single skydiver who 

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:11.709
 it takes 45 minutes to compare it 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:14.609
 with heavy jack it always takes 45 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:18.819
 minutes but its resource value is of 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:21.130
 3500 20 or a third and less and this 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:23.410
 always with a view to producing 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:24.910
 mass and the times in which one wants 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.489
 concluding zg is fundamental 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:29.440
 importance 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:31.870
 I repeat, whatever you build is fine 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:35.950
 if you want to optimize parachutists 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:39.280
 the ideal armored vehicle units here 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.900
 we have forced choices there are two 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.079
 defensive vehicles the two vehicles 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.970
 offensive in this case the report 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:48.910
 production cost production time 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.980
 it is practically identical 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:53.769
 generally the difference is made by the 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.269
 rations if you have rations to use 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:58.150
 then maybe it's better to build i 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:04:00.220
 zama creditors if you can 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:01.079
 what a bad indicator you are the choice 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.569
 optimal 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:07.480
 let's move on to aviation we have here 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:10.780
 the only defensive unit to do is the 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:13.750
 fire brake as hail like 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:16.359
 see it requires thulium and the thou 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:18.849
 let's say it's not worth a high value a 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:22.390
 atac ag level always comes 

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:24.659
 however considered a hail is worth little 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:30.639
 less than 4 thousand resources 

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:32.199
 against the well over 7,500 of the times great times 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:34.180
 of production then of thulium units 

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:37.659
 they are usually much higher 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:40.120
 then fire drake the whole life the 

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:42.939
 particular speech for drones , drones 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:45.460
 spy the imac 11 b have a value 

00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:46.780
 ridiculous defensive that tell ai 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:49.120
 ends of the bank 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:51.909
 so if you find yourself with so many drones e 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.949
 you have to tell us to pay fast 

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:57.129
 due the interest you have lost 

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:59.919
 burkhardt hg you can easily 

00:04:57.129 --> 00:05:02.800
 crash these drones with units 

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:05.259
 instead we have the moac and ethan offensive 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:07.449
 in the for of a blood perspective of 

00:05:05.259 --> 00:05:10.270
 perfectionism the moac would go 

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:14.919
 used only to raid thunder 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:18.490
 just to make zg or attacks at the end 

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:20.529
 when he rewards you with 500 1000 2000 a 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:23.199
 depending on the emissions and completed is 

00:05:20.529 --> 00:05:25.210
 obvious that you will have to use them and it 

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:29.919
 do it without problems 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:31.870
 in our talk of the cost ratio 

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:34.180
 production protection time 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:35.529
 the best unit paradoxically the yan 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:38.560
 200 

00:05:35.529 --> 00:05:39.879
 this too is united, we say then 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:42.370
 they could turn up their noses because 

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:47.110
 this very fast news goes to 30 km 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:49.180
 schedules has a fair capacity 750 yes 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:51.129
 should use mostly for 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:54.610
 racial look at production times 

00:05:51.129 --> 00:05:58.210
 It is an hour and 53 minutes the value 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:06:00.370
 resources of the union 18.200 we go to 

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:02.080
 compare it for example with the moac that 

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:05.289
 has a value almost identical 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:08.129
 19,000, however, requires a good two hours and 51 

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:10.529
 minutes to be produced 

00:06:08.129 --> 00:06:14.509
 not to mention the thunderhead that 

00:06:10.529 --> 00:06:17.239
 it takes three and a half hours between everything and 

00:06:14.509 --> 00:06:20.580
 24,200 is its value therefore the yan 

00:06:17.239 --> 00:06:22.630
 definitely the best unit to stop 

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:25.300
 zg 

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:27.460
 the units deserve a special mention 

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:31.270
 strategic syndacat units e 

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:33.700
 mercenaries say that this unit does not 

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:36.310
 they therefore have a resource value for the purpose 

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:38.800
 of the bank do not count that is zero if 

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:41.590
 lose 10 zam will not come 

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:43.090
 considered you get lost and just worse me 

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:45.160
 feel with strategic unity 

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:46.810
 buying them with diamonds 

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:49.000
 also this year, however, a value in 

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:54.040
 resources 0 and do not compete for the purposes of 

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:56.710
 bank zg therefore mercenaries from mine 

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:59.280
 advice is absolutely to avoid 

00:06:56.710 --> 00:07:03.130
 use strategic syndicate unit 

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:04.720
 to raise to repay the bank this 

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:07.560
 it's an Italy, but you can use it 

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:10.780
 when very few units remained 

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:13.900
 in the zg mission and you must close it 

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:17.260
 quickly in that case cerberus 12 zamos 

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:19.450
 even zero makes little difference and ve 

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:21.900
 You can afford and hello 

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:21.900
 next
