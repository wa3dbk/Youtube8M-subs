have<00:00:07.890> a<00:00:07.919> swarm<00:00:08.550> that<00:00:08.670> said<00:00:09.000> a<00:00:09.030> Satsuma<00:00:09.660> tree

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:12.440 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.620 

last<00:00:13.440> year<00:00:13.740> we<00:00:13.889> should<00:00:14.099> from<00:00:14.700> this<00:00:14.820> very<00:00:15.089> same

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
last year we should from this very same

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.900 
last year we should from this very same
tree<00:00:18.199> three<00:00:19.199> and<00:00:19.320> a<00:00:19.350> half<00:00:19.500> four<00:00:19.740> feet<00:00:19.770> a<00:00:20.310> little

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.420 
tree three and a half four feet a little
bit<00:00:21.029> higher<00:00:21.270> this<00:00:21.539> year<00:00:22.070> we're<00:00:23.070> thinking<00:00:23.340> this

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
bit higher this year we're thinking this

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.490 
bit higher this year we're thinking this
one<00:00:23.699> maybe<00:00:24.000> it's<00:00:24.180> not<00:00:24.300> quite<00:00:24.359> as<00:00:24.720> a<00:00:24.750> being<00:00:25.080> okay

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
one maybe it's not quite as a being okay

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.560 
one maybe it's not quite as a being okay
but<00:00:25.949> we're<00:00:26.130> gonna<00:00:26.220> shake<00:00:26.490> this<00:00:26.670> one<00:00:29.420> the<00:00:30.420> other
