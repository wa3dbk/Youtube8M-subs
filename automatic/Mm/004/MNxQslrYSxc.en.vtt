00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.619
 I am 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.420
 and 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.379
 or that the sim suffers from two problems 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.960
 a problem of time a problem 

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:41.940
 d'europe 1 to whom is the ranger to 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.589
 teenagers to adults for your kids 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.530
 who like to do with a rib because we 

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:47.670
 can go from very dramatic scene 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.500
 downright violent and disturbing 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.449
 it's a Disney movie in which or 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.369
 villain opens the body of his enemy him 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.469
 eat the heart in front of his brother and 

00:00:53.369 --> 00:00:58.140
 on the other hand the plan after 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.000
 new ceded on this weekend there are 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.170
 really violent breaks in tone in 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.570
 the country that it's a shame because 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.060
 every part if we take them game 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.110
 separately they are well Serbian when 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.280
 it's a little darker it's good 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.810
 when it's a bit more mystical it's 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.330
 well when it's more really the spirit 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.560
 western is good the gags me 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.720
 it was really the part where I like 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.909
 less well it's a little bit limited 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.039
 but it's all mixed up as you say 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.000
 yeah that's great we do not know what they 

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:22.289
 want to show us 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.580
 there are tributes to the classics of 

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:25.080
 western that are well brought in for the 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.459
 narration is done by one of the characters 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.929
 that we find centenarian in the 

00:01:26.459 --> 00:01:29.549
 30s that tells so that brings back a 

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:31.440
 little little big man with dustin hoffman 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.429
 or something that bothered me marketing or 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.479
 sell by the way this is our tool of 

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:34.709
 French I believe the birth in 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.850
 the hÃ©rault yeah that's supposed to be 

00:01:34.709 --> 00:01:37.619
 original lone ranger 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.299
 where is his hero he is always 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.189
 ridiculous he's still clumsy the 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.229
 masked avenger is the Celtic of 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.060
 tonto it's not normal 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.590
 at first he's good it's the lawyer 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.810
 clumsy who discover the west and 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.250
 cetera in the end it is hardly different 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.899
 in part the formation the face at the moment 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.680
 where the hero wakes up the scenario of 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.930
 movie 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:02:11.370
 way too clumsy in my opinion for 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:12.959
 really hooked man's life it's 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.010
 still one of his best last 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.690
 role there he still does in his 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.760
 outsider characters a little weird 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.290
 but he pays more towards the douars 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.670
 in the hands of money or barnabas 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.860
 collins recently in dark shadows 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.720
 rather than the red way extrovert 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.100
 hood where jack sparrow that there he puts me 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.270
 very moving and it's been a long time 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.400
 I did not find anyway 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:30.959
 moving in a movie where I find it 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.280
 really feel good reminds a little the 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.570
 mute star a little keaton buster 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.459
 especially on the end a little bit 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.000
 know if armie hammer that we already could 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:41.400
 see so 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:43.140
 my dear leszek is excellent this is a 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.670
 comic character from start to finish and 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.650
 the most comic heroic 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.790
 despite all the fortune were those 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.170
 past of the magnificent and not necessarily 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.300
 written on the fact that learners 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.790
 william fichtner who plays budget men 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.770
 rich we had figured very nasty the 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.170
 Cannibal great feeling that's why 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:59.400
 fills up the hearts of people tompkins 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.170
 if you have seen him in all his films 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.680
 do the villain he plays the same 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.120
 character 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.950
 it's even that you had in all 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.560
 the other movies so he plays it well 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.450
 but well a little already seen ruth wilson 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.549
 this is the main actress have seen in 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.840
 fight character is badly written to my 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:15.090
 sense is the woman in distress 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.930
 we quickly forget the death for mary me 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.890
 I found 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:21.780
 to go with his brother-in-law amply 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:24.379
 it is especially his referral and cannibalism 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.760
 this soulful pop and humor is young 

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:36.329
 so the interpretation is still 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:38.790
 the strong point of the verbinski technique 

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:41.010
 nevertheless gradually as it evolves 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.689
 really its realization in walls 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.280
 mios and shoot in natural settings so 

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:46.230
 we find monument of valley lot east 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:49.569
 very well filmed me rebuild a real 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:51.120
 train and every oyster was really 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:53.590
 mu is by the way if you want to see a 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:57.489
 verbinski def with a good western 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:59.739
 successful it's the parenthesis the 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:01.900
 realization it's not the point made 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:03.639
 just steps away there is a new 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.349
 director the technicians behind me 

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:06.730
 it is nevertheless the top 10 is 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:08.769
 hollywood it's a movie that cost that 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.780
 $ 250 million of which we remained 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:12.909
 uncertain little excessive music 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:15.620
 of 6 dice is fine here you ennio 

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:19.130
 morricone the harmonicas 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:20.810
 we hear better and it fits very well 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.889
 well where for two hours of film is 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.360
 well the last half an hour 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:25.370
 prosecution and there is the choice that was 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.139
 it's weird in 10 years and 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.910
 the opening of guillaume tell de rossini 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:31.220
 but these musics very well known this bait 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:32.780
 dad was born for half an hour a 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:34.610
 founded what is a pity is that at the 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:36.470
 limit is that his anger is very good 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:37.910
 a second card disney spirit but 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:39.380
 know he should have put him some 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:41.720
 departures and its symbols 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:43.130
 the highlight of the film that it is in 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:45.680
 impression that there are several films 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:47.570
 in and they do not know which one we 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:51.560
 show which one we live in the end 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:54.760
 we have a mixture of all that and here we are 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.760
 a little lost in buying 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:12.130
 let's try to think lone ranger is a little 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:14.319
 patchwork movie victim of a genesis 

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:16.479
 complicated who did not know how to choose his 

00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:20.819
 time so the film struggles to take off for 

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:23.830
 me these five enemies on ten and watteau 

00:05:20.819 --> 00:05:25.900
 to me your early I thought it was 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:27.520
 a shame that the music part is 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:30.430
 a bit distant in nature 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:31.810
 we have a little bit with the cost of 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:32.740
 rabbits which was pretty good so we 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:34.449
 would have liked to see more 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:36.249
 after it's a little 

00:05:34.449 --> 00:05:38.380
 we do not know in which if they have 

00:05:36.249 --> 00:05:40.090
 as you said 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:42.100
 but despite all that remains like a 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:44.140
 very nice western with my singers 

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:47.070
 by good duo that works well so that 

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:47.070
 is going to be a 6 out of 10 what we have 

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:28.680
 pontault johnny depp in 1933 no but 

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:28.680
 it's not your skull now up there 

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:40.460
 the story of a masked hero with 

00:06:33.289 --> 00:06:40.460
 northwest far west with verbinski 

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:47.790
 sp zaw win win
