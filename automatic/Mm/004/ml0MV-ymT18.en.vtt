00:00:02.119 --> 00:00:02.129 
hi everyone this is Delta and in this

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:03.770 
hi everyone this is Delta and in this
video<00:00:02.460> I<00:00:02.520> will<00:00:02.700> show<00:00:02.939> you<00:00:02.970> how<00:00:03.330> to<00:00:03.360> make

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:03.780 
video I will show you how to make

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.829 
video I will show you how to make
cutters<00:00:04.470> your<00:00:05.279> own<00:00:05.490> cutters<00:00:05.940> and<00:00:06.210> especially

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
cutters your own cutters and especially

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:08.960 
cutters your own cutters and especially
circle<00:00:07.589> cutters<00:00:07.980> which<00:00:08.220> I<00:00:08.429> believe<00:00:08.760> are<00:00:08.940> the

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
circle cutters which I believe are the

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.480 
circle cutters which I believe are the
most<00:00:09.210> difficult<00:00:09.690> to<00:00:10.050> get<00:00:10.260> a<00:00:10.500> perfect<00:00:11.309> round

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
most difficult to get a perfect round

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.259 
most difficult to get a perfect round
shape<00:00:12.920> but<00:00:13.920> you<00:00:14.040> can<00:00:14.219> use<00:00:14.639> this<00:00:14.849> technique<00:00:15.059> to

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
shape but you can use this technique to

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.330 
shape but you can use this technique to
make<00:00:15.480> other<00:00:15.990> kind<00:00:16.410> of<00:00:16.529> cutters<00:00:16.980> of<00:00:17.010> course

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:19.340 
make other kind of cutters of course

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.769 
make other kind of cutters of course
okay<00:00:20.340> well<00:00:20.609> the<00:00:20.820> first<00:00:20.850> thing<00:00:21.270> we<00:00:21.449> will<00:00:21.600> not

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
okay well the first thing we will not

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.470 
okay well the first thing we will not
buys<00:00:22.050> you<00:00:22.289> is<00:00:22.529> to<00:00:22.769> get<00:00:23.130> all<00:00:23.550> the<00:00:23.880> lids<00:00:24.029> that<00:00:24.180> you

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
buys you is to get all the lids that you

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.200 
buys you is to get all the lids that you
can<00:00:24.660> find<00:00:24.990> and<00:00:25.800> usually<00:00:26.189> go<00:00:26.430> around<00:00:26.550> the<00:00:26.939> house

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
can find and usually go around the house

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.750 
can find and usually go around the house
getting<00:00:27.900> on<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.230> lids<00:00:28.439> from<00:00:28.699> products<00:00:29.699> that

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
getting on the lids from products that

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.930 
getting on the lids from products that
are<00:00:30.179> already<00:00:30.420> done<00:00:30.869> these<00:00:31.710> make<00:00:32.040> great<00:00:32.070> circle

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
are already done these make great circle

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.479 
are already done these make great circle
cutters<00:00:33.360> and<00:00:33.780> well<00:00:34.350> they<00:00:34.530> are<00:00:34.649> already<00:00:34.980> there

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
cutters and well they are already there

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.299 
cutters and well they are already there
but<00:00:36.210> sometimes<00:00:36.690> you<00:00:36.899> can<00:00:37.110> find<00:00:37.410> them<00:00:37.590> exactly

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
but sometimes you can find them exactly

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.720 
but sometimes you can find them exactly
for<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:39.030> exact<00:00:39.390> size<00:00:39.899> that<00:00:40.200> you<00:00:40.350> need<00:00:40.500> or<00:00:41.070> even

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
for the exact size that you need or even

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.220 
for the exact size that you need or even
if<00:00:41.850> you<00:00:41.940> haven't<00:00:42.300> set<00:00:42.510> like<00:00:42.719> this<00:00:42.960> which

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
if you haven't set like this which

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.880 
if you haven't set like this which
honestly<00:00:43.920> has<00:00:44.460> a<00:00:44.489> lot<00:00:44.760> of<00:00:44.910> sizes<00:00:45.559> for<00:00:46.559> some

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
honestly has a lot of sizes for some

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.279 
honestly has a lot of sizes for some
reason<00:00:47.340> most<00:00:47.879> of<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.180> time<00:00:48.390> I<00:00:48.600> need<00:00:48.840> this<00:00:49.050> site

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
reason most of the time I need this site

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.020 
reason most of the time I need this site
that<00:00:49.320> is<00:00:49.680> exactly<00:00:50.219> between<00:00:50.399> two<00:00:50.940> of<00:00:51.090> them<00:00:51.440> so

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
that is exactly between two of them so

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.420 
that is exactly between two of them so
well<00:00:54.030> I<00:00:54.059> do<00:00:54.239> always<00:00:54.539> will<00:00:54.960> find<00:00:55.500> something

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
well I do always will find something

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.110 
well I do always will find something
like<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.449> bottle<00:00:58.260> or<00:00:58.590> a<00:00:58.620> pen<00:00:58.920> or<00:00:59.219> a<00:00:59.250> marker<00:00:59.340> or

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
like a bottle or a pen or a marker or

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.420 
like a bottle or a pen or a marker or
whatever<00:01:00.989> round<00:01:01.230> shape<00:01:01.559> that<00:01:01.800> you<00:01:01.920> can<00:01:02.100> find

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
whatever round shape that you can find

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:08.719 
whatever round shape that you can find
in<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.969> size<00:01:03.300> that<00:01:03.510> you<00:01:03.719> need<00:01:03.750> and<00:01:07.340> some<00:01:08.340> sort

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
in the size that you need and some sort

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.440 
in the size that you need and some sort
of<00:01:08.939> aluminum<00:01:09.900> sheet<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:11.430> in<00:01:11.580> this<00:01:11.760> case<00:01:12.030> I<00:01:12.299> am

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
of aluminum sheet the in this case I am

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.350 
of aluminum sheet the in this case I am
using<00:01:12.479> some<00:01:13.260> fancy<00:01:14.360> industrial-strength

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
using some fancy industrial-strength

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.670 
using some fancy industrial-strength
aluminum<00:01:16.110> that<00:01:16.350> I<00:01:16.590> have<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.130> lock<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.580> find

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
aluminum that I have the lock to find

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.420 
aluminum that I have the lock to find
but<00:01:19.680> you<00:01:19.710> can<00:01:20.100> also<00:01:20.280> use<00:01:20.880> something<00:01:21.360> like<00:01:22.430> cam

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
but you can also use something like cam

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.539 
but you can also use something like cam
bottle<00:01:23.880> maybe<00:01:24.360> a<00:01:24.570> tray<00:01:25.140> or<00:01:25.409> a<00:01:25.470> pan<00:01:25.860> that<00:01:25.890> is<00:01:26.310> a

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
bottle maybe a tray or a pan that is a

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.870 
bottle maybe a tray or a pan that is a
slightly<00:01:26.909> thicker<00:01:27.330> or<00:01:28.040> the<00:01:29.040> leads<00:01:29.280> that<00:01:29.579> come

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
slightly thicker or the leads that come

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.200 
slightly thicker or the leads that come
in<00:01:30.150> some<00:01:30.799> containers<00:01:31.799> like<00:01:32.159> milk<00:01:32.610> containers

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
in some containers like milk containers

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.350 
in some containers like milk containers
they<00:01:33.420> have<00:01:33.630> some<00:01:33.900> sort<00:01:34.200> of<00:01:34.350> thick<00:01:34.740> foil<00:01:35.299> try<00:01:36.299> to

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
they have some sort of thick foil try to

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.929 
they have some sort of thick foil try to
find<00:01:36.720> something<00:01:37.229> that<00:01:37.259> is<00:01:37.729> durable<00:01:38.729> but

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
find something that is durable but

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.740 
find something that is durable but
sometimes<00:01:39.630> but<00:01:40.110> a<00:01:40.140> little<00:01:40.409> bit<00:01:40.680> flexible<00:01:41.750> down

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
sometimes but a little bit flexible down

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.649 
sometimes but a little bit flexible down
use<00:01:43.140> tin<00:01:43.590> foil<00:01:43.920> that<00:01:44.189> is<00:01:44.399> just<00:01:44.670> too<00:01:45.360> thin<00:01:45.630> for

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
use tin foil that is just too thin for

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.520 
use tin foil that is just too thin for
that<00:01:46.020> try<00:01:46.890> to<00:01:46.950> flatten<00:01:47.460> it<00:01:47.549> and<00:01:47.790> make<00:01:48.600> straight

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
that try to flatten it and make straight

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.020 
that try to flatten it and make straight
Oris<00:01:50.220> close<00:01:51.210> as<00:01:51.450> you<00:01:51.570> can<00:01:51.750> straight<00:01:52.229> shape<00:01:53.030> and

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
Oris close as you can straight shape and

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.030 
Oris close as you can straight shape and
we'll<00:01:54.270> just<00:01:54.570> wrap<00:01:54.990> it<00:01:55.020> around<00:01:57.200> your<00:01:58.200> shape<00:01:58.619> on

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
we'll just wrap it around your shape on

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.620 
we'll just wrap it around your shape on
your<00:01:59.280> mold

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
your mold

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.300 
your mold
this<00:02:02.630> is<00:02:02.780> perfect<00:02:03.290> if<00:02:03.470> you<00:02:03.500> need<00:02:03.830> to<00:02:04.100> make

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
this is perfect if you need to make

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.310 
this is perfect if you need to make
something<00:02:04.840> if<00:02:05.840> you<00:02:06.020> need<00:02:06.140> to<00:02:06.380> cover<00:02:06.560> something

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:08.320 
something if you need to cover something

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:16.480 
something if you need to cover something
just<00:02:09.320> like<00:02:09.500> that<00:02:10.630> now<00:02:11.630> cut<00:02:12.170> the<00:02:12.380> excess<00:02:15.430> try<00:02:16.430> to

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
just like that now cut the excess try to

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:24.400 
just like that now cut the excess try to
get<00:02:16.940> it<00:02:17.510> as<00:02:17.990> straight<00:02:18.560> as<00:02:18.860> possible<00:02:23.140> maybe<00:02:24.140> you

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
get it as straight as possible maybe you

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:29.910 
get it as straight as possible maybe you
can<00:02:26.170> wrap<00:02:27.170> this<00:02:27.500> or<00:02:28.030> secure<00:02:29.030> it<00:02:29.180> with<00:02:29.360> some

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
can wrap this or secure it with some

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.190 
can wrap this or secure it with some
tape<00:02:30.920> or<00:02:31.250> a<00:02:31.400> little<00:02:31.820> bit<00:02:31.940> of<00:02:32.090> hot<00:02:32.450> glue<00:02:32.480> or<00:02:32.930> any

slip it remove it and you have your

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.370 
slip it remove it and you have your
cutter<00:02:42.890> right<00:02:43.190> there<00:02:43.510> which<00:02:44.510> is<00:02:44.540> exactly<00:02:44.840> what

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
cutter right there which is exactly what

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.570 
cutter right there which is exactly what
I<00:02:45.410> made<00:02:45.710> in<00:02:45.950> this<00:02:46.070> case<00:02:47.890> you<00:02:48.890> can<00:02:49.070> see<00:02:49.280> all<00:02:49.370> the

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
I made in this case you can see all the

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.020 
I made in this case you can see all the
glue<00:02:49.730> that<00:02:49.970> I<00:02:50.120> put<00:02:50.360> the<00:02:50.930> glue<00:02:51.170> in<00:02:51.530> this<00:02:52.010> side<00:02:52.250> it

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
glue that I put the glue in this side it

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.910 
glue that I put the glue in this side it
keeps<00:02:53.360> a<00:02:53.540> bit<00:02:53.690> of<00:02:53.840> a<00:02:53.930> handle<00:02:54.320> but<00:02:54.590> it<00:02:54.650> also

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
keeps a bit of a handle but it also

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.840 
keeps a bit of a handle but it also
makes<00:02:55.250> it<00:02:55.490> more<00:02:55.550> secure<00:02:56.300> and<00:02:56.540> more<00:02:57.430> it<00:02:58.430> doesn't

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
makes it more secure and more it doesn't

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:04.660 
makes it more secure and more it doesn't
disturb<00:02:59.209> it<00:02:59.480> doesn't<00:02:59.870> lose<00:03:00.020> shape<00:03:02.830> and<00:03:03.830> this

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
disturb it doesn't lose shape and this

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.690 
disturb it doesn't lose shape and this
is<00:03:04.970> the<00:03:05.209> kind<00:03:05.480> of<00:03:05.570> cutter<00:03:05.870> that<00:03:06.260> I<00:03:06.500> used<00:03:06.980> in<00:03:07.459> my

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
is the kind of cutter that I used in my

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.870 
is the kind of cutter that I used in my
plate<00:03:07.970> tutorial<00:03:08.570> that<00:03:08.780> I<00:03:08.930> promised<00:03:09.500> I<00:03:09.880> needed

of pansy shapes try to find something
that<00:03:50.630> is<00:03:50.900> strong<00:03:51.580> but<00:03:52.580> that<00:03:52.760> you<00:03:52.880> can<00:03:53.090> bend

that is strong but that you can bend
with<00:03:53.600> your<00:03:53.750> hands<00:03:54.140> otherwise<00:03:54.350> you<00:03:54.739> will<00:03:54.890> need

with your hands otherwise you will need

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.979 
with your hands otherwise you will need
tools<00:03:55.400> but<00:03:55.730> you<00:03:55.880> can<00:03:56.030> also<00:03:56.180> do<00:03:56.450> that<00:03:56.630> if<00:03:56.870> you

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:56.989 
tools but you can also do that if you

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:00.070 
tools but you can also do that if you
can<00:03:57.170> find<00:03:57.410> copper<00:03:57.890> or<00:03:58.040> something<00:03:58.519> similar<00:03:59.080> but

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:00.080 
can find copper or something similar but

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:03.000 
can find copper or something similar but
what<00:04:00.769> practice<00:04:01.430> and<00:04:01.640> see<00:04:01.820> what<00:04:02.090> you<00:04:02.239> can<00:04:02.390> do

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 
what practice and see what you can do

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:05.830 
what practice and see what you can do
and<00:04:04.010> you<00:04:04.070> will<00:04:04.489> save<00:04:04.760> a<00:04:04.790> lot<00:04:05.030> of<00:04:05.060> money<00:04:05.180> and<00:04:05.690> you

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
and you will save a lot of money and you

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.229 
and you will save a lot of money and you
can<00:04:06.019> get<00:04:06.200> custom<00:04:06.769> custom<00:04:07.519> shapes<00:04:07.880> that<00:04:08.090> you

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:08.239 
can get custom custom shapes that you

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:10.720 
can get custom custom shapes that you
can<00:04:08.269> get<00:04:08.690> otherwise<00:04:09.109> so<00:04:10.010> I<00:04:10.040> hope<00:04:10.310> this<00:04:10.519> was

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730 
can get otherwise so I hope this was

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:12.520 
can get otherwise so I hope this was
useful<00:04:10.850> let<00:04:11.450> me<00:04:11.570> know

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:12.530 
useful let me know
