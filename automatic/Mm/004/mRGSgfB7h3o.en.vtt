00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
before so these are in no order but the

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:58.849 
before so these are in no order but the

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
did is they made it so that they added a

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.569 
did is they made it so that they added a
lot<00:01:36.689> a<00:01:37.020> lot<00:01:37.350> of<00:01:37.560> perks<00:01:37.860> because<00:01:38.369> they<00:01:38.520> were

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
lot a lot of perks because they were

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.270 
lot a lot of perks because they were
trying<00:01:38.909> to<00:01:39.119> make<00:01:39.299> it<00:01:39.659> so<00:01:39.900> that<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:41.040> guns

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
trying to make it so that the guns

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.700 
trying to make it so that the guns
themselves<00:01:42.090> weren't<00:01:42.780> overpowered<00:01:43.560> you

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
themselves weren't overpowered you

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.350 
themselves weren't overpowered you
really<00:01:44.009> had<00:01:44.220> to<00:01:44.250> have<00:01:44.520> some<00:01:44.820> some

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
really had to have some some

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.510 
really had to have some some
intelligence<00:01:46.320> in<00:01:46.530> order<00:01:46.680> to<00:01:46.920> be<00:01:47.040> good<00:01:47.250> at<00:01:47.490> this

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
intelligence in order to be good at this

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.399 
intelligence in order to be good at this
game<00:01:47.970> so<00:01:48.570> you<00:01:48.630> got<00:01:48.780> to<00:01:48.899> make<00:01:48.990> sure<00:01:49.020> you<00:01:49.259> have

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
game so you got to make sure you have

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.740 
game so you got to make sure you have
the<00:01:49.439> right<00:01:49.590> classes<00:01:50.009> because<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.909> guns<00:01:51.119> just

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
the right classes because the guns just

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.210 
the right classes because the guns just
the<00:01:51.869> guns<00:01:52.110> aren't<00:01:52.439> going<00:01:52.680> to<00:01:52.770> do<00:01:52.920> it<00:01:53.040> for<00:01:53.159> you

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
the guns aren't going to do it for you

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.950 
the guns aren't going to do it for you
in<00:01:53.399> this<00:01:53.520> game<00:01:53.759> like<00:01:53.939> they<00:01:54.090> have<00:01:54.299> before<00:01:54.720> in

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
in this game like they have before in

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.959 
in this game like they have before in
previous<00:01:55.110> Call<00:01:55.619> of<00:01:55.649> Duty's<00:01:56.009> so<00:01:56.549> yeah<00:01:56.759> that's

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
previous Call of Duty's so yeah that's

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.060 
previous Call of Duty's so yeah that's
the<00:01:57.270> first<00:01:57.509> thing<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:58.229> second<00:01:58.619> thing<00:01:58.649> that<00:01:58.799> I

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
the first thing the second thing that I

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.010 
the first thing the second thing that I
have<00:01:59.250> for<00:01:59.369> you<00:01:59.460> guys<00:01:59.520> is<00:01:59.909> to<00:02:00.299> know<00:02:00.540> the<00:02:00.570> maps

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
have for you guys is to know the maps

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.109 
have for you guys is to know the maps
because<00:02:01.320> map<00:02:01.770> control<00:02:02.250> is<00:02:02.399> also<00:02:02.759> another

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
because map control is also another

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.020 
because map control is also another
crucial<00:02:03.780> part<00:02:04.229> to<00:02:04.500> owning<00:02:05.369> people<00:02:05.700> in<00:02:05.850> call

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
crucial part to owning people in call

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.300 
crucial part to owning people in call
duty<00:02:06.210> ghosts<00:02:06.630> because<00:02:07.350> these<00:02:07.829> maps<00:02:08.129> are

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
duty ghosts because these maps are

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.279 
duty ghosts because these maps are
pretty<00:02:08.819> dynamic<00:02:09.090> you<00:02:09.660> know<00:02:09.750> there's<00:02:09.989> long

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
pretty dynamic you know there's long

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.480 
pretty dynamic you know there's long
ranges<00:02:10.709> of<00:02:10.830> sight<00:02:11.039> that<00:02:11.310> wow<00:02:11.489> I<00:02:11.520> just

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 
ranges of sight that wow I just

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:15.390 
ranges of sight that wow I just
I<00:02:12.550> just<00:02:13.360> got<00:02:13.510> raped<00:02:13.720> but<00:02:14.560> there's<00:02:14.740> long<00:02:14.950> ranges

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
I just got raped but there's long ranges

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.070 
I just got raped but there's long ranges
of<00:02:15.550> sight<00:02:15.790> there's<00:02:16.030> medium<00:02:16.390> ranges<00:02:16.690> of<00:02:16.870> sight

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
of sight there's medium ranges of sight

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.990 
of sight there's medium ranges of sight
like<00:02:17.260> you<00:02:17.350> just<00:02:17.530> saw<00:02:17.680> me<00:02:17.710> die<00:02:18.040> from<00:02:18.370> and<00:02:18.640> then

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
like you just saw me die from and then

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.880 
like you just saw me die from and then
there's<00:02:19.240> also<00:02:19.420> close<00:02:19.810> quarters<00:02:20.200> places<00:02:20.710> like

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
there's also close quarters places like

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.490 
there's also close quarters places like
that<00:02:20.920> house<00:02:21.280> right<00:02:21.610> there<00:02:22.050> they<00:02:23.050> just<00:02:23.290> they

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
that house right there they just they

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.890 
that house right there they just they
really<00:02:23.770> did<00:02:23.890> a<00:02:23.920> good<00:02:24.160> job<00:02:24.220> with<00:02:24.490> the<00:02:25.270> dynamics

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
really did a good job with the dynamics

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:26.970 
really did a good job with the dynamics
of<00:02:25.990> the<00:02:26.110> maps<00:02:26.320> now<00:02:26.470> I<00:02:26.500> don't<00:02:26.680> necessarily

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
of the maps now I don't necessarily

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.100 
of the maps now I don't necessarily
agree<00:02:27.340> with<00:02:27.730> all<00:02:28.060> the<00:02:28.090> maps<00:02:28.450> I<00:02:28.600> don't<00:02:28.750> like<00:02:28.900> all

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
agree with all the maps I don't like all

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.100 
agree with all the maps I don't like all
the<00:02:29.320> maps<00:02:29.530> but<00:02:30.100> on<00:02:30.580> a<00:02:30.640> standpoint<00:02:31.240> of<00:02:31.450> dynamics

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
the maps but on a standpoint of dynamics

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.260 
the maps but on a standpoint of dynamics
they<00:02:32.830> really<00:02:33.430> hit<00:02:33.700> it<00:02:33.730> right<00:02:33.910> on<00:02:33.970> the<00:02:34.120> spot

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
they really hit it right on the spot

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.660 
they really hit it right on the spot
where<00:02:34.690> pretty<00:02:35.530> much<00:02:35.620> any<00:02:35.950> gun<00:02:36.220> you<00:02:36.370> can<00:02:36.520> do

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
where pretty much any gun you can do

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.030 
where pretty much any gun you can do
okay<00:02:37.150> with<00:02:37.390> but<00:02:37.960> we're<00:02:38.140> not<00:02:38.290> going<00:02:38.560> for<00:02:38.740> okay

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
okay with but we're not going for okay

we're going for the best right guys okay

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.730 
we're going for the best right guys okay
isn't<00:02:43.120> just<00:02:43.420> good<00:02:43.570> for<00:02:43.630> us<00:02:43.990> so<00:02:44.260> we<00:02:44.380> got<00:02:44.410> to<00:02:44.650> be

the best you got to make sure you know

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.180 
the best you got to make sure you know
the<00:02:46.330> maps<00:02:46.540> in<00:02:46.720> map<00:02:46.930> control<00:02:47.320> and<00:02:47.530> honestly

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
the maps in map control and honestly

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.070 
the maps in map control and honestly
that<00:02:48.550> just<00:02:48.880> comes<00:02:49.120> with<00:02:49.240> playing<00:02:49.600> the<00:02:49.780> game

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
that just comes with playing the game

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.640 
that just comes with playing the game
guys<00:02:50.440> now<00:02:51.250> me<00:02:51.460> personally<00:02:51.730> I<00:02:52.330> think<00:02:52.960> I<00:02:53.320> barely

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
guys now me personally I think I barely

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.650 
guys now me personally I think I barely
have<00:02:53.980> over<00:02:54.310> a<00:02:54.340> day<00:02:54.550> played<00:02:54.850> in<00:02:55.060> this<00:02:55.180> game<00:02:55.270> most

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
have over a day played in this game most

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.360 
have over a day played in this game most
people<00:02:55.900> have<00:02:56.050> like<00:02:56.260> five<00:02:56.530> and<00:02:56.830> six<00:02:57.130> days

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
people have like five and six days

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.220 
people have like five and six days
played<00:02:57.700> I<00:02:57.910> just<00:02:58.360> want<00:02:58.720> I<00:02:58.750> don't<00:02:58.930> get<00:02:59.050> to<00:02:59.140> play

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
played I just want I don't get to play

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.160 
played I just want I don't get to play
this<00:02:59.380> game<00:02:59.560> that<00:02:59.800> often<00:03:00.190> but<00:03:00.910> I<00:03:01.150> learned<00:03:02.050> the

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
this game that often but I learned the

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.380 
this game that often but I learned the
maps<00:03:02.380> very<00:03:02.770> very<00:03:03.040> quickly<00:03:03.430> I<00:03:03.760> learned<00:03:04.240> it

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
maps very very quickly I learned it

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.180 
maps very very quickly I learned it
within<00:03:04.540> like<00:03:04.930> probably<00:03:05.290> five<00:03:05.530> hours<00:03:06.010> of

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
within like probably five hours of

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.490 
within like probably five hours of
playing<00:03:06.790> the<00:03:06.910> game<00:03:07.120> but<00:03:07.990> that's<00:03:08.140> only<00:03:08.350> because

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
playing the game but that's only because

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.740 
playing the game but that's only because
I've<00:03:08.890> been<00:03:09.010> playing<00:03:09.250> call<00:03:09.730> of<00:03:09.760> duty<00:03:09.880> games<00:03:10.360> for

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
I've been playing call of duty games for

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.860 
I've been playing call of duty games for
a<00:03:11.050> long<00:03:11.590> long<00:03:12.070> time<00:03:12.130> so<00:03:12.820> it<00:03:13.090> just<00:03:13.510> comes<00:03:13.750> with

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
a long long time so it just comes with

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.480 
a long long time so it just comes with
practice<00:03:14.170> just<00:03:14.740> make<00:03:14.950> sure<00:03:15.160> that<00:03:15.190> you're

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:15.490 
practice just make sure that you're

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:17.370 
practice just make sure that you're
playing<00:03:15.700> the<00:03:15.940> maps<00:03:16.150> and<00:03:16.450> don't<00:03:16.750> skip<00:03:17.140> maps

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
playing the maps and don't skip maps

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:19.560 
playing the maps and don't skip maps
just<00:03:17.740> because<00:03:18.010> you<00:03:18.190> do<00:03:18.430> shitty<00:03:18.760> on<00:03:18.970> them<00:03:19.180> you

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570 
just because you do shitty on them you

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:21.090 
just because you do shitty on them you
know<00:03:19.690> maybe<00:03:19.900> you<00:03:19.960> play<00:03:20.200> those<00:03:20.440> maps<00:03:20.710> a<00:03:20.860> couple

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
know maybe you play those maps a couple

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.710 
know maybe you play those maps a couple
times<00:03:21.310> so<00:03:21.490> that<00:03:21.520> you<00:03:21.700> can<00:03:21.940> do<00:03:22.210> good<00:03:22.450> on<00:03:22.480> them

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
times so that you can do good on them

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.300 
times so that you can do good on them
and<00:03:22.870> you<00:03:22.990> learn<00:03:23.170> the<00:03:23.350> maps<00:03:23.530> because<00:03:23.770> that's

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
and you learn the maps because that's

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:25.530 
and you learn the maps because that's
the<00:03:24.430> only<00:03:24.460> way<00:03:24.730> you're<00:03:24.880> going<00:03:25.030> to<00:03:25.180> do<00:03:25.360> better

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
the only way you're going to do better

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.480 
the only way you're going to do better
is<00:03:25.720> if<00:03:25.900> you<00:03:25.930> learn<00:03:26.290> the<00:03:26.320> maps<00:03:26.650> so<00:03:27.280> now<00:03:27.460> I

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:27.490 
is if you learn the maps so now I

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:29.610 
is if you learn the maps so now I
believe<00:03:27.880> it's<00:03:28.180> time<00:03:28.270> for<00:03:28.750> the<00:03:28.840> pickup<00:03:29.080> line<00:03:29.440> of

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
believe it's time for the pickup line of

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.160 
believe it's time for the pickup line of
the<00:03:29.740> day<00:03:29.980> so<00:03:30.790> today's<00:03:31.090> pickup<00:03:31.420> line<00:03:31.630> is<00:03:31.930> I

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
the day so today's pickup line is I

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.140 
the day so today's pickup line is I
would<00:03:32.920> run<00:03:33.070> around<00:03:33.250> the<00:03:33.490> world<00:03:33.700> for<00:03:34.000> you

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
would run around the world for you

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.170 
would run around the world for you
without<00:03:34.750> light<00:03:35.200> weight<00:03:35.790> that's<00:03:36.790> pretty<00:03:37.060> good

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
without light weight that's pretty good

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.510 
without light weight that's pretty good
one<00:03:37.390> so<00:03:37.630> yeah<00:03:38.350> I<00:03:38.380> like<00:03:38.680> that<00:03:38.860> one<00:03:39.040> so<00:03:39.100> now<00:03:39.460> the

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:44.320 
guys about is mess around with your

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.290 
guys about is mess around with your
classes<00:03:44.650> now<00:03:45.010> I<00:03:45.250> know<00:03:45.310> kind<00:03:45.670> of<00:03:45.760> contradicts

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:46.300 
classes now I know kind of contradicts

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:49.680 
classes now I know kind of contradicts
myself<00:03:46.780> earlier<00:03:47.500> when<00:03:47.800> I<00:03:47.830> said<00:03:47.950> to<00:03:48.730> you<00:03:49.330> know

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
myself earlier when I said to you know

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:51.600 
myself earlier when I said to you know
figure<00:03:50.200> out<00:03:50.410> the<00:03:50.710> best<00:03:50.830> classes<00:03:51.370> because

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:51.610 
figure out the best classes because

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:53.700 
figure out the best classes because
that's<00:03:52.510> how<00:03:52.660> you're<00:03:52.810> gonna<00:03:52.900> do<00:03:53.110> good<00:03:53.260> but<00:03:53.470> I

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:53.710

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
also want you guys to go outside of your

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.300

range because I can't tell you how many

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.090 
range because I can't tell you how many
times<00:03:57.730> I've<00:03:58.090> stuck<00:03:58.390> with<00:03:58.630> the<00:03:58.870> famas<00:03:59.590> and

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:00.100 
times I've stuck with the famas and

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.640 
times I've stuck with the famas and
black<00:04:00.340> in<00:04:00.520> black<00:04:00.700> ops<00:04:00.940> 1<00:04:01.060> and<00:04:01.660> I<00:04:01.780> just<00:04:02.020> only<00:04:02.230> use

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
black in black ops 1 and I just only use

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.060 
black in black ops 1 and I just only use
that<00:04:02.890> gun<00:04:03.100> and<00:04:03.400> then<00:04:04.380> alsana<00:04:05.380> switch<00:04:05.620> or<00:04:06.010> I

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:06.070 
that gun and then alsana switch or I

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:07.920 
that gun and then alsana switch or I
start<00:04:06.400> doing<00:04:06.730> terrible<00:04:07.150> with<00:04:07.330> it<00:04:07.450> because<00:04:07.570> I

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
start doing terrible with it because I

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:09.600 
start doing terrible with it because I
don't<00:04:08.080> know<00:04:08.110> I'm<00:04:08.260> getting<00:04:08.380> used<00:04:08.709> to<00:04:08.890> it<00:04:08.980> or<00:04:09.400> I'm

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:09.610 
don't know I'm getting used to it or I'm

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:11.760 
don't know I'm getting used to it or I'm
just<00:04:09.640> being<00:04:10.390> lazy<00:04:10.450> with<00:04:10.930> it<00:04:10.990> or<00:04:11.260> something<00:04:11.620> and

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:11.770 
just being lazy with it or something and

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:15.030 
just being lazy with it or something and
I<00:04:11.950> don't<00:04:12.220> like<00:04:12.400> force<00:04:12.760> my<00:04:13.000> gun<00:04:13.240> skill<00:04:13.600> on<00:04:14.040> the

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
I don't like force my gun skill on the

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.820 
I don't like force my gun skill on the
gun<00:04:15.220> I<00:04:15.250> guess<00:04:15.580> is<00:04:15.850> a<00:04:16.180> way<00:04:16.359> to<00:04:16.390> say<00:04:16.690> but<00:04:17.560> yeah<00:04:17.770> you

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:17.830 
gun I guess is a way to say but yeah you

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:19.349 
gun I guess is a way to say but yeah you
need<00:04:18.100> to<00:04:18.220> mess<00:04:18.430> around<00:04:18.609> with<00:04:18.880> your<00:04:19.060> classes

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 
need to mess around with your classes

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:22.020 
need to mess around with your classes
because<00:04:19.810> a<00:04:20.200> lot<00:04:20.919> of<00:04:20.950> the<00:04:21.100> times<00:04:21.460> you<00:04:21.640> get<00:04:21.790> so

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.030 
because a lot of the times you get so

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:23.880 
because a lot of the times you get so
used<00:04:22.060> to<00:04:22.570> the<00:04:22.720> same<00:04:22.990> gun<00:04:23.260> that<00:04:23.290> you<00:04:23.500> need<00:04:23.860> a

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:23.890 
used to the same gun that you need a

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:26.410 
used to the same gun that you need a
challenge<00:04:24.550> with<00:04:24.760> another<00:04:25.060> gun<00:04:25.360> so

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:26.420 
challenge with another gun so

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:28.870 
challenge with another gun so
what<00:04:26.570> I<00:04:26.600> would<00:04:26.900> advise<00:04:27.740> you<00:04:27.980> guys<00:04:28.010> to<00:04:28.190> do<00:04:28.580> and<00:04:28.820> I

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
what I would advise you guys to do and I

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.420 
what I would advise you guys to do and I
invite<00:04:29.120> you<00:04:29.150> to<00:04:29.420> do<00:04:29.570> is<00:04:29.840> to<00:04:30.200> switch<00:04:30.890> up<00:04:30.920> a<00:04:31.220> gun

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
invite you to do is to switch up a gun

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:33.490 
invite you to do is to switch up a gun
like<00:04:31.700> try<00:04:32.180> to<00:04:32.210> stay<00:04:32.570> away<00:04:32.840> from<00:04:32.870> using<00:04:33.260> this

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:33.500 
like try to stay away from using this

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.280 
like try to stay away from using this
same<00:04:33.800> gun<00:04:34.130> over<00:04:34.700> and<00:04:35.000> over<00:04:35.270> and<00:04:35.660> over<00:04:35.990> again

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:36.290 
same gun over and over and over again

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:38.920 
same gun over and over and over again
because<00:04:36.560> I<00:04:37.040> have<00:04:37.880> this<00:04:38.030> theory<00:04:38.360> that<00:04:38.510> you<00:04:38.750> just

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:38.930 
because I have this theory that you just

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:40.870 
because I have this theory that you just
get<00:04:39.080> you<00:04:39.290> really<00:04:39.650> used<00:04:39.890> to<00:04:40.070> using<00:04:40.400> this<00:04:40.640> gun

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:40.880 
get you really used to using this gun

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.340 
get you really used to using this gun
and<00:04:41.270> then<00:04:41.360> you<00:04:41.480> just<00:04:41.630> start<00:04:41.840> getting<00:04:42.110> lazy

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:42.350 
and then you just start getting lazy

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:43.900 
and then you just start getting lazy
with<00:04:42.650> it<00:04:42.710> so<00:04:42.950> I<00:04:42.980> invite<00:04:43.310> you<00:04:43.340> to<00:04:43.520> use<00:04:43.850> a

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:43.910 
with it so I invite you to use a

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:45.340

duty player another thing that a lot of
you<00:05:29.180> guys<00:05:29.300> probably<00:05:29.750> already<00:05:29.990> do<00:05:30.530> but<00:05:30.860> I<00:05:30.920> just

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:31.130 
you guys probably already do but I just

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:33.490 
you guys probably already do but I just
want<00:05:31.340> to<00:05:31.430> stress<00:05:31.850> this<00:05:32.120> is<00:05:32.300> to<00:05:32.780> learn<00:05:32.990> the<00:05:33.170> jump

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:33.500 
want to stress this is to learn the jump

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:36.130 
want to stress this is to learn the jump
shot<00:05:33.560> and<00:05:33.950> drop<00:05:34.220> shot<00:05:34.520> I<00:05:35.120> would<00:05:35.720> have<00:05:35.930> to<00:05:36.110> say

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:36.140 
shot and drop shot I would have to say

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:38.200 
shot and drop shot I would have to say
that<00:05:36.290> drop<00:05:36.650> shotting<00:05:36.950> is<00:05:37.220> most<00:05:37.520> effective<00:05:37.820> in

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:38.210 
that drop shotting is most effective in

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:40.840 
that drop shotting is most effective in
this<00:05:38.390> game<00:05:38.630> jump<00:05:39.440> shot<00:05:39.530> eng<00:05:39.830> it's<00:05:40.190> alright<00:05:40.580> but

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:40.850 
this game jump shot eng it's alright but

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:43.390 
this game jump shot eng it's alright but
I<00:05:40.880> really<00:05:41.570> think<00:05:41.750> drop<00:05:42.470> shotting<00:05:42.770> is<00:05:43.010> the<00:05:43.220> most

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:43.400 
I really think drop shotting is the most

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:46.570 
I really think drop shotting is the most
effective<00:05:43.670> way<00:05:44.090> of<00:05:44.410> as<00:05:45.410> far<00:05:45.680> as<00:05:45.830> those<00:05:46.040> tactics

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:46.580 
effective way of as far as those tactics

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:48.310 
effective way of as far as those tactics
go<00:05:46.790> so<00:05:47.060> make<00:05:47.210> sure<00:05:47.240> you<00:05:47.450> learn<00:05:47.630> to<00:05:47.810> drop<00:05:48.080> shot

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:48.320 
go so make sure you learn to drop shot

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:51.550 
go so make sure you learn to drop shot

times where i drop shot from like mid to
long<00:06:05.780> range<00:06:06.050> and<00:06:06.380> I<00:06:06.470> just<00:06:06.710> they<00:06:07.490> don't<00:06:07.670> know

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:07.760 
long range and I just they don't know

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:09.610 
long range and I just they don't know
what<00:06:07.910> to<00:06:08.030> do<00:06:08.180> so<00:06:08.840> if<00:06:08.990> you<00:06:09.110> have<00:06:09.230> good<00:06:09.440> enough
