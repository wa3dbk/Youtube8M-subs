 a singer 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.820
 Y 

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:39.130
 for me 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.950
 there is a climate 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:52.989
 does it move 

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:56.289
 I 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:24.680
 and mine 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.240
 ah 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:49.320
 95 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.320
 it's me 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:17.200
 I will not die 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:22.570
 dyn 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.230
 i 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.280
 all right 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:37.360
 ah 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.360
 in Italy 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.510
 go 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.060
 Y 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:54.420
 It's me 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:15.350
 'valentine so I do not want a 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.460
 very loaded makeup but everything 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.720
 contrary 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:19.580
 I want to make it look like it does not 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.500
 wear makeup without having a skin 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:23.700
 perfect and luminous a skin effect 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.620
 velvety 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.750
 we started by applying the base of 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.519
 makeup remember that if you use those that 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:33.050
 sant boi and others must be applied very 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:33.050
 quickly because it dries quickly 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:40.920
 in Miami 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.659
 we mix the concealer with the base of 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.180
 makeup to get a more tone 

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:46.920
 matched and we apply it under the eye and 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:50.180
 in those points in which 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.180
 we need more coverage 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.030
 to me 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:01.400
 when we are finished we go back to catch 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.349
 the makeup brush and we make another 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:06.730
 last to finish fusing well the 

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:06.730
 concealer with the base 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:12.310
 to massify the face and give a 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:15.240
 little bit of color I will use the powders 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:15.240
 skin 15 more 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:28.620
 once we have applied the first 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:28.620
 we give light with a clear shadow 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.740
 i 

00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:40.490
 we define the eye with a subtle delineation 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:42.349
 a rne of the upper lashes and then 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:44.830
 we mark the eye with a mask 

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:44.830
 tabs 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:50.040
 we apply rouge the cheeks I use 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:52.380
 the benefit coralist because it is a 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:55.250
 very rosy tone that accentuates that blush 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.250
 natural that we have 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:01.819
 that's why the stone comes out and they greet 

00:04:58.349 --> 00:05:01.819
 give points of light on the face 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:11.100
 As you can see, the look is very natural 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:13.250
 we get a healthy look and very 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:13.250
 bright 

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:32.059
 to die
