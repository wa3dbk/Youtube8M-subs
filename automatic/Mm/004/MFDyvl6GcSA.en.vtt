different thing that doesn't really have

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.910 
different thing that doesn't really have
to<00:02:48.180> do<00:02:48.300> about<00:02:48.390> gaming<00:02:48.870> but<00:02:48.990> she<00:02:49.080> says<00:02:49.290> what

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
to do about gaming but she says what

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.910 
to do about gaming but she says what
really<00:02:50.130> got<00:02:50.280> me<00:02:50.340> just<00:02:50.670> now<00:02:50.850> was<00:02:51.480> that<00:02:51.540> um<00:02:52.080> she

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
really got me just now was that um she

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.470 
really got me just now was that um she
said<00:02:53.100> that<00:02:53.280> she<00:02:53.400> was<00:02:53.520> in<00:02:53.640> shock<00:02:53.880> and<00:02:54.180> so<00:02:54.450> I

said that she was in shock and so I

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.199 
said that she was in shock and so I
wonder<00:02:54.810> how<00:02:55.140> how<00:02:55.920> such<00:02:56.250> a<00:02:56.280> situation<00:02:56.910> would

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
wonder how how such a situation would

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:58.850 
wonder how how such a situation would
feel<00:02:57.540> because<00:02:57.780> you're<00:02:58.290> talking<00:02:58.470> to<00:02:58.650> somebody

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 
warriors and they were actually almost

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.920 
warriors and they were actually almost
higher<00:04:38.250> above<00:04:38.730> men<00:04:38.970> they<00:04:39.090> were<00:04:39.180> equal<00:04:39.720> with
