centimeters which is really quite high
for<00:00:27.210> a<00:00:27.500> portable<00:00:28.500> monopod<00:00:28.980> like<00:00:29.189> this<00:00:29.429> they

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
for a portable monopod like this they

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
feet that are used on this monopod will

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.049 
feet that are used on this monopod will
also<00:00:34.380> give<00:00:34.530> it<00:00:34.620> about<00:00:34.710> 10<00:00:35.130> centimeters<00:00:35.670> extra

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
also give it about 10 centimeters extra

also give it about 10 centimeters extra
height<00:00:36.270> which<00:00:36.450> is<00:00:36.480> quite<00:00:36.809> a<00:00:36.840> lot<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.559> monopod

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
height which is quite a lot the monopod

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.369 
height which is quite a lot the monopod
itself<00:00:38.250> goes<00:00:38.520> down<00:00:38.760> to<00:00:39.000> 60<00:00:39.719> centimeters<00:00:40.200> which

itself goes down to 60 centimeters which

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.799 
itself goes down to 60 centimeters which
is<00:00:40.410> perfectly<00:00:41.190> fine<00:00:41.280> for<00:00:41.760> if<00:00:42.360> you<00:00:42.570> want<00:00:42.750> to

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.140 
but it also keeps the scratches and that
off<00:01:37.170> your<00:01:37.829> equipment<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:38.400> off<00:01:38.700> this<00:01:38.850> monopod

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
off your equipment and off this monopod

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.359 
off your equipment and off this monopod
now<00:01:40.079> one<00:01:40.350> of<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.530> pretty<00:01:40.710> big<00:01:40.890> things<00:01:41.130> that<00:01:41.310> I

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
now one of the pretty big things that I

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:42.469 
now one of the pretty big things that I
wanted<00:01:41.579> to<00:01:41.670> know<00:01:41.850> when<00:01:42.030> I<00:01:42.060> bought<00:01:42.299> this

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
wanted to know when I bought this

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.179 
wanted to know when I bought this
monopod<00:01:42.810> was<00:01:43.380> whether<00:01:43.649> or<00:01:43.799> not<00:01:43.890> you<00:01:44.070> could

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
monopod was whether or not you could

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.370 
monopod was whether or not you could
actually<00:01:44.610> lock<00:01:45.000> out<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.450> monopod<00:01:46.049> so<00:01:46.229> it

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
actually lock out the monopod so it

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.410 
actually lock out the monopod so it
couldn't<00:01:46.799> really<00:01:47.040> move<00:01:47.399> and<00:01:47.700> you<00:01:48.030> could<00:01:48.180> use

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
couldn't really move and you could use

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.410 
couldn't really move and you could use
this<00:01:48.630> without<00:01:48.990> a<00:01:49.380> your<00:01:49.890> hands<00:01:50.250> now<00:01:50.970> it<00:01:51.210> does

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
this without a your hands now it does

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.690 
this without a your hands now it does
have<00:01:51.450> a<00:01:51.930> locking<00:01:52.229> nut<00:01:52.530> as<00:01:52.710> you<00:01:52.950> can<00:01:53.100> see<00:01:53.280> here

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
have a locking nut as you can see here

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.300 
have a locking nut as you can see here
but<00:01:54.329> unfortunately<00:01:54.570> it<00:01:55.380> doesn't<00:01:55.799> really<00:01:55.979> lock

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
but unfortunately it doesn't really lock

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.270 
but unfortunately it doesn't really lock
that<00:01:56.610> well<00:01:56.880> in<00:01:57.689> theory<00:01:58.530> you<00:01:58.799> could<00:01:59.070> actually

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
that well in theory you could actually

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.850 
that well in theory you could actually
use<00:01:59.700> this<00:01:59.909> to<00:01:59.969> have<00:02:00.600> hands<00:02:01.049> a<00:02:01.229> hands-free

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
use this to have hands a hands-free

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.980 
use this to have hands a hands-free
monopod<00:02:02.520> but<00:02:03.119> you<00:02:03.270> wouldn't<00:02:03.540> really<00:02:03.659> want<00:02:03.869> to

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
monopod but you wouldn't really want to

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.719 
monopod but you wouldn't really want to
be<00:02:04.049> leaving<00:02:04.380> it<00:02:04.500> in<00:02:04.680> the<00:02:04.799> wind<00:02:05.009> because<00:02:05.610> it

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
be leaving it in the wind because it

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:06.800 
be leaving it in the wind because it
could<00:02:05.909> just<00:02:06.000> get<00:02:06.210> knocked<00:02:06.329> over<00:02:06.479> pretty

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
could just get knocked over pretty

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.440 
could just get knocked over pretty
easily<00:02:06.990> now<00:02:07.350> this<00:02:08.009> monopod<00:02:08.280> uses<00:02:08.789> the<00:02:09.030> twist

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
easily now this monopod uses the twist

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.020 
easily now this monopod uses the twist
lock<00:02:09.539> system<00:02:10.020> which<00:02:10.830> is<00:02:11.009> really<00:02:11.610> really<00:02:11.879> nice

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
lock system which is really really nice

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.490 
lock system which is really really nice
because<00:02:12.270> you<00:02:12.480> can<00:02:12.629> get<00:02:12.780> them<00:02:12.900> on<00:02:12.989> a<00:02:13.020> pod

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
because you can get them on a pod

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.980 
because you can get them on a pod
up<00:02:13.680> and<00:02:13.980> down<00:02:14.130> superfast<00:02:14.970> and<00:02:15.240> their<00:02:15.810> locks

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
up and down superfast and their locks

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.960 
up and down superfast and their locks
actually<00:02:16.470> seem<00:02:16.650> pretty<00:02:16.680> pretty<00:02:17.400> solid<00:02:17.760> so

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
actually seem pretty pretty solid so

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.050 
actually seem pretty pretty solid so
very<00:02:18.600> happy<00:02:18.900> with<00:02:19.050> that<00:02:19.080> okay<00:02:20.040> this<00:02:20.280> is<00:02:20.430> a<00:02:20.610> shot

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
very happy with that okay this is a shot

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.650 
very happy with that okay this is a shot
with<00:02:21.300> the<00:02:21.510> monopod<00:02:22.320> on<00:02:22.560> and<00:02:23.240> as<00:02:24.240> you<00:02:24.330> can<00:02:24.480> tell

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
with the monopod on and as you can tell

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.050 
with the monopod on and as you can tell
it<00:02:24.840> is<00:02:24.960> pretty<00:02:25.260> rock-solid<00:02:25.500> I'm<00:02:26.430> just<00:02:26.730> holding

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
it is pretty rock-solid I'm just holding

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.990 
it is pretty rock-solid I'm just holding
it<00:02:27.150> by<00:02:27.630> the<00:02:27.690> handle<00:02:28.200> and<00:02:28.670> you<00:02:29.670> can<00:02:29.820> tell

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
it by the handle and you can tell

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.100 
it by the handle and you can tell
there's<00:02:30.209> not<00:02:30.330> much<00:02:30.450> movement<00:02:30.690> it's<00:02:30.930> almost

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
there's not much movement it's almost

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.810 
there's not much movement it's almost
like<00:02:31.380> it's<00:02:31.560> locked<00:02:32.010> off<00:02:32.130> on<00:02:32.250> a<00:02:32.280> tripod<00:02:32.700> which

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
like it's locked off on a tripod which

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:41.729 
like it's locked off on a tripod which
is<00:02:32.940> really<00:02:33.180> good<00:02:33.410> just<00:02:34.410> try<00:02:34.800> a<00:02:34.830> quick<00:02:35.070> pan<00:02:35.280> here

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:43.440 

it's<00:02:42.129> not<00:02:42.250> as<00:02:42.370> good<00:02:42.519> as<00:02:42.579> a<00:02:42.640> tripod<00:02:43.030> but<00:02:43.239> it<00:02:43.329> is

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
it's not as good as a tripod but it is

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.420 
it's not as good as a tripod but it is
pretty<00:02:43.689> good<00:02:43.840> in<00:02:44.049> the<00:02:44.140> extra<00:02:44.470> feet<00:02:44.680> I<00:02:44.890> make<00:02:45.400> a

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
pretty good in the extra feet I make a

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.710 
pretty good in the extra feet I make a
big<00:02:45.640> difference<00:02:46.439> okay<00:02:47.439> so<00:02:47.650> this<00:02:48.189> is<00:02:48.489> a<00:02:48.939> test

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
big difference okay so this is a test

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.440 
big difference okay so this is a test
without<00:02:49.930> the<00:02:50.340> monopod<00:02:51.340> as<00:02:51.489> you<00:02:51.640> can<00:02:51.790> see<00:02:51.939> it's

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
without the monopod as you can see it's

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.350 
without the monopod as you can see it's
a<00:02:52.510> little<00:02:52.659> bit<00:02:52.810> shaky<00:02:53.769> and<00:02:54.030> the<00:02:55.030> earlier

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
a little bit shaky and the earlier

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.809 
a little bit shaky and the earlier
images<00:02:55.720> were<00:02:55.900> a<00:02:55.930> bit<00:02:56.110> better<00:02:56.260> and<00:02:56.620> as<00:02:57.549> you<00:02:57.670> can

00:02:57.809 --> 00:02:57.819 
images were a bit better and as you can

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:59.429 
images were a bit better and as you can
see<00:02:58.000> right<00:02:58.209> here<00:02:58.269> the<00:02:58.720> monopod<00:02:59.049> does<00:02:59.230> actually

00:02:59.429 --> 00:02:59.439 
see right here the monopod does actually

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:02.580 
see right here the monopod does actually
stand<00:02:59.799> up<00:02:59.890> on<00:03:00.069> its<00:03:00.250> own<00:03:00.489> quite<00:03:01.450> well<00:03:01.659> but<00:03:02.379> once

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
stand up on its own quite well but once

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.949 
stand up on its own quite well but once
you<00:03:02.739> put<00:03:02.950> a<00:03:03.159> camera<00:03:03.609> on<00:03:03.730> top<00:03:03.790> it<00:03:04.569> does<00:03:04.750> get<00:03:04.930> a

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
you put a camera on top it does get a

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:08.789 
you put a camera on top it does get a
bit<00:03:05.019> weighted<00:03:05.590> so<00:03:06.720> it<00:03:07.720> does<00:03:08.079> tend<00:03:08.349> to<00:03:08.409> tip<00:03:08.650> over

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:08.799 
bit weighted so it does tend to tip over

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:11.490 
bit weighted so it does tend to tip over
so<00:03:09.099> I<00:03:09.159> wouldn't<00:03:09.430> be<00:03:09.519> leaving<00:03:09.700> it<00:03:09.970> on<00:03:10.150> its<00:03:11.019> own

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
so I wouldn't be leaving it on its own

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.220 
so I wouldn't be leaving it on its own
okay<00:03:12.129> that<00:03:12.340> was<00:03:12.489> my<00:03:12.519> review<00:03:12.849> of<00:03:13.209> this<00:03:13.420> $60

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
okay that was my review of this $60

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.559 
okay that was my review of this $60
monopod<00:03:14.709> that<00:03:14.739> you<00:03:14.889> can<00:03:15.010> get<00:03:15.129> off<00:03:15.310> eBay<00:03:15.730> like<00:03:16.450> I

00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:16.569 
monopod that you can get off eBay like I

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:18.390 
monopod that you can get off eBay like I
said<00:03:16.810> in<00:03:16.989> the<00:03:17.109> review<00:03:17.470> I<00:03:17.620> really<00:03:17.889> do<00:03:18.010> like<00:03:18.159> this

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
said in the review I really do like this

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.460 
said in the review I really do like this
monopod<00:03:18.670> I<00:03:18.849> think<00:03:19.150> it's<00:03:19.420> got<00:03:19.599> a<00:03:19.629> lot<00:03:20.200> of<00:03:20.230> good

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
monopod I think it's got a lot of good

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:21.960 
monopod I think it's got a lot of good
features<00:03:20.709> and<00:03:21.069> if<00:03:21.430> you<00:03:21.519> compare<00:03:21.849> it<00:03:21.940> to

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
features and if you compare it to

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.629 
features and if you compare it to
something<00:03:22.150> like<00:03:22.470> the<00:03:23.470> Manfrotto<00:03:23.950> or<00:03:24.250> Benro

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:24.639 
something like the Manfrotto or Benro

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:26.610
