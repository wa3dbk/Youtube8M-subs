00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:32.739
 hello in this video is shown as 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:35.290
 at a veto swiss prime one impeller 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:38.010
 a memory sets and the impeller 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.010
 centered 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.240
 to replace the defective memory 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.229
 since I rims this rim 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.940
 be taken out 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.100
 On the revenue side, it can vary depending on 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.510
 save and impeller type something 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.470
 the stores are more difficult 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:58.470
 find out 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:04.060
 in this case it is helpful the 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:06.360
 memory the take out in the way 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.610
 is something to solve 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:12.280
 in our case, we use the dt 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.590
 swiss talks nipple spanner and screws 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:18.220
 the nipple for several in the turns in the 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:21.010
 counterclockwise from through to 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.830
 Press the side of the solved memory 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:27.420
 the way free and the defective memory 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.420
 can be taken out 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.950
 exactly the same as removing helps 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.050
 also the pushing away of the solved ones 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:38.830
 memory during the assembly of the new 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:41.790
 Memory this can thus without problems 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:44.950
 be put in the right position 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:47.739
 When assembling the memory is on it 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:50.769
 to pay attention that the crossing point of the 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:52.630
 memory is correct for this we compare 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:55.870
 this easy with the already 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:58.060
 save existing crossing points 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.299
 can also be like here later 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:03.610
 be put in the right position 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:06.220
 for this best s.end save with 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:08.680
 Cover the finger so scratching it 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:12.299
 to avoid the rim and now the 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.299
 spokes position correct 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:34.489
 The new nipple should be in the contact area 

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:35.889
 between nipple and washer 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:38.780
 be greased 

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:44.540
 This facilitates the assembly and protects 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:46.400
 before damage the nickels can now 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.939
 we have the washer on the side 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:51.590
 of the nickels with the square 

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:54.670
 the desired side of the disc must 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:54.670
 look upwards 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:07.590
 in the next step, the nipple 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:09.810
 together with the washer through the 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.820
 be put on the 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:14.730
 matching store screwed on too 

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:17.160
 if the nipple some 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:21.140
 it can be screwed on turns 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:24.060
 happen that the memory advises 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:26.430
 in this case we use one 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:29.760
 Rubber glove around the memory better 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:32.130
 to be able to keep the memory better 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:36.230
 Alternatively, you can hold 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:36.230
 a flat-nose pliers are used 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:41.180
 Check if the nipple is correct 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:44.430
 sitting in the cot 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:46.290
 rotate them to take slow and press 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:48.180
 lightly on the nipple around the 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:50.700
 to correct position 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:54.060
 an alternative to the one shown here of 

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:56.130
 knowledge nipple vise can also be the German 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:59.100
 Spoke keys are used 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:01.230
 Always make sure this entirely on 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:03.230
 to stick around the nipple not to 

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:06.660
 to damage 

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:09.000
 at the center of the running wheel are 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:11.370
 side impact heights and impact 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.550
 cosiness of a course in harmony 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:13.550
 brought 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:18.670
 provided she reached the goal fox 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:20.380
 It is important to work the key 

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:24.670
 key clean on the nipple too 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:26.620
 stuck before she turns meadows 

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:29.380
 the key was not attached properly 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:34.780
 the tox profile is damaged traffic light 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:37.570
 or even rendered useless by one 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:39.610
 really good impeller to get 

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:42.300
 the spoke voltage is regularly on 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:45.160
 rear wheel at all spokes the freewheel 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:47.940
 or at the front wheel on the 

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:50.530
 disc brake are measured 

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:54.400
 use dt swiss for this 

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:56.590
 tension meter must center after 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:59.560
 the impeller be pressure tested 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:01.900
 It should be evenly on the 

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:03.120
 but do not spokes on the axle 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:06.340
 hang up 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:08.530
 By pushing can be strong 

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:12.120
 represent still spoke in the workshop 

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:12.120
 straighten again 

00:06:14.669 --> 00:06:20.229
 after that has to squeeze that 

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:22.990
 wheel again in the center stand on 

00:06:20.229 --> 00:06:25.050
 sides and stroke as well as the tension 

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:27.520
 to be controlled 

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:30.340
 repeat the centering and that 

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:32.500
 footprints so long until the impeller 

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:35.430
 even after the update no longer 

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:35.430
 has changed 

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:44.199
 when the wheel is finished centered 

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:44.880
 It can not be installed in the bike 

00:06:44.199 --> 00:06:46.660
 become 

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:48.190
 please note the 

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:50.699
 safety regulations of the 

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:53.650
 bike manufacturer and the frame builder 

00:06:50.699 --> 00:06:57.060
 who from the swiss wish them much 

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:57.060
 fun with your product
