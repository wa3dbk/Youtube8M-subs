such as roof here I could get on 600 k

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.460 
such as roof here I could get on 600 k
but<00:01:24.810> you<00:01:25.290> something<00:01:25.770> around<00:01:25.979> 5k<00:01:26.340> or<00:01:26.640> 1k<00:01:27.270> so<00:01:28.020> it

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
but you something around 5k or 1k so it

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.100

do it with nuffin honorary goals such as

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.270 
do it with nuffin honorary goals such as
I've<00:01:41.900> just<00:01:42.020> been<00:01:42.170> at<00:01:42.320> a<00:01:42.380> hundred<00:01:42.530> fifty<00:01:42.920> points

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:45.080 
so if I get under 300 points that's

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.140 
so if I get under 300 points that's
