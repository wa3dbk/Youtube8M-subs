00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.630 
you got another quarter inch thick piece
here<00:02:46.490> so<00:02:47.390> it<00:02:47.450> ends<00:02:47.600> up<00:02:47.900> being<00:02:48.140> like<00:02:48.440> half<00:02:49.340> inch

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
here so it ends up being like half inch

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.449 
here so it ends up being like half inch
thick<00:02:50.090> around<00:02:50.390> the<00:02:50.570> edge<00:02:50.950> where<00:02:51.950> he's<00:02:52.100> told<00:02:52.340> to

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
thick around the edge where he's told to

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:55.540 
thick around the edge where he's told to
lock<00:02:52.670> into<00:02:53.890> so<00:02:54.890> this<00:02:55.010> thing<00:02:55.250> is<00:02:55.370> actually

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550 
lock into so this thing is actually

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:00.340 
lock into so this thing is actually
built<00:02:55.970> pretty<00:02:56.180> good<00:02:56.510> for<00:02:57.730> $99<00:02:58.730> safe<00:02:59.200> and<00:03:00.200> then

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
built pretty good for $99 safe and then

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:04.540 
built pretty good for $99 safe and then
inside<00:03:00.800> you've<00:03:01.010> got<00:03:01.040> a<00:03:02.680> shelf<00:03:03.680> you<00:03:03.980> can<00:03:04.250> put<00:03:04.430> in

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
inside you've got a shelf you can put in

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:10.229 
inside you've got a shelf you can put in
there<00:03:05.320> step<00:03:06.340> adjustability<00:03:07.340> with<00:03:07.760> these<00:03:07.970> uh

are<00:03:26.989> some<00:03:27.170> holes<00:03:27.519> pre-drilled<00:03:28.519> so<00:03:29.180> we<00:03:30.049> can

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
are some holes pre-drilled so we can

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.789 
are some holes pre-drilled so we can
anchor<00:03:30.530> this<00:03:30.709> to<00:03:31.040> a<00:03:31.070> wall<00:03:31.400> and<00:03:32.620> little<00:03:33.620> piece

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:22.010 
batteries in there five years later

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:24.220 
batteries in there five years later
they're<00:06:22.220> still<00:06:22.490> working<00:06:22.640> but<00:06:23.630> I<00:06:23.690> you<00:06:23.990> know<00:06:24.020> I'd

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:24.230 
they're still working but I you know I'd

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:26.920 
they're still working but I you know I'd
run<00:06:24.940> every<00:06:25.940> couple<00:06:26.210> of<00:06:26.240> years<00:06:26.330> change<00:06:26.780> them

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:26.930 
run every couple of years change them

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:28.630 
run every couple of years change them
out<00:06:27.080> put<00:06:27.350> some<00:06:27.380> Duracell<00:06:27.950> Zin<00:06:28.220> there<00:06:28.370> are<00:06:28.460> some

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:28.640 
out put some Duracell Zin there are some

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:31.930 
out put some Duracell Zin there are some
good<00:06:28.820> ones<00:06:29.680> just<00:06:30.680> to<00:06:30.830> be<00:06:30.980> safe<00:06:31.190> but<00:06:31.670> there<00:06:31.850> is

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:31.940 
good ones just to be safe but there is

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:35.170 
good ones just to be safe but there is
also<00:06:32.150> a<00:06:32.330> way<00:06:32.540> to<00:06:32.600> open<00:06:33.080> the<00:06:33.230> safe<00:06:33.500> with<00:06:34.490> a<00:06:34.520> key

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:35.180 
also a way to open the safe with a key

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:38.260 
also a way to open the safe with a key
if<00:06:35.330> those<00:06:35.630> batteries<00:06:36.080> do<00:06:36.290> die<00:06:36.500> and<00:06:37.270> that's

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:38.270 
if those batteries do die and that's

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:40.720 
if those batteries do die and that's
kind<00:06:38.660> of<00:06:38.720> one<00:06:38.960> negative<00:06:39.260> that<00:06:39.860> I<00:06:39.890> see<00:06:40.280> about<00:06:40.580> it

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:40.730 
kind of one negative that I see about it

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:43.690 
kind of one negative that I see about it
it's<00:06:41.420> not<00:06:41.600> going<00:06:41.750> to<00:06:41.840> be<00:06:41.900> a<00:06:41.930> secure<00:06:42.520> since<00:06:43.520> you

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:43.700 
it's not going to be a secure since you

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:47.820 
it's not going to be a secure since you
do<00:06:43.850> have<00:06:44.000> a<00:06:44.030> way<00:06:44.900> to<00:06:44.930> open<00:06:45.260> it<00:06:45.410> with<00:06:46.400> a<00:06:46.460> key<00:06:46.820> also

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:47.830 
do have a way to open it with a key also

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:53.020 
do have a way to open it with a key also
be<00:06:48.830> a<00:06:48.860> little<00:06:49.190> less<00:06:49.280> secure<00:06:49.850> and<00:06:51.850> it'd<00:06:52.850> be

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:53.030 
be a little less secure and it'd be

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:54.640 
be a little less secure and it'd be
better<00:06:53.240> if<00:06:53.360> you<00:06:53.690> could<00:06:53.810> actually<00:06:53.960> change<00:06:54.200> the

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:54.650 
better if you could actually change the

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:57.580 
better if you could actually change the
batteries<00:06:55.070> from<00:06:55.220> the<00:06:55.370> outside<00:06:55.790> here<00:06:56.500> for<00:06:57.500> the

00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:57.590 
batteries from the outside here for the

00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:04.590 
batteries from the outside here for the
keypad<00:07:00.160> okay<00:07:01.160> okay<00:07:01.730> guys<00:07:01.910> take<00:07:02.540> care

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:04.600 
keypad okay okay guys take care

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:07.150 
keypad okay okay guys take care
so<00:07:05.600> what<00:07:05.810> you<00:07:05.930> do<00:07:06.050> is<00:07:06.170> you<00:07:06.260> turn<00:07:06.440> this<00:07:06.680> up<00:07:06.920> or

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:07.160 
so what you do is you turn this up or

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:11.100 
so what you do is you turn this up or
knob<00:07:08.000> and<00:07:08.420> then<00:07:08.630> you<00:07:08.720> can<00:07:08.870> open<00:07:09.170> this<00:07:09.320> one<00:07:09.590> here

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:11.110 
knob and then you can open this one here

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:15.550 
knob and then you can open this one here
yeah<00:07:12.160> unlocked<00:07:13.160> already
