becomes in two months for delivery so I

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.109 
becomes in two months for delivery so I
kept<00:01:06.270> on<00:01:06.420> putting<00:01:06.659> it<00:01:06.810> off<00:01:07.700> but<00:01:08.700> in<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:08.970> end

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
kept on putting it off but in the end

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.520 
kept on putting it off but in the end
the<00:01:09.299> thought<00:01:09.510> no<00:01:09.720> I<00:01:09.750> bite<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.140> bullet<00:01:10.260> because
