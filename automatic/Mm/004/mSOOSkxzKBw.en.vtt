as<00:00:28.920> well<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:30.240> DCPD<00:00:31.109> Jenny<00:00:31.489> it's<00:00:32.489> a<00:00:32.550> true<00:00:32.730> twin

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059

as well the DCPD Jenny it's a true twin
board<00:00:33.120> of<00:00:33.660> course<00:00:33.840> and<00:00:33.989> that<00:00:34.079> was<00:00:34.170> the

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
board of course and that was the

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.410 
board of course and that was the
challenge<00:00:34.440> indeed<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:35.219> exact<00:00:35.610> same<00:00:35.940> shape

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
challenge indeed the exact same shape

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.330 
challenge indeed the exact same shape
but<00:00:36.989> what's<00:00:37.290> unique<00:00:37.590> about<00:00:37.680> this<00:00:37.920> board<00:00:38.160> is

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
but what's unique about this board is

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.000 
but what's unique about this board is
that<00:00:38.399> anti<00:00:39.149> camber<00:00:39.690> profile<00:00:40.170> shape<00:00:40.440> of<00:00:40.800> that

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
that anti camber profile shape of that

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.430 
that anti camber profile shape of that
has<00:00:41.420> in<00:00:42.420> between<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.750> stances<00:00:43.140> could<00:00:43.320> be<00:00:43.410> a

has in between the stances could be a

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.430 
has in between the stances could be a

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
zone on the nose of the tail and then

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.330 
zone on the nose of the tail and then
there's<00:00:51.899> a<00:00:51.960> radius<00:00:52.500> to<00:00:52.710> flat<00:00:53.270> nose<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:54.690> tail

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:55.340 
there's a radius to flat nose and tail

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.380 
there's a radius to flat nose and tail
there's<00:00:56.340> a<00:00:56.399> couple<00:00:56.579> flat<00:00:56.820> 7th<00:00:57.149> done<00:00:57.239> here

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
there's a couple flat 7th done here

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.910 
there's a couple flat 7th done here
that's<00:00:57.600> pretty<00:00:57.870> much<00:00:57.960> what<00:00:58.199> it<00:00:58.320> is<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.739> flat

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
that's pretty much what it is the flat

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.220 
that's pretty much what it is the flat

and stuff the beauty genady is gonna
have<00:01:14.520> a<00:01:14.549> flex<00:01:14.880> rating<00:01:14.970> of<00:01:15.180> 5<00:01:15.570> so<00:01:16.229> it's<00:01:16.320> right<00:01:16.470> in

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
have a flex rating of 5 so it's right in

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.170 
have a flex rating of 5 so it's right in
the<00:01:16.920> middle<00:01:16.950> and<00:01:17.460> you<00:01:17.549> can<00:01:17.580> pretty<00:01:17.850> much<00:01:17.939> do

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
the middle and you can pretty much do

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.899 
the middle and you can pretty much do
everything<00:01:18.390> with<00:01:18.960> this<00:01:19.200> board<00:01:19.759> even<00:01:20.759> though

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
everything with this board even though

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.740 
everything with this board even though
it<00:01:21.750> is<00:01:21.960> rated<00:01:22.380> a<00:01:22.409> reflection<00:01:23.070> of<00:01:23.159> 5<00:01:23.369> I<00:01:23.750> feel

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
it is rated a reflection of 5 I feel

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.960 
it is rated a reflection of 5 I feel
that<00:01:25.619> when<00:01:25.770> I<00:01:25.860> read<00:01:26.040> this<00:01:26.159> thing<00:01:26.340> it<00:01:26.549> seems<00:01:26.820> a

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
that when I read this thing it seems a

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.030 
that when I read this thing it seems a
lot<00:01:27.240> softer<00:01:27.659> than<00:01:27.869> that<00:01:28.049> and<00:01:28.470> that<00:01:28.650> might<00:01:29.009> be

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
lot softer than that and that might be

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.640 
lot softer than that and that might be
because<00:01:29.640> of<00:01:29.820> that<00:01:30.060> anti<00:01:30.479> camber<00:01:30.960> profile

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
because of that anti camber profile

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.910 
because of that anti camber profile
shape<00:01:32.060> inside<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.390> dbj<00:01:34.049> is<00:01:34.079> an<00:01:34.470> ass<00:01:34.619> for<00:01:34.860> a

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
shape inside the dbj is an ass for a

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.190 
shape inside the dbj is an ass for a
core<00:01:35.220> what's<00:01:36.119> unique<00:01:36.360> about<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.659> core<00:01:36.869> is

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
core what's unique about the core is

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.620 
core what's unique about the core is
that<00:01:37.710> there's<00:01:37.950> actually<00:01:38.100> a<00:01:38.520> camber<00:01:39.090> profile

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
that there's actually a camber profile

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.440 
that there's actually a camber profile
shape<00:01:39.960> to<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.439> core<00:01:40.680> within<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.850> side<00:01:42.060> or

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
shape to the core within the side or

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.690 
shape to the core within the side or
inside<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:42.869> anti<00:01:43.439> camber<00:01:43.860> profile<00:01:44.250> shape<00:01:44.490> so

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
inside the anti camber profile shape so

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.069 
inside the anti camber profile shape so
the<00:01:45.090> board<00:01:45.299> actually<00:01:45.420> has<00:01:45.600> a<00:01:45.689> little<00:01:45.780> bit<00:01:45.930> of

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
the board actually has a little bit of

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.100 
the board actually has a little bit of
pop<00:01:46.290> where<00:01:46.890> you<00:01:47.520> might<00:01:47.759> think<00:01:48.119> it<00:01:48.240> doesn't<00:01:48.750> but

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
pop where you might think it doesn't but

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.030 
pop where you might think it doesn't but
actually

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
actually

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.880 
actually
a<00:01:50.100> little<00:01:50.430> bit<00:01:50.550> on<00:01:50.940> the<00:01:51.180> nose<00:01:51.330> to<00:01:51.480> the<00:01:51.540> tail

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
a little bit on the nose to the tail

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.010 
a little bit on the nose to the tail
