00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:13.370
 to touch this theme of lovers 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:21.490
 arming me a little bit of value not what 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:24.279
 I understand it gives me a very hard test 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:27.250
 I did thinking that women were going to be 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:29.980
 the first time I was going to lift 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.800
 his voice of protest from the escajadillo 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:37.180
 did this and good and so on etcetera 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:40.660
 how many years together fleeing from all of 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:44.900
 the moralists of the Puritans who 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:49.030
 they do not forgive those who do not understand 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:49.030
 that we are love 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.040
 Sun 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:05.530
 before 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:08.330
 those who sneak 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:12.630
 in a caress 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:15.740
 life is given 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.820
 that we are lovers 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:21.990
 without another destination 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:29.399
 every morning uncertain 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:32.270
 of our way that we are lovers that 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:39.369
 we do not give everything 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:39.369
 in the light of dawn in a see you soon 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.930
 I raise samÃ¡n 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:49.920
 in meats 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.920
 just ask 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.840

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.840
 week
