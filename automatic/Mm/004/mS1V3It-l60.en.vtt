00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
don't really recognize it that if you

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.230

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.490 
actually look closer there's just these
little<00:01:18.540> bubbles<00:01:19.049> that<00:01:19.140> you<00:01:19.350> can<00:01:19.500> see<00:01:19.710> that

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
little bubbles that you can see that

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.870 
little bubbles that you can see that
they're<00:01:22.500> not<00:01:22.650> really<00:01:22.979> as<00:01:23.220> much<00:01:23.250> as<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.700> bigger

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
they're not really as much as the bigger

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.780 
they're not really as much as the bigger
the<00:01:24.090> deal<00:01:24.330> it's<00:01:24.720> because<00:01:25.080> I<00:01:25.500> have<00:01:26.490> a<00:01:26.580> little

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
the deal it's because I have a little

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.780 
the deal it's because I have a little
bit<00:01:27.000> of<00:01:27.090> sediment<00:01:27.270> going<00:01:27.780> on<00:01:28.020> to<00:01:28.259> the

vacuum-form machine and then the plastic
was<00:01:32.939> put<00:01:33.240> on<00:01:33.390> top<00:01:33.600> of<00:01:33.659> it<00:01:34.159> leaving<00:01:35.159> a<00:01:35.340> little

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
creating natural shapes so this is a

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.740 
creating natural shapes so this is a
helmet<00:03:23.500> before<00:03:23.769> I<00:03:23.950> get<00:03:24.100> interrupted<00:03:24.400> this<00:03:25.299> is

and<00:05:12.389> the<00:05:12.719> brim<00:05:16.789> yeah<00:05:17.789> so<00:05:18.509> that's<00:05:18.689> basically

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:19.110 
and the brim yeah so that's basically

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:22.689 
and the brim yeah so that's basically
the<00:05:19.229> helmet<00:05:19.650> it<00:05:20.490> will<00:05:20.610> become<00:05:20.999> like<00:05:21.509> this

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:22.699 
the helmet it will become like this

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:26.239 
the helmet it will become like this
it's<00:05:23.699> a<00:05:23.789> bit<00:05:23.939> stronger<00:05:24.509> they<00:05:25.349> usually<00:05:25.529> add<00:05:25.889> a

00:05:26.239 --> 00:05:26.249 
it's a bit stronger they usually add a

00:05:26.249 --> 00:05:29.119 
it's a bit stronger they usually add a
good<00:05:26.639> thickness<00:05:26.999> around<00:05:27.900> the<00:05:27.990> back<00:05:28.169> and<00:05:28.199> the

00:05:29.119 --> 00:05:29.129 
good thickness around the back and the

00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:31.279 
good thickness around the back and the
chin<00:05:29.430> usually<00:05:30.150> because<00:05:30.930> that's<00:05:31.139> why<00:05:31.259> you're

00:05:31.279 --> 00:05:31.289 
chin usually because that's why you're

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:33.800 
chin usually because that's why you're
mostly<00:05:31.650> holding<00:05:32.069> it<00:05:32.159> either<00:05:32.310> there<00:05:32.699> or<00:05:32.969> back

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:33.810 
mostly holding it either there or back

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:36.469 
mostly holding it either there or back
here<00:05:34.259> so<00:05:35.099> that's<00:05:35.580> what<00:05:35.729> I<00:05:35.789> tend<00:05:35.969> to<00:05:36.060> thicken<00:05:36.330> it

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:36.479 
here so that's what I tend to thicken it

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:38.570 
here so that's what I tend to thicken it
up<00:05:36.599> a<00:05:36.719> little<00:05:36.840> bit<00:05:37.080> that's<00:05:37.560> why<00:05:37.770> there's<00:05:38.039> quite

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:38.580 
up a little bit that's why there's quite

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:40.700 
up a little bit that's why there's quite
a<00:05:38.610> bit<00:05:38.789> of<00:05:38.879> overspill<00:05:39.539> thick<00:05:40.110> over<00:05:40.469> school

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:40.710 
a bit of overspill thick over school

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:43.070 
a bit of overspill thick over school
because<00:05:41.699> you<00:05:41.819> want<00:05:41.939> to<00:05:41.969> make<00:05:42.120> I<00:05:42.300> try<00:05:42.810> to<00:05:42.870> get

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.080 
because you want to make I try to get

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:48.079 
because you want to make I try to get
these<00:05:43.409> edges<00:05:46.219> not<00:05:47.219> too<00:05:47.430> strong<00:05:47.699> that<00:05:47.729> weighs

00:05:48.079 --> 00:05:48.089 
these edges not too strong that weighs

00:05:48.089 --> 00:05:51.589 
these edges not too strong that weighs
down<00:05:48.120> the<00:05:48.330> helmet<00:05:48.689> too<00:05:48.810> much<00:05:49.310> but<00:05:50.310> here<00:05:50.599> once

00:05:51.589 --> 00:05:51.599 
down the helmet too much but here once

00:05:51.599 --> 00:05:54.679 
down the helmet too much but here once
you<00:05:52.580> cut<00:05:53.580> off<00:05:53.699> all<00:05:53.939> these<00:05:54.150> bits

00:05:54.679 --> 00:05:54.689 
you cut off all these bits

00:05:54.689 --> 00:05:58.670 
you cut off all these bits
sanim<00:05:55.620> off<00:05:56.389> you<00:05:57.389> just<00:05:57.659> put<00:05:58.110> him<00:05:58.199> in<00:05:58.319> there<00:05:58.499> and

00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:58.680 
sanim off you just put him in there and

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:00.170 
sanim off you just put him in there and
there<00:05:58.800> will<00:05:58.919> be<00:05:58.979> a<00:05:59.099> video<00:05:59.400> coming<00:05:59.849> in<00:05:59.939> a<00:05:59.999> week

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:00.180 
there will be a video coming in a week

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:02.450 
there will be a video coming in a week
or<00:06:00.330> two<00:06:00.509> I'm<00:06:01.110> waiting<00:06:01.499> for<00:06:01.529> the<00:06:01.770> hex<00:06:02.009> pattern

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:02.460 
or two I'm waiting for the hex pattern

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:05.629 
or two I'm waiting for the hex pattern
to<00:06:03.389> show<00:06:03.599> you<00:06:03.659> in<00:06:04.199> the<00:06:04.409> video<00:06:04.560> as<00:06:04.860> well<00:06:04.889> but<00:06:05.430> I

gotta wait for my X button to arrive

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:10.939 
gotta wait for my X button to arrive
currently<00:06:09.210> bought<00:06:09.449> a<00:06:09.479> decal<00:06:09.900> for<00:06:10.169> it<00:06:10.349> and<00:06:10.589> I'm

currently bought a decal for it and I'm
going<00:06:11.069> to<00:06:11.189> test<00:06:11.400> it<00:06:11.550> out<00:06:11.719> so<00:06:12.719> there<00:06:12.930> will<00:06:13.050> be<00:06:13.110> a

00:06:13.219 --> 00:06:13.229 
going to test it out so there will be a

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:15.649 
going to test it out so there will be a
video<00:06:13.560> up<00:06:13.770> on<00:06:13.979> how<00:06:14.219> to<00:06:14.279> complete<00:06:14.939> a<00:06:15.149> helmet

00:06:15.649 --> 00:06:15.659 
video up on how to complete a helmet

00:06:15.659 --> 00:06:20.869 
video up on how to complete a helmet
fully<00:06:16.169> so<00:06:18.020> yeah<00:06:19.020> these<00:06:19.409> ones<00:06:19.649> you<00:06:20.310> just<00:06:20.339> send

00:06:20.869 --> 00:06:20.879 
fully so yeah these ones you just send

00:06:20.879 --> 00:06:26.529 
fully so yeah these ones you just send
back<00:06:20.969> all<00:06:21.360> the<00:06:21.949> extra<00:06:22.949> bits<00:06:24.349> in<00:06:25.349> the<00:06:25.469> poor<00:06:25.680> spot

00:06:26.529 --> 00:06:26.539 
back all the extra bits in the poor spot

00:06:26.539 --> 00:06:30.459 
back all the extra bits in the poor spot
just<00:06:27.539> send<00:06:27.750> it<00:06:27.870> back<00:06:28.069> make<00:06:29.069> it<00:06:29.159> about<00:06:29.310> flat<00:06:29.669> and

00:06:30.459 --> 00:06:30.469 
just send it back make it about flat and

00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:35.119 
just send it back make it about flat and
yeah<00:06:31.469> see<00:06:32.129> those<00:06:32.339> little<00:06:32.580> air<00:06:32.759> bubbles<00:06:34.129> it

00:06:35.119 --> 00:06:35.129 
yeah see those little air bubbles it

00:06:35.129 --> 00:06:36.469 
yeah see those little air bubbles it
doesn't<00:06:35.399> really<00:06:35.520> matter<00:06:35.729> because<00:06:35.969> once<00:06:36.360> you

00:06:36.469 --> 00:06:36.479 
doesn't really matter because once you

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:38.480 
doesn't really matter because once you
sand<00:06:36.779> it<00:06:36.930> and<00:06:37.050> but<00:06:37.589> you<00:06:37.800> all<00:06:38.099> you<00:06:38.189> have<00:06:38.279> to<00:06:38.370> do

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:38.490 
sand it and but you all you have to do

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:41.589 
sand it and but you all you have to do
is<00:06:38.610> just<00:06:38.759> sand<00:06:38.999> around<00:06:39.779> the<00:06:39.930> sides<00:06:40.199> and<00:06:40.529> this

00:06:41.589 --> 00:06:41.599 
is just sand around the sides and this

00:06:41.599 --> 00:06:45.230 
is just sand around the sides and this
this<00:06:42.599> main<00:06:42.930> bit<00:06:43.139> here<00:06:43.529> where<00:06:44.159> the<00:06:44.370> actual<00:06:44.490> port

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:45.240 
this main bit here where the actual port

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:48.589 
this main bit here where the actual port
was<00:06:45.449> and<00:06:46.039> it<00:06:47.039> should<00:06:47.399> fit<00:06:47.819> in<00:06:48.029> there<00:06:48.270> and<00:06:48.389> I

00:06:48.589 --> 00:06:48.599 
was and it should fit in there and I

00:06:48.599 --> 00:06:50.929 
was and it should fit in there and I
just<00:06:48.629> super<00:06:49.110> glued<00:06:49.349> as<00:06:49.830> I<00:06:49.979> did<00:06:50.159> with<00:06:50.339> both<00:06:50.789> of

00:06:50.929 --> 00:06:50.939 
just super glued as I did with both of

00:06:50.939 --> 00:06:54.860 
just super glued as I did with both of
these<00:06:51.199> just<00:06:52.199> like<00:06:52.319> that<00:06:53.029> and<00:06:54.029> I<00:06:54.360> try<00:06:54.629> to<00:06:54.689> do

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:54.870 
these just like that and I try to do

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:57.260 
these just like that and I try to do
that<00:06:55.050> on<00:06:55.229> both<00:06:55.259> of<00:06:55.770> them<00:06:55.919> it<00:06:56.310> took<00:06:56.520> what<00:06:56.819> five

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:57.270 
that on both of them it took what five

00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:01.070 
that on both of them it took what five
minutes<00:06:57.419> to<00:06:57.749> line<00:06:57.899> them<00:06:58.020> up<00:06:58.339> and<00:06:59.689> yeah<00:07:00.689> so

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:01.080 
minutes to line them up and yeah so

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:03.249 
minutes to line them up and yeah so
that's<00:07:01.319> what<00:07:01.379> you'll<00:07:01.589> receive<00:07:01.710> these<00:07:02.460> will<00:07:02.849> be

00:07:03.249 --> 00:07:03.259 
that's what you'll receive these will be

00:07:03.259 --> 00:07:07.010 
that's what you'll receive these will be
black<00:07:04.259> when<00:07:04.740> you<00:07:04.860> get<00:07:05.039> them<00:07:05.360> there<00:07:06.360> the<00:07:06.539> LED

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:07.020 
black when you get them there the LED

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:10.159 
black when you get them there the LED
covers<00:07:07.439> that<00:07:07.620> I<00:07:07.680> put<00:07:08.189> with<00:07:08.490> my<00:07:08.990> helmets<00:07:09.990> to

00:07:10.159 --> 00:07:10.169 
covers that I put with my helmets to

00:07:10.169 --> 00:07:12.619 
covers that I put with my helmets to
cover<00:07:10.379> the<00:07:10.499> LEDs<00:07:10.879> they<00:07:11.879> will<00:07:12.060> be<00:07:12.180> dyed<00:07:12.360> like

00:07:12.619 --> 00:07:12.629 
cover the LEDs they will be dyed like

00:07:12.629 --> 00:07:15.350 
cover the LEDs they will be dyed like
when<00:07:12.810> you<00:07:12.899> do<00:07:13.020> get<00:07:13.229> them<00:07:13.639> I'm<00:07:14.639> just<00:07:15.060> I'm

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:15.360 
when you do get them I'm just I'm

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:17.719 
when you do get them I'm just I'm
cutting<00:07:15.779> more<00:07:15.990> out<00:07:16.229> so<00:07:16.860> it's<00:07:17.219> a<00:07:17.430> lot<00:07:17.580> more

00:07:17.719 --> 00:07:17.729 
cutting more out so it's a lot more

00:07:17.729 --> 00:07:20.509 
cutting more out so it's a lot more
easier<00:07:18.029> for<00:07:18.089> me<00:07:18.360> if<00:07:18.569> I<00:07:18.719> die<00:07:18.779> a<00:07:19.229> lot<00:07:20.009> of<00:07:20.159> them<00:07:20.310> in

00:07:20.509 --> 00:07:20.519 
easier for me if I die a lot of them in

00:07:20.519 --> 00:07:22.410 
easier for me if I die a lot of them in
one<00:07:20.789> batch<00:07:21.000> saves<00:07:21.389> me<00:07:21.599> buying<00:07:21.810> more<00:07:22.019> dye

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:22.420 
one batch saves me buying more dye
