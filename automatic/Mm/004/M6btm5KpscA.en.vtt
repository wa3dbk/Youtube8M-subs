00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:41.470 
about four to about three and a half you

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:42.960 
about four to about three and a half you
wouldn't<00:05:41.710> want<00:05:41.830> to<00:05:41.890> go<00:05:42.010> any<00:05:42.250> finer<00:05:42.550> than<00:05:42.760> that

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:42.970 
wouldn't want to go any finer than that

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:44.850 
wouldn't want to go any finer than that
because<00:05:43.180> then<00:05:43.450> it<00:05:43.570> will<00:05:44.260> not<00:05:44.470> extract<00:05:44.800> the

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:44.860 
because then it will not extract the

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:46.080 
because then it will not extract the
coffee<00:05:45.040> because<00:05:45.310> it's<00:05:45.430> too<00:05:45.610> fine<00:05:45.850> this

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:46.090

grinder<00:05:46.480> is<00:05:46.570> a<00:05:46.600> very<00:05:47.730> precise<00:05:48.930> grinder<00:05:49.930> so

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:50.940 
grinder is a very precise grinder so

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:53.520

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:53.530 
have it on fire you do want to move this

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:56.070 
have it on fire you do want to move this
it's<00:05:53.830> not<00:05:54.040> like<00:05:54.250> the<00:05:54.430> dosa<00:05:54.670> however<00:05:55.270> you<00:05:55.930> can

it's not like the dosa however you can

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.750 
it's not like the dosa however you can
only<00:05:56.230> move<00:05:56.500> this<00:05:56.770> when<00:05:57.040> the<00:05:57.190> grinder<00:05:57.610> is

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:57.760 
only move this when the grinder is

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:00.330 
only move this when the grinder is
