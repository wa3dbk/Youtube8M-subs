00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.129 
months up to here and that's not to say
that<00:00:14.549> I<00:00:14.610> haven't<00:00:14.759> had<00:00:15.120> any<00:00:15.360> video<00:00:15.630> to<00:00:15.870> reduce

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
that I haven't had any video to reduce

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.950 
that I haven't had any video to reduce
but<00:00:16.490> been<00:00:17.490> just<00:00:17.760> left<00:00:18.330> getting<00:00:18.570> in<00:00:18.750> the<00:00:18.840> way

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
but been just left getting in the way

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.689 
but been just left getting in the way
and<00:00:19.260> all<00:00:19.380> kinds<00:00:19.650> of<00:00:19.710> jazz<00:00:19.890> like<00:00:20.070> that<00:00:20.279> and<00:00:20.490> and

and all kinds of jazz like that and and

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.189 
and all kinds of jazz like that and and
just<00:00:20.910> pure<00:00:21.210> laziness<00:00:21.420> so<00:00:21.810> I<00:00:21.840> thought<00:00:22.080> I'd

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
just pure laziness so I thought I'd

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:23.390 
just pure laziness so I thought I'd
start<00:00:22.380> this<00:00:22.529> video<00:00:22.680> with<00:00:22.859> a<00:00:23.010> little<00:00:23.220> bit<00:00:23.310> of

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
start this video with a little bit of

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.170 
start this video with a little bit of
rat<00:00:23.609> rod<00:00:23.910> love<00:00:24.269> and<00:00:24.810> also<00:00:25.590> I'm<00:00:26.279> editing<00:00:27.000> this

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
rat rod love and also I'm editing this

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.470 
rat rod love and also I'm editing this
video<00:00:27.330> with<00:00:27.689> Final<00:00:28.019> Cut<00:00:28.170> Pro<00:00:28.490> 10<00:00:29.490> or<00:00:29.760> Final<00:00:30.390> Cut

so<00:00:33.300> getting<00:00:33.570> my<00:00:33.750> editing<00:00:34.440> chops<00:00:34.800> back<00:00:35.070> up<00:00:35.250> on

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
so getting my editing chops back up on

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.869 
so getting my editing chops back up on
this<00:00:35.550> this<00:00:35.880> up<00:00:36.120> here<00:00:36.510> that<00:00:36.780> I<00:00:36.870> just<00:00:36.899> got<00:00:37.879> even

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
this this up here that I just got even

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.250 
this this up here that I just got even
though<00:00:38.940> my<00:00:39.120> computer's<00:00:39.540> four<00:00:39.750> years<00:00:39.930> old<00:00:40.110> and

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
though my computer's four years old and

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.170 
though my computer's four years old and
this<00:00:40.379> is<00:00:40.440> not<00:00:41.250> necessarily<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.790> fastest

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
this is not necessarily the fastest

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.340 
this is not necessarily the fastest
thing<00:00:42.270> in<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.420> world<00:00:42.570> for<00:00:42.629> this<00:00:42.809> software<00:00:43.200> but

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
thing in the world for this software but

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.020 
thing in the world for this software but
gives<00:00:43.860> me<00:00:43.950> a<00:00:43.980> little<00:00:44.190> bit<00:00:44.340> more<00:00:44.520> flexibility

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
gives me a little bit more flexibility

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.770 
gives me a little bit more flexibility
but<00:00:45.270> I<00:00:45.480> figured<00:00:46.879> lots<00:00:47.879> of<00:00:48.000> video<00:00:48.270> Moz<00:00:48.750> will

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
but I figured lots of video Moz will

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.860 
but I figured lots of video Moz will
learn<00:00:49.770> a<00:00:49.800> new<00:00:50.100> piece<00:00:51.000> of<00:00:51.030> software<00:00:51.329> that<00:00:51.600> will

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
learn a new piece of software that will

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.600 
learn a new piece of software that will
help<00:00:51.960> me<00:00:52.140> in<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.289> future<00:00:52.350> I<00:00:52.680> guess<00:00:52.770> but

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
help me in the future I guess but

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.639 
help me in the future I guess but
anyways<00:00:53.910> this<00:00:54.090> is<00:00:54.270> from<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.660> Bernie<00:00:54.960> car<00:00:55.350> show

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
anyways this is from the Bernie car show

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.049 
anyways this is from the Bernie car show
I'm<00:00:55.860> not<00:00:55.920> sure<00:00:56.160> if<00:00:56.219> it's<00:00:56.340> classic<00:00:56.670> car<00:00:56.820> show<00:00:56.850> or

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
I'm not sure if it's classic car show or

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.479 
I'm not sure if it's classic car show or
what<00:00:57.360> kind<00:00:57.510> of<00:00:57.570> car<00:00:57.719> show<00:00:57.930> but<00:00:57.960> and<00:00:58.350> I<00:00:59.219> found

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
what kind of car show but and I found

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.849 
what kind of car show but and I found
these<00:01:00.449> these<00:01:00.809> two<00:01:00.870> rat<00:01:01.289> rods<00:01:01.530> that<00:01:01.649> were<00:01:01.739> kind

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
these these two rat rods that were kind

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.000 
these these two rat rods that were kind
of<00:01:01.949> close<00:01:02.039> to<00:01:02.250> each<00:01:02.370> other<00:01:02.520> and<00:01:03.229> they<00:01:04.229> did<00:01:04.860> the

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
of close to each other and they did the

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.539 
of close to each other and they did the
way<00:01:05.129> they<00:01:05.339> used<00:01:05.930> you<00:01:06.930> know<00:01:06.960> like<00:01:07.400> things<00:01:08.400> that

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
way they used you know like things that

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.120 
way they used you know like things that
some<00:01:08.820> people<00:01:09.060> will<00:01:09.150> call<00:01:09.299> junk<00:01:09.830> to<00:01:10.830> kind<00:01:11.100> of

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
some people will call junk to kind of

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.429 
some people will call junk to kind of
accent<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.610> car<00:01:11.850> it's<00:01:12.090> just<00:01:12.299> amazing<00:01:12.810> let<00:01:13.380> me

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
accent the car it's just amazing let me

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:14.810 
accent the car it's just amazing let me
look<00:01:13.560> at<00:01:13.680> that<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.920> control<00:01:14.280> rod<00:01:14.460> over<00:01:14.670> there

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
look at that the control rod over there

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.670 
look at that the control rod over there
before<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.439> steering<00:01:16.820> mechanism<00:01:17.820> I<00:01:17.909> guess

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
before the steering mechanism I guess

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:24.830 
before the steering mechanism I guess
the<00:01:19.680> old<00:01:19.799> coffee<00:01:20.960> sacks<00:01:23.270> for<00:01:24.270> it<00:01:24.450> you<00:01:24.659> know<00:01:24.750> the

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
the old coffee sacks for it you know the

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.109 
the old coffee sacks for it you know the
interior<00:01:25.350> staple<00:01:25.830> on<00:01:25.920> there<00:01:26.159> or<00:01:26.580> however<00:01:26.820> it's

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
interior staple on there or however it's

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.710 
interior staple on there or however it's
attached<00:01:28.729> rust<00:01:29.729> everywhere<00:01:30.270> and<00:01:30.479> that's<00:01:30.630> uh

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
attached rust everywhere and that's uh

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.390 
attached rust everywhere and that's uh
this<00:01:31.110> goes<00:01:31.259> out<00:01:31.409> to<00:01:31.470> wasabi<00:01:31.950> a<00:01:31.979> little<00:01:32.250> bit<00:01:32.340> of

this goes out to wasabi a little bit of

this goes out to wasabi a little bit of
wasabi<00:01:32.490> everywhere<00:01:35.659> lack<00:01:36.659> of<00:01:36.840> door<00:01:36.990> handles

which<00:01:48.750> is<00:01:48.869> pretty<00:01:49.049> interesting<00:01:49.320> these<00:01:50.060> these

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
which is pretty interesting these these
