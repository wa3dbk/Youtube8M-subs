00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
gelatin is actually going to go for the

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:17.360 
gelatin is actually going to go for the
return<00:03:15.600> which<00:03:15.900> is<00:03:16.050> going<00:03:16.140> to<00:03:16.200> do<00:03:16.410> around<00:03:16.739> 50

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
return which is going to do around 50

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.630 
return which is going to do around 50
plus<00:03:17.580> damage<00:03:18.000> now<00:03:18.720> you<00:03:18.780> see<00:03:19.260> that<00:03:19.459> if<00:03:20.459> you've

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
plus damage now you see that if you've

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.789 
plus damage now you see that if you've
ever<00:03:20.760> aggress<00:03:21.060> out<00:03:21.269> or<00:03:21.450> seed<00:03:22.140> bomb<00:03:22.350> i<00:03:22.500> think

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
ever aggress out or seed bomb i think

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:24.740 
ever aggress out or seed bomb i think
the<00:03:23.160> seed<00:03:23.370> bomb<00:03:23.519> would<00:03:23.700> not<00:03:23.880> have<00:03:24.060> done<00:03:24.239> like

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
the seed bomb would not have done like

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.420 
the seed bomb would not have done like
20<00:03:24.959> damage<00:03:25.290> it<00:03:25.500> would<00:03:25.620> have<00:03:25.709> done<00:03:25.829> like<00:03:26.010> 15

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
20 damage it would have done like 15

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:27.949 
20 damage it would have done like 15
maybe<00:03:26.670> or<00:03:27.060> something<00:03:27.090> and<00:03:27.510> i<00:03:27.600> might<00:03:27.840> have

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
maybe or something and i might have

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:30.080 
maybe or something and i might have
lived<00:03:28.110> that<00:03:28.260> next<00:03:28.530> return<00:03:28.829> so<00:03:29.610> that<00:03:30.000> was

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
lived that next return so that was

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:31.340 
lived that next return so that was
actually<00:03:30.180> pretty<00:03:30.390> crucial<00:03:30.750> i<00:03:30.989> do<00:03:31.049> have

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
actually pretty crucial i do have

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.190 
actually pretty crucial i do have
pursued<00:03:31.769> on<00:03:32.010> this<00:03:32.310> toxic<00:03:32.970> crook<00:03:33.150> but<00:03:33.360> instead

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
thinking that he would stay in and do

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:38.479 
thinking that he would stay in and do
pitiful<00:03:37.680> amount<00:03:37.769> of<00:03:37.950> damage<00:03:38.190> even<00:03:38.310> though

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
pitiful amount of damage even though

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:40.880
