00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:11.549
 how many times we happen to see complex geometries 

00:00:12.329 --> 00:00:13.389
 and to think 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:14.459
 with my dog 

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:17.459
 I can 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.800
 if we analyze the surfaces of this structure 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.679
 we can seize the giometti 

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:25.679
 that can serve us for represent 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:29.539
 let's take a small example 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.830
 with the 3d polyline tool 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:35.830
 we draw or 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:40.650
 and with two others we define the surface 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.950
 apply the curves to the cous surface command 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.870
 duplicate surface 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.040
 we determine by repeating the operation on the other sides 

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:04.380
 let's abandon this sophisticated architecture 

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:08.850
 to show how to solve a simple but everyday example 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.240
 how we manage to create the soccer predictive plumbing 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.220
 drawing the polylines which deeds I have rowed 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.220
 site sections 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.440
 this trondheim 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.720
 we will apply the command that will exploit the section on the path dani of finley 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.530
 and so also for the gutter channel 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.670
 we have seen 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.530
 the only passage we can create structures 3b is safe any 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:00.880
 route 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.639
 we show reezzi a problematic de cataldo restoration 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.139
 reproduce the marble columns shown here 

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:11.139
 it could be simpler than you think 

00:02:11.859 --> 00:02:17.259
 if we imagine the axis of this column we will be able to design the same one 

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:21.389
 which will give with the command revolution transformed to the column in the three 

00:02:21.389 --> 00:02:24.389
 dimensions 

00:02:32.919 --> 00:02:36.319
 what we have shown is a taste of what archives 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:37.939
 will solve in your work
