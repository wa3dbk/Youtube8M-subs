00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.410
 revolution our channel on youtube beauty 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.790
 Caque talking here and my video 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.640
 comment today as you are 

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:22.470
 seeing there it's call of duty black ops 2 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.119
 of playstation 3 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.920
 this game play you see there 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.619
 I gotta get the sweat me that the 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.349
 sport becomes higher rather a game 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.690
 bad player that I can not even get 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.580
 Lucky yes it's not that hard it seems 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.250
 just have to take some care in 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:40.890
 initial but the best of gameplay is 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.860
 that I was not even using tete and 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.110
 nor why there are two very things 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.659
 much needed you have a 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.030
 good gameplay was without either 

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:52.890
 and yet I managed to catch the sweat not 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.799
 I'll talk because I'm going to give some 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.049
 tips on how to get deals from these 

00:00:55.799 --> 00:01:02.159
 things because you were without technician 

00:00:58.049 --> 00:01:04.199
 without miss because it was only mp7 carmo 

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:07.770
 I'm using ippon because it's the 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:10.500
 next is the golden camouflage is the 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.299
 last suitcase count for you 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.300
 get her you have to get all 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:18.480
 the others, then, to achieve this 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:21.960
 there are two camouflages is one you have to 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:23.820
 do not pick up without using port and 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:29.550
 another has to do with or without picking up without 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:32.220
 using gas techniques is rubbish and so 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:34.530
 Are you or were you without both of us? 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:38.159
 I got the two camouflages at once 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:40.830
 only then one after and it 's got to 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.690
 I'll get another one, I'd have won. 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.960
 time with this is pick up or two 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:49.080
 camouflage at once but clear this 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:52.030
 will make it very difficult and will act 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:55.479
 to be very bad she will 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:59.020
 She's going to shake her friend a lot . 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:01.659
 can be smaller depending on the viewing 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.790
 satellite parks but if you use the 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:07.030
 accuracy and precision 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:10.569
 so it all helps your gun a lot 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:12.970
 help many and gameplay and with that I 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:14.950
 I found a game and if that funk game 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:18.760
 was pretty cool right even more I do not 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:21.850
 I am an expert in which fidati is neither 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:24.700
 addicted no monster is how much 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:27.070
 It then he even has focused channels 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.290
 only in which city and to seek are some 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:33.010
 monsters is like the john and the 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.390
 ayache and joão mateus rh is less should 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.330
 to be less known, huh? 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.489
 but hayashi is already better known inem 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.739
 are two guys who play a lot 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:43.720
 players that I inspired a lot 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:45.130
 If you want to see the channels, I'll go 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.160
 leave in the description if someone 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:50.620
 know some good tips for you 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:54.130
 get escort trick né 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.600
 the first is the game mode tires are 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:57.790
 seeing there I'm throwing a pound 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:00.459
 according to the mech. 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:03.760
 You have to kill and confirm your kine. 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:05.950
 taking that plate and why 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:09.310
 This is a good way for you to get the 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:12.730
 tire escort because you're going to kill kill 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:14.110
 to give the point and you get the platelet 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.570
 It will give you more points, I'm not mistaken. 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:20.859
 100 points each plate or plate 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:23.560
 and the denial plate is 

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:26.079
 so you have two drumsticks that role 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:29.410
 determinant of points and you will see 

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:30.940
 direct plaque all over the menga map 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:34.090
 so you will get points 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:37.269
 easily in this mode, and beyond 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:39.840
 kills also have the platelets that go 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:42.010
 help a lot has the sport flex 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:45.190
 assists him teammate 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:47.769
 confirming low is you earn points if 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.299
 for example you kill but if you do not 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:51.310
 pick up the plate yesterday problems one 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:53.470
 Friend, if I catch you, you'll win. 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.959
 point does not earn as many points as 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:58.480
 You 'd have gotten it yourself but still 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:04:01.480
 helps a lot 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:03.909
 Another thing that also helps is your 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:06.040
 if I can see that I am 

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:08.650
 moving more slowly 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:11.980
 looking sideways such soft more 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:13.599
 calmly what is the right thing you do right? 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.189
 but there are some who run out the same way 

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:17.280
 crazy that's what i usually do 

00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:20.079
 it's not that I went more slowly 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:22.090
 because I was yes because it repeats itself 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:25.360
 but then does not give right to run for a long 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:30.009
 time that's was the excuse I 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:31.870
 I got what else to connect your 

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:35.860
 connection must be good if you have a 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:37.509
 Yellow connection is already horrible to stay 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.419
 horrible for you 

00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:41.740
 the reflection its reflection snows and reveals 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:44.560
 It has to be very good to test you. 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:46.930
 You should keep clay and you have to. 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:50.530
 good is because you are sleepy will play 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:53.530
 if we have to hydrate if he 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:55.810
 Are you hungry? Are you going to play badly? 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.580
 it's in port it helps a lot 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:58.870
 You see the ballooning is that 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:01.389
 a friend of mine 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:04.360
 part of the flank is our code 

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:06.099
 end of the night and picked up another is leaving 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:08.410
 gift tags to me like you 

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:12.639
 they are only seeing 200 more points per 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:17.760
 Luck, I'll take it, too. 

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:20.050
 flop and see skeptical instead 767 before my 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:22.030
 repair back must see game 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:25.300
 There were 87 besides mine I got now 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:28.030
 just there and the penultimate thing before 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:29.680
 of sweat but in the eyes of yen a is not 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:33.310
 this was the penultimate that a single gene 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:35.289
 past running friend of the old part only 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:37.659
 he ended up dying and I know how already 

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:39.159
 was 17 already knew where such an enemy and 

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:42.220
 I got the sony 

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:45.729
 who is that set but not a single gene 

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:47.050
 slow in the beginning I died a lot more 

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:49.389
 then I was able to recover and 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:52.090
 I can get the sweat, that's my 

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:54.729
 according to Sonia I had already taken another 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:56.169
 playing on fm radio and there I really 

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:58.060
 I was aiming to get the formula 

00:05:56.169 --> 00:06:00.159
 1 is a text that did not have time yet 

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:02.740
 I was in the mood and that was it. 

00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:04.690
 shit even though it was only at the end of the 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:06.759
 I realized that I had attachment to the 

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:09.039
 men in part the seventh quiet and 

00:06:06.759 --> 00:06:12.759
 I saved the game, you decide to show it to me. 

00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:15.340
 Did you as I was talking on board? 

00:06:12.759 --> 00:06:17.590
 helps a lot after the whole team over there 

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:20.020
 is bruno bruno magalhães part of the channel 

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:22.509
 tgrt also the noise 

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:25.090
 rober te lo só they are all amigos 

00:06:22.509 --> 00:06:28.810
 Was everyone talking on Skype? 

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:32.590
 communication is another tip is the example 

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:34.810
 It is possible to order the staff nor can a 

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:36.460
 Beautiful and cute, it's not going to go here. 

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:39.159
 here somebody goes ahead because I 'm 

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:41.710
 with an escort that, as was the case with 

00:06:39.159 --> 00:06:43.629
 eyes and I asked peri to leave the tag perina 

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:46.409
 front to give me strength to power 

00:06:43.629 --> 00:06:51.430
 try to get sweat on then it helps 

00:06:46.409 --> 00:06:53.710
 much and all this without counting the training of the 

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:56.470
 I've been there two months in a row. 

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:59.440
 training in the chest of you black ops 2 neo 

00:06:56.470 --> 00:07:02.050
 I played a good time and then 

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:04.419
 but these are the tips I 

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:06.580
 I have for you reflex training 

00:07:04.419 --> 00:07:08.470
 movement which is as good 

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:09.940
 way to get the chic sport 

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:12.219
 This is it people, I hope you have 

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:14.590
 liked that match was one 

00:07:12.219 --> 00:07:17.979
 name, let's say tortoise, right? 

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:19.659
 it was not a spectacular gameplay 

00:07:17.979 --> 00:07:21.729
 excellent but does not imply legal 

00:07:19.659 --> 00:07:25.090
 show you soon will serve as a 

00:07:21.729 --> 00:07:27.880
 quit the campaign and more of multiplayer is 

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:30.159
 more matches in a general analysis of the 

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:31.840
 multiplayer pedro claims to access the blog 

00:07:30.159 --> 00:07:34.740
