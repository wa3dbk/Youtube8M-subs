really use foundation during the school

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.900 
really use foundation during the school
year<00:00:21.810> because<00:00:22.260> it's<00:00:22.380> just<00:00:22.439> a<00:00:22.650> hassle<00:00:22.830> and<00:00:23.279> so

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
year because it's just a hassle and so

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.460 
year because it's just a hassle and so
I'm<00:00:24.060> just<00:00:24.240> using<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.660> Maybelline<00:00:25.230> concealer

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.999 
and I find it just laughs better on my
skin<00:00:30.029> than<00:00:30.179> foundation<00:00:30.810> and<00:00:31.019> takes<00:00:31.740> less<00:00:31.980> time

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009
