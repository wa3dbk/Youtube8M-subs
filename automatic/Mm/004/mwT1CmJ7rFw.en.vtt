00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:16.670
 before you volvo v40 cross country 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:20.000
 cars are interesting and asked for 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:21.290
 as simple and accessible to tell 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.040
 about the chips of this car 

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:28.009
 there are plenty of them but perhaps the most interesting 

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:29.960
 and the most controversial car skill 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:32.989
 time to brake without driver 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:36.680
 Risky thing so Andrei is 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:39.559
 Dear you this is a new type of car 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.210
 called the auto ball it will perform 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:43.910
 the role of the car itself 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.800
 who drives along the road no we didn't get off 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.380
 see you crazy for flying 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.360
 cars the future and in the present city 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:52.790
 sect reacted to our art object 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.450
 through time the principle of operation of the system is based 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.430
 on radar 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:56.600
 they are located on the windshield and 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.340
 grille 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.380
 radar monitor the speed of movement 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.470
 in front of cars in the distance 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:05.150
 up to 6 meters and laser technology 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:06.979
 automatically apply brakes case 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:10.450
 if the driver is not too careful 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:10.450
 monitor the situation on the road 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.960
 it worked see 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.570
 wait on the gauchi don't need me right now 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.450
 In general, there are no legs, that's where I want to take them away. 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:24.299
 I want to now or me now I now 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.920
 I will remove this radar which we are now 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:37.799
 use it can work on the most 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:42.750
 different speeds yep let's show what 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:46.440
 able to leg i start to believe again 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:49.590
 all is well that's good braking 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:51.899
 what kind of braking woman am I 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.090
 really believe city ​​sept able 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.220
 see pedestrians and not to be confused with 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.899
 by car or tree as an object 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.850
 will be in sight of the system 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.920
 electronics will command and system 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:06.259
 stop but the basis is the first time we have 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.259
 failed to approach attempts 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.629
 I will go further 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:33.240
 don't repeat it andrew earned a couple 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.990
 bruises 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:38.520
 several gray hairs appeared in the village 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:40.200
 volvo can hold a car 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.430
 who rides ahead of the car will 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.170
 automatically accelerate 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.960
 stops and even hold on 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.670
 lane if there is a marking on the road 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:49.680
 autopilot operates at speeds up to 50 km 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.490
 per hour by the way the system is automatic 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.560
 piloting 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:54.210
 starts with just one button a 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.060
 depress the gas pedal or brake 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:03:09.870
 serves as a shutdown command and so we start 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:15.530
 and it starts forward that i mirror and and 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:15.530
 the car stops itself just 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:26.760
 know friends everything we do here 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:29.420
 never repeat it very much 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.420
 dangerously 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:35.180
 Well, look here is one car here is the second 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:35.840
 Machine principle is quite normal for 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.840
 Moscow 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.550
 distances such a window where we can 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:44.060
 pierce 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:47.390
 I’m ready to detect electronics first 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:51.850
 then you i start the stopwatch you have everything 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:51.850
 ready let's go 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:58.230
 press the brake does not forget the brake 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:01.550
 work separately starts strong 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:04.670
 it ’s raining 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:07.910
 Well, let's come on what asks to quit 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:12.650
 they are shifting gear steering 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:15.660
 he turns himself so that 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:18.650
 so the system has self-parked 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:21.450
 car in 39 seconds 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:22.920
 Olya will park heavier 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:25.830
 conditions why because what begins 

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:32.130
 let's shower oh come on 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:34.560
 faster Let's let me help you to 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:37.380
 ruin that side let's do everything ok 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:39.510
 brakes I can say that Olga everything 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:44.310
 Equally surpassed electronics engineer because 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:46.590
 she parked for 33 seconds will have 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:49.770
 the program is also called volvo on 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:53.130
 call maria i can close the car 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:55.020
 about the car closed the romance when you're on 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:05:00.530
 parking lot you can't find your 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:00.530
 car you can do like this 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:08.100
 I am working on this car and 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:10.460
 hide you and you try me with 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:17.790
 using the search card system to find 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:20.850
 try here the map shows 

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:23.430
 location flashing blue light 

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:25.590
 but I personally do not yet say anything 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:27.570
 I understand that man I am a car 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:30.060
 from Andrei who rode on the gondry 

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:32.940
 looking for a secluded place Olga tried 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:34.800
 make friends volvo on call to 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:36.120
 use this system your gadget 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.500
 must be in range 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.480
 cellular network 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:43.890
 and you may need knowledge 

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:45.810
 the corners of the world I will ride through the lane 

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:47.540
 more than that we have a cross country car 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:49.760
 he drove through this mud 

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:54.680
 here by the way could have been typical cottage 

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:55.840
 off road country road there is no road if 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:58.550
 did you know 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:01.520
 Well, here's the result, in principle, maps 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:04.550
 helped maybe sat not in the map in 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:06.680
 the girl one little function is he 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:09.290
 count this is a magic button when pressed 

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:12.950
 which we contact the operator 

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:15.170
 via satellite and we can ask him 

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:18.770
 about anything for example here I want today 

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:21.880
 go to the cinema and invite a special mule 

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:25.160
 com axel tusuyut maxim hello 

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:28.760
 could you suggest any 

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:34.520
 nearest cinema east of that 

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:37.720
 places where we are yes I see on 

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:43.970
 couch find out what movie goes there 

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:46.760
 the event these men militia in the oven 

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:48.980
 snail bazhanova anthem two arguments 

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:51.530
 perhaps the aviator prince will say through you 

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:53.750
 can be ordered yes you can 

00:06:51.530 --> 00:07:00.130
 fear questions are we at the moment where 

00:06:53.750 --> 00:07:01.700
 we are a minute from the outlet to the delivery 

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:06.130
 from novosib 

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:06.130
 well friends and it also works
