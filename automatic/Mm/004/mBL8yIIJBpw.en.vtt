00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.520 
choose from now on the scale I said
there<00:02:51.120> was<00:02:51.209> 8<00:02:51.420> the<00:02:51.660> reason<00:02:51.930> why<00:02:52.050> there<00:02:52.260> was<00:02:52.350> 9

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
there was 8 the reason why there was 9

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.509 
there was 8 the reason why there was 9
is<00:02:52.739> because<00:02:53.510> this<00:02:54.510> note<00:02:54.780> right<00:02:54.810> here<00:02:55.310> is<00:02:56.310> the

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
is because this note right here is the

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:00.590 
is because this note right here is the
same<00:02:56.760> note<00:02:57.030> is<00:02:57.269> here<00:02:57.540> just<00:02:57.870> octave<00:02:58.350> lower<00:02:59.600> this

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
same note is here just octave lower this

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.890 
same note is here just octave lower this
note<00:03:00.810> is<00:03:00.959> also<00:03:01.170> active<00:03:01.709> lower<00:03:01.950> than<00:03:02.820> is<00:03:03.000> no<00:03:03.180> but

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
note is also active lower than is no but

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:09.640 
note is also active lower than is no but
the<00:03:04.110> scale<00:03:04.410> starts<00:03:04.890> here<00:03:07.250> okay

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
the scale starts here okay

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.530 
the scale starts here okay
now<00:03:10.650> the<00:03:10.710> reason<00:03:11.070> why<00:03:11.160> I<00:03:11.190> chose<00:03:11.670> to<00:03:12.000> sample<00:03:12.420> a

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
now the reason why I chose to sample a

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.560 
now the reason why I chose to sample a
long<00:03:12.780> note<00:03:13.080> is<00:03:13.290> so<00:03:13.980> I<00:03:14.010> can<00:03:14.310> hold<00:03:14.550> notes<00:03:14.970> longer

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
long note is so I can hold notes longer

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:23.660 
long note is so I can hold notes longer
if<00:03:15.660> I<00:03:15.750> want<00:03:15.990> to<00:03:16.820> first<00:03:17.820> is<00:03:18.030> just<00:03:19.250> okay<00:03:22.430> it<00:03:23.430> gives

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
if I want to first is just okay it gives

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.780 
if I want to first is just okay it gives
me<00:03:23.880> more<00:03:24.030> control<00:03:24.270> now<00:03:24.860> say<00:03:25.860> you<00:03:25.920> just<00:03:26.430> sample

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
me more control now say you just sample

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.180 
me more control now say you just sample
a<00:03:26.850> short<00:03:27.180> note<00:03:27.390> let<00:03:27.600> me<00:03:27.690> show<00:03:27.870> you<00:03:27.980> like<00:03:28.980> I<00:03:29.130> did

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
a short note let me show you like I did

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
a short note let me show you like I did
it<00:03:30.050> this<00:03:31.050> is<00:03:31.110> another<00:03:31.560> sample<00:03:32.220> another<00:03:32.640> sample

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:33.210 
it this is another sample another sample

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:35.540 
it this is another sample another sample
but<00:03:33.330> it's<00:03:33.480> short<00:03:34.250> okay

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:35.550 
but it's short okay

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:42.290 
but it's short okay
the<00:03:36.270> long<00:03:36.510> sample<00:03:36.960> is<00:03:37.020> here<00:03:38.240> okay<00:03:41.060> now<00:03:42.060> let's

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:42.300 
the long sample is here okay now let's

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:45.830 
the long sample is here okay now let's
see<00:03:42.480> what<00:03:42.660> happens<00:03:43.550> if<00:03:44.550> I<00:03:44.730> hit<00:03:44.880> 16<00:03:45.330> levels<00:03:45.690> for

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
see what happens if I hit 16 levels for

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:52.760 
see what happens if I hit 16 levels for
that<00:03:45.870> short<00:03:46.170> note<00:03:48.950> now<00:03:49.950> I<00:03:49.980> cannot<00:03:50.610> hold<00:03:51.000> a<00:03:51.770> note

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:52.770 
that short note now I cannot hold a note

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:54.380 
that short note now I cannot hold a note
long<00:03:53.130> you<00:03:53.430> know<00:03:53.550> I'm<00:03:53.640> saying<00:03:53.820> I<00:03:53.970> can't<00:03:54.210> sustain

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
long you know I'm saying I can't sustain

00:03:54.390 --> 00:04:01.610 
long you know I'm saying I can't sustain
it<00:03:54.750> it's<00:03:58.790> cool<00:03:59.790> but<00:04:00.240> I<00:04:00.450> like<00:04:00.510> more<00:04:01.080> controlling

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
it it's cool but I like more controlling

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.300 
it it's cool but I like more controlling
that<00:04:01.740> okay<00:04:02.130> so<00:04:02.190> going<00:04:02.610> back<00:04:03.740> once<00:04:04.740> again<00:04:04.860> use

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
that okay so going back once again use

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:08.780 
that okay so going back once again use
any<00:04:05.550> combination<00:04:05.880> you<00:04:07.340> can<00:04:08.340> always

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
any combination you can always

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.050 
any combination you can always
manipulate<00:04:09.210> the<00:04:10.050> sound<00:04:10.380> of<00:04:10.770> your<00:04:10.920> sample<00:04:11.580> by

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
manipulate the sound of your sample by

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.870 
manipulate the sound of your sample by
going<00:04:12.360> into<00:04:12.510> your<00:04:12.630> parameters<00:04:13.290> page<00:04:13.470> and<00:04:13.950> just

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
going into your parameters page and just

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.280 
going into your parameters page and just
change<00:04:15.240> you<00:04:15.810> know<00:04:15.960> the<00:04:16.710> filter<00:04:17.190> of<00:04:17.430> it<00:04:17.610> the

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:18.290 
change you know the filter of it the

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:23.690 
change you know the filter of it the
resonance<00:04:19.290> of<00:04:19.470> it<00:04:19.650> whatever<00:04:22.400> so<00:04:23.400> there<00:04:23.580> you

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
resonance of it whatever so there you

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.130 
resonance of it whatever so there you
have<00:04:23.730> it<00:04:23.910> man<00:04:24.240> here's<00:04:24.570> the<00:04:24.660> beat<00:04:24.840> and<00:04:24.990> I'm

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:25.140 
have it man here's the beat and I'm

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:26.480 
have it man here's the beat and I'm
gonna<00:04:25.230> just<00:04:25.380> go<00:04:25.530> ahead<00:04:25.590> and<00:04:25.830> play<00:04:26.010> live<00:04:26.250> like

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
gonna just go ahead and play live like
