here which is like butter and it really

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.340 
here which is like butter and it really
gives<00:01:13.390> you<00:01:13.540> that<00:01:13.750> the<00:01:14.230> darkest<00:01:14.770> graphite<00:01:16.350> on

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:19.690 
the wooden pencil for that I being able

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:25.410 
the wooden pencil for that I being able
to<00:01:19.780> find<00:01:19.990> so<00:01:20.200> far

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.000 

but<00:01:26.420> let's<00:01:26.780> go<00:01:26.930> back<00:01:26.960> to<00:01:27.140> the<00:01:27.410> subject<00:01:27.650> of<00:01:27.920> this

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:28.010 
but let's go back to the subject of this

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.270 
but let's go back to the subject of this
reveal<00:01:28.370> the<00:01:28.820> magnum<00:01:29.210> pencil<00:01:29.660> so<00:01:30.100> it<00:01:31.100> has<00:01:31.160> a

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
reveal the magnum pencil so it has a

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.160 
reveal the magnum pencil so it has a
much<00:01:31.640> wider<00:01:31.910> diameter<00:01:32.180> so<00:01:32.750> I<00:01:32.780> have<00:01:32.870> to<00:01:32.990> use<00:01:33.140> the

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
much wider diameter so I have to use the

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.190 
much wider diameter so I have to use the
big<00:01:33.470> hole<00:01:33.710> on<00:01:33.950> my<00:01:34.010> sharpener<00:01:34.640> for<00:01:34.940> it<00:01:35.030> do<00:01:35.270> it

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
big hole on my sharpener for it do it

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:44.110 
big hole on my sharpener for it do it
touched<00:01:36.470> up<00:01:40.960> like<00:01:41.960> sharp<00:01:42.229> point<00:01:42.500> and<00:01:43.120> insane

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:44.120 
touched up like sharp point and insane

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.690 
touched up like sharp point and insane
so<00:01:45.080> we<00:01:45.200> can<00:01:45.380> just<00:01:45.530> warm<00:01:45.770> up<00:01:45.920> do<00:01:46.220> a<00:01:46.250> couple<00:01:46.610> of

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
so we can just warm up do a couple of

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.550 
so we can just warm up do a couple of
doodle<00:01:47.060> shapes<00:01:49.060> so<00:01:50.060> it's<00:01:50.960> a<00:01:51.050> fairly<00:01:51.260> nice

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
doodle shapes so it's a fairly nice

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.850 
doodle shapes so it's a fairly nice
pencil<00:01:51.950> just<00:01:52.550> on<00:01:52.670> my<00:01:52.790> favorite<00:01:53.330> and<00:01:54.200> I<00:01:54.710> guess

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
pencil just on my favorite and I guess

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.170 
pencil just on my favorite and I guess
if<00:01:55.010> you're<00:01:55.130> in<00:01:55.250> the<00:01:55.310> mood<00:01:55.430> or<00:01:55.580> something<00:01:55.640> more

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
if you're in the mood or something more

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.690 
if you're in the mood or something more
substantial<00:01:56.690> and<00:01:57.080> wider<00:01:57.350> to<00:01:57.619> grip<00:01:57.860> this<00:01:58.490> might

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
substantial and wider to grip this might

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:05.400 
substantial and wider to grip this might
be<00:01:58.759> the<00:01:58.880> way<00:01:59.030> to<00:01:59.060> go<00:02:02.080> so<00:02:03.080> overall<00:02:03.740> pretty<00:02:04.280> nice

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:05.410 
be the way to go so overall pretty nice

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:07.300 
be the way to go so overall pretty nice
don't<00:02:06.410> think<00:02:06.560> I'm<00:02:06.619> gonna<00:02:06.710> be<00:02:06.770> using<00:02:06.950> it<00:02:07.190> too

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
don't think I'm gonna be using it too

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:08.919 
don't think I'm gonna be using it too
much<00:02:07.460> it's<00:02:07.670> not<00:02:07.790> that<00:02:07.940> easy<00:02:08.060> to<00:02:08.179> find<00:02:08.450> anyhow

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
much it's not that easy to find anyhow

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:13.300 
much it's not that easy to find anyhow
no<00:02:09.290> it's<00:02:09.950> more<00:02:10.130> of<00:02:10.280> a<00:02:11.500> look<00:02:12.500> what<00:02:12.680> I<00:02:12.709> got<00:02:12.770> it

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
no it's more of a look what I got it

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.460 
no it's more of a look what I got it
goes<00:02:13.430> in<00:02:13.550> the<00:02:13.640> collection<00:02:14.209> and<00:02:14.480> back<00:02:15.320> in

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
goes in the collection and back in

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.760 
goes in the collection and back in
storage<00:02:15.860> so<00:02:16.750> but<00:02:17.750> if<00:02:17.959> you<00:02:18.050> come<00:02:18.200> across<00:02:18.470> it

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:18.770 
storage so but if you come across it

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.420 
storage so but if you come across it
certainly<00:02:19.370> worth<00:02:19.580> picking<00:02:19.790> up<00:02:20.200> and<00:02:21.430> that's

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
certainly worth picking up and that's

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.400 
certainly worth picking up and that's
about<00:02:22.580> it<00:02:23.860> nothing<00:02:24.860> spar<00:02:25.310> here<00:02:25.690> so<00:02:26.690> again

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
about it nothing spar here so again

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:32.490 
about it nothing spar here so again
