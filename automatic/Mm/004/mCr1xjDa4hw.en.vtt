I<00:02:12.880> can't<00:02:13.720> help<00:02:13.900> but<00:02:14.050> think<00:02:14.440> of<00:02:14.560> I<00:02:15.280> think<00:02:15.790> it<00:02:15.910> was

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
I can't help but think of I think it was

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.360 
I can't help but think of I think it was
the<00:02:16.420> last<00:02:16.630> home<00:02:17.110> game<00:02:17.310> that<00:02:18.310> we<00:02:18.460> had<00:02:18.640> here<00:02:18.990> and

the last home game that we had here and

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.050 
the last home game that we had here and
we<00:02:21.370> certainly<00:02:22.020> didn't<00:02:23.020> have<00:02:23.170> the<00:02:23.320> record<00:02:23.710> that

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
we certainly didn't have the record that

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.560 
we certainly didn't have the record that
justified<00:02:25.060> it<00:02:25.270> but<00:02:26.110> our<00:02:26.290> fans<00:02:27.390> cheered<00:02:28.390> our

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
justified it but our fans cheered our

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.780 
justified it but our fans cheered our
