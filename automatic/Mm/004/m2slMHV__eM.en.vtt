00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:06.359
 part-time encore 

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:09.059
 jo people from banjotown and welcome to the 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.440
 first introduction of banjotown cologne 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.849
 2014 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.830
 as you can see you behind me 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:17.369
 bars in my small but nice room 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.180
 and today tuesday we go with wit and 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.579
 jordi 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.810
 on the way to choice or well on the way to 

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:23.759
 choice is not that easy 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.140
 because we first go to eindhoven and 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:27.090
 then we will sleep there and then 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.710
 we go to choice it 's all 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.809
 just more complicated but you go 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.890
 we all see just like last year we go 

00:00:30.809 --> 00:00:33.360

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.060

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:43.740
 I think there are very short strokes of your 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.600

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.370
