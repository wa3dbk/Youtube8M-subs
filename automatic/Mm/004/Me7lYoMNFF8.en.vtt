things<00:00:49.350> I<00:00:49.649> begin<00:00:50.100> to<00:00:50.219> teach<00:00:50.399> them<00:00:50.670> because

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
things I begin to teach them because

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.600 
things I begin to teach them because
what<00:00:51.480> tends<00:00:51.750> to<00:00:51.840> happen<00:00:51.930> is<00:00:52.469> when<00:00:53.280> they<00:00:53.399> come

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
what tends to happen is when they come

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.229 
what tends to happen is when they come
to<00:00:53.789> me<00:00:53.910> they<00:00:54.800> want<00:00:55.800> that<00:00:56.520> greater<00:00:56.789> fitness

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
to me they want that greater fitness

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.479 
to me they want that greater fitness
they<00:00:57.390> want<00:00:57.600> that<00:00:57.780> greater<00:00:58.109> endurance<00:00:58.739> they

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
they want that greater endurance they

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.090 
they want that greater endurance they
want<00:00:59.670> that<00:00:59.820> greater<00:01:00.059> strength<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:01.100> they

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
want that greater strength and they

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.470 
want that greater strength and they
think<00:01:02.280> they've<00:01:02.370> got<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:02.609> strengthen<00:01:03.359> up<00:01:03.449> the

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
think they've got to strengthen up the

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.290 
there's one key component missing which

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.200 
there's one key component missing which
will<00:01:10.290> only<00:01:10.470> enhance<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.729> strength<00:01:12.000> of<00:01:12.150> the

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210

you've got strong hips your power output

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.410 
you've got strong hips your power output
will<00:01:35.340> increase<00:01:35.369> because<00:01:36.090> it<00:01:36.210> will<00:01:36.329> only

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
will increase because it will only

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.719 
will increase because it will only

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
increasingly your hip strength you

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.819 
increasingly your hip strength you
become<00:01:43.829> a<00:01:43.860> lot<00:01:44.040> more<00:01:44.250> stable<00:01:44.640> in<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:44.970> saddle

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:45.829 
become a lot more stable in the saddle

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:48.679 
become a lot more stable in the saddle
and<00:01:46.829> your<00:01:47.100> whole<00:01:47.310> cycling<00:01:47.880> ability<00:01:48.210> goes<00:01:48.360> up<00:01:48.570> I
