00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:06.210
 Hello and welcome back to the millions around today I want you one 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:07.710
 Man pointing or 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.150
 generally come to cinema Mon nom in a video do not bring up in the text 

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:14.519
 the one at the designer 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.939
 Detects if it is a few months or a fake website 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:23.159
 yes, and that in itself the simplest variant is one 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:27.519
 but since the packaging has to look at here 

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:29.800
 Of course, this is a prerequisite 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.940
 the beer still has the packaging 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.710
 where the first device was so to speak as crew were exchanged in between 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.380
 For example, we have the SPD 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:44.380
 It may of course be that from then on a law was banned 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.070
 then if people red never been a skilled percent of course 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:51.840
 it is best to look at the packaging 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.840
 and yes on the packaging of the that was yes 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.000
 then you see once 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
 at the specifications 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:02.929
 once 

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:05.170
 at this point display 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.810
 that in my new competent the tenants commune Kapsch Chelsea 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.160
 Touchscreen acts 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:14.070
 So what is here with this device is an AMOLED display 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.420
 you can also recognize them 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.990
 whether it was a renewed bean Bean Packing set also started 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.920
 already so should 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.200
 that is no longer about all TSG pressure is still coming percent would 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.600
 probably been this transitional phase 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.030
 and then 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.030
 is the easiest because actually 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:36.740
 the device 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.770
 unstoppable 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.570
 and to be able to kick that catamaran so well 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.570
 Just do that 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:47.600
 you can also Mulan 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:48.790
 very very far 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:50.600
 still recognize everything 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.620
 really everything 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:56.360
 and 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.360
 The Alliance does not quite live up to its life 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:04.230
 Personally, I must have seen it now 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.070
 on some devices 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.070
 They usually have the whole discussion around them 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:16.760
 Once again, there is a very special difference to other municipalities so far 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.799
 we did not care that everyone decided for themselves 

00:02:21.249 --> 00:02:25.159
 the whole viewpoint it was my opportunity old fair cd the screw 

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:28.899
 even at this point, I have nothing left to see anymore 

00:02:28.899 --> 00:02:29.769
 see 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:32.769
 But the difference is not that big either 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:34.419
 not surprising 

00:02:34.419 --> 00:02:38.439
 and what options still has is with programs such as here 

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:41.159
 take Screen KÃ¶ster 

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:42.909
 Once upon a time 

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:45.529
 I look at the display like this 

00:02:45.529 --> 00:02:48.529
 and percent 

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:50.869
 in white-red 

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:52.919
 Green amount 

00:02:52.919 --> 00:02:56.939
 you can hardly see a difference but the underlined underscore it 

00:02:56.939 --> 00:02:58.979
 amoled display will 

00:02:58.979 --> 00:03:02.389
 while the complete austerity program is not lit. 

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:05.629
 and you can see that here too 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:08.629
 embarrassing will turn off the light again 

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:12.359
 Actions occupied 

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:17.629
 how do you see this then the device is switched on 

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:19.399
 Man at the keys she 

00:03:19.399 --> 00:03:23.489
 and it is still completely black the screen the more important point for 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:24.449
 Point 

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:28.209
 You can also save yourself changing views and a box of beer 

00:03:28.749 --> 00:03:33.010
 that together the device is still on Istanbul as said 

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:34.549
 but that is children 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:35.739
 not lit. 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:38.739
 black I'm not lit 

00:03:40.969 --> 00:03:44.159
 Black sports so that is definitely 

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:49.259
 that is to say that these plans on 01 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:51.699
 easy 

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:54.699
 how are single yes 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:58.209
 we came across this with black 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:01.309
 and the influx of consumption, of course, also lower 

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:04.219
 and 4 

00:04:04.219 --> 00:04:08.059
 So these three realities are there to recognize if it is a community 

00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:11.059
 or around 

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:14.579
 it must now act and 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:19.430
 Ultimately, everyone must decide for themselves to serve the financial court 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.210
 should have been the best too 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.550
 At the turn of the century one should not be too serious about the subject 

00:04:26.779 --> 00:04:28.360
 and 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.379
 I hope you have the little Lyon 

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:33.039
 and 

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:34.049
 Until next time
