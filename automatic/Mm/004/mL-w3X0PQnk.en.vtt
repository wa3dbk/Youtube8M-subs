enabling all of your processing cores
will<00:00:40.559> help<00:00:40.860> you<00:00:41.510> why<00:00:42.510> is<00:00:42.570> it<00:00:42.809> part<00:00:43.110> you<00:00:43.500> may<00:00:43.649> ask

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
will help you why is it part you may ask

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.279 
will help you why is it part you may ask
well<00:00:44.430> it's<00:00:44.700> part<00:00:45.000> because<00:00:45.450> your<00:00:45.870> computer

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
well it's part because your computer

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.830 
well it's part because your computer
doesn't<00:00:46.530> really<00:00:46.800> need<00:00:47.039> it<00:00:47.190> enable<00:00:47.879> until<00:00:48.510> you

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
doesn't really need it enable until you

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.150 
doesn't really need it enable until you
run<00:00:49.649> a<00:00:49.680> program<00:00:49.980> or<00:00:50.760> programs<00:00:51.539> that<00:00:52.020> need<00:00:52.770> more

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
run a program or programs that need more

run a program or programs that need more
of<00:00:53.640> a<00:00:53.789> boost<00:00:54.170> but<00:00:55.170> obviously<00:00:56.100> you<00:00:56.399> want<00:00:56.579> to

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
of a boost but obviously you want to

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.580 
of a boost but obviously you want to
name<00:00:56.820> all<00:00:57.059> of<00:00:57.090> them<00:00:57.360> because<00:00:57.750> you'll<00:00:58.500> just

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
name all of them because you'll just

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.020 
name all of them because you'll just
make<00:00:58.920> a<00:00:58.949> PC<00:00:59.430> way<00:00:59.609> faster<00:01:00.469> now<00:01:01.469> your<00:01:02.250> PC<00:01:02.640> varies

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
make a PC way faster now your PC varies

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.020 
make a PC way faster now your PC varies

for<00:01:16.020> 3<00:01:16.350> in<00:01:16.590> my<00:01:16.790> case<00:01:17.790> I<00:01:18.000> have<00:01:18.180> a<00:01:18.390> core<00:01:18.659> processor

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
for 3 in my case I have a core processor

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.830 
for 3 in my case I have a core processor
and<00:01:19.700> it

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
and it

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.639 
and it
it's<00:01:20.960> only<00:01:21.109> running<00:01:21.530> a<00:01:21.679> quad<00:01:21.950> or<00:01:22.250> four<00:01:22.700> CPUs

it's only running a quad or four CPUs

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:26.050 
it's only running a quad or four CPUs
but<00:01:24.649> now<00:01:24.859> I<00:01:24.890> will<00:01:25.219> show<00:01:25.369> you<00:01:25.429> how<00:01:25.640> to<00:01:25.700> enable

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:37.520 
what's that all you do is close it and

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.890 
what's that all you do is close it and
reboot<00:02:38.270> your<00:02:38.330> PC<00:02:39.130> now<00:02:40.510> check<00:02:41.510> if<00:02:41.720> your

reboot your PC now check if your

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
performance sorry and resource monitor

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:00.910 
performance sorry and resource monitor
now<00:02:56.080> here<00:02:57.080> it<00:02:57.410> will<00:02:57.590> show<00:02:57.860> the<00:02:58.340> CPU<00:02:58.910> I<00:02:59.920> have

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
now here it will show the CPU I have

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.830 
now here it will show the CPU I have
eight<00:03:01.220> cores<00:03:01.970> so<00:03:02.390> it<00:03:02.570> shows<00:03:02.810> from<00:03:03.260> zero<00:03:04.840> seven

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
eight cores so it shows from zero seven

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.470 
eight cores so it shows from zero seven
but<00:03:06.080> that's<00:03:06.290> eight<00:03:06.590> and<00:03:07.040> as<00:03:07.970> you<00:03:08.150> can<00:03:08.300> see

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
but that's eight and as you can see

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.960 
but that's eight and as you can see
they're<00:03:08.720> all<00:03:08.930> enabled<00:03:09.530> so<00:03:09.920> my<00:03:10.430> computer<00:03:10.910> is

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
they're all enabled so my computer is

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.910 
they're all enabled so my computer is
using<00:03:11.330> is<00:03:11.980> spreading<00:03:12.980> out<00:03:14.740> whatever's<00:03:15.740> needed

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
using is spreading out whatever's needed

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.540 
using is spreading out whatever's needed
throughout<00:03:16.910> this<00:03:17.120> course<00:03:17.450> so<00:03:18.260> my<00:03:18.980> computer

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:19.550 
throughout this course so my computer

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:22.630 
throughout this course so my computer
will<00:03:20.030> run<00:03:20.240> more<00:03:20.750> efficiently<00:03:21.080> a<00:03:21.650> bit<00:03:22.430> more

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 
will run more efficiently a bit more

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.200 
will run more efficiently a bit more
smoothly

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:24.210 
smoothly

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:26.810 
smoothly
um<00:03:24.540> if<00:03:25.140> it's<00:03:25.380> not<00:03:25.620> enabled<00:03:25.860> it<00:03:26.190> would<00:03:26.310> say<00:03:26.490> part

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
um if it's not enabled it would say part

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:30.740 
um if it's not enabled it would say part
now<00:03:28.250> downfall<00:03:29.250> to<00:03:29.460> enabling<00:03:30.030> all<00:03:30.270> of<00:03:30.330> your

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
now downfall to enabling all of your

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:36.820 
now downfall to enabling all of your
course<00:03:30.960> it<00:03:31.230> is<00:03:31.680> a<00:03:32.010> very<00:03:32.660> waste<00:03:33.660> of<00:03:34.010> power<00:03:35.010> for

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:36.830 
course it is a very waste of power for

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:41.300 
course it is a very waste of power for
laptops<00:03:37.830> so<00:03:38.480> it's<00:03:39.480> kind<00:03:40.020> of<00:03:40.050> better<00:03:40.230> to<00:03:41.040> like

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
laptops so it's kind of better to like

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.910 
laptops so it's kind of better to like
leave<00:03:41.640> your<00:03:41.850> laptop<00:03:42.570> plugged<00:03:42.990> in<00:03:44.120> so<00:03:45.120> yeah

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
leave your laptop plugged in so yeah

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.840 
leave your laptop plugged in so yeah
it's<00:03:46.920> very<00:03:47.220> good<00:03:47.430> to<00:03:48.360> get<00:03:48.480> me<00:03:48.660> to<00:03:48.810> do<00:03:49.850> faster

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
it's very good to get me to do faster

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:54.410 
it's very good to get me to do faster
