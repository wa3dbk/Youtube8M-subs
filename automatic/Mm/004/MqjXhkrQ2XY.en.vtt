by the picture once you clip this onto
the<00:01:12.000> bottle<00:01:12.360> you<00:01:12.479> can<00:01:12.630> actually<00:01:12.780> put<00:01:13.110> it<00:01:13.229> onto

your belt loop or if you guys see here

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.920 
your belt loop or if you guys see here
in<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.500> back<00:01:16.650> you<00:01:16.890> can<00:01:16.920> attach<00:01:17.310> it<00:01:17.460> to<00:01:17.490> a<00:01:17.610> pack

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 
in the back you can attach it to a pack

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.230 
in the back you can attach it to a pack
the<00:01:18.930> clip<00:01:19.170> goes<00:01:19.409> in<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.950> bottle<00:01:20.640> then<00:01:21.090> the

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
the clip goes in the bottle then the

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.789 
the clip goes in the bottle then the
neck<00:01:21.509> of<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.720> bottle<00:01:21.869> right<00:01:22.170> here<00:01:22.200> so<00:01:22.710> it

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
neck of the bottle right here so it

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.539 
neck of the bottle right here so it
doesn't<00:01:23.070> obstruct<00:01:23.280> taking<00:01:24.210> off<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.840> cap<00:01:25.200> and

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:25.549 
doesn't obstruct taking off the cap and

drinking from it and things like that

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.560 
drinking from it and things like that
and<00:01:27.750> then<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.740> SBA<00:01:29.340> is<00:01:29.490> actually<00:01:29.970> designed<00:01:30.240> so

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
and then the SBA is actually designed so

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.960 
and then the SBA is actually designed so
you<00:01:30.600> can<00:01:30.900> clip<00:01:31.710> it<00:01:31.740> for<00:01:32.100> storage<00:01:32.369> so<00:01:32.549> in<00:01:32.880> other

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
you can clip it for storage so in other

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.270 
you can clip it for storage so in other
words<00:01:33.210> once<00:01:33.509> you're<00:01:33.659> done<00:01:33.890> instead<00:01:34.890> of<00:01:35.009> you

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
words once you're done instead of you

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
something like that you can actually

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.480 
something like that you can actually
clip<00:01:39.570> this<00:01:39.780> you<00:01:40.680> know<00:01:40.770> onto<00:01:41.040> the<00:01:41.130> side<00:01:41.310> of<00:01:41.340> the

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
clip this you know onto the side of the

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.160 
clip this you know onto the side of the
bag<00:01:41.640> or<00:01:41.909> whatnot<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:42.450> then<00:01:42.600> you<00:01:42.869> know<00:01:42.990> go

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
bag or whatnot and then you know go

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.870 
bag or whatnot and then you know go
ahead<00:01:43.259> and<00:01:43.470> use<00:01:43.590> it<00:01:43.710> again<00:01:43.950> so<00:01:44.640> I'll<00:01:44.729> go<00:01:44.850> ahead

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
ahead and use it again so I'll go ahead

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.149 
ahead and use it again so I'll go ahead
and<00:01:45.119> take<00:01:45.960> it<00:01:46.020> out<00:01:46.229> of<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.380> packaging<00:01:46.829> here

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
and take it out of the packaging here

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.560 
and take it out of the packaging here
and<00:01:47.340> we'll<00:01:47.670> test<00:01:47.909> it<00:01:48.000> on<00:01:48.119> this<00:01:48.329> bottle<00:01:50.570> just

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
and we'll test it on this bottle just

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:58.010 
and we'll test it on this bottle just
click<00:01:51.869> this<00:01:52.049> right<00:01:52.619> here<00:01:52.979> and<00:01:54.619> here<00:01:57.020> obviously

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
click this right here and here obviously

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.090 
click this right here and here obviously
I<00:01:58.799> would<00:01:59.430> not<00:01:59.640> be<00:01:59.880> using<00:02:00.689> this<00:02:00.869> with<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.590> SP

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
I would not be using this with the SP

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.920 
I would not be using this with the SP
nor<00:02:02.280> attached<00:02:02.549> to<00:02:02.820> it<00:02:02.969> it<00:02:03.360> just<00:02:03.420> kind<00:02:03.719> of<00:02:03.810> gets

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
nor attached to it it just kind of gets

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.959 
nor attached to it it just kind of gets
in<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.200> way<00:02:04.320> of<00:02:04.560> you<00:02:05.219> know<00:02:05.250> when<00:02:05.460> I<00:02:05.490> were<00:02:05.729> to

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
in the way of you know when I were to

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.150 
in the way of you know when I were to
slide<00:02:06.329> it<00:02:06.450> onto<00:02:06.600> my<00:02:06.780> belt<00:02:07.020> loop<00:02:07.110> or<00:02:07.500> to<00:02:07.829> a<00:02:07.860> pack

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
slide it onto my belt loop or to a pack

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.969 
slide it onto my belt loop or to a pack
or<00:02:08.190> something<00:02:08.610> like<00:02:08.670> that<00:02:08.729> so<00:02:09.800> there<00:02:10.800> it<00:02:10.890> is

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
or something like that so there it is

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.070 
or something like that so there it is
pretty<00:02:11.580> easy

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
pretty easy

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.070 
pretty easy
move<00:02:12.230> so<00:02:12.770> here<00:02:13.280> it<00:02:13.370> is<00:02:13.430> it's<00:02:14.000> obviously<00:02:14.360> under

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
move so here it is it's obviously under

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.440 
move so here it is it's obviously under
a<00:02:15.140> little<00:02:15.380> bit<00:02:15.470> of<00:02:15.560> tension<00:02:15.770> but<00:02:16.220> because<00:02:16.880> it

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
a little bit of tension but because it

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.730 
a little bit of tension but because it
is<00:02:17.510> a<00:02:17.660> you<00:02:18.410> know<00:02:18.530> fairly<00:02:20.410> it's<00:02:21.410> not<00:02:21.560> very

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740 
is a you know fairly it's not very

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.410 
is a you know fairly it's not very
Bridget<00:02:22.280> you<00:02:22.490> can<00:02:22.640> go<00:02:22.760> ahead<00:02:22.850> and<00:02:23.000> tighten<00:02:23.120> it

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
Bridget you can go ahead and tighten it

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:24.790 
Bridget you can go ahead and tighten it
if<00:02:23.630> they<00:02:23.780> were<00:02:23.960> to<00:02:24.110> loosen<00:02:24.500> up<00:02:24.560> or<00:02:24.740> anything

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
if they were to loosen up or anything

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.790 
if they were to loosen up or anything
like<00:02:25.040> that<00:02:25.130> and<00:02:25.720> there<00:02:26.720> it<00:02:26.840> is<00:02:26.930> just<00:02:27.410> snaps<00:02:27.620> on

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
like that and there it is just snaps on

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.260 
like that and there it is just snaps on
the<00:02:27.830> bottle<00:02:28.190> right<00:02:28.340> there<00:02:28.550> you<00:02:28.910> do<00:02:29.060> have<00:02:29.210> the

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
the bottle right there you do have the

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.140 
the bottle right there you do have the
nite<00:02:29.780> ize<00:02:29.990> logo<00:02:30.500> raking<00:02:30.830> on<00:02:30.920> the<00:02:31.040> side<00:02:31.250> and<00:02:31.520> you

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
nite ize logo raking on the side and you

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.810 
nite ize logo raking on the side and you
know<00:02:32.240> arm<00:02:32.510> for<00:02:33.380> what<00:02:33.560> it<00:02:33.650> is<00:02:33.800> it<00:02:34.130> definitely

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
know arm for what it is it definitely

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.510 
know arm for what it is it definitely
looks<00:02:35.120> like<00:02:35.210> it<00:02:35.420> will<00:02:35.740> you<00:02:36.740> know<00:02:37.010> sort<00:02:37.340> of<00:02:37.370> its

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:37.520 
looks like it will you know sort of its

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.460 
looks like it will you know sort of its
purpose<00:02:37.760> like<00:02:38.390> I<00:02:38.480> mentioned<00:02:38.540> before<00:02:38.870> you're

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
purpose like I mentioned before you're

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.770 
purpose like I mentioned before you're
still<00:02:39.920> able<00:02:40.040> to<00:02:40.310> go<00:02:41.030> ahead<00:02:41.150> and<00:02:41.390> remove<00:02:41.630> the

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
still able to go ahead and remove the

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.500 
still able to go ahead and remove the
cap<00:02:42.020> and<00:02:42.320> you<00:02:42.770> know<00:02:43.250> use<00:02:43.580> it<00:02:43.790> it's<00:02:44.090> not<00:02:44.390> going

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
cap and you know use it it's not going

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:45.610 
cap and you know use it it's not going
to<00:02:44.600> get<00:02:44.720> in<00:02:44.810> the<00:02:44.870> way<00:02:45.020> or<00:02:45.200> anything<00:02:45.380> like<00:02:45.500> that

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
to get in the way or anything like that

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.800 
to get in the way or anything like that
then<00:02:46.460> once<00:02:46.700> you're<00:02:46.850> done<00:02:46.970> only<00:02:47.150> you<00:02:47.360> do<00:02:47.630> is

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
then once you're done only you do is

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.900 
then once you're done only you do is
just<00:02:48.200> pull<00:02:48.890> it<00:02:49.010> right<00:02:49.160> off<00:02:49.220> the<00:02:49.430> bottle<00:02:49.760> and

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
just pull it right off the bottle and

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.420 
just pull it right off the bottle and
you<00:02:50.780> know<00:02:50.900> it's<00:02:51.110> good<00:02:51.260> to<00:02:51.290> go<00:02:51.530> to<00:02:51.890> attach<00:02:52.220> to

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
you know it's good to go to attach to

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.449 
you know it's good to go to attach to
another<00:02:52.670> bottle<00:02:53.030> so<00:02:53.240> it<00:02:54.200> does<00:02:55.070> have<00:02:55.100> a<00:02:55.310> little

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
another bottle so it does have a little

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:57.010 
another bottle so it does have a little
bit<00:02:55.580> of<00:02:55.670> flex<00:02:55.970> so<00:02:56.270> if<00:02:56.390> you<00:02:56.480> get<00:02:56.600> a<00:02:56.660> bottle<00:02:56.840> with

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.020 
bit of flex so if you get a bottle with

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:58.510 
bit of flex so if you get a bottle with
a<00:02:57.110> little<00:02:57.470> bit<00:02:57.590> wider<00:02:57.800> neck<00:02:58.130> you<00:02:58.340> would

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:58.520 
a little bit wider neck you would

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.210 
a little bit wider neck you would
probably<00:02:58.940> be<00:02:59.030> able<00:02:59.300> to<00:02:59.450> put<00:02:59.690> it<00:02:59.720> on<00:02:59.930> there<00:03:00.220> but

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
probably be able to put it on there but

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:02.650 
probably be able to put it on there but
again<00:03:01.520> it's<00:03:01.700> probably<00:03:02.000> designed<00:03:02.300> more<00:03:02.600> for

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
again it's probably designed more for

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.680 
again it's probably designed more for
this<00:03:03.500> size<00:03:03.800> some<00:03:04.280> type<00:03:04.700> of<00:03:04.730> bottle<00:03:05.000> this<00:03:05.480> is

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
this size some type of bottle this is

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.820 
this size some type of bottle this is
the<00:03:05.840> 16.9<00:03:06.740> fluid<00:03:07.610> ounces<00:03:08.090> so<00:03:08.720> again<00:03:09.020> um<00:03:09.260> this

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
the 16.9 fluid ounces so again um this

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:11.290 
the 16.9 fluid ounces so again um this
is<00:03:10.040> not<00:03:10.250> definitely<00:03:10.670> something<00:03:11.030> that<00:03:11.060> you

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:11.300 
is not definitely something that you

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:14.890 
is not definitely something that you
need<00:03:12.200> right<00:03:12.709> off<00:03:12.830> the<00:03:12.860> bat<00:03:13.190> or<00:03:13.750> you<00:03:14.750> know<00:03:14.870> you

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
need right off the bat or you know you

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.500 
need right off the bat or you know you
should<00:03:15.170> go<00:03:15.320> out<00:03:15.440> and<00:03:15.650> purchase<00:03:16.190> unless<00:03:17.000> again

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
should go out and purchase unless again

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.420 
should go out and purchase unless again
like<00:03:17.750> if<00:03:17.989> you're<00:03:18.170> like<00:03:18.200> myself<00:03:18.560> you<00:03:18.980> do<00:03:19.130> find

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
like if you're like myself you do find

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.790 
like if you're like myself you do find
yourself<00:03:19.519> carrying<00:03:20.510> these<00:03:20.660> on<00:03:20.930> a<00:03:20.959> daily<00:03:21.200> basis

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:21.800 
yourself carrying these on a daily basis

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:25.690 
yourself carrying these on a daily basis
basis<00:03:22.459> because<00:03:23.170> they<00:03:24.170> are<00:03:24.350> very<00:03:24.700> convenience

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
basis because they are very convenience

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.120 
basis because they are very convenience
they're<00:03:26.060> pretty<00:03:26.390> cheap<00:03:26.530> you<00:03:27.530> know<00:03:27.560> just<00:03:27.920> the
