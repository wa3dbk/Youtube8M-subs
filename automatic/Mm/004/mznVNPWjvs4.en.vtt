00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:15.480
 grunde indeed the trigger of a board is 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:17.010
 chubby everything in the heart desires 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.900
 and what makes me smile 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.980
 because the walls would play and have again 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:27.380

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:31.380

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:49.230
 success simply already there to 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:53.160
 Perfect the guy knows except that 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:55.280
 apparently just from the beginning 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.809
 to sneak spawn 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.800
 the opponents do not want the delict it 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.420

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.420
 it moves engineering office is gone so bad 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:07.290
 So we have our egos par excellence 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:21.620
 because I think I just hear it 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:27.020

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:32.540
 Meat also accurate from precise to 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:38.960
 five-hour weapons big cs go or den 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:41.770
 brother in hall 14 shot eight times 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.900

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.530
 yes to meet the opponents 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.400
 and if it worked at 40 then 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:54.880
 first reload 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:54.880
 You do not want to stay amused 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:18.120
