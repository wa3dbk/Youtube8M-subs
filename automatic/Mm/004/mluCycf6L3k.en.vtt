00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.700

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:24.600

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.519
 they bought that size say they 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.730
 right in my language you fit 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.200
 I recently bought a maxi dress 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.890
 this such a dress that all the way to the 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.590
 land comes 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.739
 and if you are pregnant it is nice to have 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:44.010
 of your waist packs with a 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:47.550
 strap and that's why I got these three 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:51.629
 colors bought a coral red 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:54.870
 mint green and a beige I already have this 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.940
 multiple om campus therefore you see it loose 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:03.390
 do not read 20 but immediately fixed quickly 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:05.850
 touch then but on vacation I find this 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.330
 sweets up to that and another bowl 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:12.350
 soup content go around when on the move 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.350
 but are those open taps 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.880
 your amount still had a bag of these and 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.950
 I found a unfortunately not so bad 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.340
 I feel pretty much a chemical 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:27.780
 dealing its price 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:29.700
 long dead of chupa chups but lolly 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.469
 and I am super excited about it 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.200
 where you want other candy Sundays 

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:37.200
 this person this layer on the bottom 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:42.689
 also went nice and nice but that 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:44.789
 from the fog then I love it 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.009
 I use a lot of pain and I get hit 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:48.600
 she also lost very quickly 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.329
 this is always nice 100 extra plates 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.280
 have three blue in one here 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:58.590
 black and red pen 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:02:00.899
 that's all the handy I have a vacation 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.689
 had had my hair on so many times 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:05.459
 or fixed as I have now and then it is 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.679
 nice to have some pins around it 

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:09.599
 to be fixed at the back or by his hand 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:12.170
 a shot loosely pits it 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:14.489
 and I saw these nice pins in three 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:17.069
 brown tones with you shows how low brown 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:18.780
 behind that sat January how 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:23.700
 cheap they searched I take them with me 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:25.739
 lots of nice price either 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:29.040
 decay from the package is namely a 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:30.510
 folding sunglasses looked really great 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.650
 nice i was really excited about it 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:37.859
 I think he was getting a euro the 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:40.650
 there so in May 21 unfortunately after a few times 

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:43.319
 in the like doing is broken here anyway 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.959
 because he was on case so the quality 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:47.700
 is not super but he was nice 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:50.609
 so if you are looking for sunglasses for one 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:53.750
 festival dealer wants to spend a day on 

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:53.750
 then this is recommended 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.069
 then I also get out of the package 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:02.969
 bought house for skin gloves 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:05.469
 pink latex just for normal things 

00:03:02.969 --> 00:03:07.209
 I find that handy for welding 

00:03:05.469 --> 00:03:12.249
 or if I clean the bathroom that 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:15.450
 kind of stuff I already used then 

00:03:12.249 --> 00:03:15.450
 use I'm very curious 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.980
 this doll moisturizing 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:23.950
 mask wipes and that is out of one 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.120
 face mask but the mask is yes 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.120
 it's just a kind 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.200
 paper soaked in 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.879
 care ingredients 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.489
 what you can put on your face a 

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:36.819
 push on a little and then after a few 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:38.829
 minutes, and then you have to 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:39.939
 so not this is not very full face 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:41.980
 with 

00:03:39.939 --> 00:03:43.239
 Masks are what you are looking at 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.949
 must wash 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:47.409
 it is quite an easy way 

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:49.329
 quick to do masks I have them 

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:52.090
 not used yet but I certainly will 

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:54.989
 do it soon and see if i can 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:59.730
 you can let us know if this is the case 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:59.730
 these are actually the ones viewed 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:07.180
 there are suitable for all skin types 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:08.860
 he had different variants but me 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.750
 I am now these are the caretakers 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:14.800
 according to buddy also two others 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:16.479

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.970

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:20.859
 Here it falls care called him one 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:23.620
 The house now is better but I had a few 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:25.750

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.639

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:33.750
 so use this because it is caring 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:33.750
 I wish I could do this 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:41.830
 then for that cleaning wipes 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:44.470
