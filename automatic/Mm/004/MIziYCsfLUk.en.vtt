break from the conventions of past games
in<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.280> Zelda<00:00:44.610> series<00:00:44.640> where<00:00:45.420> you<00:00:45.539> had<00:00:45.719> to

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
can be quite peaceful however it is a

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.830 
can be quite peaceful however it is a
Zelda<00:01:04.920> game<00:01:04.949> after<00:01:05.460> all<00:01:05.640> so<00:01:05.909> strong<00:01:06.420> enemies

will<00:01:07.080> certainly<00:01:07.470> appear<00:01:07.979> even<00:01:08.520> in<00:01:08.610> this

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
will certainly appear even in this

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.880 
will certainly appear even in this
setting<00:01:09.030> powerful<00:01:09.930> enemies<00:01:10.320> appearing<00:01:10.799> in

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
such a peaceful world is one of the

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.780 
such a peaceful world is one of the
defining<00:01:13.020> features<00:01:13.650> of<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.950> Zelda<00:01:14.250> series<00:01:14.280> I

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
defining features of the Zelda series I

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.170 
defining features of the Zelda series I
think<00:01:15.479> that<00:01:15.780> one<00:01:16.530> convention<00:01:17.220> we<00:01:17.700> can<00:01:17.909> keep

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
think that one convention we can keep

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.960 
think that one convention we can keep
right
