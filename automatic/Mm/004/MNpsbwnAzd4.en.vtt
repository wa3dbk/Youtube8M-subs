00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
keep in mind that for the follower this

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.590 
keep in mind that for the follower this
is<00:00:34.590> a<00:00:35.600> balancing<00:00:36.600> act<00:00:36.750> in<00:00:36.990> three-inch<00:00:37.260> heels

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:38.600 
is a balancing act in three-inch heels

today's<00:00:39.600> 2<00:00:39.810> minute<00:00:39.840> tango<00:00:40.290> topic<00:00:40.680> is<00:00:41.100> about

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
today's 2 minute tango topic is about

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.550 
today's 2 minute tango topic is about
four<00:00:42.360> parts<00:00:42.630> of<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.750> follower<00:00:42.960> step<00:00:43.290> and

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:43.560 
four parts of the follower step and

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.940 
four parts of the follower step and
that's<00:00:44.370> pads<00:00:44.780> pendulum<00:00:45.780> purpose<00:00:46.470> and<00:00:46.680> plane

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
that's pads pendulum purpose and plane

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.280 
that's pads pendulum purpose and plane
I'll<00:00:47.250> explain<00:00:47.550> what<00:00:47.730> that<00:00:47.760> means<00:00:48.060> pad<00:00:48.960> this

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:49.290 
I'll explain what that means pad this

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:51.050 
I'll explain what that means pad this

us to plane plane is about keeping a

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.499 
us to plane plane is about keeping a
level<00:01:34.109> walking<00:01:34.770> plane<00:01:35.039> IE<00:01:35.340> we<00:01:35.939> don't<00:01:36.119> bounce

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
level walking plane IE we don't bounce

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.510 
level walking plane IE we don't bounce
when<00:01:36.899> we<00:01:37.049> walk<00:01:37.289> as<00:01:37.530> you're<00:01:37.920> taking<00:01:38.249> a<00:01:38.280> step

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
when we walk as you're taking a step

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.700 
when we walk as you're taking a step
forward<00:01:38.819> side<00:01:39.329> or<00:01:39.509> back<00:01:39.659> we<00:01:40.200> want<00:01:40.319> to<00:01:40.469> keep<00:01:40.560> a

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
forward side or back we want to keep a

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.739 
forward side or back we want to keep a
level<00:01:40.920> walking<00:01:41.429> plane<00:01:41.670> things<00:01:42.329> to<00:01:42.509> keep<00:01:42.630> in

00:01:42.739 --> 00:01:42.749 
level walking plane things to keep in

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:45.529 
level walking plane things to keep in
mind<00:01:42.859> bent<00:01:43.859> knees<00:01:44.100> at<00:01:44.340> these<00:01:44.490> at<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.210> end<00:01:45.389> of

00:01:45.529 --> 00:01:45.539 
mind bent knees at these at the end of

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:48.319 
mind bent knees at these at the end of
your<00:01:45.630> extensions<00:01:46.200> not<00:01:46.619> so<00:01:46.829> much<00:01:46.979> we<00:01:47.939> walk<00:01:48.149> on

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
your extensions not so much we walk on

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.330 
your extensions not so much we walk on
two<00:01:48.569> tracks<00:01:48.840> as<00:01:49.139> human<00:01:49.380> beings<00:01:49.409> not<00:01:49.920> just<00:01:50.130> one

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
two tracks as human beings not just one

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.889 
two tracks as human beings not just one
and<00:01:50.609> lastly<00:01:51.389> again<00:01:52.100> plane<00:01:53.100> is<00:01:53.429> about<00:01:53.939> a<00:01:54.240> level

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
and lastly again plane is about a level

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.020 
and lastly again plane is about a level
walking<00:01:55.259> plane<00:01:55.469> or<00:01:55.740> we<00:01:56.249> don't<00:01:56.369> bounce<00:01:56.609> when<00:01:56.880> we

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
walking plane or we don't bounce when we

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:57.470 
walking plane or we don't bounce when we
walk

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:57.480 
walk

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.540 
walk
that's<00:01:57.990> a<00:01:58.110> lot<00:01:58.260> to<00:01:58.440> do<00:01:58.530> in<00:01:58.650> two<00:01:58.770> minutes<00:01:59.070> trust

00:01:59.540 --> 00:01:59.550 
that's a lot to do in two minutes trust

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.420 
that's a lot to do in two minutes trust
me<00:01:59.760> it's<00:02:00.330> a<00:02:00.390> lot<00:02:00.570> of<00:02:00.720> technique<00:02:01.110> to<00:02:01.260> involve<00:02:01.860> so

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
me it's a lot of technique to involve so

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.950 
me it's a lot of technique to involve so
this<00:02:02.580> is<00:02:02.610> two<00:02:02.970> minute<00:02:03.210> tango<00:02:03.570> and<00:02:03.720> i'm<00:02:03.810> your
