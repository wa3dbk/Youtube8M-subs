00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.229 
what's the best thing about much there
it's<00:03:44.530> a<00:03:44.650> completely<00:03:45.040> different<00:03:45.459> crowd<00:03:45.670> to<00:03:46.120> be

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239 
it's a completely different crowd to be

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:49.740 
it's a completely different crowd to be
interviewing<00:03:46.690> as<00:03:46.870> a<00:03:46.959> football<00:03:47.590> but<00:03:48.569> it's<00:03:49.569> more

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750

family orientated I think it's a

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:54.000 
family orientated I think it's a
completely<00:03:52.299> different<00:03:52.569> crowd<00:03:53.049> probably<00:03:53.620> more

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
completely different crowd probably more

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.420 
completely different crowd probably more

that<00:03:57.970> the<00:03:58.060> kids<00:03:58.450> love<00:03:58.629> it<00:03:58.810> and<00:03:59.379> I<00:03:59.680> do<00:03:59.860> think<00:04:00.280> it

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
that the kids love it and I do think it

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.329
