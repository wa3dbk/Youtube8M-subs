00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:17.950
 I decided to make a museum because my 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:20.380
 Grandmother when I died, I mean things 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:22.330
 they were getting lost, I did not know 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:25.500
 Where I went, I asked my mother to send 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:29.140
 me from the south that was already in the river all 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.550
 their paraphernalia and make sweet nÃ© 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.220
 and that's where I decided to open a museum 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:36.899
 so as not to lose the traditions to 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.899
 tell this story right 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.060
 all these objects were my grandmother's 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.340
 there are few things I will gain from 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:54.070
 other people but the whole collection of my 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:56.200
 family grandmother has a few 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:59.830
 cups there want the gift of time john 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:02.019
 which was already her family's house 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:05.260
 which had pellets in kepler diseases 

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:07.660
 but it's pretty old even I did 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:11.619
 an exhibition here on the river that was 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:15.610
 200-year exhibition of the royal family and 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:17.410
 they sent right to examine the parts 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.030
 pieces some parts lines that were 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:21.850
 for the exhibition was also 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.710
 It 's in the river and they 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.710
 found that the pieces really were 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:29.520
 authentic the days of Dom Joao 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.520
 1800 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:47.010
 I love this cap. 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.350
 that I'm right 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:52.050
 and these all ants use uses up 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.940
 today because with these shapes that here 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:58.320

00:01:53.940 --> 00:02:02.369

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:05.360

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:08.310

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:11.009

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.870
 I had them made of nox and today I use 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:17.090
 the same cups to make sweets 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.090

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:35.480

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.389

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.310

00:02:38.389 --> 00:02:42.409
