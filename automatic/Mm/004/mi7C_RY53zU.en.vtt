nice<00:00:19.510> has<00:00:19.810> a<00:00:19.840> nice<00:00:20.080> FPS<00:00:21.240> one<00:00:22.240> thing<00:00:22.450> I<00:00:22.539> did

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:22.750 
nice has a nice FPS one thing I did

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:24.930 
nice has a nice FPS one thing I did
notice<00:00:22.780> about<00:00:23.140> the<00:00:23.410> evil<00:00:23.680> 3d<00:00:24.010> is<00:00:24.280> that<00:00:24.580> it<00:00:24.789> did

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:24.940 
notice about the evil 3d is that it did

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:29.010 
notice about the evil 3d is that it did
not<00:00:25.180> get<00:00:26.080> as<00:00:26.619> much<00:00:26.949> clarity<00:00:27.580> in<00:00:28.150> the<00:00:28.449> dark<00:00:28.720> as

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:29.020 
not get as much clarity in the dark as

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.220 
not get as much clarity in the dark as
any<00:00:29.590> other<00:00:29.710> camera<00:00:30.160> but<00:00:31.150> that<00:00:31.630> seems<00:00:32.020> more

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:32.230 
any other camera but that seems more

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:34.169 
any other camera but that seems more
realistic<00:00:32.619> if<00:00:33.039> I<00:00:33.159> were<00:00:33.249> to<00:00:33.339> hold<00:00:33.489> the<00:00:33.640> EVO<00:00:33.879> 3d

00:00:34.169 --> 00:00:34.179 
realistic if I were to hold the EVO 3d

00:00:34.179 --> 00:00:37.860 
realistic if I were to hold the EVO 3d
over<00:00:34.989> there<00:00:35.260> you<00:00:36.010> could<00:00:36.190> see<00:00:36.399> that<00:00:36.609> it's<00:00:36.999> dark

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:37.870 
over there you could see that it's dark

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.559 
over there you could see that it's dark
and<00:00:38.109> that<00:00:38.649> looks<00:00:38.949> very<00:00:39.039> humanely<00:00:39.940> accurate

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:40.569 
and that looks very humanely accurate

00:00:40.569 --> 00:00:42.329 
and that looks very humanely accurate
well<00:00:41.140> if<00:00:41.260> I<00:00:41.379> were<00:00:41.499> to<00:00:41.589> hold<00:00:41.739> the<00:00:41.859> evo<00:00:42.190> over

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:42.339 
well if I were to hold the evo over

00:00:42.339 --> 00:00:43.889 
well if I were to hold the evo over
there<00:00:42.550> it<00:00:42.729> seemed<00:00:42.969> like<00:00:43.089> a<00:00:43.120> created<00:00:43.600> fake

00:00:43.889 --> 00:00:43.899 
there it seemed like a created fake

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:46.919 
there it seemed like a created fake
light<00:00:44.170> and<00:00:44.409> that<00:00:44.589> didn't<00:00:44.979> look<00:00:45.190> as<00:00:45.609> good<00:00:46.120> as<00:00:46.600> it

00:00:46.919 --> 00:00:46.929 
light and that didn't look as good as it

00:00:46.929 --> 00:00:49.229 
light and that didn't look as good as it
would<00:00:47.139> with<00:00:47.199> the<00:00:47.649> evo<00:00:47.920> 3d<00:00:48.249> looks<00:00:48.819> more

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:49.239 
would with the evo 3d looks more

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:53.789 
would with the evo 3d looks more
realistic<00:00:49.539> this<00:00:49.960> way<00:00:50.999> or<00:00:52.019> over<00:00:53.019> there<00:00:53.049> that's

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:53.799 
realistic this way or over there that's

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:57.569 
realistic this way or over there that's
what<00:00:54.010> it<00:00:54.069> looks<00:00:54.280> like<00:00:54.460> in<00:00:55.649> real<00:00:56.649> time<00:00:57.069> real

00:00:57.569 --> 00:00:57.579 
what it looks like in real time real

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:01.079 
what it looks like in real time real
