00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
 in art 

00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:09.450
 now that pete is today I have in my box 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.450
 of unboxing the alcatel one touch watch 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.459
 We could try it for the first time in the 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:16.810
 mobile world congress and the truth is that 

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:20.470
 the feeling that he left us was very 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:22.870
 positive not only because it's a clock 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:26.590
 a very affordable price 130 euros 

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:29.680
 but because it is also compatible with 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:32.200
 android and with that is how we go there 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.780
 with this unboxing of the alcatel one touch 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.130
 watch if it's also called watch because 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.710
 in the end he finished watch is a name 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:42.130
 generic clock and here we have the 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:45.579
 alcatel smart watch as you see 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:48.550
 this red box and letter design 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:50.500
 Well, it has a style like that young 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:53.649
 style iPhone 3 is going 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.960
 thought for good and not so good young people 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:59.110
 young as we will now see in the part of 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:01.719
 forward we have white clock design 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.160
 and in the back we have design 

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:05.890
 black the two colors in which it is 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:08.890
 available in this part of here we have 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.780
 some of the features like 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.840
 example that serves as control 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:16.000
 remote music and it also serves us 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.400
 as a daily record of activities 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.610
 something else has this watch 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.290
 in the part of here we have also the 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:26.140
 two operating systems with which it is 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:29.920
 compatible android eye from the 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:35.220
 version 4.3 this is from the 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:35.220
 version 7 and we are going to open the box 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:41.840
 and another box a white box in this case 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:44.420
 it is also exactly the same as the red 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.630
 just that blank with the same 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.630
 images 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:57.800
 tatxan here we have the watch in this 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.800
 occasion in white color 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.660
 and we go with the other box that is in the 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.660
 box 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:12.459
 I'm here 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:12.459
 that resists me and that I do not 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:24.020
 one montonazo papers as those 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.610
 has the idol 3 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.080
 come on with this you have literature for 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.180
 all summer you can even learn 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:34.850
 languages and in the box we also 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:38.180
 we found with this cable because this 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:40.010
 cable is not a cable itself 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.770
 to recharge the watch but it's a 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.600
 extension to facilitate the 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:46.790
 task and because the only cable that 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.550
 we have an extension because, because 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.680
 connection the usb with which the 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:54.200
 clock is directly integrated into the 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.000
 strap with which to facilitate the 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.360
 task all we need is this 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.220
 extension cable that we can use or not and 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.170
 there's nothing else in the 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:08.930
 box that this we do not want for 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:11.510
 nothing and now we are going to watch 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:14.269
 I'll take the first plastic 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:17.060
 this plastic we see represented the 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:19.400
 interface of course as it is compatible 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.680
 with jesse with android does not use nor 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.079
 android wear ni does not use watch or 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.969
 it is so for good or for bad use 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:29.840
 your own operating system based on 

00:03:25.969 --> 00:03:33.200
 these icons I'm going to remove the sticker and 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:38.269
 we find a 1.22 screen 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:41.389
 inches and 240 x 204 pixels of 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:43.879
 resolution and since we're talking about 

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:45.889
 the screen then I'm going to turn it on 

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:48.709
 that you see that it offers a very good image 

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:52.129
 very colorful and as you can see like 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:54.919
 happens with the Motorola 360 in this part 

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:57.530
 below we do not have a screen but here 

00:03:54.919 --> 00:04:00.409
 what we have is a function a button 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:02.689
 touch in this part around here 

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:04.689
 of the digital screen we have a bevel 

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:07.969
 that in which the marked hours come 

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:09.420
 and then the box is a combination of 

00:04:07.969 --> 00:04:12.180
 metal 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:17.970
 it's all the part around to the 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:20.220
 fit to the strap and plastic in this 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.660
 part of here behind you see this part of 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:24.960
 here good because this part of here is 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:28.610
 up so we can adjust to 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.610
 wrist thickness that we have 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:34.990
 leave like this 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:37.030
 under the piece and it would be perfectly 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:38.890
 subject once we have it 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:44.400
 adjusted in our size we what 

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:44.400
 place and close it like this 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:51.460
 we hold on with this villa 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:53.680
 and we would be perfectly closed 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:55.390
 there are two belt sizes one that is 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.100
 shorter and one that is a little bit more 

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:59.860
 long in theory, what I'm wearing 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:01.600
 is one that is shorter and that could 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.950
 be designed for women's dolls 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.420
 but here we find a 

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:07.060
 problem that we will see a little more in 

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:10.840
 depth in the review and that is 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:13.330
 The size of the strap does not adjust to 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:16.000
 size of the doll because then because 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:18.840
 the metal anchor is too wide 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.950
 whereby the strap does not end up adjusting 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:23.250
 perfectly to the doll if the doll 

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:27.180
 it's tiny in this part of here 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:29.139
 we have the heart rate sensor 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:30.970
 because we have a rhythm sensor 

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:32.770
 cardiac good because it's going to be a 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:35.080
 watch that is thought eminently 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:37.060
 to measure our daily activity by 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:38.950
 of course you will have notifications but 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:40.419
 certainly yes it has a great 

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:43.300
 component and many applications 

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:45.430
 designed for this purpose on the belt we 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:48.760
 we found another surprise and the 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:50.380
 we have an nfc chip here to be able 

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:52.960
 link it with devices that have 

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:55.000
 also this technology and that be more 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:56.620
 quick pairing to remove this 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.040
 sticker here I've removed it before 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:03.660
 and so I show you another of the things that 

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:06.790
 has the strap and is the usb connection 

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:09.669
 connection by which we can recharge the 

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:10.750
 device is covered with this cap 

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:14.080
 here 

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:15.610
 and we hope it does not spoil with the 

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:18.100
 time in addition to the rhythm sensor 

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:21.190
 cardiac has altimeter 

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:23.080
 gyroscope accelerometer also counts 

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:24.490
 with bluetooth 4.0 technology which is 

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:28.810
 Carlos who is going to connect to our 

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:31.330
 device and it's submersible eye ip67 what 

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:33.730
 that allows us to have it submerged to a 

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:35.170
 one and a half meters deep for 30 

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:37.150
 minutes with which we will be able to 

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:39.970
 wear in any situation to 

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:41.980
 I forgot how you see this color 

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:43.930
 it is white it is also in black and 

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:45.100
 Straps can not only be plastic 

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:48.100
 in black and white but also 

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:51.580
 they can be metal link belts 

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:54.030
 the screen as you see is tactile 

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:55.569
 and we can handle it by the interface 

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:58.360
 directly from the screen 

00:06:55.569 --> 00:07:01.300
 using this white part here that 

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:03.699
 it is a touch button and also this other 

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:04.900
 which is a physical button at the time of 

00:07:03.699 --> 00:07:06.849
 synchronize it we will have to 

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:08.250
 download the one touch move app 

00:07:06.849 --> 00:07:11.080
 on our mobile device 

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:12.909
 synchronize it and it would already be super 

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:14.979
 simple finally the autonomy of your 

00:07:12.909 --> 00:07:16.750
 battery because even though it has 210 

00:07:14.979 --> 00:07:18.159
 milliamperes which is what you can have 

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:21.280
 the battery of any other watch 

00:07:18.159 --> 00:07:24.219
 smart this one has it super well 

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:26.650
 taken advantage of because it gives a range of 

00:07:24.219 --> 00:07:28.389
 between 2 and 5 days and we who already 

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:31.060
 we have been testing the truth is that 

00:07:28.389 --> 00:07:34.389
 we assure you that this is how he gives us 

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:36.699
 approximately 34 days then of a 

00:07:34.389 --> 00:07:38.199
 Usual use of receiving notifications and 

00:07:36.699 --> 00:07:40.240
 others its price as I said is of 

00:07:38.199 --> 00:07:42.909
 approximately about 130 euros if we 

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:45.250
 we put right now to touch it for 

00:07:42.909 --> 00:07:48.210
 do the corresponding review we 

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:48.210
 we see in the following video
