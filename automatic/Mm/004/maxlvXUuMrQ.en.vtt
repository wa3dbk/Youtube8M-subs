00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:10.750
 ah 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.310
 to 

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.310
 Y 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.510
 we sell fabrics we make bags 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.820
 everything is manual 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:22.540
 everything is done by hand the password to the 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.930
 old fashion 

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:27.670
 I hurry up, I'm a biologist, I do not have 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:29.680
 that has nothing to do with the fabrics 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:31.779
 and my professional life was not going for that 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.090
 but hey at a certain moment he wants 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:37.949
 disconnect breaks if the patchwork is a 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:41.379
 good tool for that you go from 

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:43.480
 you release many things and you sign up 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:46.540
 what you really like are no 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:49.100
 More reasons is a difficult step because 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:51.500
 there is a lot of risk 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.989
 but if you try you always 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:58.219
 you will be left with the question of whether you could 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:01:00.519
 have done or not problems at all not 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:03.530
 there is no ease nor in terms of 

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:05.119
 administrations or anything then you have 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.930
 that you 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:11.690
 Liarte and see how the thing goes if you 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:15.380
 you have an idea you trust her and you do not 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:17.360
 it goes a bit eating to make it oysters 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.770
 throw the pool because if you have very 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.240
 little to lose is to us for the 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.630
 investment that we made because we already did 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.310
 the test and it was pretty good if 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.649
 we lost because there was experience 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.729
 done all this and we will not lose 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:31.490
 too much the truth the family with the 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:34.190
 I support all that, they taught me what 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.259
 you do it's fine it's nice to show it to 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.720
 the other people and the people responded well 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:41.569
 totes says then why not go from 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.850
 do it as a hobby to a business or 

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:46.580
 a personal project towards the others 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:49.670
 people costs because of moving to 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:51.500
 do it because you like to have it as your 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.420
 business then you have to be pretty 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.670
 strict organized as 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.470
 I work not to take it as a job what 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.030
 that you know how to do it, you will do it well 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.420
 and what you do not know because you have to 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.759
 learn it 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.619
 effort and believe in the 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:08.720
 project and throw yourself into the pool is that 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.720
 not work work traced 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.670
 no no no 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.670
 yes 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.420
 and 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.060
 and yes
