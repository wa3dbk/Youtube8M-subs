00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
blue and very distinctive in the in soda

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.840 
blue and very distinctive in the in soda
aisle<00:01:52.649> so<00:01:54.710> I'm<00:01:55.710> going<00:01:55.860> to<00:01:55.920> give<00:01:56.369> it<00:01:56.490> a<00:01:56.579> taste

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
aisle so I'm going to give it a taste

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:16.840 
aisle so I'm going to give it a taste
here

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.570 

and<00:02:17.850> before<00:02:18.750> I<00:02:18.780> drink<00:02:19.380> it<00:02:19.530> I<00:02:19.650> want<00:02:19.920> to<00:02:20.010> just<00:02:20.460> go

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
and before I drink it I want to just go

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.570 
and before I drink it I want to just go
ahead<00:02:20.610> and<00:02:20.850> compare<00:02:21.180> it<00:02:21.360> side-by-side<00:02:22.580> cause

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
ahead and compare it side-by-side cause

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.110 
ahead and compare it side-by-side cause
to<00:02:24.180> County<00:02:24.990> Park<00:02:25.200> over<00:02:25.380> here<00:02:25.470> I<00:02:25.620> have<00:02:25.740> a<00:02:25.770> can

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
to County Park over here I have a can

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:40.070 
to County Park over here I have a can
left<00:02:27.120> over<00:02:35.990> yeah<00:02:36.990> so<00:02:37.260> certainly<00:02:39.080> Mountain

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
left over yeah so certainly Mountain

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.750 
left over yeah so certainly Mountain
dark<00:02:40.290> berries<00:02:40.530> a<00:02:40.590> little<00:02:40.620> darker<00:02:41.130> of<00:02:41.460> a<00:02:41.640> blue

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
dark berries a little darker of a blue

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.610 
dark berries a little darker of a blue
but<00:02:41.940> obviously<00:02:42.180> this<00:02:42.330> just<00:02:42.570> food<00:02:43.080> coloring<00:02:43.500> so

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
but obviously this just food coloring so

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.190 
but obviously this just food coloring so
let<00:02:44.520> me<00:02:44.610> give<00:02:44.910> fountain<00:02:45.420> to<00:02:45.510> voltage<00:02:45.840> of<00:02:45.960> fresh

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
let me give fountain to voltage of fresh

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.870 
let me give fountain to voltage of fresh
taste<00:02:46.530> without<00:02:46.830> even<00:02:47.160> thinking<00:02:47.610> too<00:02:47.760> hard

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
taste without even thinking too hard

00:02:47.880 --> 00:03:01.440 
taste without even thinking too hard
about<00:02:48.000> Mountain<00:02:48.690> Dew<00:02:48.780> dark<00:02:48.960> berry

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
right so you know it's it says raspberry

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.320 
right so you know it's it says raspberry
citrus<00:03:06.250> and<00:03:07.250> that's<00:03:07.430> what<00:03:07.580> comes<00:03:07.700> across<00:03:07.880> it's

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
citrus and that's what comes across it's

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.210 
citrus and that's what comes across it's
it's<00:03:08.540> blue<00:03:08.780> so<00:03:08.810> you<00:03:09.230> made<00:03:09.500> makes<00:03:09.770> me<00:03:09.920> think<00:03:10.130> of

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
it's blue so you made makes me think of

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:11.620 
it's blue so you made makes me think of
that<00:03:10.250> blue<00:03:10.490> raspberry<00:03:10.700> I<00:03:10.970> see<00:03:11.210> that<00:03:11.330> I<00:03:11.360> talked

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
that blue raspberry I see that I talked

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.490 
that blue raspberry I see that I talked
about<00:03:11.720> with<00:03:12.350> dark<00:03:12.590> berry<00:03:14.020> feel<00:03:15.020> the<00:03:15.110> same<00:03:15.320> way

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
about with dark berry feel the same way

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.150 
about with dark berry feel the same way
hear<00:03:15.800> about<00:03:16.040> the<00:03:16.280> the<00:03:16.850> kind<00:03:17.240> of<00:03:17.270> blue<00:03:17.450> I<00:03:17.480> see<00:03:17.840> uh

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
flavor it's the flavor that I like it's

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:33.460

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
okay I'm a fan of Mountain Dew so no I

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.830 
okay I'm a fan of Mountain Dew so no I
do<00:03:33.860> like<00:03:34.550> this<00:03:34.760> flavor<00:03:35.060> in<00:03:35.330> the<00:03:35.450> same<00:03:35.630> way<00:03:35.750> that

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
do like this flavor in the same way that

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.980 
do like this flavor in the same way that
I<00:03:35.930> like<00:03:36.140> do<00:03:37.270> now<00:03:38.270> let<00:03:38.390> me<00:03:38.450> compare<00:03:38.720> it<00:03:38.840> a<00:03:38.870> little

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:38.990 
I like do now let me compare it a little

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:50.710 
I like do now let me compare it a little
bit<00:03:39.110> to<00:03:39.290> the<00:03:39.440> dark<00:03:40.340> berry<00:03:49.450> not<00:03:50.450> back<00:03:50.600> to<00:03:50.690> the

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
bit to the dark berry not back to the

00:03:50.720 --> 00:04:11.920 
bit to the dark berry not back to the
voltage<00:04:09.040> and<00:04:10.040> back<00:04:10.220> to<00:04:10.430> the<00:04:10.600> dark<00:04:11.600> berry<00:04:11.780> yeah

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 
voltage and back to the dark berry yeah

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.199 
voltage and back to the dark berry yeah
I<00:04:11.959> mean<00:04:12.170> they're<00:04:13.130> very<00:04:13.340> similar<00:04:13.700> I<00:04:13.970> kind<00:04:14.180> of

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:14.209 
I mean they're very similar I kind of

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:15.850 
I mean they're very similar I kind of
detect<00:04:14.540> a<00:04:14.630> subtle<00:04:14.959> difference<00:04:15.440> between<00:04:15.739> the

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:15.860 
detect a subtle difference between the

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:20.020 
detect a subtle difference between the
two<00:04:16.010> but<00:04:16.280> it's<00:04:16.430> very<00:04:16.609> hard<00:04:16.880> for<00:04:16.970> me<00:04:17.120> to<00:04:18.940> for<00:04:19.940> me

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
two but it's very hard for me to for me

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:21.340 
two but it's very hard for me to for me
to<00:04:20.120> point<00:04:20.330> out<00:04:20.480> what<00:04:20.750> that<00:04:20.930> subtle<00:04:21.320> difference

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:21.350 
to point out what that subtle difference

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:25.390 
to point out what that subtle difference
is<00:04:21.980> it's<00:04:22.280> it's<00:04:22.490> very<00:04:22.550> slight<00:04:24.010> but<00:04:25.010> the<00:04:25.160> flavor

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
is it's it's very slight but the flavor

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.430 
is it's it's very slight but the flavor
I<00:04:25.700> mean<00:04:26.210> they<00:04:26.300> do<00:04:26.360> have<00:04:26.540> some<00:04:26.660> slight<00:04:26.930> variance

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
I mean they do have some slight variance

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:38.860 
I mean they do have some slight variance
there<00:04:36.820> yeah<00:04:37.820> there<00:04:38.150> is<00:04:38.270> there's<00:04:38.540> a<00:04:38.600> definitely

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:38.870 
there yeah there is there's a definitely

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:40.480 
there yeah there is there's a definitely
difference<00:04:39.320> in<00:04:39.440> flavors<00:04:39.860> there's<00:04:40.310> some

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
difference in flavors there's some

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:42.820 
difference in flavors there's some
relation<00:04:40.880> but<00:04:41.150> they're<00:04:41.300> different<00:04:41.479> so<00:04:42.110> you

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.830 
relation but they're different so you

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:43.930 
relation but they're different so you
know<00:04:42.950> I'm<00:04:43.040> glad<00:04:43.250> the<00:04:43.340> Mountain<00:04:43.580> Dew<00:04:43.669> didn't

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:43.940 
know I'm glad the Mountain Dew didn't

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:47.020 
know I'm glad the Mountain Dew didn't
just<00:04:44.120> repackage<00:04:44.830> voltage<00:04:45.830> as<00:04:46.070> dark<00:04:46.550> berry<00:04:46.820> and

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.030 
just repackage voltage as dark berry and

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:48.490 
just repackage voltage as dark berry and
put<00:04:47.150> it<00:04:47.240> out<00:04:47.390> as<00:04:47.600> something<00:04:47.810> new<00:04:48.050> because<00:04:48.200> you

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:48.500 
put it out as something new because you

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:49.780 
put it out as something new because you
know<00:04:48.620> there<00:04:48.770> are<00:04:48.860> different<00:04:49.310> flavors<00:04:49.400> and<00:04:49.729> I

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:49.790 
know there are different flavors and I

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:51.400 
know there are different flavors and I
think<00:04:49.940> they'll<00:04:50.060> appeal<00:04:50.390> differently<00:04:51.200> to

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:51.410 
think they'll appeal differently to

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:54.880 
think they'll appeal differently to
different<00:04:51.650> people<00:04:53.229> for<00:04:54.229> my<00:04:54.380> part<00:04:54.680> of<00:04:54.740> it<00:04:54.860> I

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:54.890 
different people for my part of it I

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:56.770 
different people for my part of it I
kind<00:04:55.130> of<00:04:55.190> like<00:04:55.490> the<00:04:55.729> flavor<00:04:56.000> of<00:04:56.150> dark<00:04:56.540> berry

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:56.780 
kind of like the flavor of dark berry

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:58.780 
kind of like the flavor of dark berry
more<00:04:57.229> and<00:04:57.530> though<00:04:58.010> I'm<00:04:58.130> not<00:04:58.250> necessarily

00:04:58.780 --> 00:04:58.790 
more and though I'm not necessarily

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:00.280 
more and though I'm not necessarily
going<00:04:58.880> to<00:04:58.940> write<00:04:59.150> down<00:04:59.180> for<00:04:59.750> it<00:04:59.900> I<00:04:59.960> like<00:05:00.140> the

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:00.290 
going to write down for it I like the

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:02.050 
going to write down for it I like the
fact<00:05:00.440> that<00:05:00.530> it<00:05:00.680> didn't<00:05:01.040> have<00:05:01.190> that<00:05:01.220> ginseng<00:05:01.910> in

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:02.060 
fact that it didn't have that ginseng in

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.960 
fact that it didn't have that ginseng in
it<00:05:02.180> doesn't<00:05:02.570> have<00:05:02.690> that<00:05:02.919> sort<00:05:03.919> of<00:05:04.010> attempt<00:05:04.820> at

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:04.970 
it doesn't have that sort of attempt at
