00:05:28.089 --> 00:05:28.099 
while you were creating it or was it

00:05:28.099 --> 00:05:31.629 
while you were creating it or was it
just<00:05:28.130> easiest<00:05:28.610> thing<00:05:28.849> in<00:05:28.970> Iraq<00:05:29.240> was<00:05:29.750> to<00:05:30.610> mr.<00:05:31.610> a

00:05:31.629 --> 00:05:31.639 
just easiest thing in Iraq was to mr. a

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:33.700 
just easiest thing in Iraq was to mr. a
product<00:05:32.210> development<00:05:32.780> guy<00:05:32.960> the<00:05:33.320> key<00:05:33.680> thing

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:33.710 
product development guy the key thing

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:35.860 
product development guy the key thing
really<00:05:34.130> is<00:05:34.400> making<00:05:34.789> the<00:05:34.909> interface<00:05:35.240> obvious

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:35.870 
really is making the interface obvious

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:36.780 
really is making the interface obvious
and<00:05:36.050> easy<00:05:36.110> we're<00:05:36.470> really

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:36.790 
and easy we're really

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:38.760 
and easy we're really
maintain<00:05:37.390> a<00:05:37.510> minimal<00:05:37.870> interface<00:05:38.290> so<00:05:38.470> we<00:05:38.560> don't

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:38.770 
maintain a minimal interface so we don't

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:41.010 
maintain a minimal interface so we don't
really<00:05:38.920> need<00:05:39.130> to<00:05:39.280> have<00:05:39.430> a<00:05:39.460> large<00:05:40.270> training<00:05:40.750> and

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:41.020 
really need to have a large training and

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:42.480 
really need to have a large training and
development<00:05:41.350> effort<00:05:41.650> going<00:05:41.800> on<00:05:42.070> that<00:05:42.340> it's

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:42.490 
development effort going on that it's

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:44.910 
development effort going on that it's
natural<00:05:43.000> and<00:05:43.120> intuitive<00:05:43.540> right<00:05:44.320> concept<00:05:44.740> of

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:44.920 
natural and intuitive right concept of

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:46.770 
natural and intuitive right concept of
tapping<00:05:45.340> and<00:05:45.520> drawing<00:05:45.940> and<00:05:46.210> and<00:05:46.420> it<00:05:46.570> looked

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:46.780 
tapping and drawing and and it looked

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:48.780 
tapping and drawing and and it looked
like<00:05:46.840> from<00:05:47.170> what<00:05:47.350> you<00:05:47.470> were<00:05:47.590> showing<00:05:47.790> it's

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:48.790 
like from what you were showing it's

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:51.180 
like from what you were showing it's
like<00:05:49.120> you<00:05:49.630> start<00:05:50.020> you<00:05:50.320> just<00:05:50.530> start<00:05:50.740> tapping

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:51.190 
like you start you just start tapping

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:53.460 
like you start you just start tapping
and<00:05:51.370> then<00:05:51.640> you're<00:05:52.000> done<00:05:52.210> and<00:05:52.480> that's<00:05:52.570> so<00:05:52.960> for

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:53.470 
and then you're done and that's so for

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:55.650 
and then you're done and that's so for
example<00:05:53.560> you<00:05:54.010> know<00:05:54.280> another<00:05:54.580> aspect<00:05:55.210> of<00:05:55.450> other

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:55.660 
example you know another aspect of other

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:57.420 
example you know another aspect of other
product<00:05:56.260> let<00:05:56.380> me<00:05:56.470> go<00:05:56.830> back<00:05:56.980> in<00:05:57.130> the<00:05:57.190> middle

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:57.430 
product let me go back in the middle

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:59.640 
product let me go back in the middle
right<00:05:57.640> is<00:05:58.030> really<00:05:58.600> how<00:05:58.750> we're<00:05:58.960> sort<00:05:59.200> of<00:05:59.260> using

00:05:59.640 --> 00:05:59.650 
right is really how we're sort of using

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:02.130 
right is really how we're sort of using
you<00:06:00.190> know<00:06:00.220> the<00:06:00.460> concept<00:06:00.970> of<00:06:01.060> a<00:06:01.210> placement<00:06:01.990> by

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:02.140 
you know the concept of a placement by

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:04.410 
you know the concept of a placement by
basically<00:06:02.530> a<00:06:02.680> drag<00:06:03.070> out<00:06:03.280> but<00:06:03.970> we<00:06:04.090> can<00:06:04.240> also

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:04.420 
basically a drag out but we can also

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:05.850 
basically a drag out but we can also
basically<00:06:04.930> just<00:06:05.170> happen<00:06:05.530> and<00:06:05.590> get<00:06:05.740> an

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:05.860 
basically just happen and get an

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:08.580 
basically just happen and get an
innocent<00:06:06.550> creation<00:06:07.120> and<00:06:07.330> also<00:06:07.990> those<00:06:08.140> people

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:08.590 
innocent creation and also those people

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:09.990 
innocent creation and also those people
that<00:06:08.620> are<00:06:08.800> familiar<00:06:08.920> with<00:06:09.130> inspirational

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:10.000 
that are familiar with inspirational

was a pretty lightly example for not
much<00:06:27.100> context<00:06:27.580> now<00:06:27.730> light<00:06:28.000> and<00:06:28.300> then<00:06:28.570> I<00:06:28.690> can

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:28.840 
much context now light and then I can

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:31.560 
much context now light and then I can
also<00:06:29.020> have<00:06:29.320> me<00:06:29.650> there<00:06:29.680> that's<00:06:30.460> yeah<00:06:31.120> good<00:06:31.480> the

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:31.570 
also have me there that's yeah good the

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:32.910 
also have me there that's yeah good the
important<00:06:32.050> that's<00:06:32.200> right<00:06:32.380> and<00:06:32.650> then

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:32.920 
important that's right and then

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:34.590 
important that's right and then
basically<00:06:33.130> tapping<00:06:33.940> and<00:06:34.060> dragging<00:06:34.540> your
