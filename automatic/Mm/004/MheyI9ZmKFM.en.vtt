the<00:01:14.729> keyboard<00:01:15.210> as<00:01:15.509> well<00:01:15.900> and<00:01:16.229> he<00:01:16.740> just<00:01:17.040> will

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
the keyboard as well and he just will

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.109 
the keyboard as well and he just will
not<00:01:17.729> climb<00:01:18.119> up<00:01:18.740> nothing<00:01:19.740> he<00:01:19.890> can<00:01:20.070> do<00:01:20.220> there<00:01:20.250> his

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
not climb up nothing he can do there his

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.880 
not climb up nothing he can do there his
hands<00:01:21.810> kind<00:01:22.020> of<00:01:22.080> click<00:01:22.320> through<00:01:22.350> that<00:01:22.710> little

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
hands kind of click through that little

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.039 
hands kind of click through that little
metal<00:01:23.310> there<00:01:25.580> and<00:01:26.580> so<00:01:26.939> like<00:01:27.150> I<00:01:27.360> thought<00:01:27.600> maybe

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
metal there and so like I thought maybe

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.899 
metal there and so like I thought maybe
you<00:01:28.650> know<00:01:28.770> you<00:01:28.829> would<00:01:29.100> throw<00:01:29.340> a<00:01:29.369> remote

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
you know you would throw a remote

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.760 
you know you would throw a remote
control<00:01:30.270> Batarang<00:01:30.750> through<00:01:31.049> it<00:01:31.229> per<00:01:31.560> house

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
control Batarang through it per house

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.110 
control Batarang through it per house
and<00:01:32.159> that<00:01:32.759> would<00:01:32.970> be<00:01:33.150> how<00:01:33.420> it

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:34.120 
and that would be how it

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.490 
and that would be how it
you<00:01:34.300> know<00:01:34.450> there'd<00:01:34.690> be<00:01:34.810> a<00:01:34.840> little<00:01:35.080> switch<00:01:35.320> or

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
you know there'd be a little switch or

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.350 
you know there'd be a little switch or
something<00:01:35.830> that<00:01:35.980> would<00:01:36.040> open<00:01:36.340> that<00:01:36.370> gate<00:01:36.700> but

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 
something that would open that gate but

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.480 
something that would open that gate but
that's<00:01:37.540> also<00:01:37.810> not<00:01:38.020> the<00:01:38.350> case<00:01:41.250> see<00:01:42.250> it's

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
that's also not the case see it's

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:43.920 
that's also not the case see it's
supposed<00:01:42.670> to<00:01:42.880> be<00:01:43.030> something<00:01:43.420> that<00:01:43.450> Batman

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:43.930 
supposed to be something that Batman

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:48.660 
supposed to be something that Batman
crawls<00:01:44.260> out<00:01:44.440> of<00:01:44.500> at<00:01:44.800> the<00:01:44.950> end<00:01:46.890> and<00:01:47.890> he<00:01:48.430> just

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
crawls out of at the end and he just

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.890 
crawls out of at the end and he just
won't<00:01:49.060> go<00:01:49.600> up<00:01:49.810> into<00:01:50.110> there<00:01:50.290> so<00:01:51.390> this<00:01:52.390> means<00:01:52.660> I'm

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:52.900 
won't go up into there so this means I'm

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.660 
won't go up into there so this means I'm
stuck<00:01:53.320> in<00:01:53.530> this<00:01:53.650> room<00:01:53.920> I<00:01:54.160> have<00:01:54.340> to<00:01:54.370> actually

quit out in the game to get back in and

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.880 
quit out in the game to get back in and
it<00:01:57.700> also<00:01:57.880> means<00:01:58.240> that<00:01:58.390> I<00:01:58.540> cannot<00:01:58.990> access<00:01:59.350> the

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
it also means that I cannot access the

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.880 
it also means that I cannot access the
