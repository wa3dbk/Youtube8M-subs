00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 and the pros and cons of course for myself did 

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:07.589
 Alexander in all his interviews you 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.870
 call team astana your team 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.300
 and we all know that it was created 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.490
 sometime especially for you under now 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.980
 you feel comfortable working led the team 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.630
 Astana was created for me 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.939
 it is said loudly therefore 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.930
 In 2000, of course, we created this 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:27.050
 the team with the help of our president with 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:31.230
 using give gear 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:34.890
 thanks to them immensely , firstly comfortable 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:38.100
 or not of course when you return to your 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:41.520
 command you then when you dress again 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.230
 national can say our form 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:48.800
 countries of course feel comfortable 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.800
 and when so many Kazakhstani team and 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.310
 alberto kontador with us is a big 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:59.320
 Stimulation probably for our young 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:01:01.930
 riders in the first place and secondly, I again 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:04.030
 here is why I feel comfortable Alexander 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:06.640
 Unfortunately, you have been to the center more than once. 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.920
 some scandalous stories and probably 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.950
 you have already developed an immunity critic and 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.690
 especially to gossip about you now this 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.460
 the air looks a lot of young 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:17.470
 athletes and for some of them you 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.090
 idol that's what you can advise them 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.860
 what qualities should these 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:26.979
 people to work well big 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:29.950
 sports gossip probably I will say this 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:33.300
 when gossip is made you already 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:35.850
 achieved something and it means talking about you 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:38.080
 even if it's gossip 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.509
 so I reacted it like a corr 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.259
 always indifferent if they wrote some 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:45.000
 articles 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:45.000
 I did not answer them 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:54.640
 I donâ€™t say any feedback 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:58.900
 that straight only one scandals around 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:01.090
 me I would not say so therefore our 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.270
 athletes probably would like 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:08.369
 wish all the same patience and courage and 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.369
 probably only professionalism to go 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:14.940
 let's say you can achieve some 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:19.080
 results treat your business 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:23.650
 professional even in children's sports whether 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:27.690
 train I remember myself when we 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:30.460
 there are 11-15 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:34.570
 12 inherited ran on the mountains to you and those 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:38.980
 three there five hours a day and 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:41.200
 and worked let's say so probably 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.900
 it all comes together and first you need 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:49.420
 work and become some kind of goal and there is 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:54.070
 slopes climb the step every year 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:03:02.560
 above is the principle of all thanks to Alexander 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:03:04.840
 well and we continue our broadcast well and now 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.180
 surprise for fans of the TV show valley 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.610
 wolves we managed to record an exclusive 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.890
 interview with actor jackets sh-shsh masses 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:14.230
 the protagonist of the main character 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.360
 alemdar and shooting in the valley of wolves 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.580
 brought him crazy fame he 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.530
 became literally a folk hero and how 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.480
 the actor himself admitted during the work on the 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:25.050
 film he learned a lot from his 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.050
 character 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:34.900
 state intelligence agent 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.940
 irreconcilable mafia fighter leader in everything 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.350
 but at the same time romantic in the soul such in 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.180
 the protagonist of the legendary series 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:42.040
 wolf valley polat alemdar 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.320
 thanks to this image so masterly 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.480
 incarnate you will lose the masses of Turkey 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:49.300
 increased the number of patriots and Polat 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:51.460
 alemdar became a truly national hero for 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.110
 I play the role and whirlpool at this 

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:53.500
 whose personality each of us dreams of 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:55.630
 become 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.370
 but in fact the quality is inherent in us 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:59.440
 imitate anyone present in each 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:02.500
 man just for some reason you 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:04.540
 hold them back and do not give forgive me not jati 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.580
 chess is proud that his acting 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.680
 career began with this picture 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:10.480
 as the actor himself admitted during filming 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.220
 there have been such moments when he 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.290
 it was hard to play especially 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:16.390
 romantic scenes however he is with 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:19.090
 easily accustomed to the image of Polat Alemdar and 

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:21.549
 I do not know how much I face him but there is 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:23.830
 things that I learned from him he also 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:25.120
 took over some quality a minute i 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.490
 so many years playing this role 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:30.130
 that we have already mixed with him but I do not 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:33.100
 put they jyotish masses we have 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:34.900
 similarity there are differences for the sake of filming in 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.940
 the show is not even jyotish masses even had 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:39.010
 leave your business work on the film 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.660
 goes in hard mode with the arrival 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:42.430
 the popularity of no jati began to flow 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.110
 many offers to play in others 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:46.450
 paintings including abroad 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:48.220
 but as long as he is forced to give up yet 

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:49.780
 less an actor tries to do everything to 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.190
 his work had no effect on 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:53.620
 relationships with people close to him 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:55.960
 relationship with my close ones 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:57.820
 former and as for the time which 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.390
 I can give them something it has become much 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:00.520
 less 

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:02.740
 I have to live in a more limited 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:04.870
 mode however if i need something 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:07.080
 make sure I try to perform 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:09.130
 your dream or duty or fat brother 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:11.260
 despite the fact that at the beginning of the series 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:13.210
 it says that all events are heroes 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:15.040
 fictional viewers have repeatedly seen in 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:17.200
 the fact that the film reflects the reality 

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:19.330
 modern life is happening not only 

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:21.190
 in turkey but also in the world and life and deeds 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:23.050
 Mafia in the series are described as 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:24.640
 it is real that there were even rumors about 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:26.200
 what the film crew was getting 

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:28.479
 warning from representatives 

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:30.820
 criminal structures right to us no one 

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:33.040
 threatened however do not deny talking about 

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:35.050
 it went but we didn't take it 

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:37.060
 nemany we think about what we 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:39.400
 telling in our self should not 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:43.710
 hiding from the people and he us for it 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:43.710
 it's hot and the movies don't go
