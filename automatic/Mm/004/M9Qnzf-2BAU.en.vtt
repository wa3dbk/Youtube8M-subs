00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:08.720 

I<00:00:04.780> keep<00:00:05.440> records<00:00:06.279> of<00:00:06.520> each<00:00:07.240> nucleus<00:00:07.750> colony

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
I keep records of each nucleus colony

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.709 
I keep records of each nucleus colony
for<00:00:10.469> for<00:00:11.469> the<00:00:11.559> present<00:00:11.950> season<00:00:12.340> by<00:00:12.520> writing<00:00:13.510> it

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:13.719 
for for the present season by writing it

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:15.930 
for for the present season by writing it
on<00:00:13.840> duct<00:00:14.080> tape<00:00:14.260> so<00:00:15.100> I<00:00:15.129> can<00:00:15.400> follow<00:00:15.639> the

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:15.940 
on duct tape so I can follow the

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:18.330 
on duct tape so I can follow the
progress<00:00:16.119> of<00:00:16.810> these<00:00:17.230> nucleus<00:00:17.800> colonies

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:18.340 
progress of these nucleus colonies

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.750 
progress of these nucleus colonies
through<00:00:19.330> the<00:00:19.449> summer<00:00:19.720> I<00:00:20.070> can<00:00:21.070> come<00:00:21.250> here<00:00:21.550> and

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:21.760 
through the summer I can come here and

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.810 
through the summer I can come here and
look<00:00:22.210> back<00:00:22.450> a<00:00:22.480> few<00:00:22.780> times<00:00:23.080> and<00:00:23.410> see<00:00:24.400> what

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:24.820 
look back a few times and see what

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:26.220 
look back a few times and see what
happened<00:00:25.210> to<00:00:25.300> this<00:00:25.420> colony<00:00:25.810> if<00:00:25.960> there<00:00:26.110> was

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:26.230 
happened to this colony if there was

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:27.260 
happened to this colony if there was
something<00:00:26.530> wrong<00:00:26.560> with<00:00:26.980> it

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:27.270 
something wrong with it

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.500 
something wrong with it
so<00:00:28.270> this<00:00:28.540> is<00:00:28.750> this<00:00:29.550> these<00:00:30.550> colonies<00:00:31.060> were<00:00:31.210> over

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:31.510 
so this is this these colonies were over

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:33.750 
so this is this these colonies were over
winters<00:00:31.870> these<00:00:32.680> nucleus<00:00:33.160> college<00:00:33.489> so<00:00:33.610> there's

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:33.760 
winters these nucleus college so there's

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.529 
winters these nucleus college so there's
two<00:00:34.000> nucleus<00:00:34.539> colonies<00:00:35.050> in<00:00:35.200> this<00:00:35.320> box<00:00:36.390> one<00:00:37.390> on

00:00:37.529 --> 00:00:37.539 
two nucleus colonies in this box one on

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:40.049 
two nucleus colonies in this box one on
each<00:00:37.690> side<00:00:37.929> of<00:00:37.960> a<00:00:38.199> central<00:00:38.379> divider<00:00:38.949> and<00:00:39.249> each

00:00:40.049 --> 00:00:40.059 
each side of a central divider and each

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:42.000 
each side of a central divider and each
has<00:00:40.300> a<00:00:40.329> four<00:00:40.659> frame<00:00:40.899> super<00:00:41.320> on<00:00:41.499> top<00:00:41.710> so<00:00:41.980> that

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.010 
has a four frame super on top so that

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.349 
has a four frame super on top so that
it's<00:00:42.429> four<00:00:42.760> combs<00:00:43.089> over<00:00:43.569> four<00:00:43.809> combs<00:00:45.359> first

00:00:46.349 --> 00:00:46.359 
it's four combs over four combs first

00:00:46.359 --> 00:00:49.979 
it's four combs over four combs first
time<00:00:46.569> I<00:00:46.600> came<00:00:46.780> through<00:00:47.260> here<00:00:47.679> in<00:00:48.569> May<00:00:49.569> on<00:00:49.929> May

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:49.989 
time I came through here in May on May

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:56.459 
time I came through here in May on May
5th<00:00:51.269> May<00:00:52.269> 5th<00:00:53.729> 2013<00:00:54.729> was<00:00:55.569> the<00:00:55.719> first<00:00:55.929> day<00:00:56.109> I<00:00:56.139> set

00:00:56.459 --> 00:00:56.469 
5th May 5th 2013 was the first day I set

00:00:56.469 --> 00:00:57.869 
5th May 5th 2013 was the first day I set
up<00:00:56.499> cell<00:00:56.829> builders<00:00:57.219> in<00:00:57.370> this<00:00:57.519> yard

00:00:57.869 --> 00:00:57.879 
up cell builders in this yard

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:00.180 
up cell builders in this yard
and<00:00:57.999> so<00:00:58.690> I<00:00:58.719> harvested<00:00:59.440> brood<00:00:59.710> from<00:01:00.010> this

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 
and so I harvested brood from this

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:08.430 
and so I harvested brood from this
colony<00:01:00.729> on<00:01:01.769> May<00:01:02.769> 5th<00:01:03.659> 2013<00:01:06.630> this<00:01:07.630> this<00:01:07.960> nucleus

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:08.440 
colony on May 5th 2013 this this nucleus

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.530 
colony on May 5th 2013 this this nucleus
colony<00:01:08.920> had<00:01:09.070> five<00:01:09.370> frames<00:01:09.670> of<00:01:09.880> brood<00:01:10.030> and<00:01:10.330> I

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:10.540 
colony had five frames of brood and I

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.650 
colony had five frames of brood and I
took<00:01:10.720> away<00:01:10.960> a<00:01:10.990> frame<00:01:11.320> of<00:01:11.470> brood<00:01:12.030> this<00:01:13.030> colony

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:13.660 
took away a frame of brood this colony

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:17.130 
took away a frame of brood this colony
had<00:01:14.050> three<00:01:15.040> frames<00:01:15.370> of<00:01:15.610> brood<00:01:15.790> I<00:01:16.180> didn't<00:01:16.900> feel

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
had three frames of brood I didn't feel

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.260 
had three frames of brood I didn't feel
that<00:01:17.380> it<00:01:17.440> was<00:01:17.620> strong<00:01:18.340> enough<00:01:18.610> to<00:01:18.760> take<00:01:18.940> brood

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.270 
that it was strong enough to take brood

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.050 
that it was strong enough to take brood
from<00:01:19.680> but<00:01:20.680> it<00:01:20.800> was<00:01:20.920> a<00:01:20.950> little<00:01:21.220> honey<00:01:21.490> bound<00:01:21.760> so

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
from but it was a little honey bound so

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.330 
from but it was a little honey bound so
I<00:01:22.090> took<00:01:22.420> away<00:01:22.570> a<00:01:22.690> frame<00:01:22.990> of<00:01:23.140> honey<00:01:23.290> and<00:01:23.590> gave<00:01:24.190> it

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
I took away a frame of honey and gave it

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.550 
I took away a frame of honey and gave it
back<00:01:24.370> a<00:01:24.550> comb<00:01:24.940> so<00:01:25.750> she'd<00:01:25.960> have<00:01:26.020> somewhere<00:01:26.410> to

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 
back a comb so she'd have somewhere to

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.900 
back a comb so she'd have somewhere to
lay<00:01:26.740> and<00:01:27.120> I<00:01:28.140> reversed<00:01:29.140> the<00:01:29.440> the<00:01:30.070> brood<00:01:30.340> combs

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:30.910 
lay and I reversed the the brood combs

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.630 
lay and I reversed the the brood combs
in<00:01:31.240> the<00:01:31.330> hive<00:01:31.510> to<00:01:31.810> put<00:01:32.620> empty<00:01:32.800> coma<00:01:33.130> buffers<00:01:33.610> to

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
in the hive to put empty coma buffers to

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.590 
in the hive to put empty coma buffers to
see<00:01:34.000> if<00:01:34.090> I<00:01:34.180> couldn't<00:01:34.420> get<00:01:34.570> her<00:01:34.720> to<00:01:34.750> build<00:01:35.050> up

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
see if I couldn't get her to build up

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.800 
see if I couldn't get her to build up
nine<00:01:37.600> days<00:01:37.870> later<00:01:38.140> I<00:01:38.470> came<00:01:39.160> back<00:01:39.370> again<00:01:39.810> this

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
nine days later I came back again this

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.780 
nine days later I came back again this
time<00:01:41.080> I<00:01:41.290> took<00:01:41.410> a<00:01:41.680> frame<00:01:41.890> of<00:01:42.040> brood<00:01:42.280> away<00:01:42.520> from

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:42.790 
time I took a frame of brood away from

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:44.820 
time I took a frame of brood away from
this<00:01:42.970> one<00:01:43.180> and<00:01:43.360> this<00:01:44.050> one<00:01:44.260> had<00:01:44.410> built<00:01:44.650> up

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:44.830 
this one and this one had built up

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:46.530 
this one and this one had built up
enough<00:01:45.100> so<00:01:45.310> I<00:01:45.340> took<00:01:45.460> a<00:01:45.640> frame<00:01:45.940> of<00:01:46.120> brood<00:01:46.300> away

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:46.540 
enough so I took a frame of brood away

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.160 
enough so I took a frame of brood away
from<00:01:46.750> this<00:01:46.930> one<00:01:47.110> on<00:01:47.380> the<00:01:48.310> twenty<00:01:48.580> first<00:01:49.170> seven

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
from this one on the twenty first seven

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.500 
from this one on the twenty first seven
days<00:01:50.290> later<00:01:50.560> again<00:01:51.490> harvested<00:01:52.090> a<00:01:52.150> frame<00:01:52.360> of

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:52.510 
days later again harvested a frame of

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:56.940 
days later again harvested a frame of
brood<00:01:52.720> from<00:01:52.900> each<00:01:53.200> on<00:01:55.080> the<00:01:56.080> 10th<00:01:56.380> of<00:01:56.560> June

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
brood from each on the 10th of June

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.130 
brood from each on the 10th of June
I<00:01:57.190> took<00:01:57.610> now<00:01:58.300> they're<00:01:58.450> building<00:01:58.780> up<00:01:58.870> better

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
I took now they're building up better

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.290 
I took now they're building up better
this<00:01:59.890> is<00:02:00.070> early<00:02:00.340> in<00:02:00.430> the<00:02:00.520> season<00:02:00.730> now<00:02:01.090> they're

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:01.300 
this is early in the season now they're

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.300 
this is early in the season now they're
getting<00:02:01.450> into<00:02:01.840> the<00:02:01.990> to<00:02:02.409> the<00:02:02.530> main<00:02:02.680> honey<00:02:03.040> flow

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
getting into the to the main honey flow

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.330 
getting into the to the main honey flow
time<00:02:03.580> there's<00:02:04.420> plenty<00:02:04.780> of<00:02:04.840> resources<00:02:05.340> there's

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
time there's plenty of resources there's

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.369 
time there's plenty of resources there's
more<00:02:06.610> broody<00:02:07.120> merging<00:02:07.540> so<00:02:07.720> there's<00:02:07.930> more<00:02:08.140> bees

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:08.379 
more broody merging so there's more bees

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:10.109 
more broody merging so there's more bees
in<00:02:08.590> the<00:02:08.679> hive<00:02:08.709> so<00:02:09.159> they<00:02:09.310> can<00:02:09.519> support<00:02:09.909> more

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
in the hive so they can support more

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.390 
in the hive so they can support more
brood<00:02:10.450> I<00:02:10.690> was<00:02:11.140> able<00:02:11.290> to<00:02:11.440> take<00:02:11.709> two<00:02:11.920> frames<00:02:12.190> of

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
brood I was able to take two frames of

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.940 
brood I was able to take two frames of
brood<00:02:12.550> from<00:02:13.210> this<00:02:13.390> Newt<00:02:13.630> but<00:02:14.470> I<00:02:14.500> looked<00:02:14.800> at

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
brood from this Newt but I looked at

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.320 
brood from this Newt but I looked at
this<00:02:15.100> one<00:02:15.160> and<00:02:15.550> it<00:02:16.030> gosh<00:02:16.480> it<00:02:16.690> seemed<00:02:16.930> queenless

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
this one and it gosh it seemed queenless

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.380 
this one and it gosh it seemed queenless
so<00:02:19.330> 13<00:02:19.870> days<00:02:20.080> later<00:02:20.110> I<00:02:20.740> went<00:02:21.280> back<00:02:21.430> and<00:02:21.820> sure

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
so 13 days later I went back and sure

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.650 
so 13 days later I went back and sure
enough<00:02:22.450> they<00:02:23.200> had<00:02:23.350> emergency<00:02:23.680> cells<00:02:24.220> B<00:02:24.460> cells

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
enough they had emergency cells B cells

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.330 
enough they had emergency cells B cells
so<00:02:25.660> what<00:02:25.870> happened<00:02:26.290> here<00:02:27.810> what<00:02:28.810> happened<00:02:29.170> here

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
so what happened here what happened here

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.850 
so what happened here what happened here
sometime<00:02:30.340> it's<00:02:30.550> sometime<00:02:30.970> at<00:02:31.150> this<00:02:31.300> point

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
sometime it's sometime at this point

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.070 
sometime it's sometime at this point
this<00:02:32.860> colony<00:02:33.460> you<00:02:33.760> killed<00:02:34.390> their<00:02:34.570> queen

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
this colony you killed their queen

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.500 
this colony you killed their queen
I<00:02:35.340> don't<00:02:36.340> think<00:02:36.580> I<00:02:36.700> removed<00:02:37.120> the<00:02:37.270> Queen

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
I don't think I removed the Queen

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.350 
I don't think I removed the Queen
because<00:02:37.959> this<00:02:38.800> was<00:02:39.010> emergency<00:02:39.760> cells<00:02:40.030> on<00:02:40.240> the

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
because this was emergency cells on the

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.310 
because this was emergency cells on the
23rd<00:02:40.870> and<00:02:41.230> the<00:02:41.320> last<00:02:41.530> time<00:02:41.740> we<00:02:41.890> took<00:02:43.080> brood<00:02:44.080> was

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
23rd and the last time we took brood was

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.850 
23rd and the last time we took brood was
on<00:02:44.500> the<00:02:44.590> 21st<00:02:45.130> of<00:02:45.430> May<00:02:46.140> so<00:02:47.140> there's<00:02:47.500> too<00:02:47.740> many

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
on the 21st of May so there's too many

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.160 
on the 21st of May so there's too many
days<00:02:48.250> there<00:02:48.760> so<00:02:49.150> we<00:02:49.300> didn't<00:02:49.570> we<00:02:49.750> didn't<00:02:50.020> take

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
days there so we didn't we didn't take

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.190 
days there so we didn't we didn't take
the<00:02:50.350> Queen<00:02:50.560> by<00:02:50.739> mistake<00:02:51.100> she<00:02:51.400> just<00:02:52.209> died<00:02:53.170> or

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
the Queen by mistake she just died or

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.199 
the Queen by mistake she just died or
they<00:02:53.680> killed<00:02:53.950> her<00:02:54.070> or<00:02:54.310> some<00:02:54.520> for<00:02:54.700> some<00:02:54.880> reason

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
they killed her or some for some reason

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.300 
they killed her or some for some reason
they<00:02:55.330> lost<00:02:55.570> their<00:02:55.840> queen<00:02:56.050> there's<00:02:56.770> emergency

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
they lost their queen there's emergency

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:03.090 
they lost their queen there's emergency
cells<00:02:57.790> I<00:03:01.020> guess<00:03:02.020> I<00:03:02.140> let<00:03:02.380> the<00:03:02.560> Queen<00:03:02.800> cells

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
cells I guess I let the Queen cells

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.530 
cells I guess I let the Queen cells
hatch<00:03:03.400> and<00:03:03.730> it<00:03:04.180> became<00:03:04.420> a<00:03:04.480> drone<00:03:04.840> laying<00:03:05.200> queen

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
hatch and it became a drone laying queen

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.470 
hatch and it became a drone laying queen
so<00:03:08.130> that<00:03:09.130> was<00:03:09.340> on<00:03:09.489> the<00:03:09.610> 9th<00:03:09.880> of<00:03:10.090> July<00:03:10.450> I

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
so that was on the 9th of July I

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.479 
so that was on the 9th of July I
discovered<00:03:11.260> that<00:03:11.410> they<00:03:11.560> were<00:03:11.590> it<00:03:12.040> was<00:03:12.160> a<00:03:12.190> draw

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
discovered that they were it was a draw

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:15.900 
discovered that they were it was a draw
layer<00:03:13.230> so<00:03:14.230> I<00:03:14.260> came<00:03:14.680> back<00:03:14.860> here<00:03:15.130> on<00:03:15.250> the<00:03:15.370> 21st

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
layer so I came back here on the 21st

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.910 
layer so I came back here on the 21st
and<00:03:16.950> and<00:03:17.950> I<00:03:18.520> shook<00:03:18.850> out<00:03:19.120> the<00:03:19.450> the<00:03:19.930> bees<00:03:20.230> on<00:03:20.530> the

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
and and I shook out the the bees on the

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.729 
and and I shook out the the bees on the
ground<00:03:21.220> and<00:03:21.489> I<00:03:22.150> gave<00:03:22.420> them<00:03:22.630> a<00:03:22.750> nucleus<00:03:23.230> colony

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739 
ground and I gave them a nucleus colony

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:27.570 
ground and I gave them a nucleus colony
I<00:03:24.810> killed<00:03:25.900> I<00:03:25.989> killed<00:03:26.380> the<00:03:26.650> drone<00:03:26.920> laying<00:03:27.340> Queen

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:27.580 
I killed I killed the drone laying Queen

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:31.110 
I killed I killed the drone laying Queen
K<00:03:27.910> dlq<00:03:28.799> killed<00:03:29.799> the<00:03:29.980> drone<00:03:30.220> laying<00:03:30.489> queen<00:03:30.850> and

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
K dlq killed the drone laying queen and

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.780 
K dlq killed the drone laying queen and
he<00:03:31.570> United<00:03:32.110> it<00:03:32.260> with<00:03:32.500> a<00:03:32.530> nucleus<00:03:33.100> colony<00:03:33.580> that

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
he United it with a nucleus colony that

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:35.910 
he United it with a nucleus colony that
has<00:03:33.970> a<00:03:34.000> breeder<00:03:34.450> queen<00:03:35.320> a<00:03:35.350> daughter<00:03:35.799> of

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 
has a breeder queen a daughter of

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:43.500 
has a breeder queen a daughter of
breeder<00:03:36.959> 46<00:03:40.799> four<00:03:41.799> days<00:03:41.980> later<00:03:42.310> I<00:03:42.640> added

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
breeder 46 four days later I added

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:47.220 
breeder 46 four days later I added
nucleus<00:03:44.049> collie<00:03:44.350> and<00:03:45.239> that<00:03:46.239> nucleus<00:03:46.720> colony

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
nucleus collie and that nucleus colony

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:48.680 
nucleus collie and that nucleus colony
must<00:03:47.440> have<00:03:47.560> been<00:03:47.680> real<00:03:47.860> strong

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
must have been real strong

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.840 
must have been real strong
it<00:03:49.690> was<00:03:49.870> probably<00:03:50.290> in<00:03:50.590> a<00:03:50.709> single<00:03:51.130> head<00:03:51.610> nine

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:51.850 
it was probably in a single head nine

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:54.449 
it was probably in a single head nine
columns<00:03:52.299> and<00:03:52.650> I<00:03:53.650> thought<00:03:53.920> there<00:03:54.100> was<00:03:54.190> too<00:03:54.340> many

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:54.459 
columns and I thought there was too many

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:57.300 
columns and I thought there was too many
frames<00:03:54.820> of<00:03:55.000> brood<00:03:55.150> in<00:03:55.420> it<00:03:55.570> so<00:03:56.260> on<00:03:56.440> the<00:03:56.530> 25th<00:03:57.100> I

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
frames of brood in it so on the 25th I

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.100 
frames of brood in it so on the 25th I
took<00:03:57.489> away<00:03:57.640> two<00:03:57.760> frames<00:03:58.239> of<00:03:58.450> brood<00:03:58.540> in<00:03:58.810> a<00:03:58.870> frame

00:03:59.100 --> 00:03:59.110 
took away two frames of brood in a frame

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:01.830 
took away two frames of brood in a frame
of<00:03:59.140> honey<00:03:59.410> and<00:03:59.739> they<00:04:00.190> gave<00:04:00.370> it<00:04:00.400> Foundation<00:04:01.120> to

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
of honey and they gave it Foundation to

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.729 
of honey and they gave it Foundation to
draw<00:04:02.049> out<00:04:03.390> then<00:04:04.390> on<00:04:04.540> the<00:04:04.630> 15th<00:04:05.110> I<00:04:05.260> wasn't<00:04:05.590> happy

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:05.739 
draw out then on the 15th I wasn't happy

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:08.130 
draw out then on the 15th I wasn't happy
with<00:04:05.890> what<00:04:06.280> they<00:04:06.430> had<00:04:06.579> done<00:04:06.840> possibly<00:04:07.840> I<00:04:07.870> took

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:08.140 
with what they had done possibly I took

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:09.720 
with what they had done possibly I took
too<00:04:08.290> much<00:04:08.440> brood<00:04:08.739> away<00:04:08.980> so<00:04:09.160> I<00:04:09.190> gave<00:04:09.430> them<00:04:09.610> back

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730 
too much brood away so I gave them back

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:11.250 
too much brood away so I gave them back
a<00:04:09.790> frame<00:04:10.120> of<00:04:10.299> brood<00:04:10.510> and<00:04:10.690> a<00:04:10.750> couple<00:04:10.930> of<00:04:11.049> combs

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.260 
a frame of brood and a couple of combs

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:12.990 
a frame of brood and a couple of combs
which<00:04:11.950> means<00:04:12.190> they<00:04:12.310> weren't<00:04:12.459> drawing<00:04:12.820> their

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
which means they weren't drawing their

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.110 
which means they weren't drawing their
foundation<00:04:13.570> out<00:04:13.720> and<00:04:14.430> then<00:04:15.430> I<00:04:15.459> looked<00:04:15.820> at<00:04:15.970> them

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.120 
foundation out and then I looked at them

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.780 
foundation out and then I looked at them
on<00:04:16.239> the<00:04:16.359> 29th<00:04:16.840> of<00:04:17.079> August<00:04:17.560> and<00:04:17.739> they<00:04:17.950> were<00:04:18.010> just

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:18.790 
on the 29th of August and they were just

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:21.479 
on the 29th of August and they were just
about<00:04:19.000> perfect<00:04:19.450> they<00:04:19.600> had<00:04:19.859> they<00:04:20.859> had<00:04:21.040> plenty

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
about perfect they had they had plenty

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:24.060 
about perfect they had they had plenty
of<00:04:21.640> frames<00:04:21.940> of<00:04:22.150> brood<00:04:22.270> for<00:04:22.570> a<00:04:22.630> winter<00:04:22.900> and<00:04:23.080> they

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070 
of frames of brood for a winter and they
