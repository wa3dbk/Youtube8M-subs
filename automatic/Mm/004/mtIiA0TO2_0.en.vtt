going<00:01:49.399> in<00:01:49.520> taking<00:01:49.850> a<00:01:49.880> few<00:01:50.090> hours<00:01:50.119> if<00:01:50.570> I<00:01:50.750> work

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:50.899 
going in taking a few hours if I work

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:53.289 
going in taking a few hours if I work
hard<00:01:50.929> on<00:01:51.289> it<00:01:51.759> whereas<00:01:52.759> with<00:01:52.789> some<00:01:53.149> of<00:01:53.210> the

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:53.299 
hard on it whereas with some of the

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:55.749 
hard on it whereas with some of the
other<00:01:53.359> ships<00:01:53.750> I<00:01:54.039> think<00:01:55.039> the<00:01:55.250> silver<00:01:55.609> one<00:01:55.729> is

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759

other ships I think the silver one is
going<00:01:55.880> to<00:01:55.969> be<00:01:56.060> the<00:01:56.149> other<00:01:56.270> one<00:01:56.390> that's<00:01:56.509> going

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630

essentially<00:02:06.170> this<00:02:06.289> is<00:02:06.350> pretty<00:02:06.950> much<00:02:07.009> gonna<00:02:07.219> be

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
essentially this is pretty much gonna be

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:08.889 
essentially this is pretty much gonna be
a<00:02:07.399> big<00:02:07.640> test<00:02:07.850> of<00:02:08.030> our<00:02:08.149> endurance<00:02:08.509> building

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
a big test of our endurance building

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.020 
a big test of our endurance building
skills<00:02:09.140> I'm<00:02:10.100> gonna<00:02:10.250> be<00:02:10.340> working<00:02:10.550> around<00:02:10.820> the

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
skills I'm gonna be working around the

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.150 
skills I'm gonna be working around the
clock<00:02:11.090> to<00:02:11.270> get<00:02:11.780> these<00:02:11.930> ships<00:02:12.140> done<00:02:12.380> in<00:02:12.680> ASAP

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
clock to get these ships done in ASAP

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.680 
clock to get these ships done in ASAP
and<00:02:13.640> it's<00:02:13.760> actually<00:02:14.000> gonna<00:02:14.090> be<00:02:14.150> a<00:02:14.240> lot<00:02:14.450> of<00:02:14.510> fun

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
and it's actually gonna be a lot of fun

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:15.910 
and it's actually gonna be a lot of fun
or<00:02:14.840> hopefully<00:02:15.110> get<00:02:15.230> them<00:02:15.319> all<00:02:15.500> out<00:02:15.770> and

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
or hopefully get them all out and

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.860 
or hopefully get them all out and
stimuli<00:02:16.700> cool<00:02:16.880> to<00:02:16.970> see<00:02:17.120> them<00:02:17.180> all<00:02:17.360> sudden

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
stimuli cool to see them all sudden

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.110 
stimuli cool to see them all sudden
you're<00:02:17.960> done<00:02:18.130> pretty<00:02:19.130> much<00:02:19.220> it<00:02:19.400> took<00:02:19.580> mr.

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
you're done pretty much it took mr.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.150 
you're done pretty much it took mr.
ships<00:02:20.330> I<00:02:20.450> really<00:02:20.660> like<00:02:20.840> slap<00:02:21.590> them<00:02:21.740> on<00:02:21.830> a<00:02:21.890> list

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
ships I really like slap them on a list

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.880 
ships I really like slap them on a list
and<00:02:22.340> the<00:02:22.460> way<00:02:22.730> I<00:02:22.760> go<00:02:23.030> um<00:02:23.540> the<00:02:24.380> only<00:02:24.440> one<00:02:24.680> is<00:02:24.770> the

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
and the way I go um the only one is the

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.080 
and the way I go um the only one is the
counter<00:02:25.100> trip<00:02:25.340> I'm<00:02:25.460> going<00:02:25.550> to<00:02:25.610> be<00:02:25.730> working<00:02:25.819> on

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
counter trip I'm going to be working on

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:27.580 
counter trip I'm going to be working on
I<00:02:26.270> don't<00:02:26.600> think<00:02:26.690> that<00:02:26.930> one's<00:02:27.140> actually<00:02:27.319> might

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
I don't think that one's actually might

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.470 
I don't think that one's actually might
not<00:02:27.770> get<00:02:27.920> done<00:02:28.069> in<00:02:28.190> the<00:02:28.280> 10<00:02:28.490> days<00:02:28.670> but<00:02:29.240> I'm

that we're working on it so as soon as

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.309 
that we're working on it so as soon as
we<00:02:32.330> start<00:02:32.540> that<00:02:32.690> ship<00:02:32.870> you're<00:02:33.050> gonna<00:02:33.140> know

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:33.319

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:36.370 
we start that ship you're gonna know
what<00:02:33.440> it<00:02:33.590> is<00:02:33.710> so<00:02:33.950> but<00:02:34.490> for<00:02:34.700> now<00:02:34.819> we<00:02:34.880> decided<00:02:35.480> not

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
what it is so but for now we decided not

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.410 
what it is so but for now we decided not
and<00:02:36.590> someone<00:02:37.160> has<00:02:37.310> gone<00:02:37.550> ahead<00:02:37.700> and<00:02:37.850> modified

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
and someone has gone ahead and modified

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:39.940 
and someone has gone ahead and modified
the<00:02:38.540> back<00:02:38.720> of<00:02:38.870> the<00:02:38.960> ship<00:02:39.200> which<00:02:39.410> I<00:02:39.530> told<00:02:39.800> them

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
the back of the ship which I told them

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.030 
the back of the ship which I told them
not<00:02:40.160> to<00:02:40.460> because<00:02:40.750> the<00:02:41.750> marina<00:02:42.410> is<00:02:42.680> actually

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
not to because the marina is actually

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.930 
not to because the marina is actually
attached<00:02:43.580> would<00:02:44.360> be<00:02:44.830> the<00:02:45.830> docking<00:02:46.310> bay<00:02:46.340> not

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
attached would be the docking bay not

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.390 
attached would be the docking bay not
there's<00:02:47.690> not<00:02:47.870> stick<00:02:48.320> out<00:02:48.470> like<00:02:48.500> this<00:02:48.980> though

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
there's not stick out like this though

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.740 
there's not stick out like this though
it's<00:02:49.610> retarded<00:02:50.300> so<00:02:52.270> I'm<00:02:53.270> just<00:02:53.420> going<00:02:53.540> to<00:02:53.600> rip

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
it's retarded so I'm just going to rip

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.420 
it's retarded so I'm just going to rip
that<00:02:53.900> off<00:02:53.960> Oh<00:02:54.200> focus<00:02:54.770> on<00:02:54.890> that<00:02:54.920> while<00:02:55.160> I'm<00:02:55.250> not

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
feeling um I think that's about it if
