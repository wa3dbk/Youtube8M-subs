00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.940
 today we want to invite you to 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:10.180
 visit under your feet is very interesting 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:13.289
 swamp called she posts ryazhskaya 

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:15.379
 in honor of the village who was tonsured 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:17.679
 By the way, nowhere 

00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:19.210
 the swamp is located in the center 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:21.109
 Berezinsky reserve 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:22.960
 in an absolutely protected area 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.780
 three decades ago 

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:27.259
 near the marsh there were several residential buildings 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:28.789
 but when scanning a territory 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:31.789
 Reserve their inhabitants moved 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.700
 the color mining the division of the whole to 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.870
 stored territory into zones 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.090
 reserves she got off in order 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:42.370
 to highlight 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:44.199
 most value point of view 

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:46.180
 biodiversity plots 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.800
 of nature 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.180
 the village got into the thigh that is the zone 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:50.859
 absolute reserve 

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:53.140
 and people had to leave here 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:54.179
 agree 

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:57.370
 not so often on our why the eternal planet 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.450
 people than those sacrifices to nature 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:02.870
 lived better 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:04.870
 Berezinsky reserve is 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:08.400
 whether Russia is already an international title 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.930
 which means the importance of conservation 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.760
 this format for the entire planet 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.610
 you can't hunt here 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.390
 chop trees mow grass pick berries 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:18.400
 and mushrooms 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.590
 imagine how unusual 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:21.180
 lot 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.430
 in such 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.960
 the marsh on which is very close 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.050
 people 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.390
 we came here today for the first 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.360
 queue to build 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.189
 ad hoc committee 

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:35.090
 where for their spring tournaments 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.139
 going to children either first observations 

00:01:38.139 --> 00:01:39.140
 grouse 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.469
 there were held 15 years ago 

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:42.439
 with time 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:44.499
 vegetation in the swamp is changing and 

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:47.090
 grouse very sensitive to these 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:48.120
 changes 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.100
 they need firstly an open place to 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.400
 predators invisible crept up and in 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.490
 the second must be strong comfortable kidneys 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.890
 a place where you can with pleasure 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.890
 to dance 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:07.749
 changing vegetation 

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:10.640
 there are new trees go livane 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.260
 slightly shifts your and improvise on 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.469
 wall in the swamp lobe 

00:02:15.469 --> 00:02:18.089
 so we have to move 

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:21.089
 our ride after them 

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:33.489
 in the center of the voice is an unusual device 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:35.709
 called it you guessed it the same way 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:37.949
 like swamp mow skype 

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:40.589
 this lake is the remnant of that historic 

00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:41.379
 reservoir 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:42.969
 which formed after melting 

00:02:42.969 --> 00:02:45.969
 last glacier 10 thousand years ago 

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:50.139
 when there he was huge 

00:02:50.139 --> 00:02:52.909
 tens of square kilometers now 

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:54.539
 most increased 

00:02:54.539 --> 00:02:56.909
 turned into six months 

00:02:56.909 --> 00:02:59.040
 but here with this mirror as 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.269
 grand witness 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:02.389
 historical processes in nature 

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:04.079
 the scale here like to relax 

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:07.089
 Yakutsk traveling in spring 

00:03:11.469 --> 00:03:14.219
 Encryption meetings awaited here 

00:03:14.219 --> 00:03:16.079
 and we kept 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:17.300
 lingered 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.300
 and did not regret 

00:03:21.619 --> 00:03:23.709
 why is it beautiful in the evening 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:26.709
 on the post of speech is silent 

00:04:02.559 --> 00:04:04.699
 by loud flapping wings you can 

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:05.889
 define 

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:07.869
 these numbers have already arrived 

00:04:07.869 --> 00:04:09.649
 It remains to look forward 

00:04:09.649 --> 00:04:10.650
 when dawn 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.209
 from the asset amount it will be possible 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:15.209
 watch 

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:18.469
 in the swamp post in Riga one of the most 

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:21.159
 big that's going here before 

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:23.979
 thirty males them by the way like ours 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:27.319
 poultry plant in rooster 

00:04:27.319 --> 00:04:29.729
 In addition, it is one of the few large 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:30.590
 such is 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.590
 in 10 Yerevan attacks the place of its swamp 

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:38.939
 most often in our time they can 

00:04:38.939 --> 00:04:39.990
 meet in the meadows 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:42.139
 fields of drained peatlands 

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:44.460
 so as if in a time machine 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:45.650
 stay 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:47.460
 because just like today 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:50.460
 going to do business hundreds of years ago 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:58.449
 singing individual males can be heard 

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:00.490
 already in March but the maximum 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:02.870
 the activity of the couch is the end of april at 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:03.930
 early may 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:06.070
 every male is she strictly 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:08.090
 a particular area with the most 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:10.990
 experienced and strong fighters takes place 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:13.069
 nearest dwelling 

00:05:13.069 --> 00:05:15.139
 young people go to the outskirts 

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:18.139
 and grief cordoned off 2 6 border 

00:05:43.099 --> 00:05:44.910
 remind you that reading 

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:45.780
 polygamous 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:48.120
 standing guy forms a male 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:49.630
 hatching and nursing 

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:51.550
 offspring does not participate 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:54.029
 just on the shoulders of females 

00:05:54.029 --> 00:05:55.710
 they are smaller than males 

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:57.840
 and much more modest in coloring plumage 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.370
 appears on such with the first rays of the sun 

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:04.400
 now all the fuse and excitement of Petrak only 

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.400
 for them 

00:06:09.779 --> 00:06:12.929
 by the way the distribution of the birds of the protocol then 

00:06:12.929 --> 00:06:14.889
 experienced and strong in the center of a young 

00:06:14.889 --> 00:06:17.409
 edged has a great biological meaning 

00:06:17.409 --> 00:06:18.430
 First of all 

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:20.520
 the tractor itself immediately to the center of the tubes 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:22.100
 so chances to get 

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:25.100
 more offspring of those who are in the center 

00:06:30.449 --> 00:06:31.349
 and then 

00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:32.909
 they spend strength on permanent 

00:06:32.909 --> 00:06:35.699
 observation 

00:06:35.699 --> 00:06:37.819
 predator if he appears here 

00:06:37.819 --> 00:06:40.819
 will drag off more pencil edges 

00:06:42.389 --> 00:06:44.219
 Kiseleva greatly affected by 

00:06:44.219 --> 00:06:46.229
 land reclamation and field application 

00:06:46.229 --> 00:06:47.349
 toxic chemicals 

00:06:47.349 --> 00:06:50.199
 critical situation is improving 

00:06:50.199 --> 00:06:53.339
 so if you know this situation 

00:06:53.339 --> 00:06:55.959
 try to make it so that third place 

00:06:55.959 --> 00:06:56.719
 will remain
