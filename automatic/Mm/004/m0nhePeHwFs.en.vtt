00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:03.899 
g'day all welcome to my first tutorial

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.970 
g'day all welcome to my first tutorial
on<00:00:04.730> cooter<00:00:06.170> yeah<00:00:07.170> this<00:00:07.500> is<00:00:07.649> one<00:00:07.799> of<00:00:07.830> my

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
on cooter yeah this is one of my

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.770 
on cooter yeah this is one of my
favorite<00:00:08.460> topics<00:00:08.580> really<00:00:08.970> it's<00:00:09.210> very<00:00:09.450> very

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
favorite topics really it's very very

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.610 
favorite topics really it's very very
interesting<00:00:09.960> and<00:00:10.550> really<00:00:11.550> powerful<00:00:12.030> too<00:00:12.210> so

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:12.620 
interesting and really powerful too so

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.490 
interesting and really powerful too so
CUDA<00:00:13.620> is<00:00:13.820> GPGPU<00:00:14.820> with<00:00:15.179> Nvidia<00:00:15.780> graphics<00:00:15.929> cards

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
CUDA is GPGPU with Nvidia graphics cards

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.470 
CUDA is GPGPU with Nvidia graphics cards
and<00:00:16.650> it's<00:00:17.130> short<00:00:17.279> for<00:00:17.400> compute<00:00:17.910> unified

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
and it's short for compute unified

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:25.099 
and it's short for compute unified
device<00:00:18.990> architecture<00:00:20.779> hey<00:00:21.779> Gogi<00:00:23.930> GPGPU<00:00:24.930> is

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
device architecture hey Gogi GPGPU is

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.560 
device architecture hey Gogi GPGPU is
the<00:00:25.260> process<00:00:25.680> of<00:00:25.830> using<00:00:25.890> a<00:00:26.310> graphics<00:00:27.180> card<00:00:27.449> for

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
the process of using a graphics card for

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.670 
the process of using a graphics card for
non<00:00:27.930> graphics<00:00:28.410> processing<00:00:28.859> so<00:00:31.130> good<00:00:32.130> boy

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:33.680

tutorial<00:00:40.290> series<00:00:40.559> is<00:00:40.829> probably<00:00:41.100> going<00:00:41.219> to

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
tutorial series is probably going to

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.380 
tutorial series is probably going to
help<00:00:41.489> if<00:00:41.640> you<00:00:41.730> know<00:00:41.850> a<00:00:41.879> bit<00:00:42.090> of<00:00:42.120> C++<00:00:44.149> yeah<00:00:45.149> we're

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
help if you know a bit of C++ yeah we're

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.090 
help if you know a bit of C++ yeah we're
going<00:00:45.539> to<00:00:45.570> sort<00:00:45.780> of<00:00:45.870> skip<00:00:46.079> over<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.440> c++<00:00:47.070> and

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
going to sort of skip over the c++ and

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.310 
going to sort of skip over the c++ and
mostly<00:00:47.520> just<00:00:47.730> talk<00:00:47.879> about<00:00:48.120> Curtis<00:00:48.510> stuff<00:00:48.719> so<00:00:49.020> I

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
mostly just talk about Curtis stuff so I

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.910 
mostly just talk about Curtis stuff so I
will<00:00:50.100> be<00:00:50.190> using<00:00:50.340> a<00:00:50.579> C++<00:00:51.210> IDE<00:00:51.690> though<00:00:52.079> Visual

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
will be using a C++ IDE though Visual

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.810 
will be using a C++ IDE though Visual
Studio<00:00:54.530> if<00:00:55.530> you<00:00:55.770> like<00:00:55.949> to<00:00:56.190> if<00:00:56.399> you'd<00:00:56.520> like<00:00:56.640> to

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
Studio if you like to if you'd like to

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.160 
Studio if you like to if you'd like to
follow<00:00:56.969> along<00:00:57.300> and<00:00:57.480> use<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.719> same<00:00:57.899> software

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
follow along and use the same software

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.450 
follow along and use the same software
I'm<00:00:58.350> using<00:00:58.379> you<00:00:59.370> probably<00:00:59.640> know<00:00:59.760> me<00:00:59.940> by<00:01:00.090> now<00:01:00.379> I

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
I'm using you probably know me by now I

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:08.179 
I'm using you probably know me by now I
use<00:01:02.460> Visual<00:01:02.820> C++<00:01:03.059> Express<00:01:03.780> 2010<00:01:04.710> and<00:01:06.920> you<00:01:07.920> can

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
use Visual C++ Express 2010 and you can

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.910 
use Visual C++ Express 2010 and you can
you<00:01:08.549> can<00:01:08.729> use<00:01:08.939> Linux<00:01:09.570> and<00:01:09.869> Eclipse<00:01:10.409> I<00:01:10.560> think<00:01:10.770> if

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
you can use Linux and Eclipse I think if

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.240 
you can use Linux and Eclipse I think if
you<00:01:11.070> like<00:01:11.220> you<00:01:12.090> might<00:01:12.210> be<00:01:12.270> able<00:01:12.390> to<00:01:12.510> get<00:01:12.659> the

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 
you like you might be able to get the

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.620 
you like you might be able to get the
same<00:01:14.250> thing<00:01:14.520> for<00:01:14.670> windows<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:15.060> eclipse<00:01:15.479> if

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
same thing for windows and eclipse if

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.960 
same thing for windows and eclipse if
you're<00:01:15.750> not<00:01:15.869> a<00:01:15.900> fan<00:01:16.110> of<00:01:16.140> Visual<00:01:16.500> Studio<00:01:16.970> but

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
you're not a fan of Visual Studio but

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.260 
you're not a fan of Visual Studio but
I'll<00:01:18.270> be<00:01:18.390> using<00:01:18.500> Visual<00:01:19.500> C++<00:01:19.710> 2010<00:01:20.310> Express<00:01:20.880> if

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
I'll be using Visual C++ 2010 Express if

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.300 
I'll be using Visual C++ 2010 Express if
you've<00:01:21.390> got<00:01:21.600> Windows<00:01:21.930> 8<00:01:22.140> you<00:01:22.979> might<00:01:23.100> like<00:01:23.280> to

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
you've got Windows 8 you might like to

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.719 
you've got Windows 8 you might like to
try<00:01:23.520> Visual<00:01:23.939> C++<00:01:24.119> 2012<00:01:25.280> yeah<00:01:26.280> I<00:01:26.340> think<00:01:26.460> it's

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
try Visual C++ 2012 yeah I think it's

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.490 
try Visual C++ 2012 yeah I think it's
going<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:26.909> be<00:01:27.030> mostly<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.509> same<00:01:27.750> you<00:01:27.990> probably

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
going to be mostly the same you probably

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.760 
going to be mostly the same you probably
can<00:01:28.650> follow<00:01:28.860> along<00:01:29.009> with<00:01:29.220> that<00:01:30.500> ok<00:01:31.500> so<00:01:31.560> the

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
can follow along with that ok so the

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.830 
can follow along with that ok so the
code<00:01:32.009> is<00:01:32.159> only<00:01:32.400> available<00:01:32.579> on<00:01:33.030> newer<00:01:33.329> Nvidia

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
code is only available on newer Nvidia

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.679 
code is only available on newer Nvidia
graphics<00:01:33.990> cards<00:01:34.610> actually<00:01:35.610> from<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.909> 8000

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
graphics cards actually from the 8000

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.350 
graphics cards actually from the 8000
series<00:01:36.869> onwards<00:01:37.470> so<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:38.189> 8000<00:01:38.850> series<00:01:39.030> the

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
series onwards so the 8000 series the

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.789 
series onwards so the 8000 series the
9000<00:01:40.020> series<00:01:40.170> and<00:01:40.560> then<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:41.159> 200<00:01:41.670> and<00:01:41.790> above

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:42.799 
9000 series and then the 200 and above

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:46.280 
9000 series and then the 200 and above
yeah<00:01:43.799> otherwise<00:01:44.720> you<00:01:45.720> know<00:01:45.810> they<00:01:45.930> didn't<00:01:46.170> have

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
yeah otherwise you know they didn't have

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.170 
yeah otherwise you know they didn't have
cooter<00:01:46.680> on<00:01:46.799> their<00:01:47.119> 7000<00:01:48.119> and<00:01:48.240> before<00:01:48.479> that<00:01:50.180> ok

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
cooter on their 7000 and before that ok

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.850 
cooter on their 7000 and before that ok
so<00:01:51.240> just<00:01:51.390> a<00:01:51.630> little<00:01:51.840> introduction<00:01:52.229> to<00:01:52.409> it<00:01:52.619> to<00:01:52.829> a

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
so just a little introduction to it to a

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.649 
so just a little introduction to it to a
graphics<00:01:53.369> card<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.939> graphics<00:01:54.270> card<00:01:54.509> is

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
graphics card the graphics card is

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.120 
graphics card the graphics card is
designed<00:01:55.049> to<00:01:55.229> efficiently<00:01:55.619> perform<00:01:56.009> the

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
designed to efficiently perform the

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.980 
designed to efficiently perform the
kinds<00:01:56.490> of<00:01:56.549> calculations<00:01:56.759> required<00:01:57.479> for<00:01:57.659> 3d

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
kinds of calculations required for 3d

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.459 
kinds of calculations required for 3d
graphics<00:01:59.149> yeah<00:02:00.149> so<00:02:00.420> they're<00:02:00.570> mostly<00:02:00.810> simple

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
graphics yeah so they're mostly simple

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:05.690 
graphics yeah so they're mostly simple
calculations<00:02:03.619> but<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:04.829> thing<00:02:05.100> about<00:02:05.399> it<00:02:05.579> is

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
calculations but the thing about it is

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.779 
calculations but the thing about it is
that<00:02:05.939> there's<00:02:06.149> a<00:02:06.210> lot<00:02:06.750> of<00:02:06.780> them<00:02:07.170> so<00:02:07.560> if<00:02:08.280> you're

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
that there's a lot of them so if you're

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.040 
that there's a lot of them so if you're
playing<00:02:09.030> a<00:02:09.800> video<00:02:10.800> game<00:02:10.860> and<00:02:11.599> it's<00:02:12.599> updating

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
playing a video game and it's updating

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.910 
playing a video game and it's updating
at<00:02:13.140> 60<00:02:13.500> frames

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
at 60 frames

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.650 
at 60 frames
second<00:02:14.280> and<00:02:14.430> it's<00:02:14.520> sort<00:02:14.819> of<00:02:14.849> you<00:02:15.630> know

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
second and it's sort of you know

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.210 
second and it's sort of you know
rendering<00:02:16.140> a<00:02:16.230> 3d<00:02:16.560> environment<00:02:16.680> that's

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220

every<00:02:19.500> single<00:02:19.860> frame<00:02:20.099> and<00:02:20.370> it<00:02:20.459> doesn't<00:02:20.790> skip<00:02:21.000> a

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
every single frame and it doesn't skip a

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
beat like these things absolutely fly if

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.780 
beat like these things absolutely fly if
you've<00:02:25.319> got<00:02:25.530> onboard<00:02:25.709> graphics<00:02:26.220> then<00:02:26.640> you're

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
you've got onboard graphics then you're

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.820 
you've got onboard graphics then you're
using<00:02:26.940> a<00:02:27.150> CPU<00:02:27.690> to<00:02:27.900> try<00:02:28.080> and<00:02:28.170> get<00:02:28.290> that<00:02:28.410> 60

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
frames per second you'll see just how

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:35.449

fast a dedicated graphics card is in

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:41.420 
fast a dedicated graphics card is in
comparison<00:02:38.720> yeah<00:02:39.720> so<00:02:39.989> as<00:02:40.110> well<00:02:40.319> as<00:02:40.430> there

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
comparison yeah so as well as there

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.660 
comparison yeah so as well as there
being<00:02:41.610> a<00:02:41.819> lot<00:02:42.060> of<00:02:42.300> these<00:02:42.569> calculations<00:02:43.200> in<00:02:43.739> 3d

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
being a lot of these calculations in 3d

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.470 
being a lot of these calculations in 3d
graphics<00:02:45.709> the<00:02:46.709> same<00:02:47.069> calculation<00:02:47.880> is<00:02:48.060> applied

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
graphics the same calculation is applied

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.640 
graphics the same calculation is applied

to many different data elements sort of

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.220 
to many different data elements sort of
in<00:02:52.769> a<00:02:52.860> similar<00:02:53.040> way<00:02:53.220> to<00:02:53.370> sim<00:02:53.790> D<00:02:54.049> you've<00:02:55.049> often

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
in a similar way to sim D you've often

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.960 
in a similar way to sim D you've often
got<00:02:55.530> to<00:02:55.620> perform<00:02:55.890> exactly<00:02:56.100> the<00:02:56.459> same<00:02:56.580> or

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
got to perform exactly the same or

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.449 
got to perform exactly the same or
almost<00:02:57.420> exactly<00:02:58.080> the<00:02:58.260> same<00:02:58.290> calculation<00:02:58.830> on

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
almost exactly the same calculation on

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.820 
almost exactly the same calculation on
you<00:03:00.299> know<00:03:00.420> hundreds<00:03:00.900> of<00:03:01.049> different<00:03:01.650> data

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
you know hundreds of different data

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.199 
you know hundreds of different data
items<00:03:01.980> or<00:03:02.310> thousands<00:03:02.760> of<00:03:02.790> different<00:03:03.090> data

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
items or thousands of different data

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.000 
items or thousands of different data
items<00:03:03.569> so<00:03:04.350> it<00:03:04.410> might<00:03:04.590> be<00:03:04.709> the<00:03:04.830> same

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
items so it might be the same

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.800 
items so it might be the same
calculation<00:03:05.730> for<00:03:05.760> every<00:03:06.209> pixel<00:03:06.450> on<00:03:06.780> the

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
screen or maybe you're talking about you

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.080 
screen or maybe you're talking about you
know<00:03:09.870> thousands<00:03:10.350> of<00:03:10.470> vertexes<00:03:11.160> in<00:03:11.340> a<00:03:11.430> 3d<00:03:11.790> world

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
know thousands of vertexes in a 3d world

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.309 
know thousands of vertexes in a 3d world
and<00:03:12.330> you've<00:03:12.480> got<00:03:12.600> to<00:03:12.690> perform<00:03:12.930> the<00:03:13.080> same

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 
and you've got to perform the same

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:15.710 
and you've got to perform the same
rotation<00:03:13.980> on<00:03:14.130> those<00:03:14.430> vertexes<00:03:15.120> in<00:03:15.330> order<00:03:15.600> to

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
rotation on those vertexes in order to

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.449 
rotation on those vertexes in order to
make<00:03:15.870> the<00:03:16.019> scene<00:03:16.260> sort<00:03:16.650> of<00:03:16.709> appear<00:03:17.190> as<00:03:17.340> though

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
make the scene sort of appear as though

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.270 
make the scene sort of appear as though
it's<00:03:17.489> rotating<00:03:18.180> when<00:03:18.269> you<00:03:18.390> move<00:03:18.540> your<00:03:19.280> camera

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
it's rotating when you move your camera

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.110 
it's rotating when you move your camera
around<00:03:21.769> but<00:03:22.769> the<00:03:22.890> GPU<00:03:23.340> is<00:03:23.489> designed<00:03:23.880> to<00:03:24.030> do

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
around but the GPU is designed to do

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.690 
around but the GPU is designed to do
exactly<00:03:24.150> this<00:03:24.840> perform<00:03:25.410> a<00:03:25.650> lot<00:03:26.549> of

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
exactly this perform a lot of

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.640 
exactly this perform a lot of
calculations<00:03:27.390> that<00:03:27.480> are<00:03:27.690> all<00:03:27.930> very<00:03:28.320> similar

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
calculations that are all very similar

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.630 
calculations that are all very similar
and<00:03:29.010> it<00:03:30.000> does<00:03:30.269> it<00:03:30.470> extremely<00:03:31.470> quickly<00:03:31.709> so

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
and it does it extremely quickly so

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:33.460 
and it does it extremely quickly so
that's<00:03:32.820> what<00:03:33.000> it's<00:03:33.120> for

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
that's what it's for

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.650 
that's what it's for
and<00:03:34.850> courtesy<00:03:35.850> is<00:03:36.030> what<00:03:36.239> we're<00:03:36.359> going<00:03:36.480> to<00:03:36.510> be

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
and courtesy is what we're going to be

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.650 
and courtesy is what we're going to be
concentrating<00:03:36.810> on<00:03:38.150> there's<00:03:39.150> many<00:03:39.450> different

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
concentrating on there's many different

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.840 
concentrating on there's many different
branches<00:03:40.320> of<00:03:40.350> CUDA<00:03:40.859> and<00:03:40.890> different<00:03:41.370> libraries

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
branches of CUDA and different libraries

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:42.979 
branches of CUDA and different libraries
and<00:03:42.000> things<00:03:42.090> that<00:03:42.239> people<00:03:42.329> have<00:03:42.630> built<00:03:42.810> you

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
and things that people have built you

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:47.150 
and things that people have built you
can<00:03:43.109> get<00:03:43.519> PI<00:03:44.519> CUDA<00:03:45.000> for<00:03:45.359> Python<00:03:46.170> and<00:03:46.320> I<00:03:46.950> think

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
can get PI CUDA for Python and I think

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.009 
can get PI CUDA for Python and I think
people<00:03:47.609> have<00:03:47.670> worked<00:03:47.880> on<00:03:48.030> a<00:03:48.329> library<00:03:48.930> and

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 
people have worked on a library and

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:50.930 
people have worked on a library and
c-sharp<00:03:49.230> which<00:03:49.799> I'm<00:03:49.980> pretty<00:03:50.310> keen<00:03:50.609> to<00:03:50.730> check

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
c-sharp which I'm pretty keen to check

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.979 
c-sharp which I'm pretty keen to check
out<00:03:52.519> yeah<00:03:53.519> but<00:03:53.760> we're<00:03:53.850> going<00:03:53.940> to<00:03:54.000> be<00:03:54.090> using<00:03:54.359> C++

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
out yeah but we're going to be using C++

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:58.130 
out yeah but we're going to be using C++
and<00:03:55.260> a<00:03:55.320> traditional<00:03:55.769> CUDA<00:03:56.100> C<00:03:56.720> it's<00:03:57.720> just<00:03:58.019> a

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
and a traditional CUDA C it's just a

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.319 
and a traditional CUDA C it's just a
language<00:03:58.560> for<00:03:58.769> instructing<00:03:59.280> NVIDIA<00:03:59.700> GPUs

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:00.329 
language for instructing NVIDIA GPUs

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:03.410 
language for instructing NVIDIA GPUs
yeah<00:04:01.109> do<00:04:01.380> what<00:04:01.500> you<00:04:01.590> want<00:04:02.150> it's<00:04:03.150> quite<00:04:03.390> a

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
yeah do what you want it's quite a

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:04.670 
yeah do what you want it's quite a
low-level<00:04:03.930> language

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
low-level language

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.400 
low-level language
I<00:04:04.709> mean<00:04:05.130> it's<00:04:05.280> related<00:04:05.700> to<00:04:05.730> the<00:04:05.910> C<00:04:06.120> language

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:06.410 
I mean it's related to the C language

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:08.660 
I mean it's related to the C language
it's<00:04:07.410> actually<00:04:07.680> got<00:04:07.829> almost<00:04:08.190> exactly<00:04:08.519> the

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
it's actually got almost exactly the

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:11.750 
it's actually got almost exactly the
same<00:04:08.700> syntax<00:04:09.090> as<00:04:09.390> the<00:04:09.600> C<00:04:09.810> language<00:04:10.639> but<00:04:11.639> there

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
same syntax as the C language but there

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.710 
same syntax as the C language but there
is<00:04:11.910> PTX<00:04:12.450> below<00:04:12.840> that<00:04:13.109> and<00:04:13.970> even<00:04:14.970> further<00:04:15.299> below

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
is PTX below that and even further below

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.800 
is PTX below that and even further below
PTX<00:04:16.470> there's<00:04:16.769> actually<00:04:17.100> the<00:04:17.810> hardware's

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
PTX there's actually the hardware's

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.750 
PTX there's actually the hardware's
assembly<00:04:19.289> language<00:04:19.620> which<00:04:19.859> Nvidia<00:04:20.459> does<00:04:20.609> not

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
assembly language which Nvidia does not

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.529 
assembly language which Nvidia does not
make<00:04:20.940> public<00:04:21.289> but<00:04:22.289> I'd<00:04:22.710> really<00:04:23.010> like<00:04:23.190> to

00:04:23.529 --> 00:04:23.539 
make public but I'd really like to

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:26.360 
make public but I'd really like to
eventually<00:04:24.539> get<00:04:24.750> into<00:04:24.900> tutorials<00:04:25.530> about<00:04:25.620> PTX

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
eventually get into tutorials about PTX

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:28.070 
eventually get into tutorials about PTX
it's<00:04:27.090> much<00:04:27.360> much

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 
it's much much

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.210 
it's much much
easier<00:04:28.470> than<00:04:29.000> x86<00:04:30.000> assembly<00:04:30.180> I<00:04:30.509> tell<00:04:30.780> you<00:04:30.870> that

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 
easier than x86 assembly I tell you that

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:35.930 
easier than x86 assembly I tell you that
but<00:04:32.220> I<00:04:32.250> will<00:04:32.759> see<00:04:32.909> how<00:04:33.000> we<00:04:33.060> go<00:04:34.729> alrighty<00:04:35.729> so

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
but I will see how we go alrighty so

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:37.700 
but I will see how we go alrighty so
we'll<00:04:36.090> be<00:04:36.210> looking<00:04:36.300> at<00:04:36.539> courtesy<00:04:37.169> initially

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
we'll be looking at courtesy initially

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.980 
we'll be looking at courtesy initially
as<00:04:37.889> an<00:04:38.069> extension<00:04:38.490> to<00:04:38.759> visual<00:04:39.180> C++<00:04:39.810> Express

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990 
as an extension to visual C++ Express

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:42.499 
as an extension to visual C++ Express
yeah<00:04:40.919> that's<00:04:41.250> basically<00:04:41.430> what<00:04:41.879> it<00:04:42.000> is<00:04:42.030> it<00:04:42.300> sort

00:04:42.499 --> 00:04:42.509 
yeah that's basically what it is it sort

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:44.689 
yeah that's basically what it is it sort
of<00:04:42.569> just<00:04:42.750> plugs<00:04:42.990> into<00:04:43.229> your<00:04:43.349> C++<00:04:44.069> applications

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:44.699 
of just plugs into your C++ applications

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:47.629 
of just plugs into your C++ applications
and<00:04:44.940> does<00:04:45.240> the<00:04:45.979> really<00:04:46.979> intensive

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:47.639 
and does the really intensive

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:49.730 
and does the really intensive
computations<00:04:48.330> that<00:04:48.509> you<00:04:48.569> want<00:04:48.780> on<00:04:49.500> the

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740 
computations that you want on the

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.070 
computations that you want on the
graphics<00:04:50.310> card<00:04:50.400> while<00:04:50.970> the<00:04:51.090> CPU<00:04:51.300> gets<00:04:51.720> on<00:04:51.930> with

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
graphics card while the CPU gets on with

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.899 
graphics card while the CPU gets on with
doing<00:04:52.610> whatever<00:04:53.610> it<00:04:53.849> is<00:04:53.909> the<00:04:54.090> CPU<00:04:54.539> does<00:04:55.729> ok<00:04:56.729> the

00:04:56.899 --> 00:04:56.909 
doing whatever it is the CPU does ok the

00:04:56.909 --> 00:04:59.600 
doing whatever it is the CPU does ok the
CPU<00:04:57.539> does<00:04:57.720> not<00:04:57.960> equal<00:04:58.319> the<00:04:58.470> GPU<00:04:58.979> yeah<00:04:59.550> you

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
CPU does not equal the GPU yeah you

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:01.390 
CPU does not equal the GPU yeah you
probably<00:04:59.849> already<00:05:00.060> knew<00:05:00.300> this<00:05:00.479> but<00:05:00.750> I'm

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:01.400 
probably already knew this but I'm

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.619 
probably already knew this but I'm
programming<00:05:02.400> a<00:05:02.550> GPU<00:05:02.909> is<00:05:03.180> nothing<00:05:03.509> like

00:05:03.619 --> 00:05:03.629 
programming a GPU is nothing like

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:06.320 
programming a GPU is nothing like
programming<00:05:04.020> a<00:05:04.199> CPU<00:05:04.620> even<00:05:05.069> though<00:05:05.250> the<00:05:06.090> code

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.330 
programming a CPU even though the code

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:07.279 
programming a CPU even though the code
looks<00:05:06.719> similar

00:05:07.279 --> 00:05:07.289 
looks similar

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:10.129 
looks similar
so<00:05:07.710> CUDA<00:05:08.190> C<00:05:08.430> looks<00:05:08.699> exactly<00:05:08.969> like<00:05:09.150> normal<00:05:09.719> C

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:10.139 
so CUDA C looks exactly like normal C

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:14.300 
so CUDA C looks exactly like normal C
code<00:05:10.759> for<00:05:11.759> the<00:05:11.909> CPU<00:05:13.009> but<00:05:14.009> there's<00:05:14.250> a

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:14.310 
code for the CPU but there's a

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:15.980 
code for the CPU but there's a
fundamental<00:05:14.789> difference<00:05:15.270> between<00:05:15.509> the<00:05:15.840> two

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:15.990 
fundamental difference between the two

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:18.200 
fundamental difference between the two
architectures<00:05:16.620> and<00:05:17.009> I<00:05:17.099> think<00:05:17.430> well<00:05:18.060> this<00:05:18.150> is

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:18.210 
architectures and I think well this is

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:20.240 
architectures and I think well this is
how<00:05:18.419> I<00:05:18.449> would<00:05:18.599> explain<00:05:19.020> it<00:05:19.080> anyway<00:05:19.319> the<00:05:19.560> CPU<00:05:20.099> is

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.250 
how I would explain it anyway the CPU is

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:21.800 
how I would explain it anyway the CPU is
a<00:05:20.280> small<00:05:20.669> collection<00:05:20.879> of<00:05:21.210> very<00:05:21.509> powerful

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:21.810 
a small collection of very powerful

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.770 
a small collection of very powerful
cause<00:05:22.319> whereas<00:05:23.280> the<00:05:23.430> GPU<00:05:23.969> is<00:05:24.150> a<00:05:24.180> very<00:05:24.509> large

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:24.780 
cause whereas the GPU is a very large

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:27.050 
cause whereas the GPU is a very large
collection<00:05:25.199> of<00:05:25.440> only<00:05:26.069> modestly<00:05:26.520> powerful

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060 
collection of only modestly powerful

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.140 
collection of only modestly powerful
cords<00:05:28.009> so<00:05:29.009> this<00:05:29.280> computer<00:05:29.729> here<00:05:29.879> that<00:05:30.030> I'm

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:30.150 
cords so this computer here that I'm

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:34.279 
cords so this computer here that I'm
using<00:05:30.360> now<00:05:30.659> has<00:05:31.050> a<00:05:31.500> quad<00:05:31.830> core<00:05:32.069> and<00:05:33.110> I<00:05:34.110> think

00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:34.289 
using now has a quad core and I think

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:37.939 
using now has a quad core and I think
they<00:05:34.349> run<00:05:34.469> at<00:05:34.620> 2.6<00:05:35.460> gigahertz<00:05:36.770> whereas<00:05:37.770> the

00:05:37.939 --> 00:05:37.949 
they run at 2.6 gigahertz whereas the

00:05:37.949 --> 00:05:39.680 
they run at 2.6 gigahertz whereas the
GPU<00:05:38.490> that<00:05:38.639> I've<00:05:38.759> got<00:05:38.940> in<00:05:39.060> here<00:05:39.090> this<00:05:39.240> is<00:05:39.389> an

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:39.690 
GPU that I've got in here this is an

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:45.890 
GPU that I've got in here this is an
Nvidia<00:05:40.560> GT<00:05:40.889> 440<00:05:41.279> I<00:05:41.729> think<00:05:44.539> that's<00:05:45.539> actually

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:45.900 
Nvidia GT 440 I think that's actually

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:49.850 
Nvidia GT 440 I think that's actually
got<00:05:46.020> 96<00:05:46.710> cause<00:05:47.389> here<00:05:48.389> so<00:05:49.199> it's<00:05:49.349> not<00:05:49.440> a<00:05:49.500> quad

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:49.860 
got 96 cause here so it's not a quad

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:51.469 
got 96 cause here so it's not a quad
core<00:05:50.069> it's<00:05:50.279> not<00:05:50.430> even<00:05:50.610> a<00:05:50.849> you<00:05:51.000> know<00:05:51.120> an<00:05:51.240> acht

00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:51.479 
core it's not even a you know an acht

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:55.219 
core it's not even a you know an acht
core<00:05:52.020> or<00:05:52.319> 12<00:05:52.680> cores<00:05:52.979> got<00:05:53.069> 96<00:05:53.729> cause<00:05:54.029> no<00:05:55.020> but

00:05:55.219 --> 00:05:55.229 
core or 12 cores got 96 cause no but

00:05:55.229 --> 00:05:57.140 
core or 12 cores got 96 cause no but
they<00:05:55.319> only<00:05:55.469> run<00:05:55.680> at<00:05:55.830> some<00:05:56.279> megahertz<00:05:56.819> like

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:57.150 
they only run at some megahertz like

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:58.339 
they only run at some megahertz like
they<00:05:57.300> don't<00:05:57.479> they<00:05:57.659> don't<00:05:57.690> run<00:05:57.960> at<00:05:58.080> gigahertz

00:05:58.339 --> 00:05:58.349 
they don't they don't run at gigahertz

00:05:58.349 --> 00:06:00.890 
they don't they don't run at gigahertz
like<00:05:58.710> a<00:05:58.740> CPU<00:05:59.310> does<00:05:59.520> I<00:05:59.759> can't<00:06:00.599> remember<00:06:00.719> the

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:00.900 
like a CPU does I can't remember the

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:03.050 
like a CPU does I can't remember the
exact<00:06:01.199> speed<00:06:01.469> of<00:06:01.590> them<00:06:01.710> but<00:06:01.830> there's<00:06:02.060> yeah

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:03.060 
exact speed of them but there's yeah

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:06.439 
exact speed of them but there's yeah
they're<00:06:03.300> less<00:06:03.539> less<00:06:04.050> powerful<00:06:05.180> still<00:06:06.180> you<00:06:06.330> get

00:06:06.439 --> 00:06:06.449 
they're less less powerful still you get

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:07.490 
they're less less powerful still you get
a<00:06:06.479> bunch<00:06:06.719> of<00:06:06.810> them<00:06:06.960> performing<00:06:07.349> calculations

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:07.500 
a bunch of them performing calculations

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:11.990 
a bunch of them performing calculations
and<00:06:08.069> they<00:06:08.159> absolutely<00:06:08.759> fly<00:06:10.460> anyway<00:06:11.460> what

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:12.000 
and they absolutely fly anyway what

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.430 
and they absolutely fly anyway what
you'll<00:06:12.150> want<00:06:12.300> to<00:06:12.360> do<00:06:12.539> is<00:06:12.779> download<00:06:13.080> and

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:13.440 
you'll want to do is download and

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:16.670 
you'll want to do is download and
install<00:06:13.860> CUDA<00:06:14.400> so<00:06:15.360> ah<00:06:15.750> this<00:06:15.930> is<00:06:16.409> really

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:16.680 
install CUDA so ah this is really

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:18.409 
install CUDA so ah this is really
exciting<00:06:17.009> actually<00:06:17.520> just<00:06:17.849> in<00:06:17.969> the<00:06:18.120> in<00:06:18.330> the

00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:18.419 
exciting actually just in the in the

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:20.059 
exciting actually just in the in the
last<00:06:18.599> little<00:06:18.779> while<00:06:18.960> and<00:06:19.349> video<00:06:19.620> has<00:06:19.770> released

00:06:20.059 --> 00:06:20.069 
last little while and video has released

00:06:20.069 --> 00:06:24.740 
last little while and video has released
CUDA<00:06:20.460> v<00:06:20.729> and<00:06:21.620> it<00:06:22.759> seems<00:06:23.759> to<00:06:23.969> be<00:06:24.210> from<00:06:24.509> what<00:06:24.629> I've

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:24.750 
CUDA v and it seems to be from what I've

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:25.999 
CUDA v and it seems to be from what I've
seen<00:06:24.779> at<00:06:25.050> the<00:06:25.110> moment<00:06:25.440> I've<00:06:25.500> only<00:06:25.650> played<00:06:25.800> with

00:06:25.999 --> 00:06:26.009 
seen at the moment I've only played with

00:06:26.009 --> 00:06:27.550 
seen at the moment I've only played with
it<00:06:26.129> for<00:06:26.159> a<00:06:26.310> little<00:06:26.460> bit<00:06:26.580> I<00:06:26.729> was<00:06:26.819> mostly<00:06:27.090> using

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:27.560 
it for a little bit I was mostly using

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:30.589 
it for a little bit I was mostly using
you<00:06:28.560> know<00:06:28.650> called<00:06:28.919> a<00:06:28.979> CUDA<00:06:29.400> 4.2<00:06:30.150> and<00:06:30.180> before

00:06:30.589 --> 00:06:30.599 
you know called a CUDA 4.2 and before

00:06:30.599 --> 00:06:33.580 
you know called a CUDA 4.2 and before
that<00:06:30.750> but<00:06:30.990> I'm<00:06:31.110> Kota<00:06:31.500> 5<00:06:31.770> seems<00:06:32.099> to<00:06:32.250> be<00:06:32.340> easier

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:33.590 
that but I'm Kota 5 seems to be easier

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:35.749 
that but I'm Kota 5 seems to be easier
easier<00:06:34.590> to<00:06:34.710> code<00:06:34.919> in<00:06:35.069> so<00:06:35.190> that's<00:06:35.310> definitely<00:06:35.550> a

00:06:35.749 --> 00:06:35.759 
easier to code in so that's definitely a

00:06:35.759 --> 00:06:37.909 
easier to code in so that's definitely a
good<00:06:35.789> thing<00:06:35.969> but<00:06:36.810> I'll<00:06:37.110> put<00:06:37.259> a<00:06:37.320> link<00:06:37.589> for<00:06:37.860> the

00:06:37.909 --> 00:06:37.919 
good thing but I'll put a link for the

00:06:37.919 --> 00:06:39.409 
good thing but I'll put a link for the
CUDA<00:06:38.219> zone<00:06:38.430> in<00:06:38.669> the<00:06:38.820> video<00:06:39.210> description

00:06:39.409 --> 00:06:39.419 
CUDA zone in the video description

00:06:39.419 --> 00:06:40.629 
CUDA zone in the video description
underneath

00:06:40.629 --> 00:06:40.639 
underneath

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:41.800 
underneath
you<00:06:40.699> can<00:06:40.819> download<00:06:40.999> that<00:06:41.210> we're<00:06:41.509> not<00:06:41.629> going<00:06:41.780> to

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:41.810 
you can download that we're not going to

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:46.360 
you can download that we're not going to
get<00:06:41.930> into<00:06:42.139> any<00:06:43.180> coding<00:06:44.180> today<00:06:44.629> but<00:06:45.249> yeah<00:06:46.249> if

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:46.370 
get into any coding today but yeah if

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:47.800 
get into any coding today but yeah if
you<00:06:46.400> download<00:06:46.909> this<00:06:47.060> stuff<00:06:47.300> and<00:06:47.479> set<00:06:47.659> up<00:06:47.780> your

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:47.810 
you download this stuff and set up your

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:52.269 
you download this stuff and set up your
your<00:06:48.259> IDE<00:06:48.800> we<00:06:49.430> can<00:06:49.639> get<00:06:49.759> started<00:06:49.969> next<00:06:50.360> to<00:06:51.279> it

00:06:52.269 --> 00:06:52.279 
your IDE we can get started next to it

00:06:52.279 --> 00:06:53.559 
your IDE we can get started next to it
used<00:06:52.550> to<00:06:52.699> be<00:06:52.819> that<00:06:52.969> you'd<00:06:53.090> have<00:06:53.240> to<00:06:53.270> download

00:06:53.559 --> 00:06:53.569 
used to be that you'd have to download

00:06:53.569 --> 00:06:56.890 
used to be that you'd have to download
three<00:06:54.199> different<00:06:54.849> things<00:06:55.849> the<00:06:56.150> CUDA<00:06:56.449> toolkit

00:06:56.890 --> 00:06:56.900 
three different things the CUDA toolkit

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:59.469 
three different things the CUDA toolkit
the<00:06:57.020> SDK<00:06:57.529> and<00:06:57.560> the<00:06:57.770> developer<00:06:58.219> drivers<00:06:58.610> but

00:06:59.469 --> 00:06:59.479 
the SDK and the developer drivers but

00:06:59.479 --> 00:07:01.480 
the SDK and the developer drivers but
curta<00:06:59.930> 5<00:07:00.259> seems<00:07:00.650> to<00:07:00.740> have<00:07:00.919> them<00:07:01.039> all<00:07:01.159> packaged

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:01.490 
curta 5 seems to have them all packaged

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:04.469 
curta 5 seems to have them all packaged
together<00:07:01.669> so<00:07:02.180> that's<00:07:02.449> pretty<00:07:02.779> good<00:07:02.870> news<00:07:02.930> -

00:07:04.469 --> 00:07:04.479 
together so that's pretty good news -

00:07:04.479 --> 00:07:07.540 
together so that's pretty good news -
yeah<00:07:05.479> go<00:07:05.689> to<00:07:05.749> cut<00:07:06.169> a<00:07:06.199> CUDA<00:07:06.710> zone<00:07:06.889> download<00:07:07.279> CUDA

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:07.550 
yeah go to cut a CUDA zone download CUDA

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:09.909 
yeah go to cut a CUDA zone download CUDA
5<00:07:07.930> alrighty<00:07:08.930> so<00:07:09.199> that's<00:07:09.379> about<00:07:09.590> all<00:07:09.740> that<00:07:09.770> I

00:07:09.909 --> 00:07:09.919 
5 alrighty so that's about all that I

00:07:09.919 --> 00:07:12.179 
5 alrighty so that's about all that I
wanted<00:07:10.129> to<00:07:10.279> say<00:07:10.490> really<00:07:10.729> we'll<00:07:10.999> get<00:07:11.180> on<00:07:11.300> to<00:07:11.330> a

00:07:12.179 --> 00:07:12.189 
wanted to say really we'll get on to a

00:07:12.189 --> 00:07:15.899 
wanted to say really we'll get on to a
kind<00:07:13.189> of<00:07:13.389> hello<00:07:14.389> world<00:07:14.419> I<00:07:14.930> guess<00:07:15.139> you'd<00:07:15.349> say<00:07:15.379> in

00:07:15.899 --> 00:07:15.909 
kind of hello world I guess you'd say in

00:07:15.909 --> 00:07:19.659 
kind of hello world I guess you'd say in
CUDA<00:07:16.909> next<00:07:17.779> to<00:07:17.960> but<00:07:18.860> this<00:07:19.189> is<00:07:19.250> going<00:07:19.550> to<00:07:19.610> be

00:07:19.659 --> 00:07:19.669 
CUDA next to but this is going to be

00:07:19.669 --> 00:07:22.390 
CUDA next to but this is going to be
really<00:07:19.849> good<00:07:20.060> folks<00:07:20.389> so<00:07:21.009> thank<00:07:22.009> you<00:07:22.069> very<00:07:22.250> much
