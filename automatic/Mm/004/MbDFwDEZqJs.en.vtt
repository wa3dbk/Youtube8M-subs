00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 hello you love that nice again 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:07.950
 since I have today for you only 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.920
 One thing and that came his girlfriend 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.380
 to me and meant you have maybe 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.389
 an idea i have a little problem 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.670
 now people come to me and 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.529
 ask if I have any ideas I test the 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:24.810
 only I can do it 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:26.640
 not well, well, look and that was 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.740
 the problem or is the problem 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.140
 this is the scarf not people but 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.559
 the charm of a friend and this one 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.030
 scarf has a wax stain and the 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.390
 wax black is not going out that was 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.800
 completely full and she tried that 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.350
 somehow to plan out and no 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.110
 but no idea, and now 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.629
 I saw something and I want that 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.750
 now try it so needs 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:54.780
 to stain a scarf with wax 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:57.210
 then you need an iron this 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.770
 I have iron from my girlfriend 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.750
 I borrowed that chance 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.879
 because I have no iron 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.350
 I wash my clothes and hang them 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.510
 then quite normal to one 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.790
 tumble dry and so on 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.140
 Laundry stand and that was what I stood for 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.360
 my things are not wrinkled 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.520
 from so I really need no iron 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.770
 and unfortunately I have none 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.060
 Ironing table because if I do not iron 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.600
 I do not need a ironing table 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.369
 it's very logical just try it 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.020
 I just do it with a towel 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.080
 on my coffee table 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.869
 I hope that's fine, too 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.400
 You can only happen so you need 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.250
 just as I said this sparkle with wax 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.430
 stains and a zebra and an iron 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.380
 and that's it 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:42.060
 as I said, I really have 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.170
 I do not know if it works 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.860
 hope this jump does not equal 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.780
 ruined because otherwise I have a problem 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:53.520
 wait , I have to think like that 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:55.290
 was yes I know on to give 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.300
 this actually ironing table this 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.870
 put it on top with the wax stain and 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:04.680
 then this topic is a paper about 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:07.710
 These wax stain put it and now 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:11.490
 should I have something wrong 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:13.590
 could wool on wool 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:16.470
 ok i want to go back to wool 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.520
 she brings me that, I'll be fine 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.820
 work that was only one 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.440
 His son was little here now 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.530
 somewhere the wax stain with the 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:28.350
 iron go over it 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:31.170
 yes yes, here you are already this wax 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:33.060
 stain is warmed and he dissolves 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.440
 I'll go over it again then it could 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:39.420
 see even better here 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:44.610
 I hope you can see that I just look 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:51.590
 just gone iron for hours 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:54.209
 and is called insightix times I am 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:58.950
 no ironing expert and not me 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:03:01.170
 something else he burns he has gone 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:04.769
 completely dissolved by itself and 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:06.390
 I think it's great, I hope that with you 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:09.930
 other things, too, I work 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:11.519
 go with a few people with wax 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:15.239
 smear hot wax 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:20.130
 and then let's see if I say then 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:22.890
 can i do that i have tried it 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.510
 that works out then I can 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.500
 Do a little bit of testing with larger ones 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.459
 surfaces also works 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.959
 I think it's great pac works and 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:34.170
 that was already tried for today 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:37.200
 Maybe you have more ideas 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:41.450
 as it goes or no idea tries 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.450
