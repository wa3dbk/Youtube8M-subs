 From above the aperture and shutter speed and the card comes out 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:53.960

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:55.010
 The mode can be selected. This depends on the camera, but now using 1 ds of Canon 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.760
 Because 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:03.020
 Like 1 ds 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:06.330

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.780
 Now it's low 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.600
 If you press the shutter here 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.800
 in this way 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.800
 The form of a beautiful 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:34.710
 Now with f 14

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.190
 If you say what happens here 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.150
 This is it 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:18.530
 If you can check the histogram with this one, the shutter is released in this state 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:18.530
 You will be able to confirm with the histogram whether the exposure is correct 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:23.590

 It is regrettable that continuous shutter can not be done 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:31.699
 It is broken once, but I can not say how many times I can leave it for a while 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:43.139
