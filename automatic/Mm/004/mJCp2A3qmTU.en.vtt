00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440 
different game types in I thought it was

different game types in I thought it was
pretty<00:04:35.590> informative<00:04:36.130> i<00:04:36.310> think<00:04:36.550> the<00:04:36.640> alo<00:04:36.880> scene

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.150 
pretty informative i think the alo scene

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.720 
pretty informative i think the alo scene
is<00:04:37.360> going<00:04:37.900> to<00:04:37.960> grow<00:04:38.200> a<00:04:38.230> lot<00:04:38.560> since<00:04:39.040> call<00:04:39.580> of

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:39.730 
is going to grow a lot since call of

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:42.120 
is going to grow a lot since call of
duty<00:04:40.000> and<00:04:40.180> here's<00:04:41.020> my<00:04:41.140> theory<00:04:41.380> call<00:04:41.920> of<00:04:42.100> duty

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.130 
duty and here's my theory call of duty

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:45.390 
duty and here's my theory call of duty
was<00:04:42.910> not<00:04:43.150> liked<00:04:43.450> by<00:04:43.570> halo<00:04:44.050> players<00:04:44.350> but<00:04:45.100> now<00:04:45.370> a

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.400 
was not liked by halo players but now a

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.340 
was not liked by halo players but now a
lot<00:04:45.940> of<00:04:46.060> them<00:04:46.210> came<00:04:46.480> over<00:04:46.780> to<00:04:46.870> call<00:04:47.050> of<00:04:47.110> duty

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:47.350 
lot of them came over to call of duty

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:48.960 
lot of them came over to call of duty
because<00:04:47.500> halo<00:04:47.950> didn't<00:04:48.280> have<00:04:48.430> anything<00:04:48.640> on<00:04:48.850> the

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970 
because halo didn't have anything on the

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:51.180 
because halo didn't have anything on the
circuit<00:04:49.360> and<00:04:49.510> so<00:04:50.080> now<00:04:50.380> that<00:04:50.560> halo<00:04:50.860> is<00:04:50.920> coming

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:51.190 
circuit and so now that halo is coming

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.160 
circuit and so now that halo is coming
back<00:04:51.460> there's<00:04:51.940> a<00:04:52.030> lot<00:04:52.270> of<00:04:52.300> Call<00:04:52.690> of<00:04:52.720> Duty

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:53.170 
back there's a lot of Call of Duty

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:55.170 
back there's a lot of Call of Duty
players<00:04:53.410> that<00:04:53.740> support<00:04:54.190> halo<00:04:54.580> and<00:04:54.790> so<00:04:55.060> I<00:04:55.090> think

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.180 
players that support halo and so I think

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.150 
players that support halo and so I think
halo<00:04:55.630> is<00:04:55.690> gonna<00:04:55.870> be<00:04:55.990> pretty<00:04:56.110> big<00:04:56.410> and<00:04:56.620> flame

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.160 
halo is gonna be pretty big and flame

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.650 
halo is gonna be pretty big and flame
sword<00:04:57.490> you<00:04:57.790> know<00:04:57.910> he<00:04:58.120> has<00:04:58.270> an<00:04:58.450> excellent

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:02.440 
opportunity to just be optic flame sword

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.820 
opportunity to just be optic flame sword
can<00:05:02.590> be<00:05:02.710> huge<00:05:03.100> but<00:05:03.790> if<00:05:03.970> if<00:05:04.240> halo<00:05:04.720> is<00:05:04.930> a<00:05:04.990> success

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:05.830 
can be huge but if if halo is a success

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:08.580 
can be huge but if if halo is a success
