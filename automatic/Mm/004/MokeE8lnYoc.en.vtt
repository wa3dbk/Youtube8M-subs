00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:18.140
 we are six classes miss france 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:21.800
 this is the shop lomography at the level 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:25.099
 118 rue lafayette and lomography 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.169
 especially the very argentic photography 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:30.560
 simple 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:33.410
 Funny not too technical sees 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.739
 love love for vehicles for 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.739
 the worst 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:52.859
 there are these trailers cd missed pictures 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.719
 but then we do not care about that if 

00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:57.239
 rather subjective photography 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.039
 kouassi a picture is missed for the time 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.519
 for others it's the best picture 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:04.199
 of his life without naming it that's it 

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:07.289
 this is the basic model longa girl has 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:11.360
 started to come as a club of 

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:11.360
 lovers of this ticketing appearance 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:23.770
 people are a bit fed up with 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.600
 digital thousands of photos that 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.990
 takes who watched minutes twice 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:31.300
 on the screen behind and after he 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.950
 disappears on hard drives if you 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.290
 take a camera at the level that 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.210
 we have a world completely 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:39.670
 different from what you see 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:42.510
 normally the world and not at the level 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:46.479
 eyes there are plenty of others 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:51.550
 civility law there is 300 to 360 degrees east 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:52.600
 for you and in a mirror m of 25 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.540
 meters to m 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:58.090
 have you read my case where you can take 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:00.960
 photos and it's really discovering everything 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.960
 what's around you
