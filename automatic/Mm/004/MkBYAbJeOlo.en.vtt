00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.290 
probably crazy taxi in there um here's a
thing<00:00:36.090> even<00:00:37.100> though<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.219> idea<00:00:38.370> of<00:00:38.850> Sonic

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
thing even though the idea of Sonic

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.600 
thing even though the idea of Sonic
driving<00:00:39.960> a<00:00:40.050> car<00:00:40.079> is<00:00:40.559> stupid<00:00:41.129> even<00:00:41.399> though<00:00:41.489> he

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
driving a car is stupid even though he

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.450 
driving a car is stupid even though he
can<00:00:41.790> run<00:00:41.969> really<00:00:42.210> fast<00:00:43.250> it's<00:00:44.600> it's<00:00:45.600> gonna<00:00:45.870> be

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460 
can run really fast it's it's gonna be

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.310 
can run really fast it's it's gonna be
probably<00:00:47.460> gonna<00:00:47.640> be<00:00:47.760> okay<00:00:48.090> games<00:00:48.360> because

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
probably gonna be okay games because

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.580 
probably gonna be okay games because
sega<00:00:50.309> superstars<00:00:50.690> they<00:00:51.690> all<00:00:51.870> can't<00:00:52.199> run<00:00:52.379> fast

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
sega superstars they all can't run fast

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.500 
sega superstars they all can't run fast
so<00:00:53.250> that<00:00:53.280> maybe<00:00:53.610> they<00:00:53.789> want<00:00:53.940> to<00:00:54.030> put<00:00:54.149> them<00:00:54.329> in

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
so that maybe they want to put them in

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.569 
so that maybe they want to put them in
cars<00:00:54.719> but<00:00:54.989> I<00:00:55.079> can't<00:00:55.320> just<00:00:55.860> leave<00:00:56.010> a<00:00:56.070> sonic<00:00:56.430> out

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
cars but I can't just leave a sonic out

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.720 
cars but I can't just leave a sonic out
when<00:00:56.730> he's<00:00:56.879> like<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.719> mascot<00:00:58.469> so<00:00:59.370> they<00:00:59.520> had<00:00:59.640> to

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
when he's like the mascot so they had to

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.119 
when he's like the mascot so they had to
put<00:00:59.879> him<00:01:00.030> in<00:01:00.120> a<00:01:00.180> car<00:01:00.359> too<00:01:00.680> um<00:01:02.960> so<00:01:03.960> yeah<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:04.470> this

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
put him in a car too um so yeah and this

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.840 
put him in a car too um so yeah and this
is<00:01:05.159> nothing<00:01:05.670> like<00:01:05.700> Mario<00:01:06.390> Kart<00:01:07.400> because<00:01:08.400> first

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
is nothing like Mario Kart because first

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.080 
is nothing like Mario Kart because first
of<00:01:08.909> all<00:01:09.000> mario<00:01:09.330> kart<00:01:09.600> uses<00:01:09.900> shells<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:10.530> stuff

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
of all mario kart uses shells and stuff

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:16.609 
of all mario kart uses shells and stuff
and<00:01:12.090> you<00:01:12.600> know<00:01:12.650> and<00:01:15.200> sonic<00:01:16.200> users<00:01:16.500> like

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
and you know and sonic users like

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:22.030 
and you know and sonic users like
missiles<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:18.140> stars<00:01:20.090> stuff<00:01:21.090> like<00:01:21.330> that<00:01:21.360> and

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.040 
missiles and stars stuff like that and

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.140 
missiles and stars stuff like that and
side<00:01:23.240> mario<00:01:24.240> kart<00:01:24.509> came<00:01:24.689> after<00:01:25.080> sonic<00:01:25.409> drift

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 
side mario kart came after sonic drift

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.440 
side mario kart came after sonic drift
so<00:01:27.650> don't<00:01:28.650> think<00:01:28.890> mario<00:01:29.189> kart<00:01:29.490> they're<00:01:30.299> taking

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
so don't think mario kart they're taking

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:31.850 
so don't think mario kart they're taking
the<00:01:30.689> idea<00:01:30.900> from<00:01:30.990> mario<00:01:31.320> kart<00:01:31.590> because<00:01:31.740> they're

the idea from mario kart because they're
really<00:01:32.070> not<00:01:32.299> that<00:01:33.299> makes<00:01:33.479> me<00:01:33.659> angry<00:01:34.159> if<00:01:35.159> i<00:01:35.490> hear
