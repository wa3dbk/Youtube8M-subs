00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:23.150 
some new blocks and stuff thought I'd

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:24.250 
some new blocks and stuff thought I'd
get<00:00:23.240> a<00:00:23.300> little<00:00:23.480> fancy<00:00:23.779> with<00:00:23.900> the<00:00:23.930> redstone

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:24.260 
get a little fancy with the redstone

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.050 
get a little fancy with the redstone
blocks<00:00:24.500> I<00:00:24.650> love<00:00:24.830> the<00:00:24.949> way<00:00:25.039> the<00:00:25.220> Redstone<00:00:25.699> looks

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:26.060 
blocks I love the way the Redstone looks

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.300 
blocks I love the way the Redstone looks
this<00:00:26.750> redstone<00:00:27.109> block<00:00:27.410> looks<00:00:27.680> with<00:00:27.859> sandstone

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:28.310 
this redstone block looks with sandstone

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.510 
this redstone block looks with sandstone
it's<00:00:29.000> a<00:00:29.270> very<00:00:30.230> good<00:00:30.410> combination<00:00:30.980> so<00:00:31.160> anyways

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:31.520 
it's a very good combination so anyways

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.010 
it's a very good combination so anyways
we<00:00:31.699> have<00:00:31.820> a<00:00:31.850> new<00:00:32.000> block<00:00:32.239> it<00:00:32.510> is<00:00:32.629> called<00:00:32.870> the

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:33.020 
we have a new block it is called the

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.290 
we have a new block it is called the
dropper<00:00:33.500> block<00:00:33.739> and<00:00:34.059> basically<00:00:35.059> this<00:00:35.239> is

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:35.300 
dropper block and basically this is

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.020 
dropper block and basically this is
toggled<00:00:35.629> with<00:00:35.989> a<00:00:36.019> button<00:00:36.379> or<00:00:36.710> a<00:00:37.220> switch<00:00:37.760> or<00:00:38.000> a

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030 
toggled with a button or a switch or a

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.149 
toggled with a button or a switch or a
redstone<00:00:38.390> signal<00:00:38.900> and<00:00:39.290> this<00:00:39.890> is<00:00:40.040> how<00:00:40.129> you

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:40.159 
redstone signal and this is how you

00:00:40.159 --> 00:00:44.439 
redstone signal and this is how you
craft<00:00:40.489> it<00:00:40.699> and<00:00:41.199> it's<00:00:42.199> basically<00:00:42.559> just<00:00:43.449> just

00:00:44.439 --> 00:00:44.449 
craft it and it's basically just just

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:46.149 
craft it and it's basically just just
cobblestone<00:00:45.050> hopper<00:00:45.739> in<00:00:45.830> the<00:00:45.890> middle

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:46.159 
cobblestone hopper in the middle

00:00:46.159 --> 00:00:48.969 
cobblestone hopper in the middle
redstone<00:00:47.120> there<00:00:47.420> and<00:00:47.629> the<00:00:48.049> actual<00:00:48.350> texture<00:00:48.739> of

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:48.979 
redstone there and the actual texture of

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:51.399 
redstone there and the actual texture of
it<00:00:49.070> looks<00:00:49.339> like<00:00:49.489> this<00:00:49.900> let's<00:00:50.900> get<00:00:51.110> that<00:00:51.229> bad

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:51.409 
it looks like this let's get that bad

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:52.960 
it looks like this let's get that bad

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:58.430 
face right now anyway so we have some

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.210 
face right now anyway so we have some
stone<00:00:58.699> in<00:00:58.879> here<00:00:59.119> hit<00:00:59.570> that<00:00:59.860> goes<00:01:00.860> inside<00:01:01.040> the

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:01.220 
stone in here hit that goes inside the

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:06.100 
stone in here hit that goes inside the
chest<00:01:01.489> and<00:01:01.790> it<00:01:02.239> does<00:01:02.449> one<00:01:02.690> at<00:01:02.809> a<00:01:02.869> time<00:01:04.810> okay<00:01:05.810> and

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110 
chest and it does one at a time okay and

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:07.920 
chest and it does one at a time okay and
we'll<00:01:06.650> see<00:01:06.770> if<00:01:06.860> it<00:01:06.920> works<00:01:07.070> with<00:01:07.220> the<00:01:07.280> furnace

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:07.930 
we'll see if it works with the furnace

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.870 
we'll see if it works with the furnace
nothing<00:01:08.930> nose<00:01:09.140> into<00:01:09.440> the<00:01:09.530> furnace<00:01:09.890> looks<00:01:10.760> like

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
nothing nose into the furnace looks like

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.969 
nothing nose into the furnace looks like
we<00:01:11.000> lost<00:01:11.030> the<00:01:11.510> all<00:01:11.659> the<00:01:11.990> stacked<00:01:12.289> but<00:01:12.530> one<00:01:12.770> so

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
we lost the all the stacked but one so

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:14.170 
we lost the all the stacked but one so
it<00:01:13.070> looks<00:01:13.189> like<00:01:13.219> it<00:01:13.399> might<00:01:13.520> be<00:01:13.549> glitched<00:01:13.939> with

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
it looks like it might be glitched with

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.200 
it looks like it might be glitched with
furnaces<00:01:15.310> then<00:01:16.310> our<00:01:16.430> one<00:01:16.609> is<00:01:16.759> still<00:01:16.969> there

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
furnaces then our one is still there

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.740 
furnaces then our one is still there
okay<00:01:17.659> so<00:01:17.719> we<00:01:17.869> have<00:01:17.899> a<00:01:18.049> record<00:01:19.570> so<00:01:20.570> this

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
okay so we have a record so this

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.660 
okay so we have a record so this
launches<00:01:21.259> the<00:01:21.320> record<00:01:21.710> out<00:01:21.859> okay<00:01:22.219> and<00:01:22.490> your

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
launches the record out okay and your

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.580 
launches the record out okay and your
chest<00:01:23.950> no<00:01:24.950> comprendo<00:01:25.429> one<00:01:25.579> in<00:01:25.700> her<00:01:25.789> chest<00:01:26.000> too

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
chest no comprendo one in her chest too

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.800 
chest no comprendo one in her chest too
wow<00:01:27.590> I<00:01:27.799> figured<00:01:28.130> it<00:01:28.219> would<00:01:28.310> work<00:01:28.399> with<00:01:28.579> that

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
wow I figured it would work with that

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:34.090 
wow I figured it would work with that
okay<00:01:29.810> then<00:01:31.329> so<00:01:32.329> this<00:01:32.570> is<00:01:32.750> another<00:01:33.020> this<00:01:33.859> is<00:01:33.920> a

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
okay then so this is another this is a

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.060 
okay then so this is another this is a
dropper<00:01:34.640> going<00:01:34.969> into<00:01:35.450> a<00:01:35.479> dispenser<00:01:36.020> so<00:01:37.009> it

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
dropper going into a dispenser so it

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.310 
dropper going into a dispenser so it
looks<00:01:37.189> like<00:01:37.249> that<00:01:37.520> works<00:01:37.789> this<00:01:38.630> is<00:01:38.810> a<00:01:38.840> dropper

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
looks like that works this is a dropper

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.550 
looks like that works this is a dropper
going<00:01:39.740> into<00:01:40.399> a<00:01:40.460> hopper<00:01:41.020> and<00:01:42.020> I<00:01:42.140> was<00:01:42.289> a<00:01:42.320> little

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
going into a hopper and I was a little

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.669 
going into a hopper and I was a little
too<00:01:42.679> close<00:01:43.009> they're<00:01:43.329> nope<00:01:44.329> doesn't<00:01:44.359> work<00:01:44.929> hop

00:01:45.669 --> 00:01:45.679 
too close they're nope doesn't work hop

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:47.380 
too close they're nope doesn't work hop
it<00:01:45.829> would<00:01:45.920> have<00:01:46.009> to<00:01:46.070> be<00:01:46.130> pretty<00:01:46.340> far<00:01:46.640> away<00:01:46.729> so

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
it would have to be pretty far away so

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.529 
it would have to be pretty far away so
this<00:01:47.600> is<00:01:47.810> a<00:01:48.289> dropper<00:01:49.009> going<00:01:49.429> into<00:01:49.759> a<00:01:49.789> mine<00:01:50.210> cart

00:01:50.529 --> 00:01:50.539 
this is a dropper going into a mine cart

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:56.169 
this is a dropper going into a mine cart
and<00:01:51.310> it<00:01:52.310> did<00:01:52.490> work<00:01:52.729> okay<00:01:54.280> furnace<00:01:55.280> minecart<00:01:55.850> no

00:01:56.169 --> 00:01:56.179 
and it did work okay furnace minecart no

00:01:56.179 --> 00:02:00.039 
and it did work okay furnace minecart no
and<00:01:56.569> hopper<00:01:57.469> minecart<00:01:58.390> so<00:01:59.390> it<00:01:59.539> actually<00:01:59.719> did

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:00.049 
and hopper minecart so it actually did

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:01.359 
and hopper minecart so it actually did
work<00:02:00.200> for<00:02:00.439> that<00:02:00.590> one<00:02:00.740> that's<00:02:00.950> pretty<00:02:01.159> cool

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
work for that one that's pretty cool

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:03.999 
work for that one that's pretty cool
actually<00:02:01.719> to<00:02:02.719> make<00:02:02.869> this<00:02:03.049> hopper<00:02:03.499> minecart

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:04.009 
actually to make this hopper minecart

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:06.279 
actually to make this hopper minecart

00:02:06.279 --> 00:02:06.289 
all you have to do is put a hopper and a

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:08.469 
all you have to do is put a hopper and a
minecart<00:02:06.619> over<00:02:06.950> top<00:02:07.159> of<00:02:07.189> it<00:02:07.520> and<00:02:07.670> I<00:02:08.149> mean

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
minecart over top of it and I mean

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.029 
minecart over top of it and I mean
there's<00:02:08.660> a<00:02:08.750> ton<00:02:09.020> of<00:02:09.050> different<00:02:09.289> variations

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
there's a ton of different variations

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:14.190 
there's a ton of different variations
for<00:02:10.220> this<00:02:10.399> thing<00:02:10.670> with<00:02:11.450> potions<00:02:12.020> it<00:02:12.560> actually

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
for this thing with potions it actually

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.199 
for this thing with potions it actually
it<00:02:15.200> actually<00:02:15.739> it<00:02:16.099> doesn't<00:02:16.580> put<00:02:16.879> ingredients

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
it actually it doesn't put ingredients

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:19.660 
it actually it doesn't put ingredients
in<00:02:17.750> but<00:02:18.080> it<00:02:18.170> puts<00:02:18.319> bottles<00:02:18.799> of<00:02:18.950> water<00:02:19.159> in<00:02:19.489> so

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
in but it puts bottles of water in so

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:20.730 
in but it puts bottles of water in so
that's<00:02:19.760> pretty<00:02:20.060> cool

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:20.740 
that's pretty cool

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.520 
that's pretty cool
um<00:02:21.250> and<00:02:21.490> then<00:02:21.700> the<00:02:22.240> new<00:02:22.360> feature<00:02:22.630> with<00:02:23.050> TNT

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
um and then the new feature with TNT

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.840 
um and then the new feature with TNT
mine<00:02:23.770> carts<00:02:24.190> and<00:02:24.540> once<00:02:25.540> once<00:02:26.200> it's<00:02:26.380> activated

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
mine carts and once once it's activated

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.610 
mine carts and once once it's activated
now<00:02:27.850> as<00:02:28.510> long<00:02:28.930> as<00:02:29.050> I<00:02:29.110> think<00:02:29.290> it's<00:02:29.410> on<00:02:29.590> the

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
now as long as I think it's on the

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.470 
now as long as I think it's on the
tracker<00:02:29.980> near<00:02:30.310> the<00:02:30.400> track<00:02:30.670> it<00:02:30.880> will<00:02:31.090> not<00:02:31.270> blow

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
tracker near the track it will not blow

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.570 
tracker near the track it will not blow
up<00:02:31.780> the<00:02:31.960> actual<00:02:32.290> track<00:02:32.680> it<00:02:32.890> only<00:02:33.040> blow<00:02:33.340> up<00:02:33.430> the

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
up the actual track it only blow up the

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.460 
up the actual track it only blow up the
items<00:02:33.880> around<00:02:34.210> it<00:02:34.450> so<00:02:34.990> let's<00:02:35.140> give<00:02:35.290> that<00:02:35.440> a

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
items around it so let's give that a

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:41.940 
items around it so let's give that a
test<00:02:36.390> go<00:02:39.750> hopefully<00:02:40.750> not<00:02:41.500> sure<00:02:41.680> if<00:02:41.770> it's<00:02:41.830> gonna

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
test go hopefully not sure if it's gonna

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:43.890 
test go hopefully not sure if it's gonna
work<00:02:42.070> since<00:02:42.490> it<00:02:42.610> was<00:02:42.730> off<00:02:42.970> the<00:02:43.000> car<00:02:43.450> alpha

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
work since it was off the car alpha

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.140 
work since it was off the car alpha
track<00:02:44.170> no<00:02:44.410> it<00:02:44.560> definitely<00:02:44.950> didn't<00:02:45.340> so<00:02:45.970> that

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
track no it definitely didn't so that

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:47.850 
track no it definitely didn't so that
wasn't<00:02:46.360> blew<00:02:46.600> up<00:02:46.750> at<00:02:46.870> all<00:02:47.020> I<00:02:47.170> just<00:02:47.410> blew<00:02:47.620> up<00:02:47.710> my

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.600 
wasn't blew up at all I just blew up my
little<00:02:48.010> area<00:02:48.400> here<00:02:48.460> pretty<00:02:48.970> cool<00:02:50.610> whenever

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
little area here pretty cool whenever

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:52.890 
little area here pretty cool whenever
you're<00:02:51.760> making<00:02:52.090> a<00:02:52.180> video<00:02:52.360> and<00:02:52.600> you<00:02:52.690> need<00:02:52.810> to

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
you're making a video and you need to

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.540 
you're making a video and you need to
change<00:02:53.050> game<00:02:53.380> modes<00:02:53.620> instead<00:02:53.950> of<00:02:54.040> typing<00:02:54.190> just

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
change game modes instead of typing just

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:58.260 
change game modes instead of typing just
do<00:02:54.670> this<00:02:54.850> and<00:02:55.260> fail<00:02:56.260> of<00:02:56.710> course<00:02:57.040> I<00:02:57.340> have<00:02:58.120> these

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:58.270 
do this and fail of course I have these

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:59.850 
do this and fail of course I have these
two<00:02:58.450> command<00:02:58.780> blocks<00:02:59.020> set<00:02:59.230> up<00:02:59.290> to<00:02:59.440> change<00:02:59.680> my

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
two command blocks set up to change my

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.280 
two command blocks set up to change my
game<00:02:59.920> mode<00:03:00.280> whatever<00:03:00.550> I<00:03:00.640> needed<00:03:01.050> let<00:03:02.050> me<00:03:02.140> go

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
game mode whatever I needed let me go

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:03.870 
game mode whatever I needed let me go

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
and so we're just going to switch to

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.250 
and so we're just going to switch to
survival<00:03:04.390> actually<00:03:04.720> let's<00:03:04.930> go<00:03:05.050> back<00:03:05.230> to

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
survival actually let's go back to

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.790 
survival actually let's go back to
creative<00:03:05.770> and<00:03:05.920> get<00:03:06.250> ourselves<00:03:06.340> a<00:03:06.640> sword<00:03:07.380> so<00:03:08.380> in

supposed<00:03:12.250> to<00:03:12.370> be<00:03:12.490> stronger<00:03:16.380> so<00:03:17.380> it<00:03:17.470> took<00:03:17.590> about

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:17.740 
supposed to be stronger so it took about

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:21.090 
supposed to be stronger so it took about
three<00:03:18.190> hits<00:03:18.430> yeah<00:03:19.270> I<00:03:19.720> mean<00:03:20.080> he<00:03:20.200> was<00:03:20.350> on<00:03:20.500> fire<00:03:20.770> to
