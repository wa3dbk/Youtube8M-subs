00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.980 
I really recommend making the extra
effort<00:01:31.770> to<00:01:32.130> go<00:01:32.250> and<00:01:32.400> get<00:01:32.579> them<00:01:32.729> if<00:01:32.850> you<00:01:33.000> can<00:01:33.210> and

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
effort to go and get them if you can and

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.840 
effort to go and get them if you can and
we're<00:01:34.290> going<00:01:34.409> to<00:01:34.439> go<00:01:34.650> ahead<00:01:34.770> and<00:01:35.159> rub<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.670> meat

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
we're going to go ahead and rub the meat

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.640 
we're going to go ahead and rub the meat
really<00:01:36.570> good<00:01:36.810> with<00:01:36.960> all<00:01:37.170> those<00:01:37.350> bread<00:01:37.619> crumbs

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
really good with all those bread crumbs

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.810 
really good with all those bread crumbs
and<00:01:38.340> really<00:01:39.090> get<00:01:39.270> this<00:01:39.590> just<00:01:40.590> right<00:01:40.920> and<00:01:41.159> rub

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
and really get this just right and rub

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.569 
and really get this just right and rub
the<00:01:42.000> edges<00:01:42.150> in<00:01:42.450> it<00:01:42.540> too<00:01:42.810> and<00:01:43.250> there<00:01:44.250> you<00:01:44.399> go<00:01:44.520> you

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
the edges in it too and there you go you

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.520 
the edges in it too and there you go you
can<00:01:44.790> see<00:01:45.030> we're<00:01:45.329> really<00:01:45.570> pushing<00:01:45.960> it<00:01:46.200> down<00:01:46.350> in

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
can see we're really pushing it down in

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:47.810 
can see we're really pushing it down in
there<00:01:46.710> to<00:01:46.860> get<00:01:47.009> as<00:01:47.130> many<00:01:47.340> of<00:01:47.460> those<00:01:47.549> bread

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
there to get as many of those bread

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.690

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:30.550 
that goes a long way so we're going to

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:32.250 
that goes a long way so we're going to
take<00:05:30.790> a<00:05:30.820> little<00:05:31.090> bit<00:05:31.270> more<00:05:31.330> that<00:05:31.690> stock<00:05:32.020> that

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:32.260 
take a little bit more that stock that

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:33.810 
take a little bit more that stock that
