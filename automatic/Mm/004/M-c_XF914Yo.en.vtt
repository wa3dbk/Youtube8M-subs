00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:47.010 
I don't know probably a tire changer

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.630 
I don't know probably a tire changer
okay<00:01:48.010> could<00:01:48.790> you<00:01:48.910> go<00:01:49.030> to<00:01:49.090> be<00:01:49.180> idle<00:01:49.870> and<00:01:50.050> precise

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
okay could you go to be idle and precise

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.060 
okay could you go to be idle and precise
what's<00:01:51.640> the<00:01:51.760> best<00:01:51.940> stretch<00:01:52.180> of<00:01:52.330> road<00:01:55.020> from

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
what's the best stretch of road from

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:02.100 
what's the best stretch of road from
Monaco<00:01:58.200> do<00:01:59.850> the<00:02:00.850> time<00:02:01.060> right<00:02:01.300> before<00:02:01.330> you<00:02:01.930> go

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
Monaco do the time right before you go

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.080 
Monaco do the time right before you go
north<00:02:02.440> it's<00:02:03.070> like<00:02:03.190> right<00:02:03.430> against<00:02:03.729> the<00:02:03.880> water

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
north it's like right against the water

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.180 
north it's like right against the water
or<00:02:04.630> like<00:02:05.100> like<00:02:06.100> 80<00:02:06.369> miles<00:02:07.709> you<00:02:08.709> go<00:02:08.890> through

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
or like like 80 miles you go through

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.120 
or like like 80 miles you go through
tunnels<00:02:09.640> like<00:02:10.209> its<00:02:10.450> column<00:02:11.110> bridges<00:02:11.500> four

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
tunnels like its column bridges four

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.420 
tunnels like its column bridges four
corners<00:02:12.520> it's<00:02:12.700> different

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
corners it's different

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.239 
corners it's different
it<00:02:14.879> was<00:02:15.030> fun
