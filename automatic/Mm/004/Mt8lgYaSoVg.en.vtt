brackets<00:00:15.269> player<00:00:15.570> bracket<00:00:16.109> and<00:00:16.260> it<00:00:16.890> showed

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
brackets player bracket and it showed

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.400 
brackets player bracket and it showed
the<00:00:17.310> player<00:00:17.490> that<00:00:17.640> looks<00:00:17.880> at<00:00:18.090> it<00:00:18.210> now<00:00:18.960> it's<00:00:19.170> far

you what world you're in and whoever
looks<00:00:27.810> at<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.199> sign<00:00:28.410> you<00:00:28.650> see<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:28.980> stats<00:00:29.279> for

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
looks at the sign you see the stats for

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.269 
looks at the sign you see the stats for
them<00:00:29.730> so<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.570> biomat<00:00:31.170> ocean<00:00:31.560> this<00:00:31.980> is<00:00:32.130> the

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
them so the biomat ocean this is the

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.400 
them so the biomat ocean this is the
current<00:00:32.579> coordinates<00:00:33.000> of<00:00:33.210> that<00:00:33.239> sign<00:00:33.660> you're

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
current coordinates of that sign you're

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.220 
current coordinates of that sign you're
looking<00:00:34.770> north<00:00:35.239> so<00:00:36.239> if<00:00:36.480> I<00:00:36.630> look<00:00:36.660> to<00:00:36.899> this<00:00:37.020> way

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
looking north so if I look to this way

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.470 
looking north so if I look to this way
and<00:00:37.380> right<00:00:37.500> clicked<00:00:37.860> it<00:00:38.070> update<00:00:38.489> it<00:00:38.700> so<00:00:38.940> you

works perfectly so if we quickly show
you<00:01:01.710> how<00:01:01.890> to<00:01:01.949> create<00:01:02.309> one<00:01:02.579> of<00:01:02.609> these<00:01:03.229> so<00:01:04.229> you<00:01:04.920> do

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
you how to create one of these so you do

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.940 
you how to create one of these so you do
bracket<00:01:05.700> like<00:01:05.880> that<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:06.330> then<00:01:06.990> player<00:01:07.380> will

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
bracket like that and then player will

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.950 
bracket like that and then player will
be<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.220> player<00:01:08.460> sign<00:01:09.680> level<00:01:10.680> will<00:01:10.799> be<00:01:10.950> level

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
be the player sign level will be level

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.510 
be the player sign level will be level
then<00:01:12.960> you<00:01:13.170> could<00:01:13.350> put<00:01:13.530> color<00:01:13.740> tags<00:01:14.010> in<00:01:14.220> front

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
then you could put color tags in front

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:22.810 
then you could put color tags in front
like<00:01:14.700> I<00:01:14.939> have<00:01:15.180> so<00:01:15.930> for<00:01:16.259> instance<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.920> XP<00:01:17.780> and

reason<00:01:30.780> level<00:01:31.079> don't<00:01:31.229> work<00:01:31.350> maybe<00:01:31.619> I<00:01:31.740> did<00:01:31.890> it

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
reason level don't work maybe I did it

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:43.390 
reason level don't work maybe I did it
wrong<00:01:32.100> oh<00:01:36.500> yes<00:01:37.500> cuz<00:01:37.770> I'm<00:01:37.860> in<00:01:37.950> game<00:01:38.130> mode

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:43.400 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.000 

and<00:01:44.870> yeah<00:01:45.870> I<00:01:45.900> can't<00:01:46.200> get<00:01:46.320> its<00:01:46.440> update<00:01:46.740> for<00:01:46.890> some

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
reason that would work normally anyway

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.430 
reason that would work normally anyway
it's<00:01:49.230> a<00:01:49.440> your<00:01:49.590> level<00:01:49.830> there<00:01:50.060> but<00:01:51.060> Nene<00:01:51.930> IT<00:01:52.140> so
