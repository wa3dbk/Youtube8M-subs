00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:05.840 
able to take it easy but any time you're

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:07.150 
able to take it easy but any time you're
playing<00:05:06.050> a<00:05:06.139> team<00:05:06.290> like<00:05:06.350> the<00:05:06.650> colts<00:05:06.860> you<00:05:07.040> know

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:07.160 
playing a team like the colts you know

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:08.290 
playing a team like the colts you know
that<00:05:07.340> is<00:05:07.430> not<00:05:07.610> going<00:05:07.700> to<00:05:07.760> be<00:05:07.880> the<00:05:07.970> case<00:05:08.120> it's

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:08.300 
that is not going to be the case it's

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:09.610 
that is not going to be the case it's
going<00:05:08.389> to<00:05:08.480> go<00:05:08.570> down<00:05:08.600> to<00:05:08.750> the<00:05:08.840> wire<00:05:09.020> and<00:05:09.080> you

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:09.620 
going to go down to the wire and you

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:10.810 
going to go down to the wire and you
know<00:05:09.710> i<00:05:09.740> think<00:05:09.919> the<00:05:10.010> advantage<00:05:10.130> they<00:05:10.610> had

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:10.820 
know i think the advantage they had

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:12.640 
know i think the advantage they had
coming<00:05:11.389> into<00:05:11.540> this<00:05:11.750> game<00:05:11.930> was<00:05:12.230> the<00:05:12.260> fact<00:05:12.530> that

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:12.650 
coming into this game was the fact that

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:13.810 
coming into this game was the fact that
hey<00:05:12.919> they've<00:05:13.100> been<00:05:13.250> there<00:05:13.370> three<00:05:13.550> years<00:05:13.580> ago

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:13.820 
hey they've been there three years ago

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:15.520 
hey they've been there three years ago
so<00:05:14.389> i<00:05:14.419> think<00:05:14.510> they<00:05:14.720> knew<00:05:14.930> kind<00:05:15.230> of<00:05:15.320> the

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:15.530 
so i think they knew kind of the

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:17.140 
so i think they knew kind of the
emotional<00:05:16.340> roller<00:05:16.490> coaster<00:05:16.610> and<00:05:17.000> how<00:05:17.090> to

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:17.150 
emotional roller coaster and how to

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.300 
emotional roller coaster and how to
manage<00:05:17.360> that<00:05:17.630> early<00:05:17.870> on<00:05:17.900> whereas<00:05:18.410> for<00:05:18.919> us<00:05:19.040> as

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:19.310 
manage that early on whereas for us as

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:21.760 
manage that early on whereas for us as
much<00:05:19.880> as<00:05:20.090> our<00:05:20.300> head<00:05:20.570> coach<00:05:20.810> sean<00:05:21.200> payton<00:05:21.230> tried

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:21.770 
much as our head coach sean payton tried

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:23.710 
much as our head coach sean payton tried
to<00:05:21.889> prepare<00:05:22.250> us<00:05:22.280> for<00:05:22.430> that<00:05:22.760> having<00:05:23.480> been<00:05:23.600> there

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:23.720
