people there could talk to the machine

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.560

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.570 
as if it was me but the extra engagement
that<00:01:24.630> robot<00:01:24.930> provides<00:01:25.290> makes<00:01:25.979> any<00:01:26.159> problems

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
that robot provides makes any problems

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.419 
that robot provides makes any problems
extra<00:01:26.970> frustrating

00:01:29.419 --> 00:01:29.429 
extra frustrating

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:32.099 
extra frustrating
so<00:01:30.429> we<00:01:31.030> didn't<00:01:31.210> catch<00:01:31.329> any<00:01:31.539> of<00:01:31.630> that<00:01:31.810> but<00:01:32.049> I

00:01:32.099 --> 00:01:32.109 
so we didn't catch any of that but I

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:34.550 
so we didn't catch any of that but I
realize<00:01:32.979> it<00:01:33.130> is<00:01:33.429> just<00:01:33.700> the<00:01:33.820> season<00:01:34.179> I<00:01:34.299> am
