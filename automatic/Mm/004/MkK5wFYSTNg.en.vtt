 breakfast we went to inexpensive 

00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:17.980
 institutions and I think in every city there 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:20.699
 is a place where you can cheap and 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.699
 eat well 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:25.840
 not very nice to be in another 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:28.120
 the city is homemade food and this is really 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.700
 It's really cool to really tasty 

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:33.010
 and at the same time go cheap and one more 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:35.080
 a nice plus for the budget tourist is 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.530
 also studies orders you can constantly 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.530
 pour boiling water 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:48.240
 and after having a snack I set off and 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.120
 dear from the city of tolyatti there is such 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:53.550
 a place like Khrushchev and I decided to go there 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.410
 set off on purpose 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.100

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.100

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.649

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:40.570

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:42.670

 you can look at every stone every 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.650

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:23.530
 will never return in our time but 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:24.100

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.000
 happiness 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.170
 sometimes even almost not necessary 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:12.260
 do anything or look for something like that 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:16.200

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.910
 I found a sketchbook in this store 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:46.410

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.830
 fiction 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:47.130

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:58.530
 he has not yet spoken his main reasons 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:01.800

 new microphone microphone samson and i 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:06.270
 ordered him to teach until the new year but 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.340
 Delivery was only in Russia and therefore 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:10.440
 there was a certain occasion 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:13.260

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:17.400
 it is on him and with this microphone neither 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:18.750
 it's much easier to work and I don't 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:22.140
 have to repeat the same phrase 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:24.270
 10 times and up to the possible microphone was 

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:27.030
 the reason for the trip itself but this trip 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:28.980

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:30.510
