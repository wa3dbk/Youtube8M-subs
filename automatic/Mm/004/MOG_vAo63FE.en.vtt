00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
biological mystery chromosomes which

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.760 
belong to divide has baffled scientists
up<00:00:38.460> to<00:00:38.579> now<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:39.660> reason<00:00:39.840> for<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.230> mystery<00:00:40.620> is

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
up to now the reason for the mystery is

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.770 
up to now the reason for the mystery is
that<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.280> ends<00:00:41.579> of<00:00:41.700> chromosomes<00:00:42.090> called

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
that the ends of chromosomes called

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.920 
that the ends of chromosomes called
telomeres<00:00:43.320> cannot<00:00:44.100> duplicate<00:00:44.399> but<00:00:45.390> even<00:00:45.660> so

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
telomeres cannot duplicate but even so

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.619 
telomeres cannot duplicate but even so
exact<00:00:46.829> copies<00:00:47.309> of<00:00:47.340> chromosomes<00:00:48.000> are<00:00:48.210> produced

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
exact copies of chromosomes are produced

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.520 
exact copies of chromosomes are produced
after<00:00:48.870> cells<00:00:49.680> divide<00:00:50.100> so<00:00:50.910> how<00:00:51.379> that's<00:00:52.379> what

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
after cells divide so how that's what

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.619 
after cells divide so how that's what
the<00:00:52.649> scientists<00:00:53.100> have<00:00:53.399> discovered<00:00:53.629> will

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
the scientists have discovered will

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.810 
the scientists have discovered will
release<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.320> last<00:00:55.530> four<00:00:55.890> telomeres<00:00:56.340> and<00:00:56.430> so

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
release the last four telomeres and so

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.180 
release the last four telomeres and so
chromosomes<00:00:57.510> themselves<00:00:58.260> should<00:00:58.710> shorten

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
chromosomes themselves should shorten

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.400 
chromosomes themselves should shorten
every<00:00:59.489> time<00:00:59.699> a<00:00:59.850> cell<00:00:59.879> divides<00:01:00.410> these

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
every time a cell divides these

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.349 
every time a cell divides these
scientists<00:01:02.100> have<00:01:02.280> showed<00:01:02.550> that<00:01:02.730> an<00:01:02.940> enzyme

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
scientists have showed that an enzyme

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.240 
scientists have showed that an enzyme
called<00:01:03.390> telomerase<00:01:03.830> which<00:01:04.830> is<00:01:04.979> what<00:01:05.129> the

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
called telomerase which is what the

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.399 
called telomerase which is what the
telomeres<00:01:05.820> are<00:01:05.909> made<00:01:06.180> of<00:01:06.360> can<00:01:06.869> replace<00:01:07.229> the

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
telomeres are made of can replace the

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.530 
telomeres are made of can replace the
lost<00:01:07.560> nuclides<00:01:08.189> and<00:01:08.549> thus<00:01:08.880> maintain<00:01:09.390> the

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
lost nuclides and thus maintain the

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.260 
lost nuclides and thus maintain the
chromosome<00:01:10.080> keeping<00:01:10.500> it<00:01:10.590> from<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:10.920> grady

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270
