00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
a lower rpm when it's in neutral you can

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.120 
a lower rpm when it's in neutral you can
adjust<00:01:13.740> it<00:01:13.830> there<00:01:14.040> not<00:01:14.310> all<00:01:14.430> bikes<00:01:14.640> have<00:01:14.820> that

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
adjust it there not all bikes have that

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.030 
adjust it there not all bikes have that
okay<00:01:17.130> so<00:01:17.909> as<00:01:18.750> I<00:01:18.900> said<00:01:19.080> most<00:01:19.259> bikes<00:01:19.560> have<00:01:19.799> either

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
okay so as I said most bikes have either

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.010 
okay so as I said most bikes have either
five<00:01:20.369> or<00:01:20.720> six<00:01:22.009> speeds<00:01:23.060> the<00:01:24.060> when<00:01:24.689> you<00:01:24.780> start

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
five or six speeds the when you start

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.450 
five or six speeds the when you start
your<00:01:25.140> bike<00:01:25.229> you<00:01:25.380> want<00:01:25.439> have<00:01:26.070> it<00:01:26.189> in<00:01:26.280> neutral

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
your bike you want have it in neutral

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.219 
your bike you want have it in neutral
make<00:01:26.939> sure<00:01:27.090> this<00:01:28.369> this<00:01:29.369> is<00:01:29.610> in<00:01:30.299> neutral<00:01:30.990> and

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
make sure this this is in neutral and

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.190 
make sure this this is in neutral and
check<00:01:31.799> your<00:01:31.950> bike<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.939> gauge<00:01:33.570> cluster<00:01:33.990> for

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
check your bike the gauge cluster for

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.490 
check your bike the gauge cluster for
the<00:01:34.290> green<00:01:34.500> light<00:01:34.530> that<00:01:34.950> often<00:01:35.310> indicate<00:01:35.670> it

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
the green light that often indicate it

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.319

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
that's where you need to learn where the

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.130 
that's where you need to learn where the
friction<00:01:50.700> zone<00:01:50.729> is<00:01:51.090> on<00:01:51.240> your<00:01:51.360> on<00:01:51.689> your<00:01:51.899> clutch

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.130 
straight in a neutral which is half a
click<00:02:49.440> so<00:02:50.340> now<00:02:50.519> we're<00:02:50.700> in<00:02:50.790> neutral<00:02:50.940> again<00:02:51.390> at<00:02:52.049> a

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
click so now we're in neutral again at a

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.030 
click so now we're in neutral again at a
stoplight<00:02:53.720> from<00:02:54.720> here<00:02:55.049> you<00:02:55.440> want<00:02:55.560> to<00:02:55.680> kick<00:02:55.920> it

stoplight from here you want to kick it
into<00:02:56.160> first<00:02:56.459> again<00:02:56.840> so<00:02:57.840> you<00:02:57.930> kick<00:02:58.290> down<00:02:58.620> into

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
into first again so you kick down into

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.569 
into first again so you kick down into
first<00:02:59.400> now<00:02:59.849> you're<00:03:00.000> in<00:03:00.060> first<00:03:00.470> a<00:03:01.470> big<00:03:02.220> question

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:02.579 
first now you're in first a big question

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:04.250 
first now you're in first a big question
a<00:03:02.670> lot<00:03:02.760> of<00:03:02.880> people<00:03:03.090> have<00:03:03.269> and<00:03:03.480> I<00:03:03.660> certainly<00:03:03.900> had

a lot of people have and I certainly had

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.339 
a lot of people have and I certainly had
was<00:03:04.500> what<00:03:05.400> do<00:03:05.489> you<00:03:05.549> do<00:03:05.760> from<00:03:06.510> first<00:03:06.810> a<00:03:06.959> second

00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:07.349 
was what do you do from first a second

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:09.530 
was what do you do from first a second
do<00:03:07.470> you<00:03:07.530> have<00:03:07.739> to<00:03:07.860> go<00:03:08.010> into<00:03:08.250> neutral<00:03:08.760> while

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
do you have to go into neutral while

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.319 
do you have to go into neutral while
going<00:03:09.780> into<00:03:10.140> second<00:03:10.530> the<00:03:11.340> answer<00:03:11.609> is<00:03:11.790> yes<00:03:12.120> and

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:12.329 
going into second the answer is yes and

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:15.440 
going into second the answer is yes and
no<00:03:12.799> when<00:03:13.799> you<00:03:13.920> go<00:03:14.130> from<00:03:14.340> first<00:03:14.700> into<00:03:15.060> second

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
no when you go from first into second

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.259 
no when you go from first into second
you'll<00:03:15.630> pass<00:03:15.900> neutral<00:03:16.819> neutral<00:03:17.819> is<00:03:17.910> a<00:03:17.970> half

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
you'll pass neutral neutral is a half

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:21.710 
you'll pass neutral neutral is a half
step<00:03:18.510> above<00:03:19.260> first<00:03:19.980> and<00:03:20.340> a<00:03:20.819> half<00:03:21.030> step<00:03:21.359> below

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
step above first and a half step below

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.660 
step above first and a half step below
second<00:03:22.530> so<00:03:22.859> when<00:03:23.010> you're<00:03:23.130> shifting<00:03:23.459> in<00:03:23.579> a

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
second so when you're shifting in a

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.940 
second so when you're shifting in a
second<00:03:24.060> from<00:03:24.900> first<00:03:24.930> we're<00:03:25.440> in<00:03:25.530> first<00:03:25.769> now

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
second from first we're in first now

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.640 
second from first we're in first now
you'll<00:03:26.340> shift<00:03:26.609> up<00:03:27.180> and<00:03:27.510> it'll<00:03:27.930> go<00:03:28.139> directly

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
you'll shift up and it'll go directly

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.449 
you'll shift up and it'll go directly
into<00:03:28.889> second<00:03:29.400> a<00:03:29.519> full<00:03:30.299> shift<00:03:30.739> if<00:03:31.739> from<00:03:32.130> first

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
into second a full shift if from first

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.879 
into second a full shift if from first
you<00:03:32.880> want<00:03:33.030> to<00:03:33.090> shift<00:03:33.329> into<00:03:33.600> neutral<00:03:33.630> you'll<00:03:34.590> go

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:34.889 
you want to shift into neutral you'll go

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:38.360 
you want to shift into neutral you'll go
up<00:03:35.010> a<00:03:35.160> half<00:03:35.400> a<00:03:35.579> click<00:03:35.819> in<00:03:36.060> the<00:03:36.569> neutral<00:03:37.370> your

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
up a half a click in the neutral your

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:39.620 
up a half a click in the neutral your
green<00:03:38.579> light<00:03:38.760> will<00:03:38.880> come<00:03:38.970> on<00:03:39.120> your<00:03:39.299> instrument

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
green light will come on your instrument

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:42.289 
green light will come on your instrument
cluster<00:03:39.690> and<00:03:40.230> you<00:03:41.190> will<00:03:41.340> find<00:03:41.639> yourself<00:03:42.060> in

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 
cluster and you will find yourself in

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:46.970 
cluster and you will find yourself in
neutral<00:03:44.180> another<00:03:45.180> another<00:03:45.840> method<00:03:46.680> of<00:03:46.769> down

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
neutral another another method of down

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.220 
neutral another another method of down
shifting<00:03:47.430> for<00:03:47.760> guys<00:03:47.880> is<00:03:48.209> what<00:03:48.959> they'll<00:03:49.079> do

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
shifting for guys is what they'll do

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:50.420 
shifting for guys is what they'll do
when<00:03:49.349> they're<00:03:49.500> coming<00:03:49.709> up<00:03:49.769> to<00:03:49.859> a<00:03:49.919> stoplight

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
when they're coming up to a stoplight

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:55.580 
when they're coming up to a stoplight
we're<00:03:50.849> in<00:03:50.940> six<00:03:51.239> now<00:03:51.450> so<00:03:51.810> two<00:03:52.769> three<00:03:53.639> four<00:03:54.590> five

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
we're in six now so two three four five

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.789 
we're in six now so two three four five
six<00:03:56.549> all<00:03:56.940> right<00:03:57.000> we're<00:03:57.269> in<00:03:57.299> six<00:03:57.660> when<00:03:58.590> coming

00:03:58.789 --> 00:03:58.799 
six all right we're in six when coming

00:03:58.799 --> 00:03:59.900 
six all right we're in six when coming
up<00:03:58.859> to<00:03:58.950> a<00:03:58.980> stoplight<00:03:59.250> what<00:03:59.519> they'll<00:03:59.639> do<00:03:59.790> is

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
up to a stoplight what they'll do is

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.979 
up to a stoplight what they'll do is
they'll<00:04:00.090> downshift<00:04:01.970> sequentially<00:04:02.989> and

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
they'll downshift sequentially and

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:08.130 
they'll downshift sequentially and
they'll<00:04:04.139> squeeze<00:04:04.349> in<00:04:04.590> the<00:04:05.340> clutch

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:08.140 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:11.010 

downshift<00:04:08.680> into<00:04:09.040> 5th<00:04:09.340> kickdown<00:04:09.870> they'll<00:04:10.870> let

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:11.020 
downshift into 5th kickdown they'll let

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:12.890 
downshift into 5th kickdown they'll let
their<00:04:11.170> clutch<00:04:11.410> out<00:04:11.620> so<00:04:12.100> the<00:04:12.220> engine<00:04:12.550> actually

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
their clutch out so the engine actually

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.600 
their clutch out so the engine actually
doesn't<00:04:13.900> most<00:04:14.110> of<00:04:14.290> the<00:04:14.380> braking<00:04:14.710> for<00:04:14.950> you<00:04:15.100> so

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:15.610 
doesn't most of the braking for you so

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:16.920 
doesn't most of the braking for you so
now<00:04:15.760> you're<00:04:15.880> in<00:04:15.970> fifth<00:04:16.270> they're<00:04:16.660> going<00:04:16.780> to<00:04:16.840> let

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
now you're in fifth they're going to let

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:18.720 
now you're in fifth they're going to let
the<00:04:17.050> clutch<00:04:17.260> out<00:04:17.470> I'm<00:04:18.280> going<00:04:18.430> to<00:04:18.489> squeeze<00:04:18.670> the

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:18.730 
the clutch out I'm going to squeeze the

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:19.290 
the clutch out I'm going to squeeze the
clutch<00:04:18.850> in<00:04:19.030> again

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:19.300 
clutch in again

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:22.470 
clutch in again
downshift<00:04:19.770> an<00:04:20.770> hour<00:04:20.890> and<00:04:21.100> forth<00:04:21.370> let<00:04:22.360> the

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:22.480 
downshift an hour and forth let the

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:26.310 
downshift an hour and forth let the
clutch<00:04:22.720> out<00:04:22.930> it'll<00:04:23.890> slow<00:04:24.370> down<00:04:24.610> more<00:04:25.320> squeeze

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 
clutch out it'll slow down more squeeze
