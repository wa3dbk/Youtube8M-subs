00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.709 
wide-angle zoom and the Sigma 8 to 16 is
my<00:00:36.750> choice<00:00:37.079> and<00:00:37.410> there's<00:00:38.340> also<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.969> Canon<00:00:39.450> 10

my choice and there's also the Canon 10

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.560 
my choice and there's also the Canon 10
to<00:00:39.899> 22<00:00:40.469> which<00:00:40.710> is<00:00:40.860> very<00:00:41.160> good<00:00:41.550> my<00:00:42.239> choice<00:00:42.540> for

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
to 22 which is very good my choice for

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.709 
to 22 which is very good my choice for
the<00:00:42.780> Sigma<00:00:43.379> is<00:00:43.559> because<00:00:44.309> it's<00:00:45.120> a<00:00:45.270> little<00:00:45.510> bit

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
the Sigma is because it's a little bit

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.540 
the Sigma is because it's a little bit
wider<00:00:45.899> I<00:00:46.110> like<00:00:46.350> that<00:00:46.530> extra<00:00:46.739> 2<00:00:47.010> millimeters

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
wider I like that extra 2 millimeters

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.910 
wider I like that extra 2 millimeters
when<00:00:48.059> you're<00:00:48.239> already<00:00:48.690> this<00:00:49.110> wide

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
when you're already this wide

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.610 
when you're already this wide
that's<00:00:50.309> very<00:00:50.640> wide<00:00:51.030> at<00:00:51.270> at<00:00:51.449> 10<00:00:51.809> but<00:00:52.410> when<00:00:52.530> you

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
that's very wide at at 10 but when you

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.369 
that's very wide at at 10 but when you
go<00:00:52.710> to<00:00:52.739> 8<00:00:53.129> that<00:00:53.460> 2<00:00:53.730> millimeters<00:00:54.300> is<00:00:54.510> is<00:00:54.809> a<00:00:54.870> lot

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
go to 8 that 2 millimeters is is a lot

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.110 
go to 8 that 2 millimeters is is a lot
bigger<00:00:55.649> than<00:00:55.770> you<00:00:55.920> might<00:00:56.160> think<00:00:56.190> it<00:00:56.550> is<00:00:56.610> it's<00:00:57.000> a

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
bigger than you might think it is it's a

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.220 
bigger than you might think it is it's a
big<00:00:57.690> much<00:00:58.170> wider<00:00:59.180> angle<00:01:00.180> of<00:01:00.329> coverage<00:01:00.989> of<00:01:01.199> a

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
big much wider angle of coverage of a

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.359 
big much wider angle of coverage of a
bigger<00:01:01.590> field<00:01:01.920> of<00:01:02.160> view<00:01:02.460> wider<00:01:02.850> so<00:01:04.040> to<00:01:05.040> me<00:01:05.159> the

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
bigger field of view wider so to me the

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.789 
bigger field of view wider so to me the
8<00:01:05.519> to<00:01:05.670> 16<00:01:05.939> is<00:01:06.270> excellent<00:01:06.900> it's<00:01:07.020> very<00:01:07.200> sharp<00:01:07.530> so

have<00:01:57.960> problems<00:01:58.350> with<00:01:58.439> the<00:01:58.560> is<00:01:58.829> motor<00:01:59.130> or<00:01:59.310> other

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
have problems with the is motor or other

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.429 
have problems with the is motor or other
quality<00:01:59.880> control<00:02:00.180> issues<00:02:00.540> so<00:02:01.079> one<00:02:01.259> of<00:02:01.290> those

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
quality control issues so one of those

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.649 
quality control issues so one of those
two<00:02:01.500> mid-range<00:02:01.979> zooms<00:02:02.610> and<00:02:02.820> then<00:02:03.540> you're

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
two mid-range zooms and then you're

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.660 
two mid-range zooms and then you're
gonna<00:02:03.780> want<00:02:04.079> something<00:02:04.380> in<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:04.860> long<00:02:05.130> range

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
gonna want something in the long range

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.339 
gonna want something in the long range
zoom<00:02:06.240> so<00:02:06.950> the<00:02:07.950> 55<00:02:08.369> to<00:02:08.399> 250<00:02:09.209> is<00:02:09.390> is<00:02:09.959> great

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
zoom so the 55 to 250 is is great

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.020 
zoom so the 55 to 250 is is great
usually<00:02:10.950> when<00:02:11.099> you're<00:02:11.220> shooting<00:02:11.370> landscapes

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
usually when you're shooting landscapes

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.790 
usually when you're shooting landscapes
you've<00:02:12.209> got<00:02:12.390> daylight<00:02:12.810> so<00:02:13.050> you<00:02:13.140> don't<00:02:13.319> need<00:02:13.470> a

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
you've got daylight so you don't need a

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.370 
you've got daylight so you don't need a
cleanse<00:02:14.130> so<00:02:14.370> the<00:02:14.460> 55<00:02:14.880> to<00:02:14.910> 250<00:02:15.570> is<00:02:15.690> is<00:02:15.960> good<00:02:16.170> for

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
cleanse so the 55 to 250 is is good for

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.710 
cleanse so the 55 to 250 is is good for
that<00:02:16.470> it's<00:02:17.160> small<00:02:17.700> lightweight<00:02:18.270> and<00:02:18.450> compact

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
that it's small lightweight and compact

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.230 
that it's small lightweight and compact
this<00:02:19.290> is<00:02:19.470> really<00:02:19.830> good<00:02:20.010> for<00:02:20.160> taking<00:02:20.580> in<00:02:20.910> a

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
this is really good for taking in a

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.700 
this is really good for taking in a
knapsack<00:02:21.450> and<00:02:21.900> whatnot<00:02:22.170> so<00:02:22.410> you're<00:02:22.560> not

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
knapsack and whatnot so you're not

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.280 
knapsack and whatnot so you're not
getting<00:02:23.100> very<00:02:23.250> heavy<00:02:23.540> however<00:02:24.540> if<00:02:24.810> you're

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
getting very heavy however if you're

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.880 
getting very heavy however if you're
wanting<00:02:25.530> more<00:02:25.860> reach<00:02:26.130> a<00:02:26.520> little<00:02:26.730> bit<00:02:26.850> better

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
wanting more reach a little bit better

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.290 
wanting more reach a little bit better
faster<00:02:28.890> lens<00:02:29.100> and<00:02:29.400> whatnot<00:02:29.700> you<00:02:29.910> might<00:02:30.090> want

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
faster lens and whatnot you might want

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.980 
faster lens and whatnot you might want
to<00:02:30.360> look<00:02:30.570> at<00:02:30.720> the<00:02:30.840> canon<00:02:31.230> 70<00:02:31.620> to<00:02:31.710> 200<00:02:31.860> f/4<00:02:32.490> l

f/4l is I don't recommend the f28 here

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.690

you<00:02:37.020> don't<00:02:37.200> really<00:02:37.410> need<00:02:37.710> the<00:02:37.920> f28<00:02:38.430> for<00:02:38.640> a

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
you don't really need the f28 for a

you don't really need the f28 for a

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
but it gives you out to 400 it gives you

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.910 
but it gives you out to 400 it gives you

the<00:03:37.170> other<00:03:37.290> option<00:03:37.709> 2<00:03:37.860> would<00:03:37.890> be<00:03:38.040> the<00:03:38.160> Sigma<00:03:39.230> 70

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
the other option 2 would be the Sigma 70

to<00:03:40.320> 200<00:03:40.470> f28<00:03:41.280> again<00:03:41.970> I<00:03:42.180> don't<00:03:42.450> necessarily

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
to 200 f28 again I don't necessarily

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:43.790 
to 200 f28 again I don't necessarily
recommend<00:03:42.959> it<00:03:43.350> because<00:03:43.440> you<00:03:43.560> don't<00:03:43.709> really

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:43.800 
recommend it because you don't really

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.190 
recommend it because you don't really
need<00:03:44.010> the<00:03:44.160> 2:8<00:03:44.459> for<00:03:44.640> landscapes<00:03:45.180> but<00:03:46.080> an

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
need the 2:8 for landscapes but an

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.150 
need the 2:8 for landscapes but an
option<00:03:46.560> as<00:03:46.680> well

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
the other thing you would probably want

wouldn't even need the long zooms or
even<00:04:23.130> the<00:04:23.220> mid-range<00:04:23.580> because<00:04:23.940> they<00:04:24.090> want<00:04:24.270> to

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
even the mid-range because they want to

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.480 
even the mid-range because they want to
shoot<00:04:24.539> entirely<00:04:24.990> wide<00:04:25.500> so<00:04:26.130> you<00:04:26.190> can't<00:04:26.310> have<00:04:26.370> to
