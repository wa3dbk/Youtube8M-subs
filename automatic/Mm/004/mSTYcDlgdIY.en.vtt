inside this vein it's called capsaicin
all<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:05.789> seeds<00:02:06.030> in<00:02:06.119> the<00:02:06.240> veins<00:02:06.420> carry<00:02:06.630> most<00:02:06.869> of

00:02:06.949 --> 00:02:06.959 
all the seeds in the veins carry most of

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:08.389 
all the seeds in the veins carry most of
the<00:02:07.049> heat<00:02:07.229> so<00:02:07.439> if<00:02:07.530> you<00:02:07.619> want<00:02:07.770> it<00:02:07.830> to<00:02:07.920> be<00:02:08.069> a

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
the heat so if you want it to be a

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.550 
the heat so if you want it to be a
little<00:02:08.670> bit<00:02:08.940> more<00:02:09.209> mild<00:02:09.599> you<00:02:10.140> just<00:02:10.319> cut<00:02:10.470> in

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
little bit more mild you just cut in

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.220 
little bit more mild you just cut in
half<00:02:10.739> and<00:02:11.039> get<00:02:11.489> lid<00:02:11.819> of<00:02:12.690> the<00:02:12.840> vein<00:02:13.019> on<00:02:13.049> the

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
half and get lid of the vein on the

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.330 
half and get lid of the vein on the
inside<00:02:13.650> like<00:02:14.549> so<00:02:14.819> you're<00:02:15.630> developing<00:02:15.840> seeds

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
inside like so you're developing seeds

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.839 
inside like so you're developing seeds
and<00:02:17.340> then<00:02:18.299> you're<00:02:18.420> left<00:02:18.599> with<00:02:19.410> just<00:02:19.849> the
