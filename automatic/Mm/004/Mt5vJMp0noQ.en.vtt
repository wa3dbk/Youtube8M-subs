00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:12.530
 good in this class I want to explain now 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.949
 for you 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:18.320
 the formation of minor chords 

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:20.270
 I explained how the larger ones worked. 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.710
 now explain how minors work 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:23.119
 what is the secret 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:26.390
 when you hear the person say by 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:27.499
 example but I want there minor note if 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.240
 smaller 

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:33.500
 it's these chords that I'll explain as 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:39.250
 good training is unheard of in the 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:44.570
 music we only have seven that are do 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:47.060
 From there comes everything that is of music everything that 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:50.090
 comes from music comes from bags 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:53.600
 so the smaller ones could not be 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:01:02.300
 different from the one you already know 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:01:07.520
 which is composed of three keys from the 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:08.920
 explanation for you to understand better and 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.399
 easy way 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:19.429
 the minor chords are as follows 

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:21.770
 I have three keys on the first key on the 

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:23.659
 middle finger on middle key 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:27.069
 the first key next to it 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:30.409
 her until she gives herself to her 

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:33.829
 left will turn the best by 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:37.119
 example me the first land on the left 

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:42.380
 name is another 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:44.659
 then you better see if the little finger here 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.689
 way to the left that in the first 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:49.009
 land will turn out to be the least because 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:53.740
 such greater 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:59.389
 and here the sad sound is the soft sound now 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:02:01.990
 The greater the greater is to know if we are going or 

00:01:59.389 --> 00:02:01.990
 strong right? 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:13.630
 this rule will work for everyone 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.630
 Let's go up and it 's bigger 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:25.450
 the first key to the left is the fact that 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:27.950
 work only aggressive soft sound 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:32.180
 I'm using both hands for you. 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:34.280
 to visualize me better was the 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:40.810
 first the left button the sun then 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:40.810
 Come on, they 'll sound sad and just need to. 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:50.069
 first key on the left is would only be 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:03:02.010
 so come on 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:03:04.109
 most smaller and sun most sun 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:07.409
 first the left button the loop 

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:14.329
 terrible we were in the smaller room only 

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:19.290
 higher or lower or higher or lower 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:29.930
 the first key on the left is the 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:29.930
 greater domino the greater promise if 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:43.319
 the first key to the left or 

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:46.859
 is not greater the greater s if better to the minor 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:48.329
 I am the saddest of all that I am. 

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:51.269
 greater aggressiveness 

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:58.040
 the lesser if an actress 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:58.040
 okay now and never after another the best 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:14.360
 it is smaller and smaller family the smaller sun there 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:17.120
 smaller and cinema 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:32.290
 You'll work on the right hands. 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:32.290
 Kisses on a 2 and 4 3 coming back 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:52.300
 Once again I hope you train. 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:54.880
 enough that this can be useful and 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:58.120
 Remember what I say, always look for 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:00.160
 switch seeks not only to train in order 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:06.040
 train appropriately as you 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:08.800
 said O domino matches worth you 

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:11.800
 already a combination of the smaller is not a 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:14.680
 logical sequence with logical harmony I 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:17.080
 I know but it will help you look for bodies 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.520
 which are far from each other and this 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:22.120
 will make you train the 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:29.010
 location of the minor 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:29.010
 I'll be back to run smaller lower and smaller 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:38.110
 now I'm going to be smaller now. 

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:39.730
 I'm going to retail it and so on 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:41.650
 and then you can make a combination 

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:45.100
 also more ahead 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:48.360
 a different agreement ok good lessons for 

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:48.360
 that you have a great advantage
