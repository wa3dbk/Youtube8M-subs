00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 hi to all today i answer the 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:04.440
 question that have to congratulate the geek 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 they have a taste for food 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.870
 for animals 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.000
 yes we all already requested 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.280
 seeing a dog or a cat eat his 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.870
 croquettes if it was good or not 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.580
 I will sacrifice myself to finally answer 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.570
 to this question that is turning us all 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.800
 these parties good then before I 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.689
 start I want to clarify that the 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.220
 questions we are not challenges 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.689
 it's really answers to 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.279
 questions that many people are asking 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.810
 So here's the idea is not to know 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.340
 if I'm able to eat 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.869
 dog food or pâté 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.759
 for cats and to describe you taste 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.040
 that for that I have croquettes for 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.079
 dog of the cat food pie 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.579
 for fish and for birds and there 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.079
 I feel like I'm going 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:47.280
 so let's start with the most 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:48.539
 classic croquettes ca ca stinks the 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.280

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.850

 it's not not specially 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.250
 disgusting we do that just a texture 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:13.110
 super super dryer that pumps you all 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:15.540
 down to 6 and a little disgusting there is a 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.970
 back taste super acid adam that's 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.880
 disgusting oh fucking a mega blow to the 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:25.409
 defense is rated dehydrated poultry 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.790
 thousand animal fats of beverages the 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.380

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.079
 that it's illegal because that but 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.280
 the after-taste is really bad and 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.299
 speaking of dogs I discovered a 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.570
 something that did not last long that made me 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.070
 to laugh 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.840
 there is a city in France called 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.759
 villechien and the inhabitants the bass 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.259
 Called doggies and doggies 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.270
 comfortable life like what the administration 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.590
 French is also making jokes 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.149
 go kibble dog is 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.720
 done now we go to the mash for 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:55.350
 cat oh what do I do with my life 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.969
 in name to name to no no no no 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.500
 so as you can see I 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:00.390
 I'm about to eat what looks like 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.520
 vomit a little bit so against that are 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.869
 very good it looks like what is it at 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.990
 chicken to these idiots because it smells of 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.990
 your 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.280
 then there is a kind of gelatin that 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.170
 I will try to avoid I will 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.790
 bring closer to what is most 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:16.690
 normal food is the ends 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:29.800
 of chicken who smell the tone to the east 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:34.000
 hugo go for ok then it's swallow 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.890
 that's it, it's oddly so 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.970
 also greedy 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.190
 it's okay it's not so disgusting 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.660
 that that's the real weird thing 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.740
 that you were going this kind of gelatin 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.960
 around the pieces of meat 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:45.850
 you really have the impression of swallowing a 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.530
 glaviot taxes so that's really the 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.750
 only thing that bothered me if not at 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.150
 level of taste it lacks salt 1 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.890
 if I really want a little quibble but 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.150
 it's okay it's not disgusting I do not 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.620
 will not take a second spoon but 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.820
 it's not too bad if for us 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.350
 it's not dangerous to eat 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.490
 cat food or dog food 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.080
 must still know that one to this 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:03.430
 is not true for example chocolate 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.020
 it's very bad for cats 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.459
 and dogs can make them blind 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.930
 and even downright killing them so 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:09.580
 now avoid their son and your 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.780
 old easter it's for their good 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.310
 I must have you two 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.110
 other stuff and frankly I have more 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:17.650
 so want but go courage 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:19.420
 oh that's the food for fish and 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.400
 frankly that a smell of death if a 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.660
 day I must be reincarnated I hope that 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.620
 it will not be in goldfish because 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:23.890
 it really looks like pigs who 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:24.970
 food 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.470
 good, that's like it's small 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.670
 glitter like that I'm going to put 3 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.910
 on my finger and then I 'm going to them 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:29.910
 snacks 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:37.670
 it looks like dried beef in fact and 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:41.060
 it's not so disgusting 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:44.270
 frankly what is bone salt is hello 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:45.380
 would not eat but but it's okay actually 

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:46.430
 the goldfish is fine with me 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.660
 l'internation then it's very weird 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.730
 because there is animal feed 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:52.310
 who smell very good but who actually 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:54.620
 disgusting and alain yards stuff one 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:56.150
 little like this one who stinks death but 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.560
 that are not that bad is going 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.870
 goes to the last loop for the 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.230
 birds there is written sesame honey on the 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:01.819
 box 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:02.900
 so either do you want not used by 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:04.819
 in other ways after the food for 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:07.340
 shay for dog I believe that everything will have 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:09.200
 taste of hamburgers for me the little 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:10.730
 nice packaging like an ear of 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.739
 corn do what good then already that 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:13.760
 without anything so I have trouble imagining the 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:15.260
 goat that can have but good at the same 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.519
 time it's seeds so it must not 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.519
 to be bad so how do i get on 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.880
 it's disgusting fucking actually the 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:32.900
 seeds in themselves they have no taste 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:35.690
 but there are black truffle species 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:37.940
 who has good grass but grass on 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:38.990
 which a cat would have urinated a whore 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.610
 strongly that I eat pasta at 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.870
 ketchup what then that's geek felix 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.729
 I have the answer to your question 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:45.140
 pet food and ben that's 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:46.400
 really not good then we could 

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:47.660
 believe it's subjective because we 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.280
 does not have all the same tastes but 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:50.990
 frankly con it's disgusting its beginnings 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.610
 on the other hand the animals and must serious 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:54.410
 kiffe but hey if I had the classes 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:56.360
 and from the best to the worst I would say that the 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:58.610
 first position comes back to the food 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:59.840
 for fish that I almost was born 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.490
 I may be a little weird after 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:03.350
 in second but very food for char 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.550
 then the birds is then last the 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:05.240
 dog that was really but 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:06.770
 disgusting 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.390
 if this question we liked you do not hesitate 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:11.620
 not liked the video to share it and 

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:11.620
 especially slaughterhouses 

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:29.069
 short but what happens to me
