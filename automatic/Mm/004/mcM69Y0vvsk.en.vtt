particularly well when juiced and

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.440 
particularly well when juiced and
they're<00:01:37.409> a<00:01:37.439> detoxifying<00:01:38.400> agent<00:01:38.640> which<00:01:39.060> also

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
they're a detoxifying agent which also

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.600 
they're a detoxifying agent which also
gives<00:01:39.659> you<00:01:39.780> an<00:01:39.869> energy<00:01:40.049> boost<00:01:40.290> so<00:01:41.280> let's<00:01:41.460> get

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
gives you an energy boost so let's get

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.670 
gives you an energy boost so let's get
juicing<00:01:42.119> so<00:01:42.360> let's<00:01:42.540> power<00:01:42.869> up<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.170> juicer

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:56.649 

stop<00:01:46.340> we<00:01:46.550> got<00:01:46.700> parrots

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:56.659 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:02.830 

so<00:01:57.659> that<00:01:57.840> an<00:01:58.049> apple

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:14.230
