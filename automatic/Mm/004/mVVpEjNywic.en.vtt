00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
because we have the HD style phases now

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.789 
because we have the HD style phases now
but<00:01:35.970> we<00:01:36.060> don't<00:01:36.240> have<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.600> actual<00:01:36.750> HD<00:01:37.350> faces

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 
yeah there's gonna be an HD resolution

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.920 
yeah there's gonna be an HD resolution
get<00:01:46.680> it<00:01:46.829> like<00:01:47.549> revolution<00:01:47.939> but<00:01:48.360> resolution

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930
