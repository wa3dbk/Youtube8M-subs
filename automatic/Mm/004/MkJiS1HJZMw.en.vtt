00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
remember that you're going to want to

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.799

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
check later that maybe you can't

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.049 
check later that maybe you can't
necessarily<00:01:00.960> do<00:01:01.590> now<00:01:01.829> because<00:01:02.399> you<00:01:02.820> can't

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
necessarily do now because you can't

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.189 
necessarily do now because you can't
really<00:01:03.270> tell<00:01:03.480> what<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.690> other<00:01:03.809> sounds<00:01:04.140> are

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199

might want to do that like you know a

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.710 
might want to do that like you know a
synth<00:01:07.830> frequency<00:01:08.430> cutoff<00:01:08.729> you<00:01:09.330> know<00:01:09.450> some

thing that you kind of didn't like but
you<00:01:32.700> didn't<00:01:32.909> really<00:01:33.030> change<00:01:33.329> and<00:01:33.780> that's

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
you didn't really change and that's

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.600 
you didn't really change and that's
really<00:01:34.170> not<00:01:34.290> a<00:01:34.350> big<00:01:34.470> deal<00:01:34.530> but<00:01:35.070> then<00:01:35.250> when<00:01:35.400> one

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
really not a big deal but then when one

sucks so anyway take a look here in here

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.929 
sucks so anyway take a look here in here
on<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.299> on<00:01:45.930> my<00:01:46.170> set<00:01:46.439> on<00:01:46.710> my<00:01:46.860> nice<00:01:47.040> new<00:01:47.280> LCD

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
on the on my set on my nice new LCD

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.560 
on the on my set on my nice new LCD
screen<00:01:49.460> so<00:01:50.460> first<00:01:50.759> four<00:01:50.970> tracks<00:01:51.270> these<00:01:51.450> are

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
screen so first four tracks these are

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.260 
screen so first four tracks these are
just<00:01:51.659> some<00:01:51.810> loops<00:01:52.049> I<00:01:52.820> don't<00:01:53.820> I'm<00:01:54.000> actually

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
just some loops I don't I'm actually

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.109 
just some loops I don't I'm actually
getting<00:01:54.540> really<00:01:54.960> away<00:01:55.229> from<00:01:55.500> loops<00:01:56.060> but<00:01:57.060> I

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
getting really away from loops but I

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.499 
getting really away from loops but I
have<00:01:57.450> them<00:01:57.810> in<00:01:57.840> my<00:01:58.020> template<00:01:58.649> just<00:01:58.950> because

00:01:59.499 --> 00:01:59.509 
have them in my template just because

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:01.969 
have them in my template just because
sometimes<00:02:00.509> I<00:02:00.570> can<00:02:00.719> cut<00:02:00.990> a<00:02:01.020> sample<00:02:01.590> out<00:02:01.649> of<00:02:01.860> them

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
sometimes I can cut a sample out of them

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.560 
sometimes I can cut a sample out of them
or<00:02:02.219> you<00:02:02.549> know<00:02:02.670> there's<00:02:03.030> a<00:02:03.060> lot<00:02:03.090> you<00:02:03.240> can<00:02:03.420> do

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
or you know there's a lot you can do

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.660 
or you know there's a lot you can do
with<00:02:03.600> just<00:02:03.750> a<00:02:03.960> one<00:02:04.140> shot<00:02:04.409> out<00:02:04.649> of<00:02:04.680> the<00:02:04.829> out<00:02:05.310> of

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
with just a one shot out of the out of

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.459 
with just a one shot out of the out of
there<00:02:05.909> but<00:02:06.030> anyway<00:02:06.240> that's<00:02:06.869> that<00:02:06.960> I<00:02:07.110> just<00:02:07.380> have

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
you know I got my launch pad with some

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:20.680 
you know I got my launch pad with some
you<00:02:16.010> know<00:02:16.360> a<00:02:18.130> little<00:02:19.130> drum<00:02:19.400> rack<00:02:19.640> in<00:02:19.850> here<00:02:20.150> with

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
you know a little drum rack in here with

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.390 
you know a little drum rack in here with
some<00:02:21.050> different<00:02:21.230> sounds<00:02:21.740> that<00:02:21.800> I<00:02:21.950> might<00:02:22.130> want

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
some different sounds that I might want

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.120 
some different sounds that I might want
now<00:02:23.000> the<00:02:23.750> cool<00:02:23.960> thing<00:02:23.990> about<00:02:24.200> each<00:02:24.710> of<00:02:25.010> these

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
now the cool thing about each of these

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:30.550 
now the cool thing about each of these
is<00:02:25.840> you<00:02:26.840> know<00:02:26.960> when<00:02:27.110> you<00:02:27.200> make<00:02:27.470> a<00:02:27.820> drum<00:02:28.820> rack<00:02:29.560> so

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
is you know when you make a drum rack so

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:31.810 
is you know when you make a drum rack so
if<00:02:30.680> we<00:02:30.770> go<00:02:30.890> up<00:02:31.010> in<00:02:31.130> here<00:02:31.310> and<00:02:31.340> look<00:02:31.460> some<00:02:31.670> of<00:02:31.790> my

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
if we go up in here and look some of my

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.910 
if we go up in here and look some of my
drum<00:02:32.120> racks<00:02:32.360> I<00:02:32.570> make<00:02:32.750> tons<00:02:33.050> of<00:02:33.170> drum<00:02:33.410> racks<00:02:33.680> or

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
drum racks I make tons of drum racks or

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.310 
drum racks I make tons of drum racks or
tons<00:02:34.670> of<00:02:34.910> racks<00:02:35.150> of<00:02:35.420> any<00:02:35.540> sound<00:02:35.900> so<00:02:36.110> if<00:02:36.170> you<00:02:36.260> go

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
tons of racks of any sound so if you go

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.050 
tons of racks of any sound so if you go
into<00:02:36.410> stabs<00:02:36.740> right<00:02:37.130> I'm<00:02:37.370> going<00:02:37.520> to<00:02:37.610> have<00:02:37.730> lots

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
into stabs right I'm going to have lots

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:39.490 
into stabs right I'm going to have lots
of<00:02:38.210> different<00:02:38.450> stabs<00:02:38.690> that<00:02:38.840> i<00:02:38.960> can<00:02:39.140> use<00:02:39.170> and<00:02:39.440> i

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
of different stabs that i can use and i

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.240 
of different stabs that i can use and i
drop<00:02:39.770> in<00:02:39.980> this<00:02:40.610> racket<00:02:41.090> is<00:02:41.390> all<00:02:41.540> 64<00:02:42.080> stabs<00:02:42.410> now

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
drop in this racket is all 64 stabs now

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.190 
drop in this racket is all 64 stabs now
what<00:02:43.460> this<00:02:43.640> is<00:02:43.820> a<00:02:43.850> lot<00:02:44.180> it's<00:02:44.630> a<00:02:44.720> lot<00:02:44.750> nicer<00:02:44.840> for

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
what this is a lot it's a lot nicer for

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.990 
what this is a lot it's a lot nicer for
be<00:02:45.320> able<00:02:45.470> to<00:02:45.530> preview<00:02:46.070> things<00:02:46.430> a<00:02:46.670> lot<00:02:46.820> quicker

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
be able to preview things a lot quicker

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.700 
be able to preview things a lot quicker
so<00:02:47.270> you<00:02:47.330> drop<00:02:47.660> in<00:02:47.840> the<00:02:47.930> ones<00:02:48.110> you<00:02:48.260> like<00:02:48.500> and

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:48.710 
so you drop in the ones you like and

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:50.950 
so you drop in the ones you like and
then<00:02:48.980> i<00:02:49.130> can<00:02:49.310> just<00:02:49.430> go<00:02:49.580> to<00:02:49.640> my<00:02:49.790> launch<00:02:50.030> pad<00:02:50.330> down

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:50.960 
then i can just go to my launch pad down

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.870 
then i can just go to my launch pad down
here<00:02:51.260> and<00:02:51.500> just<00:02:51.650> kind<00:02:51.860> of<00:02:51.890> you<00:02:52.250> know<00:02:52.280> launch

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
here and just kind of you know launch

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.110 
here and just kind of you know launch
them<00:02:53.150> in<00:02:53.620> and<00:02:54.620> edit<00:02:55.010> them<00:02:55.250> all<00:02:55.400> up<00:02:55.580> so<00:02:55.970> this

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
them in and edit them all up so this

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.630 
them in and edit them all up so this
makes<00:02:56.330> a<00:02:56.480> lot<00:02:56.510> easier<00:02:56.690> if<00:02:57.170> I<00:02:57.290> know<00:02:57.350> exactly<00:02:58.130> the

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
makes a lot easier if I know exactly the

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.090 
makes a lot easier if I know exactly the
sound<00:02:59.090> that<00:02:59.750> I'm<00:02:59.900> looking<00:03:00.050> for<00:03:00.470> or<00:03:00.710> I<00:03:00.770> kind<00:03:01.040> of

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
sound that I'm looking for or I kind of

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:02.410 
sound that I'm looking for or I kind of
kind<00:03:01.250> of<00:03:01.400> got<00:03:01.490> an<00:03:01.550> idea<00:03:01.790> I<00:03:01.880> know<00:03:02.030> I<00:03:02.150> want<00:03:02.360> to

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420

alter the transpose change the keys
whatever<00:03:12.980> and<00:03:13.310> it's<00:03:13.640> really<00:03:13.910> nice<00:03:14.030> bit<00:03:14.300> of

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.330 
whatever and it's really nice bit of

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.120 
whatever and it's really nice bit of
launch<00:03:14.570> men<00:03:14.900> because<00:03:15.260> a<00:03:15.290> little<00:03:15.860> bit<00:03:15.950> of<00:03:16.040> the

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
launch men because a little bit of the

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:17.590 
launch men because a little bit of the
randomness<00:03:16.610> like<00:03:16.970> you<00:03:17.090> don't<00:03:17.270> know<00:03:17.420> what

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.600 
randomness like you don't know what

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.030 
randomness like you don't know what
you're<00:03:17.750> going<00:03:17.870> to<00:03:17.930> get<00:03:18.080> beside<00:03:18.380> each<00:03:18.440> other<00:03:18.770> is

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
you're going to get beside each other is

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.130 
you're going to get beside each other is
really<00:03:19.730> nice<00:03:19.910> instead<00:03:20.480> of<00:03:20.570> just<00:03:20.720> going<00:03:20.870> to<00:03:20.959> put

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
really nice instead of just going to put

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.070 
really nice instead of just going to put
one<00:03:21.440> in<00:03:21.890> and<00:03:22.790> then<00:03:23.060> you<00:03:23.240> know<00:03:23.360> put<00:03:23.390> it<00:03:23.780> in<00:03:23.930> there

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.080 
one in and then you know put it in there

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.449 
one in and then you know put it in there
put<00:03:24.230> another<00:03:24.470> one<00:03:24.650> in<00:03:24.709> there<00:03:24.980> which<00:03:25.130> takes<00:03:25.370> a

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:25.459 
put another one in there which takes a

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:27.850 
put another one in there which takes a
lot<00:03:25.610> of<00:03:25.640> time<00:03:25.730> you<00:03:26.510> just<00:03:26.660> rock<00:03:27.380> them<00:03:27.560> in<00:03:27.680> there

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 
lot of time you just rock them in there

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.270 
lot of time you just rock them in there
you<00:03:27.980> know<00:03:28.030> say<00:03:29.030> I<00:03:29.060> do<00:03:29.240> that<00:03:29.480> and<00:03:29.920> so<00:03:30.920> kind<00:03:31.130> of

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
you know say I do that and so kind of

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.199 
you know say I do that and so kind of
with<00:03:31.400> a<00:03:31.430> template<00:03:33.070> what<00:03:34.070> what<00:03:34.459> what<00:03:34.880> you<00:03:35.060> can

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
with a template what what what you can

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:37.420 
with a template what what what you can
do<00:03:35.360> is<00:03:35.630> you<00:03:36.290> know<00:03:36.410> you<00:03:36.470> make<00:03:36.740> yourselves<00:03:37.310> in

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
do is you know you make yourselves in

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:39.449 
do is you know you make yourselves in
this<00:03:37.580> and<00:03:37.820> then<00:03:37.970> you<00:03:38.000> duplicate<00:03:38.720> the<00:03:38.870> track

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
this and then you duplicate the track

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:42.100 
this and then you duplicate the track
and<00:03:40.459> then<00:03:40.670> the<00:03:40.790> duplicate<00:03:41.300> one<00:03:41.480> you<00:03:41.600> keep<00:03:41.840> and

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:42.110 
and then the duplicate one you keep and

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:44.199 
and then the duplicate one you keep and
then<00:03:42.200> you<00:03:42.290> can<00:03:42.500> keep<00:03:42.800> reusing<00:03:43.190> your<00:03:43.730> same

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:44.209 
then you can keep reusing your same

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:45.730 
then you can keep reusing your same
track<00:03:44.540> that<00:03:44.720> you've<00:03:44.840> made<00:03:45.050> and<00:03:45.110> now<00:03:45.410> within

that<00:03:45.890> track<00:03:46.190> you<00:03:46.459> have<00:03:46.750> effects<00:03:47.750> that<00:03:48.050> you

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:48.110 
that track you have effects that you

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:50.920 
that track you have effects that you
would<00:03:48.410> have<00:03:48.500> wanted<00:03:49.209> normally<00:03:50.209> so<00:03:50.750> within

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
would have wanted normally so within

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:52.510 
would have wanted normally so within
this<00:03:51.110> one<00:03:51.470> I<00:03:51.500> have<00:03:51.860> another<00:03:52.070> frequency

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:52.520 
this one I have another frequency

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:55.360 
this one I have another frequency
shifter<00:03:53.120> beat<00:03:53.480> repeat<00:03:53.900> some<00:03:54.320> delays<00:03:54.680> a<00:03:54.709> reverb

tracks me the spectrum on an EQ eight at
the<00:04:01.520> end<00:04:01.640> but<00:04:01.790> I'll<00:04:01.910> get<00:04:02.090> to<00:04:02.120> that<00:04:02.270> so<00:04:03.170> yeah<00:04:03.380> you

the end but I'll get to that so yeah you
can<00:04:03.650> just<00:04:03.680> duplicate<00:04:04.160> the<00:04:04.250> track<00:04:04.430> and<00:04:04.550> then

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:04.610 
can just duplicate the track and then

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:07.660 
can just duplicate the track and then
keep<00:04:04.820> reusing<00:04:05.030> your<00:04:05.450> main<00:04:05.870> you<00:04:06.650> know<00:04:06.800> template

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:12.739 
just go back in and your duplicate track

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:15.670 
just go back in and your duplicate track
delete<00:04:13.130> the<00:04:13.959> effects<00:04:14.959> that<00:04:15.050> you<00:04:15.140> had<00:04:15.380> in<00:04:15.560> on

your<00:04:15.800> template<00:04:16.190> just<00:04:16.370> delete<00:04:16.609> them<00:04:16.700> out<00:04:16.850> to

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060 
your template just delete them out to

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.300 
your template just delete them out to
save<00:04:17.239> some<00:04:17.450> cpu<00:04:17.780> and<00:04:18.140> then<00:04:18.799> you<00:04:18.919> can<00:04:19.100> keep

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
save some cpu and then you can keep

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:24.220 
save some cpu and then you can keep
reusing<00:04:19.549> the<00:04:20.000> mappable<00:04:20.390> ones<00:04:20.690> within<00:04:20.960> that<00:04:23.080> 78

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:33.920 
now this is this is probably the most

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:35.740

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:35.750 
important part of my set I wrote a blog

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:37.270 
important part of my set I wrote a blog
about<00:04:35.810> this<00:04:36.320> but<00:04:36.500> I'll<00:04:36.590> explain<00:04:37.010> it<00:04:37.190> a<00:04:37.250> little

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.280 
about this but I'll explain it a little

about this but I'll explain it a little
more<00:04:38.230> this<00:04:39.230> is<00:04:39.410> my<00:04:40.030> you<00:04:41.030> know<00:04:41.120> drum<00:04:41.390> section

more this is my you know drum section

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:44.860 
more this is my you know drum section
now<00:04:42.110> you<00:04:42.530> see<00:04:42.680> two<00:04:42.920> kicks<00:04:43.250> two<00:04:44.180> snares<00:04:44.420> to

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:44.870 
now you see two kicks two snares to

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:47.770 
now you see two kicks two snares to
one-quarter<00:04:45.350> hi-hats<00:04:45.800> and<00:04:45.800> 21<00:04:46.430> 16<00:04:46.850> times<00:04:47.180> now

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:47.780 
one-quarter hi-hats and 21 16 times now

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:50.260 
one-quarter hi-hats and 21 16 times now
this<00:04:47.930> is<00:04:47.990> because<00:04:48.470> I<00:04:48.500> make<00:04:49.190> you<00:04:50.000> know<00:04:50.090> house

this is because I make you know house
music<00:04:50.690> so<00:04:50.900> this<00:04:51.020> is<00:04:51.170> kind<00:04:51.380> of<00:04:51.440> standard<00:04:51.830> for

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:51.980 
music so this is kind of standard for

music so this is kind of standard for
health<00:04:52.160> now<00:04:52.960> since<00:04:53.960> the<00:04:54.650> heart<00:04:54.830> one<00:04:55.010> of<00:04:55.070> the

gives me a lot of options and then I can

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:18.760 
gives me a lot of options and then I can
just<00:05:16.760> drag<00:05:17.120> in<00:05:17.330> another<00:05:17.660> one<00:05:18.140> from<00:05:18.470> another

if I didn't really like any of those 64
which<00:05:23.210> is<00:05:23.390> rare<00:05:23.630> because<00:05:23.870> can<00:05:24.530> usually<00:05:24.680> find

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:24.980 
which is rare because can usually find

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:28.240 
which is rare because can usually find
something<00:05:25.310> I<00:05:25.340> like<00:05:25.690> and<00:05:26.690> then<00:05:27.320> what<00:05:27.530> I<00:05:27.560> did<00:05:27.950> was

something I like and then what I did was
um<00:05:29.080> these<00:05:30.080> are<00:05:30.140> like<00:05:30.470> preview<00:05:31.100> in<00:05:31.250> a<00:05:31.310> way<00:05:31.490> so<00:05:31.550> I

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:31.850 
um these are like preview in a way so I

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:34.750 
um these are like preview in a way so I
preview<00:05:32.660> my<00:05:33.290> kick<00:05:33.920> through<00:05:34.190> here<00:05:34.520> and<00:05:34.640> if<00:05:34.700> you

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:34.760 
preview my kick through here and if you

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:37.720 
preview my kick through here and if you
look<00:05:34.910> at<00:05:35.030> the<00:05:35.060> MIDI<00:05:35.360> ah<00:05:35.770> the<00:05:36.770> MIDI<00:05:37.010> for<00:05:37.340> all<00:05:37.490> of

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:37.730 
look at the MIDI ah the MIDI for all of

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:40.030 
look at the MIDI ah the MIDI for all of
these<00:05:37.910> will<00:05:38.390> be<00:05:38.540> just<00:05:39.170> like<00:05:39.320> a<00:05:39.350> normal<00:05:39.620> kick

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:40.040 
these will be just like a normal kick

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:42.070 
these will be just like a normal kick
would<00:05:40.250> be<00:05:40.400> there<00:05:40.970> should<00:05:41.120> be<00:05:41.210> just<00:05:41.420> one<00:05:41.720> and

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:42.080 
would be there should be just one and

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.740 
would be there should be just one and
it'll<00:05:42.800> be<00:05:42.980> looping<00:05:43.370> so<00:05:43.850> the<00:05:43.970> first<00:05:44.240> one<00:05:44.510> is

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:44.750 
it'll be looping so the first one is

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:48.250 
it'll be looping so the first one is
matched<00:05:45.140> to<00:05:45.560> that<00:05:46.190> would<00:05:46.280> be<00:05:46.370> c1<00:05:46.880> on<00:05:47.420> the

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:48.260 
matched to that would be c1 on the

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.770 
matched to that would be c1 on the
launch<00:05:48.560> pad<00:05:48.650> down<00:05:48.950> here<00:05:49.220> and<00:05:49.400> the<00:05:50.240> second<00:05:50.600> one

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:50.780 
launch pad down here and the second one

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:53.860 
launch pad down here and the second one
would<00:05:51.530> be<00:05:51.590> law<00:05:51.920> set<00:05:52.400> to<00:05:52.700> the<00:05:53.180> second<00:05:53.540> one<00:05:53.690> and

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:53.870 
would be law set to the second one and

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:55.960 
would be law set to the second one and
then<00:05:54.350> if<00:05:54.500> you<00:05:54.620> look<00:05:54.770> down<00:05:55.010> if<00:05:55.400> you<00:05:55.490> follow<00:05:55.760> this

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:55.970 
then if you look down if you follow this

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:58.300 
then if you look down if you follow this
the<00:05:56.180> whole<00:05:56.360> way<00:05:56.390> down<00:05:56.480> there's<00:05:57.320> sixty<00:05:57.890> four<00:05:58.160> of

00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:58.310 
the whole way down there's sixty four of

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:01.960 
the whole way down there's sixty four of
these<00:05:58.430> so<00:05:58.960> 64<00:05:59.960> of<00:06:00.080> these<00:06:00.200> match<00:06:00.440> the<00:06:00.650> 64<00:06:01.280> in<00:06:01.550> the

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:01.970 
these so 64 of these match the 64 in the

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:04.390 
these so 64 of these match the 64 in the
drum<00:06:02.690> round<00:06:02.930> so<00:06:03.380> no<00:06:03.500> matter<00:06:03.590> what<00:06:03.710> drum<00:06:04.070> rack<00:06:04.280> I

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:04.400 
drum round so no matter what drum rack I

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.420 
drum round so no matter what drum rack I
load<00:06:04.610> in<00:06:04.760> I<00:06:04.970> can<00:06:05.300> put<00:06:05.630> those<00:06:06.010> those<00:06:07.010> samples

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:07.430 
load in I can put those those samples

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:10.480 
load in I can put those those samples
into<00:06:07.790> a<00:06:07.820> 4<00:06:08.090> 4<00:06:08.120> with<00:06:08.510> a<00:06:08.540> kick<00:06:08.810> snares<00:06:09.590> also<00:06:10.280> same
