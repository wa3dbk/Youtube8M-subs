with mechanic for the Boros Allegiant
and<00:03:17.380> I<00:03:17.950> said<00:03:18.160> that's<00:03:18.250> an<00:03:18.400> awesome<00:03:18.580> mechanic

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120

and I said that's an awesome mechanic
Richard<00:03:19.450> but<00:03:19.959> I<00:03:19.989> think<00:03:20.230> you<00:03:20.290> have<00:03:20.440> it<00:03:20.560> in<00:03:20.650> the

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
Richard but I think you have it in the

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:21.420 
Richard but I think you have it in the
wrong<00:03:20.890> guild

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
wrong guild

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.280 
wrong guild
I<00:03:21.550> really<00:03:22.000> think<00:03:22.180> we<00:03:22.270> need<00:03:22.300> it<00:03:22.600> in<00:03:22.720> Celestia

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
I really think we need it in Celestia

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.050 
I really think we need it in Celestia
the<00:03:23.470> green<00:03:23.680> white<00:03:23.890> needs<00:03:24.130> it<00:03:24.280> more<00:03:24.489> the<00:03:24.850> green

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
the green white needs it more the green

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:26.490 
the green white needs it more the green
white<00:03:25.239> was<00:03:25.390> all<00:03:25.540> about<00:03:25.690> the<00:03:25.810> group<00:03:26.050> and<00:03:26.320> that

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
white was all about the group and that

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.470 
white was all about the group and that
has<00:03:26.650> a<00:03:26.680> slower<00:03:27.100> sort<00:03:27.489> of<00:03:27.580> play<00:03:27.760> style<00:03:28.090> that

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
has a slower sort of play style that

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.510 
has a slower sort of play style that
played<00:03:28.690> really<00:03:28.900> well<00:03:29.020> with<00:03:29.260> convoke<00:03:29.620> now<00:03:30.340> I

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:30.520 
played really well with convoke now I

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.280 
played really well with convoke now I
think<00:03:30.670> of<00:03:31.150> the<00:03:31.300> ten<00:03:31.510> mechanics<00:03:31.989> in<00:03:32.170> the

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
think of the ten mechanics in the

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.110 
think of the ten mechanics in the
original<00:03:32.530> Ravnica<00:03:32.830> that<00:03:33.370> convoke<00:03:33.730> was<00:03:33.940> the

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
original Ravnica that convoke was the

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.360 
original Ravnica that convoke was the
best<00:03:34.300> mechanic<00:03:34.720> I<00:03:34.780> was<00:03:35.410> a<00:03:35.440> huge<00:03:35.709> fan<00:03:35.920> of<00:03:35.950> Kotok

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
best mechanic I was a huge fan of Kotok

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.100 
best mechanic I was a huge fan of Kotok
and<00:03:36.610> I<00:03:36.850> knew<00:03:37.090> one<00:03:37.360> day<00:03:37.390> would<00:03:37.660> bring<00:03:37.840> it<00:03:37.959> back

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.110 
and I knew one day would bring it back

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.580 
and I knew one day would bring it back
the<00:03:38.560> question<00:03:38.769> was<00:03:39.100> when<00:03:39.730> and<00:03:40.030> where<00:03:40.330> and<00:03:40.750> we

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
the question was when and where and we

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:56.510 
happy to put in the set with others they

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:58.090 
happy to put in the set with others they
were<00:04:56.570> coming<00:04:57.170> a<00:04:57.260> little<00:04:57.410> bit<00:04:57.560> more<00:04:57.800> from<00:04:58.010> an

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:58.100 
were coming a little bit more from an

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:00.280 
were coming a little bit more from an
outsider's<00:04:58.550> perspective<00:04:58.760> and<00:04:59.510> so<00:05:00.020> there<00:05:00.200> was

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:00.290 
outsider's perspective and so there was

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:02.020 
outsider's perspective and so there was
a<00:05:00.320> lot<00:05:00.620> more<00:05:00.830> back<00:05:01.040> and<00:05:01.070> forth<00:05:01.310> and<00:05:01.730> that<00:05:01.880> was

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:02.030 
a lot more back and forth and that was

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:05.230 
a lot more back and forth and that was
also<00:05:02.420> really<00:05:03.170> cool<00:05:03.440> because<00:05:03.800> they<00:05:04.340> often<00:05:04.790> had

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:05.240 
also really cool because they often had

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.210 
also really cool because they often had
an<00:05:05.510> outsider's<00:05:06.110> perspective<00:05:06.290> and<00:05:06.800> that<00:05:06.950> meant

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:07.220 
an outsider's perspective and that meant

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:09.160 
an outsider's perspective and that meant
we<00:05:07.400> were<00:05:07.550> gonna<00:05:07.670> do<00:05:08.000> something<00:05:08.300> different

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:09.170 
we were gonna do something different

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:11.500 
we were gonna do something different
than<00:05:09.740> how<00:05:09.890> we<00:05:09.950> normally<00:05:10.220> make<00:05:10.580> magic<00:05:11.000> cards<00:05:11.300> I

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:11.510 
than how we normally make magic cards I

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:13.480 
than how we normally make magic cards I
always<00:05:12.110> like<00:05:12.350> corsets<00:05:12.830> because<00:05:13.160> it's<00:05:13.280> almost

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:13.490 
always like corsets because it's almost

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:15.250 
always like corsets because it's almost
like<00:05:13.670> a<00:05:13.700> clip<00:05:14.030> show<00:05:14.210> of<00:05:14.450> your<00:05:14.570> favorite<00:05:14.900> worlds
