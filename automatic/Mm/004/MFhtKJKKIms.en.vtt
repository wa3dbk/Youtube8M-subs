00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:05.330 
build up on just like that
then<00:02:02.459> I'm<00:02:02.549> going<00:02:02.700> to<00:02:02.789> switch<00:02:03.030> to<00:02:03.060> my<00:02:03.799> small<00:02:04.799> tip

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
then I'm going to switch to my small tip

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.570 
then I'm going to switch to my small tip
3<00:02:05.819> with<00:02:06.509> the<00:02:06.780> pink<00:02:07.229> buttercream<00:02:07.649> in<00:02:08.100> it<00:02:08.280> and

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
3 with the pink buttercream in it and

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.410 
3 with the pink buttercream in it and
I'm<00:02:08.729> going<00:02:08.970> to<00:02:09.030> make<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:10.170> two<00:02:10.380> valve<00:02:10.800> spots<00:02:11.490> at

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
I'm going to make the two valve spots at

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.980 
I'm going to make the two valve spots at
the<00:02:12.540> top<00:02:12.690> of<00:02:13.140> the<00:02:13.200> heart<00:02:13.440> and<00:02:14.780> then<00:02:15.780> I'm<00:02:15.870> going

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
the top of the heart and then I'm going

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.730 
the top of the heart and then I'm going
to<00:02:16.110> make<00:02:16.320> the

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
to make the

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.880 
to make the
line<00:02:17.240> so<00:02:18.240> I<00:02:18.270> know<00:02:18.420> where<00:02:18.810> to<00:02:18.930> go<00:02:19.140> with<00:02:19.530> my

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
line so I know where to go with my

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:26.060 
line so I know where to go with my
larger<00:02:20.790> tip<00:02:23.210> just<00:02:24.210> like<00:02:24.450> that<00:02:24.680> switch<00:02:25.680> to<00:02:25.920> my

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
larger tip just like that switch to my

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.400 
larger tip just like that switch to my
larger<00:02:26.430> tip<00:02:26.610> and<00:02:27.090> I'm<00:02:27.180> going<00:02:27.360> to<00:02:27.480> fill<00:02:27.720> in<00:02:27.960> the

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
larger tip and I'm going to fill in the

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.520 
larger tip and I'm going to fill in the
center<00:02:28.860> area<00:02:29.040> here

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
center area here

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:36.260 
center area here
following<00:02:31.530> my<00:02:31.680> outline<00:02:34.400> make<00:02:35.400> it<00:02:35.550> flat<00:02:35.880> in<00:02:36.150> the

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
following my outline make it flat in the

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.290 
following my outline make it flat in the
center<00:02:36.720> and<00:02:37.650> then<00:02:37.890> we're<00:02:38.640> going<00:02:38.790> to<00:02:38.820> go<00:02:38.940> around

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
center and then we're going to go around

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.910 
center and then we're going to go around
again<00:02:39.780> and<00:02:41.030> build<00:02:42.030> up<00:02:42.270> some<00:02:42.300> height<00:02:42.720> here<00:02:43.140> like

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
again and build up some height here like

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
again and build up some height here like
that<00:02:44.990> then<00:02:45.990> switching<00:02:46.440> back<00:02:46.560> to<00:02:46.620> your<00:02:47.010> red<00:02:47.700> but

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
that then switching back to your red but

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.420 
that then switching back to your red but
the<00:02:48.060> small<00:02:48.360> tip<00:02:48.630> this<00:02:48.810> time<00:02:49.130> you're<00:02:50.130> going<00:02:50.250> to

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
the small tip this time you're going to

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.420 
the small tip this time you're going to
start<00:02:50.760> in<00:02:50.910> the<00:02:51.000> center<00:02:51.270> of<00:02:51.750> one<00:02:52.680> of<00:02:52.740> the<00:02:52.950> valves

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
start in the center of one of the valves

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.150 
start in the center of one of the valves
and<00:02:53.640> just<00:02:54.510> come<00:02:54.720> on<00:02:54.870> down<00:02:55.020> through<00:02:55.620> the<00:02:55.800> center

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
put these arteries end to the blue for

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.510 
put these arteries end to the blue for

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:14.520 
the veins right down the center of that

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:25.760 
the veins right down the center of that
one<00:03:15.470> and<00:03:16.730> over<00:03:17.730> here<00:03:20.690> and<00:03:21.690> just<00:03:22.050> like<00:03:22.260> that<00:03:24.770> and

one and over here and just like that and
there<00:03:25.920> we<00:03:26.040> go<00:03:26.160> if<00:03:26.820> you<00:03:26.880> want<00:03:27.210> to<00:03:27.330> finish<00:03:27.510> it<00:03:27.810> off

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:27.990 
there we go if you want to finish it off

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:30.920 
there we go if you want to finish it off
with<00:03:28.650> a<00:03:28.680> little<00:03:28.890> bit<00:03:29.250> of<00:03:29.280> extra<00:03:30.090> kind<00:03:30.420> of<00:03:30.600> goo

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
with a little bit of extra kind of goo

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.900 
with a little bit of extra kind of goo
if<00:03:31.440> you<00:03:31.680> take<00:03:31.950> some<00:03:32.160> of<00:03:32.190> the<00:03:32.340> cherry<00:03:32.610> filling

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
if you take some of the cherry filling

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.450 
if you take some of the cherry filling
and<00:03:33.810> put<00:03:34.050> it<00:03:34.170> around<00:03:34.290> the<00:03:34.770> outside<00:03:34.920> of<00:03:35.340> the

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:35.460 
and put it around the outside of the

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:39.290 
and put it around the outside of the
heart<00:03:36.560> and<00:03:37.560> then<00:03:37.680> brush<00:03:38.010> it<00:03:38.040> up<00:03:38.340> against<00:03:38.880> it<00:03:39.030> it

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.300 
heart and then brush it up against it it

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.300 
heart and then brush it up against it it
just<00:03:40.200> kind<00:03:40.320> of<00:03:40.440> makes<00:03:40.620> it<00:03:40.680> look<00:03:40.860> a<00:03:40.950> little<00:03:41.070> bit

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
just kind of makes it look a little bit

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.890 
just kind of makes it look a little bit
more<00:03:41.430> gory<00:03:42.920> so<00:03:43.920> next<00:03:44.130> up<00:03:44.430> I'm<00:03:44.730> going<00:03:44.790> to<00:03:45.480> do<00:03:45.690> the

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
more gory so next up I'm going to do the

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.590 
more gory so next up I'm going to do the
brain<00:03:46.080> to<00:03:46.800> make<00:03:46.920> the<00:03:47.100> brain<00:03:47.370> cupcakes<00:03:47.970> we're

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
brain to make the brain cupcakes we're

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.860 
brain to make the brain cupcakes we're
going<00:03:48.840> to<00:03:48.990> take<00:03:49.200> our<00:03:49.440> number<00:03:50.070> 10<00:03:50.490> pink<00:03:51.120> bag<00:03:51.480> and

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
going to take our number 10 pink bag and

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.320 
going to take our number 10 pink bag and
we're<00:03:52.500> going<00:03:52.770> to<00:03:52.830> start<00:03:53.250> in<00:03:53.460> the<00:03:53.550> center<00:03:53.790> here

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
we're going to start in the center here

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.210 
we're going to start in the center here
and<00:03:54.450> we're<00:03:55.020> going<00:03:55.170> to<00:03:55.320> just<00:03:55.470> build<00:03:55.770> up<00:03:55.980> some

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
and we're going to just build up some

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.400 
and we're going to just build up some
height<00:03:56.490> here<00:03:56.880> so<00:03:57.390> the<00:03:57.540> brain<00:03:57.780> has<00:03:57.810> more<00:03:58.230> of<00:03:58.320> a

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
height here so the brain has more of a

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.770 
height here so the brain has more of a
realistic<00:03:58.770> shape<00:03:59.250> to<00:03:59.460> it<00:03:59.630> we're<00:04:00.630> going<00:04:00.720> to

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
realistic shape to it we're going to

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.410 
realistic shape to it we're going to
start<00:04:01.050> here<00:04:01.350> at<00:04:01.560> this<00:04:01.770> edge<00:04:02.010> and<00:04:02.370> then<00:04:03.090> just

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
start here at this edge and then just

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.800 
start here at this edge and then just
follow<00:04:03.720> going<00:04:04.470> up<00:04:04.680> and<00:04:05.070> over<00:04:05.640> this<00:04:06.420> height

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
follow going up and over this height

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:11.240 
follow going up and over this height
here<00:04:06.890> down<00:04:07.890> the<00:04:08.100> other<00:04:08.250> side<00:04:08.610> and<00:04:09.030> around<00:04:10.250> to

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
here down the other side and around to

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.790 
here down the other side and around to
meet<00:04:11.460> back<00:04:11.850> where<00:04:12.120> you<00:04:12.210> started<00:04:12.240> and<00:04:12.900> repeat

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:13.800 
meet back where you started and repeat

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:20.690 
meet back where you started and repeat
on<00:04:14.010> this<00:04:14.220> side<00:04:16.100> up<00:04:17.100> and<00:04:17.340> around<00:04:18.590> and<00:04:19.590> there<00:04:20.520> we

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
on this side up and around and there we

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:24.680 
on this side up and around and there we
go<00:04:20.850> so<00:04:21.480> the<00:04:21.600> next<00:04:21.840> part<00:04:22.230> is<00:04:22.500> to<00:04:23.360> just<00:04:24.360> kind<00:04:24.630> of

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
go so the next part is to just kind of

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:28.580 
go so the next part is to just kind of
do<00:04:24.810> like<00:04:24.990> a<00:04:25.020> zigzag<00:04:25.410> here<00:04:26.160> up<00:04:26.580> and<00:04:27.090> down<00:04:27.590> this

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
do like a zigzag here up and down this
