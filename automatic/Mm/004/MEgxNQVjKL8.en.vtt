00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
first impressions first off is the

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.420 
first impressions first off is the
coloring<00:00:48.450> so<00:00:48.780> when<00:00:49.020> you<00:00:49.110> look<00:00:49.320> at<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:50.129> white

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
coloring so when you look at the white

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.069 
coloring so when you look at the white
of<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.670> sticker<00:00:51.120> compared<00:00:51.480> to<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.629> plastic

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
of the sticker compared to the plastic

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.299 
of the sticker compared to the plastic
it<00:00:52.260> almost<00:00:52.469> looks<00:00:52.680> like<00:00:52.739> it's<00:00:52.980> an<00:00:53.100> off-white

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
it almost looks like it's an off-white

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.670 
it almost looks like it's an off-white
like<00:00:54.120> a<00:00:54.239> slightly<00:00:54.600> creamy<00:00:55.050> white<00:00:55.410> i<00:00:55.440> don't

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
like a slightly creamy white i don't

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:56.930 
like a slightly creamy white i don't
know<00:00:55.739> if<00:00:55.829> you<00:00:55.920> can<00:00:56.010> tell<00:00:56.160> in<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.399> camera<00:00:56.730> but

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
know if you can tell in the camera but

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.580 
know if you can tell in the camera but
in<00:00:57.059> person<00:00:57.239> you<00:00:57.629> can<00:00:57.660> definitely<00:00:57.930> notice<00:00:58.410> it

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
in person you can definitely notice it

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.650 
in person you can definitely notice it
but<00:00:59.309> that's<00:00:59.430> just<00:00:59.579> like<00:00:59.699> a<00:00:59.820> little<00:01:00.270> detail

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
but that's just like a little detail

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.260 
but that's just like a little detail
that<00:01:01.020> doesn't<00:01:01.320> really<00:01:01.440> bother<00:01:01.649> me<00:01:02.000> also<00:01:03.000> just

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
that doesn't really bother me also just

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.410 
that doesn't really bother me also just
holding<00:01:03.660> it<00:01:03.719> in<00:01:03.899> your<00:01:04.049> hands<00:01:04.640> it's<00:01:05.640> like<00:01:05.909> a<00:01:06.060> lot

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
holding it in your hands it's like a lot

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.380 
holding it in your hands it's like a lot
larger<00:01:07.229> it<00:01:07.740> feels<00:01:08.040> a<00:01:08.189> lot<00:01:08.340> larger<00:01:08.549> in<00:01:08.939> my

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
larger it feels a lot larger in my

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.330 
larger it feels a lot larger in my
opinion<00:01:09.689> than<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.409> dye<00:01:10.560> in<00:01:10.740> which<00:01:10.920> i<00:01:11.010> use<00:01:11.189> is

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
opinion than the dye in which i use is

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.270 
opinion than the dye in which i use is
my<00:01:11.460> main<00:01:12.049> also<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.380> very<00:01:13.619> first<00:01:13.950> thing<00:01:14.159> i

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
my main also the very first thing i

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.780 
my main also the very first thing i
noticed<00:01:14.700> when<00:01:15.330> i<00:01:15.500> unbox<00:01:16.500> this<00:01:16.680> puzzle<00:01:17.130> was

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
noticed when i unbox this puzzle was

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.539 
noticed when i unbox this puzzle was
these<00:01:18.560> giant<00:01:20.240> holes<00:01:21.240> almost<00:01:21.920> there<00:01:22.920> not<00:01:23.100> even

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
these giant holes almost there not even

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.249 
these giant holes almost there not even
like<00:01:23.729> a<00:01:23.759> whole<00:01:24.150> there's<00:01:24.360> like<00:01:24.509> a<00:01:24.540> rage<00:01:24.930> but

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
like a whole there's like a rage but

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.520 
like a whole there's like a rage but
instead<00:01:25.470> of<00:01:25.590> ridging<00:01:26.930> outward<00:01:27.930> their<00:01:28.290> inward

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
instead of ridging outward their inward

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.530 
instead of ridging outward their inward
i<00:01:28.979> don't<00:01:29.250> really<00:01:29.369> know<00:01:29.490> how<00:01:29.640> to<00:01:29.759> describe<00:01:30.150> it

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
i don't really know how to describe it

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.929 
i don't really know how to describe it
very<00:01:30.750> well<00:01:30.990> but<00:01:31.740> they<00:01:32.009> have<00:01:32.189> them<00:01:32.430> all<00:01:32.670> around

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
very well but they have them all around

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.330 
very well but they have them all around
the<00:01:33.180> cube<00:01:33.509> and<00:01:33.750> it<00:01:33.869> makes<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.650> plastic<00:01:35.189> around

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
the cube and it makes the plastic around

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.990 
the cube and it makes the plastic around
it<00:01:35.790> show<00:01:36.329> a<00:01:36.360> lot<00:01:36.689> more<00:01:37.079> than<00:01:37.920> unlike<00:01:38.880> a<00:01:38.909> normal

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
it show a lot more than unlike a normal

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.960 
it show a lot more than unlike a normal
megamix<00:01:39.689> but<00:01:40.680> this<00:01:40.950> also<00:01:41.130> helps<00:01:41.549> with<00:01:41.579> grip

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
megamix but this also helps with grip

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.450 
megamix but this also helps with grip
which<00:01:42.450> I<00:01:42.570> was<00:01:42.720> kind<00:01:42.899> of<00:01:42.930> surprised<00:01:43.320> by<00:01:43.590> because

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
which I was kind of surprised by because

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.950 
which I was kind of surprised by because
I'm<00:01:44.670> used<00:01:44.880> to<00:01:44.909> having<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.240> ridges<00:01:45.570> that<00:01:45.630> come

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
I'm used to having the ridges that come

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.020 
I'm used to having the ridges that come
up<00:01:46.170> and<00:01:46.409> that<00:01:46.799> definitely<00:01:47.159> helps<00:01:47.610> with<00:01:47.759> grip

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
up and that definitely helps with grip

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.620 
up and that definitely helps with grip
but<00:01:48.509> having<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.020> ridges<00:01:49.820> inward<00:01:50.820> at<00:01:51.090> also

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
but having the ridges inward at also

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.030 
but having the ridges inward at also
help<00:01:51.869> which<00:01:52.290> like<00:01:53.220> I<00:01:53.340> said<00:01:53.369> surprised<00:01:54.060> me<00:01:55.040> but

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
help which like I said surprised me but

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.859 
help which like I said surprised me but
getting<00:01:56.549> on<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:56.790> like<00:01:56.939> to<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.390> turning<00:01:57.810> of

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
getting on to like to the turning of

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:03.020 
getting on to like to the turning of
this<00:01:58.049> puzzle<00:01:59.180> it's<00:02:00.180> very<00:02:00.390> uneven<00:02:01.049> like<00:02:02.030> you

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
this puzzle it's very uneven like you

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.910 
this puzzle it's very uneven like you
turn<00:02:03.390> it<00:02:03.570> and<00:02:03.750> some<00:02:04.049> sides<00:02:04.290> are<00:02:04.500> amazing

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
turn it and some sides are amazing

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.119 
turn it and some sides are amazing
others<00:02:05.280> are<00:02:05.460> absolutely<00:02:06.000> horrific<00:02:06.240> and<00:02:07.129> I've

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
others are absolutely horrific and I've

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.369 
others are absolutely horrific and I've
for<00:02:08.879> obvious<00:02:09.179> reasons<00:02:09.539> I<00:02:09.629> have<00:02:09.810> intention

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
for obvious reasons I have intention

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.229 
for obvious reasons I have intention
door<00:02:10.560> leave<00:02:10.739> this<00:02:10.920> or<00:02:11.099> anything<00:02:11.280> so<00:02:11.790> we'll<00:02:12.060> see

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
door leave this or anything so we'll see

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.730 
door leave this or anything so we'll see
how<00:02:12.270> it<00:02:12.390> turns<00:02:12.540> after<00:02:12.900> that

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
how it turns after that

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.270 
how it turns after that
but<00:02:13.890> so<00:02:14.100> far<00:02:14.370> the<00:02:14.730> turning<00:02:15.680> its<00:02:16.680> relatively

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
but so far the turning its relatively

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.030 
but so far the turning its relatively
smooth<00:02:17.700> but<00:02:17.970> I'm<00:02:18.060> so<00:02:18.270> distracted<00:02:18.690> by<00:02:19.040> the

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
smooth but I'm so distracted by the

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.940 
smooth but I'm so distracted by the
slowness<00:02:20.850> and<00:02:21.390> like<00:02:21.570> the<00:02:21.870> unevenness<00:02:22.620> of<00:02:22.830> the

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
slowness and like the unevenness of the

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.650 
slowness and like the unevenness of the
tensions<00:02:23.430> that<00:02:23.580> it's<00:02:23.910> really<00:02:24.180> kind<00:02:24.360> of<00:02:24.450> hard

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
tensions that it's really kind of hard

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.140 
tensions that it's really kind of hard
to<00:02:24.750> give<00:02:25.650> my<00:02:25.830> very<00:02:26.130> like<00:02:26.370> have<00:02:26.700> a<00:02:26.730> very<00:02:27.030> good

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
to give my very like have a very good

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.390 
to give my very like have a very good
opinion<00:02:27.600> on<00:02:27.720> it<00:02:27.870> so<00:02:28.470> I'm<00:02:28.710> definitely<00:02:28.830> going<00:02:29.250> to

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
opinion on it so I'm definitely going to

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.790 
opinion on it so I'm definitely going to
take<00:02:29.550> this<00:02:29.700> apart<00:02:30.030> or<00:02:30.330> and<00:02:30.630> lube<00:02:31.410> it<00:02:31.590> and

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
take this apart or and lube it and

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.440 
take this apart or and lube it and
tension<00:02:32.190> it<00:02:32.340> and<00:02:32.490> it<00:02:32.850> might<00:02:32.970> even<00:02:33.150> include

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
tension it and it might even include

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.390 
tension it and it might even include
that<00:02:33.810> as<00:02:33.870> a<00:02:34.080> time<00:02:34.380> lapse<00:02:34.620> at<00:02:34.920> the<00:02:35.040> end<00:02:35.190> of<00:02:35.310> this

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
that as a time lapse at the end of this

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.200 
that as a time lapse at the end of this
will<00:02:35.760> seem<00:02:36.830> but<00:02:37.830> it<00:02:38.160> definitely<00:02:38.520> needs<00:02:39.000> work

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
will seem but it definitely needs work

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:40.880 
will seem but it definitely needs work
to<00:02:39.390> be<00:02:39.480> done<00:02:39.660> it's<00:02:39.870> not<00:02:40.080> a<00:02:40.110> mega<00:02:40.470> mink<00:02:40.710> so<00:02:40.800> you

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
to be done it's not a mega mink so you

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.130 
to be done it's not a mega mink so you
can<00:02:41.040> simply<00:02:41.250> buy<00:02:41.580> and<00:02:42.000> have<00:02:42.780> it<00:02:42.900> working

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
can simply buy and have it working

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.920 
can simply buy and have it working
perfectly<00:02:43.800> so<00:02:44.610> far<00:02:44.970> I<00:02:45.270> don't<00:02:45.300> think<00:02:45.780> it's

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
perfectly so far I don't think it's

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.780 
perfectly so far I don't think it's
going<00:02:46.080> to<00:02:46.140> be<00:02:46.230> my<00:02:46.410> main<00:02:46.650> but<00:02:46.950> again<00:02:47.280> I<00:02:47.310> have<00:02:47.670> to

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
going to be my main but again I have to

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.120 
going to be my main but again I have to
loom<00:02:47.970> intention<00:02:48.570> it<00:02:48.720> but<00:02:49.560> that's<00:02:49.830> pretty<00:02:50.010> much

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
loom intention it but that's pretty much

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.310 
loom intention it but that's pretty much
just<00:02:50.250> my<00:02:50.640> first<00:02:50.850> impressions<00:02:51.420> the<00:02:51.630> size<00:02:51.840> is<00:02:52.230> a

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
just my first impressions the size is a

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.590 
just my first impressions the size is a
lot<00:02:52.500> larger<00:02:52.680> these<00:02:53.580> ridges<00:02:53.940> are<00:02:54.090> interesting

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
lot larger these ridges are interesting

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.230 
lot larger these ridges are interesting
kind<00:02:54.900> of<00:02:54.990> helpful<00:02:55.230> with<00:02:55.560> grit<00:02:55.890> and<00:02:56.100> it's<00:02:56.970> very

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:57.240 
kind of helpful with grit and it's very

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:01.190 
kind of helpful with grit and it's very
uneven<00:02:57.840> so<00:02:58.560> I'm<00:02:59.090> going<00:03:00.090> to<00:03:00.150> go<00:03:00.390> lubin<00:03:00.810> tending

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
uneven so I'm going to go lubin tending

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.260 
uneven so I'm going to go lubin tending
this<00:03:01.380> now<00:03:01.560> and<00:03:01.920> then<00:03:02.280> I<00:03:02.310> will<00:03:02.790> be<00:03:03.030> back<00:03:03.210> with

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 
this now and then I will be back with

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.960 
this now and then I will be back with
either<00:03:03.810> review<00:03:04.320> or<00:03:05.010> just<00:03:05.460> some<00:03:05.670> quick

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
either review or just some quick

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.240 
either review or just some quick
impressions<00:03:06.150> after<00:03:06.960> and<00:03:07.260> this<00:03:07.560> like<00:03:07.830> after

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
impressions after and this like after

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:28.530 
impressions after and this like after
the<00:03:08.340> initial<00:03:08.640> living<00:03:09.060> and<00:03:09.180> tensioning

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.210 

okay<00:03:29.540> so<00:03:29.599> i<00:03:29.810> just<00:03:30.110> finished<00:03:30.440> leaving<00:03:30.800> and

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
okay so i just finished leaving and

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.900 
okay so i just finished leaving and
tensioning<00:03:31.970> this<00:03:32.180> thing<00:03:32.420> and<00:03:33.519> it's<00:03:34.519> a<00:03:34.640> lot

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
tensioning this thing and it's a lot

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:38.740 
tensioning this thing and it's a lot
faster<00:03:35.209> at<00:03:35.629> this<00:03:35.810> point<00:03:37.120> however<00:03:38.120> i'm<00:03:38.450> still

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
faster at this point however i'm still

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.470 
faster at this point however i'm still
getting<00:03:38.900> some<00:03:39.319> locks<00:03:39.760> so<00:03:40.760> i'm<00:03:41.060> not<00:03:41.209> quite<00:03:41.450> sure

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
getting some locks so i'm not quite sure

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.300 
getting some locks so i'm not quite sure
how<00:03:41.840> i'll<00:03:41.989> end<00:03:42.170> up<00:03:42.260> liking<00:03:42.500> this<00:03:42.769> lot<00:03:43.010> to<00:03:43.160> do<00:03:43.280> a

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
how i'll end up liking this lot to do a

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.759 
how i'll end up liking this lot to do a
few<00:03:43.489> solves<00:03:43.970> um<00:03:44.810> this<00:03:45.500> isn't<00:03:45.709> my<00:03:45.920> color<00:03:46.160> scheme

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:47.769 
few solves um this isn't my color scheme

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:51.130 
few solves um this isn't my color scheme
so<00:03:48.769> i<00:03:49.129> may<00:03:49.459> or<00:03:49.489> may<00:03:49.790> not<00:03:49.819> breathe<00:03:50.569> thicker<00:03:50.840> it<00:03:51.019> I

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:51.140 
so i may or may not breathe thicker it I

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:52.539 
so i may or may not breathe thicker it I
don't<00:03:51.410> want<00:03:51.560> to<00:03:51.620> take<00:03:51.950> the<00:03:52.099> time<00:03:52.129> to<00:03:52.430> read

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:52.549 
don't want to take the time to read

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:54.280 
don't want to take the time to read
sticker<00:03:52.819> the<00:03:52.910> whole<00:03:53.060> thing<00:03:53.299> if<00:03:53.780> I<00:03:53.930> don't<00:03:54.110> think

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
sticker the whole thing if I don't think

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.650 
sticker the whole thing if I don't think
it's<00:03:54.410> going<00:03:54.530> to<00:03:54.590> be<00:03:54.650> my<00:03:54.920> main<00:03:55.160> so<00:03:56.120> i'll<00:03:56.599> just

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660 
it's going to be my main so i'll just

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:58.570 
it's going to be my main so i'll just
have<00:03:56.989> to<00:03:57.019> do<00:03:57.230> solves<00:03:57.650> with<00:03:57.799> this<00:03:57.980> color<00:03:58.220> scheme

00:03:58.570 --> 00:03:58.580 
have to do solves with this color scheme

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:00.520 
have to do solves with this color scheme
which<00:03:58.819> is<00:03:59.209> perfectly<00:03:59.690> fine<00:03:59.780> i'm<00:04:00.170> just<00:04:00.349> going

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 
which is perfectly fine i'm just going

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:02.800 
which is perfectly fine i'm just going
to<00:04:00.560> be<00:04:00.680> slower<00:04:00.950> but<00:04:01.640> i<00:04:01.700> can<00:04:02.030> still<00:04:02.180> get<00:04:02.390> an<00:04:02.480> idea

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
to be slower but i can still get an idea

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.470 
to be slower but i can still get an idea
on<00:04:02.900> the<00:04:03.200> turning<00:04:04.040> of<00:04:04.160> this<00:04:04.370> puzzle<00:04:04.640> in<00:04:04.970> a<00:04:05.209> salt

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 
on the turning of this puzzle in a salt

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.530 
on the turning of this puzzle in a salt
but<00:04:06.290> as<00:04:06.560> of<00:04:06.739> right<00:04:06.799> now<00:04:07.010> still<00:04:07.819> thinking<00:04:08.329> it's

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
but as of right now still thinking it's

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.479 
but as of right now still thinking it's
probably<00:04:08.690> not<00:04:09.110> going<00:04:09.230> to<00:04:09.290> be<00:04:09.410> my<00:04:09.560> main<00:04:09.739> unless

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:10.489 
probably not going to be my main unless

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:13.240 
probably not going to be my main unless
breaking<00:04:11.030> in<00:04:11.209> helps<00:04:12.079> these<00:04:12.260> locks<00:04:12.620> to<00:04:12.890> go<00:04:13.010> away

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
breaking in helps these locks to go away

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:17.349 
breaking in helps these locks to go away
but<00:04:14.150> it's<00:04:14.780> definitely<00:04:15.079> turning<00:04:15.560> better<00:04:16.359> than

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 
but it's definitely turning better than

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:19.210 
but it's definitely turning better than
it<00:04:17.510> was<00:04:17.540> before<00:04:17.750> and<00:04:18.260> I<00:04:18.470> don't<00:04:18.709> believe<00:04:18.889> I<00:04:19.070> got

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:19.220 
it was before and I don't believe I got

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:21.909 
it was before and I don't believe I got
any<00:04:19.690> bent<00:04:20.690> screws<00:04:21.200> which<00:04:21.470> is<00:04:21.590> really<00:04:21.829> awesome

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:21.919 
any bent screws which is really awesome

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:24.190 
any bent screws which is really awesome
because<00:04:22.310> most<00:04:22.669> people<00:04:23.060> have<00:04:23.090> been<00:04:23.510> getting<00:04:23.690> at

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:24.200 
because most people have been getting at

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.980 
because most people have been getting at
least<00:04:24.260> one<00:04:24.650> or<00:04:24.950> two<00:04:24.979> bent<00:04:25.550> screws<00:04:25.970> so<00:04:26.300> very

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990 
least one or two bent screws so very

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.110 
least one or two bent screws so very
happy<00:04:27.199> that<00:04:27.530> I<00:04:27.560> don't<00:04:27.830> have<00:04:28.010> any<00:04:28.280> but<00:04:28.820> I'm

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 
happy that I don't have any but I'm

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.460 
happy that I don't have any but I'm
definitely<00:04:29.389> going<00:04:29.720> to<00:04:29.810> have<00:04:29.900> to<00:04:30.110> work<00:04:30.320> with

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
definitely going to have to work with

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.860 
definitely going to have to work with
this<00:04:30.590> a<00:04:30.650> little<00:04:30.889> more<00:04:31.120> but<00:04:32.120> that<00:04:32.330> is<00:04:32.450> all<00:04:32.600> for

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
this a little more but that is all for

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:36.100 
this a little more but that is all for
my<00:04:33.080> first<00:04:33.410> impression<00:04:33.919> /<00:04:34.340> setup<00:04:34.850> /<00:04:35.150> I<00:04:35.630> guess

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 
my first impression / setup / I guess

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:37.960 
my first impression / setup / I guess
second<00:04:36.530> impressions<00:04:37.070> of<00:04:37.190> this<00:04:37.340> puzzle<00:04:37.610> and

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:37.970 
second impressions of this puzzle and

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:42.850 
second impressions of this puzzle and
i'll<00:04:38.450> see<00:04:38.750> you<00:04:38.840> guys<00:04:38.900> in<00:04:39.320> my<00:04:39.410> next<00:04:39.560> video<00:04:40.100> bye
