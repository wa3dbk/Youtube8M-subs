hello<00:00:01.199> everyone<00:00:02.360> on<00:00:03.360> the<00:00:03.510> forms<00:00:03.780> all<00:00:04.080> the

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
hello everyone on the forms all the

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.099 
hello everyone on the forms all the
people<00:00:04.560> have<00:00:04.680> requested<00:00:04.920> a<00:00:05.640> a<00:00:05.970> tutorial<00:00:06.660> on

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
people have requested a a tutorial on

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.459 
people have requested a a tutorial on
how<00:00:07.170> to<00:00:07.410> make<00:00:07.740> power-ups<00:00:08.870> so<00:00:09.870> I<00:00:09.900> guess<00:00:10.230> I'm<00:00:10.440> the

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
how to make power-ups so I guess I'm the

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.950 
how to make power-ups so I guess I'm the
one<00:00:10.740> to<00:00:10.860> do<00:00:11.010> it<00:00:11.040> since<00:00:11.370> my<00:00:11.580> legs<00:00:11.820> of<00:00:11.969> all<00:00:12.240> had<00:00:12.570> a

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
one to do it since my legs of all had a

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.060 
one to do it since my legs of all had a
couple<00:00:13.349> of<00:00:13.559> them<00:00:14.330> so<00:00:15.379> i'll<00:00:16.379> hit<00:00:16.710> the<00:00:16.890> red

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
couple of them so i'll hit the red

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.390 
couple of them so i'll hit the red
circle<00:00:17.340> so<00:00:18.270> you<00:00:18.359> get<00:00:18.539> the<00:00:18.660> power<00:00:18.900> up<00:00:19.140> and<00:00:19.439> now<00:00:20.369> i

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
circle so you get the power up and now i

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.840 
circle so you get the power up and now i
can<00:00:20.699> press<00:00:20.910> enter<00:00:21.449> to<00:00:21.930> users<00:00:22.350> this<00:00:23.189> is<00:00:23.519> just<00:00:23.730> a

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
can press enter to users this is just a

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.580 
can press enter to users this is just a
simple<00:00:24.180> jump<00:00:24.449> one<00:00:25.189> and<00:00:26.869> there<00:00:27.869> there<00:00:28.560> are

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
simple jump one and there there are

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.669 
simple jump one and there there are
one-time<00:00:29.250> use<00:00:29.550> well<00:00:30.029> this<00:00:30.269> one<00:00:30.449> was<00:00:30.630> and<00:00:30.929> then

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
one-time use well this one was and then

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.920 
one-time use well this one was and then
you<00:00:31.830> can<00:00:32.009> replicate<00:00:32.250> this<00:00:32.820> mechanism<00:00:33.390> to<00:00:33.600> make

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
you can replicate this mechanism to make

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.830 
you can replicate this mechanism to make
it<00:00:34.110> a<00:00:35.000> two-time<00:00:36.000> years<00:00:36.300> or<00:00:36.680> three<00:00:37.680> time<00:00:37.950> use

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:38.840 
it a two-time years or three time use

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.270 
it a two-time years or three time use
just<00:00:39.840> buy<00:00:40.050> coffee<00:00:40.350> and<00:00:40.590> pacing<00:00:40.980> at<00:00:41.100> them

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
just buy coffee and pacing at them

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.150 
just buy coffee and pacing at them
changing<00:00:41.760> of<00:00:41.910> all<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.570> trigger<00:00:42.809> names<00:00:44.750> so<00:00:46.160> to

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
changing of all the trigger names so to

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.680 
changing of all the trigger names so to
help<00:00:47.399> you<00:00:47.579> understand<00:00:48.239> this<00:00:48.480> household<00:00:49.110> works

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690 
help you understand this household works

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.700 
help you understand this household works
when<00:00:51.690> you<00:00:51.780> hit<00:00:51.989> this<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.920> circle<00:00:53.660> its

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:54.710 
when you hit this the circle its

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:01.880 
when you hit this the circle its
activates<00:00:55.710> this<00:00:59.539> what<00:01:00.539> makes<00:01:01.350> this<00:01:01.590> thing

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
activates this what makes this thing

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:08.300 
activates this what makes this thing
expand<00:01:03.739> here's<00:01:04.739> an<00:01:05.070> arsenal<00:01:05.790> lat<00:01:06.770> so<00:01:07.770> does<00:01:08.040> two

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
expand here's an arsenal lat so does two

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:16.780 
expand here's an arsenal lat so does two
states<00:01:08.700> one<00:01:09.090> is<00:01:10.070> set<00:01:11.070> and<00:01:11.340> one<00:01:11.670> is<00:01:11.990> reset<00:01:13.640> so

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.570 

basically<00:01:17.790> when<00:01:18.689> he<00:01:18.780> hit<00:01:18.960> that<00:01:18.990> circle<00:01:19.740> it

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
basically when he hit that circle it

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.980 
basically when he hit that circle it
sets<00:01:21.060> a<00:01:21.270> wet<00:01:21.770> which<00:01:22.770> then<00:01:23.159> activates<00:01:23.430> us<00:01:24.210> one

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
sets a wet which then activates us one

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.880 
sets a wet which then activates us one
side<00:01:25.350> of<00:01:25.500> us<00:01:25.650> and<00:01:25.680> gates<00:01:27.710> so<00:01:28.710> one<00:01:29.009> part<00:01:29.310> of<00:01:29.460> it

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
side of us and gates so one part of it

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.319 
side of us and gates so one part of it
so<00:01:31.890> now<00:01:32.159> you're<00:01:33.000> ready<00:01:33.030> to<00:01:33.360> use<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:33.810> power<00:01:34.020> up

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:35.329 
so now you're ready to use the power up

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:37.969 
so now you're ready to use the power up
pressing<00:01:36.329> enter<00:01:36.659> just<00:01:37.049> activates<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.829> other

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
pressing enter just activates the other

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.609 
pressing enter just activates the other
half<00:01:38.340> of<00:01:38.520> and<00:01:38.820> gates<00:01:39.259> so<00:01:40.259> I'll<00:01:40.850> activate<00:01:41.850> this

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:42.619 
half of and gates so I'll activate this

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:47.060 
half of and gates so I'll activate this
and<00:01:44.329> now<00:01:45.329> it<00:01:45.509> gets<00:01:45.659> used<00:01:46.020> when<00:01:46.500> a<00:01:46.530> touch<00:01:46.860> of

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
and now it gets used when a touch of

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:53.200 
and now it gets used when a touch of
stats<00:01:49.040> since<00:01:50.040> cannons<00:01:51.259> clear<00:01:52.259> a<00:01:52.290> bit<00:01:52.500> weird

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
stats since cannons clear a bit weird

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.830 
stats since cannons clear a bit weird
they<00:01:54.210> fire<00:01:54.600> when<00:01:55.820> they<00:01:56.820> fire<00:01:57.149> when<00:01:57.479> you<00:01:57.600> let<00:01:57.810> go

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
they fire when they fire when you let go

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.520 
they fire when they fire when you let go
of<00:01:58.229> a<00:01:58.350> button<00:01:58.590> and<00:01:59.570> that<00:02:00.570> applies<00:02:01.140> see

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
of a button and that applies see

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.920 
of a button and that applies see
triggers<00:02:01.979> as<00:02:02.159> well<00:02:02.340> when<00:02:02.729> triggers<00:02:03.180> activated

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
triggers as well when triggers activated

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.619 
triggers as well when triggers activated
so<00:02:04.460> own<00:02:06.469> presta<00:02:07.700> pressing<00:02:08.700> if<00:02:08.849> brushing<00:02:09.479> up

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
so own presta pressing if brushing up

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.290 
so own presta pressing if brushing up
now<00:02:10.319> let<00:02:10.619> go<00:02:10.649> and<00:02:11.069> then<00:02:11.160> it<00:02:11.340> fires

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
now let go and then it fires

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.600 
now let go and then it fires
so<00:02:13.290> to<00:02:13.350> get<00:02:13.740> around<00:02:13.800> that<00:02:14.340> I<00:02:14.550> plus<00:02:15.000> and<00:02:15.240> then<00:02:15.360> I

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
so to get around that I plus and then I

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.570 
so to get around that I plus and then I
think<00:02:17.610> it's<00:02:17.760> called<00:02:18.000> an<00:02:18.150> aura<00:02:18.390> gates<00:02:19.580> or

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
think it's called an aura gates or

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.350 
think it's called an aura gates or
something<00:02:21.060> like<00:02:21.180> that<00:02:21.470> it's<00:02:22.470> really<00:02:23.040> simple

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
something like that it's really simple

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.510 
something like that it's really simple
it's<00:02:24.360> an<00:02:24.930> inverter<00:02:25.800> so<00:02:26.210> when<00:02:27.210> this<00:02:27.600> is<00:02:27.900> powered

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
it's an inverter so when this is powered

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.960 
it's an inverter so when this is powered
this<00:02:29.520> gets<00:02:29.880> unpowered<00:02:30.720> and<00:02:31.200> then<00:02:32.100> that<00:02:32.340> far<00:02:32.790> as

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
this gets unpowered and then that far as

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:40.310 
this gets unpowered and then that far as
this<00:02:35.180> what's<00:02:36.180> them<00:02:38.060> what's<00:02:39.060> then<00:02:39.360> um<00:02:39.570> sends<00:02:40.260> a

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
this what's them what's then um sends a

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:47.300 
this what's them what's then um sends a
pulse<00:02:40.790> to<00:02:41.790> this<00:02:43.100> and<00:02:45.050> it<00:02:46.050> resets<00:02:46.590> the<00:02:46.770> Arsenal

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
pulse to this and it resets the Arsenal

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:52.820 
pulse to this and it resets the Arsenal
or<00:02:47.430> latch<00:02:50.150> so<00:02:51.150> then<00:02:51.420> that<00:02:51.750> makes<00:02:52.020> us<00:02:52.320> retract

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
or latch so then that makes us retract

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.000 
or latch so then that makes us retract
and<00:02:53.070> it<00:02:53.250> disables<00:02:54.120> the<00:02:54.210> the<00:02:55.020> thrusters<00:02:55.590> at<00:02:55.860> the

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
and it disables the the thrusters at the

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:06.850 
and it disables the the thrusters at the
naval<00:02:56.400> the<00:02:56.550> dump<00:03:03.380> so<00:03:04.700> if<00:03:05.700> you<00:03:06.180> look<00:03:06.330> closely

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
naval the dump so if you look closely

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.830 
naval the dump so if you look closely
when<00:03:07.860> i<00:03:08.070> press<00:03:08.280> enter<00:03:08.490> this<00:03:08.880> will<00:03:08.940> touch<00:03:09.420> that

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
when i press enter this will touch that

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:15.350 
when i press enter this will touch that
this<00:03:10.710> looks<00:03:11.010> band<00:03:12.320> this<00:03:13.320> will<00:03:13.710> fire<00:03:14.040> and<00:03:14.430> then

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
this looks band this will fire and then

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.150 
this looks band this will fire and then
this<00:03:15.540> will<00:03:15.720> retract<00:03:16.170> and<00:03:16.410> that<00:03:16.590> will<00:03:16.739> retract
