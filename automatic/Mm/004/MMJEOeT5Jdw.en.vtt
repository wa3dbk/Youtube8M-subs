00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
it's dimmable and focusable and so let

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.410 
it's dimmable and focusable and so let
me<00:00:50.190> just<00:00:50.340> write<00:00:50.430> that<00:00:50.700> down<00:00:51.000> for<00:00:51.030> you<00:00:51.180> guys<00:00:51.329> so

big lights and stands you can put this
on<00:01:02.670> a<00:01:02.699> tripod<00:01:02.940> or<00:01:03.359> on<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.780> lighting<00:01:04.049> stand<00:01:04.260> or

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
on a tripod or on the lighting stand or

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.140 
on a tripod or on the lighting stand or
hand<00:01:04.799> hold<00:01:05.010> it<00:01:05.159> and<00:01:05.280> then<00:01:05.339> what<00:01:05.909> you<00:01:06.030> just

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
hand hold it and then what you just

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.520 
hand hold it and then what you just
trigger<00:01:06.570> it<00:01:06.720> and<00:01:06.869> you've<00:01:06.960> got<00:01:07.080> a<00:01:07.140> powerful

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
trigger it and you've got a powerful

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.109 
trigger it and you've got a powerful
burst<00:01:07.830> of<00:01:07.920> light<00:01:08.070> yes<00:01:08.430> as<00:01:08.670> I<00:01:08.760> say<00:01:08.970> it's

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
burst of light yes as I say it's

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.050 
burst of light yes as I say it's
dimmable<00:01:09.510> with<00:01:09.750> a<00:01:09.780> trigger<00:01:10.049> so<00:01:10.350> you<00:01:10.439> can<00:01:10.650> see

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
dimmable with a trigger so you can see

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.120 
dimmable with a trigger so you can see
the<00:01:12.060> level<00:01:12.270> fluctuating<00:01:13.110> you<00:01:13.619> also<00:01:13.890> have<00:01:14.040> the

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
the level fluctuating you also have the

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.670 
the level fluctuating you also have the
ability<00:01:14.220> to<00:01:14.549> lock<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.210> light<00:01:15.390> on<00:01:15.659> and<00:01:16.350> then

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
ability to lock the light on and then

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.920 
ability to lock the light on and then
dim<00:01:16.979> it<00:01:17.100> with<00:01:17.400> this<00:01:17.610> wheel<00:01:18.210> in<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.570> back<00:01:18.750> and

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
dim it with this wheel in the back and

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.270 
dim it with this wheel in the back and
that<00:01:18.990> would<00:01:19.170> be<00:01:19.259> for<00:01:19.439> more<00:01:19.590> stationary<00:01:20.040> use

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
that would be for more stationary use

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.399 
that would be for more stationary use
and<00:01:20.820> we<00:01:21.000> actually<00:01:21.600> have<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.869> controls<00:01:22.229> here

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
and we actually have the controls here

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.859 
and we actually have the controls here
to<00:01:22.590> like<00:01:23.130> a<00:01:23.159> real<00:01:23.549> spotlight<00:01:24.150> we<00:01:24.450> can<00:01:24.630> adjust

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
to like a real spotlight we can adjust

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.830 
to like a real spotlight we can adjust
this<00:01:25.080> right<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:25.439> focus<00:01:25.830> it<00:01:26.009> to<00:01:26.159> spot<00:01:26.659> spot<00:01:27.659> to

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
this right and focus it to spot spot to

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.450 
this right and focus it to spot spot to
flood<00:01:28.080> it's<00:01:28.470> got<00:01:28.619> about<00:01:28.799> a<00:01:28.860> six<00:01:29.130> to<00:01:29.280> one

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
flood it's got about a six to one

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.789 
flood it's got about a six to one
focusing<00:01:30.270> range<00:01:30.479> and<00:01:30.720> it's<00:01:31.020> quite<00:01:31.259> powerful

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
focusing range and it's quite powerful

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.109 
focusing range and it's quite powerful
from<00:01:31.950> a<00:01:32.040> distance<00:01:32.400> you<00:01:32.460> can<00:01:32.700> light<00:01:32.880> pretty

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
from a distance you can light pretty

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.120 
from a distance you can light pretty
effectively<00:01:33.540> from<00:01:33.780> 20<00:01:34.079> feet<00:01:34.110> or<00:01:34.380> so<00:01:34.500> and<00:01:34.710> I've

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
effectively from 20 feet or so and I've

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.800 
effectively from 20 feet or so and I've
noticed<00:01:35.579> unlike<00:01:35.939> certain<00:01:36.240> lights<00:01:36.570> this<00:01:36.750> is

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
noticed unlike certain lights this is

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.140 
noticed unlike certain lights this is
actually<00:01:37.290> seems<00:01:37.979> completely<00:01:38.220> silent<00:01:39.000> right

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
actually seems completely silent right

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.230 
actually seems completely silent right
and<00:01:39.360> it's<00:01:39.630> cool<00:01:39.810> to<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:40.020> touch<00:01:40.110> yeah<00:01:40.950> LEDs<00:01:41.549> as

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
and it's cool to the touch yeah LEDs as

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.149 
and it's cool to the touch yeah LEDs as
you<00:01:42.450> know<00:01:42.600> do<00:01:42.960> not<00:01:43.140> vent<00:01:43.590> their<00:01:43.770> heat<00:01:43.920> from<00:01:44.100> the

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
you know do not vent their heat from the

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.560 
you know do not vent their heat from the
front<00:01:44.490> they<00:01:44.610> vent<00:01:44.820> their<00:01:44.970> heat<00:01:45.090> from<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.299> back

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
front they vent their heat from the back

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.469 
front they vent their heat from the back
this<00:01:46.020> has<00:01:46.229> a<00:01:46.259> very<00:01:46.920> very<00:01:47.009> quiet<00:01:47.479> diaphragm

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
this has a very very quiet diaphragm

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.060 
this has a very very quiet diaphragm
cooling<00:01:48.930> system<00:01:49.290> so<00:01:49.409> it<00:01:49.530> does<00:01:49.649> have<00:01:49.799> a<00:01:49.860> cooling

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
cooling system so it does have a cooling

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.310 
cooling system so it does have a cooling
system<00:01:50.490> in<00:01:50.610> it<00:01:50.729> but<00:01:50.939> it's<00:01:51.119> very<00:01:51.360> quiet<00:01:51.570> alright

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
system in it but it's very quiet alright

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.960 
system in it but it's very quiet alright
so<00:01:52.590> this<00:01:52.740> seems<00:01:53.040> to<00:01:53.189> be<00:01:53.220> a<00:01:53.310> perfect<00:01:53.820> life<00:01:53.939> for

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
so this seems to be a perfect life for

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.789 
so this seems to be a perfect life for
those<00:01:54.270> of<00:01:54.390> you<00:01:54.479> looking<00:01:54.600> for<00:01:54.990> some<00:01:55.439> extra
