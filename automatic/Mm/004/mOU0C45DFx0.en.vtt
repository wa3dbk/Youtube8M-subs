and<00:01:44.540> highjack<00:01:45.540> was<00:01:45.720> obviously<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.200> easiest

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
and highjack was obviously the easiest

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.020 
and highjack was obviously the easiest
because<00:01:47.119> the<00:01:48.119> spawn<00:01:48.390> trap<00:01:48.659> is<00:01:48.840> really<00:01:49.049> easy

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
because the spawn trap is really easy

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.090 
because the spawn trap is really easy
but<00:01:51.030> yeah<00:01:51.180> I<00:01:51.210> did<00:01:51.570> exactly<00:01:52.530> what<00:01:52.590> they<00:01:52.860> said

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
but yeah I did exactly what they said

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.429 
but yeah I did exactly what they said
and<00:01:53.399> there's<00:01:53.909> no<00:01:54.329> nuke<00:01:54.540> so<00:01:54.899> I<00:01:54.930> mean<00:01:55.170> I'm<00:01:55.320> not

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
is a metal you get a 25 killstreak metal

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.150 
is a metal you get a 25 killstreak metal
and<00:02:19.060> it's<00:02:19.870> like<00:02:20.050> brutal<00:02:20.590> or<00:02:20.710> something<00:02:21.040> like

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
and it's like brutal or something like

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.850 
and it's like brutal or something like
that<00:02:21.220> and<00:02:21.750> then<00:02:22.750> if<00:02:22.990> you<00:02:23.110> want<00:02:23.320> a<00:02:23.380> free-for-all

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
that and then if you want a free-for-all

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.710 
that and then if you want a free-for-all
going<00:02:24.160> 30<00:02:24.460> no<00:02:24.640> you<00:02:24.700> get<00:02:24.910> another<00:02:25.180> metal<00:02:25.540> that's

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
going 30 no you get another metal that's

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.860 
going 30 no you get another metal that's
called<00:02:25.960> nuclear<00:02:26.610> or<00:02:27.610> something<00:02:28.000> like<00:02:28.120> that<00:02:28.300> so

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
called nuclear or something like that so

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.110 
called nuclear or something like that so
maybe<00:02:29.110> I<00:02:29.230> thought<00:02:29.560> after<00:02:30.130> I<00:02:30.610> did<00:02:30.820> the<00:02:30.940> game<00:02:31.090> I

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
maybe I thought after I did the game I

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.910 
maybe I thought after I did the game I
was<00:02:31.300> like<00:02:31.450> wait<00:02:31.690> did<00:02:31.900> I<00:02:31.990> just<00:02:32.200> not<00:02:32.290> like<00:02:32.590> to<00:02:32.770> see

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
was like wait did I just not like to see

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.350 
was like wait did I just not like to see
that<00:02:33.100> I<00:02:33.130> got<00:02:33.370> the<00:02:33.520> scorestreak<00:02:34.000> because<00:02:34.180> maybe

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
that I got the scorestreak because maybe

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:35.910 
that I got the scorestreak because maybe
it<00:02:34.600> didn't<00:02:34.840> pop<00:02:35.020> up<00:02:35.080> on<00:02:35.350> my<00:02:35.440> screen<00:02:35.620> like<00:02:35.830> I

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
it didn't pop up on my screen like I

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.110 
it didn't pop up on my screen like I
thought<00:02:36.070> I<00:02:36.130> was<00:02:36.220> going<00:02:36.400> to<00:02:36.520> and<00:02:36.790> then<00:02:36.850> I<00:02:36.910> just

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
thought I was going to and then I just

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.090 
thought I was going to and then I just
had<00:02:37.270> to<00:02:37.390> call<00:02:37.570> in<00:02:37.750> or<00:02:37.870> something<00:02:38.080> so<00:02:38.830> I<00:02:38.860> we

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
had to call in or something so I we

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.160 
had to call in or something so I we
watched<00:02:39.300> rewatched<00:02:40.300> the<00:02:40.480> replay<00:02:40.840> and<00:02:40.900> stuff

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
watched rewatched the replay and stuff

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:42.450 
watched rewatched the replay and stuff
and<00:02:41.290> there<00:02:41.380> was<00:02:41.470> no<00:02:41.710> scorestreak<00:02:42.280> that<00:02:42.430> I

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:42.460 
and there was no scorestreak that I

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:45.750 
and there was no scorestreak that I
missed<00:02:42.820> and<00:02:43.950> so<00:02:44.950> I<00:02:44.980> knew<00:02:45.370> I<00:02:45.400> didn't<00:02:45.670> do<00:02:45.730> that

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
missed and so I knew I didn't do that

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.610 
missed and so I knew I didn't do that
but<00:02:46.150> at<00:02:46.540> the<00:02:46.630> end<00:02:46.750> of<00:02:46.810> this<00:02:46.870> video<00:02:47.020> I<00:02:47.230> will<00:02:47.410> show

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
but at the end of this video I will show

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.260 
but at the end of this video I will show
you<00:02:47.650> guys<00:02:47.830> the<00:02:48.070> titles<00:02:48.490> that<00:02:48.610> I<00:02:48.670> got<00:02:48.850> for<00:02:49.150> it

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
you guys the titles that I got for it

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:52.110 
you guys the titles that I got for it
which<00:02:49.930> I<00:02:50.200> mean<00:02:50.650> it<00:02:51.190> was<00:02:51.430> worth<00:02:51.670> it<00:02:51.880> for<00:02:51.910> the

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
which I mean it was worth it for the

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.340 
which I mean it was worth it for the
titles<00:02:52.420> because<00:02:52.540> the<00:02:52.690> titles<00:02:52.990> are<00:02:53.110> actually

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
titles because the titles are actually

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:56.670 
titles because the titles are actually
really<00:02:53.650> really<00:02:53.770> cool<00:02:53.920> so<00:02:54.460> I<00:02:54.960> guess<00:02:55.960> that<00:02:56.380> but<00:02:56.620> I

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
really really cool so I guess that but I

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.200 
really really cool so I guess that but I
mean<00:02:56.860> for<00:02:57.070> how<00:02:57.190> many<00:02:57.250> kills<00:02:57.640> you<00:02:57.790> have<00:02:57.940> to<00:02:58.060> get

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:58.210 
mean for how many kills you have to get

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:59.070 
mean for how many kills you have to get
and<00:02:58.360> stuff<00:02:58.540> I<00:02:58.750> mean

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
and stuff I mean

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.140 
and stuff I mean
and<00:02:59.260> since<00:02:59.920> my<00:03:00.070> hopes<00:03:00.310> were<00:03:00.430> so<00:03:00.700> up<00:03:00.850> that<00:03:01.000> there

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
and since my hopes were so up that there

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.960 
and since my hopes were so up that there
was<00:03:01.300> a<00:03:01.410> nuke<00:03:02.410> when<00:03:02.620> I<00:03:02.650> was<00:03:02.860> like<00:03:02.980> 20<00:03:03.430> and<00:03:03.520> oh<00:03:03.670> my

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
was a nuke when I was like 20 and oh my

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.700 
was a nuke when I was like 20 and oh my
heart<00:03:04.270> was<00:03:04.450> literally<00:03:04.720> like<00:03:04.930> pounding<00:03:05.410> so

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:05.710 
heart was literally like pounding so

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:06.900 
heart was literally like pounding so
much<00:03:05.920> because<00:03:06.190> I<00:03:06.280> thought<00:03:06.460> I<00:03:06.490> was<00:03:06.580> gonna<00:03:06.670> get<00:03:06.880> a

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
much because I thought I was gonna get a

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:08.910 
much because I thought I was gonna get a
nuke<00:03:07.090> and<00:03:07.360> I'm<00:03:07.450> like<00:03:07.630> a<00:03:07.660> complete<00:03:08.080> nerd<00:03:08.320> and

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.830 
nuke and I'm like a complete nerd and
I'm<00:03:09.040> like<00:03:09.220> a<00:03:09.250> complete<00:03:09.670> nerd<00:03:09.910> so<00:03:10.120> I<00:03:10.180> thought<00:03:10.450> it

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
I'm like a complete nerd so I thought it

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.400 
I'm like a complete nerd so I thought it
was<00:03:11.350> gonna<00:03:11.860> be<00:03:11.950> awesome<00:03:12.460> but<00:03:13.150> once<00:03:13.870> I<00:03:14.020> got<00:03:14.140> the

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
was gonna be awesome but once I got the

the<00:04:52.330> nukes<00:04:52.630> from<00:04:52.870> like<00:04:53.020> mono<00:04:53.230> fair<00:04:53.440> to<00:04:53.590> which<00:04:53.740> I

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
the nukes from like mono fair to which I

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:55.620 
the nukes from like mono fair to which I
liked<00:04:54.130> but<00:04:54.580> since<00:04:54.820> they<00:04:54.940> didn't<00:04:55.120> end<00:04:55.300> the<00:04:55.420> game

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:55.630 
liked but since they didn't end the game

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:56.700 
liked but since they didn't end the game
like<00:04:55.840> I<00:04:55.960> didn't<00:04:56.140> think<00:04:56.320> there<00:04:56.500> were<00:04:56.590> that

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:56.710 
like I didn't think there were that

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:58.230 
like I didn't think there were that
really<00:04:56.950> like<00:04:57.220> special<00:04:57.670> together<00:04:57.820> like<00:04:58.120> I

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:58.240 
really like special together like I

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.310 
really like special together like I
would<00:04:58.360> have<00:04:58.420> liked<00:04:58.660> it<00:04:58.750> more<00:04:58.810> if<00:04:58.990> the<00:04:59.110> end<00:04:59.230> of

00:04:59.310 --> 00:04:59.320 
would have liked it more if the end of

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.470 
would have liked it more if the end of
the<00:04:59.380> game<00:04:59.560> so<00:04:59.590> like<00:05:00.010> when<00:05:00.760> I<00:05:00.790> saw<00:05:01.120> that<00:05:01.360> it<00:05:01.450> was

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:01.480 
the game so like when I saw that it was

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:02.910 
the game so like when I saw that it was
in<00:05:01.690> black<00:05:01.900> ops<00:05:02.140> 2<00:05:02.290> that's<00:05:02.470> why<00:05:02.560> I<00:05:02.620> wanted<00:05:02.830> to

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:02.920 
in black ops 2 that's why I wanted to

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:04.230 
in black ops 2 that's why I wanted to
get<00:05:03.040> it<00:05:03.130> really<00:05:03.280> bad<00:05:03.490> because<00:05:03.700> I<00:05:03.790> was<00:05:03.880> like<00:05:04.000> yes

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:04.240 
get it really bad because I was like yes

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.000 
get it really bad because I was like yes
they<00:05:04.420> brought<00:05:04.570> the<00:05:04.720> nuke<00:05:04.900> back<00:05:05.170> 25<00:05:05.650> kills

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.010 
they brought the nuke back 25 kills

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:07.830 
they brought the nuke back 25 kills
without<00:05:06.280> using<00:05:06.670> kill<00:05:06.820> streaks<00:05:07.180> and<00:05:07.420> it<00:05:07.630> ends

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840 
without using kill streaks and it ends

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.090 
without using kill streaks and it ends
the<00:05:07.930> round<00:05:08.080> so<00:05:08.290> it's<00:05:08.410> perfect<00:05:08.800> like<00:05:08.920> it's

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:09.100 
the round so it's perfect like it's

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.160 
the round so it's perfect like it's
exactly<00:05:09.400> what<00:05:09.700> I<00:05:09.730> wanted<00:05:10.090> but<00:05:10.270> then<00:05:10.870> it<00:05:10.990> turns

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:11.170 
exactly what I wanted but then it turns

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:12.510 
exactly what I wanted but then it turns
out<00:05:11.320> and<00:05:11.470> then<00:05:11.590> right<00:05:11.740> there<00:05:11.950> look<00:05:12.190> at<00:05:12.370> the

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:14.730 
guys that the titles are really cool at
least<00:06:12.510> but<00:06:13.510> it<00:06:13.630> was<00:06:13.720> kind<00:06:13.930> of<00:06:13.990> a<00:06:14.080> letdown<00:06:14.260> still

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:14.740 
least but it was kind of a letdown still

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:16.680 
least but it was kind of a letdown still
so<00:06:15.070> I<00:06:15.340> know<00:06:15.700> that<00:06:15.940> machinima<00:06:16.270> does<00:06:16.480> these

so I know that machinima does these

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:18.780 
so I know that machinima does these
types<00:06:16.900> of<00:06:17.080> things<00:06:17.260> but<00:06:17.560> I<00:06:17.980> was<00:06:18.280> really<00:06:18.490> hoping

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:18.790 
types of things but I was really hoping

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:20.340 
types of things but I was really hoping
that<00:06:18.910> there<00:06:19.090> this<00:06:19.600> one<00:06:19.780> was<00:06:19.930> like<00:06:20.050> real
