the dt opener alright so there's a

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.540 
the dt opener alright so there's a
couple<00:00:26.970> things<00:00:27.269> we<00:00:27.570> need<00:00:27.720> to<00:00:27.779> discuss<00:00:27.900> um<00:00:28.550> your

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
couple things we need to discuss um your

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.009 
couple things we need to discuss um your
first<00:00:29.760> pylon<00:00:30.029> should<00:00:30.480> be<00:00:30.570> behind<00:00:30.929> your

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
first pylon should be behind your

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.680 
first pylon should be behind your
internal<00:00:31.349> lines<00:00:31.500> somewhere<00:00:32.130> because<00:00:32.279> if<00:00:33.210> your

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
internal lines somewhere because if your

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.900 
internal lines somewhere because if your
opponent<00:00:33.899> goes<00:00:34.230> Stargate<00:00:34.800> and<00:00:34.950> goes<00:00:35.430> Oracle

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
opponent goes Stargate and goes Oracle

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.830 
opponent goes Stargate and goes Oracle
you<00:00:36.510> need<00:00:36.719> these<00:00:36.899> pathways<00:00:37.290> to<00:00:37.739> be<00:00:37.860> clear<00:00:38.840> so

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
you need these pathways to be clear so

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.410 
you need these pathways to be clear so
your<00:00:39.960> units<00:00:40.200> can<00:00:40.350> easily<00:00:40.680> move<00:00:41.120> to<00:00:42.120> where<00:00:42.239> the

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
your units can easily move to where the

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.330 
your units can easily move to where the
Oracle<00:00:42.600> is<00:00:44.870> I<00:00:45.870> like<00:00:46.500> how<00:00:46.649> I<00:00:46.680> for<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.010> Pilon

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
Oracle is I like how I for the Pilon

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.590 
Oracle is I like how I for the Pilon
know<00:00:47.610> where<00:00:47.789> where<00:00:47.969> I<00:00:48.000> just<00:00:48.059> was<00:00:48.329> talking

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
i get to his base immediately Chuck does

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.530 
i get to his base immediately Chuck does
he<00:01:12.260> have<00:01:12.290> a<00:01:12.410> second<00:01:12.800> assimilator<00:01:13.330> how<00:01:14.330> many

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
does he have in each of simulator is he

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.200 
does he have in each of simulator is he
pulling<00:01:18.140> a<00:01:18.530> lot<00:01:18.680> of<00:01:18.830> chrono<00:01:19.070> boost<00:01:19.310> and<00:01:19.610> is

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210 
pulling a lot of chrono boost and is

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:21.790 
pulling a lot of chrono boost and is
what<00:01:20.540> is<00:01:20.660> his<00:01:20.780> cyber<00:01:20.990> Corps<00:01:21.200> timing<00:01:21.560> well<00:01:21.740> it

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:21.800 
what is his cyber Corps timing well it

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.410 
what is his cyber Corps timing well it
looks<00:01:21.950> like<00:01:22.040> our<00:01:22.280> cyber<00:01:22.550> whore<00:01:22.850> timing<00:01:23.270> oh

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
looks like our cyber whore timing oh

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.420 
looks like our cyber whore timing oh
look<00:01:23.750> ours<00:01:23.990> isn't<00:01:24.200> even<00:01:24.470> up<00:01:24.560> yet<00:01:24.620> and<00:01:24.890> he

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430 
look ours isn't even up yet and he

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.000 
look ours isn't even up yet and he
already<00:01:25.520> has<00:01:25.640> his<00:01:25.970> that's<00:01:26.690> a<00:01:26.840> pretty<00:01:27.080> big<00:01:27.260> deal

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.010 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:34.630 

so<00:01:31.010> he<00:01:31.400> obviously<00:01:31.760> did<00:01:32.210> like<00:01:32.330> a<00:01:32.360> 10<00:01:32.570> gate<00:01:33.610> so<00:01:34.610> i

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
so he obviously did like a 10 gate so i

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:40.090 
so he obviously did like a 10 gate so i
would<00:01:35.120> expect<00:01:35.360> some<00:01:35.660> pressure<00:01:35.869> to<00:01:36.110> come<00:01:39.100> even

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
would expect some pressure to come even

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.050 
would expect some pressure to come even
though<00:01:40.130> he<00:01:40.250> doesn't<00:01:40.340> have<00:01:40.550> a<00:01:40.610> ton<00:01:40.790> of<00:01:40.850> credit

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
though he doesn't have a ton of credit

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.469 
though he doesn't have a ton of credit
which<00:01:41.270> saves<00:01:42.820> but<00:01:43.820> he<00:01:43.880> is<00:01:44.000> quinta<00:01:44.240> boosting

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
which saves but he is quinta boosting

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:46.690 
which saves but he is quinta boosting
cyber<00:01:44.750> that's<00:01:45.020> another<00:01:45.229> sign<00:01:45.530> I'm<00:01:46.490> throwing

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700

set up a pylon for dt shrine as we get

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.340 
set up a pylon for dt shrine as we get
the<00:01:58.790> DC<00:01:59.030> shine<00:01:59.270> going<00:01:59.600> the<00:01:59.960> second<00:02:00.350> gateway<00:02:02.350> so

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
the DC shine going the second gateway so

have went to three would had a faster

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.240 
have went to three would had a faster
exfil<00:02:44.390> now<00:02:44.569> I<00:02:45.049> saw<00:02:45.319> he<00:02:45.530> was<00:02:45.680> going<00:02:45.860> into<00:02:46.010> Robo

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
exfil now I saw he was going into Robo

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.569 
exfil now I saw he was going into Robo
facility<00:02:47.349> so<00:02:48.349> I'm<00:02:48.440> going<00:02:48.650> into<00:02:48.799> Robo<00:02:48.980> facility

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:49.579 
facility so I'm going into Robo facility

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:56.230 
facility so I'm going into Robo facility
as<00:02:49.670> well

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:56.240 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.540 

so<00:02:57.110> just<00:02:57.260> trying<00:02:57.440> to<00:02:57.500> pressure<00:02:57.680> it's<00:02:58.400> not

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.550 
so just trying to pressure it's not

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:01.899 
so just trying to pressure it's not
going<00:02:58.760> well<00:02:58.850> for<00:02:58.970> him

00:03:01.899 --> 00:03:01.909 

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:05.000 

also<00:03:02.909> have<00:03:02.999> blink<00:03:03.349> we're<00:03:04.349> not<00:03:04.469> sure<00:03:04.620> if<00:03:04.650> blink

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
also have blink we're not sure if blink

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.809 
also have blink we're not sure if blink
was<00:03:05.189> needed<00:03:05.579> I<00:03:06.739> think<00:03:07.739> if<00:03:07.920> I<00:03:08.069> play<00:03:08.430> this<00:03:08.459> game

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:08.819 
was needed I think if I play this game

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:13.250 
was needed I think if I play this game
again<00:03:08.879> I<00:03:09.299> wouldn't<00:03:09.569> have<00:03:09.719> gone<00:03:09.840> blink<00:03:12.260> that's

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
again I wouldn't have gone blink that's

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.410 
again I wouldn't have gone blink that's
just<00:03:13.469> me<00:03:13.620> so<00:03:14.609> I<00:03:14.639> went<00:03:14.819> ob's<00:03:15.109> making<00:03:16.109> immortals

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420

you're a diamond I was just suggesting

it it's just to cost effective
so<00:04:03.090> I'm<00:04:03.150> working<00:04:03.450> a<00:04:03.510> few<00:04:03.600> units<00:04:03.900> should<00:04:04.020> be

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
so I'm working a few units should be

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:05.420 
so I'm working a few units should be
getting<00:04:04.320> plus-one<00:04:04.590> attack<00:04:04.620> soon<00:04:05.010> as<00:04:05.190> soon<00:04:05.340> as

Christmas teen-age somebody start

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:21.580 
Christmas teen-age somebody start
dropping<00:04:19.220> and<00:04:20.220> he's<00:04:20.430> just<00:04:20.549> going<00:04:20.700> to<00:04:20.760> tap<00:04:20.940> out

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:24.020 
dropping and he's just going to tap out
which<00:04:22.590> is<00:04:22.740> probably<00:04:22.950> a<00:04:23.130> good<00:04:23.190> idea<00:04:23.370> I<00:04:23.700> mean<00:04:23.880> he

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
which is probably a good idea I mean he

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:25.850 
which is probably a good idea I mean he
had<00:04:24.120> probably<00:04:24.300> lost<00:04:24.720> the<00:04:24.900> game<00:04:25.050> as<00:04:25.290> you<00:04:25.710> can

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
had probably lost the game as you can

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.570 
had probably lost the game as you can
see<00:04:26.040> supply<00:04:26.400> wise<00:04:28.070> but<00:04:29.070> from<00:04:29.250> here<00:04:29.370> I<00:04:29.430> would

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
see supply wise but from here I would

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.650 
see supply wise but from here I would

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
have went you know plus I with range but

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.470 
have went you know plus I with range but
that's<00:04:33.870> not<00:04:34.080> really<00:04:34.880> what<00:04:35.880> I<00:04:35.940> wanted<00:04:36.210> tour

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:36.480 
that's not really what I wanted tour
