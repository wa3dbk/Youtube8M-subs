00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:14.490
 Welcome to today is a topic 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:17.220
 that employs a lot of beginners 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.439
 namely in the fact that somehow 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.910
 everyone somehow tells something else 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.260
 the one says you should do it that way 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.910
 others just say that's what they do and so on 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.730
 continue and stay and it will be natural 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.830
 So the question was what was going on 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:33.809
 why is this and so on and so on 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.920
 continue the big as well as own problem 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.290
 is or not 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:41.239
 So the big thing in this whole 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:44.489
 training bodybuilding stuff is that 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:48.289
 every human being is individual and for 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:51.149
 every person is individually 

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:54.390
 to achieve his goals, that is to say 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:57.030
 So there are just as many people 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.160
 train as many ways there are 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.590
 also to reach his goal 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.570
 typical sentence many paths lead to 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.729
 rome so if i take ten people 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.340
 and now we assume that all ten 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.780
 are any really experienced 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.640
 people who have been for 20 30 years 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.909
 yes, people also train 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.350
 real real fitness gurus or 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.259
 bodybuilding courage or whatever 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.270
 then all ten of you will get something 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.360
 other than target at least some 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.280
 other important principles 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.900
 they are always the same, so it will be you 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.150
 No one tells you you only need one 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.310
 Hour sleep does not need any regeneration 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:36.420
 Do you recognize the week pumping go 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.890
 You do not have to sleep that much 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.060
 just do not eat anything you need 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.710
 no white so basic things yes 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.479
 this scaffold what is there for this 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.110
 this is the same for everyone 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:51.030
 but of course there is such a thing 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.439
 different vegan says you have to do so 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.000
 train the other one says you have to 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.470
 then train the hottest three 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.600
 Although it is with the should have picked up 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.310
 must take this exercise of the exercise 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.140
 Repeat range of one says you 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.240
 have to eat so said you have to eat like that 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.930
 must be more less you have to be more white 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.930
 less protein 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:11.290
 radio no cardio then diets 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.230
 do not have to do it all the time 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:16.569
 blah blah blah blah blah 1000 million 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:19.239
 things and that of course deny it clearly 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:20.620
 somewhere they are all right that is 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:22.239
 important to know so not that he 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.980
 think okay he has a right now or 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:25.720
 others wrong no it's not about 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:30.400
 is right or wrong is about a 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:33.040
 different and the most important thing we do 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.510
 have to learn and learn to do that 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.010
 not really advanced either 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.530
 learn or notice that the fuel is 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:41.350
 to find his own way 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.180
 So this really is with the years 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:45.040
 of the training and if he really up 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.319
 respects your body and hear he wants 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.150
 have tried many things then you will 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:50.560
 always see little things where he says 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.959
 I'm better at that 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.580
 works better with me and so 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:58.180
 further before we went around the world out 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:03:00.340
 ask if he is able and 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.930
 you will shape your own way and 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.790
 So the year is a few years 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.850
 useful because he has a lot for it 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.560
 Try it and it would be nice 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.430
 be okay that's the perfect way for 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.870
 Probably me one somewhere 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.880
 scales that expects something 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.470
 genetically dna i know and you say 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.060
 have as badly just there in 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.950
 and then you have that 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.450
 perfect muscle building cheeky and 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.190
 That's why we always do 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.540
 different progress times 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.340
 Let's try things out that way 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.540
 well with us sometimes problems work 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.920
 thing from this good with us 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.480
 my mobile work out more thing 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.640
 just halfway working 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.200
 Still, that's not all that takes extremely long 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.090
 functionally adapt our body 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.160
 So I have to do a training 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.390
 not necessarily for a while now 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.720
 a few more weeks will be right 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:42.220
 few months or even years depending on 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.630
 i have to somehow train my training 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:46.600
 nutritionally a bit 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:48.100
 change because with others better 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.570
 get along and therefore my body has 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:49.989
 new ones can grow and so on 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:52.329
 and so on 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:54.040
 The lama things as I said so must 

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:55.180
 but you are somehow involved 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.430
 Of course you have to start now 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.840
 Therefore, as I said to forgive 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.910
 of course a big problem because they 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.840
 just three people ask all kinds of 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:03.310
 youtube tells something 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.860
 another experience tells something 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:07.810
 other the width knew the three-door 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:10.360
 from the club doctor something else so we 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:13.450
 had now purely meant 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:17.109
 station the most important thing is not you 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:20.229
 crazy because in the end it does not matter 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:23.410
 what you do no matter what you do means 

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:26.770
 even if you start with a sevens 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:29.770
 split yes 15 times a week poor biceps 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:32.169
 triceps diet mcdonald's doner kebab 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:35.560
 You have not seen burger king 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:37.300
 you will still build muscle yes 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.590
 somehow your body is already building 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.600
 somehow, even if not exactly 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:44.770
 perfect to me but suddenly that here 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:47.800
 I would not want to do the perfect job 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:50.610
 whose one is looking for a way through 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:52.720
 a person or an article or 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:55.419
 something a forum or something synonymous 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.490
 always from where you say tipping trust 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:05:00.460
 I want that sounds good to me 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:02.680
 comprehensible and then act accordingly 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:04.289
 always trained after nutrition and 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:08.110
 training and, of course, regeneration and 

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:09.729
 stay for a while no matter whether I 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:11.500
 now always something else told 

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:13.150
 contrary to so slowly by not against 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.770
 which basic things understand 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:16.450
 but a basic thing would be to 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:17.740
 example what training I am now 

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:20.260
 train now five times a week 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:21.880
 biceps and neglect my legs 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.680
 my back and my chest because of me 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:25.960
 say I want to have fat arms that is 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.620
 nonsense with sauce again and again increasingly 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.229
 rhein thrown 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:32.710
 but it stays ok 

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:34.599
 at least 8 12 16 weeks and then choose 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:37.030
 you just see what happens when 

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:39.099
 little happens or does not happen then 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:41.020
 do you mind what could be okay 

00:05:39.099 --> 00:05:43.000
 Maybe I change now why is 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:44.430
 nothing happens or little happens when 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.580
 you can hardly see any progress 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:49.900
 keep going but also from 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:52.930
 body does not listen because now any 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:54.760
 someone said yes your poor or 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:56.289
 your breast is so small what are you doing 

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:58.389
 because for chest oh that's just rubbish 

00:05:56.289 --> 00:06:00.340
 do and leave that and the same 

00:05:58.389 --> 00:06:04.000
 oh yes my gold has to overturn everything then 

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:05.200
 again I have to order now with 818 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.400
 train are technically ten 

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:08.260
 I'll be better as well 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:09.300
 go to six and you do not have 

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.500
 seen 

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:12.840
 Do not worry so much 

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:15.849
 really does not matter 

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:17.800
 believe me the pros yes that is not sitting 

00:06:15.849 --> 00:06:19.719
 the whole day there and the busy ones 

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:21.250
 livelihood and think oh yes 

00:06:19.719 --> 00:06:23.590
 how could I now now is correct 

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:25.450
 now if they just do it 

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:27.280
 and if the basic exercises in the 

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:28.360
 have training then that's enough 

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:32.289
 completely off 

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:33.400
 the fact that you may not be 

00:06:32.289 --> 00:06:35.409
 progress is not necessarily 

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:36.849
 So your diet stays with you 

00:06:35.409 --> 00:06:39.219
 anything in a diet 

00:06:36.849 --> 00:06:41.140
 at 1 training system or wine drinks 

00:06:39.219 --> 00:06:42.760
 or whatever and does that 

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:44.650
 and see what happens and if he does 

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:48.370
 really nobody should notice any time 

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:49.450
 time is three four months that 

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:51.520
 nothing has happened then make yourself 

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:54.520
 again thought about a difference 

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:56.620
 stay tuned for another four months 

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:58.659
 or change something again et cetera 3c 

00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:03.940
 and then you will if you still have 

00:06:58.659 --> 00:07:05.650
 Body really listens to what am I good at 

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:07.000
 rightly so, it also matters 

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:09.310
 what am I doing well with 

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.780
 then you will also be good at that 

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:12.539
 progress and over time 

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:14.650
 will you also understand a lot? 

00:07:12.539 --> 00:07:16.690
 some things get a bit easier as well 

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:17.919
 I will always fall and say this 

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:19.930
 thoughts do not start from today 

00:07:17.919 --> 00:07:20.979
 Tomorrow turns back and forth 

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:23.680
 you also notice it is faster 

00:07:20.979 --> 00:07:25.450
 as always, do this whole oh yes 

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:28.630
 I will imagine now again 

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:31.510
 you can not be extremely wrong yes 

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:35.229
 there is not this i have so 

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:38.349
 trained and it brought zero 

00:07:35.229 --> 00:07:38.820
 as I said , the mainstay does not get 

00:07:38.349 --> 00:07:42.700
 on 

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:44.139
 it does not generate so little yes and yes 

00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:45.669
 Well, training is not like that 

00:07:44.139 --> 00:07:48.599
 extremely important as diet and 

00:07:45.669 --> 00:07:50.830
 regeneration in the ratio seen now 

00:07:48.599 --> 00:07:52.270
 ok again much the same was now 

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:53.889
 Not so much but a few thoughts 

00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:57.370
 which should make you easy especially 

00:07:53.889 --> 00:07:59.940
 as a beginner quite quite important that 

00:07:57.370 --> 00:07:59.940
 it was from me
