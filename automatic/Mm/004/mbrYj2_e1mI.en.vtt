00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:16.590
 the condor of the family of vultures is the largest of the flying birds 

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:20.839
 in South America and in particular throughout the Andean mountain range 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:25.869
 It is also an emblem and a symbol of the indigenous cultures of the diverse 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:28.869
 peoples prior to colonization 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.600
 both in Peru and in Ecuador, the inhabitants of the Andean populations 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.520
 they feel proud of the diversity of their landscapes of their fauna and flora 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.090
 although both are scarce as we go up 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.680
 nature has shaped the mountainous and snowy landscapes of the 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.680
 andes against those who strongly contrasted coastal strips 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.680
 desert and sandy 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.979
 the great Andean mountain range 

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:06.940
 that crosses the entire South American continent 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.100
 it encloses in its route numerous volcanoes some of them in active 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.260
 two 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:19.540
 in Ecuador 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.450
 many expeditionary and mountaineering tourists 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.680
 they want to have the experience of their life as chimborazo 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.899
 an ancient extinct volcano that is located near riobamba 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.670
 the chimborazo has 14 glaciers and it is still possible to observe in its 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:38.380
 slopes 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.380
 the remains of the gigantic currents of solidified lava 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.140
 who talk about their strong activity 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.740
 the name chimborazo means revives death 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.590
 you can still see its five domes in craters joined together 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.780
 for lava and ashes 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.380
 the seas of appreciable clouds from the summit help the relaxation of the 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.380
 expeditionary 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:16.560
 bull 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.529
 although 

00:02:17.529 --> 00:02:18.889
 co 

00:02:18.889 --> 00:02:19.919
 although 

00:02:19.919 --> 00:02:25.649
 the activity of another volcano whose paid the rumiÃ±ahui formed for centuries with 

00:02:25.649 --> 00:02:28.649
 its lava rivers a whole valley that I think 

00:02:29.169 --> 00:02:32.619
 but stronger will be the experience of his life an active volcano 

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:35.619
 as the cotopaxi also in ecuador 

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:42.389
 the character of the cotopaxi is located at five thousand 897 meters high 

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:45.789
 It is considered the highest active volcano in the world 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:51.010
 because of its location it belongs to the eastern Andean branch of the volcanic cones 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.099
 Ecuadorians 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:54.810
 ecuador also has 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.810
 with 19 other active volcanoes 

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:07.589
 point the desolation of this dry and arid landscape is only attenuated by 

00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:11.919
 the visual smoothness of the snow and the sporadic verdure that not far away 

00:03:11.919 --> 00:03:14.919
 we return to recover 

00:03:19.169 --> 00:03:23.509
 from the 4,000 meters of Andean height the vegetation is very scarce and 

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:24.659
 selective 

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:27.719
 water chocair or tall flowers are a notable exception 

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:32.659
 his image is a symbol and for that reason they appear in the emblems of many 

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:35.659
 Sandinistas 

00:03:42.399 --> 00:03:45.399
 Napo is one of the main rivers of the country 

00:03:46.089 --> 00:03:50.159
 It comes down from the eastern Andean slopes and flows into the Amazon 

00:03:50.969 --> 00:03:55.309
 With its waters it allows a refreshing vegetal landscape of characteristics 

00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:57.299
 amazonian 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:02.140
 the richness of these forests hits from the beginning the ecological consciences 

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:04.049
 of the majority of its visitors 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:07.049
 however little sensitive they are 

00:04:09.529 --> 00:04:13.979
 the flora and fauna that they contain are treasures worthy of being saved 

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:15.539
 jealously 

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:19.149
 a future value whose loss starts to be a part of Copenhagen 

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:25.199
 the bow topped the stick that grows hugging and sometimes drowning others 

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:29.270
 arboreal species is one of the infinite natural curiosities of 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.689
 these jungles 

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:35.009
 spokesmen 

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:37.059
 drago blood 

00:04:37.059 --> 00:04:40.259
 peace now to you 

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:45.139
 these societies 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:48.139
 while jorge maier 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:55.270
 the natives conserve numerous and active among means of natural medicine 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:58.270
 that they extract from the plants and trees in the jungle 

00:04:58.879 --> 00:05:03.649
 for many locals the plant world encloses almost magical virtues 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:10.199
 The enormous wealth of the Ecuadorian fauna can be seen, above all, in the 

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:13.199
 wetter lands of the north and east of the country 

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:17.629
 in the jungle live more than one thousand 500 different bird species 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:21.590
 and also for and a broad representation of all the great 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:26.639
 reptiles such as boas plus Achilles monkeys and many other animals 

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:35.039
 a wonderful habitat but in need of protection 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:38.509
 due to multiple uncontrolled felling 

00:05:38.509 --> 00:05:40.080
 to poaching 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.319
 to traffic and trade of animals 

00:05:42.319 --> 00:05:46.150
 and other more useful hazards such as pollution speculation 

00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:48.999
 causing slow deforestation
