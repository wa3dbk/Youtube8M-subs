more than anything else it's quite

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.540 
more than anything else it's quite
addictive<00:00:18.390> I<00:00:18.630> think<00:00:19.140> once<00:00:19.380> you<00:00:19.470> start<00:00:19.560> it's

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
addictive I think once you start it's

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.849 
addictive I think once you start it's
very<00:00:20.850> difficult<00:00:21.270> to<00:00:21.330> even<00:00:21.420> up<00:00:21.660> and<00:00:22.439> it's<00:00:22.650> very

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
very difficult to even up and it's very

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.470 
very difficult to even up and it's very
difficult<00:00:23.510> to<00:00:24.710> stop<00:00:25.710> going<00:00:26.550> further<00:00:26.849> on<00:00:27.029> being

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
difficult to stop going further on being

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.859 
difficult to stop going further on being
more<00:00:27.660> outrageous<00:00:28.519> it's<00:00:29.519> not<00:00:30.359> very<00:00:30.720> much

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
more outrageous it's not very much
