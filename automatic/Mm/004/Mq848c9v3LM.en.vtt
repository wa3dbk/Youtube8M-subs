00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.430 
standing in front of a big window or
door<00:02:39.500> so<00:02:40.370> that<00:02:40.760> light<00:02:41.270> you<00:02:41.510> can<00:02:41.630> see<00:02:41.870> is<00:02:42.080> really

door so that light you can see is really

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.880 
door so that light you can see is really
shaping<00:02:42.770> and<00:02:43.220> slimming<00:02:43.990> the<00:02:44.990> bride<00:02:45.320> but<00:02:45.740> we

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
shaping and slimming the bride but we

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:47.590 
shaping and slimming the bride but we
see<00:02:46.100> the<00:02:46.220> location<00:02:46.340> but<00:02:46.880> it's<00:02:47.000> also<00:02:47.210> a<00:02:47.420> very

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
see the location but it's also a very

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.930 
see the location but it's also a very
flattering<00:02:48.440> shot<00:02:48.860> and<00:02:49.100> that's<00:02:49.310> always<00:02:49.520> a<00:02:49.610> big

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
flattering shot and that's always a big

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.010 
flattering shot and that's always a big
hit<00:02:50.920> next<00:02:51.920> are<00:02:52.280> the<00:02:52.340> details<00:02:53.090> many

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 
hit next are the details many

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.350 
hit next are the details many
photographers<00:02:54.550> think<00:02:55.550> of<00:02:55.730> taking<00:02:55.880> pictures

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
photographers think of taking pictures

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.600 
photographers think of taking pictures
of<00:02:56.480> the<00:02:56.570> details<00:02:56.930> of<00:02:57.110> the<00:02:57.200> day<00:02:57.380> by<00:02:58.040> themselves

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
of the details of the day by themselves

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.030 
of the details of the day by themselves
but<00:02:59.090> I<00:02:59.390> really<00:03:00.230> think<00:03:00.260> it<00:03:00.620> adds<00:03:00.770> something

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
but I really think it adds something

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.450 
but I really think it adds something
extra<00:03:01.820> special<00:03:01.970> to<00:03:02.600> the<00:03:02.930> picture<00:03:03.320> if<00:03:03.590> the

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:04.460 
extra special to the picture if the

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:08.650 
extra special to the picture if the
bride<00:03:04.730> is<00:03:05.200> with<00:03:06.200> these<00:03:06.680> details<00:03:07.190> um<00:03:07.660> she's

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
bride is with these details um she's

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.840 
bride is with these details um she's
holding<00:03:09.080> her<00:03:09.110> bouquet<00:03:09.410> or<00:03:09.860> we<00:03:10.070> see<00:03:10.310> her<00:03:10.490> shoes

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
holding her bouquet or we see her shoes

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:13.990 
holding her bouquet or we see her shoes
on<00:03:11.090> her<00:03:11.240> feet<00:03:11.300> or<00:03:11.720> we<00:03:12.410> see<00:03:12.680> her<00:03:13.460> hands<00:03:13.760> and

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
maybe we see her ring or her jewelry and

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.800
