a<00:00:00.089> study<00:00:00.630> conducted<00:00:00.750> by<00:00:01.260> the<00:00:01.410> Project<00:00:01.949> on

00:00:02.119 --> 00:00:02.129 
a study conducted by the Project on

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:04.249 
a study conducted by the Project on
Government<00:00:02.190> Oversight<00:00:02.939> found<00:00:03.629> that<00:00:03.899> the

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 
Government Oversight found that the

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:06.050 
Government Oversight found that the
government<00:00:04.680> actually<00:00:04.830> wastes<00:00:05.400> a<00:00:05.460> substantial

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
government actually wastes a substantial

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.330 
government actually wastes a substantial
amount<00:00:06.180> of<00:00:06.420> money<00:00:06.480> on<00:00:06.930> private<00:00:07.710> contractors

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
amount of money on private contractors

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.669 
amount of money on private contractors
the<00:00:08.730> fact<00:00:09.450> that<00:00:09.599> someone<00:00:09.990> had<00:00:10.139> to<00:00:10.260> do<00:00:10.380> a<00:00:10.410> study

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
the fact that someone had to do a study

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.100 
the fact that someone had to do a study
on<00:00:10.800> this<00:00:11.130> is<00:00:11.610> beyond<00:00:12.150> me<00:00:12.330> I<00:00:12.509> don't<00:00:12.690> surprise<00:00:12.870> me

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
on this is beyond me I don't surprise me

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.049 
on this is beyond me I don't surprise me
actually<00:00:13.500> this<00:00:13.920> is<00:00:14.099> a<00:00:14.130> surprise<00:00:14.340> to<00:00:14.730> you<00:00:14.759> okay

Heritage Foundation a rule released a

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.900 
Heritage Foundation a rule released a
report<00:00:19.080> obviously<00:00:19.830> very<00:00:20.100> biased<00:00:20.130> report<00:00:20.760> that

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
says that federal employees uh make too

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.029 
says that federal employees uh make too
much<00:00:24.180> money<00:00:24.240> and<00:00:24.869> if<00:00:25.019> we<00:00:25.170> just<00:00:25.350> replace<00:00:25.769> them

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
much money and if we just replace them

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.589 
much money and if we just replace them
with<00:00:26.130> private<00:00:26.519> contractors<00:00:27.150> then<00:00:27.359> the

would make only 111 uh 111111 thousand

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.770 
would make only 111 uh 111111 thousand
seven<00:01:10.799> hundred<00:01:10.830> per<00:01:11.220> year<00:01:11.460> that's<00:01:12.270> right<00:01:12.450> yeah

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
you got a national because I don't

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.249 
you got a national because I don't
really<00:01:14.640> need<00:01:14.880> to<00:01:14.970> be<00:01:15.090> specific<00:01:15.330> it's<00:01:15.930> all

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.410 
learning this more and more it's just
this<00:01:25.500> idea<00:01:25.710> but<00:01:26.520> they've<00:01:26.729> they've<00:01:27.090> pitched

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
this idea but they've they've pitched

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.130 
this idea but they've they've pitched
America<00:01:28.259> on<00:01:28.470> this<00:01:28.799> idea<00:01:29.220> that<00:01:29.759> government<00:01:30.720> is

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
America on this idea that government is

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.410 
America on this idea that government is
broken<00:01:31.740> and<00:01:31.920> doesn't<00:01:32.430> work<00:01:32.579> and<00:01:32.909> that<00:01:33.329> the

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
broken and doesn't work and that the

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.999 
broken and doesn't work and that the
federal<00:01:33.689> government<00:01:33.720> is<00:01:34.140> too<00:01:34.290> big<00:01:34.320> and<00:01:34.799> no

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
federal government is too big and no

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.069 
federal government is too big and no
matter<00:01:35.220> what<00:01:35.579> it<00:01:35.850> has<00:01:36.090> to<00:01:36.119> get<00:01:36.360> smaller<00:01:36.659> and<00:01:36.960> if

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
matter what it has to get smaller and if

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.469 
matter what it has to get smaller and if
it<00:01:37.200> gets<00:01:37.350> smaller<00:01:37.740> that's<00:01:38.460> good<00:01:38.700> for<00:01:38.880> you<00:01:39.030> that

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
it gets smaller that's good for you that

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.830 
it gets smaller that's good for you that
works<00:01:39.840> for<00:01:40.110> you<00:01:40.259> that<00:01:40.680> helps<00:01:41.009> you<00:01:41.400> it<00:01:42.299> doesn't

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
works for you that helps you it doesn't

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.219 
works for you that helps you it doesn't
it<00:01:43.470> doesn't<00:01:44.030> obviously<00:01:45.030> we<00:01:45.420> their<00:01:45.659> major

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
it doesn't obviously we their major

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.440 
it doesn't obviously we their major

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070 
I think if what I suspect the countering

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:02.410 
I think if what I suspect the countering
it<00:03:01.160> would<00:03:01.310> be<00:03:01.430> if<00:03:01.520> it<00:03:01.670> doesn't<00:03:01.970> include<00:03:02.060> like

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
it would be if it doesn't include like

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.000 
it would be if it doesn't include like

the government health care for these

the government health care for these
workers<00:03:04.220> which<00:03:05.090> obviously<00:03:05.420> is<00:03:05.720> incredibly

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
workers which obviously is incredibly

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.050 
workers which obviously is incredibly
expensive<00:03:06.500> right<00:03:06.980> well<00:03:07.250> you<00:03:07.490> do<00:03:07.640> save<00:03:07.880> that

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
expensive right well you do save that

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.360

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
the Heritage Foundation says that this

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:11.860 
the Heritage Foundation says that this
is<00:03:10.550> comparing<00:03:10.970> apples<00:03:11.090> and<00:03:11.330> oranges<00:03:11.480> because

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
is comparing apples and oranges because

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:13.990 
is comparing apples and oranges because
a<00:03:12.050> federal<00:03:12.410> employee<00:03:12.580> wouldn't<00:03:13.580> work<00:03:13.730> for<00:03:13.970> a

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
a federal employee wouldn't work for a

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.520 
a federal employee wouldn't work for a
short<00:03:14.030> period<00:03:14.300> of<00:03:14.630> time<00:03:14.690> they're<00:03:15.080> not<00:03:15.110> just<00:03:15.440> a

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
short period of time they're not just a

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.170 
short period of time they're not just a
contractor<00:03:16.100> they<00:03:16.220> work<00:03:16.460> for<00:03:16.640> an<00:03:16.760> extended

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
contractor they work for an extended

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:18.280 
contractor they work for an extended
period<00:03:17.210> of<00:03:17.480> time<00:03:17.540> and<00:03:17.840> they<00:03:17.930> also<00:03:18.050> get

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
period of time and they also get

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:19.990 
period of time and they also get
benefits<00:03:18.740> and<00:03:18.890> everything<00:03:18.950> like<00:03:19.250> that<00:03:19.310> but<00:03:19.910> it

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
benefits and everything like that but it

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.700 
benefits and everything like that but it
turns<00:03:20.240> out<00:03:20.390> these<00:03:20.660> private<00:03:21.020> contractors

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:21.710 
turns out these private contractors

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:24.040 
turns out these private contractors
actually<00:03:22.520> get<00:03:22.730> employed<00:03:23.120> for<00:03:23.540> years<00:03:23.870> on<00:03:24.020> end

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:24.050 
actually get employed for years on end

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:26.860 
actually get employed for years on end
so<00:03:24.890> and<00:03:25.340> they<00:03:25.550> get<00:03:25.730> paid<00:03:25.910> significantly<00:03:26.570> more

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
so and they get paid significantly more

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.230 
so and they get paid significantly more
