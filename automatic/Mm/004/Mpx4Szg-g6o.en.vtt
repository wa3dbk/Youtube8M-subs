00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:46.930 
I made it I made a dumb guys I made a

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:50.370 
I made it I made a dumb guys I made a
dumb<00:06:47.200> we<00:06:47.860> should<00:06:48.040> just<00:06:48.070> continue<00:06:48.430> going<00:06:49.380> where

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:50.380 
dumb we should just continue going where

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:52.350 
dumb we should just continue going where
the<00:06:51.070> the<00:06:51.430> way<00:06:51.550> we<00:06:51.730> were<00:06:51.820> already<00:06:52.000> going
