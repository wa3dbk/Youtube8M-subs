00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.520 
to ni LS there we go just tap that and
the<00:00:45.270> thing<00:00:45.450> I<00:00:45.539> love<00:00:45.719> about<00:00:45.750> this<00:00:46.050> is<00:00:46.260> it<00:00:46.379> looks

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
the thing I love about this is it looks

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.229 
the thing I love about this is it looks
pretty<00:00:46.800> much<00:00:46.860> identical<00:00:47.160> to<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:47.940> normal

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
pretty much identical to the normal

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.940 
pretty much identical to the normal
Android<00:00:48.570> lockscreen<00:00:49.110> which<00:00:49.350> I<00:00:49.469> really<00:00:49.739> like

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
Android lockscreen which I really like

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.010 
Android lockscreen which I really like
it's<00:00:50.160> nice<00:00:50.309> and<00:00:50.520> clean<00:00:50.730> but<00:00:51.390> essentially

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
it's nice and clean but essentially

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.700 
it's nice and clean but essentially
you're<00:00:52.140> just<00:00:52.170> gonna<00:00:52.379> have<00:00:52.590> your

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
you're just gonna have your

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.799 
you're just gonna have your
notifications<00:00:53.399> in<00:00:53.610> this<00:00:53.910> area<00:00:54.360> so<00:00:54.510> let's<00:00:54.690> go

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
notifications in this area so let's go

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.240 
notifications in this area so let's go
ahead<00:00:54.989> and<00:00:55.140> test<00:00:55.289> this<00:00:55.440> out<00:00:55.590> okay<00:00:56.039> so<00:00:56.100> I'm

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
ahead and test this out okay so I'm

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.770 
ahead and test this out okay so I'm
going<00:00:56.340> to<00:00:56.399> force<00:00:56.579> a<00:00:56.730> notification<00:00:57.030> by<00:00:57.360> taking

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
going to force a notification by taking

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.299 
going to force a notification by taking
a<00:00:57.870> screenshot<00:00:58.170> I<00:00:58.530> should<00:00:58.770> mention<00:00:58.949> however

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
you don't have to have every application

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.990 
you don't have to have every application

normal and large mode I'm not sure if
that<00:03:47.640> actually<00:03:47.880> changes<00:03:48.510> because<00:03:48.780> we're

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:48.960 
that actually changes because we're

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.170

into the floating panel settings this is

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:54.710 
into the floating panel settings this is
where<00:03:53.220> you<00:03:53.610> can<00:03:53.760> actually<00:03:53.880> do<00:03:54.120> quite<00:03:54.150> a<00:03:54.450> lot<00:03:54.630> of
