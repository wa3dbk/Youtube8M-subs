 dead by 16 centimeters chocolate 

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:11.409
 300 grams of cherries or more 4 tablespoons 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:14.290
 of jam cherries a quarter cup 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:16.930

 bitter chocolate 100 grams of cream and 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.670
 500 grams of chantilly cream 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:27.159
 Y 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.520
 t 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.900
 now we have the cake ready to leave 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.570
 cool super well if you want you can 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:57.430
 make it a preferable outside day what 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.830
 you let it cool well wraps it in 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:03.340
 film paper you put in the refrigerator 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:05.980
 and then the next day you cut them 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.260
 like the cake is so soft some 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:10.300
 people tend to crumble my 

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:13.150
 secret so that this does not happen is 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:15.670
 place it in the fridge to be a 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.090
 little bit harder here remember 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.090
 perfectly 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:29.920
 let's make a chocolate ganache 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:33.430
 simple as all the chocolate and 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:36.400
 half of cream if they are 200 grams 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.320
 chocolate is 100 grams of cream for 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.450
 that this for him and that nothing is left 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.490
 pretty but otherwise it's going to 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.260
 be a bit crazy and our idea 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:47.050
 because we want it to look good 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.780
 consistency adds the cream to your 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:51.670
 chocolate and put it in the microwave for 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.950
 a lapse of 10 seconds in each batch 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:57.530
 until you and in this fast 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:00.140
 now that we have made chocolate already 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:09.879
 is half screaming let's chop the 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:09.879
 let's remove the knife 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:12.610
 do not 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:19.140
 cut your cherries and reserve the 

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:21.799
 so much the kirs add a few 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:26.310
 cherries more to enhance the flavor 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:29.950
 then place the kirs in a little pot the 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:32.930
 As we need and reserve 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:35.420
 add marmalade and 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:39.069
 stirs very very well reserve for 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.069
 when we go to fill the cake 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:46.170
 I did this especially for my friend 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.060
 who is the editor of the blog in fact 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:50.310
 with peppers and how are we 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.680
 celebrating his birthday and thick cake 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.690
 preferred by today I had him shell 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:58.050
 black jungle cake but if I am you 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:01.260
 sincere the first cake was left 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:03.420
 so to speak it was too hot 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:06.180
 here in villahermosa and the cream does not 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:10.320
 raised no point at which the cream 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:13.350
 it was cut and made butter and water 

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:16.500
 for sweet butter 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:19.320
 obviously there was no way to beat the 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:22.140
 cream the heat did not leave everything here 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:25.320
 It would be a parapet and cake which 

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:27.600
 I really like it back so 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:32.810
 do 10 today this recipe that I am 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:32.810
 presenting as the cake for 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:42.099
 provoke my hair and do nothing 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:47.659
 but 

00:04:42.099 --> 00:04:49.549
 do not worry that you get the 

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:51.349
 pastry is nothing more than practice 

00:04:49.549 --> 00:04:54.279
 so that it fits you perfect you have to 

00:04:51.349 --> 00:04:56.719
 do it and to do it again and again 

00:04:54.279 --> 00:04:59.479
 remember rome did not get up in a 

00:04:56.719 --> 00:05:04.329
 day and god we close has to do the 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:04.329
 world so it will always add 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:11.210
 with an ole kirk brochette to our 

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:13.700
 cake add the pretty be well 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:16.970
 generous and you see me is super well the 

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:19.130
 cake with the course then add a little 

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:22.400
 of desire for chocolate this is going to be 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:25.150
 a base so that we can add 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:28.750
 then the cream 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:30.340
 pretty chocolate and now IDEVI of 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:33.220
 let's add it to the chantilly cream 

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:35.560
 that if you see is super super whipped super 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:38.740
 hard has a little bit of vanilla to 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:41.050
 give more flavor can add the cream 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:43.780
 I'm going to pair it a little bit 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:47.500
 do as a hole in the middle to 

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:50.140
 add my cherries I will make super 

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:52.720
 super generous and I'm going to put you pretty 

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:55.300
 cherries because remember that it is jungle 

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:57.220
 black is the cherry that is all about 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:59.980
 this then we are going to put it quite 

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:03.130
 let's put the other layer of cake 

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:05.320
 and we're going to wet it with the irs 

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:07.750
 we have to do well generous with the 

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:10.180
 liquor because you have to notice when 

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:13.300

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:15.640

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:17.440
 to add more chocolate ganache this 

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:19.210
 it's a little bit harder if you hit 

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:21.910
 account what I did to put it in the 

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:24.640
 Refri a little while and then you put it on 

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:30.060
