00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:02.990 
now we've covered playing using the e

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:06.680 
now we've covered playing using the e
789<00:00:04.220> 13<00:00:05.220> and<00:00:05.879> remember<00:00:06.240> that<00:00:06.359> we're<00:00:06.480> in<00:00:06.569> the

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
789 13 and remember that we're in the

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.009 
789 13 and remember that we're in the
mixolydian<00:00:06.990> mode<00:00:07.259> so<00:00:07.710> it's<00:00:07.830> 1<00:00:08.069> 2<00:00:08.309> 3<00:00:08.670> 4<00:00:09.030> 5<00:00:09.300> 6<00:00:09.660> flat

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
mixolydian mode so it's 1 2 3 4 5 6 flat

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.950 
mixolydian mode so it's 1 2 3 4 5 6 flat
7<00:00:10.050> well<00:00:11.040> all<00:00:11.250> of<00:00:11.280> these<00:00:11.519> chords<00:00:11.940> can<00:00:12.120> be<00:00:12.179> sus<00:00:12.660> 4

from low to high it's one three flat
seven<00:02:04.670> nine<00:02:04.850> five<00:02:05.330> then<00:02:05.600> you<00:02:05.630> have<00:02:05.810> points<00:02:06.110> of

seven nine five then you have points of
reference<00:02:06.350> so<00:02:06.770> that'll<00:02:07.520> be<00:02:07.580> an<00:02:07.670> e<00:02:07.820> 13<00:02:08.360> sus<00:02:09.080> for
