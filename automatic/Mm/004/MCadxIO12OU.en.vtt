00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:12.289 

so<00:00:09.210> I<00:00:09.240> never<00:00:09.590> recorded<00:00:10.590> a<00:00:10.710> video<00:00:10.860> of<00:00:11.309> the<00:00:12.059> build

00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:12.299 
so I never recorded a video of the build

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:16.070 
so I never recorded a video of the build
of<00:00:12.450> my<00:00:12.629> kettle<00:00:13.080> I<00:00:13.289> don't<00:00:13.830> know<00:00:13.920> why<00:00:14.070> so<00:00:14.580> I<00:00:15.080> took

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
of my kettle I don't know why so I took

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.159 
of my kettle I don't know why so I took
it<00:00:16.200> apart<00:00:16.500> and<00:00:17.720> decided<00:00:18.720> to<00:00:18.810> just<00:00:18.960> kind<00:00:19.080> of

00:00:19.159 --> 00:00:19.169 
it apart and decided to just kind of

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:20.540 
it apart and decided to just kind of
show<00:00:19.320> the<00:00:19.470> pieces<00:00:19.830> take<00:00:20.039> some<00:00:20.220> pictures<00:00:20.520> and

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
show the pieces take some pictures and

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.100 
show the pieces take some pictures and
thought<00:00:20.820> I<00:00:20.849> could<00:00:20.939> at<00:00:21.090> least<00:00:21.210> come<00:00:21.539> and<00:00:21.570> Tate

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:22.110 
thought I could at least come and Tate

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.060 
thought I could at least come and Tate

quart baby classic that had a you know
came<00:00:49.409> with<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.650> steam<00:00:50.059> boil<00:00:51.059> basket<00:00:51.900> in<00:00:52.049> it

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
came with the steam boil basket in it

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.539 
came with the steam boil basket in it
which<00:00:52.409> was<00:00:52.559> great<00:00:52.769> it<00:00:52.890> made<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.100> price<00:00:53.309> a<00:00:53.339> lot

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:53.549 
which was great it made the price a lot

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:54.049 
which was great it made the price a lot
better

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
better

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.229 
better
I<00:00:54.089> was<00:00:54.750> actually<00:00:55.049> the<00:00:55.430> 1144<00:00:56.430> models<00:00:56.909> the<00:00:57.089> one

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
I was actually the 1144 models the one

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.759 
I was actually the 1144 models the one
that<00:00:57.629> I<00:00:57.659> chose<00:00:57.960> and<00:00:58.019> it's<00:00:58.409> been<00:00:58.589> working

00:00:58.759 --> 00:00:58.769 
that I chose and it's been working

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:02.630 
that I chose and it's been working
really<00:00:58.890> good<00:00:59.360> it's<00:01:00.360> basically<00:01:01.049> it's<00:01:01.320> got<00:01:01.640> an

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
really good it's basically it's got an

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.219 
really good it's basically it's got an
extra<00:01:03.299> gallon<00:01:03.750> at<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.049> top<00:01:04.409> of<00:01:04.680> space<00:01:06.229> that

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
extra gallon at the top of space that

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.560 
extra gallon at the top of space that
helps<00:01:07.590> support<00:01:08.130> where<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:08.760> basket<00:01:09.210> actually

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
helps support where the basket actually

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.270 
helps support where the basket actually
is<00:01:09.720> it's<00:01:10.380> hard<00:01:10.500> to<00:01:10.590> really<00:01:10.710> explain<00:01:11.039> what<00:01:11.159> you

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
is it's hard to really explain what you

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.529 
is it's hard to really explain what you
see<00:01:11.429> a<00:01:11.460> picture<00:01:11.700> of<00:01:11.850> it<00:01:11.939> but<00:01:11.969> there's<00:01:12.240> a<00:01:12.329> place

00:01:12.529 --> 00:01:12.539 
see a picture of it but there's a place

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:14.300 
see a picture of it but there's a place
where<00:01:12.719> the<00:01:12.780> basket<00:01:13.170> sets<00:01:13.409> in<00:01:13.560> there<00:01:13.799> and<00:01:14.219> you

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
where the basket sets in there and you

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.800 
where the basket sets in there and you
still<00:01:14.490> have<00:01:14.609> like<00:01:14.759> a<00:01:14.820> gallon<00:01:15.299> headspace

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
still have like a gallon headspace

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.169 
still have like a gallon headspace
roughly<00:01:16.350> up<00:01:16.469> at<00:01:16.649> the<00:01:16.799> top<00:01:16.979> there<00:01:17.310> so<00:01:17.490> I<00:01:17.969> think

00:01:18.169 --> 00:01:18.179 
roughly up at the top there so I think

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:20.209 
roughly up at the top there so I think
it's<00:01:18.450> 11<00:01:18.689> gallons<00:01:19.259> is<00:01:19.350> what<00:01:19.500> that<00:01:19.649> actually<00:01:19.679> is

00:01:20.209 --> 00:01:20.219 
it's 11 gallons is what that actually is

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:22.669 
it's 11 gallons is what that actually is
but<00:01:21.060> like<00:01:21.539> 10<00:01:21.810> gallons<00:01:22.200> is<00:01:22.289> really<00:01:22.499> what's

00:01:22.669 --> 00:01:22.679 
but like 10 gallons is really what's

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:28.819 
but like 10 gallons is really what's
workable<00:01:23.130> in<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.670> kettle<00:01:25.159> so<00:01:26.159> I<00:01:26.789> have<00:01:27.390> I<00:01:28.229> put

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
workable in the kettle so I have I put

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.609 
workable in the kettle so I have I put
on<00:01:28.979> this<00:01:29.159> thing<00:01:29.369> a<00:01:29.520> three<00:01:30.090> piece<00:01:30.359> valve<00:01:31.259> on<00:01:31.469> it

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
on this thing a three piece valve on it

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.789 
on this thing a three piece valve on it
for<00:01:31.829> draining<00:01:32.810> again<00:01:33.810> all<00:01:33.990> stainless<00:01:34.499> steel

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
for draining again all stainless steel

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.779 
for draining again all stainless steel
and<00:01:35.869> I<00:01:36.869> also<00:01:37.319> put<00:01:37.679> like<00:01:37.859> a<00:01:37.890> hot<00:01:38.159> filter<00:01:38.579> that

00:01:38.779 --> 00:01:38.789 
and I also put like a hot filter that

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:40.760 
and I also put like a hot filter that
went<00:01:38.999> on<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.149> back<00:01:39.329> of<00:01:39.479> a<00:01:39.539> bulkhead<00:01:39.869> there<00:01:40.259> so

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
went on the back of a bulkhead there so

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.919 
went on the back of a bulkhead there so
went<00:01:41.189> from<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.030> ball<00:01:42.210> valve<00:01:42.390> three-piece

00:01:42.919 --> 00:01:42.929 
went from the ball valve three-piece

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:45.319 
went from the ball valve three-piece
ball<00:01:43.140> valve<00:01:43.409> went<00:01:43.799> to<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.009> bulkhead<00:01:44.310> and<00:01:44.670> then

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
ball valve went to the bulkhead and then

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.389 
ball valve went to the bulkhead and then
that<00:01:45.479> connected<00:01:45.929> over<00:01:46.109> to<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.409> hot<00:01:47.039> filter

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
that connected over to the hot filter

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.090 
that connected over to the hot filter
and<00:01:47.909> they<00:01:48.509> also<00:01:48.659> put<00:01:48.990> a<00:01:49.140> thermal<00:01:49.679> well<00:01:49.859> in

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
and they also put a thermal well in

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.429 
and they also put a thermal well in
there<00:01:50.310> for<00:01:50.549> my<00:01:50.639> thermometer<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.840> reason<00:01:52.350> I

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
there for my thermometer the reason I

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.020 
there for my thermometer the reason I
decided<00:01:52.799> to<00:01:52.920> do<00:01:53.130> that<00:01:53.159> was<00:01:53.639> I<00:01:53.759> thought<00:01:53.909> it

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
decided to do that was I thought it

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.550 
decided to do that was I thought it
might<00:01:54.179> be<00:01:54.299> better<00:01:54.479> protection<00:01:55.170> with<00:01:55.409> that

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
might be better protection with that

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.200 
might be better protection with that
basket<00:01:56.130> that's<00:01:56.340> going<00:01:56.490> to<00:01:56.549> be<00:01:56.639> setting<00:01:56.939> in<00:01:57.060> and

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
basket that's going to be setting in and

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.419 
basket that's going to be setting in and
out<00:01:57.299> on<00:01:57.450> top<00:01:57.719> of<00:01:57.869> it<00:01:58.020> so<00:01:58.679> I<00:01:58.740> wanted<00:01:58.920> to<00:01:59.069> be<00:01:59.189> sure

00:01:59.419 --> 00:01:59.429 
out on top of it so I wanted to be sure

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:02.870 
out on top of it so I wanted to be sure
that<00:01:59.460> I<00:01:59.729> had<00:02:00.469> you<00:02:01.469> know<00:02:01.590> some<00:02:02.130> protection<00:02:02.609> for

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
that I had you know some protection for

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.309 
that I had you know some protection for
the<00:02:02.969> thermometer<00:02:03.270> itself<00:02:03.840> I<00:02:03.899> didn't<00:02:04.109> really

00:02:04.309 --> 00:02:04.319 
the thermometer itself I didn't really

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:06.109 
the thermometer itself I didn't really
want<00:02:04.499> it<00:02:04.590> to<00:02:04.619> break<00:02:05.310> or<00:02:05.490> have<00:02:05.609> any<00:02:05.759> issues<00:02:06.090> with

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
want it to break or have any issues with

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.940 
want it to break or have any issues with
it<00:02:06.450> so<00:02:06.689> that's<00:02:06.869> why<00:02:07.200> I<00:02:07.229> put<00:02:07.409> a<00:02:07.469> thermal<00:02:07.829> well

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
it so that's why I put a thermal well

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.080 
it so that's why I put a thermal well
now<00:02:08.490> everything<00:02:09.090> had<00:02:09.360> to<00:02:09.390> be<00:02:09.660> very<00:02:10.080> very<00:02:10.530> low

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
now everything had to be very very low

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:12.620 
now everything had to be very very low
on<00:02:12.090> the<00:02:12.240> kettle

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
on the kettle

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.290 
on the kettle
so<00:02:13.380> because<00:02:14.220> the<00:02:14.340> basket<00:02:14.760> goes<00:02:14.910> down<00:02:15.120> pretty

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
so because the basket goes down pretty

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.640 
so because the basket goes down pretty
far<00:02:15.570> I<00:02:15.630> don't<00:02:15.780> have<00:02:15.900> the<00:02:15.990> measurement<00:02:16.530> right

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
far I don't have the measurement right

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.350 
far I don't have the measurement right
now<00:02:16.830> but<00:02:17.070> it's<00:02:17.340> you<00:02:17.880> don't<00:02:18.030> have<00:02:18.120> a<00:02:18.180> lot<00:02:18.330> of

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
now but it's you don't have a lot of

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.700 
now but it's you don't have a lot of
space<00:02:18.660> down<00:02:18.690> there<00:02:19.110> so<00:02:19.230> you<00:02:19.320> had<00:02:19.410> to<00:02:19.500> drill

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
space down there so you had to drill

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:20.570 
space down there so you had to drill
this<00:02:19.830> thing<00:02:20.040> as<00:02:20.160> low<00:02:20.340> as

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
this thing as low as

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.450 
this thing as low as
could<00:02:21.290> and<00:02:22.290> also<00:02:22.740> kind<00:02:23.040> of<00:02:23.130> thought<00:02:23.310> the

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
could and also kind of thought the

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.880 
could and also kind of thought the
thermowell<00:02:23.790> might<00:02:24.780> actually<00:02:25.020> help<00:02:25.350> shield

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
thermowell might actually help shield

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.560 
thermowell might actually help shield
the<00:02:26.040> thermometer<00:02:26.580> a<00:02:26.640> little<00:02:27.030> bit<00:02:27.180> from<00:02:27.450> the

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
the thermometer a little bit from the

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.140 
the thermometer a little bit from the
extra<00:02:27.870> heat<00:02:28.080> of<00:02:28.230> the<00:02:28.320> burner<00:02:28.530> down<00:02:28.770> there<00:02:29.150> you

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
extra heat of the burner down there you

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.310 
extra heat of the burner down there you
still<00:02:30.330> have<00:02:30.480> to<00:02:30.570> fill<00:02:30.750> it<00:02:30.870> with<00:02:30.990> thermal

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
still have to fill it with thermal

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.560 
still have to fill it with thermal
grease<00:02:31.560> in<00:02:32.370> order<00:02:32.670> to<00:02:32.790> make<00:02:32.910> it<00:02:33.060> work<00:02:33.240> a<00:02:33.360> little

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
grease in order to make it work a little

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.440 
grease in order to make it work a little
bit<00:02:33.690> better<00:02:34.520> having<00:02:35.520> any<00:02:35.700> trouble<00:02:36.060> with<00:02:36.090> it

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
bit better having any trouble with it

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.600 
bit better having any trouble with it
but<00:02:36.600> that's<00:02:36.780> just<00:02:36.900> another<00:02:37.460> another<00:02:38.460> thing

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
but that's just another another thing

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.140 
but that's just another another thing
that<00:02:39.120> I<00:02:39.150> was<00:02:39.330> doing<00:02:40.430> so<00:02:41.430> when<00:02:41.670> it<00:02:41.760> comes<00:02:42.000> to

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
that I was doing so when it comes to

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.300 
that I was doing so when it comes to
actually<00:02:42.600> you<00:02:42.900> know<00:02:42.930> drilling<00:02:43.620> the<00:02:43.740> holes<00:02:44.010> in

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
actually you know drilling the holes in

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.530 
actually you know drilling the holes in
there<00:02:45.680> you<00:02:46.680> basically<00:02:47.370> need<00:02:47.640> an<00:02:48.000> eighth<00:02:48.300> inch

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
there you basically need an eighth inch

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.700 
there you basically need an eighth inch
drill<00:02:48.870> bit<00:02:48.930> to<00:02:49.350> start<00:02:49.590> your<00:02:49.980> initial<00:02:50.490> hole<00:02:50.640> and

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:51.710 
drill bit to start your initial hole and

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:54.680 
drill bit to start your initial hole and
from<00:02:52.710> there<00:02:52.860> you<00:02:53.010> use<00:02:53.190> a<00:02:53.220> step<00:02:53.610> bit<00:02:53.880> and<00:02:54.240> I

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
from there you use a step bit and I

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.270 
from there you use a step bit and I
believe<00:02:55.020> these<00:02:55.230> all<00:02:55.470> I<00:02:55.500> needed<00:02:55.980> to<00:02:56.070> be

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
believe these all I needed to be

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.610 
believe these all I needed to be
thirteen<00:02:56.730> sixteenths<00:02:57.330> and<00:02:57.690> I<00:02:58.260> think<00:02:58.470> that's

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
thirteen sixteenths and I think that's

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.170 
thirteen sixteenths and I think that's
probably<00:02:58.770> pretty<00:02:59.070> standard<00:02:59.550> I<00:02:59.640> was<00:02:59.760> sure

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
probably pretty standard I was sure

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.660 
probably pretty standard I was sure
verify<00:03:00.660> that<00:03:00.900> but<00:03:01.200> when<00:03:02.070> you<00:03:02.160> actually<00:03:02.310> go<00:03:02.550> in

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
verify that but when you actually go in

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.330 
verify that but when you actually go in
you<00:03:02.820> and<00:03:03.090> you<00:03:03.150> drill<00:03:03.390> them<00:03:03.510> in<00:03:04.160> that's<00:03:05.160> where

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
you and you drill them in that's where

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.120 
you and you drill them in that's where
you<00:03:05.400> want<00:03:05.550> to<00:03:05.640> go<00:03:05.700> down<00:03:05.880> to<00:03:06.410> then<00:03:07.410> I<00:03:07.440> use<00:03:07.709> some

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
you want to go down to then I use some

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:09.920 
you want to go down to then I use some
middle<00:03:08.580> course<00:03:08.880> like<00:03:09.420> some<00:03:09.630> plumbing

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
middle course like some plumbing

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.480 
middle course like some plumbing
sandpaper<00:03:10.560> or<00:03:10.740> the<00:03:10.950> comment<00:03:11.340> you<00:03:11.459> know

sandpaper or the comment you know

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:12.860

plumbers<00:03:12.000> will<00:03:12.120> use<00:03:12.330> to<00:03:12.480> clean<00:03:12.660> up<00:03:12.720> to<00:03:12.780> the

plumbers will use to clean up to the

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.660 
plumbers will use to clean up to the
edge<00:03:12.959> of<00:03:13.020> a<00:03:13.110> pipe<00:03:13.350> it<00:03:13.860> helps<00:03:14.160> clean<00:03:14.370> off<00:03:14.520> the

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
edge of a pipe it helps clean off the

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.120 
edge of a pipe it helps clean off the
burrs<00:03:15.060> and<00:03:15.090> the<00:03:15.330> edges<00:03:15.600> inside<00:03:15.990> I<00:03:16.350> actually

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
burrs and the edges inside I actually

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:18.770 
burrs and the edges inside I actually
had<00:03:17.370> a<00:03:17.400> grinding<00:03:17.850> stone<00:03:18.060> that<00:03:18.360> I<00:03:18.420> used<00:03:18.570> on<00:03:18.690> the

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
had a grinding stone that I used on the

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.180 
had a grinding stone that I used on the
edge<00:03:18.900> of<00:03:18.990> my<00:03:19.050> drill<00:03:19.380> first<00:03:19.740> I<00:03:19.890> think<00:03:20.040> to<00:03:20.130> get

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
edge of my drill first I think to get

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.330 
edge of my drill first I think to get
the<00:03:20.310> rough<00:03:20.550> stuff<00:03:20.820> off<00:03:21.060> and<00:03:21.390> then<00:03:22.170> use<00:03:23.100> this

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
the rough stuff off and then use this

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.290 
the rough stuff off and then use this
the<00:03:24.620> sandpaper<00:03:25.620> as<00:03:25.890> well<00:03:26.070> it's<00:03:26.970> pretty

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
the sandpaper as well it's pretty

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:28.970 
the sandpaper as well it's pretty
important<00:03:27.870> to<00:03:27.930> make<00:03:28.350> sure<00:03:28.380> use<00:03:28.590> a<00:03:28.620> lot<00:03:28.950> of

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
important to make sure use a lot of

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.380 
important to make sure use a lot of
cutting<00:03:29.820> oil<00:03:30.060> you<00:03:30.510> don't<00:03:30.959> want<00:03:31.200> to<00:03:31.290> burn<00:03:32.390> you

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
cutting oil you don't want to burn you

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.960 
cutting oil you don't want to burn you
know<00:03:33.420> burn<00:03:33.720> out<00:03:33.900> your<00:03:34.350> drill<00:03:34.620> bit<00:03:34.830> or<00:03:34.970> deform

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
know burn out your drill bit or deform

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.150 
know burn out your drill bit or deform
your<00:03:36.030> stainless<00:03:36.600> steel<00:03:36.840> at<00:03:36.989> all<00:03:37.110> you<00:03:37.950> want<00:03:38.130> a

nice constant even pressure and don't go
too<00:03:41.250> fast<00:03:41.580> I<00:03:42.450> do<00:03:43.170> have<00:03:43.380> another<00:03:43.560> video<00:03:43.800> where<00:03:44.100> I

too fast I do have another video where I

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.509 
too fast I do have another video where I
had<00:03:44.370> added<00:03:44.700> to<00:03:44.820> this<00:03:44.970> kettle<00:03:45.360> later<00:03:45.570> on<00:03:45.810> a

had added to this kettle later on a
glass<00:03:47.519> sight<00:03:47.850> glass<00:03:48.120> so<00:03:48.390> I<00:03:48.420> do<00:03:48.540> show<00:03:48.840> some<00:03:49.140> of

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
glass sight glass so I do show some of

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:50.930 
glass sight glass so I do show some of
that<00:03:49.380> and<00:03:49.680> how<00:03:49.769> I<00:03:49.800> strap<00:03:50.220> this<00:03:50.400> thing<00:03:50.459> down<00:03:50.790> you

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
that and how I strap this thing down you

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.280 
that and how I strap this thing down you
know<00:03:51.030> certainly<00:03:51.330> got<00:03:51.480> a<00:03:51.510> strap<00:03:51.780> it<00:03:51.930> down<00:03:51.959> tight

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
know certainly got a strap it down tight

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.620 
know certainly got a strap it down tight
as<00:03:52.440> well<00:03:52.820> unfortunately<00:03:53.820> can't<00:03:54.209> go<00:03:54.390> into<00:03:54.540> that

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
as well unfortunately can't go into that

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:55.880 
as well unfortunately can't go into that
much<00:03:54.750> detail<00:03:54.810> because<00:03:55.350> I<00:03:55.440> didn't<00:03:55.709> show<00:03:55.860> you

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
much detail because I didn't show you

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:01.610 
much detail because I didn't show you
the<00:03:56.040> video<00:03:58.370> as<00:03:59.370> far<00:03:59.610> as<00:03:59.790> what<00:04:00.510> you<00:04:00.720> need<00:04:01.019> to<00:04:01.320> put

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
the video as far as what you need to put

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.770 
the video as far as what you need to put
teflon<00:04:01.830> tape<00:04:02.250> on<00:04:02.489> I<00:04:02.850> pretty<00:04:03.120> much<00:04:03.209> show<00:04:03.540> that

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
teflon tape on I pretty much show that

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
teflon tape on I pretty much show that
over<00:04:04.019> here<00:04:04.380> on<00:04:04.560> both<00:04:05.489> parts<00:04:05.850> of<00:04:05.910> the<00:04:06.030> bulkhead

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:06.800 
over here on both parts of the bulkhead

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.820 
over here on both parts of the bulkhead
and<00:04:07.800> the<00:04:07.890> end<00:04:08.190> of<00:04:08.640> the<00:04:08.970> off<00:04:09.900> though<00:04:10.530> the

three-piece valve and the thermal wall

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.599 
three-piece valve and the thermal wall
we<00:04:16.080> had<00:04:16.260> to<00:04:16.440> use<00:04:16.560> some<00:04:16.590> teflon<00:04:17.070> tape<00:04:17.280> for

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
we had to use some teflon tape for

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:19.640 
we had to use some teflon tape for
sealant

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
sealant

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:21.830

there's<00:04:20.579> a<00:04:20.669> you<00:04:21.000> know<00:04:21.060> picture<00:04:21.449> of<00:04:21.540> it<00:04:21.630> on<00:04:21.690> the

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
there's a you know picture of it on the

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.390 
there's a you know picture of it on the
inside<00:04:22.139> as<00:04:22.320> well<00:04:22.440> what<00:04:22.680> it<00:04:22.770> all<00:04:22.889> kind<00:04:23.220> of<00:04:23.250> look

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
inside as well what it all kind of look

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.350 
inside as well what it all kind of look
like<00:04:23.430> at<00:04:23.910> the<00:04:24.060> end<00:04:24.180> on<00:04:24.360> the<00:04:24.449> inside<00:04:24.810> and<00:04:26.360> here's

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
like at the end on the inside and here's

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.960 
like at the end on the inside and here's
what<00:04:27.600> we<00:04:27.750> looked<00:04:27.990> like<00:04:28.260> on<00:04:28.620> the<00:04:28.680> outside

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970 
what we looked like on the outside

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.300 
what we looked like on the outside
I<00:04:30.000> put<00:04:30.930> the<00:04:31.050> thermal<00:04:31.410> well<00:04:31.680> as<00:04:31.860> you<00:04:31.979> can<00:04:32.130> see

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
I put the thermal well as you can see

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:33.980 
I put the thermal well as you can see
from<00:04:32.580> the<00:04:32.729> hole<00:04:32.850> as<00:04:33.030> well<00:04:33.210> was<00:04:33.510> a<00:04:33.540> little<00:04:33.870> bit

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
from the hole as well was a little bit

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.080 
from the hole as well was a little bit
higher<00:04:34.260> but<00:04:34.860> I<00:04:34.889> wanted<00:04:35.160> the<00:04:35.370> drain<00:04:35.699> to<00:04:35.850> go<00:04:35.970> as

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
higher but I wanted the drain to go as

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:37.040 
higher but I wanted the drain to go as
low<00:04:36.240> as<00:04:36.389> I<00:04:36.510> could

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
low as I could

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.920 
low as I could
you'll<00:04:37.919> have<00:04:38.100> also<00:04:38.370> notice<00:04:38.850> that<00:04:39.030> you<00:04:39.780> know

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
you'll have also notice that you know

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:41.750 
you'll have also notice that you know
when<00:04:40.590> you're<00:04:40.710> looking<00:04:41.130> from<00:04:41.580> the<00:04:41.729> inside

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:41.760 
when you're looking from the inside

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.830 
when you're looking from the inside
you'd<00:04:42.690> be<00:04:42.780> careful<00:04:43.199> because<00:04:43.290> the<00:04:43.500> edge<00:04:43.620> of<00:04:43.800> the

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:44.840 
you'd be careful because the edge of the

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.500 
you'd be careful because the edge of the
don't<00:04:45.840> drill<00:04:46.050> too<00:04:46.229> far<00:04:46.470> down<00:04:46.740> because<00:04:47.190> the

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:47.510 
don't drill too far down because the

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:49.610 
don't drill too far down because the
you've<00:04:48.510> got<00:04:48.630> the<00:04:48.780> curvature<00:04:49.169> of<00:04:49.229> the<00:04:49.290> bottom

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
you've got the curvature of the bottom

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:50.960 
you've got the curvature of the bottom
of<00:04:49.710> the<00:04:49.770> kettle<00:04:50.010> and<00:04:50.220> on<00:04:50.400> the<00:04:50.490> inside<00:04:50.790> the

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:50.970 
of the kettle and on the inside the

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:51.980 
of the kettle and on the inside the
outside<00:04:51.000> it's<00:04:51.419> a<00:04:51.449> little<00:04:51.479> bit<00:04:51.780> you<00:04:51.900> know

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990 
outside it's a little bit you know

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:54.350 
outside it's a little bit you know
obviously<00:04:52.410> is<00:04:52.500> a<00:04:52.530> little<00:04:52.710> thicker<00:04:52.970> or<00:04:53.970> shorter

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
obviously is a little thicker or shorter

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.210 
obviously is a little thicker or shorter
on<00:04:54.479> the<00:04:54.510> inside<00:04:54.990> so<00:04:55.530> you<00:04:55.590> don't<00:04:55.650> want<00:04:55.979> to<00:04:56.039> drill

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 
on the inside so you don't want to drill

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:57.409 
on the inside so you don't want to drill
to<00:04:56.340> the<00:04:56.370> point<00:04:56.699> that<00:04:56.880> when<00:04:57.060> you<00:04:57.150> put<00:04:57.300> that

00:04:57.409 --> 00:04:57.419 
to the point that when you put that

00:04:57.419 --> 00:04:58.939 
to the point that when you put that
bulkhead<00:04:57.870> on<00:04:57.990> that<00:04:58.139> the<00:04:58.260> washer<00:04:58.590> is<00:04:58.650> not<00:04:58.680> going

00:04:58.939 --> 00:04:58.949 
bulkhead on that the washer is not going

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:00.379 
bulkhead on that the washer is not going
to<00:04:59.010> sit<00:04:59.160> flush<00:04:59.370> you'll<00:04:59.580> never<00:04:59.850> really<00:05:00.120> seal

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:00.389 
to sit flush you'll never really seal

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:02.600 
to sit flush you'll never really seal
right<00:05:00.630> so<00:05:01.139> be<00:05:01.289> careful<00:05:01.650> not<00:05:01.740> to<00:05:01.800> go<00:05:02.070> too<00:05:02.130> far

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:02.610 
right so be careful not to go too far

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:07.490 
right so be careful not to go too far
down<00:05:02.669> and<00:05:05.419> that's<00:05:06.419> pretty<00:05:06.780> much<00:05:06.930> it<00:05:07.199> it's<00:05:07.350> easy

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:07.500 
down and that's pretty much it it's easy

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:11.300 
down and that's pretty much it it's easy
to<00:05:07.680> clean<00:05:07.880> the<00:05:09.500> three-piece<00:05:10.500> valves<00:05:10.889> makes<00:05:11.160> it

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:11.310 
to clean the three-piece valves makes it

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:12.800 
to clean the three-piece valves makes it
great<00:05:11.550> to<00:05:11.669> pull<00:05:11.820> apart<00:05:12.150> the<00:05:12.240> thermal<00:05:12.660> wells

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:12.810 
great to pull apart the thermal wells

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:14.180 
great to pull apart the thermal wells
good<00:05:13.050> what<00:05:13.229> I<00:05:13.260> do<00:05:13.380> with<00:05:13.560> that<00:05:13.710> is<00:05:13.800> I<00:05:13.889> take<00:05:13.919> the

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:14.190 
good what I do with that is I take the

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:16.969 
good what I do with that is I take the
thermometer<00:05:14.699> out<00:05:14.910> when<00:05:15.900> I'm<00:05:16.050> cleaning<00:05:16.650> and<00:05:16.949> I

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:16.979 
thermometer out when I'm cleaning and I

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:19.159 
thermometer out when I'm cleaning and I
just<00:05:17.220> have<00:05:17.340> a<00:05:17.370> little<00:05:17.639> cap<00:05:18.479> that<00:05:18.750> goes<00:05:18.960> inside

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:19.169 
just have a little cap that goes inside

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:21.640 
just have a little cap that goes inside
of<00:05:19.380> the<00:05:19.830> thermal<00:05:20.220> well<00:05:20.340> to<00:05:20.610> keep<00:05:20.789> the<00:05:20.970> all<00:05:21.330> the

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:21.650 
of the thermal well to keep the all the

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:24.560 
of the thermal well to keep the all the
thermal<00:05:22.650> grease<00:05:22.860> from<00:05:23.250> getting<00:05:23.669> wet<00:05:23.910> so<00:05:24.450> when

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:24.570 
thermal grease from getting wet so when

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:26.210 
thermal grease from getting wet so when
I'm<00:05:24.660> washing<00:05:24.810> the<00:05:25.050> kettle<00:05:25.289> I<00:05:25.349> can<00:05:25.530> you<00:05:26.099> know<00:05:26.190> I

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:26.220 
I'm washing the kettle I can you know I

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:28.940 
I'm washing the kettle I can you know I
can<00:05:26.280> take<00:05:26.550> my<00:05:26.729> thermometer<00:05:27.300> out<00:05:27.800> itself<00:05:28.800> to

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:28.950 
can take my thermometer out itself to
