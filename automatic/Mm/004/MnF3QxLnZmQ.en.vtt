of<00:01:13.710> 1.9<00:01:14.159> and<00:01:14.280> this<00:01:14.549> is<00:01:14.670> really<00:01:14.850> cool<00:01:15.119> because

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
of 1.9 and this is really cool because

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.030 
of 1.9 and this is really cool because
this<00:01:15.420> means<00:01:15.659> we<00:01:15.780> can<00:01:15.930> examine<00:01:16.290> our<00:01:16.500> first<00:01:16.799> set

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
this means we can examine our first set

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.920 
this means we can examine our first set
of<00:01:17.070> minecraft<00:01:17.490> features<00:01:17.820> in<00:01:17.970> a<00:01:18.090> long<00:01:18.330> time<00:01:18.600> and

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
of minecraft features in a long time and

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.300 
of minecraft features in a long time and
of<00:01:19.140> course<00:01:19.350> that's<00:01:19.439> really<00:01:19.740> great<00:01:19.920> even<00:01:20.220> if

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
of course that's really great even if

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.800 
of course that's really great even if
you're<00:01:20.430> not<00:01:20.640> mad<00:01:20.820> that<00:01:20.970> much<00:01:21.090> for<00:01:21.270> PC<00:01:21.540> players

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
you're not mad that much for PC players

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.359 
you're not mad that much for PC players
still<00:01:22.110> could<00:01:22.320> see<00:01:22.619> what's<00:01:22.830> coming<00:01:23.189> you<00:01:23.280> know

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
still could see what's coming you know

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:24.830 
still could see what's coming you know
how<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.580> games<00:01:23.850> developing<00:01:24.390> and<00:01:24.540> where<00:01:24.750> we'll

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
how the games developing and where we'll

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.600 
how the games developing and where we'll
become<00:01:24.930> to<00:01:25.170> console<00:01:25.470> later<00:01:25.650> or<00:01:26.009> to<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.310> Pocket

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
become to console later or to the Pocket

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:27.920 
become to console later or to the Pocket
Edition<00:01:26.640> and<00:01:27.000> I<00:01:27.090> think<00:01:27.360> that's<00:01:27.479> really<00:01:27.659> cool

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
Edition and I think that's really cool

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.240 
Edition and I think that's really cool
so<00:01:28.140> there's<00:01:28.500> a<00:01:28.560> bunch<00:01:28.829> of<00:01:28.979> really<00:01:29.159> cool

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
so there's a bunch of really cool

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.249 
so there's a bunch of really cool
features<00:01:29.369> in<00:01:29.790> 1.9<00:01:30.299> that<00:01:30.630> I'm<00:01:30.689> looking<00:01:30.780> forward

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
features in 1.9 that I'm looking forward

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.649 
features in 1.9 that I'm looking forward
to<00:01:31.290> especially<00:01:32.009> when<00:01:32.520> it<00:01:32.610> comes<00:01:32.820> to<00:01:33.119> combat

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
to especially when it comes to combat

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:34.940 
to especially when it comes to combat
and<00:01:33.840> that's<00:01:34.020> why<00:01:34.229> this<00:01:34.290> next<00:01:34.770> way<00:01:34.890> is

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
and that's why this next way is

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.560 
and that's why this next way is
interesting<00:01:35.369> because<00:01:35.460> son<00:01:35.759> asked<00:01:36.090> if<00:01:36.210> all<00:01:36.450> of

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
interesting because son asked if all of

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.450 
interesting because son asked if all of
the<00:01:36.689> 1.9<00:01:37.049> pitch<00:01:37.350> we've<00:01:37.500> seen<00:01:37.710> so<00:01:37.950> far<00:01:37.979> be<00:01:38.369> in

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
the 1.9 pitch we've seen so far be in

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.160 
the 1.9 pitch we've seen so far be in
the<00:01:38.549> update<00:01:38.820> or<00:01:39.270> in<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.450> snapshot<00:01:39.659> and<00:01:39.960> he

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
the update or in the snapshot and he

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.620 
the update or in the snapshot and he
says<00:01:40.409> it<00:01:41.100> will<00:01:41.310> be<00:01:41.520> missing<00:01:42.119> some<00:01:42.390> things

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
says it will be missing some things

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.050 
says it will be missing some things
initiatives<00:01:43.110> such<00:01:43.350> as<00:01:43.380> shields<00:01:44.100> so<00:01:44.340> yeah<00:01:44.939> this

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
initiatives such as shields so yeah this

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.609 
initiatives such as shields so yeah this
is<00:01:45.119> kind<00:01:45.390> of<00:01:45.420> interesting<00:01:45.630> because<00:01:45.930> we<00:01:46.229> just

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
is kind of interesting because we just

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.080 
is kind of interesting because we just
assumed<00:01:47.009> everything<00:01:47.280> we've<00:01:47.460> seen<00:01:47.579> so<00:01:47.640> far<00:01:47.790> be

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
assumed everything we've seen so far be

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.310 
assumed everything we've seen so far be
in<00:01:48.149> there<00:01:48.299> but<00:01:48.570> there<00:01:48.659> will<00:01:48.720> be<00:01:48.780> a<00:01:48.899> few

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
in there but there will be a few

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.660 
in there but there will be a few
features<00:01:49.680> missing<00:01:50.040> however<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.399> fact<00:01:50.610> that

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
features missing however the fact that

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.100 
features missing however the fact that
shields<00:01:51.180> is<00:01:51.299> one<00:01:51.450> of<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.570> most<00:01:51.689> notable

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
shields is one of the most notable

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.630 
shields is one of the most notable
examples<00:01:52.710> means<00:01:53.070> they're<00:01:53.220> probably<00:01:53.250> not

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
examples means they're probably not

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.069 
examples means they're probably not
massive<00:01:53.970> features<00:01:54.299> will<00:01:54.450> probably<00:01:54.720> gain<00:01:54.899> all

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
massive features will probably gain all

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.240 
massive features will probably gain all
the<00:01:55.200> new<00:01:55.320> arrow<00:01:55.530> types<00:01:55.770> will<00:01:55.950> probably<00:01:56.189> be

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
the new arrow types will probably be

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.130 
the new arrow types will probably be
getting<00:01:56.399> a<00:01:56.729> decent<00:01:57.030> amount<00:01:57.509> of<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:57.780> new<00:01:57.960> end

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
getting a decent amount of the new end

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.780 
getting a decent amount of the new end
and<00:01:58.320> that's<00:01:58.680> always<00:01:58.950> a<00:01:59.189> good<00:01:59.340> stuff<00:01:59.610> that's

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
and that's always a good stuff that's

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.219 
and that's always a good stuff that's
all<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.000> exciting<00:02:00.509> things<00:02:00.540> and<00:02:01.020> I'm<00:02:01.079> really

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.899 
all the exciting things and I'm really

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
isn't looking forward to seeing how the

blocked and this is confusing to a lot
people<00:02:22.800> like<00:02:23.010> why<00:02:23.430> would<00:02:23.610> you<00:02:23.670> want<00:02:23.790> to<00:02:23.880> have

people like why would you want to have
items<00:02:24.300> in<00:02:24.480> there<00:02:24.630> so<00:02:24.840> you<00:02:25.050> know<00:02:25.170> if<00:02:25.260> you<00:02:25.380> want

don't<00:04:35.760> settle<00:04:36.060> down<00:04:36.300> in<00:04:36.570> the<00:04:36.720> end<00:04:36.900> that

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.080 
don't settle down in the end that

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:38.510 
don't settle down in the end that
doesn't<00:04:37.320> make<00:04:37.380> a<00:04:37.440> bunch<00:04:37.650> of<00:04:37.770> sense<00:04:37.950> the<00:04:38.190> new

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 
doesn't make a bunch of sense the new

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:39.680 
doesn't make a bunch of sense the new
end<00:04:38.669> is<00:04:38.760> really<00:04:38.850> exciting<00:04:39.240> for<00:04:39.270> a<00:04:39.389> bunch<00:04:39.540> of

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690 
end is really exciting for a bunch of

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:41.810 
end is really exciting for a bunch of
rays<00:04:39.960> but<00:04:40.680> unfortunately<00:04:41.250> it<00:04:41.370> can't<00:04:41.639> be<00:04:41.790> a

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:41.820 
rays but unfortunately it can't be a

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:44.300 
rays but unfortunately it can't be a
useful<00:04:42.270> XP<00:04:42.870> because<00:04:43.080> Dinnerbone<00:04:43.620> says<00:04:43.919> that

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
useful XP because Dinnerbone says that

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:46.700 
useful XP because Dinnerbone says that
it<00:04:44.370> will<00:04:44.460> only<00:04:44.639> drop<00:04:45.180> the<00:04:45.630> big<00:04:45.930> XP<00:04:46.320> amount<00:04:46.590> you

just farm the end dragon as cool as that

00:04:56.669 --> 00:04:58.730 
just farm the end dragon as cool as that
would<00:04:56.970> be<00:04:57.000> I<00:04:57.750> think<00:04:57.990> that'd<00:04:58.350> be<00:04:58.380> one<00:04:58.590> of<00:04:58.680> the

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:58.740 
would be I think that'd be one of the

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:00.710 
would be I think that'd be one of the
best<00:04:58.889> XP<00:04:59.220> farms<00:04:59.490> in<00:04:59.580> the<00:04:59.639> game<00:04:59.820> of<00:05:00.270> bushy<00:05:00.510> you

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 
best XP farms in the game of bushy you

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:01.940 
best XP farms in the game of bushy you
won't<00:05:00.900> be<00:05:00.960> able<00:05:01.050> to<00:05:01.139> do<00:05:01.260> that<00:05:01.440> and<00:05:01.590> I<00:05:01.650> think<00:05:01.860> the

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:01.950 
won't be able to do that and I think the

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:03.590 
won't be able to do that and I think the
balance<00:05:02.160> reasons<00:05:02.729> you<00:05:02.880> kind<00:05:03.060> of<00:05:03.120> have<00:05:03.300> to<00:05:03.450> do

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:03.600 
balance reasons you kind of have to do

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.180 
balance reasons you kind of have to do
that<00:05:03.780> maybe<00:05:04.050> maybe<00:05:04.530> it<00:05:04.650> could<00:05:04.770> get<00:05:04.860> smaller

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190 
that maybe maybe it could get smaller

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:06.469 
that maybe maybe it could get smaller
for<00:05:05.430> each<00:05:05.490> time<00:05:05.729> like<00:05:05.940> maybe<00:05:06.090> it<00:05:06.210> gives<00:05:06.360> you

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:06.479 
for each time like maybe it gives you

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:08.180 
for each time like maybe it gives you
like<00:05:06.630> I<00:05:06.780> know<00:05:06.990> five<00:05:07.380> levels<00:05:07.710> each<00:05:07.830> time<00:05:08.040> after

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:08.190 
like I know five levels each time after

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:10.370 
like I know five levels each time after
that<00:05:08.460> just<00:05:09.000> an<00:05:09.120> idea<00:05:09.510> but<00:05:09.720> yeah<00:05:09.840> unfortunately

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:10.380
