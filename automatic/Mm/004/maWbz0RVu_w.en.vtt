00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.540 
my new exhaust hanger from R&amp;G and on
the<00:00:22.949> other<00:00:23.100> side<00:00:23.369> there<00:00:24.050> you<00:00:25.050> can<00:00:25.230> see<00:00:25.560> there's

the other side there you can see there's

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.820 
the other side there you can see there's
like<00:00:26.640> a<00:00:26.699> blanking<00:00:27.060> plate<00:00:27.420> it<00:00:28.380> also<00:00:28.500> gets<00:00:28.769> rid

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
like a blanking plate it also gets rid

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.860 
like a blanking plate it also gets rid
of<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.189> pinion<00:00:29.760> peg<00:00:29.939> on<00:00:30.090> that<00:00:30.240> side<00:00:31.189> also<00:00:32.870> we

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
of the pinion peg on that side also we

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.709 
of the pinion peg on that side also we
have<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:35.300> new<00:00:36.300> RNG<00:00:37.079> tail<00:00:37.890> tidy<00:00:38.270> the<00:00:39.270> this<00:00:39.570> is

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
have the new RNG tail tidy the this is

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.830 
have the new RNG tail tidy the this is
the<00:00:39.870> cut<00:00:40.110> version<00:00:41.210> there's<00:00:42.210> also<00:00:42.300> an<00:00:42.510> uncut

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
the cut version there's also an uncut

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.510 
the cut version there's also an uncut
version<00:00:43.230> which<00:00:43.350> extends<00:00:43.829> down<00:00:44.100> a<00:00:44.160> little<00:00:44.340> bit

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
version which extends down a little bit

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.060 
version which extends down a little bit
which<00:00:44.789> essentially<00:00:45.600> has<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:45.750> frame<00:00:46.440> a<00:00:46.739> little

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
which essentially has the frame a little

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.029 
which essentially has the frame a little
subframe<00:00:47.789> inside<00:00:48.239> so<00:00:48.660> that<00:00:48.690> was<00:00:49.050> specially

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
subframe inside so that was specially

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.439 
subframe inside so that was specially
hacksaw<00:00:50.430> it<00:00:50.579> off<00:00:51.710> okay<00:00:52.710> so<00:00:52.770> that<00:00:53.250> that<00:00:53.610> is<00:00:54.329> the

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
hacksaw it off okay so that that is the

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.439 
hacksaw it off okay so that that is the
part<00:00:54.719> of<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.899> subframe<00:00:55.320> that<00:00:55.590> was<00:00:55.710> cut<00:00:55.980> off

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
part of the subframe that was cut off

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.729 
part of the subframe that was cut off
as<00:00:58.079> you<00:00:58.289> can<00:00:58.410> see<00:00:58.739> that<00:00:59.250> make<00:00:59.670> that<00:01:00.739> extend

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
as you can see that make that extend

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:01.970 
as you can see that make that extend
down

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
down

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.219 
down
yay<00:01:02.520> far<00:01:03.890> so<00:01:04.890> that<00:01:05.100> was<00:01:05.309> physically<00:01:06.229> hack

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
yay far so that was physically hack

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.080 
yay far so that was physically hack
sawed<00:01:07.500> off

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
sawed off

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.450 
sawed off
it<00:01:09.299> is<00:01:09.450> part<00:01:09.659> of<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:09.840> subframe<00:01:10.260> I<00:01:10.799> think<00:01:11.280> it<00:01:11.369> is

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
it is part of the subframe I think it is

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.120 
it is part of the subframe I think it is
read<00:01:11.670> at<00:01:11.909> reiterated<00:01:12.780> number<00:01:13.590> of<00:01:13.680> times<00:01:13.890> it

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
read at reiterated number of times it

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.530 
read at reiterated number of times it
isn't<00:01:14.250> important<00:01:14.939> to<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.119> structural

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
isn't important to the structural

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:23.200 
isn't important to the structural
integrity<00:01:17.060> and<00:01:18.060> this<00:01:18.740> comparison<00:01:20.390> is<00:01:21.390> the

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
integrity and this comparison is the

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:28.760 
integrity and this comparison is the
rear<00:01:24.210> foot<00:01:24.600> peg<00:01:25.700> pinion<00:01:26.700> foot<00:01:26.970> peak<00:01:27.409> so<00:01:28.409> it<00:01:28.590> get

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
rear foot peg pinion foot peak so it get

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.010 
rear foot peg pinion foot peak so it get
rid<00:01:28.950> it's<00:01:29.369> a<00:01:29.460> bit<00:01:29.579> of<00:01:29.670> little<00:01:29.909> weight<00:01:30.119> of

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
rid it's a bit of little weight of

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.640 
rid it's a bit of little weight of
course<00:01:31.259> it<00:01:32.150> me<00:01:33.150> black<00:01:33.540> kind<00:01:33.960> of<00:01:34.020> blends<00:01:34.320> in<00:01:34.560> a

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
course it me black kind of blends in a

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:35.929 
course it me black kind of blends in a
little<00:01:34.680> bit<00:01:34.950> more<00:01:35.189> I<00:01:35.220> don't<00:01:35.369> mind<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.759> silver

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
little bit more I don't mind the silver

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.370 
little bit more I don't mind the silver
actually<00:01:37.640> and<00:01:38.640> same<00:01:38.880> on<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.060> other<00:01:39.090> side<00:01:39.380> of

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
actually and same on the other side of

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.050 
actually and same on the other side of
course<00:01:40.590> is<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:41.009> other<00:01:41.040> corresponding<00:01:41.909> one

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
course is the other corresponding one

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.700 
course is the other corresponding one
which<00:01:42.509> also<00:01:42.630> incorporates<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.380> exhaust

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
which also incorporates the exhaust

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:50.889 
which also incorporates the exhaust
hanger<00:01:45.380> so<00:01:46.759> comparison<00:01:47.759> with<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.530> standard

rear<00:01:51.899> fender<00:01:52.290> this<00:01:53.009> is<00:01:53.189> the<00:01:53.369> fender

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
rear fender this is the fender

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.350 
rear fender this is the fender
eliminator<00:01:54.680> that's<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:55.890> difference<00:01:56.280> that<00:01:56.610> as

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
eliminator that's the difference that as

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.499 
eliminator that's the difference that as
you<00:01:57.960> can<00:01:58.110> see<00:01:58.320> there<00:01:58.590> is<00:01:58.950> quite<00:01:59.040> a<00:01:59.509> significant

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
you can see there is quite a significant

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:05.359 
you can see there is quite a significant
difference<00:02:01.549> between<00:02:02.549> the<00:02:02.880> length<00:02:04.130> even<00:02:05.130> the

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
difference between the length even the

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:10.999 
difference between the length even the
profiles<00:02:05.909> there<00:02:07.580> if<00:02:08.580> we<00:02:09.410> sort<00:02:10.410> of<00:02:10.470> substitute

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
profiles there if we sort of substitute

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.870 
profiles there if we sort of substitute
that<00:02:11.190> in<00:02:11.370> sort<00:02:11.640> of<00:02:11.730> thing

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
that in sort of thing

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.820

is this back section and the section
here<00:03:04.320> a<00:03:04.680> little<00:03:05.460> bit<00:03:05.640> to<00:03:05.760> be<00:03:05.880> desired<00:03:06.230> using

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
here a little bit to be desired using

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.900 
here a little bit to be desired using
the<00:03:07.380> stock<00:03:08.900> indicators<00:03:09.900> I<00:03:10.050> think<00:03:10.200> that<00:03:10.350> fine

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
the stock indicators I think that fine

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:16.550 
the stock indicators I think that fine
replaces<00:03:11.910> the<00:03:12.290> little<00:03:14.960> license<00:03:15.960> plate<00:03:16.230> light

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.010 
replaces the little license plate light
I<00:03:17.310> think<00:03:17.900> the<00:03:18.900> potential<00:03:19.230> issue<00:03:19.500> there<00:03:19.890> I<00:03:20.190> have

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:21.020 
I think the potential issue there I have

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:24.260 
I think the potential issue there I have
chose<00:03:22.020> not<00:03:22.320> to<00:03:22.380> put<00:03:22.650> like<00:03:22.800> a<00:03:22.830> full<00:03:23.459> frame<00:03:23.760> and

chose not to put like a full frame and

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:25.820 
chose not to put like a full frame and

little shroud around it or frame it kind

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.110 
little shroud around it or frame it kind
of<00:03:31.560> when<00:03:31.890> you<00:03:31.980> do<00:03:32.190> then<00:03:32.489> it<00:03:32.640> kind<00:03:32.820> of<00:03:32.850> blocks

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
of when you do then it kind of blocks

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.990 
of when you do then it kind of blocks

the light a little bit to illuminate the
license<00:03:36.360> plate<00:03:36.600> it<00:03:37.170> could<00:03:37.380> be<00:03:37.470> a<00:03:37.500> good<00:03:37.620> thing

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
license plate it could be a good thing

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.070 
license plate it could be a good thing
it<00:03:37.890> could<00:03:38.040> be<00:03:38.100> a<00:03:38.160> bad<00:03:38.280> thing<00:03:38.580> from<00:03:39.360> legal

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
it could be a bad thing from legal

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.420 
it could be a bad thing from legal
standpoint<00:03:40.350> that<00:03:40.709> could<00:03:40.950> be<00:03:41.100> a<00:03:41.130> bit<00:03:41.280> of<00:03:41.370> an

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
standpoint that could be a bit of an

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.500 
standpoint that could be a bit of an
issue<00:03:41.550> so<00:03:42.209> I<00:03:42.239> kind<00:03:43.050> of<00:03:43.880> opted<00:03:44.880> not<00:03:44.910> to<00:03:45.060> put<00:03:45.420> that

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
issue so I kind of opted not to put that

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:50.300 
issue so I kind of opted not to put that
on<00:03:46.400> I've<00:03:47.400> also<00:03:47.580> had<00:03:47.790> to<00:03:48.030> drill<00:03:48.890> my<00:03:49.890> license

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:14.070 
plate light for the back they provide a

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:16.280 
plate light for the back they provide a
plug<00:04:14.400> that<00:04:14.790> plugs<00:04:15.360> into<00:04:15.780> the<00:04:15.900> existing

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.290 
plug that plugs into the existing

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:20.300 
plug that plugs into the existing
harness<00:04:16.940> and<00:04:17.940> then<00:04:18.239> then<00:04:19.049> wires<00:04:19.380> into<00:04:19.709> here

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
harness and then then wires into here

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.760 
harness and then then wires into here
inside<00:04:20.700> a<00:04:20.760> little<00:04:20.970> like<00:04:21.870> little<00:04:22.049> banana<00:04:22.470> type

inside a little like little banana type
plugs<00:04:23.070> and<00:04:23.370> they're<00:04:24.270> color-coded<00:04:24.780> to<00:04:25.350> make<00:04:25.470> it

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
plugs and they're color-coded to make it

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.369 
plugs and they're color-coded to make it
nice<00:04:25.680> and<00:04:25.710> simple

00:04:27.369 --> 00:04:27.379 
nice and simple

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:30.679 
nice and simple
finish<00:04:28.379> the<00:04:28.560> install<00:04:29.210> turned<00:04:30.210> it<00:04:30.360> turned<00:04:30.599> it

00:04:30.679 --> 00:04:30.689 
finish the install turned it turned it

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:33.170 
finish the install turned it turned it
on<00:04:30.810> and<00:04:31.080> that<00:04:31.259> didn't<00:04:31.560> work<00:04:32.150> they<00:04:33.150> actually

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
on and that didn't work they actually

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.330 
on and that didn't work they actually
wired<00:04:33.810> this<00:04:34.020> up<00:04:34.259> wrong<00:04:34.530> so<00:04:34.889> either<00:04:35.039> on<00:04:35.250> the

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
wired this up wrong so either on the

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.399 
wired this up wrong so either on the
harness<00:04:35.520> side<00:04:35.849> or<00:04:36.060> that<00:04:36.150> side<00:04:36.210> whatever<00:04:36.689> but

00:04:37.399 --> 00:04:37.409 
harness side or that side whatever but

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:38.869 
harness side or that side whatever but
because<00:04:37.620> of<00:04:37.650> the<00:04:37.919> banana<00:04:38.159> plugs<00:04:38.460> is<00:04:38.610> actually

00:04:38.869 --> 00:04:38.879 
because of the banana plugs is actually

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:41.600 
because of the banana plugs is actually
quite<00:04:39.060> easy<00:04:39.300> to<00:04:39.599> swap<00:04:39.900> around<00:04:40.080> so<00:04:40.500> red<00:04:41.250> goes<00:04:41.460> to

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610 
quite easy to swap around so red goes to

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:44.480 
quite easy to swap around so red goes to
black<00:04:41.789> and<00:04:42.030> black<00:04:42.150> goes<00:04:42.330> to<00:04:42.360> red<00:04:42.919> and<00:04:43.919> that

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.490 
black and black goes to red and that

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.869 
black and black goes to red and that
that<00:04:45.419> actually<00:04:45.539> corrected<00:04:45.990> the<00:04:46.050> pro-player

00:04:46.869 --> 00:04:46.879 
that actually corrected the pro-player

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:51.290 
that actually corrected the pro-player
polarity<00:04:48.710> yeah<00:04:49.710> so<00:04:49.889> that's<00:04:50.069> that<00:04:50.669> was<00:04:50.819> a<00:04:50.849> you

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:51.300 
polarity yeah so that's that was a you

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:57.230 
polarity yeah so that's that was a you
know<00:04:51.330> it<00:04:51.509> was<00:04:51.629> a<00:04:51.689> bit<00:04:51.840> dodgy<00:04:55.939> one<00:04:56.939> thing<00:04:57.120> to

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 
know it was a bit dodgy one thing to

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.040 
know it was a bit dodgy one thing to
note<00:04:57.419> on<00:04:57.599> the<00:04:57.780> exhaust<00:04:58.050> hanger<00:04:58.469> side<00:04:58.789> is

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.050 
note on the exhaust hanger side is

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:02.420 
note on the exhaust hanger side is
because<00:05:01.050> the<00:05:01.409> exhaust<00:05:01.830> hanger<00:05:02.039> does<00:05:02.279> actually

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430 
because the exhaust hanger does actually

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:04.490 
because the exhaust hanger does actually
move<00:05:02.789> the<00:05:02.969> bracket<00:05:03.210> ever<00:05:03.569> so<00:05:03.779> slightly<00:05:04.139> on<00:05:04.439> the

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:04.500 
move the bracket ever so slightly on the

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.369 
move the bracket ever so slightly on the
exhaust<00:05:05.340> I've<00:05:05.729> had<00:05:05.939> to<00:05:06.090> really<00:05:06.810> cut<00:05:07.050> it<00:05:07.169> just<00:05:07.199> a

00:05:07.369 --> 00:05:07.379 
exhaust I've had to really cut it just a

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:09.769 
exhaust I've had to really cut it just a
little<00:05:07.650> bit<00:05:07.770> because<00:05:07.949> it<00:05:08.219> pulls<00:05:09.150> in<00:05:09.360> a<00:05:09.509> bit

00:05:09.769 --> 00:05:09.779 
little bit because it pulls in a bit

00:05:09.779 --> 00:05:13.159 
little bit because it pulls in a bit
plus<00:05:10.139> it<00:05:10.349> pushes<00:05:10.919> down<00:05:11.569> towards<00:05:12.569> the<00:05:12.810> motor

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:13.169 
plus it pushes down towards the motor

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:14.809 
plus it pushes down towards the motor
side<00:05:13.439> a<00:05:13.469> little<00:05:13.770> bit<00:05:13.860> as<00:05:13.979> well<00:05:14.159> so<00:05:14.490> it<00:05:14.580> moves

00:05:14.809 --> 00:05:14.819 
side a little bit as well so it moves

00:05:14.819 --> 00:05:17.709 
side a little bit as well so it moves
with<00:05:14.969> the<00:05:15.180> bracket<00:05:15.509> sits<00:05:15.659> on<00:05:15.870> the<00:05:15.990> exhaust<00:05:16.229> and

00:05:17.709 --> 00:05:17.719 
with the bracket sits on the exhaust and

00:05:17.719 --> 00:05:20.629 
with the bracket sits on the exhaust and
that<00:05:18.719> the<00:05:19.199> bracket<00:05:19.680> has<00:05:19.770> actually<00:05:20.129> rubbed<00:05:20.430> on

00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:20.639 
that the bracket has actually rubbed on

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:22.879 
that the bracket has actually rubbed on
the<00:05:20.729> exhaust<00:05:20.969> a<00:05:21.120> little<00:05:21.150> bit<00:05:21.509> and<00:05:21.779> got<00:05:22.710> like

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:22.889 
the exhaust a little bit and got like

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:27.700 
the exhaust a little bit and got like
little<00:05:23.039> wear<00:05:23.400> marks<00:05:23.849> so<00:05:24.650> go<00:05:25.650> into<00:05:25.770> the<00:05:26.400> the

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:27.710 
little wear marks so go into the the

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:30.649 
little wear marks so go into the the
exhaust<00:05:28.710> hanger<00:05:29.039> now<00:05:29.310> it's<00:05:29.969> kind<00:05:30.180> of<00:05:30.240> exposed

00:05:30.649 --> 00:05:30.659 
exhaust hanger now it's kind of exposed

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:32.629 
exhaust hanger now it's kind of exposed
those<00:05:30.900> wear<00:05:31.169> marks<00:05:31.500> a<00:05:31.560> little<00:05:31.620> bit<00:05:31.860> so<00:05:32.520> my

00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:32.639 
those wear marks a little bit so my

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:35.209 
those wear marks a little bit so my
recommendation<00:05:33.300> is<00:05:33.650> put<00:05:34.650> the<00:05:34.710> exhaust<00:05:34.979> hanger

00:05:35.209 --> 00:05:35.219 
recommendation is put the exhaust hanger

00:05:35.219 --> 00:05:38.230 
recommendation is put the exhaust hanger
on<00:05:35.310> at<00:05:36.210> the<00:05:36.389> same<00:05:36.539> time<00:05:36.599> swapping<00:05:37.440> over<00:05:37.800> the

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:38.240 
on at the same time swapping over the

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:41.119 
on at the same time swapping over the
two<00:05:39.240> an<00:05:39.360> aftermarket<00:05:39.779> exhaust<00:05:40.319> because<00:05:40.830> then

00:05:41.119 --> 00:05:41.129 
two an aftermarket exhaust because then

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:43.519 
two an aftermarket exhaust because then
you're<00:05:41.940> starting<00:05:42.180> afresh<00:05:42.539> and<00:05:42.930> there's<00:05:43.349> no

00:05:43.519 --> 00:05:43.529 
you're starting afresh and there's no

00:05:43.529 --> 00:05:46.430 
you're starting afresh and there's no
existing<00:05:44.430> wear<00:05:44.639> marks<00:05:44.969> on<00:05:45.089> there<00:05:45.289> so<00:05:46.289> that's

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:46.440 
existing wear marks on there so that's

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:49.659 
existing wear marks on there so that's
the<00:05:46.589> only<00:05:46.740> cave<00:05:46.949> it

00:05:49.659 --> 00:05:49.669 

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:53.450 

so<00:05:50.669> the<00:05:51.569> standard<00:05:52.319> pegs<00:05:52.560> helical<00:05:52.949> stand<00:05:53.219> pegs

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:53.460 
so the standard pegs helical stand pegs

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:56.570 
so the standard pegs helical stand pegs
on<00:05:53.580> the<00:05:53.669> CVR<00:05:53.940> 500<00:05:54.509> series<00:05:55.229> of<00:05:55.500> the<00:05:55.560> cb500f

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:56.580 
on the CVR 500 series of the cb500f

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:59.600 
on the CVR 500 series of the cb500f
they're<00:05:57.479> quite<00:05:57.750> chunky<00:05:58.189> because<00:05:59.189> they<00:05:59.400> cannot

00:05:59.600 --> 00:05:59.610 
they're quite chunky because they cannot

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:02.569 
they're quite chunky because they cannot
be<00:05:59.819> like<00:06:00.180> a<00:06:00.210> rubber
