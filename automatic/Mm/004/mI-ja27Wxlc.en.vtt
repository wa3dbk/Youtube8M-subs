00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.120
 Hello to you one gift cartoon 

00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:11.770
 talking about wipe z2 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:14.590
 And wipe x2 is in my right in my hand a phablet and 

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:16.500
 ordinary phone they differ very much 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:18.640
 strongly among themselves but not by 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.770
 characteristics at first glance because 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.470
 what essentially 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:26.350
 at a price difference of 3 thousand rubles per 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:28.390
 2 is more expensive it offers what 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:30.000
 many people want it so much in words 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.750
 Anyway metal case 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.270
 general design 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:36.909
 lenovo that's not bad enough 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:39.699
 fits the hand well, as anyone again in 

00:00:36.909 --> 00:00:42.839
 my hand is relatively big to me 

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:47.050
 like lenovo in his hand 

00:00:42.839 --> 00:00:48.159
 same size as nutria and if 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.139
 talk about 

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:51.549
 the diagonal of the screen is diagonal 

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:52.710
 five and a half inches five and a half 

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:55.870
 inches 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.440
 bright enough screen but not full hd it 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:01.719
 simply 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:08.830
 hd screen 1280 by 720 pixels 

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:12.670
 not so happy as if the screen was full 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:14.800
 hd what means three thousand more than x 2 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.080
 x 2 will cost 15 16 thousand and 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:20.320
 accordingly it will cost 18 19 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:23.350
 Thousands of selfies I make mistakes myself today 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:26.530
 all 8 megapixel camera unlike 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:29.260
 x2 where is she 5 megapixel sonic ovsky 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:31.110
 without th module 13 megapixels 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:34.990
 LED flash 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.790
 optical image stabilization especially 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:40.150
 it does not affect the quality of the pictures 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:45.760
 if you look inside and standard 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:48.850
 interface he has not changed in any way he 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:52.060
 gallery and I shot some leaves 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:55.150
 rain things like that 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:59.590
 turned frankly the average 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:01.930
 there is expected for sony kursk camera in 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.909
 chinese phone what's the screen 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:08.590
 bright enough this is one of the brightest 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:12.130
 and cranes maximum brightness 480 490 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:17.880
 no, that is, it is very, very bright 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:22.680
 inside there is an interface wai wai wai 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:25.510
 the interface described it quite well separately in 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:28.150
 review of video review including therefore 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:32.470
 please look at it unlike 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:35.890
 x2 where it costs 442 here immediately costs 4 4 4 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:40.300
 android version and not snapdragon media library 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:43.660
 410 with us dragon 410 is the solution 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:46.750
 mid-priced segment 2 gigabytes 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:50.850
 32 gigabytes of internal memory 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:53.140
 which are available to you about 25 a 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.990
 quad - core processor 1 and 2 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.460
 gigahertz on 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:03:00.190
 maximum frequency per core 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:02.620
 Well, in general, then this is probably possible 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:06.250
 it would stop and say everything to me 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.330
 liked the design again emphasize 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.690
 that simka 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:12.690
 sim card here there are memory cards and 32 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:16.950
 gigabytes of internal memory 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:19.840
 about me well here, I just do not always have 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:26.680
 took out a sim card 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:29.860
 so she scattered these two 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:32.370
 views under two cards we have here 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:34.960
 holders here card 1 card 2 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:38.230
 depending on which side 

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:41.200
 this unit will be supplied card 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:47.160
 either will 2 work or will not but 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:50.890
 there they just make me here again 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:55.170
 now see if he finds the network 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.170
 honestly i think will find quickly enough 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.599
 if we talk about performance 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:05.560
 solutions quite productive 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:10.780
 but the most important thing is the battery battery 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:13.569
 not replaceable and 2300 vx2 battery 2300 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:16.180
 milliamp hour it is very small and 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:17.859
 enough with eight-core sensitive 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:21.130
 for six hours qualcomm works of course 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:24.699
 better if we talk specifically about this 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:26.440
 the model here is worth a 3000 I battery 

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:28.750
 have not tested how much it will be 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:32.530
 play video separately tell you about 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:33.699
 but can I say this now? 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:37.000
 work time 

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:40.090
 This device is very very good. 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:43.599
 by the way, the difference from x2 is that here 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:48.430
 nfc is supported 

00:04:43.599 --> 00:04:52.360
 by the way how much the machine worked now 75 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:54.270
 percent power consumption ten minutes 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:58.419
 the screen worked and 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:05:02.620
 7:05 he standby that is 25 

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:05.289
 percent of the energy spent on it that is 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:07.300
 average light day this unit with 

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:08.940
 ease will withstand three 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:12.300
 quite large loads 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:15.880
 the device will be released in 3 solutions 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:18.099
 silver is such a metallic gold and 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:21.970
 in my brown it is necessary to clarify 

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:25.470
 Depending on the region for the assembly of any 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:28.150
 no complaints on the quality of performance and 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:31.479
 by speed too 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:34.570
 the screen is not bad at all that itâ€™s not full hd 

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:36.840
 hd screen price remains an open question 

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:39.940
 that is, it appears in October and 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:43.389
 begins to be sold in Russia but rather 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:48.010
 total it will be 18 thousand rubles in the area 

00:05:43.389 --> 00:05:49.229
 the range of 17-19 thousand is not yet clear 

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:52.090
 how much will it cost 

00:05:49.229 --> 00:05:54.610
 if we talk about their huge competitors 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:56.849
 quantity and every day they are all 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:06:00.699
 arrives and arrives 

00:05:56.849 --> 00:06:03.370
 nice here metal case 

00:06:00.699 --> 00:06:07.719
 average camera which is quite good with 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:09.880
 optical stabilization and running time 

00:06:07.719 --> 00:06:10.630
 due to qualcomm and quite good as well 

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:13.270
 produce 

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:15.010
 there is a mediatek in this regard is wrong 

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:17.230
 verified let's call it that 

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:19.630
 8 megapixel front camera it doesn't 

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:21.820
 so need it not so important to my 

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:24.940
 glance but nonetheless to someone she can 

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:27.190
 like the stuffing 

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:29.260
 by the way the interface works 

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:35.170
 I recommend to watch a separate video 

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:37.120
 about the viper there everything is told on it 

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:39.160
 perhaps all with you was Egor Murtazin 

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:41.860
 subscribe to the channel watch for 

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:43.000
 news figures especially since reviews 

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:46.120
 first glances 

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.160
 go out constantly non-stop them 

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:50.620
 quite a lot of this is an interesting model 

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:53.400
 good luck and good mood stay 

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:53.400
 with us bye
