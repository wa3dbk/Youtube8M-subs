00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.070
 of the patio workshop we are in the phase of 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:40.550
 land mobilization and I ended up in a 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.829
 month that respect the patio workshop 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:45.449
 about the wells right now we are in 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.210
 the well digging phase 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:49.860
 we started with two that is the 21 well 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.170
 and the 23rd floor that we are already saying 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.260
 dug about 10 to 13 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.670
 meters and they will finish digging 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.850
 towards the end of September 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.909
 the other four wells 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.110
 will begin to dig in the following 

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:06.930
 15 to 20 days 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.000
 and those make up the first 6 wells 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.280
 that will allow the operation of the 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.360
 first phase of phase 1 to the wells of 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.429
 ventilations play a role 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.600
 during the construction process and a 

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:20.070
 function during and to the operation let's say 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.479
 during the construction process the well 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.610
 of ventilation serves to that from there 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.470
 let's say from the 20 meters of 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.110
 deep we started to build the 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.360
 tunnel not then you enter the well of 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.890
 ventilation shaft and from there you start 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.350
 to build the tunnel that then goes to 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.869
 splice with a station in parallel 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.640
 you are digging the station up 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.460
 also reach 20 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.200
 of the 20 meters and then the tunnel that 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.690
 works underground without 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.850
 intervene the surface is going to splice 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.890
 with the station that way you have 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.840
 the final configuration that will be for your 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.340
 station post station this phase of 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.350
 project is going to work with a method 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.940
 of constructive traditional let's say that 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.100
 is with excavators with machines 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.420
 traditional and then let's say for a 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.420
 of the stations for a space more 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.310
 big low the tunnel boring machine and you're going to 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.560
 can start to build the tunnel towards 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.959
 the callao and then also to say 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.670
 gambeta that is the branch 4 the first 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.050
 phase will have five stations that 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.750
 let's say they are going to be inaugurated in the same 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:18.090
 at the same time it is not intended for 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.100
 let's say from this moment of two years 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.080
 longer last the first construction 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.970
 let's say and start- up the first 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.560
 phase the project starts with five of 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.510
 hit because we have to put in 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.540
 working a first stretch that is of 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:33.330
 5 kilometers the first five is not 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.769
 one in avoidance and the other near 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.660
 market here to the wholesale market of 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:39.180
 santa anita exact and then they will see 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.010
 between those two there are going to be three more 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.370
 complete all five throughout 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.890
 the line 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:47.560
 we all have 27 stations and 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:50.019
 we have 8 more that are from branch 4 in 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.970
 total are 35 stations remember that it is 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:54.280
 one station per kilometer all the 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.920
 project has 35 kilometers so 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.540
 we both have 35 stations and a well of 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.069
 ventilation between each station and 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.709
 station because I was just by 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:04.450
 tell you that the ventilation shafts 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:06.370
 besides being let's say the income for 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.989
 start building the tunnel when that 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.690
 is in operation and in operation 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:12.610
 they serve to obviously ventilate that is to say 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.019
 enter let air in and out and 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:17.069
 also as emergency exit in 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:17.069
 contingency case
