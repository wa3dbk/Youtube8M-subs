00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.450
 Syria uprising last 

00:00:02.409 --> 00:00:07.450
 The Arab Spring Revolution began at 

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:09.040
 March 2011 and by August when 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:11.350
 another Arab country of Libya 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:14.280
 Colonel Gaddafi is already essentially this country 

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:17.440
 lost it became clear who will be next 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.120
 this morning hut obama called bashar 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.800
 Assad to leave his post 

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.930
 the rest seemed to be waiting 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.240
 signal prizes in the usa to the president of syria 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:27.160
 bashar assad to leave post one after 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:30.690
 another begins to repeat the European and 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:33.039
 Arab heads of state siege time to leave 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:35.260
 Assad must understand that the time has come 

00:00:33.039 --> 00:00:36.269
 change it is time to leave the presidential 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.979
 armchair 

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:41.289
 it's time to end the board 

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:45.010
 bashar al-assad we ask the government 

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:47.530
 Assad leave Bashar Assad should leave those who 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.879
 in Syria were against Assad inspired 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.579
 support of world leaders and 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:54.309
 step up efforts and the train started off a 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:59.769
 A journey ahead of two years and 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:01:02.350
 thousands of human victims destabilization 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:04.629
 a series of very early work of the usa and nato 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.430
 they pulled all their allies into the process 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:10.560
 the overthrow of the Syrian government and 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.560
 plunged the country into total chaos and 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.270
 maybe America really got involved 

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:18.460
 all but she seemed to distance herself 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.320
 from what is happening two years after 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.210
 beginning of the conflict of the us president 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.189
 criticized both in his country and for her 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.930
 outside blamed for failure 

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:27.789
 solve the Syrian problem we 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:29.979
 provide vital 

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:31.630
 humanitarian aid but humanitarian 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:33.939
 help does not stop violence 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.710
 insurgents who like military siege 

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:37.780
 suffer heavy losses begin 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.359
 complain about america 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.579
 you have betrayed him we have not achieved 

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:45.670
 from us real part is that 

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:47.950
 going on in force increasingly opinions sound 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.170
 the fact that the United States is already possible and not that 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.880
 against Assad in the face of growing 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:55.619
 extremist threat the president of syria 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:58.270
 maybe just the lesser of two evils 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.249
 although the action of the obama administration may 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.409
 look ambiguous actually 

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:07.420
 washington is trying to find a way out of this 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:07.780
 conflict but in fact america is still in 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.360
 the game 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.840
 February white house decision 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.030
 rebels only humanitarian money 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.670
 help is possible and blocked weapons 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.650
 the rebels though the weapons were espen 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.690
 even her wet american midi 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.550
 but washington took no action for 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.800
 order to forbid others to arm 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.629
 rebels when ally usa for nato 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.879
 Turkey raised the issue of withdrawal 

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:29.390
 arms embargo america did not speak 

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:31.580
 vs 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.530
 Washington was silent and then when the league 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.390
 Arab states gave the green light on 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.099
 the supply of weapons to the Syrian opposition and 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.140
 when recently uk stated that 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:41.030
 can use his veto 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.920
 to vote on extending the embargo 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.290
 European Union for the supply of arms to Syria 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.870
 from across the ocean again did not utter a word 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.849
 in the bathroom 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:52.670
 we all know that if the United States had ordered 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:54.799
 saudi arabian qatar turkey or else 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:03:00.440
 someone do this to their opinion 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:03:01.670
 would listen but instead this usa 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.980
 prefer to retreat to safe 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:05.900
 distance and from there watch for 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.579
 a tragedy that began in many ways 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.319
 precisely with the blessings of washington 

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:12.349
 Americans can not solve this problem 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:13.849
 the Syrians themselves must do it 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:16.790
 rather strange after two years 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:17.510
 conflict 70 thousand dead million 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.220
 refugees 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:22.010
 tough economic sanctions against 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.870
 Syria condemn the al-Assad and calls for it 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:27.109
 leave of their own free will 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:29.269
 a dozen countries including nato members from 

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:31.609
 Arab League after cash 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:33.680
 infusion and arms supply positions 

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:35.690
 strange after all this to hear the words 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.120
 US ambassador to Syria who says that 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.989
 conflict resolution lies entirely in the hands 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.239
 Syrians themselves 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:42.980
 perhaps really in the course of events in 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:43.849
 this Middle Eastern country and there was a moment 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.639
 when the Syrians 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:48.019
 could themselves find a way out of the situation 

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:50.269
 however then the chance was missed due 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:53.239
 powerful pressure of external forces and now 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:56.889
 it may be too late mareev and 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:56.889
