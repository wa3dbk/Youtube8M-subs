00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
of the site oh now I've broken it down

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.130

between the t90 and the type 99 because

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.320 
between the t90 and the type 99 because
this<00:01:04.290> only<00:01:04.470> happens<00:01:04.830> on<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.040> t90<00:01:05.580> back<00:01:06.180> to

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
this only happens on the t90 back to

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.090 
this only happens on the t90 back to
back<00:01:06.510> here<00:01:06.840> and<00:01:07.290> let's<00:01:07.500> take<00:01:07.650> a<00:01:07.680> look<00:01:07.890> at<00:01:07.979> what

huge rap of the t90 because it doesn't

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:32.699 
huge rap of the t90 because it doesn't

shoot straight it shoots below the

shoot straight it shoots below the

actual target and I'm switching between

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
the 50 Cal and the sub 0 chelle here you

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.050 
the 50 Cal and the sub 0 chelle here you
can<00:02:38.079> see<00:02:38.260> that<00:02:38.500> this<00:02:38.769> is<00:02:39.060> specifically

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
can see that this is specifically

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.650 
can see that this is specifically
isolated<00:02:40.870> to<00:02:41.230> the<00:02:41.260> t90<00:02:42.130> and<00:02:42.340> is<00:02:43.209> something

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
isolated to the t90 and is something

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.300 
isolated to the t90 and is something
that<00:02:43.930> definitely<00:02:44.260> needs<00:02:44.530> to<00:02:44.860> be<00:02:44.980> taking<00:02:45.250> a

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
that definitely needs to be taking a

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.670 
that definitely needs to be taking a
look<00:02:45.340> at<00:02:45.610> it's<00:02:45.820> probably<00:02:46.350> something<00:02:47.350> that

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
look at it's probably something that

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.130 
look at it's probably something that
does<00:02:47.860> can<00:02:48.100> fix<00:02:48.340> pretty<00:02:48.940> easily<00:02:49.239> I<00:02:49.540> know<00:02:49.720> in<00:02:50.110> the

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
does can fix pretty easily I know in the

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.610 
does can fix pretty easily I know in the
beta<00:02:50.820> this<00:02:51.820> was<00:02:52.000> a<00:02:52.030> problem<00:02:52.510> at<00:02:52.930> all<00:02:52.989> of<00:02:53.500> the

beta this was a problem at all of the

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.800 
beta this was a problem at all of the

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.729 
tanks where they all didn't shoot quite
straight<00:02:56.519> but<00:02:57.519> in<00:02:57.790> the<00:02:58.780> real<00:02:58.989> game<00:02:59.230> now<00:02:59.530> that

straight but in the real game now that

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:02.880 
straight but in the real game now that
the<00:03:00.100> tanks<00:03:00.489> do<00:03:00.730> shoot<00:03:01.030> straight<00:03:01.390> and<00:03:01.600> that

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
the tanks do shoot straight and that

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.610

disadvantage<00:03:12.010> due<00:03:12.640> to<00:03:13.270> the<00:03:13.390> fact<00:03:13.569> that<00:03:13.720> you're

disadvantage due to the fact that you're

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.949 
disadvantage due to the fact that you're
you<00:03:14.890> jump<00:03:15.190> in<00:03:15.310> the<00:03:15.430> tank<00:03:15.700> and<00:03:15.940> you<00:03:16.240> expect<00:03:16.810> it

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
you jump in the tank and you expect it

you jump in the tank and you expect it
to<00:03:16.990> shoot<00:03:17.319> at<00:03:17.500> the<00:03:17.650> level<00:03:17.980> you're<00:03:18.130> used<00:03:18.430> to<00:03:18.670> and

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
to shoot at the level you're used to and

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.570 
to shoot at the level you're used to and
it<00:03:19.690> doesn't<00:03:20.080> and<00:03:20.530> therefore<00:03:21.130> you<00:03:21.220> find<00:03:21.400> me

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:21.580 
it doesn't and therefore you find me

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.370 
it doesn't and therefore you find me
