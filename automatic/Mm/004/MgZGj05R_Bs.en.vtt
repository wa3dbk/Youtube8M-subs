00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:12.750
 holiday with the car train train 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.629
 This is vacation from the beginning no traffic jam 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.920
 on the way to munich 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:19.110
 environmentally friendly and simply practical 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.869
 it is comfortable to wear them at all if they are so 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:23.100
 to put a car on the car and 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.490
 strict to 1 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:29.929
 rail traffic and car together great 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:33.050
 but the train has its concept autozug 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:35.640
 evolved to auto and too 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:38.550
 Now the cars are still going 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.790
 but transported and that is new 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.700
 the street the difference between the 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.789
 new concept car and train and im 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:50.640
 classic car train concept is that 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:53.399
 Car and passengers in this new 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.160
 pilot project are traveling separately 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.600
 Now only the passengers in the drive 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.300
 train and the most beautiful 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.850
 the train with them and the truck with the 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.220
 cars meet after their separate 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.590
 drive also in separate places 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.200
 just had to pick up the 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.119
 passengers again a little extra 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.140
 away from the main station to the east station 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.149
 return 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.310
 and also in the car delivery in 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:21.000
 berlin-wannsee does not accept the train 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.890
 passengers with but then I have to 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.950
 again a city â€‹â€‹tann to the main station 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.390
 with the subway so though down through 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.090
 and then I come back over 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.849
 or I take the night train exactly 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.280
 only at night train passengers and 

00:01:32.849 --> 00:01:37.739
 Cars from the same place and come 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.899
 Both in Munich at the same place 

00:01:37.739 --> 00:01:41.300
 but not at the same time 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:44.630
 Time 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:47.120
 loading then has the consequence that the 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.430
 passenger when he coincides with the 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:52.610
 At night, something starts at the destination 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:56.000
 is and then has to wait a bit until 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:58.190
 the car and transport then too 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.140
 arrived at the destination and this 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:02.240
 wait, the track can be great for 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.770
 use a survey 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.480
 we now gather only the experience 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.690
 of course with the customers we 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:10.850
 ask intensively whether this new 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:14.620
 Concept is also accepted by the customer 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.620
 the heritage goes on this blog 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:23.380
 I will do a great job once 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:28.460
 Concept of this car train without train 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:31.660
 what would be the alternative trailer 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.660
 step by step my car alone
