00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:07.610 

you<00:00:02.820> do<00:00:02.970> Pender's<00:00:03.389> here<00:00:04.640> my<00:00:06.440> circuit<00:00:07.440> bent

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
you do Pender's here my circuit bent

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:14.900 
you do Pender's here my circuit bent
keyboard<00:00:08.460> I<00:00:08.610> made<00:00:13.309> after<00:00:14.309> I<00:00:14.340> finished

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
keyboard I made after I finished

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.990 
keyboard I made after I finished
constructing<00:00:15.450> it<00:00:16.070> put<00:00:17.070> it<00:00:17.160> back<00:00:17.279> together<00:00:17.430> I

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
constructing it put it back together I

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.029 
constructing it put it back together I
got<00:00:18.630> a<00:00:18.660> bunch<00:00:19.109> more<00:00:19.230> bends<00:00:19.830> on<00:00:20.010> it<00:00:20.250> then<00:00:22.039> this

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
got a bunch more bends on it then this

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.880 
got a bunch more bends on it then this
short-circuited<00:00:23.880> in<00:00:24.210> a<00:00:24.750> bad<00:00:24.960> way<00:00:25.170> and<00:00:25.199> totally

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
short-circuited in a bad way and totally

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:35.060 
short-circuited in a bad way and totally
killed<00:00:26.160> itself<00:00:26.630> so<00:00:27.630> yeah<00:00:28.580> that<00:00:29.580> sucks<00:00:31.160> so<00:00:34.070> went

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
killed itself so yeah that sucks so went

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.970 
killed itself so yeah that sucks so went
to<00:00:35.130> Goodwill<00:00:35.579> and<00:00:36.290> picked<00:00:37.290> up<00:00:37.440> another<00:00:37.680> toy

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
to Goodwill and picked up another toy

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:44.750 
to Goodwill and picked up another toy
this<00:00:38.940> is<00:00:39.000> a<00:00:39.440> guitar<00:00:41.239> so<00:00:42.710> this<00:00:43.710> one<00:00:43.950> I<00:00:44.280> have

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
this is a guitar so this one I have

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:54.340 
this is a guitar so this one I have
successfully<00:00:45.500> finished<00:00:46.500> circuit<00:00:46.890> bending

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.410 

pretty<00:00:55.350> interesting<00:00:55.949> stuff<00:00:56.219> with<00:00:56.520> it<00:00:57.000> just

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
pretty interesting stuff with it just

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:27.110 
pretty interesting stuff with it just
from<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:57.840> get-go<00:00:58.250> yeah

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:27.120 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:32.250 

what<00:01:28.120> I<00:01:28.150> got<00:01:30.210> six<00:01:31.210> different<00:01:31.360> effects<00:01:31.810> buttons

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:32.260 
what I got six different effects buttons

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:36.030 
what I got six different effects buttons
I've<00:01:33.010> added<00:01:33.220> up<00:01:33.460> here<00:01:34.680> through<00:01:35.680> stearic<00:01:35.950> your

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:36.040 
I've added up here through stearic your

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.280 
I've added up here through stearic your
bending<00:01:36.280> so<00:01:36.490> so<00:01:37.120> let's<00:01:37.360> check<00:01:38.020> some<00:01:38.170> of<00:01:38.200> these

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:38.290 
bending so so let's check some of these

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:53.510 
bending so so let's check some of these
out

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:06:17.419 

someone<00:01:54.520> you<00:01:54.640> can<00:01:54.759> mix

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:17.429 

00:06:17.429 --> 00:06:21.799 

so<00:06:18.429> they're<00:06:18.639> got<00:06:18.849> got<00:06:19.569> it<00:06:19.749> a<00:06:20.580> circuit<00:06:21.580> bent

00:06:21.799 --> 00:06:21.809 
so they're got got it a circuit bent

00:06:21.809 --> 00:06:27.059 
so they're got got it a circuit bent
sound<00:06:22.809> mixer<00:06:23.409> guitar<00:06:23.949> mixer<00:06:25.889> solids<00:06:26.889> from<00:06:26.979> a

00:06:27.059 --> 00:06:27.069 
sound mixer guitar mixer solids from a

00:06:27.069 --> 00:06:30.389 
sound mixer guitar mixer solids from a
goodwill<00:06:27.399> probably<00:06:28.300> me<00:06:28.419> seen<00:06:29.319> if<00:06:29.439> I<00:06:29.559> can<00:06:29.740> do

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:30.399 
goodwill probably me seen if I can do

00:06:30.399 --> 00:06:32.969 
goodwill probably me seen if I can do
anything<00:06:30.999> with<00:06:31.509> the<00:06:32.349> circuit<00:06:32.709> board<00:06:32.830> that<00:06:32.949> I

00:06:32.969 --> 00:06:32.979 
anything with the circuit board that I

00:06:32.979 --> 00:06:35.100 
anything with the circuit board that I
had<00:06:33.189> from<00:06:33.339> this<00:06:33.520> keyboard<00:06:33.929> hopefully<00:06:34.929> I<00:06:34.959> can

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:35.110 
had from this keyboard hopefully I can

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:37.589 
had from this keyboard hopefully I can
salvage<00:06:36.009> it<00:06:36.369> somehow

00:06:37.589 --> 00:06:37.599 
salvage it somehow

00:06:37.599 --> 00:06:41.039 
salvage it somehow
there<00:06:38.169> you<00:06:38.259> go<00:06:38.589> circuit<00:06:38.949> bending
