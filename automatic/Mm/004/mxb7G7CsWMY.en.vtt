plate like in a circular pattern and

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.980 
plate like in a circular pattern and
then<00:00:27.689> I<00:00:27.990> took<00:00:28.429> this<00:00:29.429> is<00:00:29.670> one<00:00:30.029> container<00:00:30.660> of

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
then I took this is one container of

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.280 
then I took this is one container of
low-fat<00:00:31.830> cottage<00:00:32.460> cheese<00:00:32.730> it's<00:00:33.510> 2<00:00:33.840> percent

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
low-fat cottage cheese it's 2 percent

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.330 
low-fat cottage cheese it's 2 percent
milk<00:00:34.350> fat<00:00:34.590> and<00:00:35.250> it<00:00:36.059> is<00:00:36.329> two<00:00:36.840> points<00:00:37.469> on<00:00:37.620> Weight

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
milk fat and it is two points on Weight

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.720 
milk fat and it is two points on Weight
Watchers<00:00:38.370> and<00:00:39.680> for<00:00:40.680> those<00:00:40.800> calorie<00:00:41.250> counters

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
Watchers and for those calorie counters

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.350 
Watchers and for those calorie counters
it<00:00:42.030> is<00:00:42.149> 90<00:00:42.629> calories<00:00:42.809> for<00:00:43.260> that<00:00:43.410> container<00:00:44.360> so

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
it is 90 calories for that container so

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.930 
it is 90 calories for that container so
then<00:00:46.170> I<00:00:46.289> just<00:00:46.320> threw<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.190> whole<00:00:47.370> thing<00:00:47.579> on<00:00:47.700> top

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
then I just threw the whole thing on top

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.479 
then I just threw the whole thing on top
of<00:00:48.149> there<00:00:48.390> and<00:00:48.629> then<00:00:49.140> I<00:00:49.170> took<00:00:49.289> some<00:00:49.559> fiber<00:00:50.129> one

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
of there and then I took some fiber one

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.360 
of there and then I took some fiber one
cereal<00:00:50.960> now<00:00:51.960> I<00:00:51.989> measured<00:00:52.590> out<00:00:52.739> a<00:00:52.770> quarter<00:00:53.100> cup

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
cereal now I measured out a quarter cup

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.850 
cereal now I measured out a quarter cup
but<00:00:54.239> as<00:00:54.360> you<00:00:54.510> can<00:00:54.719> see<00:00:54.899> I<00:00:54.930> only<00:00:55.050> used<00:00:55.440> half<00:00:55.680> of

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
but as you can see I only used half of

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.020 
but as you can see I only used half of
that<00:00:55.969> so<00:00:56.969> it's<00:00:57.390> only<00:00:57.660> 60<00:00:58.170> calories<00:00:58.430> per<00:00:59.430> half<00:00:59.820> a

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
that so it's only 60 calories per half a

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.150 
that so it's only 60 calories per half a
cup<00:01:00.270> so<00:01:00.809> we're<00:01:00.930> only<00:01:00.989> using<00:01:01.199> a<00:01:01.500> quarter<00:01:01.949> cup

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
cup so we're only using a quarter cup

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.950 
cup so we're only using a quarter cup
which<00:01:02.489> is<00:01:02.520> 30<00:01:02.910> calories<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:05.510> so<00:01:06.510> this<00:01:06.659> is<00:01:06.810> only

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
which is 30 calories and so this is only

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.109 
which is 30 calories and so this is only
going<00:01:07.260> to<00:01:07.320> be<00:01:07.650> one<00:01:08.070> point<00:01:08.460> for<00:01:08.760> that<00:01:08.880> whole

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
going to be one point for that whole

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.500 
going to be one point for that whole
quarter<00:01:10.110> cup<00:01:10.350> now<00:01:11.250> you<00:01:11.310> can<00:01:11.790> eat<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.150> rest<00:01:12.180> of

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
quarter cup now you can eat the rest of

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.600 
quarter cup now you can eat the rest of
that<00:01:12.600> I<00:01:12.659> didn't<00:01:13.140> decide<00:01:13.439> to<00:01:13.680> put<00:01:13.860> it<00:01:13.979> on<00:01:14.159> here

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
that I didn't decide to put it on here

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.620 
that I didn't decide to put it on here
so<00:01:15.979> that<00:01:16.979> added<00:01:17.369> one<00:01:17.580> point<00:01:17.909> and<00:01:18.119> then<00:01:18.390> the

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
so that added one point and then the

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.880 
so that added one point and then the
last<00:01:18.840> thing<00:01:19.170> is<00:01:19.530> this<00:01:20.070> is<00:01:20.280> honey<00:01:20.580> just<00:01:21.420> 2
