near a little bit of rock or grass great
this<00:01:22.770> is<00:01:22.890> perfect<00:01:23.369> so<00:01:23.549> now<00:01:23.580> in<00:01:23.970> blocks<00:01:24.330> will

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
this is perfect so now in blocks will

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.469 
this is perfect so now in blocks will
click<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:24.990> loops<00:01:25.259> and<00:01:26.040> will<00:01:26.189> drag<00:01:26.430> in<00:01:26.640> repeat

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
click the loops and will drag in repeat

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.609 
click the loops and will drag in repeat
block<00:01:28.340> just<00:01:29.340> change<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:29.759> wild<00:01:30.299> to<00:01:30.479> until<00:01:31.320> and

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
block just change the wild to until and

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.530 
block just change the wild to until and
that<00:01:32.250> will<00:01:32.400> keep<00:01:32.549> things<00:01:32.759> looping<00:01:33.210> for<00:01:33.390> us

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
that will keep things looping for us

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.050 
that will keep things looping for us
which<00:01:33.720> is<00:01:33.750> what<00:01:33.990> we<00:01:34.110> want<00:01:34.290> for<00:01:34.470> forcefield<00:01:35.060> now

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
which is what we want for forcefield now

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.690 
which is what we want for forcefield now
go<00:01:36.299> to<00:01:36.360> setters<00:01:37.020> and<00:01:37.290> drag<00:01:37.710> in<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:37.920> set<00:01:38.280> blocks

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
go to setters and drag in the set blocks

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.480 
go to setters and drag in the set blocks
block<00:01:39.299> this<00:01:40.290> is<00:01:40.350> what<00:01:40.650> will<00:01:40.799> create<00:01:41.130> our

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
block this is what will create our

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.149 
block this is what will create our
forcefield

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:43.159 
forcefield

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:45.459 
forcefield
and<00:01:43.700> then<00:01:43.850> click<00:01:44.240> on<00:01:44.329> numbers<00:01:44.750> and<00:01:44.960> choose<00:01:45.289> an

00:01:45.459 --> 00:01:45.469 
and then click on numbers and choose an

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:49.090 
and then click on numbers and choose an
XYZ<00:01:46.100> and<00:01:46.460> attach<00:01:46.850> into<00:01:47.090> position<00:01:47.890> now<00:01:48.890> for

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
XYZ and attach into position now for

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.740 
XYZ and attach into position now for
this<00:01:49.280> we'll<00:01:49.520> want<00:01:49.729> to<00:01:49.789> set<00:01:50.119> it<00:01:50.270> slightly

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
this we'll want to set it slightly

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.649 
this we'll want to set it slightly
behind<00:01:51.320> us<00:01:51.619> and<00:01:51.860> slightly<00:01:52.789> to<00:01:52.939> the<00:01:52.970> side<00:01:53.060> of<00:01:53.539> us

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 
behind us and slightly to the side of us

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:56.889 
behind us and slightly to the side of us
so<00:01:54.170> we'll<00:01:54.259> change<00:01:54.590> X<00:01:54.920> to<00:01:55.280> minus<00:01:55.490> three<00:01:56.119> and

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:56.899 
so we'll change X to minus three and

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:58.620 
so we'll change X to minus three and
we'll<00:01:57.020> also<00:01:57.140> do<00:01:57.350> the<00:01:57.500> same<00:01:57.679> for<00:01:57.740> zette

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
we'll also do the same for zette

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.340 
we'll also do the same for zette
great<00:01:59.899> once<00:02:00.470> that's<00:02:00.590> in<00:02:00.860> go<00:02:01.220> back<00:02:01.520> to<00:02:01.759> numbers

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
great once that's in go back to numbers

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.569 
great once that's in go back to numbers
and<00:02:03.350> go<00:02:03.740> and<00:02:03.860> grab<00:02:04.130> another<00:02:04.659> XYZ<00:02:06.280> this<00:02:07.280> time

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:07.579 
and go and grab another XYZ this time

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:10.330 
and go and grab another XYZ this time
attach<00:02:08.060> it<00:02:08.209> to<00:02:08.330> size<00:02:08.630> now<00:02:09.530> size<00:02:09.920> will

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
attach it to size now size will

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.130 
attach it to size now size will
determine<00:02:10.640> how<00:02:11.030> big<00:02:11.239> the<00:02:11.390> force<00:02:11.660> field<00:02:11.959> is

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
determine how big the force field is

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:13.780 
determine how big the force field is
around<00:02:12.470> you<00:02:12.709> you<00:02:13.130> can<00:02:13.160> set<00:02:13.430> it<00:02:13.580> to<00:02:13.610> whatever

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
around you you can set it to whatever

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.030 
around you you can set it to whatever
you<00:02:14.150> want<00:02:14.390> but<00:02:14.930> I'm<00:02:15.050> going<00:02:15.230> to<00:02:15.260> set<00:02:15.440> it<00:02:15.530> to<00:02:15.560> six

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
you want but I'm going to set it to six

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:23.740 
you want but I'm going to set it to six
for<00:02:17.410> six<00:02:18.410> I<00:02:19.220> think<00:02:19.810> right<00:02:20.810> now<00:02:22.420> we<00:02:23.420> just<00:02:23.599> have

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
for six I think right now we just have

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.539 
for six I think right now we just have
to<00:02:23.900> create<00:02:24.140> the<00:02:24.290> air<00:02:24.410> so<00:02:24.799> click<00:02:25.010> click<00:02:25.430> on

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:25.549 
to create the air so click click on

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:29.979 
to create the air so click click on
getters<00:02:25.940> and<00:02:27.069> then<00:02:28.069> drag<00:02:28.700> in<00:02:29.060> block<00:02:29.420> type<00:02:29.660> and

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
getters and then drag in block type and

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:32.470 
getters and then drag in block type and
we<00:02:30.140> can<00:02:30.260> leave<00:02:30.410> it<00:02:30.560> as<00:02:30.650> air<00:02:31.180> and<00:02:32.180> we're<00:02:32.360> ready

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
we can leave it as air and we're ready

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.380 
we can leave it as air and we're ready
to<00:02:32.630> go<00:02:32.780> click<00:02:33.410> make<00:02:33.620> and<00:02:33.980> run<00:02:34.880> into<00:02:35.120> the<00:02:35.209> wall

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
to go click make and run into the wall

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.140 
to go click make and run into the wall
ah<00:02:35.709> look<00:02:36.709> at<00:02:36.829> that

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
ah look at that

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.600 
ah look at that
instantly<00:02:38.150> vanishing<00:02:38.750> rock<00:02:39.019> and<00:02:39.290> stone<00:02:39.680> you

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
instantly vanishing rock and stone you

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.370 
instantly vanishing rock and stone you
can<00:02:40.760> use<00:02:40.940> this<00:02:41.090> to<00:02:41.239> dig<00:02:41.390> tunnels<00:02:41.569> like<00:02:41.959> I<00:02:42.140> have

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
can use this to dig tunnels like I have

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.470 
can use this to dig tunnels like I have
or<00:02:42.650> on<00:02:43.220> the<00:02:43.519> top<00:02:43.670> of<00:02:43.819> the<00:02:43.880> ground<00:02:44.030> and<00:02:44.360> it<00:02:44.420> will

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
or on the top of the ground and it will

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.500 
or on the top of the ground and it will
dig<00:02:44.660> massive<00:02:45.110> valleys<00:02:46.150> and<00:02:47.150> just<00:02:47.359> keep

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
dig massive valleys and just keep

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.569 
dig massive valleys and just keep
running<00:02:47.750> eventually<00:02:48.560> it<00:02:48.620> will<00:02:48.739> say<00:02:48.980> infinite

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:49.579 
running eventually it will say infinite

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:50.979 
running eventually it will say infinite

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
have another go click it again and there

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.729 
have another go click it again and there
we<00:02:56.209> go

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
we go
