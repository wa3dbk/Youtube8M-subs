you<00:00:13.590> guys<00:00:14.009> have<00:00:14.160> heard<00:00:14.250> me<00:00:14.309> mention<00:00:14.400> this

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
you guys have heard me mention this

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.460 
you guys have heard me mention this
before<00:00:15.179> and<00:00:15.389> I<00:00:15.509> have<00:00:15.540> raved<00:00:15.900> about<00:00:16.020> it

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
before and I have raved about it

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
in previous videos but I thought it

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.090 
in previous videos but I thought it
deserved<00:00:18.359> a<00:00:18.810> little<00:00:19.050> review<00:00:19.350> if<00:00:19.590> not<00:00:19.740> is<00:00:19.859> the

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
deserved a little review if not is the

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.730 
deserved a little review if not is the

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
I'm not sure if this is like an entirely

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.750 
I'm not sure if this is like an entirely
new<00:00:25.500> product<00:00:26.039> or<00:00:26.189> if<00:00:26.279> it<00:00:26.369> was<00:00:26.460> just<00:00:26.670> me

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
new product or if it was just me

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.400

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
discovering it but I picked it up at the

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.709 
discovering it but I picked it up at the
drugstore<00:00:30.779> probably<00:00:31.529> like<00:00:32.300> probably<00:00:33.300> two

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
drugstore probably like probably two

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.310 
drugstore probably like probably two
maybe<00:00:34.649> three<00:00:35.040> weeks<00:00:35.070> ago<00:00:35.460> now<00:00:35.730> and<00:00:36.149> it's<00:00:36.989> just

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
maybe three weeks ago now and it's just

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.340 
maybe three weeks ago now and it's just
an<00:00:37.649> amazing<00:00:38.489> powder<00:00:39.210> I<00:00:39.329> use<00:00:39.570> it<00:00:39.780> to<00:00:39.960> set<00:00:40.230> my

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
an amazing powder I use it to set my

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.600 
an amazing powder I use it to set my
foundation<00:00:40.500> and<00:00:40.950> don't<00:00:41.129> use<00:00:41.280> it<00:00:41.370> alone

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
foundation and don't use it alone

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.700 
foundation and don't use it alone
although<00:00:42.149> I'm<00:00:42.629> sure<00:00:42.809> you<00:00:42.960> could<00:00:43.110> probably<00:00:43.320> get

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
although I'm sure you could probably get

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:44.959 
although I'm sure you could probably get
away<00:00:43.800> with<00:00:43.920> that<00:00:44.160> I<00:00:44.219> haven't<00:00:44.489> tried<00:00:44.700> to<00:00:44.789> get

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
away with that I haven't tried to get

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.630 
away with that I haven't tried to get
myself<00:00:45.360> I<00:00:45.570> have<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.530> color<00:00:46.920> light<00:00:47.250> ivory

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
myself I have the color light ivory

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.000 
myself I have the color light ivory
which<00:00:48.090> is<00:00:48.120> you<00:00:48.660> know<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:49.320> lightest<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.800> shade

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
which is you know the lightest to shade

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.549 
which is you know the lightest to shade
I<00:00:50.039> think<00:00:50.309> this<00:00:50.430> is<00:00:50.550> on<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.989> the<00:00:51.989> warmer<00:00:52.379> side

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
I think this is on the the warmer side

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.860 
I think this is on the the warmer side
so<00:00:52.949> you<00:00:53.789> have<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.059> powder<00:00:54.239> up<00:00:54.449> close<00:00:54.660> the

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
so you have the powder up close the

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.779 
so you have the powder up close the
packaging<00:00:55.350> is<00:00:55.500> just<00:00:55.739> really<00:00:55.949> cute<00:00:56.160> and<00:00:56.219> simple

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
packaging is just really cute and simple

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.610 
packaging is just really cute and simple
it's<00:00:57.210> just<00:00:57.239> got<00:00:57.449> a<00:00:57.480> nice<00:00:57.600> white<00:00:57.870> border<00:00:58.350> and

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
it's just got a nice white border and

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.860 
it's just got a nice white border and
then<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:59.190> back<00:00:59.670> is<00:00:59.699> clear<00:01:00.270> and<00:01:00.480> you<00:01:00.600> have<00:01:00.750> like

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
then the back is clear and you have like

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.810 
then the back is clear and you have like
a<00:01:00.899> little<00:01:01.140> sponge<00:01:01.559> it's<00:01:02.100> one<00:01:02.309> of<00:01:02.399> those<00:01:02.579> where

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
a little sponge it's one of those where

a little sponge it's one of those where
you<00:01:02.850> open<00:01:03.270> it<00:01:03.390> and<00:01:03.600> then<00:01:03.780> if<00:01:03.870> you<00:01:03.960> open<00:01:04.199> it<00:01:04.290> far

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
you open it and then if you open it far

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.730 
you open it and then if you open it far
enough<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.880> bottom<00:01:06.869> opens<00:01:07.350> and<00:01:07.619> then

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
enough the the bottom opens and then

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.500

powder brush with this powder but the
sponge<00:01:15.420> comes<00:01:15.689> in<00:01:15.810> handy<00:01:15.930> if<00:01:16.140> you're<00:01:16.259> taking

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
say other than the fact this is an

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:17.960 
say other than the fact this is an
amazing<00:02:16.920> setting<00:02:17.190> powder<00:02:17.430> for<00:02:17.760> your

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
foundation and I mean it's from the

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.890 
foundation and I mean it's from the
drugstore<00:02:20.580> so<00:02:20.610> I<00:02:20.819> mean<00:02:21.060> L'Oreal<00:02:21.420> can<00:02:21.599> be<00:02:21.720> kind

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
drugstore so I mean L'Oreal can be kind

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.750 
drugstore so I mean L'Oreal can be kind
of<00:02:21.930> pricey<00:02:22.080> but<00:02:22.500> I<00:02:22.769> definitely<00:02:23.310> think<00:02:23.550> it's

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
of pricey but I definitely think it's

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.070 
of pricey but I definitely think it's
worth<00:02:23.849> it<00:02:24.180> I<00:02:24.300> mean<00:02:24.480> I've<00:02:24.599> had<00:02:24.720> it<00:02:24.810> for<00:02:24.959> two

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
worth it I mean I've had it for two

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.410 
worth it I mean I've had it for two
weeks<00:02:25.110> I<00:02:25.410> use<00:02:25.560> it<00:02:25.680> every<00:02:25.920> day<00:02:26.130> and<00:02:26.400> I<00:02:27.090> haven't

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
weeks I use it every day and I haven't

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.509 
weeks I use it every day and I haven't
made<00:02:27.569> like<00:02:27.870> a<00:02:27.900> dent<00:02:28.230> in<00:02:28.410> it<00:02:28.500> yet<00:02:28.709> so<00:02:28.980> I<00:02:29.400> think

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:29.519 
made like a dent in it yet so I think

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:31.070 
made like a dent in it yet so I think
this<00:02:30.030> will<00:02:30.090> probably<00:02:30.209> last<00:02:30.540> me<00:02:30.660> for<00:02:30.900> a<00:02:30.930> while
