 all technicals without exception 

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:07.390
 at the beginning of our vote 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:10.390
 because of this no 

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:14.320
 novgorod was done very well 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.320
 in 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:52.170
 according to the researcher 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.430
 appraisals for equipment 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:56.910
 all the rest 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.080

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.120

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.380
 5 9 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.040
 last half century 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.060
 four hundredth points 

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:07.090
 estimated for 1 thousand 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:08.330
 all the rest 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:09.470
 when activated 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:10.430
 5 9 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:11.530
 Part 0 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.180
 average of 5 thousand 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.170
 these are four hundredths points 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.020
 almost half do it 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.650
 88 42 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.650
 with 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:25.930
 I want to talk to me 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.880
 your score is not like 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.799
 accordingly sure skating 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:32.580
 the guys saw Kremenchug 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.480
 the fact is that I am impressed and I am 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.480
 made a suggestion that all skaters 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.390
 skated only under the classics 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.370
 Ivana very much 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.510
 Gives I will opportunity opens themselves 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:46.030
 performer 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.280
 never skated so 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.700
 I can not see and did not notice that 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.410
 what struck professional 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:56.660
 our jury members are purely emotional 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:58.640
 I want to say that me 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.440
 hell is this music 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.300
 wonderful performance of waterways 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.280
 Lobacheva Elisha Levy sex 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.270
 touched by the depths of the soul like a bird like that 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.270
 just awesome 

00:02:13.359 --> 00:02:14.859
 Hanescu text 

00:02:14.859 --> 00:02:16.469
 plays a big role 

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:18.059
 but she is a highway in that regard 

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:20.749
 net premiere attention i clean 

00:02:20.749 --> 00:02:23.369
 emotionally set 6 06 probably 

00:02:23.369 --> 00:02:26.369
 maxims can not always deceive 

00:02:27.499 --> 00:02:28.839
 Antonov 

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:30.269
 say a 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:33.269
 and was not shocked this number 

00:02:34.169 --> 00:02:36.899
 I will explain my grades for today at 

00:02:36.899 --> 00:02:37.759
 semi final 

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:40.819
 and we must be very responsible 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:42.499
 relate to those estimates that we 

00:02:42.499 --> 00:02:44.569
 set because the moment of truth comes 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:47.149
 we are about to reveal 

00:02:47.149 --> 00:02:48.199
 the winner 

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:51.039
 I left my marks compared transfer 

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:53.929
 Vladimir with the previous fall 

00:02:53.929 --> 00:02:55.319
 and in my opinion 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:57.349
 technically 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:00.099
 a little bit today the guys lost exactly 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:02.739
 just like a feast however the general atmosphere is 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:04.749
 General impression of the program 

00:03:04.749 --> 00:03:06.950
 so I put it necessary ten below it 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.739
 technology and his father in measure 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:11.849
 thanks anton 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:13.569
 although he also does not need 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:16.979
 and what did not like wanda higher score 

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:18.549
 of course I didn't like it 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:20.219
 just this level 

00:03:20.219 --> 00:03:23.589
 which are not counting yet and even overstated 

00:03:23.589 --> 00:03:26.159
 and the thing that provided the resident 

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:28.179
 treat people who are sitting behind 

00:03:28.179 --> 00:03:29.609
 the table 

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:32.409
 but I can not otherwise but there is a criminal record 

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:33.979
 the plains 

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:37.179
 we have such a task 

00:03:37.179 --> 00:03:39.569
 like us or not like i can't 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:40.649
 compare 

00:03:40.649 --> 00:03:43.649
 how will they turn up the basket 

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:46.879
 and his Beroeva choosing 

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:49.879
 learning the way that went 

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:54.379
 Now if I have not heard 

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:02.539
 gray 

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:05.919
 yes ok and number 

00:04:05.919 --> 00:04:08.929
 music 

00:04:08.929 --> 00:04:11.929
 that's a lot 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:19.079
 attacker forces 

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:27.159
 despite his skating tonight 

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:29.399
 I do not think that we have always been able to 

00:04:29.399 --> 00:04:30.150
 get used to 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.009
 the third compliment to which all but 

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:34.910
 weigh out even this don't ask with bad 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:37.100
 business she betrayed so many books to another 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:38.009
 a leg 

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:41.009
 so we are not upset 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.150
 it's too active 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:55.240
 at the rate 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.879
 on the contrary, I agree 

00:04:56.879 --> 00:05:00.439
 I will say that Siberia works a lot like me 

00:05:00.439 --> 00:05:03.469
 I look 

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:06.469
 in 2009 

00:05:07.719 --> 00:05:10.319
 all is well 

00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:13.319
 miss out 

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:18.439
 semi final how do you think he will 

00:05:18.439 --> 00:05:21.849
 slow enough 

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:24.570
 don't really think of course not 

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:27.590
 but can explain what they should remember 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:30.169
 we are not for what we believe bed 5 9 and 1 

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:32.510
 and in this dance I also think that 

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:34.949
 unfairly our estimates on st though 

00:05:34.949 --> 00:05:36.340
 maybe it was some kind of error 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:38.710
 but they happen to everyone 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:41.710
 they are not noticed 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:44.999
 after publication 

00:05:44.999 --> 00:05:47.129
 children's song statistics 

00:05:47.129 --> 00:05:48.229
 let there always be sunshine
