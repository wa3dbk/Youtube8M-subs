00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.549
 hi friends pavel shakira microphone and 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:08.660
 Today in the pillbox came new chests I 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:12.870
 certainly not happy with things 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:15.750
 being in them but what now for 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.750
 at least one box of thirty 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.970
 two subjects fall out so why would 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.680
 let's not open them and probably not 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.930
 we will pull because it is the most 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.000
 annoying when someone opens 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.300
 chests drawn for half an hour Tipo saying here 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.230
 such a thing there is such a just take and 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:36.440
 let's open the first chest and the first ones 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:40.070
 two subjects 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.070
 what will we have there 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:52.149
 Basically not bad perfume I wanted 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.040
 ok drove on the next two 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:54.940
 of course I would like to get 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:59.440
 anything from 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:05.850
 you rer and stream lyre because they 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:08.680
 Surely worth the money about the helmet well and back 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.409
 principle in general for me these things are not 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.240
 especially interesting except for the stick on the ruby 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:16.960
 probably because he really 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.670
 good and the rest is so-so ward 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:22.050
 can on pugnu although he with her not 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.050
 combined by the hero himself 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:29.770
 about wonderful dogs so that we have 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.390
 2 things left 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.310

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.929
 That is what comes out of clothes 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.329
 such will fall out and not will not 

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:42.640
 repeat and they will drop you to the end 

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:45.969

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:48.130

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:49.060
