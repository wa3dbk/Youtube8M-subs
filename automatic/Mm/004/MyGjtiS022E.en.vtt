00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:09.290
 so I start with the tonic lotion 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:11.600
 i ii at pddaa which is handmade but 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.490
 smooth and that is low as his name 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.540
 the indicated hyper refreshing is 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:16.820
 super nice 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.410
 she uses the morning so jean 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.720
 does not apply everything on the face in 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:23.110
 avoiding to put on the eyes any 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.110
 simply 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.750
 then I go for these Roma who is at 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:42.570
 the pomegranate and that comes again 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.730
 from Weleda as it serves to make me 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:48.060
 meaning that is super nice to use 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.220
 his angel is actually made to prevent 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:52.110
 early signs of age and there are 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:54.000
 full of antioxidant assets so that's 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.010
 perfect for protecting from the sun and 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.930
 pollution 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:00.900
 then I use my seaplane cream 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.020
 light nocher bioderma here is layer in 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:05.759
 to finish and that suits me 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:08.750
 very well for the moment so I'm 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:08.750
 rather satisfied 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.240
 and 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.070
 we now go to makeup games 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.130
 graphically founded by shelly web 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.410
 manna london which is really great that 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.930
 I really like who can go for 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:33.570
 relative to the background so usual but 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.930
 of the perfect concept for spring and 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.930
 summer 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.010
 we 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.270
 so I'm thinking now about the powder 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.869
 bronzer that comes from hbo 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:07.149
 greenwalt string so be 1.05 and she 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:10.450
 is just sublime it warms the complexion 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:12.069
 in a super subtle way but very pretty 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.660
 mother of pearl skin and frankly I have a 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:15.010
 huge favorite for this product 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:22.750
 so I recommend them more 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:24.700
 does not really cost much then I 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.549
 adds the little cave mama blush of the 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:30.220
 bowl marne which is a sublime coral 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:32.680
 a little pearly too and who will I 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:35.500
 finds very very well with the powder of 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:39.569
 sun is there that adds a small effect 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.569
 good stuffed mine face 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:45.700
 now it's the turn of the powder 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.769
 at mac and mattifying and that I like 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.599
 a lot it hit a premium that comes 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:52.000
 really attached to everything I said 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:54.040
 before he will avoid shining 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.739
 in the day that really attracts me 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:59.459
 ultra good so there is really great 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:59.459
 I recommend it 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:06.360
 so now I'm going to the phase of 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:09.260
 shufat which is shufat 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.260
 shadows in chains 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:16.110
 no it is al farabi stone which is to 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.190
 shadow and black star of 21 in the hand 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.830
 that mr rock 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.690
 so in fact it's a blush cream that is 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.970
 just gorgeous in shades a little 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.980
 strand violin I'm not too how 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.790
 to tell you but it's just that we 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.790
 really 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.010
 I 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:03.480
 so now I'm doing the cricket that 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:06.180
 comes from masterpieces set in the water 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:09.720
 but it's an extra to benson has reached 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:11.459
 0.2 who is a pretty little blue and me 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:14.480
 it's really nice to add 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:14.480
 a few colors for the season 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:24.330
 now it's mascara's turn 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.670
 comes from late is the light camera 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:28.500
 I was letting go of what is just a killing 

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:30.990
 I think I bought it against 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.520
 United States because it's really not 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:38.280
 the big discoveries and I find 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:41.040
 that it's just perfect no it's at 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:43.140
 eyebrow with wood with 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:44.660
 special vanilla sheana what generates 

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:47.070
 the soft brown hue 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:49.230
 I put a little time a regular 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:57.780
 products but now I love it 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:59.910
 is really very practical and 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.860
 now we go to the lips with this 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:04.080
 little product of shenley what is a 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:06.810
 premium soft makli I have in 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.880
 reaching san paulo and that is very 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:10.920
 very nice to buy a little bit of pep 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:21.060
 on the lips to wake up a little the 

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:23.580
 time me already gold so here is the little 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:26.520
 final result I like it a little 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:27.450
 colorful it's pretty glittering perfect 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.790
 for sunny days 

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:31.710
 it's not more complicated but I like 

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:37.500
 do a lot of that and I hope that 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:39.510
 case where is there then this is the moment when I 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:42.060
 against me I did not stop filming 

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:49.560
 and where I make a head a little bit 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:51.180
 baths and storage and that's the end 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:53.370
 of this little video with a view of 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:55.350
