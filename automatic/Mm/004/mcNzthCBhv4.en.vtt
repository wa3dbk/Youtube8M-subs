it<00:02:06.189> off<00:02:06.340> I<00:02:06.520> think<00:02:06.789> as<00:02:07.060> for<00:02:07.600> a<00:02:07.630> cure<00:02:08.050> well<00:02:08.830> that

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
it off I think as for a cure well that

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:10.930 
may be a ways off but researchers

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:12.360 
may be a ways off but researchers
