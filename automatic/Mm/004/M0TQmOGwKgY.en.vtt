00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:10.190
 very good and the very good guys 

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:12.980
 we are in a news story of who never 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:14.960
 they want monterrey that is going to be 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:17.750
 we are effectively in a new 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:20.150
 news from our analyst 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:22.670
 videogames favorites edition because 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.800
 this time one thing happens is that I'm 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:27.199
 completely agree with him since 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.769
 well, many times he says things 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:32.059
 quite logical and others pretty 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:34.010
 crazy but this time michael 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:36.650
 patcher claims that an xbox ones 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.479
 inquieren of series will be essential 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.519
 to deal with the sales of 

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:42.830
 playstation 4 and is that the analyst 

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:45.890
 michael pachter, he has shown himself very 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:48.589
 critical with the peripheral kinect and already 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:51.280
 you know that in his last program of 

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:53.330
 bachata has commented the following 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:56.570
 I think a big potential change 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:58.670
 would not include kinect if they do not include 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:01.400
 kinect I'm not sure that that gives 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.680
 place to a different exhibition I think 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:06.560
 that would result in a console without 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.990
 camera or microphone series what if 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.250
 you think about what kinect does and why 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.659
 necessary 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:15.200
 you need games 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:18.499
 and currently there is no game 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:21.380
 that attracts me except central temps and 

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:23.960
 kinect sports I want to say the rest is not 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.630
 they are really so fun and I do not think 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:29.060
 that many people buy them to be 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:32.630
 believes that microsoft needs to get rid of 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:34.250
 kinect and lower the price to 400 dollars 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.340
 what is the cost of the console 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.950
 playstation 4 currently he thinks that 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.200
 Microsoft worries enough to 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.299
 consider a possible price record and 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.179
 the only way to do it is not to include 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:49.549
 and dynei that what can happen but not 

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:53.569
 I would expect it to happen in the first 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:55.789
 half of 2014 so good I want 

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:57.920
