00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.740 
the shape of the star as the shape of my
mold<00:00:27.599> to<00:00:27.810> save<00:00:28.080> on<00:00:28.439> silicon<00:00:29.359> here<00:00:30.359> I've

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
mold to save on silicon here I've

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.319 
mold to save on silicon here I've
already<00:00:31.170> cut<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:31.769> pieces<00:00:32.040> of<00:00:32.399> foam<00:00:32.610> core<00:00:33.000> and

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
already cut the pieces of foam core and

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.720 
already cut the pieces of foam core and
now<00:00:34.050> you<00:00:34.110> can<00:00:34.410> see<00:00:34.620> that<00:00:34.800> I've<00:00:34.950> hinged<00:00:35.399> them

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
now you can see that I've hinged them

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.510 
now you can see that I've hinged them
like<00:00:36.420> scoring<00:00:36.870> and<00:00:37.200> folding<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.710> sides<00:00:37.739> and

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
like scoring and folding the sides and

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.170 
like scoring and folding the sides and
now<00:00:38.730> I'll<00:00:38.940> tack<00:00:39.239> them<00:00:39.510> down<00:00:39.860> like<00:00:40.860> so<00:00:41.280> and<00:00:41.550> then

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
now I'll tack them down like so and then

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.380 
now I'll tack them down like so and then
hot<00:00:42.420> glue<00:00:42.719> them<00:00:42.899> into<00:00:43.140> place<00:00:43.910> the<00:00:44.910> ideal

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
hot glue them into place the ideal

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.590 
hot glue them into place the ideal
material<00:00:45.660> to<00:00:46.230> make<00:00:46.350> your<00:00:46.559> walls<00:00:46.800> is<00:00:47.430> foam<00:00:48.210> core

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
material to make your walls is foam core

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.529 
material to make your walls is foam core
here<00:00:49.500> I've<00:00:49.770> cut<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.309> foam<00:00:50.520> core<00:00:50.820> into<00:00:51.180> strips

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
here I've cut the foam core into strips

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.760 
here I've cut the foam core into strips
and<00:00:52.230> now<00:00:52.440> I've<00:00:52.770> measured<00:00:53.160> out<00:00:53.460> each<00:00:53.879> angle<00:00:54.329> of

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:54.770 
and now I've measured out each angle of

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:59.420 
and now I've measured out each angle of
the<00:00:55.770> star<00:00:56.129> and<00:00:56.489> I'm<00:00:57.420> just<00:00:57.719> scoring<00:00:58.079> each<00:00:58.590> bolt

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
the star and I'm just scoring each bolt

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.720 
the star and I'm just scoring each bolt
that<00:00:59.879> I<00:00:59.910> will<00:01:00.270> make<00:01:00.420> with<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.960> foam<00:01:01.170> core

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 
that I will make with the foam core

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.119 
that I will make with the foam core
saves<00:01:02.730> a<00:01:02.910> lot<00:01:03.059> of<00:01:03.210> time<00:01:03.449> in<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.719> long<00:01:03.899> run<00:01:04.229> and

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
saves a lot of time in the long run and

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.910 
saves a lot of time in the long run and
I<00:01:05.220> can<00:01:05.430> just<00:01:05.610> glue<00:01:05.970> this<00:01:06.150> down<00:01:06.470> once<00:01:07.470> I'm<00:01:07.740> ready

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
I can just glue this down once I'm ready

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.969 
I can just glue this down once I'm ready
the<00:01:08.790> next<00:01:09.060> step<00:01:09.270> is<00:01:09.479> to<00:01:09.659> glue<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:10.380> sculpture

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
the next step is to glue the sculpture

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.880 
the next step is to glue the sculpture
to<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.400> foam<00:01:11.640> core<00:01:12.110> the<00:01:13.110> reason<00:01:13.439> why<00:01:13.590> you<00:01:13.650> want

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
to the foam core the reason why you want

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.600 
to the foam core the reason why you want
to<00:01:14.070> do<00:01:14.250> this<00:01:14.600> because<00:01:15.600> without<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:16.170> glue<00:01:16.610> the

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
to do this because without the glue the

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.210 
to do this because without the glue the
sculpture<00:01:18.150> will<00:01:18.299> float<00:01:18.659> upwards<00:01:19.259> after<00:01:20.130> you

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
sculpture will float upwards after you

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.350 
sculpture will float upwards after you
pour<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.820> silicone<00:01:21.030> down<00:01:22.790> now<00:01:23.790> I'm<00:01:23.970> going<00:01:24.240> to

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
pour the silicone down now I'm going to

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.749 
pour the silicone down now I'm going to
glue<00:01:24.570> down<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.869> pre-cut<00:01:25.619> wall<00:01:25.950> that<00:01:26.280> I<00:01:26.310> did

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
glue down the pre-cut wall that I did

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:32.330 
glue down the pre-cut wall that I did
earlier

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.170 

next<00:01:33.329> I<00:01:33.509> will<00:01:33.689> take<00:01:33.930> some<00:01:34.140> hot<00:01:34.380> glue<00:01:34.790> and<00:01:35.790> glue

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
next I will take some hot glue and glue

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.929 
next I will take some hot glue and glue
around<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.659> edge<00:01:36.840> of<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.140> box<00:01:37.579> to<00:01:38.579> make<00:01:38.759> sure

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
around the edge of the box to make sure

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.609
