00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.419
 we want here if you want to make a 

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:11.099
 stabilized pastry and you have to 

00:00:09.419 --> 00:00:13.499

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:26.400
 dump the pastry top then 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.650
 when you win chocolate on a step 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:35.100
 what it is going to do is melt the 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:37.530

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:03.040
 of the lemon action with the sweet of the 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.040

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:18.569
 Decorate this cake with at once straight 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:21.290
 little one, he put on his bib 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:24.670
 a Pan-American portion 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.670
 you always ask me 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:31.000
 this was ana ricardi said let's do 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:34.480
 the envoy 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:37.930
 really but you will love it 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:41.160
 in your house it says how rich the 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:44.590
 chocolate cream with meringue 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:48.870
 spectacular if you simply groom us 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.870
 we are decorating with little 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:58.640
 also they will see when we 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:04:05.990
 press so that although another hose 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:07.940
 and a question during absolute 

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:10.670
 what does the custard have to do with 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:11.900
 the english action good is similar what 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:13.880
 What happens is that the English cream 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:17.570
 has corn starch since the cream 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:21.160
 English is much lighter is more 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:23.950
 liquid but the texture that it has is 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:26.630
 minimally thick in all the gems 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:28.760
 be very careful not to overdo it 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:30.830
 because he can not serve he has to talk 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:32.330
 85 degrees then it's like a point 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:34.730
 We are going to make it one day 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.530
 because it is a very delicious cream 

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:39.790
 very rich are related but what 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:39.790
 the difference is he 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:46.110
 They are like mate I like to drink mate 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.330
 while the cakes especially with 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:51.060
 this is called the summit that is a 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:52.800
 reservation that carries the rioja de san 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.660
 juan 'from tucumán and from córdoba all 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.639

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:59.219

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:04.310
 takes the summit with true 

00:04:59.219 --> 00:05:04.310

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:29.340
