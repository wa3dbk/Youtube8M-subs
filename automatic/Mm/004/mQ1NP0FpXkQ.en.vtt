00:00:01.889 --> 00:00:04.889
 Unna 

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:13.179
 watchmakers at Askania work on a watch for up to 36 hours 

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:16.009
 in the Berlin manufactory c precision 

00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:19.009
 book the result for several thousand euros 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.769
 Managing Director Leonhard MÃ¼ller has been working half a life 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.769
 long with watches 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:30.689
 the technology 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.689
 fascinates him to this day 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:40.430
 So a purely mechanical clock consists of 150 to 200 a page though roughly 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.340
 and if you then look at this artwork Rheine and and and then you 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.030
 Percent inhibitions and so on that's where the heart of a living beats 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.400
 Advance payment 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.570
 Askania is one of the last and manufactories in Germany 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.319
 the company history is shown with pleasure 

00:00:57.319 --> 00:01:00.660
 SID is part of the marketing strategy 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.210
 already in the early twentieth century in through the company measuring instruments 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.210
 at that time mainly for aviation 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.480
 There are only very few companies she has such a great story 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.290
 which is also comprehensible in pictures 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.290
 to be politically unable to prove 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:26.090
 produced since 2004 that can only up 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.150
 and maybe back to the design of the thirties 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.970
 the dials but the old board instruments remember 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.420
 Tradition plays a big role in the industry 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.120
 because with expensive watches, the story is behind the clock 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.120
 at least as important as the watch itself 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:48.820
 The design of Berlin is usually quite simple 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.820
 the time inflow a glance can be seen 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.610
 Production Manager Markus Maier tells a mechanical gimmick about it 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.030
 are the watchmakers ever several years 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.729
 This model has a mechanical alarm as a mineral alarm 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:07.670
 to show this point to this way show that set the alarm time 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.259
 by running the clock at this time 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:15.499
 Christensen 

00:02:15.499 --> 00:02:18.499
 so they reported 

00:02:22.469 --> 00:02:25.179
 that little business in downtown Berlin 

00:02:25.179 --> 00:02:28.309
 Here the over 30 models are sold out of own production 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:29.950
 with such shops 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.319
 the watchmakers make their biggest sales 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:36.319
 Spontaneous purchases are more the exception 

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:40.349
 never would have 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:42.989
 But he was Sophie handkerchiefs 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:46.129
 so are definitely resting well anyway 

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:49.609
 included among others 

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:52.609
 and again is about 2000 euros 

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:58.549
 as already know the parents I have times when the beats 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:03.439
 For a long time, Sokhiev and election centers were probably still using ancient ones 

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:05.939
 longer 

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:09.659
 the competition in the market for mobile and is extremely tough 

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:11.029
 to be able to keep up 

00:03:11.029 --> 00:03:13.709
 Muslima cross-channel become even better known 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:16.709
 with a tight advertising budget quite a challenge 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:23.260
 at the moment percent where my life 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.260
 has a unique selling point 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:28.290
 another one 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.299
 Norman has his majesty the fascination of emotions 

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:34.030
 the failure is 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:35.630
 then you are with them 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:38.630
 Great and then you are criticized 

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:43.629
 In the meantime, the Berlin watch manufacturer is making one 

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:46.729
 Turnover of around 1 comes 5 million euros 

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:49.020
 So far, however, in the very big is 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.800
 until then we are still a little bit of time away
