00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.290
 percent 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.290
 a couple of words should probably be said 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.220
 according to the minister 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.350
 it consists of six sections 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.580
 and basically the most interesting ones 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.740
 of course the picture 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.510

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.969
 percent 

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:26.960
 of course here with us 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.700
 chooses himself 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.740
 various brightness options 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.730
 backlight contrast 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:34.570
 maz 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.990
 and in principle 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.520
 can only be run on 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.100
 the rest of him 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.640
 this is me services accordingly yes 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.470
 because the coin can fulfill the role 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:45.540
 TVs 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.630
 and it is equipped with two speakers there are two 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.620
 option to work with a timer 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:52.450
 like a regular tv 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.400
 there are different kinds 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.680
 locks praise you can choose another 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:57.730
 menu language 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:59.980
 And the Ukrainian word to say 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:03.290
 does not support itself 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:04.620
 there is he 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.310
 except lock system 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.129
 it's all done so is it worth the kids 

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:12.809
 so now 

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:15.659
 we switch to mode 

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:18.139
 some other 

00:02:18.139 --> 00:02:20.499
 Well, for starters probably 

00:02:20.499 --> 00:02:22.159
 connect 

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:25.159
 remember with us 

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:29.789
 I'll take the cult from 

00:02:29.789 --> 00:02:32.469
 in his opinion 

00:02:32.469 --> 00:02:34.749
 June 17 in many ways 

00:02:34.749 --> 00:02:37.749
 let's see what happens 

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:41.869
 humorous khanum 

00:02:47.619 --> 00:02:49.759
 and that is 

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:50.650
 now 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.830
 the monitor works in my normal mode 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.149
 home tv 

00:02:54.149 --> 00:02:55.759
 connected via 

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:57.629
 nasty cable 

00:02:57.629 --> 00:02:59.629
 television snapshots 

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:02.629
 can look somewhere near in this review 

00:03:03.339 --> 00:03:06.359
 they are still he 

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:09.359
 won another source 

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:12.159
 we look at the broadcast which 

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:12.879
 is coming 

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:15.879
 currently your drives 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:20.239
 as you can see here is the last year he 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:22.309
 last currently 

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:23.979
 like this is a hospital 

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:25.149
 if you take 

00:03:25.149 --> 00:03:26.559
 remote under 

00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:29.029
 the words of my nine player 

00:03:29.029 --> 00:03:31.199
 according to be appropriate 

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:33.859
 picture 

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:35.739
 picture to manage as it is done with 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:36.819
 ordinary 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:39.969
 television 

00:03:39.969 --> 00:03:42.049
 Mitsubishi seeing loyalty 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:43.990
 but on this stone everything 

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:45.839
 whole country and opportunities 

00:03:45.839 --> 00:03:47.329
 the monitor is really very 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:48.479
 interesting 

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:50.679
 I'll probably show you how to switch 

00:03:50.679 --> 00:03:51.869
 picture 

00:03:51.869 --> 00:03:53.809
 we leave them 

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:56.809

00:03:57.929 --> 00:04:00.739
 TVs 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:03.349
 right now I'm worth the format increased 

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:05.119
 who used to 

00:04:05.119 --> 00:04:06.180

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:09.619
 cable sciences 

00:04:09.619 --> 00:04:12.519
 Here is the classic 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:15.099
 16 09 

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:16.969
 apparently the picture is growing but 

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:19.749
 pay attention to at the center of which 

00:04:19.749 --> 00:04:22.989
 ladies of a kind n secret they are good bikmaev 

00:04:23.509 --> 00:04:26.509

 healed girl formats 

00:04:33.319 --> 00:04:35.490

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:44.599
 but according to the rules 

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:46.779
 issued to cameras 

00:04:46.779 --> 00:04:48.080
