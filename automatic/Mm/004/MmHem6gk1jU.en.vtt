happening to him everything is what he
sees<00:01:53.720> I<00:01:54.050> think<00:01:54.350> because<00:01:54.649> of<00:01:54.679> that<00:01:54.890> his

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.130 
sees I think because of that his
performance<00:01:55.580> becomes<00:01:56.090> kind<00:01:56.630> of<00:01:56.690> underrated

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
for the for the role which I don't think

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.350 
for the for the role which I don't think
awards<00:02:03.380> for<00:02:03.440> everything<00:02:03.800> but<00:02:04.039> but<00:02:04.940> still<00:02:05.119> it's

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:56.600 
what I'm talking about the writing I

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:00.430 
what I'm talking about the writing I
think<00:05:56.840> speaks<00:05:57.170> for<00:05:57.380> itself<00:05:57.680> more<00:05:58.640> so<00:05:58.940> just<00:05:59.720> the

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:00.440 
think speaks for itself more so just the

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.140 
think speaks for itself more so just the
story<00:06:00.770> in<00:06:00.920> the<00:06:01.010> subject<00:06:01.430> matter<00:06:01.460> the<00:06:01.880> story

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:25.780 
touchy time period in in Russian history
one<00:06:24.650> more<00:06:24.770> thing<00:06:24.919> I<00:06:25.010> feel<00:06:25.160> like<00:06:25.250> I<00:06:25.340> should<00:06:25.580> have

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:25.790 
one more thing I feel like I should have

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:27.610 
one more thing I feel like I should have
to<00:06:26.000> talk<00:06:26.210> about<00:06:26.450> before<00:06:26.600> I<00:06:26.780> wrap<00:06:26.990> up<00:06:27.020> is<00:06:27.350> the

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:27.620 
to talk about before I wrap up is the

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:30.700 
to talk about before I wrap up is the
music<00:06:27.919> score<00:06:28.250> which<00:06:28.880> is<00:06:29.210> one<00:06:29.930> of<00:06:30.050> my<00:06:30.200> favorites

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:30.710 
music score which is one of my favorites

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:34.470 
music score which is one of my favorites
and<00:06:31.960> just<00:06:32.960> most<00:06:33.230> of<00:06:33.410> David<00:06:33.740> Lean's<00:06:33.950> scores

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:34.480 
and just most of David Lean's scores

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:36.430 
and just most of David Lean's scores
particularly<00:06:35.480> what<00:06:35.900> I'm<00:06:35.990> thinking<00:06:36.200> about<00:06:36.260> is

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:36.440 
particularly what I'm thinking about is

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:39.580 
particularly what I'm thinking about is
also<00:06:36.710> Lawrence<00:06:37.010> of<00:06:37.100> Arabia<00:06:37.400> are<00:06:37.580> just<00:06:38.590> there

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:39.590 
also Lawrence of Arabia are just there

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:42.670 
also Lawrence of Arabia are just there
so<00:06:40.040> I<00:06:40.640> don't<00:06:41.630> know<00:06:41.750> there's<00:06:42.020> such<00:06:42.169> a<00:06:42.200> memorable

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:42.680 
so I don't know there's such a memorable

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:45.370 
so I don't know there's such a memorable
part<00:06:42.950> of<00:06:43.130> the<00:06:43.250> movie<00:06:43.810> not<00:06:44.810> to<00:06:44.840> mention<00:06:45.169> the

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:45.380 
part of the movie not to mention the

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:47.980 
part of the movie not to mention the
fact<00:06:45.530> that<00:06:45.680> they<00:06:45.860> really<00:06:46.430> honor<00:06:46.700> the<00:06:47.690> story

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:47.990 
fact that they really honor the story

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:49.510 
fact that they really honor the story
that's<00:06:48.110> being<00:06:48.290> told<00:06:48.410> if<00:06:48.890> you<00:06:48.919> understand<00:06:49.430> what

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:49.520 
that's being told if you understand what

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:50.800

I'm<00:06:49.610> saying

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:50.810 
I'm saying

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:52.960 
I'm saying
particularly<00:06:51.440> Lara's<00:06:52.130> theme<00:06:52.160> in<00:06:52.610> Doctor

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:52.970 
particularly Lara's theme in Doctor

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:56.140 
particularly Lara's theme in Doctor
Zhivago<00:06:53.680> really<00:06:54.680> adds<00:06:54.919> to<00:06:55.190> the<00:06:55.400> romance<00:06:55.850> and
