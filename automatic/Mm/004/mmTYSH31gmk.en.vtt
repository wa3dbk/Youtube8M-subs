we got to control our mistakes very

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.270 
we got to control our mistakes very
easily<00:01:11.930> because<00:01:12.930> all<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.439> Qt<00:01:13.920> ways<00:01:14.100> which

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
easily because all the Qt ways which

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.399 
easily because all the Qt ways which
were<00:01:14.430> going<00:01:14.670> in<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:14.909> kitchen<00:01:15.060> after<00:01:15.719> punching

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409

the<00:01:16.560> orders<00:01:16.979> from<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.460> software<00:01:17.819> outside<00:01:18.509> the

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
the orders from the software outside the

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.169 
the orders from the software outside the
field<00:01:18.869> then<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.950> mistakes<00:01:20.579> which<00:01:21.060> were

00:01:21.169 --> 00:01:21.179 
field then the mistakes which were

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:23.899 
field then the mistakes which were
happening<00:01:21.539> before<00:01:21.749> that<00:01:22.439> reduce<00:01:22.859> to<00:01:23.130> zero

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
happening before that reduce to zero

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.480 
happening before that reduce to zero
percent<00:01:24.060> level<00:01:24.420> so<00:01:25.200> it<00:01:25.469> was<00:01:25.679> successful<00:01:26.009> over

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
percent level so it was successful over

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.230 
percent level so it was successful over
there<00:01:26.700> and<00:01:27.200> all<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.560> orders<00:01:28.920> like<00:01:29.130> Qt<00:01:29.819> kitchen
