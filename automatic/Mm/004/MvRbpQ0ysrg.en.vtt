00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:11.269
 It's wondering why Ana and the Snow Queen made a big hit, hey, Ana and the Snow Queen 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:15.049
 I think it is not interesting as a movie 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:20.000
 Maybe in it was a big hit to the other various people have with care 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:23.810
 I do n't know that I do n't see that kind of news or criticism 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:29.899
 That everyone is impressed but it is strange to give up the queen of the hole and the snow 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:31.260
 It is r was that that Rerigo Rerigo anymore I freely away from any bondage 

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:36.990
 I sang so say I became 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:41.850
 What it also stand something also ties of family would be what the other to live with only one person throw away all 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:42.730
 Guy I've sang the human loneliness of the splendor that say I is not cold, even in the snow of the go 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.650
 so 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:52.300
 Why are you going to be moved there because the number of those songs is very moving 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:56.170
 What a strong thing is that a human being is not going to step back or it is connected with someone 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:01:00.430
 Obsession that should not be cry is I'm there in the us it various softening 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:01.690
 I just say that message dramas, news, teachers, parents, etc. 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:02.720
 It can not be said that 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:08.000
 But Leligo 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:12.500
 What went into the song of Noah independent of Tteyuu to humans and not throw all that kind of thing 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:16.220
 It amazing to say Datte do is based on the Poritsu is the freedom of the soul and I do that there is no 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:21.920
 I'm saying so I'm moved by it, but the end of the movie is that I said 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:22.340
 ESP of the older sister I is Toka now this and a good friend of your sister is what the that country 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:22.710
 Probably 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.549
 summer 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.869
 But I painted it like I was in a place where I want to be able to skate 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:34.170
 It is finished with good feeling 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:36.370
 And as a movie it's not as funny as the part of that song is going from the soft top as the highest point 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:40.810
 It is said that it will go down gradually 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:46.060
 What is it, I wonder if it 's the closest when I'm looking at that one thousand and ten thousand spirits 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:50.860
 Spirited I cut into that strange monster is bathhouse best when there everyone is in panic 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:53.230
 Interesting most becoming in from along the former gradually getting what Well this movie last 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:56.360
 I wonder what father and mother are 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:02:00.410
 Another something long ago when saying and went back to human beings 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:05.000
 That whole house does not do such a thing, and it is Kachihiro 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:09.830
 This mission is the guys that step had been saying narrow to say whether congratulations at all before the war 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:14.660
 Even though I thought I arranged a mess tail aika buzz Dari and the only Kunisaki Hayao 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:16.350
 So it's the same as that on the same day and that Chihiro is top class in Ghibli work 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:21.540
 It is the profit with the big movie 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:22.540
 The movie is probably like the lyrics or the song rather than asking for a law of law 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:28.150
 It 's such a He keeps 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:33.520
 Why Ana snow for I mean to that day jackpot is basically because I thought 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:36.700
 Will you There are many and how good that was a big hit if the that most cold words is 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:43.690
 That's because it made it fun for everyone to understand 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:45.580
 I said a little while ago in some of orphaned at physiological pleasure without thinking of such Toka integrity 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:49.780
 In Toka Callao sister that liked 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:51.040
 Oh something because I was still talk of such like I say I family Futsu anyone who was hit 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.540
 Can also 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.740
 I wanted to see that you were upset 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.430
 Anyway 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:57.430
 What 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:04.420
 The goal of the movie is after all 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:06.030
 It is mediocre as long as it is a Hollywood movie or an entertainment movie 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:10.590
 I have no choice but to say 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:14.550
 If at the end of the film people say loneliness is wonderful it is already Hodlovskiy 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:20.190
 It's an art movie, but it's an art movie, but I can say anything about it, though 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:25.440
 Entertainment films and so on. General salt and entertainment films are the last mediocre thing 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:26.050
 I have to say that it is wonderful to believe that your family is wonderful 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:30.850
 of 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:31.480
 I think that entertainment seems to be interesting that how great it is to make a break 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.200
 but 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.950
 Ana Snow's Success 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.040
 What 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:42.780
 The true sound of the side you are making will come out 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:46.190
 That regarding something of me is that because was great about will come out in song Te Lady Go 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.190
 It is hit or snow of Anna
