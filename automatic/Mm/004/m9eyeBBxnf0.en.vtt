 task by talking to you a little bit everything and a 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.400
 debate on which of all the snipers on 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.860

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.899
 which of the snipers you prefer with 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:33.920
 which one you play best but 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:36.050
 here we have a little debate on it 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.260

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.309
 here we do that ninja we go 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.190

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:45.379
 first of all I took bassan subscribers 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.640

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:48.440

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.730
 and that's where you shared the chain 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.769
 to subscribe to subscribe any 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.719
 what to your friends what will allow that 

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:04.370
 I make myself known a little more 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:06.920
 every time I always won a little 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:08.840
 more or less it would be great so 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.700
 what style of fear do you prefer with 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.740
 which you are most comfortable with 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.270
 for my part I have a soft spot for 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.950
 Saint Quentin dessert and that's it 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.189
 as much I think it proves the 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:21.110
 more used why I do not know I do not 

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:23.090
 do not say much I like marker 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.000
 well it's not the then a few 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.990
 faults anyway we'll say that put to 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.100
 everything is not good hiding place 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.320
 on black ops of what is really 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.060
 very boring there is not a lot of 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.619
 bullets in the sniper in his passion and 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.290
 charles big cap otherwise it's enough 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:37.520
 hot what can we we ourselves 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:41.810
 prevent him from making kwassa threads his 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:44.899
 costs and if not and otherwise it's up to you to 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:47.000
 give your opinion there is always there is 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:49.100
 as snipers with long posts 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.619
 pray like this 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:57.530
 parent is on a fort 3 here is the xps 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:59.270
 the house I even where 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.759
 find a kind of drug or new 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.590
 with the summed up what is besides 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:05.659
 very simple to assemble but if we see a 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.860
 hardcore for those who are not very 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:07.670
 comfortable and who would still like the 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.429
 go up I advise you to go in 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.989
 record so here's you debating which 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:14.540
 snipers you prefer the dock with 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:16.250
 which you will be better and it's a 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.660
 little top 5 6 or the little up of 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.040
 snipers finally do what you want 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:22.040
 a comment 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.260
 other than that I wanted you too 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.340
 to say that there would soon be a top 10 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.050
 on my channel am in the process of 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.340
 prepare the assault of the few days I 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.350
 a lot to do that is why 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.160
 also that I do not have much time to 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.930
 week do not put videos end 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.120
 here I say anyway a sacred 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.410
 pace for a few of my videos a 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.459
 video a week here usually I 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.989
 put a video every five six 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:42.739
 days old and I had a good 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:44.239
 week so that's why that's why I 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:45.440
 account also do others vary a 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:47.450
 little games do a little multi 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.950
 gaming star I have plenty of ideas in May to 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.170
 you if to give ideas about 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.840
 judges could test and that's 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:56.180
 ideas of two themes for I do not know 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.260
 me on black ops what am I 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.760
 could make a parody of some 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.170
 thing I do not really know what you give 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.540
 me your ideas that it would always be 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:05.030
 nice and it's great but its bubble 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:07.070
 it makes me make videos that I would have 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.540
 never could swear I think to do this kind 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:10.760
 So frankly videos give myself 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.620
 ideas of concepts what can it 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.060
 frankly be nice and who knows that 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.680
 can maybe make the buzz in game you 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.780
 thank you as it should 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.600
 otherwise I add all the subscribers on 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.790
 skype and on steam so time that my 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.410
 style but not full go bombarded 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.570
 I accept everyone plays with 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:29.209
 everyone is that too who who 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:31.430
 I hope you will like it with no 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:32.600
 badly of subscribers there is the same I would 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.970
 also something like what a subscriber you 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:37.220
 the materials but it's nice ah yes 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:38.209
 you finally wonder I have you have 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.010
 had to see that I had a little vision 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:41.390
 special on black ops from upstream armel 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.820
 is a bit too big or what 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:45.799
 it's just that I put the 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:46.910
 max field of vision that's it allows 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:49.730
 finally according to a 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:52.460
 a guy from my team and a little lob on 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:54.890
 the ganva team it allows to be there 

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:56.330
 more to be more accurate than six clubs and 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:58.010
 coop arrows he piles up again go over 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:01.780
 easily made to think of a small 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:04.070
 trick wants to try it does not cost anything 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.660
 while they already have I speak I speak 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:06.350
 I'm not too focused on that I 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:09.890
 am not first 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:11.150

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:13.010
 also an emblem for ave so if 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.870
 someone has a little idea for my 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:16.190
 emblem a do not hesitate hungry and players 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:18.200

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:20.480
 also look for a gfx for a new 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:22.430
 intro new fucking intro extra 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:23.840
 how does it begin to date a like 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.460
 everything is so here I would like 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.560
 to have a new one has too much oxygen 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.570
