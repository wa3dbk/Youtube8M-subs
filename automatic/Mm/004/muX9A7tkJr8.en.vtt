critical<00:01:14.369> so<00:01:14.760> in<00:01:14.970> this<00:01:15.119> instance<00:01:15.390> here<00:01:15.900> notice

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
critical so in this instance here notice

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.320 
critical so in this instance here notice
what<00:01:16.590> happens<00:01:17.130> if<00:01:17.280> I<00:01:17.520> don't<00:01:17.759> get<00:01:17.939> in<00:01:18.060> close

enough<00:01:18.409> I've<00:01:19.409> got<00:01:19.680> a<00:01:19.890> background<00:01:20.189> look<00:01:21.090> behind

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
enough I've got a background look behind

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.170 
enough I've got a background look behind
him<00:01:21.570> clearly<00:01:22.170> some<00:01:22.920> automobile<00:01:23.460> wheel<00:01:23.759> covers

him clearly some automobile wheel covers

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.510 
him clearly some automobile wheel covers
that<00:01:24.450> are<00:01:24.570> quite<00:01:24.810> distracting<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.950> solution

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
that are quite distracting the solution

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.670 
that are quite distracting the solution
real<00:01:26.939> simple<00:01:27.450> either<00:01:27.630> zoom<00:01:28.049> with<00:01:28.290> your<00:01:28.439> feet

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
real simple either zoom with your feet

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.760 
real simple either zoom with your feet
or<00:01:29.189> in<00:01:29.340> this<00:01:29.460> case<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.970> 24<00:01:30.450> to<00:01:30.570> 120<00:01:31.079> getting

or in this case the 24 to 120 getting
tighter<00:01:32.070> make<00:01:32.640> my<00:01:32.820> point<00:01:33.090> of<00:01:33.180> view<00:01:33.240> and<00:01:33.720> take<00:01:34.290> a

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
tighter make my point of view and take a

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.929 
tighter make my point of view and take a
look<00:01:34.530> at<00:01:34.650> that<00:01:34.740> one<00:01:34.950> I<00:01:35.220> think<00:01:35.640> you'll<00:01:35.790> agree

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
look at that one I think you'll agree

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.140 
look at that one I think you'll agree
that's<00:01:36.720> a<00:01:36.869> much<00:01:37.079> much<00:01:37.350> better<00:01:37.619> image<00:01:38.100> so<00:01:38.729> the

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
that's a much much better image so the

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.179 
that's a much much better image so the
key<00:01:39.360> here<00:01:39.390> is<00:01:39.630> clean<00:01:40.320> up<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.530> background<00:01:40.740> by

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
key here is clean up the background by

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.249 
key here is clean up the background by
simply<00:01:41.759> zooming<00:01:42.240> in<00:01:42.360> a<00:01:42.450> little<00:01:42.689> tighter<00:01:42.899> I

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
simply zooming in a little tighter I

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:44.749 
simply zooming in a little tighter I
don't<00:01:43.649> think<00:01:43.920> that<00:01:44.070> you<00:01:44.159> have<00:01:44.310> to<00:01:44.460> show

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
don't think that you have to show

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.789 
don't think that you have to show
everything<00:01:45.149> more<00:01:45.570> often<00:01:45.869> than<00:01:46.020> not<00:01:46.049> that'll

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
everything more often than not that'll

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.280 
everything more often than not that'll
get<00:01:46.950> you<00:01:47.100> in<00:01:47.220> trouble<00:01:47.450> hey<00:01:48.450> until<00:01:48.840> next<00:01:48.899> time
