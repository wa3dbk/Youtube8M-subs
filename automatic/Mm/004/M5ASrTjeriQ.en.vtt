this position and had I taken it months

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.249 
this position and had I taken it months
ago<00:01:15.630> I<00:01:16.880> wouldn't<00:01:17.880> have<00:01:17.970> gotten<00:01:18.689> some<00:01:18.930> of<00:01:19.080> the

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
ago I wouldn't have gotten some of the

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
experiences and uh just knowledge that

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.950 
experiences and uh just knowledge that
I've<00:01:23.970> gained<00:01:24.320> within<00:01:25.320> that<00:01:25.590> time<00:01:25.890> I'm<00:01:26.610> not

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
I've gained within that time I'm not

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.880 
I've gained within that time I'm not
regretting<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.049> fact<00:01:28.080> that<00:01:28.350> I<00:01:28.470> didn't<00:01:28.770> take

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
regretting the fact that I didn't take

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.999 
regretting the fact that I didn't take
it<00:01:28.950> earlier<00:01:29.689> but<00:01:30.689> it<00:01:30.990> was<00:01:31.290> just<00:01:31.439> a<00:01:31.530> lesson<00:01:31.979> that

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
it earlier but it was just a lesson that

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.969 
it earlier but it was just a lesson that
I<00:01:32.310> had<00:01:32.820> to<00:01:33.000> learn<00:01:33.150> I<00:01:33.210> guess<00:01:33.390> to<00:01:33.810> say<00:01:34.110> you<00:01:34.860> know

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
I had to learn I guess to say you know

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.370 
I had to learn I guess to say you know
wherever<00:01:35.220> he<00:01:35.490> wants<00:01:35.729> you<00:01:35.820> to<00:01:35.909> go<00:01:36.090> is<00:01:36.390> where

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
wherever he wants you to go is where

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.170 
wherever he wants you to go is where
you're<00:01:37.590> going<00:01:37.740> to<00:01:37.799> be<00:01:37.950> so<00:01:38.340> just<00:01:38.729> think<00:01:38.939> wisely

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
you're going to be so just think wisely

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.450 
you're going to be so just think wisely
about<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.810> decisions<00:01:40.290> that<00:01:40.350> you<00:01:40.590> make<00:01:40.799> don't

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
about the decisions that you make don't

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.060 
about the decisions that you make don't
go<00:01:41.670> solely<00:01:42.030> off<00:01:42.420> of<00:01:42.689> other<00:01:42.899> people's<00:01:43.070> reasons

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
go solely off of other people's reasons

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.160 
go solely off of other people's reasons
why<00:01:44.220> you<00:01:44.280> should<00:01:44.729> or<00:01:44.909> should<00:01:45.149> not<00:01:45.180> sometimes

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
why you should or should not sometimes

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.810 
why you should or should not sometimes
you<00:01:46.350> just<00:01:46.380> you<00:01:46.710> don't<00:01:46.829> need<00:01:47.159> advice<00:01:47.520> because

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
you just you don't need advice because

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.100
