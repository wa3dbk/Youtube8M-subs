00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.039
 hello pots that such hello hello oscar 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.219
 what a good afternoon, welcome to 

00:00:11.039 --> 00:00:16.049
 digital are one more time and today I bring you 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.430
 another doubt because as you know I still 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.740
 looking for a mobile because it can change 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.689
 of mobile that mine is broken 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.380
 found one and they charge me more because 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.030
 has nfc 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.530
 if I get cheaper because the nfc that 

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.910
 so I'm going to use it, it surprises me 

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.680
 let people tell you but I wrote this 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.200
 like it more because it has nfc when it is 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:37.350
 good nfc are the words the acronym in 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.780
 English of near field communications that 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.570
 they are near field communications and 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.670
 basically is this mobile has nfc and is 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:48.390
 this logo this iconic that is here 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.910
 and we have it here and we have here a 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.020
 camera that also has nfc for example 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.370
 then this is what your 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.110
 gratitude now that you're going to be a mother 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.420
 you will spend and time there how much 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.790
 have the boy or the girl you will want 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.410
 Take photos share them and you're going to 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:04.530
 happen that you will not have much time 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.210
 to upload them to the computer, retouch them and 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.979
 all that then look at this what allows 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.960
 the nfc one of the things that allows 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.940
 among other things is that you take a 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.649
 camera that has nfc like this 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.780
 that we have here you take some pictures 

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:18.000
 and racist since yesterday that I was in the 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.590
 debod temple taking pictures I have this 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.700
 picture and I want it I want to pass it to you 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.680
 and good is that we have other than that 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.590
 also has nfc lame unlock the 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.240
 phone and without more as I'm approaching the 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.429
 phone to this that is here that is the 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.600
 nfc sensor you will hear a noise 

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:34.540
 you will see 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:38.259
 and that means that already on the phone 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:40.030
 and the cell phone have already been paired and there 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:41.950
 we have here that you have done with click and 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.600
 now let's see on the screen the part 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.460
 on the camera screen here goes 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.200
 leaving the information here look at 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.790
 the mobile how they connect to wifi he 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.060
 all alone we do not have to do anything 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:55.509
 I was going to receive the photograph there after 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:57.820
 of a prudential time and the nfc that 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:59.380
 list is going to be relatively new 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.240
 they also incorporate the devices 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.860
 mobile since about as 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.840
 a couple of years a couple of and a half 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.550
 now it's going to become a standard 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.860
 because 'bareback' has incorporated in the 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:11.410
 iphone 6 and what will he call apple pay 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.480
 because this ultimately serves not only 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.190
 it serves for things like this there are also 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.330
 many televisions that have nfc and 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.980
 when you approach the television and what 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.959
 automatically you throw the 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.000
 application of videos and launches a video to 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:24.010
 TV or when you have a team of 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.110
 audio you approach when the nfc you 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.489
 you approach the insists as we have seen here 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.530
 and now and between two phones too 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:30.790
 you can also the tip that if I 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.019
 I take pictures with me and I would not have to 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.239
 be going through whatsapp the pics 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:37.720
 nothing 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:39.070
 also serves for photographs 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.720
 for example to put a video that 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.250
 have on the mobile on television for 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.500
 that my parents see it too 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.150
 you approach the television and if you have nfc it 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.070
 pasa serves also will serve in a future 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.360
 also for even to turn off you 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:51.850
 you approach an establishment that has 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.710
 nfc you put it on top and that's it and even 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.750
 It's good because they sell labels that 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:57.970
 they call them smart tags that 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:01.300
 that's like a bidi code, not this 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:03.100
 works with magnetic waves not 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.930
 getting has nothing to do with wifi 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.360
 without anything like that your you approaches 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.160
 for the smart tag and 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.780
 automatically on the phone it gets 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.790
 in motion the bluetooth and they put on 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.560
 march the necessary things for that 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.860
 moment when you are in the car or 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.480
 be that in the end nfc if it serves you for 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:23.140
 many good stay stay with what 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:25.390
 the photos when it's important to have it 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.920
 not with the audio and effectively that 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:29.140
 It is something you will greatly facilitate the 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:32.200
 life in the following years 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:34.540
 good many thanks to Oscar for 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:37.090
 come with our doubts that are 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.650
 pretty common I appreciate you being 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:40.959
 finishing more and more the cables 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.760
 thanks to the nfc 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:44.800
 so nothing I hope you liked 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.350
