00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.729
 complete 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:02:00.160
 nothing here comes from below because 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:02:06.039
 that there is nothing there is an instruction here 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:11.940
 there is one in English 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:15.790
 Arabic is how much I remember in Russian 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:18.600
 Now in my opinion I was on the Russian forces Us 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.600

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:53.680
 I will remember what is in Russian contribution to 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.680
 In general, such an instruction 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:58.150
 the box itself is no longer there 

00:02:56.419 --> 00:03:02.389
 absolutely nothing 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:04.220
 the watch is now in order with 

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:06.370
 the box showed you now about themselves 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.370
 for hours 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:17.750
 watch somewhere in the online store you can 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:23.829
 buy for 2 2 500 for 1700 and 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:23.829
 and came out depending on what online store and 

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:35.269
 which modification which functions immediately 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:38.590
 I want to say that this is how I said 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:39.739
 I bought myself such a watch I bought brothers but 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:42.139
 firmware 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:44.419
 although the same clock is the same 

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:48.459
 firmware model is different here for example 

00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:51.199
 I have a city here army tirsk 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:54.530
 they are brothers from the army city 

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:56.629
 I only Moscow that is, keep in mind 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:04:01.180
 when will you buy if you take 

00:03:56.629 --> 00:04:06.229

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:11.090

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:30.020

 and now turn off the lights are not God knows 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:39.140
 What kind of backlit are you more patient ? 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:42.100
 all turn on the light so this is 

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:46.130
 backlight but at night, in principle, can be seen 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:49.480
 you can understand what is there and how is something there 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:56.090
 You can see it so well in the settings themselves 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:05:00.020
 let's go such super some 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:06.160

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:06.160

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:34.820

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:41.710

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:44.180
 About and then let's go and this is it already on the bill 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:46.100
 Speak time 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:50.450

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:56.090

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:58.640

00:05:56.090 --> 00:06:07.520

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:11.180
 us and this is what we have if he says 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:14.090
 after all incorrectly configured that is 

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:17.390
 here you can manually configure when and 

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:20.590
 what namaz and accordingly he farther 

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:20.590
 from this will count 

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:26.780
 in principle, something special is nothing more about 

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:28.610
 This clock will not speak because 

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:34.970
 asuras nothing more in this modification 

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:38.240

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:41.750

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:50.450
 I wanted to share this 

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:52.340
 if you take, be sure to check in 

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:54.490
 firmware is your city or not in 

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:58.250
 Mostly good watches are comfortable and very 

00:06:54.490 --> 00:07:00.050
 all quality belts are very high quality 

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:02.510
 don't tear 

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:06.280
 Unity does not irritate the skin tone they gave me 

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:08.510
 a little too tight because to the full 

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:11.630
 No additional holes have it 

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:14.030
 or do it yourself or like even 

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:17.960
 it's freezing cold 

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:21.950
 freezing cold they don't crack and 

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:25.090
 nothing like this happens in 

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:25.090
 Generally all bye
