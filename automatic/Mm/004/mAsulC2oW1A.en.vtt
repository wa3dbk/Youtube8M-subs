just<00:01:41.070> kind<00:01:41.250> of<00:01:41.280> whatever<00:01:41.780> so<00:01:42.780> if<00:01:42.930> you're<00:01:43.049> more

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
just kind of whatever so if you're more

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.080 
just kind of whatever so if you're more
like<00:01:43.470> me<00:01:43.710> and<00:01:43.740> using<00:01:44.310> for<00:01:44.579> more<00:01:44.700> personal

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
like me and using for more personal

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.149 
like me and using for more personal
stuff<00:01:45.299> you<00:01:45.509> know<00:01:45.630> if<00:01:46.079> you<00:01:46.229> travel<00:01:46.680> even<00:01:46.860> a<00:01:47.009> lot

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
stuff you know if you travel even a lot

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.350 
stuff you know if you travel even a lot
to<00:01:47.340> there's<00:01:47.520> probably<00:01:47.790> a<00:01:47.850> really<00:01:48.119> great

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
to there's probably a really great

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.840 
to there's probably a really great
camera<00:01:48.750> to<00:01:48.840> have<00:01:49.020> with<00:01:49.530> its<00:01:49.740> video<00:01:50.040> and<00:01:50.280> photo

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
camera to have with its video and photo

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.780 
camera to have with its video and photo
qualities<00:01:51.420> to<00:01:51.600> it<00:01:51.950> but<00:01:52.950> if<00:01:53.430> you're<00:01:53.549> going<00:01:53.670> to

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
qualities to it but if you're going to

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:54.859 
qualities to it but if you're going to
be<00:01:53.880> using<00:01:53.970> it<00:01:54.180> for<00:01:54.329> professional<00:01:54.840> purposes

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
be using it for professional purposes

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.420 
be using it for professional purposes
which<00:01:55.409> I<00:01:55.560> don't<00:01:55.680> really<00:01:55.799> know<00:01:55.950> why<00:01:56.100> you<00:01:56.159> would

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
which I don't really know why you would

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.580 
which I don't really know why you would
but<00:01:56.700> it's<00:01:57.630> not<00:01:57.840> going<00:01:57.960> to<00:01:58.049> be<00:01:58.110> good<00:01:58.229> for<00:01:58.469> that

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
but it's not going to be good for that

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.980 
but it's not going to be good for that
it's<00:01:59.579> definitely<00:01:59.939> more<00:02:00.240> just<00:02:00.570> a<00:02:00.630> personal

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
it's definitely more just a personal

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.719 
it's definitely more just a personal
kind<00:02:01.110> of<00:02:01.229> use<00:02:01.350> camera<00:02:01.799> now<00:02:02.189> that<00:02:02.369> might<00:02:02.520> be

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
kind of use camera now that might be

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.609 
kind of use camera now that might be
obvious<00:02:03.119> since<00:02:03.299> it's<00:02:03.420> a<00:02:03.509> compact<00:02:03.960> camera<00:02:04.350> but

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
obvious since it's a compact camera but

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.190 
obvious since it's a compact camera but
I<00:02:04.860> I<00:02:05.460> still<00:02:06.149> think<00:02:06.180> I<00:02:06.570> should<00:02:06.810> throw<00:02:06.960> that<00:02:07.170> out

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
I I still think I should throw that out

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.650 
I I still think I should throw that out
there<00:02:07.439> and<00:02:07.680> say<00:02:07.890> that<00:02:08.179> well<00:02:09.179> I<00:02:09.209> think<00:02:09.360> it's<00:02:09.599> a

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
there and say that well I think it's a

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.540 
there and say that well I think it's a
great<00:02:09.750> camera<00:02:10.110> it<00:02:10.410> might<00:02:10.800> not<00:02:10.920> be<00:02:10.979> suited<00:02:11.370> for

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
great camera it might not be suited for

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.070 
great camera it might not be suited for
every<00:02:11.760> single<00:02:12.090> purpose

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
every single purpose

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.870 
every single purpose
like<00:02:13.350> for<00:02:13.500> instance<00:02:13.530> it<00:02:13.920> is<00:02:13.950> not<00:02:14.220> good<00:02:14.490> of

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
like for instance it is not good of

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.820 
like for instance it is not good of
taking<00:02:15.240> action<00:02:15.600> shots<00:02:15.840> like<00:02:16.230> if<00:02:16.440> something<00:02:16.620> is

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
taking action shots like if something is

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.560 
taking action shots like if something is
in<00:02:16.950> motion<00:02:17.130> it<00:02:17.430> gets<00:02:17.580> very<00:02:17.670> blurry<00:02:18.210> if<00:02:18.450> you

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
in motion it gets very blurry if you

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.570 
in motion it gets very blurry if you
take<00:02:18.720> a<00:02:18.750> picture<00:02:18.990> of<00:02:19.110> it<00:02:19.290> you<00:02:20.100> can<00:02:20.190> take<00:02:20.310> video

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
take a picture of it you can take video

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.280 
take a picture of it you can take video
of<00:02:20.640> it<00:02:20.880> that's<00:02:21.240> just<00:02:21.360> fine<00:02:21.660> but<00:02:22.110> if<00:02:22.200> you're

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
of it that's just fine but if you're

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:23.600 
of it that's just fine but if you're
trying<00:02:22.410> to<00:02:22.500> take<00:02:22.620> a<00:02:22.650> picture<00:02:22.920> of<00:02:23.040> something<00:02:23.130> of

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
trying to take a picture of something of

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.880 
trying to take a picture of something of
some<00:02:23.850> sort<00:02:24.060> of<00:02:24.090> motion<00:02:24.450> like<00:02:25.380> for<00:02:25.530> instance<00:02:25.560> a

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
some sort of motion like for instance a

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.520 
some sort of motion like for instance a
soccer<00:02:26.100> game<00:02:26.360> like<00:02:27.360> my<00:02:27.510> dad<00:02:27.690> he<00:02:28.050> borrowed<00:02:28.440> this

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
soccer game like my dad he borrowed this

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.710 
soccer game like my dad he borrowed this
camera<00:02:28.890> to<00:02:29.010> try<00:02:29.190> to<00:02:29.250> use<00:02:29.460> it<00:02:29.640> during<00:02:30.420> a<00:02:30.540> soccer

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
camera to try to use it during a soccer

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.070 
camera to try to use it during a soccer
game<00:02:31.190> that<00:02:32.190> my<00:02:32.400> sister<00:02:33.300> was<00:02:33.420> playing<00:02:33.690> in<00:02:33.870> and

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
game that my sister was playing in and

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.290 
game that my sister was playing in and
the<00:02:34.500> shots<00:02:34.860> came<00:02:35.040> out<00:02:35.100> very<00:02:35.370> blurry<00:02:35.760> and<00:02:36.060> it

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
the shots came out very blurry and it

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.790 
the shots came out very blurry and it
didn't<00:02:36.540> really<00:02:36.660> work<00:02:36.750> out<00:02:37.020> too<00:02:37.260> well<00:02:37.290> he

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
didn't really work out too well he

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.230 
didn't really work out too well he
wanted<00:02:38.040> to<00:02:38.130> try<00:02:38.340> it<00:02:38.370> though<00:02:38.580> because<00:02:38.730> it<00:02:39.000> takes

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
wanted to try it though because it takes

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:40.700 
wanted to try it though because it takes
very<00:02:39.360> good<00:02:39.600> pictures<00:02:39.990> in<00:02:40.110> low-light<00:02:40.320> though

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710 
very good pictures in low-light though

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:43.040 
very good pictures in low-light though
another<00:02:41.280> thing<00:02:41.580> that<00:02:41.610> it<00:02:42.210> well<00:02:42.570> may<00:02:42.600> not<00:02:42.900> be<00:02:43.020> a

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
another thing that it well may not be a

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.200 
another thing that it well may not be a
big<00:02:43.290> like<00:02:43.740> Khan<00:02:44.010> is<00:02:44.340> something<00:02:44.730> that<00:02:44.850> bothers

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.210 
big like Khan is something that bothers

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:47.930 
big like Khan is something that bothers
me<00:02:45.240> is<00:02:45.540> that<00:02:45.740> it<00:02:46.740> shoots<00:02:47.010> only<00:02:47.250> in<00:02:47.340> 24<00:02:47.730> frames

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
me is that it shoots only in 24 frames

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.330 
me is that it shoots only in 24 frames
per<00:02:48.000> second<00:02:48.390> and<00:02:48.510> not<00:02:48.660> 30<00:02:49.070> which<00:02:50.070> is<00:02:50.190> not

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
per second and not 30 which is not

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.940 
per second and not 30 which is not
that's<00:02:50.820> like<00:02:50.970> bad<00:02:51.270> but<00:02:51.750> it's<00:02:52.050> just<00:02:52.500> because

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
that's like bad but it's just because

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.210 
that's like bad but it's just because
that<00:02:53.520> I<00:02:53.820> forgot<00:02:54.450> that<00:02:54.810> and<00:02:55.470> I<00:02:55.709> was<00:02:55.890> rendering

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
that I forgot that and I was rendering

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.520 
that I forgot that and I was rendering
videos<00:02:56.610> I<00:02:56.730> edited<00:02:57.120> that<00:02:57.180> I<00:02:57.390> film<00:02:57.750> with<00:02:57.900> this<00:02:58.110> in

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
videos I edited that I film with this in

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.110 
videos I edited that I film with this in
30<00:02:59.010> frames<00:02:59.220> per<00:02:59.310> second<00:02:59.730> and<00:02:59.820> I<00:02:59.880> have<00:02:59.970> two

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
30 frames per second and I have two

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.610 
30 frames per second and I have two
videos<00:03:00.390> on<00:03:00.480> my<00:03:00.570> vlog<00:03:00.630> channel<00:03:01.110> right<00:03:01.200> now<00:03:01.260> that

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
videos on my vlog channel right now that

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.590 
videos on my vlog channel right now that
were<00:03:02.160> rendered<00:03:02.520> than<00:03:02.640> 30<00:03:02.820> frames<00:03:03.060> per<00:03:03.120> second

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
were rendered than 30 frames per second

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.900 
were rendered than 30 frames per second
and<00:03:03.690> were<00:03:04.260> shot<00:03:04.500> with<00:03:04.620> this<00:03:04.740> camera<00:03:05.040> and<00:03:05.340> I

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
and were shot with this camera and I

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:07.430 
and were shot with this camera and I
think<00:03:06.120> the<00:03:06.180> quality<00:03:06.360> looks<00:03:06.570> very<00:03:06.840> poor<00:03:07.200> and

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
think the quality looks very poor and

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.230 
think the quality looks very poor and
I'm<00:03:07.980> sure<00:03:08.190> it<00:03:08.430> affects<00:03:08.730> the<00:03:08.850> quality<00:03:08.970> a

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:09.240 
I'm sure it affects the quality a

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.940 
I'm sure it affects the quality a
tremendous<00:03:09.780> melt<00:03:09.990> when<00:03:10.080> you<00:03:10.230> render<00:03:10.440> it<00:03:10.650> wrong

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
tremendous melt when you render it wrong

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.070 
tremendous melt when you render it wrong
you<00:03:11.280> know<00:03:11.370> FPS<00:03:11.820> especially<00:03:12.360> with<00:03:12.570> more<00:03:12.870> than

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
you know FPS especially with more than

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.500 
you know FPS especially with more than
one<00:03:13.200> you<00:03:13.290> filmed<00:03:13.590> it<00:03:13.650> in<00:03:14.030> so<00:03:15.030> that's<00:03:15.420> just

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
one you filmed it in so that's just

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.360 
one you filmed it in so that's just
something<00:03:15.660> really<00:03:15.959> more<00:03:16.350> to<00:03:16.500> keep<00:03:16.620> in<00:03:16.800> mind<00:03:17.070> if

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
something really more to keep in mind if

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.190 
something really more to keep in mind if
you<00:03:17.550> do<00:03:17.730> get<00:03:17.880> to<00:03:18.000> camp<00:03:18.209> and<00:03:18.360> do<00:03:18.540> edit<00:03:18.870> with<00:03:19.019> it

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
you do get to camp and do edit with it

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.740 
you do get to camp and do edit with it
because<00:03:19.680> the<00:03:19.860> standard<00:03:20.250> is<00:03:20.370> usually<00:03:20.790> 30<00:03:21.000> so

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
because the standard is usually 30 so

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.140 
because the standard is usually 30 so
you<00:03:22.350> need<00:03:22.620> to<00:03:22.709> remember<00:03:22.890> render<00:03:23.550> it<00:03:23.700> or

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
you need to remember render it or

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:25.490 
you need to remember render it or
exporting<00:03:24.840> or<00:03:24.900> whatever<00:03:25.140> you<00:03:25.200> want<00:03:25.320> to<00:03:25.350> call

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
exporting or whatever you want to call

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.590 
exporting or whatever you want to call
it<00:03:25.560> into<00:03:26.070> 24<00:03:26.519> frames<00:03:26.790> per<00:03:26.880> second<00:03:27.330> so

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
it into 24 frames per second so

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.040 
it into 24 frames per second so
basically<00:03:27.989> some<00:03:28.350> cons<00:03:28.760> it<00:03:29.760> I<00:03:30.030> mean<00:03:30.360> like<00:03:30.900> I

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 
basically some cons it I mean like I

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:32.210 
basically some cons it I mean like I
said<00:03:31.080> that's<00:03:31.350> not<00:03:31.470> too<00:03:31.590> much<00:03:31.709> bad<00:03:31.920> i<00:03:31.950> can

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
said that's not too much bad i can

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.030 
said that's not too much bad i can
honestly<00:03:32.430> say<00:03:32.820> that<00:03:32.850> the<00:03:33.090> camera<00:03:33.560> but<00:03:34.560> it<00:03:34.800> does

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
honestly say that the camera but it does

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.850 
honestly say that the camera but it does
not<00:03:35.190> take<00:03:35.489> good<00:03:35.640> action<00:03:36.060> shots<00:03:36.330> and<00:03:36.720> it<00:03:37.470> only

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
not take good action shots and it only

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.920 
not take good action shots and it only
films<00:03:38.489> in<00:03:38.640> 24<00:03:39.060> frames<00:03:39.239> per<00:03:39.330> second<00:03:39.780> which

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
films in 24 frames per second which

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.229 
films in 24 frames per second which
really<00:03:40.470> looks<00:03:40.650> fine<00:03:40.920> it's<00:03:41.130> hardly<00:03:41.430> a<00:03:41.550> con<00:03:41.850> but

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
really looks fine it's hardly a con but

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:44.090 
really looks fine it's hardly a con but
it's<00:03:42.810> something<00:03:43.230> worth<00:03:43.380> mentioning<00:03:43.890> and

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
it's something worth mentioning and

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.580 
it's something worth mentioning and
something<00:03:44.970> again<00:03:45.810> you<00:03:45.989> really<00:03:46.260> need<00:03:46.410> to<00:03:46.470> keep

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
something again you really need to keep

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.130 
something again you really need to keep
in<00:03:46.739> mind<00:03:46.950> but<00:03:47.730> there<00:03:47.970> are<00:03:48.120> also<00:03:48.330> really<00:03:48.840> good
