00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.819
 I say flames a game that possibly 

00:00:03.199 --> 00:00:07.640
 become the best in the world in so 

00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:09.170
 only a few months or a few years is a game 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.540
 that in which 32 million people 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:13.220
 they play monthly and they get caught 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:15.350
 characters so that to win the 

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:18.470
 departure because because you feel very 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:21.109
 good characters like this teacher here 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.880
 it's a champ one chang look is one that 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:25.279
 it is not necessary to complicate life for 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.259
 kill enemy champions here I put you 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:30.310
 an example of what a champagne look is and 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:30.310
 what you might do 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.610
 do not 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.760
 As you can see, there has been a 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.740
 tremendous double but the important thing is 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.770
 how the player who is 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:03.720
 controlling the keyboard and the mouse here 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:03.720
 you can see a sample of what it does 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.400
 only one push 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.910
 do not 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.000
 now 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.940
 yes
