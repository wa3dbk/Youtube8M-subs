00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:48.020 
drill bit okay now it's not imperative

00:00:48.020 --> 00:01:08.649 
drill bit okay now it's not imperative
so<00:00:49.020> you<00:00:49.079> just<00:00:49.289> get<00:00:49.410> an<00:00:49.500> eyeball<00:00:49.950> Center<00:00:50.579> okay

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:08.659 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:11.389 

all<00:01:09.659> right<00:01:09.899> now<00:01:10.680> what<00:01:10.829> I've<00:01:10.920> done<00:01:10.950> is<00:01:11.130> I've

00:01:11.389 --> 00:01:11.399 
all right now what I've done is I've

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:12.980 
all right now what I've done is I've
drilled<00:01:11.700> all<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:11.969> way<00:01:12.090> through<00:01:12.420> this<00:01:12.630> piece

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
drilled all the way through this piece

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.840 
drilled all the way through this piece
and<00:01:13.289> just<00:01:14.219> tagged<00:01:15.170> the<00:01:16.170> table<00:01:16.560> leg<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:17.579> only

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
and just tagged the table leg the only

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.539 
and just tagged the table leg the only
difficult<00:01:18.810> part<00:01:18.869> about<00:01:19.350> this<00:01:19.590> is<00:01:19.860> you<00:01:20.039> want<00:01:20.369> to

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
difficult part about this is you want to

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.679 
difficult part about this is you want to
tag<00:01:21.149> right<00:01:21.600> into<00:01:22.289> the<00:01:23.280> corner<00:01:23.759> which<00:01:24.270> makes<00:01:24.570> it

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
tag right into the corner which makes it

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.569 
tag right into the corner which makes it
really<00:01:24.840> difficult<00:01:25.140> so<00:01:25.950> normally<00:01:26.280> what<00:01:26.399> I<00:01:26.460> do

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:26.579 
really difficult so normally what I do

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:30.399 
really difficult so normally what I do
is<00:01:26.789> just<00:01:27.149> with<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.390> drill<00:01:27.750> I'll<00:01:28.710> just<00:01:29.490> tag<00:01:30.299> it

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409 
is just with the drill I'll just tag it

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:32.990 
is just with the drill I'll just tag it
just<00:01:31.409> hit<00:01:31.590> it<00:01:31.619> make<00:01:31.950> a<00:01:31.979> mark<00:01:32.310> with<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.759> drill

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
just hit it make a mark with the drill

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.830 
just hit it make a mark with the drill
bit<00:01:33.240> so<00:01:33.840> I<00:01:33.869> know<00:01:34.020> at<00:01:34.829> least<00:01:35.429> the<00:01:35.789> height<00:01:36.000> okay

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
bit so I know at least the height okay

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.010 
bit so I know at least the height okay
then<00:01:37.170> I<00:01:37.229> take<00:01:37.409> my<00:01:37.590> table<00:01:37.950> leg<00:01:38.100> out<00:01:38.689> hold<00:01:39.689> it<00:01:39.929> up

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
then I take my table leg out hold it up

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.589 
then I take my table leg out hold it up
as<00:01:40.140> best<00:01:40.170> I<00:01:40.530> can

00:01:41.589 --> 00:01:41.599 
as best I can

00:01:41.599 --> 00:01:48.960 
as best I can
drill<00:01:42.599> right<00:01:42.840> into<00:01:42.869> that<00:01:43.229> hole<00:01:44.069> I<00:01:44.130> started

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:48.970 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.870 

all<00:01:49.540> right<00:01:50.190> boom<00:01:51.190> that<00:01:51.460> I<00:01:51.490> have<00:01:51.610> a<00:01:51.640> hole<00:01:51.850> that

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880
