I'm<00:00:27.680> not<00:00:27.890> too<00:00:28.189> clear<00:00:28.430> on<00:00:28.579> this<00:00:28.700> one<00:00:28.910> myself

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:30.410 
I'm not too clear on this one myself

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.240 
I'm not too clear on this one myself
it's<00:00:30.800> a<00:00:30.950> logger<00:00:31.250> that<00:00:31.489> sort<00:00:32.270> of<00:00:32.360> combines<00:00:33.250> some

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:34.250 
it's a logger that sort of combines some

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.250 
it's a logger that sort of combines some
of<00:00:34.370> the<00:00:34.489> aspects<00:00:35.090> of<00:00:35.239> a<00:00:35.329> logger<00:00:35.719> and<00:00:35.750> a<00:00:35.899> pilsner

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.260 
of the aspects of a logger and a pilsner

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.970 
of the aspects of a logger and a pilsner
and<00:00:37.329> sounds<00:00:38.329> kind<00:00:38.539> of<00:00:38.600> fishy<00:00:38.780> to<00:00:38.960> me<00:00:39.079> cuz<00:00:39.469> pill

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:39.980 
and sounds kind of fishy to me cuz pill

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:41.680 
and sounds kind of fishy to me cuz pill
stirs<00:00:40.219> and<00:00:40.370> lagers<00:00:40.760> aren't<00:00:41.089> really<00:00:41.510> all<00:00:41.539> that

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:41.690 
stirs and lagers aren't really all that

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.150 
stirs and lagers aren't really all that
different<00:00:42.350> they're<00:00:42.530> essentially<00:00:42.800> the<00:00:43.010> same

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:43.160 
different they're essentially the same

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.400 
different they're essentially the same
kind<00:00:43.370> of<00:00:43.550> thing<00:00:43.730> so<00:00:44.149> I'll<00:00:44.960> take<00:00:45.140> your<00:00:45.289> word<00:00:45.379> for

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.410 
kind of thing so I'll take your word for

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.869 
kind of thing so I'll take your word for
whatever<00:00:45.890> perhaps<00:00:46.670> I'm<00:00:46.969> not<00:00:47.390> as<00:00:48.050> well<00:00:48.739> up<00:00:49.670> to

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:49.879 
whatever perhaps I'm not as well up to

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:54.849 
whatever perhaps I'm not as well up to
snuff<00:00:50.120> on<00:00:50.449> the<00:00:51.140> subtleties<00:00:52.719> and<00:00:53.719> then<00:00:54.079> he<00:00:54.230> at

00:00:54.849 --> 00:00:54.859 
snuff on the subtleties and then he at

00:00:54.859 --> 00:00:57.069 
snuff on the subtleties and then he at
any<00:00:55.069> rate<00:00:55.309> apparently<00:00:55.909> this<00:00:56.059> is<00:00:56.269> a<00:00:56.569> much<00:00:56.809> more

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:57.079 
any rate apparently this is a much more

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:00.910 
any rate apparently this is a much more
cleaner<00:00:57.499> clearer<00:00:58.010> kind<00:00:58.370> of<00:00:58.460> beer<00:00:59.800> with<00:01:00.800> the

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
cleaner clearer kind of beer with the

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.520 
cleaner clearer kind of beer with the
lager<00:01:01.159> style<00:01:01.670> and<00:01:02.109> apparently<00:01:03.109> it's<00:01:03.289> much

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
lager style and apparently it's much

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.680 
lager style and apparently it's much
more<00:01:03.710> biscuity<00:01:04.220> tasting<00:01:04.699> okay<00:01:06.159> da<00:01:07.159> B<00:01:07.520> is<00:01:07.790> one

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:08.690 
more biscuity tasting okay da B is one

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:11.170

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:22.160 
first thing that attracted to me was

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.010
