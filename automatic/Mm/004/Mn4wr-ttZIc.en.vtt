00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:09.150
 Tell me more, a good game here. 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:16.590
 wheel in pcs weak and this time is the game 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:23.820
 the face of a very good game and fps 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:26.849
 I'm shooting it right now, I'm going 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.270
 show you how it works on pc 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:33.890
 weak 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:36.470
 Personal beauty is the beginning of the game, right? 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:40.270
 Here I can choose to play vincade here. 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:40.270
 that I will not even choose to remove 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:49.010
 here I have completed some missions there 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:51.379
 here in the inventory you can be 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.989
 Here are some things you should try 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:57.800
 weapons for example can be marine 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:01:00.170
 can be a medical engineer and snape 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.880
 I liked being a doctor because 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:05.330
 comes with a 12 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:08.530
 and then I think it's cool, the Marine comes 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:13.810
 here with a rifle, I think the rifle 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:16.759
 that can take more from far and here the 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:22.340
 engineer does not even come with these guns here 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:24.670
 a pistol and a machine gun and the 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:28.990
 team crisis 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:32.920
 I come here with the snip and a pistol 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:37.399
 Is the rifle there and a gun? 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:40.369
 here I choose doctor and here in refuge 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:43.270
 after testing the game how're not 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:43.270
 You voters here? 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:57.790
 beauty 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:02:01.270
 so that's where this game runs on my pc in 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:03.790
 settings from 800 to 600 in the 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:07.540
 resolution of 800 by 600 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:10.030
 the chart is down because the 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:12.640
 my pc can not handle it on the graph 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:16.230
 top right that this game has a chart is 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:19.090
 a little good is not that business of the 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:22.450
 playstation 3 I think 14 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:26.170
 but his chart is good because she 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:29.550
 being online anyway is good and I liked it 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:31.630
 enough of the game or if it was not for the 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:34.780
 fps is low 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:36.160
 no more would be even better to do what 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.320
 huh 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:42.100
 have to play if you have to play 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:45.880
 this way he and those who do not know the 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:52.330
 my processor is an intel core intel 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:55.600
 dual core 2.3 ghz ram memory of 3 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:58.810
 gigabytes and video memory is a donkey 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:01.900
 of 64 mega bytes does not have a 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:05.260
 video is a notebook is running this 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:08.500
 game in 800 by 600 and in the graphics 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:12.420
 low beauty, that's it, oh you 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.420
 You can have a pistol here. 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:29.860
 in training here and not here're 12 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:31.630
 doctor 13 fps 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:34.090
 Maybe I do not think I was recording. 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:37.420
 with rap 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:40.569
 maybe got about 15 or so good 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:44.110
 but who has a larger video memory 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:48.310
 that my grandson had a romance rains 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:51.100
 about 250 or whatever without something 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:53.470
 bigger than 60 and 4 megs will already play 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:56.950
 This game is better than you guys are 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:04:03.130
 seeing it now it will run with a good 20 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:05.650
 30 fps and at higher resolution maybe 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:07.450
 but that's it folks and that part still 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:10.480
 It's smoother, huh? 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:13.989
 this part is more wrong, but then 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:16.120
 This is what liked the video and this tip 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:18.790
 do not forget to click like 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:23.070
 It's giving a force and in the video then 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:23.070
 and that's what it said
