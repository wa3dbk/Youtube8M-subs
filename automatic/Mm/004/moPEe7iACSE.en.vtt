00:00:01.669 --> 00:00:07.589
 hi today I'll show you how to 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.150
 install process on a 775 chipset 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.010
 we have such a mother 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.960
 she's pretty old already 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.350
 in use 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:18.470
 she has long since gone away 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.300
 its because I do not use it 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:24.090
 old iron I've already updated it just 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:27.390
 lay so let's say it can be said even in 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.279
 closet and she just given me now 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.320
 I do n’t need a moment at all I don’t know what 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.399
 do them and decided to take off and take off 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.160
 show you how to install 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.079
 775 chipset processor 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.489
 the first thing you can do it 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.739
 open the clamp which presses 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:45.899
 processor to the motherboard and to themselves 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:49.379
 we have the nest itself 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.480
 The processor is Intel's processors 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.910
 Well, of course there is a Japanese Intel 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.940
 775 chipset 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:59.640
 e 530 in my opinion I don't remember exactly 26 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.850
 gigahertz dual core it already too 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.519
 he sat down and he work whose well I just eat 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.560
 no longer enjoy 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:10.530
 us as you see the first thing we need 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.659
 make it find a triangle at the very 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.150
 the processor here it is here in 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.670
 the corner and again you see the camera is not in others 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.590
 the angles of such triangles are gone and find 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.830
 same triangle on the very 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:27.240
 motherboard you probably very 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:29.610
 very hard to see but he is here he is I 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.500
 I know that here we have it of course 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.479
 not visible because it is not marked 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.490
 he's just a plastic small cut 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.380
 It looks like a triangle and on it 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.390
 navigate how you leave yourself 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.950
 processor well of course you make no mistake 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.259
 you can not processor too the first time 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.000
 enter in is easy even if you do not find 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.920
 this triangle let the motherboard 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.380
 on the processor you must navigate 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.970
 here under this here is the connector on the sides they 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.759
 will give you the wrong insert and and 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.200
 so just look what through 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.810
 dig it let 's say there are sides 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.880
 sockets and on the processor itself so much easier 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.479
 will navigate and paste itself 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.689
 CPU 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:06.270
 he should go in easily and not 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:08.650
 need to exert no effort now 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:12.110
 take 

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:14.600
 close the clamp itself and clamp not 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.820
 be afraid to click on this one 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.480
 lever it is designed to pressure nothing 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.520
 he won't be with him 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.550
 then we will need to install a cooler 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:25.160
 since there is such a cooler by the way 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.960
 for there was to be such a nuance that every 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.310
 times when you shoot and put a cooler you 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:31.370
 should preferably change the thermal grease 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.900
 because its quality deteriorates and even 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.730
 if you have an old tiger paste for 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.640
 prevention is better or changed because 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.920
 as satire heat transfer deteriorates in 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.750
 depending on the term just thermal grease 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.880
 starts to dry out 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:46.040
 here we will install such a standard cooler 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:49.250
 It is mounted on conventional rifles 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.330
 mounts most plus of such mounts then 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.770
 that they are verbally from all sides 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:55.310
 symmetrical that is, you can install 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:58.340
 whatever you like and i will know him 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:00.980
 counting from the length of the wire itself 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.410
 cooler since install so cooler 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.870
 never bothered me anywhere else 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:10.160
 I put it probably here and here 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:12.260
 here we are slot all in advance everything fits we 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:21.190
 we press it and we clamp diagono on 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:21.190
 diagonal clamps in the first 2 first so 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:32.490
 I apologize for a lot of time 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:35.520
 and everything is fine, he was already clamped 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:40.710
 continue on diagonal 2 and now you can 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:42.180
 clamp everything else everything we have everything 

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:42.840
 the last remaining here 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.210
 power supply 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.070
 and food, too, submits easily here as 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:49.380
 see the guide rail which again 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:53.160
 he will not give a mistake here with us 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:55.920
 here is the connector and you just insert 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.570
 there is pretty nothing difficult in 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.400
 Generally the site was women subscribe 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:02.570
 stavte Like maybe someone is able to 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.570
 to be useful and in general for now
