00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.250 
hello everybody this is Emma from

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.999 
hello everybody this is Emma from
graphics<00:00:02.939> media<00:00:03.300> production<00:00:04.049> and<00:00:04.410> today<00:00:04.830> we

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
graphics media production and today we

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:07.760 
graphics media production and today we
are<00:00:05.100> going<00:00:05.279> to<00:00:05.400> create<00:00:05.730> the<00:00:06.480> rings<00:00:06.750> like<00:00:07.290> these

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
are going to create the rings like these

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.759 
are going to create the rings like these
in<00:00:08.160> cinema<00:00:09.150> 4d<00:00:09.540> and<00:00:10.160> those<00:00:11.160> rings<00:00:11.460> are

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:12.769 
in cinema 4d and those rings are

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:18.340 
in cinema 4d and those rings are
animated<00:00:13.769> and<00:00:13.980> they<00:00:14.549> are<00:00:14.849> looking<00:00:15.450> like<00:00:15.690> this

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:18.350 
animated and they are looking like this

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:23.750 
animated and they are looking like this
and<00:00:19.350> this<00:00:20.900> is<00:00:21.900> exactly<00:00:22.350> what<00:00:23.160> we<00:00:23.310> are<00:00:23.340> going<00:00:23.460> to

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
and this is exactly what we are going to

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.070 
and this is exactly what we are going to
learn<00:00:24.170> and<00:00:25.170> this<00:00:25.410> is<00:00:25.710> what<00:00:26.580> we<00:00:26.910> have<00:00:27.150> created

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
learn and this is what we have created

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:37.750 
learn and this is what we have created
in<00:00:28.680> this<00:00:28.830> tutorial<00:00:29.779> so<00:00:30.779> let's<00:00:31.470> get<00:00:31.710> started

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.759 

so<00:00:38.760> first<00:00:39.390> at<00:00:39.539> all<00:00:39.659> we<00:00:39.929> want<00:00:40.109> to<00:00:40.170> add<00:00:40.379> a<00:00:40.409> circle

00:00:40.759 --> 00:00:40.769 
so first at all we want to add a circle

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:43.939 
so first at all we want to add a circle
and<00:00:41.359> we<00:00:42.359> can<00:00:42.570> change<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:43.050> radius<00:00:43.409> if<00:00:43.680> you<00:00:43.769> want

00:00:43.939 --> 00:00:43.949 
and we can change the radius if you want

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:48.020 
and we can change the radius if you want
to<00:00:44.129> and<00:00:45.019> then<00:00:46.019> we<00:00:46.170> want<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:46.440> add<00:00:46.530> a<00:00:47.129> rectangle

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
to and then we want to add a rectangle

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.529 
to and then we want to add a rectangle
and<00:00:48.629> we<00:00:48.870> want<00:00:49.109> width<00:00:49.710> to<00:00:50.100> be<00:00:50.280> thinner<00:00:50.609> than<00:00:51.390> the

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
and we want width to be thinner than the

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.279 
and we want width to be thinner than the
height<00:00:51.780> so<00:00:52.350> maybe<00:00:52.559> 50<00:00:53.129> for<00:00:53.309> example<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:54.289> then

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
height so maybe 50 for example and then

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.160 
height so maybe 50 for example and then
we<00:00:55.409> want<00:00:55.589> to<00:00:55.680> add<00:00:55.890> a<00:00:55.920> sweep<00:00:56.609> and<00:00:56.850> nurbs<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:57.479> we

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
we want to add a sweep and nurbs and we

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.380 
we want to add a sweep and nurbs and we
want<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:58.469> place<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.920> rectangle<00:00:59.180> below<00:01:00.180> the

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
want to place the rectangle below the

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.929 
want to place the rectangle below the
sweeteners<00:01:00.869> and<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.680> circle<00:01:02.250> below<00:01:02.760> the

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:02.939 
sweeteners and the circle below the

00:01:02.939 --> 00:01:06.070 
sweeteners and the circle below the
rectangle<00:01:03.510> and<00:01:03.719> this<00:01:04.470> will<00:01:04.649> form<00:01:05.009> our<00:01:05.339> ring

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080 
rectangle and this will form our ring

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.840 
rectangle and this will form our ring
and<00:01:07.080> now<00:01:07.259> if<00:01:07.440> you<00:01:07.560> want<00:01:07.800> to<00:01:08.039> you<00:01:08.190> can<00:01:08.460> change

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
and now if you want to you can change

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.120 
and now if you want to you can change
the<00:01:09.149> radius<00:01:09.569> of<00:01:09.929> the<00:01:10.080> circle<00:01:10.350> if<00:01:10.619> you<00:01:10.740> want<00:01:10.950> it

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
the radius of the circle if you want it

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.639 
the radius of the circle if you want it
to<00:01:11.250> be<00:01:11.399> smaller<00:01:13.369> or<00:01:14.630> in<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.750> rectangle<00:01:16.350> we<00:01:16.470> can

00:01:16.639 --> 00:01:16.649 
to be smaller or in the rectangle we can

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:18.590 
to be smaller or in the rectangle we can
change<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:17.009> width<00:01:17.250> if<00:01:17.610> you<00:01:17.789> want<00:01:18.060> it<00:01:18.299> to<00:01:18.479> be

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
change the width if you want it to be

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.800 
change the width if you want it to be
thicker<00:01:18.929> or<00:01:19.380> thinner<00:01:21.709> I'm<00:01:22.709> going<00:01:23.009> to<00:01:23.159> stay<00:01:23.369> on

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
thicker or thinner I'm going to stay on

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:29.120 
thicker or thinner I'm going to stay on
45<00:01:24.810> weight<00:01:25.560> and<00:01:25.860> at<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:27.000> height<00:01:27.240> if<00:01:27.869> you<00:01:28.130> want

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
45 weight and at the height if you want

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.340 
45 weight and at the height if you want
to<00:01:29.369> make<00:01:29.610> it<00:01:29.759> like<00:01:30.890> longer<00:01:31.890> or<00:01:32.190> shorter<00:01:33.350> I'm

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
to make it like longer or shorter I'm

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.950 
to make it like longer or shorter I'm
going<00:01:34.619> to<00:01:34.740> stay<00:01:34.950> with<00:01:35.030> 400<00:01:36.950> so<00:01:38.180> now<00:01:39.180> we<00:01:39.630> want<00:01:39.840> to

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
going to stay with 400 so now we want to

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.219 
going to stay with 400 so now we want to
add<00:01:40.250> cloner<00:01:41.250> so<00:01:41.640> we're<00:01:41.789> going<00:01:41.939> to<00:01:42.090> mograph<00:01:42.780> and

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
add cloner so we're going to mograph and

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.899 
add cloner so we're going to mograph and
cloner<00:01:43.979> and<00:01:44.359> we<00:01:45.359> placing<00:01:45.719> the<00:01:46.170> sweepnurbs

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:46.909 
cloner and we placing the sweepnurbs

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:51.410 
cloner and we placing the sweepnurbs
sweepnurbs<00:01:48.049> below<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.259> cloner<00:01:50.149> and<00:01:51.149> as<00:01:51.329> you

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
sweepnurbs below the cloner and as you

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.630 
sweepnurbs below the cloner and as you
can<00:01:51.539> see<00:01:51.750> it<00:01:52.189> was<00:01:53.270> creating<00:01:54.270> three<00:01:54.840> rings<00:01:55.320> here

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
can see it was creating three rings here

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.249 
can see it was creating three rings here
we<00:01:56.640> go<00:01:56.789> to<00:01:56.850> clone<00:01:57.240> earth<00:01:57.420> and<00:01:57.659> we<00:01:57.719> can<00:01:57.929> change

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
we go to clone earth and we can change

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.289 
we go to clone earth and we can change
this<00:01:58.500> one<00:01:58.740> if<00:01:58.950> you<00:01:59.130> want<00:01:59.280> to<00:01:59.340> I'm<00:01:59.909> going<00:02:00.179> to

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
this one if you want to I'm going to

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.899 
this one if you want to I'm going to
keep<00:02:00.570> it<00:02:00.780> on<00:02:00.960> free<00:02:01.229> well<00:02:02.009> as<00:02:02.219> you<00:02:02.340> can<00:02:02.429> see<00:02:02.490> in

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
keep it on free well as you can see in

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.020 
keep it on free well as you can see in
the<00:02:03.240> y-axis<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.439> position<00:02:05.039> has<00:02:05.249> changed<00:02:05.280> it

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
the y-axis the position has changed it

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.009 
the y-axis the position has changed it
changed<00:02:07.250> so<00:02:08.250> we<00:02:08.280> go<00:02:08.549> down<00:02:08.850> to<00:02:09.030> the<00:02:09.119> position<00:02:09.690> Y

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:10.019 
changed so we go down to the position Y

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:13.550 
changed so we go down to the position Y
here<00:02:10.380> and<00:02:10.640> change<00:02:11.640> it<00:02:11.760> to<00:02:11.910> zero<00:02:12.209> and<00:02:12.720> now<00:02:13.290> all

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
here and change it to zero and now all

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:20.300 
here and change it to zero and now all
these<00:02:13.890> three<00:02:16.579> circles<00:02:17.870> rings<00:02:18.870> are<00:02:19.200> staying<00:02:20.100> in

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
these three circles rings are staying in

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.180 
these three circles rings are staying in
the<00:02:20.430> same<00:02:20.459> place<00:02:21.109> but<00:02:22.109> we<00:02:22.380> want<00:02:22.620> them<00:02:22.799> to<00:02:22.829> grow

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
the same place but we want them to grow

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.030 
the same place but we want them to grow
out<00:02:23.519> so<00:02:24.239> we<00:02:24.390> want<00:02:24.600> to<00:02:24.750> change<00:02:25.019> this<00:02:25.230> scale<00:02:25.680> and

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
out so we want to change this scale and

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.110 
out so we want to change this scale and
we<00:02:26.640> got<00:02:26.819> scale<00:02:27.480> here<00:02:27.810> scale<00:02:28.410> x<00:02:28.769> and<00:02:29.190> y<00:02:29.579> we<00:02:29.880> want

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
we got scale here scale x and y we want

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:36.819 
we got scale here scale x and y we want
to<00:02:30.239> change<00:02:30.709> so<00:02:33.049> 120<00:02:34.049> we<00:02:34.200> can<00:02:34.410> change<00:02:34.680> them<00:02:34.920> too

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:36.829 
to change so 120 we can change them too

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:39.440 
to change so 120 we can change them too
so<00:02:37.829> now<00:02:37.980> as<00:02:38.160> you<00:02:38.190> can<00:02:38.310> see<00:02:38.430> they<00:02:38.790> got<00:02:39.180> some

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
so now as you can see they got some

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.850 
so now as you can see they got some
space<00:02:39.840> between<00:02:40.139> here<00:02:40.650> and<00:02:42.349> well<00:02:43.349> to<00:02:43.739> add

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
space between here and well to add

down the command button and then you

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.850 
down the command button and then you
just<00:03:14.700> drag<00:03:14.880> it<00:03:15.030> down<00:03:15.620> to<00:03:16.620> create<00:03:16.890> a<00:03:16.970> copy<00:03:17.970> of<00:03:18.210> it

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860 
just drag it down to create a copy of it

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.740 
just drag it down to create a copy of it
but<00:03:19.860> as<00:03:19.980> you<00:03:20.010> can<00:03:20.220> see<00:03:20.280> this<00:03:20.730> one<00:03:21.030> didn't<00:03:21.480> go

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
but as you can see this one didn't go

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.850 
but as you can see this one didn't go
into<00:03:22.020> the<00:03:22.260> cloner<00:03:22.530> and<00:03:22.860> it<00:03:22.980> has<00:03:23.490> to<00:03:23.730> go<00:03:24.680> so<00:03:25.680> we

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
into the cloner and it has to go so we

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.780 
into the cloner and it has to go so we
just<00:03:26.010> drag<00:03:26.670> it<00:03:26.790> up<00:03:27.320> under<00:03:28.320> below<00:03:29.220> the<00:03:29.640> other

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.500 
just drag it up under below the other
sweet<00:03:30.270> nerves<00:03:30.570> so<00:03:31.170> it<00:03:31.290> looks<00:03:31.500> like<00:03:31.590> this<00:03:32.510> so

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
sweet nerves so it looks like this so

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:36.890 
now we can add a new material oops

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:44.770 
now we can add a new material oops
and<00:03:38.270> we<00:03:39.270> can<00:03:39.830> change<00:03:40.830> it<00:03:41.390> change<00:03:42.390> the<00:03:42.690> color

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780

and we can change it change the color
add<00:03:45.780> it<00:03:46.050> to<00:03:46.230> the<00:03:46.380> other<00:03:46.980> sweepnurbs<00:03:47.550> so<00:03:48.240> now

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
add it to the other sweepnurbs so now

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.560 
add it to the other sweepnurbs so now
you<00:03:48.450> can<00:03:48.720> see<00:03:48.870> we<00:03:49.170> got<00:03:49.610> white<00:03:50.610> and<00:03:50.970> then<00:03:51.330> red

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:51.570 
you can see we got white and then red

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:55.280 
you can see we got white and then red
you<00:03:52.440> can<00:03:52.590> delete<00:03:52.860> this<00:03:53.040> one<00:03:53.990> well<00:03:54.990> it<00:03:55.110> doesn't

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
you can delete this one well it doesn't

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.910 
you can delete this one well it doesn't
really<00:03:55.440> matter<00:03:55.800> so<00:03:56.780> we<00:03:57.780> can<00:03:58.020> also<00:03:58.350> change<00:03:58.680> this

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
really matter so we can also change this

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.199 
really matter so we can also change this
color<00:03:59.280> you<00:03:59.550> can<00:03:59.790> just<00:03:59.940> keep<00:04:00.180> on<00:04:00.450> adding

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:02.209 
color you can just keep on adding

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:09.020 
color you can just keep on adding
materials<00:04:03.209> and<00:04:05.630> add<00:04:06.630> them<00:04:07.430> we<00:04:08.430> make<00:04:08.610> a<00:04:08.640> copy

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
materials and add them we make a copy

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:18.949 
materials and add them we make a copy
again<00:04:10.370> and<00:04:12.380> place<00:04:13.380> it<00:04:13.590> below<00:04:14.570> and<00:04:17.840> put<00:04:18.840> the

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
again and place it below and put the

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:22.370 
again and place it below and put the
material<00:04:20.090> so<00:04:21.090> now<00:04:21.239> we<00:04:21.330> got<00:04:21.480> three<00:04:21.660> colors<00:04:22.140> you

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
material so now we got three colors you

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.430 
material so now we got three colors you
can<00:04:22.740> go<00:04:23.100> to<00:04:23.160> the<00:04:23.430> clonal<00:04:23.940> you<00:04:24.300> can<00:04:24.570> change<00:04:25.200> the

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
can go to the clonal you can change the

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.790 
can go to the clonal you can change the
count<00:04:26.060> to<00:04:27.060> even<00:04:27.540> more<00:04:27.720> and<00:04:27.990> as<00:04:28.230> you<00:04:28.380> can<00:04:28.590> see

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 
count to even more and as you can see

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:33.710 
count to even more and as you can see
they<00:04:29.220> are<00:04:29.490> repeating<00:04:31.700> so<00:04:32.700> well<00:04:32.910> I'm<00:04:33.150> is<00:04:33.390> going

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
they are repeating so well I'm is going

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.580 
they are repeating so well I'm is going
to<00:04:33.840> stay<00:04:34.050> too<00:04:34.110> free<00:04:34.680> for<00:04:35.040> this<00:04:35.220> example<00:04:35.790> and

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
to stay too free for this example and

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:39.050 
to stay too free for this example and
what<00:04:37.590> we<00:04:37.740> now<00:04:37.860> want<00:04:38.040> to<00:04:38.190> do<00:04:38.310> is<00:04:38.460> to<00:04:38.640> animate

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 
what we now want to do is to animate

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:43.220 
what we now want to do is to animate
those<00:04:40.070> so<00:04:41.070> in<00:04:41.400> the<00:04:41.610> sweepnurbs<00:04:41.940> we<00:04:42.660> can<00:04:42.870> find

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:43.230 
those so in the sweepnurbs we can find

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:46.250 
those so in the sweepnurbs we can find
it<00:04:43.410> in<00:04:43.530> the<00:04:44.100> growth<00:04:44.340> and<00:04:44.660> now<00:04:45.660> the<00:04:45.720> start

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:46.260 
it in the growth and now the start

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.190 
it in the growth and now the start
growth<00:04:46.560> and<00:04:46.860> and<00:04:47.190> the<00:04:47.340> growth<00:04:47.550> and<00:04:47.940> these<00:04:48.900> ones

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:49.200 
growth and and the growth and these ones

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:55.460 
growth and and the growth and these ones
are<00:04:50.060> changes<00:04:51.060> changing<00:04:52.790> the<00:04:54.050> value<00:04:55.050> here<00:04:55.260> and

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:55.470 
are changes changing the value here and

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:59.040 
are changes changing the value here and
these<00:04:56.100> are<00:04:56.610> going<00:04:56.940> to<00:04:57.090> be<00:04:57.390> a<00:04:57.419> keyframe

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050 
these are going to be a keyframe

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:03.779 
these are going to be a keyframe
so<00:04:59.860> we<00:05:00.160> can<00:05:00.460> keep<00:05:00.639> this<00:05:00.849> one<00:05:01.090> on<00:05:01.620> zero<00:05:02.620> which<00:05:03.610> it

00:05:03.779 --> 00:05:03.789 
so we can keep this one on zero which it

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:06.180 
so we can keep this one on zero which it
was<00:05:03.970> and<00:05:04.210> we<00:05:04.300> can<00:05:04.509> select<00:05:04.840> all<00:05:05.139> three<00:05:05.590> those<00:05:05.889> I

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:06.190 
was and we can select all three those I

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:09.559 
was and we can select all three those I
hold<00:05:07.090> down<00:05:07.270> shift<00:05:07.330> and<00:05:07.990> select<00:05:08.050> all<00:05:08.860> of<00:05:08.919> them

00:05:09.559 --> 00:05:09.569 
hold down shift and select all of them

00:05:09.569 --> 00:05:15.149 
hold down shift and select all of them
and<00:05:12.210> well<00:05:13.210> we<00:05:13.419> can<00:05:13.629> change<00:05:13.900> this<00:05:14.139> to<00:05:14.199> 50<00:05:14.889> first

00:05:15.149 --> 00:05:15.159 
and well we can change this to 50 first

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:17.580 
and well we can change this to 50 first
at<00:05:15.340> all<00:05:15.550> so<00:05:15.789> you've<00:05:16.060> got<00:05:16.360> the<00:05:16.599> half<00:05:16.900> of<00:05:17.229> them

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:17.590 
at all so you've got the half of them

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:21.050 
at all so you've got the half of them
showing<00:05:17.919> up<00:05:18.159> and<00:05:19.090> we<00:05:19.270> go<00:05:19.389> to<00:05:19.449> the<00:05:19.690> cloner<00:05:19.990> and

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060 
showing up and we go to the cloner and

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:25.610 
showing up and we go to the cloner and
here's<00:05:22.060> the<00:05:22.270> rotation<00:05:23.280> and<00:05:24.280> we<00:05:24.490> want<00:05:24.729> to

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:25.620 
here's the rotation and we want to

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:30.600 
here's the rotation and we want to
change<00:05:26.620> this<00:05:26.949> value<00:05:28.440> rotation<00:05:29.440> be<00:05:30.159> whatever

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:30.610 
change this value rotation be whatever

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:34.020 
change this value rotation be whatever
please<00:05:32.009> change<00:05:33.009> it<00:05:33.130> to<00:05:33.190> something<00:05:33.520> and<00:05:33.909> you

please change it to something and you

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:39.390 
please change it to something and you
will<00:05:34.300> see<00:05:34.509> that<00:05:35.500> we<00:05:35.710> got<00:05:35.919> another<00:05:36.340> sort<00:05:37.330> of<00:05:38.400> we

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:39.400 
will see that we got another sort of we

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.689 
will see that we got another sort of we
can<00:05:39.430> try<00:05:40.060> different<00:05:40.810> values<00:05:41.740> and<00:05:42.069> we<00:05:42.340> will<00:05:42.490> see

00:05:42.689 --> 00:05:42.699 
can try different values and we will see

00:05:42.699 --> 00:05:47.640 
can try different values and we will see
different<00:05:44.460> results<00:05:45.460> so<00:05:46.090> for<00:05:46.870> example<00:05:47.380> we<00:05:47.470> can

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:47.650 
different results so for example we can

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:53.189 
different results so for example we can
take<00:05:48.490> it<00:05:48.669> on<00:05:48.789> 60<00:05:49.860> and<00:05:51.150> we<00:05:52.150> go<00:05:52.300> back<00:05:52.539> to<00:05:52.810> it<00:05:53.020> all

00:05:53.189 --> 00:05:53.199 
take it on 60 and we go back to it all

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:57.209 
take it on 60 and we go back to it all
the<00:05:53.500> sweepnurbs<00:05:53.800> and<00:05:54.569> we<00:05:55.569> maybe<00:05:55.750> put<00:05:56.050> 0<00:05:56.710> in

00:05:57.209 --> 00:05:57.219 
the sweepnurbs and we maybe put 0 in

00:05:57.219 --> 00:06:00.629 
the sweepnurbs and we maybe put 0 in
both<00:05:57.669> of<00:05:58.030> them<00:05:58.270> so<00:05:59.110> nothing<00:05:59.530> is<00:05:59.680> showing<00:05:59.919> up<00:06:00.190> we

00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:00.639 
both of them so nothing is showing up we

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:04.999 
both of them so nothing is showing up we
are<00:06:00.819> on<00:06:01.000> the<00:06:01.240> frame<00:06:01.569> zero<00:06:02.789> put<00:06:03.789> a<00:06:03.849> keyframe<00:06:04.180> and

00:06:04.999 --> 00:06:05.009 
are on the frame zero put a keyframe and

00:06:05.009 --> 00:06:09.110 
are on the frame zero put a keyframe and
these<00:06:06.009> automatic<00:06:06.940> keyframes<00:06:07.690> something<00:06:08.500> and

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:09.120 
these automatic keyframes something and

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:12.089 
these automatic keyframes something and
we<00:06:10.120> place<00:06:10.389> this<00:06:10.630> one<00:06:10.870> to<00:06:11.409> the<00:06:11.530> end<00:06:11.800> of<00:06:11.979> the

00:06:12.089 --> 00:06:12.099 
we place this one to the end of the

00:06:12.099 --> 00:06:19.939 
we place this one to the end of the
timeline<00:06:12.400> and<00:06:13.380> we<00:06:14.380> add<00:06:14.610> this<00:06:15.610> one<00:06:15.909> to<00:06:16.150> 100<00:06:18.150> and

00:06:19.939 --> 00:06:19.949 
timeline and we add this one to 100 and

00:06:19.949 --> 00:06:22.890 
timeline and we add this one to 100 and
we<00:06:20.949> add<00:06:21.069> a<00:06:21.099> keyframe<00:06:21.490> there<00:06:21.880> and<00:06:22.270> then<00:06:22.569> we<00:06:22.750> used

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:22.900 
we add a keyframe there and then we used

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:28.800 
we add a keyframe there and then we used
to<00:06:23.169> stop<00:06:23.729> out<00:06:24.729> to<00:06:25.469> keyframe<00:06:26.469> and<00:06:27.569> now<00:06:28.569> when<00:06:28.779> we

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:28.810 
to stop out to keyframe and now when we

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:33.800 
to stop out to keyframe and now when we
scrub<00:06:29.380> through<00:06:29.409> this<00:06:29.830> we<00:06:30.219> can<00:06:30.430> see<00:06:30.729> that<00:06:31.389> it<00:06:32.110> is

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:33.810 
scrub through this we can see that it is

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:38.309 
scrub through this we can see that it is
animated<00:06:35.340> just<00:06:36.340> like<00:06:36.729> we<00:06:37.000> wanted<00:06:37.360> it<00:06:37.719> to<00:06:37.779> be<00:06:38.110> I

00:06:38.309 --> 00:06:38.319 
animated just like we wanted it to be I

00:06:38.319 --> 00:06:40.610 
animated just like we wanted it to be I
guess

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:40.620 
guess

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:46.019 
guess
so<00:06:41.620> now<00:06:41.889> we<00:06:42.460> can<00:06:42.699> maybe<00:06:43.479> even<00:06:43.870> add<00:06:44.770> more<00:06:45.130> into

00:06:46.019 --> 00:06:46.029 
so now we can maybe even add more into

00:06:46.029 --> 00:06:52.070 
so now we can maybe even add more into
this<00:06:46.180> one<00:06:46.539> and<00:06:47.490> it<00:06:48.490> just<00:06:48.520> keeps<00:06:49.240> on<00:06:49.509> animating

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:52.080 
this one and it just keeps on animating

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:55.980 
this one and it just keeps on animating
so<00:06:53.080> that's<00:06:53.500> for<00:06:54.430> this<00:06:54.969> tutorial<00:06:55.180> hope<00:06:55.840> you

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:55.990 
so that's for this tutorial hope you

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:58.350 
so that's for this tutorial hope you
