00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:32.000
 hello to all today i'm going to you 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:33.770
 present the assembly very badly the assembly 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.750
 stragglers and montages most 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.370
 performance but also with the method 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.210
 that I will introduce you the most 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.430
 simple to make 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.650
 it makes it possible to take the proofs are 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:45.379
 on the mouth at the bottom like red and 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:48.650
 the shadows there too the wary fish 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:51.860
 like the gilthead sea bream to make it 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:54.379
 so you will need a plan and well 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:58.969
 obviously you can take care a 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:01:00.320
 lead pyramid will implode points me 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:02.600
 I take the rap plan 1 it takes 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.780
 whether they are disengageable preferences 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:12.590
 to bring back more easily so that's it 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:13.990
 after a looter for angers mounting and 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:27.439
 the small material 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:31.869
 so it takes the same triple ray 

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:31.869
 also need a staple 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:50.350
 just the graph so I came back 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:55.560
 would like we did not know in the 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:59.560
 mounting so a hook staple so 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:04.710
 one of her husband's number 6 up 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:13.680
 number 2 0 me I take number 4 and 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:18.660
 4 beads microphones so therefore takes 4 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:23.020
 this is more a big pearl falsely 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:26.560
 a soft pearl this time the pickups 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:28.420
 lose are hard must be done 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.430
 Recent are more convenient for 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.920
 approve the fish to achieve the 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:36.640
 laggard you will need a son 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:39.430
 between 22 23 hundredths and 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.560
 up to 40 hundredths we use 28 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:45.340
 hundredths of the son of shimano the 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:49.420
 beastmaster needs at least who resists 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.160
 at 6 kg so the light of the system is 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:56.170
 everything is good 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:03:00.780
 well we will start editing so 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.780
 on this ring we enter the graph 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:09.540
 hop there can be affirmed 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:19.150
 once done we take the straggler 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:23.709
 so the straggler varies between 1 m 1 is 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:27.040
 vain and up to about 3 m so I 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:32.040
 take a good fifty meter 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:45.849
 centimeters saturday simon verdure 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:54.180
 I count so we will achieve a draw 1-1 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:54.180
 realized the universal no 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:07.060
 go around six or seven times on 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:07.060
 back in the loop 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:13.730
 we must always wet the knot so 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:16.580
 with a little saliva 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:18.200
 it will prevent the son because he 

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:21.100
 exists for these networks will not invite themselves 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.100
 that heats up and that gets damaged 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:29.600
 we will also let a little 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:30.980
 millimeter so that if the wire does not 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:35.510
 slide a little bit that they do not break 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:37.950
 we're not going to add the four now 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:41.190
 microphones pernes 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:43.030
 the pearls background so practical for the night 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:44.500
 if you want to know how to prevent 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:46.630
 a surf casting at night you can you 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:48.060
 go on the channel and watch the 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:50.350
 video 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:53.200
 the surf casting fishing techniques 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:59.500
 the night so now we attach 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:05:01.210
 the hook finally the same does put the the 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:03.430
 lesson is also important so I 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:05.640
 shot twice more so eight or 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:05.640
 new 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:25.140
 here I'm wetting a little bit with this 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:29.340
 book and that's it I cut the thread 

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:38.190
 and that's so it's done twenty two are 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:41.670
 and here I am with what are these practices 

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:44.190
 for flat fish these fish that 

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:45.240
 have the mouth in the back too but it 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:48.420
 will take all species 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:50.910
 we will usually put a beautiful one to a 

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:54.840
 nice stop nicole we can also 

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:57.720
 put a bug for america for them 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:58.950
 Mediterranean, we can also put a 

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:02.550
 small piece of sardines a small 

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:04.590
 piece of cuttlefish an American green and 

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:07.380
 all kinds of greens in fact and 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:12.750
 so the editing is complete all 

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:13.230
 just because you're going to see at 7 

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:16.370
 to graf 

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:16.370
 we add the lead 

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:26.780
 so here is the movie is the last to our 

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:29.990
 she will add after spending the 

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:33.170
 reel draper in the rings of the 

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:37.220
 can we will be able to put it 

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:44.300
 I take my reel we will be able 

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:49.240
 normally reset the digital word 

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:57.320
 32 years old between 35 and 45 hundredths 

00:06:49.240 --> 00:07:05.320
 because is it going a bit mans and 

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:07.610
 here we are testing reynard and here it is 

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:11.660
 I hope this little video you 

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:13.010
 will have helped for the exclusive photos of 

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:16.640
 our fishing parties you can you
