00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:10.052
 500 years ago 

00:00:10.093 --> 00:00:14.067
 It was possible to cross the oceans. 

00:00:16.085 --> 00:00:19.091
 Since the end of the last ice age, 

00:00:19.091 --> 00:00:23.059
 Merged agricultural companies with their neighbors, 

00:00:23.059 --> 00:00:27.068
 And populations within the continents of the world have become more alike. 

00:00:29.094 --> 00:00:34.053
 It was the time when many people began crossing the ocean. 

00:00:34.053 --> 00:00:36.069
 This caused the genetic and cultural differences 

00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:39.020
 Among the populations in the various continents - has narrowed, 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.043
 Though not gone. 

00:00:46.014 --> 00:00:49.007
 Many families emigrated voluntarily 

00:00:49.064 --> 00:00:50.080
 To new places. 

00:00:52.045 --> 00:00:54.003
 Or were exiled against their will 

00:00:55.006 --> 00:00:57.009
 To distant countries. 

00:00:59.077 --> 00:01:03.082
 Sometimes they found uninhabited land, 

00:01:05.072 --> 00:01:09.076
 But sometimes they came to settled places 

00:01:09.076 --> 00:01:12.013
 Where they were not welcomed. 

00:01:13.084 --> 00:01:17.044
 Sometimes they found land and work, 

00:01:17.044 --> 00:01:21.040
 And developed ways to take advantage of both. 

00:01:23.067 --> 00:01:25.092
 all over the world 

00:01:25.092 --> 00:01:29.038
 Humans were separated by tens of thousands of miles 

00:01:29.038 --> 00:01:30.096
 And for tens of thousands of years, 

00:01:30.096 --> 00:01:33.015
 They began to meet again 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:36.049
 And have children. 

00:01:38.046 --> 00:01:42.036
 Today, large areas, such as the Americas, 

00:01:42.036 --> 00:01:44.014
 Inhabited by humans 

00:01:44.014 --> 00:01:48.015
 Who can discover their historical roots on all continents. 

00:01:50.051 --> 00:01:52.072
 But small groups, 

00:01:52.072 --> 00:01:56.009
 Remained isolated both geographically and because of cultural differences, 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.023
 So they remained genetically unique. 

00:02:01.014 --> 00:02:05.028
 As distance transportation becomes more and more easy, 

00:02:05.028 --> 00:02:08.095
 And unique companies are becoming more diverse, 

00:02:08.095 --> 00:02:11.044
 A phenomenon of language disappearance appears. 

00:02:11.044 --> 00:02:16.008
 And reduction of genetic uniqueness around the world. 

00:02:18.018 --> 00:02:20.056
 But this genetic phenomenon 

00:02:20.056 --> 00:02:24.029
 Is relatively new. 

00:02:24.075 --> 00:02:27.079
 After all, we were not separated from each other for a very long time.
