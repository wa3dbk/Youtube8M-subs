00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:18.110
 I am here in front of the work of Valérie 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:20.770
 belin who is a very tall 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:24.380
 photographer whose all the work 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:25.700
 is to question the beauty is 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.610
 not just with this work that has 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.990
 chosen for the exhibition acquired by 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:33.410
 Bernard Magrez who was hit by 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.970
 lightning in front of this composition of 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.559
 flowers and portraits I'm going to 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.449
 to speak is also because all 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:40.449
 work and all the board of works everything 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:42.830
 the body of work of valérie belin 

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:44.720
 is interested in beauty at all 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:47.989
 beauties she even did a whole series 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.850
 of photos on bodybuilded bodies 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:51.950
 very strong men like that in a 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.860
 great violence and she shows this 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:57.260
 in a very poetic way and 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.149
 quite precise in his questioning about 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.719
 beauty so I said it's it 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:04.699
 is a composition of two photos 

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:08.030
 still lifes of the flowers of which we see 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:11.390
 the negative aspect of the flower on a 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:14.330
 model she chose the hairstyle is 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.200
 very important there is this perfection of 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.990
 the beauty 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.940
 this look she tried to freeze 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.400
 in a way that can be interpreted 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:25.400
 as a haughty or distant look 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:28.850
 poetic but very made up 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:31.970
 look at her mouth is like a top 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:34.909
 model and then you also see the 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:37.159
 necklace the pearl necklace so we 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:39.290
 also chooses to represent 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:40.880
 the whole exhibition because we 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.470
 found in this table 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.680
 finally all the ingredients 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.990
 I was going to say of the exhibition the beautiful 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.820
 and the beast 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:52.700
 so there is I told you these flowers 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:55.310
 still lifes still lifes that in 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.200
 the history of art is a motive since 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.270
 the night of time and that's the reason 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.850
 why there its flowers 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.010

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:07.390

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:10.990
 of his death from his 1999 suicide and 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:12.820
 found in this still life of 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:16.690
 bernard buffet in these flowers all his 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:19.810
 radicality the violence of the artist with 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:22.150
 its very black outlines which are the 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:25.600
 painter's signature in addition to his 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:27.670
 signature bernard buffet 1980 to 99 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.890
 flowers that are also found in 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:33.100
 the work of johan creten on this bust 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:35.430
 smells and 10 feminine made with with 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:38.800
 roses on an extremely 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:41.530
 fragile and is heavy and heavy the 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:44.200
 time we find in this pearl necklace 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:47.410
 there also in all the rooms its 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:50.410
 jewelery her headlights this makeup behind 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:53.290
 which expresses a whole whole at the 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.710
 times of social codes obviously in the 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.650
 reality 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:59.380
 and then in this staged by by 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.630
 artists this decoding that invites to 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:04.720
 a reflection on his jewelry is a 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:07.600
 regal street and ritual function 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.040
 perhaps also of his ornaments of his 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.600
 jewelery pearl necklaces found 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.130
 in the work of by the pj this 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.870
 accumulation of pearl necklaces that 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:17.400
 is called sisters williams fake forgiveness I 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:20.830
 am wrong or also in the last 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:23.650
 work of the exhibition photography 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:26.170
 from 2050 gold we see this big necklace of 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:28.239
 pearls on this woman in the middle of 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.830
 africa and asia this woman who 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:34.600
 represents this grace that represents 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:36.820
 on Europe with this wealth of 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:38.800
 represented by the pearl necklace 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:41.110
 and then at their feet these three 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:44.550
 thanks there are also you also find 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:47.440
 the flowers that are in in this 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:50.140
 composition so can recompose 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:52.840
 complex that he talks about this beauty 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:55.780
 but a beauty and questioning that 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:59.020
 and meditative contemplative and then who 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.190
 is extremely ultimately I was going to say 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:03.580
 violent but it's not necessarily 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:07.780
 violent which is extremely radical in 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:12.850
 its affirmation and that can be 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:16.600
 also considered as the evil is 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:18.400
 in this ambivalence of beauty in 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:21.100
 this ambivalent look that we can 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:23.500
 also bring on about beauty there 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:27.600
 finally the whole subject of the beautiful 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:30.040
 and the beast the beautiful you are and the beast 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:34.050
 like the text of paul ardenne in 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:34.050
 our catalog says
