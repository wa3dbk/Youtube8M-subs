Federer<00:02:26.150> so<00:02:27.150> Nadal<00:02:27.510> likes<00:02:27.780> to<00:02:27.959> beat<00:02:28.170> his

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
Federer so Nadal likes to beat his

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.740

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
opponents with that heavy topspin he

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.170 
opponents with that heavy topspin he
gets<00:02:31.020> the<00:02:31.200> ball<00:02:31.410> to<00:02:31.620> jump<00:02:31.950> up<00:02:32.160> really<00:02:32.640> high<00:02:32.850> and

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
gets the ball to jump up really high and

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.280 
gets the ball to jump up really high and
out<00:02:33.750> of<00:02:33.780> the<00:02:34.020> opponent's<00:02:34.709> comfort<00:02:35.580> zone<00:02:36.290> just

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
out of the opponent's comfort zone just

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.560 
out of the opponent's comfort zone just
like<00:02:37.470> Roger<00:02:37.739> Rafa<00:02:38.340> prefers<00:02:38.850> to<00:02:39.000> his<00:02:39.180> forehand

a phenomenal forehand is Juan Martin del
Potro<00:03:11.600> now<00:03:12.600> del<00:03:12.840> Potro<00:03:13.230> has<00:03:13.380> a<00:03:13.410> rather<00:03:13.799> a

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
unique swing with a relatively large

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:19.460 
unique swing with a relatively large
loop<00:03:16.890> which<00:03:17.549> I<00:03:17.790> do<00:03:17.850> not<00:03:18.239> recommend<00:03:18.660> you<00:03:18.959> copy

loop which I do not recommend you copy

loop which I do not recommend you copy
however<00:03:20.400> del<00:03:20.580> Potro<00:03:21.150> is<00:03:21.450> able<00:03:21.989> to<00:03:22.170> hit<00:03:22.350> winners

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
however del Potro is able to hit winners

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:24.710 
however del Potro is able to hit winners
with<00:03:23.040> his<00:03:23.220> forehand<00:03:23.640> from<00:03:23.910> anywhere<00:03:24.480> on<00:03:24.540> the

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
with his forehand from anywhere on the

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.039 
with his forehand from anywhere on the
court<00:03:24.840> and<00:03:25.640> he<00:03:26.640> likes<00:03:26.940> to<00:03:27.060> flatten<00:03:27.660> out<00:03:27.840> his

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
court and he likes to flatten out his

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:30.500 
court and he likes to flatten out his
forehand<00:03:28.680> which<00:03:29.310> really<00:03:29.700> suits<00:03:30.000> his<00:03:30.209> game

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
forehand which really suits his game

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.470 
forehand which really suits his game
because<00:03:30.720> he<00:03:31.170> is<00:03:31.230> a<00:03:31.290> taller<00:03:31.680> player<00:03:31.980> and

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
because he is a taller player and

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.030 
because he is a taller player and
movement<00:03:33.480> is<00:03:33.600> not<00:03:33.780> his<00:03:34.019> strength<00:03:34.290> so<00:03:34.739> it<00:03:34.860> makes

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
movement is not his strength so it makes

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.740 
movement is not his strength so it makes
a<00:03:35.160> lot<00:03:35.340> of<00:03:35.370> sense<00:03:35.700> for<00:03:35.880> him<00:03:36.030> to<00:03:36.060> flatten<00:03:36.690> out

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
a lot of sense for him to flatten out

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.789 
a lot of sense for him to flatten out
his<00:03:37.019> forehand<00:03:37.670> on<00:03:38.670> a<00:03:38.730> regular<00:03:39.150> basis<00:03:39.799> right

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 
his forehand on a regular basis right

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:43.039 
his forehand on a regular basis right
here<00:03:41.100> you<00:03:41.220> can<00:03:41.400> see<00:03:41.670> him<00:03:41.880> go<00:03:42.180> for<00:03:42.450> a<00:03:42.510> huge

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049 
here you can see him go for a huge

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:47.150 
here you can see him go for a huge
forehand<00:03:43.860> on<00:03:44.130> the<00:03:44.489> run

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160

conservative grip but she manages to

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.370
