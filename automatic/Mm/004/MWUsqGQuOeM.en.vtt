00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:10.880
 what will happen if you combine sony xperia z 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:13.160
 and xperia sp 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:15.889
 the company gave the answer by releasing 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.750
 recently a model called xperia z 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:19.519
 relatively compact unit with 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.900
 flagship indicators and increased 

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:22.820
 water and dust protection 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.010
 So we have a smartphone with 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.490
 xperia z features but less 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:28.009
 housing 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.929
 It looks like a device like this 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:32.420
 different types of plastic as a frame 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:34.399
 polyamide already familiar to us is used 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:37.129
 the back panel is pleasant to the touch 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:39.110
 matte plastic on the right side as well as 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:41.000
 Other sony devices of this year can 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.100
 find round metal button 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.980
 lock on volume control 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.020
 are under it there is another key 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.300
 camera control which does the job 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.949
 With photo modules it is much more convenient than 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.199
 when using on-screen buttons 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:56.030
 since the smartphone is water proof all 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:58.190
 connectors are located under the plugs 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.680
 top audio jack 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.930
 and on the right is a micro port and beat this 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.300
 stub is not necessary too often 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.820
 open on the case have placed also 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:10.370
 a couple of contacts to connect to 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.470
 special charger by the way 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.930
 this dock comes bundled saying 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.880
 that xperia z p is partly a model 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.890
 sp I meant the display 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:23.420
 here is the same screen with 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:25.070
 a diagonal of 4.6 inches and a resolution of 1280 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.590
 at 720 points 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.740
 he gives a juicy picture with a natural 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.730
 color rendering and does not blind in the sun 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.710
 traditionally to improve performance 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:36.050
 It uses software technology 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.750
 mobile bravia engine 2 but iron 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:41.120
 xperia z p got from xperia flagship 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.880
 z both of these devices are based on 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:45.830
 qualcomm snapdragon s4 pro chipset 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.630
 which includes 4 nuclear 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.660
 processor with a clock speed of one and a half 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:53.600
 gigahertz 2 gigabytes of RAM 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:55.550
 as well as adreno 320 graphics chip 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.650
 synthetic tests this configuration 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.720
 gaining a lot of points on 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.710
 level xperia z which, incidentally, is quite 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.540
 predictably 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.850
 but the time of the new device 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:07.940
 more than the flagship battery 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:09.649
 here is used the same at 2330 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.959
 milliampere hour but here's the screen 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.890
 he has no smaller diagonal 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:14.780
 full hd 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.030
 but just wait for it as a result 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.920
 an extra hour or even two autonomous 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.860
 work soni declares that the smartphone will 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.800
 work up to 470 hours standby 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:27.500
 and about forty five hours as 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.330
 music player and hold out until 13 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.819
 Talk time 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:34.070
 xperia z r from the flagship did not get 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:36.860
 only filling the battery but also 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:39.170
 the camera here is a 13 megapixel sensor 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.330
 ability to take hdr photos and 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.190
 full hd video in general 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.560
 standard set for good 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.870
 mobilography hardware release button 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.700
 shutter and water resistance allows 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.620
 easy to shoot underwater 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:55.010
 the device complies with the standard 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.780
 protection from water and dust and 58 first to 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.790
 gentle filling will not get the beach 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.130
 sand and secondly the device without damage 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.260
 can spend half an hour under water on 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:05.180
 depth and a half meters well controlled 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:08.329
 it's all natural operating 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.920
 android system version 41 securely and 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:12.620
 has all the necessary functions 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.120
 besides, the developers simply could not 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:17.269
 do not install here your brand 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.950
 shell timescape dormouse took almost everything 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:21.019
 the company has existing niches 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.690
 beautiful and powerful several flagship 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:25.519
 models easier but with an interesting design 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.950
 and now the most secure 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:30.079
 apparatus with top characteristics when 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:32.090
 this xperia z p is quite reasonable 

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:35.079
 money this and more in 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.079
 online store
