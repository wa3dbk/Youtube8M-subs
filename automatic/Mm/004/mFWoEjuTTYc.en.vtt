00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
we've got a dual core texas instruments

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.020 
we've got a dual core texas instruments
omap<00:01:41.420> 4430<00:01:42.649> processor<00:01:43.649> running<00:01:44.159> at<00:01:44.399> just<00:01:44.759> one

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
omap 4430 processor running at just one

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.870 
omap 4430 processor running at just one
gigahertz<00:01:45.360> I<00:01:46.040> and<00:01:47.040> that's<00:01:47.189> working<00:01:47.579> alongside

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
gigahertz I and that's working alongside

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.149 
gigahertz I and that's working alongside
one<00:01:48.810> gigabyte<00:01:49.200> of<00:01:49.409> RAM<00:01:49.649> so<00:01:51.259> it<00:01:52.259> seems<00:01:52.740> like<00:01:52.979> you

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
one gigabyte of RAM so it seems like you

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.639 
one gigabyte of RAM so it seems like you
don't<00:01:53.340> have<00:01:53.520> a<00:01:53.820> lot<00:01:54.299> of<00:01:54.479> power<00:01:54.750> but<00:01:55.020> actually

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
don't have a lot of power but actually

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
we'll open this up and then we can hold

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.580 
we'll open this up and then we can hold
the<00:02:12.900> Zoom<00:02:13.110> button

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
site so anyway you would think that you

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.650 
site so anyway you would think that you
know<00:02:23.069> that<00:02:23.459> combination<00:02:23.760> the<00:02:24.090> processor<00:02:24.569> in

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
know that combination the processor in

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.270 
know that combination the processor in
the<00:02:24.750> RAM<00:02:24.900> wouldn't<00:02:25.590> be<00:02:25.650> very<00:02:25.769> fast<00:02:26.099> but

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
the RAM wouldn't be very fast but

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.820 
the RAM wouldn't be very fast but
actually<00:02:26.700> you<00:02:26.940> know<00:02:27.030> swiping<00:02:27.569> through<00:02:27.830> home

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
actually you know swiping through home

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.330 
actually you know swiping through home
screens<00:02:29.190> is<00:02:29.489> fast<00:02:30.000> and<00:02:30.209> fluid<00:02:30.540> as<00:02:30.690> is<00:02:30.930> the<00:02:31.340> apps

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
screens is fast and fluid as is the apps

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.270 
screens is fast and fluid as is the apps
menu<00:02:32.610> I<00:02:33.090> so<00:02:33.720> you<00:02:33.810> really<00:02:34.080> won't<00:02:34.349> know<00:02:34.500> that<00:02:35.160> you

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
menu I so you really won't know that you

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.559 
menu I so you really won't know that you
don't<00:02:35.400> have<00:02:35.519> a<00:02:35.640> lot<00:02:35.760> of<00:02:35.879> power<00:02:36.090> under<00:02:36.360> the<00:02:36.450> hood

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
don't have a lot of power under the hood

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:38.360 
don't have a lot of power under the hood
the<00:02:37.110> only<00:02:37.260> real<00:02:37.410> problem<00:02:37.590> is<00:02:37.950> that<00:02:38.069> it<00:02:38.190> comes

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
the only real problem is that it comes

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.720 
the only real problem is that it comes
with<00:02:39.739> four<00:02:40.739> gigabytes<00:02:41.129> of<00:02:41.220> internal<00:02:41.400> storage

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
with four gigabytes of internal storage

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.360 
with four gigabytes of internal storage
which<00:02:42.150> goes<00:02:42.840> down<00:02:43.019> to<00:02:43.200> about<00:02:43.349> 1.6<00:02:43.980> gigabytes

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
which goes down to about 1.6 gigabytes

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.990 
which goes down to about 1.6 gigabytes
after<00:02:44.730> the<00:02:45.120> OS<00:02:45.510> and<00:02:46.010> the<00:02:47.010> pre-installed<00:02:47.610> apps

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
after the OS and the pre-installed apps

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.630 
after the OS and the pre-installed apps
are<00:02:48.209> accounted<00:02:48.569> for<00:02:48.599> so<00:02:49.280> you'll<00:02:50.280> definitely

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
are accounted for so you'll definitely

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.170 
are accounted for so you'll definitely
want<00:02:50.790> to<00:02:50.940> get<00:02:51.150> a<00:02:51.209> microSD<00:02:52.049> card<00:02:52.880> if<00:02:53.880> you're

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
with the online i don't think that the

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.830 
with the online i don't think that the
internal<00:03:04.920> memory<00:03:05.220> is<00:03:05.310> a<00:03:05.370> little<00:03:05.400> flat<00:03:06.030> but<00:03:06.299> at

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
internal memory is a little flat but at

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.930 
internal memory is a little flat but at
least<00:03:06.959> LG<00:03:07.379> included<00:03:07.799> a<00:03:07.829> microSD<00:03:08.370> slot<00:03:08.400> so<00:03:08.910> you

least LG included a microSD slot so you

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.830 
least LG included a microSD slot so you
can<00:03:09.690> expand<00:03:10.049> on<00:03:10.230> that<00:03:10.260> if<00:03:10.620> you<00:03:10.739> want<00:03:10.920> to<00:03:11.840> but
