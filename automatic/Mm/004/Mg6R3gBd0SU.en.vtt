00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:10.980
 youtube like this year I'm knight mary 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.480
 Welcome to this new video today 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.860
 I'm going to talk about a topic that I consider 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.230
 important and is playing video games 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.150
 while he's angry right now I'm going to 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.430
 concentrate on league of legends but 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.630
 can apply to any game I know that 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.640
 many of us have had those moments 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.980
 where we want to download our anger and 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.539
 frustration and we connect in lolo in 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.670
 some other game to be able to pass a 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.460
 good time and forget because we were 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.830
 angry and some people work them 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.360
 but others get even worse because 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:38.400
 when playing angry we are not 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.440
 concentrates and our game mode is 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.750
 more clumsy we throw ourselves into situations 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.180
 that normally we would not do we would enter 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.460
 alive Mexico and our judgment is 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.680
 cloudy you can not basically think 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.239
 clearly you are not able to put together good 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.420
 strategies and choose the best 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.590
 opportunities for you and your team 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.149
 now if we get into the games that 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.070
 they have a more competitive style 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.840
 example the classifications of lol and 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.579
 you are angry in this type of games 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.830
 believe me when I tell you that instead of 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.360
 do you are also hurting yourself 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.460
 more because you're letting your side 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.140
 emotional is involved and instead of 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.400
 of wanting to play for the satisfaction of 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.650
 win and have a good time with your 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.480
 happy two friends 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.340
 saying some cheerful little animals 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.990
 forest are you or when by the 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.880
 satisfaction of wanting to humiliate your 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.830
 rival you will be more aggressive with your 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.020
 companions at the moment someone 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.520
 tell you something either I do not know why you 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.290
 you are putting together such a thing because if such 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.480
 why did you make such a play or why 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.610
 What you have those team so ugly as this 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.920
 you will find and the insults towards 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.720
 the other people creating an environment 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.300
 hostile that will affect the performance of the 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.280
 team what will lead to a defeat and the 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.770
 losing points and lose place in the 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.750
 qualifying table but believe me what 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.700
 what will hurt you the most and give courage is the 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.260
 lose that game assuming that 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.300
 you had a very good run era are given 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:52.040
 if you were doing a butcher shop but 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.660
 for the same reason to be angry that 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.790
 defeat you will fall like a kick in 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:57.500
 your soft tissues and even worse if you had 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.910
 a performance so bad that you would like 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.050
 cover your face with the bag so that 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:02.150
 nobody can see your face of shame 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.830
 before the beating that someone has just 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:06.140
 age and then believe me when I tell you 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:08.179
 that nothing good will come out of playing 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.100
 while you were angry and it will bother you 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:11.810
 a hundred times more than what normally 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.930
 because at that point you're already wrong 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.550
 you can not think clearly I bet 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.780
 that many have passed the classifier 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.000
 is that by playing like that 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.010
 going down in rank and he was gathering every 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.510
 again and they will not be able to deny that 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.910
 when they got angry they sent everything very 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.250
 away and they did not care for a peanut what 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.170
 It happened in the game and simply 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.569
 they surrendered and started making tantrums 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.340
 motiv were children of three years I crossed 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:35.989
 Thursday and you're angry salt relax 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.940
 listen to music from a movie be able 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:40.430
 was your dog talk to your grandma what 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.140
 make it less play video games and if not 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.790
 believe me, do the test if one day 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.770
 they feel bad and they play like this they see their 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.900
 statistics and I bet they will have 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.370
 higher percentage of defeats and 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.050
 statistics with the champions that 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.480
 used they are not going to be so pretty that 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:55.070
