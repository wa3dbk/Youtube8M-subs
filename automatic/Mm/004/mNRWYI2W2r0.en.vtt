00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:12.839 
those and
and<00:02:11.230> I<00:02:11.319> had<00:02:11.500> a<00:02:11.530> whole<00:02:11.770> bunch<00:02:11.980> more<00:02:12.069> the<00:02:12.459> baking

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:12.849 
and I had a whole bunch more the baking

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:15.540 
and I had a whole bunch more the baking
cups<00:02:13.120> so<00:02:13.420> I<00:02:13.450> figured<00:02:13.870> I'd<00:02:14.020> get<00:02:14.830> up<00:02:15.099> get<00:02:15.400> on

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
cups so I figured I'd get up get on

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.059 
cups so I figured I'd get up get on
those<00:02:15.760> before<00:02:16.750> those<00:02:16.930> expire<00:02:17.440> here<00:02:17.770> next

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:18.069 
those before those expire here next

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:20.070 
those before those expire here next
month<00:02:18.370> so<00:02:18.640> I<00:02:18.670> use<00:02:19.030> the<00:02:19.209> rest<00:02:19.390> of<00:02:19.569> those<00:02:19.720> and

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
month so I use the rest of those and

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.040 
month so I use the rest of those and
those<00:02:20.620> ones<00:02:20.890> do<00:02:21.099> also<00:02:21.489> switch<00:02:22.150> you<00:02:22.300> to<00:02:22.330> for

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
those ones do also switch you to for

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.160 
those ones do also switch you to for
coupons<00:02:23.890> per<00:02:24.190> day<00:02:24.370> I<00:02:24.400> believe<00:02:24.810> so<00:02:25.810> I<00:02:25.870> did<00:02:26.050> have

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
coupons per day I believe so I did have

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.770 
coupons per day I believe so I did have
to<00:02:26.200> do<00:02:26.440> those<00:02:26.620> on<00:02:26.830> separate<00:02:27.190> days<00:02:27.220> so<00:02:28.150> with<00:02:28.660> the

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
to do those on separate days so with the

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.420 
to do those on separate days so with the
overage<00:02:29.140> that<00:02:29.260> I<00:02:29.319> got<00:02:29.530> from<00:02:29.680> the<00:02:29.830> Omni<00:02:30.190> in<00:02:30.340> the
