00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
share with you a little bit about the

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.680 
share with you a little bit about the
dangers<00:00:12.480> of<00:00:12.509> milk<00:00:13.280> again<00:00:14.280> we<00:00:15.059> get<00:00:15.389> a<00:00:15.420> lot<00:00:15.570> of

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
dangers of milk again we get a lot of

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.170 
dangers of milk again we get a lot of
press<00:00:15.990> about<00:00:16.440> milk<00:00:16.740> being<00:00:16.980> good<00:00:17.340> for<00:00:17.550> us<00:00:17.699> gives

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
press about milk being good for us gives

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.150 
press about milk being good for us gives
us<00:00:18.240> lots<00:00:18.420> of<00:00:18.510> calcium<00:00:18.890> helps<00:00:19.890> us<00:00:19.980> build

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
us lots of calcium helps us build

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.050 
us lots of calcium helps us build
healthy<00:00:20.640> strong<00:00:20.880> bones<00:00:21.150> and<00:00:21.560> strong<00:00:22.560> teeth

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:23.060 
healthy strong bones and strong teeth

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.859 
healthy strong bones and strong teeth
but<00:00:24.060> again<00:00:24.350> research<00:00:25.350> has<00:00:25.619> been<00:00:25.769> found<00:00:26.869> the

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
but again research has been found the

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.320 
but again research has been found the
opposite<00:00:28.349> finding<00:00:28.830> so<00:00:29.189> I<00:00:29.490> just<00:00:29.820> like<00:00:29.939> to<00:00:30.000> share

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
opposite finding so I just like to share

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.280 
opposite finding so I just like to share
with<00:00:30.449> you<00:00:30.859> something<00:00:31.859> about<00:00:32.130> that<00:00:33.170> first<00:00:34.170> of

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
with you something about that first of

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.819 
with you something about that first of
all<00:00:34.760> danger<00:00:35.760> number<00:00:35.940> one<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.899> pasteurization

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
all danger number one the pasteurization

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.280 
all danger number one the pasteurization
of<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.579> milk<00:00:38.790> so<00:00:39.030> that's<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.960> cooking

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
of the milk so that's the the cooking

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.319 
of the milk so that's the the cooking
process<00:00:40.500> that<00:00:41.070> kills<00:00:41.460> pretty<00:00:42.149> much

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
process that kills pretty much

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.270 
process that kills pretty much
everything<00:00:42.899> that's<00:00:43.079> within<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.649> milk<00:00:43.860> so<00:00:44.070> all

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
everything that's within the milk so all

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.459 
everything that's within the milk so all
the<00:00:44.460> all<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.480> minerals<00:00:45.840> all<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.110> vitamins

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
the all the minerals all the vitamins

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:47.990 
the all the minerals all the vitamins
that<00:00:46.680> might<00:00:46.860> be<00:00:47.010> in<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.190> milk<00:00:47.370> get<00:00:47.670> killed

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
that might be in the milk get killed

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.840 
that might be in the milk get killed
when<00:00:48.450> it's<00:00:48.870> cooked<00:00:49.260> in<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.190> pasteurization

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
when it's cooked in the pasteurization

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.369 
when it's cooked in the pasteurization
process<00:00:52.850> danger<00:00:53.850> number<00:00:54.059> two<00:00:54.329> there's<00:00:55.260> no

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
process danger number two there's no

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.729 
process danger number two there's no
doubt<00:00:55.649> there's<00:00:56.100> calcium<00:00:56.850> within<00:00:57.030> milk<00:00:57.739> but

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
doubt there's calcium within milk but

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.599 
doubt there's calcium within milk but
the<00:00:58.890> excessive<00:00:59.879> amounts<00:01:00.329> of<00:01:00.859> milk<00:01:01.859> interferes

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
the excessive amounts of milk interferes

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.060 
the excessive amounts of milk interferes
with<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:02.969> calcium<00:01:03.329> absorption<00:01:03.920> because<00:01:04.920> of

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
with the calcium absorption because of

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.710 
with the calcium absorption because of
the<00:01:05.250> high<00:01:05.430> amounts<00:01:05.760> of<00:01:05.850> lactose<00:01:06.360> which<00:01:06.689> is

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
the high amounts of lactose which is

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.190 
the high amounts of lactose which is
milk<00:01:07.560> sugar<00:01:08.000> basically<00:01:09.000> which<00:01:09.930> when<00:01:10.110> it

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
milk sugar basically which when it

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.010 
milk sugar basically which when it
breaks<00:01:10.350> down<00:01:10.530> in<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.799> body<00:01:10.979> breaks<00:01:11.729> down<00:01:11.909> to

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
breaks down in the body breaks down to

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:17.149 
breaks down in the body breaks down to
lactic<00:01:13.020> acid<00:01:14.390> so<00:01:15.390> it<00:01:15.780> uses<00:01:16.229> again<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.680> calcium

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
lactic acid so it uses again the calcium

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.370 
lactic acid so it uses again the calcium
to<00:01:17.490> sort<00:01:18.060> of<00:01:18.119> neutralize<00:01:18.509> that<00:01:18.720> lactic<00:01:19.020> acid

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
to sort of neutralize that lactic acid

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.810 
to sort of neutralize that lactic acid
instead<00:01:20.280> of<00:01:20.780> contributing<00:01:21.780> to<00:01:21.810> bone<00:01:22.049> strength

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.410 
Ted from here in the UK who was written
about<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:30.060> geographical<00:01:30.720> distribution<00:01:31.290> of

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
about the geographical distribution of

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.399 
about the geographical distribution of
osteoporosis<00:01:33.530> he<00:01:34.530> found<00:01:34.950> that<00:01:36.409> where

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
osteoporosis he found that where

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.490 
osteoporosis he found that where
osteoporotic<00:01:38.070> was<00:01:38.520> highest<00:01:39.200> correlated<00:01:40.200> with

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
osteoporotic was highest correlated with

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.880 
osteoporotic was highest correlated with
countries<00:01:41.130> with<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.670> highest<00:01:41.880> level<00:01:42.390> of

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
countries with the highest level of

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.859 
countries with the highest level of
dairy<00:01:43.890> intake<00:01:44.460> so<00:01:44.759> milk<00:01:45.030> intake<00:01:45.420> or<00:01:45.630> cheese

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
dairy intake so milk intake or cheese

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.620 
dairy intake so milk intake or cheese
intake<00:01:46.880> which<00:01:47.880> is<00:01:48.030> kind<00:01:48.210> of<00:01:48.240> an<00:01:48.360> interesting

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
intake which is kind of an interesting

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.560 
intake which is kind of an interesting
little<00:01:48.899> fact<00:01:49.290> and<00:01:50.250> so<00:01:50.430> number<00:01:50.640> four<00:01:50.970> where<00:01:51.450> do

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
little fact and so number four where do

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.920 
little fact and so number four where do
we<00:01:51.659> get<00:01:51.960> calcium<00:01:52.320> from<00:01:53.090> well<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.119> best<00:01:54.479> source

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
we get calcium from well the best source

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.139 
we get calcium from well the best source
of<00:01:55.049> calcium<00:01:55.110> is<00:01:55.710> dark<00:01:56.070> leafy<00:01:56.549> green

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
of calcium is dark leafy green

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.359 
of calcium is dark leafy green
