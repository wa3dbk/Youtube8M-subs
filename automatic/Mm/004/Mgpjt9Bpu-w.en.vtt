Hamilton x-wind how about the next one
is<00:00:10.440> a<00:00:10.500> pretty<00:00:10.679> big<00:00:11.040> watch<00:00:11.280> this<00:00:11.759> one<00:00:12.000> was<00:00:12.120> about

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
is a pretty big watch this one was about

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.709 
is a pretty big watch this one was about
40<00:00:12.809> I<00:00:13.200> think<00:00:13.590> they<00:00:13.679> call<00:00:14.210> 43.7<00:00:15.210> or<00:00:15.389> something

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
40 I think they call 43.7 or something

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:16.039 
40 I think they call 43.7 or something
like<00:00:15.809> that

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
like that

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.929 
like that
it's<00:00:16.260> about<00:00:16.410> 44<00:00:16.859> millimeters<00:00:17.810> it's<00:00:18.810> big<00:00:19.020> watch

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:19.939 
it's about 44 millimeters it's big watch

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:22.400 
it's about 44 millimeters it's big watch
has<00:00:20.939> sort<00:00:21.210> of<00:00:21.240> a<00:00:21.359> bright<00:00:21.600> little<00:00:21.840> up<00:00:22.050> to<00:00:22.230> it<00:00:22.289> in

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
has sort of a bright little up to it in

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.590 
has sort of a bright little up to it in
my<00:00:22.590> opinion<00:00:22.820> reminds<00:00:23.820> me<00:00:24.029> a<00:00:24.090> little<00:00:24.180> bit<00:00:24.330> of<00:00:24.510> a

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
my opinion reminds me a little bit of a

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.950 
my opinion reminds me a little bit of a
cross<00:00:24.840> between<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:26.000> chrono<00:00:27.000> super<00:00:27.359> ocean<00:00:27.779> and

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
cross between the chrono super ocean and

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.220 
cross between the chrono super ocean and
the<00:00:28.699> chronometer<00:00:29.699> evolution<00:00:30.330> because<00:00:30.929> of<00:00:31.109> the

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
the chronometer evolution because of the

the chronometer evolution because of the
day<00:00:31.619> date<00:00:31.859> display<00:00:32.309> their<00:00:33.980> numbers<00:00:34.980> this<00:00:35.640> one

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.619 
one is for training I'll show you here
close-up<00:00:52.410> turning<00:00:53.370> this<00:00:53.460> tiny<00:00:54.090> number<00:00:54.539> up

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
close-up turning this tiny number up

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.139 
close-up turning this tiny number up
here<00:00:54.660> in<00:00:55.620> that<00:00:55.860> little<00:00:56.100> white<00:00:56.280> circle<00:00:56.969> there

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
here in that little white circle there

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.330 
here in that little white circle there
and<00:00:57.770> the<00:00:58.770> combination<00:00:59.460> of<00:00:59.609> these<00:01:01.160> features<00:01:02.160> is

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
and the combination of these features is

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.160 
and the combination of these features is
supposed<00:01:02.640> to<00:01:02.789> be<00:01:02.879> able<00:01:03.000> to<00:01:03.149> count<00:01:03.570> how<00:01:03.960> you

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
supposed to be able to count how you

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.969 
supposed to be able to count how you
would<00:01:04.290> calculate<00:01:05.390> the<00:01:06.390> horizontal<00:01:06.810> drift<00:01:07.680> of

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
would calculate the horizontal drift of

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.750 
would calculate the horizontal drift of
a<00:01:08.100> of<00:01:08.369> an<00:01:09.090> airplane<00:01:10.159> based<00:01:11.159> on<00:01:11.460> certain

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
a of an airplane based on certain

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.460 
a of an airplane based on certain
crosswinds<00:01:12.510> or<00:01:12.689> something<00:01:13.049> like<00:01:13.140> that

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
crosswinds or something like that

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.940 
crosswinds or something like that
it's<00:01:14.189> um<00:01:15.080> and<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.350> instructions<00:01:16.860> are

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
it's um and the instructions are

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.969 
it's um and the instructions are
included<00:01:17.070> in<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.700> in<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.479> watch<00:01:18.659> box<00:01:19.110> as<00:01:19.770> to

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
included in the in the watch box as to

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.880 
included in the in the watch box as to
how<00:01:20.070> you<00:01:20.130> can<00:01:20.520> do<00:01:20.700> these<00:01:20.820> sort<00:01:21.090> of<00:01:21.150> things

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
how you can do these sort of things

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:23.929 
how you can do these sort of things
additionally<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.009> outside<00:01:23.340> bezel<00:01:23.700> also

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
additionally the outside bezel also

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.249 
additionally the outside bezel also
turns<00:01:25.970> so<00:01:26.970> there's<00:01:27.299> quite<00:01:27.659> a<00:01:27.689> few<00:01:27.900> things<00:01:28.080> that

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
turns so there's quite a few things that

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.260 
turns so there's quite a few things that
you<00:01:28.710> can<00:01:28.740> use<00:01:29.100> your<00:01:29.250> lock<00:01:29.759> sitting<00:01:30.090> in<00:01:30.180> a

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
you can use your lock sitting in a

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.179 
you can use your lock sitting in a
couple<00:01:30.570> spots<00:01:30.659> one<00:01:31.400> there<00:01:32.400> you<00:01:32.610> know<00:01:32.820> one<00:01:33.090> more

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:34.189 
couple spots one there you know one more

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:39.289 
couple spots one there you know one more
around<00:01:35.189> 40<00:01:37.189> as<00:01:38.189> you<00:01:38.340> would<00:01:38.430> expect<00:01:38.880> from<00:01:39.090> a

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
around 40 as you would expect from a

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.590 
around 40 as you would expect from a
left<00:01:40.020> crown<00:01:40.850> chronograph<00:01:41.850> there's<00:01:42.299> start

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
left crown chronograph there's start

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.389 
left crown chronograph there's start
pushers<00:01:43.020> on<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.290> bottom<00:01:43.680> as<00:01:43.829> opposed<00:01:44.130> to<00:01:44.250> the

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
pushers on the bottom as opposed to the

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.819 
pushers on the bottom as opposed to the
top<00:01:44.610> because<00:01:44.869> the<00:01:45.869> movements<00:01:46.649> been

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
top because the movements been

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.920 
top because the movements been
transposed<00:01:47.369> to<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.880> other<00:01:48.270> side<00:01:48.600> so<00:01:48.899> you

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
transposed to the other side so you

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.420 
transposed to the other side so you
start<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.380> chronograph<00:01:49.799> of<00:01:49.950> pushing<00:01:50.250> on<00:01:50.369> the

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
start the chronograph of pushing on the

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.499 
start the chronograph of pushing on the
bottom<00:01:50.759> and<00:01:51.920> as<00:01:52.920> you<00:01:53.009> can<00:01:53.100> see<00:01:53.189> them<00:01:53.490> off<00:01:53.670> the

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
bottom and as you can see them off the

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.959 
bottom and as you can see them off the
second<00:01:54.869> hand<00:01:55.020> is<00:01:55.170> moving<00:01:55.549> stop<00:01:56.549> it<00:01:56.729> with<00:01:56.850> the

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
second hand is moving stop it with the

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.690 
second hand is moving stop it with the
bottom<00:01:57.299> and<00:01:57.450> you're<00:01:57.570> set<00:01:57.899> at<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.170> top<00:01:58.700> and

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
bottom and you're set at the top and

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.550 
bottom and you're set at the top and
everything<00:01:59.969> else<00:02:00.329> is<00:02:00.540> kind<00:02:00.750> of<00:02:00.840> backwards<00:02:01.290> to

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
everything else is kind of backwards to

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:07.200 
everything else is kind of backwards to
turn<00:02:02.399> this<00:02:03.860> this<00:02:04.860> way

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:08.969 

there's<00:02:07.780> the<00:02:08.020> opposite<00:02:08.590> way<00:02:08.740> because

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
there's the opposite way because

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.900 
there's the opposite way because
normally<00:02:09.789> you<00:02:10.020> turn<00:02:11.020> it<00:02:11.170> this<00:02:11.320> way<00:02:11.910> because

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
normally you turn it this way because

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.680 
normally you turn it this way because
it's<00:02:13.150> upside<00:02:13.480> down<00:02:14.310> just<00:02:15.310> kind<00:02:15.610> of<00:02:15.700> a<00:02:16.120> little

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
it's upside down just kind of a little

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.390 
it's upside down just kind of a little
bit<00:02:16.870> weird<00:02:17.110> the<00:02:17.320> first<00:02:17.530> time<00:02:17.740> you<00:02:17.860> do<00:02:18.010> it

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
bit weird the first time you do it

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.470 
bit weird the first time you do it

and it only has aluminous thoughts kind
of<00:03:12.959> reminds<00:03:13.290> me<00:03:13.319> of<00:03:13.439> the<00:03:13.709> Breitling<00:03:14.280> super

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:14.579 
of reminds me of the Breitling super

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:16.039 
of reminds me of the Breitling super
Avenger<00:03:14.909> which<00:03:15.060> has<00:03:15.420> those<00:03:15.629> big<00:03:15.840> white

numbers on it but none of them flight up
this<00:03:20.670> one<00:03:20.879> is<00:03:21.060> similar<00:03:21.540> in<00:03:21.840> that<00:03:22.019> it<00:03:22.349> doesn't

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
this one is similar in that it doesn't

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.179 
this one is similar in that it doesn't
have<00:03:22.859> a<00:03:22.890> lot<00:03:23.159> of<00:03:23.189> loom<00:03:24.349> neat<00:03:25.349> back<00:03:25.620> on<00:03:25.859> this<00:03:26.010> one

00:03:26.179 --> 00:03:26.189 
have a lot of loom neat back on this one

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:30.410 
have a lot of loom neat back on this one
it's<00:03:26.790> got<00:03:26.970> sort<00:03:27.180> of<00:03:27.239> a<00:03:27.359> semicircle<00:03:27.799> with<00:03:29.420> you

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
it's got sort of a semicircle with you

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:31.880 
it's got sort of a semicircle with you
can<00:03:30.540> see<00:03:30.689> there<00:03:30.900> you<00:03:31.230> can<00:03:31.290> see<00:03:31.560> the<00:03:31.709> road

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
can see there you can see the road

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.720 
can see there you can see the road
through<00:03:32.310> it<00:03:32.430> it<00:03:33.090> also<00:03:33.209> has<00:03:33.680> some<00:03:34.730> calculation

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
through it it also has some calculation

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.330 
through it it also has some calculation
compass<00:03:36.720> things<00:03:37.079> up<00:03:37.439> here<00:03:37.709> that<00:03:37.950> allow<00:03:38.129> you<00:03:38.190> to

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
compass things up here that allow you to

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.020 
compass things up here that allow you to
do<00:03:38.579> some<00:03:38.819> sort<00:03:39.030> of<00:03:39.090> a<00:03:40.220> avionic<00:03:41.220> calculation<00:03:41.909> as

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
do some sort of a avionic calculation as

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.559 
do some sort of a avionic calculation as
well<00:03:43.040> the<00:03:44.040> back<00:03:44.280> on<00:03:44.489> this<00:03:44.609> one<00:03:44.790> isn't<00:03:45.150> screwed

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:45.569 
well the back on this one isn't screwed

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:48.860 
well the back on this one isn't screwed
down<00:03:45.690> it<00:03:45.930> has<00:03:46.079> uh<00:03:46.639> instead<00:03:47.639> of<00:03:47.760> has<00:03:47.879> it's<00:03:48.209> a<00:03:48.389> has

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
down it has uh instead of has it's a has

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:56.119 
down it has uh instead of has it's a has
screws<00:03:49.319> bring<00:03:49.950> it<00:03:50.069> in<00:03:50.569> so<00:03:51.569> um<00:03:53.569> it's<00:03:55.129> probably

00:03:56.119 --> 00:03:56.129 
screws bring it in so um it's probably

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:59.449 
screws bring it in so um it's probably
not<00:03:56.489> as<00:03:57.980> water-resistant<00:03:58.980> I<00:03:59.040> don't<00:03:59.189> remember

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
not as water-resistant I don't remember

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:01.250 
not as water-resistant I don't remember
with<00:03:59.730> the<00:03:59.819> rod<00:04:00.000> water-resistant<00:04:00.810> the<00:04:00.900> ratings

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
with the rod water-resistant the ratings

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.229 
with the rod water-resistant the ratings
are<00:04:01.439> but<00:04:01.650> I<00:04:01.680> think<00:04:02.129> it<00:04:02.280> was<00:04:02.489> actually<00:04:02.700> 100

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
are but I think it was actually 100

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:05.330 
are but I think it was actually 100
meters<00:04:03.510> so<00:04:03.720> it's<00:04:03.900> not<00:04:04.049> too<00:04:04.260> bad<00:04:04.290> all<00:04:05.280> the

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
meters so it's not too bad all the

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:11.539 
meters so it's not too bad all the
crowns<00:04:05.790> are<00:04:06.000> screw<00:04:06.359> down<00:04:08.359> so<00:04:10.190> that<00:04:11.190> probably

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:11.549 
crowns are screw down so that probably

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:14.800 
crowns are screw down so that probably
helps<00:04:12.379> sapphire<00:04:13.379> crystal<00:04:13.829> around<00:04:14.040> of<00:04:14.310> course

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
helps sapphire crystal around of course

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:20.439 
helps sapphire crystal around of course
I<00:04:15.810> think<00:04:16.590> this<00:04:16.769> one<00:04:17.010> retails<00:04:17.280> at<00:04:17.760> around<00:04:17.970> 1,500

00:04:20.439 --> 00:04:20.449 
I think this one retails at around 1,500

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:25.550 
I think this one retails at around 1,500
look<00:04:21.449> really<00:04:21.720> nice<00:04:21.840> watch<00:04:22.139> actually<00:04:24.560> black

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
look really nice watch actually black

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.070 
look really nice watch actually black
tile<00:04:26.180> doesn't<00:04:27.180> have<00:04:27.360> the<00:04:27.599> anti-reflective

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 
tile doesn't have the anti-reflective

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.779 
tile doesn't have the anti-reflective
coating<00:04:28.800> on<00:04:29.270> this<00:04:30.270> one<00:04:30.510> as<00:04:30.659> well<00:04:31.099> so<00:04:32.099> it<00:04:32.370> does

00:04:32.779 --> 00:04:32.789 
coating on this one as well so it does

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:35.600 
coating on this one as well so it does
reflect<00:04:33.030> quite<00:04:33.330> a<00:04:33.360> bit<00:04:33.539> of<00:04:33.599> light<00:04:34.370> it's<00:04:35.370> of<00:04:35.520> the

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
reflect quite a bit of light it's of the

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:39.560 
reflect quite a bit of light it's of the
fingerprints<00:04:36.949> but<00:04:37.949> I<00:04:38.310> did<00:04:38.760> review<00:04:39.060> a<00:04:39.120> Hamilton

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:39.570 
fingerprints but I did review a Hamilton

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:41.659 
fingerprints but I did review a Hamilton
Jazz<00:04:39.840> Master<00:04:40.139> before<00:04:40.740> and<00:04:40.919> I<00:04:40.979> really<00:04:41.250> liked<00:04:41.460> it

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:41.669 
Jazz Master before and I really liked it

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:43.219 
Jazz Master before and I really liked it
and<00:04:41.849> the<00:04:41.970> cross<00:04:42.210> ones<00:04:42.479> also<00:04:42.810> really<00:04:43.080> nice

00:04:43.219 --> 00:04:43.229 
and the cross ones also really nice

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:48.320 
and the cross ones also really nice
watch<00:04:44.510> their<00:04:45.510> value<00:04:45.990> is<00:04:46.229> is<00:04:46.729> definitely<00:04:47.729> very

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330 
watch their value is is definitely very

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:52.040 
watch their value is is definitely very
good<00:04:50.000> their<00:04:51.000> movements<00:04:51.479> aren't<00:04:51.750> quite<00:04:51.960> as

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
good their movements aren't quite as

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.339 
good their movements aren't quite as
decorated<00:04:52.620> or<00:04:52.770> modified<00:04:53.490> as<00:04:53.669> much<00:04:53.909> as<00:04:54.320> some<00:04:55.320> of

00:04:55.339 --> 00:04:55.349 
decorated or modified as much as some of

00:04:55.349 --> 00:04:58.610 
decorated or modified as much as some of
the<00:04:55.500> other<00:04:55.620> Swiss<00:04:55.889> makers<00:04:56.250> out<00:04:56.400> there<00:04:57.620> like

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:58.620 
the other Swiss makers out there like

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:02.180 
the other Swiss makers out there like
the<00:04:58.740> rotor<00:04:58.949> stick<00:04:59.750> but<00:05:00.750> yeah<00:05:01.020> that<00:05:02.010> would<00:05:02.159> be

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:02.190 
the rotor stick but yeah that would be
