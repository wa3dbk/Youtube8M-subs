the<00:01:08.610> iPhone<00:01:08.729> cases<00:01:09.420> we<00:01:09.600> have<00:01:09.720> two<00:01:09.930> different

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
the iPhone cases we have two different

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.469 
the iPhone cases we have two different
styles<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:11.159> first<00:01:11.400> is<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.760> Navigator<00:01:12.180> here

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
styles the first is the Navigator here

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.480 
styles the first is the Navigator here
in<00:01:12.600> white<00:01:12.840> one<00:01:13.560> thing<00:01:13.740> to<00:01:13.860> note<00:01:14.010> is<00:01:14.189> that<00:01:14.220> these

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
in white one thing to note is that these

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.130 
in white one thing to note is that these
cases<00:01:14.700> all<00:01:15.030> come<00:01:15.270> in<00:01:15.390> multiple<00:01:15.540> colors<00:01:15.810> and

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
cases all come in multiple colors and

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.440 
cases all come in multiple colors and
those<00:01:16.680> colors<00:01:16.740> have<00:01:17.280> different<00:01:17.310> names<00:01:17.939> so

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
those colors have different names so

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.820 
those colors have different names so
this<00:01:18.780> is<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:18.990> white<00:01:19.170> version<00:01:19.409> called<00:01:19.740> the

this is the white version called the

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.710 
this is the white version called the
navigator<00:01:20.220> but<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.850> or<00:01:20.970> inversion<00:01:21.360> is<00:01:21.540> the

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
navigator but the or inversion is the

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
it isn't in the way and if you fold it a

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.149 
it isn't in the way and if you fold it a
run<00:02:21.330> back<00:02:21.540> it's<00:02:21.840> very<00:02:22.110> bulky<00:02:22.409> and<00:02:22.739> covers<00:02:23.040> up

run back it's very bulky and covers up
the<00:02:23.280> camera<00:02:23.610> and<00:02:23.790> really<00:02:24.180> this<00:02:24.360> is<00:02:24.420> the

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
the camera and really this is the

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:25.789 
the camera and really this is the
biggest<00:02:24.870> issue<00:02:25.019> with<00:02:25.170> this<00:02:25.409> case<00:02:25.590> it<00:02:25.769> just

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:25.799 
biggest issue with this case it just

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:28.309 
biggest issue with this case it just
doesn't<00:02:26.220> feel<00:02:26.370> refined<00:02:27.030> this<00:02:27.720> case<00:02:27.900> does<00:02:28.140> come

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
doesn't feel refined this case does come

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:31.430 
doesn't feel refined this case does come
in<00:02:28.440> two<00:02:28.500> colors<00:02:28.890> and<00:02:29.099> costs<00:02:29.430> $40<00:02:30.000> u.s.<00:02:30.440> so

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
in two colors and costs $40 u.s. so

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.319 
in two colors and costs $40 u.s. so
those<00:02:31.769> are<00:02:31.890> the<00:02:31.980> cases<00:02:32.280> from<00:02:32.430> UAG<00:02:32.819> for<00:02:33.269> the

iPad air 2 in iphone 6 overall they're

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.420 
iPad air 2 in iphone 6 overall they're
very<00:02:36.329> rugged<00:02:36.569> cases<00:02:36.959> with<00:02:37.319> a<00:02:37.349> cool<00:02:37.620> design<00:02:37.799> but

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
very rugged cases with a cool design but

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.610 
very rugged cases with a cool design but
the<00:02:38.519> folio<00:02:38.849> does<00:02:39.090> have<00:02:39.329> some<00:02:39.569> issues<00:02:39.750> if<00:02:40.409> you

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
the folio does have some issues if you

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.229 
the folio does have some issues if you
love<00:02:40.799> folio<00:02:41.099> cases<00:02:41.519> you'll<00:02:41.760> probably<00:02:41.970> like

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
love folio cases you'll probably like

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:43.759 
love folio cases you'll probably like
these<00:02:42.420> as<00:02:42.629> well<00:02:42.810> but<00:02:43.200> if<00:02:43.319> you're<00:02:43.470> on<00:02:43.560> the<00:02:43.590> fence

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
these as well but if you're on the fence

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:45.680 
these as well but if you're on the fence
the<00:02:44.280> non<00:02:44.430> folio<00:02:44.760> version<00:02:45.120> is<00:02:45.209> probably<00:02:45.420> the

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
the non folio version is probably the

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:46.369 
the non folio version is probably the
way<00:02:45.780> to<00:02:45.810> go

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:46.379 
way to go

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:48.259 
way to go
