00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:46.030 
to add a fuel in this case I'm using

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:52.790 
to add a fuel in this case I'm using
mineral<00:00:46.600> oil<00:00:46.930> or<00:00:48.030> baby<00:00:49.030> oil<00:00:50.129> add<00:00:51.129> just<00:00:51.489> enough

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
mineral oil or baby oil add just enough

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.310 
mineral oil or baby oil add just enough
cover<00:00:53.800> the<00:00:53.949> bottom<00:00:54.100> of<00:00:54.280> the<00:00:54.340> can<00:00:55.110> don't<00:00:56.110> need<00:00:56.260> a

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:56.320 
cover the bottom of the can don't need a

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.479 
cover the bottom of the can don't need a
lot<00:00:57.420> i'm<00:00:58.420> going<00:00:58.600> to<00:00:58.660> set<00:00:58.900> this<00:00:59.190> hand<00:01:00.190> right<00:01:00.370> on

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:00.489 
lot i'm going to set this hand right on

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:03.479 
lot i'm going to set this hand right on
top<00:01:01.380> make<00:01:02.380> sure<00:01:02.410> it's<00:01:02.710> sticking<00:01:03.100> out<00:01:03.370> a<00:01:03.399> little

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:03.489 
top make sure it's sticking out a little

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:09.780 
top make sure it's sticking out a little
bit<00:01:04.350> let<00:01:05.350> this<00:01:05.530> hand<00:01:05.830> right<00:01:05.920> on<00:01:06.070> top<00:01:06.430> I<00:01:08.670> have<00:01:09.670> my

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:09.790 
bit let this hand right on top I have my

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:11.610 
bit let this hand right on top I have my
whip<00:01:10.030> sticking<00:01:10.509> out

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:11.620 
whip sticking out

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:16.200 
whip sticking out
and<00:01:12.160> like

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.880 

hopefully<00:01:17.210> it'll<00:01:17.359> start<00:01:18.049> wicking<00:01:18.590> up<00:01:18.710> that

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
hopefully it'll start wicking up that

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.700 
hopefully it'll start wicking up that
oil<00:01:19.659> and<00:01:20.659> I<00:01:20.750> think<00:01:20.990> it<00:01:21.109> is<00:01:21.140> because<00:01:21.380> if<00:01:21.590> it

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
oil and I think it is because if it

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:23.319 
oil and I think it is because if it
wasn't<00:01:21.890> it<00:01:22.130> would<00:01:22.219> probably<00:01:22.460> burn<00:01:22.789> itself<00:01:23.149> out

00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:23.329 
wasn't it would probably burn itself out

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:26.039 
wasn't it would probably burn itself out
already<00:01:23.740> you<00:01:24.740> see<00:01:24.950> it's<00:01:25.100> burning<00:01:25.429> quite<00:01:25.640> well

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:26.049 
already you see it's burning quite well

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:29.609 
already you see it's burning quite well
now<00:01:27.049> the<00:01:27.110> reason<00:01:27.380> you<00:01:27.920> need<00:01:28.130> this<00:01:28.310> can<00:01:28.640> on<00:01:28.819> top

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:29.619 
now the reason you need this can on top

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:32.649 
now the reason you need this can on top
is<00:01:30.619> because<00:01:30.950> you<00:01:31.100> want<00:01:31.310> to<00:01:31.399> limit<00:01:31.700> the<00:01:32.569> amount

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:32.659 
is because you want to limit the amount

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:35.410 
is because you want to limit the amount
of<00:01:32.929> surface<00:01:33.259> that<00:01:33.770> the<00:01:33.979> oil<00:01:34.159> has<00:01:34.399> if<00:01:35.179> you<00:01:35.329> have

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
of surface that the oil has if you have

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.359 
of surface that the oil has if you have
too<00:01:35.600> much<00:01:35.719> surface<00:01:36.259> for<00:01:36.469> the<00:01:36.500> oil<00:01:36.740> what

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:37.369 
too much surface for the oil what

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:39.429 
too much surface for the oil what
happens<00:01:37.670> is<00:01:37.819> when<00:01:38.000> that<00:01:38.149> can<00:01:38.539> and<00:01:38.840> that<00:01:39.229> will

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:39.439 
happens is when that can and that will

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:41.350 
happens is when that can and that will
heat<00:01:39.709> up<00:01:39.740> it's<00:01:40.579> called<00:01:40.819> a<00:01:40.880> flare<00:01:41.179> of<00:01:41.209> the

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
heat up it's called a flare of the

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.559 
heat up it's called a flare of the
entire<00:01:41.659> oil<00:01:41.929> surface<00:01:42.500> of<00:01:42.679> you<00:01:42.829> but<00:01:42.950> I<00:01:42.979> have<00:01:43.069> a

00:01:43.559 --> 00:01:43.569 
entire oil surface of you but I have a

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:45.699 
entire oil surface of you but I have a
essentially<00:01:44.569> an<00:01:44.689> oil<00:01:45.020> fire<00:01:45.200> like<00:01:45.439> you<00:01:45.560> would

00:01:45.699 --> 00:01:45.709 
essentially an oil fire like you would

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:48.210 
essentially an oil fire like you would
in<00:01:45.770> the<00:01:45.860> kitchen<00:01:46.219> when<00:01:46.490> the<00:01:46.640> oil<00:01:46.700> players<00:01:47.149> up

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
in the kitchen when the oil players up

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.710 
in the kitchen when the oil players up
so<00:01:49.220> this<00:01:49.310> can<00:01:49.610> is<00:01:49.759> very<00:01:49.939> important<00:01:50.329> now<00:01:50.420> I<00:01:50.450> have

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
so this can is very important now I have

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.609 
so this can is very important now I have
made<00:01:50.929> these<00:01:51.079> without<00:01:51.380> the<00:01:51.799> can<00:01:52.450> okay<00:01:53.619> the

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:54.619 
made these without the can okay the

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:58.479 
made these without the can okay the
problem<00:01:55.039> is<00:01:55.569> will<00:01:56.569> fire<00:01:56.950> the<00:01:57.950> way<00:01:58.069> to<00:01:58.130> prevent

00:01:58.479 --> 00:01:58.489 
problem is will fire the way to prevent

00:01:58.489 --> 00:02:00.370 
problem is will fire the way to prevent
it<00:01:58.670> is<00:01:58.789> to<00:01:58.819> use<00:01:59.090> a<00:01:59.119> very<00:01:59.509> small<00:01:59.630> wick<00:02:00.049> and<00:02:00.229> like

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
it is to use a very small wick and like

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.449 
it is to use a very small wick and like
I<00:02:00.470> say<00:02:00.649> a<00:02:00.679> very<00:02:01.039> minimal<00:02:01.610> amount<00:02:01.970> of<00:02:02.090> oil<00:02:03.459> but

00:02:04.449 --> 00:02:04.459 
I say a very minimal amount of oil but

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:06.039 
I say a very minimal amount of oil but
it<00:02:04.549> is<00:02:04.700> very<00:02:04.789> dangerous<00:02:05.239> i<00:02:05.599> highly<00:02:06.020> suggest

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:06.049 
it is very dangerous i highly suggest

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:08.410 
it is very dangerous i highly suggest
never<00:02:06.619> use<00:02:06.829> these<00:02:07.009> indoors<00:02:07.399> always<00:02:07.909> outside

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
never use these indoors always outside

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.749 
never use these indoors always outside
not<00:02:09.170> in<00:02:09.349> a<00:02:09.470> tent<00:02:09.739> out<00:02:09.920> in<00:02:10.069> the<00:02:10.190> cabin<00:02:10.549> outside

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
not in a tent out in the cabin outside

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
out add more oil repeat the process now

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:38.400 
out add more oil repeat the process now
you<00:02:37.030> don't<00:02:37.180> want<00:02:37.360> to<00:02:37.450> add<00:02:37.600> oil<00:02:37.930> while<00:02:38.230> it's

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410

burning you want to be safe never take

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.480 
burning you want to be safe never take
chances<00:02:41.590> like<00:02:42.010> that<00:02:42.450> and<00:02:43.450> like<00:02:43.480> I<00:02:43.870> said<00:02:44.490> use

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:45.490 
chances like that and like I said use

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:49.410 
chances like that and like I said use
that<00:02:45.840> cover<00:02:46.840> to<00:02:47.160> block<00:02:48.160> the<00:02:48.310> surface<00:02:48.730> to<00:02:48.910> keep

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
that cover to block the surface to keep

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.930 
that cover to block the surface to keep
oxygen<00:02:49.810> off<00:02:50.380> the<00:02:50.560> surface<00:02:50.770> of<00:02:51.040> that<00:02:51.190> oil<00:02:51.310> so

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
oxygen off the surface of that oil so

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.360 
oxygen off the surface of that oil so
that<00:02:51.970> if<00:02:52.180> it<00:02:52.300> does<00:02:52.480> get<00:02:52.690> hot<00:02:52.960> you<00:02:53.800> won't<00:02:53.980> risk

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
that if it does get hot you won't risk

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.910 
that if it does get hot you won't risk
having<00:02:54.670> it<00:02:54.970> an<00:02:55.090> out-of-control<00:02:55.720> oil<00:02:56.110> fire<00:02:56.350> and

quite a bit getting quite a bit more

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.720 
quite a bit getting quite a bit more
flame<00:03:16.720> out<00:03:16.960> of<00:03:17.050> it<00:03:17.170> now<00:03:18.100> I<00:03:18.130> have<00:03:18.310> it<00:03:18.340> set<00:03:18.670> so

flame out of it now I have it set so

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.610 
flame out of it now I have it set so
that<00:03:19.000> wheels<00:03:19.330> away<00:03:19.660> from<00:03:19.870> that<00:03:19.990> flame<00:03:20.320> and

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
that wheels away from that flame and

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.850 
that wheels away from that flame and
it's<00:03:21.220> just<00:03:21.400> wicking<00:03:21.760> it<00:03:21.910> up<00:03:22.060> and<00:03:22.710> that<00:03:23.710> would

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 
it's just wicking it up and that would

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.650 
it's just wicking it up and that would
be<00:03:24.010> one<00:03:24.220> safe<00:03:24.490> way<00:03:24.700> to<00:03:24.730> do<00:03:24.970> it<00:03:25.120> it's<00:03:25.450> a<00:03:25.510> little

be one safe way to do it it's a little

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.870 
be one safe way to do it it's a little
safer<00:03:25.990> but<00:03:26.800> still<00:03:27.070> like<00:03:27.220> I<00:03:27.310> said<00:03:27.520> if<00:03:27.610> it<00:03:27.730> gets

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
safer but still like I said if it gets

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.350 
safer but still like I said if it gets
too<00:03:28.060> hot<00:03:28.300> you<00:03:29.140> run<00:03:29.350> the<00:03:29.470> risk<00:03:29.500> of<00:03:29.800> having<00:03:29.950> a
