00:00:35.917 --> 00:00:39.125
Alex... Al... wake up!

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.458
What?! How?! I'm awake. What's up?

00:00:42.917 --> 00:00:44.458
Alex... I have a big problem.

00:00:45.125 --> 00:00:47.125
Did you have the U.F.O. dream again?

00:00:47.375 --> 00:00:51.422
I can't get away from them... What do they
want from me, Alex? I know what to do! I'll

00:00:51.447 --> 00:00:55.399
trick them. I'll never sleep again. I'll
show them! They'll never suck me up... again!

00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:04.333
Alright...

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.758
Alex... You've got to help me stay awake.

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.917
What's that?

00:01:11.208 --> 00:01:15.999
Coffee. Grown-ups swear by it. It's
how they all stay awake at work.

00:01:16.042 --> 00:01:18.750
Why is it so bitter?

00:01:19.208 --> 00:01:21.042
That is the taste of adulthood.

00:01:22.333 --> 00:01:29.332
Tug my leash!! I'm not sleepy at all!

00:01:29.333 --> 00:01:31.458
What did I tell you? Sweet no dreams.

00:01:32.458 --> 00:01:36.540
In your face, aliens... Don't
bother waiting around

00:01:36.565 --> 00:01:40.482
for me because I'm never
going to sleep again!!

00:01:48.875 --> 00:01:49.875
Alex... Al!

00:01:50.792 --> 00:01:52.708
Your coffee's not working anymore.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.542
Your body needs sleep, that's why. Try to get
your mind off of it. Play a game or something...

00:01:58.999 --> 00:02:01.042
That's a great idea, I know just what to play!

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.500
I could stay awake all
night playing Wolfman-Man!

00:02:20.625 --> 00:02:21.625
Alex!

00:02:24.208 --> 00:02:25.583
Still... sleepy?

00:02:27.417 --> 00:02:33.917
You've stayed awake for five hours. Just two
more and you'll have made it through to morning.

00:02:36.125 --> 00:02:37.292
Or maybe not...

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.042
Isn't there something else we could try?
I don't want the aliens to get me...

00:02:43.708 --> 00:02:47.478
Look, Max... We have tried... everything.
Just lie down and watch your

00:02:47.503 --> 00:02:51.441
alien dream through to the end. I
mean, after all it is only a dream.

00:02:52.708 --> 00:02:58.417
You're right! I should stop running away.
I should go face those aliens... head on!

00:02:59.417 --> 00:03:00.583
Go get 'em.

00:03:03.875 --> 00:03:07.212
What if I face them head on,
and then they kick my furry

00:03:07.237 --> 00:03:10.691
butt? I need to find a more
active game too keep me awake.

00:03:11.042 --> 00:03:19.042
Help me, soccer ball, you're my only hope!

00:03:30.208 --> 00:03:36.000
Well, look who's a traitor! Still... maybe
it's my destiny to face these aliens...

00:03:43.999 --> 00:03:47.859
Welcome to the Galaxy Cup Finals!
Meeting on the field

00:03:47.884 --> 00:03:52.023
today - the unbeatable Max and
a team of freaky cat-borgs!

00:03:54.458 --> 00:03:59.292
Well tug my leash, man...

00:04:11.333 --> 00:04:16.792
Missed the goal! I was so close! Gotta get back.
Gotta get back to sleep.

00:04:28.417 --> 00:04:33.583
Alex... Al... I have a big problem...
Can you help me get to sleep?
