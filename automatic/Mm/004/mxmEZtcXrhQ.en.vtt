 peillon 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:52.370
 he's talking for a moment 0 about this 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.030
 moment of the big board 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:58.579
 gold only after the big bang that 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:01.730
 is not true the big bang does match 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:03.769
 not at the moment 0 actually they have 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.740
 discovered despite them so-called 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:08.660
 radiation is 6 of the ranks vmt legal 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.410
 of the big bang of this event that happened 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:13.610
 produced at 13 billion 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:17.210
 but where does it terminals 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.560
 there is no ultimate truth there is 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.560
 that perceptions they listened to 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.869
 einstein is wrong because he introduced 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.860
 by hand in his own equation 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:26.330
 internal 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.130
 he called the cosmological constant 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.130
 who does not reach who comes to block 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.690
 the expansion of the universe 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.080
 the reality is never completely 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:38.000
 grasped 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:40.130
 it is relative now this 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.670
 colossal energy this temperature 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:48.070
 unheard this is a site is phenomenal 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:48.070
 question of where does this all come from 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.500
