on<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.310> front<00:01:38.640> here<00:01:38.820> but<00:01:39.060> in<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.210> back<00:01:39.390> it's

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
on the front here but in the back it's

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.569 
on the front here but in the back it's
not<00:01:39.840> so<00:01:40.590> then<00:01:40.740> grease<00:01:40.950> will<00:01:41.189> come<00:01:41.400> out<00:01:41.549> a

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
not so then grease will come out a

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.999 
not so then grease will come out a
little<00:01:41.759> bit<00:01:41.939> in<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.060> back<00:01:42.240> that's<00:01:42.509> okay<00:01:43.009> so

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
little bit in the back that's okay so

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.490 
little bit in the back that's okay so
and<00:01:44.820> you<00:01:45.090> just<00:01:45.270> pushes<00:01:45.659> then<00:01:45.869> any<00:01:46.229> grease

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
and you just pushes then any grease

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.230 
and you just pushes then any grease
that's<00:01:46.710> got<00:01:46.920> water<00:01:47.220> in<00:01:47.369> it<00:01:47.579> or<00:01:47.700> dirt<00:01:47.970> just

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
that's got water in it or dirt just

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.789 
that's got water in it or dirt just
pushes<00:01:48.689> right<00:01:48.780> out<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.049> back<00:01:49.229> so<00:01:49.439> it's<00:01:49.590> almost

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
pushes right out the back so it's almost

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.460 
pushes right out the back so it's almost
always<00:01:50.009> like<00:01:50.220> fresh<00:01:50.430> grease<00:01:50.700> all<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.060> time

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
always like fresh grease all the time

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.600 
always like fresh grease all the time
which<00:01:52.470> I<00:01:52.590> kind<00:01:52.770> of<00:01:52.799> like<00:01:52.890> it's<00:01:53.189> a<00:01:53.310> little<00:01:53.520> more

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
which I kind of like it's a little more

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.999 
which I kind of like it's a little more
maintenance<00:01:53.970> but<00:01:54.750> you<00:01:55.500> know<00:01:55.590> at<00:01:55.740> least<00:01:55.770> you

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
maintenance but you know at least you

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:05.050 
maintenance but you know at least you
know<00:01:56.280> you're<00:01:56.729> getting<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.530> maintenance<00:01:58.530> done

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.400 

six<00:02:06.060> seven<00:02:06.390> hundred<00:02:07.520> back<00:02:08.520> you<00:02:08.729> can<00:02:08.849> see<00:02:09.060> the

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
six seven hundred back you can see the

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.710 
six seven hundred back you can see the
how<00:02:10.410> wide<00:02:10.679> it<00:02:10.890> is<00:02:11.009> here

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
how wide it is here

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.750 
how wide it is here
and<00:02:12.720> how<00:02:12.840> much<00:02:13.170> how<00:02:13.740> much<00:02:13.890> clearance<00:02:14.340> you<00:02:14.580> have

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
and how much how much clearance you have

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:21.010 
and how much how much clearance you have
it's<00:02:15.300> crazy

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.830 

so<00:02:22.020> we'd<00:02:22.410> ride<00:02:22.710> this<00:02:22.890> thing<00:02:22.950> to<00:02:23.430> the<00:02:24.210> mud<00:02:24.420> we

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
so we'd ride this thing to the mud we

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.540 
so we'd ride this thing to the mud we
ride<00:02:25.050> through<00:02:25.260> wetlands<00:02:25.980> and<00:02:26.040> write<00:02:26.280> it<00:02:26.430> on

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
ride through wetlands and write it on

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.170 
ride through wetlands and write it on
the<00:02:26.790> asphalt<00:02:27.200> write<00:02:28.200> it<00:02:28.320> down<00:02:28.440> dirt<00:02:28.740> roads<00:02:29.180> we

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
the asphalt write it down dirt roads we

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.720 
the asphalt write it down dirt roads we
write<00:02:30.360> it<00:02:30.540> down<00:02:30.570> just<00:02:31.200> want<00:02:32.040> anything<00:02:32.280> you<00:02:32.580> can

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
write it down just want anything you can

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.250 
write it down just want anything you can
think<00:02:32.910> of<00:02:33.530> the<00:02:34.530> actual<00:02:35.750> the<00:02:36.750> width<00:02:36.960> of<00:02:37.110> the

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
think of the actual the width of the

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.700 
think of the actual the width of the
wheeler<00:02:37.680> was<00:02:38.550> increased<00:02:39.000> so<00:02:39.350> trail<00:02:40.350> riding

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710 
wheeler was increased so trail riding

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:42.710 
wheeler was increased so trail riding
might<00:02:41.010> be<00:02:41.130> a<00:02:41.160> little<00:02:41.310> more<00:02:41.660> little<00:02:42.660> more

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
might be a little more little more

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.700 
might be a little more little more
daunting<00:02:43.260> but<00:02:43.790> you<00:02:44.790> know<00:02:44.910> it<00:02:45.090> does<00:02:45.330> have<00:02:45.710> its

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:46.710 
daunting but you know it does have its

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:49.250 
daunting but you know it does have its
advantages<00:02:46.800> so<00:02:47.610> you<00:02:47.670> can<00:02:47.910> take<00:02:48.630> them<00:02:48.810> off<00:02:48.990> if

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
advantages so you can take them off if

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:58.030 
advantages so you can take them off if
you<00:02:49.410> want<00:02:49.620> to<00:02:49.770> bring<00:02:50.760> the<00:02:50.940> tires<00:02:51.180> on<00:02:56.390> the<00:02:57.390> track

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
you want to bring the tires on the track

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:03.830 
you want to bring the tires on the track
12<00:02:59.040> inches<00:02:59.340> wide<00:03:00.410> the<00:03:01.670> actual<00:03:02.670> length<00:03:03.540> of<00:03:03.750> the

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
12 inches wide the actual length of the

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.530 
12 inches wide the actual length of the
track<00:03:04.110> I<00:03:04.140> think<00:03:04.440> is<00:03:04.530> 36<00:03:05.130> inches<00:03:05.310> and<00:03:06.300> I<00:03:06.360> was

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
track I think is 36 inches and I was

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.180 
track I think is 36 inches and I was
reading<00:03:06.780> somewhere<00:03:07.140> that<00:03:07.320> says<00:03:07.740> you<00:03:07.860> get<00:03:08.040> like

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
reading somewhere that says you get like

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.010 
reading somewhere that says you get like
three-quarters<00:03:09.060> of<00:03:09.090> a<00:03:09.270> pound<00:03:09.300> per<00:03:09.990> square

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020 
three-quarters of a pound per square

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:13.100 
three-quarters of a pound per square
inch<00:03:10.410> when<00:03:11.310> you<00:03:11.340> have<00:03:11.520> these<00:03:11.670> on<00:03:11.880> so<00:03:12.780> it<00:03:12.900> really

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
which is real helpful this wheeler I

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.430 
which is real helpful this wheeler I
think<00:03:29.370> without<00:03:29.640> the<00:03:29.970> tracks<00:03:30.300> was<00:03:30.570> about<00:03:30.870> six

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440
