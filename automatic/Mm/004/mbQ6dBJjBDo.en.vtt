00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.190
 and even though the epilogue is read 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.190
 end of all your lessons are 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.430
 principles as you like but listen 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.430
 carefully 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:27.919

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:40.370

 Ask him he will not refuse to give you all 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:49.660
 the answers you need to 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:52.420

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:58.170
 problems and clear up all the doubts your 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:02.030
 Certainty is yours, you just need 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:04.489
 ask for it to be given to you 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:07.040
 your arrival at home is as safe as 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:10.460
 the trajectory that has been laid out for 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:13.729
 the sun before dawn breaks 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:16.490
 after sunset and in the hours of 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:20.300
 partial luminosity that passes between 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:23.360
 means in fact your path is even more 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:25.670
 sure, it is impossible to change the 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:29.450
 course of those that God has called to 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:33.170
 your vera obeys therefore your will 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:35.720
 and follow the one whom you accepted as 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:38.380
 your voice to tell you what really 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.869
 you want and you need 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:44.530
 his is the voice that speaks for god and 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:47.740
 also for you therefore the speech of 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:50.140
 freedom and truth are no longer 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:53.619
 will assign more specific lessons 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:56.350
 they are no longer necessary henceforth he hears 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:58.720
 just the voice that speaks for God and for 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:01.569
 your being when you leave the world to 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:04.450
 look for reality instead 

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:07.179

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:10.000

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:13.209

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:17.530
 he silently asking for his address 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:20.319
 infallible and unerring word of his is 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.810
 the word that God has given you is 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:26.830
 the word that you chose to be 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:29.200
 your own and now I put you in your 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:33.849

 followers and your guide throughout 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:41.000
 difficulty or pain that you consider real 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:44.850
 he will not give you any passing pleasure 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:48.060
