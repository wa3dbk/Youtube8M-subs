until I get it positioned nicely on
screen<00:01:11.750> for<00:01:12.750> this<00:01:12.900> example<00:01:13.830> I'm<00:01:14.010> just<00:01:14.070> going

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
screen for this example I'm just going

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.090 
screen for this example I'm just going
to<00:01:14.310> take<00:01:14.490> one<00:01:14.520> snapshot<00:01:15.060> that's<00:01:15.659> all<00:01:15.930> just<00:01:16.920> one

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
to take one snapshot that's all just one

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.570 
to take one snapshot that's all just one
snapshot<00:01:17.460> so<00:01:17.820> I'm<00:01:17.909> rotating<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:19.130> fighter<00:01:20.130> on

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
snapshot so I'm rotating the fighter on

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.580 
snapshot so I'm rotating the fighter on
screen<00:01:21.030> and<00:01:21.240> take<00:01:21.479> one<00:01:21.720> snapshot<00:01:22.020> with<00:01:22.439> my

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
screen and take one snapshot with my

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.310 
screen and take one snapshot with my
spacebar<00:01:22.970> so<00:01:23.970> you<00:01:24.060> can<00:01:24.180> see<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.570> single<00:01:25.140> shot

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
spacebar so you can see the single shot

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.370 
spacebar so you can see the single shot
appears<00:01:25.710> in<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:25.920> timeline<00:01:26.340> at<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.790> bottom

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
appears in the timeline at the bottom

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.130 
appears in the timeline at the bottom
that's<00:01:28.380> what<00:01:28.560> I'm<00:01:28.650> gonna<00:01:28.740> do<00:01:28.920> now<00:01:29.100> is<00:01:30.140> leave

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
that's what I'm gonna do now is leave

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.460 
that's what I'm gonna do now is leave
the<00:01:31.350> framerate<00:01:31.619> at<00:01:31.920> 15<00:01:32.280> frames<00:01:32.460> per<00:01:32.759> second

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
the framerate at 15 frames per second

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.120 
the framerate at 15 frames per second
copy<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.799> snapshot<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:36.210> paste<00:01:36.659> it<00:01:36.900> for<00:01:37.500> five

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
copy the snapshot and paste it for five

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.030 
copy the snapshot and paste it for five
seconds<00:01:38.670> what<00:01:39.659> that<00:01:39.810> does<00:01:40.020> is<00:01:40.200> it<00:01:40.350> copies<00:01:40.560> a

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
seconds what that does is it copies a

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.700 
seconds what that does is it copies a
single<00:01:41.430> image<00:01:41.670> and<00:01:41.820> pastes<00:01:42.360> it<00:01:42.509> for<00:01:43.500> five

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
single image and pastes it for five

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.350 
single image and pastes it for five
seconds<00:01:44.159> which<00:01:44.369> in<00:01:44.579> this<00:01:44.670> instance<00:01:44.820> is<00:01:45.240> an

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
seconds which in this instance is an

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.080 
seconds which in this instance is an
extra<00:01:45.689> 75<00:01:46.020> frames<00:01:46.560> I'm<00:01:47.549> going<00:01:47.729> to<00:01:47.790> copy<00:01:47.939> it

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
extra 75 frames I'm going to copy it

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.330 
extra 75 frames I'm going to copy it
again<00:01:48.329> and<00:01:48.810> I'm<00:01:49.409> gonna<00:01:49.530> paste<00:01:49.829> it<00:01:49.979> again<00:01:50.040> for

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
again and I'm gonna paste it again for

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.090 
again and I'm gonna paste it again for
another<00:01:50.369> five<00:01:50.549> seconds<00:01:51.180> so<00:01:51.890> that'll<00:01:52.890> bring<00:01:52.979> it

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
another five seconds so that'll bring it

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.649 
another five seconds so that'll bring it
up<00:01:53.189> from<00:01:53.659> 76<00:01:54.659> up<00:01:54.960> to<00:01:55.110> 151

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:56.659 
up from 76 up to 151

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:59.490 
up from 76 up to 151
frames<00:01:57.320> that's<00:01:58.250> ten<00:01:58.520> seconds<00:01:58.939> worth<00:01:59.119> of

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
frames that's ten seconds worth of

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.380 
frames that's ten seconds worth of
animation<00:02:00.500> and<00:02:01.159> one<00:02:01.340> more<00:02:01.490> time<00:02:01.700> another<00:02:02.180> five

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
animation and one more time another five

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.980 
animation and one more time another five
seconds<00:02:02.869> that's<00:02:03.649> going<00:02:03.829> to<00:02:03.920> give<00:02:04.039> me<00:02:04.990> 15

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
seconds that's going to give me 15

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.949 
seconds that's going to give me 15
seconds<00:02:06.590> of<00:02:06.710> animation<00:02:07.450> now<00:02:08.450> I<00:02:08.479> select<00:02:08.720> the

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
image the background image then so now I

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.420 
image the background image then so now I
go<00:02:37.549> click<00:02:38.200> configure<00:02:39.200> chroma<00:02:39.620> and<00:02:39.920> this<00:02:40.310> is

then this chroma key processing might

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.750 
then this chroma key processing might
take<00:03:35.959> a<00:03:35.989> little<00:03:36.139> bit<00:03:36.290> of<00:03:36.440> time<00:03:36.620> but<00:03:37.489> just<00:03:37.670> let

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
take a little bit of time but just let

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.879 
take a little bit of time but just let
it<00:03:37.850> run<00:03:38.000> through<00:03:38.030> and<00:03:38.930> when<00:03:39.319> it's<00:03:39.440> finished

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:39.889 
it run through and when it's finished

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:41.199 
it run through and when it's finished
you'll<00:03:40.069> have<00:03:40.250> the<00:03:40.609> chroma<00:03:40.850> key<00:03:40.940> in<00:03:41.150> the

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209 
you'll have the chroma key in the

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:43.690 
you'll have the chroma key in the
background<00:03:41.630> which<00:03:41.989> is<00:03:42.019> our<00:03:42.380> video<00:03:42.920> stars<00:03:43.579> are

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
background which is our video stars are

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.420 
background which is our video stars are
flying<00:03:43.880> by

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
flying by

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.309 
flying by
you'll<00:03:46.329> notice<00:03:46.540> that<00:03:46.629> when<00:03:46.900> it<00:03:47.019> is<00:03:47.109> finished

00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:47.319 
you'll notice that when it is finished

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:52.830 
you'll notice that when it is finished
you'll<00:03:47.680> see<00:03:48.599> the<00:03:49.599> letter<00:03:49.810> C<00:03:50.549> on<00:03:51.549> the<00:03:52.359> thumbnail

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
you'll see the letter C on the thumbnail

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.599 
you'll see the letter C on the thumbnail
images<00:03:53.849> okay<00:03:54.849> so<00:03:54.969> it's<00:03:55.180> already<00:03:55.450> finished<00:03:55.629> now

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:56.609 
images okay so it's already finished now

00:03:56.609 --> 00:03:59.369 
images okay so it's already finished now
so<00:03:57.609> now<00:03:58.120> we<00:03:58.180> have<00:03:58.390> chroma<00:03:58.689> key<00:03:58.900> video<00:03:59.200> in<00:03:59.319> the

00:03:59.369 --> 00:03:59.379 
so now we have chroma key video in the

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:01.229 
so now we have chroma key video in the
