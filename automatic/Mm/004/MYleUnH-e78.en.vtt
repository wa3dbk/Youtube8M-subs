00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.450
 smart watches are being 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.090
 putting more handsome but attractive 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.260
 since the jim watt sub-20 goes beyond 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.030
 the fisic 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.920
 this is the third watch with android wear 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.950
 that launched the company in less than a year 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.750
 and the most expensive of the collection is also 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:21.060
 the most elegant as you can see with 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.000
 round metal cover in silver or 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.710
 in gold and true leather strap that 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.720
 it is already looking more like a clock 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.579
 traditional but lacks a lot to 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.250
 to be able to compete with the world's rolexes 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:34.620
 the body feels rigid and the leather a 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.899
 little stiff and the contrast of the stitching 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.699
 it does not convince me but maybe I am 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.640
 seeing with critical eyes because 

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:43.890
 clearly it was not designed with doll's 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.109
 woman in mind her screen but LEDs 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.600
 see sharp and well lit and the interface 

00:00:46.109 --> 00:00:50.429
 is controlled by gestures or with the 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.949
 digital crown that is next to 

00:00:50.429 --> 00:00:54.809
 press it to turn on the clock or 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.449
 wake up google now or leave it 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.800
 pressed to see the applications 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:00.870
 has a microphone side to be able 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.420
 dictate the commands and a rhythm sensor 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.420
 heart at the bottom that measures 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.150
 your pulse but no horn inside 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.010
 has a 400 snapdragon processor 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.930
 Latest Android update 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.660
 wear but like the vast majority of 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.760
 smart watches on the market 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:20.550
 ying watch 20 is not completely 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.860
 independent and you will have to download the 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:25.290
 application on your android phone to 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.030
 Once configured set 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.150
 you slide down to see the 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.680
 quick adjustments up to see your 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.930
 notifications and to the left to 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.690
 see your apps you can receive calls 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.270
 dictate send messages or draw emoji 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:41.520
 check the weather see your steps and your 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.530
 Facebook alerts also has 4 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.360
 gigabytes of internal storage for 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.670
 store music without needing 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.670
 phone the bad thing is that the vibrations 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.130
 of the watch are very subtle and it is difficult 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.869
 know when a notification comes in but 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.820
 one of the great advantages of this 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.680
 Android web update is that 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.270
 now you do not always have to carry the 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.119
 phone in your pocket to be able 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.580
 use the watch as long as they are 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:08.009
 connected to a Wi-Fi network and not 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.630
 necessarily it has to be the same 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.310
 battery has also improved in this 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.300
 new version and you stand a day 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.030
 full use 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.819
 if you have the screen in mode or wilson or 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.459
 forever 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:20.769
 or two days if you activate it only when 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:22.689
 you raise the doll there is also is 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:25.299
 Water resistant but not completely 

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:27.370
 submersible elche water bein is one of the 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:29.469
 best android watches to date 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.620
 but it is also one of the most expensive because 

00:02:29.469 --> 00:02:34.359
 you pay for the design 350 dollars for a 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.250
 clock that does practically the same 

00:02:34.359 --> 00:02:38.680
 that the elche watch 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.840
 but in the range of the power would be the 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.139
 cheaper so it depends a lot on your 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.139
 budget
