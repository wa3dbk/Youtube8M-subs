show you a couple of things to basically

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.080 
show you a couple of things to basically
things<00:00:42.900> that<00:00:43.489> really<00:00:44.489> make<00:00:44.790> a<00:00:44.850> difference

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
things that really make a difference

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.720 
things that really make a difference
with<00:00:45.510> your<00:00:45.750> picking<00:00:46.170> one<00:00:46.860> has<00:00:47.100> to<00:00:47.280> do<00:00:47.430> with<00:00:47.640> the

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
with your picking one has to do with the

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.520 
with your picking one has to do with the
motion<00:00:48.150> of<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.360> wrist<00:00:48.540> and<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:49.140> other<00:00:49.290> one<00:00:49.500> is

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
motion of the wrist and the other one is

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.350 
motion of the wrist and the other one is
how<00:00:49.860> you<00:00:49.920> hold<00:00:50.220> the<00:00:50.309> pic<00:00:50.489> in<00:00:50.640> relation<00:00:51.090> to<00:00:51.239> the

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
how you hold the pic in relation to the

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.049 
how you hold the pic in relation to the
strings<00:00:51.720> those<00:00:52.350> are<00:00:52.530> two<00:00:52.739> things<00:00:52.770> that<00:00:53.250> I<00:00:53.730> find

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
strings those are two things that I find

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.380 
strings those are two things that I find
students<00:00:54.750> are<00:00:55.650> challenged<00:00:56.250> with<00:00:56.339> or<00:00:56.790> can

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
students are challenged with or can

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.030 
students are challenged with or can
really<00:00:57.690> improve<00:00:58.170> their<00:00:58.470> picking<00:00:58.800> if<00:00:58.920> they

00:00:59.030 --> 00:00:59.040 
really improve their picking if they

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.880 
really improve their picking if they
work<00:00:59.309> on<00:00:59.489> these<00:00:59.790> two<00:01:00.150> things<00:01:00.570> very<00:01:01.379> critical

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
work on these two things very critical

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.320 
work on these two things very critical
so<00:01:02.309> what<00:01:02.489> I'd<00:01:02.580> like<00:01:02.699> to<00:01:02.760> do<00:01:02.970> is<00:01:03.089> I'm<00:01:03.180> going<00:01:03.269> to

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
the open strings and then practice that

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.259 
the open strings and then practice that
with<00:02:59.650> your<00:02:59.920> finger<00:03:00.280> exercises<00:03:00.760> and<00:03:01.090> if<00:03:01.209> you

thing that you want to do with the pic
remember<00:03:07.989> risk<00:03:08.409> motion<00:03:08.799> and<00:03:08.919> all<00:03:09.040> alternate

picking<00:03:09.700> a<00:03:09.909> person<00:03:10.299> up<00:03:10.389> and<00:03:10.659> down<00:03:10.840> and<00:03:11.139> just

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
picking a person up and down and just

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.690 
picking a person up and down and just
practice<00:03:11.469> on<00:03:11.829> that<00:03:12.010> open<00:03:12.340> strings<00:03:12.669> all<00:03:13.000> right

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
practice on that open strings all right

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.970 
practice on that open strings all right
now<00:03:15.700> the<00:03:15.760> other<00:03:16.030> thing<00:03:16.120> you<00:03:16.359> want<00:03:16.540> to<00:03:16.569> do<00:03:16.980> is

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
now the other thing you want to do is

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.610 
now the other thing you want to do is
the<00:03:18.370> relationship<00:03:18.939> to<00:03:19.389> where<00:03:19.629> the<00:03:19.930> string<00:03:20.379> is

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
the relationship to where the string is

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.920 
the relationship to where the string is
hitting<00:03:21.489> the<00:03:21.909> pic<00:03:22.209> okay<00:03:23.250> I<00:03:24.250> like<00:03:25.090> to<00:03:25.120> angle<00:03:25.900> the

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
hitting the pic okay I like to angle the

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.069 
hitting the pic okay I like to angle the
pic<00:03:26.379> slightly<00:03:27.340> to<00:03:27.519> the<00:03:27.549> strings<00:03:28.030> okay<00:03:28.840> and

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:29.079 
pic slightly to the strings okay and

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:31.170 
pic slightly to the strings okay and
you'll<00:03:29.859> find<00:03:30.159> that<00:03:30.340> that's<00:03:30.489> going<00:03:30.730> to<00:03:30.790> cut

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
you'll find that that's going to cut

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.209 
you'll find that that's going to cut
through<00:03:31.419> the<00:03:31.629> strings<00:03:31.959> better<00:03:32.409> and<00:03:32.680> give<00:03:33.010> you

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:33.219 
through the strings better and give you

00:03:33.219 --> 00:03:38.009 
through the strings better and give you
more<00:03:34.439> control<00:03:35.439> and<00:03:36.250> the<00:03:36.819> pic<00:03:37.449> won't<00:03:37.629> get<00:03:37.840> hung

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.019 
more control and the pic won't get hung

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:39.629 
more control and the pic won't get hung
up<00:03:38.139> because<00:03:38.290> it's<00:03:38.560> less<00:03:38.769> friction<00:03:39.099> now<00:03:39.579> you

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:39.639 
up because it's less friction now you

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:41.369 
up because it's less friction now you
don't<00:03:39.969> want<00:03:40.209> to<00:03:40.269> take<00:03:40.419> the<00:03:40.449> pic<00:03:40.750> vertically

00:03:41.369 --> 00:03:41.379 
don't want to take the pic vertically

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:42.809 
don't want to take the pic vertically
because<00:03:41.530> then<00:03:41.769> you're<00:03:41.889> not<00:03:42.010> going<00:03:42.189> to<00:03:42.340> get

00:03:42.809 --> 00:03:42.819 
because then you're not going to get

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:44.550 
because then you're not going to get
that's<00:03:43.509> going<00:03:43.659> to<00:03:43.720> cut<00:03:43.900> too<00:03:43.989> much<00:03:44.019> of<00:03:44.259> the<00:03:44.349> tone

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
that's going to cut too much of the tone

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.550 
that's going to cut too much of the tone
out<00:03:44.739> but<00:03:45.099> I'm<00:03:45.189> talking<00:03:45.519> about<00:03:45.579> maybe<00:03:45.879> a<00:03:46.030> slight

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
out but I'm talking about maybe a slight

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.860 
out but I'm talking about maybe a slight
45<00:03:47.560> degree<00:03:47.859> angle<00:03:48.159> up<00:03:48.310> or<00:03:48.609> down<00:03:49.090> if<00:03:49.540> this<00:03:49.750> is

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
45 degree angle up or down if this is

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:51.629 
45 degree angle up or down if this is
the<00:03:49.900> string<00:03:50.319> just<00:03:50.799> to<00:03:50.889> give<00:03:51.009> you<00:03:51.099> a<00:03:51.129> close<00:03:51.370> look

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:51.639 
the string just to give you a close look

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:55.020 
the string just to give you a close look
instead<00:03:52.419> of<00:03:52.659> picking<00:03:53.349> would<00:03:54.250> you<00:03:54.370> pick<00:03:54.609> dead

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
instead of picking would you pick dead

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:58.649 
instead of picking would you pick dead
on<00:03:55.239> like<00:03:55.989> this<00:03:56.340> I'm<00:03:57.340> talking<00:03:57.729> about<00:03:57.819> angling

00:03:58.649 --> 00:03:58.659 
on like this I'm talking about angling

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:00.929 
on like this I'm talking about angling
the<00:03:58.900> pic<00:03:59.139> to<00:03:59.530> the<00:03:59.650> string<00:04:00.009> so<00:04:00.489> it's<00:04:00.669> kind<00:04:00.879> of

00:04:00.929 --> 00:04:00.939 
the pic to the string so it's kind of

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:03.929 
the pic to the string so it's kind of
slicing<00:04:01.840> through<00:04:02.220> now<00:04:03.220> you<00:04:03.280> could<00:04:03.579> angle<00:04:03.819> it

00:04:03.929 --> 00:04:03.939 
slicing through now you could angle it

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:08.069 
slicing through now you could angle it
this<00:04:04.120> way<00:04:04.359> or<00:04:04.599> this<00:04:05.530> way<00:04:06.000> okay<00:04:07.000> either<00:04:07.239> way<00:04:07.479> but

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:08.079 
this way or this way okay either way but

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:11.699 
this way or this way okay either way but
I'm<00:04:08.229> talking<00:04:08.590> having<00:04:08.859> that<00:04:09.040> maybe<00:04:10.259> 45<00:04:11.259> degree

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:11.709 
I'm talking having that maybe 45 degree

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:15.179 
I'm talking having that maybe 45 degree
angle<00:04:12.099> not<00:04:12.489> straight<00:04:12.879> on<00:04:13.689> but<00:04:14.259> angle<00:04:14.859> the<00:04:14.949> pic

00:04:15.179 --> 00:04:15.189 
angle not straight on but angle the pic

00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:17.490 
angle not straight on but angle the pic
to<00:04:15.400> the<00:04:15.549> string<00:04:15.970> and<00:04:16.209> you<00:04:16.900> will<00:04:17.049> see<00:04:17.320> that

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 
to the string and you will see that

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.830 
to the string and you will see that
really<00:04:17.829> cuts<00:04:18.250> through<00:04:18.489> now<00:04:19.180> if<00:04:19.299> I<00:04:19.359> take<00:04:19.389> you<00:04:19.599> up

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
really cuts through now if I take you up

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.899 
really cuts through now if I take you up
real<00:04:20.049> close<00:04:20.349> let<00:04:21.099> me<00:04:21.159> see<00:04:21.310> if<00:04:21.400> you<00:04:21.459> could<00:04:21.579> see

00:04:21.899 --> 00:04:21.909 
real close let me see if you could see

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:24.360 
real close let me see if you could see
this<00:04:22.500> I'm<00:04:23.500> going<00:04:23.710> to<00:04:23.770> pull<00:04:23.949> back<00:04:24.130> on<00:04:24.340> the

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
hung up I take it and I angle it now I

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.550 
hung up I take it and I angle it now I
like<00:04:33.039> to<00:04:33.070> a<00:04:33.190> glit<00:04:33.699> this<00:04:34.419> way<00:04:34.690> some<00:04:35.380> of<00:04:35.469> my

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
like to a glit this way some of my

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.100 
like to a glit this way some of my
students<00:04:35.979> like<00:04:36.490> to<00:04:36.669> angle<00:04:37.060> it<00:04:37.150> this<00:04:37.570> way<00:04:37.840> and

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
students like to angle it this way and

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.290 
students like to angle it this way and
that's<00:04:38.289> fine<00:04:38.650> but<00:04:39.159> try<00:04:39.490> this<00:04:39.550> you're<00:04:40.030> really

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.300 
that's fine but try this you're really

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.510 
that's fine but try this you're really
going<00:04:40.419> to<00:04:40.479> see<00:04:40.690> a<00:04:40.719> huge<00:04:41.169> difference<00:04:41.370> take<00:04:42.370> that

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520 
going to see a huge difference take that

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.969 
going to see a huge difference take that
pic<00:04:42.820> angle<00:04:43.570> it<00:04:43.690> to<00:04:43.810> the<00:04:43.900> strings<00:04:44.229> not<00:04:44.650> at<00:04:44.919> a

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:44.979 
pic angle it to the strings not at a

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:47.490 
pic angle it to the strings not at a
test<00:04:45.550> and<00:04:45.789> a<00:04:45.880> 90<00:04:46.300> because<00:04:46.900> then<00:04:47.110> you're<00:04:47.289> not

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:47.500 
test and a 90 because then you're not

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:48.990 
test and a 90 because then you're not
going<00:04:47.680> to<00:04:47.740> hear<00:04:47.949> the<00:04:48.010> note<00:04:48.279> ring<00:04:48.490> out<00:04:48.610> as<00:04:48.789> well

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.330 
going to hear the note ring out as well
just<00:04:49.479> take<00:04:49.719> it<00:04:49.900> and<00:04:50.050> slight<00:04:50.500> angle<00:04:50.740> and<00:04:51.070> it's

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:51.340 
just take it and slight angle and it's

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:52.230 
just take it and slight angle and it's
going<00:04:51.490> to<00:04:51.550> cut<00:04:51.729> through

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 
going to cut through

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.249 
going to cut through

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:08.590 
choke down a little bit more and here's

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:10.260 
choke down a little bit more and here's
a<00:05:08.650> really<00:05:08.889> good<00:05:09.220> I'm<00:05:09.460> going<00:05:09.610> to<00:05:09.669> pull<00:05:09.849> back<00:05:10.030> on

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:10.270 
a really good I'm going to pull back on

a really good I'm going to pull back on
the<00:05:10.300> picture<00:05:10.599> so<00:05:10.690> you<00:05:10.750> could<00:05:10.870> see<00:05:11.080> this<00:05:11.229> not

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:12.190 
the picture so you could see this not

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:15.629 
the picture so you could see this not
straight<00:05:12.789> on<00:05:13.380> see<00:05:14.380> because<00:05:14.560> I<00:05:14.889> can't<00:05:15.340> even<00:05:15.460> do

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:15.639 
straight on see because I can't even do

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:18.770 
straight on see because I can't even do
it<00:05:15.759> really<00:05:15.880> really<00:05:16.000> fast<00:05:16.509> straight<00:05:16.960> on

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:18.780 
it really really fast straight on

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:20.879 
it really really fast straight on
because<00:05:19.780> after<00:05:19.900> a<00:05:20.050> while<00:05:20.080> I<00:05:20.199> get<00:05:20.440> hung<00:05:20.590> up<00:05:20.710> with

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:20.889 
because after a while I get hung up with

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:23.029 
because after a while I get hung up with
the<00:05:20.949> friction<00:05:21.370> but<00:05:21.759> if<00:05:21.849> I<00:05:21.940> try<00:05:22.180> to<00:05:22.210> do<00:05:22.449> it<00:05:22.599> and

00:05:23.029 --> 00:05:23.039 
the friction but if I try to do it and

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:30.559 
the friction but if I try to do it and
angle<00:05:24.039> the<00:05:24.069> pic<00:05:26.400> see<00:05:27.400> the<00:05:27.490> wrist<00:05:27.669> motion

00:05:30.559 --> 00:05:30.569 

00:05:30.569 --> 00:05:32.930 

that's<00:05:31.569> what<00:05:31.690> you<00:05:31.780> want<00:05:31.930> to<00:05:32.050> concentrate<00:05:32.740> on
