so<00:00:05.230> just<00:00:05.440> check<00:00:05.560> out<00:00:05.740> the<00:00:05.830> base<00:00:06.040> a<00:00:06.400> lot<00:00:06.790> of

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:06.940 
so just check out the base a lot of

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:08.520 
so just check out the base a lot of
there's<00:00:07.090> just<00:00:07.150> a<00:00:07.390> visual<00:00:07.780> inspection<00:00:08.349> and

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:08.530 
there's just a visual inspection and

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:10.409 
there's just a visual inspection and
just<00:00:09.070> kind<00:00:09.250> of<00:00:09.280> run<00:00:09.460> your<00:00:09.550> hand<00:00:09.820> over<00:00:09.940> air<00:00:10.240> and

00:00:10.409 --> 00:00:10.419 
just kind of run your hand over air and

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:13.110 
just kind of run your hand over air and
see<00:00:10.629> if<00:00:11.379> you<00:00:11.620> have<00:00:11.799> any<00:00:11.950> really<00:00:12.249> big<00:00:12.400> gouges

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:13.120 
see if you have any really big gouges

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.199 
see if you have any really big gouges
core<00:00:13.809> shots<00:00:14.400> anything<00:00:15.400> like<00:00:15.549> that<00:00:15.579> because<00:00:15.879> if

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:16.209 
core shots anything like that because if

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:17.359 
core shots anything like that because if
it's<00:00:16.390> bad<00:00:16.600> enough

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
it's bad enough

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.859 
it's bad enough
believe<00:00:18.369> it<00:00:18.490> allowed<00:00:18.699> if<00:00:18.820> you<00:00:19.119> have<00:00:19.330> a<00:00:19.359> deep

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:19.869 
believe it allowed if you have a deep

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:21.660 
believe it allowed if you have a deep
enough<00:00:20.080> core<00:00:20.349> shot<00:00:20.590> it<00:00:20.740> can<00:00:21.160> actually<00:00:21.460> act

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:21.670 
enough core shot it can actually act

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:24.390 
enough core shot it can actually act
like<00:00:21.699> a<00:00:21.820> suction<00:00:22.119> cup<00:00:22.390> keeping<00:00:22.810> you<00:00:23.400> suction

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:24.400 
like a suction cup keeping you suction

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.970 
like a suction cup keeping you suction
to<00:00:24.699> the<00:00:24.820> snow<00:00:25.060> slowing<00:00:25.570> it<00:00:25.660> down<00:00:25.689> and<00:00:25.839> snow<00:00:26.800> is

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:26.980 
to the snow slowing it down and snow is

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.759 
to the snow slowing it down and snow is
never<00:00:27.220> good<00:00:27.990> or<00:00:28.990> they<00:00:29.169> could<00:00:29.320> even<00:00:29.349> I<00:00:29.589> think

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:29.769 
never good or they could even I think

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:31.769 
never good or they could even I think
runners<00:00:30.189> depending<00:00:30.699> on<00:00:30.820> on<00:00:31.210> how<00:00:31.419> bad<00:00:31.630> the

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:31.779 
runners depending on on how bad the

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:34.979 
runners depending on on how bad the
gouges<00:00:32.230> so<00:00:32.439> go<00:00:33.160> through<00:00:33.329> if<00:00:34.329> something<00:00:34.690> is<00:00:34.780> bad

00:00:34.979 --> 00:00:34.989 
gouges so go through if something is bad

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:38.400 
gouges so go through if something is bad
enough<00:00:35.969> you<00:00:36.969> got<00:00:37.030> some<00:00:37.270> ptex<00:00:37.660> clear<00:00:38.230> or<00:00:38.379> black

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:38.410 
enough you got some ptex clear or black

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.319 
enough you got some ptex clear or black
I<00:00:38.829> usually<00:00:39.160> use<00:00:39.250> clear<00:00:39.579> depending<00:00:40.120> on<00:00:40.210> what

00:00:40.319 --> 00:00:40.329 
I usually use clear depending on what

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:42.569 
I usually use clear depending on what
type<00:00:40.480> of<00:00:40.510> base<00:00:40.719> you<00:00:40.870> have<00:00:41.039> you<00:00:42.039> obviously<00:00:42.370> need

00:00:42.569 --> 00:00:42.579 
type of base you have you obviously need

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:45.720 
type of base you have you obviously need
some<00:00:43.420> fire<00:00:43.719> and<00:00:44.170> I<00:00:44.980> like<00:00:45.219> to<00:00:45.309> use<00:00:45.340> a<00:00:45.460> metal

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:45.730 
some fire and I like to use a metal

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:47.610 
some fire and I like to use a metal
scraper<00:00:46.000> to<00:00:46.690> actually<00:00:46.989> keep<00:00:47.109> the<00:00:47.230> size<00:00:47.440> of<00:00:47.559> the

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:47.620 
scraper to actually keep the size of the

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:48.900 
scraper to actually keep the size of the
flame<00:00:47.829> a<00:00:47.859> little<00:00:47.980> smaller<00:00:48.460> because<00:00:48.579> I<00:00:48.760> don't

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:48.910 
flame a little smaller because I don't

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.990 
flame a little smaller because I don't
like<00:00:49.000> it<00:00:49.120> burning<00:00:49.480> too<00:00:49.600> hot<00:00:50.520> so<00:00:51.520> we<00:00:51.850> got<00:00:51.969> a

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:52.000 
like it burning too hot so we got a

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.700 
like it burning too hot so we got a
couple<00:00:52.149> spots<00:00:52.480> here<00:00:52.780> that<00:00:52.960> I'm<00:00:53.140> gonna<00:00:53.350> go

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:53.710 
couple spots here that I'm gonna go

00:00:53.710 --> 00:01:13.469 
couple spots here that I'm gonna go
ahead<00:00:53.859> and<00:00:54.359> and<00:00:56.100> surgically<00:00:57.100> repair<00:00:57.519> so

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:13.479 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:16.950 

get<00:01:14.080> it<00:01:14.200> burn<00:01:14.409> him<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:16.330> it'll<00:01:16.540> start<00:01:16.780> with<00:01:16.930> a

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
get it burn him and it'll start with a

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.280 
get it burn him and it'll start with a
nice<00:01:17.200> blue<00:01:17.470> flame<00:01:17.830> and<00:01:18.720> that's<00:01:19.720> how<00:01:19.960> I<00:01:19.990> wait<00:01:20.170> to

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:20.290 
nice blue flame and that's how I wait to

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:22.289 
nice blue flame and that's how I wait to
keep<00:01:20.439> it<00:01:20.619> I<00:01:20.680> don't<00:01:20.710> wait<00:01:20.950> to<00:01:21.100> get<00:01:21.220> it<00:01:21.369> have<00:01:22.180> it

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:22.299 
keep it I don't wait to get it have it

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:27.570 
keep it I don't wait to get it have it
burn<00:01:22.509> too<00:01:22.979> too<00:01:23.979> big<00:01:24.250> or<00:01:24.460> too<00:01:24.490> hot<00:01:26.250> so<00:01:27.250> just<00:01:27.280> kind

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:27.580 
burn too too big or too hot so just kind

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.399 
burn too too big or too hot so just kind
of<00:01:27.610> get<00:01:27.759> it<00:01:27.880> going<00:01:27.909> I<00:01:28.360> like<00:01:28.780> to<00:01:28.930> use<00:01:29.049> a<00:01:29.080> metal

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:29.409 
of get it going I like to use a metal

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:35.160 
of get it going I like to use a metal
scraper<00:01:33.360> to<00:01:34.360> actually<00:01:34.600> keep<00:01:34.690> the<00:01:34.840> size<00:01:35.020> of<00:01:35.110> the

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
scraper to actually keep the size of the

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:42.960 
scraper to actually keep the size of the
flame<00:01:35.350> down<00:01:35.590> just<00:01:35.950> not<00:01:36.070> that<00:01:36.310> small<00:01:41.880> since<00:01:42.880> I

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:42.970 
flame down just not that small since I

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:44.249 
flame down just not that small since I
just<00:01:43.180> had<00:01:43.330> it<00:01:43.450> going<00:01:43.689> right<00:01:43.869> there<00:01:44.049> I'm<00:01:44.140> just

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:44.259 
just had it going right there I'm just

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:46.770 
just had it going right there I'm just
gonna<00:01:44.409> rely<00:01:44.710> at<00:01:44.770> the<00:01:44.860> same<00:01:45.070> spot<00:01:45.569> usually<00:01:46.569> once

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
gonna rely at the same spot usually once

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.320 
gonna rely at the same spot usually once
I<00:01:46.899> blow<00:01:47.020> it<00:01:47.229> out<00:01:47.319> when<00:01:47.470> I'm<00:01:47.560> done<00:01:48.330> I'll

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:49.330 
I blow it out when I'm done I'll

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.020 
I blow it out when I'm done I'll
actually<00:01:49.509> snip<00:01:49.899> this<00:01:50.050> end<00:01:50.259> off<00:01:50.409> because<00:01:50.789> as<00:01:51.789> it

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
actually snip this end off because as it

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:53.340 
actually snip this end off because as it
was<00:01:52.149> burning<00:01:52.390> it<00:01:52.600> was<00:01:52.690> already<00:01:52.840> starting<00:01:53.319> to

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
was burning it was already starting to

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.480 
was burning it was already starting to
go<00:01:53.470> through<00:01:53.710> some<00:01:53.860> chemical<00:01:54.280> reactions<00:01:54.789> which

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
go through some chemical reactions which

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.830 
go through some chemical reactions which
can<00:01:57.490> lessen<00:01:57.729> the<00:01:57.909> integrity<00:01:58.330> of<00:01:58.390> the<00:01:58.479> p-tech

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
can lessen the integrity of the p-tech

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.499 
can lessen the integrity of the p-tech
so<00:01:59.080> I'll<00:01:59.380> just<00:01:59.530> snip<00:01:59.770> off<00:01:59.950> the<00:02:00.009> end<00:02:00.330> that<00:02:01.330> was

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:01.509 
so I'll just snip off the end that was

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:08.309 
so I'll just snip off the end that was
burnt<00:02:01.780> before

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:08.319 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:15.360 

all<00:02:08.859> right<00:02:10.290> so<00:02:11.290> find<00:02:11.530> your<00:02:11.650> spots<00:02:11.950> I<00:02:14.219> asked<00:02:15.219> you

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
all right so find your spots I asked you

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.280 
all right so find your spots I asked you
run<00:02:15.609> it<00:02:15.700> right<00:02:15.999> on<00:02:16.180> the<00:02:16.299> base<00:02:19.109> which<00:02:20.109> also

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
run it right on the base which also

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:41.650 
run it right on the base which also
helps<00:02:20.739> keep<00:02:20.889> the<00:02:22.319> size<00:02:23.319> of<00:02:23.469> the<00:02:23.530> flame<00:02:23.739> down

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.070 

Jenny<00:02:42.290> point<00:02:42.620> around<00:02:42.860> some<00:02:43.160> rocks<00:02:43.370> here<00:02:44.080> it's

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
Jenny point around some rocks here it's

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.040 
Jenny point around some rocks here it's
funny<00:02:45.320> when<00:02:45.500> we're<00:02:45.650> out<00:02:45.800> there<00:02:45.950> run<00:02:46.840> if<00:02:47.840> she

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.050 
funny when we're out there run if she

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:52.560 
funny when we're out there run if she
hits<00:02:48.260> anything<00:02:48.530> I<00:02:48.890> was<00:02:49.190> here<00:02:49.400> whoops<00:02:49.880> I

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.570 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:03:21.900 

usually<00:02:53.570> know<00:02:53.630> what<00:02:53.720> that<00:02:53.900> means

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.420 

a<00:03:22.030> couple<00:03:22.870> nice<00:03:23.020> gashes<00:03:23.470> here<00:03:23.650> nothing<00:03:24.280> too

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
a couple nice gashes here nothing too

00:03:24.430 --> 00:04:10.630 
a couple nice gashes here nothing too
bad

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:10.640 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:15.230 

all<00:04:11.640> right<00:04:11.820> we'll<00:04:11.970> get<00:04:12.090> the<00:04:12.150> girl<00:04:14.150> believe<00:04:15.150> it

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:15.240 
all right we'll get the girl believe it

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:17.390 
all right we'll get the girl believe it
or<00:04:15.300> not<00:04:15.500> the<00:04:16.500> ones<00:04:16.680> that<00:04:16.800> I<00:04:16.830> already<00:04:17.040> did<00:04:17.310> in

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
or not the ones that I already did in

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.900 
or not the ones that I already did in
the<00:04:17.459> beginning<00:04:17.760> are<00:04:18.510> probably<00:04:19.020> already<00:04:19.200> dry

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
the beginning are probably already dry

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:22.520 
the beginning are probably already dry
so<00:04:20.910> very<00:04:21.420> carefully<00:04:21.810> one<00:04:21.989> be<00:04:22.080> careful<00:04:22.110> in<00:04:22.470> a

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
so very carefully one be careful in a

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.920 
so very carefully one be careful in a
metal<00:04:22.740> scraper<00:04:23.100> be<00:04:24.000> aware<00:04:24.210> of<00:04:24.300> the<00:04:24.390> edges<00:04:24.750> so

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
metal scraper be aware of the edges so

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.080 
metal scraper be aware of the edges so
that<00:04:24.960> as<00:04:25.230> you<00:04:25.410> start<00:04:25.650> really<00:04:26.550> scraping<00:04:27.000> or

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
that as you start really scraping or

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.210 
that as you start really scraping or
leveling<00:04:27.420> out<00:04:27.540> what<00:04:28.350> you're<00:04:28.470> just<00:04:28.650> ptex<00:04:29.070> you

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
leveling out what you're just ptex you

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.090 
leveling out what you're just ptex you
don't<00:04:29.400> start<00:04:29.580> digging<00:04:29.850> into<00:04:30.000> your<00:04:30.740> your<00:04:31.740> base

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:32.100 
don't start digging into your your base

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:35.660 
don't start digging into your your base
elsewhere<00:04:32.610> so<00:04:33.380> nice<00:04:34.380> angle<00:04:34.800> I<00:04:34.980> like<00:04:35.550> to

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:35.670 
elsewhere so nice angle I like to

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:37.790 
elsewhere so nice angle I like to
actually<00:04:36.150> pull<00:04:36.900> away<00:04:37.020> from<00:04:37.350> you<00:04:37.470> rather<00:04:37.620> than

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
actually pull away from you rather than

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.730 
actually pull away from you rather than
digging<00:04:38.760> out<00:04:38.940> a<00:04:38.970> really<00:04:39.210> sharp<00:04:39.420> angle<00:04:39.840> there's

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
digging out a really sharp angle there's

00:04:40.740 --> 00:07:09.330 
digging out a really sharp angle there's
a<00:04:40.830> shape<00:04:41.100> down<00:04:41.310> a<00:04:41.370> little<00:04:41.580> bit<00:04:41.790> of<00:04:41.850> the<00:04:41.910> time

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:09.340 

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:12.160 

that's<00:07:10.340> it<00:07:10.490> we're<00:07:10.640> good<00:07:10.760> to<00:07:10.820> go<00:07:10.870> on<00:07:11.870> to<00:07:12.080> the

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:12.170 
that's it we're good to go on to the

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:14.680 
that's it we're good to go on to the
next<00:07:12.380> page<00:07:12.650> face<00:07:13.400> cleaning<00:07:13.880> and<00:07:14.060> then<00:07:14.270> we<00:07:14.480> will

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:14.690 
next page face cleaning and then we will

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:17.710 
next page face cleaning and then we will
ha<00:07:15.500> twice
