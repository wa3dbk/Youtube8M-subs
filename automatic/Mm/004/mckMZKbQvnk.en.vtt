 you to me 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.440
 the outside 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.220
 at the palace 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.200

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:12.540
 plug kill on 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.180
 you 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:25.819
 I 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.549
 opera 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:43.350
 well what can I say guys there for 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:45.510
 Scenes viewed here you can see 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:49.110
 do not even discuss but if such a reaction 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:52.590
 You have Viktor Volter forgive me but we 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:56.070
 just have to start a discussion with Igor 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:58.530
 matvienko suited me or not 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:01.380
 it seemed but the only person to whom 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.040
 apparently did not like it Igor possible 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:06.260
 Igorevich 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:09.360
 No, I mean, this is one of the most 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:12.510
 talented electronic groups in our 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:15.000
 country is the first second 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:17.790
 so I understand the beast why they still 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:22.070
 at the moment not removed yet 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:24.660
 other performers in the electronic style 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:27.660
 because here the notion of form and 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:30.169
 content yes here is the form you have it 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:35.050
 prevail over content 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:38.139
 it is now a purely design story but 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:39.370
 I see the potential caused by make find 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:41.699
 that song 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:44.889
 which is about to break the charts will break 

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:47.460
 In general, everything and you will get it in heroes 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:52.840
 thank you thank you 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:56.080
 konstantin meladze musicians you are big 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:57.759
 but the question is why are you still 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:00.210
 actually really like 

00:04:57.759 --> 00:05:02.860
 said igor did not push up to carry 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:03.400
 other stars and did not become in the charts that 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:05.080
 called 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:09.039
 and the point is that he will not be with you yet 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:11.680
 songs even winning stock competition you don't 

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:14.440
 become real big tour 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:16.930
 frame and stars, I really wish you 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:19.539
 you got the next song 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:21.490
 Crimea time thank you such a song 

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:23.139
 well, do you know guys? 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:23.680
 Matvienko says about it and Konstantin 

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:26.680
 meladze 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:28.900
 but above all our mentors do not need 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:30.969
 forget about it is the coolest 5 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:32.620
 composers in our country and in 

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:36.569
 united states case with wolter 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:38.770
 Afanasy perhaps this is your last chance 

00:05:36.569 --> 00:05:42.250
 I suggest you just close the ranks 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:44.620
 make pitying faces we are young 

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:47.380
 group we have no repertoire 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:50.289
 they themselves will write a song named 

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:52.810
 nobody will write anything we them nothing 

00:05:50.289 --> 00:05:54.699
 started to treat is not different they have not 

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:56.650
 there is potential they themselves are fine 

00:05:54.699 --> 00:06:00.000
 well, let's hope then 

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:02.580
 thank you for seeing this in us 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.139
 they really need a song 

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:08.560
 I don't know why the wolter is this ballad 

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:11.259
 He gave not to them, but Julia is now a bath as they gave 

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:13.430
 pressed any button and i'm sure 

00:06:11.259 --> 00:06:15.440
 even this song 

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:20.330
 their performance would have been some kind of miracle 

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:23.320
 By the way, try it nice that there are all 

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:27.050
 different contests that sometimes take place 

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:30.050
 don't find such guys and we found we 

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:32.900
 write a song I'm sure the games 

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:36.560
 Matvienko shocked, we will write Peter 

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:39.620
 song and problems will be only one as 

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:41.830

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:14.060
 sing and suddenly you go to another place 

00:07:09.509 --> 00:07:16.169
 and it's so cool when you go for 

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:16.800
 a musician, that is, you do n't know where he is 

00:07:16.169 --> 00:07:21.389
