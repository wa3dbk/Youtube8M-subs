comes with reaching over a fire so you

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.609 
comes with reaching over a fire so you

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
can pivot that out you can raise it up

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.280

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.560 
and adjust the level that you want to
cook<00:01:19.439> at<00:01:19.680> and<00:01:20.430> you<00:01:20.580> do<00:01:20.729> that<00:01:20.880> by<00:01:21.119> adding<00:01:21.299> this

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
cook at and you do that by adding this

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.969 
cook at and you do that by adding this
this<00:01:22.530> adjustment<00:01:23.520> pin<00:01:23.670> that<00:01:23.880> we<00:01:23.939> have<00:01:24.150> here<00:01:24.979> we

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
this adjustment pin that we have here we

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.320 
this adjustment pin that we have here we
have<00:01:26.100> one<00:01:26.369> adjustment<00:01:26.640> that<00:01:26.909> takes<00:01:27.119> it<00:01:27.240> to

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
have one adjustment that takes it to

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.420 
have one adjustment that takes it to
that<00:01:27.509> height<00:01:27.720> and<00:01:28.080> then<00:01:28.860> we<00:01:28.979> have<00:01:29.100> another<00:01:29.189> one

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
that height and then we have another one

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.840 
that height and then we have another one
that<00:01:29.549> takes<00:01:29.850> it<00:01:29.939> even<00:01:30.030> higher<00:01:31.490> so<00:01:32.490> you're<00:01:32.700> able

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
that takes it even higher so you're able

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.190 
that takes it even higher so you're able
to<00:01:33.000> control<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.509> amount<00:01:33.689> of<00:01:33.810> heat<00:01:33.960> that<00:01:33.990> you

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
to control the amount of heat that you

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.200 
to control the amount of heat that you
get<00:01:34.350> on<00:01:34.439> your<00:01:34.590> food<00:01:34.829> and<00:01:35.040> then<00:01:35.579> if<00:01:35.790> you<00:01:35.909> wanted

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
get on your food and then if you wanted

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.819 
get on your food and then if you wanted
to<00:01:36.299> just<00:01:36.509> have<00:01:36.689> it<00:01:36.720> as<00:01:36.900> a<00:01:36.930> fire<00:01:37.229> pit<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:37.710> not

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
to just have it as a fire pit and not

to<00:02:05.539> your<00:02:05.659> ash<00:02:05.780> Bash<00:02:06.049> is<00:02:06.289> you<00:02:06.380> want<00:02:06.560> to<00:02:06.649> try<00:02:07.520> to

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:07.579 
to your ash Bash is you want to try to

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:09.969 
to your ash Bash is you want to try to
create<00:02:07.880> a<00:02:07.969> little<00:02:08.119> bit<00:02:08.269> of<00:02:08.390> a<00:02:08.479> barrier<00:02:08.979> that

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
create a little bit of a barrier that

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.220 
create a little bit of a barrier that
will<00:02:10.160> allow<00:02:10.459> for<00:02:10.489> airflow<00:02:11.150> and<00:02:11.480> the<00:02:11.540> reason

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
will allow for airflow and the reason

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:13.690 
will allow for airflow and the reason
why<00:02:12.349> that<00:02:12.620> you'll<00:02:12.739> see<00:02:12.920> here<00:02:13.130> in<00:02:13.190> a<00:02:13.250> minute<00:02:13.400> is

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
why that you'll see here in a minute is

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.910 
why that you'll see here in a minute is
there's<00:02:14.239> actually<00:02:14.629> some<00:02:14.840> some<00:02:15.319> holes<00:02:15.620> all

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
there's actually some some holes all

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.620 
there's actually some some holes all
around<00:02:16.220> the<00:02:16.340> base<00:02:16.489> of<00:02:16.700> the<00:02:16.790> ash<00:02:16.940> bash<00:02:17.269> which<00:02:17.540> is

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
around the base of the ash bash which is

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.020 
around the base of the ash bash which is
going<00:02:17.750> to<00:02:17.810> allow<00:02:18.049> air<00:02:18.319> to<00:02:18.349> come<00:02:18.709> underneath

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
going to allow air to come underneath

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.640 
going to allow air to come underneath
your<00:02:20.030> fuel<00:02:20.299> source<00:02:20.599> and<00:02:20.750> then<00:02:20.900> go<00:02:21.049> directly<00:02:21.230> up

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
your fuel source and then go directly up

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.710 
your fuel source and then go directly up
so<00:02:21.799> that's<00:02:21.950> going<00:02:22.040> to<00:02:22.099> cut<00:02:22.250> down<00:02:22.280> on<00:02:22.489> smoke<00:02:22.790> and

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
so that's going to cut down on smoke and

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.870 
so that's going to cut down on smoke and
make<00:02:23.989> for<00:02:24.230> a<00:02:24.260> more<00:02:24.440> peaceful<00:02:24.860> and<00:02:25.010> efficient

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
make for a more peaceful and efficient

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.449 
make for a more peaceful and efficient
fire<00:02:26.349> so<00:02:27.349> will<00:02:27.799> now<00:02:27.920> show<00:02:28.099> you<00:02:28.160> kind<00:02:28.370> of<00:02:28.400> the

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
that come with the ash bash this is the

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:42.910 
that come with the ash bash this is the
chrome-plated<00:02:41.780> grill<00:02:42.319> this<00:02:42.470> is<00:02:42.530> going<00:02:42.739> to<00:02:42.799> go

chrome-plated grill this is going to go

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.080 
chrome-plated grill this is going to go
on<00:02:43.040> the<00:02:43.160> top<00:02:43.370> this<00:02:43.610> is<00:02:43.670> what<00:02:43.790> you'll<00:02:44.030> actually

the grill you're actually going to use

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:09.580 
the grill you're actually going to use
to<00:03:07.579> cook<00:03:07.730> with<00:03:08.139> one<00:03:09.139> of<00:03:09.230> the<00:03:09.290> things<00:03:09.470> you'll

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
to cook with one of the things you'll

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.199 
to cook with one of the things you'll
notice<00:03:09.680> about<00:03:09.889> the<00:03:10.040> ash<00:03:10.190> Bash<00:03:10.489> is<00:03:10.790> these<00:03:10.970> holes

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
notice about the ash Bash is these holes

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:14.110 
notice about the ash Bash is these holes
around<00:03:11.569> the<00:03:11.780> bottom<00:03:12.139> this<00:03:13.100> is<00:03:13.280> to<00:03:13.459> maximize

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
around the bottom this is to maximize

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.330 
around the bottom this is to maximize
the<00:03:14.299> airflow<00:03:14.690> so<00:03:14.930> first<00:03:15.889> of<00:03:15.980> all<00:03:16.040> makes<00:03:16.250> it

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
the airflow so first of all makes it

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:17.559 
the airflow so first of all makes it
more<00:03:16.430> efficient<00:03:16.910> but<00:03:17.030> one<00:03:17.209> of<00:03:17.239> the<00:03:17.359> biggest

00:03:17.559 --> 00:03:17.569 
more efficient but one of the biggest

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:20.319 
more efficient but one of the biggest
features<00:03:18.500> that<00:03:18.680> it<00:03:18.829> allows<00:03:19.549> is<00:03:19.910> for<00:03:20.120> less

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:20.329 
features that it allows is for less

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:22.780 
features that it allows is for less
smoke<00:03:20.750> so<00:03:21.500> this<00:03:21.680> these<00:03:22.010> holes<00:03:22.250> actually<00:03:22.459> allow

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
smoke so this these holes actually allow

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:24.550 
smoke so this these holes actually allow
for<00:03:22.819> greater<00:03:23.209> airflow<00:03:23.660> and<00:03:23.840> that<00:03:24.049> reduces<00:03:24.350> the

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
for greater airflow and that reduces the

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:25.599 
for greater airflow and that reduces the
amount<00:03:24.739> of<00:03:24.829> smoke<00:03:25.130> so<00:03:25.340> when<00:03:25.459> you're<00:03:25.579> out

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:25.609 
amount of smoke so when you're out

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:28.120 
amount of smoke so when you're out
enjoying<00:03:26.480> your<00:03:26.720> fire<00:03:26.959> you<00:03:27.739> won't<00:03:27.920> have<00:03:27.980> to

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
enjoying your fire you won't have to

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:29.349 
enjoying your fire you won't have to
deal<00:03:28.250> with<00:03:28.280> as<00:03:28.519> much<00:03:28.639> smoke<00:03:28.819> as<00:03:29.090> you're<00:03:29.209> used

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:29.359 
deal with as much smoke as you're used

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:32.890 
deal with as much smoke as you're used
to<00:03:29.480> so<00:03:30.819> ash<00:03:31.819> bass<00:03:32.060> just<00:03:32.209> constructed<00:03:32.780> out<00:03:32.870> a
