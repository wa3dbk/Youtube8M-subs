was probably one of the coolest cars

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.500 
was probably one of the coolest cars
I've<00:00:28.080> ever<00:00:28.410> seen<00:00:28.740> to<00:00:29.010> be<00:00:29.160> built<00:00:29.429> on<00:00:29.580> Minecraft

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
I've ever seen to be built on Minecraft

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.580 
I've ever seen to be built on Minecraft
and<00:00:31.279> pretty<00:00:32.279> much<00:00:32.489> by<00:00:32.759> far<00:00:33.090> I<00:00:33.390> did<00:00:34.230> say<00:00:34.440> the

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
and pretty much by far I did say the

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.830 
and pretty much by far I did say the
other<00:00:34.739> time<00:00:35.040> I<00:00:35.309> made<00:00:35.640> my<00:00:35.850> Range<00:00:36.120> Rover<00:00:36.420> which<00:00:36.630> I

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
other time I made my Range Rover which I

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.680 
other time I made my Range Rover which I
thought<00:00:37.079> was<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.350> coolest<00:00:37.380> car<00:00:38.360> but<00:00:39.360> I<00:00:39.570> don't

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
thought was the coolest car but I don't

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.630 
thought was the coolest car but I don't
know<00:00:39.899> these<00:00:40.350> things<00:00:40.620> are<00:00:40.829> like<00:00:40.920> battle<00:00:41.399> ax<00:00:41.489> now

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
know these things are like battle ax now

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.180 
know these things are like battle ax now
at<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:42.000> moment<00:00:42.210> because<00:00:42.829> I'm<00:00:43.829> not<00:00:44.070> actually

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
at the moment because I'm not actually

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.110 
at the moment because I'm not actually
sure<00:00:44.610> what<00:00:45.390> is<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.840> best<00:00:46.020> car<00:00:46.289> at<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.590> moment

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
sure what is the best car at the moment

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.580 
sure what is the best car at the moment
because<00:00:48.120> cars<00:00:48.660> are<00:00:48.809> just<00:00:48.899> getting<00:00:49.200> better<00:00:49.350> and

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
because cars are just getting better and

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.590 
because cars are just getting better and
better<00:00:49.680> like<00:00:50.370> they're<00:00:51.090> insane<00:00:51.510> though<00:00:52.129> so

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
better like they're insane though so

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.450 
better like they're insane though so
just<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:54.719> start<00:00:54.780> on<00:00:55.260> this<00:00:55.410> build<00:00:55.680> everything

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
just to start on this build everything

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.540 
just to start on this build everything
is<00:00:56.789> symmetrical<00:00:57.510> like<00:00:57.780> on<00:00:57.960> most<00:00:58.199> cars<00:00:58.469> so<00:00:59.190> you

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
is symmetrical like on most cars so you

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.090 
is symmetrical like on most cars so you
know<00:00:59.789> don't<00:01:00.090> worry<00:01:00.329> about<00:01:00.449> that<00:01:00.750> and<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.590> snow

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
know don't worry about that and the snow

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.799 
know don't worry about that and the snow
it<00:01:02.160> shouldn't<00:01:02.579> melt<00:01:02.820> unless<00:01:03.149> you<00:01:03.329> put<00:01:03.510> it<00:01:03.629> near

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
it shouldn't melt unless you put it near

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.010 
it shouldn't melt unless you put it near
any<00:01:04.049> like<00:01:04.939> glowstone<00:01:05.939> or<00:01:06.270> beacons<00:01:06.750> you<00:01:06.900> know

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
any like glowstone or beacons you know

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.920 
any like glowstone or beacons you know
that<00:01:07.170> kind<00:01:07.439> of<00:01:07.500> stuff<00:01:07.619> so<00:01:08.540> snow<00:01:09.540> should<00:01:09.750> be

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
that kind of stuff so snow should be

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.649 
that kind of stuff so snow should be
fine<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:10.650> it<00:01:10.979> does<00:01:11.159> look<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.430> best<00:01:11.820> so<00:01:12.360> we<00:01:12.540> are

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
fine and it does look the best so we are

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.070 
fine and it does look the best so we are
definitely<00:01:13.140> using<00:01:13.320> snow<00:01:13.740> for<00:01:13.979> this<00:01:14.100> now<00:01:15.080> for

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.060 
handles now there's various things you
could<00:04:15.720> do<00:04:15.900> for<00:04:16.109> this<00:04:16.230> you<00:04:16.500> could<00:04:16.650> put<00:04:16.859> buttons

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
could do for this you could put buttons

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.039 
could do for this you could put buttons
other<00:04:17.459> side<00:04:17.760> it's<00:04:18.000> probably<00:04:18.269> a<00:04:18.330> simplest<00:04:18.840> way

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
other side it's probably a simplest way

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:21.800 
other side it's probably a simplest way
well<00:04:19.470> you<00:04:19.560> could<00:04:19.709> do<00:04:19.859> this<00:04:20.180> item<00:04:21.180> frame<00:04:21.480> with<00:04:21.720> a

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
well you could do this item frame with a

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:26.120 
well you could do this item frame with a
carpet<00:04:23.120> bed<00:04:24.260> side<00:04:25.260> over<00:04:25.560> the<00:04:25.680> top

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
carpet bed side over the top

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:28.580 
carpet bed side over the top
and<00:04:26.700> I<00:04:26.790> mean<00:04:26.970> how<00:04:27.270> slick<00:04:27.720> it<00:04:27.750> also<00:04:28.080> does<00:04:28.410> that

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
and I mean how slick it also does that

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.010 
and I mean how slick it also does that
look<00:04:29.180> that's<00:04:30.180> probably<00:04:30.480> one<00:04:30.660> of<00:04:30.690> the<00:04:30.810> coolest

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
look that's probably one of the coolest
