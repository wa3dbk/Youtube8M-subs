this<00:01:05.710> ain't<00:01:06.010> too<00:01:06.340> bad<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:08.320> only<00:01:08.530> complaint<00:01:08.650> I

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920 
this ain't too bad the only complaint I

this ain't too bad the only complaint I
really<00:01:09.159> have<00:01:09.340> with<00:01:10.290> this<00:01:11.290> figure<00:01:11.710> is<00:01:11.950> that<00:01:12.400> the

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:12.549 
really have with this figure is that the

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:14.399 
really have with this figure is that the
pain<00:01:12.729> applications<00:01:13.360> use<00:01:13.570> that<00:01:13.780> same<00:01:14.020> matte

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:14.409 
pain applications use that same matte

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:16.590 
pain applications use that same matte
finish<00:01:14.830> that<00:01:15.159> the<00:01:15.369> cyborg<00:01:16.000> 3-pack<00:01:16.360> does

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 
finish that the cyborg 3-pack does

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.270 
finish that the cyborg 3-pack does
rather<00:01:17.320> than<00:01:17.560> something<00:01:17.799> with<00:01:18.010> a<00:01:18.040> slight

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
rather than something with a slight

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.980 
rather than something with a slight
gloss<00:01:18.610> to<00:01:18.850> it<00:01:18.880> like<00:01:19.119> Hasbro<00:01:19.479> would<00:01:19.570> use<00:01:19.750> and

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
gloss to it like Hasbro would use and

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:21.749 
gloss to it like Hasbro would use and
they<00:01:20.380> do<00:01:20.439> use<00:01:20.679> a<00:01:20.710> slightly<00:01:21.039> more<00:01:21.340> rubbery

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:21.759 
they do use a slightly more rubbery

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:23.700 
they do use a slightly more rubbery
plastic<00:01:22.000> which<00:01:22.630> gives<00:01:22.869> the<00:01:22.960> figures<00:01:23.289> kind<00:01:23.590> of

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
plastic which gives the figures kind of

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.800 
plastic which gives the figures kind of
a<00:01:23.770> cheap<00:01:24.009> feel<00:01:24.310> let's<00:01:25.210> go<00:01:25.359> ahead<00:01:25.420> and<00:01:25.539> take<00:01:25.750> a

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
a cheap feel let's go ahead and take a

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.380 
a cheap feel let's go ahead and take a
look<00:01:26.079> at<00:01:26.320> the<00:01:26.530> articulation<00:01:27.460> here<00:01:27.700> the<00:01:28.090> feet

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 
look at the articulation here the feet

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.300 
look at the articulation here the feet
as<00:01:29.020> you<00:01:29.170> can<00:01:29.259> see<00:01:29.409> our<00:01:29.560> have<00:01:30.009> the<00:01:30.159> typical

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 
as you can see our have the typical

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.669 
as you can see our have the typical

is not a bad figure as a standalone
figure<00:03:15.370> when<00:03:15.580> compared<00:03:15.910> to<00:03:16.030> some<00:03:16.180> of<00:03:16.209> the
