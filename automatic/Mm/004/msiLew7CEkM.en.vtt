because<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.570> scriptwriters<00:01:46.049> give<00:01:46.200> me<00:01:46.320> some

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
because the scriptwriters give me some

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.499 
because the scriptwriters give me some
great<00:01:46.950> lines<00:01:47.100> to<00:01:47.399> do<00:01:47.549> and<00:01:47.820> then<00:01:47.970> I<00:01:48.180> thought

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
great lines to do and then I thought

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:49.670 
great lines to do and then I thought
there's<00:01:48.659> all<00:01:48.750> different<00:01:48.780> sizes<00:01:49.140> in<00:01:49.500> middle

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
there's all different sizes in middle

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:50.929 
there's all different sizes in middle
think<00:01:49.829> she's<00:01:49.979> you<00:01:50.220> know<00:01:50.250> you've<00:01:50.549> seen<00:01:50.670> being

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
think she's you know you've seen being

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.219 
think she's you know you've seen being
quite<00:01:51.119> bitchy<00:01:51.299> but<00:01:51.509> I<00:01:51.570> think<00:01:51.750> with<00:01:52.200> a

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
quite bitchy but I think with a

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.350 
quite bitchy but I think with a
storyline<00:01:52.590> with<00:01:52.920> them<00:01:53.159> you<00:01:53.790> know<00:01:53.909> with<00:01:54.030> Jason

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
storyline with them you know with Jason

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.580 
storyline with them you know with Jason
and<00:01:54.450> everything<00:01:54.810> I<00:01:54.930> think<00:01:54.960> it<00:01:55.200> brings<00:01:55.350> out

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
and everything I think it brings out

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.920 
and everything I think it brings out
we're<00:01:56.159> not<00:01:56.280> a<00:01:56.310> boring<00:01:56.579> but<00:01:56.939> like<00:01:57.090> a<00:01:57.119> much<00:01:57.689> nicer

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
camera in comment is I think they're

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.759 
camera in comment is I think they're
both<00:02:33.159> a<00:02:33.310> little<00:02:33.340> bit<00:02:33.640> lost<00:02:33.849> in<00:02:34.120> their<00:02:34.269> own<00:02:34.390> ways

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
both a little bit lost in their own ways

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:36.899 
both a little bit lost in their own ways
so<00:02:35.769> I<00:02:35.799> think<00:02:35.890> you<00:02:36.159> know<00:02:36.250> it's<00:02:36.430> quite<00:02:36.640> it's

00:02:36.899 --> 00:02:36.909 
so I think you know it's quite it's

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:38.190 
so I think you know it's quite it's
really<00:02:37.269> really<00:02:37.450> quite<00:02:37.629> special<00:02:37.780> that<00:02:38.109> the

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
really really quite special that the
