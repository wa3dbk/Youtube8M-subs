00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
League One title this season I think

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.869 
League One title this season I think
that<00:02:10.319> that's<00:02:10.410> over<00:02:10.709> we<00:02:11.459> just<00:02:11.640> need<00:02:11.730> to<00:02:11.819> make

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
that that's over we just need to make

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.690 
that that's over we just need to make
sure<00:02:12.000> to<00:02:12.270> stay<00:02:12.480> top<00:02:12.810> three<00:02:13.140> so<00:02:13.410> we<00:02:13.500> can

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
sure to stay top three so we can

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.850 
sure to stay top three so we can
continue<00:02:14.150> on<00:02:14.360> the<00:02:15.020> path<00:02:15.050> of<00:02:15.410> at<00:02:15.560> least<00:02:15.650> being

control<00:03:23.569> over<00:03:23.870> the<00:03:24.260> defense<00:03:24.590> i'm<00:03:24.859> just

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:25.519 
control over the defense i'm just

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:26.949 
control over the defense i'm just
chillin<00:03:25.850> up<00:03:25.940> front<00:03:26.239> waiting<00:03:26.450> for<00:03:26.600> clearance

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
chillin up front waiting for clearance

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:28.539 
chillin up front waiting for clearance
waiting<00:03:27.410> for<00:03:27.530> an<00:03:27.590> outlet<00:03:27.920> trying<00:03:28.489> to

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:28.549 
waiting for an outlet trying to

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:30.610 
waiting for an outlet trying to
counter-attack<00:03:28.880> and<00:03:29.389> I<00:03:29.989> was<00:03:30.139> losing<00:03:30.319> points

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
counter-attack and I was losing points

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.280 
counter-attack and I was losing points
for<00:03:30.889> not<00:03:30.980> being<00:03:31.220> positioned<00:03:31.670> correctly<00:03:32.290> even

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
for not being positioned correctly even

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:36.250 
for not being positioned correctly even
when<00:03:33.440> I<00:03:33.470> had<00:03:33.650> nothing<00:03:34.040> to<00:03:34.160> do<00:03:34.340> and<00:03:34.900> now<00:03:35.900> my<00:03:36.049> next

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
when I had nothing to do and now my next

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.250 
when I had nothing to do and now my next
question<00:03:36.739> is<00:03:36.950> how<00:03:37.630> important<00:03:38.630> is<00:03:38.750> calling<00:03:39.139> for

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
question is how important is calling for

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.080 
question is how important is calling for
the<00:03:39.319> ball<00:03:39.410> and<00:03:39.769> when<00:03:40.250> you<00:03:40.370> call<00:03:40.579> forward<00:03:40.970> and

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
the ball and when you call forward and

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.090 
the ball and when you call forward and
what<00:03:41.269> happens<00:03:41.600> after<00:03:41.989> you<00:03:42.079> call<00:03:42.260> for<00:03:42.530> it<00:03:42.620> the

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.100 
what happens after you call for it the

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:44.620 
what happens after you call for it the
main<00:03:43.280> reason<00:03:43.519> I'm<00:03:43.819> bringing<00:03:43.850> this<00:03:44.209> up<00:03:44.420> is

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:44.630 
main reason I'm bringing this up is

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:46.120 
main reason I'm bringing this up is
because<00:03:44.810> at<00:03:45.139> the<00:03:45.230> end<00:03:45.260> of<00:03:45.410> each<00:03:45.530> game<00:03:45.590> it<00:03:45.950> shows

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.130 
because at the end of each game it shows

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:48.580 
because at the end of each game it shows
you<00:03:46.280> the<00:03:46.459> performance<00:03:46.970> rating<00:03:47.269> and<00:03:47.450> I<00:03:48.260> am<00:03:48.560> a

stat sheets tougher and each category
usually<00:03:51.889> looks<00:03:52.190> pretty<00:03:52.400> good<00:03:52.549> I<00:03:52.850> have<00:03:53.269> a

and I'm doing my thing I'm wondering a

and I'm doing my thing I'm wondering a

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 
little bit if the five minute halves on

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.559 
little bit if the five minute halves on
legendary<00:04:06.500> difficulty<00:04:07.000> might<00:04:08.000> be<00:04:08.239> screwing

00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:08.569 
legendary difficulty might be screwing

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:10.620 
legendary difficulty might be screwing
up<00:04:08.810> how<00:04:09.049> many<00:04:09.109> opportunities<00:04:09.769> i'm<00:04:09.980> able<00:04:10.160> to

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:10.630 
up how many opportunities i'm able to

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:14.080 
up how many opportunities i'm able to
create<00:04:11.630> or<00:04:11.810> how<00:04:12.139> well<00:04:12.349> i<00:04:12.380> facilitate<00:04:13.130> to<00:04:13.819> my

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
create or how well i facilitate to my

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:15.789 
create or how well i facilitate to my
teammates<00:04:14.510> and<00:04:14.810> maybe<00:04:15.019> that's<00:04:15.230> messing<00:04:15.680> with

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:15.799 
teammates and maybe that's messing with

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:18.610 
teammates and maybe that's messing with
me<00:04:15.950> a<00:04:15.980> little<00:04:16.190> bit<00:04:17.109> but<00:04:18.109> I've<00:04:18.229> done<00:04:18.440> some

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 
me a little bit but I've done some

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.650 
me a little bit but I've done some
deductive<00:04:19.039> reasoning<00:04:19.070> here<00:04:19.609> and<00:04:19.820> I<00:04:20.419> think

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:20.660 
deductive reasoning here and I think

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.510 
deductive reasoning here and I think
calling<00:04:20.959> for<00:04:21.079> the<00:04:21.109> ball<00:04:21.169> right<00:04:21.829> now<00:04:22.010> is<00:04:22.280> a

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 
calling for the ball right now is a

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.410 
calling for the ball right now is a
major<00:04:23.210> factor<00:04:23.419> on<00:04:24.020> why<00:04:24.950> I'm<00:04:25.130> not<00:04:25.340> getting

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:26.420 
major factor on why I'm not getting

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:28.750 
major factor on why I'm not getting
the<00:04:26.930> ratings<00:04:27.380> that<00:04:27.560> I<00:04:27.620> need<00:04:27.980> to<00:04:28.010> be<00:04:28.190> pulling<00:04:28.490> in

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:28.760 
the ratings that I need to be pulling in

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:32.080 
the ratings that I need to be pulling in
so<00:04:29.450> that's<00:04:29.630> why<00:04:29.810> I'm<00:04:30.140> dressing<00:04:30.680> you<00:04:30.860> guys<00:04:31.090> let

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.090 
so that's why I'm dressing you guys let

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:33.520 
so that's why I'm dressing you guys let
me<00:04:32.210> know<00:04:32.420> if<00:04:32.750> you've<00:04:32.930> played<00:04:33.080> a<00:04:33.170> lot<00:04:33.350> of<00:04:33.440> my

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:33.530 
me know if you've played a lot of my

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:35.680 
me know if you've played a lot of my
player<00:04:33.800> mode<00:04:33.920> and<00:04:34.430> you<00:04:35.000> figured<00:04:35.420> out<00:04:35.480> this

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:35.690 
player mode and you figured out this

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:37.720 
player mode and you figured out this
aspect<00:04:36.200> or<00:04:36.500> if<00:04:36.710> there's<00:04:36.890> a<00:04:36.950> correct<00:04:37.370> incorrect

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:37.730 
aspect or if there's a correct incorrect

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:40.660 
aspect or if there's a correct incorrect
way<00:04:38.180> to<00:04:39.080> go<00:04:39.290> about<00:04:39.470> calling<00:04:40.460> for<00:04:40.580> the<00:04:40.610> ball

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:40.670 
way to go about calling for the ball

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:43.120 
way to go about calling for the ball
receiving<00:04:41.420> passes<00:04:41.900> maybe<00:04:42.680> even<00:04:42.890> I'm<00:04:43.070> not

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:43.130 
receiving passes maybe even I'm not

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:44.890 
receiving passes maybe even I'm not
moving<00:04:43.640> that<00:04:43.670> well<00:04:43.790> off<00:04:44.120> the<00:04:44.150> ball<00:04:44.480> I<00:04:44.690> know

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:44.900 
moving that well off the ball I know

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.170 
moving that well off the ball I know
that<00:04:45.350> positioning<00:04:45.920> is<00:04:46.130> important<00:04:46.700> because<00:04:46.850> as

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:47.180 
that positioning is important because as

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:49.060 
that positioning is important because as
a<00:04:47.630> centre-forward<00:04:48.080> or<00:04:48.470> strike<00:04:48.770> for<00:04:48.950> your

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 
a centre-forward or strike for your

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:51.040 
a centre-forward or strike for your
teammates<00:04:49.430> expect<00:04:50.000> you<00:04:50.120> to<00:04:50.210> be<00:04:50.330> located<00:04:50.900> at

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.050 
teammates expect you to be located at

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:53.650 
teammates expect you to be located at
the<00:04:51.680> right<00:04:51.890> spot<00:04:52.190> at<00:04:52.400> the<00:04:52.430> right<00:04:52.520> time<00:04:53.030> when

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:53.660 
the right spot at the right time when

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:54.940 
the right spot at the right time when
you're<00:04:53.810> on<00:04:53.900> the<00:04:53.930> pitch<00:04:54.200> you<00:04:54.620> need<00:04:54.770> to<00:04:54.860> be

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:54.950 
you're on the pitch you need to be

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:56.680 
you're on the pitch you need to be
showing<00:04:55.190> for<00:04:55.460> the<00:04:55.520> ball<00:04:55.700> and<00:04:55.910> if<00:04:56.510> you<00:04:56.570> don't

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:56.690 
showing for the ball and if you don't

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:58.420 
showing for the ball and if you don't
get<00:04:56.780> the<00:04:56.900> ball<00:04:57.050> they<00:04:57.140> need<00:04:57.290> to<00:04:57.410> quickly<00:04:57.770> move

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:58.430 
get the ball they need to quickly move

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:59.920 
get the ball they need to quickly move
out<00:04:58.580> of<00:04:58.610> that<00:04:58.790> area<00:04:59.060> and<00:04:59.360> create<00:04:59.540> space

00:04:59.920 --> 00:04:59.930 
out of that area and create space

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:01.480 
out of that area and create space
somewhere<00:05:00.320> else<00:05:00.500> on<00:05:00.740> the<00:05:00.890> pitch<00:05:01.100> so<00:05:01.280> they<00:05:01.370> can

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:01.490 
somewhere else on the pitch so they can

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.270 
somewhere else on the pitch so they can
try<00:05:01.580> to<00:05:01.670> find<00:05:01.880> you<00:05:02.740> so<00:05:03.740> heading<00:05:03.980> into<00:05:04.100> the
