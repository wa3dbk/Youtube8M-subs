00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
white all over the top and as you can

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.680 
white all over the top and as you can
see<00:01:04.199> it<00:01:04.409> is<00:01:04.559> not<00:01:04.769> even<00:01:05.489> but<00:01:05.790> I<00:01:05.970> like<00:01:06.300> it<00:01:06.510> because

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:06.690 
see it is not even but I like it because

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.140 
see it is not even but I like it because
it<00:01:07.050> gives<00:01:07.200> it<00:01:07.410> more<00:01:07.530> of<00:01:07.590> a<00:01:07.680> frosting<00:01:08.190> effect

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
it gives it more of a frosting effect

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.969 
it gives it more of a frosting effect
but<00:01:09.479> if<00:01:09.600> you<00:01:09.690> like<00:01:09.870> it<00:01:09.990> smooth<00:01:10.260> just<00:01:10.590> feel<00:01:10.770> free

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
but if you like it smooth just feel free

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.350 
but if you like it smooth just feel free
to<00:01:11.070> smooth<00:01:11.369> it<00:01:11.460> down<00:01:11.520> with<00:01:11.820> your<00:01:11.970> toothpick

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
to smooth it down with your toothpick

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.690

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.820 

and<00:02:00.000> then<00:02:00.330> once<00:02:00.510> you<00:02:00.600> have<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:00.870> blue<00:02:01.140> part

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:01.830 
and then once you have the blue part

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:03.530 
and then once you have the blue part
drawn<00:02:02.040> on<00:02:02.190> you're<00:02:02.610> going<00:02:02.790> to<00:02:02.880> add<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.270> cheeks

and then go a little bit towards the

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.290 
and then go a little bit towards the
lower<00:02:07.620> half<00:02:07.890> of<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:08.610> blue<00:02:08.759> part<00:02:08.970> because<00:02:09.179> the

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
lower half of the blue part because the

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.090 
lower half of the blue part because the

eyes are pretty even to the mouth part

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.310 
eyes are pretty even to the mouth part
so<00:02:14.430> supposing<00:02:15.300> the<00:02:15.360> eyes<00:02:15.540> will<00:02:15.870> around<00:02:16.080> there

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
so supposing the eyes will around there

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:24.110 
so supposing the eyes will around there
and<00:02:17.220> want<00:02:17.520> to<00:02:17.610> dab<00:02:18.060> this<00:02:18.420> around<00:02:19.110> here<00:02:23.120> make

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.850 

and<00:02:31.620> then<00:02:31.830> just<00:02:32.220> fix<00:02:32.580> it<00:02:33.170> so<00:02:34.170> this<00:02:34.500> layer<00:02:34.710> is

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.300 
to use puffy paint because I don't have
black<00:02:42.420> scribbles<00:02:42.870> but<00:02:42.960> they're<00:02:43.830> basically

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
black scribbles but they're basically

00:02:44.310 --> 00:03:08.110 
black scribbles but they're basically
the<00:02:44.460> same<00:02:44.610> thing

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:33.460 

and<00:03:09.019> here<00:03:09.769> I<00:03:09.800> think<00:03:13.569> even<00:03:14.569> with<00:03:14.720> the<00:03:14.870> eyes

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.130 

so<00:03:34.340> tada<00:03:34.730> here's<00:03:35.090> my<00:03:35.300> little<00:03:35.570> mom<00:03:35.870> Mabel

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.140 
so tada here's my little mom Mabel

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.950 
so tada here's my little mom Mabel
Medeco<00:03:36.380> squishy<00:03:36.770> and<00:03:37.480> mouth<00:03:38.480> looks<00:03:38.750> a<00:03:38.870> little

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:38.960 
Medeco squishy and mouth looks a little

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.930 
Medeco squishy and mouth looks a little
weird<00:03:39.230> so<00:03:39.680> the<00:03:40.280> good<00:03:40.400> thing<00:03:40.520> about<00:03:40.580> puffy

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
weird so the good thing about puffy

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.050 
weird so the good thing about puffy
paint<00:03:41.150> bow<00:03:41.360> is<00:03:41.600> you<00:03:41.780> can<00:03:41.930> wipe<00:03:42.050> it<00:03:42.170> off<00:03:42.320> and

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
paint bow is you can wipe it off and

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.730 
paint bow is you can wipe it off and
redo<00:03:44.060> it<00:03:44.210> too<00:03:44.390> so<00:03:44.630> before<00:03:45.140> it<00:03:45.200> dries<00:03:45.380> I<00:03:45.620> think

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:45.740 
redo it too so before it dries I think

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:47.080 
redo it too so before it dries I think
is<00:03:45.830> already<00:03:45.920> dried<00:03:46.280> so<00:03:46.580> this<00:03:46.850> one<00:03:47.000> will

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
is already dried so this one will

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.540 
is already dried so this one will
probably<00:03:47.150> stay<00:03:47.480> like<00:03:47.630> this<00:03:47.660> but<00:03:48.200> here<00:03:49.040> is<00:03:49.280> I

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:49.550 
probably stay like this but here is I

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:51.190 
probably stay like this but here is I
suppose<00:03:49.880> I<00:03:50.180> could<00:03:50.450> have<00:03:50.480> drawn<00:03:50.750> the<00:03:50.870> face<00:03:51.050> a

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 
suppose I could have drawn the face a

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.030 
suppose I could have drawn the face a
little<00:03:51.380> bit<00:03:51.500> bigger<00:03:51.770> but<00:03:52.570> I'm<00:03:53.570> not<00:03:54.010> good<00:03:55.010> with

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
little bit bigger but I'm not good with

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.920 
little bit bigger but I'm not good with
drawing<00:03:55.640> and<00:03:55.910> balance<00:03:56.240> and<00:03:56.450> all<00:03:56.510> that<00:03:56.690> stuff

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
drawing and balance and all that stuff

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:59.260 
drawing and balance and all that stuff
so<00:03:57.170> I'm<00:03:57.980> happy<00:03:58.370> with<00:03:58.460> this<00:03:58.640> I<00:03:58.850> think<00:03:59.060> it<00:03:59.120> looks

00:03:59.260 --> 00:03:59.270 
so I'm happy with this I think it looks

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:02.050 
so I'm happy with this I think it looks
really<00:03:59.480> cute<00:03:59.720> and<00:04:00.280> maybe<00:04:01.280> I<00:04:01.370> will<00:04:01.490> try<00:04:01.670> making
