a in today's sin fig tutorial we're

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:04.550 
a in today's sin fig tutorial we're
gonna<00:00:03.360> learn<00:00:03.600> how<00:00:03.840> to<00:00:03.870> make<00:00:04.110> a<00:00:04.140> pair<00:00:04.529> of

gonna learn how to make a pair of

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.099 
gonna learn how to make a pair of
walking<00:00:05.100> stick<00:00:05.609> figure<00:00:05.970> legs<00:00:06.240> just<00:00:06.870> like

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
walking stick figure legs just like

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.990 
walking stick figure legs just like
these<00:00:07.379> so<00:00:08.309> let's<00:00:08.610> go<00:00:08.790> ahead<00:00:08.910> and<00:00:09.179> get<00:00:09.330> started

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:11.000 
these so let's go ahead and get started

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.900 
these so let's go ahead and get started
okay<00:00:12.000> we<00:00:12.240> have<00:00:12.450> our<00:00:12.480> blank<00:00:13.170> canvas<00:00:13.830> here<00:00:13.910> and

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
okay we have our blank canvas here and

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.800 
okay we have our blank canvas here and
we<00:00:15.719> want<00:00:15.900> to<00:00:15.960> start<00:00:16.320> by<00:00:16.740> creating<00:00:17.490> a<00:00:18.210> single

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
we want to start by creating a single

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.150 
we want to start by creating a single
leg<00:00:19.199> and<00:00:19.590> I'm<00:00:20.460> going<00:00:21.000> to<00:00:21.300> do<00:00:22.170> that<00:00:22.380> by<00:00:22.650> starting

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
leg and I'm going to do that by starting

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.019 
leg and I'm going to do that by starting
with<00:00:23.340> the<00:00:23.490> B<00:00:23.789> line<00:00:24.029> tool<00:00:24.390> and<00:00:25.699> creating<00:00:26.699> an

on<00:00:54.180> my<00:00:54.420> character's<00:00:55.199> foot<00:00:55.559> also<00:00:56.010> for<00:00:56.640> this<00:00:56.789> one

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
on my character's foot also for this one

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:03.049 
on my character's foot also for this one
I<00:00:57.000> am<00:00:57.120> going<00:00:57.270> to<00:00:57.539> use<00:00:57.719> a<00:00:57.750> beeline<00:00:58.320> region<00:01:02.059> loop

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
I am going to use a beeline region loop

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.660 
I am going to use a beeline region loop
B<00:01:03.420> line<00:01:04.369> okay<00:01:06.740> now<00:01:07.740> I'm<00:01:07.799> just<00:01:07.890> gonna<00:01:08.130> mold<00:01:08.430> the

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
and now we're going to encapsulate all

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.820 
and now we're going to encapsulate all
my<00:01:18.299> objects<00:01:19.280> here's<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.580> shoe<00:01:21.500> here's<00:01:22.500> the

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
my objects here's the shoe here's the

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.680 
my objects here's the shoe here's the
calf<00:01:23.100> area<00:01:23.610> of<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.850> leg<00:01:24.710> here's<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:26.070> thigh

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:26.690 
calf area of the leg here's the thigh

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:32.510 
calf area of the leg here's the thigh
let<00:01:27.690> me<00:01:27.810> go<00:01:27.990> ahead<00:01:28.080> and<00:01:28.229> name<00:01:28.649> these<00:01:31.220> we<00:01:32.220> want

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
let me go ahead and name these we want

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.070 
let me go ahead and name these we want
to<00:01:32.670> put<00:01:32.940> the<00:01:33.740> calf<00:01:34.970> encapsulation<00:01:35.970> inside<00:01:36.750> the

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:37.080 
to put the calf encapsulation inside the

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.010 
to put the calf encapsulation inside the
thigh<00:01:37.549> encapsulation<00:01:38.549> now<00:01:38.759> and<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.750> shoe

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
thigh encapsulation now and the shoe

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.070 
thigh encapsulation now and the shoe
encapsulation<00:01:40.770> inside<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.610> calf

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.080 
encapsulation inside the calf

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.200 
encapsulation inside the calf
encapsulation<00:01:43.460> this<00:01:44.460> will<00:01:44.640> make<00:01:44.820> every

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
encapsulation this will make every

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.020 
encapsulation this will make every
motion<00:01:45.840> on<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.500> higher<00:01:46.890> level<00:01:47.429> have<00:01:47.819> an

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
motion on the higher level have an

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.830 
motion on the higher level have an
effect<00:01:48.420> on<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.960> lower<00:01:49.200> level<00:01:49.789> encapsulation

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
effect on the lower level encapsulation

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.940 
effect on the lower level encapsulation
now<00:01:51.840> you<00:01:51.960> can<00:01:52.110> see<00:01:52.259> that<00:01:52.380> everything<00:01:52.830> is

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
now you can see that everything is

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.469 
now you can see that everything is
encapsulated<00:01:53.280> within<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:54.119> thigh

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
encapsulated within the thigh

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.020 
encapsulated within the thigh
encapsulation<00:01:55.380> and<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:56.039> shoe<00:01:56.280> is<00:01:56.520> within<00:01:56.789> the

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
encapsulation and the shoe is within the

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.050 
encapsulation and the shoe is within the
calf<00:01:57.289> encapsulation<00:01:58.289> we<00:01:59.250> also<00:01:59.429> need<00:01:59.759> to<00:01:59.940> add

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
calf encapsulation we also need to add

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.820 
calf encapsulation we also need to add
some<00:02:00.390> rotation<00:02:00.600> layers<00:02:01.319> that<00:02:01.590> we're<00:02:01.740> gonna

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:01.830 
some rotation layers that we're gonna

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:03.919 
some rotation layers that we're gonna
use<00:02:02.009> later<00:02:02.550> so<00:02:03.000> let's<00:02:03.270> go<00:02:03.450> ahead<00:02:03.539> and<00:02:03.810> put

00:02:03.919 --> 00:02:03.929 
use later so let's go ahead and put

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:06.880 
use later so let's go ahead and put
those<00:02:04.080> in<00:02:04.350> now<00:02:04.560> right<00:02:04.979> click<00:02:05.399> new<00:02:05.850> layer

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
those in now right click new layer

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:19.410 
those in now right click new layer
transform<00:02:08.810> rotate

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.120 

now<00:02:20.020> you<00:02:20.080> should<00:02:20.380> have<00:02:20.410> something<00:02:21.010> very

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
now you should have something very

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.280 
now you should have something very
similar<00:02:21.430> to<00:02:21.670> this<00:02:21.790> here<00:02:22.270> we<00:02:22.420> need<00:02:22.690> to<00:02:22.750> line<00:02:23.110> up

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
similar to this here we need to line up

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.020 
similar to this here we need to line up
the<00:02:23.410> encapsulation<00:02:24.100> so<00:02:24.520> it<00:02:24.670> looks<00:02:24.850> like<00:02:24.910> a

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
the encapsulation so it looks like a

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.830 
the encapsulation so it looks like a
real<00:02:25.360> Lake<00:02:25.600> let's<00:02:26.260> start<00:02:26.530> with<00:02:26.680> a<00:02:26.709> thigh<00:02:27.840> and

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
real Lake let's start with a thigh and

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.630 
real Lake let's start with a thigh and
we'll<00:02:29.260> move<00:02:29.470> it<00:02:29.709> up<00:02:30.270> and<00:02:31.500> go<00:02:32.500> to<00:02:32.560> the<00:02:32.830> calf<00:02:33.100> and

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
we'll move it up and go to the calf and

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.040 
we'll move it up and go to the calf and
connect<00:02:34.240> it<00:02:34.390> to<00:02:34.600> the<00:02:34.840> knee<00:02:36.540> we<00:02:37.540> could<00:02:37.690> turn<00:02:37.840> off

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
connect it to the knee we could turn off

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:39.510 
connect it to the knee we could turn off
these<00:02:38.260> now<00:02:38.590> so<00:02:38.800> they<00:02:38.920> don't<00:02:39.100> get<00:02:39.220> in<00:02:39.340> our<00:02:39.459> way

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
these now so they don't get in our way

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.970 
these now so they don't get in our way
we're<00:02:40.150> not<00:02:40.240> gonna<00:02:40.330> need<00:02:40.630> them<00:02:40.810> anymore<00:02:41.020> can

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
we're not gonna need them anymore can

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.160 
we're not gonna need them anymore can

here<00:05:10.340> we<00:05:10.490> should<00:05:10.550> have<00:05:10.849> one<00:05:11.180> leg<00:05:11.539> going

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:12.020 
here we should have one leg going

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:15.640 
here we should have one leg going
through<00:05:12.349> a<00:05:12.380> full<00:05:12.710> walk<00:05:13.099> cycle<00:05:14.169> go<00:05:15.169> back<00:05:15.380> to

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:15.650 
through a full walk cycle go back to

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:26.340 
through a full walk cycle go back to
frame<00:05:15.979> 0<00:05:16.180> so<00:05:17.180> we<00:05:17.270> can<00:05:17.449> double<00:05:17.719> check<00:05:17.930> it

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:26.350 

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:30.090 

okay<00:05:27.160> and<00:05:27.370> to<00:05:27.490> get<00:05:27.670> two<00:05:27.940> legs<00:05:28.210> walking<00:05:28.980> what<00:05:29.980> we

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:30.100 
okay and to get two legs walking what we

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:32.450 
okay and to get two legs walking what we
want<00:05:30.250> to<00:05:30.340> do<00:05:30.460> is<00:05:30.640> go<00:05:30.820> out<00:05:30.850> of<00:05:31.240> animate<00:05:31.720> mode<00:05:31.990> and

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:32.460 
want to do is go out of animate mode and

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.400 
want to do is go out of animate mode and
we're<00:05:33.460> just<00:05:33.760> going<00:05:34.030> to<00:05:34.270> duplicate<00:05:35.050> this

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:35.410 
we're just going to duplicate this

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:37.380 
we're just going to duplicate this
little<00:05:35.740> first<00:05:36.130> leg<00:05:36.430> that<00:05:36.640> we've<00:05:36.760> already<00:05:36.970> made

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:37.390 
little first leg that we've already made

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:41.790 
little first leg that we've already made
so<00:05:38.170> fold<00:05:38.980> up<00:05:39.190> the<00:05:39.400> encapsulation<00:05:40.590> select<00:05:41.590> it

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:41.800 
so fold up the encapsulation select it

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.970 
so fold up the encapsulation select it
right-click<00:05:42.520> go<00:05:43.150> to<00:05:43.660> duplicate<00:05:44.380> layer<00:05:44.650> and

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:44.980 
right-click go to duplicate layer and

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:50.300 
right-click go to duplicate layer and
we'll<00:05:45.820> rename<00:05:46.300> this<00:05:46.600> to<00:05:47.080> thigh<00:05:48.040> number<00:05:48.880> two

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:50.310 
we'll rename this to thigh number two

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:53.520 
we'll rename this to thigh number two
now<00:05:51.310> if<00:05:51.460> I<00:05:51.550> take<00:05:51.760> this<00:05:52.030> second<00:05:52.870> thigh<00:05:53.080> and<00:05:53.350> move

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:53.530 
now if I take this second thigh and move

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:55.470 
now if I take this second thigh and move
it<00:05:53.680> over<00:05:53.800> you'll<00:05:54.550> see<00:05:54.820> that<00:05:55.000> they're<00:05:55.210> both

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:55.480 
it over you'll see that they're both

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:58.200 
it over you'll see that they're both
walking<00:05:56.220> now<00:05:57.220> this<00:05:57.370> can<00:05:57.550> be<00:05:57.580> a<00:05:57.700> beneficial

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:58.210 
walking now this can be a beneficial

00:05:58.210 --> 00:05:59.970 
walking now this can be a beneficial
technique<00:05:58.780> if<00:05:58.960> you<00:05:58.990> want<00:05:59.260> an<00:05:59.410> army<00:05:59.830> of

00:05:59.970 --> 00:05:59.980 
technique if you want an army of

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:02.550 
technique if you want an army of
characters<00:06:00.580> marching<00:06:01.090> in<00:06:01.240> step<00:06:01.470> but<00:06:02.470> to

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:02.560 
characters marching in step but to

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:04.380 
characters marching in step but to

walking<00:06:26.260> positions<00:06:28.140> okay<00:06:29.140> I<00:06:29.170> just<00:06:29.230> finished

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:29.650 
walking positions okay I just finished

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:32.100 
walking positions okay I just finished

legs<00:06:45.060> okay<00:06:46.060> that<00:06:46.270> looked<00:06:46.450> pretty<00:06:46.660> good<00:06:46.990> now

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:47.650 
legs okay that looked pretty good now

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:49.110

that<00:06:47.800> I<00:06:47.830> have<00:06:48.010> that<00:06:48.190> working<00:06:48.610> I<00:06:48.670> need<00:06:48.820> to<00:06:48.910> fill

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:49.120

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:02.710 
frame 0 and frame zero can be duplicated

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:07.110 
frame 0 and frame zero can be duplicated
from<00:07:02.950> this<00:07:03.310> point<00:07:04.710> and<00:07:05.710> set<00:07:06.160> the<00:07:06.340> frame<00:07:06.610> six

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:07.120 
from this point and set the frame six

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:10.290 
from this point and set the frame six
and<00:07:07.570> it<00:07:08.170> can<00:07:08.380> be<00:07:08.500> duplicated<00:07:09.220> from<00:07:09.670> this<00:07:10.000> point

and it can be duplicated from this point

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:13.170 
and it can be duplicated from this point
now<00:07:11.200> I<00:07:11.230> should<00:07:11.590> have<00:07:11.620> a<00:07:11.800> proper<00:07:12.130> walk<00:07:12.520> sequence

00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:13.180 
now I should have a proper walk sequence

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:16.950 
now I should have a proper walk sequence
from<00:07:13.810> second<00:07:14.380> zero<00:07:14.620> frame<00:07:15.040> zero<00:07:15.400> to<00:07:15.960> second

00:07:24.729 --> 00:07:27.129 

rather<00:07:25.729> that's<00:07:26.029> working<00:07:26.479> when<00:07:26.599> I<00:07:26.629> had<00:07:26.809> a<00:07:26.839> time

00:07:27.129 --> 00:07:27.139 
rather that's working when I had a time

00:07:27.139 --> 00:07:32.439 
rather that's working when I had a time
