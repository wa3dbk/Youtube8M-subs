00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:14.040
 I feel like a cafe here for the time being 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:21.190
 It is wonderfully a red brick transplant. I made this head without any doubt 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:24.370
 I do not know why I made this house is the player's Rex 's house 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:25.620

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:29.960

 Here is grinded in my house 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:07.260
 I looked at the open feeling of looseness 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:16.189
 I thought that it is not cool When you make something in the basement 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.189
 Now this 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:24.370

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.400
 And the front of the house is Haraguro's house 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.489

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.510

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:07.130
 But mainly used for combat purposes 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:07.130
 It is still in the process of making it 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:11.160
 It was a paradise on the roof 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:19.830
 I think I'm wasting high 

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:25.169

00:05:04.849 --> 00:05:09.290

 Let's go home already 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:22.830
 How was this video ? 

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:29.330

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:29.330
