well we kind of had a little idea a week
ago<00:00:04.259> of<00:00:04.589> what<00:00:04.890> it<00:00:05.009> would<00:00:05.160> look<00:00:05.339> like<00:00:06.230> but

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
ago of what it would look like but

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.640 
ago of what it would look like but
without<00:00:07.470> too<00:00:07.649> many<00:00:07.740> details<00:00:08.010> so<00:00:08.690> today<00:00:09.690> seeing

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
without too many details so today seeing

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.580 
without too many details so today seeing
the<00:00:10.830> details<00:00:11.219> of<00:00:11.519> certain<00:00:11.849> stages<00:00:12.120> I'm<00:00:13.049> a

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
the details of certain stages I'm a

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.230 
the details of certain stages I'm a
little<00:00:13.740> bit<00:00:14.070> more<00:00:14.160> optimistic<00:00:14.309> I<00:00:14.849> didn't<00:00:15.120> like

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
little bit more optimistic I didn't like

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.019 
little bit more optimistic I didn't like
it<00:00:15.420> at<00:00:15.509> first<00:00:15.540> a<00:00:15.900> week<00:00:16.020> ago<00:00:16.260> when<00:00:16.680> I<00:00:16.710> saw<00:00:17.029> not

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
it at first a week ago when I saw not

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.230 
it at first a week ago when I saw not
another<00:00:18.600> lot<00:00:18.720> of<00:00:18.840> mountain<00:00:19.109> stages<00:00:19.380> and<00:00:20.240> the

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
another lot of mountain stages and the

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.849 
another lot of mountain stages and the
accent<00:00:21.600> of<00:00:21.660> the<00:00:21.840> all<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.080> time<00:00:22.260> browse<00:00:22.730> but

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:24.859 
accent of the all the time browse but

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:27.380 
accent of the all the time browse but
after<00:00:25.859> seeing<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:26.400> specifics<00:00:26.970> of<00:00:27.090> certain

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
after seeing the specifics of certain

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.439 
after seeing the specifics of certain
stages<00:00:27.660> I<00:00:27.960> think<00:00:28.289> that<00:00:28.560> there's<00:00:29.240> there's<00:00:30.240> room

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
stages I think that there's there's room

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.650 
stages I think that there's there's room
enough<00:00:30.570> to<00:00:31.070> make<00:00:32.070> up<00:00:32.250> for<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.640> time<00:00:32.940> losses<00:00:33.570> in

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
enough to make up for the time losses in

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.889 
enough to make up for the time losses in
the<00:00:33.690> damn<00:00:33.930> krause<00:00:35.300> the<00:00:36.300> same<00:00:36.510> time<00:00:36.660> I<00:00:36.719> know

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
the damn krause the same time I know

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.170 
the damn krause the same time I know
it's<00:00:37.050> not<00:00:37.170> ideal<00:00:37.230> for<00:00:37.800> our<00:00:37.920> team<00:00:38.100> and<00:00:38.309> for<00:00:39.149> a

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
it's not ideal for our team and for a

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.330 
it's not ideal for our team and for a
guy<00:00:39.390> like<00:00:39.420> Andy<00:00:39.980> but<00:00:42.410> I'm<00:00:43.410> not<00:00:43.649> leaving<00:00:44.250> this

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
guy like Andy but I'm not leaving this

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.479 
guy like Andy but I'm not leaving this
room<00:00:45.379> really<00:00:46.379> specimen<00:00:46.950> stick<00:00:47.129> and<00:00:47.309> saying

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
room really specimen stick and saying

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.850 
room really specimen stick and saying
this<00:00:47.670> is<00:00:47.730> Mission<00:00:48.149> Impossible<00:00:48.410> how<00:00:49.410> much<00:00:49.590> time

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
this is Mission Impossible how much time

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.040 
this is Mission Impossible how much time
in<00:00:50.039> almost<00:00:50.700> 100<00:00:50.969> kilometers<00:00:51.570> time<00:00:51.780> Charlie

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
in almost 100 kilometers time Charlie

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.170 
in almost 100 kilometers time Charlie
how<00:00:52.350> much<00:00:52.559> time<00:00:52.829> do<00:00:53.250> you<00:00:53.309> think<00:00:53.460> they<00:00:53.730> could<00:00:53.789> do

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
how much time do you think they could do

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.970 
how much time do you think they could do
as<00:00:54.390> difficult<00:00:54.840> to<00:00:54.930> say<00:00:55.079> it's<00:00:55.590> difficult<00:00:55.860> to

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
as difficult to say it's difficult to

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.459 
as difficult to say it's difficult to
say<00:00:56.129> you're<00:00:56.340> getting<00:00:56.840> the<00:00:57.840> last<00:00:58.020> time<00:00:58.230> browse

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
say you're getting the last time browse

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.779 
say you're getting the last time browse
50<00:00:58.649> 2<00:00:58.920> kilometers<00:00:59.430> but<00:01:00.770> if<00:01:01.770> there's<00:01:02.010> one<00:01:02.070> one

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
50 2 kilometers but if there's one one

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.390 
50 2 kilometers but if there's one one
little<00:01:03.449> thing<00:01:04.170> that<00:01:04.350> I'm<00:01:04.530> more<00:01:04.979> positive

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
little thing that I'm more positive

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.310 
little thing that I'm more positive
about<00:01:05.460> is<00:01:05.850> that<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.450> longest<00:01:06.810> time<00:01:06.869> browsers

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
about is that the longest time browsers

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.980 
about is that the longest time browsers
at<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.500> end<00:01:07.619> and<00:01:07.860> other<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.189> beginning<00:01:08.549> if

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
at the end and other the beginning if

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.090 
at the end and other the beginning if
normally<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.080> damage<00:01:10.409> is<00:01:10.619> always<00:01:10.920> done<00:01:11.070> in

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
normally the damage is always done in

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.710 
normally the damage is always done in
the<00:01:11.250> first<00:01:11.400> time<00:01:11.640> for<00:01:11.850> all<00:01:11.909> of<00:01:11.939> this<00:01:12.210> this<00:01:12.570> one

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
the first time for all of this this one

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.560 
the first time for all of this this one
is<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:12.900> only<00:01:12.930> 38<00:01:13.470> geelani<00:01:14.030> still<00:01:15.030> at<00:01:15.180> 38

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
is the only 38 geelani still at 38

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.260 
is the only 38 geelani still at 38
kilometers<00:01:16.020> but<00:01:16.640> and<00:01:17.640> it's<00:01:17.759> a<00:01:17.850> little<00:01:18.119> bit

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
kilometers but and it's a little bit

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.140 
kilometers but and it's a little bit
more<00:01:18.570> up<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:18.869> down<00:01:18.930> so<00:01:19.970> but<00:01:20.970> there's

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
more up and down so but there's

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.690 
more up and down so but there's
definitely<00:01:21.619> stirs<00:01:22.619> we<00:01:23.280> have<00:01:23.400> to<00:01:23.520> calculate

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
definitely stirs we have to calculate

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.020 
definitely stirs we have to calculate
and<00:01:24.509> try<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.290> limit<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.340> losses<00:01:26.640> in<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.759> time

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
and try to limit the losses in the time

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.910 
and try to limit the losses in the time
trials<00:01:27.420> and<00:01:27.630> then<00:01:27.750> try<00:01:28.020> to<00:01:28.049> make<00:01:28.290> up<00:01:28.439> for<00:01:28.470> it<00:01:28.770> in

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
trials and then try to make up for it in

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.040 
trials and then try to make up for it in
the<00:01:28.979> mountain<00:01:29.549> stages

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:31.050 
the mountain stages

the mountain stages
in<00:01:31.530> other<00:01:31.710> stages<00:01:32.040> which<00:01:32.720> Joe<00:01:33.720> not

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:33.870 
in other stages which Joe not

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:35.600 
in other stages which Joe not
necessarily<00:01:34.410> the<00:01:34.530> big<00:01:34.710> mountain<00:01:35.010> stages<00:01:35.250> with

last few years they've gone to the tour

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.410 
last few years they've gone to the tour
together<00:01:46.340> and<00:01:47.340> it's<00:01:47.490> not<00:01:47.670> quite<00:01:47.880> worked<00:01:48.090> for<00:01:48.390> a

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
together and it's not quite worked for a

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.060 
together and it's not quite worked for a
number<00:01:48.570> of<00:01:48.720> reasons<00:01:48.810> sometimes<00:01:49.260> they're<00:01:49.650> just

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
number of reasons sometimes they're just

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.450 
number of reasons sometimes they're just
being<00:01:50.340> my<00:01:50.520> better<00:01:50.730> Rider<00:01:50.970> and<00:01:51.500> but<00:01:52.500> is<00:01:53.220> there

being my better Rider and but is there

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.610 
being my better Rider and but is there
an<00:01:53.580> opportunity<00:01:54.090> here<00:01:54.600> do<00:01:54.750> you<00:01:54.810> think<00:01:55.020> split

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:55.620 
an opportunity here do you think split

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:01.010 
an opportunity here do you think split
those<00:01:55.770> two<00:01:55.980> and<00:01:56.130> one<00:01:56.520> 2012<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.480> tour<00:01:59.450> I<00:02:00.450> will

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
those two and one 2012 the tour I will

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.120 
those two and one 2012 the tour I will
have<00:02:01.140> to<00:02:01.170> think<00:02:01.440> about<00:02:01.530> it<00:02:01.680> I<00:02:01.800> haven't<00:02:01.980> really

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
have to think about it I haven't really

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.260 
have to think about it I haven't really
thought<00:02:02.340> about<00:02:02.400> that<00:02:02.670> I<00:02:02.730> think<00:02:02.940> it<00:02:03.000> was<00:02:03.120> very

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
thought about that I think it was very

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.990 
thought about that I think it was very
important<00:02:03.750> first<00:02:04.140> to<00:02:04.500> to<00:02:05.070> wait<00:02:05.250> here<00:02:05.460> for<00:02:05.520> to

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
important first to to wait here for to

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.410 
important first to to wait here for to
see<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.800> course<00:02:07.800> and<00:02:08.070> what<00:02:08.460> it<00:02:08.970> really<00:02:09.090> looks

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
see the course and what it really looks

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.760 
see the course and what it really looks
like<00:02:09.710> doing<00:02:10.710> all<00:02:10.830> the<00:02:10.920> stages<00:02:11.160> I<00:02:12.020> need<00:02:13.020> to<00:02:13.200> sit

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
like doing all the stages I need to sit

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.150 
like doing all the stages I need to sit
down<00:02:13.800> and<00:02:14.250> think<00:02:14.760> a<00:02:15.210> little<00:02:15.240> bit<00:02:15.510> more<00:02:15.750> about

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
down and think a little bit more about

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.580 
down and think a little bit more about
where<00:02:17.160> the<00:02:17.280> possibilities<00:02:17.850> are<00:02:17.880> and<00:02:18.240> and<00:02:18.990> then

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
where the possibilities are and and then

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.020 
where the possibilities are and and then
make<00:02:19.740> a<00:02:19.770> decision<00:02:19.860> I'm<00:02:20.490> not<00:02:20.610> excluding

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
make a decision I'm not excluding

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.120 
make a decision I'm not excluding
anything<00:02:21.330> for<00:02:21.450> the<00:02:21.510> moment<00:02:21.660> and<00:02:22.470> undress

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
anything for the moment and undress

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.420 
anything for the moment and undress
cloud<00:02:23.370> and<00:02:23.550> I<00:02:23.640> mean<00:02:23.820> he's<00:02:24.390> a<00:02:24.420> contrast<00:02:24.930> and<00:02:25.590> it

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
cloud and I mean he's a contrast and it

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.340 
cloud and I mean he's a contrast and it
seems<00:02:26.610> the<00:02:26.940> paper<00:02:27.120> someone<00:02:27.510> like<00:02:27.630> a<00:02:27.660> time

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
seems the paper someone like a time

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:29.570 
seems the paper someone like a time
product<00:02:28.740> where<00:02:28.950> does<00:02:29.100> this<00:02:29.190> leave<00:02:29.400> his

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
product where does this leave his

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.820 
product where does this leave his
position<00:02:29.730> I<00:02:30.240> think<00:02:30.990> is<00:02:31.080> easy<00:02:31.260> the<00:02:31.470> number<00:02:31.710> one

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
position I think is easy the number one

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.580 
position I think is easy the number one
day<00:02:31.920> this<00:02:32.070> is<00:02:32.130> a<00:02:32.250> great<00:02:32.460> tool<00:02:32.610> for<00:02:32.670> him<00:02:32.940> yeah<00:02:33.690> at

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
day this is a great tool for him yeah at

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.440 
day this is a great tool for him yeah at
the<00:02:34.680> same<00:02:34.890> time<00:02:35.070> you<00:02:35.670> know<00:02:35.790> I<00:02:35.820> don't<00:02:36.150> want<00:02:36.300> to

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
the same time you know I don't want to

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.070 
the same time you know I don't want to
make<00:02:36.840> too<00:02:37.620> many<00:02:37.770> too<00:02:38.220> many<00:02:38.250> predictions<00:02:39.180> but<00:02:39.600> I

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
make too many too many predictions but I

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.949 
make too many too many predictions but I
think<00:02:40.860> if<00:02:41.010> it's<00:02:41.239> this<00:02:42.239> is<00:02:42.390> definitely<00:02:42.810> going

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
think if it's this is definitely going

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:46.640 
think if it's this is definitely going
to<00:02:43.020> be<00:02:43.140> a<00:02:43.170> good<00:02:44.010> tool<00:02:44.190> for<00:02:44.340> a<00:02:44.670> team<00:02:45.120> with<00:02:45.450> with<00:02:46.140> a

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
to be a good tool for a team with with a

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.520 
to be a good tool for a team with with a
lot<00:02:46.830> of<00:02:46.920> strong<00:02:47.160> riders<00:02:47.520> and<00:02:47.880> I<00:02:48.209> think<00:02:48.480> that<00:02:48.690> we

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
lot of strong riders and I think that we

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.100 
lot of strong riders and I think that we
have<00:02:49.650> a<00:02:49.680> lot<00:02:49.800> of<00:02:49.830> strong<00:02:50.040> riders<00:02:50.630> so

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
have a lot of strong riders so

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.130 
have a lot of strong riders so
it's<00:02:54.010> my<00:02:54.220> invention<00:02:54.550> that<00:02:54.640> we<00:02:54.730> can<00:02:54.880> be<00:02:55.030> a<00:02:55.540> big

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
it's my invention that we can be a big

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.100 
it's my invention that we can be a big
factor<00:02:56.320> in<00:02:56.530> this<00:02:56.710> race<00:02:56.890> and<00:02:57.690> take<00:02:58.690> advantage

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
factor in this race and take advantage

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.610 
factor in this race and take advantage
of<00:02:59.230> the<00:02:59.470> the<00:02:59.950> depth<00:03:00.190> of<00:03:00.340> our<00:03:00.430> team<00:03:00.670> to<00:03:01.560> make<00:03:02.560> a

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
of the the depth of our team to make a

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.800 
of the the depth of our team to make a
difference
