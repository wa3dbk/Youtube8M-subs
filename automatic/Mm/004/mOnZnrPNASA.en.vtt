 I should complain 

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:38.690
 to lower the volume a little 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:42.380
 sound dressing we go down power surpasses 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:44.960
 all tests difficulty easy each 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.519
 I floor all the pressure plates 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.989
 OK 

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:50.989

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:06.189
 there I have to go through all the 

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:10.200
 proof is that we go there and I think that 

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:10.200
 I'm in the same of so 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:17.490

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:19.909
 but that's it 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:23.100
 come on let's go there we started well 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:25.310
 we started really seriously in these two 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.310
 weeks 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:35.270

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:38.440

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:41.840
 throw back I shit on the whore 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:44.860
 and now where it appeared but what is this 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:48.210
 because I appear 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.210
 on a different side 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:57.410
 come quiet this you have it sucks 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:02:00.840
 voucher worth voucher fight against zombies 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:03.020
 with a stick really I have to fight 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.990
 with a stick 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:09.539
 omg with a stick of shit 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:13.020
 You really leave me a stick to 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:15.599
 fight but that as the acs is in 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:18.739
 nap 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:18.739
 of it 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:25.880
 but good what is this from a stick of 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:29.090
 I really had to see it leave him 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:31.810
 game rule inventor and this not to lose 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.810
 The inventory 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.880
 come here nice that pushes you push 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:39.620
 he pushes him pushes him 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:43.310
 so 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:47.290
 the pushed by the others from there to the 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:50.019
 has pushed another less 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.700
 is that it's impossible to kill them like that with a 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:54.420
 stick 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:58.180
 kill him kill him 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:01.510
 I'm going to take another stick in a moment 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:03.650
 and having had leather armor I think 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:07.400
 what was it 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:11.150
 for the one suit and armor where they are 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:14.659
 the armors that I always mess this up and 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:20.569
 the feet and what they were worth and I'm going to 

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:23.420
 compose the rule command that everything 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:26.090
 I'm going to lose with a stick 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:31.640
 I'll do it if I put a stick 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:34.190
 truth and also there we are now 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:37.490
 of my team as before and I have my stick 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:41.870
 we go there with my stick I'm happy 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:45.050
 that I'm not happy I do not masturbate 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:47.350
 shit in the hands is impossible without falling 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:47.350
 behind 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:54.790
 and little by little I will be defeating them 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:54.790
 because it is that this is impossible 

00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:02.090
 beating or pulling the vacuum that is 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:03.800
 to the maximum there is one or the outside thing is that 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:05.850
 if you step on a pressure plate they come back to 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:09.660
 get out two zombies 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:12.390
 is that seriously this is evil of 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:14.690
 really leave me with a fucking stick 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.690
 true 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:22.150
 if there's a lot of uncle seriously this is 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:24.430
 impossible 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.320
 this is impossible seriously that's what 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:29.020
 I say, you always have to check the 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:31.630
 map is worth trying to make it happen 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:34.300
 you are going to take a sword because 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:35.969
 is that it is impossible and try to pass them 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:40.379
 you 

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:43.289
 to see if you can and if you can not lame 

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:46.489
 Iron itself should catch you from 

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:49.619
 stone let's do a little more loyal is 

00:04:46.489 --> 00:04:51.929
 try to pass it you and if you can 

00:04:49.619 --> 00:04:54.319
 then send it to me jce if you can not 

00:04:51.929 --> 00:04:57.479
 pass us what he says begins 

00:04:54.319 --> 00:05:02.929
 then something is wrong 

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:02.929
 something is wrong so come on let's go there 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:10.940
 so that shockey does not jump 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.940
 the way 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:21.889
 killing the time here jope is not fair 

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:24.100
 this is already becoming 

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:25.930
 overwhelming 

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:27.670
 come all for out everything is for 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:30.750
 outside you do not ask me because if you do not 

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:34.350
 we would have there 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:37.470
 there we are now yes yes milk its 

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:39.690
 mother said seriously and the milk and its 

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:42.120
 mother and they do not let me go inside 

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:45.780
 to know Spanish is what there is 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:47.370
 this is impossible in truth this is 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:51.500
 impossible 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:51.500
 so let's go with the iron 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:55.270
 because it's that I think they do not stop 

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:58.509
 come out zombies or anything so we go there 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:58.930
 directly because you can not do it 

00:05:58.509 --> 00:06:01.270
 can 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:03.520
 it's worth directly I've come by 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:06.620
 here and why is it impossible 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:08.630
 that is, water seriously 

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:10.850
 that is, you have seen all the zombies that 

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:13.540
 there is this is impossible so I'm going to 

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:13.540
 put the wing mode 

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:23.690
 and I can not get through this is impossible 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:23.690
 it is impossible 

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:28.900
 if it has generated me zombie every 

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:32.440
 time I spend there are generated so 

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:35.400
 it is impossible to pass this on 

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:38.540
 you no lever 

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:38.540
 when the mates 

00:06:39.169 --> 00:06:46.470
 well let's kill them 

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:49.130
 to blows but there are many a bullshit 

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:52.650
 kill them so let's go directly 

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:55.800
 I get a lot more I'm going to catch 

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:59.490
 You wanted me to kill all of that 

00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:02.630
 truth with a shit with a stick shit 

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:02.630
 really 

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:06.560
 weakness of good 

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:12.260
 come jump and jump I have not lost 

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:16.210
 practice 

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:16.210
 has passed the end of the map tests 

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:22.220
 really 

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:24.440
 I think I should start reviewing a 

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:27.590
 little more the maps before you start 

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:30.020
 do the gameplays because I have one left 

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:32.639
 little like 

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:36.539
 but hey it's fine or I do not say that 

00:07:32.639 --> 00:07:39.180
 it's wrong but the only test so dodgy 

00:07:36.539 --> 00:07:41.279
 because the parkour are facilitos the 

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:45.979
 last is the second test so 

00:07:41.279 --> 00:07:49.139
 say it is the zombies and good 

00:07:45.979 --> 00:07:50.729
 I do not like it but I like the map 

00:07:49.139 --> 00:07:52.740
 been a little short but good that if you 

00:07:50.729 --> 00:07:54.539
 is going to do I hope you liked it and 

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:57.479
 you know if you want more cool maps 

00:07:54.539 --> 00:08:02.629
 well less you send to the address of 

00:07:57.479 --> 00:08:02.629
 down to the next one yet
