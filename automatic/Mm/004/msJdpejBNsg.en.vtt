00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:08.069
 my friends what's going on in the magix 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:11.759
 and I'll show you this medium today 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:16.289
 how do you do such things social avatars the 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:19.109
 can create photoshop it looks like that 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:22.439
 just like that 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:28.310
 so the guests were so faces the 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:28.310
 Heads of services shown to apples 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:34.110
 for that you need photoshop and 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:39.989
 of course a skin that just like that 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:43.950
 looks in there then goes on this 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:48.149
 Pick rectangle tool on it and how 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:52.289
 First, new face or hold your head 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.980
 and then yes, I think so 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.600
 have seen 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:01:01.260
 I can show it to everyone there 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:04.739
 synonymous then even copy and copy 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:09.720
 then you have the two things then 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:11.180
 donkeys can do together and jo then 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.740
 you have definitely been here 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:21.540
 then her head goes on picture 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:24.140
 workspace and power on the pixel and 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.970
 that the 8 and 8 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.710
 then it looks like it will be 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.799
 somewhere up there that would have to see 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:38.280
 to pull it to me 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:43.920
 then you go to image size and beta 800 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:47.280
 x 800 new calculation here and goes as 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.229
 calculate the pixel at recalculation 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:55.939
 then made pixel repetition hard 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:58.470
 Edges and contours then you okay 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:02:01.560
 that's how it looks 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:05.290
 then you go here so it makes 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:10.200
 double-click on the level makes the 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:15.730
 so the drop shadow distance to zero 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:23.080
 perhaps crowded on the size 50 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:24.459
 So they can be like you 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.280
 you might like it in 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:28.410
 player if perhaps one more 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.019
 change a bit 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:36.010
 depending on how you like it then 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:39.130
 stores that could use it for 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:41.080
 whatever that wanted to use for 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:45.780
 example as avatar for youtube or 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:50.380
 Skype or something else for facebook 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:52.360
 will where you will use it and that 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.640
 it was already here with the tutorial 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.349
 I hope you enjoyed it when 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.980
 time has fallen then let one 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:02.620
 a little easier and yes if you are more 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.799
 such no photoshop tutorials see 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:08.079
 want then writes to the 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:09.820
 comments and then what about that 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:13.320
 video skin in there 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.320
 I'm out until then
