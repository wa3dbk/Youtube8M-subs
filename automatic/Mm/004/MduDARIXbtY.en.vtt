hey guys this is double-wide six and

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.599 
hey guys this is double-wide six and
today<00:00:04.740> we're<00:00:04.859> going<00:00:04.950> to<00:00:05.009> be<00:00:05.130> talking<00:00:05.339> to<00:00:05.520> you<00:00:05.580> a

that<00:00:08.460> you<00:00:08.550> can<00:00:08.730> mount<00:00:08.910> on<00:00:09.120> top<00:00:09.360> of<00:00:09.599> a<00:00:09.719> truck

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
that you can mount on top of a truck

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.669 
that you can mount on top of a truck
first<00:00:11.940> of<00:00:12.120> all<00:00:12.240> these<00:00:12.690> hooks<00:00:12.990> are<00:00:13.170> only<00:00:13.380> as

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
strong as they are anchored so if you're

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.380 
strong as they are anchored so if you're
tying<00:00:16.859> down<00:00:17.190> something<00:00:17.580> like<00:00:17.699> a<00:00:17.880> motorcycle

first<00:00:39.450> hand<00:00:39.570> that<00:00:40.079> you're<00:00:40.469> not<00:00:40.649> going<00:00:40.829> to<00:00:40.890> be

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
first hand that you're not going to be

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.130 
first hand that you're not going to be
able<00:00:41.129> to<00:00:41.280> anchor<00:00:41.579> it<00:00:41.940> that<00:00:42.120> tight<00:00:42.450> using<00:00:42.960> these

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
able to anchor it that tight using these

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.250 
able to anchor it that tight using these
rubber<00:00:43.559> mounts<00:00:44.160> that<00:00:44.219> come<00:00:44.520> with<00:00:44.700> these<00:00:44.879> folks

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.260 
rubber mounts that come with these folks

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.350 
rubber mounts that come with these folks
so<00:00:46.260> today<00:00:47.129> what<00:00:47.370> I'm<00:00:47.460> going<00:00:47.640> to<00:00:47.700> show<00:00:47.940> you<00:00:47.969> is

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
so today what I'm going to show you is

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.630 
so today what I'm going to show you is
how<00:00:48.600> to<00:00:48.629> mount<00:00:48.960> these<00:00:49.230> things<00:00:49.590> so<00:00:50.280> that<00:00:50.309> the

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
how to mount these things so that the

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.340 
how to mount these things so that the
rock<00:00:50.910> solid<00:00:51.270> and<00:00:51.780> they're<00:00:52.020> not<00:00:52.140> going<00:00:52.289> to

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
rock solid and they're not going to

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.689 
rock solid and they're not going to
break<00:00:52.649> loose<00:00:52.680> on<00:00:53.309> you<00:00:55.070> so<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.219> principle

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
break loose on you so the principle

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.150 
break loose on you so the principle
behind<00:00:56.940> these<00:00:57.180> anchors<00:00:57.719> is<00:00:58.020> that<00:00:58.410> as<00:00:58.829> you

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
behind these anchors is that as you

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.420 
behind these anchors is that as you
twist<00:00:59.430> and<00:00:59.789> tighten<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.570> top<00:01:01.219> spin<00:01:02.219> that

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
twist and tighten the top spin that

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.520 
twist and tighten the top spin that
around<00:01:02.489> clockwise<00:01:03.480> it's<00:01:03.930> going<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.260> cause

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
around clockwise it's going to cause

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.640 
around clockwise it's going to cause
this<00:01:04.890> rubber<00:01:05.250> grommet<00:01:05.519> to<00:01:05.939> expand<00:01:06.689> and<00:01:07.110> that's

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
this rubber grommet to expand and that's

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.130 
this rubber grommet to expand and that's
going<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.130> expand<00:01:08.670> in<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.000> hole<00:01:09.210> and<00:01:09.630> hold<00:01:09.960> on

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
going to expand in the hole and hold on

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.210 
going to expand in the hole and hold on
tight<00:01:10.970> well<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.090> problem<00:01:12.450> is<00:01:12.950> those<00:01:13.950> things

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
tight well the problem is those things

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.580 
tight well the problem is those things
don't<00:01:14.549> grip<00:01:14.850> tight<00:01:15.180> enough<00:01:15.450> usually<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:16.380> you

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
don't grip tight enough usually and you

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.560 
don't grip tight enough usually and you
can<00:01:16.740> see<00:01:16.890> that<00:01:17.100> there<00:01:17.280> is<00:01:17.400> some<00:01:17.640> play<00:01:17.939> in<00:01:18.210> here

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
can see that there is some play in here

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.800 
can see that there is some play in here
so<00:01:19.080> what<00:01:20.070> I<00:01:20.100> like<00:01:20.430> to<00:01:20.580> do<00:01:20.759> is<00:01:21.150> fasten<00:01:21.689> these

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
so what I like to do is fasten these

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.160 
so what I like to do is fasten these
down<00:01:22.110> using<00:01:22.950> some<00:01:23.310> metal<00:01:23.759> I<00:01:24.180> got<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:24.810> do<00:01:24.960> it

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
down using some metal I got to do it

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.210 
down using some metal I got to do it
it's<00:01:25.350> pretty<00:01:25.710> easy<00:01:27.500> so<00:01:28.500> what<00:01:28.650> you<00:01:28.770> need<00:01:28.890> to<00:01:29.040> do

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.580 
it's pretty easy so what you need to do
is<00:01:29.460> remove<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:29.880> rubber<00:01:30.150> from<00:01:30.780> in<00:01:30.990> here<00:01:31.259> so<00:01:31.500> I'm

locked on there and it's not moving and

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.199 
locked on there and it's not moving and
that's<00:03:04.440> the<00:03:04.709> fourth<00:03:05.010> one<00:03:05.130> so<00:03:05.700> these<00:03:05.880> are<00:03:06.060> all

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
that's the fourth one so these are all

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:09.380 
that's the fourth one so these are all
tied<00:03:06.510> down<00:03:06.870> these<00:03:07.680> things<00:03:07.980> are<00:03:08.220> really<00:03:08.730> handy

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
tied down these things are really handy

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.770 
tied down these things are really handy
a<00:03:09.420> lot<00:03:09.660> of<00:03:09.780> times<00:03:09.989> I<00:03:10.170> put<00:03:11.030> garbage<00:03:12.030> cans<00:03:12.450> in<00:03:12.690> the

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
a lot of times I put garbage cans in the

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.570 
a lot of times I put garbage cans in the
back<00:03:12.959> of<00:03:13.110> the<00:03:13.200> truck<00:03:13.470> and<00:03:13.500> I<00:03:13.739> scrap<00:03:14.100> them<00:03:14.340> in

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
back of the truck and I scrap them in

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.680 
back of the truck and I scrap them in
and<00:03:14.820> you<00:03:15.330> can't<00:03:15.630> tie<00:03:15.959> them<00:03:15.989> in<00:03:16.350> down<00:03:16.890> up<00:03:17.130> the

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
and you can't tie them in down up the

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.170 
and you can't tie them in down up the
lower<00:03:18.690> anchors<00:03:19.320> down<00:03:19.620> there<00:03:20.010> because<00:03:21.000> the

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
lower anchors down there because the

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.229 
lower anchors down there because the
cans<00:03:21.420> are<00:03:21.630> top-heavy<00:03:21.900> and<00:03:22.770> will<00:03:23.010> tip<00:03:23.580> over<00:03:23.790> but

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
cans are top-heavy and will tip over but

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.770 
cans are top-heavy and will tip over but
these<00:03:24.390> work<00:03:24.630> really<00:03:24.900> good<00:03:25.170> for<00:03:25.470> ropes<00:03:25.770> and

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
these work really good for ropes and

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.210 
these work really good for ropes and
straps<00:03:27.780> and<00:03:28.350> things<00:03:28.590> like<00:03:28.860> that

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
straps and things like that

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.400 
straps and things like that
so<00:03:30.060> I<00:03:30.090> thought<00:03:30.390> that<00:03:30.600> little<00:03:30.840> tip<00:03:31.020> could<00:03:31.200> help

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
so I thought that little tip could help

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.949 
so I thought that little tip could help
somebody<00:03:31.680> out<00:03:32.090> hopefully<00:03:33.090> enjoyed<00:03:33.780> this

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
somebody out hopefully enjoyed this

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:36.110
