it here watching it in Vegas actually I
can<00:04:05.170> actually<00:04:05.319> see<00:04:05.650> the<00:04:05.799> bullets<00:04:06.100> going

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.550 
can actually see the bullets going
flying<00:04:07.120> around<00:04:07.569> that's<00:04:07.780> pretty<00:04:08.079> wicked<00:04:08.290> I

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
flying around that's pretty wicked I

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.110 
flying around that's pretty wicked I
actually<00:04:08.769> didn't<00:04:09.250> notice<00:04:09.489> that<00:04:09.670> when<00:04:09.850> I<00:04:09.880> was

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
actually didn't notice that when I was

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.360 
actually didn't notice that when I was
playing<00:04:10.329> but<00:04:10.569> you<00:04:10.660> can<00:04:10.870> actually<00:04:11.530> see<00:04:12.010> you<00:04:12.190> can

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 
playing but you can actually see you can

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:13.830 
playing but you can actually see you can
see<00:04:12.519> there<00:04:12.700> the<00:04:12.850> bullets<00:04:13.030> are<00:04:13.269> just<00:04:13.299> bouncing

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
see there the bullets are just bouncing

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.300 
see there the bullets are just bouncing
around<00:04:13.870> everywhere<00:04:14.440> so<00:04:14.470> that's<00:04:14.799> pretty<00:04:15.010> cool

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
around everywhere so that's pretty cool

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.069 
around everywhere so that's pretty cool
that's<00:04:15.819> probably<00:04:16.000> what<00:04:16.450> makes<00:04:16.630> it<00:04:16.810> really

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:17.079 
that's probably what makes it really

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:18.750 
that's probably what makes it really
beastly<00:04:17.799> because<00:04:18.130> those<00:04:18.310> bullets<00:04:18.609> are<00:04:18.700> just

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:18.760 
beastly because those bullets are just

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.969 
beastly because those bullets are just
flying<00:04:19.090> around<00:04:19.239> injuring<00:04:19.690> everything<00:04:20.440> a

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:20.979 
flying around injuring everything a

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:23.550 
flying around injuring everything a
couple<00:04:21.729> with<00:04:21.940> the<00:04:22.150> child<00:04:22.720> Rene's<00:04:23.080> you<00:04:23.200> can<00:04:23.349> see

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 
couple with the child Rene's you can see

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.200 
couple with the child Rene's you can see
just<00:04:23.740> kind<00:04:23.919> of<00:04:23.980> throws<00:04:24.190> them<00:04:24.310> out<00:04:24.400> it<00:04:24.610> said

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
just kind of throws them out it said

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.650 
just kind of throws them out it said
like<00:04:26.130> approximate<00:04:27.130> rate<00:04:27.340> of<00:04:27.550> two<00:04:27.790> per<00:04:28.060> second

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:28.660 
like approximate rate of two per second

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:30.510 
like approximate rate of two per second
so<00:04:28.900> you<00:04:29.440> know<00:04:29.530> I<00:04:29.560> don't<00:04:29.800> know<00:04:29.889> how<00:04:30.010> long<00:04:30.340> it

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
so you know I don't know how long it

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.150 
so you know I don't know how long it
lasts<00:04:30.760> but<00:04:31.060> it<00:04:31.240> seems<00:04:31.450> like<00:04:31.570> a<00:04:31.600> pretty<00:04:31.840> good

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
lasts but it seems like a pretty good

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.440 
lasts but it seems like a pretty good
little<00:04:33.160> grenade<00:04:33.400> mod<00:04:33.520> I<00:04:33.730> actually<00:04:33.910> like<00:04:34.270> it

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:34.450 
little grenade mod I actually like it

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:36.570 
little grenade mod I actually like it
now<00:04:34.540> the<00:04:34.600> fuse<00:04:34.960> time<00:04:35.139> of<00:04:35.320> mine<00:04:35.500> was<00:04:35.740> 0.8

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580 
now the fuse time of mine was 0.8

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.780 
now the fuse time of mine was 0.8
seconds<00:04:37.240> what<00:04:37.450> that<00:04:37.630> means<00:04:37.870> is<00:04:38.139> from<00:04:39.070> when<00:04:39.669> the

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:39.790 
seconds what that means is from when the

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:42.300 
seconds what that means is from when the
time<00:04:40.000> you<00:04:40.150> throw<00:04:40.360> it<00:04:40.540> in<00:04:40.660> 0.8<00:04:41.650> seconds<00:04:42.100> the

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 
time you throw it in 0.8 seconds the

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:44.220 
time you throw it in 0.8 seconds the
grenade<00:04:42.580> will<00:04:42.760> actually<00:04:43.090> go<00:04:43.240> off<00:04:43.480> if<00:04:43.750> you

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:44.230 
grenade will actually go off if you

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:47.640 
grenade will actually go off if you
could<00:04:44.410> find<00:04:44.770> one<00:04:45.010> of<00:04:45.040> these<00:04:45.280> with<00:04:45.580> a<00:04:45.780> 0.0<00:04:46.780> fuse

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:47.650 
could find one of these with a 0.0 fuse

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:49.980 
could find one of these with a 0.0 fuse
time<00:04:47.889> it<00:04:48.190> would<00:04:48.310> probably<00:04:48.550> be<00:04:49.030> pretty<00:04:49.419> frickin

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:49.990 
time it would probably be pretty frickin

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:52.860 
time it would probably be pretty frickin
nice<00:04:50.320> okay<00:04:50.919> zero<00:04:51.250> point<00:04:51.550> eight<00:04:51.760> is<00:04:51.970> really<00:04:52.660> not

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
nice okay zero point eight is really not

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:54.510 
nice okay zero point eight is really not
that<00:04:52.930> bad<00:04:53.290> it's<00:04:53.560> less<00:04:53.740> than<00:04:53.919> a<00:04:54.010> second<00:04:54.430> before

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 
that bad it's less than a second before

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.760 
that bad it's less than a second before
your<00:04:54.760> grenade<00:04:55.000> will<00:04:55.150> actually<00:04:55.480> explode<00:04:55.960> zero

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:56.770 
your grenade will actually explode zero

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:00.060 
your grenade will actually explode zero
point<00:04:57.040> zero<00:04:57.130> almost<00:04:58.350> explodes<00:04:59.350> on<00:04:59.470> impact<00:04:59.500> so

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:00.070 
point zero almost explodes on impact so

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:03.360 
point zero almost explodes on impact so
definitely<00:05:00.880> look<00:05:01.090> out<00:05:01.240> for<00:05:01.419> a<00:05:01.479> zero<00:05:02.220> fuse<00:05:03.220> time

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:03.370 
definitely look out for a zero fuse time

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:05.340 
definitely look out for a zero fuse time
