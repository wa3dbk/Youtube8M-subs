00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:16.869 
but hey if they are at least it'll be

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:18.630 
but hey if they are at least it'll be
realistic<00:01:17.500> the<00:01:17.740> slow<00:01:17.979> mo<00:01:18.009> is<00:01:18.190> he<00:01:18.280> give<00:01:18.460> us<00:01:18.550> a

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
realistic the slow mo is he give us a

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.760 
realistic the slow mo is he give us a
great<00:01:18.970> opportunity<00:01:19.000> to<00:01:19.869> look<00:01:20.050> at<00:01:20.170> how<00:01:20.380> some<00:01:20.710> of

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
great opportunity to look at how some of

these animations are going to look in

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:23.460 
these animations are going to look in
game<00:01:22.570> and<00:01:22.750> I<00:01:22.869> think<00:01:23.080> they<00:01:23.229> look<00:01:23.410> fantastic

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:23.470
