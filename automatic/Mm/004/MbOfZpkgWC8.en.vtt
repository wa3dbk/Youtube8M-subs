he was already like sketched out and

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.609 
he was already like sketched out and
everything<00:01:15.420> so<00:01:15.689> all<00:01:15.720> I<00:01:15.990> was<00:01:16.259> doing<00:01:16.500> in<00:01:16.590> that

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
video was taking him inside a flash and

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.870 
video was taking him inside a flash and
just<00:01:18.869> tracing<00:01:19.530> over<00:01:19.650> to<00:01:19.860> sketch<00:01:20.130> with<00:01:20.790> the

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
just tracing over to sketch with the

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.940 
just tracing over to sketch with the
tools<00:01:21.090> and<00:01:21.270> flash<00:01:21.570> you<00:01:22.110> see<00:01:22.290> I<00:01:22.320> was<00:01:22.560> kind<00:01:22.920> of

tools and flash you see I was kind of

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.170 
tools and flash you see I was kind of

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:00.740 
did I learn this I did go to school for

Indianapolis<00:02:01.560> but<00:02:02.100> before<00:02:02.250> I<00:02:02.490> got<00:02:03.000> into

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
Indianapolis but before I got into

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.910 
Indianapolis but before I got into
school<00:02:03.630> I<00:02:03.840> was<00:02:04.020> kind<00:02:04.229> of<00:02:04.259> experiment<00:02:04.770> with

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
school I was kind of experiment with

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.590 
school I was kind of experiment with
flash<00:02:05.219> and<00:02:05.250> I<00:02:05.549> did<00:02:05.729> animations<00:02:06.299> like<00:02:06.420> the

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
flash and I did animations like the

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.180 
flash and I did animations like the
corporates<00:02:07.110> if<00:02:07.290> you<00:02:07.409> guys<00:02:07.560> have<00:02:07.770> ever<00:02:07.890> seen

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
corporates if you guys have ever seen

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.880 
corporates if you guys have ever seen
these<00:02:08.369> animations<00:02:09.170> on<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:10.349> channel<00:02:10.709> I'm

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
these animations on the channel I'm

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.760 
these animations on the channel I'm
self-taught<00:02:11.459> for<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:11.790> most<00:02:11.970> part<00:02:12.209> but<00:02:12.420> the

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
self-taught for the most part but the

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.250 
self-taught for the most part but the
real<00:02:12.890> talent<00:02:13.820> lies<00:02:14.000> in<00:02:14.330> the<00:02:14.630> ability<00:02:14.660> to<00:02:15.110> be

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
real talent lies in the ability to be

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.030 
real talent lies in the ability to be
able<00:02:15.410> to<00:02:15.800> animate<00:02:16.520> and<00:02:16.880> to<00:02:17.120> be<00:02:17.240> able<00:02:17.330> to<00:02:17.510> draw

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
able to animate and to be able to draw

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.890 
able to animate and to be able to draw
no<00:02:19.040> matter<00:02:19.250> what<00:02:19.460> software<00:02:19.790> you're<00:02:20.210> using<00:02:20.270> if

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
no matter what software you're using if

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.230 
no matter what software you're using if
you<00:02:21.260> can't<00:02:21.530> animate<00:02:21.830> and<00:02:22.190> you<00:02:22.550> can't<00:02:22.850> draw

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 
you can't animate and you can't draw

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.080 
you can't animate and you can't draw
then<00:02:24.140> it<00:02:24.470> doesn't<00:02:25.040> matter<00:02:25.370> your<00:02:25.850> works

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
then it doesn't matter your works

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:27.460 
then it doesn't matter your works
probably<00:02:26.480> not<00:02:26.600> going<00:02:26.750> to<00:02:26.840> turn<00:02:27.020> out<00:02:27.200> too<00:02:27.440> good

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
probably not going to turn out too good

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.170 
probably not going to turn out too good
because<00:02:27.920> you<00:02:28.160> can<00:02:28.190> know<00:02:28.370> all<00:02:28.580> the<00:02:28.910> tools

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
because you can know all the tools

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.570 
because you can know all the tools
inside<00:02:29.780> the<00:02:30.020> program<00:02:30.500> but<00:02:30.770> if<00:02:31.040> you<00:02:31.220> don't<00:02:31.430> have

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
inside the program but if you don't have

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.080 
inside the program but if you don't have
those<00:02:31.760> basic<00:02:32.180> principles<00:02:32.780> then<00:02:33.940> even<00:02:34.940> though

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
those basic principles then even though

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:36.730 
those basic principles then even though
I<00:02:35.120> went<00:02:35.450> to<00:02:35.570> school<00:02:35.690> for<00:02:35.840> it<00:02:36.200> doesn't<00:02:36.620> mean

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:36.740 
I went to school for it doesn't mean

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.010 
I went to school for it doesn't mean
that<00:02:36.860> you<00:02:37.130> can't<00:02:37.430> be<00:02:37.610> self-taught<00:02:38.240> like<00:02:38.930> I

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
that you can't be self-taught like I

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:40.930 
that you can't be self-taught like I
said<00:02:39.080> I<00:02:39.290> was<00:02:39.530> experimenting<00:02:40.130> inside<00:02:40.610> a<00:02:40.640> flash

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
said I was experimenting inside a flash

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.910
