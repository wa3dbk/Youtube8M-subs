00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:13.150 
cheaper so it's about 700 gp7 and 3gp to
make<00:05:09.590> an<00:05:09.740> arrow<00:05:10.390> an<00:05:11.390> arrow<00:05:11.660> orb<00:05:11.990> and<00:05:12.290> an<00:05:13.010> air

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:13.160 
make an arrow an arrow orb and an air

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:18.070 
make an arrow an arrow orb and an air
orb<00:05:13.430> is<00:05:15.340> 1300<00:05:16.340> TP<00:05:16.730> I<00:05:16.940> mean<00:05:17.360> that's<00:05:17.480> a<00:05:17.690> pretty

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:18.080 
orb is 1300 TP I mean that's a pretty

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.100 
orb is 1300 TP I mean that's a pretty
big<00:05:18.350> profit<00:05:18.830> that's<00:05:19.550> a<00:05:19.730> 600<00:05:20.210> GP<00:05:20.510> profit<00:05:20.960> per

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:21.110 
big profit that's a 600 GP profit per

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:23.620 
big profit that's a 600 GP profit per
air<00:05:21.320> orb<00:05:21.590> that<00:05:22.370> turns<00:05:22.670> out<00:05:22.880> if<00:05:23.120> you're<00:05:23.270> making

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:23.630 
air orb that turns out if you're making

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:27.220 
air orb that turns out if you're making
two<00:05:23.960> hundred<00:05:24.350> thousand<00:05:24.890> two<00:05:25.220> thousand<00:05:26.230> air

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:27.230 
two hundred thousand two thousand air

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:29.350 
two hundred thousand two thousand air
orbs<00:05:27.770> that<00:05:27.860> turns<00:05:28.190> out<00:05:28.370> to<00:05:28.430> be<00:05:28.610> a<00:05:28.730> profit<00:05:29.210> of

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 
orbs that turns out to be a profit of

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:38.030 
orbs that turns out to be a profit of
let's<00:05:30.230> see<00:05:33.610> two<00:05:34.610> thousand<00:05:35.479> times

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:38.040 
let's see two thousand times

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:42.110 
let's see two thousand times
I<00:05:38.130> think<00:05:38.670> this<00:05:38.850> is<00:05:39.000> right<00:05:39.120> one<00:05:39.450> to<00:05:40.730> one<00:05:41.730> you

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:42.120 
I think this is right one to one you

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:46.100 
I think this is right one to one you
make<00:05:42.330> 1.2<00:05:43.080> mil<00:05:43.430> so<00:05:44.430> yeah<00:05:45.210> I<00:05:45.450> think<00:05:45.630> I<00:05:45.900> bought
