let's<00:00:05.339> talk<00:00:05.490> about<00:00:05.609> what<00:00:05.940> power<00:00:06.299> is<00:00:06.720> now<00:00:07.350> power

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
let's talk about what power is now power

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.400 
let's talk about what power is now power
equals<00:00:08.309> mass<00:00:08.550> times<00:00:08.849> speed<00:00:09.599> and<00:00:09.870> how<00:00:10.349> does

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
equals mass times speed and how does

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.509 
equals mass times speed and how does
that<00:00:10.980> equate<00:00:11.610> to<00:00:12.380> combat<00:00:13.380> sports<00:00:13.710> Muay<00:00:14.309> Thai

MMA boxing or any type of striking sport

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.650 
MMA boxing or any type of striking sport
it's<00:00:17.730> the<00:00:17.910> speed<00:00:18.180> at<00:00:18.330> which<00:00:18.420> you<00:00:18.600> can

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
it's the speed at which you can

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.140 
it's the speed at which you can
accelerate<00:00:19.199> your<00:00:19.439> body<00:00:19.859> weight<00:00:20.160> and<00:00:20.189> connect

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
accelerate your body weight and connect

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.359 
accelerate your body weight and connect
power<00:00:21.480> connect<00:00:22.080> that<00:00:22.289> power<00:00:22.590> through<00:00:23.189> the

power connect that power through the
fists<00:00:23.670> and<00:00:23.939> that's<00:00:24.240> we're<00:00:24.420> gonna<00:00:24.480> get<00:00:24.660> that

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
fists and that's we're gonna get that

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.480 
fists and that's we're gonna get that
knockout<00:00:25.320> power<00:00:25.590> now<00:00:26.039> one<00:00:26.189> of<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.340> big

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
knockout power now one of the big

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.310 
knockout power now one of the big
misconceptions<00:00:26.699> that<00:00:27.390> people<00:00:27.750> have<00:00:28.080> when<00:00:28.199> it

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
misconceptions that people have when it

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.109 
misconceptions that people have when it
comes<00:00:28.500> to<00:00:28.590> developing<00:00:29.070> knockout<00:00:29.429> power<00:00:29.640> is

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
comes to developing knockout power is

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.540 
comes to developing knockout power is
that<00:00:30.330> they<00:00:30.449> have<00:00:30.599> to<00:00:30.750> build<00:00:30.990> big<00:00:31.470> huge<00:00:32.040> muscles

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
that they have to build big huge muscles

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.040 
that they have to build big huge muscles
and<00:00:32.730> that<00:00:33.149> could<00:00:33.300> be<00:00:33.390> further<00:00:33.600> from<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:33.930> truth

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
and that could be further from the truth

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.530 
and that could be further from the truth
now<00:00:34.770> increasing<00:00:35.430> your<00:00:35.520> strength<00:00:35.640> definitely

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
now increasing your strength definitely

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.479 
now increasing your strength definitely
does<00:00:36.780> play<00:00:36.989> a<00:00:37.020> part<00:00:37.110> in<00:00:37.530> developing<00:00:37.860> knockout

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
does play a part in developing knockout

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.760 
does play a part in developing knockout
power<00:00:38.730> but<00:00:39.510> there<00:00:39.690> are<00:00:39.809> other<00:00:40.020> elements<00:00:40.320> other

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
power but there are other elements other

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.799 
power but there are other elements other
more<00:00:41.340> important<00:00:41.790> elements<00:00:42.239> or<00:00:42.390> building

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
more important elements or building

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.360 
more important elements or building
blocks<00:00:42.840> that<00:00:43.110> you<00:00:43.200> need<00:00:43.379> to<00:00:43.500> develop<00:00:43.770> in<00:00:44.160> order

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
blocks that you need to develop in order

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.459 
blocks that you need to develop in order
to<00:00:44.579> get<00:00:44.730> that<00:00:44.910> knockout<00:00:45.660> punch<00:00:46.110> now<00:00:46.289> when

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
to get that knockout punch now when

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:47.810 
to get that knockout punch now when
building<00:00:46.890> and<00:00:46.980> developing<00:00:47.340> punching<00:00:47.700> power

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
building and developing punching power

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.299 
building and developing punching power
you<00:00:48.030> want<00:00:48.210> to<00:00:48.300> focus<00:00:48.510> on<00:00:48.870> five<00:00:49.170> elements<00:00:49.770> we

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
you want to focus on five elements we

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:51.650 
you want to focus on five elements we
call<00:00:50.460> these<00:00:50.640> building<00:00:51.000> blocks<00:00:51.030> because<00:00:51.510> there

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
call these building blocks because there

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.510 
call these building blocks because there
is<00:00:51.780> a<00:00:51.809> hierarchy<00:00:52.199> from<00:00:52.860> most<00:00:53.100> important<00:00:53.489> to

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
is a hierarchy from most important to

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.520 
is a hierarchy from most important to
least<00:00:53.579> important<00:00:54.210> all<00:00:54.449> are<00:00:54.840> absolutely

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
least important all are absolutely

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.110 
least important all are absolutely
important<00:00:56.039> when<00:00:56.190> you<00:00:56.280> want<00:00:56.489> to<00:00:56.550> develop<00:00:56.789> and

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
important when you want to develop and

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.000 
important when you want to develop and
increase<00:00:57.449> your<00:00:57.480> punching<00:00:57.930> power<00:00:58.079> but<00:00:58.739> there

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
increase your punching power but there

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.459 
increase your punching power but there
are<00:00:59.270> ones<00:01:00.270> you<00:01:00.420> want<00:01:00.600> to<00:01:00.690> focus<00:01:00.840> on<00:01:01.170> first

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
are ones you want to focus on first

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.860 
are ones you want to focus on first
number<00:01:01.920> one<00:01:02.070> is<00:01:02.160> technique<00:01:02.579> you<00:01:03.059> need<00:01:03.210> to<00:01:03.510> have

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
number one is technique you need to have

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.840 
number one is technique you need to have
amazing<00:01:04.500> technique<00:01:04.860> someone<00:01:05.280> who<00:01:05.670> doesn't

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
amazing technique someone who doesn't

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.039 
amazing technique someone who doesn't
have<00:01:06.000> technique<00:01:06.420> is<00:01:06.510> not<00:01:06.689> going<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:06.900> be<00:01:06.990> able

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
have technique is not going to be able

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.679 
have technique is not going to be able
to<00:01:07.229> develop<00:01:07.650> or<00:01:08.070> to<00:01:08.400> deliver<00:01:09.030> that<00:01:09.299> punching

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
to develop or to deliver that punching

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.750 
to develop or to deliver that punching
power<00:01:09.900> as<00:01:10.200> well<00:01:10.530> as<00:01:10.560> someone<00:01:10.950> who's<00:01:11.460> throwing

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
power as well as someone who's throwing

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.450 
power as well as someone who's throwing
with<00:01:12.630> great<00:01:12.960> technique<00:01:13.350> so<00:01:13.619> I'm<00:01:14.070> throwing<00:01:14.280> a

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
with great technique so I'm throwing a

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.820 
with great technique so I'm throwing a
hook<00:01:14.670> with<00:01:14.970> ugly<00:01:15.570> technique<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.560> power

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
hook with ugly technique the power

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.350 
hook with ugly technique the power
behind<00:01:17.130> that<00:01:17.369> hook<00:01:17.610> is<00:01:17.759> not<00:01:17.939> going<00:01:18.119> to<00:01:18.180> be<00:01:18.270> as

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
behind that hook is not going to be as

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.630 
behind that hook is not going to be as
strong<00:01:18.450> as<00:01:18.869> if<00:01:19.380> I'm<00:01:19.560> coming<00:01:19.799> with<00:01:20.280> a<00:01:20.340> nice

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
strong as if I'm coming with a nice

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.200 
strong as if I'm coming with a nice
tight<00:01:21.920> technical<00:01:22.920> punch<00:01:23.700> all<00:01:23.909> right<00:01:24.030> so

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
tight technical punch all right so

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.969 
tight technical punch all right so
technique<00:01:24.600> is<00:01:24.750> number<00:01:25.020> one<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.680> ways<00:01:25.830> you

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
technique is number one and the ways you

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.560 
technique is number one and the ways you
can<00:01:26.100> train<00:01:26.310> your<00:01:26.430> technique<00:01:26.790> is<00:01:26.939> obviously

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
can train your technique is obviously

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.480 
can train your technique is obviously
shadow<00:01:27.900> box<00:01:28.200> and<00:01:28.409> shadow<00:01:28.590> boxing<00:01:28.950> in<00:01:29.040> front<00:01:29.280> of

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
shadow box and shadow boxing in front of

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.580 
shadow box and shadow boxing in front of
a<00:01:29.700> mirror<00:01:30.000> to<00:01:30.150> ensure<00:01:30.930> that<00:01:31.110> you<00:01:31.229> have<00:01:31.259> that

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
a mirror to ensure that you have that

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.800 
a mirror to ensure that you have that
right<00:01:31.829> technique<00:01:32.250> making<00:01:33.090> adjustments<00:01:33.689> but

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
right technique making adjustments but

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.749 
right technique making adjustments but
shadow<00:01:34.140> boxing<00:01:34.560> on<00:01:34.650> a<00:01:34.680> daily<00:01:34.979> basis<00:01:35.340> will<00:01:35.729> help

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
shadow boxing on a daily basis will help

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.999 
shadow boxing on a daily basis will help
you<00:01:35.970> develop<00:01:36.150> that<00:01:36.390> texture<00:01:36.750> is<00:01:36.960> speed<00:01:37.439> so

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
you develop that texture is speed so

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.770 
you develop that texture is speed so
this<00:01:38.280> should<00:01:38.460> be<00:01:38.549> kind<00:01:39.180> of<00:01:39.270> obvious<00:01:39.450> because

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
this should be kind of obvious because

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.440 
this should be kind of obvious because
it<00:01:40.079> is<00:01:40.170> in<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.619> equation<00:01:41.070> power<00:01:41.520> equals<00:01:41.970> mass

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
it is in the equation power equals mass

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.300 
it is in the equation power equals mass
times<00:01:42.479> speed<00:01:43.110> but<00:01:43.350> you<00:01:43.680> really<00:01:43.890> have<00:01:44.040> to<00:01:44.189> be

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
times speed but you really have to be

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.370

able to throw that power punch quickly

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.840 
able to throw that power punch quickly
you<00:01:46.439> want<00:01:46.619> to<00:01:46.680> be<00:01:46.770> able<00:01:46.860> to<00:01:47.040> accelerate<00:01:47.399> very

you want to be able to accelerate very

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.480 
you want to be able to accelerate very
fast<00:01:48.540> accelerate<00:01:49.380> that<00:01:49.530> body<00:01:49.860> weight<00:01:50.130> really

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
fast accelerate that body weight really

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.719 
fast accelerate that body weight really
fast<00:01:50.820> and<00:01:51.060> ways<00:01:51.299> to<00:01:51.329> to<00:01:51.960> develop<00:01:52.409> that<00:01:52.560> is<00:01:53.159> by

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
fast and ways to to develop that is by

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.550 
fast and ways to to develop that is by

throwing a punch and I'm just finishing
up<00:02:22.220> a<00:02:22.370> punch<00:02:22.610> well<00:02:23.150> you<00:02:23.240> can<00:02:23.360> actually<00:02:23.480> use<00:02:23.870> my

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
up a punch well you can actually use my

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.860 
up a punch well you can actually use my
weight<00:02:25.280> moving<00:02:25.700> forward<00:02:26.090> my<00:02:26.270> weight<00:02:26.480> transfer

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
weight moving forward my weight transfer

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.810 
weight moving forward my weight transfer
moving<00:02:27.140> forward<00:02:27.530> and<00:02:27.740> throw<00:02:28.040> a<00:02:28.130> very<00:02:28.190> short

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
moving forward and throw a very short

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.780 
moving forward and throw a very short
hook<00:02:29.750> uppercut<00:02:30.290> or<00:02:30.710> jab<00:02:31.190> and<00:02:31.520> actually

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
hook uppercut or jab and actually

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.790 
hook uppercut or jab and actually
knocked<00:02:31.940> me<00:02:32.120> out<00:02:32.150> by<00:02:32.450> using<00:02:32.630> my<00:02:33.230> way<00:02:33.440> coming

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
knocked me out by using my way coming

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.220 
knocked me out by using my way coming
through<00:02:34.150> and<00:02:35.150> you're<00:02:35.390> a<00:02:35.510> short<00:02:35.810> quick

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
through and you're a short quick

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:37.570 
through and you're a short quick
powerful<00:02:37.070> punch

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
powerful punch

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.760 
powerful punch
so<00:02:37.970> again<00:02:38.300> timing<00:02:38.840> is<00:02:38.960> everything<00:02:39.080> learning

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
so again timing is everything learning

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.430 
so again timing is everything learning
that<00:02:40.130> timing<00:02:40.520> and<00:02:40.820> practicing<00:02:41.360> accuracy<00:02:41.960> will

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
that timing and practicing accuracy will

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.980 
that timing and practicing accuracy will
help<00:02:42.620> you<00:02:43.090> increase<00:02:44.090> and<00:02:44.330> develop<00:02:44.630> that<00:02:44.750> power

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:44.990 
help you increase and develop that power

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:46.840 
help you increase and develop that power
the<00:02:45.260> number<00:02:45.470> four<00:02:45.710> is<00:02:45.920> strength<00:02:46.280> training<00:02:46.580> and

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
the number four is strength training and

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:48.550 
the number four is strength training and
this<00:02:47.480> may<00:02:47.690> be<00:02:47.750> a<00:02:47.870> little<00:02:48.080> bit<00:02:48.230> different<00:02:48.500> from

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
this may be a little bit different from

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.020 
this may be a little bit different from
what<00:02:48.740> you're<00:02:48.860> thinking<00:02:49.310> again<00:02:49.760> it's<00:02:49.910> not

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
what you're thinking again it's not

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.090 
what you're thinking again it's not
about<00:02:50.180> building<00:02:50.480> big<00:02:50.870> huge<00:02:51.110> muscles<00:02:51.560> but<00:02:51.980> it's

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
about building big huge muscles but it's

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.710 
about building big huge muscles but it's
about<00:02:52.250> increasing<00:02:52.550> the<00:02:52.880> strength<00:02:53.180> and<00:02:53.360> the

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
about increasing the strength and the

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.480 
about increasing the strength and the
muscles<00:02:54.200> that<00:02:54.320> you<00:02:54.470> use<00:02:54.500> when<00:02:55.400> you're

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:55.490 
muscles that you use when you're

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:58.090 
muscles that you use when you're
throwing<00:02:55.790> a<00:02:56.090> punch<00:02:56.390> so<00:02:56.690> from<00:02:57.590> the<00:02:57.710> book<00:02:57.890> from
