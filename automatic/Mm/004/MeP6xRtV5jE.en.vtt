00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:17.849
 this circular of the family of waters 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.369
 decided to settle 

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:21.509
 following a professional transfer they 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.750
 have had a crush on the commune 

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:27.600
 for this house which required a 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.910
 overall renovation but it was necessary 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:32.010
 also add an extension to it so 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.400
 that he can house their family of five 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:35.750
 people 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.750
 with three young children 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.850
 we wanted to buy a house and we 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:42.350
 had a number of constraints 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.090
 and the first is that we had 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.800
 need a lot of room we have 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.720
 three little children and so he's us 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.390
 needed four rooms of space 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.490
 a garden and we wanted to be located 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.340
 in a nice area close to a 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:57.950
 city â€‹â€‹center and so to achieve this 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:00.350
 project in our budget the solution that 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:01.550
 was buying this house that was 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.059
 an old house that needed 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:08.080
 to be completely renovated and enlarged 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:08.080
 but which was very well located 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.660
 so we of course made use of 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.340
 several companies to make 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:17.100
 quote and what immediately made the 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.350
 difference in favor of renault towards the 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.550
 first is that the first 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.890
 difference is that they moved 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:25.590
 and especially they immediately showed 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.350
 a lot of enthusiasm and a lot 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.450
 ingenuity for our project 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.710
 so from the first visit it makes you 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.310
 suggestions we have one we have 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.810
 retained in particular in terms the 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.950
 Opening Locations to Learn 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.610
 between them since we changed places 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.490
 from the front door 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.330
 so we enjoyed it and it's 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.270
 true that there were a number of 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:47.190
 technical challenges in particular 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.020
 accessibility very difficult since 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.720
 the extension is at the back of the 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:55.310
 field and in addition the land is located 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.310
 Highly elevated compared to the street 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.659
 for renovation and construction 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.680
 we had to solve many 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:05.380
 supply constraints 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.970
 it's here from this plot to 4 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.679
 meters above the level of 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.270
 the avenue de verdun that we had 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.910
 to deliver materials 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.260
 it was obviously necessary to start with 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.060
 the excavator the mini excavator 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.030
 mechanical that served for excavations 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.430
 and the earthworks but also the 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.860
 other materials since the concrete that has 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.400
 been powered by a truck pump since 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.250
 a spinning top 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.910
 it's also the other materials the 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.250
 floor 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:32.290
 the cladding the metal frame well 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:36.220
 obviously the cover and the tiles 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:37.799
 and all this from the street here the avenue 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.690
 of verdun which is a main axis 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:42.610
 to arrive in ecully with a way of 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.440
 bus for any deliveries 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.819
 the street was cut off we have at each 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.660
 times does the traffic to allow 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:51.700
 to maintain a fluid circulation for 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.860
 solve the double constraint of deadlines 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.180
 but also the supply 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.830
 here in the bottom of parcel 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.890
 we propose a structure 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:02.049
 constructive sex this one is composed 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.780
 a metal frame and a 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:07.269
 expanded polystyrene cladding that we 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.920
 let's see in the process of finishing this system 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:11.140
 constructive also presents 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.750
 the advantage of being used to wear what 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:16.080
 limits the professional problems related 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.850
 heavy loads 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:21.400
 it is an upstream diagnosis that has 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:23.350
 allowed to adapt solutions at once 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.470
 to customer expectations but also 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.640
 at the existing house 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.500
 sir and lady ghetto had a 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.900
 strong expectation in terms of redevelopment 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.440
 and bright comfort for this piece 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.480
 to live 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.820
 so we did the demolition 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.680
 partitions the opening piercing 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.870
 in the walls and in the roof is 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.230
 also to the modification of drilling 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.230
 existing 

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:58.470
 our consulting role also has us 

00:03:56.879 --> 00:04:00.000
 made to make proposals 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.950
 concerning thermal comfort 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.650
 we suggested isolation 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:06.239
 reinforced for the walls but also 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.379
 for the roof as well as the 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:10.040
 replacement of all 

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:12.629
 pvc joinery double glazing 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:14.849
 we also proposed the 

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:18.410
 heating change with a 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:18.410
 hot water storage 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:23.010
 and of course we created a 

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:25.980
 ventilation network with a vmc 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:27.630
 humidity-sensitive when we have 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:28.980
 met the turf husband we were 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.630
 listening to their expectations than to their 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:33.980
 main constraint was a delay 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:33.980
 short in the construction site 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:39.540
 he needed to be installed in the 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.620
 existing house renovated late July for 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.480
 to be able to go back to school 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.980
 children in September in the new 

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.660
 school and he wanted in a second 

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:48.170
 time have the extension to 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.170
 autumn 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.730
 so we offer them a 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:55.040
 organization of the project in two phases 

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:57.440
 the first being the renovation of the 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:59.810
 existing house that started in April 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:01.460
 for a delivery late July the 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:03.950
 second being the realization of 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:06.220
 the extension with a beginning end of may for 

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:08.220
 a late delivery when 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.220
 Oh 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:14.340
 we really saw the added value of 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:17.289
 take to take to master builder 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:18.759
 rather than managing its renovation 

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:19.930
 by engaging oneself different 

00:05:18.759 --> 00:05:22.479
 artisans and by managing the 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:25.349
 relations with craftsmen since in 

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:27.909
 a site of this type of peer always 

00:05:25.349 --> 00:05:29.559
 inevitably difficulties that happens from 

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:30.789
 things that are not that turns out not 

00:05:29.559 --> 00:05:34.839
 not be as we wished 

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:37.899
 departure and thanks to renovate we could 

00:05:34.839 --> 00:05:41.409
 treat all these subjects serenely 

00:05:37.899 --> 00:05:44.020
 they have always been very present 

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:46.089
 at the whole site and we have more 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:47.289
 precisely during all these 

00:05:46.089 --> 00:05:49.240
 very regular site meetings 

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:53.289
 make the point say what was wrong 

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:55.419
 and so we relieved ourselves a lot of 

00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:59.189
 of stress that all these little ones all these 

00:05:55.419 --> 00:05:59.189
 little worries republic rene
