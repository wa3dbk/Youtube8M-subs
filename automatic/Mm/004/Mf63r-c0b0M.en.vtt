someone nicked up in this drill but
we're<00:02:13.270> really<00:02:13.480> teaching<00:02:14.160> again<00:02:15.160> the

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
we're really teaching again the

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.340 
we're really teaching again the

great<00:02:25.360> look<00:02:25.569> here<00:02:25.780> on<00:02:26.020> 96th<00:02:26.770> again<00:02:27.490> I<00:02:27.520> can't

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:27.849 
great look here on 96th again I can't

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:29.040 
great look here on 96th again I can't
say<00:02:28.060> it<00:02:28.180> enough<00:02:28.270> if<00:02:28.630> you're<00:02:28.810> teaching

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
say it enough if you're teaching

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.990 
say it enough if you're teaching
defensive<00:02:29.830> football<00:02:30.090> its<00:02:31.090> key<00:02:31.480> in<00:02:32.410> terms<00:02:32.680> of

defensive football its key in terms of

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.089 
defensive football its key in terms of
the<00:02:34.000> feeling<00:02:34.330> of<00:02:34.450> lack<00:02:34.630> it's<00:02:35.500> really

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:36.099 
the feeling of lack it's really

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:38.190 
the feeling of lack it's really
important<00:02:36.610> that<00:02:36.970> if<00:02:37.150> the<00:02:37.300> ball<00:02:37.569> carrier<00:02:38.110> is

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
important that if the ball carrier is

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.790 
important that if the ball carrier is
going<00:02:38.470> this<00:02:38.709> way<00:02:39.239> that<00:02:40.239> the<00:02:40.750> defender<00:02:41.350> walk

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
going this way that the defender walk

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.160 
going this way that the defender walk
out<00:02:42.130> and<00:02:42.370> strain<00:02:43.030> until<00:02:43.510> the<00:02:43.600> ball<00:02:43.810> carrier

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
out and strain until the ball carrier

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.699 
out and strain until the ball carrier
commits<00:02:45.300> the<00:02:46.300> ball<00:02:46.510> Keller<00:02:46.750> can<00:02:46.959> cut<00:02:47.200> back<00:02:47.380> so

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 
commits the ball Keller can cut back so

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:49.410 
commits the ball Keller can cut back so
it's<00:02:48.010> really<00:02:48.250> important<00:02:48.670> that<00:02:48.730> we<00:02:48.850> stray<00:02:49.180> in<00:02:49.390> a

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
it's really important that we stray in a

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:50.880 
it's really important that we stray in a
lockout<00:02:49.780> and<00:02:49.959> move<00:02:50.050> until<00:02:50.230> the<00:02:50.380> ball<00:02:50.560> carrier

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
lockout and move until the ball carrier

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.130 
lockout and move until the ball carrier
commits<00:02:51.190> soon<00:02:51.910> as<00:02:52.030> the<00:02:52.150> ball<00:02:52.330> carrier<00:02:52.720> commits

to<00:02:53.319> this<00:02:53.440> gap<00:02:53.709> it's<00:02:54.010> important<00:02:54.459> we<00:02:54.550> take<00:02:54.790> this

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
to this gap it's important we take this

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.780 
to this gap it's important we take this
foot<00:02:55.300> and<00:02:55.480> get<00:02:55.660> it<00:02:55.810> to<00:02:55.989> our<00:02:56.140> midline<00:02:56.440> and<00:02:56.950> then

framework of the body it's really

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.330 
framework of the body it's really

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:25.239 
intended direction which in this case

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:27.809 
intended direction which in this case
would<00:03:25.450> be<00:03:25.510> the<00:03:25.660> right<00:03:25.930> and<00:03:26.140> then<00:03:26.830> finish<00:03:27.670> on

00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:27.819 
would be the right and then finish on

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:32.940 
would be the right and then finish on
three<00:03:28.090> with<00:03:28.269> the<00:03:28.360> tackle<00:03:31.560> and<00:03:32.560> again<00:03:32.799> we

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
three with the tackle and again we

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:34.229 
three with the tackle and again we
looked<00:03:33.130> at<00:03:33.280> it<00:03:33.400> again<00:03:33.489> because<00:03:33.820> it's<00:03:33.940> really

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
looked at it again because it's really

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:35.970 
looked at it again because it's really
important<00:03:34.900> and<00:03:34.989> it's<00:03:35.470> where<00:03:35.680> I'm<00:03:35.829> most

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
important and it's where I'm most

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:37.979 
important and it's where I'm most
overlooked<00:03:36.579> aspects<00:03:37.120> of<00:03:37.269> defeating<00:03:37.690> a<00:03:37.780> block

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
overlooked aspects of defeating a block

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:40.199 
overlooked aspects of defeating a block
most<00:03:38.709> people<00:03:39.100> just<00:03:39.310> teach<00:03:39.489> the<00:03:39.700> strain<00:03:40.000> and

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209 
most people just teach the strain and

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:42.479 
most people just teach the strain and
then<00:03:40.269> rip<00:03:40.540> that<00:03:40.750> the<00:03:41.350> back<00:03:41.560> foot<00:03:41.859> is<00:03:42.010> got<00:03:42.310> to

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:42.489 
then rip that the back foot is got to

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:49.580 
then rip that the back foot is got to
come<00:03:43.140> away<00:03:44.140> from<00:03:44.410> the<00:03:44.650> intended<00:03:45.070> direction

here's<00:03:50.590> a<00:03:50.709> good<00:03:50.859> clip<00:03:51.130> of<00:03:51.400> a<00:03:51.700> dog<00:03:51.970> there's<00:03:52.269> a

here's a good clip of a dog there's a

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:54.569 
here's a good clip of a dog there's a
linebacker<00:03:52.630> and<00:03:53.200> again<00:03:53.739> we<00:03:53.890> never<00:03:54.070> left<00:03:54.370> them

drill again we try to keep it consistent
with<00:05:06.140> our<00:05:06.260> fundamentals<00:05:06.860> big<00:05:07.580> base<00:05:07.960> trying<00:05:08.960> to

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.050 
with our fundamentals big base trying to

with our fundamentals big base trying to
get<00:05:09.230> around<00:05:09.410> on<00:05:09.680> the<00:05:09.770> first<00:05:10.010> step<00:05:10.220> trying<00:05:10.400> to

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:10.490 
get around on the first step trying to

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:11.920 
get around on the first step trying to
get<00:05:10.610> your<00:05:10.730> second<00:05:11.150> foot<00:05:11.270> on<00:05:11.390> the<00:05:11.480> ground<00:05:11.600> and

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:11.930 
get your second foot on the ground and

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:14.950 
get your second foot on the ground and
get<00:05:12.050> it<00:05:12.140> down<00:05:12.320> the<00:05:12.980> midline<00:05:13.220> and<00:05:13.670> again<00:05:14.660> at

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:14.960 
get it down the midline and again at

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.500 
get it down the midline and again at
that<00:05:15.080> point<00:05:15.140> it's<00:05:15.650> rub<00:05:16.220> the<00:05:16.370> ribs<00:05:16.550> with<00:05:17.360> your

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:17.510 
that point it's rub the ribs with your

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:21.040 
that point it's rub the ribs with your
elbows<00:05:17.840> thumbs<00:05:18.440> up<00:05:18.710> hands<00:05:19.400> in<00:05:19.550> low<00:05:20.390> pads<00:05:20.690> and

an inside leverage with your hands then

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:30.300 
an inside leverage with your hands then
good<00:05:28.280> job<00:05:28.490> bring<00:05:28.700> in<00:05:28.790> his<00:05:28.880> feet

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:30.310 
good job bring in his feet

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:32.770 
good job bring in his feet
well<00:05:31.310> done<00:05:31.550> again<00:05:31.820> the<00:05:31.850> other<00:05:32.060> idea<00:05:32.540> is<00:05:32.600> an

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:32.780 
well done again the other idea is an

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:35.110 
well done again the other idea is an
idea<00:05:32.950> it's<00:05:33.950> an<00:05:34.130> historic<00:05:34.580> day<00:05:34.610> in<00:05:34.790> the<00:05:34.970> game

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:35.120 
idea it's an historic day in the game

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.450 
idea it's an historic day in the game
and<00:05:35.300> I<00:05:35.330> think<00:05:35.390> it<00:05:35.660> has<00:05:35.840> real<00:05:36.140> value<00:05:36.170> today<00:05:36.740> then

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:37.460 
and I think it has real value today then

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:39.120 
and I think it has real value today then
probably<00:05:37.850> at<00:05:37.940> any<00:05:38.390> time<00:05:38.660> in<00:05:38.810> our<00:05:38.870> history

probably at any time in our history

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:41.740 
probably at any time in our history
primarily<00:05:40.130> because<00:05:40.310> it<00:05:40.610> allows<00:05:40.940> us<00:05:41.210> to<00:05:41.420> reduce

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:41.750 
primarily because it allows us to reduce

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:44.710 
primarily because it allows us to reduce
the<00:05:41.930> risk<00:05:42.140> of<00:05:42.350> injury<00:05:42.940> allows<00:05:43.940> us<00:05:44.120> to<00:05:44.300> control

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:44.720 
the risk of injury allows us to control

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:50.230 
the risk of injury allows us to control
and<00:05:45.020> convince<00:05:46.660> the<00:05:47.860> the<00:05:48.860> moving<00:05:49.400> parts<00:05:49.760> and
