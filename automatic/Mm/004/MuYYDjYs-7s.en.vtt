00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.340 
have my own thoughts about this I tend

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:21.599 
have my own thoughts about this I tend
to<00:04:18.489> think<00:04:18.790> that<00:04:19.350> the<00:04:20.350> original<00:04:21.010> seems<00:04:21.310> to<00:04:21.459> be<00:04:21.579> a

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:21.609 
to think that the original seems to be a

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:25.710 
to think that the original seems to be a
little<00:04:21.790> bit<00:04:22.000> beefier<00:04:23.669> the<00:04:24.669> reissue<00:04:25.030> seems<00:04:25.540> to

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
little bit beefier the reissue seems to

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.250 
little bit beefier the reissue seems to
have<00:04:25.870> a<00:04:25.900> little<00:04:26.229> more<00:04:26.380> high<00:04:26.680> handy<00:04:27.190> bite<00:04:28.260> but

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:29.260 
have a little more high handy bite but

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.189 
have a little more high handy bite but
it<00:04:29.380> seems<00:04:29.650> to<00:04:29.830> be<00:04:29.889> livelier<00:04:30.820> so<00:04:31.300> I<00:04:31.720> guess<00:04:32.050> you

00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:32.199 
it seems to be livelier so I guess you

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:34.969 
it seems to be livelier so I guess you
could<00:04:32.410> kind<00:04:32.620> of<00:04:32.680> go<00:04:32.800> either<00:04:33.010> way<00:04:33.130> with<00:04:33.280> it<00:04:33.960> I

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:34.979 
could kind of go either way with it I

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:36.719 
could kind of go either way with it I
don't<00:04:35.979> think<00:04:36.010> you<00:04:36.190> could<00:04:36.310> go<00:04:36.460> wrong<00:04:36.669> with

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:36.729 
don't think you could go wrong with

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:41.909 
don't think you could go wrong with
either<00:04:37.150> one<00:04:37.680> so<00:04:39.240> I'm<00:04:40.240> going<00:04:40.479> to<00:04:40.830> try<00:04:41.830> a<00:04:41.860> couple
