00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
because I've been alternating I try to

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.210

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:02.940 
think if you like a sponge in that's

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.210 
think if you like a sponge in that's
great<00:02:03.210> but<00:02:03.480> if<00:02:03.690> you're<00:02:03.840> not<00:02:03.990> used<00:02:04.380> to<00:02:04.530> it<00:02:04.650> then

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220
