would<00:05:31.380> have<00:05:31.410> not<00:05:31.680> brought<00:05:31.950> the<00:05:32.510> big<00:05:33.510> belt<00:05:33.810> he

00:05:34.339 --> 00:05:34.349 
would have not brought the big belt he

00:05:34.349 --> 00:05:37.520 
would have not brought the big belt he
was<00:05:34.590> with<00:05:35.130> the<00:05:35.310> small<00:05:35.639> belt<00:05:36.110> so<00:05:37.110> that<00:05:37.289> what

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:37.530 
was with the small belt so that what

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:39.110 
was with the small belt so that what
that's<00:05:37.710> what's<00:05:37.950> really<00:05:38.160> cool<00:05:38.430> about<00:05:38.520> this<00:05:38.910> he

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:39.120 
that's what's really cool about this he

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.420 
that's what's really cool about this he
actually<00:05:39.240> brought<00:05:39.720> the<00:05:39.960> big<00:05:40.169> belt<00:05:40.470> because<00:05:41.220> I

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:41.430 
actually brought the big belt because I

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:44.060 
actually brought the big belt because I
was<00:05:41.610> actually<00:05:41.820> thinking<00:05:42.740> about<00:05:43.740> when<00:05:44.039> I

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:44.070 
was actually thinking about when I

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:45.680 
was actually thinking about when I
display<00:05:44.460> here<00:05:44.849> I<00:05:44.940> was<00:05:45.060> actually<00:05:45.240> gonna<00:05:45.479> go

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:45.690 
display here I was actually gonna go

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:48.020 
display here I was actually gonna go
ahead<00:05:45.720> and<00:05:46.080> put<00:05:46.260> him<00:05:46.349> on<00:05:46.530> a<00:05:46.740> big<00:05:47.400> boat<00:05:47.639> and<00:05:47.669> just

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:48.030 
ahead and put him on a big boat and just

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:55.100 
ahead and put him on a big boat and just
probably<00:05:48.240> just<00:05:48.419> paint<00:05:49.260> NWO<00:05:50.160> on<00:05:50.340> it<00:05:52.130> but<00:05:53.130> um<00:05:54.110> but

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:55.110 
probably just paint NWO on it but um but

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:57.290 
probably just paint NWO on it but um but
actually<00:05:55.530> I'm<00:05:55.860> glad<00:05:56.010> I<00:05:56.160> didn't<00:05:57.120> do<00:05:57.270> that

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:57.300 
actually I'm glad I didn't do that

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:00.890 
actually I'm glad I didn't do that
because<00:05:57.479> I<00:05:58.169> gave<00:05:58.530> that<00:05:58.770> belt<00:05:59.039> to<00:05:59.280> my<00:05:59.900> American

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:00.900
