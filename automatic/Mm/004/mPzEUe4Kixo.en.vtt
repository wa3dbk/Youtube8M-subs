00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
on-screen is actually going is actually

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.939 
on-screen is actually going is actually
the<00:00:47.969> final<00:00:48.390> development<00:00:48.749> model<00:00:49.289> of<00:00:49.469> the

00:00:49.939 --> 00:00:49.949 
the final development model of the

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:51.559 
the final development model of the
iphone<00:00:50.219> 6<00:00:50.579> and<00:00:50.730> you<00:00:50.819> can<00:00:50.940> see<00:00:51.120> that<00:00:51.149> there<00:00:51.420> is<00:00:51.449> a

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:51.569 
iphone 6 and you can see that there is a

00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:54.009 
iphone 6 and you can see that there is a
whole<00:00:51.839> lot<00:00:52.019> of<00:00:52.050> grooves<00:00:52.859> and<00:00:53.159> different

00:00:54.009 --> 00:00:54.019 
whole lot of grooves and different

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:56.869 
whole lot of grooves and different
indentations<00:00:55.019> in<00:00:55.289> that<00:00:55.559> rear<00:00:56.249> shell<00:00:56.609> and

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
indentations in that rear shell and

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.299 
indentations in that rear shell and
that's<00:00:57.659> probably<00:00:58.350> where<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.949> internal

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
that's probably where the internal

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.009 
that's probably where the internal
components<00:00:59.999> are<00:01:00.120> going<00:01:00.269> to<00:01:00.329> sit<00:01:00.449> when<00:01:00.719> the

00:01:01.009 --> 00:01:01.019 
components are going to sit when the

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:03.979 
components are going to sit when the
entire<00:01:01.979> phone<00:01:02.399> is<00:01:02.609> manufactured<00:01:03.329> and<00:01:03.569> to

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
entire phone is manufactured and to

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.390 
entire phone is manufactured and to
decided<00:01:04.379> that<00:01:04.500> you<00:01:04.589> can<00:01:04.739> see<00:01:04.890> some<00:01:05.190> of<00:01:05.220> the

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
decided that you can see some of the

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.310 
decided that you can see some of the
dummy<00:01:05.610> units<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:06.240> basically<00:01:06.840> what<00:01:07.140> this

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
dummy units and basically what this

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.679 
dummy units and basically what this
person<00:01:07.890> is<00:01:08.070> trying<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.460> let<00:01:08.820> us<00:01:08.940> know<00:01:08.970> is<00:01:09.329> that

person is trying to let us know is that

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.859 
person is trying to let us know is that
the<00:01:10.439> dummy<00:01:11.070> units<00:01:11.219> are<00:01:11.520> very<00:01:12.060> very<00:01:12.329> identical

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
the dummy units are very very identical

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.530 
the dummy units are very very identical
or<00:01:13.140> very<00:01:13.170> representative<00:01:14.100> of<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:15.149> final

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
or very representative of the final

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.649 
or very representative of the final
iphone<00:01:16.380> 6<00:01:16.740> which<00:01:17.100> is<00:01:17.130> in<00:01:17.549> manufacturing<00:01:18.390> stage

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
iphone 6 which is in manufacturing stage

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.050 
iphone 6 which is in manufacturing stage
right<00:01:18.960> now<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:19.409> so<00:01:20.399> that's<00:01:20.520> a<00:01:20.670> really<00:01:20.700> nice

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
right now and so that's a really nice

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.090 
right now and so that's a really nice
sign<00:01:21.329> because<00:01:21.750> I've<00:01:22.079> been<00:01:22.110> covering<00:01:22.439> iphone<00:01:22.860> 6

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
sign because I've been covering iphone 6

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.219 
sign because I've been covering iphone 6
for<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.549> past<00:01:24.060> I<00:01:24.420> don't<00:01:24.570> know<00:01:24.659> two<00:01:24.869> or<00:01:24.899> three

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
for the past I don't know two or three

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.990 
for the past I don't know two or three
months<00:01:25.409> here<00:01:25.710> playing<00:01:26.009> for<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.250> countless

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
months here playing for the countless

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.480 
months here playing for the countless
videos<00:01:27.380> released<00:01:28.380> on<00:01:28.649> the<00:01:28.740> iphone<00:01:28.770> 6<00:01:29.250> I

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
videos released on the iphone 6 I

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.160 
videos released on the iphone 6 I
shouldn't<00:01:29.700> say<00:01:29.789> countless<00:01:30.090> but<00:01:30.360> quite<00:01:31.049> a<00:01:31.079> few

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
shouldn't say countless but quite a few

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.440 
shouldn't say countless but quite a few
videos<00:01:31.469> really<00:01:32.100> talking<00:01:32.700> about<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.939> iphone<00:01:33.240> 6

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
videos really talking about the iphone 6

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.469 
videos really talking about the iphone 6
and<00:01:33.689> leaked<00:01:33.960> images<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:34.710> whatnot<00:01:35.159> and<00:01:35.479> it's

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
and leaked images and whatnot and it's

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.719 
and leaked images and whatnot and it's
nice<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:36.780> know<00:01:36.930> that<00:01:36.960> those<00:01:37.799> leaked<00:01:38.340> images

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
nice to know that those leaked images

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.060 
nice to know that those leaked images
are<00:01:38.880> actually<00:01:39.210> representative<00:01:39.899> of<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.560> final

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
are actually representative of the final

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.880 
are actually representative of the final
design<00:01:41.579> and<00:01:42.090> which<00:01:42.960> means<00:01:43.200> that<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.649> round

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
design and which means that the round

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.510 
design and which means that the round
design<00:01:44.280> is<00:01:44.939> going<00:01:45.390> to<00:01:45.539> be<00:01:45.659> present<00:01:46.200> versus<00:01:46.710> on

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
design is going to be present versus on

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.880 
design is going to be present versus on
the<00:01:47.729> iphone<00:01:48.060> 5s<00:01:48.479> currently<00:01:48.990> we<00:01:49.140> have<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.560> kind
