00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 Hello, I'm a dark world and welcome 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.660
 back to my channel today I bring you a 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.610
 new video this time is from black ops 2 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.980
 in a normal competitive screen and 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.809
 current 4 against 4 take the flag in 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.580
 network and I will take this gameplay 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.190
 to introduce a new chapter of 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.210
 guides and tricks in black ops 2 and is that 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.850
 today I wanted to do an analysis 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.710
 empirical analysis with real data and 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.539
 concrete to compare two of the weapons 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.160
 what more controversy do you bring in this game 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.990
 and when I say controversy I say 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.640
 confusion among players both in 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.679
 the competitive environment as in the field 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.480
 of public games we do not know which 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.160
 use we do not know which one is better at the end and 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.140
 in the end it is that sometimes we look for the 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.550
 wrong concept of perfection 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.140
 in a weapon we want a weapon to be 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.820
 valid for each and every one of the 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.950
 situations that can reach us 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.989
 present the game and that in a game 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.550
 where the weapons are very balanced and 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.590
 where white hector can present us 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.329
 a lot of different situations is 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.039
 very difficult and when I say that weapons 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.110
 are balanced I do not mean that the 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.030
 aspects of cadence or recharge damage are 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.770
 very similar but the advantages that 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.350
 it provides us with a 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.180
 provides the other and vice versa so 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.830
 in this episode of guides and tricks in 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.570
 mostly blank white will 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.670
 focus on 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.110
 and competitive to compare two of the 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.670
 assault assault rifles that more 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:14.260
 controversy they bring when playing 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:16.490
 which one we should use if really one 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:18.470
 provides more advantages to the player than 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.880
 another one and I'm going to focus on real data and 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.320
 we are going to do little to 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.930
 little let's start with the analysis 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.690
 now that we have here the interface of 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.490
 given data forgive the weapon 8 to 1 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.110
 let's focus on the maximum damage of 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.990
 I will compare both weapons with the 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.940
 27 was 8 to 1 totally predictable 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.729
 It has a total damage of 35 points on 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.470
 100 m 27 a damage of 32 slightly 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:40.880
 less at short distances will not do 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.009
 it's not going to be a harm that we're going to 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.810
 notice too much since they are two weapons that 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:46.130
 they have very different shooting modes on 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.649
 everything over long distances is going to see 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:51.020
 somewhat affected the minimum damage to the 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:53.899
 hand is also higher 24 points on 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.940
 100 and slightly lower 22 for 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:58.280
 the m 27 if you add both damages leaves the 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.509
 total damage that both weapons have come 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.190
 which are practically very 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:03.679
 similar at the time of playing goes to 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:05.000
 influence minimally more half and 

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:06.950
 long distances although to short 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.539
 distances are going to have to depend not 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.070
 of the damage but of other factors that 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.340
 now let's see how the cadence or the 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.410
 shooting mode 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.769
 Loader capacity 32 bullets for the 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:19.110
 m 8 to 12 - for m 27 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:20.640
 well a difference not too much 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.560
 abysmal between both weapons but of 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.599
 moment at least 8 to 1 is maintained by 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.920
 above the appearance of the level the level 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:28.200
 for the competitive field is 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.549
 practically an irrelevant data for 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.739
 those that you play in public games 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:33.989
 This data will seem more important to you 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:36.569
 the m 8 to 1 is unlocked at level 49 and the 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:39.150
 emea 27 to level 31 is a bad memory 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:40.980
 the ammunition completely alien to the charger 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.540
 that we can have when 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.000
 reappears mos the ammunition that we have 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.760
 extra the weapon made to about 96 bullets 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.780
 also superior to that of the m 27 that is 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:53.459
 is left with 90 good for now regretted 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.140
 we still do not see that it stays above in 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:56.819
 each and every one of the aspects but 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.650
 neither with very abysmal differences 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:01.590
 but pay attention to this the recharge 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:04.349
 recharge at m 8 to 1 is 225 while 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.930
 in the in 27 is much faster 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:08.400
 195 seconds the recharge especially in the 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.349
 competitive environment those we play 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.450
 it is very important that it be as fast as possible 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:15.130
 possible and in 27 is an assault rifle 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:18.070
 that allows us to have a recharge 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.510
 quite fast as opposed to the 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:21.940
 mezzo that has a pretty recharge 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:25.270
 slow the cadence is higher in the m 8 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:27.490
 at 150 bullets per minute is fine and 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:29.890
 of 720 for the in 27 that stays something 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:31.750
 short especially for short bouts and 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:34.330
 medium distances shooting mode 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.620
 slow eight one is a burst of 4 since 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.930
 automatic mode as with the 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.520
 updates have wished you have 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.830
 lowered a lot the damage is not worth it 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:44.080
 use the tomato game with this weapon to 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:46.020
 this weapon use the burst mode of 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:49.360
 four bullets is going to be the best option 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:51.460
 after the automatic 27th we can 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:54.070
 include the also the bursts mode is not 

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:55.480
 most advisable because the 27 is a 

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:56.770
 weapon that is provided to us some kind 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:00.280
 of advantage is that it is precisely a 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:02.080
 remarkable weapon in its automatic mode as well 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.750
 that summarizing these are all the data 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:07.290
 that we can have so far the 8 m to 1 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:10.530
 it is a weapon that will only go well 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:11.909
 to bursts bursts of 4 bullets so the 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.430
 advantages that it will provide us goes to 

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:17.940
 be mostly medium and long merga 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:19.410
 distances because it shortens the time that 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.000
 there is between burst and burst is going to 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.160
 prevent gain that advantage that maybe 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.440
 we would have won at the beginning in front of 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.639
 front melee and at m 8 a 1 is 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.620
 a fusion of jump that we will go 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:30.030
 better is going to be a little more polyvalent to 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.320
 short and medium distances will give us 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:33.120
 more opportunities when it comes to 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:35.610
 face off against the players already 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:38.310
 medium and long will cost a bit more 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:40.710
 adorer as opposed to m 8 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:42.599
 to 1 kills a bullet more than this first 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:44.970
 assault rifle while in short 

00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:46.860
 distances because it also kills a 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:49.050
 bullet more but it 's an automatic game on 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.910
 m 8 a 1 remember if we can do 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:52.889
 penetrate all the bullets the 4 in 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:54.840
 concrete in half distances we can 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:56.789
 ending the enemy is very difficult to 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:59.009
 has to have a very good connection like that 

00:04:56.789 --> 00:05:01.050
 that I would like you to leave in the 

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:02.400
 comments your opinions for 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:04.410
 determine in the following chapters 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.180
 let's go analyzing these little weapons to 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:08.460
 little to determine what assault rifle 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:09.840
 it's better so we say goodbye guys 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:12.710
 see you in the next video a 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.710
 goodbye greeting
