I don't own a Kinect because personally
I<00:03:15.840> think<00:03:16.080> it's<00:03:16.200> a<00:03:16.260> waste<00:03:16.410> of<00:03:16.620> time<00:03:16.680> money<00:03:17.519> when

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
I think it's a waste of time money when

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.430 
I think it's a waste of time money when
you<00:03:18.150> can<00:03:18.299> just<00:03:18.450> use<00:03:18.570> a<00:03:18.600> controller<00:03:19.170> or<00:03:19.290> a

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
you can just use a controller or a

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.080 
you can just use a controller or a
remote<00:03:19.860> to<00:03:20.100> get<00:03:20.250> to<00:03:20.400> exactly<00:03:20.640> where<00:03:20.910> you<00:03:21.060> need

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
remote to get to exactly where you need

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.000 
remote to get to exactly where you need
to<00:03:21.269> be<00:03:21.420> instead<00:03:21.750> of<00:03:21.840> trying<00:03:22.079> to<00:03:22.140> wave<00:03:22.829> your

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
to be instead of trying to wave your

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.410 
to be instead of trying to wave your
hand<00:03:23.250> across<00:03:23.489> the<00:03:23.610> screen<00:03:23.940> and<00:03:24.150> get<00:03:24.239> to<00:03:24.390> know
