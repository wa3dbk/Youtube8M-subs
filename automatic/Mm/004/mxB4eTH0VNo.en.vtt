00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:07.290
 my name is the from trabulsi and I am the 

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:09.570
 author of the ipad course for entrepreneurs 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.960
 because we can also call him already 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:17.400
 I have my ipad and now what 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:21.869
 in this first video of the series we are going to 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:24.540
 learn how to use our ipad more 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.430
 efficiently as we all know when 

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:28.660
 we open the ipad or take it out of the box 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.520
 does not bring any manual 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:37.300
 that's the first thing I want to teach you 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:40.360
 it's like using tips or how to use what 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:42.470
 the fingers or the full hand to 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.630
 better handle our art 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:47.180
 The first thing we have to do to 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:50.690
 make sure that what I 'm going to 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:52.980
 show here it works is to go to the menu 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.950
 of series that is down here 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:01:00.000
 within that ding it is understood that by 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:03.809
 usually appears selected us 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.550
 let's ensure that where it says we 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:09.300
 let's go up to work me says multi 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:11.420
 tasking esquius if the 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:15.409
 yes option 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:17.780
 if we pay it in the next series of 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:20.890
 tips is not going to work then we 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.870
 we have to ensure that it is learned 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.420
 and for now it 's all we have 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:29.110
 what to do we can return to the menu 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:32.240
 pressing the home button and returns to 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:34.610
 the main screen ok 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.950
 the first guy that I want to show you is 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.979
 for example right now we were in 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.650
 settings instead of using the button 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:45.380
 home which is the most common for 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.050
 to return to the main screen 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.780
 we can use 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:51.940
 the complete hand to the five fingers 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:55.000
 positioned on the screen and 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:58.450
 just do it like that and that we 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.159
 returns to the home screen does not matter in 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.969
 where are we 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:05.730
 and everything works with any application 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:09.150
 if we enter 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:10.979
 the app store and for some reason not 

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:12.989
 we wanted this 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.569
 we are wrong if we want to close 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:18.280
 we can do it again this 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:21.310
 movement and it comes back 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.900
 if then using the five fingers of the 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.310
 hand 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.830
 we can simply go back to the 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.840
 main screen obviously so 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.300
 also this 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.810
 we can also if we enter another 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:37.680
 application use the common instruction of 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.940
 double click 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:44.180
 dale click the 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:47.480
 to the home button and ready ok 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:50.819
 very well the next guy that I think 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:53.640
 that most of you can know is 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:57.780
 to switch between windows we can 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:03:01.379
 make a site with just one finger to 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:05.249
 there for over there we change 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:07.290
 there and we kissed the seeker who 

00:03:05.249 --> 00:03:09.829
 It is the first window 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:13.020
 but if we realize here below 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:16.230
 we also have a series of 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:17.640
 of indicators that not only 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.290
 they teach the screen on which we are 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.650
 selected tells us that we are in the 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:24.870
 3 in 4 and so on 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.420
 we can also change between 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.760
 screens 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.500
 using these little buttons and just 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.540
 we click here the one that follows 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:35.430
 click here 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:38.069
 is going to give yes yes 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:41.370
 then there is nothing more to adorn the 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:45.330
 little buttons here we can also use them 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:49.400
 to return them ok 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:52.819
 very good now when we have 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.329
 the ipad is said to be multitouch but 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:54.980
 real 

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:56.659
 that is, that means you can have 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:59.720
 many applications open to it 

00:03:56.659 --> 00:04:02.500
 time if we use the new click on the 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.500
 home button 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:07.000
 all the applications that are opened 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:10.270
 they are complete and open in that 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:13.830
 moment if we use the finger obviously we 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:16.470
 move each of them 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:17.880
 if we hit the home button again we 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:21.180
 came back 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:24.180
 another way to open the bar 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:27.530
 programs or multitasking is using 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:30.450
 four fingers and lifting the screen 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:32.100
 we just put four fingers here and 

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:34.830
 we make it up and the 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:39.040
 multi tasking bar 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:41.770
 yes and four fingers to close it 

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:44.350
 everything depends on how you feel 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:47.380
 more comfortable to open the screen 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:51.849
 obviously the home button serves 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:56.199
 for the same thing if we can close it like this 

00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:58.460
 ok now since we have all the 

00:04:56.199 --> 00:05:00.530
 open applications 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:02.200
 here below our bar and we can 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:05.020
 move 

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:06.590
 this does not mean that really the 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:09.520
 ipad be 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:13.100
 multitasking your multi are you simply 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:15.980
 when you close an application the 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:18.590
 position in this menu 

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:22.160
 so we can move easily between 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:27.280
 each time for example let's 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:27.280
 open this application that is erix 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:32.150
 if I want to move to the next 

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:34.400
 application that I have open without 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:36.620
 need to upload it and choose the one here 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:38.860
 down or with no need to go back to 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:38.860
 home 

00:05:40.429 --> 00:05:46.540
 just what I have to do is 

00:05:43.619 --> 00:05:49.840
 also using 

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:51.940
 the four fingers of the hand we can 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:54.249
 switch between open applications 

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:58.440
 for example so 

00:05:54.249 --> 00:06:02.250
 there is the one that follows the one that follows 

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:03.660
 the one that follows etcetera and so you can 

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:06.750
 you change between all 

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:09.689
 applications that need to be changed and 

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:11.289
 back yes 

00:06:09.689 --> 00:06:13.809
 okay 

00:06:11.289 --> 00:06:16.029
 then that is another one of the very tips 

00:06:13.809 --> 00:06:17.670
 interesting and here obviously we 

00:06:16.029 --> 00:06:20.450
 we can return 

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:20.450
 to the main screen
