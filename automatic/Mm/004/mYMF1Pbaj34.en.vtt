thoughts on Vince McMahon's approach

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:09.909 
thoughts on Vince McMahon's approach
because<00:04:08.660> he<00:04:08.780> always<00:04:08.930> seems<00:04:09.290> to<00:04:09.380> take<00:04:09.650> these

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:09.919 
because he always seems to take these

00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:13.270 
because he always seems to take these
things<00:04:10.280> so<00:04:10.880> personally<00:04:11.690> rather<00:04:12.590> than<00:04:12.859> kind<00:04:13.129> of

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 
things so personally rather than kind of

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:14.710 
things so personally rather than kind of
just<00:04:13.459> trying<00:04:13.700> to<00:04:13.819> work<00:04:14.030> with<00:04:14.269> people<00:04:14.299> he

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 
just trying to work with people he

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.539 
just trying to work with people he
always<00:04:14.959> seems<00:04:15.169> to<00:04:15.260> think<00:04:15.980> that<00:04:16.039> people<00:04:16.310> are

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 
always seems to think that people are

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:22.900 
always seems to think that people are
personally<00:04:17.000> attacking<00:04:17.359> him<00:04:18.910> well<00:04:21.789> you<00:04:22.789> know

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:22.910 
personally attacking him well you know

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:25.390 
personally attacking him well you know
what<00:04:23.120> I<00:04:23.300> don't<00:04:24.200> blame<00:04:24.349> him<00:04:24.560> and<00:04:24.740> I<00:04:24.800> almost<00:04:25.039> feel

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
what I don't blame him and I almost feel

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.719 
what I don't blame him and I almost feel
the<00:04:25.460> same<00:04:25.789> way<00:04:26.000> I<00:04:26.300> mean<00:04:26.750> Vince<00:04:27.530> McMahon<00:04:27.979> has

00:04:28.719 --> 00:04:28.729 
the same way I mean Vince McMahon has

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:31.870 
the same way I mean Vince McMahon has
made<00:04:29.630> wrestling<00:04:30.260> and<00:04:30.530> business<00:04:31.250> of<00:04:31.430> wrestling
