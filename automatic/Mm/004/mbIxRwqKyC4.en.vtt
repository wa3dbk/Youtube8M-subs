00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.120
 hello I am camila gÃ³mez and today I am going to 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.950
 present a tutorial through a 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.580
 simple case study of the application 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.859
 solver in excel 2011 for mac this 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:20.730
 application can be found here in 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.960
 tools complement and we give to 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.269
 to accept 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.989
 in this case and I already accepted this 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:30.720
 application because we go here where it says 

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:33.259
 data and we give you a click here 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.259
 solberg 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.010
 this exercise is about a company 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:41.610
 Valdivian who sells three products 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.920
 boots and umbrella brands have boots 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.739
 a price of 10 thousand pesos the marks of 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.470
 25 thousand pesos and 5 thousand 500 umbrellas 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.020
 pesos 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:54.440
 The objective of this company is to sell in 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:55.940
 the month of March a million pesos but 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.770
 it is not known how many units of each 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:01.640
 product has to be sold to achieve 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:04.360
 that goal as a first stage we are going to 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:11.290
 fill this box where it says units 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:13.930
 with any number 23 56 34 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:17.020
 and we are going to apply the formula that would be 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:19.920
 the price for the units that 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.920
 we need to sell 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.420
 and his mom 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:32.390
 if we do not use this application 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:34.040
 we can be long minutes trying to 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.290
 discover what will be 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.940
 the units that we are going to sell what 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.070
 interesting thing about the application is just that 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:44.409
 in a couple of seconds we can solve 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:46.990
 this exercise without much difficulty 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:49.710
 then we are going to save the units 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:54.030
 what we had put 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:58.140
 randomly without eliminating the formulas that 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.700
 it was price for the units because it 's what 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.330
 fundamental to be able to over this 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.900
 application and we go to each data 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:07.690
 solver 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:09.880
 we are going to solve this exercise 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:13.120
 we are going to establish our goal that 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:15.700
 would be here in total what will be the 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.580
 value that we are going to want to reach 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.250
 in the month of March in the sales of a 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.750
 million pesos 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:26.930
 and we register it 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:28.640
 what is our unit unknown? 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.990
 the part where it says is recorded 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.510
 changing the cells of variables 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:35.410
 and the reflections which are our 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.900
 restrictions 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.330
 it says that the units that are going to 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.070
 sell they have to be whole 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.810
 that is to say, half of 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.770
 an umbrella not a half to a grim 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:49.800
 half a pair of boots 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:53.040
 then we go here to the cells lines 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:55.370
 and we go to where it says inter and we give to 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.370
 to accept 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.770
 the same for the next 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.370
 in accept 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.880
 then reviewing we have our 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.100
 aim our value that we are going to 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:30.260
 arrive in the month of March a million 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:32.010
 weights the units and our 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.900
 restrictions 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.269
 ready is are able to 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:39.409
 solve our exercise and we give it 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:39.409
 click on solve 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:58.340
 in a couple of seconds we're going to have the 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:01.150
 result 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.150
 and I hope 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.510
 I found a solution of integers inside 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:38.700
 of tolerance and all the 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:40.360
 restrictions therefore we give to 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:42.729
 to accept 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:45.039
 and I want to say we have to sell 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:47.800
 three units of boots 26 units of 

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:50.220
 standing for marks forgiveness and 40 umbrellas 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:52.260
 in order to achieve our goal 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.840
 I hope that with this tutorial I have 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:58.320
 It became clear how to solve an exercise 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:05:00.330
 super simple to solve that is going to 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:04.340
 help optimize time and achieve 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:04.340
 enough benefits with this application
