do roughs then I send them to him and he

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.090 
do roughs then I send them to him and he
starts<00:01:48.270> working<00:01:48.450> on<00:01:48.689> dialogue<00:01:49.110> based<00:01:49.320> on<00:01:49.590> kind

and that sort of thing so that's on one

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.370 
and that sort of thing so that's on one
end<00:01:54.240> of<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.360> spectrum<00:01:54.509> where<00:01:55.020> it's<00:01:55.140> it's

might add a few more panels to kind of

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.360 
might add a few more panels to kind of
stretch<00:03:30.690> out<00:03:30.900> a<00:03:30.930> moment<00:03:31.170> or<00:03:31.500> they<00:03:31.950> might<00:03:32.100> take

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
stretch out a moment or they might take

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.250 
stretch out a moment or they might take
away<00:03:32.670> a<00:03:32.910> little<00:03:33.209> bit<00:03:33.299> to<00:03:33.540> make<00:03:33.840> the<00:03:33.959> moments

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
away a little bit to make the moments

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.520 
away a little bit to make the moments
happen<00:03:34.470> faster<00:03:34.950> or<00:03:35.130> bigger<00:03:35.459> moments<00:03:36.230> so<00:03:37.230> it

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
happen faster or bigger moments so it

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.789 
happen faster or bigger moments so it
really<00:03:37.709> depends<00:03:38.190> a<00:03:38.459> great<00:03:39.030> resource<00:03:39.330> to<00:03:39.810> to

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 
really depends a great resource to to

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:43.340 
really depends a great resource to to
look<00:03:40.950> that<00:03:41.100> sort<00:03:41.340> of<00:03:41.400> thing<00:03:41.670> up<00:03:42.090> in<00:03:42.269> what<00:03:43.260> of

way through to the full script so that

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.170 
way through to the full script so that
would<00:03:58.049> give<00:03:58.079> a<00:03:58.200> better<00:03:58.350> idea<00:03:58.560> so<00:03:59.120> Thank<00:04:00.120> You

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180
