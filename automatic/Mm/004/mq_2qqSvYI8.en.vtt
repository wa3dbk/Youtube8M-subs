00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 thick smoke rose experts 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.080
 assured people that this is not a smoke machine 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.849
 rainwater but calm the population it 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.559
 unlikely to help too many disturbing 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.780
 news comes from fukushima in 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.130
 Recently, a former director and a 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.130
 supervised by liquidation 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:20.340
 the accident died last week at 58 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.850
 around the plant grow plants mutants and 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.760
 roam 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.650
 our animals saw very strange animals 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.250
 correspondent Sergey Mingazhev he got close to 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.640
 Fukushima 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.920
 for the minimum allowable distance for 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.930
 more than two years after the accident, the border 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.030
 restricted areas approached in this place 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.680
 to the station for three and a half kilometers and 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.410
 and the pipes are now hidden by a dense veil 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.000
 mist territory in front of me declared 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.280
 livable japanese authorities 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.260
 but not a single living soul 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.180
 people are in no hurry to come back here 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.809
 here still lifeless desert 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.820
 overgrown with weeds everywhere 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:56.309
 foundation he crush their homes and radiation 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.289
 three times the norm by local standards it 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.780
 By the way a little coastal part of the village 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.910
 futaba north of aas from radiation 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.610
 suffered not so much but the consequences 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.740
 from the tsunami disastrous despite 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.020
 official ban on visiting 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.750
 in fact, this place remains the zone 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.150
 rift on this lifeless wasteland 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.950
 now and then there are such 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.390
 eloquent monuments of disaster like 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.400
 this is high school 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.979
 it was built just a year before 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.500
 the arrival of the tsunami during this time is nothing here 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:28.049
 did not change the clock shows 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.790
 when time stopped here in that 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.610
 someday she will go forward again 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.110
 now it is impossible to believe the only ones 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.329
 who we managed to meet here 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.610
 volunteers after hitting the tsunami they 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.320
 helped to find the dead away from 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.229
 the shores of the effects of the elements are wrong 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.240
 obvious most houses survived on 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:49.170
 the first time here is allowed to be 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:51.030
 for 7 hours a day, he almost did not 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.680
 only earthquakes affected by earthquakes 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.630
 need to correct of course I want 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.119
 come back as soon as possible but radiation 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.290
 say until high levels of radiation in 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.240
 areas where people are allowed 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.630
 come back everywhere different for example here 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.939
 it is 30 microsievert and 100 per hour 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.220
 seven times higher than normal 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.899
 a person receives one and a half monthly dose 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.660
 exposure as it affects health 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.280
 No details yet as 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.010
 greasy authorities in tokyo don't see the connection 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.260
 between radiation and death from cancer former 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.480
 station director weight at isis he 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:23.180
 manages work on the elimination of accidents 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.640
 and died on July 9th of this bunny here 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.350
 call the child fukushima he was born without 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.840
 ears in the village where the grass is rich 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.580
 whether the content of the goal is this form 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.650
 mutations result from overpriced 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.600
 radioactive background remains only 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.910
 guess at all the riot of nature 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.160
 hallmark of fukushima today 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.920
 such a crop was harvested in gardens and 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.140
 gardens in the vicinity of a cabbage 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.060
 sizes close to watermelon or pumpkin 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.160
 and as if eggplants crossed with 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.080
 banana rejoice this can 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.450
 that macaques that look with interest 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.580
 on people who did not appear here last 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:58.040
 two years after the fog cleared 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:00.230
 from the observation deck schools became visible 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.420
 Fukushima nuclear plant tubes 1 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.100
 work to eliminate the accident pass 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.590
 very slow radiation levels 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:09.050
 still deadly high at the same time 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:11.030
 continues and and ocean emissions one of 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:13.340
 latest alarm news from the station 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.140
 in the groundwater under ios was 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.690
 radioactive content detected 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.850
 cesium radiation test procedure 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.410
 pass all who visited the forbidden and 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:24.020
 adjacent to her zone 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:26.480
 we do not seem to have exceeded 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:29.060
 at least average excess 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.850
 in this area fukushima and he's here everywhere 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:34.720
 above normal sergey mingazhev alexey pichko 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:37.160
 keep Japan's Fukushima prefecture 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.620
 Prince William's firstborn and Kate Middleton 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.630
 even before his birth can disrupt 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.580
 leave great grandmother queen she 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:46.330
 unhappy in anticipation of the baby country 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.330
 greedily catches to
