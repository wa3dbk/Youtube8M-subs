00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:58.289 

yeah<00:03:56.019> you<00:03:56.410> see<00:03:56.620> if<00:03:56.769> you<00:03:56.980> if<00:03:57.280> you<00:03:57.940> just<00:03:57.970> do<00:03:58.269> a

00:03:58.289 --> 00:03:58.299 
yeah you see if you if you just do a

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:01.680 
yeah you see if you if you just do a
little<00:03:58.510> bit<00:03:58.810> of<00:03:58.840> a<00:03:59.340> tilt<00:04:00.340> it<00:04:00.700> really<00:04:01.239> affects

00:04:05.369 --> 00:04:05.379 
it which is ok but it kind of makes it a

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:08.369 
it which is ok but it kind of makes it a
little<00:04:05.530> boring<00:04:06.629> sometimes<00:04:07.629> it's<00:04:08.139> sometimes

00:04:08.369 --> 00:04:08.379 
little boring sometimes it's sometimes

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:10.199

00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:11.319 
going to just a little one will work

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:16.400

after this notes going to take a while
this<00:05:25.910> might<00:05:26.060> be<00:05:26.210> a<00:05:26.240> long<00:05:26.450> review<00:05:27.130> but<00:05:28.130> I<00:05:28.160> just

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:28.430 
this might be a long review but I just

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:32.350 
this might be a long review but I just
want<00:05:28.580> to<00:05:28.640> finish<00:05:28.760> one<00:05:29.060> race<00:05:29.300> and<00:05:31.180> you<00:05:32.180> can

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:32.360 
want to finish one race and you can

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:35.140 
want to finish one race and you can
catch<00:05:32.780> drips<00:05:33.169> off<00:05:33.350> of<00:05:33.530> the<00:05:33.710> back<00:05:34.070> of<00:05:34.250> people<00:05:34.520> to

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:35.150 
catch drips off of the back of people to

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:40.150 
catch drips off of the back of people to
go<00:05:35.180> faster<00:05:35.750> and<00:05:36.310> it's<00:05:37.310> fun<00:05:37.610> as<00:05:37.880> that<00:05:37.940> it<00:05:39.160> takes

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:40.160 
go faster and it's fun as that it takes

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.760 
go faster and it's fun as that it takes
a<00:05:40.280> while<00:05:40.400> to<00:05:40.580> catch<00:05:40.729> up<00:05:41.030> although<00:05:41.630> i<00:05:41.900> don't

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:42.770 
a while to catch up although i don't

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:45.659 
a while to catch up although i don't
know<00:05:43.010> i'm<00:05:43.100> using<00:05:43.130> like<00:05:43.550> the<00:05:43.729> second<00:05:44.120> worst<00:05:44.539> car

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:45.669 
know i'm using like the second worst car

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:50.200 
know i'm using like the second worst car
but<00:05:46.930> so<00:05:47.930> far<00:05:48.169> like<00:05:48.410> your<00:05:49.400> acceleration<00:05:49.940> is

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:50.210 
but so far like your acceleration is

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:52.029 
but so far like your acceleration is
really<00:05:50.539> crappy<00:05:50.780> your<00:05:51.020> speed<00:05:51.289> is<00:05:51.320> crappy<00:05:51.860> and

00:05:52.029 --> 00:05:52.039 
really crappy your speed is crappy and

00:05:52.039 --> 00:05:53.770 
really crappy your speed is crappy and
everything<00:05:52.520> but<00:05:53.030> hopefully<00:05:53.180> i'll<00:05:53.510> get<00:05:53.600> some

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:53.780 
everything but hopefully i'll get some

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:55.360 
everything but hopefully i'll get some
new<00:05:53.900> cars<00:05:54.169> and<00:05:54.380> locks<00:05:54.530> make<00:05:54.770> this<00:05:54.860> game<00:05:55.039> fun<00:05:55.340> i

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:55.370 
new cars and locks make this game fun i

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:56.950 
new cars and locks make this game fun i
really<00:05:55.820> wish<00:05:55.970> they<00:05:56.150> would<00:05:56.270> start<00:05:56.570> with<00:05:56.630> better

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:56.960 
really wish they would start with better

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:00.730 
really wish they would start with better
cards<00:05:57.530> you<00:05:58.250> get<00:05:58.460> bored<00:05:58.850> and<00:05:59.030> really<00:05:59.300> fast<00:05:59.740> and

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:00.740 
cards you get bored and really fast and

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:04.680 
cards you get bored and really fast and
as<00:06:01.070> you<00:06:01.190> can<00:06:01.340> see<00:06:01.370> it's<00:06:02.060> really<00:06:02.450> repetitive<00:06:03.669> as

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:04.690 
as you can see it's really repetitive as

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:09.850 
as you can see it's really repetitive as
really<00:06:05.690> good<00:06:05.840> graphics<00:06:06.350> though<00:06:06.650> I<00:06:08.860> definitely

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:09.860 
really good graphics though I definitely

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:12.730 
really good graphics though I definitely
like<00:06:10.070> this<00:06:10.280> this<00:06:11.150> is<00:06:11.450> a<00:06:11.479> tie<00:06:11.930> with<00:06:12.140> fast<00:06:12.440> lane

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:12.740 
like this this is a tie with fast lane

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:14.680 
like this this is a tie with fast lane
if<00:06:12.919> you<00:06:13.010> ever<00:06:13.070> tried<00:06:13.430> that<00:06:13.610> up<00:06:13.820> I<00:06:14.060> think<00:06:14.510> it's

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:14.690 
if you ever tried that up I think it's

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:16.659 
if you ever tried that up I think it's
about<00:06:14.870> a<00:06:14.930> tie<00:06:15.229> with<00:06:15.470> that<00:06:15.650> or<00:06:16.130> a<00:06:16.190> fast<00:06:16.460> night

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:16.669 
about a tie with that or a fast night

00:06:16.669 --> 00:06:19.270 
about a tie with that or a fast night
has<00:06:16.850> better<00:06:17.090> music<00:06:17.419> and<00:06:17.720> it's<00:06:18.440> like<00:06:18.650> seven

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:19.280 
has better music and it's like seven

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:21.130 
has better music and it's like seven
times<00:06:19.490> cheaper<00:06:19.880> so<00:06:20.240> I<00:06:20.270> suggest<00:06:20.900> you<00:06:20.960> put

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:21.140 
times cheaper so I suggest you put

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:23.020 
times cheaper so I suggest you put
download<00:06:21.470> that<00:06:21.620> app<00:06:21.830> instead<00:06:22.220> but<00:06:22.910> if<00:06:22.970> you

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:23.030 
download that app instead but if you

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:25.330 
download that app instead but if you
want<00:06:23.210> this<00:06:23.390> one<00:06:23.630> if<00:06:24.200> a<00:06:24.320> real<00:06:24.560> race<00:06:24.770> phonetic
