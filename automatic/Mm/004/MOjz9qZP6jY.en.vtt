second<00:02:20.430> down<00:02:20.519> and<00:02:20.700> ten

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.180 

putting<00:02:30.750> on<00:02:30.810> the<00:02:30.930> rush<00:02:31.140> for<00:02:31.379> the<00:02:31.470> Baltimore

so that's third down to ten twenty three

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:49.670 
so that's third down to ten twenty three
seconds<00:02:39.230> remaining<00:02:39.470> in<00:02:39.680> the<00:02:39.740> game

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.070 

now<00:02:50.680> let's<00:02:50.980> see<00:02:51.070> if<00:02:51.160> that<00:02:51.190> translates<00:02:51.850> into

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
now let's see if that translates into

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:58.260 
now let's see if that translates into

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:23.800 
right and if and if I were JP Wilson

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.620 
right and if and if I were JP Wilson
I<00:03:23.830> wouldn't<00:03:24.460> think<00:03:24.550> about<00:03:24.700> anything<00:03:25.270> short

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
I wouldn't think about anything short

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:27.180 
I wouldn't think about anything short
unless<00:03:25.810> it's<00:03:26.020> just<00:03:26.170> a<00:03:26.230> five<00:03:26.470> yard<00:03:26.680> out<00:03:26.950> and<00:03:27.100> get

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
unless it's just a five yard out and get

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.490 
unless it's just a five yard out and get
the<00:03:27.280> inside<00:03:27.580> line<00:03:27.850> I've<00:03:28.540> got<00:03:29.020> to<00:03:29.170> push<00:03:29.350> this

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
the inside line I've got to push this

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:36.050 
the inside line I've got to push this
thing<00:03:29.710> to<00:03:29.830> the<00:03:29.920> end<00:03:30.070> zone

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.900 

jump<00:03:37.060> up<00:03:37.210> and<00:03:37.360> make<00:03:37.870> that<00:03:38.080> grab<00:03:38.430> so<00:03:39.430> incomplete

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
jump up and make that grab so incomplete

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.060 
jump up and make that grab so incomplete
with<00:03:40.180> two<00:03:40.450> seconds<00:03:40.930> left<00:03:41.020> in<00:03:41.320> the<00:03:41.380> game<00:03:41.410> one

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:42.070 
with two seconds left in the game one

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:48.170 
with two seconds left in the game one
more<00:03:42.100> shot<00:03:42.580> at<00:03:42.820> it<00:03:42.970> in<00:03:43.570> the<00:03:44.080> for<00:03:44.320> drive<00:03:44.680> zone

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.899 

last<00:03:48.780> chance<00:03:49.140> for<00:03:49.319> JP<00:03:49.829> Wilson<00:03:50.310> and<00:03:50.670> the

00:03:50.899 --> 00:03:50.909 
last chance for JP Wilson and the

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:53.270 
last chance for JP Wilson and the
Atlanta<00:03:51.329> Falcons<00:03:51.560> here<00:03:52.560> in<00:03:52.709> this<00:03:52.799> preseason

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
Atlanta Falcons here in this preseason

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:59.420 
Atlanta Falcons here in this preseason
conference

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.850 

so<00:04:00.000> this<00:04:00.180> would<00:04:00.360> be<00:04:00.450> it<00:04:00.599> two<00:04:01.200> seconds<00:04:01.620> remain

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860 
so this would be it two seconds remain

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:04.220 
so this would be it two seconds remain
in<00:04:02.010> the<00:04:02.069> game<00:04:02.599> all<00:04:03.599> right<00:04:03.780> Vince<00:04:03.989> make<00:04:04.200> a

in the game all right Vince make a
prediction<00:04:04.560> where<00:04:04.860> does<00:04:04.950> the<00:04:05.040> ball<00:04:05.220> go<00:04:05.459> here

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
prediction where does the ball go here

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.729 
prediction where does the ball go here
who<00:04:06.360> do<00:04:06.420> you<00:04:06.540> throw<00:04:06.750> it<00:04:06.870> to<00:04:07.049> he's<00:04:07.349> gonna<00:04:07.470> go<00:04:07.680> to

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:07.739 
who do you throw it to he's gonna go to

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:09.530 
who do you throw it to he's gonna go to
Mayer<00:04:08.040> okay<00:04:08.849> I'm<00:04:08.970> gonna<00:04:09.090> say<00:04:09.239> he<00:04:09.299> goes<00:04:09.420> to

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
Mayer okay I'm gonna say he goes to

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:21.500 
Mayer okay I'm gonna say he goes to
Brandon<00:04:09.900> Harvey

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.810 

but<00:04:22.510> it's<00:04:22.660> broken<00:04:23.169> up<00:04:23.470> and<00:04:23.740> that's<00:04:24.100> we<00:04:24.610> wanted

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
but it's broken up and that's we wanted

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:30.500 
but it's broken up and that's we wanted
to<00:04:24.880> be<00:04:24.970> the<00:04:25.060> ball<00:04:25.240> game<00:04:25.480> we<00:04:25.630> were<00:04:25.720> both<00:04:25.900> right

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:34.370
