 Inputs were made short 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.840
 activity of the button and the 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.819
 Switching times are programmed for the 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.290
 Fourth day 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:03:00.180

 and press the joystick upwards 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:31.139
 and already the programming will be 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:33.660
 Lecture taken over next day sees 

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:35.480
 like the switching times from the day before 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:38.370
 be taken 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.870
 short confirmation of the button come out 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:43.200
 the copy mode out and again 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:47.220
 Activity is back in the ad 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:49.829
 mode only 12 51 the possibility about 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.480
 a hand-mode one that does not permanently 

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:54.180
 or permanently off 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:56.150
 For this one operates disappointed me about 2 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:59.370
 seconds up 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:02.940
 the six people indicated that 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:05.970
 Hans SÃ¼nkel flashes the symbol flashes and 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:08.099
 The contact is closed and thus 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:11.160
 the consumer illuminates the lighting 

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:14.400
 for example, a permanent table 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:17.070
 Reset the joystick to get in 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:20.099
 the basic setting and again I there 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:22.460
 Pressing down two seconds can 

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:24.530
 the lighting is permanently off 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:29.690
 that means you can do it manually 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:32.090
 the lighting will turn one off 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:34.190
 the joystick for about a minute long 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:36.289
 not pressed so the clock turns off 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:38.960

 Backlight will be off to 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:43.490
 Maintaining the programming 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:46.220
 date and time is one
