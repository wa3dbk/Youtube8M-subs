00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
was ready to slip tight that's one then

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.600 
was ready to slip tight that's one then
I'm<00:00:42.000> ready<00:00:42.270> to<00:00:42.510> get<00:00:42.690> started<00:00:43.020> with<00:00:43.530> my<00:00:43.920> curling

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
I'm ready to get started with my curling

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.520 
I'm ready to get started with my curling
process<00:00:45.120> so<00:00:45.420> as<00:00:45.450> you<00:00:45.629> can<00:00:45.750> see<00:00:45.960> i<00:00:46.170> split<00:00:46.500> my

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
process so as you can see i split my

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.860 
process so as you can see i split my
hair<00:00:46.920> in<00:00:47.250> two<00:00:47.579> parts<00:00:48.030> I<00:00:48.210> don't<00:00:48.750> really

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
hair in two parts I don't really

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.470 
hair in two parts I don't really
separate<00:00:49.410> it<00:00:49.649> any<00:00:50.070> other<00:00:50.309> way<00:00:50.520> I<00:00:50.910> just<00:00:51.239> think

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
separate it any other way I just think

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.779 
separate it any other way I just think
this<00:00:51.719> is<00:00:51.780> easier<00:00:52.320> this<00:00:52.559> way<00:00:52.829> so<00:00:53.489> I<00:00:53.520> take<00:00:53.730> a

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
this is easier this way so I take a

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.760 
this is easier this way so I take a
piece<00:00:54.030> of<00:00:54.059> hair<00:00:54.420> that's<00:00:54.780> not<00:00:55.020> too<00:00:55.289> thick<00:00:55.590> or

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
piece of hair that's not too thick or

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.819 
piece of hair that's not too thick or
too<00:00:55.860> thin<00:00:56.190> and<00:00:56.879> then<00:00:57.480> I'm<00:00:57.809> start<00:00:58.260> counting<00:00:58.649> it

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
too thin and then I'm start counting it

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.950 
too thin and then I'm start counting it
from<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.609> top<00:00:59.789> to<00:00:59.850> the<00:01:00.120> bottom<00:01:00.210> as<00:01:00.690> you<00:01:00.870> can

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
from the top to the bottom as you can

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.830 
from the top to the bottom as you can
see<00:01:01.289> i<00:01:01.440> do<00:01:01.530> it<00:01:01.859> in<00:01:02.070> two<00:01:02.399> steps<00:01:02.670> i<00:01:02.969> start<00:01:03.420> at<00:01:03.629> the

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
see i do it in two steps i start at the

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.649 
see i do it in two steps i start at the
top<00:01:04.049> hey<00:01:04.650> leave<00:01:04.799> it<00:01:04.920> for<00:01:05.159> three<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.360> five

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
top hey leave it for three to five

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.200 
top hey leave it for three to five
seconds<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:07.439> then<00:01:07.650> I<00:01:07.890> routine<00:01:08.580> end<00:01:08.850> of<00:01:09.090> the

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
seconds and then I routine end of the

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.570 
seconds and then I routine end of the
hair<00:01:09.420> where<00:01:10.170> I<00:01:10.200> leave<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.530> curling<00:01:10.890> iron<00:01:10.920> for

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
hair where I leave the curling iron for

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.850 
hair where I leave the curling iron for
something<00:01:12.030> between<00:01:12.240> five<00:01:12.869> to<00:01:12.900> ten<00:01:13.290> seconds

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:16.490 
from the back to in front and I move to

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:18.940
