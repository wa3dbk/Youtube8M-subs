next we're going to learn how to take
the<00:00:01.949> musical<00:00:02.580> alphabet<00:00:02.820> and<00:00:03.360> apply<00:00:03.810> it<00:00:03.870> to

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.290 
the musical alphabet and apply it to

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.680 
the musical alphabet and apply it to
this<00:00:04.470> instrument<00:00:05.250> so<00:00:05.940> as<00:00:06.150> you<00:00:06.359> know<00:00:06.509> the

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
this instrument so as you know the

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.919 
this instrument so as you know the
musical<00:00:07.109> alphabet<00:00:07.230> starts<00:00:07.890> at<00:00:08.040> a<00:00:08.189> and<00:00:08.639> goes<00:00:09.420> up

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
musical alphabet starts at a and goes up

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:15.760 
musical alphabet starts at a and goes up
to<00:00:10.590> G<00:00:10.889> and<00:00:11.190> after<00:00:12.179> G<00:00:12.509> we<00:00:12.809> just<00:00:12.990> go<00:00:13.110> back<00:00:13.259> to<00:00:13.590> a

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:15.770 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:20.510 

abcdefg<00:00:16.770> abcdefg<00:00:17.990> and<00:00:18.990> so<00:00:19.439> on<00:00:19.680> just<00:00:20.369> to

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
abcdefg abcdefg and so on just to

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.160 
abcdefg abcdefg and so on just to
practice<00:00:21.000> the<00:00:21.150> musical<00:00:21.570> alphabet<00:00:21.720> on<00:00:22.050> the

practice the musical alphabet on the
keyboard<00:00:22.619> we're<00:00:22.949> gonna<00:00:23.070> start<00:00:23.430> with<00:00:23.550> the

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
keyboard we're gonna start with the

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.000 
keyboard we're gonna start with the
letter<00:00:23.910> C<00:00:24.000> and<00:00:24.660> I<00:00:25.170> want<00:00:25.350> to<00:00:25.410> show<00:00:25.619> you<00:00:25.680> how<00:00:25.980> to

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
letter C and I want to show you how to

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.820 
letter C and I want to show you how to
find<00:00:26.400> C<00:00:26.849> anywhere<00:00:27.570> on<00:00:27.779> the<00:00:27.960> entire<00:00:27.990> instrument

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
find C anywhere on the entire instrument

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.490 
find C anywhere on the entire instrument
so<00:00:29.609> again<00:00:29.939> start<00:00:30.420> by<00:00:30.480> looking<00:00:30.929> at<00:00:31.080> your<00:00:31.230> groups

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
so again start by looking at your groups

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.229 
so again start by looking at your groups
of<00:00:31.679> 3<00:00:32.070> 2<00:00:32.489> 3<00:00:32.880> 2<00:00:33.260> 3<00:00:34.260> and<00:00:34.500> then<00:00:34.980> find<00:00:35.399> a<00:00:35.550> group<00:00:35.790> of<00:00:35.940> 2

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
of 3 2 3 2 3 and then find a group of 2

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.280 
of 3 2 3 2 3 and then find a group of 2
with<00:00:37.140> this<00:00:37.440> group<00:00:37.680> of<00:00:37.860> to<00:00:38.270> find<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.570> note<00:00:39.809> that

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
with this group of to find the note that

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.790 
with this group of to find the note that
comes<00:00:40.649> right<00:00:41.010> before<00:00:41.399> it<00:00:42.000> down<00:00:42.660> below<00:00:43.020> the

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
comes right before it down below the

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.880 
comes right before it down below the
note<00:00:44.129> right<00:00:44.640> before<00:00:45.270> every<00:00:45.570> group<00:00:46.140> of<00:00:46.320> 2<00:00:46.590> is

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
note right before every group of 2 is

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.020 
note right before every group of 2 is
the<00:00:47.370> letter<00:00:47.579> C<00:00:48.120> so<00:00:48.469> here's<00:00:49.469> one<00:00:49.920> C<00:00:50.430> and<00:00:50.730> then

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
the letter C so here's one C and then

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.060 
the letter C so here's one C and then
you<00:00:51.149> can<00:00:51.329> go<00:00:51.600> up<00:00:51.960> here's<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.440> other<00:00:52.620> group<00:00:52.920> of

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
you can go up here's the other group of

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.900 
you can go up here's the other group of
2<00:00:53.370> so<00:00:54.149> right<00:00:54.719> before<00:00:54.989> it<00:00:55.500> and<00:00:55.680> below<00:00:56.219> it<00:00:56.250> is<00:00:56.550> the

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
2 so right before it and below it is the

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.779 
2 so right before it and below it is the
