00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.370 
what do I mean by incredible for the
hummingbird<00:02:05.280> it<00:02:05.490> means<00:02:05.850> visiting<00:02:06.420> one<00:02:06.719> to<00:02:07.079> two

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
hummingbird it means visiting one to two

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.639 
hummingbird it means visiting one to two
thousand<00:02:08.039> blossoms<00:02:08.640> a<00:02:08.819> day<00:02:09.060> in<00:02:09.539> which<00:02:10.410> they

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
thousand blossoms a day in which they

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.490 
thousand blossoms a day in which they
take<00:02:10.860> in<00:02:11.099> double<00:02:11.580> their<00:02:11.760> weight<00:02:11.970> in<00:02:12.239> nectar

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
take in double their weight in nectar

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.590 
take in double their weight in nectar
and<00:02:13.590> that's<00:02:14.220> why<00:02:14.460> feeders<00:02:14.940> can<00:02:15.210> be<00:02:15.360> so

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
and that's why feeders can be so

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.250 
and that's why feeders can be so
effective<00:02:16.640> one<00:02:17.640> feeder<00:02:17.970> is<00:02:18.270> like<00:02:18.690> having<00:02:19.020> a

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
effective one feeder is like having a

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.230 
effective one feeder is like having a
yard<00:02:19.500> full<00:02:19.920> of<00:02:20.070> flowers<00:02:20.490> as<00:02:20.670> far<00:02:20.940> as<00:02:21.090> the

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
yard full of flowers as far as the

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.750 
yard full of flowers as far as the
hummingbird<00:02:21.690> is<00:02:21.870> concerned<00:02:22.290> so<00:02:23.130> if<00:02:23.340> you<00:02:23.520> have

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
hummingbird is concerned so if you have

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.000 
hummingbird is concerned so if you have
one<00:02:24.420> feeder<00:02:24.780> or<00:02:25.020> you<00:02:25.170> have<00:02:25.380> a<00:02:25.410> half<00:02:25.770> a<00:02:25.860> dozen

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
one feeder or you have a half a dozen

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.230 
one feeder or you have a half a dozen
feeders<00:02:26.520> how<00:02:27.330> should<00:02:27.960> we<00:02:28.430> place<00:02:29.430> that<00:02:29.460> in<00:02:30.090> our

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
feeders how should we place that in our

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.180 
feeders how should we place that in our
yard<00:02:30.540> for<00:02:30.930> them<00:02:31.050> to<00:02:31.230> be<00:02:31.380> most<00:02:31.560> effective<00:02:31.860> for

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
yard for them to be most effective for

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.150 
yard for them to be most effective for
the<00:02:32.280> hummingbird<00:02:32.700> well<00:02:33.690> I<00:02:34.200> think<00:02:34.500> the<00:02:34.890> first

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
the hummingbird well I think the first

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.010 
the hummingbird well I think the first
consideration<00:02:35.940> is<00:02:36.150> that<00:02:36.209> most<00:02:36.600> feeders

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
consideration is that most feeders

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.050 
consideration is that most feeders
should<00:02:37.530> be<00:02:37.650> positioned<00:02:37.860> where<00:02:38.400> you<00:02:38.610> can<00:02:38.820> see

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
should be positioned where you can see

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.000 
should be positioned where you can see
them<00:02:39.270> that's<00:02:39.870> part<00:02:40.170> of<00:02:40.320> the<00:02:40.440> joy<00:02:40.620> of<00:02:40.650> eating

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
them that's part of the joy of eating

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.660 
them that's part of the joy of eating

hummingbird absolutely deters feeder

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.460 
hummingbird absolutely deters feeder

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
should always be placed out of the reach

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.740 
should always be placed out of the reach
of<00:02:46.500> cats<00:02:46.950> if<00:02:47.280> there<00:02:47.489> are<00:02:47.610> any<00:02:47.940> in<00:02:48.150> your<00:02:48.360> area
