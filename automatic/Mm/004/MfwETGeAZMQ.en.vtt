picky<00:00:15.150> with<00:00:15.660> the<00:00:16.260> ones<00:00:16.470> that<00:00:16.770> I<00:00:16.800> use<00:00:17.190> and<00:00:17.550> the

there are quite a few mascaras on the
market<00:00:21.720> that<00:00:21.810> I<00:00:21.869> think<00:00:22.140> can<00:00:22.289> build<00:00:22.560> up<00:00:22.830> length

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
market that I think can build up length

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.910 
if they can't hold the curl of my lashes
I<00:00:29.820> won't<00:00:30.179> really<00:00:30.570> look<00:00:30.929> like<00:00:30.990> I<00:00:31.260> have<00:00:31.590> lashes

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
a profile and then you see some lash but

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.150 
a profile and then you see some lash but
head<00:00:36.329> on<00:00:36.540> if<00:00:36.960> they're<00:00:37.170> not<00:00:37.410> holding<00:00:37.680> a<00:00:37.920> curl

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
head on if they're not holding a curl

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.950 
head on if they're not holding a curl
it's<00:00:38.460> like<00:00:38.700> they're<00:00:38.879> not<00:00:38.910> there's<00:00:39.360> a<00:00:39.600> few<00:00:39.809> who

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
it's like they're not there's a few who

it's like they're not there's a few who
have<00:00:40.140> really<00:00:40.500> straight<00:00:40.800> or<00:00:40.980> downward

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
have really straight or downward

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.610 
have really straight or downward
pointing<00:00:41.610> lashes<00:00:42.270> like<00:00:42.480> me<00:00:42.690> you<00:00:43.079> feel<00:00:43.290> me<00:00:43.350> on

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
pointing lashes like me you feel me on

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.319 
pointing lashes like me you feel me on
that<00:00:43.890> you<00:00:43.920> need<00:00:44.219> something<00:00:44.610> that's<00:00:44.879> going<00:00:45.239> to

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
that you need something that's going to

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.810 
that you need something that's going to
lift<00:00:45.629> them<00:00:45.809> up<00:00:45.930> so<00:00:46.140> I<00:00:46.170> found<00:00:46.500> a<00:00:46.620> mascara<00:00:47.100> that<00:00:47.280> I

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
lift them up so I found a mascara that I

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.600 
lift them up so I found a mascara that I
think<00:00:48.210> really<00:00:48.840> builds<00:00:49.170> up<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.590> lashes<00:00:50.070> nicely

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
think really builds up the lashes nicely

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.420 
think really builds up the lashes nicely
like<00:00:50.910> piles<00:00:51.480> on<00:00:51.930> some<00:00:52.260> product<00:00:52.800> but<00:00:53.039> does<00:00:53.250> it

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
like piles on some product but does it

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.549 
like piles on some product but does it
in<00:00:53.460> a<00:00:53.640> way<00:00:53.670> that<00:00:54.300> actually<00:00:54.480> makes<00:00:55.020> me<00:00:55.170> look

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
in a way that actually makes me look

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.069 
in a way that actually makes me look
like<00:00:55.680> I<00:00:55.739> have<00:00:56.010> more<00:00:56.250> eyelashes<00:00:57.000> but<00:00:57.539> also<00:00:57.960> it

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
like I have more eyelashes but also it

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.170 
like I have more eyelashes but also it
does<00:00:58.230> a<00:00:58.260> decent<00:00:58.620> job<00:00:59.039> of<00:00:59.100> holding<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.699> curl<00:00:59.910> if

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
does a decent job of holding the curl if

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.060 
does a decent job of holding the curl if
I<00:01:00.239> even<00:01:00.510> said<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.870> name<00:01:01.079> of<00:01:01.260> this<00:01:01.440> yet<00:01:01.680> it's

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
I even said the name of this yet it's

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.070 
I even said the name of this yet it's
the<00:01:02.250> super<00:01:02.640> sizer<00:01:02.910> from<00:01:03.359> covergirl<00:01:03.719> it's

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
different about this that is kind of

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.770 
different about this that is kind of
unlike<00:01:08.369> my<00:01:08.610> experience<00:01:09.180> with<00:01:09.330> a<00:01:09.360> lot<00:01:09.540> of<00:01:09.659> other

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
unlike my experience with a lot of other

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.929 
unlike my experience with a lot of other
mascaras<00:01:10.500> is<00:01:10.650> that<00:01:10.799> I<00:01:10.950> liked<00:01:11.280> it<00:01:11.460> right<00:01:11.760> off

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
mascaras is that I liked it right off

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.179 
mascaras is that I liked it right off
the<00:01:11.970> bat<00:01:12.330> it's<00:01:12.720> got<00:01:13.049> some<00:01:13.470> bristles<00:01:13.920> that<00:01:14.070> are

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
the bat it's got some bristles that are

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.249 
the bat it's got some bristles that are
actually<00:01:14.610> a<00:01:14.640> little<00:01:14.880> longer<00:01:15.299> toward<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:15.990> tip

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
actually a little longer toward the tip

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.060 
actually a little longer toward the tip
and<00:01:16.560> shorter<00:01:17.549> toward<00:01:18.240> like<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.259> handle<00:01:19.770> it's

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
and shorter toward like the handle it's

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.969 
and shorter toward like the handle it's
really<00:01:20.490> kind<00:01:20.790> of<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.150> reverse<00:01:21.420> of<00:01:22.200> what<00:01:22.290> I<00:01:22.619> see

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
really kind of the reverse of what I see

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.740 
really kind of the reverse of what I see
on<00:01:23.130> a<00:01:23.159> lot<00:01:23.400> of<00:01:23.549> mascara<00:01:24.030> one<00:01:24.299> and<00:01:24.509> I'm<00:01:24.570> not

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
on a lot of mascara one and I'm not

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.719 
on a lot of mascara one and I'm not
saying<00:01:25.020> this<00:01:25.229> new<00:01:25.500> style<00:01:25.890> is<00:01:26.100> like<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.460> key<00:01:26.700> to

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
saying this new style is like the key to

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.240 
saying this new style is like the key to
this<00:01:26.970> mascaras<00:01:27.659> success<00:01:28.259> for<00:01:28.740> me<00:01:28.860> but

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
this mascaras success for me but

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.520 
this mascaras success for me but
whatever<00:01:30.090> in<00:01:30.420> case<00:01:30.570> maybe<00:01:30.780> it's<00:01:31.079> working

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
whatever in case maybe it's working

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.620 
whatever in case maybe it's working
even<00:01:31.860> with<00:01:32.009> those<00:01:32.220> longer<00:01:32.759> bristles<00:01:33.210> being<00:01:33.479> at

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
even with those longer bristles being at

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.050 
even with those longer bristles being at
the<00:01:33.750> tip<00:01:33.990> they're<00:01:34.320> not<00:01:34.590> crazy<00:01:35.159> long<00:01:35.549> you<00:01:35.880> know

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
the tip they're not crazy long you know

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.300 
the tip they're not crazy long you know
so<00:01:36.450> it's<00:01:36.720> all<00:01:36.930> still<00:01:37.320> relatively<00:01:37.979> short

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
so it's all still relatively short

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.310 
so it's all still relatively short
bristles<00:01:39.240> but<00:01:39.360> what's<00:01:39.570> really<00:01:39.689> notable<00:01:40.229> about

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
bristles but what's really notable about

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.450 
bristles but what's really notable about
this<00:01:40.650> brush<00:01:41.070> is<00:01:41.400> that<00:01:42.119> on<00:01:42.530> two<00:01:43.530> sides<00:01:43.920> of<00:01:44.310> it

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
this brush is that on two sides of it

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.789 
this brush is that on two sides of it
it's<00:01:44.729> basically<00:01:45.600> flat<00:01:46.020> what<00:01:46.320> you're<00:01:46.409> supposed

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
it's basically flat what you're supposed

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.429 
it's basically flat what you're supposed
to<00:01:46.890> do<00:01:47.189> is<00:01:47.430> use<00:01:47.700> that<00:01:47.729> flat<00:01:48.360> side<00:01:48.689> at<00:01:48.990> first

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
to do is use that flat side at first

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.319 
to do is use that flat side at first
kind<00:01:49.770> of<00:01:49.829> at<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.040> base<00:01:50.280> of<00:01:50.490> your<00:01:50.579> lash<00:01:50.939> to

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
kind of at the base of your lash to

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.330 
kind of at the base of your lash to
start<00:01:51.659> really<00:01:52.170> getting<00:01:52.259> some<00:01:52.619> product<00:01:53.130> on

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
start really getting some product on

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.490 
start really getting some product on
there<00:01:53.640> and<00:01:53.880> then<00:01:54.210> you<00:01:54.299> can<00:01:54.479> turn<00:01:54.689> the<00:01:54.750> wand<00:01:55.110> and

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
there and then you can turn the wand and

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.160 
there and then you can turn the wand and
use<00:01:55.920> you<00:01:56.490> know<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:56.850> more<00:01:57.030> spiky<00:01:57.509> parts<00:01:57.840> of<00:01:58.049> it

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
use you know the more spiky parts of it

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.679 
use you know the more spiky parts of it
to<00:01:58.350> comb<00:01:58.619> it<00:01:58.649> on<00:01:58.920> through<00:01:59.340> and<00:01:59.700> I<00:02:00.090> think<00:02:00.479> that's

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
to comb it on through and I think that's

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.620 
to comb it on through and I think that's
a<00:02:00.869> really<00:02:01.170> smart<00:02:01.560> design<00:02:02.009> and<00:02:02.390> with<00:02:03.390> this

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
a really smart design and with this

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.080 
a really smart design and with this
particular<00:02:04.170> formula<00:02:04.740> it's<00:02:04.979> really<00:02:05.670> working

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
particular formula it's really working

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.760 
particular formula it's really working
for<00:02:06.299> me<00:02:06.570> because<00:02:06.869> I<00:02:06.960> think<00:02:07.020> if<00:02:07.229> this<00:02:07.409> was<00:02:07.590> a

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
for me because I think if this was a

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.470 
for me because I think if this was a
more<00:02:08.220> wet<00:02:08.789> heavy<00:02:09.539> really<00:02:10.470> goopy

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
more wet heavy really goopy

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.809 
more wet heavy really goopy
liquidy<00:02:11.989> type<00:02:12.349> formula<00:02:13.040> it<00:02:13.340> would<00:02:13.519> lay<00:02:13.760> too

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
liquidy type formula it would lay too

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:15.880 
liquidy type formula it would lay too
much<00:02:14.239> on<00:02:14.510> and<00:02:14.840> I<00:02:14.930> think<00:02:14.989> I<00:02:15.260> would<00:02:15.440> still<00:02:15.709> have

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
much on and I think I would still have

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.280 
much on and I think I would still have
problems<00:02:16.190> with<00:02:16.909> getting<00:02:17.120> definition<00:02:17.989> but<00:02:18.260> I

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
problems with getting definition but I

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:19.839 
problems with getting definition but I
think<00:02:18.530> because<00:02:18.769> of<00:02:18.799> the<00:02:19.129> thick<00:02:19.489> kind<00:02:19.760> of

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:19.849 
think because of the thick kind of

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:21.970 
think because of the thick kind of
creamy<00:02:20.180> consistency<00:02:21.080> of<00:02:21.110> this<00:02:21.319> mascara

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
creamy consistency of this mascara

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.920 
creamy consistency of this mascara
that's<00:02:22.250> the<00:02:22.549> kind<00:02:22.760> of<00:02:22.849> mascara<00:02:23.420> that's<00:02:23.629> going

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
that's the kind of mascara that's going

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.470 
that's the kind of mascara that's going
to<00:02:24.110> build<00:02:24.379> on<00:02:24.650> itself<00:02:25.159> really<00:02:25.640> nicely<00:02:25.849> because

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
to build on itself really nicely because

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.449 
to build on itself really nicely because
I<00:02:26.690> show<00:02:26.870> this<00:02:27.049> demo<00:02:27.440> I<00:02:27.470> hope<00:02:27.830> the<00:02:28.010> eyeshadow

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
I show this demo I hope the eyeshadow

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:31.420 
I show this demo I hope the eyeshadow
look<00:02:28.790> isn't<00:02:29.000> too<00:02:29.330> distracting<00:02:30.080> for<00:02:30.379> you<00:02:30.709> I've

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430

applying them I'm having so much fun I

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.199 
applying them I'm having so much fun I
couldn't<00:02:39.829> help<00:02:39.920> myself<00:02:40.160> I<00:02:40.459> had<00:02:40.610> to<00:02:40.640> play<00:02:40.909> today

I'm<00:02:41.510> not<00:02:41.750> wearing<00:02:42.079> eyeliner<00:02:42.620> and<00:02:43.099> I<00:02:43.549> feel<00:02:43.849> like

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
I'm not wearing eyeliner and I feel like

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:45.880 
I'm not wearing eyeliner and I feel like
when<00:02:44.239> I<00:02:44.269> skip<00:02:44.690> the<00:02:44.900> eyeliner<00:02:45.319> step<00:02:45.739> it

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
when I skip the eyeliner step it

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.089 
when I skip the eyeliner step it
actually<00:02:46.220> allows<00:02:46.730> the<00:02:47.150> lashes<00:02:47.750> to<00:02:48.069> show<00:02:49.069> a

00:02:49.089 --> 00:02:49.099 
actually allows the lashes to show a

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:51.160 
actually allows the lashes to show a
little<00:02:49.459> bit<00:02:49.579> more<00:02:49.760> the<00:02:50.180> full<00:02:50.450> length<00:02:50.810> of<00:02:51.019> the

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
little bit more the full length of the

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.140 
little bit more the full length of the
lash<00:02:51.379> can<00:02:51.709> be<00:02:51.859> seen<00:02:52.190> a<00:02:52.220> little<00:02:52.549> bit<00:02:52.700> better<00:02:52.910> I

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
lash can be seen a little bit better I

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.660 
lash can be seen a little bit better I
am<00:02:53.299> content<00:02:53.959> with<00:02:54.200> one<00:02:54.680> coat<00:02:54.980> of<00:02:55.040> this<00:02:55.370> stuff

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
am content with one coat of this stuff

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.809 
am content with one coat of this stuff
so<00:02:55.910> I'll<00:02:56.030> show<00:02:56.269> that<00:02:56.480> going<00:02:56.810> on<00:02:57.019> here<00:02:57.680> I<00:02:57.819> tried

00:02:58.809 --> 00:02:58.819 
so I'll show that going on here I tried

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:00.910 
so I'll show that going on here I tried
to<00:02:58.940> use<00:02:59.150> the<00:02:59.390> method<00:02:59.780> that<00:02:59.810> they<00:03:00.260> mention<00:03:00.739> of

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
to use the method that they mention of

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.699 
to use the method that they mention of
you<00:03:01.760> know<00:03:01.879> using<00:03:02.299> the<00:03:02.540> flat<00:03:02.810> part<00:03:03.170> of<00:03:03.290> it<00:03:03.470> up

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
you know using the flat part of it up

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:05.530 
you know using the flat part of it up
against<00:03:04.160> the<00:03:04.220> base<00:03:04.459> of<00:03:04.670> the<00:03:04.790> lashes<00:03:05.030> then

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
against the base of the lashes then

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.990 
against the base of the lashes then
combing<00:03:06.079> on<00:03:06.200> through<00:03:06.650> and<00:03:07.040> extending<00:03:07.790> out

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
combing on through and extending out

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.559 
combing on through and extending out
with<00:03:08.540> the<00:03:09.530> bristled<00:03:10.099> side<00:03:10.579> of<00:03:10.760> the<00:03:10.879> brush<00:03:11.120> and

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:11.569 
with the bristled side of the brush and

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:13.750 
with the bristled side of the brush and
I<00:03:11.720> think<00:03:11.930> that<00:03:12.049> works<00:03:12.260> really<00:03:12.650> well<00:03:12.829> I<00:03:13.340> mean<00:03:13.579> I

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
I think that works really well I mean I

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.699 
I think that works really well I mean I
instantly<00:03:14.569> can<00:03:14.780> see<00:03:14.930> it<00:03:15.049> building<00:03:15.319> up<00:03:15.410> volume

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
instantly can see it building up volume

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:18.309 
instantly can see it building up volume
I<00:03:16.069> did<00:03:16.489> curl<00:03:16.730> my<00:03:16.970> lashes<00:03:17.000> first<00:03:17.690> I<00:03:17.989> think<00:03:18.200> that

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:18.319 
I did curl my lashes first I think that

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:20.020 
I did curl my lashes first I think that
is<00:03:18.470> important<00:03:18.980> for<00:03:19.190> me<00:03:19.370> there<00:03:19.639> are<00:03:19.760> a<00:03:19.790> couple

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
is important for me there are a couple

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.539 
is important for me there are a couple
of<00:03:20.299> circumstances<00:03:21.200> where<00:03:21.590> I<00:03:21.620> don't<00:03:21.919> like

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:22.549 
of circumstances where I don't like

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:25.089 
of circumstances where I don't like
laying<00:03:23.060> that<00:03:23.299> flat<00:03:23.630> side<00:03:23.900> down<00:03:24.230> first<00:03:24.739> and

00:03:25.089 --> 00:03:25.099 
laying that flat side down first and

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:26.229 
laying that flat side down first and
then<00:03:25.160> combing<00:03:25.609> through<00:03:25.760> with<00:03:25.910> the<00:03:26.030> bristles

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239 
then combing through with the bristles

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:28.539 
then combing through with the bristles
like<00:03:26.750> for<00:03:26.930> example<00:03:27.019> on<00:03:27.380> the<00:03:27.470> lower<00:03:27.680> lashes<00:03:28.069> so

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:28.549 
like for example on the lower lashes so

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:30.580 
like for example on the lower lashes so
I<00:03:28.639> just<00:03:28.819> use<00:03:28.970> the<00:03:29.120> MOR<00:03:29.299> comb<00:03:29.569> like<00:03:29.599> side<00:03:30.200> there

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
I just use the MOR comb like side there

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.470 
I just use the MOR comb like side there
also<00:03:30.889> if<00:03:31.220> you<00:03:31.340> feel<00:03:31.579> like<00:03:31.819> going<00:03:31.970> back<00:03:32.269> and

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
also if you feel like going back and

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.720 
also if you feel like going back and
adding<00:03:32.630> another<00:03:33.019> coat<00:03:33.410> and<00:03:33.769> this<00:03:34.459> will

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
adding another coat and this will

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:36.309 
adding another coat and this will
continue<00:03:35.030> to<00:03:35.299> build<00:03:35.450> up<00:03:35.630> some<00:03:35.930> length<00:03:36.139> and

00:03:36.309 --> 00:03:36.319 
continue to build up some length and

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:39.280 
continue to build up some length and
volume<00:03:36.799> but<00:03:37.069> I<00:03:37.310> would<00:03:37.970> just<00:03:38.239> go<00:03:38.510> with<00:03:38.780> the<00:03:38.959> comb

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
volume but I would just go with the comb

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:41.349 
volume but I would just go with the comb
side<00:03:39.709> if<00:03:40.010> you<00:03:40.160> want<00:03:40.340> to<00:03:40.430> do<00:03:40.579> that<00:03:40.819> otherwise<00:03:41.299> I

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:41.359 
side if you want to do that otherwise I

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:43.809 
side if you want to do that otherwise I
think<00:03:41.599> it<00:03:41.870> can<00:03:42.019> get<00:03:42.169> a<00:03:42.380> little<00:03:42.799> too<00:03:43.099> heavy<00:03:43.310> and

00:03:43.809 --> 00:03:43.819 
think it can get a little too heavy and

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:45.159 
think it can get a little too heavy and
not<00:03:44.030> something<00:03:44.269> I<00:03:44.450> would<00:03:44.569> really<00:03:44.690> feel<00:03:45.049> the

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:45.169 
not something I would really feel the

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:46.870 
not something I would really feel the
need<00:03:45.290> to<00:03:45.470> do<00:03:45.620> with<00:03:45.769> this<00:03:45.919> mascara<00:03:46.370> but<00:03:46.579> I<00:03:46.669> just

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 
need to do with this mascara but I just

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.729 
need to do with this mascara but I just
wanted<00:03:47.120> to<00:03:47.269> show<00:03:47.480> you<00:03:47.540> what<00:03:47.989> happens<00:03:48.500> if<00:03:48.680> you

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:48.739 
wanted to show you what happens if you

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:50.409 
wanted to show you what happens if you
try<00:03:48.980> that<00:03:49.280> it's<00:03:49.489> not<00:03:49.639> really<00:03:49.790> the<00:03:49.910> quickest

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:50.419 
try that it's not really the quickest

00:03:50.419 --> 00:03:52.750 
try that it's not really the quickest
drying<00:03:50.810> mascara<00:03:51.650> which<00:03:51.859> can<00:03:52.099> be<00:03:52.250> kind<00:03:52.430> of<00:03:52.519> nice

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
drying mascara which can be kind of nice

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.339 
drying mascara which can be kind of nice
when<00:03:53.120> you're<00:03:53.239> going<00:03:53.510> back<00:03:53.690> for<00:03:53.959> multiple

00:03:54.339 --> 00:03:54.349 
when you're going back for multiple

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:55.839 
when you're going back for multiple
coats<00:03:54.590> because<00:03:54.919> typically<00:03:55.250> the<00:03:55.430> way<00:03:55.549> I'll<00:03:55.669> do

00:03:55.839 --> 00:03:55.849 
coats because typically the way I'll do

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:58.150 
coats because typically the way I'll do
that<00:03:56.000> is<00:03:56.180> apply<00:03:56.480> to<00:03:56.540> one<00:03:56.930> I<00:03:56.959> go<00:03:57.620> over<00:03:57.859> to<00:03:57.950> this

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
that is apply to one I go over to this

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.339 
that is apply to one I go over to this
side<00:03:58.220> and<00:03:58.639> then<00:03:58.760> come<00:03:59.120> back<00:03:59.150> to<00:03:59.660> this<00:03:59.840> side<00:04:00.109> and

00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:00.349 
side and then come back to this side and

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:01.599 
side and then come back to this side and
I<00:04:00.500> think<00:04:00.560> you're<00:04:00.799> in<00:04:00.889> the<00:04:00.980> best<00:04:01.220> place<00:04:01.579> to

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:01.609 
I think you're in the best place to

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:03.309 
I think you're in the best place to
build<00:04:01.970> on<00:04:02.150> a<00:04:02.180> mascara<00:04:02.690> when<00:04:02.930> it's<00:04:03.079> not

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:03.319 
build on a mascara when it's not

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:05.319 
build on a mascara when it's not
completely<00:04:03.980> dry<00:04:04.310> you<00:04:04.760> know<00:04:04.879> but<00:04:05.090> it's<00:04:05.209> a

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:05.329 
completely dry you know but it's a

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:07.330 
completely dry you know but it's a
little<00:04:05.750> drier<00:04:06.049> than<00:04:06.349> it<00:04:06.440> was<00:04:06.650> does<00:04:06.950> that<00:04:07.129> make

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
little drier than it was does that make

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.369 
little drier than it was does that make
sense<00:04:07.370> mascara<00:04:08.239> does<00:04:08.569> do<00:04:08.840> a<00:04:08.870> pretty<00:04:09.139> good<00:04:09.230> job

00:04:09.369 --> 00:04:09.379 
sense mascara does do a pretty good job

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:11.170 
sense mascara does do a pretty good job

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:13.609 
some mascaras that will straighten my

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:16.509 
some mascaras that will straighten my
curl<00:04:13.879> out<00:04:14.090> absolutely<00:04:14.720> like<00:04:15.199> on<00:04:15.379> contact<00:04:16.160> and

curl out absolutely like on contact and

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:18.890 
curl out absolutely like on contact and
this<00:04:17.030> is<00:04:17.180> not<00:04:17.479> one<00:04:17.690> of<00:04:17.720> those<00:04:17.900> mascaras

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:24.389 
the days when I used to go out I might

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:26.090 
the days when I used to go out I might
hit<00:04:24.630> it<00:04:24.660> with<00:04:24.870> the<00:04:25.020> lash<00:04:25.199> curler<00:04:25.710> one<00:04:25.889> more

downward-pointing state when I've got
this<00:04:39.180> mascara<00:04:39.630> on<00:04:39.960> so<00:04:39.990> that's<00:04:40.289> good<00:04:40.530> news<00:04:40.940> does

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
this mascara on so that's good news does

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.140 
this mascara on so that's good news does
it<00:04:42.090> transfer<00:04:42.570> below<00:04:42.990> the<00:04:43.229> eye<00:04:43.259> most<00:04:44.130> days<00:04:44.550> no

it transfer below the eye most days no

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.330 
it transfer below the eye most days no
there<00:04:46.110> have<00:04:46.199> been<00:04:46.259> a<00:04:46.320> couple<00:04:46.530> situations

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
there have been a couple situations

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.279 
there have been a couple situations
where<00:04:47.460> I've<00:04:47.580> had<00:04:47.759> a<00:04:47.820> little<00:04:48.180> bit<00:04:48.419> happen<00:04:49.050> there

00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:49.289 
where I've had a little bit happen there

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:51.050 
where I've had a little bit happen there
and<00:04:49.320> I<00:04:49.560> think<00:04:50.009> those<00:04:50.220> are<00:04:50.250> maybe<00:04:50.520> times<00:04:50.880> where

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
and I think those are maybe times where

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.090 
and I think those are maybe times where
I<00:04:51.090> got<00:04:51.360> a<00:04:51.630> little<00:04:51.990> too<00:04:52.139> much<00:04:52.320> product<00:04:52.860> on<00:04:52.949> the

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:54.740 
I got a little too much product on the
lower<00:04:53.280> lashes<00:04:53.639> I'm<00:04:54.090> not<00:04:54.210> sure<00:04:54.389> if<00:04:54.479> there's<00:04:54.660> a

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 
lower lashes I'm not sure if there's a

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.230 
lower lashes I'm not sure if there's a
waterproof<00:04:55.199> version<00:04:55.440> that<00:04:56.310> is<00:04:56.550> or<00:04:56.850> will<00:04:57.090> be

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 
waterproof version that is or will be

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.790 
waterproof version that is or will be
available<00:04:57.780> but<00:04:57.960> what<00:04:58.050> I<00:04:58.110> have<00:04:58.410> is<00:04:58.440> not

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
available but what I have is not

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.580 
available but what I have is not
waterproof<00:04:59.210> but<00:05:00.210> it<00:05:00.449> is<00:05:00.750> still<00:05:01.169> I<00:05:01.410> would<00:05:01.560> say

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:01.590 
waterproof but it is still I would say

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:04.670 
waterproof but it is still I would say
slightly<00:05:02.130> resistant<00:05:03.030> when<00:05:03.570> I<00:05:03.930> take<00:05:04.410> it<00:05:04.560> off

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 
slightly resistant when I take it off

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.770 
slightly resistant when I take it off
not<00:05:05.010> the<00:05:05.160> easiest<00:05:05.550> to<00:05:05.729> get<00:05:05.820> off<00:05:05.940> my<00:05:06.150> lashes<00:05:06.630> but

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 
not the easiest to get off my lashes but

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:08.420 
not the easiest to get off my lashes but
it's<00:05:06.930> not<00:05:07.080> as<00:05:07.199> hard<00:05:07.470> as<00:05:07.650> a<00:05:07.680> waterproof<00:05:08.220> mascara

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:08.430 
it's not as hard as a waterproof mascara

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:10.850 
it's not as hard as a waterproof mascara
is<00:05:08.970> to<00:05:09.240> remove<00:05:09.539> but<00:05:09.750> I'm<00:05:09.900> loving<00:05:10.110> this<00:05:10.410> stuff<00:05:10.650> I

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:10.860 
is to remove but I'm loving this stuff I

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:12.680 
is to remove but I'm loving this stuff I
would<00:05:11.010> recommend<00:05:11.550> it<00:05:11.699> I<00:05:11.880> think<00:05:12.120> if<00:05:12.240> you've<00:05:12.449> got

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:12.690 
would recommend it I think if you've got

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:14.779 
would recommend it I think if you've got
problematic<00:05:13.410> lashes<00:05:13.919> maybe<00:05:14.220> somewhat<00:05:14.610> like

00:05:14.779 --> 00:05:14.789 
problematic lashes maybe somewhat like

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:16.610 
problematic lashes maybe somewhat like
mine<00:05:15.030> or<00:05:15.060> maybe<00:05:15.360> you've<00:05:15.539> got<00:05:15.720> awesome<00:05:16.169> lashes

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:16.620 
mine or maybe you've got awesome lashes

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:17.900 
mine or maybe you've got awesome lashes
and<00:05:16.710> you<00:05:16.800> just<00:05:16.949> want<00:05:17.160> to<00:05:17.220> build<00:05:17.490> them<00:05:17.639> up<00:05:17.759> to

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:17.910 
and you just want to build them up to

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:19.790 
and you just want to build them up to
their<00:05:18.030> fullest<00:05:18.449> extent<00:05:18.780> one<00:05:19.199> other<00:05:19.470> detail

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800

I'm<00:05:20.610> glad<00:05:20.849> I<00:05:20.880> remembered<00:05:21.330> to<00:05:21.360> mention<00:05:21.570> this

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:21.900 
I'm glad I remembered to mention this

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.770 
I'm glad I remembered to mention this
they<00:05:22.380> don't<00:05:22.680> feel<00:05:23.099> stiff<00:05:23.729> and<00:05:23.760> brittle<00:05:24.330> so

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:24.780 
they don't feel stiff and brittle so

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:27.350 
they don't feel stiff and brittle so
manages<00:05:25.289> to<00:05:25.470> hold<00:05:25.710> that<00:05:26.010> upward<00:05:26.400> curl<00:05:26.760> but

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 
manages to hold that upward curl but

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.140 
manages to hold that upward curl but
they<00:05:27.539> still<00:05:27.900> have<00:05:28.110> some<00:05:28.500> softness<00:05:29.400> to<00:05:29.699> them<00:05:29.880> so

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:30.150 
they still have some softness to them so

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:31.909 
they still have some softness to them so
I<00:05:30.180> love<00:05:30.570> that<00:05:30.599> let<00:05:31.199> me<00:05:31.229> know<00:05:31.500> what<00:05:31.740> you've
