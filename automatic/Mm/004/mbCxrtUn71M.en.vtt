little hole with your finger and in fact

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.050 
little hole with your finger and in fact
actually<00:02:32.740> you<00:02:32.980> could<00:02:33.100> the<00:02:33.250> water<00:02:33.460> is<00:02:33.790> still

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
actually you could the water is still

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.690 
actually you could the water is still
down<00:02:34.300> there<00:02:34.330> which<00:02:34.720> is<00:02:34.900> good<00:02:35.140> it's<00:02:36.040> about<00:02:36.460> an

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
down there which is good it's about an

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.330 
down there which is good it's about an
inch<00:02:36.910> deep<00:02:37.390> and<00:02:37.660> then<00:02:38.440> just<00:02:38.680> pop<00:02:38.920> it<00:02:39.130> in

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
inch deep and then just pop it in

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.330 
inch deep and then just pop it in
because<00:02:40.330> remember<00:02:40.690> this<00:02:41.290> is<00:02:41.590> going<00:02:41.860> to<00:02:42.070> bulb

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
because remember this is going to bulb

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.910 
because remember this is going to bulb
up<00:02:42.700> here<00:02:43.060> and<00:02:43.480> when<00:02:43.660> you<00:02:43.810> plant<00:02:44.140> onion<00:02:44.590> sets

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
up here and when you plant onion sets

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.530 
up here and when you plant onion sets
you<00:02:45.070> don't<00:02:45.280> plant<00:02:45.550> them<00:02:45.640> that<00:02:45.880> deep<00:02:46.120> you<00:02:46.150> plant

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
you don't plant them that deep you plant

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.930 
you don't plant them that deep you plant
them<00:02:46.630> just<00:02:46.900> below<00:02:47.170> the<00:02:47.230> surface<00:02:47.500> so<00:02:48.070> we'll

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
them just below the surface so we'll

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.690 
them just below the surface so we'll
just<00:02:49.180> pop<00:02:49.360> it<00:02:49.510> in<00:02:49.660> there<00:02:49.930> and<00:02:50.459> then<00:02:51.459> we'll<00:02:51.670> just

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
just pop it in there and then we'll just

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.290 
just pop it in there and then we'll just
cover<00:02:52.270> it<00:02:52.390> up<00:02:52.660> like<00:02:52.959> this<00:02:53.350> okay<00:02:54.280> it<00:02:55.090> most

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
cover it up like this okay it most

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.090 
cover it up like this okay it most
probably<00:02:55.480> won't<00:02:56.020> stand<00:02:56.350> up<00:02:56.620> but<00:02:56.920> obviously

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
probably won't stand up but obviously

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.840 
probably won't stand up but obviously
after<00:02:57.880> it's<00:02:58.480> had<00:02:58.660> a<00:02:58.690> bit<00:02:58.900> of<00:02:58.930> a<00:02:59.080> drink<00:02:59.580> and<00:03:00.580> then

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
after it's had a bit of a drink and then

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.090 
after it's had a bit of a drink and then
it<00:03:01.090> will<00:03:01.300> after<00:03:01.600> maybe<00:03:01.989> a<00:03:02.110> few<00:03:02.380> days<00:03:02.560> it<00:03:02.920> should

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
it will after maybe a few days it should

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.130 
it will after maybe a few days it should
stand<00:03:03.430> up<00:03:03.640> now<00:03:04.120> we'll<00:03:04.300> put<00:03:04.510> the<00:03:04.540> next<00:03:04.900> one<00:03:04.959> in

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
stand up now we'll put the next one in

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.780 
stand up now we'll put the next one in
and<00:03:05.530> we'll<00:03:05.709> actually<00:03:06.190> that's<00:03:06.430> too<00:03:06.640> close

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
and we'll actually that's too close

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:10.410 
and we'll actually that's too close
we'll<00:03:07.300> put<00:03:07.570> them<00:03:07.750> about<00:03:08.380> four<00:03:09.340> to<00:03:09.730> six<00:03:09.760> inches

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
we'll put them about four to six inches

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.240 
we'll put them about four to six inches
apart<00:03:10.810> obviously<00:03:11.170> it<00:03:11.470> depends<00:03:11.709> how<00:03:11.860> big<00:03:12.100> you

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
apart obviously it depends how big you

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.310 
apart obviously it depends how big you
want<00:03:12.430> your<00:03:12.489> onions<00:03:12.940> because<00:03:13.209> the<00:03:13.360> further

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320 
want your onions because the further

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.880 
want your onions because the further
apart<00:03:14.680> you<00:03:14.910> you<00:03:15.910> sow<00:03:16.180> them<00:03:16.420> then<00:03:16.900> the<00:03:17.680> more

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
apart you you sow them then the more

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.699 
apart you you sow them then the more
space<00:03:18.190> they<00:03:18.760> have<00:03:19.030> to<00:03:19.060> grow<00:03:19.510> so<00:03:20.140> I'll<00:03:20.320> just<00:03:20.530> get

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
space they have to grow so I'll just get

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:23.340 
space they have to grow so I'll just get
another<00:03:20.860> one<00:03:21.209> I've<00:03:22.209> made<00:03:22.420> a<00:03:22.480> nice<00:03:22.750> little<00:03:22.780> hole

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
another one I've made a nice little hole

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.130 
another one I've made a nice little hole
in<00:03:23.590> there<00:03:23.860> if<00:03:24.670> there<00:03:25.150> are<00:03:25.360> any<00:03:25.600> that<00:03:25.810> are<00:03:25.930> just

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
in there if there are any that are just

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:27.960 
in there if there are any that are just
too<00:03:26.440> small<00:03:26.830> then<00:03:27.190> just<00:03:27.430> leave<00:03:27.580> them<00:03:27.760> in<00:03:27.850> the

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
too small then just leave them in the

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:29.280 
too small then just leave them in the
compost<00:03:28.180> wait<00:03:28.630> for<00:03:28.750> them<00:03:28.840> to<00:03:28.930> get<00:03:29.050> a<00:03:29.080> little

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
compost wait for them to get a little

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.350 
compost wait for them to get a little
bit<00:03:29.380> bigger<00:03:29.680> and<00:03:29.830> then<00:03:30.340> you<00:03:30.610> can<00:03:30.790> put<00:03:31.000> them<00:03:31.150> in

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 
bit bigger and then you can put them in

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.949 
bit bigger and then you can put them in
okay<00:03:32.140> so<00:03:32.410> we're<00:03:32.680> just<00:03:32.709> put<00:03:32.980> them<00:03:33.100> in<00:03:33.250> there<00:03:33.959> and

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
okay so we're just put them in there and

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:39.210 
okay so we're just put them in there and
then<00:03:35.110> we'll<00:03:35.290> just<00:03:35.470> cover<00:03:35.680> him<00:03:35.920> up<00:03:37.980> just<00:03:38.980> like

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
then we'll just cover him up just like

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:40.110 
then we'll just cover him up just like
that

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
that

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.229 
that
okay<00:03:40.930> well<00:03:41.140> I'll<00:03:41.290> carry<00:03:41.650> on<00:03:41.920> doing<00:03:42.250> those<00:03:42.670> and

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
and when they're big enough to harvest

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.009 
and when they're big enough to harvest
then<00:03:48.129> I'll<00:03:48.280> show<00:03:48.879> you<00:03:48.940> I've<00:03:49.450> got<00:03:49.690> quite<00:03:49.870> a<00:03:49.930> few

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
here I'm not going to do all of them

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.650 
here I'm not going to do all of them
today<00:03:51.550> because<00:03:51.760> some<00:03:51.910> of<00:03:51.940> them<00:03:52.120> are<00:03:52.239> just<00:03:52.510> a

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
today because some of them are just a

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:58.500 
today because some of them are just a
little<00:03:52.900> bit<00:03:53.140> too<00:03:53.379> tiny<00:03:53.620> and<00:03:57.269> as<00:03:58.269> a<00:03:58.299> surprise

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
little bit too tiny and as a surprise

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.289 
little bit too tiny and as a surprise
and<00:03:58.900> so<00:03:59.650> I'll<00:03:59.920> just<00:04:00.129> do<00:04:00.310> the<00:04:00.430> bigger<00:04:00.640> ones<00:04:00.910> and

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
then I'll leave the other ones in the

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:07.050
