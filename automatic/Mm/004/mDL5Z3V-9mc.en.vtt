00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:08.300
 not the return is not bitter 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:10.380
 listen to me the game has won the team 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:12.390
 I had to win 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.790
 football is played as it has been done 

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:16.010
 The hi 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:17.510
 and there is no need to go over the topic 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:22.820
 has been a better team than us in 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:24.750
 everything and has won who does not hear I 'm going 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:28.020
 deputy for something else 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:33.260
 this is football that gm and there is not no 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:33.260
 problem in hai an intense team was born 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:39.610
 he has not played his football has played another 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:42.070
 football and has not won in others 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:45.400
 to soccer what is to get the ball 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:47.800
 from behind he has not won in the other 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:52.809
 football and he has done well 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:56.340
 well perfect perfect 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:56.340
 very good everything 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.050
 I can say that he has won us all 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.030
 the 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.690
 the way to play and in all 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:09.940
 ways of football from outside you can 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:14.200
 offer thus better than us 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:16.320
 what you can congratulate the rival and nothing 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.320
 plus 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:23.520
 I do not think he always knows what 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.630
 he wants that in jaén I did not come here 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.750
 convinced that we were going to get a good 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.750
 result 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.240
 the match and how 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.140
 my team today like this is surpassed by a 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:44.829
 rival who has played much better than 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:47.799
 we with that I think that I already have 

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:49.060
 what to say is not a matter of speaking in my 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:50.380
 team you have to talk about the hi and the jaén 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.899
 He has made everything perfect and has won 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.239
 who had to win neither more nor less yes 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:57.260
 Of course we have made a match 

00:01:55.239 --> 00:01:59.270
 very complete 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.690
 with a tremendous satisfaction because 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.130
 first time 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.870
 we have been able to maintain the 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.210
 goal to zero that for us is very 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:08.700
 important 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.560
 and it has not happened to me that 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.780
 practically poison had to act and 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.240
 that speaks very well of the team because 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.819
 in front of us we have a great team 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.620
 with very good players and 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:21.069
 and there how much a game is very difficult 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.469
 numancy not 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:24.790
 well you have to admit that rooms 

00:02:23.469 --> 00:02:27.040
 quite frankly but also these 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.840
 companions 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.400
 I will not discover hidden habits that 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.010
 for something is here we wanted to bring 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.120
 because we believe that they are selfish in this 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.730
 category can do things 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:40.790
 quite frankly how is he doing that 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:43.680
 in these things really that everything came 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.239
 very annoyed of the day of lugo because 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.650
 nobody were happy what 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:49.819
 we had done because I think the 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:52.159
 The first part we did was very loose 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:55.430
 and we had to react we could not 

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:57.739
 continue in that line of play and I think 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.960
 that the players also coaching staff 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:01.940
 all the world 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:04.819
 we had to tighten a little more the 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:08.269
 nuts all over the world a little bit more 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:11.060
 is right the truth that I do not know if 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:13.549
 that team so attractive to see is but 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:16.040
 we have competed very well in the game what 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:19.629
 important is to compete then you can 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:22.340
 play a little bit better or worse but today 

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:25.050
 every player who has left the field what 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.670
 He has given everything for everyone 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:29.710
 and I do not have to reproach him for anything 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:31.600
 Contrary to thank you because 

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:33.160
 I think I feel very proud of 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.530
 this group of players that I have because 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.790
 has to train and I believe that even the 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.150
 own fans feel good 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:42.090
 proud at this moment of his name 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:44.730
 yes it is clear that 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.800
 and if it's been the team that I like 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.660
 I like to see a team that is capable of 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.879
 control the matches that generates very 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:53.010
 few goal chances and that 

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:55.349
 important highlights yes yes it gives us clear 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.690
 very much confidence but the party 's 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:59.250
 another story Sunday I think that 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:02.650
 let's play for the best template of the 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:04.239
 category group 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:05.829
 after the last signings that have 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:08.439
 done I think that neither the one that put in 

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:10.060
 mallorca does not have a template so 

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:11.890
 competitive at this time as the 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.140
 hands then you're not going to an easy match 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:16.260
 but well yes, we are going with others 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:17.850
 encouragement because we see what 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.700
 if we do things like and we can 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:24.000
 compete and before anyone I know I have 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:25.350
 that I still lose a lot more than I know that 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.570
 I have to lose a lot of game hopefully not 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:31.440
 be so but that this chair is so 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:34.470
 difficult what yes true that after 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.910
 the two losses so tight have we 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:37.420
 put everything as he says a little 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:38.830
 more batteries 

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:40.720
 and we are aware that we are going to lose 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:42.360
 but we have to try that what the 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.370
 games that we lose 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:48.360
 that is not primarily like the loss 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:50.789
 of the one can be lost by 1 1 021 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.990
 own 20 20 but competing until the 

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:54.330
 last minute 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:56.150
 well the truth is that the team has very well 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:59.250
 maintained the intensity of another day and 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:02.400
 well we have already seen what is the way to 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:05.580
 follow and well we have to continue on 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.659
 this line well the truth that well the 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.389
 true that I'm finding myself 

00:05:06.659 --> 00:05:10.740
 physically good and good try 

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:12.960
 work what the boss tells me and 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:14.159
 do it the best possible and good and 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.050
 I hope that little by little they will arrive 

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:19.409
 the goals are also good the truth 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:21.840
 that I expected to find myself worse and the 

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:23.990
 feeling has been pretty good very 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:27.090
 happy because there was not much need 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:29.550
 give you a change of this and the truth that 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:32.449
 after sunday you meet again with 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:36.509
 other stories because of the locker room 

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:39.370
 he is much happier than the week 

00:05:36.509 --> 00:05:42.190
 previous good yes the truth that 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:45.520
 I said it's two positions that I 

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:47.650
 like and that I feel comfortable and the mister 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:52.479
 I know I was the provision of 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:53.979
 where then is not playing better and longer 

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:55.660
 is doing it the best owed the 

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:57.639
 team and the truth that today has come 

00:05:55.660 --> 00:06:00.340
 everything well yes the numancy has 

00:05:57.639 --> 00:06:04.600
 good team have good players and 

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:07.360
 well we already knew him not by the party 

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:08.840
 of league and I do not think we knew how to hold 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:12.680
 well 

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:14.040
 throughout the encounter his attacks the 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:17.820
 true that 

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:20.910
 not thinking I do not think they have had a 

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:23.130
 very clear occasion and the truth that today the 

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:25.790
 team has worked very well many 

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:25.790
 thank you thank you very much
