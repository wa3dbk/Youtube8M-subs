like<00:01:06.619> myself<00:01:06.860> well<00:01:07.369> the<00:01:07.909> advantage<00:01:08.330> of<00:01:08.450> this

00:01:08.499 --> 00:01:08.509 
like myself well the advantage of this

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:10.929 
like myself well the advantage of this
is<00:01:08.630> you<00:01:09.049> whatever<00:01:09.530> devices<00:01:10.040> you<00:01:10.189> have<00:01:10.220> you<00:01:10.700> can

00:01:10.929 --> 00:01:10.939 
is you whatever devices you have you can

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:12.460 
is you whatever devices you have you can
actually<00:01:11.119> just<00:01:11.360> lay<00:01:11.720> them<00:01:11.750> on<00:01:11.960> the<00:01:12.079> pad<00:01:12.259> and

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
actually just lay them on the pad and

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.569 
actually just lay them on the pad and
charge<00:01:12.770> it<00:01:12.950> it's<00:01:13.369> a<00:01:13.490> background<00:01:14.240> task<00:01:15.579> so

00:01:16.569 --> 00:01:16.579 
charge it it's a background task so

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:18.300 
charge it it's a background task so
you've<00:01:16.759> got<00:01:16.790> in<00:01:17.210> an<00:01:17.390> entire<00:01:17.930> array<00:01:18.259> of

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310 
you've got in an entire array of

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.910 
you've got in an entire array of
consumer<00:01:19.310> devices<00:01:19.790> here<00:01:20.329> so<00:01:20.720> if<00:01:21.079> if<00:01:21.380> i<00:01:21.590> were<00:01:21.740> to

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
consumer devices here so if if i were to

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.740 
consumer devices here so if if i were to
use<00:01:22.100> your<00:01:22.250> system<00:01:22.640> in<00:01:22.820> the<00:01:22.970> home<00:01:23.180> what<00:01:23.600> would

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
use your system in the home what would

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.210 
use your system in the home what would
what<00:01:24.110> would<00:01:24.140> it<00:01:24.350> look<00:01:24.380> like<00:01:24.560> and<00:01:24.950> how<00:01:24.979> would<00:01:25.189> i

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220 
what would it look like and how would i

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.060 
what would it look like and how would i
deploy<00:01:25.610> it<00:01:25.759> you<00:01:26.240> would<00:01:26.420> buy<00:01:26.600> the<00:01:27.170> adapters<00:01:27.740> in

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 
deploy it you would buy the adapters in

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.190 
deploy it you would buy the adapters in
this<00:01:28.399> case<00:01:28.640> the<00:01:29.030> apple<00:01:29.329> product<00:01:29.750> here<00:01:29.990> it's<00:01:30.110> a

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
charge four or five devices so it looks

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.450 
charge four or five devices so it looks
like<00:01:41.960> you've<00:01:42.110> got<00:01:42.229> contacts<00:01:43.010> here<00:01:43.250> on<00:01:43.340> the

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
like you've got contacts here on the

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
so the alignment would be pretty

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.520 
so the alignment would be pretty
critical<00:01:47.240> here<00:01:47.600> wouldn't<00:01:47.810> it<00:01:47.870> yeah<00:01:48.290> that's

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:22.119 
know another interesting thing to
realize<00:02:20.060> is<00:02:20.090> it's<00:02:20.420> magnetic<00:02:21.019> oh<00:02:21.260> it<00:02:22.010> is

00:02:22.119 --> 00:02:22.129 
realize is it's magnetic oh it is

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:24.759 
realize is it's magnetic oh it is
magnetic<00:02:22.519> so<00:02:23.000> it<00:02:23.150> will<00:02:23.299> stay<00:02:23.540> at<00:02:23.720> an<00:02:23.840> angle<00:02:24.140> ok

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:24.769 
magnetic so it will stay at an angle ok

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:26.480 
magnetic so it will stay at an angle ok
so<00:02:25.129> here's<00:02:25.549> here's<00:02:25.970> the

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
so here's here's the

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.630 
so here's here's the
the<00:02:26.670> sensor<00:02:27.120> the<00:02:27.690> sensor<00:02:27.720> itself<00:02:28.170> and<00:02:29.160> it<00:02:29.460> is<00:02:29.610> a

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
the sensor the sensor itself and it is a

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.990 
the sensor the sensor itself and it is a
skin<00:02:30.120> that<00:02:30.360> just<00:02:30.600> peels<00:02:31.290> peels<00:02:31.710> off<00:02:31.920> yes<00:02:32.790> and

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
skin that just peels peels off yes and

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.590 
skin that just peels peels off yes and
inside<00:02:33.450> the<00:02:33.600> skin<00:02:33.870> there's<00:02:34.800> our<00:02:35.600> device

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
inside the skin there's our device

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.020 
inside the skin there's our device
that's<00:02:37.050> already<00:02:37.320> molded<00:02:37.650> in<00:02:37.980> with<00:02:38.490> the<00:02:38.700> cable

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
that's already molded in with the cable

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.890 
that's already molded in with the cable
itself<00:02:39.150> okay<00:02:40.430> and<00:02:41.430> wait<00:02:41.700> so<00:02:41.940> it's<00:02:42.180> a<00:02:42.240> where<00:02:42.420> are

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
itself okay and wait so it's a where are

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.290 
itself okay and wait so it's a where are
these<00:02:43.020> available<00:02:43.520> you<00:02:44.520> can<00:02:44.700> buy<00:02:44.820> them<00:02:45.030> through
