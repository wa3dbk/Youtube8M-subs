and it's called a value pen because it
is<00:00:20.880> just<00:00:21.270> a<00:00:21.390> great<00:00:21.630> basic<00:00:22.529> wood<00:00:22.890> burning<00:00:23.130> tool

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:23.600 
is just a great basic wood burning tool

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.080 
is just a great basic wood burning tool
I've<00:00:24.600> taken<00:00:24.990> one<00:00:25.380> of<00:00:25.410> them<00:00:25.650> out<00:00:25.890> and<00:00:26.519> so<00:00:27.000> you

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
I've taken one of them out and so you

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.310 
I've taken one of them out and so you
can<00:00:27.420> see<00:00:27.720> it<00:00:27.869> closed<00:00:28.170> up<00:00:28.310> this<00:00:29.310> tool<00:00:29.789> is<00:00:30.090> a<00:00:30.320> 950

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
can see it closed up this tool is a 950

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.830 
can see it closed up this tool is a 950
degree<00:00:31.679> tool<00:00:33.260> it<00:00:34.260> has<00:00:34.950> an<00:00:35.250> on/off<00:00:35.730> switch<00:00:35.840> for

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
degree tool it has an on/off switch for

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.250 
degree tool it has an on/off switch for
safety<00:00:37.469> which<00:00:37.950> is<00:00:38.160> a<00:00:38.190> great<00:00:38.550> feature<00:00:38.910> and<00:00:39.390> it

comes with Universal Point attached to

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.340 
comes with Universal Point attached to
the<00:00:43.079> tool<00:00:43.430> there<00:00:44.430> are<00:00:44.719> three<00:00:45.719> other<00:00:45.899> points

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
the tool there are three other points

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.490 
the tool there are three other points
that<00:00:46.920> are<00:00:47.370> included<00:00:47.969> in<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.450> tool<00:00:48.750> the

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
shading point the mini the flow point

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.330 
shading point the mini the flow point
and<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.610> cone<00:00:53.910> point<00:00:54.360> as<00:00:54.690> well<00:00:55.559> as<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.980> tools

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
and the cone point as well as the tools

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.590 
and the cone point as well as the tools
stand<00:00:56.989> so<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.020> tools<00:00:58.410> Dan<00:00:58.739> is<00:00:59.090> used<00:01:00.090> for

stand so the tools Dan is used for

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.959 
stand so the tools Dan is used for
safety<00:01:01.109> as<00:01:01.440> well<00:01:01.770> you<00:01:02.460> want<00:01:02.670> to<00:01:02.760> make<00:01:02.940> sure

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
safety as well you want to make sure

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.870 
safety as well you want to make sure
that<00:01:03.480> you<00:01:03.690> always<00:01:03.930> keep<00:01:04.409> your<00:01:04.470> tool<00:01:04.979> on<00:01:05.400> the

that you always keep your tool on the

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.399 
that you always keep your tool on the
stand<00:01:06.510> it's<00:01:06.900> not<00:01:07.590> too<00:01:08.280> often<00:01:09.180> that<00:01:09.810> it<00:01:10.200> would

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
stand it's not too often that it would

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.969 
stand it's not too often that it would
roll<00:01:10.799> but<00:01:11.369> it<00:01:11.640> might<00:01:12.000> so<00:01:12.570> for<00:01:12.900> safety<00:01:13.140> reasons

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
roll but it might so for safety reasons

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.700 
roll but it might so for safety reasons
we<00:01:14.280> always<00:01:15.150> suggest<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:15.720> put<00:01:16.020> it<00:01:16.140> on<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.439> tool

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
we always suggest to put it on the tool

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.219 
we always suggest to put it on the tool
stand<00:01:18.409> remember<00:01:19.409> that<00:01:19.970> to<00:01:20.970> take<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.600> points

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
stand remember that to take the points

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.230 
stand remember that to take the points
on<00:01:22.439> and<00:01:22.799> off

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
on and off

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.710 
on and off
typically<00:01:25.110> we<00:01:25.470> we<00:01:25.979> say<00:01:26.369> and<00:01:26.820> our<00:01:26.939> instructions

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
typically we we say and our instructions

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.240 
typically we we say and our instructions
to<00:01:28.939> turn<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.119> tool<00:01:30.360> off<00:01:30.750> let<00:01:31.380> it<00:01:31.560> cool<00:01:31.829> down

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
to turn the tool off let it cool down

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.789 
to turn the tool off let it cool down
but<00:01:33.030> I<00:01:33.090> know<00:01:33.299> that<00:01:33.689> a<00:01:33.750> lot<00:01:34.049> of<00:01:34.079> people<00:01:34.530> are

to<00:02:17.069> your<00:02:17.190> pin<00:02:17.900> I<00:02:18.900> have<00:02:19.530> some<00:02:19.799> samples<00:02:20.400> here<00:02:20.489> to

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
to your pin I have some samples here to

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.170 
to your pin I have some samples here to
show<00:02:21.269> you<00:02:21.330> and<00:02:22.019> you<00:02:23.010> can<00:02:23.250> do<00:02:23.400> all<00:02:23.670> kinds<00:02:23.700> of

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180

show you and you can do all kinds of
things<00:02:24.269> with<00:02:24.659> this<00:02:24.810> panic<00:02:25.319> comes<00:02:25.620> with<00:02:25.860> four

00:02:26.149 --> 00:02:26.159 
things with this panic comes with four

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:29.119 
things with this panic comes with four
points<00:02:26.730> so<00:02:27.000> you<00:02:27.750> have<00:02:28.049> lots<00:02:28.470> of<00:02:28.680> room<00:02:29.099> for
