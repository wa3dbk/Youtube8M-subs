00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:05.540
 the crisis 

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:12.010
 we are not scared now she had full experience of how was the 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:15.010
 placement treatments with only seven 

00:00:16.089 --> 00:00:19.089
 because I wanted to go back to the aesthetic center 

00:00:20.249 --> 00:00:22.679
 it would not be that much 

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:25.899
 no one has a common doubt agreement that being born 

00:00:25.899 --> 00:00:28.609
 of course 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:32.590
 and then I remembered you expert in the subject decided 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:33.780
 Search for 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.280
 that morning 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.280
 the index closed with Andres Sanchez explained how to see the procedures and 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.030
 such 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.750
 I was very excited that same 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.750
 very excited to take a turn in my life 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.200
 and he was really what happened after he started with his feet 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.980
 cases as the treatment process would be 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.530
 and I was very excited 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.079
 I went to my family to stop and report trillions of yuan 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.860
 t-shirt too 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.240
 and that's how I 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.090
 I started acting like this treatment 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.090
 I gave up some things got worse 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.340
 you can start 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.310
 with what there is to do the treatment as it should be done right 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.550
 if you make a proposal you will fulfill the offer 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:21.890
 is the profile of the client that 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.170
 we need is to be like this 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:25.430
 in alagoas 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.680
 told me to be thought for an aesthetic treatment incidence already 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:30.719
 had in mind 

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:34.579
 or be thought of doing a surgery make something beautiful of that kind 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.360
 I really wanted surgery but I really wanted to 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.730
 when you offer this option 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:42.860
 of you staying with the better room 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.860
 no surgery needed for me was perfect 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.280
 and go but I think it's important to point out that from the moment you set out 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.409
 do something you have to try and head and do 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:00.280
 in ibaraki adjusted because otherwise it will be cool nor for who does ends up 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.730
 spending time and money on the person proposing treatment is in the middle of 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:08.890
 way I think I did not give a legal backing when I set out to do 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.319
 treatment I sent food messages 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:13.670
 my acts 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.670
 harry of physicists 

00:02:19.179 --> 00:02:24.429
 I was very determined I think it was very important in the process of 

00:02:24.429 --> 00:02:25.559
 treatment 

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:29.719
 good I know accompanied with bag that will contain and treatment of the disease as 

00:02:29.719 --> 00:02:32.449
 do not pay customers who went through the same process 

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:35.150
 you see it's a very big difference 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.750
 client amendment when she proposes to do it 

00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:43.140
 in the case when you start doing your treatment 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.380
 beyond the result because you start small talk on the issue of 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:48.759
 self esteem 

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:50.119
 How was it for you? 

00:02:50.119 --> 00:02:53.279
 even when I'm doing it while I was here in my treatment 

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:58.510
 I had some clients that I realized teams that I will not do any more is that 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:59.999
 there is no more staff 

00:02:59.999 --> 00:03:02.999
 and you know you have proposals presented to us 

00:03:03.669 --> 00:03:06.739
 with this value would be good I am to do it right 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:12.569
 and I think that this has been avoided and we have not been in the process since the 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:15.359
 start when you come and go 

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:17.150
 in these shelters or 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.660
 you're doing well, you're going to see that the states are 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.099
 happening 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:22.859
 then she 

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:24.289
 I think 

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:29.879
 is the process you understand that has to make you enter with all this energy 

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:34.429
 and strength to do that and the result only works 

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:39.310
 and it was very difficult was questioned by the trade is that we put that 

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:41.259
 Do you eat three times a day? 

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:44.359
 evans including 60 years of foundation 

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:47.199
 I said that you certainly more times 

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:49.999
 they asked if this relationship with 

00:03:49.999 --> 00:03:52.319
 but ashamed and who will wait 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:56.959
 if you saw the difference in the whole life of you increase in it the number of 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:59.750
 paving clients 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:00.959
 it's wrong 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:06.199
 my message you print a portion of the area for another house 

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:08.280
 but so on the health issue 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.679
 and in the water issue too 

00:04:10.679 --> 00:04:11.759
 install 

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:17.229
 it was made for me I think is to change the type of feed the quantity 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:20.400
 attacker 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:21.939
 and I go to the wood 

00:04:21.939 --> 00:04:26.360
 today leads up to the bottle awake night I drink water I think this 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:27.199
 it's a process 

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:30.490
 is a very complex process sides let me pass 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:34.229
 that you have to spend is for nothing change of habit is no use you 

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:36.010
 aesthetic line and continue 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:38.950
 the method says a lot of mass 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:42.180
 however at lunchtime with locke coming here 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:43.940
 no miracles will happen 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:48.870
 we have to do our part to make the whole process a reality. 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:53.120
 quality of life proposal more of the debt and so it is that pc at home the 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.500
 my 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.629
 however this is one thing and then do another 

00:04:56.629 --> 00:05:01.939
 it is error change in eating habits change in physical process 

00:05:01.939 --> 00:05:05.419
 and this gives you a change in overall quality of life
