00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
more in you and that's the big

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.300

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
philosophy they all about like the main

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:22.949 
philosophy they all about like the main
thing<00:02:21.520> I've<00:02:21.670> probably<00:02:21.700> looked<00:02:22.120> is<00:02:22.330> how<00:02:22.570> I<00:02:22.600> can

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
thing I've probably looked is how I can

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:25.470 
thing I've probably looked is how I can
actually<00:02:23.110> push<00:02:23.380> myself<00:02:23.590> in<00:02:24.370> life<00:02:24.520> where<00:02:25.209> my

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
actually push myself in life where my

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.900 
actually push myself in life where my
full<00:02:26.170> limits<00:02:26.530> lie<00:02:26.740> like<00:02:27.010> the<00:02:27.580> ones<00:02:27.730> that<00:02:27.790> I

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
full limits lie like the ones that I

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.120 
full limits lie like the ones that I
have<00:02:28.140> that<00:02:29.140> I<00:02:29.200> could<00:02:29.380> push<00:02:29.620> it<00:02:29.650> further<00:02:29.890> than

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
have that I could push it further than

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.460 
have that I could push it further than
that<00:02:30.190> I<00:02:30.600> discovered<00:02:31.600> new<00:02:31.750> limits<00:02:32.140> and<00:02:32.290> stuff

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
that I discovered new limits and stuff

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:41.010 
that I discovered new limits and stuff
like<00:02:32.590> that<00:02:37.230> their<00:02:38.230> course<00:02:38.470> was<00:02:38.770> magic<00:02:39.520> and<00:02:40.020> it

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.020 
like that their course was magic and it

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:42.479 
like that their course was magic and it
would<00:02:41.230> have<00:02:41.380> to<00:02:41.620> be<00:02:41.650> one<00:02:41.920> of<00:02:42.040> the<00:02:42.100> most<00:02:42.190> coolest

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
would have to be one of the most coolest

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:44.610 
would have to be one of the most coolest
things<00:02:42.850> that<00:02:43.150> I<00:02:43.360> have<00:02:43.660> ever<00:02:43.810> done<00:02:43.900> in<00:02:44.350> my<00:02:44.410> life

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620
