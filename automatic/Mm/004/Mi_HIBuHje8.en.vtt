00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 ninth year quite close to the ground in 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.779
 anyway by space standards 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.510
 fly asteroid apophis diameter to 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:12.480
 300 meters and then he will return through 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.429
 seven years and in 2036 theoretically not 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.010
 its collision with our 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.760
 the planets are alas not a scarecrow and not a script 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.220
 from a horror movie 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.230
 and terrifying truth and now more and more 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.760
 specialist fight over how you can 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.920
 prevent asteroid collision 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.750
 and steer it off the ground 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.090
 some suggestions are quite 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.650
 nontrivially for example send to drains 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.410
 the office of the aircraft which 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.320
 spray paint and paint the asteroid in 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.270
 black white color why and if it helps 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.660
 save our planet about this you will learn 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:47.730
 from our final material in 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:50.399
 night of 3 to 4 july 1994 astronomers 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.829
 of the whole world were frozen in a telescope on their 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.949
 eyes tragedy was played it was 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.390
 space attack on our neighbor 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:01:00.270
 a huge comet approached jupiter 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.840
 then fell apart and crashed into 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.960
 the planet 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.970
 the effect was terrible the explosion was so powerful 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.100
 that the temperature of the atmosphere has risen by 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.369
 a few degrees and the sky rose 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.840
 a cloud the size of our land 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:15.180
 a disaster on jupiter forced scientists 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.670
 feel the whole vulnerability of the earth 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.950
 before the space killers began 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:23.100
 advanced searches for dangerous objects and 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.439
 developing methods of protection against them is one 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:30.049
 that killer already found this asteroid 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:31.439
 apophis by the calculations of scientists in 2029 and in 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:34.110
 2036 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:36.780
 boulder with a diameter of 300 meters and 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.659
 weighing 100 million tons will pass between 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.490
 the earth and the moon just a distance 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:44.130
 thirty six thousand kilometers from our 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:47.290
 planets and although the likelihood of collision 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.900
 negligible nevertheless it really 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:53.770
 falling apophis the world ocean will cause 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:56.260
 tsunami is 300 times more powerful than us 2004 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:59.710
 years in the indian ocean which carried away 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:02.650
 200 thousand lives if apophis crashes 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:05.050
 in the ground it will be tantamount to an explosion 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:07.930
 several megatons of their nuclear bombs 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:10.770
 such a blow can completely change the nature 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:13.300
 planets and destroy civilization 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:16.330
 There are currently two options. 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.640
 protection from space killer one of their 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.920
 blow up an asteroid using atomic 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.600
 bombs like brave blues did 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.970
 willis movie armageddon 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.380
 however such a radical way is good 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.050
 only for bad hollywood 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:31.240
 blockbusters in fact instead of one 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.390
 large bodies on the ground can fall down 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:36.310
 hail of fragments slightly smaller 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.620
 Tunguska meteorite second version 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.959
 protection of flight path change 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:44.020
 asteroid curious idea put forth 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:45.010
 american scientist david dunhill he 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.140
 suggested using 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.830
 asteroid reflectivity 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:54.730
 color it in contrasting colors 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:56.500
 stay voice all asteroids rotate in 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.600
 reflectivity dependence 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.390
 dust on their surface their trajectories 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:03.010
 movements may vary slightly 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:05.350
 builds gets a boost from solar 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.540
 light on one side and then gets 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:09.970
 push in the form of outgoing heat on the other 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.709
 which causes it to rotate it 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.200
 called and Yarkovsky's test 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:16.480
 if we can change the reflective 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.489
 asteroid capacity amount of heat 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.830
 which it absorbs and the amount 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:23.230
 the light which it reflects then we can 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:25.420
 change the effect of yarkovsky and force 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:29.380
 asteroid move on somewhat different 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:30.910
 trajectories that is if using 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.980
 spacecraft inflict 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:35.650
 contrasting colors on different sides 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.600
 asteroid then you can speed up its rotation 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:40.000
 and change the flight path 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.980
 already developed some techniques 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.900
 which will allow such 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.870
 operations with small asteroids 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:49.480
 the size of 15-20 meters but this method 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:52.209
 has its drawbacks asteroid is not 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:54.610
 the ball is not a very perfect figure 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:57.040
 the wrong shape is wrong of those bodies and 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:04:00.190
 let's say we paint this asteroid but 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:02.350
 calculate the result of the change in light 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:04.450
 pressure itself it acts very 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:06.489
 difficult and most likely with such a large 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:08.470
 a mistake that we cannot say what it is 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:11.350
 will result and if we cannot predict 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:14.290
 the result is not worth it and do 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:15.609
 otherwise, we can even hurt ourselves except 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:18.070
 asteroid painting 

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:20.590
 There are other ways to divert space 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:23.020
 body with a dangerous trajectory it can be 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:25.480
 surface explosion that will change it 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:28.150
 orbit using laser beam 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:30.760
 rays or gravity tractor 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:33.370
 However, according to scientists, not one 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:36.639
 The way to the end is not calculated to 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:39.130
 X hours left 24 years old I want to believe 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:41.680
 that during this time, scientists will still find 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:43.870
 the best solution to the problem otherwise we 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.840
 It remains to rely only on luck and 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:48.550
 maybe Russian Julia will carry 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.060
