fuel pump to make it run in it that

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:03.579 
fuel pump to make it run in it that
fouled<00:01:02.059> up<00:01:02.239> our<00:01:02.420> fuel<00:01:02.629> pump<00:01:02.659> test<00:01:03.049> the<00:01:03.260> initial

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:03.589 
fouled up our fuel pump test the initial

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:06.970 
fouled up our fuel pump test the initial
test<00:01:04.059> but<00:01:05.059> now<00:01:05.210> we<00:01:05.270> have<00:01:05.510> fuel<00:01:05.810> pressure<00:01:06.050> God

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:06.980 
test but now we have fuel pressure God

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:08.230 
test but now we have fuel pressure God
knows<00:01:07.130> how<00:01:07.250> much<00:01:07.400> because<00:01:07.760> I<00:01:07.790> don't<00:01:08.030> have<00:01:08.120> the
