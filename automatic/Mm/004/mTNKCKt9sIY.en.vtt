movies<00:01:19.100> today<00:01:19.250> are<00:01:19.520> squeaky<00:01:20.030> clean<00:01:20.180> not<00:01:20.720> even

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:20.870 
movies today are squeaky clean not even

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:23.620 
movies today are squeaky clean not even
a<00:01:21.080> single<00:01:21.350> chance<00:01:21.890> of<00:01:22.190> anything<00:01:22.630> somewhat

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
a single chance of anything somewhat

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.360 
a single chance of anything somewhat
racy<00:01:23.870> in<00:01:24.230> the<00:01:24.350> movie<00:01:24.590> and<00:01:24.740> that's<00:01:24.860> unfortunate

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:25.370 
racy in the movie and that's unfortunate

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:26.530 
racy in the movie and that's unfortunate
because<00:01:25.430> when<00:01:25.670> I<00:01:25.700> was<00:01:25.880> younger<00:01:26.060> and<00:01:26.210> watching

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
because when I was younger and watching

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.480 
because when I was younger and watching
kids<00:01:26.780> movies<00:01:27.110> I<00:01:27.230> guess<00:01:27.410> there<00:01:27.860> were<00:01:27.980> plenty<00:01:28.250> of

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
kids movies I guess there were plenty of

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.760 
kids movies I guess there were plenty of
double<00:01:29.150> meanings<00:01:29.540> and<00:01:29.780> hidden<00:01:30.409> sexual

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
double meanings and hidden sexual

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.649 
double meanings and hidden sexual
innuendo<00:01:31.520> and<00:01:31.550> stuff<00:01:31.880> all<00:01:32.210> kinds<00:01:32.540> of<00:01:32.600> stuff

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:32.659 
innuendo and stuff all kinds of stuff

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:33.790 
innuendo and stuff all kinds of stuff
like<00:01:32.960> that<00:01:32.990> and<00:01:33.140> they<00:01:33.380> don't<00:01:33.470> have<00:01:33.560> that

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:33.800 
like that and they don't have that

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.290 
like that and they don't have that
anymore<00:01:33.830> and<00:01:34.310> I<00:01:34.340> don't<00:01:34.370> understand<00:01:34.850> why<00:01:35.030> it's

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:35.300 
anymore and I don't understand why it's

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:36.700 
anymore and I don't understand why it's
really<00:01:35.450> just<00:01:35.750> kind<00:01:36.050> of<00:01:36.080> pathetic<00:01:36.230> in<00:01:36.590> my

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
really just kind of pathetic in my

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:37.660 
really just kind of pathetic in my
opinion<00:01:36.950> because<00:01:37.070> it's<00:01:37.250> not<00:01:37.340> like<00:01:37.430> the<00:01:37.490> kids

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
opinion because it's not like the kids

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.040 
opinion because it's not like the kids
understand<00:01:38.120> and<00:01:38.360> then<00:01:38.600> when<00:01:38.690> you<00:01:38.780> watch<00:01:38.900> it

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:39.050 
understand and then when you watch it

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:40.570 
understand and then when you watch it
years<00:01:39.200> later<00:01:39.260> as<00:01:39.530> an<00:01:39.650> adult<00:01:39.710> you're<00:01:40.040> like<00:01:40.220> holy

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
that are you know kids wouldn't

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:48.190 
that are you know kids wouldn't
understand<00:01:47.479> it<00:01:47.540> would<00:01:47.600> go<00:01:47.720> over<00:01:47.810> their<00:01:47.990> heads

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
understand it would go over their heads

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.960 
understand it would go over their heads
there<00:01:48.770> are<00:01:49.010> references<00:01:49.280> that<00:01:49.729> would<00:01:49.850> go<00:01:49.940> over

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
their heads and also I think there was

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:53.380 
their heads and also I think there was
even<00:01:52.130> a<00:01:52.190> curse<00:01:52.400> in<00:01:52.610> their<00:01:52.790> cursor<00:01:53.210> to

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
even a curse in their cursor to

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.090 
even a curse in their cursor to
something<00:01:53.990> like<00:01:54.110> that<00:01:54.260> either<00:01:54.500> way<00:01:54.680> all<00:01:54.950> I'm

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
something like that either way all I'm

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.440 
something like that either way all I'm
saying<00:01:55.340> is<00:01:55.490> not<00:01:55.700> to<00:01:55.820> say<00:01:55.940> that<00:01:55.970> it's<00:01:56.210> a<00:01:56.270> nasty

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
saying is not to say that it's a nasty

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.469 
saying is not to say that it's a nasty
movie<00:01:56.900> at<00:01:56.990> all<00:01:57.080> but<00:01:57.620> it's<00:01:57.920> not<00:01:58.280> spineless<00:01:59.030> and

00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479

the animation is so impressive I
couldn't<00:02:04.250> even<00:02:04.460> imagine<00:02:04.870> doing<00:02:05.870> this<00:02:06.020> stuff

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530

incredible but let's get a little bit

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:13.930

more<00:02:12.409> detailed<00:02:12.830> with<00:02:13.040> ParaNorman<00:02:13.640> starting

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
more detailed with ParaNorman starting

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.820 
more detailed with ParaNorman starting
with<00:02:14.030> the<00:02:14.120> plot<00:02:14.330> I<00:02:14.569> thought<00:02:15.140> that<00:02:15.349> the<00:02:15.470> story

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
with the plot I thought that the story

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.350 
with the plot I thought that the story
was<00:02:16.190> okay<00:02:16.700> it's<00:02:16.849> something<00:02:17.060> I've<00:02:17.150> kind<00:02:17.330> of

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
was okay it's something I've kind of

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.420 
was okay it's something I've kind of
seen<00:02:17.420> before<00:02:17.989> it's<00:02:18.379> nothing<00:02:18.769> groundbreaking

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
seen before it's nothing groundbreaking

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.160 
seen before it's nothing groundbreaking
I<00:02:19.849> don't<00:02:20.030> think<00:02:20.269> in<00:02:20.450> general<00:02:20.750> I<00:02:21.019> mean

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
I don't think in general I mean

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:22.390 
I don't think in general I mean
obviously<00:02:21.290> you<00:02:21.650> know<00:02:21.739> some<00:02:21.890> of<00:02:21.920> the<00:02:22.040> details

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
obviously you know some of the details

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.649 
obviously you know some of the details
might<00:02:22.610> be<00:02:22.730> different<00:02:22.939> but<00:02:23.150> I<00:02:23.269> thought<00:02:23.420> it<00:02:23.540> was

00:02:23.649 --> 00:02:23.659 
might be different but I thought it was

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:24.970 
might be different but I thought it was
good<00:02:23.779> enough<00:02:23.989> and<00:02:24.200> it<00:02:24.290> definitely<00:02:24.439> surprised

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
good enough and it definitely surprised

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.410 
good enough and it definitely surprised
me<00:02:25.129> in<00:02:25.219> some<00:02:25.400> cases<00:02:25.609> it<00:02:25.909> gets<00:02:26.120> pretty

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
me in some cases it gets pretty

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.570 
me in some cases it gets pretty
emotional<00:02:26.870> toward<00:02:27.050> the<00:02:27.170> end<00:02:27.319> and<00:02:27.560> much<00:02:28.310> deeper

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
emotional toward the end and much deeper

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:29.860 
emotional toward the end and much deeper
than<00:02:28.790> I<00:02:28.940> would<00:02:29.030> have<00:02:29.060> expected<00:02:29.209> for<00:02:29.630> a<00:02:29.690> kids

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
than I would have expected for a kids

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.750 
than I would have expected for a kids
movie<00:02:30.050> I<00:02:30.170> mean<00:02:30.380> I<00:02:30.410> don't<00:02:30.620> think<00:02:30.830> many<00:02:31.430> kids<00:02:31.520> are

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
movie I mean I don't think many kids are

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.400

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.330 
much I appreciate the work these guys do
I<00:03:08.420> don't<00:03:08.810> think<00:03:08.959> I<00:03:09.110> could<00:03:09.560> possibly<00:03:09.920> do<00:03:10.130> it<00:03:10.250> I

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
I don't think I could possibly do it I

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.490 
I don't think I could possibly do it I
don't<00:03:10.459> have<00:03:10.549> the<00:03:10.640> patience<00:03:11.060> so<00:03:11.780> good<00:03:12.200> for<00:03:12.350> them

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
don't have the patience so good for them

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.830 
don't have the patience so good for them
it's<00:03:12.739> it's<00:03:12.920> fantastic<00:03:13.670> i<00:03:13.819> will<00:03:14.030> say<00:03:14.180> that<00:03:14.209> some

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
it's it's fantastic i will say that some

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.570 
it's it's fantastic i will say that some
of<00:03:14.930> the<00:03:15.019> comedic<00:03:15.319> timing<00:03:15.620> i<00:03:16.040> guess<00:03:16.400> you<00:03:16.489> could

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:16.580 
of the comedic timing i guess you could

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.340 
of the comedic timing i guess you could
say<00:03:16.700> comedic<00:03:17.060> timing<00:03:17.209> is<00:03:17.660> a<00:03:17.690> little<00:03:17.900> bit<00:03:18.200> off

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:18.350 
say comedic timing is a little bit off

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:20.440 
say comedic timing is a little bit off
but<00:03:18.709> I<00:03:18.920> feel<00:03:19.370> like<00:03:19.489> I<00:03:19.640> you<00:03:19.700> know<00:03:19.850> you<00:03:20.239> can<00:03:20.390> only

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
but I feel like I you know you can only

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.180 
but I feel like I you know you can only
say<00:03:20.690> that<00:03:20.720> because<00:03:20.959> it's<00:03:21.230> in<00:03:21.500> the<00:03:21.739> animation

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
say that because it's in the animation

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.160 
say that because it's in the animation
so<00:03:22.549> maybe<00:03:22.730> you<00:03:23.000> know<00:03:23.120> once<00:03:23.600> they<00:03:23.750> watch<00:03:23.959> it

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
so maybe you know once they watch it

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:25.870 
so maybe you know once they watch it
they<00:03:24.290> can't<00:03:24.530> really<00:03:24.620> fix<00:03:24.950> some<00:03:25.400> little<00:03:25.640> things

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
they can't really fix some little things

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.309 
they can't really fix some little things
here<00:03:26.060> and<00:03:26.120> there<00:03:26.239> I<00:03:26.330> don't<00:03:26.510> know<00:03:26.660> but<00:03:27.110> the

00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:27.319 
here and there I don't know but the

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:28.390 
here and there I don't know but the
other<00:03:27.440> thing<00:03:27.620> is<00:03:27.739> I<00:03:27.830> was<00:03:27.950> hoping<00:03:28.160> the<00:03:28.250> movie

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
other thing is I was hoping the movie

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:29.860 
other thing is I was hoping the movie
would<00:03:28.519> be<00:03:28.549> a<00:03:28.640> little<00:03:28.819> bit<00:03:29.030> darker<00:03:29.540> I<00:03:29.569> mean

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
would be a little bit darker I mean

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.020 
would be a little bit darker I mean
obviously<00:03:30.049> it<00:03:30.500> was<00:03:30.620> somewhat<00:03:31.220> dark<00:03:31.459> but<00:03:31.640> I<00:03:31.820> was

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
obviously it was somewhat dark but I was

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:33.520 
obviously it was somewhat dark but I was
hoping<00:03:32.090> to<00:03:32.269> be<00:03:32.390> a<00:03:32.420> little<00:03:32.690> bit<00:03:32.930> darker<00:03:33.350> it's

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
hoping to be a little bit darker it's

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.460 
hoping to be a little bit darker it's
definitely<00:03:34.010> still<00:03:34.370> stayed<00:03:34.959> light<00:03:35.959> but<00:03:36.350> these

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
definitely still stayed light but these

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.110 
definitely still stayed light but these
are<00:03:36.650> obviously<00:03:36.769> not<00:03:37.070> major<00:03:37.400> gripe<00:03:37.670> so<00:03:37.970> it's

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
are obviously not major gripe so it's

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.000 
are obviously not major gripe so it's
not<00:03:38.239> a<00:03:38.299> big<00:03:38.510> deal<00:03:38.540> and<00:03:38.930> acting<00:03:39.380> wise<00:03:39.560> of<00:03:39.829> course

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
not a big deal and acting wise of course

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:41.710 
not a big deal and acting wise of course
the<00:03:40.160> voice<00:03:40.310> acting<00:03:40.760> I<00:03:40.880> thought<00:03:41.060> was<00:03:41.209> very<00:03:41.269> good

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
the voice acting I thought was very good

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.630 
the voice acting I thought was very good

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010
