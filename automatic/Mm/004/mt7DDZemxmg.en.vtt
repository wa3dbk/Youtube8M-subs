00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:44.210 
the negative armor effect on top of it

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:45.700 
the negative armor effect on top of it
the<00:02:44.330> way<00:02:44.450> I've<00:02:44.600> set<00:02:44.870> it<00:02:44.900> up<00:02:45.080> as<00:02:45.200> you<00:02:45.230> can<00:02:45.530> see

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:45.710 
the way I've set it up as you can see

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:47.440 
the way I've set it up as you can see
looking<00:02:45.830> at<00:02:46.100> it<00:02:46.250> I've<00:02:46.340> got<00:02:46.370> radiation<00:02:46.820> viral

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
looking at it I've got radiation viral

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.060 
looking at it I've got radiation viral
so<00:02:47.570> the<00:02:47.690> radiation<00:02:48.170> it's<00:02:48.740> going<00:02:48.860> to<00:02:48.950> cause

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
so the radiation it's going to cause

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:50.620 
so the radiation it's going to cause
negative<00:02:49.340> accuracy<00:02:49.970> and<00:02:50.120> of<00:02:50.210> course<00:02:50.420> they're

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
negative accuracy and of course they're

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.000 
negative accuracy and of course they're
going<00:02:50.750> to<00:02:50.810> fire<00:02:50.990> upon<00:02:51.140> each<00:02:51.470> other<00:02:51.680> because

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
going to fire upon each other because

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.070 
going to fire upon each other because
they<00:02:52.130> get<00:02:52.250> confused<00:02:52.730> as<00:02:53.360> to<00:02:53.420> who's<00:02:53.750> the<00:02:53.900> real

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
they get confused as to who's the real

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.020 
they get confused as to who's the real
enemy<00:02:54.260> and<00:02:54.560> then<00:02:54.680> finally<00:02:55.010> we<00:02:55.160> also<00:02:55.340> lose<00:02:55.670> max

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
enemy and then finally we also lose max

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.840 
enemy and then finally we also lose max
health<00:02:56.300> with<00:02:56.690> the<00:02:56.810> viral<00:02:57.170> so<00:02:57.680> this<00:02:57.830> is<00:02:57.860> super

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
health with the viral so this is super

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.630 
health with the viral so this is super
beast<00:02:59.660> of<00:02:59.960> a<00:03:00.020> weapon<00:03:00.200> without<00:03:00.530> needing<00:03:01.310> to<00:03:01.340> put

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
beast of a weapon without needing to put

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.690 
beast of a weapon without needing to put
major<00:03:02.120> amounts<00:03:02.660> of<00:03:02.750> forma<00:03:03.050> into<00:03:03.380> it<00:03:03.700> the

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
major amounts of forma into it the

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.390 
major amounts of forma into it the
downside<00:03:05.690> of<00:03:05.840> course<00:03:05.870> is<00:03:06.260> going<00:03:06.890> to<00:03:07.070> be<00:03:07.190> your

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
downside of course is going to be your

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.990 
downside of course is going to be your
loss<00:03:07.670> of<00:03:08.230> ammo<00:03:09.250> so<00:03:10.250> you<00:03:10.340> put<00:03:10.460> a<00:03:10.490> little<00:03:10.640> pistol

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
loss of ammo so you put a little pistol

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.850 
loss of ammo so you put a little pistol
ammo<00:03:11.270> in<00:03:11.450> here<00:03:11.840> if<00:03:11.930> you<00:03:11.990> really<00:03:12.260> wanted<00:03:12.530> to<00:03:12.590> put

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
ammo in here if you really wanted to put

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.660 
ammo in here if you really wanted to put
a<00:03:13.070> forma<00:03:14.000> and<00:03:14.180> I<00:03:14.330> put<00:03:14.570> it<00:03:14.690> in<00:03:14.840> basically<00:03:15.670> just

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
a forma and I put it in basically just

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.350 
a forma and I put it in basically just
to<00:03:17.180> be<00:03:17.270> able<00:03:17.330> to<00:03:18.370> take<00:03:19.370> care<00:03:19.550> of<00:03:19.610> this<00:03:19.820> pistol

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:20.360 
to be able to take care of this pistol

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.210 
to be able to take care of this pistol
ammo<00:03:20.540> mutation<00:03:21.050> mod<00:03:21.230> but<00:03:21.380> I'd<00:03:21.500> probably<00:03:21.710> swap

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
ammo mutation mod but I'd probably swap

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.450 
ammo mutation mod but I'd probably swap
out<00:03:22.430> this<00:03:22.640> V<00:03:22.910> and<00:03:23.480> put<00:03:23.870> in<00:03:24.020> our<00:03:24.740> swap<00:03:25.250> out<00:03:25.400> of

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:25.460 
out this V and put in our swap out of

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:27.100 
out this V and put in our swap out of
the<00:03:25.520> D<00:03:25.670> and<00:03:25.700> put<00:03:26.000> in<00:03:26.090> a<00:03:26.180> V<00:03:26.330> or<00:03:26.360> something<00:03:26.960> else

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.110 
the D and put in a V or something else

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:29.110 
the D and put in a V or something else
here<00:03:27.410> just<00:03:28.220> for<00:03:28.310> that<00:03:28.370> but<00:03:28.580> as<00:03:28.670> you<00:03:28.760> can<00:03:28.880> see<00:03:29.030> we

here just for that but as you can see we

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.850 
here just for that but as you can see we
got<00:03:29.270> our<00:03:29.390> basic<00:03:29.750> so<00:03:29.930> hornets<00:03:30.350> strike<00:03:30.560> barrel

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:32.330 
diffusion lethal torrent and of course

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:34.600 
diffusion lethal torrent and of course
like<00:03:32.690> i<00:03:32.750> said<00:03:32.960> the<00:03:33.140> pistol<00:03:33.470> ammo<00:03:33.830> then<00:03:34.430> when<00:03:34.580> i

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:34.610 
like i said the pistol ammo then when i

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:35.830 
like i said the pistol ammo then when i
go<00:03:34.730> ahead<00:03:34.970> and<00:03:35.060> we're<00:03:35.150> going<00:03:35.180> to<00:03:35.300> put<00:03:35.360> in<00:03:35.570> joel

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
with the scorch giving the radiation and

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.030 
with the scorch giving the radiation and
then<00:03:38.900> we're<00:03:38.990> going<00:03:39.080> to<00:03:39.170> do<00:03:39.320> the<00:03:39.500> pistol

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
then we're going to do the pistol

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.220 
then we're going to do the pistol
pestilence<00:03:40.520> with<00:03:40.730> the<00:03:40.850> Frostbite<00:03:41.420> and<00:03:41.630> that's

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
pestilence with the Frostbite and that's

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:43.510 
pestilence with the Frostbite and that's
going<00:03:42.380> to<00:03:42.440> give<00:03:42.530> me<00:03:42.710> my<00:03:42.890> viral<00:03:43.280> it's<00:03:43.430> also

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:43.520 
going to give me my viral it's also

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:44.860 
going to give me my viral it's also
going<00:03:43.730> to<00:03:43.790> give<00:03:43.910> me<00:03:43.970> an<00:03:44.240> eighty-six<00:03:44.810> percent

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
going to give me an eighty-six percent

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.810 
going to give me an eighty-six percent
rocking<00:03:45.800> chance<00:03:46.070> so<00:03:46.250> you've<00:03:46.370> got<00:03:46.400> one<00:03:46.610> hundred

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:46.820 
rocking chance so you've got one hundred

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:48.790 
rocking chance so you've got one hundred
percent<00:03:46.850> proc<00:03:47.330> on<00:03:47.480> the<00:03:47.570> electricity<00:03:48.200> you've

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:48.800 
percent proc on the electricity you've

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.670 
percent proc on the electricity you've
got<00:03:49.010> your<00:03:49.190> proc<00:03:49.490> inge<00:03:49.730> on<00:03:50.570> the<00:03:50.780> corrosive<00:03:51.350> when

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
got your proc inge on the corrosive when

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.080 
got your proc inge on the corrosive when
the<00:03:51.770> corrosive<00:03:52.250> shoots<00:03:52.459> off<00:03:52.670> from<00:03:52.940> the

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
the corrosive shoots off from the

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.690 
the corrosive shoots off from the
syndicate<00:03:53.510> mod<00:03:53.690> you<00:03:54.350> got<00:03:54.590> an<00:03:54.830> almost<00:03:55.310> ninety

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:55.700 
syndicate mod you got an almost ninety

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.940 
syndicate mod you got an almost ninety
percent<00:03:55.850> chance<00:03:56.390> to<00:03:56.630> proc<00:03:56.870> on<00:03:57.110> radiation<00:03:57.440> end

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
percent chance to proc on radiation end

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.100 
percent chance to proc on radiation end
on<00:03:58.340> viral<00:03:58.820> and<00:03:58.970> the<00:03:59.000> main<00:03:59.630> reason<00:03:59.959> I'm<00:04:00.050> using

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.110 
on viral and the main reason I'm using

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:02.590 
on viral and the main reason I'm using
frostbite<00:04:00.890> is<00:04:01.100> because<00:04:01.940> deep<00:04:02.120> freeze<00:04:02.360> only

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:02.600 
frostbite is because deep freeze only

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.870 
frostbite is because deep freeze only
offers<00:04:02.930> me<00:04:03.080> a<00:04:03.110> 60-percent<00:04:03.890> electra<00:04:04.310> extra

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:04.880 
offers me a 60-percent electra extra

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.180 
offers me a 60-percent electra extra
cold<00:04:05.300> damage<00:04:05.720> so<00:04:06.260> why<00:04:06.410> not<00:04:06.440> get<00:04:06.740> the<00:04:06.890> double

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
cold damage so why not get the double

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:09.520 
cold damage so why not get the double
and<00:04:07.400> increase<00:04:07.820> my<00:04:08.060> status<00:04:08.540> chance<00:04:08.900> and<00:04:09.440> of

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
and increase my status chance and of

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:10.780 
and increase my status chance and of
course<00:04:09.560> I've<00:04:09.830> got<00:04:09.950> a<00:04:09.980> higher<00:04:10.160> fire<00:04:10.459> rate<00:04:10.670> on

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:10.790 
course I've got a higher fire rate on

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:13.330 
course I've got a higher fire rate on
this<00:04:10.970> and<00:04:11.180> so<00:04:12.140> I<00:04:12.170> kept<00:04:12.470> just<00:04:12.800> like<00:04:12.920> that<00:04:13.070> that's

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340 
this and so I kept just like that that's

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.640 
this and so I kept just like that that's
it<00:04:13.490> you've<00:04:14.180> seen<00:04:14.390> in<00:04:14.540> a<00:04:14.630> couple<00:04:14.900> videos<00:04:14.930> I<00:04:15.410> have

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 
it you've seen in a couple videos I have

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:20.410 
it you've seen in a couple videos I have
run<00:04:16.190> it<00:04:16.340> everywhere<00:04:18.310> it's<00:04:19.310> fun<00:04:19.580> it's<00:04:19.880> perfect

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:20.420 
run it everywhere it's fun it's perfect

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:23.650 
run it everywhere it's fun it's perfect
for<00:04:20.480> me<00:04:20.720> and<00:04:21.260> that<00:04:21.530> that<00:04:22.100> much<00:04:22.400> better<00:04:22.910> though

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:23.660 
for me and that that much better though

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:26.560 
for me and that that much better though
in<00:04:23.990> terms<00:04:24.200> of<00:04:24.560> the<00:04:25.340> weapon<00:04:25.700> not<00:04:26.090> really<00:04:26.419> being

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:26.570 
in terms of the weapon not really being

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
in terms of the weapon not really being
that<00:04:26.660> significantly<00:04:27.530> better<00:04:27.740> than<00:04:28.130> the

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
that significantly better than the

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:30.320 
that significantly better than the
casana<00:04:29.280> so<00:04:29.610> if<00:04:29.700> you've<00:04:29.820> got<00:04:29.940> the<00:04:30.060> regular

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
casana so if you've got the regular

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.060 
casana so if you've got the regular
customers<00:04:30.780> you<00:04:31.290> can<00:04:31.320> do<00:04:31.680> this<00:04:31.830> the<00:04:31.890> only

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:32.070 
customers you can do this the only

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:33.470 
customers you can do this the only
difference<00:04:32.400> obviously<00:04:32.520> as<00:04:32.940> you<00:04:32.970> wouldn't<00:04:33.330> get

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:33.480 
difference obviously as you wouldn't get

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:36.950 
difference obviously as you wouldn't get
that<00:04:33.740> syndicate<00:04:34.910> corrosive<00:04:35.910> with<00:04:36.240> that

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
that syndicate corrosive with that

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.490 
that syndicate corrosive with that
status<00:04:37.650> chance<00:04:38.100> proc<00:04:38.400> on<00:04:38.670> it<00:04:38.850> as<00:04:39.000> well<00:04:39.180> but

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:39.500 
status chance proc on it as well but

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:44.030 
status chance proc on it as well but
overall<00:04:40.500> you<00:04:40.980> do<00:04:41.160> have<00:04:41.430> this<00:04:41.730> and<00:04:42.080> that's<00:04:43.080> just

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:44.040 
overall you do have this and that's just
