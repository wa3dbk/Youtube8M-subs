overthrow his Blake bortles would always

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.270 
overthrow his Blake bortles would always
under<00:01:47.700> throw<00:01:47.939> his<00:01:48.560> Johnny<00:01:49.560> Manziel<00:01:49.979> I<00:01:50.040> thought

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
under throw his Johnny Manziel I thought

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.940 
under throw his Johnny Manziel I thought
was<00:01:50.460> pretty<00:01:50.759> decent<00:01:51.360> pretty<00:01:51.570> solid<00:01:52.079> but<00:01:52.590> Derek

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
was pretty decent pretty solid but Derek

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.260 
was pretty decent pretty solid but Derek
Carr's<00:01:53.220> you're<00:01:53.490> seeing<00:01:53.759> here<00:01:53.909> with<00:01:54.060> some<00:01:54.180> of

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
Carr's you're seeing here with some of

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.330 
Carr's you're seeing here with some of
these<00:01:54.329> highlights<00:01:54.869> I<00:01:55.079> think<00:01:55.680> his<00:01:55.829> deep<00:01:56.100> ball

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
these highlights I think his deep ball

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.490 
these highlights I think his deep ball
is<00:01:56.520> just<00:01:56.640> his<00:01:57.149> accuracy<00:01:57.659> where<00:01:57.930> he<00:01:58.020> places<00:01:58.320> his

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
is just his accuracy where he places his

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.300 
is just his accuracy where he places his
ball<00:01:58.860> for<00:01:59.100> most<00:01:59.280> of<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.490> time<00:01:59.729> is<00:01:59.969> fairly<00:02:00.780> good

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
ball for most of the time is fairly good

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.719 
ball for most of the time is fairly good
so<00:02:02.310> I<00:02:02.899> think<00:02:03.899> you<00:02:04.259> know<00:02:04.290> Derek<00:02:04.829> Carr<00:02:05.040> his<00:02:05.340> deep

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
so I think you know Derek Carr his deep

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.449 
so I think you know Derek Carr his deep
ball<00:02:05.939> is<00:02:06.090> definitely<00:02:06.540> going<00:02:06.719> to<00:02:06.960> be<00:02:07.110> a<00:02:07.140> pro<00:02:07.649> his

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
ball is definitely going to be a pro his

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.520 
ball is definitely going to be a pro his
mobility<00:02:09.000> I<00:02:09.300> think<00:02:09.720> his<00:02:09.899> mobility<00:02:10.259> is

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
mobility I think his mobility is

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.780 
mobility I think his mobility is
definitely<00:02:10.979> a

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
definitely a

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.869 
definitely a
plus<00:02:12.480> he's<00:02:13.230> a<00:02:13.260> he's<00:02:13.590> a<00:02:13.620> pocket<00:02:14.129> passer<00:02:14.340> he's<00:02:14.849> a

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:14.879 
plus he's a he's a pocket passer he's a

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:16.849 
plus he's a he's a pocket passer he's a
guy<00:02:15.090> who<00:02:15.150> passes<00:02:15.780> the<00:02:15.900> ball<00:02:16.049> first<00:02:16.379> but<00:02:16.650> if<00:02:16.769> he

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:16.859 
guy who passes the ball first but if he

00:02:16.859 --> 00:02:18.619 
guy who passes the ball first but if he
needs<00:02:17.069> to<00:02:17.340> scramble<00:02:17.819> out<00:02:17.969> of<00:02:18.000> the<00:02:18.120> pocket<00:02:18.180> he

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:18.629 
needs to scramble out of the pocket he

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:20.929 
needs to scramble out of the pocket he
needs<00:02:18.870> to<00:02:19.049> make<00:02:19.230> a<00:02:19.260> play<00:02:19.560> on<00:02:19.590> his<00:02:19.950> legs<00:02:20.250> he<00:02:20.760> has

00:02:20.929 --> 00:02:20.939 
needs to make a play on his legs he has

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:22.699 
needs to make a play on his legs he has
the<00:02:21.120> speed<00:02:21.269> to<00:02:21.450> do<00:02:21.719> it<00:02:21.900> and<00:02:22.049> he's<00:02:22.469> definitely

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
the speed to do it and he's definitely

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.649 
the speed to do it and he's definitely
got<00:02:23.040> the<00:02:23.219> ability<00:02:23.489> to<00:02:23.849> do<00:02:23.969> it<00:02:24.120> so<00:02:24.480> I<00:02:24.510> think

00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:24.659 
got the ability to do it so I think

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:27.020 
got the ability to do it so I think
Derek<00:02:25.109> Carr<00:02:25.290> has<00:02:25.500> a<00:02:25.530> pro<00:02:26.099> in<00:02:26.280> that<00:02:26.430> aspect<00:02:26.760> now

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
Derek Carr has a pro in that aspect now

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.270 
Derek Carr has a pro in that aspect now
his<00:02:27.180> production<00:02:27.780> also<00:02:28.019> his<00:02:28.859> career<00:02:29.250> numbers

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
his production also his career numbers

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.119 
his production also his career numbers
as<00:02:29.760> we<00:02:29.939> just<00:02:30.180> highlighted<00:02:30.859> phenomenal<00:02:31.859> stuff

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:32.129 
as we just highlighted phenomenal stuff

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
and you're not going to see too many

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.289 
and you're not going to see too many

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:36.299 
quarterbacks who have a ratio and that

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:37.849 
quarterbacks who have a ratio and that

complete seasons and a little bit of you
know<00:02:44.819> him<00:02:45.090> and<00:02:45.269> in<00:02:45.450> his<00:02:45.629> in<00:02:45.870> his<00:02:45.900> first<00:02:46.230> season

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:47.780 
know him and in his in his first season
even<00:02:46.650> play<00:02:46.889> too<00:02:46.950> much<00:02:47.189> in<00:02:47.340> his<00:02:47.430> first<00:02:47.639> season

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:53.549 
numbers now some cons I think it's

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:56.179 
numbers now some cons I think it's
throwing<00:02:53.790> mechanics<00:02:54.209> I<00:02:54.709> couldn't<00:02:55.709> find<00:02:55.919> too

00:02:56.179 --> 00:02:56.189 
throwing mechanics I couldn't find too

00:02:56.189 --> 00:02:58.129 
throwing mechanics I couldn't find too
many<00:02:56.310> great<00:02:56.879> clips<00:02:57.269> to<00:02:57.419> show<00:02:57.599> you<00:02:57.659> guys<00:02:57.870> for

00:02:58.129 --> 00:02:58.139 
many great clips to show you guys for

00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:00.020 
many great clips to show you guys for
his<00:02:58.230> throwing<00:02:58.439> mechanics<00:02:58.799> but<00:02:59.430> I<00:02:59.459> felt<00:02:59.790> as<00:02:59.939> if

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
his throwing mechanics but I felt as if

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.690 
his throwing mechanics but I felt as if
it<00:03:00.239> was<00:03:00.359> more<00:03:00.540> of<00:03:00.569> a<00:03:00.720> three-fourths<00:03:01.700> throw

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
it was more of a three-fourths throw

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.860 
it was more of a three-fourths throw
than<00:03:03.120> a<00:03:03.389> complete<00:03:04.169> you<00:03:04.379> know<00:03:05.750> over<00:03:06.750> the

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
than a complete you know over the

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.920 
than a complete you know over the
shoulder<00:03:07.319> throw<00:03:07.620> if<00:03:08.609> it<00:03:08.970> was<00:03:09.180> more<00:03:09.450> towards

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
shoulder throw if it was more towards

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.750 
shoulder throw if it was more towards
you<00:03:10.109> know<00:03:10.230> a<00:03:10.260> complete<00:03:10.769> throw<00:03:11.099> than<00:03:11.310> his<00:03:11.489> hand

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
you know a complete throw than his hand

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.550 
you know a complete throw than his hand
would<00:03:11.849> be<00:03:12.030> would<00:03:12.599> be<00:03:12.629> more<00:03:12.930> closer<00:03:13.230> to<00:03:13.439> his

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
would be would be more closer to his

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.909 
would be would be more closer to his
helmet<00:03:13.980> instead<00:03:14.849> it's<00:03:15.329> a<00:03:15.540> three-fourths<00:03:16.530> and

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:16.919 
helmet instead it's a three-fourths and

00:03:16.919 --> 00:03:18.559 
helmet instead it's a three-fourths and
kind<00:03:17.519> of<00:03:17.609> a<00:03:17.669> little<00:03:17.849> bit<00:03:17.970> away<00:03:18.060> from<00:03:18.239> his

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:18.569 
kind of a little bit away from his

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:20.509 
kind of a little bit away from his
helmet<00:03:18.930> I'll<00:03:19.229> see<00:03:19.590> if<00:03:19.680> I<00:03:19.739> can<00:03:19.919> find<00:03:20.040> some<00:03:20.159> clips

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
helmet I'll see if I can find some clips

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:22.490 
helmet I'll see if I can find some clips
i<00:03:20.819> don't<00:03:21.299> know<00:03:21.359> if<00:03:21.389> i<00:03:21.510> can<00:03:21.569> find<00:03:21.840> too<00:03:22.079> many<00:03:22.199> good

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
i don't know if i can find too many good

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.170 
i don't know if i can find too many good
ones<00:03:22.650> now<00:03:23.190> throwing<00:03:23.489> on<00:03:23.729> the<00:03:23.760> run<00:03:24.000> is

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
ones now throwing on the run is

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.490 
ones now throwing on the run is
something<00:03:24.329> that<00:03:24.629> I<00:03:24.690> noticed<00:03:25.079> when<00:03:25.169> he<00:03:25.229> have<00:03:25.379> to

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
something that I noticed when he have to

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.439 
something that I noticed when he have to
scramble<00:03:25.859> he<00:03:26.220> wouldn't<00:03:26.489> you<00:03:26.699> know<00:03:26.819> run<00:03:27.060> out<00:03:27.150> in

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:27.449 
scramble he wouldn't you know run out in

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:30.559 
scramble he wouldn't you know run out in
a<00:03:27.599> run<00:03:27.829> run<00:03:28.829> with<00:03:28.859> the<00:03:29.069> ball<00:03:29.220> excuse<00:03:29.849> me<00:03:30.000> but

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:30.569 
a run run with the ball excuse me but

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:33.439 
a run run with the ball excuse me but
when<00:03:30.900> he<00:03:30.989> had<00:03:31.079> to<00:03:31.229> throw<00:03:31.260> on<00:03:31.739> the<00:03:31.949> run<00:03:32.449> his

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:33.449 
when he had to throw on the run his

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:35.030 
when he had to throw on the run his
accuracy<00:03:33.930> wasn't<00:03:34.290> too<00:03:34.409> hot<00:03:34.590> you<00:03:34.949> know

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
accuracy wasn't too hot you know

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.349 
accuracy wasn't too hot you know
especially<00:03:35.729> when<00:03:35.790> he<00:03:35.879> was<00:03:35.970> throwing<00:03:36.120> away

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:36.359 
especially when he was throwing away

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:37.839 
especially when he was throwing away
from<00:03:36.569> his<00:03:36.690> body<00:03:36.720> I<00:03:37.049> noticed<00:03:37.440> a<00:03:37.500> lot<00:03:37.650> of

00:03:37.839 --> 00:03:37.849 
from his body I noticed a lot of

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:41.059 
from his body I noticed a lot of
inaccurate<00:03:38.849> throws<00:03:39.209> so<00:03:39.959> I<00:03:39.989> think<00:03:40.409> he's<00:03:40.829> more

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:41.069 
inaccurate throws so I think he's more

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:43.009 
inaccurate throws so I think he's more
primarily<00:03:41.609> that<00:03:41.819> pocket<00:03:42.269> passer<00:03:42.659> if<00:03:42.720> he<00:03:42.810> gets

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
primarily that pocket passer if he gets

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:44.479 
primarily that pocket passer if he gets
rolled<00:03:43.260> out<00:03:43.440> to<00:03:43.470> the<00:03:43.590> left<00:03:43.859> or<00:03:44.010> right<00:03:44.040> his

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
rolled out to the left or right his

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:46.520 
rolled out to the left or right his
accuracy<00:03:44.940> is<00:03:45.120> going<00:03:45.299> to<00:03:45.359> get<00:03:45.479> downgraded<00:03:45.720> the

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
accuracy is going to get downgraded the

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.670 
accuracy is going to get downgraded the
royal<00:03:46.829> purple<00:03:47.159> las<00:03:47.489> vegas<00:03:47.940> bowl<00:03:48.440> long<00:03:49.440> name

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 
there the las vegas bowl i think was

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:53.869

probably<00:03:52.560> one<00:03:53.040> of<00:03:53.069> his<00:03:53.250> worst<00:03:53.459> games<00:03:53.760> i

00:03:53.869 --> 00:03:53.879 
probably one of his worst games i

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:56.990 
probably one of his worst games i
watched<00:03:54.090> off<00:03:54.840> of<00:03:55.079> his<00:03:55.199> 2013<00:03:55.859> tape<00:03:56.129> it<00:03:56.849> was<00:03:56.939> a

00:03:59.659 --> 00:03:59.669 
USC team that was ranked as well if you

00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:01.009
