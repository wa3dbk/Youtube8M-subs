pressure<00:01:19.120> is<00:01:19.390> coming<00:01:19.570> make<00:01:20.320> sure<00:01:20.350> those

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
pressure is coming make sure those

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.260 
pressure is coming make sure those
outside<00:01:20.980> DBS<00:01:21.400> are<00:01:21.670> fast<00:01:22.210> and<00:01:23.820> this<00:01:24.820> defense

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
outside DBS are fast and this defense

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.260 
outside DBS are fast and this defense
will<00:01:25.690> shut<00:01:26.140> down<00:01:26.170> every<00:01:27.100> rocket<00:01:27.490> catch<00:01:27.700> the

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
will shut down every rocket catch the

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.010 
will shut down every rocket catch the
point<00:01:28.540> is<00:01:30.000> you're<00:01:31.000> pressing<00:01:31.300> both<00:01:31.570> outside

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 
point is you're pressing both outside

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.430 
point is you're pressing both outside
receivers<00:01:32.560> so<00:01:33.100> that<00:01:33.940> leaves<00:01:34.240> less<00:01:35.080> time<00:01:35.410> for

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:35.440 
receivers so that leaves less time for

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.560 
receivers so that leaves less time for
them<00:01:36.010> to<00:01:36.040> rocket<00:01:36.490> ketchup<00:01:36.850> and<00:01:36.970> on<00:01:37.060> time<00:01:37.330> then

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570 
them to rocket ketchup and on time then

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:49.220 
them to rocket ketchup and on time then
I<00:01:37.630> can<00:01:37.780> build<00:01:37.930> rocket<00:01:38.260> kids
