really<00:02:45.450> thin<00:02:45.690> and<00:02:45.720> it<00:02:45.930> tends<00:02:46.200> to<00:02:46.319> curl<00:02:46.709> but

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
really thin and it tends to curl but

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:55.690 
really thin and it tends to curl but
guess<00:02:47.100> what<00:02:47.280> that<00:02:47.340> is<00:02:47.640> not<00:02:48.060> a<00:02:48.360> problem<00:02:48.720> for<00:02:49.560> us

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
use my glitter as much for that so I

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:36.259 
use my glitter as much for that so I
still<00:03:35.489> have<00:03:35.640> them<00:03:35.760> in<00:03:35.880> the<00:03:35.970> original

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:46.139 
in this is really fun actually making

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:51.680 
in this is really fun actually making
sure<00:03:46.440> that<00:03:46.650> you<00:03:46.769> get<00:03:46.889> that<00:03:47.100> initial<00:03:50.540> layer<00:03:51.540> of
