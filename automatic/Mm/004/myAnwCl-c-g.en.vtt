nomicon were changed in this patch with
the<00:00:51.950> old<00:00:52.310> system<00:00:52.520> they<00:00:52.880> both<00:00:53.120> gave<00:00:53.390> 10<00:00:53.690> mana

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:53.900 
the old system they both gave 10 mana

different<00:01:23.299> one<00:01:23.450> now<00:01:23.479> on<00:01:23.899> patch<00:01:24.170> 4.20<00:01:24.889> the<00:01:25.310> key

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
different one now on patch 4.20 the key

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.219 
different one now on patch 4.20 the key
difference<00:01:25.909> here<00:01:25.969> is<00:01:26.359> that<00:01:26.389> in<00:01:26.899> the<00:01:27.020> past

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229 
difference here is that in the past

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:29.499 
difference here is that in the past
unholy<00:01:28.009> Grail<00:01:28.310> was<00:01:28.549> a<00:01:28.579> better<00:01:28.880> purchase<00:01:29.329> most

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:29.509 
unholy Grail was a better purchase most

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:30.969 
unholy Grail was a better purchase most
of<00:01:29.719> the<00:01:29.810> time<00:01:30.020> because<00:01:30.229> it<00:01:30.469> was<00:01:30.560> vastly

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 
of the time because it was vastly

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:33.309 
of the time because it was vastly
superior<00:01:31.249> for<00:01:31.909> your<00:01:32.030> mana<00:01:32.209> pool<00:01:32.329> while<00:01:33.049> it's

00:01:33.309 --> 00:01:33.319 
superior for your mana pool while it's

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:35.050 
superior for your mana pool while it's
still<00:01:33.590> an<00:01:33.770> important<00:01:34.159> item<00:01:34.429> on<00:01:34.609> champions
