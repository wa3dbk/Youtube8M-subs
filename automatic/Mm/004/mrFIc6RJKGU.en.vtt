00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:08.830 
going into turn three any eye Hey it
really<00:02:07.220> depends<00:02:07.759> on<00:02:07.850> who's<00:02:08.030> running<00:02:08.239> third<00:02:08.660> at

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
really depends on who's running third at

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.770 
really depends on who's running third at
this<00:02:08.989> point<00:02:09.200> I<00:02:09.350> think<00:02:09.410> if<00:02:10.039> the<00:02:10.280> two<00:02:10.780> Ganassi

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
this point I think if the two Ganassi

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.660 
this point I think if the two Ganassi
cars<00:02:12.050> keep<00:02:12.410> playing<00:02:12.709> nice<00:02:13.069> with<00:02:13.100> each<00:02:13.370> other

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
cars keep playing nice with each other

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:14.770 
cars keep playing nice with each other
up<00:02:13.910> to<00:02:14.090> the<00:02:14.209> end

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
up to the end

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.050 
up to the end
they're<00:02:15.110> guarding<00:02:15.680> the<00:02:15.830> position<00:02:16.340> so<00:02:16.580> maybe

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
they're guarding the position so maybe

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.580 
they're guarding the position so maybe
like<00:02:17.330> she<00:02:17.570> said<00:02:17.810> you'd<00:02:17.930> be<00:02:17.960> better<00:02:18.170> off<00:02:18.290> if

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
like she said you'd be better off if

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.140 
like she said you'd be better off if
you're<00:02:18.770> leading<00:02:18.950> that<00:02:19.130> last<00:02:19.400> left<00:02:19.640> now<00:02:20.000> he's

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
you're leading that last left now he's

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:21.820 
you're leading that last left now he's
going<00:02:20.330> to<00:02:20.420> pass<00:02:20.570> him<00:02:20.600> again<00:02:21.020> and<00:02:21.230> it's<00:02:21.410> a<00:02:21.500> clean

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
going to pass him again and it's a clean

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:23.830 
going to pass him again and it's a clean
pass<00:02:22.100> and<00:02:22.790> does<00:02:22.940> he<00:02:23.060> get<00:02:23.210> him<00:02:23.300> by<00:02:23.420> the<00:02:23.450> strut

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
pass and does he get him by the strut

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.740 
pass and does he get him by the strut
yes<00:02:24.170> he<00:02:24.320> does<00:02:24.530> so<00:02:24.740> it<00:02:24.890> can<00:02:25.160> be<00:02:25.430> done<00:02:25.640> but<00:02:26.420> sure

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
yes he does so it can be done but sure
