00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.910 

I<00:00:00.089> think<00:00:00.390> the<00:00:00.480> film<00:00:00.870> catches<00:00:01.500> a<00:00:01.560> lot<00:00:01.650> of<00:00:01.709> people

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:01.920 
I think the film catches a lot of people

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:03.919 
I think the film catches a lot of people
off-guard<00:00:02.070> because<00:00:02.460> when<00:00:03.360> you<00:00:03.510> read<00:00:03.689> about<00:00:03.720> it

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:03.929 
off-guard because when you read about it

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:04.999 
off-guard because when you read about it
you<00:00:04.049> think<00:00:04.200> it's<00:00:04.319> gonna<00:00:04.440> be<00:00:04.560> about<00:00:04.710> a<00:00:04.770> strip

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
you think it's gonna be about a strip

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:06.530 
you think it's gonna be about a strip
club<00:00:05.130> but<00:00:05.430> it's<00:00:05.549> really<00:00:05.700> not<00:00:05.910> it's<00:00:06.180> about<00:00:06.270> my

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
club but it's really not it's about my

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.810 
club but it's really not it's about my
parents<00:00:06.870> relationship<00:00:07.049> I<00:00:07.620> narrate<00:00:08.460> the<00:00:08.580> film

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
parents relationship I narrate the film

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.390 
parents relationship I narrate the film
and<00:00:09.150> I<00:00:09.240> kind<00:00:09.480> of<00:00:09.570> I'm<00:00:10.050> essentially<00:00:10.980> I<00:00:11.099> think<00:00:11.160> a

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
and I kind of I'm essentially I think a

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.310 
and I kind of I'm essentially I think a
secondary<00:00:11.820> character<00:00:12.240> but<00:00:12.450> the<00:00:12.990> film<00:00:13.200> is

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
secondary character but the film is

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.930 
secondary character but the film is
about<00:00:13.410> their<00:00:13.679> relationship<00:00:14.190> the<00:00:14.460> strip<00:00:14.730> club

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
about their relationship the strip club

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.820 
about their relationship the strip club
my<00:00:15.089> brother<00:00:15.360> myself<00:00:15.870> is<00:00:16.080> just<00:00:16.109> a<00:00:16.320> dimension<00:00:16.770> of

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
my brother myself is just a dimension of

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.060 
my brother myself is just a dimension of
that<00:00:17.930> yeah<00:00:18.930> so<00:00:19.199> it's<00:00:19.410> very<00:00:19.470> much<00:00:19.590> about<00:00:19.740> their

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
that yeah so it's very much about their

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.490 
that yeah so it's very much about their
addictions<00:00:20.550> and<00:00:20.910> and<00:00:21.630> what's<00:00:22.140> your<00:00:22.289> father

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
addictions and and what's your father

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.349 
addictions and and what's your father
addicted<00:00:22.980> to<00:00:23.100> my<00:00:23.519> father<00:00:23.730> to<00:00:23.970> get<00:00:24.090> to<00:00:24.210> to

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
addicted to my father to get to to

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.810 
addicted to my father to get to to
eating<00:00:24.840> a<00:00:24.900> lot<00:00:25.050> of<00:00:25.080> food<00:00:25.380> and<00:00:25.859> I<00:00:25.980> think<00:00:26.250> it's

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
eating a lot of food and I think it's

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.700 
eating a lot of food and I think it's
amazing<00:00:27.420> that<00:00:27.539> he's<00:00:27.689> 400<00:00:27.960> pounds<00:00:28.529> and<00:00:28.650> my

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
amazing that he's 400 pounds and my

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.099 
amazing that he's 400 pounds and my
mother<00:00:28.920> is<00:00:29.070> 85<00:00:29.490> pounds<00:00:30.090> and<00:00:30.630> I<00:00:30.720> found<00:00:30.960> that

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
mother is 85 pounds and I found that

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.799 
mother is 85 pounds and I found that
juxtaposition<00:00:31.439> being<00:00:32.219> quite<00:00:33.090> fascinating

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
juxtaposition being quite fascinating

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:34.940 
juxtaposition being quite fascinating
because<00:00:33.840> they<00:00:34.170> work<00:00:34.320> in<00:00:34.469> a<00:00:34.559> business<00:00:34.710> that's

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
because they work in a business that's

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.450 
because they work in a business that's
all<00:00:35.130> based<00:00:35.399> on<00:00:35.550> image<00:00:35.910> so<00:00:36.710> yeah<00:00:37.710> I<00:00:37.739> found<00:00:38.250> that

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
all based on image so yeah I found that

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.819 
all based on image so yeah I found that
the<00:00:39.210> irony<00:00:39.570> to<00:00:39.660> be<00:00:39.750> incredible<00:00:40.170> I<00:00:40.320> think<00:00:40.590> a<00:00:40.649> lot

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
the irony to be incredible I think a lot

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:41.990 
the irony to be incredible I think a lot
of<00:00:40.920> that<00:00:41.010> has<00:00:41.100> to<00:00:41.129> do<00:00:41.250> with<00:00:41.309> my<00:00:41.460> mother<00:00:41.670> feeding

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
of that has to do with my mother feeding

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.250 
of that has to do with my mother feeding
him<00:00:42.210> I<00:00:42.360> mean<00:00:42.510> it<00:00:42.629> sounds<00:00:42.840> ridiculous<00:00:43.230> but

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
him I mean it sounds ridiculous but

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.440 
him I mean it sounds ridiculous but
while<00:00:43.559> I<00:00:43.590> was<00:00:43.739> shooting<00:00:44.070> it<00:00:44.160> I<00:00:44.430> stayed<00:00:45.180> with<00:00:45.420> my

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
while I was shooting it I stayed with my

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.850 
while I was shooting it I stayed with my
parents<00:00:45.600> for<00:00:46.079> a<00:00:46.140> little<00:00:46.350> while<00:00:46.440> for<00:00:46.620> a<00:00:46.680> few

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
parents for a little while for a few

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.020 
parents for a little while for a few
months<00:00:47.129> in<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.250> house<00:00:47.430> because<00:00:47.640> it's<00:00:47.820> an<00:00:47.910> hour

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
months in the house because it's an hour

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.180 
months in the house because it's an hour
away<00:00:48.239> from<00:00:48.270> here<00:00:48.539> and<00:00:48.980> what<00:00:49.980> I<00:00:50.010> found

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
away from here and what I found

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.950 
away from here and what I found
fascinating<00:00:50.460> with<00:00:51.030> her<00:00:51.149> disorder<00:00:51.570> is<00:00:51.690> how

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
fascinating with her disorder is how

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.319 
fascinating with her disorder is how
many<00:00:52.140> times<00:00:52.350> she<00:00:52.559> wanted<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:52.860> feed<00:00:53.070> me<00:00:53.280> and<00:00:53.969> it

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
many times she wanted to feed me and it

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:55.670 
many times she wanted to feed me and it
got<00:00:54.449> kind<00:00:54.600> of<00:00:54.719> frustrating<00:00:55.199> to<00:00:55.379> tell<00:00:55.530> you<00:00:55.590> the

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
got kind of frustrating to tell you the

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.319 
got kind of frustrating to tell you the
truth<00:00:55.890> so<00:00:56.190> so<00:00:56.430> many<00:00:56.579> times<00:00:56.789> she'd<00:00:56.940> come<00:00:57.090> up<00:00:57.210> to

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
truth so so many times she'd come up to

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.020 
truth so so many times she'd come up to
me<00:00:57.449> and<00:00:57.809> I<00:00:58.800> just<00:00:58.949> be<00:00:59.070> watching<00:00:59.190> TV<00:00:59.430> or<00:00:59.730> editing

or<00:01:00.120> doing<00:01:00.329> something<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:00.840> she'd<00:01:01.020> be<00:01:01.109> handing

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
or doing something and she'd be handing

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.560 
or doing something and she'd be handing
me<00:01:01.530> food<00:01:01.739> all<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.010> time<00:01:02.190> and<00:01:02.460> every<00:01:03.300> 20

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
some type of sense of control and I

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.980 
some type of sense of control and I
think<00:02:09.470> this<00:02:10.100> disorder<00:02:10.580> is<00:02:10.610> exactly<00:02:11.360> that<00:02:11.570> so<00:02:11.959> I

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
think this disorder is exactly that so I

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:13.480 
think this disorder is exactly that so I
think<00:02:12.110> it<00:02:12.410> may<00:02:12.560> be<00:02:12.590> she's<00:02:13.040> using<00:02:13.250> it<00:02:13.430> to

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
think it may be she's using it to

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:14.920 
think it may be she's using it to
control<00:02:13.730> my<00:02:14.000> father<00:02:14.240> a<00:02:14.360> little<00:02:14.420> bit<00:02:14.660> what<00:02:14.840> did

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
control my father a little bit what did

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.449 
control my father a little bit what did
