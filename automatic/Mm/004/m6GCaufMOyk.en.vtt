00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:39.829 
stats and I will be reading that every

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:41.440 
stats and I will be reading that every
single<00:01:40.009> state<00:01:40.279> in<00:01:40.340> pattern<00:01:40.969> as<00:01:41.090> is<00:01:41.209> quite<00:01:41.420> a

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
single state in pattern as is quite a

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.300 
single state in pattern as is quite a
lot<00:01:41.689> while<00:01:42.259> just<00:01:42.439> booing<00:01:42.770> the<00:01:42.950> slats<00:01:43.189> with

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
lot while just booing the slats with

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.580 
lot while just booing the slats with
standard<00:01:43.609> form<00:01:43.729> in<00:01:43.819> a<00:01:43.909> most<00:01:44.149> in<00:01:44.450> game<00:01:44.659> so<00:01:45.439> this

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
standard form in a most in game so this

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.019

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
plastic interceptions by the time she

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.250 
plastic interceptions by the time she
has<00:02:28.730> been<00:02:28.940> caught<00:02:29.150> up<00:02:29.390> and<00:02:29.629> has<00:02:29.810> had<00:02:30.019> many

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
has been caught up and has had many

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.170 
has been caught up and has had many
opportunities<00:02:30.590> to<00:02:31.250> intercept<00:02:32.060> the<00:02:32.150> ball

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
opportunities to intercept the ball

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.390 
opportunities to intercept the ball
while<00:02:33.079> he<00:02:33.200> just<00:02:33.440> stood<00:02:33.650> there<00:02:33.920> and<00:02:34.040> is<00:02:34.190> allowed

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
while he just stood there and is allowed

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.580 
while he just stood there and is allowed
to<00:02:34.430> tackle<00:02:34.849> to<00:02:34.940> passing<00:02:35.299> at<00:02:35.390> ease<00:02:35.659> which<00:02:36.470> is

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
to tackle to passing at ease which is

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.170 
to tackle to passing at ease which is
not<00:02:36.709> really<00:02:36.769> what<00:02:37.190> you<00:02:37.340> want<00:02:37.549> from<00:02:37.700> defender

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
not really what you want from defender

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.360 
not really what you want from defender
at<00:02:38.269> all<00:02:38.480> but<00:02:39.470> so<00:02:39.650> overall<00:02:40.069> I<00:02:40.189> would<00:02:40.250> say

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
at all but so overall I would say

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.399 
at all but so overall I would say
intelligence<00:02:41.239> interceptions<00:02:41.959> is<00:02:42.170> a<00:02:42.200> bit

00:02:42.399 --> 00:02:42.409 
intelligence interceptions is a bit

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:44.649 
intelligence interceptions is a bit
neater<00:02:42.560> miss<00:02:42.859> really<00:02:43.250> at<00:02:43.760> times<00:02:44.060> it<00:02:44.269> performs

00:02:44.649 --> 00:02:44.659 
neater miss really at times it performs

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:46.479 
neater miss really at times it performs
on<00:02:44.780> gray<00:02:44.930> interceptions<00:02:45.560> and<00:02:45.829> time<00:02:46.280> than

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:46.489 
on gray interceptions and time than

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:48.460 
on gray interceptions and time than
world<00:02:46.700> and<00:02:47.329> other<00:02:47.480> times<00:02:47.810> he'll<00:02:48.049> just<00:02:48.260> stand

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
world and other times he'll just stand

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.140 
world and other times he'll just stand
there<00:02:48.680> and<00:02:48.920> let<00:02:49.190> the<00:02:49.340> attack<00:02:49.459> of<00:02:49.760> passing

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
there and let the attack of passing

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:51.849 
there and let the attack of passing
movies<00:02:50.450> that<00:02:50.690> without<00:02:50.900> even<00:02:51.230> attempting<00:02:51.349> to

movies that without even attempting to

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:54.039 
movies that without even attempting to
intercept<00:02:52.159> the<00:02:52.400> ball<00:02:52.430> at<00:02:52.700> all<00:02:52.909> I<00:02:53.180> sliding

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
tackles on the other hand is his best

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:57.879 
tackles on the other hand is his best
attribute<00:02:56.060> of<00:02:56.209> him<00:02:56.450> what<00:02:57.200> actually<00:02:57.590> mean<00:02:57.739> by

enough<00:03:12.470> time<00:03:12.680> for<00:03:12.739> him<00:03:13.129> to<00:03:13.159> get<00:03:13.340> the<00:03:13.459> ball

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:13.609 
enough time for him to get the ball

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:15.069 
enough time for him to get the ball
without<00:03:13.790> filing<00:03:14.150> their<00:03:14.420> opponents<00:03:14.930> and

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:15.079 
without filing their opponents and

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:16.750 
without filing their opponents and
that's<00:03:15.590> exactly<00:03:15.769> what<00:03:16.220> you<00:03:16.340> want<00:03:16.519> from<00:03:16.609> a

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
that's exactly what you want from a

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.360 
that's exactly what you want from a
melee<00:03:17.150> is<00:03:17.599> Stanley<00:03:18.139> tap<00:03:18.319> on<00:03:18.500> your<00:03:18.530> van<00:03:18.889> is<00:03:18.919> not

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
melee is Stanley tap on your van is not

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:21.159 
melee is Stanley tap on your van is not
as<00:03:19.579> consistent<00:03:20.239> and<00:03:20.419> good<00:03:20.660> as<00:03:20.870> its<00:03:21.109> of

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:21.169 
as consistent and good as its of

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:23.470 
as consistent and good as its of
attributes<00:03:21.709> but<00:03:22.459> at<00:03:22.609> times<00:03:22.819> for<00:03:23.060> me<00:03:23.150> has<00:03:23.269> made

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
attributes but at times for me has made

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.050 
attributes but at times for me has made
some<00:03:23.720> fantastic<00:03:24.349> standing<00:03:24.739> tackles<00:03:25.160> but<00:03:25.879> I'll

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
some fantastic standing tackles but I'll

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.119 
some fantastic standing tackles but I'll
savor<00:03:26.359> is<00:03:26.540> much<00:03:26.750> better<00:03:27.019> his<00:03:27.349> slide<00:03:27.620> time<00:03:27.919> so

00:03:28.119 --> 00:03:28.129 
savor is much better his slide time so

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:30.460 
savor is much better his slide time so
sure<00:03:28.370> simply<00:03:29.359> because<00:03:29.480> if<00:03:29.750> his<00:03:29.870> consistency

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
sure simply because if his consistency

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.220 
sure simply because if his consistency
and<00:03:30.829> timing<00:03:31.400> then<00:03:31.579> doing<00:03:31.930> one<00:03:32.930> thing<00:03:32.959> I

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
and timing then doing one thing I

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.140 
and timing then doing one thing I
noticed<00:03:33.650> when<00:03:33.769> I<00:03:33.829> was<00:03:34.040> performing<00:03:34.549> standing

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
noticed when I was performing standing

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.509 
noticed when I was performing standing
tackles<00:03:35.540> but<00:03:36.349> his<00:03:36.500> timing<00:03:36.799> was<00:03:36.949> so<00:03:37.220> bad<00:03:37.489> that

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:37.519 
tackles but his timing was so bad that

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:39.430 
tackles but his timing was so bad that
most<00:03:38.030> of<00:03:38.120> time<00:03:38.299> he<00:03:38.449> was<00:03:38.569> just<00:03:38.690> stand<00:03:38.989> there<00:03:39.109> an

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440 
most of time he was just stand there an

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.710 
most of time he was just stand there an
actual<00:03:40.129> attack<00:03:40.519> will<00:03:40.730> get<00:03:40.910> past<00:03:41.150> it<00:03:41.419> then<00:03:41.599> you

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
actual attack will get past it then you

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.809 
actual attack will get past it then you
eventually<00:03:42.049> a<00:03:42.530> temple<00:03:42.919> sliding<00:03:43.310> temple<00:03:43.669> and

00:03:43.809 --> 00:03:43.819 
eventually a temple sliding temple and

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:45.610 
eventually a temple sliding temple and
he<00:03:43.849> performing<00:03:44.569> this<00:03:44.660> standard<00:03:45.049> cycles<00:03:45.379> so

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
he performing this standard cycles so

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.470 
he performing this standard cycles so
late<00:03:45.889> but<00:03:46.129> it<00:03:46.280> just<00:03:46.430> clearly<00:03:46.790> showed<00:03:47.090> up<00:03:47.269> and

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
late but it just clearly showed up and

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.839 
late but it just clearly showed up and
it<00:03:47.599> was<00:03:47.720> a<00:03:47.750> very<00:03:47.810> bad<00:03:48.169> sign<00:03:48.410> for<00:03:48.470> me<00:03:48.769> but<00:03:49.579> if<00:03:49.730> I

00:03:49.839 --> 00:03:49.849 
it was a very bad sign for me but if I

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:51.670 
it was a very bad sign for me but if I
performed<00:03:50.269> the<00:03:50.359> sliding<00:03:50.780> tackle<00:03:51.109> instead<00:03:51.440> I

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
performed the sliding tackle instead I

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.170 
performed the sliding tackle instead I
was<00:03:52.129> struggling<00:03:52.340> to<00:03:52.459> believe<00:03:52.730> that<00:03:52.970> I<00:03:53.000> would

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
was struggling to believe that I would

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:54.490 
was struggling to believe that I would
have<00:03:53.329> had<00:03:53.449> a<00:03:53.480> higher<00:03:53.690> chance<00:03:53.720> of<00:03:54.169> getting<00:03:54.409> the

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
have had a higher chance of getting the

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:55.659 
have had a higher chance of getting the
ball<00:03:54.530> Benny<00:03:54.919> if<00:03:55.040> I<00:03:55.099> just<00:03:55.310> performed<00:03:55.400> a

00:03:55.659 --> 00:03:55.669 
ball Benny if I just performed a

00:03:55.669 --> 00:03:57.610 
ball Benny if I just performed a
standing<00:03:55.849> tackle<00:03:56.180> which<00:03:56.900> is<00:03:57.049> a<00:03:57.079> shame<00:03:57.169> for<00:03:57.560> me

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
standing tackle which is a shame for me

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.379 
standing tackle which is a shame for me

as his interceptions and standing cycle

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:01.240 
as his interceptions and standing cycle

me not too strong or too weak just in
the<00:04:17.329> middle<00:04:17.449> just<00:04:17.720> perfect<00:04:18.229> just<00:04:18.440> enough<00:04:18.650> for

the middle just perfect just enough for

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:21.109 
it to be not a disadvantage

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:22.990 
it to be not a disadvantage
now<00:04:21.259> also<00:04:21.469> noticed<00:04:22.009> David<00:04:22.340> Louisa<00:04:22.639> pate<00:04:22.939> is

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.000 
now also noticed David Louisa pate is

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.059 
now also noticed David Louisa pate is
not<00:04:23.300> the<00:04:23.389> best<00:04:23.539> diver<00:04:24.069> especially

00:04:25.059 --> 00:04:25.069 
not the best diver especially

00:04:25.069 --> 00:04:27.010 
not the best diver especially
considering<00:04:25.400> his<00:04:25.669> own<00:04:25.789> card<00:04:26.060> stats<00:04:26.419> lines<00:04:26.810> of

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
considering his own card stats lines of

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:28.869 
considering his own card stats lines of
dead<00:04:27.199> a<00:04:27.229> and<00:04:27.590> I<00:04:27.650> was<00:04:27.770> much<00:04:27.979> faster<00:04:28.219> and<00:04:28.639> also

00:04:28.869 --> 00:04:28.879 
dead a and I was much faster and also

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:31.119 
dead a and I was much faster and also
better<00:04:29.270> at<00:04:29.479> all<00:04:29.719> also<00:04:30.469> as<00:04:30.560> positioning<00:04:30.979> is<00:04:31.099> a

00:04:31.119 --> 00:04:31.129 
better at all also as positioning is a

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:33.129 
better at all also as positioning is a
bit<00:04:31.310> hit<00:04:31.430> and<00:04:31.460> miss<00:04:31.639> as<00:04:31.849> well<00:04:32.060> and<00:04:32.719> i<00:04:32.810> believe

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:33.139 
bit hit and miss as well and i believe

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:34.719 
bit hit and miss as well and i believe
is<00:04:33.289> because<00:04:33.650> it<00:04:33.770> was<00:04:33.889> high<00:04:34.069> attacking<00:04:34.520> work

00:04:34.719 --> 00:04:34.729 
is because it was high attacking work

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:36.159 
is because it was high attacking work
weight<00:04:34.969> because<00:04:35.330> he<00:04:35.419> only<00:04:35.539> as<00:04:35.659> a<00:04:35.689> hijacking

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:36.169 
weight because he only as a hijacking

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:38.379 
weight because he only as a hijacking
work<00:04:36.439> to<00:04:36.650> it<00:04:36.830> and<00:04:37.039> medium<00:04:37.789> defensive<00:04:38.210> work
