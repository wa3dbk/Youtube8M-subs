 There is a soft sense of this is I third place follower Tteyuu Waan When the movement of the center of gravity is not well 

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:55.610
 Because it tends to drop in the middle 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:01:00.200

 It may be a little more complicated, but while sliding the upper body 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:49.390
 I will also move the center of gravity stretch and drop 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:52.870
 The drop in growth is 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:59.200
 Fire posture that is said to stretch 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:03:00.430
