00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:05.810
 well we have is a video of supplements 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:14.510
 well today we are going to make a video of 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:16.190
 supplements thanks to this user that 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:18.050
 gave me the idea which supplements to take 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:20.449
 when we do weights or when we do 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.340
 exercise there are two supplements very 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:24.679
 important that we can take one of 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:27.619
 they should take that is the shake of 

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:29.779
 proteins the muscles need fast 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:31.310
 recovery materials and what better 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:35.720
 that a protein shake that simply 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:37.940
 with shaking it in a beater glass or if 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.649
 we have a blender within the hour 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.680
 of exercise we can also do it and 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:44.390
 has a very fast digestion this type 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.190
 of smoothies with which will serve us 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.280
 quite another supplement that we can 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:51.079
 take before exercise is creatine 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.940
 there is a video of the creatine that I have 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:55.250
 but that they can look if we do not consume 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:58.070
 many vegetables or many fruits 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.589
 It would be convenient to buy some complex 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:03.170
 vitamin that has all the vitamins 

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:05.180
 and all the minerals that we need 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.820
 per day he tries that they do not have the 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.650
 amounts that we need in some or 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.010
 in others with which we should eat 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:14.010
 some kind of fruit and vegetables 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.950
 more of it but good if we do not get 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.440
 neither fruit nor vegetable all help and it would be 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.270
 good apart are over-the-counter 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.550
 generally another supplement that we can 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:27.180
 use and that I use personally is 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:29.520
 effervescent vitamin c that they say here 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.770
 network are are I do not know if in other countries well 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.780
 and I think I have a video if I have a 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.410
 video is effectively from them and this one 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:41.010
 repsol comes with a gram of vitamin c 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:43.560
 that is a thousand milligrams and they also come with 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:46.260
 a little zinc that does not come at all 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.300
 bad because remember that zinc helps 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:50.520
 to the production of testosterone every 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:53.220
 which we add besides helping us 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.930
 it also costs money so it's in 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.060
 the possibilities of each one find 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.770
 one or the other if you 're wanting to go down 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.510
 the belly and you want to buy a burner 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.520
 of fat remember that you can use it 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.470
 for 30 days but then you have to 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.030
 let the body rest you do not light all 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:09.420
 the months because you're going to find out 'your 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:12.000
 organism and I will be very bad once 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.010
 every six months there would be no problem 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.290
 also always remember to consult 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.720
 to the doctor to consume any type 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.250
 of supplements good provision of 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.660
 videogame suggest to that nadal and me 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.099
 like to share it on facebook on twitter 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.540
 and all the things that are done with 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:25.140
 excellent manliness see you in the 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.920

 until next time 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:40.150

 muscular if they are three pillars three 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.690
 very important pillars
