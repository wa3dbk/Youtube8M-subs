00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.850 

today<00:00:21.850> is<00:00:22.150> really<00:00:22.600> about<00:00:22.840> introducing<00:00:23.410> a<00:00:23.710> lot

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:23.860 
today is really about introducing a lot

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:25.589 
today is really about introducing a lot
of<00:00:23.950> kids<00:00:24.190> to<00:00:24.430> rugby<00:00:25.000> I<00:00:25.029> think<00:00:25.270> this<00:00:25.510> is

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:25.599 
of kids to rugby I think this is

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:26.730 
of kids to rugby I think this is
probably<00:00:25.869> the<00:00:25.990> first<00:00:26.140> time<00:00:26.290> that<00:00:26.439> some<00:00:26.710> of

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:26.740 
probably the first time that some of

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.859 
probably the first time that some of
these<00:00:26.890> kids<00:00:27.130> have<00:00:27.610> played<00:00:27.820> rugby<00:00:28.090> so<00:00:28.450> I<00:00:28.660> think

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:28.869 
these kids have played rugby so I think

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:30.600 
these kids have played rugby so I think
my<00:00:29.020> personal<00:00:29.439> involvement<00:00:29.680> today<00:00:30.160> I<00:00:30.189> feel

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:30.610 
my personal involvement today I feel

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:32.729 
my personal involvement today I feel
like<00:00:30.730> a<00:00:30.759> bit<00:00:30.910> of<00:00:30.939> a<00:00:31.060> shepherd<00:00:31.450> trying<00:00:31.779> to<00:00:31.930> to

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:32.739 
like a bit of a shepherd trying to to

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:34.770 
like a bit of a shepherd trying to to
point<00:00:33.580> them<00:00:33.699> in<00:00:33.760> the<00:00:33.820> right<00:00:33.910> direction<00:00:34.030> but

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:34.780 
point them in the right direction but

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:36.390 
point them in the right direction but
what<00:00:35.140> I've<00:00:35.379> seen<00:00:35.410> so<00:00:35.739> far<00:00:35.770> they're<00:00:36.129> having<00:00:36.340> a

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:36.400 
what I've seen so far they're having a

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.270 
what I've seen so far they're having a
lot<00:00:36.699> of<00:00:36.730> fun<00:00:36.970> using<00:00:37.930> up<00:00:38.170> a<00:00:38.260> lot<00:00:38.440> of<00:00:38.470> energy<00:00:38.920> and

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:39.280 
lot of fun using up a lot of energy and

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.790 
lot of fun using up a lot of energy and
I<00:00:39.550> think<00:00:39.580> you<00:00:40.510> know<00:00:40.629> hopefully<00:00:40.809> for<00:00:41.590> a<00:00:41.620> rugby

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:41.800 
I think you know hopefully for a rugby

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.740 
I think you know hopefully for a rugby
for<00:00:41.980> any<00:00:42.129> blue<00:00:42.280> they<00:00:42.460> they<00:00:42.910> may<00:00:43.269> take<00:00:43.540> up<00:00:43.660> the

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:43.750 
for any blue they they may take up the

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:55.350 
for any blue they they may take up the
game<00:00:43.900> in<00:00:44.019> the<00:00:44.080> future<00:00:44.379> I<00:00:54.120> guess<00:00:55.120> the<00:00:55.239> number

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:55.360 
game in the future I guess the number

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.540 
game in the future I guess the number
one<00:00:55.660> aim<00:00:55.840> is<00:00:56.020> to<00:00:56.170> interact<00:00:56.649> with<00:00:56.770> as<00:00:57.010> many<00:00:57.190> kids

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:57.550 
one aim is to interact with as many kids

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.540 
one aim is to interact with as many kids
as<00:00:57.670> possible<00:00:57.730> and<00:00:58.980> while<00:00:59.980> there's<00:01:00.190> a<00:01:00.250> lot<00:01:00.399> of

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:00.550 
as possible and while there's a lot of

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:02.580 
as possible and while there's a lot of
introductory<00:01:01.030> work<00:01:01.390> going<00:01:01.719> on<00:01:01.840> with<00:01:02.110> kids

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:02.590 
introductory work going on with kids

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:04.109 
introductory work going on with kids
that<00:01:02.770> never<00:01:02.920> played<00:01:03.219> rugby<00:01:03.399> before<00:01:03.910> there's

00:01:04.109 --> 00:01:04.119 
that never played rugby before there's

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:06.330 
that never played rugby before there's
also<00:01:04.449> work<00:01:04.960> going<00:01:05.229> on<00:01:05.350> with<00:01:05.560> some<00:01:06.130> quite

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340 
also work going on with some quite

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.400 
also work going on with some quite
accomplished<00:01:06.910> the<00:01:07.180> children<00:01:08.020> to<00:01:08.170> just

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:08.410 
accomplished the children to just

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:10.740 
accomplished the children to just
perhaps<00:01:08.700> remind<00:01:09.700> them<00:01:09.880> of<00:01:09.970> the<00:01:10.149> the<00:01:10.600> basic

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
perhaps remind them of the the basic

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.350 
perhaps remind them of the the basic
skills<00:01:11.289> of<00:01:11.440> the<00:01:11.560> game<00:01:11.770> are<00:01:12.490> what's<00:01:12.729> important

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:13.360 
skills of the game are what's important

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.600 
skills of the game are what's important
but<00:01:13.600> as<00:01:14.470> far<00:01:14.680> as<00:01:14.710> I'm<00:01:14.890> concerned<00:01:15.310> it's<00:01:15.550> just

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.610 
but as far as I'm concerned it's just

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:17.700 
but as far as I'm concerned it's just
the<00:01:15.880> chance<00:01:16.180> to<00:01:16.450> interact<00:01:17.020> with<00:01:17.289> so<00:01:17.590> many

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 
the chance to interact with so many

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.180 
the chance to interact with so many
children<00:01:17.979> around<00:01:18.340> ages

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:22.190 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:34.150 

I<00:01:31.930> think<00:01:32.930> this<00:01:33.050> is<00:01:33.170> a<00:01:33.200> fantastic<00:01:33.650> initiative

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:34.160 
I think this is a fantastic initiative

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.790 
I think this is a fantastic initiative
it's<00:01:34.820> one<00:01:34.970> of<00:01:35.090> many<00:01:35.330> initiatives<00:01:35.800> although

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:36.800 
it's one of many initiatives although

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.760 
it's one of many initiatives although
like<00:01:36.980> the<00:01:37.130> HSBC<00:01:37.430> does<00:01:38.330> run<00:01:38.600> and<00:01:38.900> for<00:01:39.080> me

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
like the HSBC does run and for me

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.370 
like the HSBC does run and for me
sports<00:01:40.490> and<00:01:40.820> rugby<00:01:41.300> in<00:01:41.360> particular<00:01:41.630> is<00:01:42.050> a<00:01:42.080> game

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
sports and rugby in particular is a game

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290 
that's anybody wherever they are from

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:46.750 
that's anybody wherever they are from
whatever<00:01:45.620> background<00:01:45.800> could<00:01:46.460> get<00:01:46.640> involved

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:46.760 
whatever background could get involved

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.200 
whatever background could get involved
with<00:01:47.210> can<00:01:47.720> play<00:01:48.220> it's<00:01:49.220> it's<00:01:49.550> a<00:01:49.640> real<00:01:49.820> it's<00:01:50.120> a

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
with can play it's it's a real it's a

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:51.400 
with can play it's it's a real it's a

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
and if I think is fantastic well you

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:07.870 
and if I think is fantastic well you
can't<00:02:06.350> guarantee<00:02:06.590> that<00:02:06.920> rugby<00:02:07.460> is<00:02:07.640> going<00:02:07.790> to

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
can't guarantee that rugby is going to

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.969 
can't guarantee that rugby is going to
grow<00:02:08.030> as<00:02:08.119> a<00:02:08.240> result<00:02:08.390> of<00:02:08.720> them<00:02:08.869> that<00:02:09.050> what<00:02:09.860> we

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
grow as a result of them that what we

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:11.440 
grow as a result of them that what we
hope<00:02:10.160> is<00:02:10.310> that<00:02:10.520> they<00:02:10.700> act<00:02:10.820> as<00:02:11.030> a<00:02:11.060> form<00:02:11.360> of

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
hope is that they act as a form of

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.050 
hope is that they act as a form of
catalyst<00:02:12.020> so<00:02:12.200> in<00:02:12.440> combination<00:02:13.160> with<00:02:13.370> the<00:02:13.580> Asia
