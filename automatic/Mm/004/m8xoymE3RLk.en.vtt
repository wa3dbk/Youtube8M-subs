00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.340
 Hello, how are you talking about new? 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.559
 account and surely it happened to you 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.930
 also that you wanted to play some of 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.029
 your favorite songs and you realize 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:18.570
 that your guitar is out of tune and 

00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:21.270
 because you do not have any computer to the 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.120
 hand or some reference sound for 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.590
 I can fine tune it quickly so I'm going 

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:29.550
 to recommend that in this very short video 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:32.640
 an application for cell phone for android 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:36.600
 and also for iphone that you can 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:39.600
 use to tune your guitar 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:44.309
 very simple way this application is 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:47.789
 the ultimate guitar and besides containing 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:51.449
 a tuner comes with a library of 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.949
 chords and a metronome that is very useful 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.159
 for people who are learning 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.650
 has a cost of 4 dollars and I repeat 

00:00:56.159 --> 00:01:00.130
 is for 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:02.830
 for iphone and for 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:05.770
 Android cell phones you can even 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:08.230
 Finding it separately is 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:11.410
 say you can find the tuner by 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:13.330
 yes only the metronome alone by itself 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:16.350
 only the chord library also by 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:18.760
 yes alone then this is a screen 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.850
 screenshot of the application 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:25.390
 great download mainly by the 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.979
 tuner and the chord library and already 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.570
 the metronome as it comes extra but 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:31.390
 It is also very useful, I repeat for you 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:34.150
 people who are learning 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:36.580
 to measure their times then to be able 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:40.060
 download it you must go to the site of 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:42.100
 iTunes or google google play site 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.020
 which is where they are available for 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.140
 two different versions 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:49.350
