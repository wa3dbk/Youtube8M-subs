gonna be a short video on what i believe

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.430 
gonna be a short video on what i believe
to<00:00:32.309> be<00:00:33.530> late<00:00:34.530> blight<00:00:35.210> I<00:00:36.210> didn't<00:00:36.960> follow<00:00:37.140> my<00:00:37.410> own

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
to be late blight I didn't follow my own

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.450 
to be late blight I didn't follow my own
advice<00:00:37.589> and<00:00:38.930> I<00:00:39.930> didn't<00:00:40.530> stay<00:00:40.739> on<00:00:40.920> top<00:00:41.160> of<00:00:41.190> the

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
advice and I didn't stay on top of the

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.600 
advice and I didn't stay on top of the
yellow<00:00:41.670> leaves<00:00:41.940> and<00:00:42.680> so<00:00:43.680> I<00:00:44.039> believe<00:00:44.399> what<00:00:44.579> I

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
yellow leaves and so I believe what I

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.600 
yellow leaves and so I believe what I
have<00:00:44.850> here<00:00:45.059> is<00:00:45.120> called<00:00:45.480> late<00:00:45.750> blight<00:00:46.430> so<00:00:47.430> right

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
have here is called late blight so right

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.670 
have here is called late blight so right
now<00:00:47.640> I'm<00:00:47.850> in<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.059> process<00:00:48.239> of<00:00:48.719> removing<00:00:49.260> any

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
now I'm in the process of removing any

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.700 
now I'm in the process of removing any
yellow<00:00:50.579> leaves<00:00:50.820> I<00:00:51.090> can<00:00:51.239> find<00:00:51.510> it's<00:00:52.469> probably

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
yellow leaves I can find it's probably

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.740 
yellow leaves I can find it's probably
already<00:00:53.250> too<00:00:53.579> late<00:00:53.789> but<00:00:54.149> I'm<00:00:54.239> gonna<00:00:54.510> do<00:00:54.719> it

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
already too late but I'm gonna do it

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.810 
already too late but I'm gonna do it
anyway<00:00:55.170> just<00:00:55.410> because<00:00:55.920> I<00:00:56.160> need<00:00:56.399> something<00:00:56.640> to

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
anyway just because I need something to

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.750 
anyway just because I need something to
do<00:00:57.320> a<00:00:58.320> couple<00:00:58.800> more<00:00:58.949> of<00:00:59.129> those<00:00:59.280> heirloom

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
do a couple more of those heirloom

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:06.680 
do a couple more of those heirloom
tomatoes<00:01:00.180> in<00:01:00.359> there<00:01:03.710> getting<00:01:04.710> ripe<00:01:05.600> so<00:01:06.600> i'll

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:06.690 
tomatoes in there getting ripe so i'll

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.770 
tomatoes in there getting ripe so i'll
be<00:01:06.780> picking<00:01:06.990> those<00:01:07.259> soon<00:01:08.000> so<00:01:09.000> what<00:01:09.179> my<00:01:09.479> point

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
be picking those soon so what my point

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.650 
be picking those soon so what my point
to<00:01:09.899> the<00:01:10.020> video<00:01:10.229> is<00:01:10.500> and<00:01:10.860> i<00:01:10.950> think<00:01:11.220> this<00:01:12.119> is<00:01:12.179> also

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:12.660 
to the video is and i think this is also

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:14.990 
to the video is and i think this is also
late<00:01:12.840> blight<00:01:13.050> to<00:01:13.289> it<00:01:13.700> seems<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:14.850> manifest

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
late blight to it seems to manifest

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.600 
late blight to it seems to manifest
itself<00:01:15.420> differently<00:01:15.900> on<00:01:16.409> different<00:01:16.549> kinds<00:01:17.549> of

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
itself differently on different kinds of

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.240 
itself differently on different kinds of
tomatoes<00:01:18.030> liked<00:01:18.900> my<00:01:19.110> cherry<00:01:19.140> tomatoes<00:01:19.920> and

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
tomatoes liked my cherry tomatoes and

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.969 
tomatoes liked my cherry tomatoes and
this<00:01:20.400> potato<00:01:20.850> leaf<00:01:21.150> variety<00:01:21.689> called<00:01:21.979> black

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
this potato leaf variety called black

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.060 
this potato leaf variety called black
truffle<00:01:24.229> it<00:01:25.229> doesn't<00:01:25.560> get<00:01:25.650> yellow<00:01:25.860> it<00:01:26.040> turns

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
truffle it doesn't get yellow it turns

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.050 
truffle it doesn't get yellow it turns
right<00:01:26.549> to<00:01:26.670> brown<00:01:26.990> but<00:01:27.990> I<00:01:28.290> think<00:01:28.799> that<00:01:29.040> that<00:01:29.460> and

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
right to brown but I think that that and

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.270 
right to brown but I think that that and
that<00:01:30.680> and<00:01:32.119> this<00:01:33.119> yellow<00:01:33.479> in<00:01:33.659> here<00:01:34.009> are<00:01:35.009> all<00:01:35.159> the

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
that and this yellow in here are all the

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.740 
that and this yellow in here are all the
same<00:01:35.460> thing<00:01:35.729> I<00:01:35.880> believe<00:01:36.210> it<00:01:36.329> to<00:01:36.420> be<00:01:36.450> late

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
same thing I believe it to be late

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.630 
same thing I believe it to be late

don't compost any tomato at all any
leaves<00:01:56.549> any<00:01:56.939> stems<00:01:57.299> I<00:01:57.570> do<00:01:57.630> not<00:01:57.899> compost<00:01:58.380> them

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
leaves any stems I do not compost them

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.429 
leaves any stems I do not compost them
and<00:01:59.450> the<00:02:00.450> reason<00:02:01.439> should<00:02:02.219> be<00:02:02.369> obvious<00:02:02.549> if

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:03.439 
and the reason should be obvious if

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:05.779 
and the reason should be obvious if
these<00:02:04.439> are<00:02:04.619> covered<00:02:04.950> with<00:02:04.979> the<00:02:05.189> fungus<00:02:05.579> and

00:02:05.779 --> 00:02:05.789 
these are covered with the fungus and

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:07.940 
these are covered with the fungus and
you<00:02:06.270> compost<00:02:06.719> these<00:02:07.020> leaves<00:02:07.289> you're<00:02:07.770> going<00:02:07.890> to

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
you compost these leaves you're going to

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.069 
you compost these leaves you're going to
be<00:02:08.070> putting<00:02:08.250> spores<00:02:08.759> into<00:02:09.090> your<00:02:09.299> compost<00:02:09.780> and

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:10.079 
be putting spores into your compost and

00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:11.780 
be putting spores into your compost and
then<00:02:10.289> when<00:02:10.500> it<00:02:10.619> rains<00:02:10.860> like<00:02:11.070> it's<00:02:11.340> doing<00:02:11.519> right

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
then when it rains like it's doing right

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.009 
then when it rains like it's doing right
now<00:02:13.850> the<00:02:14.850> spores<00:02:15.120> are<00:02:15.269> going<00:02:15.390> to<00:02:15.450> splash<00:02:15.660> up<00:02:15.840> on

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019 
now the spores are going to splash up on

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:18.349 
now the spores are going to splash up on
the<00:02:16.110> leaves<00:02:16.290> and<00:02:16.940> then<00:02:17.940> you're<00:02:18.120> going<00:02:18.209> to<00:02:18.269> have

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:18.359 
the leaves and then you're going to have

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:22.420 
the leaves and then you're going to have
disease<00:02:18.780> problems<00:02:19.260> so<00:02:19.620> I<00:02:20.070> do<00:02:20.669> not<00:02:20.850> compost<00:02:21.540> any

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
disease problems so I do not compost any

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.020 
disease problems so I do not compost any
tomatoes<00:02:23.430> or

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
tomatoes or

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.809 
tomatoes or
peppers<00:02:24.860> because<00:02:25.860> of<00:02:26.010> that<00:02:26.130> reason<00:02:26.160> I<00:02:26.670> don't

peppers because of that reason I don't

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:31.430 
peppers because of that reason I don't
