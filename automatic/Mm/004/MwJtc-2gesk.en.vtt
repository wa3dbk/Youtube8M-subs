00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.120
 I know what we have lost... 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.980
 You feel that life is lost more than you get... 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:11.500
 But today is different 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.660
 Today it gives us some stuff 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:15.180
 It gives us a chance 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:16.120
 what chance? 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:18.049
 Actually care about things (I want to pull) 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.960
 well 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:22.440
 ? 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.040
 Wait a minute, what are you doing? 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:25.700
 You said you want to pull! 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.000
 No! No! This is not what I meant! 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:28.520
 I am Groot! 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.180
 Bring me the universe ball! 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:39.820
 What do I do? 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:40.320
 what? 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.940
 I mean... you didn’t do much in the chair all day. 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.740
 Doesn't a spirit ball change your day's work? 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.100
 I will sit on the chair while ruling the universe. 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:54.280
 So... bring me the spirit ball, the devil! 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.200
 Then why don't you stand up from the chair and force me? 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:57.940
 I can't stand up... 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:59.820
 The time has not yet arrived... 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.100
 Plus my feet are numb. 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.780
 You are a freak... Sanos! 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.540
 Battle of infinity~~~~~~! 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:12.540
 We must leave here 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:13.560
 I hope you can have a plan! 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.420
 I really have a plan! 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.080
 Don't shoot only one person at a time! 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.740
 Listen to my command, all at the same time shooting at the same window! 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:21.160
 Ready? 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.120
 Oh... my god. 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.620
 emission! 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.260
 How much do you want me to make? 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:30.960
 What do you say? The more brothers, the better. 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.300
 very good 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:34.180
 Karina! No! 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.700
 I am no longer your slave! 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.480
 Oh, Ah! 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:45.360
 Sorry! This girl seems to be going to stop me from becoming a rich man. 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.220
 A total of four billion yuan! Thank you! 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:05.900
 Yeah~~~~~~! 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.380
 Your destruction is coming! 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.680
 Hey! Dude~ It’s time to relax. 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.820
 Hey~ kid! Things will turn right soon. 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:21.600
 Are you ruined in dry sand? 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.700
 Come and dance! Brother! You will single out with me! 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.260
 Someday! There is something in the beautiful sun...~ 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.420
 Hey...the leek is pulling anyway, you are going to die. 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.800
 Then... I destroyed everything like this! 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:41.140
 This is my pleasure! 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.320
 Grab my hand! 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.220
 Dude! Let go! 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:56.340
 Never! 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:58.880
 What should we do now!? 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.740
 I do not know!!! 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.200
 Do you want to do it now? Do something good? 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:09.358
 Or a bad thing? 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:11.722
 Or is it mixed? 

00:03:11.722 --> 00:03:13.682
 We will follow your footsteps...Star 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.578
 That's a mixed blessing! 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.540
 Wait...so who is a good person who is a bad person? 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:21.980
 Hey! I am Batman. 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:24.860
 Want to know my secret identity? 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:26.760
 Do you want to eat a fist sandwich? 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.560
 Forget it.., he is a bad person. 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.780
 I?! If you really say it, I am a good person and you are a bad person. 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.920
 Or we are good people, they are bad people. 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:37.660
 Or you are the bad guys, we are good people and the like! 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.220
 This conversation made my head hurt! 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.600
 So... welcome back to Earth 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.200
 Awesome! I missed a lot of things in the universe. 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:46.680
 I got this new gadget called iPod... 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.700
 There are a lot of songs in it! 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.400
 Ass! You get my ass, we all have ass 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.900
 Now you all love to sing a fart song! 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.000
 why? 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:56.580
 I do not know either 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:57.540
 The music is eccentric 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.420
 All in all, you saved the galaxy! 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.640
 Many pilots have hung up... 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:04.360
 But in the end, you all solved the problem by hand. 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:05.300
 Ah! I didn’t lie to you. 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:08.940
 You also put infinite gems in unsuspecting cities. 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.360
 Do you know where I found it? 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:12.920
 There is absolutely no one watching there. 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.100
 You and your infinite gems 喔~~ 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:18.460
 So you are half-man doing other things, right? 

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:20.720
 You are not at all curious about who is your biological life? 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.160
 Oh? Sorry, I didn't hear it! 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.260
 Do you know that the variant King Kong is out of the movies? 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.040
 They look super strange! 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.820
 He is asking who you are! 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:33.520
 The Teenage Mutant Ninja is also out of the movies! There are still a few yeah! 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.200
 I feel that he is shifting the topic. 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.420
 You! Half man and half bat! 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:40.860
 Who are you squatting? 

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.820
 Hey! I am not a half bat, I am just wearing a bat... 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:44.320
 Because I am a bat... 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:45.580
 Why are you wearing a bat costume? 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.960
 I have to attack the fear in my enemies directly. Is this still asking? 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.660
 Bats are not scary, they are just small animals. 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:53.420
 Bats are super scary! 

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:56.900
 Then you should call yourself "the ordinary person wearing a bat costume" 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:58.560
 I am not an ordinary person... 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:59.740
 I am Batman! 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:01.980
 I am Groot! 

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:03.000
 I am Batman! 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.060
 I am Groot! 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:05.420
 I am Batman! 

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:06.420
 I am Groot! 

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:07.580
 I am Batman! 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:08.620
 I am Groot! 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:09.660
 I am Batman! 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:10.520
 It seems that this conversation will last for a long time. 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:11.020
 I am Groot! 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:12.240
 I am Batman! 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.320
 I am Groot! 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.440
 I am Batman! I am Groot! 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.320
 I am Batman! I am Groot! 

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:18.960
 I am Batman! I am Groot! 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:20.640
 I am Batman! I am a grid~~~~~ Rut! 

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:21.520
 I am separated. 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:24.380
 Special forces also have movies! 

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:26.560
 The dude is awesome in the future! 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.100
 I am going to see those movies soon! 

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:31.000
 After a while... 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:31.880
 Oh...... 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:34.800
 Ok... now I understand 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:37.740
 Know that it is half of success 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:38.240
 I am Groot! 

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:49.140
 Now Chai Daxing... 

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:02.780
 Who is in this full of Gruitt?
