00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.520 
and perform an
so<00:01:38.700> I<00:01:38.729> think<00:01:38.850> that<00:01:39.150> this<00:01:39.299> show<00:01:40.290> is<00:01:40.320> a

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
so I think that this show is a

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.310 
so I think that this show is a
celebration<00:01:41.010> of<00:01:41.190> that<00:01:41.369> approach<00:01:41.640> and<00:01:42.390> have

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
celebration of that approach and have

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
done it before yeah that's what makes it

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.900
