00:02:45.339 --> 00:02:45.349 
occurs between the consciousness and the

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:48.250 
occurs between the consciousness and the
written<00:02:45.500> word<00:02:45.910> like<00:02:46.910> something<00:02:47.720> happens<00:02:48.080> that

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
written word like something happens that

don't happen when you just enunciate
announce<00:02:51.530> or<00:02:51.920> speak<00:02:52.880> like<00:02:53.269> when<00:02:53.420> you<00:02:53.510> write<00:02:53.780> it

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
announce or speak like when you write it

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.150 
announce or speak like when you write it
out<00:02:54.019> it's<00:02:54.380> like<00:02:54.530> it<00:02:54.650> goes<00:02:54.769> through<00:02:54.950> some

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
out it's like it goes through some

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.150 
out it's like it goes through some
process<00:02:55.700> somehow<00:02:56.360> canoe<00:02:56.930> how<00:02:57.290> come<00:02:57.560> me<00:02:57.680> I<00:02:57.860> know

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
process somehow canoe how come me I know

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.800 
process somehow canoe how come me I know
that<00:02:58.280> when<00:02:58.459> I<00:02:58.489> write<00:02:58.670> them<00:02:58.880> things<00:02:59.150> like<00:02:59.330> that

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
that when I write them things like that

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:00.880 
that when I write them things like that
like<00:02:59.989> you<00:03:00.080> know<00:03:00.170> writing<00:03:00.380> need<00:03:00.530> to<00:03:00.620> sort<00:03:00.800> the

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
like you know writing need to sort the

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.280 
like you know writing need to sort the
situation<00:03:01.010> out<00:03:01.550> the<00:03:02.000> very<00:03:02.180> act<00:03:02.420> of<00:03:02.810> writing<00:03:03.050> it

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
situation out the very act of writing it

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.620 
situation out the very act of writing it
down<00:03:03.470> helps<00:03:04.459> me<00:03:04.550> to<00:03:04.730> sort<00:03:04.940> of<00:03:05.000> resolve<00:03:05.390> it

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
down helps me to sort of resolve it

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:07.479 
down helps me to sort of resolve it
thoughts<00:03:06.470> I<00:03:06.709> suppose<00:03:07.069> you've<00:03:07.220> got<00:03:07.250> a<00:03:07.340> little

bit better extra time haven't you the

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.360 
bit better extra time haven't you the
words<00:03:10.190> that<00:03:10.459> sort<00:03:10.640> of<00:03:11.049> tumble<00:03:12.049> and<00:03:12.410> compete<00:03:13.069> to

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
words that sort of tumble and compete to

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.570 
words that sort of tumble and compete to
leave<00:03:13.640> your<00:03:14.000> the<00:03:14.530> labial<00:03:15.530> Fortress<00:03:16.190> you<00:03:16.400> can
