swing by attacking her anywhere towards

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.420 
swing by attacking her anywhere towards
her<00:02:02.790> rear<00:02:03.000> half<00:02:03.299> and<00:02:04.009> you're<00:02:05.009> going<00:02:05.159> to<00:02:05.250> need

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
her rear half and you're going to need

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.920 
her rear half and you're going to need
to<00:02:05.579> do<00:02:05.700> that<00:02:05.729> or<00:02:06.090> I<00:02:06.119> recommend<00:02:06.630> that<00:02:06.689> you<00:02:06.810> do

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
to do that or I recommend that you do

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.960 
to do that or I recommend that you do
that<00:02:07.110> anyway<00:02:07.469> when<00:02:07.979> she<00:02:08.220> starts<00:02:08.550> using<00:02:08.670> her

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
that anyway when she starts using her

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:19.530 
that anyway when she starts using her
magic

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.339 

I<00:02:20.610> suggest<00:02:21.610> that<00:02:21.849> rather<00:02:22.510> than<00:02:22.659> severing<00:02:23.170> both

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:23.349 
I suggest that rather than severing both

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:25.949 
I suggest that rather than severing both
of<00:02:23.530> her<00:02:23.620> tails<00:02:23.859> you<00:02:24.400> leave<00:02:24.640> one<00:02:24.909> intact<00:02:25.359> so

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
of her tails you leave one intact so

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:27.630 
of her tails you leave one intact so
that<00:02:26.109> she'll<00:02:26.260> continue<00:02:26.680> using<00:02:26.859> her<00:02:27.219> tail

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
that she'll continue using her tail

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.459 
that she'll continue using her tail
swing<00:02:27.969> and<00:02:28.239> the<00:02:28.599> other<00:02:28.719> tail<00:02:28.989> attacks<00:02:29.290> that

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:29.469 
swing and the other tail attacks that

00:02:29.469 --> 00:02:31.170 
swing and the other tail attacks that
leave<00:02:29.590> her<00:02:29.709> vulnerable<00:02:30.189> those<00:02:30.730> are<00:02:30.939> your<00:02:30.969> best

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
leave her vulnerable those are your best

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.470 
leave her vulnerable those are your best
chances<00:02:31.659> to<00:02:31.810> strike<00:02:32.140> her<00:02:32.790> also<00:02:33.790> when<00:02:34.209> she

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
chances to strike her also when she

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.809 
chances to strike her also when she
starts<00:02:34.810> using<00:02:35.019> homing<00:02:35.769> soul<00:02:36.010> mass<00:02:36.220> or<00:02:36.579> this

her to freeze in place rather than chase

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.520 
her to freeze in place rather than chase

towards her as well to avoid them but

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:04.349 
towards her as well to avoid them but
that's<00:02:58.180> the<00:02:58.359> best<00:02:58.540> way<00:02:58.689> to<00:02:58.750> avoid<00:02:58.959> them<00:03:03.060> if<00:03:04.060> you

do not trigger her tail swing attack

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:10.080 
do not trigger her tail swing attack
when<00:03:07.239> she<00:03:07.569> uses<00:03:07.989> homing<00:03:08.470> soul<00:03:08.709> mass<00:03:08.950> she<00:03:09.909> will

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
when she uses homing soul mass she will

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.629 
when she uses homing soul mass she will
try<00:03:10.299> to<00:03:10.359> run<00:03:10.599> you<00:03:10.750> down<00:03:10.959> while<00:03:11.470> the<00:03:11.829> orbs<00:03:12.310> fire

try to run you down while the orbs fire
off<00:03:12.909> and<00:03:13.269> it'll<00:03:13.959> be<00:03:14.109> much<00:03:14.379> harder<00:03:14.620> to<00:03:14.799> dodge<00:03:14.980> as

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:16.349 
off and it'll be much harder to dodge as

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:18.720 
off and it'll be much harder to dodge as
you<00:03:17.349> can<00:03:17.470> see<00:03:17.709> when<00:03:17.980> her<00:03:18.099> tails<00:03:18.310> are<00:03:18.459> hanging

00:03:21.839 --> 00:03:21.849 
the ground you can still hit them with

the ground you can still hit them with
an<00:03:21.939> overhead<00:03:22.209> attack<00:03:22.569> I've<00:03:23.079> severed<00:03:23.500> one<00:03:23.829> here

00:03:24.089 --> 00:03:24.099 
an overhead attack I've severed one here

an overhead attack I've severed one here
just<00:03:24.310> now<00:03:24.489> I<00:03:24.760> left<00:03:25.599> the<00:03:25.750> other<00:03:25.930> one<00:03:26.199> so<00:03:26.590> that

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
just now I left the other one so that

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:28.050 
just now I left the other one so that
she<00:03:26.889> would<00:03:27.010> continue<00:03:27.400> using<00:03:27.519> the<00:03:27.699> attacks

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
she would continue using the attacks

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.580 
she would continue using the attacks
that<00:03:28.209> leave<00:03:28.359> her<00:03:28.510> vulnerable<00:03:28.989> because<00:03:29.379> I

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
that leave her vulnerable because I

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.259 
that leave her vulnerable because I
planned<00:03:29.889> on<00:03:30.069> using<00:03:30.310> those<00:03:30.549> as<00:03:30.760> opportunities

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:31.269 
planned on using those as opportunities

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:34.050 
planned on using those as opportunities
to<00:03:31.510> strike<00:03:31.810> her<00:03:31.989> once<00:03:32.889> again<00:03:33.220> when<00:03:33.729> she

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
to strike her once again when she

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.210 
to strike her once again when she
charges<00:03:34.479> up<00:03:34.599> homing<00:03:34.930> soul<00:03:35.169> mass<00:03:35.379> bait<00:03:36.069> the

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
charges up homing soul mass bait the

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.219 
charges up homing soul mass bait the
tail<00:03:36.430> swing<00:03:36.790> and<00:03:37.000> she'll<00:03:37.690> stay<00:03:37.900> in<00:03:37.959> one<00:03:38.199> spot

00:03:38.219 --> 00:03:38.229 
tail swing and she'll stay in one spot

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:40.439 
tail swing and she'll stay in one spot
which<00:03:38.769> makes<00:03:39.069> it<00:03:39.159> much<00:03:39.310> easier<00:03:39.639> to<00:03:40.060> avoid<00:03:40.419> that

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:40.449 
which makes it much easier to avoid that

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:47.309 
which makes it much easier to avoid that

really all there is to this fight just

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:51.750 
really all there is to this fight just
keep<00:03:50.500> out<00:03:50.650> of<00:03:50.799> the<00:03:50.859> range<00:03:51.099> of<00:03:51.340> her<00:03:51.430> frontal

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:13.389 
just seen so you can use that to your

just seen so you can use that to your
advantage<00:04:13.449> as<00:04:13.959> well<00:04:14.109> but<00:04:14.319> be<00:04:14.439> careful<00:04:14.979> because

00:04:15.149 --> 00:04:15.159 
advantage as well but be careful because

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:17.099 
advantage as well but be careful because
it<00:04:15.609> can<00:04:15.759> be<00:04:15.849> hard<00:04:16.090> to<00:04:16.150> calculate<00:04:16.449> given<00:04:17.019> the

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:17.109 
it can be hard to calculate given the

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:38.679 
it can be hard to calculate given the
elevation<00:04:17.590> differences<00:04:18.070> in<00:04:18.190> this<00:04:18.340> room
