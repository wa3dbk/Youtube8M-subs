00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.230
 No 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.029
 with five good predictions from 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.710
 last week must be pele van anholt 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:22.480
 settle for a place in the 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.579
 average of the general classification 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.930
 today it's osama's turn 

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:27.730
 assaidi 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:30.400
 closely together with the first competition fc 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:33.730
 utrecht and excelsior what do you think 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:39.309
 he tweets things too boring at home and 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:40.809
 held in there is what one and 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:43.000
 then the match of the weekend 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:44.739
 groningen heerenveen from her shit 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.320
 Derby 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:48.400
 Yes we want to say here is 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.470
 then here within pasture 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.989
 from Groningen's a lot Now I go 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:56.710
 highest he could have appreciated p230 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:58.600
 nice group 6 2 yes but 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.449
 plowing then just wants the butcher 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:06.460
 why could we not do that 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:09.850
 Twente against Roda Twente Roda the year 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.080
 2016 a difficult phase 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:17.590
 I think 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:20.400
 think tie psv against vvv 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.400
 the what pc 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.369
 feyenoord nac 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:31.850
 what burden for divorce pro feyenoord 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:33.200
 but I'll go for Feyenoord against nec 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.469
 the county vaulted the whole vault 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.469
 difficult 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:41.000
 yes the grass again certainly difficult and 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:42.470
 well sister or so football and then I this 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.250
 they never take points 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:49.039
 So if the NEC wins Ajax against Eric 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:52.340
 loop said here stormed last week 

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:55.569
 eric les is correct I think I am doing well 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:58.909
 also recovered for this weekend 

00:01:55.569 --> 00:02:02.329
 but i think ajax is strong at home and 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:05.630
 so the finer connect is rkc ado and choose 

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:09.200
 busy and inconvenient and stronger 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.700
 yes right rkc is a difficult team found 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.310
 a good team 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.910
 I think they will beat each other 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.910
 that becomes one 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:22.000
 vitesse az yes it is also a 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:25.660
 very nice club vitesse latin name 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:29.800
 think they should have that point a yes they must 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:32.650
 actually winning there was yes there is 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.630
 actually those points represent men 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:38.230
 think such a figure so find out a them 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:41.260
 have to go back to mommy i think anyway 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:44.050
 hz is a second if your so 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:48.430
 should have shown more often done 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:50.170
 and no I look I guess just full 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.600
 actually men 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.790
 I think that makes him good 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.500
 I think if I look like that, thank you 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.950

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.950
