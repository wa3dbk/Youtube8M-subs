00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 another novelty that includes the new 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.940
 cc photoshop update of 2015 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.830
 It is quite useful for 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.990
 photographers especially and it's about 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.849
 decrease when we meet with 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.700
 this kind of images then the haze and 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.719
 the fog that this image has 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.859
 normally if in this function what 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.350
 we would do it would then increase the 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.300
 contrast increase the blacks and try 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.769
 then make touch-ups by areas to 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.630
 try to balance this image and 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.900
 take away that effect but with this new 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.310
 filter costs a function that incorporates 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.199
 photoshop and especially raw camera from 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.430
 version 9.1 if we do not have this 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.620
 version we will not be able to find it 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.110
 this function will help us 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.210
 enough to remove all this so 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.710
 to see it we are going to create a copy of the 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.500
 layer to work in a way not 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.899
 destructive let's go to filter and 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.700
 since recently we have the camera 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.190
 raw incorporated here through the filter 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.899
 of camera raw 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.699
 to find this one function we have 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:55.190
 to access the effects tab here 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:56.870
 and we'll see that effect the djs that 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.539
 translated then that about removing the 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.769
 fog or the haze of the image if you 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:03.379
 we move to the left 

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:05.210
 what we have is to increase the fog and 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:07.729
 if we move it to the right is what 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.830
 we are interested in removing the fog we see 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:11.840
 that the result is pretty good already 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:14.420
 from the first moment and then if 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.570
 we want we can retouch the image to 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.649
 through the traditional settings 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.679
 we accept and now we can see the 

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:24.170
 before and after being creative 

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:25.520
 with this effect we can apply it to 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.560
 any image that does not necessarily 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.360
 have to have fog like for example 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.340
 this image from here to try this 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.550
 function then we can again duplicate 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.770
 the layer and apply the camera filter 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:40.850
 raul and access the effects function and 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:42.740
 here in the djs so again increase or 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.659
 decrease to see what effect can 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.789
 have on a current image and if 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:48.799
 we increase we see that it adds quite 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:51.259
 contrast and pretty much aggressiveness 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:53.599
 that can be an interesting touch if it is 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:54.679
 what we are looking for there is also that 

00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:55.880
 be careful with this effect 

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:57.500
 why 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.770
 of quality of our image can be seen 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:03.079
 quite affected and we can notice certain 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.430
 loss of image quality if we abuse 

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:05.880
 of this effect, you have to walk 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.770
 carefully 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.700
 we see the before and after and the truth 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.270
 that has given a pretty touch 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.270
 interesting
