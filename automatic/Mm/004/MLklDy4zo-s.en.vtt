00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.410 
last in the comments section of the last
video<00:01:00.930> and<00:01:01.260> they<00:01:01.770> do<00:01:01.829> look<00:01:02.160> very<00:01:02.219> very<00:01:02.760> similar

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
video and they do look very very similar

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.910 
video and they do look very very similar
i<00:01:03.690> think<00:01:03.899> it's<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.170> haircut<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.799> little

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
i think it's the haircut and the little

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.920 
i think it's the haircut and the little
stubbly<00:01:05.250> beard<00:01:05.400> I<00:01:05.790> think<00:01:06.240> I've<00:01:06.330> got<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.720> same

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
stubbly beard I think I've got the same

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.300 
stubbly beard I think I've got the same
kit<00:01:07.170> on<00:01:07.290> I<00:01:07.320> thought<00:01:07.560> to<00:01:07.710> sure<00:01:07.890> it<00:01:08.070> looks<00:01:08.250> very

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
kit on I thought to sure it looks very

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.100 
kit on I thought to sure it looks very
similar<00:01:08.580> but<00:01:09.240> these<00:01:09.659> two<00:01:09.900> guys<00:01:10.049> are

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
similar but these two guys are

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.929 
similar but these two guys are
absolutely<00:01:10.830> identical<00:01:10.950> one<00:01:11.549> of<00:01:11.640> those<00:01:11.729> six

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
absolutely identical one of those six

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.460 
absolutely identical one of those six
four<00:01:12.119> three<00:01:12.150> and<00:01:12.390> one<00:01:12.659> was<00:01:12.810> five<00:01:12.960> foot<00:01:13.140> eleven

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
four three and one was five foot eleven

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.410 
four three and one was five foot eleven
so<00:01:13.799> it's<00:01:13.920> like<00:01:14.040> father<00:01:14.400> and<00:01:14.520> son<00:01:14.729> or<00:01:15.090> something

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
so it's like father and son or something

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.620 
so it's like father and son or something
like<00:01:15.509> that<00:01:15.860> to<00:01:16.860> move<00:01:17.009> over<00:01:17.189> now<00:01:17.490> to<00:01:18.090> our<00:01:18.119> next

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
like that to move over now to our next

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:19.969 
like that to move over now to our next
center<00:01:19.080> back<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:19.380> this<00:01:19.500> one<00:01:19.560> is<00:01:19.860> actually

Gervinho<00:02:24.580> s<00:02:24.790> if<00:02:25.120> you<00:02:25.239> ask<00:02:25.420> me<00:02:25.630> and<00:02:25.810> they're

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
Gervinho s if you ask me and they're

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.589 
Gervinho s if you ask me and they're
just<00:02:26.739> very<00:02:27.099> similar<00:02:27.520> it<00:02:27.640> just<00:02:27.849> facing<00:02:28.510> the

00:02:28.589 --> 00:02:28.599 
just very similar it just facing the

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:29.699 
just very similar it just facing the
opposite<00:02:28.870> way<00:02:28.989> so<00:02:29.050> it<00:02:29.230> looks<00:02:29.380> like<00:02:29.410> he's<00:02:29.590> just

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
opposite way so it looks like he's just

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:31.080 
opposite way so it looks like he's just
spinning<00:02:30.040> his<00:02:30.130> head<00:02:30.250> from<00:02:30.370> side<00:02:30.580> to<00:02:30.760> side<00:02:30.790> when

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
spinning his head from side to side when

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.880 
spinning his head from side to side when
you<00:02:31.180> fit<00:02:31.360> between<00:02:31.540> the<00:02:31.810> two<00:02:31.930> pictures<00:02:32.230> so

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
you fit between the two pictures so

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.170 
you fit between the two pictures so
