00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
about that later I have time but I said

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.670 
about that later I have time but I said
here<00:01:14.850> that<00:01:14.970> I<00:01:15.030> messed<00:01:15.299> up<00:01:15.570> because<00:01:15.840> these

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
here that I messed up because these

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.080 
here that I messed up because these
statues<00:01:17.040> were<00:01:17.130> giving<00:01:17.340> me<00:01:17.369> point<00:01:17.700> oh<00:01:17.850> five

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
statues were giving me point oh five

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.270 
statues were giving me point oh five
percent<00:01:18.810> point<00:01:19.110> O<00:01:19.200> six<00:01:19.380> percent<00:01:19.770> each<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:20.220> I

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
percent point O six percent each and I

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.149 
percent point O six percent each and I
was<00:01:20.460> thinking<00:01:20.900> that<00:01:21.900> give<00:01:22.110> me<00:01:22.229> point<00:01:22.770> 0<00:01:22.890> to<00:01:23.130> 0

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
was thinking that give me point 0 to 0

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:29.359 
was thinking that give me point 0 to 0
point<00:01:23.520> 0<00:01:23.610> 3<00:01:24.380> but<00:01:25.380> I<00:01:25.500> actually<00:01:27.290> it<00:01:28.290> was<00:01:28.530> like<00:01:28.740> 4am

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
point 0 3 but I actually it was like 4am

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.539 
point 0 3 but I actually it was like 4am
or<00:01:29.820> something<00:01:30.180> or<00:01:30.270> five<00:01:30.450> IM<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:31.020> i<00:01:31.229> was<00:01:31.549> so

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
or something or five IM and i was so

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.300 
or something or five IM and i was so
tired<00:01:32.759> i<00:01:32.970> had<00:01:33.060> no<00:01:33.180> idea<00:01:33.210> what<00:01:33.509> i<00:01:33.540> was<00:01:33.600> doing<00:01:34.079> and

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
tired i had no idea what i was doing and

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.240 
tired i had no idea what i was doing and
it<00:01:35.310> turns<00:01:35.579> out<00:01:35.729> that<00:01:35.840> it<00:01:36.840> was<00:01:36.960> actually<00:01:37.250> better

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
it turns out that it was actually better

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.219 
it turns out that it was actually better
for<00:01:38.400> them<00:01:38.640> to<00:01:38.700> be<00:01:38.790> giving<00:01:39.030> that<00:01:39.060> much<00:01:39.360> because

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
for them to be giving that much because

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.510 
for them to be giving that much because
i<00:01:40.470> went<00:01:40.710> in<00:01:40.799> there<00:01:40.829> with<00:01:40.950> ninety<00:01:41.430> eight

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
i went in there with ninety eight

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:42.910 
i went in there with ninety eight
percent<00:01:41.549> so<00:01:41.939> two<00:01:42.090> percent<00:01:42.360> left<00:01:42.540> to<00:01:42.659> get

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
percent so two percent left to get

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.030 
percent so two percent left to get
figured<00:01:43.920> statues<00:01:44.670> give<00:01:44.850> me<00:01:45.229> one<00:01:46.229> percent<00:01:46.680> pick

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
figured statues give me one percent pick

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.469 
figured statues give me one percent pick
me<00:01:47.220> and<00:01:47.280> give<00:01:47.430> me<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.549> other<00:01:47.610> one<00:01:47.729> percent<00:01:48.240> or

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
me and give me the other one percent or

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:49.910 
me and give me the other one percent or
most<00:01:48.899> studies<00:01:49.170> give<00:01:49.290> me<00:01:49.350> like<00:01:49.500> one<00:01:49.619> percent

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
most studies give me like one percent

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.100 
most studies give me like one percent
aerial<00:01:50.340> gives<00:01:50.579> like<00:01:51.000> point<00:01:51.329> two<00:01:51.479> percent<00:01:51.869> and

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
aerial gives like point two percent and

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.950 
aerial gives like point two percent and
then<00:01:52.710> pick<00:01:52.890> me<00:01:53.040> and<00:01:53.100> give<00:01:53.220> me<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.310> rest

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
then pick me and give me the rest

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:02.300 
then pick me and give me the rest
and<00:01:55.080> I<00:01:57.140> can't<00:01:59.119> really<00:02:00.200> see<00:02:01.200> what<00:02:01.650> my<00:02:01.770> exp<00:02:02.070> is

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
and I can't really see what my exp is

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.300 
and I can't really see what my exp is
right<00:02:02.580> now<00:02:03.409> because<00:02:04.409> I'm<00:02:04.590> voicing<00:02:05.130> over

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
right now because I'm voicing over

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.430 
right now because I'm voicing over
because<00:02:05.580> it<00:02:05.760> was<00:02:05.909> like<00:02:06.390> in<00:02:06.540> 4<00:02:06.750> 30am<00:02:07.020> like<00:02:07.290> I

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
because it was like in 4 30am like I

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.540

not<00:04:28.689> sure<00:04:28.749> I<00:04:28.960> don't<00:04:29.139> remember

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.409 

I<00:04:34.919> think<00:04:35.520> that's<00:04:35.669> why<00:04:35.759> there's<00:04:35.909> so<00:04:36.000> many<00:04:36.090> drops

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:36.419 
I think that's why there's so many drops

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:38.450 
I think that's why there's so many drops
and<00:04:36.750> I'd<00:04:36.900> my<00:04:37.289> my<00:04:37.620> wolf<00:04:37.830> underling<00:04:38.189> out<00:04:38.310> because

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
and I'd my my wolf underling out because

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:39.909 
and I'd my my wolf underling out because
it<00:04:38.550> was<00:04:38.639> already<00:04:38.759> doubled<00:04:39.150> round<00:04:39.330> from<00:04:39.629> the

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:39.919 
it was already doubled round from the

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:44.390 
it was already doubled round from the
event<00:04:40.919> yeah<00:04:41.759> I<00:04:41.819> just<00:04:42.469> go<00:04:43.469> back<00:04:43.620> get<00:04:43.860> HS<00:04:44.219> and

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
event yeah I just go back get HS and

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.999 
event yeah I just go back get HS and
then<00:04:44.490> go<00:04:44.639> to<00:04:44.669> columns<00:04:45.060> to<00:04:45.240> level<00:04:45.509> up<00:04:45.740> which<00:04:46.740> is

00:04:46.999 --> 00:04:47.009 
then go to columns to level up which is

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:48.020 
then go to columns to level up which is
a<00:04:47.039> little<00:04:47.280> disappointing<00:04:47.520> for<00:04:47.969> the

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
a little disappointing for the

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:49.969 
a little disappointing for the
screenshot<00:04:48.479> because<00:04:48.719> I<00:04:48.780> would<00:04:48.930> have<00:04:49.020> rather

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:49.979
