00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
little water on them but not too much

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.360 
little water on them but not too much
hold<00:00:54.059> it<00:00:54.210> steady<00:00:54.390> so<00:00:54.510> I<00:00:54.719> can<00:00:54.809> zoom<00:00:55.140> in<00:00:55.379> on<00:00:55.500> it

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.150 

odd<00:00:59.370> kind<00:00:59.760> of<00:00:59.940> roller<00:01:00.149> but<00:01:00.660> anyhow<00:01:01.079> you<00:01:01.379> don't

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
odd kind of roller but anyhow you don't

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.460 
odd kind of roller but anyhow you don't
let<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.579> plaster<00:01:03.120> dry<00:01:03.390> completely<00:01:03.960> it<00:01:04.140> should

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
let the plaster dry completely it should

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.960 
let the plaster dry completely it should
be<00:01:04.589> a<00:01:04.619> little<00:01:04.799> bit<00:01:04.949> drier<00:01:05.159> than<00:01:05.339> this<00:01:05.489> but<00:01:05.760> as

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
be a little bit drier than this but as

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.539 
be a little bit drier than this but as
the<00:01:06.960> proved<00:01:07.200> point<00:01:07.530> we'll<00:01:07.920> see<00:01:08.100> what<00:01:08.280> we<00:01:08.369> got

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
the proved point we'll see what we got

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:15.260 
the proved point we'll see what we got
here<00:01:10.070> see<00:01:11.070> that<00:01:11.750> now<00:01:12.750> this<00:01:12.960> can<00:01:13.200> be<00:01:14.240> done<00:01:15.240> a

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
here see that now this can be done a

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.609 
here see that now this can be done a
couple<00:01:15.420> of<00:01:15.810> ways<00:01:15.990> guys

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
couple of ways guys

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.109 
couple of ways guys
that<00:01:17.130> is<00:01:17.310> an<00:01:17.900> odd<00:01:18.900> finish<00:01:19.560> but<00:01:19.890> I<00:01:19.920> see<00:01:20.189> it<00:01:20.280> often

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
that is an odd finish but I see it often

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.060 
that is an odd finish but I see it often
and<00:01:21.330> I'm<00:01:21.960> going<00:01:22.080> to<00:01:22.110> clean<00:01:22.320> this<00:01:22.350> roller<00:01:22.770> out

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
and I'm going to clean this roller out

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.870 
and I'm going to clean this roller out
this<00:01:23.670> so-called<00:01:24.020> tree-bark<00:01:25.040> roller<00:01:26.040> get

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
this so-called tree-bark roller get

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.399 
this so-called tree-bark roller get
these<00:01:27.000> that<00:01:27.119> bond<00:01:27.330> tools<00:01:27.689> actually<00:01:28.020> they<00:01:28.259> have

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
these that bond tools actually they have

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.800 
these that bond tools actually they have
about<00:01:29.310> twenty<00:01:29.909> other<00:01:30.060> different<00:01:30.450> types<00:01:30.630> of

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
about twenty other different types of

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.679 
about twenty other different types of
rollers<00:01:31.020> too<00:01:31.520> now<00:01:32.520> they<00:01:32.759> call<00:01:33.030> this<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.299> tree

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
rollers too now they call this the tree

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:39.050 
rollers too now they call this the tree
bark<00:01:33.960> look<00:01:36.079> it's<00:01:37.079> kind<00:01:37.259> of<00:01:37.380> cool<00:01:37.619> if<00:01:38.100> you<00:01:38.880> want

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
bark look it's kind of cool if you want

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.030 
bark look it's kind of cool if you want
to<00:01:39.150> go<00:01:39.210> over<00:01:39.570> and<00:01:39.750> over<00:01:39.869> it<00:01:40.049> it<00:01:40.710> actually

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
to go over and over it it actually

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.719 
to go over and over it it actually
changes<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.060> appearance<00:01:42.180> of<00:01:42.840> it<00:01:43.229> and<00:01:43.729> yes

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
changes the appearance of it and yes

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.350 
changes the appearance of it and yes
I've<00:01:45.000> seen<00:01:45.270> a<00:01:45.299> couple<00:01:45.420> textures<00:01:46.110> like<00:01:46.350> that

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
I've seen a couple textures like that

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
and again that's about 50 different

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.709 
and again that's about 50 different
