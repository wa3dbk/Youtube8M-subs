hello<00:00:00.750> everyone<00:00:01.020> is<00:00:01.260> a<00:00:01.290> little<00:00:01.350> giant<00:00:01.829> ear<00:00:01.920> and

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:02.159 
hello everyone is a little giant ear and

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.059 
hello everyone is a little giant ear and
I'm<00:00:02.310> welcome<00:00:02.700> to<00:00:02.939> part<00:00:03.270> 3<00:00:03.360> of<00:00:03.689> my<00:00:04.259> demon

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
I'm welcome to part 3 of my demon

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:07.970 
I'm welcome to part 3 of my demon
tutorial<00:00:05.730> where<00:00:06.270> I<00:00:06.299> review<00:00:06.870> every<00:00:07.049> single

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
tutorial where I review every single

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.580 
tutorial where I review every single
effect<00:00:08.730> or<00:00:08.910> demon<00:00:09.420> in<00:00:09.660> the<00:00:10.019> order<00:00:10.349> that<00:00:10.380> they

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
effect or demon in the order that they

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.980 
effect or demon in the order that they
appear<00:00:10.620> here<00:00:11.340> so<00:00:11.700> the<00:00:11.969> next<00:00:12.179> one<00:00:12.330> of<00:00:12.570> course<00:00:12.809> is

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
appear here so the next one of course is

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.970 
appear here so the next one of course is
a<00:00:13.519> case<00:00:14.519> speed<00:00:15.059> now<00:00:15.630> this<00:00:15.809> one<00:00:15.960> is<00:00:15.990> much<00:00:16.379> like<00:00:16.710> k

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
a case speed now this one is much like k

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.429 
a case speed now this one is much like k
age<00:00:17.160> and<00:00:17.609> it<00:00:17.970> basically<00:00:18.240> does<00:00:18.630> it<00:00:18.810> works<00:00:19.289> on

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
age and it basically does it works on

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.220 
age and it basically does it works on
the<00:00:19.529> exact<00:00:19.800> same<00:00:19.949> contact<00:00:20.539> concept<00:00:21.539> sorry<00:00:21.930> but

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
the exact same contact concept sorry but

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.470 
the exact same contact concept sorry but
instead<00:00:22.680> of<00:00:22.859> instead<00:00:23.670> of<00:00:23.730> having<00:00:24.029> the<00:00:24.240> effect

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
instead of instead of having the effect

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.240 
instead of instead of having the effect
or<00:00:24.689> deleting<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:25.140> particles<00:00:25.619> and<00:00:25.769> a<00:00:25.890> certain

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
or deleting the particles and a certain

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.450 
or deleting the particles and a certain
frame<00:00:26.670> or<00:00:27.300> time<00:00:27.840> in<00:00:28.170> the<00:00:28.289> timeline<00:00:28.590> this<00:00:29.250> does

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
frame or time in the timeline this does

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.490 
frame or time in the timeline this does
it<00:00:29.609> when<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:29.849> particles<00:00:30.330> here<00:00:30.570> hit<00:00:31.109> or<00:00:31.289> reach

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
it when the particles here hit or reach

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.950 
it when the particles here hit or reach
a<00:00:31.679> certain<00:00:31.859> speed<00:00:32.250> so<00:00:33.149> if<00:00:33.420> we<00:00:33.540> just<00:00:33.690> put<00:00:33.870> the

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
a certain speed so if we just put the

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.440 
a certain speed so if we just put the
minimum<00:00:34.290> speed<00:00:34.500> on<00:00:34.710> one<00:00:35.070> and<00:00:35.340> have<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.210> max

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
minimum speed on one and have the max

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.650 
minimum speed on one and have the max
speed<00:00:36.540> on<00:00:36.899> 20<00:00:37.649> and<00:00:37.820> then<00:00:38.820> we<00:00:39.149> just<00:00:39.390> hit

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
speed on 20 and then we just hit

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.530 
speed on 20 and then we just hit
simulate<00:00:40.610> so<00:00:41.610> this<00:00:41.790> of<00:00:41.940> course<00:00:42.000> have<00:00:42.329> a<00:00:42.360> normal

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
simulate so this of course have a normal

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.889 
simulate so this of course have a normal
circle<00:00:43.140> emitter<00:00:43.739> and<00:00:44.210> if<00:00:45.210> we<00:00:45.420> could<00:00:45.600> simulate

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
circle emitter and if we could simulate

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.600 
circle emitter and if we could simulate
to<00:00:46.500> add<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.710> moment<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.039> speed<00:00:47.280> that<00:00:47.430> they're

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
to add the moment the speed that they're

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:48.950 
to add the moment the speed that they're
going<00:00:47.789> is<00:00:48.000> to<00:00:48.239> because<00:00:48.539> that's<00:00:48.719> what<00:00:48.870> the

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
going is to because that's what the

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.840 
going is to because that's what the
emitter<00:00:49.230> is<00:00:49.379> set<00:00:49.559> on<00:00:49.590> but<00:00:50.219> when<00:00:50.370> they<00:00:50.520> hit<00:00:50.700> this

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
emitter is set on but when they hit this

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.880 
emitter is set on but when they hit this
plane<00:00:51.210> they<00:00:51.780> are<00:00:51.899> going<00:00:52.050> to<00:00:52.140> slow<00:00:52.590> down<00:00:52.829> so

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
plane they are going to slow down so

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.439 
plane they are going to slow down so
they<00:00:53.219> won't<00:00:53.460> be<00:00:53.610> to<00:00:53.789> any<00:00:53.940> more<00:00:54.120> they'll<00:00:54.329> be

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
they won't be to any more they'll be

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.840 
they won't be to any more they'll be
below<00:00:54.870> 1<00:00:55.170> so<00:00:55.739> they<00:00:55.890> are<00:00:56.039> now<00:00:56.160> at<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.309> leading

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
below 1 so they are now at the leading

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.229 
below 1 so they are now at the leading
so<00:00:57.750> it<00:00:57.989> has<00:00:58.079> nothing<00:00:58.320> to<00:00:58.530> do<00:00:58.620> with<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:58.829> plane

00:00:59.229 --> 00:00:59.239 
so it has nothing to do with the plane

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:01.639 
so it has nothing to do with the plane
i'll<00:01:00.239> also<00:01:00.449> demonstrate<00:01:00.989> with<00:01:01.109> this<00:01:01.350> with<00:01:01.620> a

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
i'll also demonstrate with this with a

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:07.310 
i'll also demonstrate with this with a
bit<00:01:01.920> of<00:01:02.149> K<00:01:03.149> or<00:01:04.400> just<00:01:05.400> gravity<00:01:05.970> under<00:01:06.900> this<00:01:07.049> is<00:01:07.200> a

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
bit of K or just gravity under this is a

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.990 
bit of K or just gravity under this is a
kind<00:01:07.650> of<00:01:07.830> a<00:01:07.890> bit<00:01:08.040> cheating<00:01:08.990> but<00:01:10.490> well<00:01:11.490> I<00:01:11.520> mean<00:01:11.760> I

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
kind of a bit cheating but well I mean I

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.660 
kind of a bit cheating but well I mean I
have<00:01:12.119> to<00:01:12.180> have<00:01:12.540> to<00:01:12.659> include<00:01:12.960> this<00:01:13.580> even<00:01:14.580> though

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
have to have to include this even though

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.670 
have to have to include this even though
it's<00:01:14.820> a<00:01:14.880> demon<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:15.330> I'll<00:01:15.869> have<00:01:16.080> to<00:01:16.229> review<00:01:16.530> it

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
it's a demon and I'll have to review it

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.130 
it's a demon and I'll have to review it
a<00:01:16.740> delay<00:01:17.040> at<00:01:17.100> a<00:01:17.250> time<00:01:17.549> I<00:01:17.580> guess<00:01:18.119> but<00:01:18.540> I'll<00:01:18.810> just

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
a delay at a time I guess but I'll just

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.140 
a delay at a time I guess but I'll just
have<00:01:19.290> to<00:01:19.409> do<00:01:19.500> it<00:01:19.590> out<00:01:19.740> over<00:01:20.130> that<00:01:20.430> I'm<00:01:20.549> 15<00:01:20.970> and

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
have to do it out over that I'm 15 and

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.800 
have to do it out over that I'm 15 and
then<00:01:21.810> with<00:01:22.140> their<00:01:22.350> max<00:01:22.770> speed<00:01:23.009> on<00:01:23.310> 12<00:01:23.729> if<00:01:24.479> I<00:01:24.600> hit

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
then with their max speed on 12 if I hit

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.770 
then with their max speed on 12 if I hit
reset<00:01:25.229> and<00:01:25.409> then<00:01:25.530> simulate<00:01:26.330> you'll<00:01:27.330> see<00:01:27.600> that

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
reset and then simulate you'll see that

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.740 
reset and then simulate you'll see that
these<00:01:28.280> particles<00:01:29.280> are<00:01:30.619> not<00:01:31.619> deleting<00:01:32.750> then

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
these particles are not deleting then

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.600 
these particles are not deleting then
I'll<00:01:33.900> have<00:01:34.049> to<00:01:34.140> put<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.670> max<00:01:35.670> speed<00:01:35.850> on<00:01:36.360> 27<00:01:37.610> and

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
I'll have to put the max speed on 27 and

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.410 
I'll have to put the max speed on 27 and
now<00:01:39.270> they<00:01:39.509> should<00:01:39.740> delete<00:01:40.740> yeah<00:01:41.310> so<00:01:41.970> all<00:01:42.000> these

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
now they should delete yeah so all these

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.149 
now they should delete yeah so all these
particles<00:01:43.049> are<00:01:43.290> reaching<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.740> speed<00:01:44.009> of

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
particles are reaching the speed of

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.740 
particles are reaching the speed of
seven<00:01:44.460> at<00:01:44.579> this<00:01:44.759> point<00:01:45.060> so<00:01:45.420> that's<00:01:45.600> why

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
seven at this point so that's why

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.870 
seven at this point so that's why
they're<00:01:45.960> deleting<00:01:46.380> there<00:01:46.560> now<00:01:47.189> I'm<00:01:47.460> hope<00:01:47.759> that

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
they're deleting there now I'm hope that

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.780 
they're deleting there now I'm hope that
makes<00:01:48.060> sense<00:01:48.180> to<00:01:48.570> you<00:01:48.710> but<00:01:49.710> now<00:01:50.369> we'll<00:01:50.520> get<00:01:50.640> on

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
makes sense to you but now we'll get on

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.149 
makes sense to you but now we'll get on
to<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:50.970> UM<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.299> more<00:01:52.079> interesting<00:01:52.829> part<00:01:53.070> of

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
to the UM the more interesting part of

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.550 
to the UM the more interesting part of
this<00:01:53.310> demon<00:01:53.700> and<00:01:53.880> like<00:01:54.509> I<00:01:54.540> said<00:01:54.659> a<00:01:54.810> lot<00:01:55.140> like<00:01:55.320> a

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
this demon and like I said a lot like a

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.020 
this demon and like I said a lot like a
so<00:01:55.920> you<00:01:55.979> have<00:01:56.100> this<00:01:56.189> little<00:01:56.399> split<00:01:56.850> option

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
so you have this little split option

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.480 
so you have this little split option
here<00:01:57.450> so<00:01:57.990> this<00:01:58.110> is<00:01:58.229> take<00:01:58.409> yes<00:01:58.680> there<00:01:58.920> and<00:01:59.369> then

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
here so this is take yes there and then

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.569 
here so this is take yes there and then
change<00:01:59.759> their<00:02:00.030> child<00:02:00.360> to<00:02:00.509> five<00:02:00.979> I<00:02:01.979> was<00:02:02.369> doing

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
change their child to five I was doing

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.399 
change their child to five I was doing
it<00:02:02.640> to<00:02:02.700> work<00:02:02.969> with<00:02:03.149> this<00:02:03.240> before<00:02:03.630> and<00:02:03.840> it<00:02:04.200> does

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
it to work with this before and it does

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.889 
it to work with this before and it does
kind<00:02:04.710> of<00:02:04.770> bug<00:02:05.040> out<00:02:05.250> a<00:02:05.280> bit<00:02:05.549> I<00:02:06.149> don't<00:02:06.719> know<00:02:06.810> how

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
kind of bug out a bit I don't know how

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.889 
kind of bug out a bit I don't know how
you<00:02:06.930> can<00:02:07.140> maybe<00:02:07.290> control<00:02:07.799> this<00:02:08.009> um<00:02:08.280> but<00:02:09.239> yeah

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
you can maybe control this um but yeah

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.530 
you can maybe control this um but yeah
so<00:02:10.170> if<00:02:10.289> I<00:02:10.379> just<00:02:10.590> hit<00:02:10.830> simulate<00:02:11.390> you'll<00:02:12.390> see

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
so if I just hit simulate you'll see

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.760 
so if I just hit simulate you'll see
that<00:02:12.660> when<00:02:12.780> it<00:02:12.930> hits<00:02:13.080> this<00:02:13.230> point

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
that when it hits this point

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.990 
that when it hits this point
all<00:02:14.130> these<00:02:14.460> particles<00:02:15.090> are<00:02:15.390> rupt<00:02:16.170> into

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
all these particles are rupt into

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.990 
all these particles are rupt into
children<00:02:18.000> of<00:02:18.210> their<00:02:18.480> own<00:02:20.480> so<00:02:22.340> and<00:02:23.340> then<00:02:23.760> these

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
children of their own so and then these

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.530 
children of their own so and then these
ones<00:02:24.330> when<00:02:24.750> they<00:02:24.780> go<00:02:25.740> faster<00:02:26.250> than<00:02:26.370> 12<00:02:26.670> or<00:02:27.270> less

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
ones when they go faster than 12 or less

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.700 
ones when they go faster than 12 or less
than<00:02:27.780> one<00:02:28.280> will<00:02:29.280> also<00:02:29.880> erupt<00:02:30.420> into<00:02:30.780> children

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 
than one will also erupt into children

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.190 
than one will also erupt into children
of<00:02:31.830> their<00:02:31.980> own<00:02:32.040> and<00:02:32.750> so<00:02:33.750> it's<00:02:33.870> just<00:02:33.930> kind<00:02:34.110> of

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
of their own and so it's just kind of

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.410 
of their own and so it's just kind of
like<00:02:34.260> a<00:02:34.380> minute<00:02:34.920> loop<00:02:35.190> or<00:02:35.460> cycle<00:02:36.060> or<00:02:36.180> whatever

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
like a minute loop or cycle or whatever

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.660 
like a minute loop or cycle or whatever
you<00:02:36.510> want<00:02:36.630> to<00:02:36.690> call<00:02:36.810> it<00:02:37.130> forget<00:02:38.130> so<00:02:38.550> that's

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
you want to call it forget so that's

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.570 
you want to call it forget so that's
basically<00:02:38.850> the<00:02:39.180> whole<00:02:40.010> that's<00:02:41.010> the<00:02:41.280> whole

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
basically the whole that's the whole

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.310 
basically the whole that's the whole
demon<00:02:42.510> review<00:02:43.320> of<00:02:43.560> it<00:02:44.000> and<00:02:45.000> just<00:02:45.960> remember<00:02:46.170> to

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.250 
and stuff specs on this computer are
pretty<00:03:14.640> good<00:03:14.850> like<00:03:15.330> it<00:03:15.360> has<00:03:15.570> a<00:03:15.600> 320<00:03:16.110> gig

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
pretty good like it has a 320 gig

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.250 
pretty good like it has a 320 gig
solid-state<00:03:16.770> drive<00:03:17.070> which<00:03:17.870> cost<00:03:18.870> me<00:03:18.990> seven

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
solid-state drive which cost me seven

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.380 
solid-state drive which cost me seven
hundred<00:03:19.500> dollars<00:03:19.530> as<00:03:19.980> you<00:03:20.490> guys<00:03:20.940> may<00:03:21.180> know

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
hundred dollars as you guys may know

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.630 
hundred dollars as you guys may know
that<00:03:21.570> they're<00:03:21.840> actually<00:03:22.110> three<00:03:22.380> gig<00:03:22.640> three

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
that they're actually three gig three

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.210 
that they're actually three gig three
dollars<00:03:23.820> per<00:03:24.120> gig<00:03:24.510> so<00:03:25.050> i<00:03:25.440> saved<00:03:25.770> two<00:03:25.980> hundred

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
dollars per gig so i saved two hundred

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.330 
dollars per gig so i saved two hundred
dollars<00:03:26.430> on<00:03:26.550> that<00:03:26.700> I<00:03:26.850> have<00:03:27.540> 12<00:03:27.810> gig<00:03:27.990> ram<00:03:28.340> with

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
dollars on that I have 12 gig ram with

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.460 
dollars on that I have 12 gig ram with
yeah<00:03:30.270> actually<00:03:30.420> I<00:03:30.570> think<00:03:30.660> I<00:03:30.840> only<00:03:30.959> have<00:03:31.140> three

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
yeah actually I think I only have three

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.320 
yeah actually I think I only have three
ram<00:03:31.740> slots<00:03:32.250> so<00:03:32.820> that<00:03:32.940> was<00:03:33.030> actually<00:03:33.120> pretty

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330 
ram slots so that was actually pretty

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.520 
ram slots so that was actually pretty
hard<00:03:33.720> to<00:03:33.900> get<00:03:34.910> also<00:03:35.910> I<00:03:35.940> have<00:03:36.420> a<00:03:36.450> three<00:03:37.170> point

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
hard to get also I have a three point

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.710 
hard to get also I have a three point
five<00:03:37.680> gigahertz<00:03:38.040> overclocked<00:03:38.940> I<00:03:39.330> don't<00:03:39.660> know

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
five gigahertz overclocked I don't know

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:40.640 
five gigahertz overclocked I don't know
I<00:03:39.780> don't<00:03:39.900> actually<00:03:40.170> know<00:03:40.350> what<00:03:40.530> its

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
I don't actually know what its

I don't actually know what its
overclocked<00:03:41.070> to<00:03:41.100> I<00:03:41.310> just<00:03:41.670> know<00:03:41.760> that<00:03:41.910> the

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
overclocked to I just know that the

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:47.840 
overclocked to I just know that the
original<00:03:42.270> is<00:03:42.800> 3.5<00:03:44.720> but<00:03:45.720> yeah<00:03:45.870> so<00:03:46.340> if<00:03:47.340> you<00:03:47.610> I've

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850
