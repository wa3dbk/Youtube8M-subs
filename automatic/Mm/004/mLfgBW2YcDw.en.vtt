00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:36.130 
I'm probably not going to take it all
down<00:03:34.060> if<00:03:35.060> you<00:03:35.240> all<00:03:35.390> know<00:03:35.510> I<00:03:35.540> have<00:03:35.810> my<00:03:35.840> little

I'll take down as much as I can and and

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.750 
I'll take down as much as I can and and
see<00:03:49.880> it<00:03:50.060> still<00:03:50.390> feels<00:03:50.720> kind<00:03:51.110> of<00:03:51.170> dead<00:03:51.490> so<00:03:52.490> that

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
see it still feels kind of dead so that

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.160 
see it still feels kind of dead so that
would<00:03:52.880> be<00:03:52.910> the<00:03:53.030> only<00:03:53.180> thing<00:03:53.630> that<00:03:53.840> I<00:03:53.960> would<00:03:54.020> say

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.170 
would be the only thing that I would say

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:57.010 
would be the only thing that I would say
I<00:03:54.410> did<00:03:54.860> not<00:03:54.890> like<00:03:55.370> about<00:03:55.610> this<00:03:56.030> is<00:03:56.300> it<00:03:56.750> just

how<00:05:36.720> i<00:05:36.930> used<00:05:37.350> them<00:05:37.650> so<00:05:37.950> maybe<00:05:38.250> i<00:05:38.370> can<00:05:38.720> hold<00:05:39.720> on

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:39.900 
how i used them so maybe i can hold on

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:42.080 
how i used them so maybe i can hold on
to<00:05:40.110> the<00:05:40.200> rollers<00:05:40.590> and<00:05:40.620> using<00:05:41.610> the<00:05:41.730> way<00:05:41.850> that

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:42.090 
to the rollers and using the way that

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:49.360 
to the rollers and using the way that
she<00:05:42.360> used<00:05:43.080> them

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:49.370 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:55.840
