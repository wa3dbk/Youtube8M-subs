and then this piece comes up that way as
far<00:00:24.060> as<00:00:24.119> what<00:00:24.570> degree<00:00:24.930> at<00:00:25.050> that<00:00:25.230> I'm<00:00:25.580> not<00:00:26.580> sure

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:27.050 
far as what degree at that I'm not sure

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.820 
far as what degree at that I'm not sure
it's<00:00:28.050> not<00:00:28.199> 45<00:00:28.830> degrees<00:00:29.160> but<00:00:29.189> if<00:00:29.880> you<00:00:30.090> were<00:00:30.240> to

the back of your truck whenever whenever
you<00:01:41.880> want<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:42.560> let's<00:01:43.560> say<00:01:43.649> put<00:01:43.890> up<00:01:43.979> a

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
you want to let's say put up a

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.690 
you want to let's say put up a
motorcycle<00:01:45.810> or<00:01:45.990> something<00:01:46.829> like<00:01:47.070> that<00:01:47.130> that's

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
motorcycle or something like that that's

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.670 
motorcycle or something like that that's
what<00:01:47.880> you<00:01:47.970> would<00:01:48.090> use<00:01:48.240> these<00:01:48.420> for<00:01:48.659> there<00:01:49.530> are

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
what you would use these for there are

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.910 
what you would use these for there are
stickers<00:01:50.810> the<00:01:51.810> ten<00:01:51.990> dollars<00:01:52.259> and<00:01:52.500> you<00:01:52.530> get<00:01:52.710> two

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
stickers the ten dollars and you get two

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:53.960 
stickers the ten dollars and you get two
of<00:01:52.950> them<00:01:53.100> which<00:01:53.340> is<00:01:53.369> awesome

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
of them which is awesome

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.969 
of them which is awesome
but<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.810> bad<00:01:55.079> thing<00:01:55.110> is<00:01:55.439> that<00:01:55.560> you<00:01:55.829> actually

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
but the bad thing is that you actually

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.100 
but the bad thing is that you actually
need

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110 
need

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.590 
need
you<00:01:57.710> actually<00:01:57.860> need<00:01:58.180> two<00:01:59.180> of<00:01:59.270> those<00:01:59.390> sets

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
you actually need two of those sets

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.180 
you actually need two of those sets
because<00:01:59.930> you<00:02:00.020> need<00:02:00.140> total<00:02:00.320> of<00:02:00.500> four<00:02:00.770> creds

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:01.190 
because you need total of four creds

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:02.470 
because you need total of four creds
because<00:02:01.430> the<00:02:01.610> tread<00:02:01.820> itself<00:02:02.060> is<00:02:02.150> only<00:02:02.270> this

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:02.480 
because the tread itself is only this

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.870 
because the tread itself is only this
big<00:02:02.540> so<00:02:03.140> you<00:02:03.260> should<00:02:03.500> have<00:02:03.650> one<00:02:03.920> here<00:02:04.130> you<00:02:04.790> have

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
big so you should have one here you have

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.060
