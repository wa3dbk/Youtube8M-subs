00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
said it's kind of cool I really love the

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.259 
said it's kind of cool I really love the
track<00:03:22.019> here<00:03:22.379> in<00:03:22.470> the<00:03:22.560> middle<00:03:22.819> and<00:03:23.819> it<00:03:24.090> does

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
track here in the middle and it does

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:27.770 
track here in the middle and it does
work<00:03:24.599> fairly<00:03:25.349> well<00:03:26.180> it<00:03:27.180> gets<00:03:27.299> hung<00:03:27.540> up<00:03:27.629> a

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
work fairly well it gets hung up a

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.680 
work fairly well it gets hung up a
little<00:03:28.019> bit<00:03:28.139> in<00:03:28.349> some<00:03:28.650> spots<00:03:28.979> but<00:03:29.430> I<00:03:29.669> think<00:03:30.629> it

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
little bit in some spots but I think it

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.199 
little bit in some spots but I think it
works<00:03:30.870> pretty<00:03:31.049> well<00:03:31.310> one<00:03:32.310> thing<00:03:32.549> to<00:03:32.729> note<00:03:32.940> when

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
works pretty well one thing to note when

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.659 
works pretty well one thing to note when
you're<00:03:33.389> building<00:03:33.629> this<00:03:33.959> I<00:03:34.769> don't<00:03:35.280> remember<00:03:35.459> if

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:35.669 
you're building this I don't remember if

00:03:35.669 --> 00:03:39.430 
you're building this I don't remember if
it's<00:03:35.790> x<00:03:36.060> 50<00:03:36.750> or<00:03:36.900> x<00:03:37.169> 60<00:03:37.650> it<00:03:37.829> says<00:03:38.190> in<00:03:38.459> the<00:03:38.549> manual

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440 
it's x 50 or x 60 it says in the manual

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.670 
it's x 50 or x 60 it says in the manual
the<00:03:40.440> the<00:03:41.010> number<00:03:41.340> for<00:03:42.120> these<00:03:42.239> you<00:03:42.870> do<00:03:43.169> want<00:03:43.590> to

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
the the number for these you do want to

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.099 
the the number for these you do want to
count<00:03:44.239> when<00:03:45.239> you're<00:03:45.359> putting<00:03:45.629> this<00:03:45.870> together

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:46.109 
count when you're putting this together

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:48.860 
count when you're putting this together
because<00:03:47.099> you<00:03:47.250> might<00:03:47.459> end<00:03:47.669> up<00:03:47.849> with<00:03:48.389> putting

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
because you might end up with putting

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.420 
because you might end up with putting
too<00:03:49.169> many<00:03:49.349> on<00:03:49.500> there<00:03:49.680> if<00:03:49.859> you<00:03:49.919> put<00:03:50.190> them<00:03:50.310> all<00:03:50.400> on

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
too many on there if you put them all on

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.659 
too many on there if you put them all on
there<00:03:50.729> I<00:03:51.659> don't<00:03:52.109> know<00:03:52.349> if<00:03:52.409> the<00:03:52.799> extras<00:03:53.370> are<00:03:53.519> the

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:53.669 
there I don't know if the extras are the

00:03:53.669 --> 00:03:56.780 
there I don't know if the extras are the
same<00:03:53.970> in<00:03:54.150> every<00:03:54.269> set<00:03:54.659> but<00:03:55.169> I<00:03:55.199> had<00:03:55.620> two<00:03:56.040> extra<00:03:56.519> of

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
same in every set but I had two extra of

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.509 
same in every set but I had two extra of
those<00:03:57.030> I<00:03:57.870> counted<00:03:58.560> mine<00:03:58.769> out<00:03:58.919> and<00:03:59.040> I<00:03:59.069> had<00:03:59.280> two

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
those I counted mine out and I had two

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:03.110 
those I counted mine out and I had two
extra<00:03:59.879> I<00:04:00.239> did<00:04:01.049> put<00:04:01.560> the<00:04:01.709> other<00:04:01.889> one<00:04:02.280> put<00:04:02.879> one

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
extra I did put the other one put one

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.349 
extra I did put the other one put one
extra<00:04:03.359> on<00:04:03.689> there<00:04:03.900> at<00:04:04.169> first<00:04:04.500> and<00:04:05.090> it<00:04:06.090> didn't

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:06.359 
extra on there at first and it didn't

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:08.420 
extra on there at first and it didn't
fit<00:04:06.479> right<00:04:06.510> I<00:04:06.989> took<00:04:07.379> it<00:04:07.470> back<00:04:07.560> off<00:04:07.799> because<00:04:08.340> I

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
fit right I took it back off because I

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.879 
fit right I took it back off because I
thought<00:04:08.579> wow<00:04:08.879> two<00:04:09.569> extras<00:04:10.109> of<00:04:10.139> the<00:04:10.409> same<00:04:10.650> thing

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:10.889 
thought wow two extras of the same thing

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:13.939 
thought wow two extras of the same thing
that's<00:04:11.099> kind<00:04:11.340> of<00:04:11.370> odd<00:04:11.549> but<00:04:12.479> anyway<00:04:13.139> that's<00:04:13.709> one

00:04:13.939 --> 00:04:13.949 
that's kind of odd but anyway that's one

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:15.439 
that's kind of odd but anyway that's one
thing<00:04:14.159> to<00:04:14.340> note<00:04:14.519> whenever<00:04:14.879> you<00:04:15.000> do<00:04:15.150> get<00:04:15.299> this

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:15.449 
thing to note whenever you do get this

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:17.020 
thing to note whenever you do get this
set<00:04:15.629> because<00:04:15.720> it<00:04:15.989> will<00:04:16.199> be<00:04:16.320> annoying

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030 
set because it will be annoying

and see this part you can move I'll give
you<00:04:52.180> a<00:04:52.240> bottom<00:04:52.540> view<00:04:52.750> of<00:04:52.900> this<00:04:53.020> real<00:04:53.260> quick

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
you a bottom view of this real quick

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:58.110 
you a bottom view of this real quick
that's<00:04:54.610> what<00:04:54.850> the<00:04:54.970> bottom<00:04:55.120> looks<00:04:55.419> like<00:04:57.030> like<00:04:58.030> I

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.120 
that's what the bottom looks like like I

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.240 
that's what the bottom looks like like I
said<00:04:58.330> you<00:04:58.450> can<00:04:58.690> adjust<00:04:59.080> those<00:04:59.350> you<00:05:00.160> know

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:00.250 
said you can adjust those you know

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:03.000 
said you can adjust those you know
however<00:05:00.580> I<00:05:00.880> guess<00:05:01.360> it<00:05:01.510> makes<00:05:01.690> it<00:05:01.840> easier<00:05:02.200> to<00:05:02.800> go

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.010 
however I guess it makes it easier to go

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:06.180 
however I guess it makes it easier to go
over<00:05:03.310> like<00:05:03.520> hills<00:05:03.940> and<00:05:04.330> things<00:05:04.570> I<00:05:05.070> think<00:05:06.070> it's

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:06.190 
over like hills and things I think it's

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:08.460 
over like hills and things I think it's
pretty<00:05:06.370> cool<00:05:06.520> the<00:05:07.000> way<00:05:07.120> it's<00:05:07.270> designed<00:05:07.470> we've

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:08.470 
pretty cool the way it's designed we've

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:12.210 
pretty cool the way it's designed we've
also<00:05:08.680> got<00:05:08.979> this<00:05:09.520> here<00:05:09.790> up<00:05:10.060> at<00:05:10.180> the<00:05:10.210> top<00:05:10.300> and<00:05:11.220> you

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:12.220 
also got this here up at the top and you

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:14.400 
also got this here up at the top and you
can<00:05:12.400> you<00:05:12.970> know<00:05:13.060> move<00:05:13.210> these<00:05:13.510> around<00:05:13.660> however

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:14.410 
can you know move these around however

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:18.629 
can you know move these around however
you<00:05:14.530> want<00:05:14.740> to<00:05:16.020> so<00:05:17.020> anyway<00:05:17.290> like<00:05:18.190> I<00:05:18.250> said<00:05:18.340> I

how in the middle the part that doesn't

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:25.950 
how in the middle the part that doesn't

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:27.100 
the middle it makes it a little bit

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:29.070
