00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:06.020
 that's the booth booth 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.750
 America 

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:12.900
 now with 11 i would like to highlight 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:15.439
 here is this 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.980
 in this scenario of the marcopolo 

00:00:15.439 --> 00:00:20.250
 volkswagen 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:26.240
 I really liked him and he's amazing that 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:29.460
 seems to remind him more of the 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.340
 815 of Mercedes 901 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.370
 also wanted 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:36.500
 It's worth remembering more and this one here. 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:40.070
 Another cool thing I saw was that 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:42.850
 here is a low floor 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.850
 really enjoyed 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:49.500
 which surely volkswagen it has 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:52.470
 that the computers of them is in the exchange 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:56.360
 on the engine hood, that's what I liked. 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:01:01.420
 of that car that does not come 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:04.550
 there the driver gets very high and the exchange 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:07.910
 a lever has been left larger is 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:11.820
 too dark but trying to show 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:16.729
 if I can show better 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.729
 it is his lever is bigger 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.900
 the interesting now I believe 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:26.300
 in this position the driver does not have to 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.300
 find a lot to be able to change gears 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:33.240
 It's a place from here . 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:37.500
 too dark can see the car he has 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:39.660
 two thousand and floor 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.760
 There is a little bit here and there's another one. 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:43.940
 side blood in the last carrying liked 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.940
 enough 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:52.250
 today we here in the mother's booth 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:55.510
 even being a volkswagen 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.510
 I think that 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:03.050
 It would be interesting to have arrived and pod 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.670
 I adopted this nomenclature, I think. 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:07.320
 that the stimulant of volkswagen that is 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:10.580
 exceeded 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.580
 task left 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:19.580
 were already very old could not 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:24.050
 if already coupled to the year 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:27.410
 that the whole package was adopted 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:31.490
 this guy here I already noticed this 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:34.400
 chassis that it is not manual and already has 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:37.070
 only the clutch brake pedal here 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.380
 Gear change made by this voter and 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:41.840
 garden of the ways of aman patrick 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:45.950
 volkswagen trucks also this exchange 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:47.770
 automatic is in the neutral of and it is I think 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.930
 what 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:51.100
 The cool idea was this is well 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:55.120
 interesting 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:58.690
 now he could very well adopt the 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:00.580
 mann identity in a more 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.450
 effective as the video the trucks 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.150
 of the mother 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.440
 yesterday the super cool steering wheel full of 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.960
 functionality 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:12.130
 I like volkswagen is not stimulating 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:15.610
 simple since you are a mother there I do not know if 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:17.950
 is there something one is a contract 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:20.490
 that I can not do that there is that the 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.490
 rear engine 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:27.680
 Here the rear half shaft and emits 

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:30.469
 here is not appearing much of the 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:34.030
 sambista points appearing more if 

00:03:30.469 --> 00:03:34.030
 truly c of the mother 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:44.450
 the gm is Brazil's largest holding serve 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:48.970
 automatic night box 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:48.970
 at night auditory turbo 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:59.960
 the automatic transmission of the night 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:59.960
 the motor uses one year 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.410
 I toyo ito 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:18.470
 the back 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:22.560
 the same exchange here 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:29.030
 drive and another and rear and head then 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:32.330
 automatic gearbox is also not 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:34.870
 automated automatic and as I said 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.870
 the steering wheel 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:37.510
 For God's sake. 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:41.969
 jack is the handsome but still puffy steering wheel 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:45.779
 how to adopt right then 

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:48.799
 Amman mother's wheel stay here has 

00:04:45.779 --> 00:04:48.799
 pneumatic suspension 

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:01.480
 18 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.860
 280 horses 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:14.910
 as said alina in the specification 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:20.300
 technique he has a night broadcast 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:20.300
 And there's a government afternoon too. 

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:29.180
 It seems like he has a taboo here. 

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:31.240
 I got here in the spec he has 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:31.240
 one 

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.790
 we are studying 

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:41.890
 his specifications 

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.550
 Datasheet 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:06:01.030
 brakes 

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:05.420
 the engine brake and has a delay here 

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:10.550
 eighth integrated material has a promoter 

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:12.680
 Stain the result head 

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:16.120
 primary 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:16.120
 It's the one I showed here. 

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:23.320
 he calls it intarder 

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.320
 this piece here 

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.490
 What she represents was she's the tube here. 

00:06:30.969 --> 00:06:40.139
 It is the same water that generates 

00:06:34.089 --> 00:06:40.139
 engine is something that generates a detail 

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:45.550
 This is it, knowing one more 

00:06:43.449 --> 00:06:49.620
 but a little bit of the fair now at the booth 

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:49.620
 of human volkswagen
