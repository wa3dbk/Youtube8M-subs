00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
back in the old days well I think the

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.410 
back in the old days well I think the
guys<00:01:29.280> are<00:01:29.310> a<00:01:29.579> little<00:01:29.790> bigger<00:01:30.030> a<00:01:30.329> little

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
quicker and certainly much stronger now

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.300 
quicker and certainly much stronger now
I<00:01:33.060> think<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.900> game<00:01:34.140> has<00:01:34.170> changed<00:01:34.590> somewhat

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
I think the game has changed somewhat

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.030 
I think the game has changed somewhat
it's<00:01:35.520> gone<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:35.880> a<00:01:35.909> more<00:01:36.210> finesse<00:01:36.720> game<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:37.590> so

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
it's gone to a more finesse game and so

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.160 
it's gone to a more finesse game and so
those<00:01:38.310> guys<00:01:38.490> who<00:01:38.729> do<00:01:38.880> play<00:01:39.060> physical<00:01:39.390> stand

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
those guys who do play physical stand

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.289 
those guys who do play physical stand
out<00:01:40.350> a<00:01:40.380> little<00:01:40.590> more<00:01:40.829> now<00:01:41.009> well<00:01:41.579> I<00:01:41.909> think<00:01:42.030> I'm

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
out a little more now well I think I'm

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.300

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
one of the dinosaurs from that because I

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.399 
one of the dinosaurs from that because I
learned<00:01:45.030> from<00:01:45.240> more<00:01:45.450> recent<00:01:45.479> a<00:01:45.930> young<00:01:46.110> years

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
learned from more recent a young years

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:46.969 
learned from more recent a young years
and

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
and

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.190 
and
now<00:01:47.220> I'm<00:01:47.310> getting<00:01:47.610> into<00:01:47.700> this<00:01:48.000> high-tech<00:01:48.990> and

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
now I'm getting into this high-tech and

me

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
me

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.539 
me
well<00:01:55.080> Portland<00:01:55.590> has<00:01:55.740> not<00:01:55.920> established<00:01:56.100> any

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
well Portland has not established any

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.490 
well Portland has not established any
inside<00:01:57.299> game<00:01:57.540> whatsoever<00:01:57.869> that's<00:01:58.320> been<00:01:58.470> a

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
inside game whatsoever that's been a

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.929 
inside game whatsoever that's been a
story<00:01:58.799> two<00:01:58.920> whole<00:01:59.070> series<00:01:59.430> they<00:01:59.549> just<00:01:59.759> plan

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
story two whole series they just plan

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.399 
story two whole series they just plan
out<00:02:00.149> that<00:02:00.450> and<00:02:00.750> that's<00:02:00.960> why<00:02:01.049> they're<00:02:01.259> down

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
out that and that's why they're down

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.410 
out that and that's why they're down
race<00:02:02.070> what<00:02:02.369> about<00:02:02.580> your<00:02:02.759> former<00:02:02.909> team

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
race what about your former team

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.359 
race what about your former team
I<00:02:03.450> think<00:02:04.320> Portland<00:02:04.560> does<00:02:04.860> need<00:02:05.130> to<00:02:05.250> establish

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
I think Portland does need to establish

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.430 
I think Portland does need to establish
some<00:02:05.729> inside<00:02:06.299> game<00:02:06.600> I<00:02:06.840> think<00:02:07.140> they<00:02:07.229> need<00:02:07.409> to

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
some inside game I think they need to

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.889 
some inside game I think they need to
rebound<00:02:07.920> and<00:02:08.399> I<00:02:08.700> think<00:02:09.209> that<00:02:09.390> their<00:02:09.630> their

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
rebound and I think that their their

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.720 
rebound and I think that their their
lack<00:02:10.200> of<00:02:10.410> production<00:02:10.770> from<00:02:11.100> their<00:02:11.310> bench<00:02:11.550> has

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
lack of production from their bench has

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.460 
lack of production from their bench has
really<00:02:12.000> hurt<00:02:12.209> them<00:02:12.360> this<00:02:12.510> this<00:02:12.840> half<00:02:13.110> anyway

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
really hurt them this this half anyway

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.350 
really hurt them this this half anyway
does<00:02:14.310> this<00:02:14.400> look<00:02:14.580> like<00:02:14.640> the<00:02:14.880> Detroit<00:02:15.120> Pistons

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
does this look like the Detroit Pistons

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.120 
does this look like the Detroit Pistons
Rick<00:02:15.780> that<00:02:15.930> you<00:02:15.989> played<00:02:16.200> on<00:02:16.230> yes<00:02:16.769> it<00:02:16.950> does

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
Rick that you played on yes it does

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:18.440 
Rick that you played on yes it does
they're<00:02:17.430> really<00:02:17.790> playing<00:02:18.000> with<00:02:18.180> a<00:02:18.239> lot<00:02:18.420> of

they're really playing with a lot of

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:19.729 
they're really playing with a lot of
confidence<00:02:18.930> right<00:02:19.110> now<00:02:19.410> they're<00:02:19.620> bringing

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
confidence right now they're bringing

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:21.020 
confidence right now they're bringing
the<00:02:19.920> ball<00:02:20.130> down<00:02:20.400> low<00:02:20.670> and<00:02:20.880> they're

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
the ball down low and they're

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.699 
the ball down low and they're

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709
