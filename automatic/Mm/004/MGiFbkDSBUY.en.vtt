through<00:02:22.689> this<00:02:22.959> trying<00:02:23.560> to<00:02:23.680> think<00:02:23.980> about

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
through this trying to think about

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.429 
through this trying to think about
what's<00:02:24.549> probably<00:02:24.879> going<00:02:25.060> on<00:02:25.299> outside<00:02:26.110> of<00:02:26.319> the

00:02:26.429 --> 00:02:26.439 
what's probably going on outside of the

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:28.380

school outside of this conversation

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:29.640 
school outside of this conversation
because<00:02:28.540> as<00:02:28.720> you<00:02:28.840> can<00:02:28.930> probably<00:02:29.110> see<00:02:29.290> he

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
because as you can probably see he

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:30.960 
because as you can probably see he
doesn't<00:02:29.860> exactly<00:02:30.159> look<00:02:30.459> like<00:02:30.700> he's<00:02:30.939> a

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
doesn't exactly look like he's a

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.360 
doesn't exactly look like he's a
listening<00:02:31.510> and<00:02:31.689> the<00:02:31.959> teacher<00:02:32.439> now<00:02:32.650> main<00:02:32.890> Nova

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
listening and the teacher now main Nova

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.309 
listening and the teacher now main Nova
and<00:02:33.579> you<00:02:33.970> can<00:02:34.120> also<00:02:34.239> see<00:02:34.569> that<00:02:34.720> the<00:02:34.870> teacher<00:02:35.140> is

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:35.319 
and you can also see that the teacher is

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:36.960 
and you can also see that the teacher is
talking<00:02:35.739> about<00:02:35.799> pizzas<00:02:36.310> grades<00:02:36.670> and<00:02:36.849> he's

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
talking about how he can probably get

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.470 
talking about how he can probably get
into<00:02:38.349> any<00:02:38.620> college<00:02:38.920> he<00:02:39.250> wants<00:02:39.730> once<00:02:40.060> he's<00:02:40.239> left

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
he still learns everything but it

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.530 
he still learns everything but it
doesn't<00:02:53.530> tend<00:02:53.769> to<00:02:53.920> be<00:02:54.220> in<00:02:54.579> school<00:02:54.970> as<00:02:55.120> much<00:02:55.269> and

doesn't tend to be in school as much and

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:56.789 
doesn't tend to be in school as much and
of<00:02:55.599> course<00:02:55.810> that<00:02:56.019> kind<00:02:56.230> of<00:02:56.260> affects<00:02:56.620> his

00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:56.799 
of course that kind of affects his

00:02:56.799 --> 00:02:58.890 
of course that kind of affects his
grades<00:02:57.129> and<00:02:57.310> his<00:02:57.760> relationships<00:02:58.599> with<00:02:58.720> his
