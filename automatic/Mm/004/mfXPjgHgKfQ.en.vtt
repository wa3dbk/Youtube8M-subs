the<00:04:38.370> step<00:04:38.639> honestly<00:04:39.410> only<00:04:40.410> it's<00:04:40.800> not<00:04:40.979> bad<00:04:41.310> but

that<00:05:38.979> okay<00:05:41.169> but<00:05:42.169> I<00:05:42.379> want<00:05:42.409> to<00:05:42.919> talk<00:05:43.039> a<00:05:43.069> little

00:05:43.239 --> 00:05:43.249 
that okay but I want to talk a little

00:05:43.249 --> 00:05:45.129 
that okay but I want to talk a little
bit<00:05:43.429> about<00:05:43.879> the<00:05:44.059> side<00:05:44.299> deck<00:05:44.509> because<00:05:44.809> the<00:05:44.929> side

00:05:45.129 --> 00:05:45.139 
bit about the side deck because the side

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:47.319 
bit about the side deck because the side
that's<00:05:45.259> when<00:05:45.529> extreme<00:05:45.919> to<00:05:46.159> me<00:05:46.249> you<00:05:46.759> know<00:05:46.879> how<00:05:47.299> I

00:05:47.319 --> 00:05:47.329 
that's when extreme to me you know how I

00:05:47.329 --> 00:05:48.939 
that's when extreme to me you know how I
transformation<00:05:47.989> from<00:05:48.049> side<00:05:48.319> and<00:05:48.589> I<00:05:48.619> think<00:05:48.829> it

00:05:48.939 --> 00:05:48.949 
transformation from side and I think it

00:05:48.949 --> 00:05:51.279 
transformation from side and I think it
will<00:05:49.309> append<00:05:49.639> keep<00:05:49.849> off<00:05:49.999> guard<00:05:50.360> this<00:05:51.110> is<00:05:51.259> a

00:05:51.279 --> 00:05:51.289 
will append keep off guard this is a

00:05:51.289 --> 00:05:53.319 
will append keep off guard this is a
possibility<00:05:51.559> it's<00:05:52.369> a<00:05:52.459> really<00:05:52.669> rough<00:05:52.999> side

00:05:53.319 --> 00:05:53.329 
possibility it's a really rough side

00:05:53.329 --> 00:05:54.879 
possibility it's a really rough side
deck<00:05:53.539> but<00:05:54.139> I<00:05:54.169> really<00:05:54.439> think<00:05:54.469> it's<00:05:54.769> a

00:05:54.879 --> 00:05:54.889 
deck but I really think it's a

00:05:54.889 --> 00:05:57.519 
deck but I really think it's a
possibility<00:05:55.279> is<00:05:56.149> the<00:05:56.299> thing<00:05:56.509> about<00:05:56.659> monarchs

00:05:57.519 --> 00:05:57.529 
possibility is the thing about monarchs

00:05:57.529 --> 00:05:59.109 
possibility is the thing about monarchs
is<00:05:57.679> what<00:05:57.949> do<00:05:58.009> people<00:05:58.309> siding<00:05:58.669> against<00:05:58.939> be

00:05:59.109 --> 00:05:59.119 
is what do people siding against be

00:05:59.119 --> 00:06:01.989 
is what do people siding against be
inside<00:05:59.719> a<00:05:59.749> metal<00:06:00.229> again<00:06:01.129> again<00:06:01.550> deciding

00:06:01.989 --> 00:06:01.999 
inside a metal again again deciding

00:06:01.999 --> 00:06:07.689 
inside a metal again again deciding

00:06:07.689 --> 00:06:07.699 
macro cosmos DD crows cards like that

00:06:07.699 --> 00:06:09.579 
macro cosmos DD crows cards like that
that<00:06:07.909> would<00:06:08.029> move<00:06:08.239> your<00:06:08.419> tree<00:06:09.019> holding<00:06:09.319> things

00:06:09.579 --> 00:06:09.589 
that would move your tree holding things

00:06:09.589 --> 00:06:12.999 
that would move your tree holding things
in<00:06:09.709> play<00:06:09.979> so<00:06:10.669> with<00:06:11.449> that<00:06:11.719> might<00:06:12.229> as<00:06:12.319> well<00:06:12.469> well

00:06:18.519 --> 00:06:18.529 
macrocosmos in the bottle and their

00:06:18.529 --> 00:06:21.369 
macrocosmos in the bottle and their
Scout<00:06:19.339> planes<00:06:19.579> and<00:06:19.969> nudie<00:06:20.029> survivors<00:06:20.779> which

00:06:21.369 --> 00:06:21.379 
Scout planes and nudie survivors which

00:06:21.379 --> 00:06:24.369 
Scout planes and nudie survivors which
are<00:06:21.649> you<00:06:22.039> team<00:06:22.339> have<00:06:23.149> a<00:06:23.179> separate<00:06:23.689> engine<00:06:24.079> such

00:06:24.369 --> 00:06:24.379 
are you team have a separate engine such

00:06:24.379 --> 00:06:27.100 
are you team have a separate engine such
a<00:06:24.409> box<00:06:25.039> so<00:06:25.249> you<00:06:25.279> can<00:06:25.399> take<00:06:25.610> out<00:06:25.759> these<00:06:25.909> six<00:06:26.269> they

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:27.110 
a box so you can take out these six they

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:30.219 
a box so you can take out these six they
will<00:06:27.409> be<00:06:28.269> survivors<00:06:29.269> calkins<00:06:29.869> and<00:06:30.049> echo

00:06:30.219 --> 00:06:30.229 
will be survivors calkins and echo

00:06:30.229 --> 00:06:34.119 
will be survivors calkins and echo
partners<00:06:30.559> and<00:06:31.719> so<00:06:32.719> you<00:06:32.779> take<00:06:33.110> out<00:06:33.259> texts<00:06:33.860> from

00:06:34.119 --> 00:06:34.129 
partners and so you take out texts from

00:06:34.129 --> 00:06:38.109 
partners and so you take out texts from
baylor<00:06:34.399> some<00:06:34.789> swaps<00:06:35.149> going<00:06:35.959> to<00:06:36.139> move<00:06:36.499> in<00:06:37.119> for

00:06:38.109 --> 00:06:38.119 
baylor some swaps going to move in for

00:06:38.119 --> 00:06:40.749 
baylor some swaps going to move in for
the<00:06:38.179> macro<00:06:38.629> ending<00:06:39.129> and<00:06:40.129> that<00:06:40.279> allows<00:06:40.519> you<00:06:40.699> to

00:06:40.749 --> 00:06:40.759 
the macro ending and that allows you to

00:06:40.759 --> 00:06:44.589 
the macro ending and that allows you to
keep<00:06:40.939> going<00:06:41.469> so<00:06:42.469> I<00:06:42.499> really<00:06:42.919> think<00:06:43.129> it's<00:06:43.599> pretty

00:06:44.589 --> 00:06:44.599 
keep going so I really think it's pretty

00:06:44.599 --> 00:06:49.029 
keep going so I really think it's pretty
cool<00:06:44.929> thing<00:06:45.409> that<00:06:45.649> you<00:06:45.739> could<00:06:45.889> do<00:06:48.039> another

00:06:49.029 --> 00:06:49.039 
cool thing that you could do another

00:06:49.039 --> 00:06:50.649 
cool thing that you could do another
thing<00:06:49.339> if<00:06:49.459> you<00:06:49.550> don't<00:06:49.699> transfer<00:06:50.149> ankle<00:06:50.449> sign

00:06:50.649 --> 00:06:50.659 
thing if you don't transfer ankle sign

00:06:50.659 --> 00:06:53.049 
thing if you don't transfer ankle sign
