also invincible from the minions when a

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.119 
also invincible from the minions when a
spawning<00:00:48.840> so<00:00:49.379> it's<00:00:49.530> definitely<00:00:49.860> a<00:00:49.920> very

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
spawning so it's definitely a very

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.799 
spawning so it's definitely a very
useful<00:00:50.280> glitch<00:00:50.730> especially<00:00:51.449> if<00:00:51.510> you<00:00:51.570> want<00:00:51.719> to

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
useful glitch especially if you want to

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.510 
useful glitch especially if you want to
get<00:00:51.899> to<00:00:52.020> a<00:00:52.050> high<00:00:52.230> round<00:00:52.260> I<00:00:52.710> just<00:00:52.949> rack<00:00:53.129> up<00:00:53.280> a<00:00:53.370> few

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
get to a high round I just rack up a few

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.790 
get to a high round I just rack up a few
points<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.629> only<00:00:54.870> downside<00:00:55.079> to<00:00:55.440> this<00:00:55.530> glitch

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
points the only downside to this glitch

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.350 
points the only downside to this glitch
that<00:00:56.160> when<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.430> zombies<00:00:56.730> hit<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:56.940> bottom<00:00:57.270> of

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
that when the zombies hit the bottom of

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.119 
that when the zombies hit the bottom of
the<00:00:57.449> elevator<00:00:57.809> they<00:00:58.109> respawn<00:00:58.500> so

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
the elevator they respawn so

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.260 
the elevator they respawn so
unfortunately<00:00:59.370> it<00:00:59.699> doesn't<00:00:59.850> work<00:01:00.000> like<00:01:00.120> a

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
unfortunately it doesn't work like a

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.610 
unfortunately it doesn't work like a
round<00:01:00.539> skipping<00:01:00.899> glitch<00:01:01.109> but<00:01:01.500> it's

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
round skipping glitch but it's

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:02.959 
round skipping glitch but it's
definitely<00:01:01.800> a<00:01:02.010> very<00:01:02.190> useful<00:01:02.340> glitch<00:01:02.699> if<00:01:02.879> you

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
definitely a very useful glitch if you

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.579 
definitely a very useful glitch if you
wanted<00:01:03.210> to<00:01:03.270> take<00:01:03.420> a<00:01:03.449> break<00:01:03.570> and<00:01:03.960> just<00:01:04.290> let<00:01:04.470> your
