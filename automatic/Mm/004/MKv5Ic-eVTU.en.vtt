something else we want to look at is the

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.959 
something else we want to look at is the
five<00:01:57.719> general<00:01:58.170> categories<00:01:58.920> that<00:01:59.130> we<00:01:59.820> can

chronologically they broke it down by
subject<00:02:40.299> and<00:02:40.420> that's<00:02:41.049> how<00:02:41.170> they<00:02:41.349> compiled<00:02:41.830> it

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:42.069
