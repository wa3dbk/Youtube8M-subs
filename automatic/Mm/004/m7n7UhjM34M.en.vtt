00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:29.369
 for me I realized that I 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:35.560
 they speak of your friendship my heart wait 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:38.590
 and not understand today I realized that 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:41.230
 we are going to me nothing else changes 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:47.290
 Beginning I began to miss each 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:50.760
 moment is like the wind I feel 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:54.489
 but not knowing 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:59.739
 This love is something similar with a 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:01:01.530
 castle that you love me but you do not look is 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:07.690
 like the wind 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:11.350
 when I breathe and gives body life this 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:14.860
 love is something similar with a castle what 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:18.390
 You feel but you cut me man feels 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.390
 that there is something more 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:27.960
 and I realized that we are not friends 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:31.149
 although without thinking I started to miss you 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:35.530
 every moment 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:39.369
 I wonder inside if it 's just a 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:41.590
 secret if there is something with you because we are 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:47.280
 just friends 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:52.840

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:57.929
 see it this love is something similar not us 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.929
 castle that you love me but be 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:07.530

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:11.620
 life because this love is something similar 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:16.290
 with a chapter that you feel but my 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.290
