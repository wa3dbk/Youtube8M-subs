block<00:00:00.780> will<00:00:01.170> be<00:00:01.290> explained<00:00:01.740> in<00:00:01.860> this<00:00:02.040> topic<00:00:02.310> so

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:02.820 
block will be explained in this topic so

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.660 
block will be explained in this topic so
you<00:00:03.149> can<00:00:03.899> see<00:00:04.080> a<00:00:04.110> cylinder<00:00:04.529> block<00:00:04.830> all<00:00:05.130> right

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
you can see a cylinder block all right

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.900 
you can see a cylinder block all right
in<00:00:05.850> front<00:00:06.060> of<00:00:06.180> us<00:00:06.529> that's<00:00:07.529> a<00:00:07.740> slender<00:00:08.160> block

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
in front of us that's a slender block

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.810 
in front of us that's a slender block
okay<00:00:09.750> that's<00:00:10.050> a<00:00:10.200> top<00:00:10.440> view<00:00:10.610> which<00:00:11.610> I<00:00:11.759> am

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
okay that's a top view which I am

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.089 
okay that's a top view which I am
pointing<00:00:12.090> right<00:00:12.509> now<00:00:12.750> are<00:00:13.019> the<00:00:13.349> water<00:00:13.590> jackets

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
pointing right now are the water jackets

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.939 
pointing right now are the water jackets
or<00:00:14.370> the<00:00:14.639> water<00:00:14.849> jacket<00:00:15.330> ports<00:00:15.990> where<00:00:16.770> the

out that's the oil filling port where

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.470 
out that's the oil filling port where
when<00:02:23.530> we<00:02:23.650> pour<00:02:23.920> the<00:02:24.099> engine<00:02:24.370> oil<00:02:24.459> it<00:02:25.180> will<00:02:25.329> be

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
when we pour the engine oil it will be

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.839 
when we pour the engine oil it will be
actually<00:02:25.599> going<00:02:25.959> through<00:02:26.109> this<00:02:26.650> port<00:02:27.040> to<00:02:27.640> all

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:27.849 
actually going through this port to all

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:31.050 
actually going through this port to all
the<00:02:28.090> engine<00:02:28.329> oil<00:02:28.420> sump<00:02:29.459> okay<00:02:30.459> that's<00:02:30.670> a<00:02:30.819> lift

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
the engine oil sump okay that's a lift

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.140 
the engine oil sump okay that's a lift
pump<00:02:31.569> connecting<00:02:32.170> point<00:02:32.739> and<00:02:33.040> the<00:02:33.640> you<00:02:34.120> can

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
pump connecting point and the you can

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.630 
pump connecting point and the you can
see<00:02:34.450> one<00:02:34.989> hole<00:02:35.230> at<00:02:35.680> that<00:02:35.920> point<00:02:36.159> look<00:02:36.310> at<00:02:36.400> that

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
see one hole at that point look at that

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.759

for<00:03:55.840> lubricating<00:03:56.409> it<00:03:56.650> those<00:03:57.010> are<00:03:57.189> the<00:03:57.310> piston

00:03:57.689 --> 00:03:57.699 
for lubricating it those are the piston

00:03:57.699 --> 00:04:00.839 
for lubricating it those are the piston
cooling<00:03:58.299> Jets<00:03:58.750> which<00:03:59.319> supply<00:03:59.949> jet<00:04:00.340> of<00:04:00.489> engine

00:04:00.839 --> 00:04:00.849 
cooling Jets which supply jet of engine

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:04.319

oil<00:04:00.939> to<00:04:01.239> the<00:04:01.930> bottom<00:04:02.349> of<00:04:02.470> the<00:04:02.650> piston<00:04:03.329> actually

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:04.329 
oil to the bottom of the piston actually

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:08.339 
oil to the bottom of the piston actually
to<00:04:04.510> cool<00:04:04.780> and<00:04:05.019> lubricate<00:04:05.459> the<00:04:06.459> piston<00:04:07.349> from

00:04:08.339 --> 00:04:08.349 
to cool and lubricate the piston from

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:13.229 
to cool and lubricate the piston from
the<00:04:08.560> bottom<00:04:09.150> so<00:04:10.259> okay<00:04:11.259> now<00:04:11.829> that<00:04:12.519> is<00:04:12.549> the<00:04:13.000> well

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:13.239 
the bottom so okay now that is the well

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:15.780 
the bottom so okay now that is the well
tappet<00:04:13.959> bow<00:04:14.139> and<00:04:14.319> you<00:04:14.379> can<00:04:14.530> see<00:04:14.709> two<00:04:14.949> holes<00:04:15.340> at

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
tappet bow and you can see two holes at

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:16.589 
tappet bow and you can see two holes at
that<00:04:16.090> port

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:16.599 
that port

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:19.860 
that port
those<00:04:16.989> will<00:04:17.889> have<00:04:17.919> the<00:04:18.430> valve<00:04:18.970> tappets

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
those will have the valve tappets

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.430 
those will have the valve tappets
installed<00:04:20.440> over<00:04:20.709> there<00:04:20.949> and<00:04:21.360> now<00:04:22.360> that's<00:04:23.080> the

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
installed over there and now that's the

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.219 
installed over there and now that's the
bed<00:04:23.950> plate<00:04:24.250> mating<00:04:24.820> area<00:04:25.240> we<00:04:25.539> can<00:04:25.690> see<00:04:25.930> those

00:04:26.219 --> 00:04:26.229 
bed plate mating area we can see those

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:27.150 
bed plate mating area we can see those
bolt<00:04:26.650> hole

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
bolt hole

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.730 
bolt hole
this<00:04:27.790> will<00:04:28.030> actually<00:04:28.300> where<00:04:29.230> we<00:04:29.350> have<00:04:29.560> the

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
this will actually where we have the

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.250 
this will actually where we have the
balls<00:04:30.010> which<00:04:30.250> mates<00:04:30.820> the<00:04:31.060> bed<00:04:31.300> plate<00:04:31.840> with<00:04:32.230> a

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:32.260 
balls which mates the bed plate with a

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:36.150 
balls which mates the bed plate with a
cylinder<00:04:32.650> block<00:04:33.100> so<00:04:33.820> I<00:04:34.260> have<00:04:35.260> almost<00:04:35.710> given

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:36.160 
cylinder block so I have almost given

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.760 
cylinder block so I have almost given
you<00:04:36.310> some<00:04:36.610> idea<00:04:36.940> about<00:04:37.000> the<00:04:37.480> ports<00:04:38.230> coming<00:04:38.650> in

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
you some idea about the ports coming in
