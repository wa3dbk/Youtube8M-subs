different pose perfect dismount let's go
surely<00:02:17.540> we<00:02:17.660> can<00:02:17.810> take<00:02:17.990> this<00:02:18.140> to<00:02:18.290> space<00:02:18.560> we<00:02:18.740> can

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
surely we can take this to space we can

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.320 
surely we can take this to space we can
do<00:02:19.010> this<00:02:19.190> we<00:02:19.610> can<00:02:19.730> do<00:02:19.820> this<00:02:19.970> a<00:02:20.030> little<00:02:20.210> down
