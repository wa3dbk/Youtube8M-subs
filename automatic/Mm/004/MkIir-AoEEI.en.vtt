didn't really like how the original
killing<00:00:11.670> floors<00:00:11.969> AKA<00:00:12.750> was<00:00:12.929> this<00:00:13.259> really<00:00:13.620> odd<00:00:13.950> a

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
folding stock and just looks very

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.250 
folding stock and just looks very
strange<00:00:17.520> so<00:00:18.240> we<00:00:18.330> decided<00:00:18.630> to<00:00:18.750> make<00:00:18.960> the

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
strange so we decided to make the

to<00:00:25.619> say<00:00:25.949> that<00:00:26.340> this<00:00:26.550> is<00:00:26.699> probably<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.180> best

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
to say that this is probably the best

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
weapon in killing for sound effects are

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.610 
weapon in killing for sound effects are
pretty<00:00:38.550> nice<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:39.300> animations<00:00:40.079> are<00:00:40.230> fairly

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
pretty nice the animations are fairly

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.209 
pretty nice the animations are fairly
smooth<00:00:41.840> at<00:00:42.840> least<00:00:42.989> for<00:00:43.260> a<00:00:43.290> mod<00:00:43.530> much<00:00:43.800> smoother

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
smooth at least for a mod much smoother

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:59.240 
smooth at least for a mod much smoother
than<00:00:44.280> most<00:00:44.520> other<00:00:44.700> mods<00:00:44.969> are

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.620 

it<00:01:00.250> works<00:01:00.430> like<00:01:00.580> any<00:01:00.640> other<00:01:00.820> commando<00:01:01.300> gun<00:01:01.480> you

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:01.630 
it works like any other commando gun you

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:05.370 
it works like any other commando gun you
can<00:01:01.750> change<00:01:01.960> it<00:01:02.050> from<00:01:02.110> semi<00:01:02.500> to<00:01:02.560> full<00:01:02.710> I<00:01:04.380> think

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:05.380 
can change it from semi to full I think

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:07.200 
can change it from semi to full I think
the<00:01:05.620> damage<00:01:05.860> is<00:01:06.160> right<00:01:06.400> about<00:01:06.640> on<00:01:06.790> par<00:01:07.150> with

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.210 
the damage is right about on par with

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:12.270 
the damage is right about on par with
the<00:01:07.720> original<00:01:08.200> ak-47<00:01:09.070> in<00:01:09.190> this<00:01:09.310> game<00:01:11.280> nobody

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
the original ak-47 in this game nobody

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.370 
the original ak-47 in this game nobody
seems<00:01:12.490> to<00:01:12.550> be<00:01:12.670> changed<00:01:13.150> other<00:01:13.390> than<00:01:13.600> looks<00:01:13.990> and

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
seems to be changed other than looks and

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:26.230 
seems to be changed other than looks and
animations<00:01:14.980> and<00:01:15.160> whatnot

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240

an<00:01:27.240> extra<00:01:28.170> cool<00:01:28.350> added<00:01:28.710> feature<00:01:28.890> is<00:01:29.100> that<00:01:29.220> when

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
an extra cool added feature is that when

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.800 
an extra cool added feature is that when
you<00:01:29.490> run<00:01:29.700> out<00:01:29.820> of<00:01:29.850> bullets<00:01:30.030> completely<00:01:30.630> in<00:01:30.720> the

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
you run out of bullets completely in the

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.750 
you run out of bullets completely in the
mag<00:01:30.960> you<00:01:31.200> actually<00:01:31.620> call<00:01:31.800> the<00:01:31.980> gun<00:01:32.130> whereas<00:01:32.550> if

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:32.760 
mag you actually call the gun whereas if

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.940 
mag you actually call the gun whereas if
you<00:01:32.850> don't<00:01:33.030> run<00:01:33.120> out<00:01:33.180> of<00:01:33.240> ammo<00:01:33.510> on<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:33.660> mag<00:01:33.950> you

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
you don't run out of ammo on the mag you

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.820 
you don't run out of ammo on the mag you
will<00:01:35.130> not<00:01:35.250> talk<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.520> gun<00:01:35.790> and<00:01:36.500> that<00:01:37.500> normally

will not talk the gun and that normally
doesn't<00:01:37.980> happen<00:01:38.130> in<00:01:38.370> killing<00:01:38.580> floor<00:01:38.730> actually

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:38.910

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:40.410 
has never happened for as far as I know

has never happened for as far as I know
I'm<00:01:40.650> killing<00:01:40.920> floor<00:01:41.130> so<00:01:41.400> added<00:01:42.240> props<00:01:42.510> for

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
I'm killing floor so added props for

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.650 
I'm killing floor so added props for
that<00:01:43.310> that's<00:01:44.310> just<00:01:44.850> going<00:01:44.940> the<00:01:45.210> extra<00:01:45.480> mile

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:45.660 
that that's just going the extra mile

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:55.820 
that that's just going the extra mile
there

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:55.830 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.170 

that's<00:01:56.830> actually<00:01:57.130> a<00:01:57.160> very<00:01:57.430> big<00:01:57.580> pet<00:01:57.850> peeve<00:01:58.060> of

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:58.180 
that's actually a very big pet peeve of

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.540 
that's actually a very big pet peeve of
mine<00:01:58.240> in<00:01:58.540> games<00:01:58.780> wouldn't<00:01:59.260> really<00:01:59.590> the<00:02:00.280> reload

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:00.550 
mine in games wouldn't really the reload

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:02.100 
mine in games wouldn't really the reload
animation<00:02:01.060> is<00:02:01.150> just<00:02:01.300> always<00:02:01.480> talking<00:02:01.840> down

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
animation is just always talking down

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.560 
animation is just always talking down
needlessly<00:02:02.620> it's<00:02:03.610> like<00:02:03.730> there's<00:02:03.970> no<00:02:04.210> reason

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
needlessly it's like there's no reason

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:05.790 
needlessly it's like there's no reason
to<00:02:04.600> cock<00:02:04.810> it<00:02:04.960> there<00:02:05.080> why<00:02:05.260> are<00:02:05.320> you<00:02:05.470> just

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:05.800 
to cock it there why are you just

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.400 
to cock it there why are you just
wasting<00:02:06.040> an<00:02:06.340> extra<00:02:06.580> bullet<00:02:07.410> that's

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
wasting an extra bullet that's

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:09.450 
wasting an extra bullet that's
essentially<00:02:08.800> what<00:02:08.950> you<00:02:09.040> were<00:02:09.130> doing<00:02:09.340> when<00:02:09.430> you

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:09.460 
essentially what you were doing when you

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:10.560 
essentially what you were doing when you
cock<00:02:09.700> it<00:02:09.729> when<00:02:09.940> you<00:02:10.000> don't<00:02:10.149> need<00:02:10.270> to<00:02:10.390> you're

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:10.570 
cock it when you don't need to you're

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:16.730 
cock it when you don't need to you're
just<00:02:10.660> ejecting<00:02:11.170> a<00:02:11.260> perfectly<00:02:11.950> good<00:02:12.070> bullet

thankfully the selector switch is
actually<00:05:20.570> down<00:05:21.020> it<00:05:21.230> would<00:05:21.320> be<00:05:21.410> on
