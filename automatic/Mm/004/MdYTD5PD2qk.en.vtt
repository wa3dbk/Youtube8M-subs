00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 the creation of quotas for students of 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.150
 black and Indian public schools in 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.250
 federal universities still come 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.059
 provoking intense debates in society 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.830
 Brazilian 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.110
 everyone has an opinion on the 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.120
 subject in the second article in the series 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.770
 on quotas we will deepen this 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.230
 discussion showing the main 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:22.220
 arguments of who is in favor of who is 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.220
 against politics 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:30.420
 andré arrives at the faculty of 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.160
 ufmg for another day of class but for 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.010
 enter university 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.860
 the pedagogy student went through a 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.469
 long way after doing all the 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.840
 elementary school in the public school 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:46.050
 tried the college entrance exam three times 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.020
 last benefited by the 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.090
 bonus system for students 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:53.489
 afrodescendentes four years to ufmg 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.100
 adds percentages in the 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.710
 vestibular of who declares himself black 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.770
 or brown and who studied in school 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:06.000
 when it was the third time there was 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:09.210
 announce theory is not a good reflection what 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.460
 also missing this lag that has the 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.430
 Ox will introduce me and I will succeed. 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:17.460
 he insisted at the beginning even as motivation 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:20.520
 the little doctor and obstetrician entered the 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:23.549
 ufmg in the 1990s when there was no 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.710
 bonuses for afro-descendants 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.110
 public education was very dedicated 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.780
 that he has gained a place in one of 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.759
 most disputed university courses 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.610
 new role for your students 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:41.250
 was a nigga there is another colleague 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:43.530
 black also because in 62 - 78 of the world 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.750
 the quota law will guarantee vacancies in 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.240
 federal universities for students of 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.759
 Afro-descendant public schools 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.820
 indigenous students with family income 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:56.939
 up to a minimum wage and a half per 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:00.060
 person will change the profile of the 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.140
 groups but guilhermino nor with funds to 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.020
 new rules 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.270
 What worries me is trying to do 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:10.080
 this policy and not solve the problem 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.640
 of basic education 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.620
 and if this is resolved 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.930
 it was necessary to have a policy of cups 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.120
 is also the argument of the president of the 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:21.209
 private school syndicate of 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.220
 mines only by slowing down and taking focus 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:25.590
 of the problem of basic education 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:28.860
 high school to be strengthened so that 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:31.920
 all have the same for non- equality 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:34.140
 it's only in this dispute for the place in the final 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.299
 but for this social scientist to 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.459
 expansion of quotas and the improvement 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:39.989
 public schools are political 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:42.959
 complementary 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:45.410
 one thing does not exclude the other is possible 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:48.540
 to correct these historical inequalities 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:51.239
 to promote the access of generations that 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.730
 passed the primary school already has a 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:56.220
 but it is also his mother who 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.290
 have the right to form and qualify and 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.200
 entering higher education 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:03.959
 this is one thing to another is of the generations 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.030
 which are reaching children 10 however 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:08.609
 quality primary education 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.560
 this ufmg teacher also sees with 

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:12.840
 enthusiasm the law of quotas 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.970
 he believes that with the new measure the 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.280
 public school student will require the 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.380
 higher education 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.319
 he starts to charge teachers from 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:25.260
 school is experiences projects 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:27.359
 prepare you to have access to 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.940
 I think this university has a 

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:32.790
 very positive effect families spend 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.709
 to follow up more to demand more because 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:37.560
 have this on your horizon 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:39.840
 who criticizes the fat brings yet another 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:44.310
 The argument for the debate will 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:47.010
 level of the technical trainees of 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:49.919
 Federal will lower the level of education the 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:51.720
 and the worst is to download the surveys 

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:52.560
 that are made that are important is not 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.880
 federal 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.220
 several studies 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:58.920
 show that the first experiences of 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:01.590
 quotas in Brazil went very well 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:04.170
 and the quota students 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:06.510
 performance equal to or greater than 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:08.790
 Álvaro do not state they are taking 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:11.340
 the trajectory of the students who were 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:14.160
 benefited by the bowling system 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:16.860
 the rector of ufmg also believes that 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.660
 loss of class performance 

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:21.209
 I think society today will not be 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:23.910
 reached in this company niches 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:25.830
 Mexicans perform similarly 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:27.960
 to beautiful lines 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:29.940
 some even with less skill 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.440
 the largest investment inks 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.300
 I think this is what the differential is 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.250
 Willingness to learn we enter here 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.080
 is such a great opportunity is 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.250
 logical talking will have been remembered that 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.400
 study a lot 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:43.770
 but nothing that my quality of 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:46.950
 university in the controversy of the law of 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:49.770
 quotas a matter concerns all as 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:51.090
 will be the relationship between the 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:54.660
 the other students 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:56.520
 this can create small small areas 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:57.840
 University of interventions where there 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:00.510
 exist 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:03.540
 I worry it's in rooms with a destination 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:06.300
 the lower they are placed they are 

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:09.240
 harassed in college so the 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.960
 which entered into 2000 and which are 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.330
 quotas 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:16.040
 I think it's important to be proud of that. 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:20.850
 to say that if I enter university 

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:23.730
 by means of a measure which is 

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:26.849
 correcting a situation that was very 

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:29.249
 wrong in the country will not be stranger 

00:05:26.849 --> 00:05:31.229
 and there are some generations to come 

00:05:29.249 --> 00:05:33.330
 a doctor's office a medical 

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:35.969
 will not ask if she is 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:39.059
 secretary to the son to address 

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:41.490
 But it's natural I'm here for the 

00:05:39.059 --> 00:05:43.679
 my brother already here is already a reality 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:46.229
 for and also law already help you click 

00:05:43.679 --> 00:05:48.839
 You can enter there too and you do not have 

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:50.459
 not everyone's story and in this 

00:05:48.839 --> 00:05:52.139
 Thursday in the last report of the 

00:05:50.459 --> 00:05:54.059
 series on the copies you will know 

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:58.550
 how universities can prepare 

00:05:54.059 --> 00:05:58.550
 to receive future quotaholders
