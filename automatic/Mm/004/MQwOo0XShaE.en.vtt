00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
DSLR so let's slap this on the camera

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.110 
DSLR so let's slap this on the camera
and<00:00:45.539> see<00:00:45.899> what<00:00:46.050> it<00:00:46.140> does<00:00:46.170> for<00:00:46.350> us<00:00:46.940> alright<00:00:47.940> so

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
and see what it does for us alright so

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.330 
and see what it does for us alright so
now<00:00:48.270> I<00:00:48.300> have<00:00:48.570> my<00:00:48.750> variable<00:00:49.200> ND<00:00:49.500> filter<00:00:49.530> on<00:00:50.039> my

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
now I have my variable ND filter on my

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.569 
now I have my variable ND filter on my
Canon<00:00:50.610> 35<00:00:51.059> f-14<00:00:51.989> lens<00:00:52.020> I've<00:00:52.710> got<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.280> ND

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
Canon 35 f-14 lens I've got the ND

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.520 
Canon 35 f-14 lens I've got the ND
filter<00:00:53.610> turned<00:00:54.180> all<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.690> way<00:00:54.809> up<00:00:54.960> and<00:00:55.140> this

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
filter turned all the way up and this

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.130 
filter turned all the way up and this
allows<00:00:55.860> me<00:00:55.890> to<00:00:56.160> stop<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.879> lens<00:00:57.090> back<00:00:57.360> to<00:00:57.600> f5

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
allows me to stop the lens back to f5

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.130 
allows me to stop the lens back to f5
that<00:00:58.890> means<00:00:59.160> more<00:00:59.969> of<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.210> background<00:01:00.449> behind

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
that means more of the background behind

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.770 
that means more of the background behind
me<00:01:01.320> is<00:01:01.500> out<00:01:02.070> of<00:01:02.129> focus<00:01:02.520> giving<00:01:03.359> you<00:01:03.480> more<00:01:03.750> of

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
me is out of focus giving you more of

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.750 
me is out of focus giving you more of
that<00:01:04.049> look<00:01:04.439> that<00:01:04.650> you're<00:01:04.769> trying<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.250> achieve

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
that look that you're trying to achieve

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.359 
that look that you're trying to achieve
with<00:01:06.030> a<00:01:06.060> DSLR<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:07.380> nice<00:01:07.560> thing<00:01:07.770> is<00:01:07.799> is<00:01:08.130> that<00:01:08.310> I

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
with a DSLR the nice thing is is that I

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:09.740 
with a DSLR the nice thing is is that I
don't<00:01:08.490> have<00:01:08.610> to<00:01:08.790> take<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.119> lens<00:01:09.299> all<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.689> way

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
don't have to take the lens all the way

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.280 
don't have to take the lens all the way
up<00:01:09.869> to<00:01:10.020> f-22<00:01:11.010> in<00:01:11.310> order<00:01:12.119> to<00:01:12.360> get<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.630> shot<00:01:12.869> in<00:01:13.140> a

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
up to f-22 in order to get the shot in a

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.410 
up to f-22 in order to get the shot in a
proper<00:01:13.680> exposure<00:01:13.830> range<00:01:14.520> just<00:01:15.090> to<00:01:15.180> give<00:01:15.330> you

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
proper exposure range just to give you

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.120 
proper exposure range just to give you
an<00:01:15.509> idea<00:01:15.659> of<00:01:15.900> what<00:01:16.080> this<00:01:16.200> ND<00:01:16.560> filter<00:01:16.830> can<00:01:16.979> do

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
an idea of what this ND filter can do

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.100 
an idea of what this ND filter can do
for<00:01:17.340> you<00:01:17.490> I've<00:01:17.820> got<00:01:18.030> it<00:01:18.060> set<00:01:18.360> about<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.780> middle

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
for you I've got it set about the middle

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.260 
for you I've got it set about the middle
right<00:01:19.290> now<00:01:19.470> I<00:01:19.710> can<00:01:20.159> darken<00:01:20.460> everything<00:01:20.939> up<00:01:21.090> and

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
right now I can darken everything up and

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.420 
right now I can darken everything up and
make<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.750> entire<00:01:22.110> scene<00:01:22.619> go<00:01:22.920> pretty<00:01:23.280> much

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
make the entire scene go pretty much

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.780 
make the entire scene go pretty much
black<00:01:23.880> or<00:01:24.180> I<00:01:24.240> can<00:01:25.229> roll<00:01:25.500> it<00:01:25.680> back<00:01:25.950> to<00:01:26.640> where<00:01:26.759> it

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
black or I can roll it back to where it

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.640 
black or I can roll it back to where it
has<00:01:27.000> little<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.450> no<00:01:27.479> effect<00:01:27.960> on<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.200> shot<00:01:28.439> and

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
has little to no effect on the shot and

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.370 
has little to no effect on the shot and
everything<00:01:29.220> is<00:01:29.340> completely<00:01:29.720> overexposed<00:01:30.720> all

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
everything is completely overexposed all

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.160 
everything is completely overexposed all
without<00:01:31.710> changing<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.759> f-stop<00:01:33.420> which<00:01:33.900> means

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
without changing the f-stop which means

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.350 
without changing the f-stop which means
my<00:01:34.350> depth<00:01:34.650> of<00:01:34.829> field<00:01:35.070> stays<00:01:35.400> about<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:35.970> same

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
my depth of field stays about the same

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.530 
my depth of field stays about the same
as<00:01:36.900> you<00:01:37.860> can<00:01:37.979> see<00:01:38.189> nd<00:01:38.549> filters<00:01:38.700> are<00:01:39.030> extremely

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
as you can see nd filters are extremely

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:40.969 
as you can see nd filters are extremely
handy<00:01:39.840> for<00:01:39.990> shooting<00:01:40.259> in<00:01:40.380> bright<00:01:40.680> light<00:01:40.950> or

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
handy for shooting in bright light or

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.490 
handy for shooting in bright light or
outdoor<00:01:41.610> situations<00:01:41.970> they<00:01:42.960> really<00:01:43.200> help<00:01:43.380> you
