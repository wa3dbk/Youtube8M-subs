00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
they're like 25 30 bucks it's an

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:50.110 
they're like 25 30 bucks it's an
external<00:02:46.130> DVD<00:02:46.640> ROM<00:02:47.799> so<00:02:48.799> basically<00:02:49.400> you<00:02:49.940> know

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
forgetting this and this together would

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.180 
forgetting this and this together would
cost<00:02:53.180> the<00:02:53.450> same<00:02:53.660> as<00:02:53.870> this<00:02:54.079> so<00:02:54.440> definitely<00:02:54.650> go

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
cost the same as this so definitely go

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.930
