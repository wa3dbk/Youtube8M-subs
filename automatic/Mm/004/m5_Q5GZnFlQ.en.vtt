got a resolution of 1440 x 900 pixels so

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.190 
got a resolution of 1440 x 900 pixels so
let's<00:02:03.090> get<00:02:03.270> this<00:02:03.390> one<00:02:03.600> out<00:02:03.630> and<00:02:03.869> have<00:02:03.960> a<00:02:03.990> look

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
let's get this one out and have a look

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.859 
let's get this one out and have a look
like<00:02:04.799> i<00:02:04.829> say<00:02:05.189> the<00:02:05.670> real<00:02:05.939> reason<00:02:06.329> I've<00:02:06.450> got<00:02:06.719> this

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
like i say the real reason I've got this

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.869 
like i say the real reason I've got this
is<00:02:07.140> because<00:02:07.649> so<00:02:07.860> many<00:02:08.009> of<00:02:08.160> you<00:02:08.310> have<00:02:08.459> said<00:02:08.729> I

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
is because so many of you have said I

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:12.010 
is because so many of you have said I
can't<00:02:09.509> decide<00:02:09.929> between<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:10.649> 11<00:02:11.160> inch<00:02:11.310> and<00:02:11.700> the

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
can't decide between the 11 inch and the

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.040 
can't decide between the 11 inch and the
13-inch<00:02:13.010> what<00:02:13.610> one<00:02:13.820> should<00:02:13.850> i<00:02:14.150> get<00:02:14.210> what<00:02:14.930> are

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
13-inch what one should i get what are

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.650 
13-inch what one should i get what are
the<00:02:15.140> differences<00:02:15.560> so<00:02:16.520> once<00:02:17.150> we've<00:02:17.360> done<00:02:17.510> this

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
the differences so once we've done this

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.320 
the differences so once we've done this
unboxing<00:02:18.260> video<00:02:18.670> i'll<00:02:19.670> do<00:02:19.880> a<00:02:19.910> quick

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
unboxing video i'll do a quick

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.210 
unboxing video i'll do a quick
comparison<00:02:20.540> video<00:02:21.230> just<00:02:21.740> for<00:02:21.800> you<00:02:21.920> guys<00:02:22.190> that

comparison video just for you guys that

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.220 
comparison video just for you guys that
are<00:02:22.520> having<00:02:22.820> that<00:02:22.940> difficulty<00:02:23.570> deciding

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
are having that difficulty deciding

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.560 
are having that difficulty deciding
between<00:02:24.590> the<00:02:24.950> two<00:02:25.190> so<00:02:26.000> first<00:02:26.270> of<00:02:26.420> all

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.570 
between the two so first of all

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:28.990 
between the two so first of all

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
obviously this one's quite a bit of a

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.420 
obviously this one's quite a bit of a
bigger<00:02:29.210> box<00:02:29.510> than<00:02:29.750> the<00:02:30.110> 11-inch<00:02:30.710> macbook<00:02:31.220> air

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
bigger box than the 11-inch macbook air

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.550 
bigger box than the 11-inch macbook air
it's<00:02:31.850> actually<00:02:31.940> considerably<00:02:32.720> bigger<00:02:33.020> i'll

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
it's actually considerably bigger i'll

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.830 
it's actually considerably bigger i'll
just<00:02:33.830> show<00:02:33.980> you<00:02:34.010> the<00:02:34.400> packaging<00:02:35.120> so<00:02:35.480> obviously

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
just show you the packaging so obviously

so<00:02:50.780> let's<00:02:51.260> open<00:02:51.440> this<00:02:51.830> up<00:02:52.040> and<00:02:52.820> have<00:02:53.030> a<00:02:53.060> look

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
so let's open this up and have a look

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.180 
so let's open this up and have a look
I've<00:02:53.630> actually<00:02:53.900> not<00:02:54.230> owned<00:02:54.410> a<00:02:54.650> 13-inch

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
I've actually not owned a 13-inch

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:56.680 
I've actually not owned a 13-inch
macbook<00:02:55.580> air<00:02:55.760> before<00:02:55.910> I've<00:02:56.180> always<00:02:56.330> gone<00:02:56.630> for

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
macbook air before I've always gone for

just pick it up with and there's the

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.690 
just pick it up with and there's the
actual<00:03:08.810> device<00:03:09.140> itself<00:03:09.620> now<00:03:10.280> I'm<00:03:10.370> not<00:03:10.430> going

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
actual device itself now I'm not going

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.580 
actual device itself now I'm not going
to<00:03:10.760> run<00:03:10.940> through<00:03:10.970> all<00:03:11.660> of<00:03:11.720> the<00:03:12.170> little<00:03:12.380> bits

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
to run through all of the little bits

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:13.750 
to run through all of the little bits
and<00:03:12.770> pieces<00:03:13.160> that<00:03:13.280> you<00:03:13.310> get<00:03:13.550> in<00:03:13.640> the<00:03:13.730> box

and pieces that you get in the box

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.100 
and pieces that you get in the box
individually<00:03:14.630> because<00:03:14.690> we've<00:03:14.930> already

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.110 
individually because we've already

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
breakdown of all of the bits that you

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.290 
breakdown of all of the bits that you
get<00:03:51.740> in<00:03:51.860> the<00:03:51.980> box<00:03:52.510> and<00:03:53.510> now<00:03:53.720> on<00:03:53.990> to<00:03:54.440> the<00:03:54.770> actual

get in the box and now on to the actual
thing<00:03:56.300> itself<00:03:56.500> let's<00:03:57.500> just<00:03:57.709> open<00:03:57.890> it<00:03:58.100> up

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:03.240 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:06.449 

and<00:04:04.240> there<00:04:04.390> we<00:04:04.510> go<00:04:04.540> so<00:04:05.470> like<00:04:05.709> I<00:04:05.890> say<00:04:06.040> quite<00:04:06.430> a

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:06.459 
and there we go so like I say quite a

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:08.760 
and there we go so like I say quite a
bit<00:04:06.700> bigger<00:04:07.030> than<00:04:07.360> the<00:04:07.600> 11-inch<00:04:08.170> macbook<00:04:08.620> air

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:08.770 
bit bigger than the 11-inch macbook air

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:10.590 
bit bigger than the 11-inch macbook air
i<00:04:08.800> will<00:04:09.069> do<00:04:09.190> a<00:04:09.220> comparison<00:04:09.730> video<00:04:10.090> between<00:04:10.180> the

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:10.600 
i will do a comparison video between the

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.660 
i will do a comparison video between the
two<00:04:10.810> just<00:04:11.080> to<00:04:11.170> show<00:04:11.350> you<00:04:11.410> but<00:04:12.340> just<00:04:12.550> to<00:04:12.640> show

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:51.730 
really does feel a hell of a lot bigger

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:54.840 
really does feel a hell of a lot bigger
than<00:04:52.000> the<00:04:52.260> 11<00:04:53.260> inch<00:04:53.380> I<00:04:53.590> must<00:04:53.830> say<00:04:54.010> a<00:04:54.250> lot<00:04:54.490> bigger

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:54.850 
than the 11 inch I must say a lot bigger

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:56.760 
than the 11 inch I must say a lot bigger
one<00:04:55.600> of<00:04:55.690> the<00:04:55.780> things<00:04:55.900> I<00:04:56.169> always<00:04:56.380> preferred

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:56.770 
one of the things I always preferred

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:58.710 
one of the things I always preferred
about<00:04:57.010> the<00:04:57.130> 11<00:04:57.490> inch<00:04:57.640> model<00:04:58.060> was<00:04:58.479> that<00:04:58.510> it<00:04:58.690> had

00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:58.720 
about the 11 inch model was that it had

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.140 
about the 11 inch model was that it had
a<00:04:59.110> slightly<00:04:59.830> kind<00:05:00.160> of<00:05:00.250> more<00:05:00.490> widescreen

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:01.150 
a slightly kind of more widescreen

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.719 
a slightly kind of more widescreen
aspect<00:05:01.389> ratio<00:05:02.110> in<00:05:02.229> terms<00:05:02.260> of<00:05:02.680> the<00:05:02.830> screen<00:05:03.220> but

00:05:03.719 --> 00:05:03.729 
aspect ratio in terms of the screen but

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:05.850 
aspect ratio in terms of the screen but
you<00:05:03.820> can<00:05:03.970> see<00:05:04.210> this<00:05:04.389> one<00:05:04.630> really<00:05:04.870> is<00:05:05.020> a<00:05:05.410> hell<00:05:05.830> of

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:05.860 
you can see this one really is a hell of

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.280 
you can see this one really is a hell of
a<00:05:06.010> lot<00:05:06.130> bigger<00:05:06.310> than<00:05:06.580> the<00:05:06.790> the<00:05:07.330> 11<00:05:07.870> inch<00:05:07.990> and

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:08.290 
a lot bigger than the the 11 inch and

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:10.860 
a lot bigger than the the 11 inch and
probably<00:05:08.830> sort<00:05:09.790> of<00:05:09.850> feels<00:05:10.150> bigger<00:05:10.540> than<00:05:10.780> you

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:10.870 
probably sort of feels bigger than you

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:13.350 
probably sort of feels bigger than you
would<00:05:10.990> imagine<00:05:11.110> the<00:05:11.500> difference<00:05:11.740> between<00:05:12.360> two
