00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.039 

okay<00:00:00.900> so<00:00:00.960> it's<00:00:02.090> booted<00:00:03.090> back<00:00:03.210> up<00:00:03.389> and<00:00:03.689> this<00:00:03.870> is

00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
okay so it's booted back up and this is

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:06.800 
okay so it's booted back up and this is
essentially<00:00:04.890> what<00:00:05.040> you<00:00:05.190> should<00:00:05.400> see<00:00:05.609> so<00:00:06.330> go

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
essentially what you should see so go

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:12.950 
essentially what you should see so go
ahead<00:00:06.930> and<00:00:07.080> log<00:00:07.410> into<00:00:09.740> the<00:00:10.740> main<00:00:10.980> media<00:00:11.960> user

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
ahead and log into the main media user

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.589 
ahead and log into the main media user
there<00:00:13.170> so<00:00:13.799> this<00:00:14.130> will<00:00:14.370> boot<00:00:14.639> up<00:00:14.790> so<00:00:15.450> we're

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
there so this will boot up so we're

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.109 
there so this will boot up so we're
going<00:00:15.719> to<00:00:15.809> go<00:00:15.929> through<00:00:16.320> a<00:00:17.130> couple<00:00:17.699> of<00:00:17.940> little

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
going to go through a couple of little

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.210 
going to go through a couple of little
things<00:00:18.510> and<00:00:19.320> then<00:00:19.470> we're<00:00:19.680> going<00:00:19.800> to<00:00:19.859> have<00:00:20.010> to

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
things and then we're going to have to

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.849 
things and then we're going to have to
do<00:00:20.820> another<00:00:21.170> reboot<00:00:22.939> but<00:00:24.109> this<00:00:25.109> time<00:00:25.410> go<00:00:25.800> to

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
do another reboot but this time go to

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.339 
do another reboot but this time go to
start<00:00:26.400> going<00:00:27.060> to<00:00:27.210> run<00:00:27.510> and<00:00:28.140> type<00:00:29.070> in<00:00:29.340> there

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:30.349 
start going to run and type in there

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:36.760 
start going to run and type in there
exactly<00:00:31.349> that<00:00:31.730> control<00:00:33.290> user<00:00:34.290> passwords<00:00:35.100> to

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:36.770 
exactly that control user passwords to

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.729 
exactly that control user passwords to
click<00:00:37.770> OK<00:00:38.510> you<00:00:39.510> should<00:00:39.690> sum<00:00:39.960> up<00:00:40.079> with<00:00:40.230> this<00:00:40.440> so

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
click OK you should sum up with this so

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.360 
click OK you should sum up with this so
what<00:00:41.670> we<00:00:41.790> want<00:00:41.940> to<00:00:42.030> do<00:00:42.120> here<00:00:42.600> is<00:00:42.989> it<00:00:43.649> says<00:00:43.680> users

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
what we want to do here is it says users

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.310 
what we want to do here is it says users
must<00:00:44.610> enter<00:00:44.969> username<00:00:45.300> and<00:00:45.420> password<00:00:45.600> to<00:00:46.110> use

must enter username and password to use

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.139 
must enter username and password to use
this<00:00:46.469> computer<00:00:46.890> so<00:00:47.640> what<00:00:47.789> we're<00:00:47.879> going<00:00:47.969> to<00:00:48.059> do

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
this computer so what we're going to do

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.310 
this computer so what we're going to do
is<00:00:48.270> uncheck<00:00:48.570> that<00:00:49.370> when<00:00:50.370> you<00:00:50.460> hit<00:00:50.610> apply<00:00:51.320> it's

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
is uncheck that when you hit apply it's

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.150 
is uncheck that when you hit apply it's
going<00:00:52.500> to<00:00:52.559> ask<00:00:52.739> for<00:00:53.210> the<00:00:54.530> it<00:00:55.530> says<00:00:55.710> here<00:00:55.980> you

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
going to ask for the it says here you

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.160 
going to ask for the it says here you
can<00:00:56.309> set<00:00:56.489> up<00:00:56.520> so<00:00:57.090> that<00:00:57.120> users<00:00:57.570> do<00:00:57.719> not<00:00:57.750> have<00:00:58.079> to

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
can set up so that users do not have to

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.729 
can set up so that users do not have to
type<00:00:58.379> in<00:00:58.530> your<00:00:58.559> login<00:00:58.859> this<00:00:59.190> will<00:00:59.370> specify<00:00:59.640> a

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:00.739

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
when you boot up is that instead of that

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.190 
when you boot up is that instead of that
login<00:01:17.909> screen<00:01:18.330> it'll<00:01:18.659> automatically

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
login screen it'll automatically

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.550 
login screen it'll automatically
straight<00:01:19.590> boot<00:01:20.280> into<00:01:20.549> Windows<00:01:21.000> with<00:01:21.750> that

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
straight boot into Windows with that

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.520 
straight boot into Windows with that
