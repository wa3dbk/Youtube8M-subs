00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.719 
it worked pretty good it did not strip
my<00:01:13.049> hair<00:01:13.350> but<00:01:13.530> I<00:01:13.560> wouldn't<00:01:13.890> use<00:01:13.950> this<00:01:14.220> on<00:01:14.460> a

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
my hair but I wouldn't use this on a

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.670 
my hair but I wouldn't use this on a
weekly<00:01:15.689> basis<00:01:16.049> just<00:01:16.259> because<00:01:16.470> I've<00:01:16.560> been

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
weekly basis just because I've been

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:17.929 
weekly basis just because I've been
trying<00:01:16.860> to<00:01:16.920> co<00:01:17.070> wash<00:01:17.280> my<00:01:17.460> hair<00:01:17.610> a<00:01:17.640> little<00:01:17.759> bit

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
trying to co wash my hair a little bit

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.789 
trying to co wash my hair a little bit
more<00:01:18.210> so<00:01:18.540> I<00:01:18.720> probably<00:01:19.049> wouldn't<00:01:19.470> use<00:01:19.500> this<00:01:19.650> on

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
more so I probably wouldn't use this on

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.649 
more so I probably wouldn't use this on
a<00:01:19.830> weekly<00:01:20.159> basis<00:01:20.490> but<00:01:20.640> it<00:01:20.759> was<00:01:21.030> a<00:01:21.060> good<00:01:21.299> shampoo

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
a weekly basis but it was a good shampoo

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.359 
a weekly basis but it was a good shampoo
and<00:01:21.810> I<00:01:21.869> will<00:01:22.049> use<00:01:22.290> it<00:01:22.439> again<00:01:22.650> if<00:01:22.860> I<00:01:22.950> ever<00:01:23.100> need

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
and I will use it again if I ever need

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.070 
and I will use it again if I ever need
to<00:01:23.460> clarify<00:01:23.759> because<00:01:24.150> it<00:01:24.659> does<00:01:24.780> contain

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
to clarify because it does contain

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.899 
to clarify because it does contain

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.870 
actually will be purchasing the full
size<00:03:04.500> of<00:03:04.620> this<00:03:04.769> conditioner<00:03:05.310> just<00:03:05.340> because<00:03:05.760> it

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
size of this conditioner just because it

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.880 
size of this conditioner just because it
was<00:03:06.000> so<00:03:06.209> good<00:03:06.420> I'm<00:03:06.840> not<00:03:07.079> giving<00:03:07.410> up<00:03:07.440> on<00:03:07.560> my<00:03:07.650> vol

was so good I'm not giving up on my vol
5<00:03:08.099> but<00:03:08.400> I<00:03:08.430> think<00:03:08.760> that<00:03:08.910> for<00:03:09.090> rinse<00:03:09.299> out

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
5 but I think that for rinse out

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.449 
5 but I think that for rinse out
conditioning<00:03:10.019> I<00:03:10.170> will<00:03:10.410> start<00:03:10.709> using<00:03:10.890> this<00:03:11.190> I

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:12.979 
conditioning I will start using this I
probably<00:03:11.880> wouldn't<00:03:12.239> use<00:03:12.360> it<00:03:12.450> as<00:03:12.540> a<00:03:12.599> co-wash

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
probably wouldn't use it as a co-wash

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:15.050 
probably wouldn't use it as a co-wash
just<00:03:13.319> because<00:03:13.560> of<00:03:13.680> the<00:03:13.739> fact<00:03:13.890> that<00:03:14.069> um<00:03:14.459> I

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
just because of the fact that um I

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.819 
just because of the fact that um I
generally<00:03:15.900> like<00:03:16.049> looks<00:03:16.290> if<00:03:16.410> I<00:03:16.590> find<00:03:16.799> a

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:16.829

it's really really moisturizing I'd like

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.280 
it's really really moisturizing I'd like
to<00:03:20.430> use<00:03:20.519> a<00:03:20.700> cheaper<00:03:21.239> conditioner<00:03:21.870> like<00:03:22.230> a

really really like dirt cheap

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.069 
really really like dirt cheap
conditioner<00:03:24.030> for<00:03:24.150> co-washing<00:03:24.480> since<00:03:24.780> I<00:03:24.870> do<00:03:24.930> it

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079 
conditioner for co-washing since I do it

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:26.990

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
multiple times a week I just I don't

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.280 
multiple times a week I just I don't
know<00:03:27.150> how<00:03:27.209> much<00:03:27.450> this<00:03:27.569> is<00:03:27.720> in<00:03:27.750> the<00:03:27.930> store<00:03:28.139> but

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:29.639 
I'm estimating that it's anywhere from

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:31.370 
I'm estimating that it's anywhere from
five<00:03:29.850> to<00:03:30.000> ten<00:03:30.150> dollars<00:03:30.269> because<00:03:30.930> Pantene

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
five to ten dollars because Pantene

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:32.960 
five to ten dollars because Pantene

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
range they're not really dirt cheap like

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.860
