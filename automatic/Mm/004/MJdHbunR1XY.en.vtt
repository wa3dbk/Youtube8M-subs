another<00:00:12.510> used<00:00:13.020> car<00:00:13.290> review<00:00:13.740> in<00:00:13.980> this<00:00:14.610> video

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
another used car review in this video

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:16.700 
another used car review in this video
I'm<00:00:15.390> going<00:00:15.570> to<00:00:15.660> talk<00:00:15.840> about<00:00:15.870> the<00:00:16.380> first

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
I'm going to talk about the first

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.519 
I'm going to talk about the first
generation<00:00:17.270> Honda<00:00:18.270> CRV<00:00:18.990> which<00:00:19.290> ran<00:00:19.500> between

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
generation Honda CRV which ran between

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:25.040 
generation Honda CRV which ran between
the<00:00:19.950> years<00:00:21.230> 1997<00:00:22.230> to<00:00:23.000> 2001<00:00:24.000> that<00:00:24.720> was<00:00:24.930> the

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
the years 1997 to 2001 that was the

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.640 
the years 1997 to 2001 that was the
first<00:00:25.320> generation<00:00:25.800> and<00:00:26.279> these<00:00:26.850> cars<00:00:27.150> are

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:27.650 
first generation and these cars are

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:31.490 
first generation and these cars are
incredibly<00:00:28.650> reliable<00:00:29.400> however<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:31.140> years

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
incredibly reliable however the years

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.290 
incredibly reliable however the years
that<00:00:31.710> you<00:00:31.890> want<00:00:32.129> to<00:00:32.250> really<00:00:32.550> stay<00:00:32.970> away<00:00:33.000> from

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
that you want to really stay away from

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.740 
that you want to really stay away from
are<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:33.960> 97<00:00:34.710> and<00:00:34.830> 98<00:00:35.400> and<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.150> reason<00:00:36.570> is

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
are the 97 and 98 and the reason is

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.410 
are the 97 and 98 and the reason is
because<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:38.010> engine<00:00:38.610> had<00:00:38.820> 20<00:00:39.239> less

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
because the engine had 20 less

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.439 
because the engine had 20 less
horsepower<00:00:39.839> and<00:00:40.699> it<00:00:41.699> made<00:00:42.120> a<00:00:42.150> lot<00:00:42.390> of

00:00:42.439 --> 00:00:42.449 
horsepower and it made a lot of

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:45.110 
horsepower and it made a lot of
difference<00:00:42.960> in<00:00:43.080> 1999<00:00:44.010> when<00:00:44.250> they<00:00:44.370> debuted<00:00:44.909> the

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
difference in 1999 when they debuted the

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.670 
difference in 1999 when they debuted the
extra<00:00:45.479> 20<00:00:45.780> horsepower<00:00:46.080> in<00:00:46.379> it

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
extra 20 horsepower in it

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.539 
extra 20 horsepower in it
so<00:00:47.400> this<00:00:48.470> CRV<00:00:49.470> came<00:00:49.739> in<00:00:49.860> three<00:00:50.190> different

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:50.549 
so this CRV came in three different

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:53.420 
so this CRV came in three different
levels<00:00:51.239> of<00:00:51.540> options<00:00:52.019> it<00:00:52.199> came<00:00:52.409> in<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.650> base<00:00:52.920> LX

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
levels of options it came in the base LX

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.619 
levels of options it came in the base LX
model<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.510> II<00:00:54.540> X<00:00:55.110> and<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.769> S<00:00:56.010> II<00:00:56.430> of<00:00:56.699> those

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
model the II X and the S II of those

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.049 
model the II X and the S II of those
three<00:00:57.930> models<00:00:58.320> you<00:00:58.409> probably<00:00:59.070> want<00:00:59.430> to<00:00:59.519> stick

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
three models you probably want to stick

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.219 
three models you probably want to stick
with<00:01:00.360> the<00:01:00.710> X<00:01:01.710> or<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.250> SE<00:01:02.909> for<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.839> simple

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
with the X or the SE for the simple

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.980 
with the X or the SE for the simple
reason<00:01:04.260> that<00:01:04.799> that's<00:01:05.400> when<00:01:05.670> ABS<00:01:06.270> became

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
reason that that's when ABS became

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.950 
reason that that's when ABS became
standard<00:01:07.710> okay<00:01:08.100> so<00:01:08.369> that's<00:01:09.240> an<00:01:09.450> important

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
standard okay so that's an important

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.520 
standard okay so that's an important
safety<00:01:10.229> feature<00:01:10.680> so<00:01:11.390> this<00:01:12.390> car<00:01:12.630> also<00:01:12.899> came<00:01:13.320> in

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
safety feature so this car also came in

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.249 
safety feature so this car also came in
an<00:01:13.680> all<00:01:13.920> wheel<00:01:14.189> drive<00:01:14.250> version<00:01:15.180> which<00:01:15.930> was

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
an all wheel drive version which was

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.310 
an all wheel drive version which was
really<00:01:17.039> quite<00:01:17.670> capable<00:01:18.359> it's<00:01:18.780> not<00:01:18.930> a<00:01:18.960> true

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
really quite capable it's not a true

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.410 
really quite capable it's not a true
four-wheel<00:01:19.740> drive<00:01:20.039> and<00:01:20.399> it<00:01:20.670> doesn't<00:01:20.880> have<00:01:21.149> low

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
four-wheel drive and it doesn't have low

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.889 
four-wheel drive and it doesn't have low
gearing<00:01:21.780> but<00:01:22.439> all<00:01:23.070> around<00:01:23.399> as<00:01:24.329> far<00:01:24.630> as<00:01:24.689> an

00:01:24.889 --> 00:01:24.899 
gearing but all around as far as an

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:26.510 
gearing but all around as far as an
all-wheel<00:01:25.229> drive<00:01:25.560> system<00:01:26.070> it's<00:01:26.250> quite

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
all-wheel drive system it's quite

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.130 
all-wheel drive system it's quite
capable<00:01:27.259> these<00:01:28.259> cars<00:01:28.590> get<00:01:29.009> a<00:01:29.390> lot<00:01:30.390> of<00:01:30.600> miles<00:01:30.899> on

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
capable these cars get a lot of miles on

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.789 
capable these cars get a lot of miles on
them<00:01:31.289> you'll<00:01:31.469> see<00:01:31.740> them<00:01:31.859> advertised<00:01:32.429> with<00:01:33.799> 200

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
them you'll see them advertised with 200

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.380 
them you'll see them advertised with 200
thousand<00:01:35.429> miles<00:01:35.579> and<00:01:35.820> they're<00:01:35.909> still<00:01:36.179> running

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
thousand miles and they're still running

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.929 
thousand miles and they're still running
there<00:01:37.109> was<00:01:37.289> one<00:01:37.710> problem<00:01:38.009> with<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.520> engine

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
there was one problem with the engine

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.959 
there was one problem with the engine
and<00:01:39.149> it<00:01:39.299> was<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.630> exhaust<00:01:40.079> valves<00:01:40.649> and<00:01:40.969> what

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:41.969 
and it was the exhaust valves and what

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:44.120 
and it was the exhaust valves and what
happens<00:01:42.450> is<00:01:42.600> they<00:01:42.719> got<00:01:42.960> a<00:01:43.109> little<00:01:43.499> worn<00:01:43.890> and

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
happens is they got a little worn and

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.719 
happens is they got a little worn and
you<00:01:44.310> would<00:01:44.429> know<00:01:44.759> if<00:01:45.060> if<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.869> exhaust<00:01:46.729> valves

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
you would know if if the exhaust valves

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.999 
you would know if if the exhaust valves
were<00:01:47.880> worn<00:01:48.179> by<00:01:48.479> blue<00:01:48.990> smoke<00:01:49.380> being<00:01:49.679> produced

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
were worn by blue smoke being produced

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.190 
were worn by blue smoke being produced
when<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:50.819> engine<00:01:51.149> is<00:01:51.240> running<00:01:51.509> if<00:01:51.689> it's<00:01:51.899> if

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
when the engine is running if it's if

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.809 
when the engine is running if it's if
there's<00:01:52.439> no<00:01:52.590> blue<00:01:52.799> smoke<00:01:53.100> then<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.460> exhaust

00:01:53.809 --> 00:01:53.819 
there's no blue smoke then the exhaust

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:57.200 
there's no blue smoke then the exhaust
valves<00:01:54.240> are<00:01:54.740> are<00:01:55.740> tight<00:01:56.130> so<00:01:56.939> I'm<00:01:56.999> going<00:01:57.149> to

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
valves are are tight so I'm going to

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.239 
valves are are tight so I'm going to
show<00:01:57.390> you<00:01:57.420> a<00:01:57.780> little<00:01:58.140> feature<00:01:58.679> in<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:59.009> back

00:01:59.239 --> 00:01:59.249 
show you a little feature in the back

00:01:59.249 --> 00:02:02.690 
show you a little feature in the back
here<00:01:59.810> which<00:02:00.810> I<00:02:00.990> find<00:02:01.289> interesting<00:02:01.499> and<00:02:02.130> it's

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
here which I find interesting and it's

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.809 
here which I find interesting and it's
very<00:02:02.999> specific<00:02:03.780> to<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.170> CRV<00:02:04.740> for<00:02:05.340> one<00:02:05.520> thing

00:02:05.809 --> 00:02:05.819 
very specific to the CRV for one thing

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:09.249 
very specific to the CRV for one thing
the<00:02:06.450> back<00:02:06.719> opens<00:02:07.560> up<00:02:07.740> like<00:02:07.979> this

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
the back opens up like this

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.280 
the back opens up like this
that's<00:02:09.740> unlike<00:02:10.220> a<00:02:10.250> lot<00:02:10.670> of<00:02:10.700> other<00:02:11.030> small<00:02:11.480> SUVs

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
that's unlike a lot of other small SUVs

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.729 
that's unlike a lot of other small SUVs
that<00:02:12.950> the<00:02:13.280> whole<00:02:13.780> back<00:02:14.780> hatch<00:02:15.080> would<00:02:15.319> open<00:02:15.650> up

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:15.739 
that the whole back hatch would open up

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:19.240 
that the whole back hatch would open up
so<00:02:16.340> then<00:02:16.580> this<00:02:16.790> opens<00:02:17.239> up<00:02:17.420> as<00:02:17.930> well<00:02:18.290> to<00:02:19.040> get

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
so then this opens up as well to get

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.170
