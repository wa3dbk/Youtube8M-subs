00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:17.050
 theme franchising alexandra gives you 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:20.260
 here a short info about the outfit for 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:23.170
 franchising and afterwards she shows 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:26.610
 some elements from the and writing with 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.610
 her stallion iv 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.820
 So in the decision is worth 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.210
 put on it that one work place 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:39.000
 Fit chooses discreet if possible 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:42.420
 Colors so a pink blouse would be now 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.829
 something inappropriate because of this color 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.110
 certainly not on the ems either 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.739
 So dressing would just be covered 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.019
 sounds 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.930
 say something similar to the hand on the 

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:54.899
 saddles one chooses yes naturtones 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:56.309
 brown gray blue something like that 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.519
 whatever looks good is one 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.259
 leather vest that just comes the ranch 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:02.970
 You can work a bit closer, too 

00:01:01.259 --> 00:01:04.580
 but you have to combine with neckerchief 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:10.369
 not all matter of taste 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:13.860
 a struth in natural tones is also great 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:20.579
 if possible without glitter on am 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:25.409
 Horse riding and coaching 

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:27.540
 also super is usually also as 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.780
 custom kings version because that's not yet 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.310
 so common in the scene is so 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.360
 just something nice for yourself 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.150
 manufacture 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.909
 that simply complicates the whole outfit 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:42.300
 to the kings themselves open up 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:46.140
 these facts boussoufa the slightly higher 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:48.240
 also cut into the cut 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.250
 shades like the outfit you can 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.880
 of course also with the day of the horse 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:56.820
 agree that it's just a coherent one 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:02:00.350
 working outfit from the look results 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:04.280
 just to look good for the judge 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.280

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:13.650

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.800
 even in the higher faster ones 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.550
