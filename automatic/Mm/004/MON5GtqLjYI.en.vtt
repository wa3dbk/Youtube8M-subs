with this so you don't have to buy

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.800 
with this so you don't have to buy
another<00:01:34.860> one<00:01:34.979> that's<00:01:35.790> really<00:01:36.150> nice<00:01:36.299> it<00:01:36.750> is

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
another one that's really nice it is

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.899 
another one that's really nice it is
actually<00:01:37.200> plastic<00:01:37.799> plastic<00:01:38.250> wheezing<00:01:38.729> it's

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
actually plastic plastic wheezing it's

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.569 
actually plastic plastic wheezing it's
not<00:01:39.180> transparent<00:01:39.720> but<00:01:40.650> it<00:01:41.070> suits<00:01:41.369> to<00:01:41.490> the

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
not transparent but it suits to the

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.060 
not transparent but it suits to the
peril<00:01:41.850> of<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.119> device<00:01:42.360> so<00:01:42.600> it<00:01:42.869> feels<00:01:43.350> like<00:01:43.649> the

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
peril of the device so it feels like the

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.160 
peril of the device so it feels like the
same<00:01:44.280> device<00:01:45.000> itself<00:01:45.450> so<00:01:45.570> that's<00:01:45.689> really<00:01:45.899> nice

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
same device itself so that's really nice

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.990 
same device itself so that's really nice
so<00:01:46.829> if<00:01:46.890> you<00:01:46.979> take<00:01:47.100> it<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.369> look<00:01:47.520> at<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.759> device

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
so if you take it the look at the device

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.760 
so if you take it the look at the device
which<00:01:48.299> is<00:01:48.329> the<00:01:48.420> device<00:01:48.750> design<00:01:49.439> is<00:01:49.560> very

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
which is the device design is very

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.039 
which is the device design is very
premium<00:01:50.189> I<00:01:50.310> can<00:01:50.490> see<00:01:50.670> it<00:01:51.450> has<00:01:51.630> got<00:01:51.840> a

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
premium I can see it has got a

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.710 
premium I can see it has got a
rectangular<00:01:52.380> on<00:01:53.220> the<00:01:53.490> top<00:01:54.090> and<00:01:54.240> bottom<00:01:54.390> but

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
rectangular on the top and bottom but

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.899 
rectangular on the top and bottom but
you<00:01:54.780> have<00:01:54.930> a<00:01:55.290> curved<00:01:55.649> surface<00:01:56.130> on<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.490> side<00:01:56.670> so

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
you have a curved surface on the side so

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.399 
you have a curved surface on the side so
which<00:01:57.030> gives<00:01:57.270> a<00:01:57.390> really<00:01:57.600> good<00:01:57.750> convenience<00:01:58.290> to

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
which gives a really good convenience to

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.069 
which gives a really good convenience to
hold<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:58.710> device<00:01:58.829> in<00:01:58.950> hand<00:01:59.340> so<00:02:00.180> so<00:02:00.810> design

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
hold the device in hand so so design

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.810 
hold the device in hand so so design
wise<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.439> device<00:02:01.680> looks<00:02:01.979> really<00:02:02.280> amazing<00:02:02.490> to

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
wise the device looks really amazing to

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.300 
wise the device looks really amazing to
me<00:02:02.909> and<00:02:03.320> you'll<00:02:04.320> be<00:02:04.439> coming<00:02:04.680> back<00:02:04.799> more<00:02:05.040> to<00:02:05.219> the

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
me and you'll be coming back more to the

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.800 
me and you'll be coming back more to the
design<00:02:05.670> and<00:02:05.909> they<00:02:06.119> do<00:02:06.240> part<00:02:06.420> of<00:02:06.479> this<00:02:06.570> review

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
design and they do part of this review

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.150 
design and they do part of this review
so<00:02:07.170> let<00:02:07.590> us<00:02:07.710> keep<00:02:07.829> this<00:02:07.979> aside<00:02:08.220> and

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
so let us keep this aside and

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:14.220 
so let us keep this aside and
we<00:02:09.250> just<00:02:09.460> go<00:02:10.060> to<00:02:10.120> the<00:02:10.390> unboxing<00:02:11.040> so<00:02:12.040> see<00:02:13.230> they

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
we just go to the unboxing so see they

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:15.750 
we just go to the unboxing so see they
also<00:02:14.410> provided<00:02:14.740> a<00:02:14.920> screen<00:02:15.220> cut<00:02:15.430> for<00:02:15.640> this

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
also provided a screen cut for this

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.030 
also provided a screen cut for this
device<00:02:16.000> which<00:02:16.690> is<00:02:16.810> again<00:02:17.140> a<00:02:17.320> very<00:02:17.680> good<00:02:17.830> thing

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
device which is again a very good thing

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.500 
device which is again a very good thing
cause<00:02:18.280> the<00:02:18.400> devices<00:02:18.730> in<00:02:18.880> have<00:02:19.060> good<00:02:19.210> leg<00:02:19.360> last

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
cause the devices in have good leg last

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.840 
cause the devices in have good leg last
reproduction<00:02:20.110> so<00:02:20.590> this<00:02:20.740> will<00:02:20.920> help<00:02:21.160> you<00:02:21.640> to

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
reproduction so this will help you to

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:23.940 
reproduction so this will help you to
reduce<00:02:22.000> the<00:02:22.660> screen<00:02:23.110> scratches<00:02:23.650> so<00:02:23.770> that's

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
reduce the screen scratches so that's

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:24.660 
reduce the screen scratches so that's
really<00:02:24.160> nice

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
really nice

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.060 
really nice
so<00:02:25.060> let<00:02:25.180> us<00:02:25.210> go<00:02:25.450> ahead<00:02:25.660> and<00:02:26.170> unbox<00:02:26.470> this<00:02:27.010> thing

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070 
so let us go ahead and unbox this thing

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:32.700 
so let us go ahead and unbox this thing
head<00:02:27.550> so<00:02:27.820> means<00:02:28.600> think<00:02:28.900> of<00:02:29.050> that<00:02:30.390> yeah<00:02:31.590> this<00:02:32.590> is

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:32.710 
head so means think of that yeah this is

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:34.890 
head so means think of that yeah this is
something<00:02:33.070> I<00:02:33.280> think<00:02:33.940> it's<00:02:34.060> all<00:02:34.390> booklets

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
something I think it's all booklets

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.230 
something I think it's all booklets
which<00:02:35.170> comes<00:02:35.440> with<00:02:35.530> the<00:02:35.620> device<00:02:36.120> nothing<00:02:37.120> in

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240 
which comes with the device nothing in

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.820 
which comes with the device nothing in
there<00:02:37.420> there<00:02:37.720> will<00:02:37.870> be<00:02:37.900> only<00:02:38.170> card<00:02:38.590> I<00:02:38.710> know

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
there there will be only card I know

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:39.570 
there there will be only card I know
it's<00:02:39.010> tough

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
it's tough

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.030 
it's tough
they<00:02:39.760> just<00:02:39.880> think<00:02:40.120> special<00:02:40.600> so<00:02:41.320> that's<00:02:41.740> it<00:02:41.890> in

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
they just think special so that's it in

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.370 
they just think special so that's it in
this<00:02:42.190> cover<00:02:42.610> and<00:02:42.850> if<00:02:43.600> we<00:02:43.750> will<00:02:43.870> take<00:02:44.020> a<00:02:44.050> look<00:02:44.200> at

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
this cover and if we will take a look at

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:48.030 
this cover and if we will take a look at
this<00:02:44.500> you<00:02:44.710> can<00:02:44.770> see<00:02:45.040> this<00:02:45.190> is<00:02:45.340> USB<00:02:45.790> 2.0<00:02:47.040> cable

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
this you can see this is USB 2.0 cable

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.520 
this you can see this is USB 2.0 cable
and<00:02:48.420> you<00:02:49.420> can<00:02:49.540> see<00:02:49.720> this<00:02:49.930> is<00:02:50.080> the<00:02:50.290> headset

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
and you can see this is the headset

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.710 
and you can see this is the headset
which<00:02:51.160> comes<00:02:51.460> with<00:02:51.550> this<00:02:51.670> device<00:02:51.970> and<00:02:52.360> it<00:02:52.600> is

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
which comes with this device and it is

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.740 
which comes with this device and it is
already<00:02:52.990> a<00:02:53.230> 10<00:02:53.500> it's<00:02:53.680> not<00:02:53.710> in<00:02:54.130> here<00:02:54.280> itself<00:02:54.750> it

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
already a 10 it's not in here itself it

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.750 
already a 10 it's not in here itself it
is<00:02:55.780> ordinary<00:02:56.080> headset<00:02:56.500> and<00:02:56.800> if<00:02:57.340> you<00:02:57.460> look<00:02:57.580> at

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
is ordinary headset and if you look at

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.940 
is ordinary headset and if you look at
how<00:02:58.660> much<00:02:58.750> you<00:02:58.840> provide<00:02:59.080> an<00:02:59.200> OTG<00:02:59.470> cable<00:02:59.680> with

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
how much you provide an OTG cable with

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.740 
how much you provide an OTG cable with
this<00:03:00.100> device<00:03:00.370> which<00:03:00.970> is<00:03:01.090> really<00:03:01.330> nice<00:03:01.480> thing

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
this device which is really nice thing

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.750 
this device which is really nice thing
so<00:03:01.990> doesn't<00:03:02.620> it<00:03:02.830> just<00:03:03.070> means<00:03:03.280> that<00:03:03.340> the<00:03:03.640> device

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
so doesn't it just means that the device

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.020 
so doesn't it just means that the device
has<00:03:04.380> OTG<00:03:05.380> compatibility<00:03:06.160> so<00:03:06.610> that's<00:03:06.790> why<00:03:06.910> they

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
has OTG compatibility so that's why they

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:08.370 
has OTG compatibility so that's why they
have<00:03:07.060> provided<00:03:07.450> an<00:03:07.570> optic<00:03:07.870> cable<00:03:08.170> so<00:03:08.350> that

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
have provided an optic cable so that

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.430 
have provided an optic cable so that
that's<00:03:08.890> really<00:03:09.070> good<00:03:09.220> thing<00:03:09.460> and<00:03:10.170> if<00:03:11.170> you<00:03:11.320> look

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
that's really good thing and if you look

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.080 
that's really good thing and if you look
at<00:03:11.590> the<00:03:11.830> charge<00:03:12.160> of<00:03:12.370> the<00:03:12.580> device<00:03:12.820> you<00:03:12.970> could

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
at the charge of the device you could

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:14.880 
at the charge of the device you could
say<00:03:13.209> this<00:03:13.330> is<00:03:13.390> the<00:03:13.510> charger<00:03:13.959> and<00:03:14.560> let<00:03:14.709> me<00:03:14.860> just

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
say this is the charger and let me just

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.040 
say this is the charger and let me just
take<00:03:15.160> off<00:03:15.370> its<00:03:15.580> and<00:03:15.820> look<00:03:16.240> at<00:03:16.360> specifications

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:17.050 
take off its and look at specifications

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:19.830 
take off its and look at specifications
so<00:03:18.010> I<00:03:18.430> can<00:03:18.850> see<00:03:19.030> here<00:03:19.180> is<00:03:19.270> that<00:03:19.300> the<00:03:19.570> device<00:03:19.690> is

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
so I can see here is that the device is

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.170 
so I can see here is that the device is
actually<00:03:20.350> a<00:03:20.560> 2<00:03:20.770> ampere<00:03:21.130> charger<00:03:21.520> so<00:03:22.060> the

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
actually a 2 ampere charger so the

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.420 
actually a 2 ampere charger so the
device<00:03:22.390> actually<00:03:22.630> sports<00:03:23.050> a<00:03:23.200> 4,000<00:03:23.860> million

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
device actually sports a 4,000 million

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.760 
device actually sports a 4,000 million
be<00:03:24.670> a<00:03:24.700> battery<00:03:25.060> so<00:03:25.570> to<00:03:25.930> Amber<00:03:26.230> charges<00:03:26.590> been

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:26.770 
be a battery so to Amber charges been

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:29.699 
be a battery so to Amber charges been
necessary<00:03:27.220> to<00:03:27.400> make<00:03:27.910> it<00:03:28.060> charge<00:03:28.570> faster<00:03:29.080> so<00:03:29.680> I

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
necessary to make it charge faster so I

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:31.770 
necessary to make it charge faster so I
think<00:03:30.190> the<00:03:30.430> two<00:03:30.550> parameter<00:03:31.090> is<00:03:31.300> really<00:03:31.600> good

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
think the two parameter is really good

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.380 
think the two parameter is really good
for<00:03:31.990> 4000<00:03:32.650> meaning<00:03:32.830> of<00:03:32.890> the<00:03:32.980> battery<00:03:33.390> so

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 
for 4000 meaning of the battery so
