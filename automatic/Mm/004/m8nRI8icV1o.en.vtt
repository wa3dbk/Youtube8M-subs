00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.690 

I<00:00:02.179> appreciated<00:00:03.179> someone's<00:00:03.629> video<00:00:04.020> on<00:00:04.700> YouTube

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
I appreciated someone's video on YouTube

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.930 
I appreciated someone's video on YouTube
that<00:00:06.000> showed<00:00:06.180> how<00:00:06.359> to<00:00:06.390> do<00:00:07.160> switch<00:00:08.160> replacement

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
that showed how to do switch replacement

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.999 
that showed how to do switch replacement
on<00:00:09.120> the<00:00:09.150> DX<00:00:09.809> not<00:00:10.110> 8<00:00:10.670> and<00:00:12.500> that<00:00:13.500> gave<00:00:13.830> me<00:00:13.860> the

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
on the DX not 8 and that gave me the

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.349 
on the DX not 8 and that gave me the
courage<00:00:14.670> to<00:00:14.849> try<00:00:15.360> it<00:00:15.420> on<00:00:15.660> my<00:00:15.900> DX<00:00:16.650> 9<00:00:17.039> I<00:00:17.400> broke<00:00:18.090> two

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
courage to try it on my DX 9 I broke two

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.929 
courage to try it on my DX 9 I broke two
switches<00:00:19.369> they're<00:00:20.369> very<00:00:21.859> friable<00:00:22.859> if<00:00:23.310> you<00:00:23.460> put

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
switches they're very friable if you put

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.160 
switches they're very friable if you put
any<00:00:24.119> pressure<00:00:24.420> on<00:00:24.750> them<00:00:24.930> at<00:00:25.019> all<00:00:25.640> like<00:00:27.170> damage

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
any pressure on them at all like damage

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.620 
any pressure on them at all like damage
these<00:00:29.779> in<00:00:30.779> a<00:00:31.170> packing<00:00:31.650> crate<00:00:31.859> and<00:00:32.460> all<00:00:33.329> it<00:00:33.480> did

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
these in a packing crate and all it did

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.180 
these in a packing crate and all it did
was<00:00:33.660> put<00:00:33.989> some<00:00:34.020> pressure<00:00:34.320> on<00:00:34.500> it<00:00:34.559> but<00:00:34.829> it<00:00:34.920> broke

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
was put some pressure on it but it broke

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.590 
was put some pressure on it but it broke
them<00:00:35.460> off<00:00:35.610> so<00:00:37.340> it's<00:00:38.340> relatively<00:00:38.760> new<00:00:38.940> could

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
them off so it's relatively new could

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.180 
them off so it's relatively new could
have<00:00:39.719> sent<00:00:39.899> it<00:00:39.989> back<00:00:40.170> but<00:00:40.469> I<00:00:40.530> didn't<00:00:40.980> want<00:00:41.100> to

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
have sent it back but I didn't want to

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.049 
have sent it back but I didn't want to
be<00:00:41.309> without<00:00:41.579> my<00:00:42.230> transmitter<00:00:43.230> there's<00:00:43.739> a

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:44.059 
be without my transmitter there's a

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:47.569 
be without my transmitter there's a
couple<00:00:45.059> of<00:00:45.149> changes<00:00:45.899> and<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.530> way<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.860> dx9

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
couple of changes and the way the dx9

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.430 
couple of changes and the way the dx9
comes<00:00:48.059> apart<00:00:48.480> which<00:00:48.750> is<00:00:48.930> actually<00:00:49.469> easier<00:00:50.239> the

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 
comes apart which is actually easier the

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.420 
comes apart which is actually easier the
first<00:00:52.440> thing<00:00:52.710> is<00:00:52.890> you<00:00:53.010> want<00:00:53.190> to<00:00:53.280> make<00:00:53.399> sure

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
first thing is you want to make sure

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.830 
first thing is you want to make sure
that<00:00:53.730> you've<00:00:53.879> taken<00:00:54.030> your<00:00:54.270> battery<00:00:54.780> out

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
that you've taken your battery out

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.389 
that you've taken your battery out
completely<00:00:55.469> and<00:00:56.000> the<00:00:57.000> second<00:00:57.660> thing<00:00:57.930> is<00:00:58.399> to

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
completely and the second thing is to

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:08.270 
completely and the second thing is to
use<00:00:59.820> a<00:01:00.149> good<00:01:01.370> number<00:01:02.370> 1<00:01:04.220> phillips<00:01:07.280> head

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
use a good number 1 phillips head

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.850 
use a good number 1 phillips head
screwdriver<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:09.290> make<00:01:10.290> sure<00:01:10.530> you<00:01:10.680> don't

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
screwdriver and make sure you don't

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.260 
screwdriver and make sure you don't
strip<00:01:11.189> these<00:01:11.369> screws<00:01:11.850> on<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:13.320> DX<00:01:13.860> 8<00:01:14.159> they<00:01:14.970> show

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
strip these screws on the DX 8 they show

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.270 
strip these screws on the DX 8 they show
taking<00:01:15.840> this<00:01:16.520> rubber<00:01:17.520> bra<00:01:18.439> handgrip<00:01:19.439> off<00:01:19.680> and

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
taking this rubber bra handgrip off and

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.249 
taking this rubber bra handgrip off and
also<00:01:20.490> taking<00:01:21.060> these<00:01:21.240> off<00:01:21.479> you<00:01:21.689> don't<00:01:21.869> need<00:01:22.110> to

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
also taking these off you don't need to

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.450 
also taking these off you don't need to
do<00:01:22.380> either<00:01:22.650> one<00:01:22.890> of<00:01:23.040> those<00:01:23.220> on<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.790> DX<00:01:24.150> 9

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 
do either one of those on the DX 9

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.969 
do either one of those on the DX 9
so<00:01:26.460> you<00:01:26.520> take<00:01:26.880> out<00:01:27.090> this<00:01:27.420> screw<00:01:27.840> and<00:01:28.110> this

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
so you take out this screw and this

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:34.190 
so you take out this screw and this
screw<00:01:29.400> and<00:01:29.670> then<00:01:30.570> I<00:01:30.600> took<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:31.770> hand<00:01:33.200> antenna

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
screw and then I took the hand antenna

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.679 
screw and then I took the hand antenna
off<00:01:34.500> there's<00:01:34.890> two<00:01:35.070> screws<00:01:35.310> here<00:01:35.610> to<00:01:36.360> get<00:01:36.540> to

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
off there's two screws here to get to

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.609 
off there's two screws here to get to
these<00:01:36.869> and<00:01:37.259> then<00:01:38.070> these<00:01:38.689> smaller<00:01:39.689> screws<00:01:40.290> that

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
these and then these smaller screws that

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.850 
these and then these smaller screws that
go<00:01:40.680> to<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:41.189> main<00:01:41.610> antenna<00:01:41.880> come<00:01:42.600> out<00:01:42.810> and<00:01:43.079> the

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
go to the main antenna come out and the

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.219 
go to the main antenna come out and the
antenna<00:01:44.340> lifts<00:01:44.850> straight<00:01:45.270> up<00:01:45.509> and<00:01:46.049> I'll<00:01:46.170> show

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
antenna lifts straight up and I'll show

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.440 
antenna lifts straight up and I'll show
you<00:01:46.439> that<00:01:46.619> later<00:01:46.680> it's<00:01:47.490> also<00:01:47.640> probably<00:01:48.119> a<00:01:48.270> good

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
you that later it's also probably a good

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.010 
you that later it's also probably a good
idea<00:01:48.509> to<00:01:48.869> take<00:01:49.229> your<00:01:49.759> memory<00:01:50.759> card<00:01:51.149> out<00:01:51.390> before

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
idea to take your memory card out before

00:01:52.020 --> 00:02:00.210 
idea to take your memory card out before
you<00:01:52.110> start<00:01:52.170> this<00:01:52.590> process<00:01:57.710> so

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.220 
you start this process so

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:06.540 
you start this process so
I've<00:02:01.220> already<00:02:01.430> taken<00:02:01.760> the<00:02:02.260> other<00:02:03.260> screws<00:02:03.740> out

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:06.550 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:09.010 

so<00:02:07.550> I'm<00:02:07.610> going<00:02:07.730> to<00:02:07.790> release<00:02:08.119> the<00:02:08.330> antenna<00:02:08.780> and

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020 
so I'm going to release the antenna and

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.560 
so I'm going to release the antenna and
it<00:02:09.110> has<00:02:09.289> a<00:02:09.320> wire<00:02:09.649> in<00:02:09.950> it<00:02:10.070> and<00:02:10.280> so<00:02:11.210> you<00:02:11.270> want<00:02:11.480> to

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:11.570 
it has a wire in it and so you want to

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:16.390 
it has a wire in it and so you want to
be<00:02:11.660> careful<00:02:11.990> that<00:02:12.350> you<00:02:12.530> don't<00:02:15.010> pull<00:02:16.010> on<00:02:16.040> that

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
be careful that you don't pull on that

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:28.740 
be careful that you don't pull on that
too<00:02:16.670> hard<00:02:24.880> so<00:02:25.880> it<00:02:26.030> comes<00:02:26.270> off<00:02:26.540> just<00:02:26.570> like<00:02:26.959> that

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
too hard so it comes off just like that

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.900 
too hard so it comes off just like that
obviously<00:02:29.750> setting<00:02:30.440> it<00:02:30.709> down<00:02:30.740> is<00:02:31.220> a<00:02:31.250> potential

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
obviously setting it down is a potential

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.130 
obviously setting it down is a potential
risk<00:02:31.940> of<00:02:32.600> breaking<00:02:33.470> more<00:02:33.650> switches<00:02:34.420> I<00:02:35.420> found

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
risk of breaking more switches I found

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
risk of breaking more switches I found
switches<00:02:36.680> that<00:02:36.920> fit<00:02:37.510> their<00:02:38.510> RadioShack<00:02:39.260> I'll

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
switches that fit their RadioShack I'll

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.010 
switches that fit their RadioShack I'll
give<00:02:40.459> you<00:02:40.550> the<00:02:40.670> numbers<00:02:41.030> on<00:02:41.180> those<00:02:41.390> earlier

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
give you the numbers on those earlier

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:45.070 
give you the numbers on those earlier
but<00:02:42.350> I<00:02:42.380> also<00:02:42.530> found<00:02:43.160> the<00:02:44.060> switches<00:02:44.540> on<00:02:44.660> digit

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
but I also found the switches on digit

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.500 
but I also found the switches on digit
key<00:02:45.290> which<00:02:45.500> I<00:02:45.650> have<00:02:45.920> on<00:02:46.130> order<00:02:46.489> but<00:02:47.150> they<00:02:47.300> have

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
key which I have on order but they have

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.979 
key which I have on order but they have
not<00:02:47.660> arrived<00:02:48.080> yet<00:02:48.260> so<00:02:49.450> taking<00:02:50.450> the<00:02:50.540> antenna

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:50.989 
not arrived yet so taking the antenna

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:53.080 
not arrived yet so taking the antenna
off<00:02:51.290> is<00:02:51.590> as<00:02:51.770> simple<00:02:52.100> as<00:02:52.220> taking<00:02:52.430> these<00:02:52.790> two

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
off is as simple as taking these two

00:02:53.090 --> 00:03:00.850 
off is as simple as taking these two
screws<00:02:53.480> out<00:02:53.720> and<00:02:57.190> then<00:02:58.190> lifting<00:02:59.260> up<00:03:00.260> on<00:03:00.620> this

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
screws out and then lifting up on this

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.120 
screws out and then lifting up on this
part<00:03:01.220> and<00:03:01.940> it's<00:03:02.870> a<00:03:02.989> little<00:03:03.230> bit<00:03:03.380> tight<00:03:03.680> you

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
part and it's a little bit tight you

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.670 
part and it's a little bit tight you
almost<00:03:04.370> need<00:03:04.700> to<00:03:04.959> but<00:03:05.959> that's<00:03:06.140> how<00:03:06.350> it<00:03:06.470> comes

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
almost need to but that's how it comes

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.110 
almost need to but that's how it comes
off<00:03:07.010> so<00:03:07.370> it's<00:03:08.030> relatively<00:03:08.420> straightforward

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
off so it's relatively straightforward

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.120 
off so it's relatively straightforward
now<00:03:11.120> that<00:03:11.360> I<00:03:11.390> have<00:03:11.750> all<00:03:12.140> of<00:03:12.680> the<00:03:12.799> screws

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
now that I have all of the screws

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:16.030 
now that I have all of the screws
released<00:03:13.670> I<00:03:13.970> can<00:03:14.720> actually<00:03:14.930> separate<00:03:15.769> these

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
released I can actually separate these

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:23.380 
released I can actually separate these
and<00:03:17.380> pull<00:03:18.380> this<00:03:18.530> apart<00:03:20.170> and<00:03:22.060> when<00:03:23.060> you<00:03:23.180> first

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
and pull this apart and when you first

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:25.150 
and pull this apart and when you first
do<00:03:23.690> this<00:03:23.930> it's<00:03:24.170> obviously<00:03:24.350> a<00:03:24.709> little<00:03:25.010> bit

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
do this it's obviously a little bit

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.060 
do this it's obviously a little bit
tighter<00:03:25.549> than<00:03:25.880> that<00:03:25.940> but<00:03:26.420> now<00:03:27.170> it's<00:03:27.440> all<00:03:27.620> apart

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:28.070 
tighter than that but now it's all apart

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:29.830 
tighter than that but now it's all apart
you<00:03:28.340> want<00:03:28.459> to<00:03:28.640> kind<00:03:28.790> of<00:03:28.940> be<00:03:29.120> careful<00:03:29.600> so<00:03:29.810> that

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
you want to kind of be careful so that

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.860 
you want to kind of be careful so that
you<00:03:30.079> don't<00:03:30.260> pull<00:03:30.500> any<00:03:30.739> additional<00:03:31.220> wires<00:03:31.519> off

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
you don't pull any additional wires off

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.569 
you don't pull any additional wires off
the<00:03:32.870> other<00:03:33.019> thing<00:03:33.320> that<00:03:33.350> you<00:03:33.620> want<00:03:33.860> to<00:03:34.040> do<00:03:34.280> is

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:34.579 
the other thing that you want to do is

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:40.360 
the other thing that you want to do is
look<00:03:35.390> inside<00:03:36.610> and<00:03:37.870> if<00:03:38.870> you'll<00:03:39.079> notice<00:03:39.370> I've

look inside and if you'll notice I've
already<00:03:40.610> released<00:03:41.510> these<00:03:42.880> because<00:03:43.880> I'm<00:03:44.030> going

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:44.269 
already released these because I'm going

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:24.270 
can look that up on digit key took me a

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:27.260 
can look that up on digit key took me a
while<00:05:24.479> to<00:05:24.540> find<00:05:25.020> those<00:05:25.290> but<00:05:26.190> and<00:05:26.430> I<00:05:26.910> haven't

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:27.270 
while to find those but and I haven't

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:29.110 
while to find those but and I haven't
received<00:05:27.600> them<00:05:27.870> yet<00:05:27.900> so<00:05:28.110> I'm<00:05:28.410> still

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:29.120 
received them yet so I'm still

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.820 
received them yet so I'm still
anticipating<00:05:30.120> that<00:05:30.360> one<00:05:31.110> of<00:05:31.260> the<00:05:31.350> things<00:05:31.620> that

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:31.830 
anticipating that one of the things that

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:36.140 
anticipating that one of the things that
I<00:05:31.860> had<00:05:32.160> to<00:05:32.400> do<00:05:32.870> on<00:05:33.870> this<00:05:34.530> is<00:05:34.919> these<00:05:35.610> switches

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:36.150 
I had to do on this is these switches

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:39.469 
I had to do on this is these switches
are<00:05:36.330> wider<00:05:36.720> than<00:05:37.169> the<00:05:38.130> ones<00:05:38.340> that<00:05:38.610> came<00:05:38.820> this

00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:39.479 
are wider than the ones that came this

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:44.690 
are wider than the ones that came this
is<00:05:39.510> this<00:05:40.470> is<00:05:40.680> what<00:05:40.860> came<00:05:41.160> out<00:05:41.190> of<00:05:41.400> it<00:05:42.680> and<00:05:43.700> there

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:44.700 
is this is what came out of it and there

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:49.820 
is this is what came out of it and there
are<00:05:44.790> only<00:05:45.650> 3<00:05:46.650> poles<00:05:47.810> as<00:05:48.810> opposed<00:05:49.260> to<00:05:49.380> that<00:05:49.620> one

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:49.830 
are only 3 poles as opposed to that one

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:53.150 
are only 3 poles as opposed to that one
which<00:05:50.100> has<00:05:50.370> six<00:05:51.180> poles<00:05:51.479> the<00:05:52.470> other<00:05:52.650> thing<00:05:52.979> is

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:53.160 
which has six poles the other thing is

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.969 
which has six poles the other thing is
is<00:05:53.370> the<00:05:53.520> stems<00:05:53.910> aren't<00:05:54.390> quite<00:05:54.690> as<00:05:54.870> long<00:05:55.140> and<00:05:55.500> so

00:05:55.969 --> 00:05:55.979 
is the stems aren't quite as long and so

00:05:55.979 --> 00:05:58.640 
is the stems aren't quite as long and so
these<00:05:56.729> rubber<00:05:57.090> grommets<00:05:57.660> what<00:05:57.870> you<00:05:58.050> do<00:05:58.200> is<00:05:58.260> I

00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:58.650 
these rubber grommets what you do is I

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:01.850 
these rubber grommets what you do is I
took<00:05:58.710> one<00:05:59.370> of<00:05:59.400> those<00:05:59.729> and<00:06:00.120> used<00:06:00.510> it<00:06:00.830> inside<00:06:01.830> I

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:01.860 
took one of those and used it inside I

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:03.820 
took one of those and used it inside I
don't<00:06:02.250> know<00:06:02.430> that<00:06:02.640> you<00:06:02.700> can<00:06:02.880> see<00:06:03.120> that<00:06:03.330> or<00:06:03.479> not

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:03.830 
don't know that you can see that or not

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:09.200 
don't know that you can see that or not
but<00:06:04.830> that<00:06:05.370> seems<00:06:06.300> to<00:06:06.510> work<00:06:06.539> out<00:06:06.870> ok<00:06:07.350> the<00:06:08.310> second

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:09.210 
but that seems to work out ok the second

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:12.380 
but that seems to work out ok the second
problem<00:06:09.450> is<00:06:09.810> it<00:06:10.200> doesn't<00:06:10.530> quite<00:06:11.070> fit<00:06:11.610> and<00:06:11.940> so<00:06:12.360> I

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:12.390 
problem is it doesn't quite fit and so I

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:14.780 
problem is it doesn't quite fit and so I
had<00:06:12.780> to<00:06:12.810> use<00:06:13.080> my

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:14.790 
had to use my

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:20.930 
had to use my
and<00:06:15.790> I<00:06:15.880> went<00:06:16.150> in<00:06:16.300> and<00:06:17.880> around<00:06:18.880> just<00:06:19.420> the<00:06:19.660> edge

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:20.940 
and I went in and around just the edge

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:24.360 
and I went in and around just the edge
of<00:06:21.940> the<00:06:22.510> ceramic<00:06:23.140> on<00:06:23.320> the<00:06:23.470> switch<00:06:23.800> so<00:06:24.100> that<00:06:24.280> it

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:24.370 
of the ceramic on the switch so that it

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:26.100 
of the ceramic on the switch so that it
fits<00:06:24.610> in<00:06:24.820> there<00:06:24.970> right<00:06:25.210> and<00:06:25.390> that<00:06:25.540> seemed<00:06:25.960> to

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:26.110 
fits in there right and that seemed to

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:27.990 
fits in there right and that seemed to
work<00:06:26.260> really<00:06:26.320> well

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:28.000 
work really well

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.360 
work really well
again<00:06:28.840> wiring<00:06:29.530> it<00:06:29.650> up<00:06:29.740> seems<00:06:30.130> pretty

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:30.370 
again wiring it up seems pretty

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:31.950 
again wiring it up seems pretty
straightforward

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:31.960 
straightforward

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:37.200 
straightforward
when<00:06:32.800> I<00:06:32.830> get<00:06:32.980> my<00:06:33.310> other<00:06:35.190> switches<00:06:36.190> that<00:06:37.000> are

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:37.210 
when I get my other switches that are

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:39.480 
when I get my other switches that are
the<00:06:37.360> original<00:06:37.900> manufacturer<00:06:38.740> ones<00:06:39.130> I<00:06:39.430> will

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:39.490 
the original manufacturer ones I will

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:42.390 
the original manufacturer ones I will
put<00:06:40.090> those<00:06:40.240> in<00:06:40.650> but<00:06:41.650> for<00:06:41.920> them<00:06:42.070> in<00:06:42.310> the

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:42.400 
put those in but for them in the

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.790 
put those in but for them in the
meantime<00:06:42.600> using<00:06:43.600> this<00:06:43.780> one<00:06:43.990> I<00:06:44.020> think<00:06:44.290> is<00:06:44.620> going

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:44.800 
meantime using this one I think is going

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.190 
meantime using this one I think is going
to<00:06:44.890> be<00:06:44.980> a<00:06:45.010> good<00:06:45.250> solution<00:06:45.630> so<00:06:46.630> thanks<00:06:47.080> for

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:47.200 
to be a good solution so thanks for

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:51.990 
to be a good solution so thanks for
watching<00:06:47.260> and<00:06:48.990> later
