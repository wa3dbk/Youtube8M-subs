00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.639 
the way I'm going to show it to you that
we're<00:01:50.700> going<00:01:50.909> to<00:01:51.000> fry<00:01:51.570> that<00:01:51.600> one<00:01:52.110> with<00:01:52.619> the

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
we're going to fry that one with the

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.539 
we're going to fry that one with the
toil<00:01:53.240> start<00:01:54.240> running<00:01:54.570> garnish<00:01:55.049> so<00:01:55.890> it's

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
toil start running garnish so it's

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.719 
toil start running garnish so it's
almost<00:01:56.850> I<00:01:57.360> would<00:01:57.750> say<00:01:57.930> it's<00:01:58.860> a<00:01:58.979> 70<00:01:59.399> to<00:01:59.549> 80

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
almost I would say it's a 70 to 80

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.139 
almost I would say it's a 70 to 80
percent<00:02:00.000> is<00:02:00.450> complete<00:02:00.869> and<00:02:01.799> fully<00:02:02.250> cook<00:02:02.579> these

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
percent is complete and fully cook these

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.890 
percent is complete and fully cook these
are<00:02:03.390> 100<00:02:03.750> percent<00:02:04.079> full<00:02:04.350> so<00:02:04.649> one

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:04.900 
are 100 percent full so one

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.410 
are 100 percent full so one
now<00:02:05.020> turn<00:02:05.470> the<00:02:05.500> brownish<00:02:06.070> on<00:02:06.280> both<00:02:06.490> sides<00:02:06.790> so

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
now turn the brownish on both sides so

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:08.999 
now turn the brownish on both sides so
what<00:02:07.540> I'm<00:02:07.690> going<00:02:07.840> to<00:02:07.900> do<00:02:08.050> at<00:02:08.200> this<00:02:08.380> moment<00:02:08.440> I'm

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
what I'm going to do at this moment I'm

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.540 
what I'm going to do at this moment I'm
going<00:02:09.310> to<00:02:09.430> dish<00:02:09.640> this<00:02:09.880> one<00:02:10.090> out<00:02:10.270> and<00:02:11.340> ask<00:02:12.340> for

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
going to dish this one out and ask for

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.360 
going to dish this one out and ask for
methi<00:02:13.090> itself

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
methi itself

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.270 
methi itself
Domon<00:02:15.370> doesn't<00:02:15.730> take<00:02:15.850> long<00:02:16.270> to<00:02:16.300> cook<00:02:16.570> at<00:02:16.780> all

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
Domon doesn't take long to cook at all

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.080 
Domon doesn't take long to cook at all
so<00:02:18.280> we<00:02:18.490> need<00:02:18.700> to<00:02:18.970> cook<00:02:19.930> over<00:02:20.290> RB<00:02:21.100> which<00:02:21.880> is<00:02:22.060> a

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
so we need to cook over RB which is a

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.980 
so we need to cook over RB which is a
taro<00:02:22.510> root

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990 
taro root

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.740 
taro root
so<00:02:23.710> once<00:02:23.920> now<00:02:24.580> this<00:02:24.820> one<00:02:25.000> cook<00:02:25.210> I'm<00:02:25.420> going<00:02:25.660> to

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
so once now this one cook I'm going to

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.270 
so once now this one cook I'm going to
put<00:02:25.900> it<00:02:25.990> on<00:02:26.140> the<00:02:26.230> side<00:02:26.440> then<00:02:26.770> we'll<00:02:26.980> prepare

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
put it on the side then we'll prepare

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.250 
put it on the side then we'll prepare
