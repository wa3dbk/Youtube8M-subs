that's<00:02:24.360> spooky<00:02:24.890> what<00:02:25.890> could<00:02:26.100> this<00:02:26.250> be<00:02:26.310> is<00:02:26.700> that

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
that's spooky what could this be is that

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.750 
that's spooky what could this be is that
chimney<00:02:27.390> is<00:02:27.600> something<00:02:28.020> watching<00:02:28.230> us<00:02:28.760> maybe

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
chimney is something watching us maybe

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.270 
chimney is something watching us maybe
and<00:02:30.120> why<00:02:30.240> is<00:02:30.300> there<00:02:30.420> an<00:02:30.510> X<00:02:30.660> here<00:02:31.280> nothing's

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
and why is there an X here nothing's

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.530 
and why is there an X here nothing's
adding<00:02:32.580> up<00:02:33.320> and<00:02:34.320> as<00:02:35.040> you<00:02:35.130> can<00:02:35.340> see<00:02:35.480> i'm<00:02:36.480> still

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
adding up and as you can see i'm still

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.830

reviewing<00:02:37.200> Jesus<00:02:38.100> okay<00:02:40.070> that's<00:02:41.070> not<00:02:41.310> good

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.199 
reviewing Jesus okay that's not good
that<00:02:42.840> is<00:02:43.080> obviously<00:02:43.650> something<00:02:44.100> scary<00:02:44.940> my

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
that is obviously something scary my

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.780 
that is obviously something scary my
guess<00:02:45.780> and<00:02:46.140> this<00:02:46.800> might<00:02:47.010> be<00:02:47.160> just<00:02:47.190> speculation

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
guess and this might be just speculation

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.680 
guess and this might be just speculation
here<00:02:48.090> is<00:02:48.240> that's<00:02:49.110> foxy<00:02:49.790> you<00:02:50.790> can<00:02:50.970> tell<00:02:51.209> because

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.550 
it's red I think and as you can see I
noticed<00:02:57.390> that<00:02:57.480> that<00:02:57.690> might<00:02:57.840> have<00:02:57.989> been<00:02:58.020> foxy

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560
