00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:10.100
 Nicchi 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.100
 no 

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:15.049
 saha him all here clog hand on 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:15.980
 the album cheese dargaud killie 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:17.750
 today we find ourselves all 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.490
 just for tutorial number 3 on 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.230
 the year best test skyrim armor 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.240
 of phase i for warriors we need 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.800
 know for guys there's a sword and 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.689
 we just have the shield in addition 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.949
 that in addition to the normal armor the 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:29.570
 shield that is really different from 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:31.519
 first two tutorial simply 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.800
 so I did not have time to look 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:36.800
 the damage of my sword is to 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.449
 around 56 if I remember 56 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.339
 so to simply but there I am 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:41.660
 spent pickpocking m surpassing 

00:00:40.339 --> 00:00:44.090
 legendary to be able to hand over 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.350
 some points some places and of 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.230
 what we remind you to be able to 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.309
 make this armor format the enchantment 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.440
 simply put to enchant two 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:53.120
 times of course fire enchantment too 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.100
 why have better 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.739
 enchantment of fire on your weapon and 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.000
 after simply having the armor of 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:01.100
 drac is the best weapon of the game in 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.930
 legendary so for that you have to be master 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.399
 forging me I ironed myself 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.110
 legendary forging so now 

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:08.000
 I am more m anyway 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.350
 and so we start right away 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.750
 see the young spiritual magistrate with 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.130
 a sublime soul and so we go 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.780
 will put the soft fire damage that 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.000
 thirty to thirty points that I like 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.709
 even numbers and they make 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.630
 health what will you pay 1 20 

00:01:18.709 --> 00:01:22.009
 point of 200 every time I attack 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.560
 so that's good enough if you have more 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:25.940
 of life that is rare with when you 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.929
 will have the full armor for you 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.459
 remove from the city â€‹â€‹really need to be there 

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:30.289
 go deep but in any case that's good 

00:01:28.459 --> 00:01:32.149
 what are the feet of the warrior and after 

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:34.340
 so we attack the conduct of the course at 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:35.569
 start with the nuuk the device 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.950
 I had a little hesitation so it was 

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:38.810
 a lot a little easier anyway 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.479
 increased so the damage so to a hand 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.150
 to increase from 50 to the spike 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:45.700
 at about 150 6 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.900
 remember well and so we have a lot of 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.920
 stuff to increase my name does not have 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.150
 really actually 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.470
 but I 'm going to put the resistance 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.870
 magic is really the most important 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.340
 magic resistance health reinforcement 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:57.640
 frankly we do not care a bit 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.930
 if we have the magic res here is lady gaga 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.670
 weapons do not do a lot of damage to 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.740
 the act and dragons after with their when 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.090
 their cries of fire that hurt but good 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.710
 Resi magic normally takes in 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.780
 count the dragons so here I 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.920
 recommends 20% resident's magic 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.149
 weapon damage and so I call that 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.000
 the warrior's ring simply 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:15.520
 like the two pros the two previous ones 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.350
 tutorial where I called that the thief mage the 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.430
 warrior scene after we will do everything 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:20.590
 simply the necklaces so is going 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.480
 raise the army again a hand 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.830
 good if you use two-handed weapons 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.990
 hands you increase 1 to tomorrow months 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.240
 for me it is paca and we will increase 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:29.830
 in addition the magic resistance the 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.090
 magic resistance between increased three 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.530
 only once to not go up 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.690
 100% it will be a bit of shit and 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.230
 montpellier up to 60% what is already 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.300
 not bad 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.459
 and so here is the same for the ring the 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:42.490
 health is a bit nil do not increase 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:44.110
 the damage to a low hand on more one 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:46.060
 already done and more normally we are on 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.190
 will say operational announcement 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.350
 maybe the barade yeah we're going rather 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:52.060
 increase the parade need to increase when 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:53.380
 even the parade not this curly budget 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.700
 I use my shield a lot for 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:56.440
 everything that is arrow you are unique 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.110
 increased rather the parry instead of 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.400
 m 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.660
 tears to one hand of this are their 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.430
 grannies hand can be done on other 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.110
 thing the gloves of the is so the horse 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.650
 is all a bit irrelevant in any 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:05.540
 what meaning 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.790
 so this time we increase tears to 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.100
 a hand again and so here we go 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.840
 increase so we look so had 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:14.420
 just not a lot of stuff we 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.580
 see you lie the word if he will do 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.410
 we get to 80% to attack them one 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.180
 hand and 80% for the parry which is 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.650
 more than enough 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.150
 after you can see there are some 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.050
 reinforcements of heavy weapons of which 100 are 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.670
 flexible what am I going to be soon 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:27.830
 master in armor the water so at this moment 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:30.530
 there the reinforcements in heavy armor 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:36.080
 we do not care a bit after we'll do 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:37.400
 so this time the armor there is everything 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:40.730
 simply in armor we will do 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.989
 who look at clapas weapons at a marl 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:45.410
 we do not care they say we are 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:49.400
 we're going to be healthy 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:50.810
 and vigor or health cure absolutize 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.980
 so healing to take care 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.900
 simply 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.700
 so here you have been able to see when 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.810
 I was thieves had done health video 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.030
 if we did not have much choice 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:01.450
 the young troop think I'm going to do 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:03.470
 Health Healing Health Strength I hesitate 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:05.239
 just good I think I'm going 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:06.650
 rather make health force one more of 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:08.810
 force the healing anyway I have a 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:10.310
 magic that is increasing quite rapidly so 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.500
 so that's the armor of the warrior who 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:14.800
 increases 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:16.329
 the vigor does not you have 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.430
 noticed i think like atari there and i 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:20.260
 commented after filming I'm 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:22.020
 remember the device I visited so 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:24.400
 it's really to show that you have to 

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:26.560
 just especially that I passed 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.180
 master and more after doing after 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:31.210
 to have just sing all my 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:32.500
 equipment I went m so that's it 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.950
 so strong healing in fact we're going 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:37.720
 use the healing center instead 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:39.520
 that the life of just keyboards 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.650
 excuse me you have force of way when 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.510
 you are master in armor india referred 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:45.930
 almost more vigor to run and 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:48.310
 afterwards for attacks 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:49.570
 frankly the powerful attacks you 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:50.080
 do not need that to be able to do 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:53.220
 very very badly 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:55.000
 so there we increase again so 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:57.669
 the attacked humans and this way one 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.260
 increases the vigor of the vigor and 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:01.120
 increase on the boots and not on 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.350
 the armor in any case here it is we 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.940
 will learn the warrior's boots 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:05.740
 is going to enchant is so after he misses 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:07.930
 so the shield and the helmet we're going 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:10.090
 start with the helmet is so for the 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:13.080
 headphones in mode simply put the big 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:13.080
 gas which has 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:17.590
 we see that the almost nothing the case it is 

00:05:16.029 --> 00:05:20.819
 really no one will say to ski 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:26.289
 can simply put reinforcement of 

00:05:20.819 --> 00:05:29.289
 healing I think and I do not know anymore what 

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:30.849
 that I had put yes to the 

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:33.580
 faster magic regeneration 

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:35.469
 just to increase my magic if 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:37.150
 when I use the healing boom of 

00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:40.120
 what healings -50% 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:41.289
 if I remember well at least 75 so 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.639
 here I could use some kind of 

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:44.529
 healing much more easily and 

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:45.639
 longer if I have more healthy life 

00:05:44.529 --> 00:05:47.469
 what happens rarely 

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:49.300
 so there yes I quoted on my appetite 

00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:50.650
 had made the necklace or the ring is in 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:52.240
 anyway there so we will end for 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:55.120
 the shield so logically increase 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.469
 the parade is a shield and we will 

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:58.449
 look at what will first increase the 

00:05:56.469 --> 00:05:59.830
 magic then the part to health oms 

00:05:58.449 --> 00:06:00.279
 do not increase health one day 

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:02.589
 widely 

00:06:00.279 --> 00:06:04.810
 and then I resist I resist better to the 

00:06:02.589 --> 00:06:07.240
 magic and more really need a lot 

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:08.889
 of health simply here we are 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:10.150
 complete alarm for warrior so 

00:06:08.889 --> 00:06:12.339
 stay a little tutorial to have the 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:14.469
 best skyrim armor for a 

00:06:12.339 --> 00:06:15.550
 warrior and so you 'll see at this 

00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:18.669
 moment there so the automatic backup 

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:20.409
 so it's been five months 

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:22.300
 a screen bug and that's why it comes back 

00:06:20.409 --> 00:06:24.219
 so at this grade if I have all my 

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:25.990
 tour warrior equipment so I'm there 

00:06:24.219 --> 00:06:28.330
 go all you can already see there the 

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:30.729
 darmian value of 675 which is the maximum 

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:34.210
 and here we have the shield on the sword 

00:06:30.729 --> 00:06:36.699
 you will see the numbers simply 

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:38.560
 normally I show is effective I am 

00:06:36.699 --> 00:06:39.129
 remember you will see that the 

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:42.210
 workforce 

00:06:39.129 --> 00:06:44.680
 here are the keys 150 we went from 152 to 

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:47.020
 159 can see that we almost tripled 

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:48.610
 damage so it's really huge 

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:50.199
 now I see a shot the leaf at 

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:52.240
 the hmr I'm thomas dyck where could 

00:06:50.199 --> 00:06:53.080
 you are now cost management that's 

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:55.240
 really huge 

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:56.379
 that's the magic resistance 60% for 

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:58.360
 to make sickness instances is by 

00:06:56.379 --> 00:07:00.159
 relation to this werewolf dog by 

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:01.810
 report to the healing rega so I 

00:07:00.159 --> 00:07:03.279
 have only two ran 50% less 

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:05.760
 for healing which is pretty cool 

00:07:03.279 --> 00:07:07.410
 and the one hand makes it one 

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:10.530
 the damage of a thin increased 

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:12.630
 only 3 is 120% of what 

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:14.280
 buy at 50 I went to 150 which 

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:15.780
 is largely at the mercy of the 

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:18.260
 videotape makes rotate and approach 

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:18.260
 now
