being<00:02:03.499> pulled<00:02:03.859> and<00:02:05.139> when<00:02:06.139> she<00:02:06.289> first<00:02:06.469> told<00:02:06.619> me

00:02:06.849 --> 00:02:06.859 
being pulled and when she first told me

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:08.109 
being pulled and when she first told me
that<00:02:07.069> her<00:02:07.249> hair<00:02:07.459> was<00:02:07.490> being<00:02:07.759> pulled<00:02:07.969> I

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
that her hair was being pulled I

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.870 
that her hair was being pulled I
honestly<00:02:08.450> thought<00:02:08.660> it<00:02:08.780> was<00:02:08.869> a<00:02:08.929> joke<00:02:09.200> and<00:02:09.880> until

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880 
honestly thought it was a joke and until

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.880 
honestly thought it was a joke and until
I<00:02:10.910> actually<00:02:11.390> heard<00:02:11.870> it<00:02:12.020> then<00:02:12.230> I<00:02:12.319> realized<00:02:12.680> it

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
I actually heard it then I realized it

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.670 
I actually heard it then I realized it
was<00:02:12.920> it<00:02:13.340> was<00:02:13.520> real<00:02:13.990> this<00:02:14.990> is<00:02:15.230> a<00:02:15.260> data

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
was it was real this is a data

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.610 
was it was real this is a data
acquisition<00:02:15.860> device<00:02:16.870> basically<00:02:17.870> we<00:02:18.260> set<00:02:18.470> this

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
acquisition device basically we set this

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.430 
acquisition device basically we set this
up<00:02:18.830> to<00:02:18.980> measure<00:02:19.130> temperature<00:02:19.459> and<00:02:19.850> humidity

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
up to measure temperature and humidity

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.020 
up to measure temperature and humidity
for<00:02:21.440> the<00:02:21.500> house<00:02:21.709> it<00:02:22.190> records<00:02:22.580> every<00:02:22.819> 10

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
for the house it records every 10

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.850 
for the house it records every 10
seconds<00:02:23.540> so<00:02:23.780> we<00:02:23.870> can<00:02:23.990> how<00:02:24.080> to<00:02:24.140> get<00:02:24.290> a<00:02:24.319> baseline

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
seconds so we can how to get a baseline

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.880 
seconds so we can how to get a baseline
of<00:02:25.130> of<00:02:25.970> our<00:02:26.209> environment<00:02:26.750> it<00:02:27.290> helps<00:02:27.380> us<00:02:27.620> keep<00:02:27.740> a

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
of of our environment it helps us keep a

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.809 
of of our environment it helps us keep a
controlled<00:02:28.250> condition<00:02:28.670> in<00:02:28.790> the<00:02:29.150> home<00:02:30.819> since

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:31.819 
controlled condition in the home since

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:33.130 
controlled condition in the home since
we're<00:02:32.000> doing<00:02:32.150> mostly<00:02:32.390> investigation<00:02:32.990> tonight

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
we're doing mostly investigation tonight

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:34.900 
we're doing mostly investigation tonight
up<00:02:33.380> here<00:02:33.650> in<00:02:33.830> the<00:02:33.950> upper<00:02:34.160> floor<00:02:34.430> where<00:02:34.730> we<00:02:34.819> had

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
up here in the upper floor where we had

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.320 
up here in the upper floor where we had
the<00:02:35.000> most<00:02:35.030> activity<00:02:35.390> last<00:02:35.750> time

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
the most activity last time

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.300 
the most activity last time
we'll<00:02:38.170> make<00:02:38.440> sure<00:02:38.500> that<00:02:38.800> we<00:02:38.920> have<00:02:39.010> the<00:02:39.100> control

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
we'll make sure that we have the control

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.100 
we'll make sure that we have the control
environment<00:02:39.580> here<00:02:40.030> and<00:02:40.180> that's<00:02:40.420> the<00:02:40.870> reason

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
environment here and that's the reason

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:44.370 
environment here and that's the reason
for<00:02:41.140> the<00:02:41.290> data<00:02:41.470> logger<00:02:42.570> it<00:02:43.570> keeps<00:02:43.810> us<00:02:43.990> honest

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
for the data logger it keeps us honest

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.100 
for the data logger it keeps us honest

what's<00:03:17.200> significant<00:03:17.830> what's<00:03:18.040> not<00:03:18.250> a<00:03:18.610> lot<00:03:19.510> of

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
what's significant what's not a lot of

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.440 
what's significant what's not a lot of
the<00:03:19.750> answers<00:03:20.140> can<00:03:20.380> be<00:03:20.440> determined<00:03:21.330> when<00:03:22.330> we

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
the answers can be determined when we

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.240 
the answers can be determined when we
first<00:03:22.690> get<00:03:22.840> to<00:03:22.990> the<00:03:23.080> place<00:03:23.290> when<00:03:23.740> we<00:03:23.890> first<00:03:24.130> get

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
first get to the place when we first get

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:25.710 
first get to the place when we first get
to<00:03:24.400> the<00:03:24.490> place<00:03:24.670> we<00:03:24.880> do<00:03:25.000> like<00:03:25.240> an<00:03:25.390> initial

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
to the place we do like an initial

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.470 
to the place we do like an initial
walkthrough<00:03:26.400> we're<00:03:27.400> taking<00:03:27.730> notes<00:03:27.940> asking

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
walkthrough we're taking notes asking

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.750 
walkthrough we're taking notes asking
questions<00:03:28.990> kind<00:03:29.320> of<00:03:29.440> determine<00:03:29.950> like<00:03:30.460> where

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
questions kind of determine like where

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.520 
questions kind of determine like where
that<00:03:30.910> we're<00:03:31.210> like<00:03:31.510> some<00:03:31.990> of<00:03:32.080> the<00:03:32.170> claims<00:03:32.380> that

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
that we're like some of the claims that

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.170 
that we're like some of the claims that
the<00:03:32.680> clients<00:03:33.040> were<00:03:33.160> seeing<00:03:33.640> what's<00:03:33.820> going<00:03:34.000> on

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
the clients were seeing what's going on

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.840 
the clients were seeing what's going on
and<00:03:34.360> kind<00:03:34.480> of<00:03:34.630> determine<00:03:35.020> okay<00:03:35.400> that<00:03:36.400> they

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
and kind of determine okay that they

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:38.820 
and kind of determine okay that they
said<00:03:37.060> this<00:03:37.300> well<00:03:37.570> okay<00:03:37.990> this<00:03:38.290> is<00:03:38.440> what's<00:03:38.650> going

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:38.830 
said this well okay this is what's going

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:41.430 
said this well okay this is what's going
on<00:03:39.270> so<00:03:40.270> a<00:03:40.330> lot<00:03:40.480> of<00:03:40.510> answers<00:03:40.810> can<00:03:41.020> actually<00:03:41.320> be

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
on so a lot of answers can actually be

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.350 
on so a lot of answers can actually be
determined<00:03:42.130> based<00:03:42.760> on<00:03:42.940> an<00:03:43.060> initial

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:43.360 
determined based on an initial

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
determined based on an initial
walkthrough<00:03:43.510> without<00:03:44.110> the<00:03:44.200> initial

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
walkthrough without the initial

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.140 
walkthrough without the initial
walkthrough<00:03:44.709> I<00:03:45.010> think<00:03:45.400> we'd<00:03:45.580> be<00:03:45.670> left<00:03:45.940> in<00:03:46.060> the

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
walkthrough I think we'd be left in the

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.170 
walkthrough I think we'd be left in the
dark<00:03:46.330> a<00:03:46.450> lot<00:03:46.570> of<00:03:46.690> times<00:03:47.130> you<00:03:48.130> know<00:03:48.250> we<00:03:48.280> we<00:03:48.970> heard

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
dark a lot of times you know we we heard

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.449
