 in the street yesterday with this rain and hail remember that the 

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:14.580
 we've been discussing percent a few weeks ago 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:15.679
 that are already 

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:18.900
 to very favorable conditions also for development cloud formation 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.099
 vertical causing 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:26.809
 in it sometimes hail of course include with this important 

00:00:26.809 --> 00:00:28.119
 accumulated 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:30.289
 of the nest that advances the mega redundancy 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:34.989
 look relevant for this day is that the temperature has continued the table 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:38.399
 There is also a slight chance of occasional drizzle 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.449
 besides that cold fronts arrive 

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:44.339
 to the region another cold front for the weekend we expect a change 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.910
 significant especially in the temperature 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.080
 so I'm very aware of the forecasts now 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.940
 the system of low pressure in height with variable cloudiness also affecting 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:55.850
 of the entrance 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.690
 Blair is a mere of the Gulf of Mexico and there are arguments from the 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.250
 peaceful 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.900
 more than if the unam hotel kris peeters cold front that was 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.410
 affecting our region although at the moment it is already visiting c 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.690
 there are important areas of inventive way of shower instantaneously 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.700
 we hope even for today 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.510
 although the rain is going to give us a break if it were to seem in an occasional way 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:24.730
 to have also solfege and general periods of a variable side is what goes 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:27.250
 to predominate in terms of sky conditions 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.000
 and also the probability of rain 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.250
 look at the year the temperature 17 degrees centigrade jokes at 89 percent 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.410
 the pressure of one thousand 16 thousand bars the wind 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:40.880
 It has continued southeast at four kilometers per hour and for this afternoon 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.100
 we wait for an afternoon 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.460
 pleasant cool 22 degrees Celsius - cloudy varying and still with the bow 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:47.950

 Jorge Abib the occasional rain on smoking extreme precautions 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.799
 If you go in your car, there was a good tourist destination. 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.180

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.609
 sweater quote because we do not want it to happen but 

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:05.749
 Well yes it is what we are already waiting for at night 18 degrees Celsius 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.310
 bent variable cool the night also with the avenues of rain 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.230
 casual look less here in this area 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.920
 yale more generalized way after tobacco 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.549
 minimum to be expected reaching 20 degrees 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:21.549
 It should be noted that the 13 degrees are waiting for them 

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:25.650
 the day of Saturday already to finish it already at night 

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:30.569
 we hope that the temperature drops 13 degrees cloudy north wind 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:33.999
 and also with the probability of rain or drizzle the 2000 

00:02:33.999 --> 00:02:35.429
 but look no more 

00:02:35.429 --> 00:02:39.209
 it seems true but we expect 9 degrees Celsius minimum 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:45.179
 reaching only 13 degrees iceland came from the north cloudy probability of 

00:02:45.179 --> 00:02:49.389
 rain and drizzle and remember that as we have had very hot temperatures 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.450
 and also this is combined with the 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.270
 with the rain was this thermal sensation going to make 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:59.140
 see more cold and we will feel it so extreme precautions to the day their 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.720
 children 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.280

 to the condition of sky is composed a lot of cloudy variables 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.150
 the chance still rains occasionally for Monday 

00:03:13.749 --> 00:03:19.289
 and on Tuesday that contrasting minimum of 18 reaching to 31 degrees already as 

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:21.900
 maximum temperature soldier 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.470
 already the probability of rain disappears for Tuesday in Tamaulipas at 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.999

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.130
 and the maximum temperature in the altiplano I will look at due to the low system 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.729
 pressure that heights are also affecting with 

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:26.680
