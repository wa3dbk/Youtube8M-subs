white powder the aluminum oxide I have

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:11.089 
white powder the aluminum oxide I have
not<00:07:09.300> found<00:07:09.570> anything<00:07:09.930> faster<00:07:10.620> the<00:07:10.740> liquid

00:07:11.089 --> 00:07:11.099 
not found anything faster the liquid

00:07:11.099 --> 00:07:13.070 
not found anything faster the liquid
rinse<00:07:11.370> is<00:07:11.550> probably<00:07:11.940> the<00:07:12.090> second<00:07:12.509> faster<00:07:12.930> but

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:13.080 
rinse is probably the second faster but

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:15.680 
rinse is probably the second faster but
he'll<00:07:13.229> that<00:07:13.259> stuff's<00:07:13.710> expensive<00:07:14.539> all<00:07:15.539> right

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:15.690 
he'll that stuff's expensive all right

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:17.270 
he'll that stuff's expensive all right
I'll<00:07:16.080> let<00:07:16.169> y'all<00:07:16.409> fuckers<00:07:16.770> and<00:07:16.889> fuck<00:07:17.070> its

I'll let y'all fuckers and fuck its
later
