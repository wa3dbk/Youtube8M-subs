00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
Back to the Future they come with a

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:14.979 
Back to the Future they come with a
little<00:04:10.310> switch<00:04:11.380> in<00:04:12.380> here<00:04:12.709> somewhere<00:04:13.280> so<00:04:13.989> you

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:14.989 
little switch in here somewhere so you

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:19.349 
little switch in here somewhere so you
can<00:04:15.170> actually<00:04:15.320> turn<00:04:15.709> the<00:04:17.530> you<00:04:18.530> can<00:04:18.739> turn<00:04:18.980> the

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 
can actually turn the you can turn the

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:22.840 
can actually turn the you can turn the
make<00:04:20.359> logo<00:04:20.780> on<00:04:20.959> and<00:04:21.169> off

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:22.850 
make logo on and off

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:25.570 
make logo on and off
and<00:04:23.180> I<00:04:23.270> believe<00:04:23.660> the<00:04:23.930> left<00:04:24.169> hand<00:04:24.560> pair<00:04:24.889> has<00:04:25.340> a

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:25.580 
and I believe the left hand pair has a

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.810 
and I believe the left hand pair has a
sound<00:04:26.090> effect<00:04:27.130> there's<00:04:28.130> a<00:04:28.220> button<00:04:28.580> here

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:28.820 
sound effect there's a button here

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:34.529 
sound effect there's a button here
somewhere<00:04:30.820> but<00:04:31.820> if<00:04:32.060> you<00:04:32.180> heard<00:04:32.389> that<00:04:33.280> and

00:04:34.529 --> 00:04:34.539 
somewhere but if you heard that and

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:39.090 
somewhere but if you heard that and
that's<00:04:35.539> actually<00:04:35.720> the<00:04:35.900> sound<00:04:36.169> of<00:04:36.530> Marty<00:04:37.430> McFly

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:39.100 
that's actually the sound of Marty McFly

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:42.879 
that's actually the sound of Marty McFly
with<00:04:40.100> the<00:04:40.280> automatic<00:04:40.789> laces<00:04:41.419> so<00:04:41.990> the<00:04:42.470> main

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:42.889 
with the automatic laces so the main

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:44.529 
with the automatic laces so the main
thing<00:04:43.070> is<00:04:43.190> obviously<00:04:43.490> these<00:04:43.940> don't<00:04:44.330> have

00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:44.539 
thing is obviously these don't have

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:46.930 
thing is obviously these don't have
power<00:04:44.810> laces<00:04:45.259> as<00:04:46.130> much<00:04:46.310> as<00:04:46.460> I'd<00:04:46.550> love<00:04:46.729> to<00:04:46.850> have

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:46.940 
power laces as much as I'd love to have

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.719 
power laces as much as I'd love to have
power<00:04:47.120> laces<00:04:47.479> they<00:04:48.110> don't<00:04:48.320> exist<00:04:48.650> yet<00:04:48.830> I<00:04:49.070> think

00:04:49.719 --> 00:04:49.729 
power laces they don't exist yet I think

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:52.029 
power laces they don't exist yet I think
in<00:04:50.030> the<00:04:50.150> night<00:04:50.300> marketing<00:04:50.780> they<00:04:50.930> said<00:04:51.110> not

00:04:52.029 --> 00:04:52.039 
in the night marketing they said not

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:55.750 
in the night marketing they said not
till<00:04:52.160> 2015<00:04:52.820> so<00:04:53.380> yeah<00:04:54.380> we<00:04:54.740> don't<00:04:55.370> have<00:04:55.550> Power
