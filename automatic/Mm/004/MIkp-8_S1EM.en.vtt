00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:31.740

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.090
 happy to find you for this 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.920
 new video that was absolutely 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.860
 not planned in my program 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.650
 short we end up on black ops 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.030
 two a little bit old fashioned and you 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.520
 go see I presented you a little 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.239
 Allen gameplay is doing this test my everything 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.290
 first perfect here I have so 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:51.330
 reset blackhawks 2 as well 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:53.040
 lately to do some parts 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:55.199
 since good bah like everyone else 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.460
 know kids are a little bit by 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.560
 the holes of one and even if I play 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.739
 again as I already told you in my opinion 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:03.360
 I must have a little maso side but I 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.520
 I got a little bit like like 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.840
 objective even if I do not like this game I 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:09.119
 would still like to try to 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.860
 raise the prestige like that, that's it 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.149
 fifteen days went up thoroughly I'm doing 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.800
 not all challenges as I do 

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:17.070
 usually but I'm still 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.960
 try on the year of arrival to ride 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.240
 but precise brief so we end up on 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.100
 black up game play alain p 7 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.740
 we see everything will not have more than 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.960
 I had exactly and level relief 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.700
 stick so I have the jun the lightning 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.580
 is the new so why I 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.319
 wanted to present this video that was not 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.450
 not planned and well simply because 

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:39.479
 that it's my first perfect is good 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.509
 Well, I'm proud of it even though 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:45.240
 he is you are going to see a little bit 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:47.220
 accidental because how am I 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.310
 get me back a little bit stuck in the 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.259
 hold of this famous boat and you go 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.800
 see that every time I try to 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.800
 go out 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.780
 but I'm getting a little stuck so 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.539
 the enemies know perfectly well that 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.910
 I find myself in the karl and they go 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:05.429
 every time trying to become sought after 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.849
 so I'm not going to say that I try this 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:07.560
 type 

00:02:05.849 --> 00:02:09.750
 but before going out Belgian Thursday does 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.750
 still check that the guy is not going 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.430
 pick me up here they were not 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.380
 come to come and look for me ben 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.819
 inevitably I would be out of the map 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.560
 so some of you may have 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:21.569
 to say that it's okay 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.989
 oh no I think it's the 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:27.090
 cambre since technically actually 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:30.890
 tactically it would have been stupid to 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:33.200
 Thursday to get out of there karl is yes 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.060
 it would be stupid to want to go out of 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.920
 the hold and make me kill stupidly 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.030
 so necessarily every time I 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.940
 say they will come back 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.950
 Well, I'm going back and I'm waiting for them 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.200
 timbaland garnets balance a little 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:48.020
 everything they have on hand 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:51.230
 and I go from one side to the other of 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:53.090
 the hold my only little regret is good 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.820
 inevitably I did not do nuclear 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:58.010
 but before I spoil you kloster m 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.239
 you will see that it was not easy 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.100
 I do not want to say that it has not happened 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:03.709
 away because there was still no 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:05.870
 kiel sore that were done with 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:08.989
 the strict scores but finally that made me 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.430
 laugh because that's how they say 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:12.170
 it's a little bit each time when you do not 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.870
 you do not expect that you will do 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:17.660
 good ones go on here I typed 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.269
 black ops of me saying to the transfer window I 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.560
 do not go we want to play left 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:22.810
 so well I say to myself I'm going to do 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.570
 some parts 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:29.000
 here and it was really so I was 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:31.640
 solo does not appear madrid 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:35.120
 and here it was really really 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:36.950
 really reacted planned so I mean 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.350
 that I had not planned to do this 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.299
 video to his achene but it would have been 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:43.220
 still unhappy give no 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:44.690
 not want to put since you know 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:47.150
 although I do not have a level of play 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:48.890
 Exceptionally I'm not the guy who goes 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.980
 get out of the nuclear 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:53.239
 they deny Arabic words I think that 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.950
 I can 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:57.230
 twice it happens to me 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:59.470
 to do some good parts but 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.970
 for those of us who have 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:03.830
 the opportunity to play with me a little 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:05.480
 little more regularly by you know 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:08.810
 although to do we saw a good 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:11.000
 part people except 50 bad and that's 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.810
 unhappy since good with me I have not 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.110
 to overthrow 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:17.120
 although he suggests to his guests in black 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:20.200
 ops 2 I think it was we were 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:23.630
 roughly the same thing I have not 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:25.880
 no jet assisted how stadiums 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:26.060
 crazy but good as usual like all 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.970
 world 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:31.130
 toronto a part that is not too much 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:34.070
 bad good unfortunately I find 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:37.130
 that me the problem that I have when I 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:37.850
 play this kind of game these are it's from 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:39.470
 to make series 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:43.550
 I have a lot of trouble doing series 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:44.930
 is here down and coup de bol I could 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:47.030
 do a long series 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:49.669
 his father you're good I've already done a 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:51.590
 nape the income that we can not 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:53.720
 convinced that video buttocks but 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:55.550
 it was not stuff of phew 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:58.810
 compared to some standing hours 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:00.950
 who will find themselves affording some of the 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:05.180
 property even several a day 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:06.800
 in short, here are the friends it's roughly speaking I 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.900
 did not have specific topics for 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.639
 this video I told myself ball like 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:12.440
 I 'm doing it I want just falseness 

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:14.630
 to be able to share it with you because 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:17.000
 that even when I do them she made me 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:21.440
 laughing and there was mourning in 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.729
 the party and it's left in my opinion 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:25.190
 the idea is still of always 

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:27.950
 search and I believe there was a 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:29.990
 subscriber millions of subscribers with me but 

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:31.430
 who was not how so we were not 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:33.650
 not in conversation believe it's a 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:35.120
 subscriber who joined me according to the fund 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:37.550
 big up to you if you watch this video 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.150
 so down that had told me I could 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:41.780
 not tell you 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:43.849
 short I finish which will be a score like 

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:45.740
 you will be able to 29 to 0 

00:05:43.849 --> 00:05:47.450
 I was not far from the stretch indeed 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:49.280
 well I hope this little video 

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:50.630
 you will have liked that way in passing we 

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:52.669
 found again very soon for a next 

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:54.110
 video that will be a little longer 

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:55.820
 in the meantime as usual I you 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:06:00.729
 invite you to take good care of yourself and 

00:05:55.820 --> 00:06:00.729
