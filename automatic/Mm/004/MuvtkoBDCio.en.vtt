00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:06.210
 true 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:17.280
 start the engines because the 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:19.500
 race begins this mini 6 meter and pr 

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:22.189
 news is here to live it and 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.189
 inform them 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:32.840
 for three days the subway station 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.150
 of chamartín in madrid is transformed into 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.670
 a motorsport track as always 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.790
 the mini amazing and good world here 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.990
 in him 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:45.680
 the tracks in this section as tracks 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:49.050
 like a narrow track with some slalom 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.640
 and good doing a little show 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.829
 the truth is that it is very funny 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.649
 you usually go to a circuit and this is 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:58.440
 wide and they put us in 5 meters 85 meters 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.300
 64 cars and sometimes we are left just 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.710
 it seems that they want that part a bit 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.660
 the order not to take the pilots 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.450
 professionals like luis miguel reyes 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.940
 marta suria david gonzález izaguirre o 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.880
 habibiya will delight all users 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.800
 of the suburban from October 3 to 5 with 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.470
 demonstrations in various ministries 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.729
 coopers min and sneaks in the subway me 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.200
 I think it was an incredible way to 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.430
 bring people to be able to see our 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.619
 cars to enjoy a few days 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.210
 spectacular and in an environment where 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.380
 as we say totally outside 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.690
 of normal out of the ordinary as 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.369
 is the mini brand is normal then what 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.040
 what we are looking for are different ways of 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.960
 communicate 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.340
 and with people in general but what 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.140
 more we enjoy especially it's also the 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.360
 brand experience that people have 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.640
 a good experience with the brand and 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.920
 have a memory that you do not forget 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.990
 so easily to make known this 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.970
 new mini john cooper the company 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.160
 power your brand experience with 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.520
 this initiative whose objective is very 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.250
 Clear 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:55.100
 Well, all this arises from a 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:57.110
 idea of the agency make us this 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.820
 proposal to do this madness in the 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.710
 Metro of Madrid 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.470
 well we see that it fits us very well for 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:06.200
 our model mini john cooper works and 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:08.420
 that was very close to all the people 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.979
 of the day to day of the people and do 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.300
 something different from the things he does 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.450
 tango is always what we call 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:17.060
 brand accelerators that here on top 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.890
 it helps us a lot more not in the end it consists 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.600
 in what my child asked us to 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.860
 definitive was hey what can we do in 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.670
 instead of using a possible plan of 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.870
 means how can we really 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.350
 increase by three or by four the 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.360
 campaign value 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.070
 and in the end, well, I think that the 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.350
 reality again overcome fiction the 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:37.840
 kick-off of this campaign what 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:39.760
 they have given two sponsors of exception Maria 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.400
 of villota ambassador of the brand and the 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:46.090
 rally driver nani roma maría de 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.650
 villota is gasoline my engine in life 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.320
 has always been this world here is 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.630
 where are people my natural environment 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.280
 but good today we are living I believe 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.080
 something totally exceptional has never been 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.300
 done not then I could not miss it 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.580

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:04.290
