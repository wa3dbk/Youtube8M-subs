00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
see than any other ride in the world so

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.610 
see than any other ride in the world so
it<00:01:29.210> is<00:01:29.330> just<00:01:29.540> one<00:01:29.780> mass<00:01:30.200> of<00:01:30.470> inversions<00:01:31.220> I<00:01:32.620> did

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:33.620 
it is just one mass of inversions I did

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:35.230 
it is just one mass of inversions I did
suggest<00:01:33.860> we<00:01:34.190> bring<00:01:34.400> you<00:01:34.490> this<00:01:34.670> story<00:01:34.940> without

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
suggest we bring you this story without

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.649 
suggest we bring you this story without
the<00:01:35.360> need<00:01:35.510> actually<00:01:36.170> to<00:01:36.320> ride<00:01:36.560> the<00:01:36.800> thing<00:01:37.659> but

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:38.659 
the need actually to ride the thing but

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:40.810 
the need actually to ride the thing but
our<00:01:38.720> editor<00:01:39.200> was<00:01:39.350> having<00:01:39.620> none<00:01:39.710> of<00:01:39.860> that<00:01:39.890> so<00:01:40.790> I

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
our editor was having none of that so I

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.220 
our editor was having none of that so I
got<00:01:41.060> the<00:01:41.150> chance<00:01:41.180> to<00:01:41.480> test<00:01:41.840> the<00:01:42.050> technology

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:42.230 
got the chance to test the technology

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:44.740 
got the chance to test the technology
that's<00:01:42.830> taking<00:01:43.250> the<00:01:43.280> guesswork<00:01:43.700> out<00:01:43.820> of<00:01:44.630> the
