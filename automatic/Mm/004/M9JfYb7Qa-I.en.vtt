00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.160
 hello girls welcome once again to me 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.560
 channel today I bring you something very different 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.380
 but I really wanted to do it and it's 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.090
 California wicks without having us and of 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.520
 colors that I think they are now 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.009
 a lot then well I discovered this 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:34.230
 well looking by google and such peak to see 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.860
 how can I do it and nothing what 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:40.860
 we need is some pears so that I have 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:44.100
 picked up a few color vouchers here 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.710
 ok to do this I have used 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.530
 the fuxin alone but good that you know that 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:53.100
 we can also do it blue green and 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:55.920
 where colors more than most we need 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.750
 a comb to untangle us then I've 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.239
 caught this that was my cutting comb 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.210
 that was already a little bent and 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.409
 we need a plancha marÃ­a to make 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.100
 the second part to make it more 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:10.200
 marked and nothing else is super easy to 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.909
 to do is very fun and good if you do not 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.640
 You want to dye your hair and you want some 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:19.060
 of color to follow to avoid then 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:22.240
 nothing to do it I've tried it with the clear 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:25.240
 in my hair that is blond credit I do not know if 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:28.149
 in dark brown and such dye at 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:30.939
 probable with my sister to one day and I already 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:34.179
 I will say and if it works then I better want 

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:37.010
 make the video so good nothing else no 

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:39.590
 I roll up and I leave you with the video chao 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:41.240
 with a clamp first part separated 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.370
 lower hair so that I stay 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.180
 painted all over and does not serve the 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:46.180
 undyed locks 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.430
 we take a sidewalk of crafts that 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:02.979
 You can buy a box of several 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:06.010
 colors in stationery and we're going through 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:08.259
 by the hair with patience you can see 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:10.830
 how it is taking color and it is getting 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:10.830
 rosita 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.640
 besides making the tips of a color 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.440
 You can try whatever you want for 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.900
 example several tables of various 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:34.000
 colors or create something more natural like 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.000
 California wicks in black a chestnut 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:05.420
 so we would have a pretty result 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:05.420
 natural and not very prominent 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:16.280
 let's move on to the second part so that I take 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:18.709
 a more intense color we take the iron 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:21.110
 and we went through the ends like the hair 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:23.720
 take heat if we pass the wax right away 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.400
 it slows down faster and 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.459
 we will achieve a more striking result 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:30.440
 I like it more in summer, maybe 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:32.769
 with the heat this step we can 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.769
 save money 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:45.590
 finally we have to untangle the 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:48.110
 hair with a comb 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:50.300
 I've taken one cut and it would be 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:52.190
 we already have our California wicks 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.990
 made and hands well pricked good 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:57.110

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:59.300
