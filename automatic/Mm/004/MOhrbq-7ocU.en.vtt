around to making the update to the

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.440 
around to making the update to the
blender<00:00:27.990> bloom<00:00:28.440> tutorial<00:00:29.130> now<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:30.120> other<00:00:30.240> one

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:30.450 
blender bloom tutorial now the other one

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:33.320 
blender bloom tutorial now the other one
I<00:00:30.690> sort<00:00:31.170> of<00:00:31.260> didn't<00:00:31.619> finish<00:00:32.010> the<00:00:32.220> bloom<00:00:32.430> this

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:33.330 
I sort of didn't finish the bloom this

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:35.420 
I sort of didn't finish the bloom this
was<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.780> original<00:00:33.870> image<00:00:34.500> and<00:00:34.650> this<00:00:34.739> was<00:00:35.310> the

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
was the original image and this was the

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.300 
was the original image and this was the
image<00:00:35.520> we<00:00:35.820> created<00:00:36.330> if<00:00:36.480> you<00:00:37.230> look<00:00:37.470> it's<00:00:37.860> really

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:38.310 
image we created if you look it's really

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:40.940 
image we created if you look it's really
not<00:00:38.550> true<00:00:39.030> bloom<00:00:39.390> true<00:00:40.020> bloom<00:00:40.320> is<00:00:40.559> more<00:00:40.739> like

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
not true bloom true bloom is more like

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.360 
not true bloom true bloom is more like
this<00:00:41.309> where<00:00:42.180> it<00:00:42.510> blows<00:00:43.140> out<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.470> whites<00:00:44.010> and

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
this where it blows out the whites and

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.970 
this where it blows out the whites and
also<00:00:44.970> creates<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.570> halo<00:00:45.900> also<00:00:46.350> I've<00:00:46.620> improved

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
also creates the halo also I've improved

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.250 
also creates the halo also I've improved
the<00:00:47.250> blurring<00:00:47.670> effect<00:00:48.059> just<00:00:48.270> a<00:00:48.450> slight<00:00:48.930> that

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
the blurring effect just a slight that

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.310 
the blurring effect just a slight that
so<00:00:49.559> looks<00:00:49.890> better<00:00:50.129> although<00:00:51.020> that<00:00:52.020> can<00:00:52.230> be

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
so looks better although that can be

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.160 
so looks better although that can be
customizable<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:53.129> whatever<00:00:53.190> you<00:00:53.520> want<00:00:53.699> to<00:00:53.760> do

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170 
customizable to whatever you want to do

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.579 
customizable to whatever you want to do
so<00:00:55.610> this<00:00:56.610> is<00:00:56.790> the<00:00:56.909> finished<00:00:57.239> node<00:00:57.420> tree<00:00:57.780> it's

00:00:58.579 --> 00:00:58.589 
so this is the finished node tree it's

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:00.530 
so this is the finished node tree it's
not<00:00:58.890> that<00:00:59.519> much<00:00:59.850> different<00:01:00.300> from<00:01:00.420> the

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:00.540 
not that much different from the

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.420 
not that much different from the
original<00:01:00.720> one<00:01:01.080> but<00:01:01.379> it<00:01:01.530> looks<00:01:01.860> a<00:01:02.040> heck<00:01:02.250> of<00:01:02.339> a

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
original one but it looks a heck of a

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.180 
original one but it looks a heck of a
lot<00:01:02.519> better<00:01:02.580> so<00:01:03.420> let's<00:01:03.930> get<00:01:04.080> started<00:01:04.470> first

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:05.190 
lot better so let's get started first

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.960 
lot better so let's get started first
off<00:01:05.489> open<00:01:05.909> up<00:01:06.000> blender<00:01:06.450> hit<00:01:07.320> ctrl<00:01:08.100> left<00:01:08.640> arrow

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
off open up blender hit ctrl left arrow

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.969 
off open up blender hit ctrl left arrow
and<00:01:11.900> that'll<00:01:12.900> bring<00:01:13.020> you<00:01:13.140> to<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.350> node<00:01:13.530> screen

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
and that'll bring you to the node screen

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.250 
and that'll bring you to the node screen
hit<00:01:14.340> use<00:01:14.670> nodes<00:01:15.030> like<00:01:15.390> always<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:17.930> setup<00:01:18.930> the

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:19.260 
hit use nodes like always and setup the

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:25.010 
hit use nodes like always and setup the
default<00:01:22.430> thing<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.790> default<00:01:24.120> setup<00:01:24.570> where<00:01:24.990> we

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
default thing the default setup where we

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.289 
default thing the default setup where we
take<00:01:25.350> this<00:01:25.680> we<00:01:25.950> add<00:01:26.130> a<00:01:26.159> viewer<00:01:27.979> and<00:01:28.979> we<00:01:29.729> add<00:01:29.909> a

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
take this we add a viewer and we add a

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:39.730 
take this we add a viewer and we add a
row

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.520 

okay<00:01:40.340> let's<00:01:40.640> well<00:01:41.420> we<00:01:41.570> have<00:01:41.660> to<00:01:41.780> add<00:01:42.170> a<00:01:42.200> camera

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
okay let's well we have to add a camera

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.490 
okay let's well we have to add a camera
first<00:01:43.300> which<00:01:44.300> normally<00:01:45.050> you<00:01:45.170> should<00:01:45.350> have<00:01:45.440> a

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
first which normally you should have a

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:46.990 
first which normally you should have a
default<00:01:45.800> camera<00:01:46.070> and<00:01:46.340> then<00:01:46.460> just<00:01:46.610> render<00:01:46.910> this

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
default camera and then just render this

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.740 
default camera and then just render this
out<00:01:47.210> and<00:01:47.570> that<00:01:48.560> will<00:01:48.940> render<00:01:49.940> out<00:01:50.150> absolutely

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
out and that will render out absolutely

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:57.010 
out and that will render out absolutely
nothing<00:01:52.150> but<00:01:53.380> that<00:01:54.380> allow<00:01:54.590> us<00:01:54.620> to<00:01:54.770> do<00:01:55.130> is<00:01:55.990> go<00:01:56.990> to

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
nothing but that allow us to do is go to

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.580 
nothing but that allow us to do is go to
desktop<00:01:57.380> or<00:01:57.860> wherever<00:01:58.010> you<00:01:58.190> have<00:01:58.370> this<00:01:58.550> image

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
desktop or wherever you have this image

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:05.920 
desktop or wherever you have this image
go<00:02:00.590> to<00:02:02.110> wear<00:02:03.110> as<00:02:03.260> a<00:02:03.290> bloom<00:02:03.710> tutorial<00:02:04.580> and<00:02:04.930> open

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930 
go to wear as a bloom tutorial and open

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.430 
go to wear as a bloom tutorial and open
up<00:02:06.050> the<00:02:06.410> original<00:02:06.530> image<00:02:07.899> now<00:02:08.899> set<00:02:09.320> the

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
up the original image now set the

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.130 
up the original image now set the
dimensions<00:02:09.920> to<00:02:10.520> the<00:02:10.759> image<00:02:11.030> so<00:02:11.270> this<00:02:11.450> is<00:02:11.660> 1280

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
dimensions to the image so this is 1280

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.670 
dimensions to the image so this is 1280
by<00:02:12.500> 720<00:02:12.890> and<00:02:13.480> then<00:02:14.480> you<00:02:15.020> might<00:02:15.200> want<00:02:15.350> to<00:02:15.410> render

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
by 720 and then you might want to render

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.530 
by 720 and then you might want to render
that<00:02:15.709> again<00:02:16.070> just<00:02:16.400> to<00:02:16.550> get<00:02:16.700> the<00:02:16.880> output<00:02:17.180> the

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
that again just to get the output the

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.020 
that again just to get the output the
same<00:02:17.720> but<00:02:18.500> change<00:02:18.530> it<00:02:18.860> to<00:02:18.980> viewer<00:02:19.250> and<00:02:19.489> we<00:02:19.910> can

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
same but change it to viewer and we can

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.150 
same but change it to viewer and we can
get<00:02:20.180> started<00:02:20.360> so<00:02:21.110> as<00:02:21.170> before<00:02:21.440> we're<00:02:21.800> gonna<00:02:21.890> add

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
get started so as before we're gonna add

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.229 
get started so as before we're gonna add
a<00:02:22.520> map<00:02:23.120> value<00:02:23.900> node<00:02:24.110> so<00:02:25.100> go<00:02:25.310> down<00:02:25.430> to<00:02:25.550> map<00:02:25.730> value

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 
a map value node so go down to map value

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:31.090 
a map value node so go down to map value
and<00:02:28.030> drag<00:02:29.030> then<00:02:29.270> by<00:02:29.870> the<00:02:29.930> way<00:02:30.170> with<00:02:30.920> this

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
and drag then by the way with this

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.160 
and drag then by the way with this
tutorial<00:02:31.640> I<00:02:31.820> will<00:02:31.880> also<00:02:32.270> include<00:02:32.510> this<00:02:32.810> theme

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
tutorial I will also include this theme

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:38.440 
tutorial I will also include this theme
in<00:02:33.500> the<00:02:33.650> file<00:02:33.860> so<00:02:34.430> you<00:02:34.820> can<00:02:37.000> get<00:02:38.000> it<00:02:38.150> if<00:02:38.300> you

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
in the file so you can get it if you

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.840 
in the file so you can get it if you
want<00:02:38.480> to<00:02:38.840> but<00:02:39.800> I'm<00:02:39.890> gonna<00:02:39.980> deep<00:02:40.220> duplicate<00:02:40.730> the

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
want to but I'm gonna deep duplicate the

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:46.120 
want to but I'm gonna deep duplicate the
viewer<00:02:42.010> drag<00:02:43.010> it<00:02:43.130> over<00:02:43.780> and<00:02:44.780> use<00:02:45.620> minimum<00:02:45.950> use

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
viewer drag it over and use minimum use

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.600 
viewer drag it over and use minimum use
maximum<00:02:46.640> click<00:02:47.060> the<00:02:47.209> viewer<00:02:47.540> and<00:02:48.280> it<00:02:49.280> made<00:02:49.489> it

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
maximum click the viewer and it made it

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:51.880 
maximum click the viewer and it made it
black<00:02:49.760> and<00:02:49.970> white<00:02:50.150> so<00:02:50.930> we<00:02:51.320> are<00:02:51.440> going<00:02:51.620> to

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
black and white so we are going to

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.630 
black and white so we are going to
change<00:02:52.070> the<00:02:52.400> offset<00:02:53.200> something<00:02:54.459> to<00:02:55.459> about

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
change the offset something to about

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.190 
change the offset something to about
that<00:02:56.000> extent<00:02:56.480> again<00:02:56.690> it<00:02:56.780> can<00:02:56.870> always<00:02:57.080> be

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
that extent again it can always be

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.789 
that extent again it can always be
adjusted<00:02:57.290> later<00:02:58.840> then<00:02:59.840> we're<00:03:00.110> going<00:03:00.380> to<00:03:00.440> hide

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:00.799 
adjusted later then we're going to hide

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:02.979 
adjusted later then we're going to hide
this<00:03:01.040> because<00:03:01.519> we<00:03:01.910> are<00:03:01.940> going<00:03:02.269> to<00:03:02.390> have<00:03:02.510> a<00:03:02.570> few

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989 
this because we are going to have a few

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:04.930 
this because we are going to have a few
more<00:03:03.200> nodes<00:03:03.500> than<00:03:03.769> we<00:03:03.860> did<00:03:03.980> last<00:03:04.160> time<00:03:04.370> whoops

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
more nodes than we did last time whoops

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.150 
more nodes than we did last time whoops
I<00:03:05.180> didn't<00:03:05.390> want<00:03:05.510> to<00:03:05.570> do<00:03:05.690> that<00:03:05.840> anyways<00:03:06.799> grab

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
I didn't want to do that anyways grab

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.030 
I didn't want to do that anyways grab
that<00:03:07.340> out<00:03:07.400> of<00:03:07.580> the<00:03:07.670> way<00:03:07.790> and<00:03:08.410> then<00:03:09.410> we<00:03:09.709> will<00:03:09.860> add

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
that out of the way and then we will add

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.039 
that out of the way and then we will add
our<00:03:10.220> next<00:03:10.370> node<00:03:10.670> which<00:03:10.910> is<00:03:11.090> a<00:03:11.120> color

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:12.049 
our next node which is a color

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:14.410 
our next node which is a color
correction<00:03:12.560> node<00:03:12.920> so<00:03:13.549> go<00:03:13.910> ahead<00:03:14.090> and<00:03:14.239> add<00:03:14.390> a

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
correction node so go ahead and add a

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:20.450 
correction node so go ahead and add a
color<00:03:14.870> correction<00:03:16.720> drop<00:03:17.720> that<00:03:17.959> in<00:03:18.110> here

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:20.460 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:23.510 

and<00:03:20.550> go<00:03:21.390> back<00:03:21.540> to<00:03:21.870> the<00:03:22.290> viewer<00:03:22.620> actually<00:03:23.070> first

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:23.520 
and go back to the viewer actually first

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:27.620 
and go back to the viewer actually first
off<00:03:23.730> add<00:03:24.000> the<00:03:24.810> map<00:03:25.620> value<00:03:26.040> as<00:03:26.220> a<00:03:26.250> mask<00:03:26.880> this

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
off add the map value as a mask this

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.380 
off add the map value as a mask this
will<00:03:27.870> make<00:03:28.380> things<00:03:28.530> a<00:03:28.710> little<00:03:28.830> easier<00:03:29.010> now<00:03:29.820> go

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
will make things a little easier now go

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.330 
will make things a little easier now go
over<00:03:30.420> to<00:03:30.570> the<00:03:30.720> gain<00:03:30.930> and<00:03:31.260> change<00:03:31.590> the<00:03:31.830> gain<00:03:32.070> to

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
over to the gain and change the gain to

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.870 
over to the gain and change the gain to
4<00:03:32.910> and<00:03:33.530> that<00:03:34.530> will<00:03:34.770> brighten<00:03:35.190> it<00:03:35.310> up<00:03:35.460> just<00:03:35.700> a

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
4 and that will brighten it up just a

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.210 
4 and that will brighten it up just a
little<00:03:35.910> bit<00:03:36.240> you<00:03:36.420> can<00:03:36.570> change<00:03:36.840> this<00:03:37.050> to<00:03:37.320> 5<00:03:37.800> you

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
little bit you can change this to 5 you

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:39.950 
little bit you can change this to 5 you
can<00:03:38.310> change<00:03:38.610> it<00:03:38.850> will<00:03:39.060> actually<00:03:39.540> force<00:03:39.810> the

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:39.960 
can change it will actually force the

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:41.960 
can change it will actually force the
max<00:03:40.290> I<00:03:40.470> take<00:03:40.650> that<00:03:40.770> back<00:03:40.980> and<00:03:41.220> change<00:03:41.760> the

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
max I take that back and change the

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:46.970 
max I take that back and change the
gamma<00:03:42.500> to<00:03:44.060> 0.5<00:03:45.060> -<00:03:45.570> then<00:03:46.410> I'll<00:03:46.500> brighten<00:03:46.740> it<00:03:46.830> up

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
gamma to 0.5 - then I'll brighten it up

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.490 
gamma to 0.5 - then I'll brighten it up
even<00:03:47.340> a<00:03:47.400> little<00:03:47.520> more<00:03:47.760> or<00:03:48.000> you<00:03:48.660> can<00:03:48.810> drop<00:03:49.260> this

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
even a little more or you can drop this

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.650 
even a little more or you can drop this
down<00:03:49.740> if<00:03:50.040> you<00:03:50.160> want<00:03:50.430> to<00:03:50.640> but<00:03:50.880> I<00:03:51.030> think<00:03:51.090> it<00:03:51.480> gets

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
down if you want to but I think it gets

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.350 
down if you want to but I think it gets
pretty<00:03:51.900> excessive<00:03:52.470> pretty<00:03:52.890> fast<00:03:53.160> so<00:03:53.940> leave

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
pretty excessive pretty fast so leave

00:03:54.360 --> 00:04:00.620 
pretty excessive pretty fast so leave
that<00:03:54.390> at<00:03:54.780> 0.5<00:03:55.230> to<00:03:55.440> 4<00:03:55.740> now<00:03:58.040> hit<00:03:59.040> that<00:03:59.450> drag<00:04:00.450> it

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
that at 0.5 to 4 now hit that drag it

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:02.030 
that at 0.5 to 4 now hit that drag it
over<00:04:00.690> here<00:04:00.840> now

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
over here now

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:07.310 
over here now
we<00:04:02.220> are<00:04:02.310> going<00:04:02.640> to<00:04:02.850> add<00:04:03.090> both<00:04:03.420> a<00:04:03.660> blur<00:04:04.790> and<00:04:06.320> a

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:07.320 
we are going to add both a blur and a

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:12.010 
we are going to add both a blur and a
mix<00:04:08.840> so<00:04:09.840> the<00:04:09.930> way<00:04:10.050> this<00:04:10.170> is<00:04:10.290> gonna<00:04:10.440> work<00:04:10.530> is

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:12.020 
mix so the way this is gonna work is

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:16.010 
mix so the way this is gonna work is
drag<00:04:13.020> all<00:04:13.170> this<00:04:13.320> over<00:04:13.710> again<00:04:14.480> it's<00:04:15.480> this<00:04:15.810> one

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:16.020 
drag all this over again it's this one

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:17.450 
drag all this over again it's this one
is<00:04:16.200> going<00:04:16.440> to<00:04:16.560> go<00:04:16.739> straight<00:04:17.010> into<00:04:17.160> the<00:04:17.250> top

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:17.460 
is going to go straight into the top

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:19.550 
is going to go straight into the top
image<00:04:17.790> of<00:04:17.970> the<00:04:18.060> blur<00:04:18.270> then<00:04:18.840> the<00:04:18.989> image<00:04:19.350> is

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
image of the blur then the image is

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.220 
image of the blur then the image is
going<00:04:19.620> to<00:04:19.890> go<00:04:20.070> into<00:04:20.430> the<00:04:20.520> blur<00:04:20.730> and<00:04:21.000> then<00:04:21.360> into

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:22.230 
going to go into the blur and then into

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:26.210 
going to go into the blur and then into
the<00:04:22.350> bottom<00:04:22.740> image<00:04:22.920> of<00:04:23.310> the<00:04:23.760> mix<00:04:24.980> so<00:04:25.980> that

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
the bottom image of the mix so that

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.910 
the bottom image of the mix so that
allows<00:04:26.550> to<00:04:27.090> change<00:04:27.630> the<00:04:27.930> blur<00:04:28.170> amount<00:04:28.530> the

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:28.920 
allows to change the blur amount the

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:33.170 
allows to change the blur amount the
blur<00:04:29.190> should<00:04:29.580> be<00:04:29.670> set<00:04:29.940> to<00:04:29.970> around<00:04:30.480> 10<00:04:31.880> but<00:04:32.880> on

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
blur should be set to around 10 but on

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.680 
blur should be set to around 10 but on
this<00:04:33.720> mix<00:04:34.310> we're<00:04:35.310> gonna<00:04:35.400> set<00:04:35.700> this<00:04:35.910> to<00:04:36.330> maybe

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:36.690 
this mix we're gonna set this to maybe

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:38.600 
this mix we're gonna set this to maybe
point<00:04:37.110> 1<00:04:37.320> see<00:04:37.980> if<00:04:38.070> that<00:04:38.250> works

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
point 1 see if that works

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:42.020 
point 1 see if that works
no<00:04:39.030> needs<00:04:40.020> the<00:04:40.140> values<00:04:40.470> at<00:04:40.620> 10<00:04:40.920> and<00:04:41.190> then

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030 
no needs the values at 10 and then

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.770 
no needs the values at 10 and then
adjust<00:04:42.900> the<00:04:42.990> factor<00:04:43.950> a<00:04:44.190> little<00:04:45.120> bit<00:04:45.330> and<00:04:45.510> this

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
adjust the factor a little bit and this

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.110 
adjust the factor a little bit and this
will<00:04:45.860> give<00:04:46.860> you<00:04:47.010> the<00:04:47.160> amount<00:04:47.370> of<00:04:47.520> bloom<00:04:47.910> you

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 
will give you the amount of bloom you

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.030 
will give you the amount of bloom you
want<00:04:48.330> this<00:04:48.630> factor<00:04:49.230> value<00:04:49.560> if<00:04:49.650> you<00:04:49.740> want<00:04:49.770> to

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:50.040 
want this factor value if you want to

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:53.780 
want this factor value if you want to
you<00:04:50.190> can<00:04:50.340> add<00:04:50.520> a<00:04:51.200> value<00:04:52.200> and<00:04:52.740> then<00:04:53.220> plug<00:04:53.580> that

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:53.790 
you can add a value and then plug that

00:04:53.790 --> 00:05:01.130 
you can add a value and then plug that
in<00:04:54.380> so<00:04:55.380> 0.39<00:04:57.380> and<00:04:59.120> that<00:05:00.120> will<00:05:00.360> work<00:05:00.750> pretty

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:01.140 
in so 0.39 and that will work pretty

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:04.730 
in so 0.39 and that will work pretty
well

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:04.740 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:08.040 

and<00:05:05.820> that<00:05:06.820> is<00:05:06.970> actually<00:05:07.240> it<00:05:07.630> for<00:05:07.960> this

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.050 
and that is actually it for this

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:10.080 
and that is actually it for this
tutorial<00:05:08.290> sorry<00:05:08.919> it<00:05:09.070> was<00:05:09.160> faster<00:05:09.699> than<00:05:09.970> it
