00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
expected so and you almost survived his

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.620 
expected so and you almost survived his
submersible<00:02:14.970> it<00:02:15.970> was<00:02:16.090> pretty<00:02:16.240> late<00:02:16.480> in<00:02:16.540> the

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
submersible it was pretty late in the

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.540 
submersible it was pretty late in the
game<00:02:16.810> before<00:02:16.990> I<00:02:17.170> even<00:02:17.290> realized<00:02:17.530> he<00:02:17.830> was<00:02:17.980> using

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
game before I even realized he was using

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.230 
game before I even realized he was using
that<00:02:18.850> damn<00:02:19.240> machine<00:02:19.450> to<00:02:19.900> take<00:02:20.260> out<00:02:20.380> all<00:02:20.530> of<00:02:20.560> my

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
that damn machine to take out all of my

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.600 
that damn machine to take out all of my
navel<00:02:22.240> factories<00:02:22.780> well<00:02:23.500> I<00:02:23.530> left<00:02:24.070> one<00:02:24.280> for<00:02:24.489> you

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
navel factories well I left one for you

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.600 
navel factories well I left one for you
just<00:02:25.060> well<00:02:25.780> kind<00:02:26.470> of<00:02:26.560> kind<00:02:26.739> of<00:02:26.920> be<00:02:27.430> nice

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
just well kind of kind of be nice

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.240 
just well kind of kind of be nice
annoying<00:02:28.480> is<00:02:28.660> actually<00:02:28.989> when<00:02:29.110> I<00:02:29.170> was<00:02:29.260> bored<00:02:29.440> so

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
annoying is actually when I was bored so

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.070 
annoying is actually when I was bored so
I<00:02:30.730> suppose<00:02:30.940> sonar<00:02:31.480> would<00:02:31.690> have<00:02:31.780> helped<00:02:32.020> you

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
I suppose sonar would have helped you

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.620 
I suppose sonar would have helped you
notice<00:02:32.530> that<00:02:32.580> sonar<00:02:33.580> would<00:02:33.730> have<00:02:33.820> helped<00:02:34.120> I

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
notice that sonar would have helped I

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.660 
notice that sonar would have helped I
built<00:02:35.320> an<00:02:35.440> omni<00:02:35.739> fairly<00:02:36.130> early<00:02:36.250> on<00:02:36.430> in<00:02:36.580> the

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
built an omni fairly early on in the

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.460 
built an omni fairly early on in the
game<00:02:36.700> but<00:02:37.090> kind<00:02:37.510> of<00:02:37.630> neglected<00:02:37.870> the<00:02:38.260> whole

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
game but kind of neglected the whole

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.820 
game but kind of neglected the whole
water<00:02:39.400> thing<00:02:39.540> despite<00:02:40.540> having<00:02:40.930> a<00:02:41.320> fairly

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
water thing despite having a fairly

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.010 
water thing despite having a fairly

large neighbor who's going I did
actually<00:02:44.200> managed<00:02:44.530> to<00:02:44.560> build<00:02:44.709> up<00:02:44.860> a

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
actually managed to build up a

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.340 
actually managed to build up a
significant<00:02:45.459> enough<00:02:45.550> naval<00:02:45.940> fleet<00:02:46.150> to<00:02:46.360> take

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
significant enough naval fleet to take

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.229 
significant enough naval fleet to take
out<00:02:47.530> one<00:02:47.890> of<00:02:47.920> his<00:02:48.100> or<00:02:48.400> start<00:02:48.760> making<00:02:49.090> my<00:02:49.209> way

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239 
out one of his or start making my way

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:50.720 
out one of his or start making my way
through<00:02:49.540> one<00:02:49.870> of<00:02:49.900> his<00:02:50.020> choke

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
through one of his choke

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.080 
through one of his choke
but<00:02:51.319> much<00:02:52.319> to<00:02:52.590> the<00:02:52.739> destruction<00:02:53.700> of<00:02:53.790> the<00:02:53.909> rest

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
but much to the destruction of the rest

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.110 
but much to the destruction of the rest
of<00:02:54.269> my<00:02:54.420> navel<00:02:55.049> navel<00:02:55.650> factories<00:02:56.310> inflate<00:02:56.700> so

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
of my navel navel factories inflate so

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.899 
of my navel navel factories inflate so
and<00:02:57.930> we'll<00:02:58.110> admit<00:02:58.260> that<00:02:58.620> the<00:02:58.739> choke<00:02:59.580> points<00:02:59.819> on

00:02:59.899 --> 00:02:59.909 
and we'll admit that the choke points on

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:01.820 
and we'll admit that the choke points on
this<00:03:00.000> map<00:03:00.239> are<00:03:00.420> really<00:03:00.959> interesting<00:03:01.409> because

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
this map are really interesting because

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.470 
this map are really interesting because
they<00:03:02.010> are<00:03:02.159> naval<00:03:02.549> choke<00:03:02.760> points<00:03:03.090> whereas<00:03:03.330> most

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
they are naval choke points whereas most

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.070 
they are naval choke points whereas most
of<00:03:03.659> our<00:03:03.750> maps<00:03:04.790> use<00:03:05.790> more<00:03:06.060> land<00:03:06.420> based<00:03:06.690> combat

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
of our maps use more land based combat

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.110 
of our maps use more land based combat
with<00:03:08.040> the<00:03:08.099> starting<00:03:08.370> point<00:03:08.549> so<00:03:08.730> close<00:03:08.910> to<00:03:09.030> the

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
with the starting point so close to the

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.509 
with the starting point so close to the
water<00:03:09.299> you<00:03:09.510> can<00:03:09.629> really<00:03:10.069> really<00:03:11.069> make<00:03:11.340> great

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
water you can really really make great

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:14.479 
water you can really really make great
use<00:03:11.549> of<00:03:11.700> Navy<00:03:11.970> in<00:03:12.150> this<00:03:13.250> here<00:03:14.250> we<00:03:14.370> have<00:03:14.459> our

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
use of Navy in this here we have our

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:17.229 
use of Navy in this here we have our
Colossus<00:03:15.120> with<00:03:15.299> his<00:03:15.420> halo<00:03:15.750> of<00:03:15.780> interceptors

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 
Colossus with his halo of interceptors

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:19.339 
Colossus with his halo of interceptors
yeah<00:03:18.239> I<00:03:18.269> think<00:03:18.510> at<00:03:18.720> this<00:03:18.840> point<00:03:18.959> I<00:03:19.260> had

00:03:19.339 --> 00:03:19.349 
yeah I think at this point I had

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:21.979 
yeah I think at this point I had
actually<00:03:19.500> noticed<00:03:20.010> a<00:03:20.159> big<00:03:20.519> red<00:03:21.000> circle<00:03:21.569> or

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
actually noticed a big red circle or

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:23.660 
actually noticed a big red circle or
white<00:03:22.200> circle<00:03:22.650> moving<00:03:22.829> down<00:03:23.069> my<00:03:23.220> map<00:03:23.430> but

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
white circle moving down my map but

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.569 
white circle moving down my map but
which<00:03:23.760> one<00:03:23.970> I<00:03:24.290> pretty<00:03:25.290> much<00:03:25.379> knew<00:03:25.980> the<00:03:26.400> game

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:26.579 
which one I pretty much knew the game

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:30.410 
which one I pretty much knew the game
was<00:03:26.640> kind<00:03:26.940> of<00:03:28.129> my<00:03:29.129> walls<00:03:29.340> the<00:03:29.700> walls<00:03:29.849> held<00:03:30.239> out

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
was kind of my walls the walls held out

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.110 
was kind of my walls the walls held out
for<00:03:30.450> for<00:03:31.140> a<00:03:31.170> good<00:03:31.349> couple<00:03:31.829> buckets<00:03:32.340> well<00:03:32.730> maybe

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
for for a good couple buckets well maybe

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.339 
for for a good couple buckets well maybe
I<00:03:33.390> don't<00:03:33.660> know<00:03:33.810> if<00:03:33.870> they<00:03:33.930> lasted<00:03:34.170> that<00:03:34.290> long

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:34.349 
I don't know if they lasted that long

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:37.520 
I don't know if they lasted that long
but<00:03:34.859> uh<00:03:35.269> they<00:03:36.269> look<00:03:36.480> they<00:03:36.660> left<00:03:36.840> a<00:03:36.959> good<00:03:37.170> corpse

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
but uh they look they left a good corpse

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.069 
but uh they look they left a good corpse
will<00:03:37.799> say<00:03:37.950> that<00:03:38.129> yeah<00:03:38.970> here<00:03:39.510> we<00:03:39.629> have<00:03:39.780> the

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:40.079 
will say that yeah here we have the

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:41.449 
will say that yeah here we have the
submersible<00:03:40.620> battleship<00:03:41.010> going<00:03:41.280> back

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
submersible battleship going back

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:44.319 
submersible battleship going back
underwater<00:03:41.879> leaving<00:03:42.359> that<00:03:42.540> one<00:03:42.870> one<00:03:43.709> factory

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:44.329 
underwater leaving that one one factory

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:47.089 
underwater leaving that one one factory
at<00:03:45.329> this<00:03:45.569> point<00:03:45.840> he<00:03:45.959> is<00:03:46.049> now<00:03:46.170> on<00:03:46.349> control<00:03:46.829> to

00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:47.099 
at this point he is now on control to

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:48.319 
at this point he is now on control to
make<00:03:47.250> sure<00:03:47.400> the<00:03:47.519> commander<00:03:47.879> doesn't<00:03:48.150> try<00:03:48.269> to

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:48.329 
make sure the commander doesn't try to

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:51.470 
make sure the commander doesn't try to
escape<00:03:48.599> under<00:03:49.019> water<00:03:49.230> but<00:03:50.099> uh<00:03:50.160> Martin<00:03:50.700> you

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
escape under water but uh Martin you

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.270 
escape under water but uh Martin you
know<00:03:51.599> took<00:03:51.660> it<00:03:51.900> in<00:03:51.989> stride<00:03:52.019> he<00:03:52.709> walked<00:03:52.950> up<00:03:53.129> to

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
know took it in stride he walked up to

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.440 
know took it in stride he walked up to
the<00:03:53.370> Colossus<00:03:53.819> and<00:03:53.849> actually<00:03:54.180> tried<00:03:54.359> to

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
the Colossus and actually tried to

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.720 
the Colossus and actually tried to
overcharge<00:03:54.780> shot<00:03:55.260> him<00:03:55.410> to<00:03:55.530> death<00:03:55.730> which

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
overcharge shot him to death which

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.599 
overcharge shot him to death which
didn't<00:03:57.630> work<00:03:57.690> didn't<00:03:58.260> work<00:03:58.440> but<00:03:58.739> it<00:03:59.280> was<00:03:59.430> it

00:03:59.599 --> 00:03:59.609 
didn't work didn't work but it was it

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:01.030 
didn't work didn't work but it was it
was<00:03:59.730> definitely

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 
was definitely

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.840 
was definitely
