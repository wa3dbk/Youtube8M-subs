bit more comfortably so this is just a
piece<00:00:14.040> of<00:00:14.070> foam<00:00:14.370> that<00:00:14.580> I<00:00:14.639> have<00:00:14.820> in<00:00:14.969> my<00:00:15.089> office

better but we're going to use this as a

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.519 
better but we're going to use this as a
little<00:00:20.850> kind<00:00:21.119> of<00:00:21.150> artificial<00:00:21.510> flute<00:00:21.900> now<00:00:22.380> I

you're<00:00:25.529> going<00:00:25.619> to<00:00:25.680> have<00:00:25.740> to<00:00:25.890> bear<00:00:26.070> with<00:00:26.099> me<00:00:26.460> i'm

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
you're going to have to bear with me i'm

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.179 
you're going to have to bear with me i'm
going<00:00:27.240> to<00:00:27.300> guess<00:00:27.599> it's<00:00:28.109> something<00:00:28.590> along

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
going to guess it's something along

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.640 
going to guess it's something along
these<00:00:29.880> lines<00:00:29.939> but<00:00:30.539> i'm<00:00:30.720> not<00:00:30.869> really<00:00:30.929> sure<00:00:31.199> so

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
these lines but i'm not really sure so

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:32.930 
these lines but i'm not really sure so
it'll<00:00:32.009> be<00:00:32.040> interesting<00:00:32.130> to<00:00:32.550> say<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:32.820> least

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
it'll be interesting to say the least

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.330 
it'll be interesting to say the least
the<00:00:33.930> idea<00:00:34.230> to<00:00:34.530> start<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:34.950> stuff<00:00:35.160> in<00:00:35.309> your

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
the idea to start the stuff in your

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.090 
the idea to start the stuff in your
sternum<00:00:35.700> is<00:00:36.200> it's<00:00:37.200> kind<00:00:37.440> of<00:00:37.469> a<00:00:37.590> convoluted

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
sternum is it's kind of a convoluted

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.920 
sternum is it's kind of a convoluted
movement<00:00:38.610> and<00:00:38.760> many<00:00:38.969> people<00:00:39.180> don't<00:00:39.540> know<00:00:39.690> how

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
movement and many people don't know how

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.990 
movement and many people don't know how
to<00:00:39.960> get<00:00:40.230> it<00:00:40.379> so<00:00:40.680> to<00:00:40.739> make<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.489> movement<00:00:41.730> a

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
to get it so to make the movement a

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.060 
to get it so to make the movement a
little<00:00:42.300> bit<00:00:42.420> larger<00:00:42.690> to<00:00:43.050> start<00:00:43.350> with<00:00:43.530> is

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
little bit larger to start with is

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.670 
little bit larger to start with is
important<00:00:44.700> so<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.600> idea<00:00:45.629> is<00:00:46.110> to<00:00:46.170> hold<00:00:46.469> your

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
important so the idea is to hold your

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.380 
important so the idea is to hold your
flute<00:00:46.950> in<00:00:47.070> whatever<00:00:47.280> position<00:00:47.640> you<00:00:47.969> sit<00:00:48.360> in

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
flute in whatever position you sit in

flute in whatever position you sit in
sitting<00:00:48.989> comfortably<00:00:49.410> in<00:00:49.530> your<00:00:49.559> chair<00:00:49.950> and

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:57.379 
take your spine back rounding your back

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350

underneath your shoulder joint because
most<00:01:29.820> of<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:29.970> time<00:01:30.210> we<00:01:30.390> move<00:01:30.570> our<00:01:30.720> arms<00:01:30.930> around

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
most of the time we move our arms around

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.340 
most of the time we move our arms around
our<00:01:31.950> ribcage<00:01:32.400> so<00:01:33.210> now<00:01:33.479> what<00:01:33.750> we're<00:01:33.869> doing<00:01:33.900> is

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350

we're moving our ribcage underneath our

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.700 
we're moving our ribcage underneath our
arms<00:01:38.369> and<00:01:38.490> our<00:01:38.610> shoulder<00:01:39.000> joint<00:01:39.470> so<00:01:40.470> we're

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
arms and our shoulder joint so we're

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.620 
arms and our shoulder joint so we're
pushing<00:01:40.979> our<00:01:41.250> chest<00:01:41.549> forward<00:01:42.030> arching<00:01:42.509> your

if<00:01:56.640> I<00:01:56.729> wasn't<00:01:57.030> looking<00:01:57.240> at<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.450> camera<00:01:57.689> we<00:01:58.079> can

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
if I wasn't looking at the camera we can

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.889 
if I wasn't looking at the camera we can
actually<00:01:58.409> drop<00:01:58.890> your<00:01:59.250> head<00:01:59.490> down<00:01:59.790> and<00:02:00.090> round

your<00:02:02.969> flute<00:02:03.210> in<00:02:03.420> just<00:02:03.719> about<00:02:03.960> that<00:02:04.170> same

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
your flute in just about that same

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.999 
your flute in just about that same
position<00:02:04.619> and<00:02:05.189> then<00:02:06.090> coming<00:02:06.329> back<00:02:06.420> up<00:02:07.009> arching

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
position and then coming back up arching

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.150 
position and then coming back up arching
your<00:02:08.220> back<00:02:08.280> and<00:02:09.140> then<00:02:10.140> rounding<00:02:10.979> your<00:02:11.129> back

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160

back

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
back

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.070 
back
and<00:02:12.280> then<00:02:12.970> as<00:02:13.180> this<00:02:13.300> becomes<00:02:13.690> a<00:02:13.780> little<00:02:13.990> bit

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
and then as this becomes a little bit

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.750 
and then as this becomes a little bit
easier<00:02:14.500> and<00:02:14.680> you<00:02:14.710> start<00:02:15.070> to<00:02:15.220> feel<00:02:15.430> that<00:02:15.640> your

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
easier and you start to feel that your

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.790 
easier and you start to feel that your
sternum<00:02:16.060> can<00:02:16.360> actually<00:02:16.750> move<00:02:16.990> backwards<00:02:17.590> and

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
sternum can actually move backwards and

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.730 
sternum can actually move backwards and
your<00:02:17.920> chest<00:02:18.280> can<00:02:18.520> somewhat<00:02:18.970> cave<00:02:19.240> in<00:02:19.540> and<00:02:19.780> your

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:20.740 
your chest can somewhat cave in and your

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.280 
your chest can somewhat cave in and your
breastbone<00:02:21.160> can<00:02:21.580> somewhat<00:02:21.970> lift<00:02:22.270> up<00:02:22.540> then<00:02:23.110> you

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
breastbone can somewhat lift up then you

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:24.960 
breastbone can somewhat lift up then you
start<00:02:23.530> to<00:02:23.560> do<00:02:23.740> the<00:02:23.860> movement<00:02:24.220> really<00:02:24.550> really

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
start to do the movement really really

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.440 
start to do the movement really really
small<00:02:25.330> so<00:02:26.290> allow<00:02:26.860> your<00:02:27.190> sternum<00:02:27.640> to<00:02:27.940> slide

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
small so allow your sternum to slide

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.260 
small so allow your sternum to slide
backwards<00:02:29.140> and<00:02:29.380> slide<00:02:29.800> down<00:02:30.210> towards<00:02:31.210> your

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
backwards and slide down towards your

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:34.650 
backwards and slide down towards your
pelvis<00:02:31.510> and<00:02:32.190> then<00:02:33.190> allow<00:02:33.460> your<00:02:33.760> sternum<00:02:34.270> or

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
pelvis and then allow your sternum or

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.050 
pelvis and then allow your sternum or
your<00:02:34.810> breastbone<00:02:35.170> to<00:02:35.530> slide<00:02:35.830> forwards<00:02:36.460> or<00:02:36.790> up

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
your breastbone to slide forwards or up

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.220 
your breastbone to slide forwards or up
and<00:02:37.410> just<00:02:38.410> to<00:02:38.500> get<00:02:38.680> the<00:02:38.830> idea<00:02:39.190> that<00:02:39.280> you<00:02:39.610> can

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
and just to get the idea that you can

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.800 
and just to get the idea that you can
cave<00:02:41.230> your<00:02:41.470> chest<00:02:41.860> and<00:02:42.160> expand<00:02:43.000> and<00:02:43.300> lift<00:02:43.600> your

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
cave your chest and expand and lift your

cave your chest and expand and lift your
chest<00:02:44.100> cave<00:02:45.100> your<00:02:45.490> chest<00:02:45.850> and<00:02:46.120> round<00:02:46.540> your

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
chest cave your chest and round your

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.580 
chest cave your chest and round your
back<00:02:46.930> and<00:02:47.470> then<00:02:48.430> expand<00:02:49.060> your<00:02:49.420> chest<00:02:49.480> and<00:02:50.050> lift

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
back and then expand your chest and lift

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.670 
back and then expand your chest and lift
your<00:02:50.800> breastbone<00:02:50.920> up<00:02:51.430> towards<00:02:51.760> the<00:02:51.850> ceiling

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
your breastbone up towards the ceiling

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.800 
your breastbone up towards the ceiling
now<00:02:53.700> holding<00:02:54.700> the<00:02:54.730> flute<00:02:55.060> in<00:02:55.209> it<00:02:55.600> you<00:02:55.780> can

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
now holding the flute in it you can

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:57.449 
now holding the flute in it you can
actually<00:02:56.110> do<00:02:56.440> it<00:02:56.560> holding<00:02:57.070> it<00:02:57.160> up<00:02:57.220> to<00:02:57.340> your

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
actually do it holding it up to your

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:58.920 
actually do it holding it up to your
lips<00:02:57.670> you<00:02:57.910> can<00:02:58.030> hold<00:02:58.209> it<00:02:58.360> away<00:02:58.570> from<00:02:58.780> your

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
lips you can hold it away from your

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:00.600 
lips you can hold it away from your
hands<00:02:59.410> you<00:02:59.530> can<00:02:59.560> hold<00:02:59.860> it<00:03:00.010> down<00:03:00.160> a<00:03:00.220> little<00:03:00.459> bit

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
hands you can hold it down a little bit

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.220 
hands you can hold it down a little bit
lower<00:03:00.880> you<00:03:01.000> can<00:03:01.239> hold<00:03:01.420> it<00:03:01.570> a<00:03:01.630> little<00:03:01.660> bit

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
lower you can hold it a little bit

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.580 
lower you can hold it a little bit
higher<00:03:03.060> and<00:03:04.060> the<00:03:04.510> idea<00:03:04.810> is<00:03:04.900> to<00:03:05.050> move<00:03:05.380> it<00:03:05.500> around

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
higher and the idea is to move it around

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.500 
higher and the idea is to move it around
as<00:03:05.920> many<00:03:06.130> different<00:03:06.370> positions<00:03:06.640> as<00:03:07.120> you<00:03:07.239> can

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
as many different positions as you can

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.540 
as many different positions as you can
so<00:03:07.930> if<00:03:08.170> you're<00:03:08.350> stuck<00:03:08.650> in<00:03:08.680> this<00:03:08.980> position<00:03:09.430> to

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:09.550 
so if you're stuck in this position to

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:12.840 
so if you're stuck in this position to
play<00:03:09.730> most<00:03:10.270> of<00:03:10.480> the<00:03:10.570> time<00:03:11.310> the<00:03:12.310> idea<00:03:12.580> is<00:03:12.640> to

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
play most of the time the idea is to

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:14.490 
play most of the time the idea is to
move<00:03:13.000> it<00:03:13.180> around<00:03:13.270> a<00:03:13.600> little<00:03:13.630> bit<00:03:13.930> so<00:03:14.200> you<00:03:14.260> not

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
move it around a little bit so you not

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.650 
move it around a little bit so you not
only<00:03:14.530> get<00:03:14.800> your<00:03:14.980> chest<00:03:15.310> to<00:03:15.489> move<00:03:15.730> underneath

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
only get your chest to move underneath

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.350 
only get your chest to move underneath
your<00:03:17.340> shoulders<00:03:18.340> but<00:03:18.549> you<00:03:18.700> also<00:03:18.880> get<00:03:19.150> your

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.360 
your shoulders but you also get your

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.170 
your shoulders but you also get your
shoulders<00:03:19.540> to<00:03:19.870> move<00:03:20.080> on<00:03:20.290> top<00:03:20.500> of<00:03:20.680> your<00:03:20.799> arms<00:03:21.180> so

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
shoulders to move on top of your arms so

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.600 
shoulders to move on top of your arms so
that's<00:03:22.989> one<00:03:23.260> way<00:03:23.290> to<00:03:23.470> try<00:03:23.799> and<00:03:23.920> soften<00:03:24.280> your
