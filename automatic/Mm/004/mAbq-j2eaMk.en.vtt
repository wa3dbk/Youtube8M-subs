00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
in the last Oh fifteen years or so our

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.880 
in the last Oh fifteen years or so our
smart<00:00:29.730> charges<00:00:30.449> what<00:00:30.750> does<00:00:30.840> a<00:00:30.869> smart<00:00:31.230> charger

smart charges what does a smart charger

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.000 
smart charges what does a smart charger
means<00:00:32.420> basically<00:00:33.420> it<00:00:34.050> is<00:00:34.290> not<00:00:34.500> going<00:00:34.920> to

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
means basically it is not going to

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.670 
means basically it is not going to

gotten below that there is a way to

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.990 
gotten below that there is a way to
trick<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.840> charger<00:00:58.500> so<00:00:59.250> that<00:00:59.489> it'll<00:00:59.730> charge

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
ten point five volts what you have to do

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.630 
ten point five volts what you have to do
is<00:01:05.729> get<00:01:05.939> a<00:01:05.970> second<00:01:06.540> battery<00:01:07.220> the<00:01:08.220> second

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
is get a second battery the second

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.850 
is get a second battery the second
battery<00:01:08.970> could<00:01:09.270> be<00:01:09.299> any<00:01:09.630> 12-volt<00:01:10.290> battery<00:01:10.740> it

battery you know some of the racing
batteries<00:01:22.290> are<00:01:22.470> dry<00:01:22.710> cell<00:01:23.479> so<00:01:24.479> let's<00:01:24.750> assume

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
batteries are dry cell so let's assume

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.109 
batteries are dry cell so let's assume
for<00:01:25.290> these<00:01:25.799> for<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.310> purposes<00:01:26.820> of<00:01:26.880> this

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
for these for the purposes of this

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.390 
for these for the purposes of this
demonstration<00:01:27.710> we're<00:01:28.710> going<00:01:28.860> to<00:01:28.920> assume<00:01:29.189> this

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
demonstration we're going to assume this

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.940 
demonstration we're going to assume this
is<00:01:29.610> a<00:01:29.640> dead<00:01:30.030> battery<00:01:30.329> it's<00:01:30.689> not<00:01:30.930> but<00:01:31.350> I<00:01:31.380> didn't

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
is a dead battery it's not but I didn't

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.590 
is a dead battery it's not but I didn't
want<00:01:32.100> to<00:01:32.159> kill<00:01:32.369> my<00:01:32.549> battery<00:01:32.970> just<00:01:33.000> to<00:01:33.360> show

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
want to kill my battery just to show

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.899 
want to kill my battery just to show
this<00:01:33.780> to<00:01:33.840> you<00:01:34.079> let's<00:01:34.979> say<00:01:35.189> this<00:01:35.369> battery<00:01:35.880> I

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
this to you let's say this battery I

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.620 
this to you let's say this battery I
left<00:01:36.180> my<00:01:36.360> light<00:01:36.600> on<00:01:36.630> and<00:01:37.670> it<00:01:38.670> just<00:01:39.119> it's<00:01:39.329> down

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
left my light on and it just it's down

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.560 
left my light on and it just it's down
to<00:01:39.810> about<00:01:40.020> four<00:01:40.380> or<00:01:40.500> five<00:01:40.710> volts<00:01:41.310> so<00:01:42.299> this

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
to about four or five volts so this

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.929 
to about four or five volts so this
smart<00:01:42.990> charger<00:01:43.619> won't<00:01:43.829> charge<00:01:44.460> it<00:01:44.670> it<00:01:44.790> won't

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
smart charger won't charge it it won't

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.830 
smart charger won't charge it it won't
turn<00:01:45.299> on<00:01:45.890> here's<00:01:46.890> what<00:01:47.040> I<00:01:47.070> have<00:01:47.250> to<00:01:47.430> do<00:01:47.840> the

turn on here's what I have to do the

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:49.940 
turn on here's what I have to do the
first<00:01:49.079> thing<00:01:49.320> I'm<00:01:49.439> going<00:01:49.560> to<00:01:49.619> do<00:01:49.799> is

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
first thing I'm going to do is

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.090 
first thing I'm going to do is
disconnect<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.640> battery<00:01:51.090> from<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.299> car<00:01:52.100> most

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
disconnect the battery from the car most

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.460 
disconnect the battery from the car most
cars<00:01:53.460> most<00:01:53.880> modern<00:01:54.360> cars<00:01:54.630> have<00:01:54.750> a<00:01:54.930> lot<00:01:54.990> of<00:01:55.320> very

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
cars most modern cars have a lot of very

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.709 
cars most modern cars have a lot of very
sensitive<00:01:55.939> electronics<00:01:56.939> and<00:01:57.149> computers<00:01:57.689> in

sensitive electronics and computers in

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.770 
sensitive electronics and computers in
them<00:01:58.170> you<00:01:59.130> don't<00:01:59.250> want<00:01:59.399> to<00:01:59.670> be<00:01:59.790> charging<00:02:00.689> the

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
them you don't want to be charging the

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.789 
them you don't want to be charging the
battery<00:02:01.259> and<00:02:01.610> shocking<00:02:02.610> all<00:02:02.790> those

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:03.799 
battery and shocking all those

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:07.130 
battery and shocking all those
components<00:02:04.880> with<00:02:05.880> different<00:02:06.329> voltages<00:02:06.869> than

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
components with different voltages than

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.010 
components with different voltages than
what<00:02:07.350> they're<00:02:07.530> supposed<00:02:07.890> to<00:02:07.979> be<00:02:08.039> seeing

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020 
what they're supposed to be seeing

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:10.600 
what they're supposed to be seeing
so<00:02:09.140> I'm<00:02:09.230> going<00:02:09.410> to<00:02:09.440> disconnect<00:02:09.650> the<00:02:10.100> positive

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
so I'm going to disconnect the positive

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.180 
so I'm going to disconnect the positive
right<00:02:10.760> here<00:02:11.000> okay<00:02:11.960> I've<00:02:12.110> disconnected<00:02:12.530> my

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
right here okay I've disconnected my

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.010 
right here okay I've disconnected my
battery<00:02:13.850> that's<00:02:14.030> in<00:02:14.180> the<00:02:14.330> car<00:02:14.570> this<00:02:14.750> is<00:02:14.810> the

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
battery that's in the car this is the

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.850 
battery that's in the car this is the
dead<00:02:15.230> one<00:02:15.470> and<00:02:15.680> I've<00:02:16.550> connected<00:02:17.380> my<00:02:18.380> dead

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
dead one and I've connected my dead

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.910 
dead one and I've connected my dead
battery<00:02:19.340> to<00:02:20.000> my<00:02:20.120> good<00:02:20.360> battery<00:02:20.810> black<00:02:21.710> the

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
battery to my good battery black the

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.300 
battery to my good battery black the
black<00:02:22.130> red<00:02:22.520> to<00:02:22.760> red<00:02:23.650> so<00:02:24.650> they're<00:02:24.860> connected

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
black red to red so they're connected

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.330 
black red to red so they're connected
together<00:02:25.570> now<00:02:26.570> when<00:02:26.810> I<00:02:26.840> put<00:02:27.200> the<00:02:27.470> charger<00:02:28.160> on

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
together now when I put the charger on

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.520 
together now when I put the charger on
the<00:02:29.090> charge<00:02:29.420> is<00:02:29.540> going<00:02:29.600> to<00:02:29.780> think<00:02:30.050> it's<00:02:30.230> seeing

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
the charge is going to think it's seeing

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.830 
the charge is going to think it's seeing
one<00:02:30.860> battery<00:02:31.370> but<00:02:32.090> it's<00:02:32.240> going<00:02:32.420> to<00:02:32.480> read<00:02:32.660> the

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
one battery but it's going to read the

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.300 
one battery but it's going to read the
voltage<00:02:33.260> of<00:02:33.470> the<00:02:33.560> higher<00:02:33.770> battery<00:02:35.260> so<00:02:36.260> this<00:02:37.130> is

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
voltage of the higher battery so this is

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:43.780 
voltage of the higher battery so this is
what<00:02:37.490> I<00:02:37.520> do<00:02:37.640> I<00:02:38.060> just<00:02:38.450> put<00:02:38.660> the<00:02:38.840> charger<00:02:39.320> on<00:02:42.790> to

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
what I do I just put the charger on to

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:52.960 
what I do I just put the charger on to
the<00:02:43.910> good<00:02:44.120> battery<00:02:51.130> green<00:02:52.130> to<00:02:52.280> red<00:02:52.460> black<00:02:52.730> to

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
the good battery green to red black to

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:54.460 
the good battery green to red black to
black<00:02:53.150> always<00:02:53.630> wear<00:02:53.840> some<00:02:54.080> eye<00:02:54.260> protection

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
black always wear some eye protection

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.540 
black always wear some eye protection
when<00:02:55.040> you're<00:02:55.160> doing<00:02:55.430> this<00:02:56.350> all<00:02:57.350> right<00:02:57.550> now

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.550 
when you're doing this all right now

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:01.420 
when you're doing this all right now
I've<00:02:58.880> got<00:02:59.120> to<00:02:59.150> set<00:02:59.420> the<00:02:59.570> charger<00:03:00.080> not<00:03:00.800> to<00:03:01.010> a<00:03:01.040> low

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
I've got to set the charger not to a low

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.460 
I've got to set the charger not to a low
voltage<00:03:01.790> you<00:03:02.180> see<00:03:02.390> that<00:03:02.570> little<00:03:02.990> light<00:03:03.140> just

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
voltage you see that little light just

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.820 
voltage you see that little light just
went<00:03:03.680> from<00:03:03.860> the<00:03:04.070> first<00:03:05.200> position<00:03:06.200> to<00:03:06.680> the

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830 
went from the first position to the

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:08.590 
went from the first position to the
second<00:03:07.220> position<00:03:07.340> that<00:03:07.880> means<00:03:08.000> it's<00:03:08.240> starting

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
second position that means it's starting

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.840 
second position that means it's starting
to<00:03:08.660> charge<00:03:08.930> but<00:03:09.770> I<00:03:09.800> want<00:03:10.010> to<00:03:10.100> go<00:03:10.250> up<00:03:10.340> to<00:03:10.550> at

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
to charge but I want to go up to at

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:15.760 
to charge but I want to go up to at
least<00:03:11.120> eight<00:03:11.960> 10<00:03:12.350> 12<00:03:12.500> minutes<00:03:14.620> because<00:03:15.620> I've

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:15.770 
least eight 10 12 minutes because I've

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:18.580 
least eight 10 12 minutes because I've
got<00:03:15.890> a<00:03:15.920> really<00:03:16.010> dead<00:03:16.459> battery<00:03:16.940> and<00:03:17.260> I've<00:03:18.260> got

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
got a really dead battery and I've got

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.230 
got a really dead battery and I've got
to<00:03:18.680> give<00:03:18.830> it<00:03:18.950> a<00:03:18.980> good<00:03:19.160> charge<00:03:19.459> I<00:03:19.640> can't<00:03:19.880> just<00:03:20.120> do

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:20.240 
to give it a good charge I can't just do

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:22.840 
to give it a good charge I can't just do
a<00:03:20.270> trickle<00:03:20.720> charge<00:03:20.750> or<00:03:21.350> a<00:03:21.380> 2<00:03:21.620> amp<00:03:21.830> charger<00:03:22.490> it

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.850 
a trickle charge or a 2 amp charger it

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:27.190 
a trickle charge or a 2 amp charger it
won't<00:03:22.910> work<00:03:23.360> very<00:03:23.390> well<00:03:24.220> so<00:03:25.480> now<00:03:26.480> I'm<00:03:26.660> hooked

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
won't work very well so now I'm hooked

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.550 
won't work very well so now I'm hooked
up<00:03:27.470> with<00:03:27.860> two<00:03:28.100> batteries<00:03:28.660> one<00:03:29.660> charger<00:03:30.350> and

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
up with two batteries one charger and

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.630 
up with two batteries one charger and
it's<00:03:31.070> charging<00:03:31.520> before<00:03:32.530> I<00:03:33.530> didn't<00:03:34.310> show<00:03:34.459> this

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640 
it's charging before I didn't show this

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:35.920 
it's charging before I didn't show this
to<00:03:34.850> you<00:03:34.970> because<00:03:35.090> I<00:03:35.330> don't<00:03:35.390> have<00:03:35.630> a<00:03:35.660> dead

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
to you because I don't have a dead

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.140 
to you because I don't have a dead
battery<00:03:36.170> but<00:03:36.560> before<00:03:36.950> the<00:03:37.130> battery<00:03:37.550> charger

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
battery but before the battery charger

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.870 
battery but before the battery charger
would<00:03:38.330> not<00:03:38.510> even<00:03:38.840> start<00:03:39.350> up<00:03:39.560> would<00:03:40.280> not<00:03:40.490> start

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:40.880 
would not even start up would not start

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.199 
would not even start up would not start
charging<00:03:41.390> the<00:03:41.420> dead<00:03:41.690> battery<00:03:42.910> what<00:03:43.910> you<00:03:44.030> want

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:44.209 
charging the dead battery what you want

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:47.430 
charging the dead battery what you want
to<00:03:44.270> do<00:03:44.390> is<00:03:44.540> let<00:03:44.780> this<00:03:44.990> run<00:03:45.530> for<00:03:45.560> about<00:03:46.010> an<00:03:46.280> hour

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
to do is let this run for about an hour

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.470 
to do is let this run for about an hour
when<00:03:48.440> you're<00:03:48.620> charging<00:03:48.920> batteries<00:03:49.490> you<00:03:49.730> need

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
when you're charging batteries you need

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.260 
when you're charging batteries you need
to<00:03:50.720> be<00:03:51.110> paying<00:03:51.350> attention<00:03:51.560> because<00:03:52.430> they<00:03:52.700> can

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:53.270 
to be paying attention because they can

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:56.980 
to be paying attention because they can
get<00:03:53.950> too<00:03:54.950> hot<00:03:55.220> if<00:03:55.670> they<00:03:55.940> get<00:03:56.150> too<00:03:56.360> hot<00:03:56.390> it<00:03:56.780> means

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:56.990 
get too hot if they get too hot it means

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:59.440 
get too hot if they get too hot it means
you've<00:03:57.170> got<00:03:57.350> a<00:03:57.380> bad<00:03:57.650> battery<00:03:58.190> and<00:03:58.490> you've<00:03:59.330> got

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450 
you've got a bad battery and you've got

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:01.390 
you've got a bad battery and you've got
to<00:03:59.540> buy<00:03:59.660> a<00:03:59.690> new<00:03:59.810> one<00:04:00.230> but<00:04:00.709> if<00:04:00.800> they<00:04:00.920> get<00:04:01.040> warm

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
to buy a new one but if they get warm

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.910 
to buy a new one but if they get warm
that's<00:04:01.790> ok<00:04:02.270> so<00:04:03.140> I'm<00:04:03.230> going<00:04:03.380> to<00:04:03.440> come<00:04:03.560> back<00:04:03.740> in

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:03.920 
that's ok so I'm going to come back in

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.900 
that's ok so I'm going to come back in
about<00:04:04.130> an<00:04:04.310> hour<00:04:04.520> and<00:04:06.640> then<00:04:07.640> I'm<00:04:07.760> going<00:04:07.850> to

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:07.910 
about an hour and then I'm going to

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:09.940 
about an hour and then I'm going to
check<00:04:08.120> the<00:04:08.300> voltage<00:04:08.690> on<00:04:08.870> this<00:04:09.080> battery<00:04:09.770> that's

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:09.950 
check the voltage on this battery that's

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:12.400 
check the voltage on this battery that's
a<00:04:10.100> dead<00:04:10.310> battery<00:04:10.550> if<00:04:10.940> it<00:04:11.150> gets<00:04:11.360> up<00:04:11.570> to<00:04:11.600> about<00:04:11.780> 10

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.410 
a dead battery if it gets up to about 10

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:16.000 
a dead battery if it gets up to about 10
or<00:04:12.739> 11<00:04:13.070> volts<00:04:13.940> then<00:04:14.720> I<00:04:14.750> can<00:04:15.110> discontinue<00:04:15.860> this

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.010 
or 11 volts then I can discontinue this

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:19.990 
or 11 volts then I can discontinue this
process<00:04:16.609> and<00:04:16.910> charge<00:04:17.180> directly<00:04:17.840> to<00:04:18.229> that<00:04:19.000> low

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
process and charge directly to that low

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.650 
process and charge directly to that low
voltage<00:04:20.630> battery

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
voltage battery

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:25.970 
voltage battery
now<00:04:21.930> put<00:04:22.170> my<00:04:22.290> other<00:04:22.410> run<00:04:22.680> away<00:04:24.110> so<00:04:25.110> this<00:04:25.350> is<00:04:25.410> how

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:25.980 
now put my other run away so this is how

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:30.140 
now put my other run away so this is how
you<00:04:26.040> can<00:04:26.520> get<00:04:26.670> around<00:04:27.950> having<00:04:28.950> a<00:04:29.040> really<00:04:29.490> low

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
you can get around having a really low
