00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:06.410
 or youtube people talk about how 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:10.139
 are the things 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:12.900
 to start how are they going to see here have 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:17.160
 an excellent finish some are from 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.880
 solid wood and some other against 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.609
 plates 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.289
 have several advantages and disadvantages the 

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:25.970
 The main disadvantage is that it is less 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:28.789
 resistant that 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:31.519
 These are made in the factory because 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:34.160
 are made of mdf and those that 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:38.360
 they usually sell are plywood which is 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:40.680
 more resistant plus a disadvantage of mdf 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.900
 is that 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.740
 on contact with water deteriorates 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:48.740
 easily sponge these doors 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:48.740
 they come 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:55.980
 they are covered by a base and you 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.310
 they sell like that without painting white and then you 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.440
 you already have to paint them 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:02.629
 Y 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.140
 no I would not recommend this kind of 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:07.900
 doors I think a 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.940
 not very resistant now how is it 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:13.090
 inside 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:17.770
 there they have a front door like 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:20.780
 can see has a frame in the part d 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:23.869
 of the sheet metal is 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:26.210
 is reinforced with wood and has only 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:28.620
 two sticks in the center which is what 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:31.920
 supports mdf 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:36.850
 as you can see two sticks up and two 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:42.890
 sticks down a small frame below 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:47.250
 the mdf that is pressed and still formed 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:51.960
 a ring something an ornament 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:55.250
 and this on the one hand the mf is smooth and 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:59.510
 the other side has a rough finish 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:02.690
 there are only two sticks two two slats 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:05.780
 that they hold let's say the structure that 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:09.800
 is normally a kick was not seen 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:12.310
 too fragile good if they had any 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:15.590
 curious how the doors were like 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.490
 made inside the factory because there 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.620
 there is the result 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:21.790
 these are 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.909
 Y 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.970
 if you still want to buy this kind of 

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:29.220
 doors you can 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:32.790
 the only advantage that I see is that 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:35.380
 they are of an excellent finish they are so that 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:40.030
 they are pretty 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:42.510
 and the doors against player plates 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.380
 the advantage would be that they are resistant 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.290
 I hope you liked this video 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:49.830
 subscribe and see you for the 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.830
