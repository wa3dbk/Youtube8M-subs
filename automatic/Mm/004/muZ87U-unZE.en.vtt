00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.320
 do this for example on a local disk d 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.570
 a little below you can see 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.850
 information about your home group if 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.200

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:31.500
 any documents or print 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:33.180
 to a remote printer a little bit lower 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.280
 we located the computer menu in 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.770
 which you can see your sections and 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.900
 go to one of them at the bottom of us 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.290

 main part of the screen you can see 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.619
 items you will work with 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.610
 by default the explorer refers to 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.710
 libraries 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.270
 however you can also immediately 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.330
 navigate the computer menu 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.340

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.980
 with files it starts with the menu 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.890
 computer we can also pin menu 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:05.420
 computer on our desktop for 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.820
 this must be right-clicked 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.520
 mouse on the desktop and go to 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.790
 personalization is now necessary to click 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:15.440
 change desktop icons 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.980
 activate the computer checkbox and press 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.740
 by key 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.870
 after that we can close the window 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:23.240
 personalization and now put in 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:26.510
 the desktop has a shortcut to start 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:29.780
 computer menu you see that here 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:32.420
 Our sections are displayed, that is, I have 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.280
 here is section c and section d as well 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.520
 displaying device with removable 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.560
 carriers and now attention you can 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.510
 see the biggest innovations in 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.000
 the conductor is a ribbon interface 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.130
 which we have displayed at the top 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.590
 parts of the conductor as you see here 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.840
 now a lot of buttons 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.930
 it is quite convenient to click on them and 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:56.020
 now here are all the most common 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.400
 used commands that is now 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:00.380
 perform everyday activities became 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.970
 a little bit easier to 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.220
 deal with these commands i 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:06.050
 I recommend to go to the local disk d 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.390
 or to the place where you are 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:10.790
 your documents and after that we can 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:14.120
 start learning a new interface 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.269
 we can click on some file 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.370
 at 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:19.220
 and see that we have tabs here 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:21.709
 first tab main which contains 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:24.200
 clipboard buttons here we are 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:26.120
 we can press a copy button for 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.019
 order to copy the selected file 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.000
 to clipboard 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:30.739
 after we do this we can 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.530
 move to another location and 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:35.750
 press the button to insert as we can 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.940
 cut this file and attention 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.860
 copy the path sometimes during 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:43.459
 install some device 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:45.500
 you must specify the path to the driver is 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:48.050
 device and it is not always easy 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.670
 as it is necessary to copy this way 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:52.760
 with this button do it 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:53.440
 much easier further we should group 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.610
 buttons 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:58.160
 arrange where we can for example 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:59.720
 move the selected item in one 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.670
 from presented here by here 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:04.130
 displayed as recently visited 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:05.110
 folders and standard folders such as 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:07.730

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:08.310

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:10.650

 choose a different location by selecting 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:15.330

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:17.880
 which you can press a button to move 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:21.239
 and the selected item will be removed from this. 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.980
 places and moved to your specified also 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:25.710
 we have copying option here 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:27.770
 This item is different from 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:30.300
 move so that the item will be 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:34.080
 be here and in the specified 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:35.700
 you place further follows the option to remove 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.570

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.340

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.440

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:55.229
 windows 8 happens immediate 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:58.139
