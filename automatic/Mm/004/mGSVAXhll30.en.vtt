00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.970
 with vitamin e 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.890
 this is the cleaner and this is from the 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.650
 same line but it's the facial scrub 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.240
 I finished both of them the truth is that 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.279
 I liked them a lot I have a 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.009
 review about this line of products by

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.290
 a link however 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.780
 I do not know if I'm going to buy them again 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.910
 because if I will buy them again but not 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.830
 I know if at this time because I always 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.080
 like to be changing and trying new 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:47.880
 things for skin care ie 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.400
 he will buy them again but for the 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:53.430
 time I will try some water so 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:55.530
 next is a volleyball cream this 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.230
 law complete facial lotion with a factor 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:01.320
 of solar protection 15 this puppy of 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.960
 118 milliliters lasts me a lot I have 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.540
 this is the third is the third time that 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.220
 I finish this puppy definitely what 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.369
 I'll buy it again think my 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.259
 favorite face cream for the day 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.880
 because nothing else has the factor 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:18.750
 solar protection but that is for skin 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.550
 mixed or for skin not from normal to fat or 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.820
 be normal mixed or fat can use 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:25.680
 This moisturizing cream is the same as in 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.420
 more dry areas of my skin but I do not 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.570
 leave the greasy face this 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:34.110
 definitely buy it again 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:36.740
 the next lake is this cleaner 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.810
 7 fex tickets 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.670
 I really finished all the 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.950
 products that use this line I finish 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.810
 to upload a couple of days ago a review 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.130
 about all these products 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.380
 I think that if I would buy it again 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.030
 but I repeat as the cleaner of 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.740
 palm trees I want to try something new 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.200
 right now because I always like to be 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.270
 changing my routine of caring for the 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.119
 skin of the face then if I go back to 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:01.640
 I buy is not very good but 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:04.460
 the moment not if they want to know more about them 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:07.400
 I leave the link about that review 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.560
 The following is a classic and is all 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.680
 I have the time in my kit 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:16.160
 makeup or makeup this is a 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:18.170
 mac exploit this serves to hydrate 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.730
 the face and serves as a tonic serves to 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.880
 moisturize the face before makeup 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:25.810
 It serves to leave a more equal finish and 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.800
 more natural after makeup 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.959
 simple is simply one of those things 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.610
 I've used a lot, I think that 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:33.770
 throughout my life I've finished with 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.930
 a 5 or 6 bottles of these I like 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:38.239
 much much much is a 100% product 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.519
 recommended and it really is like a 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:42.590
 classic I do not think everyone who 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:44.930
 use sea products use fix plan 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.390
 next from revlon kolerstein this 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:50.090
 makeup remover I liked it very much because 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:52.220
 nothing else dissolves the product 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.530
 the makeup really takes it away from you 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:57.530
 very well it does not irritate me almost always 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:03:00.650
 makeups that are to remove 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.209
 long-lasting makeup like this 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.540
 all makeups of that nature 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:07.250
 they tend to be very aggressive with my skin 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.870
 especially on the skin around the 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:12.720
 eyes is very very very delicate 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:15.510
 and with almost everyone it happens to me that the eyes 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:18.690
 it irritates me very much and then with that 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:22.380
 it does not happen to me that's the neutrogena 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:24.720
 and it must cost about 125 pesos and this 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.460
 It costs 100 pesos and I like it very much 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.410
 it lasted quite a long time to have 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:30.810
 lasted as two gave me anti activity 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:33.380
 spot roldán of meat 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:36.060
 this is a roll on for when you have 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:38.700
 granites has a metal ball and 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.380
 has a treatment to remove the 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.880
 infection reduce the infection of 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.790
 granites I like a lot about everything 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.350
 because when you have like a granite and 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.930
 right in the middle of the forehead in places 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:51.870
 very visible you can put this you what 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.970
 you let it dry and you put makeup 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:55.440
 over then you have something that is 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:58.290
 protecting the granite so that the 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.240
 makeup there is no delivery to infect what 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.430
 more however at the same time this 

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:04.460
 is helping not only to serve as 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:07.920
 makeup barrier but also 

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:10.560
 It deflates by the metal tip and is 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:14.700
 a treatment then while your 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:16.140
 day your granite is being treated very 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.750
 well I like it a lot I'm going to go back to 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:21.510
 buy lasted me a lot of time worth 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.860
 It's really worth a year of hard work 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:25.289
 have given 10 months 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:27.150
 the next one and it's terrible that I already 

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:29.909
 but this is a palm is the 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:32.159
 perfect fiction demand I have a 

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:34.469
 review of this recently and I think that 

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:37.680
 I bought it in February March April May 

00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:40.590
 it's three months but I do use it all 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:42.719
 every day I use it even days 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:45.210
 I did not wear makeup 

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:48.270
 on top of the moisturizer, nothing more 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:50.610
 equalize the texture of my skin then 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:53.490
 the truth is worth 30 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:56.189
 milliliters one ounce but I used it three 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:58.949
 whole months or almost 90 days 

00:04:56.189 --> 00:05:01.439

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:04.020
