okay in Chapter five on fatty acids and
fish<00:00:17.270> fallacies<00:00:17.930> you<00:00:18.770> talk<00:00:19.250> about<00:00:19.520> that<00:00:19.699> the

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:19.850 
fish fallacies you talk about that the

fairly recent over the last several

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:34.970 
decades that we realized one of the

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.389 
decades that we realized one of the
problems<00:00:35.450> we<00:00:35.690> have<00:00:35.960> in<00:00:36.200> Western<00:00:36.680> culture<00:00:37.160> and

problems we have in Western culture and

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:39.310 
problems we have in Western culture and
specifically<00:00:38.120> a<00:00:38.210> lot<00:00:38.540> here<00:00:38.809> in<00:00:38.840> the<00:00:38.989> United

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:39.320 
specifically a lot here in the United

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.830 
specifically a lot here in the United

saturated fat and saturated fat comes

wild fowl or if you take their milk that

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:08.980 
wild fowl or if you take their milk that
this<00:01:06.560> is<00:01:06.770> saturated<00:01:07.549> fat<00:01:07.850> and<00:01:08.029> your<00:01:08.450> body<00:01:08.630> has

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
this is saturated fat and your body has

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.669 
this is saturated fat and your body has
zero<00:01:09.590> need<00:01:10.219> for<00:01:10.249> it<00:01:10.700> your<00:01:11.479> body<00:01:11.689> cannot<00:01:12.350> use

00:01:12.669 --> 00:01:12.679 
zero need for it your body cannot use

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:15.550 
zero need for it your body cannot use
saturated<00:01:13.549> fat<00:01:13.759> so<00:01:14.029> it<00:01:14.179> ends<00:01:14.450> up<00:01:14.539> clogging<00:01:15.350> the

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
saturated fat so it ends up clogging the

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.339 
saturated fat so it ends up clogging the
arteries<00:01:16.130> and<00:01:16.959> distorting<00:01:17.959> the

come in green vegetables so let's start

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:32.800 
come in green vegetables so let's start
with<00:02:31.490> that<00:02:31.550> would<00:02:31.970> they<00:02:32.120> come<00:02:32.360> in<00:02:32.480> a<00:02:32.600> green

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
with that would they come in a green

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.810 
with that would they come in a green
vegetable<00:02:33.080> that<00:02:33.530> you<00:02:33.680> cook<00:02:33.980> and<00:02:34.190> the<00:02:34.550> answer

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
vegetable that you cook and the answer

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.630 
vegetable that you cook and the answer
is<00:02:34.850> no<00:02:35.090> because<00:02:35.840> once<00:02:36.380> you<00:02:36.620> cook<00:02:37.010> the

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
is no because once you cook the

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.030 
is no because once you cook the

something it becomes a carcinogen and

eat fish and most people are probably

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.260 
eat fish and most people are probably
lying<00:03:33.650> because<00:03:33.980> people<00:03:34.730> aren't<00:03:34.880> buying<00:03:34.970> a

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:36.770 
whole lot more fish so they're out

in<00:03:47.300> the<00:03:47.480> fish<00:03:47.690> industry<00:03:47.989> a<00:03:48.470> great<00:03:49.100> idea<00:03:49.640> is<00:03:49.900> to

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
in the fish industry a great idea is to

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.100 
in the fish industry a great idea is to
sell<00:03:51.620> fish<00:03:52.340> oil<00:03:52.640> to<00:03:52.880> people<00:03:53.239> because<00:03:53.450> fish<00:03:53.870> oil

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:54.110 
sell fish oil to people because fish oil

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:56.560 
sell fish oil to people because fish oil
