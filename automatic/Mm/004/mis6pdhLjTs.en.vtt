00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
to know me

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:11.550 
to know me
or<00:03:07.510> make<00:03:07.690> fun<00:03:08.250> and<00:03:09.250> it<00:03:09.489> did<00:03:09.640> suck<00:03:10.000> but<00:03:10.480> I<00:03:10.840> mean

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
or make fun and it did suck but I mean

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.500 
or make fun and it did suck but I mean
obviously<00:03:12.280> they<00:03:12.940> were<00:03:13.030> doing<00:03:13.269> that<00:03:13.360> to

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
obviously they were doing that to

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.460 
obviously they were doing that to
impress<00:03:13.810> their<00:03:14.080> friends<00:03:14.590> and

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
impress their friends and

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.620 
impress their friends and
I<00:03:15.640> don't<00:03:16.640> think<00:03:16.850> that<00:03:16.940> they<00:03:17.060> really<00:03:17.300> like

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
I don't think that they really like

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.570 
I don't think that they really like
disliked<00:03:18.140> me<00:03:18.350> or<00:03:18.470> anything<00:03:18.650> so<00:03:19.070> it<00:03:19.370> would<00:03:19.490> be

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 
disliked me or anything so it would be

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.120 
disliked me or anything so it would be
