00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:11.960 
this one's called Kiwi the one airstrip

this one's called Kiwi the one airstrip
that<00:00:12.140> you<00:00:12.260> see<00:00:12.470> in<00:00:12.680> the<00:00:12.830> picture<00:00:13.099> here<00:00:13.280> in<00:00:13.370> the

seconds from kiwidoc to kiwi at approach
speed<00:00:22.039> it's<00:00:22.640> two<00:00:22.940> and<00:00:22.970> a<00:00:23.180> half<00:00:23.390> hour<00:00:23.630> walk

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:27.730 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.750 

this<00:00:28.330> again<00:00:28.660> is<00:00:28.930> what<00:00:29.260> we<00:00:29.380> call<00:00:29.619> a<00:00:29.920> one-way

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:30.760 
this again is what we call a one-way

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:35.160 
this again is what we call a one-way
airstrip<00:00:33.420> again<00:00:34.420> when<00:00:34.690> you're<00:00:34.809> coming<00:00:34.989> up

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:35.170 
airstrip again when you're coming up

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.260 
airstrip again when you're coming up
over<00:00:35.590> this<00:00:35.770> little<00:00:36.190> village<00:00:36.579> here<00:00:36.610> is<00:00:36.970> the<00:00:37.090> key

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:37.270 
over this little village here is the key

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:38.580 
over this little village here is the key
point<00:00:37.480> and<00:00:37.750> you<00:00:37.900> have<00:00:37.930> to<00:00:38.140> be<00:00:38.230> at<00:00:38.320> a<00:00:38.350> certain

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:38.590 
point and you have to be at a certain

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:40.439 
point and you have to be at a certain
altitude<00:00:38.949> which<00:00:39.489> puts<00:00:39.790> you<00:00:39.879> on<00:00:39.910> the<00:00:40.210> glide

00:00:40.439 --> 00:00:40.449 
altitude which puts you on the glide

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:43.200 
altitude which puts you on the glide
slope<00:00:40.680> very<00:00:41.680> high<00:00:42.010> illusions<00:00:42.699> in<00:00:42.879> here<00:00:43.090> it's

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.210 
slope very high illusions in here it's

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.420 
slope very high illusions in here it's
very<00:00:43.510> difficult<00:00:44.080> to<00:00:44.260> fly<00:00:44.379> just<00:00:44.500> visually<00:00:45.129> into

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:45.430 
very difficult to fly just visually into

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:47.280 
very difficult to fly just visually into
these<00:00:45.550> and<00:00:45.790> fly<00:00:45.940> the<00:00:46.000> proper<00:00:46.600> glide<00:00:46.839> slope<00:00:47.110> and

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:47.290 
these and fly the proper glide slope and

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.410 
these and fly the proper glide slope and
so<00:00:47.410> they<00:00:47.530> have<00:00:47.680> benchmarks<00:00:48.339> along<00:00:48.879> the<00:00:49.239> way<00:00:49.360> so

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:49.420 
so they have benchmarks along the way so

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.540 
so they have benchmarks along the way so
certain<00:00:50.050> altitude<00:00:50.470> over<00:00:50.800> that<00:00:50.920> village<00:00:51.309> and

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:51.550 
certain altitude over that village and

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.850 
certain altitude over that village and
we're<00:00:51.820> on<00:00:51.970> the<00:00:52.269> proper<00:00:52.570> glide<00:00:52.780> slope<00:00:53.080> and<00:00:53.650> then

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:53.860 
we're on the proper glide slope and then

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:54.990 
we're on the proper glide slope and then
you<00:00:54.010> keep<00:00:54.190> the<00:00:54.220> picture<00:00:54.640> looking<00:00:54.850> the<00:00:54.970> same

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.000 
you keep the picture looking the same

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.939 
you keep the picture looking the same
remember<00:00:55.540> that<00:00:55.660> airstrip<00:00:56.050> sloping<00:00:56.500> up<00:00:56.710> at

00:00:56.939 --> 00:00:56.949 
remember that airstrip sloping up at

00:00:56.949 --> 00:00:59.310 
remember that airstrip sloping up at
fifteen<00:00:57.460> percent<00:00:57.909> and<00:00:58.180> it<00:00:58.690> doesn't<00:00:59.019> look<00:00:59.260> like

00:00:59.310 --> 00:00:59.320 
fifteen percent and it doesn't look like

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.560 
fifteen percent and it doesn't look like
it<00:00:59.589> at<00:00:59.680> all<00:00:59.800> coming<00:01:00.550> up<00:01:00.760> on<00:01:00.910> this<00:01:01.059> next<00:01:01.329> Ridge

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:01.570 
it at all coming up on this next Ridge

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:02.689 
it at all coming up on this next Ridge
right<00:01:01.780> here

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
right here

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.219 
right here
then<00:01:03.699> we're<00:01:03.940> can<00:01:04.239> no<00:01:04.420> longer<00:01:04.690> get<00:01:04.960> out<00:01:05.080> of

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:05.229 
then we're can no longer get out of

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:05.520 
then we're can no longer get out of
there

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:05.530 
there

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:07.950 
there
the<00:01:05.649> only<00:01:05.860> way<00:01:05.979> out<00:01:06.190> is<00:01:06.220> turn<00:01:06.789> around<00:01:06.820> 180<00:01:07.600> and

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:07.960 
the only way out is turn around 180 and

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.779 
the only way out is turn around 180 and
back<00:01:08.110> out<00:01:08.289> the<00:01:08.470> valley<00:01:08.649> we<00:01:08.860> just<00:01:09.039> came<00:01:09.190> up<00:01:09.250> you

00:01:09.779 --> 00:01:09.789 
back out the valley we just came up you

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:12.600 
back out the valley we just came up you
cannot<00:01:10.270> out<00:01:10.570> climb<00:01:10.930> anything<00:01:11.560> up<00:01:12.100> ahead<00:01:12.490> of

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 
cannot out climb anything up ahead of

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.719 
cannot out climb anything up ahead of
you<00:01:12.729> here<00:01:13.000> it's<00:01:13.240> just<00:01:13.800> even<00:01:14.800> the<00:01:14.920> Kodiak<00:01:15.280> empty

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:15.729 
you here it's just even the Kodiak empty

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:18.060 
you here it's just even the Kodiak empty
can't<00:01:16.090> doubt<00:01:16.270> climate<00:01:16.720> so<00:01:17.590> we're<00:01:17.740> committed

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.070
