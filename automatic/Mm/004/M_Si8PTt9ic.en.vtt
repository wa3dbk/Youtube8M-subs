so<00:02:42.780> just<00:02:42.989> give<00:02:43.110> me<00:02:43.140> a<00:02:43.260> bit<00:02:43.560> of<00:02:43.650> a<00:02:43.709> more<00:02:43.890> of<00:02:43.920> a

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
so just give me a bit of a more of a

00:02:44.040 --> 00:03:07.900 
so just give me a bit of a more of a
full<00:02:44.310> range<00:02:44.550> of<00:02:44.849> what<00:02:45.000> they<00:02:45.120> can<00:02:45.209> do

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.700 

so<00:03:08.910> as<00:03:09.120> we<00:03:09.300> can<00:03:09.420> see<00:03:09.480> with<00:03:09.900> our<00:03:09.930> little<00:03:10.230> test

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:10.710 
so as we can see with our little test

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:12.950 
so as we can see with our little test
there<00:03:10.920> that<00:03:11.190> they<00:03:11.940> do<00:03:12.090> pack<00:03:12.420> a<00:03:12.450> powerful<00:03:12.720> punch

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:12.960 
there that they do pack a powerful punch

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.540 
there that they do pack a powerful punch
they<00:03:13.320> do<00:03:13.380> have<00:03:13.620> a<00:03:13.650> lot<00:03:13.830> of<00:03:13.950> good<00:03:14.070> sound<00:03:14.340> coming

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550 
they do have a lot of good sound coming

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:19.130 
they do have a lot of good sound coming
from<00:03:14.670> their<00:03:14.970> small<00:03:17.000> brain<00:03:18.000> part<00:03:18.750> of<00:03:18.810> that<00:03:18.930> is

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
from their small brain part of that is

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.440 
from their small brain part of that is
the<00:03:19.500> speaker's<00:03:20.490> themselves<00:03:20.610> are<00:03:21.120> made<00:03:21.300> out<00:03:21.420> of

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
the speaker's themselves are made out of

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.270 
the speaker's themselves are made out of
acrylic<00:03:21.840> plastic<00:03:22.140> and<00:03:22.830> of<00:03:22.950> course<00:03:23.130> you<00:03:23.190> got

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
acrylic plastic and of course you got

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.450 
acrylic plastic and of course you got
the<00:03:23.520> side<00:03:24.210> firing<00:03:24.780> passive<00:03:25.530> woofers<00:03:25.860> so<00:03:26.370> all

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:26.460 
the side firing passive woofers so all

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:27.590 
the side firing passive woofers so all
the<00:03:26.580> sound<00:03:26.760> that<00:03:26.850> gets<00:03:27.000> trapped<00:03:27.210> inside<00:03:27.420> of

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
the sound that gets trapped inside of

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.000 
the sound that gets trapped inside of
there<00:03:27.810> comes<00:03:28.170> out<00:03:28.320> through<00:03:28.500> these<00:03:28.620> passive

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
there comes out through these passive

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.670 
there comes out through these passive
woofers<00:03:29.310> it<00:03:29.460> kind<00:03:29.640> of<00:03:29.670> gives<00:03:29.820> it<00:03:29.880> a<00:03:29.940> nice<00:03:30.150> sound

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
woofers it kind of gives it a nice sound

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.840 
woofers it kind of gives it a nice sound
so<00:03:31.680> it's<00:03:31.800> a<00:03:31.830> possible<00:03:32.160> troubleshooting<00:03:32.640> tips

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
so it's a possible troubleshooting tips

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.930 
so it's a possible troubleshooting tips
with<00:03:33.120> the<00:03:33.330> CRS<00:03:33.950> speakers<00:03:34.950> is<00:03:35.220> not<00:03:35.610> getting<00:03:35.820> any

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
with the CRS speakers is not getting any

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.340 
with the CRS speakers is not getting any
sound<00:03:36.120> you'll<00:03:36.360> make<00:03:36.480> sure<00:03:36.600> the<00:03:36.810> volume<00:03:36.930> is<00:03:37.230> up

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350

on the control wheel also make sure that

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.130 
on the control wheel also make sure that
the<00:03:41.220> headphone<00:03:42.120> jack<00:03:42.150> is<00:03:42.630> plucked<00:03:42.870> firmly

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
the headphone jack is plucked firmly

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:44.990 
the headphone jack is plucked firmly
into<00:03:43.470> your<00:03:43.500> device<00:03:43.830> if<00:03:44.400> you're<00:03:44.580> using<00:03:44.700> it<00:03:44.910> with

sometimes<00:03:47.489> the<00:03:47.610> case<00:03:47.760> your<00:03:47.970> skin<00:03:48.180> can<00:03:48.450> get<00:03:48.660> in

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
sometimes the case your skin can get in

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.870 
sometimes the case your skin can get in
the<00:03:48.810> way<00:03:48.959> so<00:03:49.560> maybe<00:03:49.980> take<00:03:50.250> that<00:03:50.400> off<00:03:50.550> and<00:03:50.790> just

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
the way so maybe take that off and just

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.070 
the way so maybe take that off and just
make<00:03:51.030> sure<00:03:51.150> it's<00:03:51.360> plugged<00:03:51.480> all<00:03:51.690> the<00:03:51.780> way<00:03:51.900> down

make sure it's plugged all the way down
in<00:03:52.260> there<00:03:53.120> make<00:03:54.120> sure<00:03:54.270> it's<00:03:54.420> firmly<00:03:54.630> planted

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
in there make sure it's firmly planted

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:59.300 
in there make sure it's firmly planted
inside<00:03:55.260> of<00:03:55.560> the<00:03:55.620> headphone<00:03:55.950> jack<00:03:57.290> and<00:03:58.310> if
