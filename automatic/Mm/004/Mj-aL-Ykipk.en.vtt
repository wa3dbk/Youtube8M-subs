so<00:01:16.439> you<00:01:16.560> can<00:01:16.680> see<00:01:16.830> it<00:01:17.130> Sperling<00:01:18.740> like<00:01:19.740> no

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
so you can see it Sperling like no

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.469 
so you can see it Sperling like no
tomorrow<00:01:20.119> it's<00:01:21.119> uh<00:01:21.390> it's<00:01:21.689> it's<00:01:22.259> very<00:01:22.560> nice

here is it's the end of the day today
here<00:01:29.340> is<00:01:31.009> the<00:01:32.009> drop<00:01:32.880> checker<00:01:33.180> I<00:01:34.009> really<00:01:35.009> like

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
here is the drop checker I really like

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:44.389 
here is the drop checker I really like
this<00:01:35.369> one<00:01:35.579> it's<00:01:41.960> getting<00:01:42.960> much<00:01:43.110> better<00:01:43.399> so

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
this one it's getting much better so

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.319 
this one it's getting much better so
it's<00:01:44.549> a<00:01:45.409> it's<00:01:46.409> a<00:01:46.500> very<00:01:46.710> nice<00:01:47.180> external<00:01:48.180> top

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
it's a it's a very nice external top

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:55.219 
it's a it's a very nice external top
checker<00:01:48.600> I<00:01:49.490> have<00:01:50.720> so<00:01:51.720> two<00:01:52.170> sets<00:01:52.439> of<00:01:53.299> light<00:01:54.299> top

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
checker I have so two sets of light top

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.469 
checker I have so two sets of light top
power<00:01:55.470> strips<00:01:55.799> and<00:01:58.790> overall<00:01:59.790> I'm<00:01:59.969> starting<00:02:00.450> to

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
power strips and overall I'm starting to

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.859 
power strips and overall I'm starting to
feel<00:02:00.719> that<00:02:01.640> tank<00:02:02.640> is<00:02:02.759> a<00:02:02.820> little<00:02:03.119> bit<00:02:03.240> too

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
feel that tank is a little bit too

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.260 
feel that tank is a little bit too
cramped<00:02:04.259> so

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
cramped so

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:11.110 
cramped so
I<00:02:05.799> might<00:02:06.799> be<00:02:07.070> a<00:02:08.860> lessening<00:02:09.860> the<00:02:10.220> bio<00:02:10.429> load<00:02:10.700> on

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
I might be a lessening the bio load on

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:17.050 
I might be a lessening the bio load on
it<00:02:12.819> in<00:02:13.819> the<00:02:14.000> near<00:02:14.209> future<00:02:15.849> the<00:02:16.849> water

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
it in the near future the water

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:22.960 
it in the near future the water
parameters<00:02:17.540> are<00:02:18.019> fine<00:02:20.890> no<00:02:21.890> ammonia<00:02:22.459> it<00:02:22.700> is

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
parameters are fine no ammonia it is

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.979 
parameters are fine no ammonia it is
fully<00:02:23.330> cycled<00:02:23.900> by<00:02:24.379> now<00:02:24.910> you<00:02:25.910> can<00:02:25.940> see<00:02:26.209> that<00:02:26.239> in

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:26.989 
fully cycled by now you can see that in

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:31.690 
fully cycled by now you can see that in
this<00:02:27.739> place<00:02:28.129> here<00:02:28.549> I<00:02:28.730> had<00:02:29.269> to<00:02:29.560> rip<00:02:30.560> apart<00:02:30.709> most

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
this place here I had to rip apart most

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.640 
this place here I had to rip apart most
of<00:02:31.849> the<00:02:32.000> UG<00:02:32.599> and<00:02:33.940> replanted<00:02:34.940> because<00:02:35.629> it<00:02:36.500> was

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
of the UG and replanted because it was

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.280 
of the UG and replanted because it was
all<00:02:36.830> covered<00:02:37.160> with<00:02:37.310> algae<00:02:37.790> and<00:02:38.690> it<00:02:39.140> was

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
all covered with algae and it was

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.280 
all covered with algae and it was
starting<00:02:39.620> to<00:02:40.299> lift<00:02:41.299> off<00:02:41.540> as<00:02:41.690> well<00:02:41.840> because<00:02:42.170> the

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
starting to lift off as well because the

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:48.729 
starting to lift off as well because the
first<00:02:42.530> time<00:02:42.709> I<00:02:42.739> planted<00:02:43.160> it<00:02:43.310> was<00:02:43.810> too<00:02:47.620> was<00:02:48.620> it

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
first time I planted it was too was it

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:54.610 
first time I planted it was too was it
wasn't<00:02:49.040> too<00:02:49.130> deep<00:02:49.310> so<00:02:50.090> it's<00:02:50.239> too<00:02:50.390> shallow<00:02:53.620> over

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
wasn't too deep so it's too shallow over

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.559 
wasn't too deep so it's too shallow over
here<00:02:54.890> it's<00:02:55.069> quite<00:02:55.400> luscious<00:02:55.849> but<00:02:56.120> also<00:02:56.299> i'm

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:56.569 
here it's quite luscious but also i'm

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:01.089 
here it's quite luscious but also i'm
getting<00:02:56.930> different<00:02:57.890> type<00:02:58.190> of<00:02:58.220> algae<00:02:58.519> here<00:03:00.099> not

00:03:01.089 --> 00:03:01.099 
getting different type of algae here not

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:05.860 
getting different type of algae here not
sure<00:03:01.280> what's<00:03:01.579> going<00:03:01.730> on<00:03:04.510> so<00:03:05.510> these<00:03:05.660> are<00:03:05.840> the

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
sure what's going on so these are the

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:14.879 
sure what's going on so these are the
dragon<00:03:06.620> rocks<00:03:07.840> check<00:03:08.840> rate<00:03:09.049> and<00:03:12.280> finally<00:03:13.280> i

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:14.889 
dragon rocks check rate and finally i

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:17.979 
dragon rocks check rate and finally i
would<00:03:15.889> say<00:03:16.190> that<00:03:16.220> you<00:03:16.670> can<00:03:17.269> see<00:03:17.420> the<00:03:17.569> algae

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:17.989 
would say that you can see the algae

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:20.440 
would say that you can see the algae
eaters<00:03:18.230> right<00:03:18.680> here<00:03:19.030> fortunately<00:03:20.030> they<00:03:20.239> don't

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
eaters right here fortunately they don't

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.819 
eaters right here fortunately they don't
seem<00:03:20.660> to<00:03:21.970> be<00:03:22.970> eating<00:03:23.209> too<00:03:23.780> much<00:03:23.930> of<00:03:24.139> the<00:03:24.290> LG<00:03:24.620> yet

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:24.829 
seem to be eating too much of the LG yet

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:28.920 
seem to be eating too much of the LG yet
