00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 Hello dear friends with you 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:07.230
 gameplay then a special review on the game 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.269
 gravity what is this playing the game is done 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.059
 based on the movie which is very soon 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.639
 come out on big screens and sit down and byte 6 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.470
 October in this film starred Sandra 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.779
 bullock and george clooney 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.240
 so here there are two modes here 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.310
 multiplayer games are not yet available 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.619
 will be available in the next update 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.140
 As I understand it while there is a single game 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.510
 which consists of three missions which 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.910
 very different from each other 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.489
 so I propose to look at them all 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.730
 let's start with the first one 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:41.730
 called save and return to mission 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:45.239
 here are made according to the film and imitates 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.010
 some scenes that happen during 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.750
 movie time if you download now 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.230
 play then you will watch this 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.980
 the film then you learn all these scenes here 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.899
 here they had some kind of accident and 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:00.300
 one of the characters so now unwound 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.730
 now throw it into space and we need 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:06.030
 help him get rid of the straps 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.340
 which he tied what we need 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.060
 do we need to touch these here 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.240
 here are the circles 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.790
 until the time in these circles is over 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.280
 that is, this one is a white scale 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.890
 don't have time to reach the end otherwise you 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.530
 fly away into outer space and unfortunately 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.020
 perish in general sense the first mission 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:28.140
 is this offering to return 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.180
 back and look at mission 2 second 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.460
 the mission seemed to me probably the most 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.400
 interesting and probably we 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.380
 let's see a little bit more in this 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.680
 mission we have in the role of astronaut 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.119
 more accurately astronaut fix everything 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.790
 international space station 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.820
 let's skip the introductory video and 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.560
 Immediately proceed to the game 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.360
 management here is quite specific and 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.509
 you need to get used to it 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.670
 joystick with which we can 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:59.579
 rotate there is a button which 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.770
 allows us to fly up or forward 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.990
 more precisely forward just acceleration is 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.899
 stabilization button which you 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.300
 stabilizes and stops here on 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.430
 this position we need to fly to 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.260
 green arrow let's try to 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.030
 go ahead 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:19.190
 so stabilize so bend down 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:21.769
 choose the right direction over there to us 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:24.110
 need to fly stabilize again i 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:26.750
 before taking a review very long to 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:29.840
 this mission was also trained we need 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.849
 monitor the level of oxygen so that it does not 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.819
 ended if he ends with us 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:37.940
 will need to have time to fly to 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:40.670
 purple point and at this point we 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:45.079
 be able to refuel with oxygen for 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:47.690
 order to replenish his stocks and we 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:49.610
 were able to fly farther here we are now 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:53.150
 field of view so we can like this 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:56.349
 click on the broken part and after that 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:58.609
 how does she completely say fill 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:01.940
 It seems to us a movie in which we 

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:02.870
 repairing one of our parts here 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.000
 this one 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:08.120
 more precisely our international space 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.489
 Station game is made quite beautiful 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:13.549
 the land looks especially beautiful 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:15.530
 which opens and here if to be honest 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:18.349
 hunt now even be yourself in 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:20.959
 open space but honestly like this 

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:22.910
 I would not want to fly free there 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:25.340
 because it's probably very scary 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:27.440
 because you never know where 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:31.609
 do you know what can you have 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:34.819
 break down here is the meaning of 2 games is 

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:38.180
 By the way, the third part will be 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:41.690
 detached to be somewhat far away 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:44.720
 from you and you will have it for more 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:47.000
 fly it is quite difficult to fly 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:51.260
 and catch the details here then deliver it 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:53.239
 again on the ISS this is what we attach in general 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.879
 probably on the second mission I will complete 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:57.829
 now and we will move on to the third mission 

00:03:55.879 --> 00:04:00.200
 look at it because now 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:02.660
 far enough we have to fly and 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:06.169
 spend a lot of time i think if 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:09.049
 you will like the game then yourself 

00:04:06.169 --> 00:04:11.359
 download and play all these missions 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:15.169
 so the third mission is called union 

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:17.810
 control us with the help of the shuttle union 

00:04:15.169 --> 00:04:20.600
 will need to perform some 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:23.360
 operations specifically it 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:25.790
 fly to a certain point and so 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:31.340
 we have almost the same management 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:32.090
 joystick three of them here such here to us 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:34.520
 is necessary 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:37.220
 turn around let's stabilize 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:39.920
 I will try to turn around and we can not him 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:42.470
 what to bump if we bump our 

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:44.840
 the mission will fail it enough 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:48.020
 difficult will require a lot of your strength 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:51.050
 skill and nerves here is such a toy 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:53.210
 according to the film probably the film will also be 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:55.580
 incredibly beautiful interesting because 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:58.880
 that here are these cosmic earth species 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:01.730
 just fascinating and probably worth it 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:02.420
 watch this movie only thanks 

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:05.530
 by this 

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:08.480
 view that will be here 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:10.550
 difficult enough to repeat but 

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:13.040
 quite interesting and original 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:16.100
 so who liked this game 

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:18.560
 Download who generally Sandra fans 

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:21.200
 bullock and george clooney too swing 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:24.610
 because you are supposedly playing for 

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:24.610
 one of these characters
