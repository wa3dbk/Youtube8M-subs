00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:21.759 
yeah it's made up of expanded

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:25.319 
yeah it's made up of expanded
polyethylene<00:01:22.390> foam<00:01:22.920> now<00:01:23.920> these<00:01:24.880> guys<00:01:25.090> are

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:25.329 
polyethylene foam now these guys are

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:27.690 
polyethylene foam now these guys are
great<00:01:25.479> because<00:01:25.659> they<00:01:26.380> understand<00:01:26.860> how

product so these guys care for the
environment<00:01:45.670> as<00:01:45.759> well<00:01:45.790> so<00:01:46.659> now<00:01:47.590> this<00:01:48.579> is<00:01:48.850> quite

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
environment as well so now this is quite

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.510 
environment as well so now this is quite
quite<00:01:49.719> special<00:01:50.200> because<00:01:50.229> what<00:01:50.740> it<00:01:50.860> also<00:01:51.040> gives

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
quite special because what it also gives

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.090 
quite special because what it also gives

foam with micro bubbles if you like it

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.170 
foam with micro bubbles if you like it
gives<00:02:11.860> you

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180

fantastic<00:02:12.870> acoustic<00:02:13.379> value<00:02:13.680> as<00:02:13.799> well<00:02:14.040> now

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:14.579 
fantastic acoustic value as well now

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:16.849 
fantastic acoustic value as well now
it's<00:02:14.819> standalone<00:02:15.450> acoustic<00:02:16.349> values<00:02:16.650> are

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:16.859 
it's standalone acoustic values are

00:02:16.859 --> 00:02:21.880 
it's standalone acoustic values are
about<00:02:17.340> some<00:02:17.930> as<00:02:19.069> STC<00:02:20.069> 12<00:02:20.430> about<00:02:20.879> 12<00:02:21.180> decibels

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
about some as STC 12 about 12 decibels

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.679 
about some as STC 12 about 12 decibels
which<00:02:22.890> is<00:02:23.010> fantastic<00:02:23.280> so<00:02:24.269> if<00:02:24.390> you're<00:02:24.540> in<00:02:24.629> a

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
situation whether you're near a noisy

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.220 
situation whether you're near a noisy
road<00:02:28.140> it's<00:02:28.739> surprising<00:02:29.370> how<00:02:29.549> much<00:02:29.959> the<00:02:30.959> sound

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
road it's surprising how much the sound

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.440 
road it's surprising how much the sound
will<00:02:31.439> be<00:02:31.530> reduced<00:02:31.920> by<00:02:32.129> putting<00:02:32.400> this<00:02:32.519> in<00:02:32.760> now

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
will be reduced by putting this in now

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.929 
will be reduced by putting this in now
you<00:02:33.510> can<00:02:33.870> use<00:02:34.019> it<00:02:34.170> with<00:02:34.260> other<00:02:34.409> products<00:02:34.939> if

00:02:35.929 --> 00:02:35.939 
you can use it with other products if

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:38.000 
you can use it with other products if
you<00:02:36.000> want<00:02:36.269> to<00:02:36.359> increase<00:02:37.139> the<00:02:37.200> the<00:02:37.709> wintertime

you want to increase the the wintertime
day<00:02:38.400> you<00:02:38.459> can<00:02:38.730> put<00:02:38.879> a<00:02:38.909> bad<00:02:39.090> head<00:02:39.269> and<00:02:39.389> put<00:02:39.510> this

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
day you can put a bad head and put this

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:41.809 
day you can put a bad head and put this
over<00:02:39.780> the<00:02:39.930> top<00:02:40.109> or<00:02:40.620> you<00:02:40.680> can<00:02:40.829> use<00:02:40.980> this<00:02:41.129> just<00:02:41.670> by

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
over the top or you can use this just by

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:44.030 
over the top or you can use this just by
itself<00:02:42.120> but<00:02:42.389> for<00:02:43.290> anything<00:02:43.500> like<00:02:43.799> that<00:02:43.829> i

recommend<00:02:44.669> is<00:02:44.760> probably<00:02:45.000> now<00:02:45.209> that<00:02:45.419> really

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
recommend is probably now that really

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.890 
recommend is probably now that really
clever<00:02:46.049> thing<00:02:46.379> that<00:02:46.560> that<00:02:47.099> they<00:02:48.060> do<00:02:48.120> with<00:02:48.599> beef

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
clever thing that that they do with beef

burn<00:02:49.169> is<00:02:49.650> that<00:02:49.919> an<00:02:50.040> overlap<00:02:50.459> flap<00:02:50.840> what<00:02:51.840> that

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
burn is that an overlap flap what that

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:53.899 
burn is that an overlap flap what that
means<00:02:52.260> is<00:02:52.439> not<00:02:52.889> when<00:02:53.159> normally<00:02:53.579> when<00:02:53.760> you're

putting<00:02:54.120> reflective<00:02:54.930> insulation<00:02:55.079> in<00:02:55.590> you

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
putting reflective insulation in you

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.440 
putting reflective insulation in you
have<00:02:55.769> to<00:02:55.829> overlap<00:02:56.250> the<00:02:56.430> product<00:02:56.819> and<00:02:56.969> then

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
have to overlap the product and then

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.599 
have to overlap the product and then
tape<00:02:57.719> it<00:02:57.870> off<00:02:57.989> what<00:02:58.739> they've<00:02:58.950> done<00:02:59.189> that<00:02:59.370> very

00:02:59.599 --> 00:02:59.609 
tape it off what they've done that very

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:01.069 
tape it off what they've done that very
cleverly<00:02:59.939> put<00:03:00.120> this<00:03:00.269> little<00:03:00.480> extra<00:03:00.719> overlap

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:01.079 
cleverly put this little extra overlap

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:03.470 
cleverly put this little extra overlap
flap<00:03:01.469> on<00:03:01.650> so<00:03:01.889> the<00:03:01.980> product<00:03:02.340> can<00:03:02.549> but<00:03:02.819> join<00:03:03.120> and

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
flap on so the product can but join and

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.780 
flap on so the product can but join and
then<00:03:04.349> I<00:03:04.560> will<00:03:04.739> add<00:03:04.829> flap<00:03:05.099> like<00:03:05.250> that<00:03:05.459> say<00:03:05.639> not

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
then I will add flap like that say not

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.420 
then I will add flap like that say not
wasting<00:03:06.209> product<00:03:06.480> so<00:03:07.469> if<00:03:07.650> not<00:03:07.829> only<00:03:08.129> is<00:03:08.219> it<00:03:08.250> a

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
wasting product so if not only is it a

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.089 
wasting product so if not only is it a
substantial<00:03:09.389> Australian<00:03:09.989> made<00:03:10.139> product<00:03:10.560> it's

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:11.099 
substantial Australian made product it's

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:14.419 
substantial Australian made product it's
economical<00:03:11.790> to<00:03:11.909> use<00:03:11.939> as<00:03:12.239> well
