00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
is because uh we thought we'd do it

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.470 
is because uh we thought we'd do it

in canada I'm in England yeah yeah but
it<00:03:54.269> wasn't<00:03:54.450> even<00:03:54.600> that<00:03:54.750> bad<00:03:54.870> it<00:03:55.140> doesn't<00:03:55.200> look

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
it wasn't even that bad it doesn't look

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.110 
it wasn't even that bad it doesn't look
bad<00:03:55.470> on<00:03:55.650> video<00:03:56.130> like<00:03:56.370> I<00:03:56.459> was<00:03:56.579> extent<00:03:56.880> I<00:03:57.000> was

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
bad on video like I was extent I was

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.580 
bad on video like I was extent I was
assuming<00:03:57.329> they<00:03:57.510> look<00:03:57.720> like<00:03:57.840> pretty<00:03:58.200> leggy

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
assuming they look like pretty leggy

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.949

yeah but it can't really tell unless you
play<00:04:01.230> it<00:04:01.290> like<00:04:01.560> everything<00:04:01.890> is<00:04:01.980> delayed<00:04:02.280> but

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
play it like everything is delayed but

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:04.250 
play it like everything is delayed but
net<00:04:02.760> and<00:04:02.940> doesn't<00:04:03.120> look<00:04:03.209> too<00:04:03.299> bad<00:04:03.329> I<00:04:03.690> think<00:04:04.170> it

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260
