of course we've already lubricated same

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.840 
of course we've already lubricated same
principle<00:02:01.770> as<00:02:02.670> before<00:02:03.570> you<00:02:03.960> assemble<00:02:04.730> Part<00:02:05.730> A

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
principle as before you assemble Part A

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.640 
principle as before you assemble Part A
Part<00:02:06.150> B<00:02:08.300> take<00:02:09.300> a<00:02:09.330> little<00:02:09.510> bit<00:02:09.630> of<00:02:09.690> clay<00:02:10.050> stick

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:10.650 
Part B take a little bit of clay stick

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:13.100 
Part B take a little bit of clay stick
it<00:02:10.800> in<00:02:11.060> kind<00:02:12.060> of<00:02:12.210> extrude<00:02:12.600> it<00:02:12.660> between<00:02:12.960> your

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
it in kind of extrude it between your

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.340 
it in kind of extrude it between your
two<00:02:13.260> fingers<00:02:13.530> and<00:02:14.480> we're<00:02:15.480> going<00:02:15.720> to<00:02:15.810> assemble

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
two fingers and we're going to assemble

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:22.340 
two fingers and we're going to assemble
it<00:02:17.390> onto<00:02:18.390> the<00:02:18.420> lower<00:02:18.630> layer<00:02:20.960> push<00:02:21.960> into<00:02:22.170> a

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
it onto the lower layer push into a

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:27.210 
it onto the lower layer push into a
little<00:02:22.530> bit<00:02:22.740> more

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.370 

and<00:02:27.850> our<00:02:28.540> next<00:02:28.600> layer<00:02:28.990> on<00:02:29.260> top<00:02:30.930> next<00:02:31.930> layer<00:02:32.200> on

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
and our next layer on top next layer on

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.780 
and our next layer on top next layer on
top<00:02:32.410> of<00:02:32.770> that<00:02:32.860> one<00:02:35.190> this<00:02:36.190> one<00:02:36.430> we're<00:02:36.580> going<00:02:36.700> to

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
top of that one this one we're going to

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:44.780 
top of that one this one we're going to
stick<00:02:37.120> in<00:02:37.270> and<00:02:37.420> screw<00:02:38.290> into<00:02:38.440> it<00:02:38.710> straight

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:52.690 

using<00:02:45.510> a<00:02:45.599> coin<00:02:46.849> open<00:02:47.849> the<00:02:47.969> sub

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.000 

okay<00:02:53.480> so<00:02:53.959> now<00:02:54.200> we're<00:02:54.349> pretty<00:02:54.440> much<00:02:54.560> ready<00:02:54.680> for

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
okay so now we're pretty much ready for

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:56.530 
okay so now we're pretty much ready for
the<00:02:55.069> hot<00:02:55.250> plate<00:02:55.459> then<00:02:55.910> been<00:02:56.060> driving<00:02:56.390> for

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
the hot plate then been driving for

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.150 
the hot plate then been driving for
about<00:02:56.629> 20<00:02:56.989> minutes<00:02:57.140> on<00:02:57.349> the<00:02:57.440> hot<00:02:57.620> plate<00:02:57.650> we're

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
about 20 minutes on the hot plate we're

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.650 
about 20 minutes on the hot plate we're
going<00:02:58.310> to<00:02:59.050> crack<00:03:00.050> them<00:03:00.260> open<00:03:00.410> and<00:03:01.300> it's<00:03:02.300> not

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
going to crack them open and it's not

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.880 
going to crack them open and it's not
even<00:03:02.720> opened<00:03:05.019> this<00:03:06.019> one's<00:03:06.319> ready<00:03:06.500> to<00:03:06.650> go<00:03:06.739> back

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
onto the hot plate opening this one

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:19.030 
onto the hot plate opening this one
delicate<00:03:14.260> this<00:03:15.260> is<00:03:15.470> a<00:03:15.500> threaded<00:03:15.980> piece<00:03:18.040> and

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
delicate this is a threaded piece and

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.180 
delicate this is a threaded piece and
we're<00:03:19.400> going<00:03:19.640> to<00:03:19.730> also<00:03:20.660> just<00:03:21.470> delicately

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:24.709 
remove this go back on the hot plate

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:27.400 
remove this go back on the hot plate
okay<00:03:25.549> silly<00:03:26.090> letter<00:03:26.330> pieces<00:03:26.750> dry<00:03:26.989> here<00:03:27.200> for

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
okay silly letter pieces dry here for

okay silly letter pieces dry here for
taking<00:03:27.709> office<00:03:27.950> on<00:03:28.310> github<00:03:28.549> wings<00:03:28.970> here<00:03:29.299> that

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
taking office on github wings here that

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.050 
taking office on github wings here that
they'll<00:03:29.690> just<00:03:29.870> follow<00:03:30.080> at<00:03:30.380> all<00:03:30.730> you<00:03:31.730> can<00:03:31.880> take

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
they'll just follow at all you can take

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.630 
they'll just follow at all you can take
a<00:03:32.090> toothpick<00:03:32.480> and<00:03:32.690> just<00:03:33.280> clean<00:03:34.280> off<00:03:34.400> the

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640 
a toothpick and just clean off the

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:40.630 
a toothpick and just clean off the
little<00:03:35.410> edges<00:03:36.410> here<00:03:38.410> okay<00:03:39.410> so<00:03:39.470> once<00:03:40.459> your

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 
little edges here okay so once your

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.339 
little edges here okay so once your
pieces<00:03:40.790> are<00:03:41.060> dry<00:03:41.239> you<00:03:41.299> have<00:03:41.630> to<00:03:41.810> basically

00:03:42.339 --> 00:03:42.349 
pieces are dry you have to basically

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:44.949 
pieces are dry you have to basically
make<00:03:42.799> them<00:03:42.980> together<00:03:43.310> to<00:03:43.700> do<00:03:43.849> that<00:03:44.060> you're

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 
make them together to do that you're

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:47.470 
make them together to do that you're
going<00:03:45.170> to<00:03:45.290> screw<00:03:46.099> them<00:03:46.310> in<00:03:46.430> slowly<00:03:46.760> but<00:03:47.030> surely

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
going to screw them in slowly but surely

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.620 
going to screw them in slowly but surely
each<00:03:48.410> time<00:03:48.739> you<00:03:49.250> know<00:03:49.910> you<00:03:49.970> find<00:03:50.269> resistance

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:50.630 
each time you know you find resistance

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:52.479 
each time you know you find resistance
you<00:03:50.959> work<00:03:51.170> a<00:03:51.319> little<00:03:51.500> bit<00:03:51.709> you<00:03:51.950> blow<00:03:52.130> out<00:03:52.310> the

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:52.489 
you work a little bit you blow out the

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:58.229 
you work a little bit you blow out the
dust<00:03:52.730> and<00:03:54.310> you<00:03:55.310> work<00:03:55.519> it<00:03:55.670> till<00:03:55.880> your<00:03:56.620> threads

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239 
dust and you work it till your threads

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:00.490 
dust and you work it till your threads
are<00:03:59.239> all<00:03:59.450> made<00:03:59.630> it<00:03:59.780> together<00:04:00.109> and<00:04:00.230> then<00:04:00.290> after

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
are all made it together and then after

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:07.840 
are all made it together and then after
firing<00:04:04.060> it'll<00:04:05.060> all<00:04:05.120> fit<00:04:05.299> together<00:04:05.450> correctly
