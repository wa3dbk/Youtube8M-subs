00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.540
 here for our freedom deny your 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.310
 adult feelings 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:00.130
 they have to move around 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.619
 three children good until I get sick of my 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:05.290
 wrong before the school did not attend only from 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:08.310
 TV if nothing to do if someone comes to 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:14.260
 see you just have to do it simply 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:16.120
 It's my fault I do not know if I act like a fool 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.099
 what I want something I do think is 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.380
 funny do not have to explain that 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:22.450
 imagination we have putting it into action 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.610
 and digging we will achieve it because the child 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.920
 will have a thousand weddings to dream of in a 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.620
 dentist girl man something police or 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.660

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.290
 underwater castles and let's put 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:37.760
 crystalline and with laser artifacts 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:40.700
 rescue from the sailors 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.860
 the martial mirandese hit and skate 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.079
 with troglodytes that do not import the 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.090
 future and teaching with super weapons and 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:49.069
 robberies because you know achieved enough is enough 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.260
 with his half trap that I can not do and 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:53.650
 I imagine that the strongest I can 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.650
 I am 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:59.140
 if we can enjoy these things 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:03.820
 while all and that is because I have not 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:05.890
 let you try again if 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:08.200
 we come back enjoy those children and the 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.940
 shoots still the time is due 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.590
 to take advantage of 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.270
 what they are doing those two midgets 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.780
 They are pretending to be young and good vibes 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:16.780

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.579
 Y 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.760
 If my voice becomes more key it will be 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:35.950
 afterlife 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:41.200
 I do not know children is not convenient 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:45.340
 nobody wants to be a child forever 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.340
 I remember moment 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:50.820
 the pain 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:58.610
 although it's fine 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:04:01.630
 the new station and then why 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:01.630
 field 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:07.240

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.209
 more than two degrees 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:23.640
 Hey, what's happening to me younger than before? 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.100

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:28.220
 people who never get old 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:31.420
 we will be speeches 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:31.420
