00:03:26.589 --> 00:03:26.599 
matched I guess brown color gamer people

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:29.020 
matched I guess brown color gamer people
just<00:03:26.780> really<00:03:27.200> dominated<00:03:27.860> so<00:03:28.400> you're<00:03:28.670> on<00:03:28.819> that

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
just really dominated so you're on that

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:31.330 
just really dominated so you're on that
and<00:03:29.840> I<00:03:29.930> think<00:03:29.959> on<00:03:30.319> paper<00:03:30.560> this<00:03:30.799> is<00:03:30.860> actually

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
and I think on paper this is actually

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.009 
and I think on paper this is actually
considered<00:03:31.549> but<00:03:32.060> i<00:03:32.090> managed<00:03:32.420> to<00:03:32.450> honda<00:03:32.870> but

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:33.019 
considered but i managed to honda but

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:35.289 
considered but i managed to honda but
favorably<00:03:33.560> with<00:03:33.590> a<00:03:33.799> play<00:03:34.010> read<00:03:34.370> they're<00:03:34.610> going

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:35.299 
favorably with a play read they're going

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:38.800 
favorably with a play read they're going
into<00:03:35.540> uppercut<00:03:35.930> committee<00:03:37.480> gotta<00:03:38.480> get

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
into uppercut committee gotta get

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:44.600 
into uppercut committee gotta get
anything<00:03:39.489> juggling

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:52.370 

so<00:03:45.610> it's<00:03:45.760> going<00:03:45.910> to<00:03:46.000> be<00:03:46.090> one<00:03:46.300> game<00:03:46.510> apiece<00:03:48.240> and

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.070 

hopefully<00:03:53.380> that<00:03:53.590> will<00:03:54.040> not<00:03:54.400> be<00:03:54.430> Mike<00:03:54.730> Ross's

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080 
hopefully that will not be Mike Ross's

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.210 
hopefully that will not be Mike Ross's
