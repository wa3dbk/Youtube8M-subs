Warhammer<00:00:25.350> but<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.220> problem<00:00:26.580> is<00:00:26.699> that<00:00:26.730> I

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
Warhammer but the problem is that I

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.640 
Warhammer but the problem is that I
don't<00:00:27.060> play<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.630> game<00:00:27.660> because<00:00:28.140> it<00:00:28.260> was<00:00:28.380> too

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
don't play the game because it was too

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.240 
don't play the game because it was too
difficult<00:00:29.090> and<00:00:30.260> the<00:00:31.260> thing<00:00:31.439> that<00:00:31.500> attached<00:00:31.980> me

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
difficult and the thing that attached me

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.459 
difficult and the thing that attached me
to<00:00:32.279> mage<00:00:32.940> nights<00:00:33.329> when<00:00:33.719> it<00:00:33.840> first<00:00:34.050> came<00:00:34.290> out

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
to mage nights when it first came out

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.740 
to mage nights when it first came out
was<00:00:34.649> because<00:00:35.030> pretty<00:00:36.030> much<00:00:36.120> it<00:00:36.360> was<00:00:36.450> just

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
was because pretty much it was just

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.780 
was because pretty much it was just
really<00:00:37.050> simple<00:00:37.620> it's<00:00:37.680> a<00:00:37.800> real<00:00:38.100> simple<00:00:38.399> game

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
really simple it's a real simple game

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.479 
really simple it's a real simple game
but<00:00:39.660> unfortunately<00:00:40.410> I<00:00:40.620> think<00:00:40.950> because<00:00:41.190> they

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
but unfortunately I think because they

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:42.860 
but unfortunately I think because they
were<00:00:41.579> trying<00:00:41.760> to<00:00:41.910> milk<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.360> french<00:00:42.629> fries

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
were trying to milk the french fries

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.709 
were trying to milk the french fries
they<00:00:43.110> kind<00:00:43.379> of<00:00:43.469> killed<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.100> game<00:00:44.430> in<00:00:44.730> four

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
they kind of killed the game in four

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.860 
they kind of killed the game in four
years<00:00:45.899> I<00:00:46.140> think<00:00:46.200> it<00:00:46.440> died<00:00:46.649> in<00:00:46.820> 2004<00:00:47.820> and<00:00:48.030> at

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
years I think it died in 2004 and at

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.889 
years I think it died in 2004 and at
last<00:00:49.050> booster<00:00:49.829> they<00:00:50.070> had<00:00:50.340> was<00:00:50.640> nexus<00:00:51.629> mage

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
last booster they had was nexus mage
