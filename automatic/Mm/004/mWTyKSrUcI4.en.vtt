00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:40.850 
being involved in some part of the video
game<00:02:39.870> you<00:02:40.050> know<00:02:40.140> just<00:02:40.290> kind<00:02:40.470> of<00:02:40.500> bringing<00:02:40.710> a

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
game you know just kind of bringing a

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:41.990 
game you know just kind of bringing a
part<00:02:41.100> of<00:02:41.160> it<00:02:41.280> to<00:02:41.400> life<00:02:41.610> from<00:02:41.880> a<00:02:41.970> different

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
part of it to life from a different

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.490 
part of it to life from a different
perspective<00:02:42.390> from<00:02:42.930> a<00:02:43.020> music<00:02:43.320> video

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
perspective from a music video

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.490 
perspective from a music video
perspective<00:02:44.360> so<00:02:45.360> the<00:02:45.720> fact<00:02:45.960> that<00:02:46.020> it<00:02:46.170> sort<00:02:46.380> of

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
perspective so the fact that it sort of

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.500 
perspective so the fact that it sort of
sits<00:02:47.280> well<00:02:47.490> with<00:02:47.520> the<00:02:47.820> game<00:02:48.000> and<00:02:48.240> sort<00:02:48.420> of

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
sits well with the game and sort of

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:49.790 
sits well with the game and sort of
reflects<00:02:48.870> it<00:02:49.050> a<00:02:49.080> little<00:02:49.200> bit<00:02:49.410> it's<00:02:49.560> kind<00:02:49.770> of

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
reflects it a little bit it's kind of

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.130 
reflects it a little bit it's kind of
exciting
