technique that I used here on the fur
the<00:01:24.080> the<00:01:24.380> layering<00:01:24.619> technique<00:01:25.460> or<00:01:25.760> a<00:01:25.820> dry

the the layering technique or a dry
brushing<00:01:26.780> technique<00:01:27.259> then<00:01:28.159> they<00:01:28.430> are<00:01:28.490> good<00:01:28.820> if

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
brushing technique then they are good if

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.160 
brushing technique then they are good if
you<00:01:29.689> are<00:01:30.200> a<00:01:30.259> dry<00:01:31.100> brush<00:01:31.369> or<00:01:32.270> a<00:01:32.299> layer<00:01:32.689> and

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
you are a dry brush or a layer and

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.820 
you are a dry brush or a layer and
that's<00:01:33.500> how<00:01:33.710> you<00:01:33.880> get<00:01:34.880> most<00:01:35.600> of<00:01:35.780> your<00:01:35.840> stuff

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:36.830 
that's how you get most of your stuff

that's how you get most of your stuff
done<00:01:37.159> you<00:01:37.640> know<00:01:38.830> they're<00:01:39.830> not<00:01:40.009> the<00:01:40.159> paints<00:01:40.460> for

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
done you know they're not the paints for

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.230 
done you know they're not the paints for
you<00:01:40.790> the<00:01:41.150> pigment<00:01:41.600> is<00:01:41.780> such<00:01:42.259> that<00:01:43.060> they<00:01:44.060> just

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
you the pigment is such that they just

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.760 
you the pigment is such that they just
do<00:01:44.600> not<00:01:44.750> do<00:01:45.140> well<00:01:45.500> at<00:01:45.799> all<00:01:46.400> with<00:01:47.259> dry<00:01:48.259> brushing

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
do not do well at all with dry brushing

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:50.350 
do not do well at all with dry brushing
and<00:01:48.979> and<00:01:49.640> layering

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
and and layering

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.890 
and and layering
they<00:01:51.340> are<00:01:52.340> fantastic<00:01:52.670> for<00:01:53.270> what<00:01:53.720> I'm<00:01:53.869> doing

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:53.900 
they are fantastic for what I'm doing

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.380 
they are fantastic for what I'm doing
right<00:01:54.710> here<00:01:54.770> but<00:01:55.430> other<00:01:55.759> than<00:01:56.030> that<00:01:56.090> they

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
right here but other than that they

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.300 
right here but other than that they
they're<00:01:59.390> they're<00:01:59.689> just<00:01:59.720> not<00:02:00.020> for<00:02:00.310> that

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
they're they're just not for that

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.120 
they're they're just not for that
technique<00:02:02.590> there's<00:02:03.590> something<00:02:03.829> about<00:02:03.950> the

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
technique there's something about the

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.620 
technique there's something about the
pigment<00:02:04.579> pigment<00:02:04.850> it<00:02:07.060> the<00:02:08.060> only<00:02:08.209> thing<00:02:08.299> I<00:02:08.479> can

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
pigment pigment it the only thing I can

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.530 
pigment pigment it the only thing I can
think<00:02:08.660> of<00:02:08.989> to<00:02:09.350> say<00:02:09.560> is<00:02:09.739> that<00:02:09.950> it's<00:02:10.220> like

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:10.540 
think of to say is that it's like

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:17.050 
think of to say is that it's like
streaky<00:02:11.540> and<00:02:11.870> too<00:02:14.020> smooth<00:02:15.020> for<00:02:15.500> that<00:02:16.460> it's<00:02:16.850> too

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
streaky and too smooth for that it's too

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.950 
streaky and too smooth for that it's too
smooth<00:02:17.450> of<00:02:17.600> a<00:02:17.660> pain<00:02:17.930> it<00:02:18.200> really<00:02:18.590> is

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:20.960 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.430 

it's<00:02:21.500> implied<00:02:22.010> and<00:02:22.280> then<00:02:22.400> in<00:02:22.640> the<00:02:22.760> name<00:02:22.940> it<00:02:23.270> is

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
it's implied and then in the name it is

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.030 
it's implied and then in the name it is
for<00:02:25.030> pro<00:02:26.030> painters<00:02:26.270> it's<00:02:26.660> not<00:02:26.840> for<00:02:27.170> beginner

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
for pro painters it's not for beginner

dry brush or people but as you can see
what<00:02:34.280> I'm<00:02:34.370> doing<00:02:34.790> is<00:02:35.110> just<00:02:36.820> as<00:02:39.190> correct<00:02:40.190> you

it<00:02:43.040> is<00:02:43.340> just<00:02:43.700> as<00:02:44.000> easy<00:02:44.420> as<00:02:45.140> dry<00:02:45.890> brushing<00:02:46.490> it

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
it is just as easy as dry brushing it

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.680 
it is just as easy as dry brushing it
might<00:02:47.600> seem<00:02:48.080> more<00:02:48.830> time-consuming<00:02:49.480> but<00:02:50.480> dry

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
might seem more time-consuming but dry

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.770 
might seem more time-consuming but dry
brushing<00:02:51.110> gets<00:02:51.350> everywhere<00:02:51.860> and<00:02:52.660> you<00:02:53.660> know

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
brushing gets everywhere and you know

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.440 
brushing gets everywhere and you know
you<00:02:54.080> have<00:02:54.200> to<00:02:54.290> correct<00:02:54.590> it<00:02:54.800> a<00:02:54.920> lot<00:02:55.130> so<00:02:55.490> doing<00:02:56.360> it

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
you have to correct it a lot so doing it

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.290 
you have to correct it a lot so doing it
this<00:02:56.720> way<00:02:56.780> is<00:02:57.350> actually<00:02:58.250> takes<00:02:59.000> about<00:02:59.150> the

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.300 
this way is actually takes about the

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.720 
this way is actually takes about the
same<00:02:59.450> amount<00:02:59.660> of<00:03:00.020> time<00:03:00.260> you<00:03:01.130> know<00:03:01.250> because<00:03:01.640> you

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
same amount of time you know because you

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.420 
same amount of time you know because you
don't<00:03:01.910> have<00:03:02.090> so<00:03:02.450> much<00:03:02.690> of<00:03:03.080> the<00:03:03.890> touch-up

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
don't have so much of the touch-up

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.250 
don't have so much of the touch-up
here's<00:03:05.030> something<00:03:05.330> I<00:03:05.390> didn't<00:03:05.660> notice<00:03:06.050> before

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
here's something I didn't notice before

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.830 
here's something I didn't notice before
right<00:03:07.000> in<00:03:08.000> here

you can see it or not but if you are
following<00:03:51.770> along<00:03:52.750> this<00:03:53.750> is<00:03:53.960> definitely<00:03:54.530> a

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
following along this is definitely a

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.460 
following along this is definitely a
difference<00:03:58.400> another<00:03:59.150> thing<00:03:59.510> that<00:03:59.660> you<00:03:59.840> can<00:04:00.170> do

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 
difference another thing that you can do

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:04.450 
difference another thing that you can do
is<00:04:00.730> you<00:04:01.730> can<00:04:01.940> take<00:04:02.120> your<00:04:02.360> orchid<00:04:02.900> shade<00:04:03.460> color

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:04.460 
is you can take your orchid shade color

is you can take your orchid shade color
and<00:04:04.820> you<00:04:05.420> can<00:04:05.630> mix<00:04:05.960> it<00:04:07.090> probably<00:04:08.090> 50/50<00:04:09.050> with

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440 
and you can mix it probably 50/50 with

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.970 
and you can mix it probably 50/50 with
the

again<00:05:21.310> I<00:05:21.340> just<00:05:21.490> use<00:05:21.820> the<00:05:22.000> technique<00:05:22.419> where<00:05:22.660> I

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:22.690 
again I just use the technique where I

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:26.129 
again I just use the technique where I
poke<00:05:22.990> the<00:05:23.190> brush<00:05:24.190> into<00:05:24.550> the<00:05:24.729> water<00:05:25.060> and<00:05:25.419> then

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:26.139 
poke the brush into the water and then

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:28.590 
poke the brush into the water and then
stir<00:05:26.560> up<00:05:26.860> a<00:05:26.979> little<00:05:27.130> tiny<00:05:27.400> spot<00:05:27.820> within<00:05:28.150> the

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:28.600 
stir up a little tiny spot within the

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:35.340 
stir up a little tiny spot within the
cap<00:05:28.870> of<00:05:29.370> the<00:05:32.550> Games<00:05:33.550> Workshop<00:05:34.000> color<00:05:34.330> and<00:05:34.630> it

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:35.350 
cap of the Games Workshop color and it

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:38.310 
cap of the Games Workshop color and it
gives<00:05:35.560> me<00:05:35.680> a<00:05:35.770> smoother<00:05:36.450> thinner<00:05:37.450> paint<00:05:37.840> now

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:38.320 
gives me a smoother thinner paint now

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:41.670 
gives me a smoother thinner paint now
this<00:05:38.590> I<00:05:39.479> think<00:05:40.479> you<00:05:40.630> can<00:05:40.810> definitely<00:05:41.020> see<00:05:41.650> the

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:41.680 
this I think you can definitely see the

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:47.909 
this I think you can definitely see the
difference<00:05:42.400> here<00:05:43.150> in<00:05:43.810> this<00:05:44.289> paint<00:05:46.770> versus<00:05:47.770> the

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:47.919 
difference here in this paint versus the

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:51.570 
difference here in this paint versus the
other<00:05:48.130> one<00:05:48.370> okay

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:51.580 

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:54.320 

you<00:05:52.510> want<00:05:52.690> to<00:05:52.750> make<00:05:52.870> sure<00:05:53.080> that<00:05:53.410> on<00:05:53.590> muscles

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:54.330 
you want to make sure that on muscles

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:59.670 
you want to make sure that on muscles
like<00:05:55.330> this<00:05:55.600> that<00:05:55.930> your<00:05:56.910> edges<00:05:57.910> are<00:05:57.940> round<00:05:58.680> you

00:05:59.670 --> 00:05:59.680 
like this that your edges are round you

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:01.500 
like this that your edges are round you
know<00:05:59.830> so<00:06:00.130> like<00:06:00.280> you<00:06:00.490> see<00:06:00.700> me<00:06:00.730> going<00:06:01.120> like<00:06:01.150> this

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:01.510 
know so like you see me going like this

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:04.710 
know so like you see me going like this
okay<00:06:02.500> if<00:06:03.010> you're<00:06:03.820> going<00:06:03.910> to<00:06:04.030> leave<00:06:04.210> streaks

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:04.720 
okay if you're going to leave streaks

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:06.540 
okay if you're going to leave streaks
like<00:06:05.110> that<00:06:05.320> then<00:06:05.620> you<00:06:05.710> have<00:06:05.890> to<00:06:06.010> do<00:06:06.130> your<00:06:06.310> next

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:06.550 
like that then you have to do your next

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:07.980 
like that then you have to do your next
highlight<00:06:06.730> and<00:06:07.150> your<00:06:07.240> next<00:06:07.450> highlight<00:06:07.750> in<00:06:07.930> the

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:07.990 
highlight and your next highlight in the

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:09.840 
highlight and your next highlight in the
next<00:06:08.230> highlights<00:06:08.590> trim<00:06:09.070> streaks<00:06:09.430> like<00:06:09.550> that

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:09.850 
next highlights trim streaks like that

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:14.100 
next highlights trim streaks like that
or<00:06:10.060> it'll<00:06:10.240> just<00:06:10.270> look<00:06:10.630> funny<00:06:11.790> okay<00:06:12.790> so<00:06:12.850> you<00:06:13.110> you

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:14.110

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:16.290 
or it'll just look funny okay so you you
really<00:06:14.140> should<00:06:14.500> we're<00:06:15.280> doing<00:06:15.520> it<00:06:15.640> smooth<00:06:16.000> now

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:16.300 
really should we're doing it smooth now

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:18.130 
you can do it in streaks I've seen

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:22.830 
you can do it in streaks I've seen
particularly<00:06:19.060> Orcs<00:06:19.980> muscle<00:06:20.980> structure<00:06:21.840> done

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:28.000 
press stroke and it does look pretty

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.900

cool<00:06:28.480> especially<00:06:29.020> on<00:06:29.470> the<00:06:29.560> works<00:06:29.770> again<00:06:30.250> you

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:30.910 
cool especially on the works again you

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:32.490 
cool especially on the works again you
can't<00:06:31.180> go<00:06:31.330> wrong<00:06:31.540> it<00:06:31.720> just<00:06:31.780> gives<00:06:32.080> them<00:06:32.200> a<00:06:32.290> more

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:32.500 
can't go wrong it just gives them a more

you know just kind of stringy hard skin
look<00:06:46.290> but<00:06:47.290> that<00:06:47.530> is<00:06:47.920> more<00:06:48.850> advanced<00:06:49.420> than<00:06:49.750> what

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:50.020 
look but that is more advanced than what

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:55.300 
simply watered-down layers which is the

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:59.570 
simply watered-down layers which is the
beginning<00:06:55.480> of<00:06:56.110> becoming<00:06:56.650> a<00:06:57.010> really<00:06:57.790> good

beginning of becoming a really good
character<00:07:00.580> painter<00:07:01.210> and<00:07:01.680> these<00:07:02.680> techniques

character painter and these techniques

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:04.920 
character painter and these techniques
that<00:07:03.280> I'm<00:07:03.430> showing<00:07:03.730> you<00:07:04.000> with<00:07:04.180> the<00:07:04.210> water<00:07:04.600> down

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:04.930 
that I'm showing you with the water down

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:08.250 
that I'm showing you with the water down
several<00:07:05.740> layers<00:07:06.130> of<00:07:06.340> water<00:07:06.760> down<00:07:07.000> paint<00:07:07.840> one

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:08.260 
several layers of water down paint one

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:13.740 
several layers of water down paint one
higher<00:07:09.420> higher<00:07:10.420> and<00:07:11.550> one<00:07:12.550> lighter<00:07:12.880> than<00:07:13.540> the

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:13.750 
higher higher and one lighter than the

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:19.560 
higher higher and one lighter than the
next<00:07:14.640> is<00:07:15.640> is<00:07:17.190> something<00:07:18.190> that<00:07:18.460> a<00:07:18.820> lot<00:07:19.270> of<00:07:19.300> the

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:19.570 
next is is something that a lot of the

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:23.400 
next is is something that a lot of the
top<00:07:19.840> painters<00:07:20.410> still<00:07:21.070> use<00:07:21.540> so<00:07:22.540> it<00:07:23.200> is<00:07:23.380> a

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:23.410 
top painters still use so it is a

00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:26.930 
top painters still use so it is a
technique<00:07:24.040> that<00:07:24.240> you<00:07:25.240> know<00:07:25.500> you<00:07:26.500> can<00:07:26.710> learn

technique that you know you can learn

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:30.950 
technique that you know you can learn
relatively<00:07:27.940> quick<00:07:28.210> and<00:07:28.450> you<00:07:28.780> can<00:07:28.990> spend<00:07:29.320> years
