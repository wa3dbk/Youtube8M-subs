and<00:00:11.429> RL<00:00:11.759> Isis<00:00:12.210> on<00:00:12.330> handlebars<00:00:12.599> it's<00:00:13.349> a<00:00:13.500> new<00:00:13.650> bar

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
and RL Isis on handlebars it's a new bar

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.180 
and RL Isis on handlebars it's a new bar
for<00:00:13.889> is<00:00:14.280> this<00:00:14.460> year<00:00:15.170> kind<00:00:16.170> of<00:00:16.230> feeding<00:00:16.890> off<00:00:16.980> of

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
for is this year kind of feeding off of

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.210 
for is this year kind of feeding off of
the<00:00:17.310> the<00:00:17.699> development<00:00:18.330> of<00:00:18.720> the<00:00:18.990> domani<00:00:19.380> we

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
the the development of the domani we

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.160 
the the development of the domani we
kind<00:00:20.430> of<00:00:20.490> wanted<00:00:21.029> to<00:00:21.180> focus<00:00:21.359> on<00:00:21.630> what<00:00:21.900> we<00:00:22.020> can

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
kind of wanted to focus on what we can

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.550 
kind of wanted to focus on what we can
do<00:00:22.380> to<00:00:22.760> the<00:00:23.760> rider<00:00:24.000> comfort<00:00:24.390> on<00:00:24.779> the<00:00:25.170> handlebar

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
do to the rider comfort on the handlebar

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.200 
do to the rider comfort on the handlebar
so<00:00:25.920> we<00:00:26.039> looked<00:00:26.220> at<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.430> current<00:00:26.730> solutions

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
so we looked at the current solutions

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.570 
so we looked at the current solutions
and<00:00:27.449> it<00:00:27.840> was<00:00:27.960> a<00:00:28.019> lot<00:00:28.170> of<00:00:28.199> bar<00:00:28.680> tape<00:00:28.949> over<00:00:29.250> rap

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
and it was a lot of bar tape over rap

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.870 
and it was a lot of bar tape over rap
double<00:00:30.510> gel<00:00:30.720> stuff<00:00:31.080> and<00:00:31.949> it<00:00:32.040> was<00:00:32.130> all<00:00:32.309> bulky

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
double gel stuff and it was all bulky

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.850 
double gel stuff and it was all bulky
and<00:00:33.000> pretty<00:00:33.390> heavy<00:00:33.510> so<00:00:34.260> we<00:00:34.350> kind<00:00:34.500> of<00:00:34.559> focused

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
and pretty heavy so we kind of focused

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.250 
and pretty heavy so we kind of focused
on<00:00:34.920> how<00:00:35.130> do<00:00:35.190> we<00:00:35.280> reduce<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:36.210> weight<00:00:36.420> and<00:00:36.630> still

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
on how do we reduce the weight and still

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.680 
on how do we reduce the weight and still
retain<00:00:37.680> that<00:00:37.710> damping<00:00:38.370> characteristics<00:00:39.239> that

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
retain that damping characteristics that

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.170 
retain that damping characteristics that
that<00:00:40.230> gel<00:00:40.469> is<00:00:40.590> really<00:00:40.800> good<00:00:40.980> at<00:00:41.129> so<00:00:41.460> we

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
that gel is really good at so we

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.150 
that gel is really good at so we
immediately<00:00:42.690> went<00:00:43.110> to<00:00:43.260> well<00:00:43.680> what<00:00:44.010> if<00:00:44.100> we

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
immediately went to well what if we

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.479 
immediately went to well what if we
integrate<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.579> pad<00:00:44.789> so<00:00:45.239> we<00:00:45.809> focused<00:00:46.260> on

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:46.489 
integrate the pad so we focused on

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:50.150 
integrate the pad so we focused on
dropping<00:00:47.489> these<00:00:47.820> pads<00:00:48.180> down<00:00:49.110> into<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.770> to<00:00:50.129> the

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
dropping these pads down into the to the

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.569 
dropping these pads down into the to the
bar<00:00:50.430> a<00:00:50.460> bit<00:00:50.700> so<00:00:51.390> that<00:00:52.379> what<00:00:52.980> that<00:00:53.129> does<00:00:53.250> is<00:00:53.430> it

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
bar a bit so that what that does is it

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.569 
bar a bit so that what that does is it
reduces<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.539> overall<00:00:54.870> bulk<00:00:55.289> of<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.590> bar<00:00:55.800> so

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
reduces the overall bulk of the bar so

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.529 
reduces the overall bulk of the bar so
you<00:00:56.610> still<00:00:56.969> get<00:00:57.210> a<00:00:57.480> pre<00:00:58.079> standard<00:00:58.590> feeling<00:00:58.949> bar

00:00:59.529 --> 00:00:59.539 
you still get a pre standard feeling bar

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:01.819 
you still get a pre standard feeling bar
but<00:01:00.539> you<00:01:00.570> still<00:01:00.870> get<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.079> characteristics<00:01:01.739> of

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
but you still get the characteristics of

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.280 
but you still get the characteristics of
a<00:01:01.949> gel<00:01:02.190> pad<00:01:02.460> so<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.210> pad<00:01:03.420> is<00:01:03.600> actually<00:01:03.899> a<00:01:03.960> evie

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
a gel pad so the pad is actually a evie

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.100 
a gel pad so the pad is actually a evie
a<00:01:04.320> foam<00:01:04.970> we<00:01:05.970> did<00:01:06.090> a<00:01:06.119> lot<00:01:06.420> of<00:01:06.450> research<00:01:06.750> on

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
a foam we did a lot of research on

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.899 
a foam we did a lot of research on
figuring<00:01:07.409> out<00:01:07.590> what<00:01:07.920> density<00:01:08.430> that<00:01:08.580> needed<00:01:08.880> to

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
figuring out what density that needed to

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.230 
figuring out what density that needed to
be<00:01:09.030> to<00:01:09.840> you<00:01:10.799> know<00:01:10.890> reduce<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.670> vibrations

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
be to you know reduce the vibrations

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.480 
be to you know reduce the vibrations
that<00:01:12.299> a<00:01:12.390> rider's<00:01:12.689> gonna<00:01:12.900> feel<00:01:13.140> so<00:01:13.890> we<00:01:14.159> ended<00:01:14.369> up

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
that a rider's gonna feel so we ended up

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.399 
that a rider's gonna feel so we ended up
going<00:01:15.240> to<00:01:15.360> with<00:01:15.659> a<00:01:15.689> 55<00:01:16.229> to<00:01:16.409> 65<00:01:16.890> durometer<00:01:17.520> pad

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:18.409 
going to with a 55 to 65 durometer pad

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:21.020 
going to with a 55 to 65 durometer pad
this<00:01:19.409> is<00:01:19.470> going<00:01:19.740> to<00:01:19.799> reduce<00:01:19.920> your<00:01:20.340> vibrations

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
this is going to reduce your vibrations

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.380 
this is going to reduce your vibrations
by<00:01:21.210> about<00:01:21.659> 20%<00:01:22.400> which<00:01:23.400> is<00:01:23.430> equivalent<00:01:24.060> or

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
by about 20% which is equivalent or

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.149 
by about 20% which is equivalent or
better<00:01:24.780> than<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.170> current<00:01:25.439> gel<00:01:25.680> solutions

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
better than the current gel solutions

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.120 
better than the current gel solutions
and<00:01:26.400> you<00:01:26.939> still<00:01:27.210> retain<00:01:27.450> that<00:01:27.659> same<00:01:28.170> blade

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
and you still retain that same blade

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.789 
and you still retain that same blade
shape<00:01:29.460> bar<00:01:29.790> so<00:01:30.150> it's<00:01:30.299> not<00:01:30.450> big<00:01:30.720> and<00:01:30.869> bulky<00:01:30.930> it's

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
shape bar so it's not big and bulky it's

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.010 
shape bar so it's not big and bulky it's
a<00:01:31.860> standard<00:01:32.250> bar<00:01:32.460> shape<00:01:32.729> so<00:01:33.450> we<00:01:33.540> did<00:01:33.689> that<00:01:33.840> on

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
a standard bar shape so we did that on

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.859 
a standard bar shape so we did that on
the<00:01:34.049> our<00:01:34.259> XL<00:01:34.939> we<00:01:35.939> did<00:01:36.090> that<00:01:36.180> on<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.329> tops<00:01:36.630> and

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
the our XL we did that on the tops and

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.030 
the our XL we did that on the tops and
the<00:01:36.930> bottoms<00:01:37.460> on<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.640> our<00:01:38.820> L<00:01:39.090> version<00:01:39.890> we<00:01:40.890> did

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
the bottoms on the our L version we did

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.880 
the bottoms on the our L version we did
that<00:01:41.189> just<00:01:41.430> on<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.670> tops<00:01:42.229> so<00:01:43.229> another<00:01:43.649> really

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
that just on the tops so another really

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.370 
that just on the tops so another really
cool<00:01:44.130> feature<00:01:44.189> about<00:01:44.659> these<00:01:45.659> bars<00:01:46.020> is<00:01:46.140> that

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
cool feature about these bars is that

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.999 
cool feature about these bars is that
they<00:01:46.470> have<00:01:46.649> AV<00:01:47.009> r<00:01:47.159> CF<00:01:47.700> shape<00:01:48.770> bonteri<00:01:49.770> is<00:01:49.829> done

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
they have AV r CF shape bonteri is done

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.639 
they have AV r CF shape bonteri is done
really<00:01:50.189> great<00:01:50.579> with<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:50.939> VR<00:01:51.180> CF<00:01:51.570> or<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:52.079> VRC

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
really great with the VR CF or the VRC

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.550 
really great with the VR CF or the VRC
which<00:01:52.950> is<00:01:53.100> a<00:01:53.130> virtual<00:01:53.520> radius<00:01:54.000> compact<00:01:54.509> and<00:01:54.780> so

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
which is a virtual radius compact and so

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.260 
which is a virtual radius compact and so
if<00:01:55.680> you<00:01:55.799> can<00:01:55.950> tell<00:01:56.100> by<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.280> drop<00:01:56.670> here<00:01:56.939> this<00:01:57.149> is

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
if you can tell by the drop here this is

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.840 
if you can tell by the drop here this is
a<00:01:57.299> virtual<00:01:57.540> radius<00:01:58.049> compact<00:01:58.590> but<00:01:59.369> what<00:01:59.729> we

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
a virtual radius compact but what we

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.819 
a virtual radius compact but what we
added<00:02:00.119> with<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.360> isobar<00:02:00.840> was<00:02:00.990> a<00:02:01.020> flare<00:02:01.380> so

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
added with the isobar was a flare so

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.399 
added with the isobar was a flare so
there's<00:02:02.009> a<00:02:02.070> six<00:02:02.369> degree<00:02:02.520> flare<00:02:03.030> on<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.360> on<00:02:04.229> the

side<00:02:04.619> on<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:04.979> drops<00:02:05.250> so<00:02:05.880> that<00:02:05.909> allows<00:02:06.360> you<00:02:06.509> to

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570

little<00:02:13.020> bit<00:02:13.200> of<00:02:13.260> a

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
little bit of a

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:14.870
