00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:13.039
 Welcome to my channel, I'm Maria, 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:15.260
 I bring the new maps of miscreants 2 the 

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:19.040
 first it could not be otherwise no of 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:22.430
 the the zombies tainted me nothing 

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:24.380
 and rise are four lost fools that 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:27.619
 each one has a different disease and 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:30.619
 in alcatraz prison it has to be 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:34.820
 from very scary old guns 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:39.210
 new and so on the first multi encore 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:43.469
 a very tiny map 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:46.370
 a scenario and well, it's very 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:50.190
 kid, nothing, this will have to be played, no 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:53.480
 he does not tell me anything he does not say anything good to me 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:56.400
 next spectacular magma a volcano 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:59.010
 spits lava everywhere, this is 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:02.309
 a species like that of hydro in the of of 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.920
 hydro you drown you go with the water and here you 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.990
 you burn with the lava, so you have to 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.509
 not very big but seems to play 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.320
 good spectacular indeed yes that what 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:16.979
 it looks excellent 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:20.520
 the volcano the third is study and here 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:23.310
 yes here we go to Hollywood as if 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.470
 we got in the same for me or in 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.929
 some of these mogollÃ³n of scenarios 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.990
 everywhere I fear that camps 

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:34.170
 buts because you can climb up getting in 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:38.550
 inside all the sets there are 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:40.710
 very different sets and good enough 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:43.159
 this is going to be quite interesting and 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:47.100
 my favourite 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:50.630
 is made in the in the last floor of 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:55.020
 a skyscraper and this is going to be great 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:58.140
 very cool jumps is very similar to that of 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:02.340
 modern warfare 3 and good here you have a 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:05.340
 little bit like that the 4 is not so cool 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:09.090
 we will have to wait until the 16th for 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:11.940
 play them and well then nothing when they leave 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:16.200
 to put now yes to see that they do not play 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:18.690
 we will all enjoy them and the 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.180
 we will play as always as we can 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:24.290
 I hope you liked the video and a 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.290
 I greet everyone
