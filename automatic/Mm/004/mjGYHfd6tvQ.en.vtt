iPad the iPad 1 and I watched and I

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:20.950 
iPad the iPad 1 and I watched and I
became<00:00:19.040> fascinated<00:00:19.400> with<00:00:19.940> the<00:00:20.150> possibilities

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:20.960 
became fascinated with the possibilities

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.060 
became fascinated with the possibilities
of<00:00:21.290> what<00:00:21.950> could<00:00:22.010> be<00:00:22.630> the<00:00:23.630> rare<00:00:23.810> students<00:00:24.740> with

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:25.070

opportunity<00:00:27.110> I<00:00:27.680> guess<00:00:28.100> to<00:00:28.460> really<00:00:28.850> progress

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:29.740 
opportunity I guess to really progress

directions we were going with use of

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:07.569 
directions we were going with use of
technology<00:01:05.630> we<00:01:05.869> had<00:01:06.109> probably<00:01:06.590> five<00:01:07.130> devices

00:01:07.569 --> 00:01:07.579 
technology we had probably five devices

00:01:07.579 --> 00:01:09.429 
technology we had probably five devices
in<00:01:07.969> the<00:01:08.060> classroom<00:01:08.090> so<00:01:08.780> to<00:01:08.840> have<00:01:09.020> a<00:01:09.049> one-to-one

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
will this device enable our students to

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.120 
will this device enable our students to
access<00:01:20.259> literacy<00:01:21.259> to<00:01:21.499> develop<00:01:21.950> their

to do in their task in January of 2011
myself<00:04:12.090> and<00:04:12.210> another<00:04:12.270> teacher<00:04:13.190> went<00:04:14.190> over<00:04:14.400> to

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:14.580 
myself and another teacher went over to

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:17.300 
myself and another teacher went over to
Dallas<00:04:15.090> and<00:04:15.270> we<00:04:15.810> worked<00:04:16.019> with<00:04:16.200> a<00:04:16.530> team<00:04:16.920> from

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
Dallas and we worked with a team from

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.400 
Dallas and we worked with a team from
Apple<00:04:17.670> they're<00:04:17.850> about<00:04:18.329> this<00:04:18.510> new<00:04:18.690> program<00:04:18.900> and

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
Apple they're about this new program and

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.710 
Apple they're about this new program and
basically<00:04:20.100> it's<00:04:20.400> very<00:04:20.910> similar<00:04:21.209> in<00:04:21.450> a<00:04:21.510> way<00:04:21.540> to

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
basically it's very similar in a way to

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.080 
basically it's very similar in a way to
a<00:04:21.930> lot<00:04:22.230> of<00:04:22.320> inquiry<00:04:22.740> based<00:04:23.100> or<00:04:23.400> project-based

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
a lot of inquiry based or project-based

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.930 
a lot of inquiry based or project-based
learning<00:04:24.270> but<00:04:25.260> the<00:04:25.860> final<00:04:26.370> end<00:04:26.640> of<00:04:26.730> it<00:04:26.820> is

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
learning but the final end of it is

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.000 
learning but the final end of it is
really<00:04:27.270> that<00:04:27.450> is<00:04:28.080> a<00:04:28.140> big<00:04:28.350> focus<00:04:28.590> on<00:04:28.920> the

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.010 
really that is a big focus on the

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:31.970 
really that is a big focus on the
process<00:04:29.460> and<00:04:29.750> the<00:04:30.750> product<00:04:31.140> with<00:04:31.860> the

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:31.980 
process and the product with the

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:33.380 
process and the product with the
teachers<00:04:32.370> again<00:04:32.640> it<00:04:32.760> was<00:04:32.880> that<00:04:33.030> level<00:04:33.330> of

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:33.390 
teachers again it was that level of

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:34.790 
teachers again it was that level of
excitement<00:04:33.750> that<00:04:34.140> they<00:04:34.320> were<00:04:34.380> doing

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
excitement that they were doing

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.100 
excitement that they were doing
something<00:04:35.250> different<00:04:35.700> our<00:04:36.180> trail<00:04:36.510> blazing<00:04:37.020> in

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
something different our trail blazing in

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.680 
something different our trail blazing in
a<00:04:37.170> way<00:04:37.290> it<00:04:37.950> ignited<00:04:38.370> their<00:04:38.640> passions<00:04:39.150> many<00:04:39.570> of

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690 
a way it ignited their passions many of

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:41.480 
a way it ignited their passions many of
them<00:04:39.810> had<00:04:39.990> experience<00:04:40.530> with<00:04:40.680> technology<00:04:41.460> and

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
them had experience with technology and

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.820 
them had experience with technology and
different<00:04:41.850> way<00:04:41.940> and<00:04:42.210> this<00:04:42.780> was<00:04:43.050> a<00:04:43.260> different

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
different way and this was a different

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.680 
different way and this was a different
path<00:04:44.160> though<00:04:44.430> going<00:04:44.700> down<00:04:44.820> so<00:04:45.240> they<00:04:45.330> could<00:04:45.480> see

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.690 
path though going down so they could see

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:48.170 
path though going down so they could see
some<00:04:45.990> real<00:04:46.230> work<00:04:46.500> they'll<00:04:47.160> share<00:04:47.640> their

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180 
some real work they'll share their

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.240 
some real work they'll share their
learning<00:04:48.600> with<00:04:48.720> their<00:04:48.930> families<00:04:49.440> what<00:04:50.130> the

a theoretical conclusion to a piece of

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:15.130 
a theoretical conclusion to a piece of
learning<00:05:10.560> it<00:05:10.950> was<00:05:11.160> an<00:05:11.280> actual<00:05:12.140> life<00:05:13.140> hardcore

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:15.140

were real and since the iPad came along

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:23.450 
were real and since the iPad came along
and<00:05:22.020> we<00:05:22.110> saw<00:05:22.350> how<00:05:22.380> many<00:05:22.680> different<00:05:23.100> apps<00:05:23.250> there

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.460 
and we saw how many different apps there

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:25.550 
and we saw how many different apps there
are<00:05:23.580> being<00:05:23.790> developed<00:05:24.000> for<00:05:24.290> Georgian<00:05:25.290> and
