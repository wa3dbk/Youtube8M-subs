00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 
why you went for vain only the second

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:05.530 
why you went for vain only the second
time<00:00:04.350> that<00:00:04.410> we've<00:00:04.680> seen<00:00:04.830> her<00:00:04.890> here<00:00:05.009> in<00:00:05.100> the<00:00:05.190> LCS

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:05.540 
time that we've seen her here in the LCS

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.360 
time that we've seen her here in the LCS
so<00:00:06.540> our<00:00:06.690> place<00:00:07.020> there<00:00:07.319> we<00:00:07.500> figured<00:00:07.890> out<00:00:07.980> is

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
so our place there we figured out is

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.759 
so our place there we figured out is
that<00:00:08.790> it's<00:00:09.000> very<00:00:09.150> 80<00:00:09.450> centric<00:00:09.990> that<00:00:10.440> where<00:00:10.620> I

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
that it's very 80 centric that where I

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.589 
that it's very 80 centric that where I
take<00:00:11.040> a<00:00:11.099> lot<00:00:11.309> of<00:00:11.370> fun<00:00:11.639> and<00:00:11.849> I<00:00:12.150> get<00:00:12.210> a<00:00:12.360> lot<00:00:12.540> of

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
take a lot of fun and I get a lot of

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.950 
take a lot of fun and I get a lot of
kids<00:00:12.809> normally<00:00:13.040> so<00:00:14.040> we<00:00:14.480> trained<00:00:15.480> it<00:00:15.599> off<00:00:15.719> Wayne

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
kids normally so we trained it off Wayne

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.570 
kids normally so we trained it off Wayne
because<00:00:16.289> that's<00:00:16.560> the<00:00:16.680> carry<00:00:16.890> I<00:00:16.980> can<00:00:17.220> carry<00:00:17.400> the

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
because that's the carry I can carry the

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.240 
because that's the carry I can carry the
most<00:00:17.730> with<00:00:18.000> so<00:00:18.359> we<00:00:19.320> trained<00:00:19.590> Wayne<00:00:19.770> and<00:00:20.010> then

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
most with so we trained Wayne and then

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.640 
most with so we trained Wayne and then
we<00:00:20.400> banned<00:00:20.609> Kaitlyn<00:00:21.180> and<00:00:21.330> Annie<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:22.199> counters

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
we banned Kaitlyn and Annie the counters

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.370 
we banned Kaitlyn and Annie the counters
to<00:00:22.769> Wayne<00:00:22.920> and<00:00:23.160> then<00:00:23.640> we<00:00:23.699> just<00:00:23.730> picked<00:00:24.240> her

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:24.380 
to Wayne and then we just picked her

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.420 
to Wayne and then we just picked her
let's<00:00:25.380> quite<00:00:25.529> strong<00:00:25.769> words<00:00:26.010> is<00:00:26.160> it<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.400> only

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
let's quite strong words is it the only

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.450 
let's quite strong words is it the only
count<00:00:27.119> is<00:00:27.359> too<00:00:27.539> vain<00:00:27.949> because<00:00:28.949> that's<00:00:29.220> like

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
count is too vain because that's like

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.749 
count is too vain because that's like
very<00:00:29.519> strong<00:00:29.970> all<00:00:30.810> right<00:00:31.109> now<00:00:31.399> they're<00:00:32.399> strong

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
very strong all right now they're strong

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.310 
very strong all right now they're strong
lanes<00:00:33.000> against<00:00:33.360> Wayne<00:00:33.540> but<00:00:33.750> not<00:00:33.870> straight<00:00:34.200> up

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
lanes against Wayne but not straight up

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.650 
lanes against Wayne but not straight up
counters<00:00:34.770> I<00:00:35.010> think<00:00:35.640> Wayne<00:00:36.090> is<00:00:36.239> good<00:00:36.390> against

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
counters I think Wayne is good against

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.780 
counters I think Wayne is good against
luna<00:00:36.870> she's<00:00:37.230> good<00:00:37.380> again<00:00:37.559> stretch<00:00:37.829> and<00:00:38.070> all<00:00:38.579> ad

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
luna she's good again stretch and all ad

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.180 
luna she's good again stretch and all ad
carries<00:00:39.180> so<00:00:39.989> if<00:00:40.110> you<00:00:40.200> ban<00:00:40.379> Caitlyn<00:00:40.770> and<00:00:40.950> any

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
carries so if you ban Caitlyn and any

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.549 
carries so if you ban Caitlyn and any
then<00:00:41.760> there's<00:00:42.360> nothing<00:00:42.690> that<00:00:42.840> can<00:00:42.870> really

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
then there's nothing that can really

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.889 
then there's nothing that can really
shut<00:00:43.800> down<00:00:43.860> win<00:00:44.270> silver<00:00:45.270> was<00:00:45.450> a<00:00:45.480> lane<00:00:45.719> swap

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
shut down win silver was a lane swap

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.810 
shut down win silver was a lane swap
initiated<00:00:46.590> did<00:00:46.920> you<00:00:47.039> maybe<00:00:47.190> want<00:00:47.430> to<00:00:47.489> go<00:00:47.610> for

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
initiated did you maybe want to go for

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.100 
initiated did you maybe want to go for
the<00:00:47.910> two<00:00:48.059> versus<00:00:48.390> one<00:00:48.420> but<00:00:48.660> then<00:00:48.780> they<00:00:48.899> showed

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
the two versus one but then they showed

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.130 
the two versus one but then they showed
up<00:00:49.260> as<00:00:49.410> well<00:00:49.559> right<00:00:50.489> so<00:00:50.820> we<00:00:51.149> said<00:00:51.449> at<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:52.079> start

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
up as well right so we said at the start

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.770 
up as well right so we said at the start
of<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.530> game<00:00:52.680> that<00:00:52.910> it's<00:00:53.910> fine<00:00:54.239> if<00:00:54.420> relate<00:00:54.660> to

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
of the game that it's fine if relate to

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.330 
of the game that it's fine if relate to
verse<00:00:54.960> two<00:00:55.170> we<00:00:55.469> would<00:00:55.649> survive<00:00:55.890> it<00:00:56.070> we<00:00:56.190> were

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
verse two we would survive it we were

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.889 
verse two we would survive it we were
not<00:00:56.460> get<00:00:56.610> crushed<00:00:56.879> but<00:00:57.420> it<00:00:57.510> would<00:00:57.600> be<00:00:57.629> better

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
not get crushed but it would be better

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.869 
not get crushed but it would be better
if<00:00:58.020> we<00:00:58.079> land<00:00:58.289> swap<00:00:58.530> so<00:00:58.770> we<00:00:59.039> aim<00:00:59.280> for<00:00:59.520> lane<00:00:59.640> swap

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
if we land swap so we aim for lane swap

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.020 
if we land swap so we aim for lane swap
they<00:01:00.480> predicted<00:01:00.960> it<00:01:01.079> in<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:02.460> end<00:01:02.550> it<00:01:02.670> was<00:01:02.820> fine

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
they predicted it in the end it was fine

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.850 
they predicted it in the end it was fine
talk<00:01:03.719> to<00:01:03.809> me<00:01:03.870> a<00:01:03.930> little<00:01:03.989> about<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.439> early<00:01:04.710> game

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
talk to me a little about the early game

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.469 
talk to me a little about the early game
because<00:01:05.129> you<00:01:05.159> struggled<00:01:05.820> very<00:01:06.030> early<00:01:06.450> on

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
because you struggled very early on

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.719 
because you struggled very early on
Spence<00:01:07.110> Karen<00:01:07.560> and<00:01:07.710> Freddie<00:01:08.250> had<00:01:08.430> a<00:01:08.460> very<00:01:08.670> good

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
Spence Karen and Freddie had a very good

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:09.980 
Spence Karen and Freddie had a very good
synergy<00:01:09.030> they've<00:01:09.299> got<00:01:09.390> a<00:01:09.420> lot<00:01:09.659> of<00:01:09.689> kills

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
synergy they've got a lot of kills

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.899 
synergy they've got a lot of kills
together<00:01:10.320> but<00:01:10.830> how<00:01:11.159> did<00:01:11.220> you<00:01:11.369> transition<00:01:11.640> from

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
together but how did you transition from

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.390 
together but how did you transition from
that<00:01:12.180> sort<00:01:12.390> of<00:01:12.420> losing<00:01:13.080> laning<00:01:13.560> phase<00:01:13.830> two

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
that sort of losing laning phase two

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.760 
that sort of losing laning phase two
pulling<00:01:14.700> it<00:01:14.790> back<00:01:14.970> in<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.180> mid<00:01:15.330> game<00:01:15.650> that's<00:01:16.650> a

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
pulling it back in the mid game that's a

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.530 
pulling it back in the mid game that's a
good<00:01:16.890> question<00:01:17.070> actually<00:01:17.340> because<00:01:17.549> i<00:01:18.000> don't

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
good question actually because i don't

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.660 
good question actually because i don't
know<00:01:18.600> i<00:01:18.689> was<00:01:18.869> just<00:01:19.020> off<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:20.070> sideline<00:01:20.490> i<00:01:20.520> was

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
know i was just off the sideline i was

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.730 
know i was just off the sideline i was
just<00:01:20.820> farming<00:01:21.210> and<00:01:21.420> then<00:01:21.630> my<00:01:22.170> team<00:01:22.350> was<00:01:22.530> just

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
just farming and then my team was just

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.920 
just farming and then my team was just
catching<00:01:22.950> back<00:01:23.280> up<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:24.060> thing<00:01:24.270> is<00:01:24.299> that<00:01:24.450> i

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
catching back up the thing is that i

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.590 
catching back up the thing is that i
tried<00:01:25.590> to<00:01:25.619> do<00:01:25.950> i<00:01:26.549> tried<00:01:27.000> to<00:01:27.090> split<00:01:27.240> push<00:01:27.450> in<00:01:27.570> the

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
tried to do i tried to split push in the

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.780 
tried to do i tried to split push in the
mid<00:01:27.810> game<00:01:27.960> but<00:01:28.890> they<00:01:29.009> really<00:01:29.220> focus<00:01:29.369> on<00:01:29.670> me

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
mid game but they really focus on me

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.020 
mid game but they really focus on me
they<00:01:29.909> always<00:01:30.030> roam<00:01:30.329> down<00:01:30.540> was<00:01:30.750> 43<00:01:31.320> man<00:01:32.030> which

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
they always roam down was 43 man which

crew<00:04:56.640> as<00:04:56.760> they<00:04:56.910> take<00:04:57.060> on<00:04:57.240> the<00:04:57.300> copenhagen

wolves<00:04:57.900> Trevor<00:04:58.410> what<00:04:58.620> do<00:04:58.680> you<00:04:58.740> think<00:04:58.920> I<00:04:59.390> think

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:00.390 
wolves Trevor what do you think I think

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:01.970 
wolves Trevor what do you think I think
the<00:05:00.540> supa<00:05:00.840> hot<00:05:00.900> crew<00:05:00.960> in<00:05:01.170> a<00:05:01.200> bit<00:05:01.320> of<00:05:01.350> a<00:05:01.470> streak<00:05:01.770> I

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:01.980 
the supa hot crew in a bit of a streak I

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:04.280 
the supa hot crew in a bit of a streak I
actually<00:05:02.490> think<00:05:02.850> the<00:05:03.120> copenhagen<00:05:03.600> wolves<00:05:03.750> had

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:04.290 
actually think the copenhagen wolves had

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:05.450 
actually think the copenhagen wolves had
a<00:05:04.320> little<00:05:04.650> bit<00:05:04.770> more<00:05:04.890> problems<00:05:05.280> in<00:05:05.400> the

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:05.460 
a little bit more problems in the

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:06.650 
a little bit more problems in the
decision-making<00:05:05.880> that<00:05:06.150> need<00:05:06.360> to<00:05:06.480> work

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:06.660 
decision-making that need to work

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:08.360 
decision-making that need to work
through<00:05:06.840> so<00:05:07.110> I'm<00:05:07.650> gonna<00:05:07.860> give<00:05:08.040> this<00:05:08.190> one<00:05:08.340> a

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:08.370 
through so I'm gonna give this one a

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:09.620 
through so I'm gonna give this one a
super<00:05:08.730> crew<00:05:08.940> I<00:05:09.000> think<00:05:09.180> they're<00:05:09.270> a<00:05:09.300> little<00:05:09.360> bit

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:09.630 
super crew I think they're a little bit

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:11.000 
super crew I think they're a little bit
the<00:05:09.720> underdogs<00:05:10.110> but<00:05:10.560> they're<00:05:10.740> playing<00:05:10.920> well

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.010 
the underdogs but they're playing well

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:13.280 
the underdogs but they're playing well
enough<00:05:11.190> to<00:05:11.460> get<00:05:11.880> my<00:05:12.000> vote<00:05:12.150> your<00:05:12.840> opinion<00:05:13.140> I

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:13.290 
enough to get my vote your opinion I

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:16.940 
enough to get my vote your opinion I
think<00:05:14.220> it's<00:05:14.730> see<00:05:14.970> Ed<00:05:15.360> where's<00:05:16.050> yes<00:05:16.350> so<00:05:16.620> i<00:05:16.650> can

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:16.950 
think it's see Ed where's yes so i can

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:21.260 
think it's see Ed where's yes so i can
predict<00:05:17.280> it<00:05:17.900> well<00:05:18.900> right
