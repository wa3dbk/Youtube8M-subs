00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.910

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:20.590
 the debate by the first chapters 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:22.570
 for my part I started my first 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.030
 video game at the age of 4 by my father 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:27.340
 who showed me and introduced me to 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.050
 set thumbs up good I do not make you 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.860
 description because I myself 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.690
 remember more very well 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.220
 in any case I know it was a game 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.979
 of adventure where you control a car 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:38.770
 who speak quite normal that every 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:40.740
 Anyway person who breaks 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:45.340
 talk about it at every street corner 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.869
 little word game posed after having 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.670
 grew up I started playing games 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:51.130
 like rayman and ratchet &amp; clank 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.140
 it was also the period when I 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.060
 were putting in the video game and 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.770
 it's really huge games at this 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.630
 time there and still today 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.750
 interested in marrying with predator that there 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.610

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.410
 virgin hawks and if you can 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.670
 not very long ago one or two years ago 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:07.070
 later I discovered the games of 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.460
 fps i take in particular call of 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.560
 duty 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:13.190
 it was for me a huge favorite 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:16.550
 whether it is 4 mw 2 or black 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.990

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.610

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.920
 etc. 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.180
 the comment space and there I look 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:27.290
 all the comments and I answer them 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:29.330
 all so do not hesitate we pass 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.520
 now in the second chapter which has 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:34.820
 to tell you my favorite games 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:37.489
 whether today or before so 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:41.180
 but I preferred his raimon ratchet &amp; 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:43.910
 skyrim clank black ops 1 and 2 modern 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:47.560

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:49.940
 minecraft of stars and many others 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.660
 so me especially since 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.400
 quite some time 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.530
 I have a big crush on the games 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.660
 of survival I currently have no 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:03:02.300
 minecraft and stars who are I think 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:04.700
 the best known and have happened now 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:07.040
 in the thick of it we will talk 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.390
 of the evolution of video games I you 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.769
 ask to be active in the 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:14.060
 comments or have your opinion at this 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:16.190
 subject this part I live at 3 you 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.290
 you may have noticed it li a modern 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:20.269
 warfare four ghost which is planned for 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.110
 the end of the year so I do not know if 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:23.989
 you are going to buy it 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:28.030
 me anyway yes out of pure curiosity 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:28.030
 like for and f4 coming out soon 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:34.220
 I would just like to point out something 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:36.410
 for people who think that ghoul m v4 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.840
 and benfica will be beautiful in term 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:41.060
 of graphics darken right in the wall 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.829
 why simply because when 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.710
 we come to a stage where the graphics is 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:46.450
 already very high 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:48.070
 more improve it if only in 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.190
 changing the graphical engine of your 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:52.960
 console what will surely happen 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:55.170
 for consoles from the peace but scott 

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:57.490
 still the xbox 720 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:59.620
 precisely because we speak of consonants 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:02.200
 we will talk about the mini war 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:05.050
 between xbox and ps3 there are often some 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.550
 ps3 or xbox players that will say yeah 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:09.550
 this console is better than it is the 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:11.500
 faulx know that ps3 and xbox have 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:12.910
 their qualities as their faults that 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.190
 these pigs saying that this console 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:17.260
 is better we're going to sell the one we 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:18.850
 just for you what I do you 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.130
 advise in any case that to take the 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:24.160
 console where there are the most of your friends 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:26.680
 for example you have 50 friends on ps3 and 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.540
 2 on xbox is better to take the ps3 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.880
 or conversely friends is already the 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:31.960
 end of this video just debate a thing 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.940
 to tell you before you leave 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:36.220
 do not forget that video games on the 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.390
 pushes to entertain and relax and not 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.130
 not to take the head 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:41.020
 anyway do not hesitate to 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:42.970
 track down in the comments to say 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:45.130
 is that you think your opinions and it's 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:48.030
 so on another course of the next 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:48.030
 video chat in the world
