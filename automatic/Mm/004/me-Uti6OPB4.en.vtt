first<00:01:36.040> align<00:01:36.400> we're<00:01:37.360> still<00:01:37.659> a<00:01:37.690> little<00:01:37.870> bit<00:01:38.049> of

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
first align we're still a little bit of

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:39.450 
first align we're still a little bit of
ways<00:01:38.229> from<00:01:38.470> that<00:01:38.680> you<00:01:38.860> can<00:01:38.890> imagine<00:01:39.190> the

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 
ways from that you can imagine the

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.190 
ways from that you can imagine the
testing<00:01:39.880> and<00:01:39.909> localization<00:01:40.570> going<00:01:40.990> through

testing and localization going through

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.850 
testing and localization going through
yeah<00:01:41.530> we<00:01:42.220> are

yeah we are

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.070 
yeah we are
exactly<00:01:43.790> so<00:01:44.030> once<00:01:44.210> we<00:01:44.360> get<00:01:44.450> that<00:01:44.630> locked<00:01:44.900> and

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:45.080 
exactly so once we get that locked and

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.960 
exactly so once we get that locked and
loaded<00:01:45.170> will<00:01:45.830> roll<00:01:46.070> to<00:01:46.100> the<00:01:46.250> next<00:01:46.550> 10<00:01:46.670> update
