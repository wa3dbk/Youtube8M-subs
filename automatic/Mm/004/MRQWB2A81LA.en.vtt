00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.460 
2015
this<00:00:15.269> time<00:00:15.480> our<00:00:15.719> selection<00:00:16.199> is<00:00:16.320> quite

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
this time our selection is quite

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.830 
this time our selection is quite
eclectic<00:00:16.920> as<00:00:17.490> you<00:00:17.640> will<00:00:17.820> see<00:00:18.029> so<00:00:18.270> number<00:00:18.660> one

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
eclectic as you will see so number one

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.849 
eclectic as you will see so number one
let's<00:00:19.289> start<00:00:19.380> with<00:00:20.210> hyt<00:00:21.210> and<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.720> h3<00:00:22.470> is<00:00:22.500> a<00:00:22.619> new

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
let's start with hyt and the h3 is a new

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.950 
let's start with hyt and the h3 is a new
model<00:00:23.100> from<00:00:23.369> hyt<00:00:23.789> actually<00:00:24.150> which<00:00:24.480> displays

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
model from hyt actually which displays

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.080 
model from hyt actually which displays
the<00:00:24.990> time<00:00:25.289> linear<00:00:25.680> what<00:00:26.220> is<00:00:26.369> amazing<00:00:26.670> is<00:00:27.060> that

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
the time linear what is amazing is that

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.640 
the time linear what is amazing is that
for<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:27.660> first<00:00:27.689> time<00:00:28.019> actually<00:00:28.170> we<00:00:28.470> don't

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
for the first time actually we don't

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.040 
for the first time actually we don't
have<00:00:28.800> a<00:00:28.980> round<00:00:29.310> shape<00:00:29.550> for<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.910> capillary<00:00:30.420> but

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
have a round shape for the capillary but

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.520 
have a round shape for the capillary but
it<00:00:31.349> is<00:00:31.500> a<00:00:31.650> line<00:00:32.040> and<00:00:32.309> this<00:00:33.059> is<00:00:33.239> somehow<00:00:33.530> trick

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
it is a line and this is somehow trick

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.500 
it is a line and this is somehow trick
that<00:00:34.680> is<00:00:34.800> interesting<00:00:35.370> it<00:00:35.850> was<00:00:36.030> technically

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
that is interesting it was technically

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.240 
that is interesting it was technically
not<00:00:36.600> so<00:00:37.140> difficult<00:00:37.620> what<00:00:37.829> was<00:00:38.040> more

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
not so difficult what was more

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.709 
not so difficult what was more
interesting<00:00:38.309> in<00:00:38.760> this<00:00:38.910> watch<00:00:39.120> and<00:00:39.270> that<00:00:39.450> was

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
interesting in this watch and that was

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.680 
interesting in this watch and that was
people<00:00:40.140> didn't<00:00:40.950> focus<00:00:41.160> at<00:00:41.489> my<00:00:41.940> opinion<00:00:42.329> enough

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
people didn't focus at my opinion enough

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.290 
people didn't focus at my opinion enough
on<00:00:42.899> is<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.680> indication<00:00:44.280> of<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.489> minute<00:00:44.910> which

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
on is the indication of the minute which

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.959 
on is the indication of the minute which
is<00:00:45.420> displayed<00:00:45.719> with<00:00:46.050> an<00:00:46.200> end<00:00:46.350> on<00:00:46.590> an<00:00:47.100> line<00:00:47.700> and

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
is displayed with an end on an line and

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.520 
is displayed with an end on an line and
this<00:00:48.149> is<00:00:48.390> very<00:00:48.629> difficult<00:00:49.050> because<00:00:49.200> it's

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
this is very difficult because it's

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.189 
this is very difficult because it's
implied<00:00:50.010> actually<00:00:50.700> kind<00:00:51.600> of<00:00:51.719> satellite

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
implied actually kind of satellite

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.979 
implied actually kind of satellite
system<00:00:52.649> which<00:00:52.920> was<00:00:53.129> very<00:00:53.399> very<00:00:53.820> complex<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:54.870> do

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
system which was very very complex to do

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.380 
system which was very very complex to do
so<00:00:55.230> a<00:00:55.590> very<00:00:56.100> a<00:00:56.160> kind<00:00:56.430> of<00:00:56.520> subtility<00:00:56.910> that<00:00:57.239> we

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
so a very a kind of subtility that we

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.110 
so a very a kind of subtility that we
didn't<00:00:57.690> expect<00:00:58.109> in<00:00:58.230> this<00:00:58.410> watch<00:00:58.590> so<00:00:58.940> number<00:00:59.940> 2

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
didn't expect in this watch so number 2

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.020 
didn't expect in this watch so number 2
number<00:01:00.809> 2<00:01:00.960> we<00:01:01.289> go<00:01:01.469> in<00:01:01.710> Germany<00:01:02.129> we<00:01:02.489> go<00:01:02.640> at<00:01:02.820> No

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
number 2 we go in Germany we go at No

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.969 
number 2 we go in Germany we go at No
Mas<00:01:03.180> because<00:01:03.809> No<00:01:03.989> Mas<00:01:04.140> launched<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:04.650> new

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
Mas because No Mas launched a new

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.580 
Mas because No Mas launched a new
movement<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.729> DW<00:01:06.210> 3000<00:01:06.869> which<00:01:07.260> is<00:01:07.439> an

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
movement the DW 3000 which is an

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.679 
movement the DW 3000 which is an
ultra-thin<00:01:08.070> movement<00:01:08.610> interesting<00:01:09.450> because

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
ultra-thin movement interesting because

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.320 
ultra-thin movement interesting because
the<00:01:10.409> windage<00:01:11.130> system<00:01:11.490> is<00:01:11.670> inside<00:01:12.119> the

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
the windage system is inside the

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.140 
the windage system is inside the
movement<00:01:12.540> to<00:01:13.170> gain<00:01:13.380> some<00:01:13.680> kind<00:01:13.920> of<00:01:14.189> thinness

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
movement to gain some kind of thinness

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.510 
movement to gain some kind of thinness
so<00:01:15.600> thanks<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.259> it<00:01:16.380> they<00:01:16.560> could<00:01:16.770> launch<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:17.189> new

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
so thanks to it they could launch a new

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.210 
so thanks to it they could launch a new
line<00:01:17.549> which<00:01:17.939> is<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.119> mini<00:01:18.479> Matic<00:01:18.810> and<00:01:19.020> of<00:01:19.920> course

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
line which is a mini Matic and of course

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.219 
line which is a mini Matic and of course
at<00:01:20.460> No<00:01:20.909> Mas<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.330> design<00:01:21.570> is<00:01:21.750> really<00:01:22.049> clear

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
at No Mas the design is really clear

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.679 
at No Mas the design is really clear
very<00:01:22.650> smart<00:01:23.340> very<00:01:23.520> elegant<00:01:24.090> and<00:01:24.180> it's

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
time you see two bridges on the top of

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.420 
time you see two bridges on the top of
the<00:01:45.780> watch<00:01:45.930> on<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.500> on<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.770> dial<00:01:46.950> side<00:01:47.189> but

the watch on the on the dial side but

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.020 
the watch on the on the dial side but
the<00:01:47.549> third<00:01:48.500> bridge<00:01:49.500> is<00:01:49.740> on<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.640> other<00:01:50.759> side<00:01:50.970> of

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
executed and really it is a must-have

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.960 
executed and really it is a must-have
somehow<00:03:23.440> because<00:03:23.829> of<00:03:23.950> its<00:03:24.100> simplicity<00:03:24.579> which

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
somehow because of its simplicity which

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:26.850 
somehow because of its simplicity which
is<00:03:25.150> something<00:03:25.360> so<00:03:25.900> hard<00:03:26.320> to<00:03:26.530> do<00:03:26.650> in

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:26.860 
is something so hard to do in

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.270 
is something so hard to do in
watchmaking<00:03:27.329> absolute<00:03:28.329> elegant<00:03:29.170> watch<00:03:29.440> for
