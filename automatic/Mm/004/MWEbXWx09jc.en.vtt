00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.309 
kinda nice not majorly updated in this
texture<00:03:21.950> pack<00:03:22.130> and<00:03:22.910> so<00:03:23.389> my<00:03:23.690> partner<00:03:24.079> thought

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:24.319 
texture pack and so my partner thought

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:26.250 
texture pack and so my partner thought
was<00:03:24.500> the<00:03:24.620> simple<00:03:25.040> craft<00:03:25.430> texture<00:03:26.000> pack

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
was the simple craft texture pack

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.479 
was the simple craft texture pack
hopefully<00:03:27.260> you<00:03:27.410> like<00:03:27.650> it<00:03:27.680> and<00:03:28.010> people<00:03:28.250> I've

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
hopefully you like it and people I've

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:31.780 
hopefully you like it and people I've
been<00:03:28.639> asking<00:03:29.090> to<00:03:29.299> give<00:03:30.290> a<00:03:30.530> rating<00:03:31.190> out<00:03:31.579> of<00:03:31.609> 10

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
been asking to give a rating out of 10

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.599 
been asking to give a rating out of 10
and<00:03:32.209> for<00:03:32.720> this<00:03:32.780> one<00:03:32.959> I'd<00:03:33.170> probably<00:03:33.620> give<00:03:34.250> it<00:03:34.400> a

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:34.609 
and for this one I'd probably give it a

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:37.960 
and for this one I'd probably give it a
six<00:03:35.180> out<00:03:35.420> hand<00:03:35.720> and<00:03:35.950> that<00:03:36.950> is<00:03:37.130> a<00:03:37.160> strong<00:03:37.549> 6<00:03:37.819> out

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
six out hand and that is a strong 6 out

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:39.759 
six out hand and that is a strong 6 out
of<00:03:38.000> 10<00:03:38.180> because<00:03:38.480> the<00:03:39.049> only<00:03:39.200> reason<00:03:39.500> marked

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:39.769 
of 10 because the only reason marked

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:41.979 
of 10 because the only reason marked
down<00:03:39.920> is<00:03:40.160> because<00:03:40.310> it's<00:03:40.639> so<00:03:40.790> simple<00:03:41.060> it's<00:03:41.750> kind

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:41.989 
down is because it's so simple it's kind

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:44.349 
down is because it's so simple it's kind
of<00:03:42.139> its<00:03:42.950> useful<00:03:43.250> border<00:03:43.819> it's<00:03:44.000> not<00:03:44.180> really

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:44.359 
of its useful border it's not really

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:46.000 
of its useful border it's not really
exciting<00:03:44.840> it'll<00:03:45.019> some<00:03:45.169> kind<00:03:45.349> of<00:03:45.440> appeal<00:03:45.769> to<00:03:45.889> me

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
exciting it'll some kind of appeal to me

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.069 
exciting it'll some kind of appeal to me
and<00:03:46.430> put<00:03:47.329> a<00:03:47.359> powerful<00:03:47.630> that<00:03:47.750> that's<00:03:47.930> why<00:03:48.019> you

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:48.079 
and put a powerful that that's why you

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:49.839 
and put a powerful that that's why you
gave<00:03:48.290> it<00:03:48.440> a<00:03:48.470> six<00:03:48.709> and<00:03:48.980> now<00:03:49.220> it's<00:03:49.459> want<00:03:49.639> to<00:03:49.700> talk

00:03:49.839 --> 00:03:49.849 
gave it a six and now it's want to talk

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:51.819 
gave it a six and now it's want to talk
