going to be leaving and hand hammering
of<00:02:16.360> the<00:02:16.540> idea<00:02:16.780> some<00:02:17.530> symbols<00:02:17.980> right<00:02:18.220> here<00:02:18.430> at

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
of the idea some symbols right here at

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.350 
of the idea some symbols right here at
the<00:02:18.940> store<00:02:20.070> so<00:02:21.070> there's<00:02:21.310> a<00:02:21.370> real<00:02:21.640> art<00:02:21.970> to<00:02:22.030> this

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.290 
the store so there's a real art to this
there<00:02:23.140> certainly<00:02:23.440> is<00:02:23.860> the<00:02:24.700> amount<00:02:25.090> of

training that goes into this is is quite

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:32.400 
training that goes into this is is quite
intensive<00:02:28.920> this<00:02:29.920> is<00:02:30.160> the<00:02:30.850> only<00:02:31.110> saving<00:02:32.110> is<00:02:32.290> the

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
long is this guy been at it I believe

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.760 
long is this guy been at it I believe
Ali<00:02:40.210> has<00:02:40.510> been<00:02:40.810> with<00:02:40.960> the<00:02:41.050> company<00:02:41.230> just

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
Ali has been with the company just

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.850 
Ali has been with the company just
around<00:02:42.220> 20<00:02:42.790> years<00:02:43.090> or<00:02:43.330> so<00:02:43.380> so<00:02:44.380> it<00:02:44.530> takes<00:02:44.710> a

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
around 20 years or so so it takes a

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.580 
around 20 years or so so it takes a
while<00:02:44.980> to<00:02:45.130> get<00:02:45.190> proficient<00:02:45.550> at<00:02:45.820> this<00:02:46.380> to<00:02:47.380> get

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
while to get proficient at this to get

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.680 
while to get proficient at this to get
to<00:02:47.860> the<00:02:47.890> level<00:02:48.490> where<00:02:48.640> you're<00:02:49.000> just<00:02:49.030> going<00:02:49.600> to

well I'm looking for a specific sound

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.250 
well I'm looking for a specific sound
and<00:03:14.860> we<00:03:15.610> will<00:03:15.820> work<00:03:16.360> with<00:03:16.390> that<00:03:16.660> artist<00:03:17.080> to

and we will work with that artist to

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.550 
and we will work with that artist to
achieve<00:03:17.620> those<00:03:17.830> sounds<00:03:18.190> for<00:03:18.400> them<00:03:18.550> does<00:03:19.270> the

achieve those sounds for them does the

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.320 
achieve those sounds for them does the
does<00:03:20.560> the<00:03:20.740> technique<00:03:21.250> and<00:03:21.459> the<00:03:21.550> manufacturing

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:22.330 
does the technique and the manufacturing

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.600 
does the technique and the manufacturing
process<00:03:22.360> does<00:03:23.050> it<00:03:23.170> evolve<00:03:23.530> over<00:03:23.890> time<00:03:24.070> or<00:03:24.550> is

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:24.610 
process does it evolve over time or is

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.510 
process does it evolve over time or is
it<00:03:24.730> pretty<00:03:24.880> much<00:03:25.120> known<00:03:25.500> no<00:03:26.500> it's<00:03:26.740> absolutely

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:27.520 
it pretty much known no it's absolutely

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.750 
it pretty much known no it's absolutely
evolving<00:03:28.150> and<00:03:28.360> we<00:03:28.630> like<00:03:28.810> to<00:03:28.959> think<00:03:29.200> that<00:03:29.760> we've

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
evolving and we like to think that we've

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.050 
evolving and we like to think that we've
really<00:03:31.540> brought<00:03:31.720> amongst<00:03:32.140> a<00:03:32.440> symbol<00:03:33.160> making

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
really brought amongst a symbol making

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.740 
really brought amongst a symbol making
revolution<00:03:34.750> symbol<00:03:35.650> making<00:03:36.040> has<00:03:36.190> been<00:03:36.750> quite

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
revolution symbol making has been quite

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.160 
revolution symbol making has been quite
similar<00:03:38.590> amongst<00:03:38.860> companies<00:03:39.400> for<00:03:39.910> many<00:03:40.600> many

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170 
similar amongst companies for many many

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.100 
similar amongst companies for many many
hundreds<00:03:41.650> of<00:03:41.740> years<00:03:41.800> right<00:03:42.520> and<00:03:42.790> in<00:03:43.420> the<00:03:43.930> last

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:44.110 
hundreds of years right and in the last

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:49.310 
hundreds of years right and in the last
25<00:03:44.740> we've<00:03:46.110> in<00:03:47.110> the<00:03:47.260> last<00:03:47.440> 25<00:03:47.860> we've<00:03:48.220> managed<00:03:48.640> to

25 we've in the last 25 we've managed to

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.230 
25 we've in the last 25 we've managed to
bring<00:03:50.320> symbol<00:03:50.680> making<00:03:51.040> to<00:03:51.280> a<00:03:51.310> higher<00:03:51.730> level<00:03:51.760> we

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:52.240 
bring symbol making to a higher level we

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:53.790 
bring symbol making to a higher level we
believe<00:03:52.510> yeah<00:03:53.050> we're<00:03:53.230> seeing<00:03:53.410> some<00:03:53.650> of<00:03:53.680> this

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:53.800 
believe yeah we're seeing some of this

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.170 
believe yeah we're seeing some of this
