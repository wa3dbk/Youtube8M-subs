00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:03.560
 Today I would like to show you how I experienced my old manufacturer 

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.870
 to State Photomatix pro 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.559
 rewarded with three Oscars 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:12.559
 taken in different directions decided only one 

00:00:15.649 --> 00:00:19.149
 aligned to align with this case OS freehand shots and 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.140
 Look at BP 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:27.549
 impressively also a single theater Erfurt Union v 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.349
 through and through and through 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:34.750
 so that both are just like that 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.050
 I do not want to have that 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.860
 but have my requirements conversation already has the honest Sladen 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.690
 his black and white Hollager 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:48.010
 Scholz SPD a bit black and white 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.060
 weak squad has spent street over stress 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.070
 the strong red 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.700
 Strelow process 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:57.920
 3 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.920
 save and without memory for foreign countries is top 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.910
 Although that was already 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.910
 it was just from Adobe Photoshop Elements 6 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.860
 in Switzerland was between to 9 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.860
 and the normally reported image will increase bad skore 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.340
 these are the pictures not quite congruent with the skore 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.350
 Panorama Photo 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.040
 Add open files 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.040
 OK 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.770
 one bit of Reckless bit weak on the chest anyway 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:40.370
 now we have here a dark mask niebel general masks level the 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:42.050

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.780
 also with undo 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.930
 that's right 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:51.730
 this is the gray endeavor 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:54.730
 it must take him Octobers 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.300

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.790
 up to 100 percent do it 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.520
 Images of 9 percent "That needs to see better 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.740
 if you have her 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.910
 it's true the opacity is often even 50 percent 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.069
 easy like it best 

00:02:15.249 --> 00:02:16.449
 Phyllis 

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:19.319
 them together 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:22.319
 duplicate that again 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:24.609
 set sharper 

00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:27.609
 stronger in the 50 the ZiB 2 Kor 5

 Kiwi often even 50 percent 

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:35.409
 for the levels together 

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:38.799

 Range 56% radius 1 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:49.169
 the fourth force 

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:51.599
 like around the 50th 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:53.789
 Fishermen together 

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:56.949

 NiteWatch 

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:01.609
 Cadieux also documents on the homepage of the 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:07.299

 that's how it works for you 

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:20.149
 Qantas you're running off a pattern bit Ando lane therefore against 

00:03:20.149 --> 00:03:23.029
 Eraser number 2 off 

00:03:23.029 --> 00:03:24.289
 Germany has 

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:26.359
 go or merge 

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:29.359

00:03:33.279 --> 00:03:35.909
 Brightness contrast 

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:39.089
 a bit more contrast 

00:03:39.089 --> 00:03:42.089
 Hennig KÃ¶lsch

00:03:51.869 --> 00:03:54.869
 Casino 

00:03:54.869 --> 00:03:58.609
 that's it especially for those who get together the high tension 

00:03:58.609 --> 00:03:59.869
 at her first corner 

00:03:59.869 --> 00:04:02.869
 so the war is essential that I do with my pictures 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:05.109
