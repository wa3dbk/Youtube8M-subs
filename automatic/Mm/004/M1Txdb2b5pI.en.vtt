00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:10.160 
hey guys this is a huge tall oak tree

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.770 
hey guys this is a huge tall oak tree
and<00:00:11.160> it's<00:00:11.460> got<00:00:11.580> to<00:00:11.670> come<00:00:11.759> down<00:00:11.820> today<00:00:12.179> because

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
and it's got to come down today because

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.919 
and it's got to come down today because
or<00:00:13.349> you<00:00:13.530> see<00:00:13.940> the<00:00:14.940> bar<00:00:15.179> could<00:00:15.480> start<00:00:15.690> pulling

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
or you see the bar could start pulling

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.560 
or you see the bar could start pulling
out<00:00:16.260> from<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:16.859> tree<00:00:17.100> and<00:00:17.460> when<00:00:18.150> we<00:00:18.240> knocked<00:00:18.480> a

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
out from the tree and when we knocked a

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:19.460 
out from the tree and when we knocked a
piece<00:00:18.750> of<00:00:18.900> it<00:00:18.990> off

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
piece of it off

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.560 
piece of it off
there's<00:00:20.070> beetles<00:00:20.520> all<00:00:20.760> up<00:00:21.029> and<00:00:21.180> down<00:00:21.300> and

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
there's beetles all up and down and

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.349 
there's beetles all up and down and
through<00:00:21.750> there<00:00:22.460> this<00:00:23.460> tree<00:00:23.730> did<00:00:23.910> not<00:00:24.060> put<00:00:24.240> off

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
through there this tree did not put off

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.540 
through there this tree did not put off
any<00:00:24.630> leaves<00:00:25.109> or<00:00:25.380> vegetation<00:00:25.859> at<00:00:26.130> all<00:00:26.250> last

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
any leaves or vegetation at all last

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.929 
any leaves or vegetation at all last
year<00:00:27.529> so<00:00:28.529> we<00:00:28.800> figured<00:00:29.099> there<00:00:29.279> was<00:00:29.369> a<00:00:29.400> problem

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
year so we figured there was a problem

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.820 
year so we figured there was a problem
we<00:00:30.060> just<00:00:30.090> weren't<00:00:30.359> sure<00:00:30.599> what<00:00:30.810> it<00:00:30.900> was<00:00:31.050> but<00:00:31.769> it

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
we just weren't sure what it was but it

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.380 
we just weren't sure what it was but it
is<00:00:32.189> clearly<00:00:32.579> some<00:00:33.030> kind<00:00:33.059> of<00:00:33.270> beetle<00:00:35.390> problem

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
is clearly some kind of beetle problem

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.650 
is clearly some kind of beetle problem
is<00:00:37.610> there's<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:38.850> house<00:00:40.879> you<00:00:41.879> can<00:00:42.000> see<00:00:42.030> how<00:00:42.420> far

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
is there's the house you can see how far

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.240 
is there's the house you can see how far
out<00:00:42.870> these<00:00:43.170> branches<00:00:43.620> go<00:00:43.770> let's<00:00:44.070> see<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:45.180> tree

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.250 
out these branches go let's see the tree

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:51.709 
out these branches go let's see the tree
see<00:00:47.250> how<00:00:47.370> far<00:00:47.640> out<00:00:47.789> they<00:00:47.940> come<00:00:50.090> so<00:00:51.090> Mike's<00:00:51.360> put

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
see how far out they come so Mike's put

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.060 
see how far out they come so Mike's put
these<00:00:52.620> braces<00:00:53.280> here<00:00:53.840> that's<00:00:54.840> one<00:00:55.110> step<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:55.890> try

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
these braces here that's one step to try

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.619 
these braces here that's one step to try
and<00:00:56.160> insure<00:00:56.460> that<00:00:56.520> doesn't<00:00:57.059> fall<00:00:57.180> towards<00:00:57.539> the

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
and insure that doesn't fall towards the

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.330 
and insure that doesn't fall towards the
house<00:00:57.780> and<00:00:59.329> I<00:01:00.329> want<00:01:01.320> to<00:01:01.410> show<00:01:01.620> you<00:01:01.710> what<00:01:02.039> the

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
house and I want to show you what the

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.179 
house and I want to show you what the
bark<00:01:02.699> looks<00:01:02.969> like<00:01:03.350> where<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.470> beetles<00:01:04.799> go<00:01:05.010> in

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
bark looks like where the beetles go in

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.850 
bark looks like where the beetles go in
so<00:01:05.369> you<00:01:05.430> can<00:01:05.640> identify<00:01:06.560> these<00:01:07.560> kind<00:01:07.799> of

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
so you can identify these kind of

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:15.109 
so you can identify these kind of
problems<00:01:08.100> yourself<00:01:12.890> now<00:01:13.890> first<00:01:14.280> actually<00:01:14.970> let

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
problems yourself now first actually let

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.960 
problems yourself now first actually let
me<00:01:15.210> show<00:01:15.240> you<00:01:15.420> this<00:01:15.890> all<00:01:16.890> right<00:01:17.100> right<00:01:17.759> above

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
me show you this all right right above

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.870 
me show you this all right right above
the<00:01:18.090> stepladder<00:01:18.330> you<00:01:18.630> can<00:01:18.780> see<00:01:18.960> how<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.229> bark

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:29.830 

just<00:01:23.509> peeling<00:01:23.750> away<00:01:23.960> there<00:01:24.290> in<00:01:24.500> layers<00:01:28.840> that

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
just peeling away there in layers that

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:35.440 
just peeling away there in layers that
was<00:01:30.049> our<00:01:30.229> first<00:01:30.469> sign<00:01:30.770> that<00:01:34.090> something<00:01:35.090> was

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
was our first sign that something was

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:41.010 
was our first sign that something was
wrong<00:01:35.780> so<00:01:36.229> then<00:01:39.100> see<00:01:40.100> if<00:01:40.220> I'll<00:01:40.340> be<00:01:40.490> able<00:01:40.579> to
