our second part of our Siberian storm
build<00:00:11.969> and<00:00:12.269> before<00:00:12.719> we<00:00:12.750> get<00:00:12.870> started<00:00:12.990> here<00:00:13.259> I

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
build and before we get started here I

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:14.030 
build and before we get started here I
thought<00:00:13.410> I<00:00:13.469> should<00:00:13.590> mention<00:00:13.799> that<00:00:13.950> this

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
thought I should mention that this

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.580 
thought I should mention that this
terrain<00:00:14.370> is<00:00:14.429> not<00:00:14.730> final<00:00:15.240> I<00:00:15.809> have<00:00:16.170> plenty<00:00:16.560> of

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
terrain is not final I have plenty of

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:17.930 
terrain is not final I have plenty of
things<00:00:16.740> to<00:00:16.859> add<00:00:17.010> to<00:00:17.039> the<00:00:17.190> train<00:00:17.430> whether<00:00:17.640> it<00:00:17.820> be

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
things to add to the train whether it be

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.019 
things to add to the train whether it be
ice<00:00:18.630> pieces<00:00:19.289> or<00:00:19.529> more<00:00:19.560> snow<00:00:20.310> hills<00:00:20.580> or<00:00:20.850> even

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
trees and foliage because of the

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.259 
trees and foliage because of the
complexity<00:00:23.400> of<00:00:23.430> these<00:00:23.580> buildings<00:00:23.820> and<00:00:24.210> how
