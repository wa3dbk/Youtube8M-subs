00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:14.290
 hello you channel plants reproach 

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:17.250
 today with you again maxim and elena and we 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:20.410
 talking about planting a coffee tree 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:23.439
 coffee tree seeds come here in 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:27.310
 There are several such packages here. 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:31.300
 I can grope 3 for sure but we all 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:33.430
 we know that the coffee tree is more precisely 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:36.250
 not coffee tree coffee seeds are very 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:38.739
 solid therefore before disembarking 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.870
 it is desirable to dunk them it can be 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:43.239
 either rustic or 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.399
 much better if it is 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:45.820
 a weak solution of sodium humate or humate 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:48.879
 potassium 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:52.719
 soak them at least on the floor of synths for 12 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:55.109
 hours and then planted growing 

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:59.289
 coffee tree fast enough 

00:00:55.109 --> 00:01:01.719
 A bite will appear may already be through 

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:03.220
 one and a half months you will see that your grains 

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:07.510
 long away 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:09.610
 one . but with time through literally 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:12.190
 a few months it will be 2-3 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.790
 leaf and after that the tree starts 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:17.440
 fast enough to grow to 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.800
 form a beautiful crown 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:23.080
 you will need a single sprout which 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:25.450
 gives the seed to cut 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.160
 top so you remove the point 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.890
 growth and plants start 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.060
 oysters agree loose coffee 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:35.520
 looks much better 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:39.940
 than a thin branch with a few leaves 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.830
 water you knew how to land at the coffee 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.710
 the tree can even dry completely 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:47.890
 then revealed watering if the earth 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:49.810
 dried out completely and the coffee was to show you 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.150
 will signal this by the fact that 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:55.900
 put down some foliage after that you 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:59.380
 plenty of water 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:03.670
 water from the pallet needs light to exist 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:05.320
 opinion that in our conditions coffee is blooming 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.960
 many even ask if he will 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.820
 bears fruit when there is meaning blooms 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.850
 coffee tree in our conditions 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:15.340
 somewhere in five or six years but very 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.470
 rarely county literally a few 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.950
 cases it is in greenhouse conditions when 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:23.350
 our coffee in our area blooms if it 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.630
 standing in a regular room that bloom 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:28.030
 you can not wait you will just be very 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:32.260
 beautiful fluffy green tree or 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:35.380
 bush but no flowering it can 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.360
 bloom is not very rich and that's when you 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:40.630
 hear him have a pleasant aroma a little bit 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:43.030
 resembles vani but coffee beans in it 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:45.910
 will not be tied and would hardly drink it 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:50.470
 this coffee but nevertheless the tree itself 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:51.239
 very beautifully put scattered 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.850
 shine 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:57.459
 water moderately and have your coffee 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:00.299
 all will be well all good look 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:00.299
 on sleepers
