00:00:00.339 --> 00:00:05.310
 Hello I'll show you today the plus pattern what does it look like 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.599
 and what you can do with it 

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:14.860
 dpa we hold ten litters so that Transylvania a sentence forward 

00:00:14.859 --> 00:00:16.219
 shows 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:17.850
 and Jens Jens remembers 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:18.900
 first off 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.339
 from IZ knows 

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:22.169
 and above is blue 

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:25.689
 why that's important, there I come to talk - pattern trainers 

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:29.419
 and then we turn the pattern from the measures 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.649
 left up 

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:33.740
 by Meike from trial level 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:35.500
 when it's down 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.500
 the same in court 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.490
 "Then we could use the hot tub once against setbacks are not quite there yet 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:43.450
 so again 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:46.530
 left upwards avoid photo real life left down 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:50.060
 right up but from Trier life 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.420
 right down 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.480
 once with the top 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.290
 that was my equatorial guinea plane 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.290
 could also and once again the couturier's life 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.100
 and it has to be done 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.400
 and here 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.350
 Now comes the endgame that someone has a page 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.590
 do not notice 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.760
 in the beginning was far ahead 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.350
 and blue or 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.920
 in that we will have turned it over again 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.240
 it is here now 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:21.480
 other 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.680
 Pattern all other colors front and top 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:25.549
 this means 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:28.750
 if I just do the pattern again and compare it 

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:32.210
 with what I of course only 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.270
 should have been held in the beginning so in the beginning 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:36.460
 is there 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.680
 OMV expire 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.550
 and then we see 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:42.970
 the 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:44.260
 This is 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:45.840
 this stone 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.620
 still in his position 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:49.730
 and 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:52.730
 Clair opposite rise 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:54.440
 and 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:55.259
 the 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.740
 the remaining 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.080
 cornerstones 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.240
 so to speak 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.259
 at one of these to this stone running diagonal 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:05.450
 through the cube 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.569
 once rotated counterclockwise 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:10.479
 this means 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.119
 this is a checkered pattern for which he confessed 

00:02:17.149 --> 00:02:19.230
 that means what you can remember 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.059
 St if so keep the cube 

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:23.209
 than it will be 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:26.349
 the stone on the top right 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:27.319
 once 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:30.319
 turned counterclockwise 

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:34.529
 that's important if we had to do that out 

00:02:34.529 --> 00:02:36.269
 want to solve 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:38.000
 then if you know 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.850
 the one on the top right then turn once counterclockwise 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.949
 Request with the opposite 

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:45.640
 and he will do it once 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.729
 turned clockwise 

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:51.039
 that means keeping one that way 

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:54.379
 this stone is on the top right 

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:56.369
 and then turn it into a rhythm 

00:02:56.369 --> 00:02:59.939
 then it is turned once again counterclockwise and 

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:02.989
 the whole thing had to be reversed over for solved 

00:03:04.619 --> 00:03:07.859
 but here you can still make something out of it 

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:11.369
 you can swap the normal middle right over us 

00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:15.859
 But you watch out where you're free it's not easy anywhere 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:19.020
 and what do you think 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:20.459
 the edging stones 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:21.939
 in three pages 

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:24.549
 interchanged 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:26.839
 and if we do too 

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:30.089
 swap accordingly with stones 

00:03:30.089 --> 00:03:31.899
 they get years 

00:03:31.899 --> 00:03:34.859
 I also like very nice checked pattern 

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:38.209
 and there is the first time to look carefully 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:40.759
 which means stones should go where 

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:41.799
 we see 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:43.970
 4 are the white curbs 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.419
 turns to Dhaka 

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:50.059
 if I want to check her pattern with these 

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:51.799
 around 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:55.129
 also bring in here by means of stones 

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:58.129
 and the red thing there, the blue one there 

00:03:59.059 --> 00:04:00.859
 we hold the cube like that 

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:02.939
 that these three sides 

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:04.829
 in front and long ago 

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:07.829
 and then do 

00:04:08.649 --> 00:04:11.649
 had to contract in the middle 

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:18.159
 and 10 we have that 

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:21.159
 Check pattern tons 

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:25.030
 that you can do here too you will get this check pattern 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:28.030
 again make the normal check pattern over it 

00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:30.419
 then you get 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:31.930
 a little strange 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.950
 also very nice Andres check pattern 

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:39.599
 because at this check pattern 

00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:42.150
 is on every page 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:46.779
 a color combination that gives software another side of the cube 

00:04:46.779 --> 00:04:49.779
 and that's why I think that's funny too 

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:53.009
 "If you want to do this back now 

00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:54.249
 MuÃŸmann 

00:04:54.249 --> 00:04:57.249
 make out the Caro pattern beforehand 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.210
 and then we are here 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:08.729
 by check pattern 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:11.680
 Per cent where we had to swap that in the middle had to clean 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.300
 and here we have to look again 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.620
 which rents should go where 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:17.349
 so 

00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:21.159
 here then the means stones have to be back in each intersection to that is 

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:23.669
 the house number 

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:25.840
 must be new here in the orange cross 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:29.099
 the yellow must go to the yellow cloister of the King 

00:05:29.099 --> 00:05:33.209
 that is, here we think that is just one side of the three after Roger 

00:05:33.209 --> 00:05:35.650
 one to the front and one to the left 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:37.699
 then do 

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:40.699
 cover up the middle 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:43.729
 and then we have 

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:45.900
 here under + pattern 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.430
 and how we can solve it 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:51.740
 So we will have been able to bring so much standing in the released position 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:55.159
 I already explained we are looking for the stone 

00:05:55.159 --> 00:05:56.159
 cornerstone 

00:05:56.159 --> 00:05:57.380
 the once 

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:59.270
 this is turned clockwise 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:00.689
 he is here 

00:06:00.689 --> 00:06:04.430
 and we think so that this stone is on the top right 

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:06.279
 and then we'll do it again 

00:06:06.279 --> 00:06:09.409
 the algorithm with which you made this pattern 

00:06:10.039 --> 00:06:11.169
 when it's up 

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:13.729
 twice equatorial plane 

00:06:13.729 --> 00:06:15.189
 left down 

00:06:15.189 --> 00:06:18.529
 slightly upwards from Maik Adrian level right down 

00:06:19.159 --> 00:06:21.449
 who turn for once counterclockwise 

00:06:21.449 --> 00:06:24.449
 the whole thing again 

00:06:26.909 --> 00:06:29.229
 and then already raised 

00:06:29.229 --> 00:06:31.369
 twice equatorial guinea level 

00:06:31.369 --> 00:06:34.249
 High Franconia at the Alex Trial level 

00:06:34.249 --> 00:06:35.019
 and there is a lot
