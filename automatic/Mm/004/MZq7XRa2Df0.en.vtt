00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.049 
up very close here between 5 and 2 yeah

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:37.990 
up very close here between 5 and 2 yeah
all<00:01:36.229> the<00:01:36.409> money's<00:01:36.680> for<00:01:36.860> their<00:01:37.009> first<00:01:37.280> two<00:01:37.460> in

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
all the money's for their first two in

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.600 
all the money's for their first two in
the<00:01:38.030> very<00:01:38.270> Mike<00:01:38.540> on<00:01:38.689> Sparta<00:01:39.200> and<00:01:39.409> Swift<00:01:39.740> well

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610 
the very Mike on Sparta and Swift well

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.310 
the very Mike on Sparta and Swift well
then<00:01:40.789> they<00:01:40.939> both<00:01:41.119> face<00:01:41.360> tricky<00:01:41.750> jars<00:01:41.990> here

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
then they both face tricky jars here

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.679 
then they both face tricky jars here
because<00:01:42.759> m2<00:01:43.759> has<00:01:43.970> to<00:01:44.119> clear<00:01:44.299> wound<00:01:44.539> to<00:01:44.659> the

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:44.689 
because m2 has to clear wound to the

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:46.210 
because m2 has to clear wound to the
corner<00:01:45.110> and<00:01:45.320> seeks<00:01:45.590> will<00:01:45.710> be<00:01:45.799> moveable<00:01:46.100> for

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220 
corner and seeks will be moveable for

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.190 
corner and seeks will be moveable for
the<00:01:46.310> rail<00:01:46.460> so<00:01:46.820> I<00:01:47.090> think<00:01:47.570> whichever<00:01:47.990> one<00:01:48.170> of

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
the rail so I think whichever one of

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.330 
the rail so I think whichever one of
them<00:01:48.350> gets<00:01:48.500> the<00:01:48.619> look<00:01:48.770> at<00:01:48.890> the<00:01:48.979> race<00:01:49.100> or

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
them gets the look at the race or

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.850 
them gets the look at the race or
probably<00:01:49.729> win<00:01:49.880> you<00:01:50.840> see<00:01:50.990> any<00:01:51.170> possibility<00:01:51.649> of

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
probably win you see any possibility of

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.520 
probably win you see any possibility of
results<00:01:52.310> apart<00:01:52.820> from<00:01:53.000> you<00:01:53.210> know<00:01:53.240> yeah<00:01:53.840> I<00:01:53.869> can

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
results apart from you know yeah I can

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:55.779 
results apart from you know yeah I can
but<00:01:54.679> I<00:01:54.770> couldn't<00:01:55.070> really<00:01:55.189> figure<00:01:55.429> out<00:01:55.640> which

00:01:55.779 --> 00:01:55.789 
but I couldn't really figure out which

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:57.219 
but I couldn't really figure out which
one<00:01:56.000> was<00:01:56.119> going<00:01:56.240> to<00:01:56.390> give<00:01:56.479> it<00:01:56.570> to<00:01:56.600> me<00:01:56.780> only<00:01:57.079> that

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:57.229 
one was going to give it to me only that

00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:59.139

00:01:59.139 --> 00:01:59.149 
their first two had tough draw so I'm

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:00.609
