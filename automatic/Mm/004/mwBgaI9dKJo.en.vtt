00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:09.370
 so much welcome cuckoo will be namco 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:10.690
 re welcome I should say because I 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:13.000
 wanted to make a video in fact 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:14.740
 for my return on youtube I am 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.509
 sorry to have been absent but how 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.060
 done I had indicated on my page 

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:20.320
 Facebook 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.450
 we'll say it was a little contreras 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.399
 will since I was absent actually 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:28.149
 because I was robbed on the 16th 

00:00:24.399 --> 00:00:28.989
 january and that that burglars in 

00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:33.460
 did take all my material 

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:35.260
 computer photos short everything I was 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.750
 still a little disgusted since 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.190
 I assure you that when you are 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.309
 phone actually circulates the work 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.660
 to tell you sir I'm sorry 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:45.280
 to tell you but you have to enter 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.050
 you've been robbed your friend 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.499
 your door and flowerbeds and 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:52.659
 the apartment wide open that's it 

00:00:50.499 --> 00:00:55.899
 makes a funny effect so has voila 

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:57.730
 when I arrived I had more 

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:59.859
 computer then the camera more 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:02.620
 cameras more than a witness but finally 

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:04.360
 if these he had left me anyway 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.180
 a memory card a mouse that me 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:10.390
 smile, that's the only thing they 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.790
 have left so so so here is especially 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.830
 that it does not happen either when 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.380
 just the day before I had turned four 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.300
 videos that I was actually in the process of 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.950
 get on the computer so go 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:25.180
 obviously he took away the computer with 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:27.100
 the edited videos so voila and I had 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.540
 still because the age and ultimately 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.570
 I still took a computer 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:33.460
 for a camera and I still had the 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.260
 good surprise to discover that in a 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.300
 file under my memory card I 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.190
 still still videos that was 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.500
 stayed so I had to have them 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.600
 goes back and the absence to duration 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.220
 still a little bit because because 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.630
 that I had to buy everything I bought 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.520
 a new camera so you have to 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.050
 to rehab with it's not the same as 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.090
 the former so you have to learn to 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.440
 use 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.790
 I always worked on mac it's 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.110
 the same and this is the computer 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.390
 in fact I did not want to install the 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.830
 updates from haguenau 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.690
 because every time 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.479
 that we install updates must 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.990
 get used to using them to use the 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.869
 new queen 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.610
 the new version of the software is so 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.899
 it's a bit of a hassle I have a little trouble 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:14.970
 so I'm sorry if the first 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:17.820
 videos montages m here is not tip top 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.230
 and for the thumbnails of 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:23.610
 minya on youtube normally I have them 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.989
 did the powerpoint but since the 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.280
 lifts powerpoint in fact it's a 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:28.890
 software that was paying they are 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.410
 taken without joking with and with the 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.850
 license so 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.230
 so here I did not want to buy him back 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:37.080
 so I'm using for the moment a 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.850
 free version of photoshop so I 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.620
 wanted that for 30 days but it's a 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:43.980
 little bit like galley to do the 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.780
 thumbnails so so here I wanted 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.930
 apologize for this absence is for you 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:51.090
 to say that I recognize that there are already six 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.200
 videos in the box so by the way 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.940
 same time as you watch this video 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.830
 there is another who is already in 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.350
 loading so there is a little bit of 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.430
 all there are tutorials the video that 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.630
 I 'm going to charge you actually it's a 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.130
 tutorial with both news 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:05.400
 pallets from sisley so in fact there 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:08.310
 are two tutorials in a video room I 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:11.250
 have you done reviews I'm going 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.760
 certainly if you do a review on 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.140
 ice since 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.879
 I think I still have 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.020
 my absence continue to test 

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:19.880
 products 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:21.770
 via a review on chili to 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.480
 makeup tutorials with pallets 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:26.180
 sisley i did it with the 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:29.120
 electric pallet of urban decay on 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.380
 models of course what am I 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.900
 did I do a review on the funds 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.710
 Chanel complexion 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.330
 I did a cigarette review 

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:36.770
 electronics also because for the 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:39.440
 smokers I think it can be helpful 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:41.090
 a review on the brushes he is well 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.910
 sure the favorites i'm going to talk to you about 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.170
 novelty sisley brief for now 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:47.930
 it's actually the videos they are 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:49.250
 already turned and down like that gives us 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.760
 a little advanced I'll be able to 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:55.430
 do others 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:57.380
 so that's why I've been away 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.840
 I was still present on twitter 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:01.910
 and instagram does a lot more about 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.930
 instagram since I still had my 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:05.060
 laptop 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:06.440
 so if you did not actually know that 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:09.080
 I had an instagram account 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:11.630
 put down there in the video there and 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:13.460
 I let you go see so in 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:14.930
 google i posted you the pictures of 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:15.620
 my new roommate who arrives in 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:17.120

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.410
 roommates or trainees finally brief 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.780

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:22.250
 So here looks like and bah I still have 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:24.260

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:27.560
