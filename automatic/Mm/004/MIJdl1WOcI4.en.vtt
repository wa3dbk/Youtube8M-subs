00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:11.240
 we are in capannori in the province of luca comme il dottor walter alberici head of 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.329
 cabinet of the common good morning alberic doctor 

00:00:14.329 --> 00:00:17.859
 book guidelines to cut costs there is certainly an attempt to 

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:21.539
 bring the consumer closer to the farmer who sells milk 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.470
 uncooked can be a by for the sense initiatives 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:29.109
 all right we have specified this initiative to approach 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:34.920
 the consumers in installments producers therefore the fact that we have near us a 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.030
 how to install with this point we must 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.140
 report and port every morning every evening 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.130
 his milk 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.770
 in this distributor and about 600 people arrive 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:51.420
 some of them with hello-hello other glass bottles 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.850
 in short, the plastic stories and this brings about ten weather 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.140
 cost reduction and also reduction 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.220
 trash 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:02.590
 provide 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:04.650
 when i went this thing 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.320
 short chain of costs reduction and also in the sense of environmental impact 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.260
 regarding the location of these secretarial milk dispensers 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.180
 3 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:15.340
 we see we have us 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.560
 the choice to put this distributor 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.100
 near elementary school 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.180
 okay parents can 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.290
 easy to get close to milk when their children come but 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.050
 if luck is also fairs very close to fort 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.050
 tens of meters is the stable 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.560
 and therefore milk we say in time 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.560
 real as soon as munto is brought 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.300
 unpasteurized raw milk means that it has not been treated 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.029
 exact equipped myth that I am saying trust up to 4 degrees 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.070
 this utility context therefore e 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.070
 the food safety of the product to be guaranteed 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.810
 as regards the organoleptic properties they are maintained 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.150
 and if they are kept in full because I repeat there is no treatment whatsoever 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.920
 alters 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.920
 fat proteins anything else 

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:13.589
 from where it arrives to the milk that supplies distributor directly from his 

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:15.149
 shoulder how 

00:02:15.149 --> 00:02:20.219
 practically I have a goal and mo that twice a day I supply distimo sisters 

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:22.389
 two and three times a day 

00:02:22.389 --> 00:02:26.669
 once at least the milk and honey changed the refrigerator inside the 

00:02:26.669 --> 00:02:29.669
 distributor then the milk found drawing and art history 

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:33.959
 chocolate is certainly the most important thing for this milk 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:37.069
 which finds new distributor 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:41.419
 none of my company as the most important rule for selling 

00:02:41.419 --> 00:02:44.609
 direct is that of the life track of the product 

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:48.299
 therefore re the milk that my client finds the 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:52.609
 re coming only from my company and cannot be prison in other places 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:55.220
 I cleaned up to twice a day 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.300
 is the only vice consulate course treatment is the one there 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.840
 gs then cooled down when cold when there is demand on hand 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.199
 consumers who are not close 

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:06.689
 these are milk 

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:13.239
 I load this lake tanese is a pump load no one has any 5 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:14.989
 Singapore airport 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:15.979
 in the supply
