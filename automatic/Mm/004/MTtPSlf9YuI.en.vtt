hey everyone this is Ross and today and
in<00:00:04.080> the<00:00:04.200> five<00:00:04.380> minute<00:00:04.710> fish<00:00:04.920> facts<00:00:05.250> on

00:00:05.829 --> 00:00:05.839 
in the five minute fish facts on

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:09.410 
in the five minute fish facts on
Cardinal<00:00:06.839> tetras<00:00:07.550> so<00:00:08.550> these<00:00:08.820> are<00:00:09.030> Cardinal

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
Cardinal tetras so these are Cardinal

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.810 
Cardinal tetras so these are Cardinal
tetras<00:00:09.950> another<00:00:10.950> common<00:00:11.219> name<00:00:11.250> for<00:00:11.400> them<00:00:11.670> are

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
tetras another common name for them are

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.490 
tetras another common name for them are
red<00:00:12.719> neon<00:00:13.170> tetras<00:00:14.750> the<00:00:15.750> left<00:00:15.960> for<00:00:16.080> about<00:00:16.199> four

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
red neon tetras the left for about four

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.370 
red neon tetras the left for about four
years<00:00:16.529> in<00:00:16.859> captivity<00:00:17.220> and<00:00:17.640> in<00:00:18.570> the<00:00:18.630> wild<00:00:18.750> only

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
years in captivity and in the wild only

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.599 
years in captivity and in the wild only
usually<00:00:19.590> live<00:00:20.010> about<00:00:20.460> a<00:00:20.670> year<00:00:20.900> and<00:00:22.340> as<00:00:23.340> you<00:00:23.490> can

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
usually live about a year and as you can

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.370 
usually live about a year and as you can
see<00:00:23.789> they've<00:00:24.029> got<00:00:24.180> very<00:00:24.510> bright<00:00:24.810> colors<00:00:25.140> and

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
see they've got very bright colors and

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.560 
see they've got very bright colors and
the<00:00:26.220> reason<00:00:26.519> why<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:26.670> colors<00:00:27.029> are<00:00:27.150> so<00:00:27.300> bright

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
the reason why the colors are so bright

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.910 
the reason why the colors are so bright
is<00:00:28.560> partly<00:00:29.130> because<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.580> diet<00:00:30.199> but<00:00:31.199> also

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
is partly because the diet but also

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.069 
is partly because the diet but also
because<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.579> natural<00:00:32.790> habitat<00:00:33.480> is<00:00:33.690> South

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
because the natural habitat is South

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.500 
because the natural habitat is South
America<00:00:34.649> and<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:35.610> two<00:00:35.820> main<00:00:36.030> rivers<00:00:36.360> that

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
America and the two main rivers that

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.780 
America and the two main rivers that
they<00:00:36.630> come<00:00:36.809> from<00:00:37.050> are<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:37.980> real<00:00:38.219> and<00:00:40.790> Negro

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
they come from are the real and Negro

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.350 
they come from are the real and Negro
and<00:00:42.030> that<00:00:42.629> our<00:00:42.809> uncle<00:00:43.260> rivers<00:00:43.829> and<00:00:44.360> those

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
and that our uncle rivers and those

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.350 
and that our uncle rivers and those
rivers<00:00:45.690> are<00:00:45.870> very<00:00:46.079> dark<00:00:46.410> and<00:00:46.710> murky<00:00:46.890> and<00:00:47.360> the

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
rivers are very dark and murky and the

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.090 
rivers are very dark and murky and the
school<00:00:48.660> and<00:00:48.899> fish<00:00:49.140> suddenly<00:00:49.590> need<00:00:49.770> to<00:00:49.920> see

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
school and fish suddenly need to see

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.709 
school and fish suddenly need to see
each<00:00:50.250> other<00:00:50.550> and<00:00:50.700> that's<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.239> reason<00:00:51.539> why<00:00:51.660> the

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
each other and that's the reason why the

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.410 
each other and that's the reason why the
colors<00:00:52.110> are<00:00:52.289> so<00:00:52.469> bright<00:00:53.030> just<00:00:54.030> because<00:00:54.329> they

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
colors are so bright just because they

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.819 
colors are so bright just because they
need<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:54.629> see<00:00:54.750> each<00:00:54.960> other<00:00:55.350> in<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.469> dark

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
need to see each other in the dark

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.779 
need to see each other in the dark
waters<00:00:56.280> where<00:00:56.579> they<00:00:56.670> come<00:00:56.850> from<00:00:56.879> and<00:00:58.789> the

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
waters where they come from and the

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.060 
waters where they come from and the
small<00:01:00.059> fish<00:01:00.329> they<00:01:00.570> usually<00:01:00.750> stay<00:01:01.469> around<00:01:01.680> five

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
small fish they usually stay around five

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.890 
small fish they usually stay around five
centimeters<00:01:02.760> when<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.059> fully<00:01:03.270> grown<00:01:03.390> and

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
prefer acidic waters from about four to

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.219 
prefer acidic waters from about four to
seven<00:01:12.799> the<00:01:13.799> prefer<00:01:14.220> soft<00:01:15.030> waters<00:01:15.540> of<00:01:15.840> all<00:01:16.080> the

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
seven the prefer soft waters of all the

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
can tolerate hard waters have been

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.460 
can tolerate hard waters have been
probably<00:01:19.320> a<00:01:19.470> climatic<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:21.290> the<00:01:22.290> good

probably a climatic and the good

probably a climatic and the good
community<00:01:22.860> fish

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
community fish

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.730 
community fish
overall<00:01:23.700> they<00:01:23.850> are<00:01:23.880> thin<00:01:24.390> live<00:01:24.600> us<00:01:24.750> so<00:01:25.680> you

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
overall they are thin live us so you

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.050 
overall they are thin live us so you
shouldn't<00:01:26.070> really<00:01:26.220> keep<00:01:26.490> them<00:01:26.670> with<00:01:26.820> things

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
shouldn't really keep them with things

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.109 
shouldn't really keep them with things
like<00:01:27.299> Siamese<00:01:28.170> fighting<00:01:28.350> fish<00:01:28.939> cause<00:01:29.939> the

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
like Siamese fighting fish cause the

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.719 
like Siamese fighting fish cause the
will<00:01:30.329> and<00:01:30.630> if<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.229> fins<00:01:31.470> are<00:01:31.680> then<00:01:31.829> I<00:01:32.070> have

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
will and if the fins are then I have

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.399 
will and if the fins are then I have
been<00:01:32.880> many<00:01:33.119> reports<00:01:33.659> of<00:01:33.750> keeping<00:01:34.140> them<00:01:34.229> with

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
been many reports of keeping them with

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.030 
been many reports of keeping them with
fighting<00:01:34.770> fish<00:01:34.979> and<00:01:35.310> have<00:01:36.150> been<00:01:36.329> fine<00:01:36.659> and<00:01:37.040> but

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
fighting fish and have been fine and but

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.069 
fighting fish and have been fine and but
I<00:01:38.189> personally<00:01:39.090> wouldn't<00:01:39.630> do<00:01:39.750> it<00:01:40.220> and<00:01:41.869> the<00:01:42.869> best

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
I personally wouldn't do it and the best

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.770 
I personally wouldn't do it and the best
in<00:01:43.409> groups<00:01:43.710> of<00:01:43.860> six<00:01:43.920> or<00:01:44.369> more<00:01:44.399> so<00:01:45.390> you<00:01:45.479> should

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
in groups of six or more so you should

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.020 
in groups of six or more so you should
really<00:01:46.049> have<00:01:46.200> about<00:01:46.470> a<00:01:46.710> five<00:01:47.250> to<00:01:47.280> ten<00:01:47.670> gallon

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
really have about a five to ten gallon

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.700 
really have about a five to ten gallon
tank<00:01:48.060> at<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.990> minimum<00:01:49.320> for<00:01:49.680> them<00:01:51.049> but<00:01:52.049> in<00:01:52.259> a<00:01:52.470> 10

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
tank at the minimum for them but in a 10

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.319 
tank at the minimum for them but in a 10
gallon<00:01:52.890> tank<00:01:53.070> you<00:01:53.490> could<00:01:53.640> really<00:01:53.880> get<00:01:54.119> both

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
gallon tank you could really get both

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.550 
gallon tank you could really get both
ten<00:01:54.570> to<00:01:54.720> fifteen<00:01:55.079> Cardinal<00:01:55.590> tetras<00:01:55.950> in<00:01:57.320> if<00:01:58.320> you

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
ten to fifteen Cardinal tetras in if you

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.499 
ten to fifteen Cardinal tetras in if you
give<00:01:58.920> them<00:01:59.009> a<00:01:59.159> little<00:01:59.310> bit<00:01:59.579> corrent<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.329> lucky

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
give them a little bit corrent the lucky

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:01.910 
give them a little bit corrent the lucky
school<00:02:00.960> closer<00:02:01.500> together

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
school closer together

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.100 
school closer together
and<00:02:02.490> this<00:02:02.640> tank<00:02:02.909> is<00:02:03.090> not<00:02:03.240> much<00:02:03.450> current<00:02:03.899> so<00:02:04.049> you

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
and this tank is not much current so you

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.920 
and this tank is not much current so you
can<00:02:04.259> see<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.649> whole<00:02:04.770> spread<00:02:05.100> out<00:02:05.250> and<00:02:05.930> another

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
can see the whole spread out and another

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.419 
can see the whole spread out and another
reason<00:02:07.170> why<00:02:07.409> they're<00:02:07.590> all<00:02:07.710> spread<00:02:08.009> out<00:02:08.250> is

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
reason why they're all spread out is

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.520 
reason why they're all spread out is
because<00:02:09.239> they<00:02:09.539> don't<00:02:09.750> feel<00:02:09.929> threatened<00:02:10.440> at

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
because they don't feel threatened at

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.589 
because they don't feel threatened at
all<00:02:10.700> when<00:02:11.700> they<00:02:11.790> don't<00:02:11.910> feel<00:02:12.150> threatened

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
all when they don't feel threatened

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.880
