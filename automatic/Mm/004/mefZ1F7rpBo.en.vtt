on data telling me how to do these kinds
of<00:00:36.739> things<00:00:36.800> and<00:00:37.160> so<00:00:37.700> I<00:00:37.730> have<00:00:37.940> to<00:00:38.059> figure<00:00:38.239> this

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:38.450 
of things and so I have to figure this

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.530 
of things and so I have to figure this
out<00:00:38.600> for<00:00:38.660> myself<00:00:39.010> for<00:00:40.010> example<00:00:40.070> is<00:00:40.910> this<00:00:41.120> evil

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:41.540 
out for myself for example is this evil

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.100 
out for myself for example is this evil
I<00:00:41.780> have<00:00:42.469> dropped<00:00:43.340> a<00:00:43.520> blob<00:00:43.760> of<00:00:44.090> organic<00:00:44.900> yogurt

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:45.110

from happy self-actualized local cows on

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.650 
from happy self-actualized local cows on
my<00:00:48.110> countertop<00:00:48.440> and<00:00:48.980> I<00:00:49.490> grab<00:00:49.850> a<00:00:50.210> paper<00:00:50.360> towel

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:50.660 
my countertop and I grab a paper towel

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:55.930 
my countertop and I grab a paper towel
and<00:00:50.870> I<00:00:50.900> want<00:00:51.080> to<00:00:51.140> wipe<00:00:51.230> it<00:00:51.350> up<00:00:54.460> the<00:00:55.460> answer<00:00:55.820> to

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
and I want to wipe it up the answer to

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.790 
and I want to wipe it up the answer to
this<00:00:56.090> can<00:00:56.540> be<00:00:56.630> found<00:00:56.810> in<00:00:57.079> embodied<00:00:57.590> energy

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
this can be found in embodied energy

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.830 
this can be found in embodied energy
this<00:00:58.400> is<00:00:58.579> the<00:00:58.730> amount<00:00:58.970> of<00:00:59.150> energy<00:00:59.329> that<00:00:59.780> goes

00:00:59.830 --> 00:00:59.840 
this is the amount of energy that goes

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.110 
this is the amount of energy that goes
into<00:01:00.230> any<00:01:00.470> paper<00:01:00.800> towel<00:01:01.040> or<00:01:01.280> embodied<00:01:01.880> water

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
into any paper towel or embodied water

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.259 
into any paper towel or embodied water
and<00:01:02.600> every<00:01:03.260> time<00:01:03.590> I<00:01:03.890> use<00:01:04.280> a<00:01:04.309> paper<00:01:04.579> towel<00:01:04.879> I<00:01:05.059> am

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:05.269 
and every time I use a paper towel I am

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:07.899 
and every time I use a paper towel I am
using<00:01:05.449> this<00:01:05.810> much<00:01:06.140> virtual<00:01:06.950> energy<00:01:07.579> and<00:01:07.700> water

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:07.909 
using this much virtual energy and water

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:10.630 
using this much virtual energy and water
wipe<00:01:08.479> it<00:01:08.659> up<00:01:08.689> throw<00:01:09.049> it<00:01:09.110> away<00:01:09.290> now<00:01:10.130> if<00:01:10.490> I

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 
wipe it up throw it away now if I

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.630 
wipe it up throw it away now if I
compare<00:01:11.090> that<00:01:11.299> to<00:01:11.570> a<00:01:11.990> cotton<00:01:12.530> towel<00:01:12.710> that<00:01:13.610> I

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
compare that to a cotton towel that I

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.330 
compare that to a cotton towel that I
can<00:01:13.820> use<00:01:13.939> a<00:01:13.970> thousand<00:01:14.540> times<00:01:14.780> I<00:01:15.080> don't<00:01:15.979> have<00:01:16.310> a

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
can use a thousand times I don't have a

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.820 
can use a thousand times I don't have a

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
whole lot of embodied energy until I

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.340 
whole lot of embodied energy until I
wash<00:01:19.070> that<00:01:19.100> yogurty<00:01:19.729> tel<00:01:19.940> this<00:01:20.900> is<00:01:21.140> now

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
wash that yogurty tel this is now

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.160 
wash that yogurty tel this is now
operating<00:01:22.310> energy<00:01:22.729> so<00:01:23.360> if<00:01:23.479> I<00:01:23.600> throw<00:01:23.840> my<00:01:23.960> towel

in<00:01:24.320> the<00:01:24.409> washing<00:01:24.710> machine<00:01:24.979> I've<00:01:25.220> now<00:01:25.490> put

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:25.550 
in the washing machine I've now put

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:28.440 
in the washing machine I've now put

high-efficiency<00:01:31.130> washing<00:01:31.549> machine<00:01:31.850> and<00:01:32.090> then

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
high-efficiency washing machine and then

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.930 
high-efficiency washing machine and then
it<00:01:32.299> looks<00:01:32.540> a<00:01:32.630> little<00:01:32.720> bit<00:01:32.900> better<00:01:33.430> but<00:01:34.430> what

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:34.940 
it looks a little bit better but what

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.420 
it looks a little bit better but what
about<00:01:35.210> a<00:01:35.560> recycled<00:01:36.560> paper<00:01:36.740> towel<00:01:37.010> that<00:01:37.280> comes

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
about a recycled paper towel that comes

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:38.380 
about a recycled paper towel that comes
in<00:01:37.549> those<00:01:37.640> little<00:01:37.790> half<00:01:38.000> sheets

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
in those little half sheets

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.960

well<00:01:38.780> now<00:01:39.140> paper<00:01:39.470> towel<00:01:39.680> looks<00:01:39.920> better<00:01:40.070> the

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 
well now paper towel looks better the

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:42.550 
well now paper towel looks better the
screw<00:01:41.150> the<00:01:41.240> paper<00:01:41.390> towels<00:01:41.630> let's<00:01:42.200> go<00:01:42.409> to<00:01:42.470> a

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
screw the paper towels let's go to a

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.320 
screw the paper towels let's go to a
sponge<00:01:42.799> I<00:01:43.070> wipe<00:01:43.250> it<00:01:43.340> with<00:01:43.549> a<00:01:43.580> sponge<00:01:43.820> and<00:01:44.030> I<00:01:44.150> put

sponge I wipe it with a sponge and I put
it<00:01:44.420> under<00:01:44.510> the<00:01:44.690> running<00:01:44.960> water<00:01:45.110> and<00:01:45.409> I<00:01:45.860> have<00:01:46.010> a

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:46.040 
it under the running water and I have a

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.230 
it under the running water and I have a
lot<00:01:46.190> less<00:01:46.310> energy<00:01:46.670> and<00:01:46.760> a<00:01:46.790> lot<00:01:46.909> more<00:01:46.940> water

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
lot less energy and a lot more water

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.180 
lot less energy and a lot more water
unless<00:01:47.990> you're<00:01:48.170> like<00:01:48.290> me<00:01:48.470> and<00:01:48.710> you<00:01:48.890> leave<00:01:49.070> the

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
when you turn it on and then you start

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.940 
when you turn it on and then you start
to<00:01:53.060> use<00:01:53.150> more<00:01:53.330> energy<00:01:53.450> or<00:01:54.020> worse<00:01:54.260> you<00:01:54.650> let<00:01:54.830> it

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
to use more energy or worse you let it

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.770 
to use more energy or worse you let it
run<00:01:55.100> until<00:01:55.130> it's<00:01:55.520> warm<00:01:55.820> to<00:01:56.299> rinse<00:01:56.450> out<00:01:56.630> your

towel and now all bets are off so

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:04.340 
towel and now all bets are off so
what<00:02:01.380> this<00:02:01.530> says<00:02:01.830> is<00:02:02.340> that<00:02:03.140> sometimes<00:02:04.140> the

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
what this says is that sometimes the

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.650 
what this says is that sometimes the
things<00:02:04.620> that<00:02:04.740> you<00:02:04.860> least<00:02:05.280> expect<00:02:05.820> the

position in which you put the handle

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.400 
position in which you put the handle
have<00:02:08.850> a<00:02:08.880> bigger<00:02:09.180> effect<00:02:09.600> than<00:02:09.690> any<00:02:10.080> of<00:02:10.290> those

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
have a bigger effect than any of those

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.480 
have a bigger effect than any of those
other<00:02:10.619> things<00:02:10.710> that<00:02:11.010> you<00:02:11.100> are<00:02:11.190> trying<00:02:11.430> to

that's what my husband and I are doing
right<00:02:21.480> now<00:02:21.510> and<00:02:22.020> so<00:02:22.710> we<00:02:23.160> wanted<00:02:23.400> to<00:02:23.460> know<00:02:23.580> how

right now and so we wanted to know how

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.700 
right now and so we wanted to know how
green<00:02:24.390> could<00:02:24.630> we<00:02:24.720> be<00:02:24.870> and<00:02:25.050> there's<00:02:25.230> a<00:02:25.320> thousand

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
the energy it takes to make it millions

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.300 
the energy it takes to make it millions

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
and millions of paper towels we wanted

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:48.950 
and millions of paper towels we wanted
to<00:02:47.370> know<00:02:47.460> how<00:02:47.670> much<00:02:47.910> better<00:02:48.150> we<00:02:48.360> could<00:02:48.510> do<00:02:48.690> and

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:48.960 
to know how much better we could do and

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.370 
to know how much better we could do and
so<00:02:49.830> like<00:02:50.520> many<00:02:50.820> people<00:02:51.210> we<00:02:51.360> start<00:02:51.720> with<00:02:52.110> a

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
so like many people we start with a

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.370 
so like many people we start with a
house<00:02:52.620> on<00:02:52.950> a<00:02:52.980> lot<00:02:53.250> and<00:02:53.630> I'm<00:02:54.630> going<00:02:54.840> to<00:02:54.870> show<00:02:55.350> you

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
house on a lot and I'm going to show you

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:56.780 
house on a lot and I'm going to show you
typical<00:02:55.770> construction<00:02:55.950> on<00:02:56.220> the<00:02:56.310> top<00:02:56.490> and<00:02:56.700> what

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
typical construction on the top and what

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.310 
typical construction on the top and what
we're<00:02:56.910> doing<00:02:57.060> on<00:02:57.150> the<00:02:57.240> bottom<00:02:57.480> so<00:02:57.990> first<00:02:58.200> we

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
we're doing on the bottom so first we

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.930 
we're doing on the bottom so first we
demolish<00:02:58.710> it

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
demolish it

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.670 
demolish it
take<00:02:59.940> some<00:03:00.120> energy<00:03:00.210> but<00:03:01.020> if<00:03:01.140> you<00:03:01.230> deconstruct

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
take some energy but if you deconstruct

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.680 
take some energy but if you deconstruct
it<00:03:02.160> you<00:03:02.400> take<00:03:02.580> it<00:03:02.610> all<00:03:02.760> apart<00:03:03.030> you<00:03:03.240> use<00:03:03.510> the

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
it you take it all apart you use the

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.330 
it you take it all apart you use the
bits<00:03:03.870> you<00:03:04.410> can<00:03:04.620> get<00:03:04.740> some<00:03:04.920> of<00:03:05.040> that<00:03:05.070> energy

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
bits you can get some of that energy

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.620 
bits you can get some of that energy
back<00:03:06.230> we<00:03:07.230> then<00:03:07.590> dug<00:03:08.250> a<00:03:08.280> big<00:03:08.490> hole<00:03:08.520> to<00:03:09.300> put<00:03:09.450> in<00:03:09.570> a

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
back we then dug a big hole to put in a

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.150 
back we then dug a big hole to put in a
rainwater<00:03:09.810> catchment<00:03:10.410> tank<00:03:10.590> to<00:03:10.830> take<00:03:10.980> our

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
rainwater catchment tank to take our

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.250 
rainwater catchment tank to take our
yard<00:03:11.370> water<00:03:11.610> independent<00:03:12.209> and<00:03:12.330> then<00:03:12.810> we

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
yard water independent and then we

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.100 
yard water independent and then we
poured<00:03:13.980> a<00:03:14.100> big<00:03:14.340> foundation<00:03:15.180> for<00:03:15.570> passive

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
poured a big foundation for passive

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.010 
poured a big foundation for passive
solar<00:03:16.350> now<00:03:17.040> you<00:03:17.100> can<00:03:17.280> reduce<00:03:17.610> the<00:03:18.060> embodied

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.020 
solar now you can reduce the embodied

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.020 
solar now you can reduce the embodied
energy<00:03:19.110> by<00:03:19.500> about<00:03:19.650> 25<00:03:20.100> percent<00:03:20.459> by<00:03:20.550> using<00:03:20.730> high

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
energy by about 25 percent by using high

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.920 
energy by about 25 percent by using high
fly<00:03:21.360> ash<00:03:21.570> concrete<00:03:22.400> we<00:03:23.400> then<00:03:23.580> put<00:03:23.940> in<00:03:24.209> framing

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
fly ash concrete we then put in framing

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.610 
fly ash concrete we then put in framing
and<00:03:25.260> so<00:03:25.530> this<00:03:25.709> is<00:03:25.950> framing<00:03:26.580> lumber<00:03:27.620> composite

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
and so this is framing lumber composite

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.740 
and so this is framing lumber composite
materials<00:03:29.130> and<00:03:29.370> it's<00:03:29.970> kind<00:03:30.239> of<00:03:30.270> hard<00:03:30.510> to<00:03:30.570> get

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
materials and it's kind of hard to get

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.600 
materials and it's kind of hard to get
the<00:03:30.900> embodied<00:03:31.260> energy<00:03:31.350> out<00:03:31.770> of<00:03:31.950> that<00:03:32.100> but<00:03:32.520> it

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
the embodied energy out of that but it

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.640 
the embodied energy out of that but it
can<00:03:32.790> be<00:03:33.030> a<00:03:33.060> sustainable<00:03:33.840> resource<00:03:34.170> if<00:03:34.410> you<00:03:34.500> use

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
can be a sustainable resource if you use

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.960 
can be a sustainable resource if you use
FSC<00:03:35.250> certified<00:03:35.730> lumber<00:03:37.070> we<00:03:38.070> then<00:03:38.280> go<00:03:38.550> on<00:03:38.580> to

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
FSC certified lumber we then go on to

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.240 
FSC certified lumber we then go on to
the<00:03:39.720> first<00:03:40.020> thing<00:03:40.290> that<00:03:40.320> was<00:03:40.590> very<00:03:40.860> surprising

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
the first thing that was very surprising

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.300 
the first thing that was very surprising
if<00:03:41.850> we<00:03:42.090> put<00:03:42.330> aluminum<00:03:42.870> windows<00:03:43.260> in<00:03:43.860> this<00:03:44.070> house

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
if we put aluminum windows in this house

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.120 
if we put aluminum windows in this house
we<00:03:45.120> would<00:03:45.360> double<00:03:45.810> the<00:03:45.930> energy<00:03:46.050> use<00:03:46.560> right

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
we would double the energy use right

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.240 
we would double the energy use right
there<00:03:47.340> now<00:03:48.209> PVC<00:03:48.930> is<00:03:48.959> a<00:03:49.080> little<00:03:49.350> bit<00:03:49.500> better<00:03:49.709> but

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
there now PVC is a little bit better but

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:51.860 
there now PVC is a little bit better but
still<00:03:50.430> not<00:03:50.760> as<00:03:50.910> good<00:03:51.060> as<00:03:51.270> the<00:03:51.450> wood<00:03:51.600> that<00:03:51.750> we

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
still not as good as the wood that we

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:55.040 
still not as good as the wood that we
chose<00:03:52.220> we<00:03:53.220> then<00:03:53.430> put<00:03:53.760> in<00:03:53.940> plumbing<00:03:54.510> electrical

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.050 
chose we then put in plumbing electrical

constructing this house when there was a

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:04.879 
constructing this house when there was a
house<00:05:02.699> there<00:05:02.729> before<00:05:03.300> and<00:05:03.600> so<00:05:04.350> the<00:05:04.500> question

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:04.889 
house there before and so the question

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:07.879 
house there before and so the question
is<00:05:05.100> how<00:05:05.940> could<00:05:06.240> we<00:05:06.300> make<00:05:06.539> that<00:05:06.750> back<00:05:07.020> and<00:05:07.380> so<00:05:07.800> if

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:07.889 
is how could we make that back and so if

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:09.560 
is how could we make that back and so if
I<00:05:07.949> run<00:05:08.160> my<00:05:08.370> new<00:05:08.580> energy-efficient<00:05:09.419> house

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:09.570 
I run my new energy-efficient house

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:11.990 
I run my new energy-efficient house
forward<00:05:10.169> compared<00:05:10.770> to<00:05:10.860> the<00:05:10.949> old<00:05:11.130> non

00:05:19.939 --> 00:05:19.949 
have upgraded the old house to be more

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:22.580 
have upgraded the old house to be more

00:05:45.469 --> 00:05:45.479 
in a year it's about five times as much

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:47.930 
in a year it's about five times as much
as<00:05:45.750> if<00:05:45.900> I<00:05:45.990> went<00:05:46.139> entirely<00:05:46.470> vegetarian<00:05:46.760> but<00:05:47.760> my

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:47.940 
as if I went entirely vegetarian but my

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:50.320 
as if I went entirely vegetarian but my
elephant<00:05:48.479> in<00:05:48.599> the<00:05:48.659> living<00:05:48.690> room<00:05:49.139> flies

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:50.330 
elephant in the living room flies

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:54.260 
elephant in the living room flies
clearly<00:05:51.330> I<00:05:51.360> need<00:05:51.659> to<00:05:51.780> walk<00:05:51.960> home<00:05:52.289> from<00:05:52.500> Ted<00:05:53.270> but

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:54.270 
clearly I need to walk home from Ted but

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:56.990 
clearly I need to walk home from Ted but
all<00:05:55.260> the<00:05:55.620> calculations<00:05:56.370> for<00:05:56.520> embodied<00:05:56.909> energy

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:57.000 
all the calculations for embodied energy

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.450 
all the calculations for embodied energy
are<00:05:57.330> on<00:05:57.449> the<00:05:57.570> blog<00:05:57.780> and<00:05:58.280> remember<00:05:59.280> it's

00:05:59.450 --> 00:05:59.460 
are on the blog and remember it's

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:00.860 
are on the blog and remember it's
sometimes<00:05:59.909> the<00:06:00.090> things<00:06:00.300> that<00:06:00.389> you<00:06:00.570> are<00:06:00.720> not

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:00.870 
sometimes the things that you are not

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:03.409 
sometimes the things that you are not
expecting<00:06:01.710> to<00:06:02.130> be<00:06:02.310> the<00:06:02.490> biggest<00:06:02.760> changes<00:06:03.360> that

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:03.419 
expecting to be the biggest changes that

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:07.099 
expecting to be the biggest changes that
are<00:06:03.979> thank<00:06:04.979> you
