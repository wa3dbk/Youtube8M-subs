uploaded a video yesterday and released
it<00:00:14.730> about<00:00:15.540> a<00:00:15.780> minecraft<00:00:16.139> center<00:00:17.070> narrator<00:00:17.310> in

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
it about a minecraft center narrator in

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.800 
it about a minecraft center narrator in
1.8<00:00:18.720> and<00:00:19.160> that's<00:00:20.160> why<00:00:20.340> also<00:00:20.640> I'm<00:00:21.060> also<00:00:21.449> in

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
1.8 and that's why also I'm also in

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.750 
1.8 and that's why also I'm also in
snapshot<00:00:22.289> 14<00:00:22.650> W<00:00:22.980> 0-6<00:00:23.789> B<00:00:24.769> so<00:00:25.769> apparently

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
snapshot 14 W 0-6 B so apparently

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.370 
snapshot 14 W 0-6 B so apparently
minecraft<00:00:27.330> and<00:00:27.480> generators<00:00:27.869> are<00:00:27.990> possible

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
minecraft and generators are possible

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.320 
minecraft and generators are possible
again<00:00:28.619> and<00:00:28.800> I<00:00:29.250> think<00:00:29.369> I'm<00:00:29.789> going<00:00:30.000> to<00:00:30.119> show<00:00:30.269> you

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.430 
again and I think I'm going to show you
my<00:00:30.630> version<00:00:30.689> right<00:00:31.380> now<00:00:31.439> so<00:00:32.099> let's<00:00:33.000> start<00:00:33.440> okay

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
my version right now so let's start okay

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.830 
my version right now so let's start okay
so<00:00:34.500> this<00:00:34.950> is<00:00:35.100> my<00:00:35.250> center<00:00:35.550> narrator<00:00:35.850> let's<00:00:36.540> just

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
so this is my center narrator let's just

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.560 
so this is my center narrator let's just
see<00:00:37.079> it<00:00:37.140> in<00:00:37.230> action

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:38.570 
see it in action

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:44.420 
see it in action
it's<00:00:39.570> duping<00:00:40.260> sang<00:00:40.469> pretty<00:00:41.219> quickly<00:00:41.640> and<00:00:43.430> the

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
it's duping sang pretty quickly and the

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.799 
it's duping sang pretty quickly and the
sand<00:00:44.640> is<00:00:44.730> getting<00:00:44.969> collected<00:00:45.239> by<00:00:45.600> these

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
sand is getting collected by these

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.979 
sand is getting collected by these
hoppers<00:00:46.170> below<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.829> half<00:00:47.129> slabs<00:00:47.430> and<00:00:47.809> let<00:00:48.809> end

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
hoppers below the half slabs and let end

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.639 
hoppers below the half slabs and let end
up<00:00:49.170> in<00:00:49.440> those<00:00:49.649> chests<00:00:50.129> over<00:00:50.250> here<00:00:51.079> as<00:00:52.079> you<00:00:52.469> can

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
up in those chests over here as you can

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.010 
up in those chests over here as you can
see<00:00:52.860> it's<00:00:53.190> also<00:00:53.430> pretty<00:00:53.910> quick<00:00:54.360> in<00:00:54.480> my<00:00:54.510> opinion

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
see it's also pretty quick in my opinion

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.090 
see it's also pretty quick in my opinion
so<00:00:55.940> it's<00:00:56.940> actually<00:00:57.149> comparable<00:00:57.719> in<00:00:58.109> its<00:00:58.559> yield

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
so it's actually comparable in its yield

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.200 
so it's actually comparable in its yield
to<00:00:59.820> the<00:00:59.940> old<00:01:00.239> one<00:01:01.079> point<00:01:01.460> one<00:01:02.460> point<00:01:02.609> five<00:01:02.910> I

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
to the old one point one point five I

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.800 
to the old one point one point five I
think<00:01:03.290> sin<00:01:04.290> generators<00:01:05.000> which<00:01:06.000> are<00:01:06.180> awesome

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
think sin generators which are awesome

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.609 
think sin generators which are awesome
to<00:01:07.110> be<00:01:07.140> honest<00:01:07.909> so<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.630> concept<00:01:10.170> is<00:01:10.380> actually

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
to be honest so the concept is actually

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.490 
to be honest so the concept is actually
pretty<00:01:11.189> easy<00:01:11.310> it's<00:01:11.820> over<00:01:12.270> here<00:01:12.540> this<00:01:12.990> one<00:01:13.260> let

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
pretty easy it's over here this one let

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.499 
pretty easy it's over here this one let
me<00:01:13.590> just<00:01:14.280> show<00:01:14.490> you<00:01:14.520> with<00:01:14.820> one<00:01:15.210> of<00:01:15.360> those

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
me just show you with one of those

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.390 
me just show you with one of those
Pistons<00:01:15.990> because<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.619> rest<00:01:16.770> is<00:01:16.860> not<00:01:17.040> very

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
Pistons because the rest is not very

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.800 
Pistons because the rest is not very
necessary<00:01:18.680> so<00:01:19.680> you<00:01:20.040> have<00:01:20.880> one<00:01:21.270> normal<00:01:21.509> piston

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
necessary so you have one normal piston

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.380 
necessary so you have one normal piston
down<00:01:22.170> here<00:01:22.530> one<00:01:23.400> sticky<00:01:23.729> piston<00:01:23.970> on<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.180> side

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
down here one sticky piston on the side

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.880 
down here one sticky piston on the side
and<00:01:24.600> one<00:01:24.840> up<00:01:25.259> here<00:01:25.700> so<00:01:27.470> exemplar<00:01:28.470> is<00:01:28.560> right<00:01:28.770> at

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
and one up here so exemplar is right at

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.300 
and one up here so exemplar is right at
one<00:01:29.600> so<00:01:30.600> when<00:01:31.110> you<00:01:31.200> activate<00:01:31.560> it<00:01:31.710> this<00:01:31.920> piston

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
one so when you activate it this piston

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.109 
one so when you activate it this piston
is<00:01:32.490> pushing<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.000> cent<00:01:33.740> block<00:01:34.740> up<00:01:34.950> this<00:01:35.729> piston

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
is pushing the cent block up this piston

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.380 
is pushing the cent block up this piston
is<00:01:36.180> also<00:01:36.570> pulling<00:01:36.960> it<00:01:37.290> and<00:01:37.670> then<00:01:38.670> it's<00:01:39.060> getting

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
is also pulling it and then it's getting

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.840 
is also pulling it and then it's getting
duped<00:01:39.630> and<00:01:39.930> this<00:01:40.170> piston<00:01:41.100> over<00:01:41.280> there<00:01:41.400> is<00:01:41.549> just

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
duped and this piston over there is just

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.440 
duped and this piston over there is just
pulling<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.750> tubes<00:01:43.049> and<00:01:43.320> block<00:01:43.590> and<00:01:44.450> dropping

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
pulling the tubes and block and dropping

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:46.969 
pulling the tubes and block and dropping
it<00:01:45.659> down<00:01:45.689> here<00:01:46.049> to<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.290> void<00:01:46.439> at<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.680> moment

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
it down here to the void at the moment

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.560 
it down here to the void at the moment
so<00:01:47.820> I<00:01:47.850> don't<00:01:48.149> get<00:01:48.270> any<00:01:48.390> lag<00:01:48.630> and<00:01:50.450> this<00:01:51.450> is

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
so I don't get any lag and this is

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.840 
so I don't get any lag and this is
actually<00:01:51.869> pretty<00:01:52.200> compact<00:01:52.710> only<00:01:53.009> one<00:01:53.579> small

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
actually pretty compact only one small

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.940 
actually pretty compact only one small
thing<00:01:54.060> to<00:01:54.090> notice<00:01:54.420> this<00:01:55.200> can<00:01:55.560> act<00:01:55.829> pretty

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
thing to notice this can act pretty

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.450 
thing to notice this can act pretty
weird<00:01:56.579> which<00:01:57.570> we<00:01:57.719> found<00:01:57.869> out<00:01:58.110> because<00:01:59.009> when

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
weird which we found out because when

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.700 
weird which we found out because when
you<00:01:59.610> power<00:02:00.180> this<00:02:00.570> piston<00:02:00.960> down<00:02:01.110> here<00:02:01.469> over

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
you power this piston down here over

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.980 
you power this piston down here over
here<00:02:02.130> on<00:02:02.340> this<00:02:02.460> block<00:02:02.729> as<00:02:02.850> well<00:02:02.880> look<00:02:03.869> what

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
here on this block as well look what

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.590 
here on this block as well look what
happens<00:02:04.320> now<00:02:06.770> isn't<00:02:07.770> that<00:02:07.799> weird

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
happens now isn't that weird

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.780 
happens now isn't that weird
I<00:02:10.640> think<00:02:11.640> this<00:02:11.790> is<00:02:11.910> just<00:02:12.620> awesome<00:02:13.620> it<00:02:14.400> looks<00:02:14.580> so

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
I think this is just awesome it looks so

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.840 
I think this is just awesome it looks so
funny<00:02:15.060> and<00:02:15.330> it's<00:02:15.600> not<00:02:15.990> doing<00:02:16.200> anything<00:02:16.440> but<00:02:16.850> if

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
funny and it's not doing anything but if

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.770 
funny and it's not doing anything but if
you<00:02:18.060> destroy<00:02:18.360> this<00:02:18.450> block<00:02:18.690> again<00:02:18.990> and<00:02:20.780> restart

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
you destroy this block again and restart

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.160 
you destroy this block again and restart
it<00:02:22.580> it's<00:02:23.580> all<00:02:23.850> working<00:02:24.060> fine<00:02:24.330> again<00:02:24.630> so<00:02:24.840> this

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
it it's all working fine again so this

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.260 
it it's all working fine again so this
is<00:02:25.320> just<00:02:25.650> some<00:02:26.310> sort<00:02:26.490> of<00:02:26.550> strange<00:02:26.940> glitch

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
is just some sort of strange glitch

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.570 
is just some sort of strange glitch
which<00:02:27.510> I<00:02:27.540> find<00:02:27.870> very<00:02:28.080> amusing<00:02:28.860> to<00:02:29.190> be<00:02:29.340> honest

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
which I find very amusing to be honest

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.580 
which I find very amusing to be honest
also<00:02:30.150> one<00:02:30.600> last<00:02:30.630> thing<00:02:31.020> I<00:02:31.110> wanted<00:02:31.380> to<00:02:31.500> add

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
also one last thing I wanted to add

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.610 
also one last thing I wanted to add
before<00:02:31.770> to<00:02:32.430> continue<00:02:32.790> is<00:02:32.990> this<00:02:33.990> over<00:02:34.200> here<00:02:34.230> so

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
before to continue is this over here so

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.860 
before to continue is this over here so
you<00:02:35.370> can<00:02:35.520> not<00:02:35.580> only<00:02:35.640> you<00:02:36.300> up<00:02:36.360> cent<00:02:36.600> you<00:02:36.750> can

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
you can not only you up cent you can

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.090 
you can not only you up cent you can
also<00:02:36.990> do<00:02:37.200> red<00:02:37.680> cent

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
also do red cent

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.800 
also do red cent
and<00:02:38.220> of<00:02:38.610> course<00:02:38.820> gravel<00:02:39.150> because<00:02:39.270> all<00:02:39.660> those

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
and of course gravel because all those

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.620 
and of course gravel because all those
free<00:02:40.080> blocks<00:02:40.350> are<00:02:41.270> gravity<00:02:42.270> affected<00:02:42.780> and<00:02:43.580> in

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
free blocks are gravity affected and in

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.560 
free blocks are gravity affected and in
comparison<00:02:45.630> to<00:02:45.810> anvils<00:02:46.350> and<00:02:46.650> dragon<00:02:47.310> eggs

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.570 
comparison to anvils and dragon eggs

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:49.910 
comparison to anvils and dragon eggs
pistons<00:02:48.570> can<00:02:48.780> actually<00:02:49.080> push<00:02:49.350> them<00:02:49.530> up<00:02:49.650> into

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
pistons can actually push them up into

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.550 
pistons can actually push them up into
the<00:02:50.010> air<00:02:50.130> so<00:02:50.840> that's<00:02:51.840> why<00:02:52.080> it<00:02:52.140> works<00:02:52.320> for<00:02:52.500> all

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
the air so that's why it works for all

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.670 
the air so that's why it works for all
of<00:02:52.680> them<00:02:53.090> also<00:02:54.090> you<00:02:54.390> can<00:02:54.630> see<00:02:54.840> this<00:02:55.110> device<00:02:55.500> is

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
of them also you can see this device is

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.680 
of them also you can see this device is
actually<00:02:55.980> pretty<00:02:56.340> compact<00:02:56.880> and<00:02:57.210> easy<00:02:57.570> to

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
actually pretty compact and easy to

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.810 
actually pretty compact and easy to
build<00:02:57.930> so<00:02:58.200> that's<00:02:58.890> why<00:02:59.010> I'm<00:02:59.070> going<00:02:59.190> to<00:02:59.280> show

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
build so that's why I'm going to show

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.970 
build so that's why I'm going to show
you<00:02:59.880> how<00:03:00.240> to<00:03:00.300> build<00:03:00.510> it<00:03:00.690> right<00:03:00.720> now<00:03:01.140> so<00:03:01.650> let's

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
you how to build it right now so let's

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.640 
you how to build it right now so let's
get<00:03:02.130> started<00:03:02.430> on<00:03:02.520> this<00:03:02.840> okay<00:03:03.840> so<00:03:03.900> now<00:03:04.440> let's

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
get started on this okay so now let's

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:05.570 
get started on this okay so now let's
build<00:03:04.860> this<00:03:04.950> enter<00:03:05.250> ater

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
build this enter ater

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.790 
build this enter ater
so<00:03:06.480> before<00:03:07.050> you're<00:03:07.140> going<00:03:07.230> to<00:03:07.290> do<00:03:07.470> that<00:03:07.590> you

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
so before you're going to do that you

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.070 
so before you're going to do that you
want<00:03:08.010> to<00:03:08.130> of<00:03:08.220> course<00:03:08.280> get<00:03:09.000> some<00:03:09.210> resources<00:03:09.390> for

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
want to of course get some resources for

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.870 
want to of course get some resources for
example<00:03:10.440> some<00:03:10.560> building<00:03:10.920> blocks<00:03:11.160> in<00:03:11.370> this

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
example some building blocks in this

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.390 
example some building blocks in this
case<00:03:12.090> I'm<00:03:12.300> going<00:03:12.480> to<00:03:12.570> use<00:03:12.810> some<00:03:13.190> quartz<00:03:14.190> blocks

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
case I'm going to use some quartz blocks

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.920 
case I'm going to use some quartz blocks
then<00:03:14.640> you<00:03:14.760> want<00:03:14.970> to<00:03:15.030> have<00:03:15.270> some<00:03:16.310> slabs<00:03:17.720> but<00:03:18.720> you

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
then you want to have some slabs but you

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.330 
then you want to have some slabs but you
don't<00:03:19.140> really<00:03:19.260> need<00:03:19.500> that<00:03:19.560> that's<00:03:20.070> not

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
don't really need that that's not

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.060 
don't really need that that's not
necessary<00:03:20.880> you<00:03:21.870> can<00:03:21.900> also<00:03:22.230> use<00:03:22.500> normal<00:03:22.860> blocks

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
necessary you can also use normal blocks

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:26.120 
necessary you can also use normal blocks
for<00:03:23.370> the<00:03:23.490> vertical<00:03:24.090> wiring<00:03:24.710> other<00:03:25.710> than<00:03:25.950> that

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
for the vertical wiring other than that

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.670 
for the vertical wiring other than that
you're<00:03:26.310> going<00:03:26.430> to<00:03:26.580> need<00:03:26.760> some<00:03:27.030> redstone<00:03:27.680> some

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
you're going to need some redstone some

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.220 
you're going to need some redstone some
Pistons<00:03:29.070> sticky<00:03:29.700> pistons<00:03:30.090> hoppers<00:03:31.050> for

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
Pistons sticky pistons hoppers for

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.680 
Pistons sticky pistons hoppers for
automated<00:03:31.830> item<00:03:32.100> collection<00:03:32.580> if<00:03:32.760> you<00:03:33.480> don't

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
automated item collection if you don't

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.180 
automated item collection if you don't
want<00:03:33.930> that<00:03:34.050> you<00:03:34.290> can<00:03:34.470> also<00:03:34.680> have<00:03:34.980> some

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
want that you can also have some

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.060 
want that you can also have some
trapdoors<00:03:35.670> triggering<00:03:36.480> every<00:03:36.780> so<00:03:36.990> often<00:03:37.140> so

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
trapdoors triggering every so often so

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:40.250 
trapdoors triggering every so often so
they<00:03:38.220> break<00:03:38.460> the<00:03:38.610> sand<00:03:38.850> but<00:03:39.180> also<00:03:39.900> that<00:03:40.140> it

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
they break the sand but also that it

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.470 
they break the sand but also that it
through<00:03:40.590> and<00:03:40.950> then<00:03:41.580> you<00:03:41.700> can<00:03:41.850> have<00:03:42.060> some<00:03:42.270> water

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
through and then you can have some water

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.450 
through and then you can have some water
streams<00:03:42.840> to<00:03:43.080> transport<00:03:43.590> the<00:03:43.740> items<00:03:44.070> towards

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:44.460 
streams to transport the items towards

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:46.250 
streams to transport the items towards
you<00:03:44.640> and<00:03:44.880> if<00:03:45.270> you're<00:03:45.450> not<00:03:45.570> there<00:03:45.750> you<00:03:45.870> can<00:03:46.080> also

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
you and if you're not there you can also

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.110 
you and if you're not there you can also
of<00:03:46.710> course<00:03:47.480> put<00:03:48.480> the<00:03:48.630> items<00:03:48.990> into<00:03:49.470> lava<00:03:49.680> or

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
of course put the items into lava or

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.350 
of course put the items into lava or
cactus

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
cactus

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.830 
cactus
so<00:03:52.080> they<00:03:52.350> don't<00:03:52.560> create<00:03:52.830> any<00:03:53.010> lag<00:03:53.660> last<00:03:54.660> but

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
so they don't create any lag last but

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.210 
so they don't create any lag last but
not<00:03:54.900> least<00:03:55.170> you're<00:03:55.380> also<00:03:55.590> going<00:03:55.860> to<00:03:55.950> need<00:03:56.160> some

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
not least you're also going to need some

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.670 
not least you're also going to need some
redstone<00:03:56.550> comparators<00:03:57.240> or<00:03:57.420> want<00:03:58.020> to<00:03:58.110> be<00:03:58.290> exact

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
redstone comparators or want to be exact

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.270 
redstone comparators or want to be exact
a<00:03:58.950> lever<00:03:59.700> or<00:04:00.090> any<00:04:00.390> other<00:04:00.510> way<00:04:00.690> of<00:04:01.100> power<00:04:02.100> a

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
a lever or any other way of power a

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.200 
a lever or any other way of power a
redstone<00:04:02.580> power

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:03.210 
redstone power

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:05.540 
redstone power
for<00:04:04.050> example<00:04:04.410> redstone<00:04:04.710> torch<00:04:04.950> or<00:04:05.160> a<00:04:05.190> block<00:04:05.430> of

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:05.550 
for example redstone torch or a block of

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:08.000 
for example redstone torch or a block of
redstone<00:04:05.900> but<00:04:06.900> I<00:04:07.170> think<00:04:07.620> a<00:04:07.680> liver<00:04:07.860> is<00:04:07.980> the

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
redstone but I think a liver is the

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.490 
redstone but I think a liver is the
easiest<00:04:08.520> way<00:04:08.760> to<00:04:08.970> do<00:04:09.180> it<00:04:09.270> and<00:04:09.480> then<00:04:10.200> what<00:04:10.470> I

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
easiest way to do it and then what I

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.040 
easiest way to do it and then what I
like<00:04:10.560> to<00:04:10.740> use<00:04:11.040> is<00:04:11.250> a<00:04:11.280> redstone<00:04:11.610> lamp<00:04:12.030> just<00:04:12.900> to

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:13.050 
like to use is a redstone lamp just to

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:15.440 
like to use is a redstone lamp just to
show<00:04:13.260> that<00:04:13.290> the<00:04:13.620> system<00:04:13.950> is<00:04:14.040> on<00:04:14.250> so<00:04:14.820> now<00:04:15.030> let's

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
show that the system is on so now let's

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:18.260 
show that the system is on so now let's
get<00:04:15.600> started<00:04:16.100> okay<00:04:17.100> so<00:04:17.130> to<00:04:17.609> begin<00:04:17.760> with<00:04:18.030> you're

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:18.270 
get started okay so to begin with you're

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:21.000 
get started okay so to begin with you're
going<00:04:18.299> to<00:04:18.540> want<00:04:18.660> to<00:04:18.989> place<00:04:19.350> down<00:04:19.590> some<00:04:19.979> Pistons

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.010 
going to want to place down some Pistons

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:24.480 
going to want to place down some Pistons
facing<00:04:21.550> upwards<00:04:21.910> I'm<00:04:22.120> just<00:04:22.450> gonna<00:04:22.950> do<00:04:23.950> the<00:04:24.100> six

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490 
facing upwards I'm just gonna do the six

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.820 
facing upwards I'm just gonna do the six
wide<00:04:24.760> system<00:04:25.000> now<00:04:25.300> because<00:04:25.510> I<00:04:26.170> think<00:04:26.290> that's<00:04:26.620> a

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
wide system now because I think that's a

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:28.980 
wide system now because I think that's a
quite<00:04:27.130> decent<00:04:27.370> amount<00:04:27.850> of<00:04:28.090> scent<00:04:28.780> that<00:04:28.870> you

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
quite decent amount of scent that you

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:30.990 
quite decent amount of scent that you
get<00:04:29.140> after<00:04:29.290> a<00:04:29.440> while<00:04:29.560> then<00:04:30.490> what<00:04:30.700> you<00:04:30.790> want<00:04:30.970> to

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
get after a while then what you want to

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.930 
get after a while then what you want to
do<00:04:31.150> is<00:04:31.390> build<00:04:32.230> up<00:04:32.350> four<00:04:32.710> blocks<00:04:32.860> like<00:04:33.760> this

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:33.940 
do is build up four blocks like this

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.320 
do is build up four blocks like this
destroy<00:04:34.450> the<00:04:34.570> law<00:04:34.690> of<00:04:34.780> free<00:04:34.960> blocks<00:04:35.200> and<00:04:36.330> place

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
destroy the law of free blocks and place

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:38.790 
destroy the law of free blocks and place
down<00:04:37.510> sticky<00:04:37.870> piston<00:04:38.140> against<00:04:38.440> this<00:04:38.590> block

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 
down sticky piston against this block

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.750 
down sticky piston against this block
then<00:04:39.370> extend<00:04:40.210> this<00:04:40.620> over<00:04:41.620> all<00:04:41.770> the<00:04:42.010> other<00:04:42.130> six

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:42.760 
then extend this over all the other six

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:46.110 
then extend this over all the other six
blocks<00:04:43.030> so<00:04:44.070> your<00:04:45.070> four<00:04:45.280> sticky<00:04:45.520> piston<00:04:45.790> above

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.120 
blocks so your four sticky piston above

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.360 
blocks so your four sticky piston above
each<00:04:46.390> normal<00:04:47.020> piston<00:04:47.290> then<00:04:47.920> it<00:04:48.010> can<00:04:48.160> destroy

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:48.370 
each normal piston then it can destroy

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:51.000 
each normal piston then it can destroy
this<00:04:48.490> block<00:04:48.730> again<00:04:49.000> then<00:04:49.960> you<00:04:50.080> want<00:04:50.290> to<00:04:50.380> fight

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.010 
this block again then you want to fight

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:52.800 
this block again then you want to fight
some<00:04:51.160> blocks<00:04:51.340> like<00:04:51.550> this<00:04:51.730> so<00:04:52.510> we<00:04:52.600> have<00:04:52.690> some

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:52.810 
some blocks like this so we have some

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:56.760 
some blocks like this so we have some
sort<00:04:52.930> of<00:04:53.080> two<00:04:53.440> wide<00:04:53.680> walkway<00:04:54.420> go<00:04:55.420> on<00:04:55.540> all<00:04:55.770> next

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:56.770 
sort of two wide walkway go on all next

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:58.850 
sort of two wide walkway go on all next
to<00:04:56.920> the<00:04:56.980> Pistons<00:04:57.310> hope<00:04:58.270> I<00:04:58.390> said<00:04:58.480> that<00:04:58.540> right

00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:58.860 
to the Pistons hope I said that right

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:02.100 
to the Pistons hope I said that right
what<00:04:59.860> you<00:05:00.010> do<00:05:00.130> want<00:05:00.520> to<00:05:00.640> do<00:05:00.790> next<00:05:00.970> then<00:05:01.180> is<00:05:01.390> spam

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.110 
what you do want to do next then is spam

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:04.440 
what you do want to do next then is spam
redstone<00:05:02.500> on<00:05:02.710> top<00:05:02.770> of<00:05:03.040> this<00:05:03.130> walkway<00:05:03.450> just

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:04.450 
redstone on top of this walkway just

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:07.590 
redstone on top of this walkway just
like<00:05:04.570> this<00:05:05.040> take<00:05:06.040> some<00:05:06.220> sticky<00:05:06.460> pistons<00:05:06.820> faced

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:07.600 
like this take some sticky pistons faced

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.740 
like this take some sticky pistons faced
at<00:05:07.930> the<00:05:08.640> second<00:05:09.640> block<00:05:09.820> or<00:05:10.360> look<00:05:10.570> at<00:05:10.660> the

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:10.750 
at the second block or look at the

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:12.630 
at the second block or look at the
second<00:05:11.230> block<00:05:11.380> and<00:05:11.590> place

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:12.640 
second block and place

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:16.260 
second block and place
sticky<00:05:13.420> pistons<00:05:13.720> like<00:05:13.900> this<00:05:14.160> so<00:05:15.160> they<00:05:15.340> Pistons

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:16.270 
sticky pistons like this so they Pistons

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:19.500 
sticky pistons like this so they Pistons
face<00:05:16.480> into<00:05:16.690> this<00:05:16.810> direction<00:05:18.390> after<00:05:19.390> you're

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:19.510 
face into this direction after you're

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:22.860 
face into this direction after you're
done<00:05:19.600> with<00:05:19.810> that<00:05:20.280> you<00:05:21.280> just<00:05:21.490> want<00:05:21.670> to<00:05:21.810> build<00:05:22.810> a

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:22.870 
done with that you just want to build a

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:24.510 
done with that you just want to build a
line<00:05:23.050> of<00:05:23.140> redstone<00:05:23.350> over<00:05:23.770> here<00:05:23.980> on<00:05:24.220> top<00:05:24.400> of

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:24.520 
line of redstone over here on top of

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:25.590 
line of redstone over here on top of
building<00:05:24.820> blocks<00:05:25.000> of<00:05:25.090> course

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:25.600 
building blocks of course

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:29.280 
building blocks of course
so<00:05:25.900> those<00:05:26.110> Pistons<00:05:26.470> get<00:05:26.680> powered<00:05:26.980> as<00:05:27.070> well<00:05:28.290> and

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:29.290 
so those Pistons get powered as well and

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:32.040 
so those Pistons get powered as well and
then<00:05:30.090> actually<00:05:31.090> almost<00:05:31.270> done<00:05:31.630> we're<00:05:31.990> almost

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:32.050 
then actually almost done we're almost

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:34.650 
then actually almost done we're almost
done<00:05:32.410> already<00:05:32.710> I<00:05:32.740> think<00:05:32.800> I<00:05:33.250> just<00:05:34.180> want<00:05:34.510> to<00:05:34.570> do

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:34.660 
done already I think I just want to do

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:38.460 
done already I think I just want to do
something<00:05:34.960> like<00:05:35.020> this<00:05:36.630> so<00:05:37.630> you<00:05:37.660> can<00:05:37.780> power

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:38.470 
something like this so you can power

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:40.980 
something like this so you can power
your<00:05:38.590> system<00:05:38.970> put<00:05:39.970> the<00:05:40.150> comparator<00:05:40.960> and

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:40.990 
your system put the comparator and

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:45.830 
your system put the comparator and
subtraction<00:05:41.620> mode<00:05:42.030> connect<00:05:43.030> it<00:05:43.150> to<00:05:43.270> here<00:05:44.490> then

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:45.840 
subtraction mode connect it to here then

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.240 
subtraction mode connect it to here then
what<00:05:46.840> I<00:05:46.870> like<00:05:47.110> to<00:05:47.260> do<00:05:47.380> is<00:05:47.500> something<00:05:47.830> like<00:05:47.920> this

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:48.250 
what I like to do is something like this

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:57.500 
what I like to do is something like this
I<00:05:52.950> hate<00:05:53.950> placing<00:05:54.790> enough<00:05:55.000> two<00:05:55.120> slabs<00:05:56.430> and

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:57.510 
I hate placing enough two slabs and

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:59.940 
I hate placing enough two slabs and
something<00:05:58.510> like<00:05:58.540> this<00:05:58.780> and<00:05:59.020> now<00:05:59.830> you're

00:05:59.940 --> 00:05:59.950 
something like this and now you're

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:01.610 
something like this and now you're
already<00:06:00.190> done<00:06:00.430> and<00:06:00.730> you<00:06:00.940> can<00:06:01.180> put<00:06:01.480> your

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:01.620 
already done and you can put your

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:04.920 
already done and you can put your
cloneable<00:06:02.620> items<00:06:03.070> or<00:06:03.250> you<00:06:03.340> do<00:06:03.520> pible<00:06:03.930> locks

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:04.930 
cloneable items or you do pible locks

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:08.610 
cloneable items or you do pible locks
over<00:06:05.410> here<00:06:06.360> the<00:06:07.360> only<00:06:07.600> thing<00:06:07.780> that<00:06:07.930> you<00:06:08.080> might

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:08.620 
over here the only thing that you might

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:11.340 
over here the only thing that you might
want<00:06:08.680> to<00:06:09.270> build<00:06:10.270> before<00:06:10.480> is<00:06:10.840> of<00:06:10.960> course<00:06:11.200> the

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:11.350 
want to build before is of course the

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:13.500 
want to build before is of course the
item<00:06:11.590> collection<00:06:11.740> so<00:06:12.670> what<00:06:13.060> you<00:06:13.180> could<00:06:13.360> do

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:13.510 
item collection so what you could do

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:17.130 
item collection so what you could do
there<00:06:13.870> is<00:06:14.460> some<00:06:15.460> hoppers<00:06:15.790> as<00:06:16.060> I<00:06:16.090> did<00:06:16.510> back

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:17.140 
there is some hoppers as I did back

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:19.440 
there is some hoppers as I did back
there<00:06:17.350> on<00:06:17.470> my<00:06:17.590> example<00:06:18.130> just<00:06:19.060> like<00:06:19.210> this

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:19.450 
there on my example just like this

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:22.200 
there on my example just like this
facing<00:06:20.380> two<00:06:20.500> chests<00:06:20.770> that<00:06:20.830> you<00:06:21.040> would<00:06:21.220> place

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:22.210 
facing two chests that you would place
