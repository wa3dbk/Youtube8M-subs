is the drop in P 60 module they make a
few<00:01:24.630> different<00:01:24.780> LEDs<00:01:25.770> that<00:01:26.100> you<00:01:26.340> could<00:01:26.490> buy

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
few different LEDs that you could buy

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:33.679 
few different LEDs that you could buy
this<00:01:27.509> one<00:01:27.720> right<00:01:27.810> here<00:01:28.020> is<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:29.159> XML<00:01:30.170> LED<00:01:32.689> so

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
this one right here is the XML LED so

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.480 
this one right here is the XML LED so
let's<00:01:33.840> put<00:01:34.079> this<00:01:34.170> thing<00:01:34.320> together<00:01:34.500> so<00:01:34.860> you

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
let's put this thing together so you

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:46.819 
let's put this thing together so you
drop<00:01:35.700> in<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:35.939> module<00:01:44.329> it's<00:01:45.329> got<00:01:45.509> a<00:01:45.540> nice<00:01:45.829> tight

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
drop in the module it's got a nice tight

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.690 
drop in the module it's got a nice tight
screw<00:01:47.790> so<00:01:48.720> here<00:01:48.869> I'm<00:01:48.990> running<00:01:49.290> a<00:01:49.439> 18<00:01:50.250> 650

this<00:02:44.879> LED<00:02:45.360> has<00:02:45.630> five<00:02:46.380> modes<00:02:46.680> so<00:02:47.579> this<00:02:47.700> is<00:02:47.819> a<00:02:47.849> max

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
this LED has five modes so this is a max

quick review I'll do another review in a

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:34.220 
quick review I'll do another review in a
few<00:03:33.090> days<00:03:33.269> I'm<00:03:33.690> just<00:03:33.750> trying<00:03:33.989> to<00:03:34.019> show<00:03:34.200> you

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
few days I'm just trying to show you

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.759 
few days I'm just trying to show you
guys<00:03:35.060> but<00:03:36.060> price-wise<00:03:36.750> this<00:03:37.380> whole<00:03:37.530> thing<00:03:37.739> you

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
guys but price-wise this whole thing you

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:42.220 
guys but price-wise this whole thing you
can<00:03:37.920> get<00:03:38.130> for<00:03:38.310> about<00:03:38.340> under<00:03:38.819> 50<00:03:39.120> bucks<00:03:39.150> shipped

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:46.039 

so<00:03:43.230> if<00:03:43.919> this<00:03:44.370> if<00:03:44.790> this<00:03:44.940> had<00:03:45.180> a<00:03:45.209> momentary

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:46.049 
so if this if this had a momentary

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:47.900 
so if this if this had a momentary
activation<00:03:46.680> this<00:03:47.370> would<00:03:47.519> actually<00:03:47.639> be<00:03:47.849> a

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
activation this would actually be a

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.210 
activation this would actually be a
really<00:03:48.180> really<00:03:48.389> good<00:03:48.540> light<00:03:48.840> but<00:03:49.590> either<00:03:50.040> than

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
really really good light but either than

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.250 
really really good light but either than
that<00:03:50.340> it's<00:03:50.609> actually<00:03:50.940> pretty<00:03:51.269> sweet<00:03:51.480> very

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
that it's actually pretty sweet very

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.339 
that it's actually pretty sweet very
happy<00:03:52.500> with<00:03:52.620> it<00:03:52.769> very<00:03:53.010> impressed<00:03:54.349> impressed

00:03:55.339 --> 00:03:55.349 
happy with it very impressed impressed

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:58.120 
happy with it very impressed impressed
with<00:03:55.950> the<00:03:56.040> drop<00:03:56.250> in<00:03:56.430> the<00:03:57.060> brightness

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.130 
with the drop in the brightness

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:02.449 
with the drop in the brightness
brightness<00:03:59.130> color<00:03:59.900> of<00:04:00.900> the<00:04:01.049> LED<00:04:01.380> has<00:04:02.040> a<00:04:02.069> smooth

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
brightness color of the LED has a smooth

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:04.640 
brightness color of the LED has a smooth
reflector<00:04:02.940> and<00:04:03.180> I<00:04:03.959> think<00:04:04.200> you'll<00:04:04.319> get<00:04:04.440> some

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
reflector and I think you'll get some

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.589 
reflector and I think you'll get some
pretty<00:04:04.799> good<00:04:05.040> throw<00:04:05.819> and<00:04:05.849> spill<00:04:06.239> out<00:04:06.359> of<00:04:06.480> this

00:04:06.589 --> 00:04:06.599 
pretty good throw and spill out of this

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:11.810 
pretty good throw and spill out of this
light<00:04:07.639> alright<00:04:08.690> see<00:04:09.690> ya
