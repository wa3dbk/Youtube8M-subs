00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:10.349
 but all good today we are going to talk about 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:12.900
 720 team and a box in a 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.679
 beginning there were people who at 314 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.679
 order 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:25.619
 which is the name of the project to do 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:28.320
 this is 4 is what this tumor says 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:32.420
 I accept it because they see me square is a 1 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:35.130
 2 3 is a 4 but good we go by parties 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:38.040
 playstation 4 features and then 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:42.270
 we will say accessories features was 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:46.020
 a processor of other cores to about 6 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:50.489
 gigahertz will have 4 ram percentage 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:52.980
 that will use the equipment will be at 3.70 follow 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:56.190
 vice what will you use for the games and the 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.440
 30 remaining good the 300 of memory 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.600
 remaining for the processor equipment at 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:05.820
 system and so on 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:10.830
 will have USB 3.0 flash ports and will include 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:13.520
 direct x11 point 1 initially as 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.520
 you are also seeing 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.330
 you are seeing that they are changing 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.220
 they subtracted what was the story of 33 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.530
 and it turns voters who gives a 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.259
 dynamic change to playstation what is 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.179
 the interface since it comes no longer lower 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.890
 the new generation of consoles and you 

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:36.600
 shop a new air well 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.890
 making modifications and others in 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.850
 patches and so on 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:44.550
 good to root is also the famous 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.130
 workshop dual show what can we say about 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:49.649
 it will have an aspect of the psp 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.640
 vita of sight behind has as an area 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:57.520
 tactile in which we can also 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.520
 in playing the specific game 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.630
 also what will it have with the front area 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:05.300
 that extends the tactile dualshock in 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.760
 screen is today very futuristic but 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:09.289
 well who knows we 're here in 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.390
 something like the wii to make competition 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.820
 if he only gets to do anything for 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:16.490
 have something respective and have good of the 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:18.080
 the ventilation will be more coolant 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:20.720
 since the last teams that have 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:23.239
 removed carries dissipaters and deficits before 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.280
 and so they have done super pro and 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:27.170
 turns out to be that that team that breaks us 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.489
 the life of these perfected 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.220
 what I want to do new things 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:32.780
 generation is the same have seen that they can 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.330
 perfect in this are four 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.950
 they will consume less energy even less 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.450
 that the new the link that they have taken from 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.880
 what will happen is that the processors 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:44.480
 about the capital 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:47.870
 said this past description and we're going to 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:51.350
 xbox 720 features and processors 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:54.650
 at first it will come with 1.6 giants 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:56.900
 of processor and 4 gigas of ram that 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.850
 will use two for games and two for 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.940
 systems 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:04.250
 but good but eye on a website says that 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:07.880
 Microsoft will bet on two points of the 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:10.310
 gigahertz processor and 8 gb true 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:13.010
 which of the 7 will be used for several 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:15.830
 games does not matter a bit more and I'm not 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:18.080
 from microsoft but for me this affects 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.370
 decrease is a bit wilder in what 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.680
 that is equipment are not simply 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:24.080
 things that are are more technical from my 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:29.570
 point of view is there the thing and 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:33.980
 will come with direct x11 point 1 11.2 and 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:37.130
 will come 3.0 usb compounds and enter a 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:40.850
 auxiliary that will be 2.0 flash I do not know how much 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:43.120
 some of those law and good ventilation the 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:47.810
 ventilation will also come with 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:49.190
 performance of people in that apart from 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:51.440
 the reduction of because it has also 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:54.500
 got igor peak consumption further 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:57.230
 has seen both shopping centers the 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:59.300
 new team elite is 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.730
 perfected not of the air system in 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:02.410
 refinement and good want to apply that 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:06.260
 system 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:07.430
 a thing of generation 720 and it turns out to be 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:12.110
 who have got it 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:15.380
 that says it's going to be bestial but good 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:17.930
 this is another thing the destination 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:20.239
 it's going to be very good there's going to be 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:22.430
 performance problems and that is going to be 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:24.320
 will last three hours and will only do 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:26.330
 it is necessary to let it rest a quarter of 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:29.780
 time for having put the ventilation that 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:32.530
 he has rumors very always say guys 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:34.930
 regarding the joysticks the joysticks 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:43.010
 they do not speak anymore to load me in angola 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:47.120
 integrated lack of equipment forms 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:49.040
 that they put it in the second if it was in 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:51.470
 red the second is it marked him as 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:54.200
 He was charged the battery that's good 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:56.450
 eliminated has been removed and passed as in 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:59.260
 play 3 

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:59.260
 the box 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:06.770
 they improve more truth with blu-ray reader 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:08.720
 and I guess it will not be solo 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:12.530
 unprecedented and ground player to ride 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:16.130
 they like this and comment they comment that 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:19.850
 will come with a hard drive st disk 

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:22.040
 soft those discs really are 

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:24.710
 they are like this but called mind they last very 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:27.350
 little they are called in the disc of the devil 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:29.000
 in quotes because it lasted a little and 

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:31.400
 they are very fast reading speed 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.560
 of the disc is super fast but they have 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:35.470
 much less time because it does not 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:37.970
 it is a disk is like a ring of 

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:40.759
 exaggerated micro yes but big 

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:43.710
 for those for the mind 

00:05:40.759 --> 00:05:46.199
 rumors but good and the things I'm in 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:47.759
 what is known at the moment 

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:49.650
 meanings leaves them behind two 

00:05:47.759 --> 00:05:51.870
 machines here in successes but it has 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:55.400
 liked this video a strong greeting and 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:55.400
 see you next up guys
