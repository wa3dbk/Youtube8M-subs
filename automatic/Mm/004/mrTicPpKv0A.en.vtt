00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
storyline and as you can see from the

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.190 
storyline and as you can see from the
huge<00:01:14.970> scale<00:01:15.299> of<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.540> dungeon<00:01:15.869> there's<00:01:16.140> a

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
huge scale of the dungeon there's a

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.780 
huge scale of the dungeon there's a
whole<00:01:16.350> lot<00:01:16.530> to<00:01:16.560> explore<00:01:17.040> in<00:01:17.159> uncover<00:01:17.520> and

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
whole lot to explore in uncover and

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.760 
whole lot to explore in uncover and
what's<00:01:18.689> interesting<00:01:18.960> is<00:01:19.259> that<00:01:19.380> as<00:01:19.590> you

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
what's interesting is that as you

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.440 
what's interesting is that as you
complete<00:01:20.009> sections<00:01:20.460> of<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.670> main<00:01:20.820> quest<00:01:21.119> the

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
complete sections of the main quest the

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.820 
complete sections of the main quest the
NPC's<00:01:21.900> from<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.140> city<00:01:22.320> will<00:01:22.530> start<00:01:22.740> to

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
NPC's from the city will start to

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.590 
NPC's from the city will start to
inhabit<00:01:23.070> and<00:01:23.369> create<00:01:23.640> bases<00:01:24.000> under<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.390> tower

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
inhabit and create bases under the tower

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.899 
inhabit and create bases under the tower
so<00:01:25.470> they'll<00:01:25.680> probably<00:01:25.830> some<00:01:26.400> clashes<00:01:26.580> between

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
so they'll probably some clashes between

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.490

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
the quest there's still a lot to be done

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.270

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
but progress is definitely being made
