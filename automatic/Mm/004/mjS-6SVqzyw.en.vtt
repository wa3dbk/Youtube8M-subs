00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:06.590
 among all guys today will do you good like 

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:07.820
 turn on a light bulb like these with 

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:10.759
 these batteries 

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:16.309
 so what we need we need three 

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:21.050
 half twists in a light bulb holder 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:27.199
 light bulb a nail of the size that 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:30.349
 then you want a screwdriver and two wires 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:33.410
 electric 50 cm 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:36.230
 so what do we start doing everything 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:41.330
 take the barrel door is the 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:46.280
 bulb n was a lot we put it 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:51.290
 inside then we see 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:54.650
 the two sons of 50 cm and we draw 5 cm 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:01:00.400
 from the beginning and even this to the end 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:01:04.610
 way and then we come in now what we do 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:07.460
 take this box of clothes cm 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:10.310
 parallel and 3 cm always so 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:14.420
 parallel and possibly with one 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.140
 depth of 4 cm then now what 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.900
 let's make 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:20.930
 let's take these three half- turns and 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:28.880
 put behind in this box 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:34.070
 yes 2 and 3 way 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:36.909
 look at what we do forge one 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.909
 part is known 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:44.299
 we take the nail and we put it is like that 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:46.159
 we turn the electric wire because the 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:50.210
 nail acts as a switch 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:50.720
 once done that we put in the 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.009
 nail 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:57.369
 start to magic 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:59.580
 and then end the year with a 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:01:59.580
 screwdriver 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:22.840
 until it touches precisely from the battle 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:27.700
 unfortunately, here we are guys like this 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:33.959
 okay he touches her touches the 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:54.720
 battery that we have until then though 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:03:03.329
 wait a minute ago as you've already said 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:07.859
 see the tip must touch now 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:11.380
 take the other end of the wire 

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:15.220
 eder lamp holder we put it in 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:22.870
 the first hole in this way is the turci 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:24.359
 so I call the second we always do 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:31.480
 the same thing 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:35.980
 let's take it into the hole like this e 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:38.230
 the twine is here done guys 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:43.629
 now what we have to do we have to spend 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:48.569
 this tip is being able to put where 

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:51.239
 there is this cocoon of the pina Ã¨ 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:53.140
 automatically with electricity 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:57.160
 corporate light bulb 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:59.099
 look at him here guys then 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:03.340
 guys for this video tutorial today 

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:06.340
 defined by dx cool to start by saying something 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:08.860
 I am not a scientist but I am 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:12.269
 therefore do these experiments at 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.269
 assumes guys hello
