00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
in Florida or elsewhere because there's

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.730

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
too much time away from the business it

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.180 
too much time away from the business it

close<00:01:17.860> to<00:01:18.250> here<00:01:18.490> but<00:01:19.030> even<00:01:19.390> if<00:01:19.480> the<00:01:19.600> show<00:01:19.780> is

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810 
close to here but even if the show is

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.450 
close to here but even if the show is
located<00:01:20.320> elsewhere<00:01:20.470> it's<00:01:20.980> still<00:01:21.130> going<00:01:21.280> to<00:01:21.340> be

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
located elsewhere it's still going to be

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.610 
located elsewhere it's still going to be
much<00:01:22.210> cheaper<00:01:22.240> to<00:01:22.780> do<00:01:23.020> a<00:01:23.050> show<00:01:23.290> like<00:01:23.320> this
