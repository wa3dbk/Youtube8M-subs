00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:18.290 
you'll definitely need a thong or
something<00:02:15.030> of<00:02:15.390> that<00:02:16.010> criteria<00:02:17.010> why<00:02:17.940> I<00:02:17.970> really

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
something of that criteria why I really

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.790 
something of that criteria why I really
liked<00:02:18.510> about<00:02:18.660> this<00:02:18.990> was<00:02:19.530> that<00:02:19.860> the<00:02:20.700> sides<00:02:21.800> have

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
liked about this was that the sides have

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:28.070 
liked about this was that the sides have
a<00:02:23.190> larger<00:02:24.180> black<00:02:24.480> stripe<00:02:25.310> so<00:02:26.750> basically<00:02:27.750> it

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
a larger black stripe so basically it

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.750 
a larger black stripe so basically it
conceals<00:02:29.420> excessive<00:02:30.420> hit<00:02:30.870> or<00:02:31.110> just<00:02:31.800> it<00:02:32.370> slims

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
conceals excessive hit or just it slims

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.310 
conceals excessive hit or just it slims
down<00:02:32.850> your<00:02:33.120> hips<00:02:33.330> and<00:02:33.540> because<00:02:33.900> it's<00:02:34.140> vertical

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
down your hips and because it's vertical

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.020 
down your hips and because it's vertical
lines<00:02:34.740> it<00:02:34.950> slims<00:02:35.190> down<00:02:35.280> your<00:02:35.550> body<00:02:35.670> in<00:02:35.880> general

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
lines it slims down your body in general

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.850 
lines it slims down your body in general
so<00:02:36.750> I<00:02:36.780> don't<00:02:36.900> know<00:02:36.959> if<00:02:37.020> you<00:02:37.110> can<00:02:37.200> see<00:02:37.380> that<00:02:37.590> but

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
so I don't know if you can see that but

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.420 
so I don't know if you can see that but
the<00:02:38.070> black<00:02:38.400> on<00:02:38.700> the<00:02:38.850> side<00:02:39.060> is<00:02:39.540> a<00:02:39.870> lot<00:02:40.110> thicker

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
the black on the side is a lot thicker

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.310 
the black on the side is a lot thicker
than<00:02:41.430> it<00:02:41.730> is<00:02:41.880> in<00:02:42.120> any<00:02:42.330> other<00:02:42.540> area<00:02:42.630> of<00:02:42.959> the

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
than it is in any other area of the

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.979 
than it is in any other area of the
skirt<00:02:43.590> forever<00:02:44.040> 21<00:02:44.220> cardigan<00:02:45.120> and<00:02:45.450> it<00:02:45.780> was

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
skirt forever 21 cardigan and it was

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:49.009 
skirt forever 21 cardigan and it was
thirty-five<00:02:46.680> dollars<00:02:47.060> but<00:02:48.060> it<00:02:48.420> was<00:02:48.600> fifty

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
thirty-five dollars but it was fifty

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:51.620 
thirty-five dollars but it was fifty
percent<00:02:49.350> off<00:02:49.530> and<00:02:49.860> it's<00:02:50.250> just<00:02:50.390> got<00:02:51.390> this

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
percent off and it's just got this

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.470 
percent off and it's just got this
really<00:02:52.019> bright<00:02:52.590> yellow<00:02:53.160> and<00:02:53.580> I<00:02:53.820> think<00:02:54.060> that<00:02:54.300> if

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
really bright yellow and I think that if

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.380 
really bright yellow and I think that if
you're<00:02:54.600> anything<00:02:54.840> like<00:02:54.989> me<00:02:55.140> I'm<00:02:55.620> so<00:02:56.280> not<00:02:56.880> used

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
you're anything like me I'm so not used

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.479 
you're anything like me I'm so not used
to<00:02:57.570> wearing<00:02:57.660> colorful<00:02:58.470> things<00:02:58.709> like<00:02:59.040> I<00:02:59.160> wear<00:02:59.459> a

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
to wearing colorful things like I wear a

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:01.430 
to wearing colorful things like I wear a
lot<00:02:59.610> of<00:02:59.820> black<00:03:00.090> I<00:03:00.330> love<00:03:00.360> black<00:03:00.989> and<00:03:01.050> like

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
lot of black I love black and like

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.330 
lot of black I love black and like
solids<00:03:01.950> and<00:03:02.130> neutrals<00:03:02.660> um<00:03:03.660> but<00:03:04.110> I'm<00:03:04.800> trying<00:03:05.220> to

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
solids and neutrals um but I'm trying to

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:06.920 
solids and neutrals um but I'm trying to
branch<00:03:05.550> out<00:03:05.730> of<00:03:05.880> that<00:03:06.030> and<00:03:06.300> I<00:03:06.450> think<00:03:06.480> that<00:03:06.810> this

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
branch out of that and I think that this

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.660 
branch out of that and I think that this
is<00:03:06.989> a<00:03:07.110> really<00:03:07.560> easy<00:03:07.739> way<00:03:08.010> to<00:03:08.070> branch<00:03:08.370> out<00:03:08.550> if

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
is a really easy way to branch out if

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.130 
is a really easy way to branch out if
this<00:03:08.760> can<00:03:08.970> be<00:03:09.060> matched<00:03:09.269> with<00:03:09.450> so<00:03:09.750> many<00:03:09.840> things

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
this can be matched with so many things

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:11.750 
this can be matched with so many things
is<00:03:10.440> it's<00:03:10.590> just<00:03:10.830> basically<00:03:11.160> your<00:03:11.340> standard

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
is it's just basically your standard

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.390 
is it's just basically your standard
cardigan<00:03:12.239> but<00:03:12.780> it's<00:03:12.959> got<00:03:13.230> that<00:03:13.680> really<00:03:14.040> bright

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
cardigan but it's got that really bright

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.390 
cardigan but it's got that really bright
yellow<00:03:14.790> and<00:03:15.090> it's<00:03:15.570> a<00:03:15.930> pattern<00:03:16.799> that<00:03:16.980> has<00:03:17.160> a

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
yellow and it's a pattern that has a

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.370 
yellow and it's a pattern that has a
neutral<00:03:17.700> in<00:03:18.030> it<00:03:18.180> so<00:03:18.480> that<00:03:18.660> you<00:03:18.810> would<00:03:19.170> feel

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
neutral in it so that you would feel

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.650 
neutral in it so that you would feel
more<00:03:19.620> comfortable<00:03:19.680> wearing<00:03:20.400> it<00:03:20.519> then<00:03:20.790> you
