00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
server I've been playing on it ever

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.880 
server I've been playing on it ever
since<00:00:21.060> I<00:00:21.570> think<00:00:22.050> was<00:00:22.140> like<00:00:22.260> one<00:00:22.500> point<00:00:22.740> two

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
since I think was like one point two

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.310 
since I think was like one point two
point<00:00:23.100> three<00:00:23.269> so<00:00:24.830> basically<00:00:25.970> the<00:00:27.109> you<00:00:28.109> may

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
point three so basically the you may

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.439 
point three so basically the you may
need<00:00:28.680> one<00:00:29.010> hundred<00:00:29.580> percent<00:00:29.609> sure<00:00:29.849> but<00:00:30.300> you

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
need one hundred percent sure but you

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.380 
need one hundred percent sure but you
may<00:00:30.750> need<00:00:31.019> mineshafter<00:00:31.890> for<00:00:32.040> this<00:00:32.189> so<00:00:33.059> you<00:00:33.120> may

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390
