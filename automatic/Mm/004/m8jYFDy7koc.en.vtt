00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:07.380
 the teacher mirta 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:18.930
 a project of something that is very modern 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:32.769
 but I guess it's not exactly the 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:35.170
 most important day well then we go 

00:00:32.769 --> 00:00:36.820
 to make the face with clear clear and 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.180
 let's do the hand what I wanted in 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.930
 this case what I covered was a little stamp 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.480
 then I did it in three dimensions 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.160
 so that people can see what 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.440
 cute can you end things after 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.510
 see how the caritas improvise towards 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.700
 hand I wanted to show how the 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.800
 mold on the cat and all the rest of the 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.989
 project that we can not do today 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.329
 burning or in a matter of time is 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:01.590
 in the decoration magazine of all that 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:01.590
 they are learning to decorate 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:09.250
 normal thanks good let's start 

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:12.070
 explain how the molds are used 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:14.409
 in this case it is a resin mold for 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.909
 use with fondant then 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:18.970
 what I'm going to do is I'm going to take a 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:22.780
 little bit of hydrogenated butter I'm going to 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:24.549
 place inside the mold is just the 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.570
 dim use between the fingertips and I'll 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:28.729
 To place 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.409
 and not only inside the mold but 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:32.780
 also on the edges because when 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:34.820
 you take out the pasta inside the 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.740
 mold what happens is that they stick 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.780
 in all this sector then that's why it's 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:42.080
 that I 'm going to have a good time I'm going to increase 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:45.860
 well not in excess is simply a 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:48.710
 thin layer there is once I have this I'm going 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:52.190
 to take the pasta that of course if 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:54.200
 using paste to model what 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.800
 I did it was coloring the with coloring is 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.960
 skin color those of flavor 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.060
 once I have made the ball what 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.460
 I'm going to perform is going to make a point 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:06.220
 this little ball closing the palms of 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.560
 hands I will make the tip well 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.990
 well finite then once I have 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.760
 this tip made this tip is what 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:15.160
 that I'm going to place inside the nose there 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.550
 then I will press with the yolks 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.550
 of the fingers 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.200
 pressed 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.890
 I'm going to take the whole mass to a 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.920
 side stand 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:31.709
 and I'm going to leave all this dough for me 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:34.110
 can remove it from the mold in this way 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:36.630
 and then what I'm going to do now with 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:39.120
 one is here everything is bad mass I follow 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:42.300
 taking it this way so that I can 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.410
 have in my hand the doll the face of 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.540
 the doll without problem and what I'm going to 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.680
 to do is I'm just going to open a 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.330
 little do I have to raise a 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.910
 My little lip that's what I did 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:53.160
 in that little face now that I do I'm going to 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.830
 place it on its side and with scissors 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:58.500
 I'm going to cut off all the surplus because 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:00.270
 What I did in this little doll was 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.680
 nothing more than half of the face was 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:05.870
 this what I did if there 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.689
 that we have to let it dry for 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.830
 then use inside the cake as 

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:12.930
 we make a hand 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:15.690
 they see that the most important thing is very easy 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:18.210
 is to try to wet the mold well 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:20.730
 connects with shortening with lard 

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:23.580
 vegetable the hydrogenated butter we make 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:26.940
 a ball of that little ball we make a 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:29.100
 nice that nice let's put here a 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.650
 little bit of starch the circle I can 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.000
 place a little bag will go back to 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.620
 make a bigger hand so that all 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.750
 they can see what it looks like to see 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.250
 how it is done with this part of the 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.890
 hand that is the most mochilite part is the 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:43.320
 that I'm going to press to make a 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:45.060
 tear then with the aesthetics the 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:48.740
 parking aesthetics what I'm going to do 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:50.510
 I'm going to mark the finger on the thumb 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:53.840
 look at this it's like it's a number 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:56.810
 one or the other but a short bird then 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:59.390
 I'm going to round you 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:01.040
 in this way the hand you have in that 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:03.200
 the thumb is always forward 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.180
 so what I'm going to do with one this 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:08.420
 removes is to take a little thumb towards 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:11.540
 forward I will draw all the edges 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:13.880
 I have and then what I'm going to do is 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:16.769
 I'm going to mark the fingers then first 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:21.419
 I have to mark half yes 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:22.800
 then he marked half and half then 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:24.960
 with this here what I'm going to do 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.960
 from the outside in to round 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:30.960
 a little bit your fingers there then there 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.930
 I can model them and what I do is I can 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:35.190
 lift your finger 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:40.080
 thus 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:42.629
 so that the hand is well done 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:45.630
 now if I want I can mark a 

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:47.730
 little bit more the doll 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:50.220
 to give it a little more movement in 

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:52.050
 the case that I want to make the hand and 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.120
 make the days a little open with 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.740
 a scissor can I cut all the 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.450
 partcita is here of the fingers and 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.920
 mark it more so that I stay with the 

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:00.660
 little fingers more open but in this case in 

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:02.670
 particular what I did was 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:04.560
 directly the little hands that are more 

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:07.020
 well closed if I have to do the 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:09.480
 cane cited the cane he quoted simply 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:12.350
 it's something very simple you are going to do 

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:12.350
 a cylinder 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:18.860
 let's do this way you what 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:21.120
 can perform 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:23.220
 let's do like this 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.830
 let's try to do it all the more 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:27.170
 small 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:30.710
 we can make it in modeling paste 

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:31.850
 or else in pill g here what 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:34.400
 I'm doing a little bit bigger for 

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:36.590
 that all of you can see it 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:39.860
 once we have it done what 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:42.050
 we are going to fold in this way we are going to 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:45.350
 let it dry and there we have the cane 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:48.169
 cited to be able to do this if I 

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:50.539
 I want to make all the twigs that 

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:53.750
 have on the side we're just going to 

00:05:50.539 --> 00:05:56.120
 do this I'm going to take a bit of 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:57.680
 mass always remember that what 

00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:00.070
 we have to do is knead it well for 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:03.310
 remove all cracks 

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:05.650
 we are going to press well on the hands and 

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:10.500
 what I'm going to do is also a 

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:10.500
 cylinder I'm going to make a little tip 

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:16.889
 to imagine that we are doing the 

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:19.169
 twigs in this way 

00:06:16.889 --> 00:06:21.060
 remember that you are this mass 

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:23.699
 can perform with time and prepare it 

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:24.499
 the day that we are going to make the cake and 

00:06:23.699 --> 00:06:28.150
 what we are going to do is mark 

00:06:24.499 --> 00:06:32.070
 simply the little ones of the trunk 

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:32.070
 that we are going to mark it in this way 

00:06:32.249 --> 00:06:36.689
 then in this way what are we going to 

00:06:34.049 --> 00:06:39.080
 do on the cake 

00:06:36.689 --> 00:06:39.080
 there 

00:06:39.179 --> 00:06:42.179
 we mark 

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:46.890
 thus 

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:48.960
 if you are the day you are working 

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:51.210
 it is a day that is very dry what they are going to 

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:52.370
 Spreads do is go a little ESTE 

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:55.100
 here 

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:56.300
 with the hydrogenated butter then of 

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:59.479
 that way what we're going to do is 

00:06:56.300 --> 00:07:01.090
 mark without sticking absolutely in 

00:06:59.479 --> 00:07:04.400
 the stake or any tool 

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:06.710
 then in this way there we can 

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:08.870
 mark see different trunks with 

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:11.090
 different ways this I can cut 

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:13.880
 here and I'm inserting one over the other 

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:16.490
 It is a simple and easy way to power 

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:19.610
 make a little stick do all the 

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:21.830
 trunks the face and the hand I wait 

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:23.300
 that this could have understood this well 

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:24.440
 which is very simple to do if it is 

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:26.570
 simple 

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:31.970
 but fundamental to be able to put together a 

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:36.130
 cake is that if we do not know if this is 

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:36.130
 exactly in one day we can 

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:42.729
 thank you very much thanks to valleys of the 

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:42.729
 next until next time
