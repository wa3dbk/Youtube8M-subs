00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:18.980
 I like this focaccia because you go there 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:21.880
 but you know we are now alone 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.880
 add a little oil 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:34.000
 the olive oil produced is ours 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.000

 here is our dough is almost ready 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:47.720
 now we just have to work a little on 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:50.690
 plan and it is the phrase that I like most 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:59.740
 will come as he sold him beautiful bone but 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:03:01.990
 100 arm strength yes yes yes yes 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.430
 if you want what we do call 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:05.560
 balanced we remember that we are 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.690
 message we eat oil and put it 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:12.130
 rest in toto until until london 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:14.230
 double everything, never dirty or clean hands 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:25.480
 politics naples team and i come back to 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:27.880
 dough and leave it to the fathers that 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.480
 use up to right doubling me 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.290
 I recommend 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.290
 cover no 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.750
 well then after the dough has 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:51.910
 doubled in a bowl at last 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:55.690
 we can go about doing it but it is teaching 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:57.250
 seen the all in key in Puglia 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:00.280
 Have you ever seen a ride? 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:05.280
 yes but mother walks of wine process 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:07.500
 without that even the edges easily 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.930
 or the edges left her a little edge 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:12.720
 taller 20 stands widens the flat 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:15.150
 number where higher that will hold the 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.220
 our common burden yes yes in this 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.180
 perfect way but very well fine 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.100
 so 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:23.370
 now let grow again must 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:26.930
 recover the leavening and then the con 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.930
 via manara of forio 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.830
 here is our ready vocation 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:35.310
 to be stuffed then recapitulating 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:37.530
 some time it took after 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:39.509
 having made the dough and unfair place 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:43.139
 in avoiding being a dough with 

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:46.080
 mother yeast needs pampering and there 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:48.409
 will take an average of 6 hours to double 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:51.900
 once it turned over in an extended pan 

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:53.789
 we recover the lost request 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.229
 leaving her to avoid for another 

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:57.629
 horror and a half and finally now 

00:04:55.229 --> 00:05:00.379
 we can stuff with tomatoes start at 

00:04:57.629 --> 00:05:00.379
 cut yourself free 

00:05:00.569 --> 00:05:07.069
 then I remove that the petiole incido 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:07.069
 with the knife 

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:13.830
 open the tomato towards the plate 

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:15.300
 otherwise it gets dirty and I take all the 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:18.210
 seeds 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:21.110
 if you like them you can also keep them 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:23.340
 I'm going to compose almost a mosaic 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:24.379
 cover entire surface of the focaccia 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:27.120
 with all the tomatoes 

00:05:24.379 --> 00:05:30.449
 obviously the inside of the tomato 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:32.150
 but let the humidity towards the focaccia 

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:36.180
 of the tomato will protect it from cooking 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:42.449
 and will leave a superficial part of the 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:45.409
 almost creamy white moist but 

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:47.690
 what a scent these tomatoes have 

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:51.479
 heavenly that put olives 

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:53.460
 here they are, you are very kind but I will 

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:55.289
 I put the salt we always say 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:56.490
 I make a joke, he loves to plug me 

00:05:55.289 --> 00:05:58.990
 holes on which we left his 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:03.220
 colors we put them 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:04.600
 if I could do the stylist in the dough 

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:05.950
 look what a beautiful muffin we have 

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:07.540
 finally ready for the oven too 

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:09.580
 because everything always use 

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:11.560
 yes if you want to eat from your 

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:13.960
 lawyer forgets the lawyer this yes 

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:15.760
 Apparently called the cake but we can 

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:18.990
 see informed that says yes I would say that 

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:18.990
 then running 

00:06:35.259 --> 00:06:39.110
 finally from the hunting state is ready is 

00:06:37.669 --> 00:06:44.419
 finally we can also eat it 

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:45.679
 would also now be a fan is true e 

00:06:44.419 --> 00:06:47.869
 really good this focaccia 

00:06:45.679 --> 00:06:49.339
 yes yes you know my favorite of 

00:06:47.869 --> 00:06:50.179
 he eats focaccia from Bari at breakfast 

00:06:49.339 --> 00:06:52.039
 lunch and dinner 

00:06:50.179 --> 00:06:54.349
 you just have to say goodbye from the village 

00:06:52.039 --> 00:06:56.599
 san marco fasano from two steps from the sea 

00:06:54.349 --> 00:07:00.009
 among the millennial and non- olive trees 

00:06:56.599 --> 00:07:00.009
 forget to smile always
