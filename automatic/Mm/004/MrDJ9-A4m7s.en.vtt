00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 hello this is a channel about plumbing me 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:08.269
 name is Artem and today I will tell what is 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:10.590
 check valve and what is it for 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:12.900
 check valve is a device which 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.759
 prevents water from flowing back 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.920
 side by pipeline speaking by others 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.869
 words if installed on the pipeline 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.000
 check valve then water can't 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.350
 independently or under pressure leave 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.260
 back to the pipeline 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.000
 from which she came most often 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.980
 check valve plumbing system 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.500
 installed with pumping stations with 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.300
 pumps in front of the boiler after the counters 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.579
 either eccentrics some in 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.070
 mixers thanks to this one 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.710
 device installed on the pump 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.450
 in the well or well after switching on 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.550
 pump you can almost immediately 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.320
 get water with this connection you 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.270
 don't have to wait for the water to come out 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.700
 tap after turning on the pump if before 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.469
 this system has already been filled that is 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.350
 water just can't go away on its own 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.850
 back to the well or well 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.859
 set after the counter reverse 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.899
 the valve prevents the counter from rotating in 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.920
 back side but most importantly he 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.080
 prevents 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.080
 the effect of crushing what is it 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.939
 look in the next issue reverse 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.100
 valve and installed on the water 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.110
 cold water water heater if you 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.299
 live in a house that is connected to 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.070
 central water supply and you 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.320
 apartment will have installed the heater 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.330
 check valve is required 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.580
 also in the hot water riser 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:27.479
 otherwise you can all heated 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:29.280
 water pour riser well neighbors in the usual 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.140
 non-working position check valve 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.200
 always locked shutter propped up 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.780
 spring check valve and come with 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.280
 metal shutter like this or with 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.869
 plastic with metal shutter 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.240
 check valve and applied in systems 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.799
 heating to open the valve with 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.960
 metal membrane required 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.509
 some more effort or pressure 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.520
 water than opening the valve with plastic 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.250
 membrane this should be remembered when 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.840
 build a new water system 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.310
 especially relevant for pumps and 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.290
 pumping stations which are located 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.700
 well or well would be useful 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.110
 find out that the valve is metal 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.159
 the gate is longer than the valve with 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.320
 plastic shutter 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.329
 In this case I have a valve with a diameter of 1 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.459
 inch for example if you take the valve 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:10.140
 diameter one second inch and put 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.290
 them together with a plastic shutter valve 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.090
 will be shorter by one centimeter 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.620
 keep this in mind if you are going to 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.569
 finished mounted system 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.000
 replace the already existing reverse 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:22.189
 valve when installing a check valve 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.620
 note that on the valve body 

00:02:22.189 --> 00:02:27.620
 there is an arrow an arrow points in 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.879
 What direction should go to the water you need 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.409
 listen then you can lower this 

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:31.879
 The place here is a small software that is 

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:34.159
 body about finger crossing nile parts 

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:35.180
 usually different hourly wall 

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:36.620
 gets out about fetish 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.329
 accordingly if you have to 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.280
 ever disassemble existing 

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:41.750
 system or just change the reverse 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.299
 valve try to unscrew the valve 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.260
 taking this place if you start 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:47.540
 unscrew the valve 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.730
 for this place there is a possibility that 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.139
 this place the valve can get loose then 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.760
 there he will just figure it out and then you 

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:55.400
 you still have to take on these facets 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.319
 ready system it often happens but if 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.180
 try to disassemble the valve just 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:00.919
 on his own when he is nowhere 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.200
 curled up then it gets pretty 

00:03:00.919 --> 00:03:05.329
 problematic therefore for example i 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.900
 disassembled valve smaller with plastic 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:07.549
 membrane 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.220
 well, I didn't have the strength for this valve 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:12.639
 I even take this valve apart for a long time. 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.639
 spun up 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:21.829
 here it is a female external thread 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:26.239
 here are his two parts about what I said 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:28.310
 that is, it consists of two parts 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:30.949
 such valve there further we have 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:33.590
 spring and membrane valve itself or 

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:38.359
 shutter like it is correctly called i don't 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:40.900
 I know disassemble the shutter here you can see everything 

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:40.900
 its components 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.599
 notice that here is a big one 

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:47.250
 we have a metal membrane valve 

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:49.980
 we have plastic here 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.599
 but in any case tightness 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.060
 achieved using rubber 

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:55.829
 pads and here with the help of this gum 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:59.489
 tightness is achieved here what 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:04:01.620
 here the cup itself is made of 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:04.859
 metal and spring respectively more 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:06.659
 tough there is quite a small reverse 

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:09.359
 valve and which is inserted inside 

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:11.219
 half a meter on the counter it can be quite 

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:13.790
 useful if not the place where 

00:04:11.219 --> 00:04:16.199
 insert separate check valve 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:18.570
 there is a very small check valve 

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:22.229
 and which are put on the output in the case 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:25.380
 the counter itself and here they are quite 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:26.970
 small check valves which 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:29.070
 certainly not eligible for 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:31.710
 existence here we have a counter 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:34.770
 old counter this check valve 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:36.870
 put on the output and counter one 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:38.250
 sides yes he saves time but on the other 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:40.680
 sides he is so big 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:43.160
 resistance that is just under weak 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:48.229
 pressure you can stop going water 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:52.490
 here are its components very tight gum 

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:52.490
 Well, three details of the case 

00:04:54.969 --> 00:05:00.939
 it is from this that our inverse consists 

00:04:57.159 --> 00:05:03.029
 valves more photos and 

00:05:00.939 --> 00:05:05.559
 varieties of different check valves 

00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:08.049
 See the link under the video in my 

00:05:05.559 --> 00:05:11.039
 blog on this all with you was artem up 

00:05:08.049 --> 00:05:11.039
 see you soon
