want to set it up you want to put the

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.880 
want to set it up you want to put the
left<00:02:20.200> safe<00:02:21.270> on<00:02:22.270> the<00:02:22.570> ground<00:02:22.810> and<00:02:23.110> the<00:02:23.710> right

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
left safe on the ground and the right

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:29.400 
left safe on the ground and the right
safe<00:02:24.330> just<00:02:25.330> on<00:02:25.630> the<00:02:26.010> very<00:02:27.010> bottom<00:02:27.600> laser<00:02:28.600> deal

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
safe just on the very bottom laser deal

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.270 
safe just on the very bottom laser deal
over<00:02:29.830> there<00:02:30.690> and<00:02:31.690> then<00:02:31.900> to<00:02:32.710> get<00:02:32.860> them<00:02:32.980> both<00:02:33.100> to

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
over there and then to get them both to

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.600 
over there and then to get them both to
float<00:02:33.520> up<00:02:33.670> and<00:02:33.910> it<00:02:34.480> should<00:02:35.220> knock<00:02:36.220> out<00:02:36.370> both<00:02:36.550> of

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
float up and it should knock out both of

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.070 
float up and it should knock out both of
those<00:02:36.820> beams<00:02:37.090> at<00:02:37.330> once<00:02:38.100> tada

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
those beams at once tada

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.060 
those beams at once tada
and<00:02:41.080> then<00:02:41.200> this<00:02:41.290> last<00:02:41.440> one<00:02:41.590> you<00:02:41.770> can<00:02:41.800> just

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070 
and then this last one you can just

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.720 
and then this last one you can just
throw<00:02:42.610> right<00:02:43.090> there<00:02:43.560> and<00:02:44.560> that's<00:02:45.250> it<00:02:45.370> you're

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
throw right there and that's it you're

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:45.900 
throw right there and that's it you're
done

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
done

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.560 
done
this<00:02:46.240> one<00:02:46.420> was<00:02:46.570> really<00:02:47.080> easy<00:02:48.390> but<00:02:49.390> if<00:02:49.510> I

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
this one was really easy but if I

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.930 
this one was really easy but if I
remember<00:02:49.780> right<00:02:50.050> the<00:02:50.200> next<00:02:50.350> one<00:02:50.470> is<00:02:50.800> not<00:02:51.580> quite

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
remember right the next one is not quite

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.730 
remember right the next one is not quite
so<00:02:52.060> easy<00:02:52.380> so<00:02:53.400> see<00:02:54.400> y'all<00:02:54.550> then
