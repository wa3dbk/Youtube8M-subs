have been asking me recently that
they're<00:00:24.199> there<00:00:25.100> RC<00:00:25.760> vehicle<00:00:26.300> as<00:00:26.590> in<00:00:27.590> fact<00:00:27.860> gone

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:28.190 
they're there RC vehicle as in fact gone

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:31.269 
they're there RC vehicle as in fact gone
two<00:00:28.820> wheel<00:00:29.119> drive<00:00:29.150> or<00:00:30.080> three<00:00:30.410> wheel<00:00:30.619> drive<00:00:30.949> and

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:31.279 
two wheel drive or three wheel drive and

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:34.000 
two wheel drive or three wheel drive and
i<00:00:32.210> think<00:00:32.570> i<00:00:32.660> had<00:00:32.840> one<00:00:33.140> comment<00:00:33.620> saying<00:00:33.830> that

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.010 
i think i had one comment saying that

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.400 
i think i had one comment saying that
their<00:00:34.160> trial<00:00:34.460> could<00:00:34.670> got<00:00:34.879> one<00:00:35.150> will<00:00:35.809> drive<00:00:36.140> as

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:36.410 
their trial could got one will drive as

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.189 
their trial could got one will drive as
well<00:00:36.610> anyway<00:00:37.610> this<00:00:37.850> is<00:00:38.090> just<00:00:38.120> a<00:00:38.449> short<00:00:38.480> video

00:00:39.189 --> 00:00:39.199 
well anyway this is just a short video

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:44.139 
well anyway this is just a short video
on<00:00:39.410> why<00:00:39.920> your<00:00:40.520> RC<00:00:41.239> vehicle<00:00:41.899> might<00:00:42.640> not<00:00:43.640> be

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:44.149 
on why your RC vehicle might not be

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:48.549 
on why your RC vehicle might not be
using<00:00:44.690> its<00:00:45.290> four-wheel<00:00:46.010> drive<00:00:46.460> system<00:00:46.489> i<00:00:47.559> am

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:48.559 
using its four-wheel drive system i am

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:52.150 
using its four-wheel drive system i am
going<00:00:48.890> to<00:00:48.950> start<00:00:49.190> off<00:00:49.309> by<00:00:49.370> saying<00:00:49.579> that<00:00:50.829> if<00:00:51.829> you

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 
going to start off by saying that if you

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.580 
going to start off by saying that if you
notice<00:00:52.610> that<00:00:52.640> your<00:00:52.940> full<00:00:53.600> drive<00:00:53.930> system<00:00:54.440> isn't

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:54.590 
notice that your full drive system isn't

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:58.750 
notice that your full drive system isn't
working<00:00:54.879> when<00:00:55.879> the<00:00:56.329> car<00:00:56.600> is<00:00:56.960> not<00:00:57.950> running<00:00:58.250> or

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
working when the car is not running or

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.430 
working when the car is not running or
the<00:00:58.940> engine<00:00:59.120> is<00:00:59.480> not<00:00:59.660> on<00:00:59.829> then<00:01:00.829> do<00:01:01.730> not<00:01:02.000> a<00:01:02.539> kind

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:03.440 
the engine is not on then do not a kind

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.200 
the engine is not on then do not a kind
of<00:01:03.620> take<00:01:04.580> any<00:01:04.820> notice<00:01:05.180> of<00:01:05.420> that<00:01:05.750> always<00:01:07.180> make<00:01:08.180> a

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
of take any notice of that always make a

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.510 
of take any notice of that always make a
decision<00:01:09.110> whether<00:01:09.410> your<00:01:09.770> four-wheel<00:01:10.280> drive

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
decision whether your four-wheel drive

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.520 
decision whether your four-wheel drive
system<00:01:10.550> is<00:01:11.030> working<00:01:11.180> correctly<00:01:11.539> or<00:01:11.959> not<00:01:11.990> when

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
system is working correctly or not when

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.490 
system is working correctly or not when
the<00:01:12.740> engine<00:01:13.130> is<00:01:13.250> on<00:01:13.429> and<00:01:13.819> running<00:01:14.240> so<00:01:14.990> just

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
the engine is on and running so just

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.699 
the engine is on and running so just
hold<00:01:15.740> it<00:01:15.920> up<00:01:16.100> and<00:01:16.750> start<00:01:17.750> the<00:01:17.869> car<00:01:18.110> and<00:01:18.410> just

00:01:18.699 --> 00:01:18.709 
hold it up and start the car and just

00:01:18.709 --> 00:01:22.389 
hold it up and start the car and just
see<00:01:19.310> all<00:01:19.729> the<00:01:20.090> wheels<00:01:20.330> are<00:01:20.860> turning<00:01:21.860> correctly

00:01:22.389 --> 00:01:22.399 
see all the wheels are turning correctly

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:26.139 
see all the wheels are turning correctly
because<00:01:22.640> often<00:01:23.360> when<00:01:24.050> you<00:01:25.039> just<00:01:25.340> turn<00:01:25.640> one

00:01:26.139 --> 00:01:26.149 
because often when you just turn one

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:28.809 
because often when you just turn one
will<00:01:26.420> buy<00:01:26.780> hands<00:01:27.319> often<00:01:27.920> the<00:01:28.399> four-wheel

00:01:28.809 --> 00:01:28.819 
will buy hands often the four-wheel

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:31.510 
will buy hands often the four-wheel
drive<00:01:29.090> system<00:01:29.119> doesn't<00:01:30.110> work<00:01:30.140> anyway<00:01:30.830> when

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
drive system doesn't work anyway when

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.850 
drive system doesn't work anyway when
you're<00:01:31.759> just<00:01:32.000> manually<00:01:32.750> turning<00:01:33.470> the<00:01:33.619> wheels

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
you're just manually turning the wheels

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.330 
you're just manually turning the wheels
so<00:01:34.849> always<00:01:35.270> run<00:01:35.840> at<00:01:36.140> the<00:01:36.259> engine<00:01:36.740> and<00:01:37.009> then

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
so always run at the engine and then

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.180 
so always run at the engine and then
decide<00:01:37.970> if<00:01:38.300> it's<00:01:38.450> not<00:01:38.660> working<00:01:39.039> alright<00:01:40.039> the

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:40.190 
decide if it's not working alright the

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.639 
decide if it's not working alright the
first<00:01:40.220> thing<00:01:40.610> i<00:01:41.060> would<00:01:41.209> say<00:01:41.509> to<00:01:41.810> check<00:01:42.289> is

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:42.649 
first thing i would say to check is

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:45.639 
first thing i would say to check is
actually<00:01:43.280> to<00:01:43.940> check<00:01:44.209> that<00:01:44.509> all<00:01:44.720> the<00:01:44.750> dog<00:01:45.259> bones

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:45.649 
actually to check that all the dog bones

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:49.180 
actually to check that all the dog bones
are<00:01:46.130> in<00:01:46.429> there<00:01:46.849> right<00:01:47.240> positions<00:01:47.959> most<00:01:48.649> RC

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.190 
are in there right positions most RC

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:54.490 
are in there right positions most RC
vehicles<00:01:49.729> you<00:01:50.270> will<00:01:50.509> find<00:01:51.489> one<00:01:52.489> two<00:01:53.500> three

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
vehicles you will find one two three

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.350 
vehicles you will find one two three
four<00:01:55.489> five<00:01:56.259> six<00:01:57.259> dog<00:01:57.619> bones<00:01:57.920> on<00:01:58.220> your<00:01:58.729> RC

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
four five six dog bones on your RC

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.639 
four five six dog bones on your RC
vehicle<00:01:59.899> so<00:02:01.000> you<00:02:02.000> found<00:02:02.390> that<00:02:03.170> the<00:02:03.380> drive

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:03.649 
vehicle so you found that the drive

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:05.770 
vehicle so you found that the drive
system<00:02:03.920> is<00:02:04.280> not<00:02:04.489> working<00:02:04.520> correctly<00:02:05.090> then

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
system is not working correctly then

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.979 
system is not working correctly then
just<00:02:06.110> check<00:02:06.619> that<00:02:07.489> all<00:02:07.700> the<00:02:07.729> dog<00:02:08.030> bones<00:02:08.330> are<00:02:08.720> in

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:08.989 
just check that all the dog bones are in

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:14.979 
just check that all the dog bones are in
their<00:02:09.200> place<00:02:09.910> so<00:02:10.910> there<00:02:11.630> will<00:02:11.750> be<00:02:11.780> 12<00:02:13.959> at<00:02:14.959> the

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:14.989 
their place so there will be 12 at the

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:16.240 
their place so there will be 12 at the
front

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
front

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:25.390 
front
so<00:02:16.540> there<00:02:17.540> is<00:02:17.570> one<00:02:17.990> there<00:02:19.960> is<00:02:21.070> two<00:02:23.920> two<00:02:24.920> in<00:02:25.280> the

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
so there is one there is two two in the

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.980 
so there is one there is two two in the
middle<00:02:25.790> going<00:02:26.120> from<00:02:26.360> your<00:02:26.540> central

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
middle going from your central

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:29.830 
middle going from your central
differential<00:02:27.530> gear<00:02:27.710> box<00:02:28.030> see<00:02:29.030> there<00:02:29.330> there<00:02:29.690> is

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
differential gear box see there there is

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.090 
differential gear box see there there is
one<00:02:30.110> down<00:02:30.530> there<00:02:30.830> and<00:02:32.110> another<00:02:33.110> one<00:02:33.410> the<00:02:33.920> other

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
one down there and another one the other

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.260 
one down there and another one the other
side<00:02:34.400> is<00:02:34.580> one<00:02:34.730> and<00:02:34.880> the<00:02:34.910> two<00:02:35.300> at<00:02:35.750> the<00:02:35.780> back

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
side is one and the two at the back

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:40.390 
side is one and the two at the back
there<00:02:38.270> though<00:02:39.140> first<00:02:39.590> thing<00:02:39.800> to<00:02:39.950> do<00:02:40.100> is<00:02:40.130> just

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
there though first thing to do is just

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.460 
there though first thing to do is just
actually<00:02:41.030> check<00:02:41.390> that<00:02:41.660> all<00:02:41.810> the<00:02:41.840> dog<00:02:42.170> bones

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
actually check that all the dog bones

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.949 
actually check that all the dog bones
are<00:02:42.830> where<00:02:43.010> they<00:02:43.190> should<00:02:43.220> be<00:02:43.520> on<00:02:43.970> your<00:02:44.180> RC

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
are where they should be on your RC

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:46.420 
are where they should be on your RC
vehicle<00:02:45.470> they're<00:02:45.830> all<00:02:45.980> in<00:02:46.130> the<00:02:46.250> right<00:02:46.370> places

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
vehicle they're all in the right places

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.380 
vehicle they're all in the right places
and<00:02:47.300> that<00:02:47.930> none<00:02:48.260> of<00:02:48.290> them<00:02:48.770> are<00:02:48.980> missing<00:02:49.400> if<00:02:50.239> you

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
and that none of them are missing if you

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.540 
and that none of them are missing if you
find<00:02:50.750> that<00:02:51.080> the<00:02:51.200> dog<00:02:51.500> bones<00:02:51.770> are<00:02:51.950> missing<00:02:52.340> then

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
find that the dog bones are missing then

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.010 
find that the dog bones are missing then
you<00:02:52.670> will<00:02:52.790> probably<00:02:53.000> have<00:02:53.239> to<00:02:53.300> replace<00:02:53.750> them

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 
you will probably have to replace them

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:55.449 
you will probably have to replace them
in<00:02:54.170> order<00:02:54.320> to<00:02:54.440> get<00:02:54.650> your<00:02:54.770> full<00:02:55.010> wheel<00:02:55.250> drive

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
in order to get your full wheel drive

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:57.520 
in order to get your full wheel drive
system<00:02:55.700> working<00:02:56.150> correctly<00:02:56.570> I<00:02:56.959> get<00:02:57.200> the

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
system working correctly I get the

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.949 
system working correctly I get the
reason<00:02:57.980> the<00:02:58.430> four-wheel<00:02:59.060> drive<00:02:59.300> system<00:02:59.330> is

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
reason the four-wheel drive system is

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:01.960 
reason the four-wheel drive system is
not<00:03:00.110> working<00:03:00.140> correctly<00:03:00.620> on<00:03:01.130> your<00:03:01.310> vehicle<00:03:01.760> is

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
not working correctly on your vehicle is

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.600 
not working correctly on your vehicle is
because<00:03:02.330> in<00:03:02.660> fact<00:03:02.870> underneath<00:03:03.560> the<00:03:03.739> wheel<00:03:03.950> we

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
because in fact underneath the wheel we

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.930 
because in fact underneath the wheel we
have<00:03:04.820> a<00:03:05.030> wheel<00:03:05.270> hex<00:03:05.660> so<00:03:06.530> if<00:03:06.860> you<00:03:07.040> first<00:03:07.400> remove

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
have a wheel hex so if you first remove

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.790 
have a wheel hex so if you first remove
the<00:03:07.970> wheel<00:03:08.450> of<00:03:08.480> which<00:03:09.140> is<00:03:09.590> not<00:03:10.580> turning

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:11.800 
the wheel of which is not turning

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:16.650 
the wheel of which is not turning
correctly<00:03:12.800> so<00:03:14.080> here<00:03:15.080> we<00:03:15.230> are<00:03:15.410> here's<00:03:16.220> the<00:03:16.310> will

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
correctly so here we are here's the will

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.680 
correctly so here we are here's the will
first<00:03:17.660> remove<00:03:17.900> the<00:03:18.110> we'll<00:03:18.910> talk<00:03:19.910> like<00:03:20.630> that

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
first remove the we'll talk like that

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:26.650 
first remove the we'll talk like that
and<00:03:21.790> then<00:03:23.230> under<00:03:24.230> the<00:03:24.739> will<00:03:24.980> here<00:03:25.970> is<00:03:26.600> your

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
and then under the will here is your

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:32.410 
and then under the will here is your
will<00:03:28.120> hex<00:03:29.860> the<00:03:30.860> wheel<00:03:31.100> hex<00:03:31.610> is<00:03:31.970> the<00:03:32.000> thing<00:03:32.390> that

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 
will hex the wheel hex is the thing that

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.229 
will hex the wheel hex is the thing that
sits<00:03:33.140> next<00:03:33.470> to<00:03:33.680> the<00:03:33.799> steering<00:03:34.130> knuckle<00:03:34.760> here

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
sits next to the steering knuckle here

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:40.539 
sits next to the steering knuckle here
and<00:03:35.890> spins<00:03:37.600> slots<00:03:38.600> into<00:03:38.930> the<00:03:39.200> will<00:03:39.549> therefore

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:40.549 
and spins slots into the will therefore

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:45.550 
and spins slots into the will therefore
turning<00:03:41.360> your<00:03:41.600> will<00:03:41.840> correctly<00:03:42.790> now<00:03:43.790> on<00:03:44.560> RC

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
turning your will correctly now on RC

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.270 
turning your will correctly now on RC
vehicles<00:03:46.100> on<00:03:46.489> the<00:03:47.090> wheel<00:03:47.360> hex<00:03:47.780> here<00:03:48.230> there<00:03:49.040> are

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
vehicles on the wheel hex here there are

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:54.100 
vehicles on the wheel hex here there are
two<00:03:49.700> kind<00:03:50.360> of<00:03:50.540> little<00:03:50.930> hex<00:03:51.709> screws<00:03:52.459> on<00:03:53.110> the

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:54.110 
two kind of little hex screws on the

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:58.060 
two kind of little hex screws on the
wheel<00:03:54.320> hex<00:03:54.709> so<00:03:55.610> first<00:03:56.329> check<00:03:56.840> that<00:03:57.410> the<00:03:57.620> screws

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.070 
wheel hex so first check that the screws

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:01.270 
wheel hex so first check that the screws
are<00:03:58.400> both<00:03:58.760> there<00:03:59.360> the<00:04:00.140> screws<00:04:00.500> are<00:04:00.530> not<00:04:01.040> there

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
are both there the screws are not there

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.479 
are both there the screws are not there
then<00:04:01.730> in<00:04:02.000> fact<00:04:02.329> this<00:04:03.049> is<00:04:03.110> the<00:04:03.500> reason<00:04:03.709> why<00:04:03.950> your

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:04.489 
then in fact this is the reason why your

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:07.390 
then in fact this is the reason why your
four-wheel<00:04:05.180> drive<00:04:05.510> system<00:04:05.540> is<00:04:06.350> not<00:04:07.160> working

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
four-wheel drive system is not working

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.380 
four-wheel drive system is not working
correctly<00:04:08.150> like<00:04:08.930> it<00:04:09.230> should<00:04:09.530> if<00:04:10.489> the<00:04:11.030> screws

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:11.390 
correctly like it should if the screws

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:14.199 
correctly like it should if the screws
are<00:04:11.630> missing<00:04:11.660> then<00:04:12.560> replace<00:04:13.250> the<00:04:13.519> screws<00:04:13.820> and

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:14.209 
are missing then replace the screws and

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:16.479 
are missing then replace the screws and
you<00:04:14.360> will<00:04:14.570> find<00:04:14.840> that<00:04:15.170> your<00:04:15.530> four-wheel<00:04:16.160> drive

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:16.489 
you will find that your four-wheel drive

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:19.270 
you will find that your four-wheel drive
system<00:04:16.519> is<00:04:17.299> therefore<00:04:18.200> working<00:04:18.799> correctly

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
system is therefore working correctly

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.530 
system is therefore working correctly
again<00:04:19.900> ok<00:04:20.900> then<00:04:21.109> that<00:04:21.410> is<00:04:21.620> all<00:04:21.829> for<00:04:22.070> now<00:04:22.540> thank

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:23.540 
again ok then that is all for now thank

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:25.380

more reason as to why your RC vehicle
four-wheel<00:04:38.110> drive<00:04:38.380> system<00:04:38.410> is<00:04:39.100> not<00:04:39.790> working

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440 
four-wheel drive system is not working

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:44.250 
four-wheel drive system is not working
correctly<00:04:42.120> going<00:04:43.120> back<00:04:43.300> to<00:04:43.330> the<00:04:43.600> earlier<00:04:43.960> part

correctly going back to the earlier part

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.220 
correctly going back to the earlier part
in<00:04:44.440> the<00:04:44.530> video<00:04:44.710> I<00:04:45.250> actually<00:04:45.460> said<00:04:46.060> do<00:04:46.600> not<00:04:46.810> test

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:47.230 
in the video I actually said do not test

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:49.710 
in the video I actually said do not test
the<00:04:47.770> four-wheel<00:04:48.190> drive<00:04:48.430> system<00:04:48.540> when<00:04:49.540> the

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 
the four-wheel drive system when the

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.320 
the four-wheel drive system when the
vehicle<00:04:49.960> is<00:04:50.200> off<00:04:50.440> see<00:04:51.190> here<00:04:51.460> I<00:04:51.730> know<00:04:51.790> that<00:04:52.210> the

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.330 
vehicle is off see here I know that the

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:53.670 
vehicle is off see here I know that the
four-wheel<00:04:52.690> drive<00:04:52.960> system<00:04:52.990> is<00:04:53.530> working

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
four-wheel drive system is working

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.840 
four-wheel drive system is working
correctly<00:04:54.100> but<00:04:54.670> if<00:04:55.360> I<00:04:55.450> spin<00:04:55.870> the<00:04:56.230> wheels<00:04:56.850> with

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:57.850 
correctly but if I spin the wheels with

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:01.560 
correctly but if I spin the wheels with
the<00:04:58.030> engine<00:04:58.390> off<00:04:58.800> look<00:04:59.800> only<00:05:00.430> two<00:05:00.700> wheels<00:05:01.000> turn

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:01.570 
the engine off look only two wheels turn

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:05.340 
the engine off look only two wheels turn
so<00:05:02.230> always<00:05:02.650> test<00:05:03.190> your<00:05:03.610> full<00:05:04.390> drive<00:05:04.840> system

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:05.350 
so always test your full drive system

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:08.190 
so always test your full drive system
when<00:05:05.950> the<00:05:06.760> vehicle<00:05:07.060> is<00:05:07.390> actually<00:05:07.870> running

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:08.200 
when the vehicle is actually running

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.030 
when the vehicle is actually running
best<00:05:09.130> way<00:05:09.370> is<00:05:09.640> just<00:05:09.730> to<00:05:10.030> lift<00:05:10.300> it<00:05:10.450> up<00:05:10.600> and

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:11.040 
best way is just to lift it up and
