timer
each<00:00:13.820> timer<00:00:14.209> is<00:00:14.389> individual<00:00:14.959> and<00:00:15.139> it<00:00:15.230> comes

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:15.469 
each timer is individual and it comes

familiar with how to operate this timer

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:21.340 
familiar with how to operate this timer
we<00:00:20.000> ask<00:00:20.180> that<00:00:20.360> you<00:00:20.480> seek<00:00:20.720> an<00:00:20.840> electrician

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:23.650 
because there is electrical power and

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.859 
because there is electrical power and
you<00:00:24.650> will<00:00:24.680> need<00:00:25.070> to<00:00:25.220> know<00:00:25.660> what<00:00:26.660> you're

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:28.340 
actually doing here you can see the

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.359 
actually doing here you can see the
control<00:00:28.699> knobs<00:00:28.970> and<00:00:29.300> each<00:00:29.900> valve<00:00:30.470> will

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:31.369 
control knobs and each valve will

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:34.119 
control knobs and each valve will
indicate<00:00:31.930> have<00:00:32.930> its<00:00:33.230> own<00:00:33.379> indicator<00:00:33.800> so<00:00:34.010> what

00:00:34.119 --> 00:00:34.129 
indicate have its own indicator so what

you want to do is you want to set the
timer<00:00:36.550> for<00:00:37.550> the<00:00:37.579> whole<00:00:37.850> lawn<00:00:38.059> at<00:00:38.269> once<00:00:38.479> and<00:00:38.899> it

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:39.140 
timer for the whole lawn at once and it

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.049 
timer for the whole lawn at once and it
will<00:00:39.319> facilitate<00:00:40.929> if<00:00:41.929> you<00:00:42.260> set<00:00:42.559> it<00:00:42.710> up<00:00:42.829> for

00:00:43.049 --> 00:00:43.059 
will facilitate if you set it up for

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:45.340 
will facilitate if you set it up for
certain<00:00:44.059> valves<00:00:44.479> to<00:00:44.569> turn<00:00:44.780> on<00:00:44.929> at<00:00:45.079> certain

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.350 
certain valves to turn on at certain

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.619 
certain valves to turn on at certain
times<00:00:45.649> and<00:00:46.039> for<00:00:46.729> the<00:00:46.819> duration<00:00:47.389> of<00:00:47.569> that

00:00:47.619 --> 00:00:47.629 
times and for the duration of that

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:51.729 
times and for the duration of that
actual<00:00:48.409> water<00:00:48.889> flow<00:00:49.399> so<00:00:49.989> again<00:00:50.989> it's<00:00:51.469> very

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:51.739 
actual water flow so again it's very

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:54.149 
actual water flow so again it's very
important<00:00:52.249> that<00:00:52.280> each<00:00:52.609> valve<00:00:52.909> timer<00:00:53.539> is

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:54.159 
important that each valve timer is

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:57.489 
important that each valve timer is
different<00:00:55.159> that<00:00:55.579> you<00:00:55.760> go<00:00:55.940> ahead<00:00:56.059> and<00:00:56.510> you<00:00:56.929> take
