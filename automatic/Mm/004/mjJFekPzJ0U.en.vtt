into<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.820> middle<00:00:54.030> but<00:00:54.180> make<00:00:54.479> sure<00:00:54.510> you're

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:54.720 
into the middle but make sure you're

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.299 
into the middle but make sure you're
always<00:00:54.780> behind<00:00:55.110> some<00:00:55.530> sort<00:00:55.739> of<00:00:55.799> cover<00:00:56.010> because

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
always behind some sort of cover because

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.969 
always behind some sort of cover because
once<00:00:56.670> you<00:00:56.790> shoot<00:00:57.260> people<00:00:58.260> will<00:00:58.379> start<00:00:58.619> running

once you shoot people will start running

00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:02.420 
once you shoot people will start running
to<00:00:59.129> you<00:00:59.250> and<00:01:00.290> it's<00:01:01.290> really<00:01:01.680> really<00:01:01.949> a<00:01:02.159> good

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
to you and it's really really a good

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.770 
to you and it's really really a good
idea<00:01:02.549> it<00:01:02.909> doesn't<00:01:03.180> matter<00:01:03.330> how<00:01:03.420> many<00:01:03.540> deaths

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
idea it doesn't matter how many deaths

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.270 
idea it doesn't matter how many deaths
you<00:01:03.930> get<00:01:04.110> but<00:01:04.290> it's<00:01:04.320> a<00:01:04.470> really<00:01:04.710> good<00:01:04.769> idea<00:01:04.949> to

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
you get but it's a really good idea to

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.050 
you get but it's a really good idea to
get<00:01:05.900> into<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.650> groove<00:01:07.920> real<00:01:08.580> early<00:01:08.820> on

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
get into the groove real early on

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.910 
get into the groove real early on
because<00:01:09.299> if<00:01:09.600> you're<00:01:09.990> stuck<00:01:10.290> with<00:01:10.409> a<00:01:10.439> python

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
because if you're stuck with a python

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.200 
because if you're stuck with a python
when<00:01:11.130> somebody<00:01:11.490> else<00:01:11.520> is<00:01:11.729> on<00:01:11.880> like<00:01:12.060> that

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
when somebody else is on like that

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.289 
when somebody else is on like that
machine<00:01:12.329> gun<00:01:12.689> who<00:01:13.500> is<00:01:13.710> like<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:13.950> body<00:01:14.490> it's

across the middle while I get a free
kill<00:02:26.730> and<00:02:27.730> so<00:02:28.329> numb<00:02:28.600> can't<00:02:29.410> seem<00:02:29.590> to<00:02:29.709> be

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
who don't know it goes like from pistols

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.990 
who don't know it goes like from pistols
to<00:02:34.690> shotguns<00:02:35.260> to<00:02:35.560> submachine<00:02:36.220> guns<00:02:36.519> to

to shotguns to submachine guns to

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.539 
to shotguns to submachine guns to
assault<00:02:37.299> rifles<00:02:37.720> two<00:02:37.989> machine<00:02:38.319> guns<00:02:38.549> after

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:39.549 
assault rifles two machine guns after

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:44.490

that<00:02:39.700> is<00:02:39.849> sniper<00:02:40.239> rifles<00:02:41.010> and<00:02:43.170> think<00:02:44.170> that<00:02:44.319> for

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
that is sniper rifles and think that for

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.259 
that is sniper rifles and think that for
that<00:02:44.590> is<00:02:44.799> oh<00:02:45.010> yeah<00:02:45.160> the<00:02:45.370> launchers<00:02:45.849> and<00:02:45.880> the<00:02:46.150> de

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:46.269 
that is oh yeah the launchers and the de

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:51.870 
that is oh yeah the launchers and the de
special<00:02:46.980> special<00:02:47.980> weapons<00:02:48.579> and<00:02:48.989> so<00:02:50.849> right<00:02:51.849> now

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
special special weapons and so right now

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.750 
special special weapons and so right now
I'm<00:02:52.180> on<00:02:52.359> the<00:02:52.569> machine<00:02:52.930> gun

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
I'm on the machine gun

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.449 
I'm on the machine gun
and<00:02:53.909> after<00:02:54.269> this<00:02:54.420> I<00:02:54.629> will<00:02:54.689> be<00:02:54.959> given<00:02:55.560> a<00:02:55.799> sniper

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
and after this I will be given a sniper

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:59.449 
and after this I will be given a sniper
rifle<00:02:57.260> that's<00:02:58.260> actually<00:02:58.379> two<00:02:58.709> of<00:02:58.739> them<00:02:58.980> but<00:02:59.280> i

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
rifle that's actually two of them but i

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:02.089 
rifle that's actually two of them but i
think<00:02:59.730> by<00:03:00.599> far<00:03:00.629> the<00:03:01.230> sniper<00:03:01.500> rifles<00:03:01.890> are<00:03:02.010> the

00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:02.099 
think by far the sniper rifles are the

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:04.490 
think by far the sniper rifles are the
hardest<00:03:02.519> to<00:03:02.579> use<00:03:02.760> in<00:03:02.970> my<00:03:03.150> opinion<00:03:03.450> at<00:03:04.439> least

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
hardest to use in my opinion at least

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:05.960 
hardest to use in my opinion at least
for<00:03:04.890> me<00:03:05.040> because<00:03:05.280> I'm<00:03:05.459> not<00:03:05.610> a<00:03:05.670> very<00:03:05.879> good

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
for me because I'm not a very good

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.860 
for me because I'm not a very good
sniper<00:03:06.890> so<00:03:07.890> it's<00:03:08.519> you<00:03:09.239> know<00:03:09.360> it's<00:03:09.390> not<00:03:09.689> the

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
sniper so it's you know it's not the

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.369 
sniper so it's you know it's not the
easiest<00:03:10.140> thing<00:03:10.829> to<00:03:10.950> use<00:03:11.159> but<00:03:11.430> I<00:03:12.260> think<00:03:13.260> got

00:03:13.369 --> 00:03:13.379 
easiest thing to use but I think got

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:15.890 
easiest thing to use but I think got
really<00:03:13.680> lucky<00:03:13.829> in<00:03:14.010> this<00:03:14.159> game<00:03:14.400> like<00:03:14.610> I<00:03:14.730> was<00:03:14.909> had

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
really lucky in this game like I was had

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.449 
really lucky in this game like I was had
a<00:03:15.930> lot<00:03:16.230> of<00:03:16.260> adrenaline<00:03:16.620> pumping<00:03:17.159> from<00:03:17.310> my

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
a lot of adrenaline pumping from my

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:22.580 
a lot of adrenaline pumping from my
blood<00:03:17.730> and<00:03:18.690> so<00:03:19.530> from<00:03:20.159> here<00:03:20.370> on<00:03:20.430> out<00:03:21.470> you<00:03:22.470> know

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
blood and so from here on out you know

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.920 
blood and so from here on out you know
it's<00:03:22.829> just<00:03:23.099> pretty<00:03:23.519> near<00:03:24.030> pretty<00:03:24.540> much<00:03:24.720> some

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
it's just pretty near pretty much some

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.099 
it's just pretty near pretty much some
sailing<00:03:25.260> but<00:03:26.150> more<00:03:27.150> people<00:03:27.450> aren't<00:03:27.690> like<00:03:27.900> the

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:28.109 
sailing but more people aren't like the

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:30.860 
sailing but more people aren't like the
submachine<00:03:28.950> gun<00:03:29.190> assault<00:03:29.489> rifle<00:03:29.849> and<00:03:30.090> it's

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
during that sort of period where people

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.069 
during that sort of period where people
start<00:03:33.780> to<00:03:34.579> you<00:03:35.579> know<00:03:35.609> rack<00:03:36.269> up<00:03:36.450> a<00:03:36.569> lot<00:03:36.599> of<00:03:36.900> kills

whatever<00:04:17.760> and<00:04:18.440> the<00:04:19.440> sniper<00:04:19.769> rifles<00:04:20.220> are<00:04:20.459> I

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:20.789 
whatever and the sniper rifles are I

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:24.500 
whatever and the sniper rifles are I
think<00:04:21.510> 13<00:04:21.959> or<00:04:22.109> 14<00:04:22.789> and<00:04:23.789> so<00:04:24.000> if<00:04:24.060> you<00:04:24.120> can<00:04:24.300> set

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
think 13 or 14 and so if you can set

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:26.510 
think 13 or 14 and so if you can set
them<00:04:24.720> back<00:04:24.930> right<00:04:24.960> there<00:04:25.349> that<00:04:26.130> would<00:04:26.310> be<00:04:26.490> a

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
them back right there that would be a

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.379 
them back right there that would be a
huge<00:04:27.380> game<00:04:28.380> changer<00:04:28.410> at<00:04:28.949> least<00:04:29.130> for<00:04:29.280> you<00:04:29.430> same

was still able to get sticky and yeah

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:33.930 
was still able to get sticky and yeah
look<00:05:31.270> at<00:05:31.389> this<00:05:32.250> this<00:05:33.250> is<00:05:33.400> the<00:05:33.490> ballistic<00:05:33.909> knife

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:33.940 
look at this this is the ballistic knife

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:36.480 
look at this this is the ballistic knife
it's<00:05:34.389> a<00:05:34.449> bit<00:05:34.599> hard<00:05:34.810> to<00:05:34.840> use<00:05:35.169> and<00:05:35.469> if<00:05:35.919> you<00:05:36.219> want

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:36.490 
it's a bit hard to use and if you want

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:37.649 
it's a bit hard to use and if you want
to<00:05:36.610> use<00:05:36.759> the<00:05:36.909> ballistic<00:05:37.270> knife<00:05:37.300> you<00:05:37.509> got<00:05:37.599> a

00:05:37.649 --> 00:05:37.659 
to use the ballistic knife you got a

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:40.350 
to use the ballistic knife you got a
lead<00:05:37.930> to<00:05:38.169> lead<00:05:38.889> the<00:05:39.190> enemy<00:05:39.759> a<00:05:39.789> little<00:05:40.030> bit<00:05:40.180> i

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:40.360 
lead to lead the enemy a little bit i

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.140 
lead to lead the enemy a little bit i
think<00:05:41.139> i<00:05:41.229> had<00:05:41.379> a<00:05:41.409> three-bar<00:05:41.830> connection<00:05:42.340> so<00:05:43.120> i

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:43.150 
think i had a three-bar connection so i

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:45.390 
think i had a three-bar connection so i
had<00:05:43.449> to<00:05:43.599> lead<00:05:43.810> him<00:05:43.990> a<00:05:44.020> little<00:05:44.319> bit<00:05:44.440> and<00:05:45.039> I<00:05:45.190> think

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:45.400 
had to lead him a little bit and I think

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:46.890 
had to lead him a little bit and I think
you<00:05:45.460> have<00:05:45.550> to<00:05:45.580> do<00:05:45.759> that<00:05:45.879> anyways<00:05:46.240> the<00:05:46.419> full<00:05:46.629> bar

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:46.900 
you have to do that anyways the full bar

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:52.619 
you have to do that anyways the full bar
but<00:05:47.169> I<00:05:48.479> did<00:05:49.479> pull<00:05:49.870> off<00:05:50.020> the<00:05:50.169> win<00:05:50.319> it<00:05:51.419> it<00:05:52.419> was
