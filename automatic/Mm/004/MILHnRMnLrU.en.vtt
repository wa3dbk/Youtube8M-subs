00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.350
 welcome to this new little tutorial 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.690
 so today what are you showing 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.550
 a little tip that I take 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.170
 a lot to increase the service life 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.480
 a soft lure that we ride on a 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.040
 texan hook know that there is a lot 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.690
 of soft lure we use that are 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.740
 fragile enough that's why often 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.840
 that they are good because they are 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.740
 very flexible that they get to throws me 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.140
 is very slow 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.210
 then they take a lot of fish 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.699
 in the end but it's really annoying 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.050
 because we tear them up pretty quickly 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.060
 seeds and theirs that costs enough 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.369
 expensive besides so it's fast represents 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.870
 a budget so here are some small 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.190
 tips to increase the life 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.800
 I will enter you in line 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.329
 so let's take an example we are 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.309
 in the case of their fragile 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.500
 Here are only my I use 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.090
 many are moving away to Chad who has who 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.920
 at this fault , which is his advantage 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.120
 also as I said it's what 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.309
 does it take a lot of fish 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.360
 now it's true it's true 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.800
 that we tear it very quickly 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.469
 especially when they texan amounts 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.910
 so I will show you first of all 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.430
 montage that everyone does the site 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.530
 competitor texan we will maybe make a 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.449
 other tutor ladesou I will show you his 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.580
 standard details but here at the editing 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.880
 electronic mining have tipped 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:11.460
 we sting it in the belly we pierce 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.770
 and so that's the ai the texan amounts of 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.450
 classic way and the problem often 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.159
 in fact it intervenes just below 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.810
 here is the part that is under the eye 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.280
 she at the level there is the angle of 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.939
 the hook that is torn apart because this 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.700
 part there moves 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.320
 in general when when we go out 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.570
 water fish when it's in our 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.140
 mast on the edge in the boat in 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.030
 the scoop 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.500
 that's really who's going to shake it 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.240
 head in all directions and then and 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.950
 then that's going to put pressure on their 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.470
 kilos tear there so there is a 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.840
 little trick I'm going to remove the 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.610
 hooks i'm going to show you this exists 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.619
 it requires a small accessory that 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.020
 is called the versatile so that can 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.700
 these two passes that does that that's all 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.860
 just a little ball in 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.080
 rubber that is 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.910
 an inner breakthrough so both 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.800
 lobby sizes and his fourth of 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:59.520
 the size is she so the watch with 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:01.400
 the m who is the little voice the libya 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.840
 it's really this little bit like that 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:06.330
 is just their nets on my 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.360
 texan accent so it seems to me nabli 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.530
 that she has so there is a part that is 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.020
 more classy and the other who is a little 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.300
 little more comic su the I will spend the 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.100
 flat part first so all this 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.290
 in France simply in my soul 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.840
 are I'm going to force a little bit on 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:25.910
 I'm going to slide it the next day 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:29.310
 of monza it is necessary to force a little 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:31.320
 that's why that's why 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.800
 do not have that backstage too much 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.110
 easily 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.239
 but here I am going back to 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.750
 pick up here I hope we do not see 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:38.940
 good here 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:42.360
 maybe stagger me either on a background 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:44.130
 white here is the baby after it's 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.510
 like that and then in fact that's what will 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.230
 hold my their soup that will prevent it 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.750
 to tear 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.580
 on the other hand now it will annoy us 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.650
 for some reason it's that I can 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.820
 no more completely donning con men 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.350
 are in the soft lure because of the 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.489
 life that will block so what am I going 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.560
 do what I want to do it backwards 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:01.650
 it is only cork that their entry 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.660
 from below like that and then I'm going 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.760
 force to come out on it 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.290
 like that it's also easy especially in 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.000
 a lure that is very flexible like that 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.980
 and it is on this type of matter that 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.900
 we are interested it does not pose any 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.209
 worry about putting it upside down after one 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:19.350
 do them exactly the same thing I 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:20.820
 go back through theirs but that's it 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.799
 then begged rise of the defective 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.450
 who is so good but here are some just 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:24.930
 blocked here and it's going to stop him from getting 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.360
 tear 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.140
 when we see how much he feels he is going 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.380
 shake the head 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:33.840
 would go we will increase this life time 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:35.300
 normally but by four months because 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.860
 a corner c1 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:39.900
 we will really be able to take 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.670
 a lot of fish before before 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:45.060
 having to change from there so it's a trick 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:48.420
 which is stupid it is very easy to 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:50.430
 to do but hey we need to know 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:53.370
 so I hope it would have allowed you 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.810
 little last precision so he 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.210
 is size that I told you m 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.860
 is she so size m are we going 

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:01.260
 use it on hooks that go 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.460
 up to size 3 0 size l we are going 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:06.930
 start using it on hooks 

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:08.670
 4 0 road here I hope we 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.770
 will have a little trick with this tutorial 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:12.810
 and then I say soon we 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:16.550
 will find again very quickly for a 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.550
 new little tutorial hi
