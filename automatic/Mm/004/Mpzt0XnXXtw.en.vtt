00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.069
 hello my friends to be honest this 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.660
 lately because of the policy because 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.639
 a lot of work I was 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.860
 slightly demotivated to shoot video 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:14.790
 but many of you asked me to take off 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.289
 video about budget favorite budget 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.539
 Masthevyah it seemed to me that very 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.590
 interesting topic and here I am here and here 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.060
 actually my story 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.090
 The first thing I'll start this is my most 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.560
 favorite brest is now mix water 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.039
 gloss shade 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:31.230
 11 we are gandhi and i find it to be very 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:34.200
 refreshing cool color and i think that 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.149
 absolutely all goes this asgard bride 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.340
 especially, and in principle , we do not want 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.840
 look fresh it is very spring color 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.480
 Well , why I like this line 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.809
 imagine all that good can 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.370
 say about shine or polish lipstick 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:50.340
 comfortable and moisturizes like a balm on 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.899
 lips don't dry don't roll no 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.260
 nasty folds cool colors 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:57.680
 budget available good smell all that 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:01.170
 i can think of it all about him and and 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:03.300
 exactly three hundred comfort indicators 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.159
 everyone else, too , this is my 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.229
 the leader and extremely rarely they have all 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.619
 The shades are very beautiful 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.360
 about blush and this is my favorite 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:15.450
 rouge for almost all shades 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.750
 skin tanning levels happen in life for 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.320
 do they work themselves 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:22.870

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:25.750
 rouge 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:28.380
 especially the third shade 1 which one 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:31.090
 no he beige brown gray 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.610
 purple-pink all along with it will be 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:38.020
 very realistic pieces then found it 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:39.190
 exactly as an analogue shade under armani scourge 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.040
 my files 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:44.650

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.060
 and about the quality also like 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:48.880
 almost all other shades 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:51.550
 Especially matte blush of this brand is very 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.149
 a hundred times so dusty pink white 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:54.580

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:58.060
 0 1 0 already continue the kingdom 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:02:02.070

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.970
 gray brown beige and 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.600
 gray brown olive is also very 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.800
 cool grades they are of good quality 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.010
 pigmented daily can 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.420
 adjust and eyes and cheekbones also 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.860
 filmmakers like these shades and 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.480
 case or correction they are like 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.750

 wall risky also simonsen highly 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.400

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:29.560
 it all started of course say chord 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.410
 who recommended them and then mine 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.180

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.700

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:43.550
 thanks to everyone who is the river a lot of things madam 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:46.970
 because they are luxurious it is 16 shade 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:50.239
 so matt pink 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:53.150
 17 delightful totally chew 3 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:54.830
 peach coral it is bright and soft 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.230
 simultaneously and 13 ratings 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:59.090
 it's not real deep pink 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.459
 little you cherry seventeenth shade 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:04.310
 very tasty very happy and fun 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:06.739
 Leni such a little yellow teeth but 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.930
 makes the whole face more rested more 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:11.450
 tanned and stunning absolutely will 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:14.150
 look if someone has a green or 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:16.580
 blue eyes will be just a bomb and another 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:19.280
 amazing besides the 9 shade can be seen and 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:21.019
 i had three lipsticks in general they are insane 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.730
 not like and that is not pretty dense 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:25.640
 they look like my favorites from matlock 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:28.040
 lipsticks but they are even easier applied 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.750
 best kept on the lips they do not dry 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.459
 lips 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.260
 holding a resistant color in general is not one 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:35.750
 I know for matte lipstick for 300 rubles 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.970
 It seems to me the facades of recent novice 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.860
 the liner that really waited for everything 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:42.049
 the fact is that many know that these 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:44.299
 markers are very convenient for liner 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:46.430
 regular felt markers very quickly 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:49.400
 dry you do not have time to make up the second 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:51.260
 an eye and he has already dried up a lot in this 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.750
 In terms of such mods, the liquid is 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.790
 small brush about a marker but 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:58.340
 even more convenient products and here 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:01.060
 this liner is called super 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:04.760
 liner juice to hell we will distract 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:06.890
 very, very thin ruler 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.810
 summer salad or give achieved 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:11.420
 eyeliner is one of the coolest 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:14.060
 options because there it is liquid 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:16.010
 inside and a small neat tassel 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:19.370
 at the end and you can do it crazy 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:21.739
 accurate accurate work and he did not long 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:24.740
 dries before such were mostly 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:26.930
 only in Japanese Korean stamps 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:28.729
 cost like that insanely expensive screensaver in 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:30.680
 Russia here is this budget can 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:33.530
 find almost everywhere you need color 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:36.289
 deep black waterproof so 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:38.720
 I recommend it very much and even for work 

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:41.300
 he is very cool for himself too 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:43.760
 incredibly comfortable it seems to me the same way 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:46.370
 carcasses and again a little bit check this will 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:48.490
 million yes kills I don't know who is reading 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:51.320
 sketch of the lines of the lines here is this purple 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:54.199
 new mascara which has such silicone 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:56.570
 the brush is very classic for 

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:58.729
 Silicone now she gives it to us and gives 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:01.490
 very fluffy through green eyelashes she 

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:04.220
 reminds me too remember ours with 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:06.020
 you longtime favorite false lash effect 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:07.850
 also want you to remind us again 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:09.590
 Now everyone is asking what kind of mascara I 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:12.979
 advise apparently when it comes out very 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:15.500
 many new products on the market and not always all 

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:17.840
 it is good and sometimes we forget about the most 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.729
 the best that used to be very high 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:22.460
 I recommend it probably my favorite 

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:24.560
 ink from this mass-market false lash 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:27.199
 effect and it is brown black why 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:27.639
 something better than black very neat 

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:29.590
 kraz 

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:31.599
 eyelashes and about the same effect but still 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:34.090
 and black here is also good and a little 

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:37.389
 smaller dash middle effect between 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:38.289
 this one and this masterpiece max this one 

00:05:37.389 --> 00:05:41.229
 this is new 

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:43.300
 juice wiped version in real Russian soul in 

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:45.520
 general love for that of remember 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:48.729
 neatly divided about one 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:50.979
 the lengths are so true they are not super bulky 

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:54.039
 voluminous but good volume good length 

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:55.930
 how are they the best but best of all 

00:05:54.039 --> 00:05:58.509
 worlds are collected in this on these carcasses and 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:00.879
 really like just so beautiful 

00:05:58.509 --> 00:06:03.490
 I have a neat result on it 

00:06:00.879 --> 00:06:05.379
 later there will be a very general video 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:07.419
 many products from budget which i 

00:06:05.379 --> 00:06:09.789
