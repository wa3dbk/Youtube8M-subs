like<00:02:48.680> if<00:02:48.769> I<00:02:48.829> just<00:02:49.010> took<00:02:49.099> a<00:02:49.220> picture<00:02:49.430> like<00:02:49.610> that

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
like if I just took a picture like that

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:55.869 
like if I just took a picture like that
I<00:02:49.940> think<00:02:50.150> that'd<00:02:50.480> be<00:02:50.629> pretty<00:02:50.810> cool<00:02:51.190> um<00:02:54.849> one<00:02:55.849> of

00:02:55.869 --> 00:02:55.879 
I think that'd be pretty cool um one of

00:02:55.879 --> 00:03:01.210 
I think that'd be pretty cool um one of
my<00:02:55.970> favorite<00:02:56.239> joints<00:02:56.390> ways<00:02:56.810> swivel<00:02:58.989> um<00:03:00.220> that

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
my favorite joints ways swivel um that

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:02.619 
my favorite joints ways swivel um that
ball<00:03:01.549> joint<00:03:01.790> I<00:03:01.849> don't<00:03:02.030> really<00:03:02.120> like<00:03:02.299> the<00:03:02.420> ball

00:03:02.619 --> 00:03:02.629 
ball joint I don't really like the ball

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:03.640 
ball joint I don't really like the ball
down<00:03:02.780> here<00:03:02.900> it's<00:03:02.989> hard<00:03:03.170> because<00:03:03.319> when<00:03:03.530> you're

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
down here it's hard because when you're

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.949 
down here it's hard because when you're
trying<00:03:03.769> to<00:03:03.859> twist<00:03:04.069> it<00:03:04.340> you<00:03:05.269> have<00:03:05.359> to<00:03:05.480> bend<00:03:05.870> it

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:05.959 
trying to twist it you have to bend it

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:08.110 
trying to twist it you have to bend it
and<00:03:06.109> then<00:03:06.230> move<00:03:06.560> it<00:03:06.739> but<00:03:07.579> it's<00:03:07.700> kind<00:03:07.879> of<00:03:07.940> hard

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
and then move it but it's kind of hard

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.330 
and then move it but it's kind of hard
on<00:03:08.150> this<00:03:08.269> phantom<00:03:08.599> xnd<00:03:09.049> like<00:03:09.620> doing<00:03:09.950> it<00:03:10.069> messes

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
on this phantom xnd like doing it messes

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.339 
on this phantom xnd like doing it messes
up<00:03:10.430> like<00:03:10.640> the<00:03:10.790> lines<00:03:11.030> inside<00:03:11.810> see<00:03:12.079> the<00:03:12.109> lines

00:03:12.339 --> 00:03:12.349 
up like the lines inside see the lines

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:14.349 
up like the lines inside see the lines
here<00:03:12.620> and<00:03:12.650> then<00:03:12.859> I<00:03:13.069> move<00:03:13.700> this<00:03:13.819> up<00:03:13.970> this<00:03:14.090> lines

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:14.359 
here and then I move this up this lines

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:16.180 
here and then I move this up this lines
there<00:03:14.569> so<00:03:14.810> it's<00:03:15.260> kind<00:03:15.470> of<00:03:15.560> hard<00:03:15.620> to<00:03:15.799> move<00:03:16.010> that

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
there so it's kind of hard to move that

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:19.150 
there so it's kind of hard to move that
because<00:03:16.459> this<00:03:16.640> is<00:03:16.790> kind<00:03:17.000> of<00:03:17.560> this<00:03:18.560> is<00:03:18.739> looser

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
because this is kind of this is looser

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.920 
because this is kind of this is looser
and<00:03:19.190> this<00:03:19.579> is<00:03:19.730> tight<00:03:20.090> like<00:03:20.510> you're<00:03:20.630> gonna<00:03:20.750> have
