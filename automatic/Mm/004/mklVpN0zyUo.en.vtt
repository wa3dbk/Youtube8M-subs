00:00:01.089 --> 00:00:03.010
 yes hello my dear 

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:07.510
 he does not care anymore about the northeast around me today 

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:11.200
 this lake Niederzier enjoy grand slam endgame now and then 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.260
 change something 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:15.820
 the small one nothing great on the contrary it becomes one 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:16.670
 not only more 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:21.740
 that was right that sometimes it does not pump up a bit more 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:22.939
 not only around 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:27.320
 not only my opinion in the light - where I do not see anything 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:28.519
 whose or 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:32.750
 fort Kent - probably hardly to see if you at the beginning and at the end but also 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:34.430
 sometimes things where you are 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.110
 where you do not see in love 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.950
 and in my opinion that was the best one to carry a video game 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.400
 that is it so that I have made many videos lately 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.930
 and I create this whole video the us allies come to rest and 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:51.500
 But I do not want to tell him either 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.380
 of course I'm just taking it lying is said and the whole stop 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:59.330
 a bit of documentation in the past also new guidelines 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.570
 make - let's assume 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.950
 These are old games I do not want to miss anymore 

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:08.470
 how can I even here and there I can give my opinion on new games 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.890
 as a matter of course or maybe not possible 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.229
 It is very difficult for me to be one of the first providers opinions 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:16.990
 give 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.930
 actually have to play through a game maybe even experienced 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.970
 then I do not want to beloved Belarusians to their measure 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.440
 to be able to do this 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.630
 I still want to do something about it 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.040
 that means from now on a Czech tour group that was thus the trigger 

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:32.890
 I would like 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.890
 who binds himself forever say I hold these 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.060
 in other places 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.300
 I'm also with 6 2 9 and then saves and racing games and Summers sees it 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.300
 everything in the future though 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.420
 "I want to achieve that" The whole thing personally but that he served like that 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:49.380
 one week 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.070
 Presumably there are always Sundays areas with the dark no firm partner 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.060
 possible always believes sundays 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.130
 actually we have to wait 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:58.150
 in reality 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.920
 Percent at the counter what did I do just what was wrong 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.080
 what they deserve so my projects I will not 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.559
 Projects will betray the next few years I'll have to be 

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:13.379
 Percent AbbÃ© there also the current projects run between mill pond 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:16.379
 now tells that the current Vettel 

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:19.919
 because I worry against percent 

00:02:19.919 --> 00:02:23.709
 I'm not so far ahead as I am to be honest I know I'm in 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:26.480
 Mixer game against Australia will even happen 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.339
 For one, I had the analysts 

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:32.899
 but could Obama make up for that I want to do something like that 

00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:34.919
 we have arable 

00:02:34.919 --> 00:02:38.659
 Arkham Asylum is not older that one but not one 

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:41.659
 Honesty to make a video diary or water 

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:45.509
 then I have men standing by me 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:52.110
 who bought it Batman if country that even the Sporker I have no 

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:53.519
 I know if this game 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:57.599
 this was acceptable but that it would come so percent 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:02.040
 Can I say something again? Alexander Stehle Neuner Wilhelm 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.409
 Tell signs that even the Superb 

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:07.969
 the first offender after detention no longer needed security to 3 4 million 

00:03:07.969 --> 00:03:09.250
 not so 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.279
 but she needs to do it offhand and that's why she has to play 

00:03:12.279 --> 00:03:15.279
 I will try very hard that it will not take too long again 

00:03:17.679 --> 00:03:18.949
 this means 

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:23.419
 actually only his new CD not from me I guess I hope there 

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:26.459
 no one has anything against the plans once a week a log cabin 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:28.389
 Dan 

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:31.589
 As I said, I will publish videos Hagen books on the contrary 

00:03:31.589 --> 00:03:35.269
 they document the completed game and the first one I can do 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:38.400
 anytime data so you can still make a picture of it 

00:03:38.399 --> 00:03:42.179
 look that will be synonymous with percent online now maybe even 

00:03:42.179 --> 00:03:45.849
 before that it has been notified to a journal that percent is it 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:49.499
 the first game that is incapable of playing and there I could 

00:03:49.499 --> 00:03:51.349
 Combo of the future will look like 

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:55.099
 yes I think that's about it that was all I could say 

00:03:56.539 --> 00:04:00.629
 yes we were not on Facebook had ever announced in Frankfurt 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:03.419
 I mean, we should not answer 

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:06.799
 Of course not so that anytime become an eddy cue or something 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:09.819
 but if you have any questions please contact the Twitter Facebook or Skype 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:14.379
 is on a channel if you wanted something from I would also like to Amazon 

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:19.349
