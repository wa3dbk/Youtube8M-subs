00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:14.080
 very good guys welcome to 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:17.680
 thought of a geek today I bring you the 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:22.689
 comparative of cameras between the huawei 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:28.190
 that 620 s and the kubot s 200 as you can 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:31.430
 see in the cube you see me better you see 

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:33.560
 whole however the huawei I have the 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.840
 stretched arms is worth as you can see in 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:37.430
 the cube move all the arms without 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:42.110
 However in the Huawei it is seen from more 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:44.510
 close it's like your lens looks more 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:48.430
 next though huawei yes that captures 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:50.860
 much more distance 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:55.860
 and good for what I can appreciate in 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:58.410
 the images look like in the cube 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.890
 it looks very good I do not know if it's because of 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:04.290
 screen or also that the camera records 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.250
 a little better however the two the 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.010
 I see pretty well 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:12.460
 so nothing will I put a bit 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:15.580
 of this piece of video I will change the 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:18.310
 audios also so you can see how it is 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:20.500
 hey between one device and the other to see 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.660
 what microphone was even better in this 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:25.530
 camera of the entity and thus it seems to you 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:25.530
 let's move on now 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:34.479
 so we're going with the cameras 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.860
 back 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:40.670
 well guys we're already with the cameras 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:44.750
 rear of these two terminals seems 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:47.110
 be that more or less capture the same 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.110
 width 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.530
 I'm going to paddle here to the tree 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.549
 good 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:05.960
 the memories of neither of the two 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.960
 other cameras focuses alone apparently 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.399
 if this was very important for the 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.790
 people tell you that you can install 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:16.880
 any camera from another manufacturer or 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:19.070
 any camera application 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.610
 and then that car was to focus on the 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:23.490
 video 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.880
 good that one of the colors like a 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.880
 definition 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:36.519
 I for what I'm seeing as I say 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:41.140
 we seem more alive well 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:42.969
 of the young the screens to the sun also 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.760
 the cube is better than the 

00:02:42.969 --> 00:02:47.709
 huawei now I do not know if the quality of 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:52.470
 image and then I will see it on the computer 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:54.800
 when I edit it if it really looks better 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.870
 or not 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.610
 I will sit here a little more shadow to 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.390
 see how 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.390
 to change 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:25.800
 with more kids up here this test of 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:27.780
 gaming cameras 620 s and cube s 202 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:30.630
 terminals as I have told you in several 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:33.910
 quad-core occasions ram loggia 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:36.100
 and 8 gigs of internal storage 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:38.260
 I hope you liked it if it was like that 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.670
