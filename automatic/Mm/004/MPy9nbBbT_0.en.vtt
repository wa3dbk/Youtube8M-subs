we're layering bands of glass to sort of

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.969 
we're layering bands of glass to sort of
develop<00:00:50.300> cylinders<00:00:50.989> what<00:00:51.559> we<00:00:51.679> want<00:00:51.889> to

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:51.979 
develop cylinders what we want to

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:55.209 
develop cylinders what we want to
experiment<00:00:52.370> with<00:00:52.639> is<00:00:53.229> making<00:00:54.229> color<00:00:54.589> bands

00:00:55.209 --> 00:00:55.219 
experiment with is making color bands

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:58.719 
experiment with is making color bands
and<00:00:55.399> texture<00:00:56.329> bands<00:00:56.839> that<00:00:57.350> are<00:00:57.649> joined<00:00:58.219> and

00:00:58.719 --> 00:00:58.729 
and texture bands that are joined and

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:01.270 
and texture bands that are joined and
the<00:00:58.940> way<00:00:59.059> that<00:00:59.269> happens<00:00:59.719> is<00:00:59.960> that<00:01:00.289> each<00:01:00.829> of<00:01:01.100> the

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280 
the way that happens is that each of the

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.240 
the way that happens is that each of the
pieces<00:01:01.460> is<00:01:01.969> made<00:01:02.269> as<00:01:02.479> a<00:01:02.620> cup<00:01:03.620> if<00:01:03.889> you<00:01:04.040> think

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
pieces is made as a cup if you think

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.190 
pieces is made as a cup if you think
about<00:01:04.309> it<00:01:04.460> as<00:01:04.670> a<00:01:04.699> cup<00:01:05.000> and<00:01:05.239> then<00:01:05.690> they<00:01:05.960> are

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
about it as a cup and then they are

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.190 
about it as a cup and then they are
heated<00:01:06.920> up<00:01:07.070> and<00:01:07.250> applied<00:01:07.760> to<00:01:08.090> each<00:01:08.240> other<00:01:08.539> kind

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
heated up and applied to each other kind

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.620 
heated up and applied to each other kind
of<00:01:09.320> in<00:01:09.439> a<00:01:09.530> stack<00:01:09.920> and<00:01:10.280> then<00:01:10.939> after<00:01:11.509> they're

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
of in a stack and then after they're

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.899 
of in a stack and then after they're
assembled<00:01:12.110> there<00:01:12.380> they're<00:01:12.770> heated<00:01:13.579> up<00:01:13.729> and

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:13.909 
assembled there they're heated up and

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:16.959 
assembled there they're heated up and
fused<00:01:14.600> together<00:01:14.810> in<00:01:15.289> a<00:01:15.409> way<00:01:15.619> that<00:01:15.649> allows<00:01:16.640> them

00:01:16.959 --> 00:01:16.969 
fused together in a way that allows them

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:19.149 
fused together in a way that allows them
to<00:01:17.000> make<00:01:17.329> of<00:01:17.479> oz

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:19.159 
to make of oz

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:21.130 
to make of oz
I<00:01:19.280> think<00:01:19.850> it<00:01:19.909> turned<00:01:20.090> out<00:01:20.179> really<00:01:20.240> well<00:01:20.479> pretty

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
I think it turned out really well pretty

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.319 
I think it turned out really well pretty
exciting<00:01:21.340> so<00:01:22.340> this<00:01:22.520> project<00:01:23.060> that<00:01:23.179> we're

00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:23.329 
exciting so this project that we're

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:26.230 
exciting so this project that we're
working<00:01:23.420> on<00:01:23.749> is<00:01:23.929> a<00:01:23.960> project<00:01:24.710> for<00:01:25.429> a<00:01:25.490> charitable

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
working on is a project for a charitable

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.809 
working on is a project for a charitable
auction<00:01:26.929> that<00:01:27.200> I<00:01:27.560> was<00:01:28.219> invited<00:01:28.700> to

industry<00:01:43.159> foundation<00:01:43.549> fighting<00:01:44.390> AIDS<00:01:44.659> so<00:01:45.289> I

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
industry foundation fighting AIDS so I

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.789 
industry foundation fighting AIDS so I
took<00:01:46.670> one<00:01:47.179> of<00:01:47.299> the<00:01:47.420> carpet<00:01:47.869> squares<00:01:48.079> and<00:01:48.469> I<00:01:48.590> got

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:48.799 
took one of the carpet squares and I got

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:51.209 
took one of the carpet squares and I got
the<00:01:48.920> most<00:01:49.099> textural<00:01:49.729> piece<00:01:49.969> that<00:01:50.299> I<00:01:50.329> could<00:01:50.780> and

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:51.219 
the most textural piece that I could and

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:54.069 
the most textural piece that I could and
I<00:01:52.219> used<00:01:52.579> it<00:01:52.759> to<00:01:52.789> create<00:01:53.060> a<00:01:53.239> mold<00:01:53.599> that<00:01:53.840> will

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:54.079 
I used it to create a mold that will

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:56.380 
I used it to create a mold that will
then<00:01:54.259> form<00:01:54.679> the<00:01:54.739> glass<00:01:55.159> on<00:01:55.369> so<00:01:55.670> this<00:01:55.849> is<00:01:56.060> the

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
then form the glass on so this is the

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.559 
then form the glass on so this is the
the<00:01:57.219> mold<00:01:58.219> that<00:01:58.459> I<00:01:58.520> made<00:01:58.789> from<00:01:59.030> the<00:01:59.119> carpet<00:01:59.539> and

00:01:59.559 --> 00:01:59.569 
the mold that I made from the carpet and

00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:03.520 
the mold that I made from the carpet and
as<00:02:00.049> you<00:02:00.200> can<00:02:00.349> see<00:02:00.379> the<00:02:00.679> carpeting<00:02:01.270> was<00:02:02.530> striped

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
as you can see the carpeting was striped

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.649 
as you can see the carpeting was striped
and<00:02:03.890> what<00:02:04.189> we're<00:02:04.310> trying<00:02:04.340> to<00:02:04.610> do<00:02:04.789> is<00:02:04.969> use<00:02:05.329> this

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659 
and what we're trying to do is use this

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:08.410 
and what we're trying to do is use this
to<00:02:06.319> try<00:02:06.530> to<00:02:06.560> transfer<00:02:07.310> that<00:02:07.340> texture<00:02:07.969> onto<00:02:08.149> the

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
to try to transfer that texture onto the

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.410 
to try to transfer that texture onto the
glass<00:02:08.720> so<00:02:09.170> that<00:02:09.200> when<00:02:09.470> I<00:02:09.849> go<00:02:10.849> to<00:02:10.879> this<00:02:11.150> auction

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
glass so that when I go to this auction

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.479 
glass so that when I go to this auction
I'll<00:02:11.810> have<00:02:12.019> a<00:02:12.049> piece<00:02:12.379> that<00:02:12.410> refers<00:02:13.099> to<00:02:13.370> the

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.489 
I'll have a piece that refers to the

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:16.000 
I'll have a piece that refers to the
carpeting<00:02:14.000> but<00:02:14.510> that's<00:02:14.720> made<00:02:15.410> out<00:02:15.440> of<00:02:15.620> glass

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
carpeting but that's made out of glass

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.789 
carpeting but that's made out of glass
so<00:02:16.609> that's<00:02:16.970> the<00:02:17.150> idea<00:02:17.569> and<00:02:17.840> hopefully<00:02:18.650> we'll

00:02:18.789 --> 00:02:18.799 
so that's the idea and hopefully we'll

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:20.800 
so that's the idea and hopefully we'll
raise<00:02:18.950> a<00:02:18.980> lot<00:02:19.220> of<00:02:19.280> money<00:02:19.400> for<00:02:19.760> different<00:02:20.239> so

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
raise a lot of money for different so

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.349 
raise a lot of money for different so
today<00:02:21.319> we<00:02:21.470> made<00:02:21.680> some<00:02:22.010> drinkware<00:02:22.640> glassware

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:23.359 
today we made some drinkware glassware

00:02:23.359 --> 00:02:26.009 
today we made some drinkware glassware
and<00:02:23.599> what<00:02:24.170> we<00:02:24.260> were<00:02:24.380> trying<00:02:24.590> to<00:02:24.709> do<00:02:24.889> is<00:02:25.130> use<00:02:25.430> a

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:26.019 
and what we were trying to do is use a

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:29.620 
and what we were trying to do is use a
technique<00:02:27.019> using<00:02:27.980> a<00:02:28.130> pineapple<00:02:28.639> mold<00:02:29.209> where

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
technique using a pineapple mold where

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.430 
technique using a pineapple mold where
we<00:02:29.780> drop<00:02:30.139> the<00:02:30.440> glass<00:02:31.160> that's<00:02:32.120> on<00:02:32.269> the<00:02:32.299> inside

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
we drop the glass that's on the inside

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.650 
we drop the glass that's on the inside
into<00:02:33.440> the<00:02:33.530> pineapple<00:02:34.040> mold<00:02:34.220> and<00:02:34.519> then<00:02:35.060> put<00:02:35.450> a

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
into the pineapple mold and then put a

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.520 
into the pineapple mold and then put a
cup<00:02:35.930> of<00:02:35.959> glass<00:02:36.349> on<00:02:36.680> the<00:02:36.739> outside<00:02:37.250> and<00:02:37.609> allowed

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
cup of glass on the outside and allowed

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.470 
cup of glass on the outside and allowed
bubbles<00:02:39.530> to<00:02:39.709> form<00:02:39.739> in<00:02:40.370> that<00:02:40.880> lower<00:02:41.120> piece

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
bubbles to form in that lower piece

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.629 
bubbles to form in that lower piece
while<00:02:42.079> keeping<00:02:42.500> the<00:02:42.560> texture<00:02:43.099> on<00:02:43.250> the<00:02:43.430> top

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:43.639 
while keeping the texture on the top

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:45.430 
while keeping the texture on the top
piece<00:02:43.940> so<00:02:44.630> this<00:02:44.900> has<00:02:45.019> been<00:02:45.139> an<00:02:45.290> incredible
