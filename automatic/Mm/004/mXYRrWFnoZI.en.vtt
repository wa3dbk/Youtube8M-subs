da okay that's that whole first part in
the<00:03:12.080> majority<00:03:12.500> of<00:03:12.530> the<00:03:12.650> song<00:03:12.860> the<00:03:13.670> bass<00:03:13.880> part

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
the majority of the song the bass part

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:20.140 
the majority of the song the bass part
this<00:03:16.430> is<00:03:16.610> a<00:03:16.730> and<00:03:17.000> E<00:03:17.210> together<00:03:18.790> for<00:03:19.790> two<00:03:19.940> beats

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
this is a and E together for two beats

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.520 
this is a and E together for two beats
we<00:03:20.720> just<00:03:20.900> break<00:03:21.050> that<00:03:21.200> out<00:03:22.990> you<00:03:23.990> kind<00:03:24.200> of<00:03:24.230> trip

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
we just break that out you kind of trip

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:29.500 
we just break that out you kind of trip
up<00:03:24.830> from<00:03:24.890> the<00:03:25.400> e<00:03:25.990> to<00:03:26.990> the<00:03:27.140> F<00:03:27.560> sharp<00:03:28.330> with<00:03:29.330> your

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
up from the e to the F sharp with your

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:35.720 
up from the e to the F sharp with your
pointer<00:03:29.960> and<00:03:30.200> thumb<00:03:30.260> and<00:03:31.010> back<00:03:31.970> to<00:03:32.150> the<00:03:32.210> easel

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:43.160 

like<00:03:36.730> that<00:03:39.210> it's<00:03:40.210> chromatic<00:03:40.810> from<00:03:41.110> C<00:03:41.590> sharp<00:03:41.890> D

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
like that it's chromatic from C sharp D

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:49.850 
like that it's chromatic from C sharp D
to<00:03:44.170> a<00:03:44.200> D<00:03:44.830> sharp<00:03:45.100> so<00:03:45.760> I<00:03:45.820> play<00:03:46.090> it<00:03:46.150> middle<00:03:47.370> pointer

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
to a D sharp so I play it middle pointer

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.520 
to a D sharp so I play it middle pointer
and<00:03:50.610> then<00:03:50.760> you<00:03:50.940> would<00:03:51.150> go<00:03:51.300> to<00:03:51.360> the<00:03:51.510> e<00:03:51.540> here<00:03:52.050> but

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
and then you would go to the e here but

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:58.810 
and then you would go to the e here but
we're<00:03:52.650> going<00:03:52.740> to<00:03:52.830> go<00:03:52.920> down<00:03:53.070> to<00:03:53.310> the<00:03:53.430> low<00:03:53.910> E<00:03:54.350> so

00:03:58.810 --> 00:03:58.820 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:03.520 

that's<00:03:59.820> with<00:04:00.030> the<00:04:00.180> damper<00:04:00.510> pedal<00:04:00.540> on

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:07.250 

all<00:04:04.530> right<00:04:05.150> it's<00:04:06.150> where<00:04:06.360> we<00:04:06.450> go<00:04:06.540> to<00:04:06.600> the<00:04:06.750> e<00:04:06.780> so

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
all right it's where we go to the e so

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.420 
all right it's where we go to the e so
we<00:04:07.350> got<00:04:07.500> low<00:04:07.650> E<00:04:07.680> and<00:04:08.100> then<00:04:08.190> I<00:04:08.280> hit<00:04:08.400> the<00:04:08.430> octave

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
we got low E and then I hit the octave

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:13.730 
we got low E and then I hit the octave
same<00:04:11.430> thing<00:04:11.730> for<00:04:12.360> the<00:04:12.420> E<00:04:12.450> chord<00:04:12.810> we<00:04:12.990> play<00:04:13.200> that

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:13.740 
same thing for the E chord we play that

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:16.550 
same thing for the E chord we play that
same<00:04:14.010> concept<00:04:14.310> of<00:04:14.670> going<00:04:14.910> up<00:04:15.870> to<00:04:16.049> the<00:04:16.140> 6th

getting used to playing that and playing
the<00:07:19.270> one<00:07:20.050> after<00:07:20.350> another<00:07:20.380> like<00:07:23.760> because

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:24.760 
the one after another like because

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:27.240 
the one after another like because
you'll<00:07:24.940> hit<00:07:25.180> wrong<00:07:25.600> notes<00:07:25.900> at<00:07:26.110> first<00:07:26.380> you

you'll hit wrong notes at first you

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:32.370 
you'll hit wrong notes at first you
gotta<00:07:27.510> jump<00:07:28.510> up<00:07:28.720> like<00:07:29.110> that

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:32.380
