00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:06.850
 hello welcome to my channel is the 

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:10.120
 first time I 'm going to do this 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:14.160
 I'm going to change the crystal 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.160
 from my iphone forest 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.920
 the first thing that we are going to remove 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:25.010
 I already have two small screws that 

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:25.010
 they come with me the crystal 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.820
 well you have a series of tools 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:34.020
 okay 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:43.160
 then we are going to remove the two screws 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:45.680
 what do you have here 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:48.030
 I would remove the cover you can put 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:51.420
 remove the screws 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:54.120
 of the manzanita pull up 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.910
 in the lid it will come out 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.290
 simply 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.290
 since they have is like this 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:03.870
 I recommend before everything 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:07.870
 to do 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.500
 the figure of him 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:13.310
 mobile 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.310
 in this way 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.700
 the accounts that have the iphone 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.670
 they are listed 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.760
 here with lead around to do 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.410
 one 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.410
 and here does the other 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:31.079
 after those boxes 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.580
 you are going to number 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:44.810
 They are like 15 screws 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:47.869
 you are going to list 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:51.310
 the 1 the 2 the 3 the 4 until the 14 and 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:51.310
 put a square in front 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:59.030
 yes, what is it for? 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:01.240
 so that each screw that 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:04.570
 get out of here 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:07.049
 as you put the number as here 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.049
 I have it 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.320
 here these are they are the screws 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:17.380
 below where the charger enters where 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:19.420
 connect you I put the one on 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:22.170
 one is going to go here then they look for a 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.170
 piece of lliurex 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:30.980
 here I have the 1 I put the screw 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:33.459
 and if they see it 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.459
 Y 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:40.480
 we put a little gray 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.480
 why do not miss them 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.480
 mons 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:59.420
 remember that this one will not be one 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:02.440
 shape 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.440
 that went like this 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.880
 so 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.409
 let's 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.560
 remove the screw 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.780
 of the abbot of the pile 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.480
 although he will do this 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:50.659
 this 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:00.140
 It was 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:02.630
 the one next to the 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:06.500
 of the battery 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:08.680
 what was this 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:12.659
 it's a screw 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.659
 and I'm going to put the number 2 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:23.840
 in the part where we draw the part 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:27.430
 that we draw the cell phone I'm going to do 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.430
 the shape of the battery 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:44.360
 here 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.360
 I'm going to put 2 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.860
 it's a little 

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:57.249
 i 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:05:00.009
 in notebooks I have the screw number 2 

00:04:57.249 --> 00:05:02.639
 and in the figure I put him where he does not remove 

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:02.639
 in 12 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:08.540
 now 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:13.580
 we're 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.580
 another screw 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:30.550
 and if we put the number 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:51.349
 repeat it the other screw here 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:56.930
 and I put the number 3 

00:05:54.310 --> 00:06:00.130
 and logically 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:00.130
 in my figure here 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:06.750
 and what is here 

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:08.820
 I'm going to put the number 

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:10.830
 3 

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:13.500
 and so there will be no failure where they will go 

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:15.720
 the screws putting the juries in the 

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:18.690
 screws in each square 

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:20.880
 the next video that I'm going to show you 

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:23.529
 when all the screws are already 

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:25.460
 removed ok 

00:06:23.529 --> 00:06:29.870
 remember 

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:32.900
 make 22 phone figures one here 

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:35.090
 with here and make numbering is from 1 to 

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:39.580
 15 and put a small square in front of each 

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:41.889
 number to put the screws of each 

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:43.389
 one that we are going to remove 

00:06:41.889 --> 00:06:46.680
 in the next video when they have 

00:06:43.389 --> 00:06:49.680
 all the empty screws 

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:49.680
 we will continue
