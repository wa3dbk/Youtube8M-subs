00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.020 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.630 

now<00:00:37.020> most<00:00:37.260> jump<00:00:37.590> training<00:00:37.950> programs<00:00:38.340> only

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
now most jump training programs only

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.430 
now most jump training programs only
focus<00:00:39.030> on<00:00:39.149> one<00:00:39.420> area<00:00:39.660> of<00:00:39.899> improving<00:00:40.260> your

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
focus on one area of improving your

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.900 
focus on one area of improving your
vertical<00:00:40.559> leap<00:00:40.860> and<00:00:41.550> that's<00:00:41.730> usually

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
vertical leap and that's usually

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.310 
vertical leap and that's usually
improving<00:00:42.420> your<00:00:42.510> strength<00:00:42.660> or<00:00:43.020> your<00:00:43.110> power

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
improving your strength or your power

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.020 
improving your strength or your power
but<00:00:43.980> there's<00:00:44.129> lots<00:00:44.340> of<00:00:44.489> things<00:00:44.670> that<00:00:44.760> go<00:00:45.000> into

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
but there's lots of things that go into

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.389 
but there's lots of things that go into
improving<00:00:45.719> your<00:00:45.780> vertical<00:00:45.960> I<00:00:46.440> like<00:00:47.100> to<00:00:47.219> call

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.160 
improving your vertical I like to call
these<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.579> four<00:00:47.730> pillars<00:00:48.480> of<00:00:48.690> improving<00:00:49.050> your

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
these the four pillars of improving your

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.439 
these the four pillars of improving your
vertical<00:00:49.649> jump<00:00:49.680> number<00:00:50.520> one<00:00:50.850> is<00:00:51.030> mobility

strength<00:00:55.020> and<00:00:55.289> number<00:00:55.649> four<00:00:55.890> is<00:00:55.920> power<00:00:56.250> today

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
strength and number four is power today

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.150 
strength and number four is power today
we're<00:00:57.360> going<00:00:57.449> to<00:00:57.539> be<00:00:57.600> talking<00:00:57.989> about<00:00:58.160> mobility

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
we're going to be talking about mobility

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.470 
we're going to be talking about mobility
of<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.309> joint<00:00:59.579> and<00:00:59.760> what<00:00:59.879> that<00:01:00.000> means<00:01:00.239> is<00:01:00.449> that

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
of the joint and what that means is that

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.000 
of the joint and what that means is that
we're<00:01:00.690> nice<00:01:00.840> and<00:01:00.870> flexible<00:01:01.680> through<00:01:01.890> our

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
we're nice and flexible through our

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.740 
we're nice and flexible through our
muscles<00:01:02.370> to<00:01:02.550> improve<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.329> range<00:01:03.510> of<00:01:03.690> motion

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
muscles to improve the range of motion

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.810 
muscles to improve the range of motion
through<00:01:04.199> our<00:01:04.320> joint<00:01:04.530> now<00:01:05.430> why<00:01:05.580> is<00:01:05.640> this

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
through our joint now why is this

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.070 
through our joint now why is this
important<00:01:06.240> why<00:01:06.360> is<00:01:06.420> it<00:01:06.600> important<00:01:06.930> to<00:01:06.990> be

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
important why is it important to be

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.510 
important why is it important to be
flexible<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:07.710> why<00:01:07.890> do<00:01:07.950> these<00:01:08.100> other<00:01:08.250> programs

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
flexible and why do these other programs

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.929 
flexible and why do these other programs
not<00:01:09.119> focus<00:01:09.510> on<00:01:09.659> flexibility<00:01:10.229> at<00:01:10.409> all<00:01:10.640> well<00:01:11.640> the

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
not focus on flexibility at all well the

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.670 
not focus on flexibility at all well the
reason<00:01:12.240> we<00:01:12.330> focus<00:01:12.510> on<00:01:12.810> flexibility<00:01:13.439> is

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
reason we focus on flexibility is

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.289 
reason we focus on flexibility is
because<00:01:13.950> that's<00:01:14.159> vital<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:14.850> getting<00:01:15.000> higher

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
because that's vital to getting higher

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.270 
because that's vital to getting higher
up<00:01:15.509> into<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.720> air<00:01:15.840> when<00:01:15.990> we<00:01:16.080> jump<00:01:16.320> we<00:01:16.650> have

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
up into the air when we jump we have

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.399 
up into the air when we jump we have
something<00:01:17.580> called<00:01:17.759> our<00:01:17.880> stretch<00:01:18.270> reflex<00:01:18.869> when

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
something called our stretch reflex when

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:20.660 
something called our stretch reflex when
we<00:01:19.500> go<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:19.680> jump<00:01:19.950> that<00:01:20.100> helps<00:01:20.369> us<00:01:20.460> get<00:01:20.610> more

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
we go to jump that helps us get more

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.030 
we go to jump that helps us get more
inches<00:01:21.270> on<00:01:21.390> our<00:01:21.509> vertical<00:01:21.869> so<00:01:22.500> when<00:01:22.650> you<00:01:22.740> bend

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
inches on our vertical so when you bend

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.469 
inches on our vertical so when you bend
down<00:01:23.280> and<00:01:23.580> get<00:01:23.670> ready<00:01:23.880> to<00:01:24.090> jump

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
down and get ready to jump

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:25.940 
down and get ready to jump
you<00:01:24.840> notice<00:01:25.110> that<00:01:25.229> there's<00:01:25.409> a<00:01:25.500> little<00:01:25.650> bit<00:01:25.799> of

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
you notice that there's a little bit of

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.070 
you notice that there's a little bit of
a<00:01:26.009> counter<00:01:26.400> movement<00:01:26.580> downward<00:01:27.270> before<00:01:27.900> we're

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
a counter movement downward before we're

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.990 
a counter movement downward before we're
able<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:28.380> spring<00:01:28.680> up<00:01:28.829> so<00:01:29.490> if<00:01:29.549> you<00:01:29.640> think<00:01:29.850> about

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
able to spring up so if you think about

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.480 
able to spring up so if you think about
the<00:01:30.150> muscles<00:01:30.360> in<00:01:30.630> our<00:01:30.720> legs<00:01:30.990> like<00:01:31.439> Springs<00:01:31.920> we

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
the muscles in our legs like Springs we

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.160 
the muscles in our legs like Springs we
have<00:01:32.610> to<00:01:32.729> stretch<00:01:33.030> them<00:01:33.299> first<00:01:33.570> in<00:01:33.780> order<00:01:34.049> for

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
have to stretch them first in order for

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.899 
have to stretch them first in order for
them<00:01:34.320> to<00:01:34.380> snap<00:01:34.710> back<00:01:35.009> together<00:01:35.189> and<00:01:35.549> give<00:01:35.729> us

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
them to snap back together and give us

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.359 
them to snap back together and give us
more<00:01:36.119> pop<00:01:36.479> up<00:01:36.780> into<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.170> air<00:01:37.320> so<00:01:38.009> if<00:01:38.130> we<00:01:38.250> can

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
more pop up into the air so if we can

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.010 
more pop up into the air so if we can
stretch<00:01:38.729> our<00:01:38.939> muscles<00:01:39.090> more<00:01:39.540> if<00:01:39.659> they're<00:01:39.810> more

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
stretch our muscles more if they're more

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.840 
stretch our muscles more if they're more
flexible<00:01:40.200> it'll<00:01:41.070> allow<00:01:41.220> us<00:01:41.400> to<00:01:41.520> create<00:01:41.820> more

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
flexible it'll allow us to create more

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.179 
flexible it'll allow us to create more
force<00:01:42.509> as<00:01:42.840> we<00:01:42.990> go<00:01:43.140> to<00:01:43.200> jump<00:01:43.560> and<00:01:43.799> get<00:01:43.920> up<00:01:44.040> into

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
force as we go to jump and get up into

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.160 
force as we go to jump and get up into
the<00:01:44.340> air<00:01:44.450> well<00:01:45.450> thanks<00:01:45.659> for<00:01:45.750> watching<00:01:45.899> the
