are<00:00:08.970> you<00:00:09.090> ready<00:00:09.300> for<00:00:09.540> some<00:00:09.690> football<00:00:10.219> when<00:00:11.219> you

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
are you ready for some football when you

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.089 
are you ready for some football when you
watch<00:00:11.610> the<00:00:11.820> big<00:00:12.000> game<00:00:12.030> you'll<00:00:13.019> see<00:00:13.380> Frank<00:00:13.830> Gore

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
watch the big game you'll see Frank Gore

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:15.980 
watch the big game you'll see Frank Gore
trucking<00:00:14.820> and<00:00:14.969> weaving<00:00:15.360> its<00:00:15.480> way<00:00:15.660> through<00:00:15.929> the

trucking and weaving its way through the

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.410 
trucking and weaving its way through the
Baltimore<00:00:16.529> defense<00:00:17.010> you<00:00:17.699> probably<00:00:18.000> won't<00:00:18.270> be

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
Baltimore defense you probably won't be

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.330 
Baltimore defense you probably won't be
thinking<00:00:18.660> about<00:00:18.990> how<00:00:19.140> physics<00:00:19.710> can<00:00:19.890> explain

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
thinking about how physics can explain

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:32.450 
thinking about how physics can explain
Frank<00:00:20.699> Gore<00:00:20.939> success<00:00:21.680> let<00:00:22.680> me<00:00:22.800> show<00:00:23.010> you<00:00:23.039> how

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.600 

hey<00:00:33.460> Richard<00:00:33.990> hey<00:00:34.990> how's<00:00:35.230> it<00:00:35.260> going<00:00:35.650> do<00:00:36.520> you

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:36.610 
hey Richard hey how's it going do you

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:38.700 
hey Richard hey how's it going do you
think<00:00:36.850> you<00:00:36.910> could<00:00:37.060> open<00:00:37.360> this<00:00:37.510> door<00:00:37.780> no<00:00:38.650> matter

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:38.710 
think you could open this door no matter

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.520 
think you could open this door no matter
how<00:00:39.040> I<00:00:39.070> ask<00:00:39.370> you<00:00:39.550> to<00:00:39.640> do<00:00:39.790> it<00:00:39.960> absolutely<00:00:40.960> okay<00:00:41.500> I

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:41.530 
how I ask you to do it absolutely okay I

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.250 
how I ask you to do it absolutely okay I
want<00:00:41.739> you<00:00:41.800> to<00:00:41.920> push<00:00:42.130> open<00:00:42.370> the<00:00:42.460> door<00:00:43.140> but<00:00:44.140> you

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:44.260 
want you to push open the door but you

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.930 
want you to push open the door but you
have<00:00:44.380> to<00:00:44.500> push<00:00:44.710> them<00:00:44.890> over<00:00:44.980> here<00:00:47.820> he's<00:00:48.820> not

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:48.940 
have to push them over here he's not

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.210 
have to push them over here he's not
going<00:00:49.120> not<00:00:49.900> going<00:00:49.960> you<00:00:50.770> probably<00:00:50.980> want<00:00:51.190> to

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:51.220 
going not going you probably want to

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.100 
going not going you probably want to
push<00:00:51.400> far<00:00:51.640> from<00:00:51.850> the<00:00:51.940> hinges<00:00:52.239> so<00:00:52.629> that's<00:00:52.809> cool

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:53.110 
push far from the hinges so that's cool

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.790 
push far from the hinges so that's cool
but<00:00:53.970> you<00:00:54.970> got<00:00:55.120> to<00:00:55.180> push<00:00:55.449> the<00:00:55.600> door<00:00:55.780> in<00:00:56.080> this

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:56.800 
but you got to push the door in this

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:04.049 
but you got to push the door in this
direction<00:00:59.940> not<00:01:00.940> going<00:01:01.300> and<00:01:01.629> do<00:01:01.870> it<00:01:02.579> and<00:01:03.579> you

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
direction not going and do it and you

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:06.660 
direction not going and do it and you
know<00:01:04.089> here's<00:01:04.479> the<00:01:04.660> cool<00:01:04.869> thing<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:06.430> physics

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:06.670 
know here's the cool thing the physics

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.120 
know here's the cool thing the physics
of<00:01:07.030> this<00:01:07.180> door<00:01:07.479> is<00:01:07.869> just<00:01:08.320> like<00:01:08.530> the<00:01:08.680> physics

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.130 
of this door is just like the physics

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.940 
of this door is just like the physics
required<00:01:09.640> to<00:01:10.540> bring<00:01:10.810> Frank<00:01:11.200> Gore<00:01:11.470> down<00:01:11.740> when

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
required to bring Frank Gore down when

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:13.859 
required to bring Frank Gore down when
he's<00:01:12.070> running<00:01:12.280> you<00:01:13.060> watch<00:01:13.270> him<00:01:13.450> he<00:01:13.540> gets<00:01:13.720> down

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:13.869 
he's running you watch him he gets down

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:15.900 
he's running you watch him he gets down
real<00:01:14.229> low<00:01:14.259> and<00:01:14.740> that<00:01:15.280> means<00:01:15.520> that<00:01:15.670> when<00:01:15.820> the

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:15.910 
real low and that means that when the

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:17.910 
real low and that means that when the
tackler<00:01:16.450> hits<00:01:16.690> him<00:01:16.899> first<00:01:17.229> of<00:01:17.380> all<00:01:17.470> it's<00:01:17.649> hard

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 
tackler hits him first of all it's hard

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.219 
tackler hits him first of all it's hard
for<00:01:18.100> the<00:01:18.190> tackler<00:01:18.700> to<00:01:19.300> hit<00:01:19.450> him<00:01:19.570> far<00:01:19.840> from<00:01:20.050> his

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:20.229 
for the tackler to hit him far from his

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:22.410 
for the tackler to hit him far from his
hinges<00:01:20.619> which<00:01:20.770> is<00:01:20.920> feet<00:01:21.340> to<00:01:21.580> get<00:01:21.729> up<00:01:21.820> to<00:01:21.970> the

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
hinges which is feet to get up to the

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.120 
hinges which is feet to get up to the
road<00:01:22.600> date<00:01:22.810> down<00:01:23.020> to<00:01:23.140> bring<00:01:23.320> them<00:01:23.440> down<00:01:23.619> and

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
road date down to bring them down and

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:25.650 
road date down to bring them down and
the<00:01:24.250> other<00:01:24.399> thing<00:01:24.430> is<00:01:24.610> it's<00:01:24.880> hard<00:01:25.149> to<00:01:25.330> hit<00:01:25.479> them

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:25.660 
the other thing is it's hard to hit them

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:27.960 
the other thing is it's hard to hit them
at<00:01:25.810> an<00:01:25.930> angle<00:01:26.050> straight<00:01:26.619> in<00:01:26.800> like<00:01:27.009> this<00:01:27.310> that's

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:27.970 
at an angle straight in like this that's

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.120 
at an angle straight in like this that's
what<00:01:28.119> makes<00:01:28.330> it<00:01:28.420> really<00:01:28.660> difficult<00:01:28.920> to<00:01:29.920> tackle

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
what makes it really difficult to tackle

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:39.800 
what makes it really difficult to tackle
Frank<00:01:30.610> Gore<00:01:30.820> wow<00:01:31.270> it's<00:01:31.720> really<00:01:31.869> interesting

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.280 

there's<00:01:40.810> also<00:01:40.930> a<00:01:41.110> lot<00:01:41.350> of<00:01:41.470> physics<00:01:41.860> in<00:01:42.240> punting

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
there's also a lot of physics in punting

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.920 
there's also a lot of physics in punting
now<00:01:44.290> a<00:01:44.320> good<00:01:44.680> punt<00:01:45.100> is<00:01:45.820> one<00:01:46.180> that<00:01:46.330> goes<00:01:46.479> a<00:01:46.540> long

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:46.930 
now a good punt is one that goes a long

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.649 
now a good punt is one that goes a long
way<00:01:47.140> down<00:01:47.320> the<00:01:47.380> field<00:01:47.880> it<00:01:48.880> also<00:01:49.060> has<00:01:49.360> a<00:01:49.390> long

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:49.659 
way down the field it also has a long

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:52.740 
way down the field it also has a long
hang<00:01:50.020> time<00:01:50.350> that<00:01:51.040> allows<00:01:51.310> the<00:01:51.460> defenders<00:01:52.060> to

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
hang time that allows the defenders to

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.840 
hang time that allows the defenders to
get<00:01:52.899> all<00:01:53.020> the<00:01:53.170> way<00:01:53.229> down<00:01:53.470> and<00:01:53.770> cover<00:01:54.520> the<00:01:54.700> guy

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
get all the way down and cover the guy

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.460 
get all the way down and cover the guy
that<00:01:55.060> catches<00:01:55.270> the<00:01:55.630> part<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:57.250> physics<00:01:57.820> of

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 
that catches the part the physics of

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.039 
that catches the part the physics of
trajectories<00:01:59.470> work<00:02:00.310> this<00:02:00.520> way<00:02:00.759> when<00:02:01.690> you<00:02:01.780> punt

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:02.049 
trajectories work this way when you punt

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:06.450 
trajectories work this way when you punt
the<00:02:02.170> ball<00:02:02.200> at<00:02:02.470> a<00:02:02.530> low<00:02:02.680> angle<00:02:03.060> it<00:02:04.060> goes<00:02:04.270> up<00:02:05.460> comes

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
the ball at a low angle it goes up comes

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.380 
the ball at a low angle it goes up comes
down<00:02:06.820> it's<00:02:07.569> not<00:02:07.780> in<00:02:07.899> the<00:02:08.019> air<00:02:08.170> very<00:02:08.440> long<00:02:09.390> punt

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
down it's not in the air very long punt

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.009 
down it's not in the air very long punt
the<00:02:10.539> ball<00:02:10.569> at<00:02:11.080> a<00:02:11.350> high<00:02:11.709> angle<00:02:12.569> goes<00:02:13.569> much

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:14.019 
the ball at a high angle goes much

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:17.400 
the ball at a high angle goes much
higher<00:02:14.050> it's<00:02:14.680> in<00:02:14.860> the<00:02:14.950> air<00:02:15.069> a<00:02:15.100> long<00:02:15.400> time<00:02:16.410> but

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
higher it's in the air a long time but

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.690 
higher it's in the air a long time but
again<00:02:17.709> it<00:02:17.830> doesn't<00:02:18.010> go<00:02:18.250> far<00:02:18.459> down<00:02:18.670> the<00:02:18.819> field

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
again it doesn't go far down the field

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.990 
again it doesn't go far down the field
if<00:02:21.700> you<00:02:22.000> punt<00:02:22.269> the<00:02:22.390> ball<00:02:22.420> at<00:02:22.660> a<00:02:22.720> 45<00:02:23.260> degree<00:02:23.290> in

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
if you punt the ball at a 45 degree in

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.020 
if you punt the ball at a 45 degree in
now<00:02:25.000> the<00:02:25.060> ball<00:02:25.510> stays<00:02:25.930> up<00:02:26.170> much<00:02:26.860> longer<00:02:27.190> and

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
now the ball stays up much longer and

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.050 
now the ball stays up much longer and
goes<00:02:28.690> much<00:02:29.049> farther<00:02:29.290> down<00:02:29.709> and<00:02:30.280> in<00:02:30.610> that<00:02:30.760> way

down the field and cover the pun to
tackle<00:02:36.549> the<00:02:36.670> guy<00:02:36.819> that<00:02:37.030> catches
