00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.350
 general questions we are glad 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.609
 Here we are again today I would tell me about the legendary Nordschleife and 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.980
 within 24 hours 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.130
 The Mini Challenge started under this exception event and we were 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.130
 close up 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.280
 Pure racing 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.660
 the Nordschleife provides 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.510
 Med different demands on man and machine than normal sprint distances 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.720
 although the doctors are not otherwise at home on sprint routes 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.370
 The Nordschleife was just as good for the agile front-wheel drive 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:57.130
 we have visited the second lady Kathi King in 40 man strong in the world 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:59.590
 and wanted to know for sure 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:04.360
 In fact, Medina Haddad Jannis bonds among the men on the 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.420
 Nordschleife even completely alone 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.000
 why pothole demanded Panther some of it if you do not in Erfurt 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.759
 you should think well if you want to call 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:15.619
 the offer assumes that the one or the other driver or the one given by the ARD 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:19.090
 Driver one thing, the company explained it in the future 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.690
 Nordschleife is simply something very special 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:25.730
 how did it go for the stars like Pamela Kruppa say no 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.390
 Sunday evening in class 8 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.390
 if I have a few units now 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.620
 You are now active in motorsport for the seventh season 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:55.690
 Proteins good placements clearly show that you are among the top breaks 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:57.070
 Girls heard 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:58.990
 Hogan should go the journey 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.530
 Clearly, only a lot of bad passes are expected to have been appointed 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.350
 Plenty of a center in Detroit 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.010
 not always something smaller 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.139
 but just relieved he said he was at work 

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:10.789
 it says on the market 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.789
 he is too old, we are keeping our fingers crossed 

00:02:16.779 --> 00:02:20.429
 and in the next episode, the statements continue where the Mini Challenge is around 

00:02:20.429 --> 00:02:23.499
 23 7 and 24 7 June starts 

00:02:27.429 --> 00:02:30.429
 we'll see each other and now 

00:02:36.429 --> 00:02:38.699
