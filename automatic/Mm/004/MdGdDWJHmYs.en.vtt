can tell that by my surprising amount of
diamond<00:00:15.989> tools<00:00:16.340> but<00:00:17.340> that's<00:00:17.789> because<00:00:18.090> I'm

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
diamond tools but that's because I'm

some<00:00:21.720> items<00:00:22.199> or<00:00:22.529> crafts<00:00:23.039> things<00:00:23.279> I'm<00:00:23.580> not<00:00:23.939> sure

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
some items or crafts things I'm not sure

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.179 
some items or crafts things I'm not sure
but<00:00:24.269> the<00:00:24.419> first<00:00:24.630> one<00:00:24.900> is<00:00:25.529> going<00:00:25.740> to<00:00:25.800> be<00:00:25.949> on

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
but the first one is going to be on

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.400 
but the first one is going to be on
trapdoors<00:00:26.789> because<00:00:27.150> as<00:00:27.720> you<00:00:27.869> can<00:00:27.990> see<00:00:28.140> up<00:00:28.259> in

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
trapdoors because as you can see up in

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.859 
trapdoors because as you can see up in
the<00:00:28.439> top<00:00:28.560> left<00:00:28.949> corner<00:00:29.189> one<00:00:29.970> point-six<00:00:30.269> just

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
the top left corner one point-six just

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.640 
the top left corner one point-six just
came<00:00:31.019> out<00:00:31.199> and<00:00:32.270> hatches<00:00:33.270> or<00:00:33.510> trap<00:00:34.140> doors<00:00:34.380> are

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:34.650 
came out and hatches or trap doors are

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.060 
came out and hatches or trap doors are
pretty<00:00:34.920> confusing<00:00:35.490> to<00:00:36.030> some<00:00:36.210> people<00:00:36.510> so<00:00:36.750> I

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.070 
pretty confusing to some people so I

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.200 
pretty confusing to some people so I
already<00:00:38.070> have<00:00:38.220> a<00:00:38.250> couple<00:00:38.580> made<00:00:38.880> but<00:00:39.030> I'm<00:00:39.090> going

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
already have a couple made but I'm going

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.310 
already have a couple made but I'm going
to<00:00:39.270> make<00:00:39.360> a<00:00:39.390> few<00:00:39.600> more<00:00:39.720> so<00:00:39.960> I<00:00:39.990> can<00:00:40.080> show<00:00:40.230> you

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
to make a few more so I can show you

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.490 
to make a few more so I can show you
this<00:00:40.560> is<00:00:40.620> how<00:00:40.800> you<00:00:40.830> craft<00:00:41.100> them<00:00:41.310> I<00:00:42.500> don't

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
this is how you craft them I don't

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.420 
this is how you craft them I don't
really<00:00:43.620> need<00:00:43.800> too<00:00:43.920> many<00:00:44.010> because<00:00:44.280> I<00:00:44.340> already

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
really need too many because I already

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.530 
really need too many because I already
have<00:00:44.640> all<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.850> stuff<00:00:45.030> I<00:00:45.150> want<00:00:45.300> to<00:00:45.330> show<00:00:45.390> you

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:45.540 
have all the stuff I want to show you

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:46.910 
have all the stuff I want to show you
built<00:00:45.750> but<00:00:46.170> that's<00:00:46.320> how<00:00:46.380> you<00:00:46.440> make<00:00:46.620> them<00:00:46.800> you

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
built but that's how you make them you

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.450 
built but that's how you make them you
get<00:00:47.040> two<00:00:47.540> per<00:00:48.540> six<00:00:49.440> blocks<00:00:49.740> of<00:00:49.920> lumber<00:00:50.190> and<00:00:50.310> I'm

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
get two per six blocks of lumber and I'm

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.530 
get two per six blocks of lumber and I'm
actually<00:00:50.580> going<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:50.880> turn<00:00:51.030> down<00:00:51.060> my<00:00:51.210> render

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:51.540 
actually going to turn down my render

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.570 
actually going to turn down my render
innocency<00:00:51.930> real<00:00:52.080> quick<00:00:52.260> I<00:00:52.500> wasn't<00:00:53.460> recording

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:53.580 
innocency real quick I wasn't recording

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.030 
innocency real quick I wasn't recording
before<00:00:54.120> so<00:00:54.330> I<00:00:54.360> didn't<00:00:54.630> have<00:00:54.750> to<00:00:54.930> and<00:00:55.170> this<00:00:55.860> is

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:56.040 
before so I didn't have to and this is

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.400 
before so I didn't have to and this is
when<00:00:56.310> you<00:00:56.400> place<00:00:56.640> them<00:00:56.990> grab<00:00:57.990> them<00:00:58.110> down<00:00:58.230> in<00:00:58.350> my

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
when you place them grab them down in my

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.110 
when you place them grab them down in my
hopper<00:00:58.710> right<00:00:59.100> here<00:00:59.870> they<00:01:00.870> actually<00:01:02.000> go<00:01:03.000> on

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
hopper right here they actually go on

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.430 
hopper right here they actually go on
the<00:01:03.210> bottom<00:01:03.390> of<00:01:03.630> the<00:01:03.720> block<00:01:03.900> even<00:01:04.290> if<00:01:04.379> you

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:04.440 
the bottom of the block even if you

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:05.360 
the bottom of the block even if you
place<00:01:04.650> it<00:01:04.680> from<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:05.010> top

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:05.370 
place it from the top

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.700 
place it from the top
so<00:01:05.489> as<00:01:05.700> you<00:01:05.850> can<00:01:05.970> see<00:01:06.150> down<00:01:06.330> here<00:01:06.690> it'll<00:01:07.470> go<00:01:07.620> on

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
so as you can see down here it'll go on

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.560 
so as you can see down here it'll go on
the<00:01:07.830> bottom<00:01:08.100> of<00:01:08.220> there<00:01:08.400> and<00:01:09.150> actually<00:01:09.450> the

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
the bottom of there and actually the

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:10.880 
the bottom of there and actually the
fastest<00:01:09.870> way<00:01:09.990> to<00:01:10.020> destroy<00:01:10.410> the<00:01:10.530> message<00:01:10.650> to

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
fastest way to destroy the message to

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.710 
fastest way to destroy the message to
destroy<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.400> block<00:01:11.610> they're<00:01:11.820> attached<00:01:12.000> to<00:01:12.030> no

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
destroy the block they're attached to no

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.320 
destroy the block they're attached to no
go<00:01:12.900> away<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.700> even<00:01:14.700> if<00:01:14.790> you<00:01:14.850> place<00:01:15.060> it<00:01:15.090> from

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
go away and even if you place it from

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.899 
go away and even if you place it from
the<00:01:15.420> top<00:01:18.440> of<00:01:19.440> a<00:01:19.530> block<00:01:19.770> it'll<00:01:20.220> still<00:01:20.610> go<00:01:20.760> on<00:01:20.880> the

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
the top of a block it'll still go on the

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.420 
the top of a block it'll still go on the
bottom<00:01:21.180> no<00:01:21.390> matter<00:01:21.570> what<00:01:21.750> and<00:01:21.930> when<00:01:22.890> you<00:01:23.010> left

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
bottom no matter what and when you left

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.480 
bottom no matter what and when you left
click<00:01:23.700> or<00:01:23.850> right<00:01:23.909> click<00:01:24.090> them<00:01:25.100> they<00:01:26.100> open<00:01:26.370> and

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
click or right click them they open and

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.280 
click or right click them they open and
close<00:01:26.670> so<00:01:26.940> you<00:01:26.970> can<00:01:27.270> use<00:01:27.420> these<00:01:27.570> for<00:01:27.840> obviously

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
close so you can use these for obviously

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.320 
close so you can use these for obviously
a<00:01:28.380> variety<00:01:28.800> of<00:01:28.830> things<00:01:29.070> it's<00:01:29.790> like<00:01:29.909> basically

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:30.330 
a variety of things it's like basically

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.480 
a variety of things it's like basically
a<00:01:30.479> vertical<00:01:31.229> door<00:01:31.590> not<00:01:32.159> a<00:01:32.190> vertical

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
a vertical door not a vertical

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.310 
a vertical door not a vertical
horizontal<00:01:32.580> door<00:01:33.120> these<00:01:33.840> are<00:01:33.900> some<00:01:34.140> of<00:01:34.260> the

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
horizontal door these are some of the

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.550 
horizontal door these are some of the
things<00:01:34.530> I've<00:01:34.770> built<00:01:35.220> with<00:01:35.430> it<00:01:36.350> this<00:01:37.350> is

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
things I've built with it this is

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.860 
things I've built with it this is
basically<00:01:38.070> an<00:01:38.400> entrance<00:01:38.790> to<00:01:39.030> a<00:01:39.060> house<00:01:39.360> from<00:01:39.780> a

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:39.870 
basically an entrance to a house from a

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:41.570 
basically an entrance to a house from a
roof<00:01:40.110> obviously<00:01:40.680> this<00:01:40.860> is<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.040> ground<00:01:41.280> but

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:41.580 
roof obviously this is the ground but

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:42.980 
roof obviously this is the ground but
this<00:01:41.820> applies<00:01:42.120> to<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.360> same<00:01:42.570> thing<00:01:42.780> if<00:01:42.900> you're

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
this applies to the same thing if you're

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.780 
this applies to the same thing if you're
on<00:01:43.080> the<00:01:43.170> roof<00:01:43.290> one<00:01:43.740> way<00:01:43.890> to<00:01:43.950> do<00:01:44.159> it<00:01:44.310> is<00:01:44.430> to<00:01:44.640> have

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
on the roof one way to do it is to have

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.340 
on the roof one way to do it is to have
a<00:01:44.970> block<00:01:45.240> actually<00:01:45.600> sticking<00:01:45.900> up<00:01:46.140> and

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
a block actually sticking up and

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.610 
a block actually sticking up and
attached<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.520> hatch<00:01:48.299> or<00:01:48.720> trap<00:01:49.260> door<00:01:49.409> there

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:49.620 
attached the hatch or trap door there

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.560 
attached the hatch or trap door there
and<00:01:49.799> you<00:01:50.760> can<00:01:50.909> see<00:01:51.060> you<00:01:51.180> want<00:01:51.270> to<00:01:51.360> put<00:01:51.510> the

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
and you can see you want to put the

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:52.730 
and you can see you want to put the
ladder<00:01:51.720> on<00:01:51.870> the<00:01:51.900> opposite<00:01:52.290> side<00:01:52.500> that<00:01:52.650> it

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
ladder on the opposite side that it

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.070 
ladder on the opposite side that it
opens<00:01:53.010> in<00:01:53.130> you<00:01:53.430> can<00:01:53.580> just<00:01:53.610> want<00:01:54.030> run<00:01:54.659> right

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080 
opens in you can just want run right

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.780 
opens in you can just want run right
into<00:01:55.260> the<00:01:55.350> ladder<00:01:55.500> and<00:01:55.830> you'll<00:01:55.979> go<00:01:56.130> right<00:01:56.340> out

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
into the ladder and you'll go right out

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.420 
into the ladder and you'll go right out
and<00:01:56.820> you<00:01:57.090> can<00:01:57.240> close<00:01:57.450> it<00:01:57.479> on<00:01:58.440> otherwise<00:01:59.010> to<00:01:59.310> do

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
and you can close it on otherwise to do

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.370 
and you can close it on otherwise to do
this<00:01:59.580> have<00:01:59.970> a<00:02:00.000> block<00:02:00.450> empty<00:02:00.750> here<00:02:00.990> it<00:02:01.290> opens

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
this have a block empty here it opens

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.100 
this have a block empty here it opens
that<00:02:01.650> direction<00:02:02.299> and<00:02:03.299> my<00:02:03.510> happens<00:02:03.750> is<00:02:03.869> you

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
that direction and my happens is you

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.740 
that direction and my happens is you
just<00:02:04.409> press<00:02:04.740> back<00:02:05.430> of<00:02:05.610> them<00:02:05.700> this<00:02:06.479> one's<00:02:06.659> a

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
just press back of them this one's a

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:07.789 
just press back of them this one's a
little<00:02:06.840> bit<00:02:07.020> more<00:02:07.049> difficult<00:02:07.440> I<00:02:07.500> don't<00:02:07.680> like

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
little bit more difficult I don't like

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.559 
little bit more difficult I don't like
it<00:02:07.920> as<00:02:08.009> much<00:02:08.039> because<00:02:08.849> you<00:02:09.029> have<00:02:09.060> to<00:02:09.239> like<00:02:09.389> turn

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
it as much because you have to like turn

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.220 
it as much because you have to like turn
around<00:02:09.810> and<00:02:09.959> stuff<00:02:10.139> but

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
around and stuff but

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.619 
around and stuff but
yeah<00:02:11.650> so<00:02:12.520> that's<00:02:12.730> like<00:02:12.910> how<00:02:13.209> you<00:02:13.270> could<00:02:13.480> use<00:02:13.510> it

00:02:13.619 --> 00:02:13.629 
yeah so that's like how you could use it

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:16.410 
yeah so that's like how you could use it
as<00:02:13.810> a<00:02:14.110> door<00:02:14.410> to<00:02:14.709> an<00:02:14.830> actual<00:02:15.099> building<00:02:15.489> you<00:02:16.300> can

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
as a door to an actual building you can

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:17.729 
as a door to an actual building you can
also<00:02:16.540> make<00:02:16.780> this<00:02:17.170> is<00:02:17.290> probably<00:02:17.530> the<00:02:17.620> coolest

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:17.739 
also make this is probably the coolest

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:23.339 
also make this is probably the coolest
thing<00:02:20.310> drawbridges<00:02:21.370> and<00:02:22.330> there<00:02:22.840> is<00:02:22.959> a<00:02:22.989> couple

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:23.349 
thing drawbridges and there is a couple

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:25.320 
thing drawbridges and there is a couple
flaws<00:02:23.620> in<00:02:23.890> making<00:02:24.129> a<00:02:24.190> drawbridge<00:02:24.580> first<00:02:25.120> one

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
flaws in making a drawbridge first one

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.180 
flaws in making a drawbridge first one
being<00:02:25.540> if<00:02:25.840> you<00:02:26.140> don't<00:02:26.470> have<00:02:26.620> a<00:02:26.650> roof<00:02:26.920> that's

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
being if you don't have a roof that's

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.100 
being if you don't have a roof that's
why<00:02:27.340> I<00:02:27.400> do<00:02:27.459> have<00:02:27.640> a<00:02:27.670> roof<00:02:27.910> and<00:02:28.720> this<00:02:28.840> is<00:02:28.930> open

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
why I do have a roof and this is open

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:30.900 
why I do have a roof and this is open
it's<00:02:29.830> like<00:02:29.920> a<00:02:29.950> door<00:02:30.190> you<00:02:30.370> can<00:02:30.400> walk<00:02:30.550> along

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
it's like a door you can walk along

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.570 
it's like a door you can walk along
right<00:02:31.300> here

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
right here

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.540 
right here
another<00:02:33.580> problem<00:02:33.819> is<00:02:34.590> not<00:02:35.590> to<00:02:35.830> need<00:02:35.950> sad<00:02:36.190> steel

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
another problem is not to need sad steel

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.710 
another problem is not to need sad steel
on<00:02:36.760> steel<00:02:37.110> trap<00:02:38.110> doors<00:02:38.319> otherwise<00:02:39.569> you<00:02:40.569> do

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
on steel trap doors otherwise you do

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:41.100 
on steel trap doors otherwise you do
that

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
that

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:44.759 
that
interesting<00:02:42.099> manually<00:02:42.790> obviously<00:02:43.569> voids<00:02:44.560> the

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769 
interesting manually obviously voids the

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:46.710 
interesting manually obviously voids the
hole<00:02:45.099> you<00:02:45.519> can't<00:02:45.760> get<00:02:45.940> into<00:02:46.180> my<00:02:46.299> house<00:02:46.480> now

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
hole you can't get into my house now

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.620 
hole you can't get into my house now
thing<00:02:48.390> so<00:02:49.390> that<00:02:49.750> needs<00:02:49.930> to<00:02:50.049> be<00:02:50.079> fixed<00:02:50.410> but

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
thing so that needs to be fixed but

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.509 
thing so that needs to be fixed but
that's<00:02:52.630> that's<00:02:52.930> the<00:02:53.290> concept<00:02:53.680> if<00:02:53.950> you<00:02:54.099> had

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:54.519 
that's that's the concept if you had

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:56.039 
that's that's the concept if you had
steel<00:02:54.849> ones<00:02:55.090> that<00:02:55.360> couldn't<00:02:55.540> be<00:02:55.630> opened<00:02:55.930> by

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:56.049 
steel ones that couldn't be opened by

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:58.190 
steel ones that couldn't be opened by
hand<00:02:56.200> that's<00:02:56.500> how<00:02:56.590> you<00:02:56.650> would<00:02:56.769> make<00:02:56.980> a

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
hand that's how you would make a

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.800 
hand that's how you would make a
drawbridge<00:03:00.030> and<00:03:01.030> here's<00:03:01.269> something<00:03:01.510> that<00:03:01.660> I

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
drawbridge and here's something that I

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.270 
drawbridge and here's something that I
don't<00:03:01.959> know<00:03:02.140> how<00:03:02.230> useful<00:03:02.410> this<00:03:02.709> is<00:03:02.769> by<00:03:03.010> fells

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
don't know how useful this is by fells

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.270 
don't know how useful this is by fells
pretty<00:03:03.489> cool<00:03:03.670> I<00:03:04.450> call<00:03:05.019> it<00:03:05.170> a<00:03:05.290> trapdoor<00:03:05.829> ladder

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
pretty cool I call it a trapdoor ladder

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:12.360 
pretty cool I call it a trapdoor ladder
you<00:03:06.849> open<00:03:07.060> that<00:03:10.319> and<00:03:11.319> you<00:03:11.739> can<00:03:11.860> almost<00:03:12.010> use<00:03:12.160> it

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
you open that and you can almost use it

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:17.550 
you open that and you can almost use it
as<00:03:12.459> a<00:03:12.489> ladder<00:03:12.790> and<00:03:13.060> to<00:03:13.209> go<00:03:13.329> down<00:03:15.720> I<00:03:16.720> don't<00:03:17.019> know

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
as a ladder and to go down I don't know

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:18.780 
as a ladder and to go down I don't know
why<00:03:17.799> you'd<00:03:17.950> want<00:03:17.980> to<00:03:18.130> use<00:03:18.190> this<00:03:18.340> instead<00:03:18.579> of<00:03:18.639> a

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
why you'd want to use this instead of a

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.360 
why you'd want to use this instead of a
ladder<00:03:19.000> but<00:03:19.269> it's<00:03:19.690> cooler<00:03:20.019> and<00:03:20.319> my<00:03:20.680> also<00:03:20.889> mobs

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
ladder but it's cooler and my also mobs

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.039 
ladder but it's cooler and my also mobs
can<00:03:21.609> be<00:03:21.760> a<00:03:21.790> fan<00:03:22.000> of<00:03:22.180> it<00:03:22.359> like<00:03:22.510> they<00:03:22.660> can<00:03:22.840> climb

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:23.049 
can be a fan of it like they can climb

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:26.069 
can be a fan of it like they can climb
up<00:03:23.109> regular<00:03:23.980> ladders<00:03:24.340> they<00:03:24.609> actually<00:03:25.030> can<00:03:25.900> do

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:26.079 
up regular ladders they actually can do

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:29.009 
up regular ladders they actually can do
that<00:03:26.319> annoyingly<00:03:27.630> like<00:03:28.630> so<00:03:28.780> if<00:03:28.900> you're

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:29.019 
that annoyingly like so if you're

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:30.210 
that annoyingly like so if you're
standing<00:03:29.230> right<00:03:29.500> here<00:03:29.530> and<00:03:29.680> they<00:03:29.829> walk<00:03:30.040> they

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
standing right here and they walk they

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:31.650 
standing right here and they walk they
could<00:03:30.489> technically<00:03:31.000> climb<00:03:31.269> up<00:03:31.420> the<00:03:31.510> line

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
could technically climb up the line

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.150 
could technically climb up the line
impossible<00:03:32.560> for<00:03:32.769> them<00:03:32.889> to<00:03:32.920> climb<00:03:33.160> like<00:03:33.310> this

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
impossible for them to climb like this

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.440 
impossible for them to climb like this
so<00:03:36.160> I<00:03:36.190> thought<00:03:36.430> those<00:03:36.970> are<00:03:37.090> just<00:03:37.180> some<00:03:37.329> of<00:03:37.359> the

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
so I thought those are just some of the

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:38.970 
so I thought those are just some of the
things<00:03:37.630> I've<00:03:37.840> built<00:03:38.139> with<00:03:38.200> hatches<00:03:38.709> or

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
things I've built with hatches or

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.099 
things I've built with hatches or
trapdoors<00:03:39.639> I<00:03:40.030> keep<00:03:40.389> on<00:03:40.450> calling<00:03:40.630> them<00:03:40.810> hatches

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:41.109 
trapdoors I keep on calling them hatches

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:43.140 
trapdoors I keep on calling them hatches
because<00:03:41.290> that's<00:03:41.440> what<00:03:41.620> uh<00:03:41.850> someone<00:03:42.850> told<00:03:42.940> me

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
because that's what uh someone told me

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.690 
because that's what uh someone told me
they<00:03:43.269> were<00:03:43.359> called<00:03:43.569> at<00:03:43.720> first<00:03:44.489> but<00:03:45.489> yeah<00:03:45.609> I'm

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
they were called at first but yeah I'm

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.240 
they were called at first but yeah I'm
sure<00:03:45.880> you<00:03:45.970> can<00:03:46.120> use<00:03:46.269> these<00:03:46.450> ideas<00:03:47.079> in<00:03:47.380> more

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
sure you can use these ideas in more

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.160 
sure you can use these ideas in more
complicated<00:03:48.609> things<00:03:49.120> to<00:03:49.600> make<00:03:49.750> the<00:03:49.870> in<00:03:49.959> more

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170 
complicated things to make the in more

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.509 
complicated things to make the in more
elaborate<00:03:50.620> traps<00:03:51.250> or<00:03:52.920> you<00:03:53.920> know<00:03:54.040> all<00:03:54.190> sorts<00:03:54.459> of

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:54.519 
elaborate traps or you know all sorts of

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:56.970 
elaborate traps or you know all sorts of
things<00:03:55.410> and<00:03:56.410> you<00:03:56.500> can<00:03:56.650> see<00:03:56.769> here<00:03:56.950> I

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
things and you can see here I

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:57.990 
things and you can see here I
technically<00:03:57.459> shouldn't<00:03:57.639> be<00:03:57.790> able<00:03:57.849> to<00:03:57.940> walk

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
technically shouldn't be able to walk

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.940 
technically shouldn't be able to walk
under<00:03:58.389> this<00:03:58.569> because<00:03:58.900> that's<00:03:59.049> like<00:03:59.230> barely

00:03:59.940 --> 00:03:59.950 
under this because that's like barely

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.789 
under this because that's like barely
where<00:04:00.160> my<00:04:00.280> head<00:04:00.430> is<00:04:00.459> see<00:04:01.239> this<00:04:01.389> actually<00:04:01.660> in<00:04:02.650> my

00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:02.799 
where my head is see this actually in my

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:03.839 
where my head is see this actually in my
head<00:04:02.950> is<00:04:03.010> like<00:04:03.099> kind<00:04:03.280> of<00:04:03.340> going<00:04:03.549> into<00:04:03.700> the

00:04:03.839 --> 00:04:03.849 
head is like kind of going into the

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:06.059 
head is like kind of going into the
ceiling<00:04:04.239> but<00:04:04.569> maybe<00:04:05.349> that's<00:04:05.560> a<00:04:05.620> bug<00:04:05.769> I<00:04:05.920> don't

00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:06.069 
ceiling but maybe that's a bug I don't

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:07.020 
ceiling but maybe that's a bug I don't
know<00:04:06.130> hopefully<00:04:06.310> that<00:04:06.579> doesn't<00:04:06.730> get<00:04:06.880> fixed

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
know hopefully that doesn't get fixed

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.390 
know hopefully that doesn't get fixed
but<00:04:07.930> yeah<00:04:08.049> that's<00:04:08.290> my<00:04:08.560> little<00:04:08.590> tutorial<00:04:08.980> on

but yeah that's my little tutorial on
how<00:04:09.459> to<00:04:09.639> use<00:04:09.819> trapdoors<00:04:10.389> and<00:04:10.630> I<00:04:11.019> hope<00:04:11.109> you

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.260

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.980 
how to use trapdoors and I hope you
liked<00:04:11.440> it<00:04:11.560> bye
