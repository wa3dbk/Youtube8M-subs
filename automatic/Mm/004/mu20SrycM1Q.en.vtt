00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 hello to all the boys who would have come 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.660
 in this new assassin's video 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.059
 creed unity finally after a thousand thousand 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.849
 years back on this game than on 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.170
 you really liked channel guys 

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:16.500
 very much when I proposed you months 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.539
 so now let's go back to 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.130
 this game with a helix in fracture 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.140
 practice are secondary missions 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.789
 rather nice and above all 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.910
 boys completing this fracture 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.490
 erics I can finally get or at least 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.349
 I believe the dress of altair in such a way 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.000
 to finally get to the canal 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.520
 one of the most requested videos from true in 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.570
 absolute or cazzeggiano precisely with 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.879
 the altair dress 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.770
 so let's play guys and here we are 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.840
 so as you can see 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.000
 we say that the setting is always 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.550
 fantastic in my opinion is in practice 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.590
 we will have to save a murderer who is 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.960
 stuck in time better then and the 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.610
 fracture helix then boyfriend them 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.190
 we must in practice recover in all 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.629
 these data those who have played since 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.640
 sex inscriptions that already have it 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.469
 they will know but I have to say it anyway 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.600
 those who might have played john 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.430
 really very little or otherwise not 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.380
 I obviously have not tried it 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.590
 I would like to remind you of mine 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.850
 channel you find about a hundred 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.030
 assassin's creed unity video 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.830
 published in November 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.780
 December I really did it 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.670
 so many that I also did a real e 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.409
 own work on the whole history of 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.060
 game for which guys i feel 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.310
 obviously in duty to advise you of 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.040
 look at that work just because it really is 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.180
 It was one of the walk- throughs that I did 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.490
 let's say I enjoyed it more 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.320
 register to play with you because 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.490
 really for a long time I waited 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.290
 assassin's creed unity and so 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.970
 finally play it and part two world 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.990
 group was really a thrill 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.880
 immense 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.030
 meanwhile between a fireball and 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.369
 the other we are recovering a lot of 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:50.610
 let's see if I can launch myself 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.619
 very well as you see some some 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.659
 data to recover them I have to stay 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.219
 I can't catch them they do n't have me 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.009
 pecked he is trying today because he didn't 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:01.170
 run away from here absolutely can also 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.180
 little time to do everything 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.320
 serves therefore I must also succeed to 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.450
 move 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.280
 look, there are also ghosts here 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.560
 that show us precisely that in the past 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.580
 this took place in this place 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.230
 battle 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.950
 let's see if I can recover all 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:19.050
 this stuff ok other acts from this side 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.580
 and above all boys remember 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.700
 follow me on my facebook page 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:26.250
 because there I think I'll let you know 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:28.650
 when the video about the will arrive 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.480
 fuck with the dress of altair for 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.040
 which guys I recommend follow me 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.640
 on the facebook page you will find the link 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.320
 description then in the meantime I see a 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.850
 killer wagon that was rolling over 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.800
 I don't know for what reason obviously 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:43.410
 fireballs did their duty 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:46.230
 we will see to take this escape of 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.010
 water now immediately however is therefore ce 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.990
 we did it 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.420
 here we know where the murderer sin 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:53.610
 that I am dying here 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.770
 let's see if I can reach it 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.420
 so we recover other data is unfortunately 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:00.540
 boys really miss very few 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:03.660
 seconds so now I prefer to go 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:06.420
 from my killer to recover we see 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.570
 a little fact is then released but now 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:11.040
 however, we absolutely must launch ourselves 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:13.020
 collect other data Okay guys do not 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.750
 I can do it otherwise I fail here 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:17.670
 however, many are fast 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.530
 Go Throw Yourself Over That Way 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:23.760
 rather strange and now we can escape 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:25.680
 Pro launch so we did it 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.320
 people safe no man's land 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.269
 so guys flying trophy unlocked e 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:33.209
 look at how much data but above all 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:34.830
 even those things are book yes I don't know 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.250
 if it's money but I have absolutely none 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.320
 idea 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.870
 so guys can now precisely 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.100
 return to our world or paris 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.930
