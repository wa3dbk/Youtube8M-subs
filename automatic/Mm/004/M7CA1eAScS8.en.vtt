on the west hand side of the circle
there<00:01:00.680> at<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.890> third<00:01:02.250> one<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:03.359> third<00:01:03.390> one<00:01:03.930> I

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
there at the third one the third one I

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.090 
there at the third one the third one I
think<00:01:04.140> is<00:01:04.830> over<00:01:05.430> here<00:01:06.119> on<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.990> side<00:01:07.500> there<00:01:07.979> we

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
think is over here on the side there we

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.730 
think is over here on the side there we
go<00:01:08.250> on<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.490> speaker<00:01:09.180> or<00:01:09.390> next<00:01:10.020> to<00:01:10.110> a<00:01:10.140> speaker<00:01:10.560> on

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
go on a speaker or next to a speaker on

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.630 
go on a speaker or next to a speaker on
like<00:01:11.159> a<00:01:11.390> barrel<00:01:12.390> there<00:01:13.200> so<00:01:14.070> just<00:01:14.280> directly

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
like a barrel there so just directly

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.340 
like a barrel there so just directly
south<00:01:15.030> of<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.900> second<00:01:16.530> one<00:01:16.740> there<00:01:17.369> you<00:01:17.520> go<00:01:18.350> now

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
south of the second one there you go now

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
to do a little bit of jumping to get to

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.560 
to do a little bit of jumping to get to
it<00:01:23.490> you<00:01:24.450> need<00:01:24.570> to<00:01:24.659> go<00:01:24.750> up<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.170> side<00:01:25.560> not<00:01:26.159> here

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570 
it you need to go up the side not here

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.380 
it you need to go up the side not here
up<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.840> side<00:01:28.080> here<00:01:28.710> so<00:01:28.909> from<00:01:29.909> where<00:01:30.060> you<00:01:30.150> walk

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
up the side here so from where you walk

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.270 
up the side here so from where you walk
in<00:01:30.600> walk<00:01:30.840> up<00:01:31.020> here<00:01:31.439> and<00:01:31.650> then<00:01:31.770> you'll<00:01:31.920> see<00:01:32.130> the

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
in walk up here and then you'll see the

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.249 
in walk up here and then you'll see the
wee<00:01:32.460> in<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:32.880> distance<00:01:33.270> on<00:01:33.420> that<00:01:33.450> box<00:01:33.840> and<00:01:34.140> you

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
wee in the distance on that box and you

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.460 
wee in the distance on that box and you
need<00:01:34.560> to<00:01:34.650> jump<00:01:34.920> across<00:01:35.310> there<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:36.540> so<00:01:37.350> it's

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
need to jump across there and so it's

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.499 
need to jump across there and so it's
that's<00:01:37.650> number<00:01:37.860> four<00:01:38.280> and<00:01:38.549> that<00:01:38.579> is<00:01:38.939> located

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
that's number four and that is located

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.069 
that's number four and that is located
there<00:01:40.759> there<00:01:41.759> you<00:01:41.850> go<00:01:42.030> number<00:01:42.810> five<00:01:43.049> is

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
there there you go number five is

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.190 
there there you go number five is
directly<00:01:43.590> in<00:01:43.710> front<00:01:43.950> of<00:01:44.070> that<00:01:44.570> it's<00:01:45.570> actually

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
directly in front of that it's actually

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.990 
directly in front of that it's actually
um<00:01:48.290> perhaps<00:01:49.290> funny<00:01:49.560> it's<00:01:50.159> actually<00:01:50.520> up<00:01:50.700> here

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
um perhaps funny it's actually up here

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.359 
um perhaps funny it's actually up here
but<00:01:51.540> it<00:01:51.630> turned<00:01:51.869> in<00:01:51.990> today<00:01:52.110> before<00:01:52.649> I<00:01:52.829> found<00:01:53.220> it
