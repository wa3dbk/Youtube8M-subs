the benefit of collaborating the two

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.450 
the benefit of collaborating the two
diets<00:03:21.410> instead<00:03:21.740> of<00:03:21.830> sticking<00:03:21.980> to<00:03:22.190> one<00:03:22.310> or<00:03:22.430> the

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:22.460 
diets instead of sticking to one or the

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:24.910 
diets instead of sticking to one or the
other<00:03:22.640> or<00:03:22.880> just<00:03:23.000> get<00:03:23.210> more<00:03:23.360> options<00:03:23.680> and<00:03:24.680> we
