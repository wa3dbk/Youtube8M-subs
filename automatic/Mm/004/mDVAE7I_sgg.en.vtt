00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:33.080 
it's going to be a little bit bigger

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.900 
it's going to be a little bit bigger
than<00:00:33.200> the<00:00:33.320> negev<00:00:33.560> card<00:00:33.860> and<00:00:34.100> I'm<00:00:34.370> just<00:00:34.640> using

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:34.910 
than the negev card and I'm just using

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.810 
than the negev card and I'm just using
that<00:00:35.060> ruler<00:00:35.480> to<00:00:35.660> make<00:00:35.810> diagonal<00:00:36.170> lines<00:00:36.820> to

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:37.820 
that ruler to make diagonal lines to

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.240 
that ruler to make diagonal lines to
make<00:00:38.090> the<00:00:38.270> roof<00:00:38.560> so<00:00:39.560> I<00:00:39.590> cut<00:00:39.829> everything<00:00:40.040> out

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:40.250

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:49.490 
take that to outline the roof I'm just

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:51.210 
take that to outline the roof I'm just
going<00:00:49.670> to<00:00:49.700> extend<00:00:50.000> the<00:00:50.270> line<00:00:50.450> a<00:00:50.480> little<00:00:50.660> bit

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:51.220 
going to extend the line a little bit

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:54.190 
going to extend the line a little bit
create<00:00:52.220> another<00:00:52.310> line<00:00:52.760> and<00:00:53.090> then<00:00:53.360> make

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:54.200 
create another line and then make

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.970 
create another line and then make
another<00:00:54.440> diagonal<00:00:54.980> line<00:00:55.160> and<00:00:55.630> help<00:00:56.830> make<00:00:57.830> it

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:57.980 
another diagonal line and help make it

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.910 
another diagonal line and help make it
straight<00:00:58.010> or<00:00:58.340> by<00:00:58.460> using<00:00:58.640> my<00:00:58.820> ruler<00:00:59.180> that<00:00:59.920> piece

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
straight or by using my ruler that piece

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.800 
straight or by using my ruler that piece
was<00:01:01.070> also<00:01:01.400> folded<00:01:01.850> so<00:01:02.060> that<00:01:02.240> when<00:01:02.420> I<00:01:02.450> cut<00:01:02.720> it

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:02.810 
was also folded so that when I cut it

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:04.869 
was also folded so that when I cut it
out<00:01:02.930> i<00:01:02.990> get<00:01:03.290> two<00:01:03.470> pieces<00:01:03.650> already<00:01:04.010> and<00:01:04.489> glue

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:04.879 
out i get two pieces already and glue

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:07.090 
out i get two pieces already and glue
that<00:01:05.150> together<00:01:05.710> then<00:01:06.710> I'm<00:01:06.830> going<00:01:06.979> to<00:01:07.009> take

glitter on and I did the same thing to
the<00:03:54.530> front<00:03:55.530> side<00:03:55.770> so<00:03:56.700> then<00:03:56.850> I<00:03:56.940> just<00:03:56.970> cut<00:03:57.330> two

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
the front side so then I just cut two

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.820 
the front side so then I just cut two
slits<00:03:57.810> run<00:03:58.260> it<00:03:58.410> back<00:03:58.580> and<00:04:00.320> this<00:04:01.320> is<00:04:01.470> so<00:04:01.590> that<00:04:01.770> I

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.830 
slits run it back and this is so that I

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:05.600 
slits run it back and this is so that I
can<00:04:01.950> slide<00:04:02.430> in<00:04:02.610> a<00:04:02.880> ribbon<00:04:03.330> to<00:04:04.230> be<00:04:04.380> able<00:04:04.620> to<00:04:04.860> sort

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
can slide in a ribbon to be able to sort

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:13.280 
can slide in a ribbon to be able to sort
