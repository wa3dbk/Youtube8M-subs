numbers at the speed of 20 numbers per
second<00:00:17.730> this<00:00:18.450> is<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:18.779> absolute<00:00:18.930> fastest

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:19.860 
second this is the absolute fastest

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:21.800 
second this is the absolute fastest
possible<00:00:20.009> system<00:00:20.610> and<00:00:20.759> was<00:00:21.090> designed<00:00:21.330> by<00:00:21.660> a

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
possible system and was designed by a

subject<00:00:26.789> I<00:00:27.000> just<00:00:27.840> thought<00:00:27.990> I'll<00:00:28.109> create

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
subject I just thought I'll create

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.080 
subject I just thought I'll create
another<00:00:28.680> video<00:00:29.070> to<00:00:29.160> spread<00:00:29.430> the<00:00:29.730> word<00:00:29.760> with

another video to spread the word with

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.330 
another video to spread the word with
this<00:00:30.240> concept<00:00:30.510> and<00:00:30.900> give<00:00:31.349> a<00:00:31.470> proper<00:00:31.859> tutorial

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
this concept and give a proper tutorial

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.479 
this concept and give a proper tutorial
because<00:00:33.090> whilst<00:00:33.660> never<00:00:34.080> did<00:00:34.590> explain<00:00:34.739> his

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
because whilst never did explain his

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.420 
because whilst never did explain his
concept<00:00:36.030> in<00:00:36.150> this<00:00:36.300> video<00:00:36.629> it<00:00:37.170> took<00:00:37.710> me<00:00:37.769> quite<00:00:38.220> a

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
concept in this video it took me quite a

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.070 
concept in this video it took me quite a
long<00:00:38.610> time<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:39.150> get<00:00:39.269> the<00:00:39.420> gist<00:00:39.660> of<00:00:39.780> all<00:00:39.930> what's

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:40.080 
long time to get the gist of all what's

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.240 
long time to get the gist of all what's
going<00:00:40.290> on<00:00:40.440> and<00:00:40.620> they<00:00:40.710> didn't<00:00:41.159> quite

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
going on and they didn't quite

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.340 
going on and they didn't quite
understand<00:00:41.820> all<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.299> ins<00:00:42.420> and<00:00:42.510> outs<00:00:42.720> so<00:00:43.320> I

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
understand all the ins and outs so I

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.689 
understand all the ins and outs so I
thought<00:00:43.680> I<00:00:43.739> created<00:00:44.159> more<00:00:44.339> step-by-step

00:00:44.689 --> 00:00:44.699 
thought I created more step-by-step

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:48.860 
thought I created more step-by-step
tutorial<00:00:45.710> to<00:00:46.710> help<00:00:46.739> you<00:00:47.070> all<00:00:47.190> out<00:00:47.870> anyway

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
tutorial to help you all out anyway

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.479 
tutorial to help you all out anyway
let's<00:00:49.170> crack<00:00:49.500> on<00:00:49.530> with<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.860> explanation<00:00:50.070> of

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
let's crack on with the explanation of

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.789 
let's crack on with the explanation of
how<00:00:50.610> this<00:00:50.790> system<00:00:51.000> works<00:00:51.210> as<00:00:51.659> you<00:00:52.470> can<00:00:52.589> see

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:52.799 
how this system works as you can see

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:54.590 
how this system works as you can see
there's<00:00:53.040> a<00:00:53.159> spawner<00:00:53.460> placing<00:00:54.000> a<00:00:54.059> sound<00:00:54.330> blog

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
there's a spawner placing a sound blog

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.530 
there's a spawner placing a sound blog
in<00:00:54.780> a<00:00:54.930> random<00:00:55.290> position<00:00:55.739> every<00:00:56.100> tick<00:00:56.540> behind

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:57.540 
in a random position every tick behind

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.539 
in a random position every tick behind
the<00:00:57.720> sand<00:00:57.960> is<00:00:58.199> a<00:00:58.229> command<00:00:58.710> block<00:00:58.830> attached<00:00:59.369> to

00:00:59.539 --> 00:00:59.549 
the sand is a command block attached to

00:00:59.549 --> 00:01:01.430 
the sand is a command block attached to
a<00:00:59.580> fill<00:00:59.909> clock<00:01:00.210> constantly<00:01:00.479> attempting<00:01:01.049> to

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
a fill clock constantly attempting to

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.939 
a fill clock constantly attempting to
kill<00:01:01.769> a<00:01:01.949> falling<00:01:02.460> sand<00:01:02.729> entity<00:01:03.650> so<00:01:04.650> the

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
kill a falling sand entity so the

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.160 
kill a falling sand entity so the
principle<00:01:05.369> is<00:01:05.640> we<00:01:06.000> are<00:01:06.090> using<00:01:06.330> a<00:01:06.630> stats

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
principle is we are using a stats

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.679 
principle is we are using a stats
command<00:01:07.740> to<00:01:08.010> track<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.610> success<00:01:08.820> of<00:01:09.360> this

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
command to track the success of this

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.830 
command to track the success of this
kill<00:01:10.020> command<00:01:10.640> so<00:01:11.640> let<00:01:12.240> me<00:01:12.270> back<00:01:12.510> up<00:01:12.540> a<00:01:12.750> few

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
kill command so let me back up a few

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.020 
kill command so let me back up a few
steps<00:01:13.230> I<00:01:13.500> feel<00:01:14.130> I<00:01:14.160> should<00:01:14.310> give<00:01:14.610> some<00:01:14.820> more

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
steps I feel I should give some more

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.480 
steps I feel I should give some more
explanation<00:01:15.750> to<00:01:16.380> this<00:01:16.590> so<00:01:16.950> I'm<00:01:17.070> going<00:01:17.250> to<00:01:17.340> go

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
explanation to this so I'm going to go

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.720 
explanation to this so I'm going to go
quite<00:01:17.790> slowly<00:01:18.120> here<00:01:18.620> what<00:01:19.620> the<00:01:19.860> stats<00:01:20.220> command

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:20.730 
quite slowly here what the stats command

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:23.600 
quite slowly here what the stats command
allows<00:01:21.120> us<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.540> do<00:01:21.690> is<00:01:21.870> track<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.740> success<00:01:22.980> of

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
allows us to do is track the success of

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.390 
allows us to do is track the success of
a<00:01:23.970> command<00:01:24.360> block<00:01:24.480> and<00:01:24.810> store<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.890> result<00:01:26.040> in

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
a command block and store the result in

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.620 
a command block and store the result in
a<00:01:26.910> dummy<00:01:27.300> objective<00:01:28.080> on<00:01:28.260> a<00:01:28.320> player<00:01:29.150> so<00:01:30.150> you<00:01:30.480> all

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
a dummy objective on a player so you all

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.300 
a dummy objective on a player so you all
know<00:01:30.870> what<00:01:31.110> a<00:01:31.170> scoreboard<00:01:31.620> objectives<00:01:32.130> are

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
know what a scoreboard objectives are

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.980 
know what a scoreboard objectives are
and<00:01:32.340> you<00:01:32.520> all<00:01:32.640> know<00:01:32.670> they<00:01:33.030> can<00:01:33.210> store<00:01:33.480> values

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
and you all know they can store values

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.890 
and you all know they can store values
so<00:01:34.860> what<00:01:35.220> we're<00:01:35.370> doing<00:01:35.400> is<00:01:35.850> we're<00:01:36.150> saying<00:01:36.450> the

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
so what we're doing is we're saying the

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.550 
so what we're doing is we're saying the
value<00:01:37.500> is<00:01:38.330> associated<00:01:39.330> with<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.870> success<00:01:40.350> of

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
value is associated with the success of

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.670 
value is associated with the success of
a<00:01:40.830> command<00:01:41.270> so<00:01:42.270> to<00:01:42.659> give<00:01:42.810> an<00:01:42.900> example<00:01:43.200> here<00:01:43.530> I

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
a command so to give an example here I

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.500 
a command so to give an example here I
have<00:01:43.920> a<00:01:43.950> command<00:01:44.400> block<00:01:44.520> this<00:01:44.790> attempting<00:01:45.390> to

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:45.510 
have a command block this attempting to

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:48.800 
have a command block this attempting to
kill<00:01:45.750> a<00:01:45.960> nearby<00:01:46.230> boat<00:01:46.770> in<00:01:47.210> order<00:01:48.210> to<00:01:48.360> track

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
kill a nearby boat in order to track

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.290 
kill a nearby boat in order to track
this<00:01:49.050> we<00:01:49.740> first<00:01:50.070> need<00:01:50.310> to<00:01:50.340> have<00:01:50.670> a<00:01:50.850> dummy

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:51.300 
this we first need to have a dummy

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:52.780 
this we first need to have a dummy
scoreboard<00:01:51.960> objective<00:01:52.020> in<00:01:52.620> this

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 
scoreboard objective in this

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.990 
scoreboard objective in this
demonstration<00:01:53.790> I'm<00:01:54.420> calling<00:01:54.840> mine<00:01:55.050> test<00:01:55.500> 1

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
demonstration I'm calling mine test 1

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.520 
demonstration I'm calling mine test 1
this<00:01:57.000> will<00:01:57.180> be<00:01:57.330> the<00:01:57.479> objective<00:01:57.570> that<00:01:58.110> stored

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
this will be the objective that stored

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.700 
this will be the objective that stored
the<00:01:58.770> success<00:01:59.190> of<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.550> command<00:01:59.880> block<00:02:00.620> just<00:02:01.620> to

this is kind of an initialization if you

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.810 
this is kind of an initialization if you
want<00:02:50.960> anyways<00:02:51.960> when<00:02:52.590> i<00:02:52.620> set<00:02:52.950> the<00:02:53.100> objective<00:02:53.610> to

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
clock attached to this clock you will

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.770 
clock attached to this clock you will
need<00:03:11.130> a<00:03:11.160> few<00:03:11.490> command<00:03:11.880> books<00:03:12.090> so<00:03:12.270> however<00:03:12.510> many

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
need a few command books so however many

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.190 
need a few command books so however many
outcomes<00:03:13.110> you<00:03:13.620> want<00:03:13.650> in<00:03:14.160> this<00:03:14.280> random<00:03:14.490> process

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
outcomes you want in this random process

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.990

in<00:03:16.200> each<00:03:16.410> of<00:03:16.590> these<00:03:16.710> command<00:03:17.130> boxes<00:03:17.550> simply<00:03:17.970> a

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
in each of these command boxes simply a

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.540 
in each of these command boxes simply a

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
within a radius of one as you may have

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.520 
within a radius of one as you may have
guessed<00:03:23.970> these<00:03:24.450> are<00:03:24.600> the<00:03:24.690> command<00:03:25.110> box<00:03:25.320> will

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
guessed these are the command box will

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.010 
guessed these are the command box will
be<00:03:25.620> tracking<00:03:25.950> with<00:03:26.250> the<00:03:26.370> stats<00:03:26.640> command<00:03:27.030> so

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:28.020 
be tracking with the stats command so

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:30.199 
be tracking with the stats command so
you'll<00:03:28.380> need<00:03:28.560> to<00:03:28.620> create<00:03:28.950> and<00:03:29.340> initialize<00:03:29.910> a

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
you'll need to create and initialize a

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:32.800 
you'll need to create and initialize a
dummy<00:03:30.540> objective<00:03:31.110> for<00:03:31.380> each<00:03:31.590> command<00:03:32.070> block

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
dummy objective for each command block

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.870 
dummy objective for each command block
then<00:03:33.810> by<00:03:34.470> using<00:03:34.500> the<00:03:35.010> stats<00:03:35.280> command<00:03:35.700> as

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
then by using the stats command as

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.910 
then by using the stats command as
discussed<00:03:36.480> previously<00:03:36.600> you<00:03:37.590> will<00:03:37.739> need<00:03:37.890> to

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
discussed previously you will need to

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.250 
discussed previously you will need to
make<00:03:38.220> each<00:03:38.459> objective<00:03:38.700> track<00:03:39.540> the<00:03:39.930> command

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
make each objective track the command

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.800 
make each objective track the command
block<00:03:40.610> next<00:03:41.610> you<00:03:42.060> will<00:03:42.150> need<00:03:42.209> set<00:03:42.600> up<00:03:42.720> the

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
block next you will need set up the

changing the weight tag an example of
how<00:05:36.390> this<00:05:36.570> worked<00:05:36.900> is<00:05:37.140> as<00:05:37.410> follows<00:05:37.890> if<00:05:38.100> you

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:38.670 
how this worked is as follows if you

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:40.550 
how this worked is as follows if you
have<00:05:38.820> three<00:05:39.210> outcomes<00:05:39.390> each<00:05:39.990> with<00:05:40.350> a<00:05:40.410> weight

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:40.560 
have three outcomes each with a weight

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.530 
have three outcomes each with a weight
of<00:05:40.590> one<00:05:41.010> then<00:05:41.490> each<00:05:41.700> outcome<00:05:42.000> has<00:05:42.510> a
