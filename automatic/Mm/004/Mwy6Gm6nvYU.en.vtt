early 2015 MacBook Pro under OSX first

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.990 
early 2015 MacBook Pro under OSX first
let's<00:00:13.469> check<00:00:13.679> how<00:00:13.830> the<00:00:13.889> game<00:00:14.160> runs<00:00:14.400> on<00:00:14.580> low

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
let's check how the game runs on low

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.930 
let's check how the game runs on low
settings<00:00:15.540> and<00:00:15.870> with<00:00:16.650> half<00:00:16.890> of<00:00:17.130> the<00:00:17.369> native

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
settings and with half of the native

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.480 
settings and with half of the native
retina<00:00:18.300> resolution<00:00:18.840> as<00:00:19.439> you<00:00:19.619> can<00:00:19.770> see<00:00:20.010> the

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
retina resolution as you can see the

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.759 
retina resolution as you can see the
game<00:00:20.670> runs<00:00:20.910> pretty<00:00:21.150> well<00:00:21.330> around<00:00:21.930> 70<00:00:22.560> frames

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
game runs pretty well around 70 frames

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.259 
game runs pretty well around 70 frames
per<00:00:23.010> sec<00:00:23.480> 65<00:00:24.480> 75<00:00:25.369> so<00:00:26.369> it's<00:00:26.760> it's<00:00:26.970> it's<00:00:27.210> very

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
per sec 65 75 so it's it's it's very

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.750 
per sec 65 75 so it's it's it's very
playable<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:28.590> performance<00:00:29.160> seems<00:00:29.490> very

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
playable the performance seems very

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.220 
playable the performance seems very
similar<00:00:30.210> to<00:00:30.420> what<00:00:30.570> we<00:00:30.720> have<00:00:30.810> seen<00:00:31.019> in

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
similar to what we have seen in

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.650 
similar to what we have seen in
Starcraft<00:00:31.710> 2<00:00:31.890> so<00:00:32.700> if<00:00:32.820> you<00:00:32.940> have<00:00:33.059> Starcraft<00:00:33.510> 2

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
Starcraft 2 so if you have Starcraft 2

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.950 
Starcraft 2 so if you have Starcraft 2
then<00:00:33.809> you<00:00:33.960> know<00:00:34.079> what<00:00:34.320> to<00:00:34.469> expect<00:00:35.750> now<00:00:36.750> don't

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
then you know what to expect now don't

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.360 
then you know what to expect now don't
forget<00:00:37.110> that<00:00:37.320> this<00:00:37.559> game<00:00:37.800> is<00:00:37.950> still<00:00:38.129> early

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
forget that this game is still early

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.520 
forget that this game is still early
beta<00:00:38.730> so<00:00:39.360> that<00:00:39.540> could<00:00:39.719> be<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:39.930> reason<00:00:40.050> why<00:00:40.350> we

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
beta so that could be the reason why we

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.260 
beta so that could be the reason why we
sometimes<00:00:40.739> have<00:00:41.219> stuttering<00:00:41.700> during<00:00:42.149> the

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
sometimes have stuttering during the

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.750 
sometimes have stuttering during the
game<00:00:42.500> now<00:00:43.500> if<00:00:43.649> we<00:00:43.770> move<00:00:43.890> on<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.550> full

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
game now if we move on to the full

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.299 
game now if we move on to the full
native<00:00:45.360> retina<00:00:45.719> resolution<00:00:46.320> but<00:00:46.530> keeping<00:00:46.890> the

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
native retina resolution but keeping the

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.330 
native retina resolution but keeping the
same<00:00:47.579> graphical<00:00:48.510> fidelity<00:00:49.070> let<00:00:50.070> me<00:00:50.190> get

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
same graphical fidelity let me get

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.389 
same graphical fidelity let me get
around<00:00:50.489> 3035<00:00:51.449> frames<00:00:52.110> per<00:00:52.320> sec<00:00:52.559> so<00:00:52.829> about<00:00:53.100> half

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
around 3035 frames per sec so about half

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.389 
around 3035 frames per sec so about half
of<00:00:53.730> what<00:00:54.329> we<00:00:54.539> had<00:00:54.690> before<00:00:55.160> if<00:00:56.160> you<00:00:56.370> are

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
of what we had before if you are

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:57.979 
of what we had before if you are
watching<00:00:56.579> this<00:00:56.820> video<00:00:57.000> in<00:00:57.300> 60<00:00:57.719> frames<00:00:57.750> per

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
watching this video in 60 frames per

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.020 
watching this video in 60 frames per
second<00:00:58.559> then<00:00:58.739> probably<00:00:59.160> you<00:00:59.340> can<00:00:59.550> see<00:00:59.789> better

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
second then probably you can see better

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.930 
second then probably you can see better
how<00:01:00.420> it<00:01:00.649> stutters<00:01:01.649> sometimes<00:01:02.309> that's

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
how it stutters sometimes that's

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.340 
how it stutters sometimes that's
probably<00:01:03.300> because<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.600> game<00:01:03.840> is<00:01:03.989> still<00:01:04.199> not

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
probably because the game is still not

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.109 
probably because the game is still not
really<00:01:04.650> optimized<00:01:05.070> but<00:01:05.400> it<00:01:05.549> happens<00:01:05.909> much

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
really optimized but it happens much

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.300 
really optimized but it happens much
more<00:01:06.180> often<00:01:07.049> if<00:01:07.409> you<00:01:07.740> are<00:01:07.890> on<00:01:08.070> a<00:01:08.100> higher

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
more often if you are on a higher

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.580 
more often if you are on a higher
resolution<00:01:08.640> so<00:01:09.299> if<00:01:09.570> you<00:01:09.750> are<00:01:09.840> running<00:01:10.380> the

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
resolution so if you are running the

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.070 
resolution so if you are running the
game<00:01:10.770> on<00:01:11.070> retina<00:01:11.909> resolution<00:01:12.570> then<00:01:12.780> you<00:01:12.900> get

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
game on retina resolution then you get

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.910 
game on retina resolution then you get
this<00:01:13.229> all<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.710> time<00:01:13.890> every<00:01:14.670> 5<00:01:15.210> seconds<00:01:15.710> if<00:01:16.710> we

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
this all the time every 5 seconds if we

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.499 
this all the time every 5 seconds if we
increase<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.340> graphical<00:01:17.790> settings<00:01:18.000> to

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
increase the graphical settings to

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.530 
increase the graphical settings to
medium<00:01:19.049> but<00:01:19.890> keeping<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.729> half<00:01:21.180> of<00:01:21.390> the

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
medium but keeping the half of the

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.429 
medium but keeping the half of the
native<00:01:21.840> resolution<00:01:22.189> then<00:01:23.189> we<00:01:23.400> get<00:01:23.520> around

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:24.439 
native resolution then we get around

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:27.679 
native resolution then we get around
2526<00:01:25.439> frames<00:01:26.400> per<00:01:26.610> second<00:01:27.030> most<00:01:27.210> of<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.479> time

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
2526 frames per second most of the time

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.249 
2526 frames per second most of the time
some<00:01:28.530> dips<00:01:28.799> to<00:01:29.070> 22<00:01:29.780> it's<00:01:30.780> it's<00:01:31.079> pretty

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
some dips to 22 it's it's pretty

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.039 
some dips to 22 it's it's pretty
playable<00:01:31.829> I<00:01:31.979> would<00:01:32.130> say<00:01:32.390> and<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.689> game<00:01:33.840> looks

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
playable I would say and the game looks

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.230 
playable I would say and the game looks
much<00:01:34.170> better<00:01:34.530> on<00:01:35.070> medium<00:01:35.460> settings<00:01:35.909> than<00:01:36.150> it

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
much better on medium settings than it

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.870 
much better on medium settings than it
was<00:01:36.420> on<00:01:36.540> low<00:01:36.720> settings<00:01:37.229> there's<00:01:38.220> a<00:01:38.310> huge<00:01:38.549> step

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
was on low settings there's a huge step

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.990 
was on low settings there's a huge step
between<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.360> two<00:01:39.950> so<00:01:40.950> I<00:01:40.979> really<00:01:41.369> advise<00:01:41.700> to

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
between the two so I really advise to

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.389 
between the two so I really advise to
play<00:01:42.450> on<00:01:42.600> at<00:01:42.720> least<00:01:42.899> medium<00:01:43.259> settings<00:01:45.619> and<00:01:46.619> as

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
play on at least medium settings and as

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.219 
play on at least medium settings and as
you<00:01:47.579> can<00:01:47.759> see<00:01:48.000> if<00:01:48.180> there's<00:01:48.420> no<00:01:48.479> action<00:01:48.659> ongoing

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
you can see if there's no action ongoing

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.380 
you can see if there's no action ongoing
then<00:01:49.560> it's<00:01:49.829> around<00:01:50.180> 35<00:01:51.200> 37<00:01:52.200> frames<00:01:52.619> per<00:01:52.829> sec

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
then it's around 35 37 frames per sec

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:58.310 
then it's around 35 37 frames per sec
which<00:01:54.390> is<00:01:54.509> not<00:01:54.659> bad<00:01:54.930> at<00:01:55.079> all<00:01:56.570> now<00:01:57.570> if<00:01:57.869> we<00:01:58.140> keep

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
which is not bad at all now if we keep

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.109 
which is not bad at all now if we keep
the<00:01:58.530> medium<00:01:58.890> settings<00:01:59.430> but<00:01:59.700> increase<00:02:00.090> the

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
the medium settings but increase the

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:06.580 
the medium settings but increase the
resolution<00:02:00.450> to<00:02:00.990> full<00:02:01.290> HD<00:02:01.439> or<00:02:04.100> 1920<00:02:05.100> by<00:02:05.280> 1200

then<00:02:07.590> we<00:02:08.190> get<00:02:08.340> around<00:02:08.690> 1720<00:02:09.690> frames<00:02:10.259> per<00:02:10.500> sec

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
then we get around 1720 frames per sec

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.580 
then we get around 1720 frames per sec
and<00:02:11.280> the<00:02:11.970> stuttering<00:02:12.360> is<00:02:12.629> back

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
and the stuttering is back

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.430 
and the stuttering is back
and<00:02:14.040> it's<00:02:14.970> a<00:02:15.060> little<00:02:15.300> bit<00:02:15.390> slow<00:02:15.660> for<00:02:16.080> this<00:02:16.200> kind

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
and it's a little bit slow for this kind

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.170 
and it's a little bit slow for this kind
of<00:02:16.530> game

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:30.979 

yep<00:02:21.209> no<00:02:21.569> it's<00:02:21.780> stuttering<00:02:22.170> again<00:02:29.690> okay<00:02:30.690> let's

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
yep no it's stuttering again okay let's

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:32.870 
yep no it's stuttering again okay let's
check<00:02:31.200> how<00:02:31.440> the<00:02:31.500> game<00:02:31.769> runs<00:02:32.010> on<00:02:32.190> high<00:02:32.370> settings

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
check how the game runs on high settings

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.320 
check how the game runs on high settings
but<00:02:33.239> with<00:02:33.660> lower<00:02:33.870> resolution<00:02:34.370> we<00:02:35.370> changed

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
but with lower resolution we changed

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.350 
but with lower resolution we changed
back<00:02:36.630> to<00:02:36.930> half<00:02:37.410> of<00:02:37.650> the<00:02:37.940> negative<00:02:38.940> retina

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
back to half of the negative retina

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.320 
back to half of the negative retina
resolution<00:02:39.810> again<00:02:40.080> and<00:02:40.650> as<00:02:41.190> you<00:02:41.280> can<00:02:41.459> see<00:02:41.670> it

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
resolution again and as you can see it

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.789 
resolution again and as you can see it
stutters<00:02:42.930> again<00:02:44.930> so<00:02:45.930> this<00:02:46.110> game<00:02:46.260> doesn't<00:02:46.590> like

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:46.799 
stutters again so this game doesn't like

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:50.900 
stutters again so this game doesn't like
neither<00:02:47.760> the<00:02:48.470> high<00:02:49.470> resolution<00:02:49.769> need<00:02:50.519> are<00:02:50.730> the

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
neither the high resolution need are the

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.910 
neither the high resolution need are the
higher<00:02:51.180> graphical<00:02:51.720> settings<00:02:51.900> probably<00:02:52.739> it's

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
higher graphical settings probably it's

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.160 
higher graphical settings probably it's
the<00:02:53.310> memory<00:02:53.580> bandwidth<00:02:54.090> of<00:02:54.330> the<00:02:54.569> integrated

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
the memory bandwidth of the integrated

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:56.840 
the memory bandwidth of the integrated
graphics<00:02:55.410> card<00:02:55.860> which<00:02:56.100> is<00:02:56.130> causing<00:02:56.670> this

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
graphics card which is causing this

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.449 
graphics card which is causing this
stuttering<00:02:57.440> but<00:02:58.440> I'm<00:02:58.739> not<00:02:58.920> sure<00:02:59.099> and<00:02:59.280> not<00:02:59.400> a

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
stuttering but I'm not sure and not a

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:03.680 
stuttering but I'm not sure and not a
programmer<00:03:00.060> so<00:03:00.620> just<00:03:01.620> a<00:03:01.739> guess<00:03:02.330> but<00:03:03.330> we<00:03:03.540> get

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
programmer so just a guess but we get

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.750 
programmer so just a guess but we get
around<00:03:03.989> 14<00:03:04.739> 15<00:03:05.360> sometimes<00:03:06.360> 20<00:03:06.660> frames<00:03:07.260> per<00:03:07.349> sec

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
around 14 15 sometimes 20 frames per sec

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.410 
around 14 15 sometimes 20 frames per sec
it's<00:03:08.760> not<00:03:09.150> really<00:03:09.420> playable<00:03:10.640> and<00:03:11.640> finally

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
it's not really playable and finally

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.630 
it's not really playable and finally
let's<00:03:12.720> check<00:03:12.989> how<00:03:13.200> the<00:03:13.260> game<00:03:13.560> runs<00:03:13.799> on<00:03:14.130> which

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
let's check how the game runs on which

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.949 
let's check how the game runs on which
resetting<00:03:15.360> z'<00:03:15.390> and<00:03:16.640> it's<00:03:17.640> pretty<00:03:17.940> slow<00:03:18.329> we<00:03:18.780> get

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
resetting z' and it's pretty slow we get

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:23.020 
resetting z' and it's pretty slow we get
around<00:03:19.549> 1012<00:03:20.549> frames<00:03:20.850> per<00:03:21.060> sec<00:03:21.440> sometimes<00:03:22.440> 15

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
around 1012 frames per sec sometimes 15

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.470 
around 1012 frames per sec sometimes 15
but<00:03:24.030> that's<00:03:24.239> the<00:03:24.420> maximum<00:03:26.120> so<00:03:27.120> it's<00:03:27.299> totally

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
but that's the maximum so it's totally

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.199 
but that's the maximum so it's totally
unplayable

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
unplayable

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.340 
unplayable
however<00:03:30.209> the<00:03:30.540> good<00:03:30.690> thing<00:03:30.930> is<00:03:31.109> with<00:03:31.260> the

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
however the good thing is with the

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.080 
however the good thing is with the
Blizzard<00:03:31.680> games<00:03:31.709> is<00:03:32.160> that<00:03:32.370> the<00:03:32.549> frame<00:03:32.910> rates

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
Blizzard games is that the frame rates

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.990 
Blizzard games is that the frame rates
are<00:03:33.299> pretty<00:03:33.569> consistent<00:03:34.319> so<00:03:34.980> even<00:03:35.609> if<00:03:35.730> you<00:03:35.850> get

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
are pretty consistent so even if you get

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.470 
are pretty consistent so even if you get
low<00:03:36.299> frame<00:03:36.600> rates<00:03:36.810> it's<00:03:37.170> much<00:03:37.590> smoother<00:03:38.160> than

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
low frame rates it's much smoother than

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.920 
low frame rates it's much smoother than
then<00:03:39.480> if<00:03:40.350> you<00:03:40.560> would<00:03:40.680> get<00:03:40.920> dips<00:03:41.660> that's<00:03:42.660> a<00:03:42.780> good

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
then if you would get dips that's a good

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.800 
then if you would get dips that's a good
