00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.450 

all<00:00:54.120> right<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:54.480> on<00:00:55.079> top<00:00:55.260> of<00:00:55.320> that<00:00:55.469> we<00:00:56.129> can<00:00:56.280> have

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
all right and on top of that we can have

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:08.750 
all right and on top of that we can have
let's<00:00:57.120> do<00:00:57.360> a<00:00:57.660> drummer<00:00:58.050> ready<00:01:07.159> okay<00:01:08.159> so<00:01:08.580> that's

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
let's do a drummer ready okay so that's

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.810 
let's do a drummer ready okay so that's
the<00:01:08.909> idea<00:01:09.180> is<00:01:09.450> that<00:01:09.690> just<00:01:10.229> through<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:11.550> power

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
the idea is that just through the power

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.270 
the idea is that just through the power
of<00:01:11.940> midi<00:01:12.330> it's<00:01:12.750> actually<00:01:12.930> using<00:01:13.409> real<00:01:13.770> audio

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
of midi it's actually using real audio

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.219 
of midi it's actually using real audio
but<00:01:14.850> that<00:01:15.000> every<00:01:15.270> time<00:01:15.509> that<00:01:15.690> I<00:01:15.780> want<00:01:16.050> that

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
but that every time that I want that

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.230 
but that every time that I want that
sound<00:01:16.710> it's<00:01:17.009> being<00:01:17.400> pre<00:01:17.610> recorded<00:01:17.759> so<00:01:18.210> that

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
sound it's being pre recorded so that

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.149 
sound it's being pre recorded so that
I'm<00:01:18.420> telling<00:01:18.780> my<00:01:18.869> computer<00:01:19.380> every<00:01:19.950> time<00:01:20.070> that

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159

mount<00:02:08.130> on<00:02:08.360> so<00:02:09.360> the<00:02:09.509> idea<00:02:09.599> is<00:02:09.840> that<00:02:09.899> they<00:02:10.080> get

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
mount on so the idea is that they get

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.370 
mount on so the idea is that they get
all<00:02:10.440> these<00:02:10.739> sounds<00:02:11.250> all<00:02:11.370> these<00:02:11.700> samples<00:02:12.209> every

all these sounds all these samples every
every<00:02:13.380> note<00:02:13.620> so<00:02:14.130> that<00:02:14.160> if<00:02:14.400> you<00:02:14.580> were<00:02:14.730> to<00:02:14.760> not

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
play a note then it tells the computer

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.449 
sample let me show you alright so we're
gonna<00:02:33.900> take<00:02:33.989> a<00:02:34.080> second<00:02:34.379> look<00:02:34.410> at<00:02:34.680> this<00:02:35.280> I

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
gonna take a second look at this I

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:39.350 
gonna take a second look at this I
haven't<00:02:35.730> tuned<00:02:35.879> up<00:02:36.000> to<00:02:36.180> a<00:02:36.209> guitar<00:02:36.629> now<00:02:36.840> okay<00:02:37.200> so

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
haven't tuned up to a guitar now okay so

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.839 
haven't tuned up to a guitar now okay so
sounds<00:02:40.360> like<00:02:40.480> a<00:02:40.540> big<00:02:40.750> far<00:02:40.959> right<00:02:41.170> so<00:02:41.620> if<00:02:42.489> i<00:02:42.640> play

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:42.849 
sounds like a big far right so if i play

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:44.400 
sounds like a big far right so if i play
a<00:02:42.880> bad<00:02:43.180> note<00:02:43.480> it's<00:02:43.720> just<00:02:43.900> a<00:02:43.930> different<00:02:44.110> sample

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
a bad note it's just a different sample

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.360 
a bad note it's just a different sample
so<00:02:45.069> instead<00:02:45.280> of<00:02:45.340> something<00:02:45.610> like<00:02:45.670> this

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
so instead of something like this

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:53.119 
so instead of something like this
let's<00:02:48.360> play<00:02:48.510> something<00:02:48.780> like<00:02:48.870> this<00:02:51.980> they<00:02:52.980> add

00:02:53.119 --> 00:02:53.129 
let's play something like this they add

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:56.539 
let's play something like this they add
notes<00:02:53.430> so<00:02:54.180> when<00:02:54.450> I<00:02:54.480> play<00:02:55.110> a<00:02:55.409> note<00:02:55.769> that<00:02:56.220> isn't

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:56.549 
notes so when I play a note that isn't

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:59.780 
notes so when I play a note that isn't
on<00:02:56.670> the<00:02:56.790> exact<00:02:57.150> timing<00:02:57.510> in<00:02:57.959> guitar<00:02:58.560> hero<00:02:58.590> or<00:02:59.400> in

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
on the exact timing in guitar hero or in

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.149 
on the exact timing in guitar hero or in
we're<00:03:00.780> in<00:03:00.930> rock<00:03:01.200> band<00:03:01.440> or<00:03:01.709> something<00:03:01.830> it

00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:02.159 
we're in rock band or something it

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:03.740 
we're in rock band or something it
simply<00:03:02.700> tells<00:03:02.940> the<00:03:03.060> computer<00:03:03.330> real<00:03:03.720> quick

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
simply tells the computer real quick

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.690 
simply tells the computer real quick
within<00:03:04.140> this<00:03:04.230> one<00:03:04.409> second<00:03:04.829> you<00:03:05.040> guess<00:03:05.579> from

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
within this one second you guess from

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.930 
within this one second you guess from
that<00:03:05.760> to<00:03:06.720> play<00:03:06.959> a<00:03:07.200> bad<00:03:07.620> note<00:03:07.920> sample<00:03:08.459> so<00:03:08.909> that

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
that to play a bad note sample so that

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.660 
that to play a bad note sample so that
when<00:03:09.329> you're<00:03:09.510> playing<00:03:10.069> guitar<00:03:11.069> hero<00:03:11.310> and

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
when you're playing guitar hero and

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.819 
when you're playing guitar hero and
you're<00:03:12.360> not<00:03:12.510> on<00:03:12.569> point<00:03:13.049> and<00:03:13.319> your<00:03:13.440> drummer<00:03:13.709> is

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:13.829 
you're not on point and your drummer is

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:15.649 
you're not on point and your drummer is
not<00:03:13.950> on<00:03:14.069> point<00:03:14.340> and<00:03:14.579> your<00:03:15.090> bass<00:03:15.299> player<00:03:15.510> is<00:03:15.599> not

00:03:15.649 --> 00:03:15.659 
not on point and your bass player is not

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:19.430 
not on point and your bass player is not
on<00:03:15.930> point<00:03:16.200> all<00:03:16.709> these<00:03:17.150> bands<00:03:18.150> samples<00:03:18.900> start

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
on point all these bands samples start

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.110 
on point all these bands samples start
to<00:03:19.530> come<00:03:19.769> out<00:03:19.799> and<00:03:20.220> then<00:03:20.579> it<00:03:20.670> sounds<00:03:20.910> like<00:03:20.940> that

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
to come out and then it sounds like that

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.819 
to come out and then it sounds like that
that<00:03:21.329> then<00:03:21.840> it<00:03:21.930> sounds<00:03:22.140> like<00:03:22.170> that<00:03:22.379> the<00:03:22.500> band

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:22.829 
that then it sounds like that the band

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:24.830 
that then it sounds like that the band
isn't<00:03:23.430> tight<00:03:23.790> ball<00:03:24.090> because<00:03:24.299> they're<00:03:24.390> not<00:03:24.540> but

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
isn't tight ball because they're not but

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.960 
isn't tight ball because they're not but
that<00:03:24.989> the<00:03:25.530> drummer<00:03:25.859> instead<00:03:26.400> of<00:03:26.430> hitting<00:03:26.790> the

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
that the drummer instead of hitting the

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.089 
that the drummer instead of hitting the
crash<00:03:27.239> cymbal<00:03:27.720> well<00:03:28.230> you<00:03:28.560> know<00:03:28.680> make<00:03:29.069> a

00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:29.099 
crash cymbal well you know make a

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:30.890 
crash cymbal well you know make a
mistake<00:03:29.459> or<00:03:29.640> maybe<00:03:29.819> not<00:03:29.970> make<00:03:30.150> the<00:03:30.239> hit<00:03:30.420> at<00:03:30.599> all

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
mistake or maybe not make the hit at all

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.410 
mistake or maybe not make the hit at all
so<00:03:31.620> ultimately<00:03:32.129> you<00:03:32.370> really<00:03:32.819> feel<00:03:33.090> like<00:03:33.120> that

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
so ultimately you really feel like that

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.119 
so ultimately you really feel like that
you<00:03:33.659> are<00:03:33.810> playing<00:03:34.230> well<00:03:34.650> then<00:03:34.799> what's<00:03:34.980> all

00:03:35.119 --> 00:03:35.129 
you are playing well then what's all

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:37.880 
you are playing well then what's all
this<00:03:35.670> well<00:03:35.909> this<00:03:36.060> is<00:03:36.150> the<00:03:36.180> actual<00:03:36.810> tech<00:03:37.200> okay

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
this well this is the actual tech okay

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:39.949 
this well this is the actual tech okay
so<00:03:38.250> pushing<00:03:38.579> down<00:03:38.819> on<00:03:38.849> the<00:03:39.150> button<00:03:39.450> does

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
so pushing down on the button does

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:41.420 
so pushing down on the button does
nothing<00:03:40.170> other<00:03:40.500> than<00:03:40.680> tell<00:03:40.920> the<00:03:41.099> computer

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
nothing other than tell the computer

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.069 
nothing other than tell the computer
that<00:03:42.000> these<00:03:42.150> are<00:03:42.299> the<00:03:42.359> notes<00:03:42.480> that<00:03:42.690> you<00:03:42.810> want

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:43.079 
that these are the notes that you want

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:44.690 
that these are the notes that you want
to<00:03:43.140> play<00:03:43.319> but<00:03:43.859> then<00:03:44.010> when<00:03:44.099> you<00:03:44.129> actually<00:03:44.250> push

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
to play but then when you actually push

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.670 
to play but then when you actually push
down<00:03:44.970> on<00:03:45.000> this<00:03:45.329> that<00:03:45.870> actually<00:03:46.230> triggers

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
down on this that actually triggers

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.890 
down on this that actually triggers
these<00:03:46.890> notes<00:03:47.129> to<00:03:47.280> be<00:03:47.370> played<00:03:47.730> this<00:03:48.390> on<00:03:48.690> the

for pitch once for mod I'll off student

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:10.479 
for pitch once for mod I'll off student
on<00:04:03.480> pitch<00:04:03.690> so<00:04:03.900> if<00:04:04.019> I<00:04:04.079> play<00:04:04.349> the<00:04:04.859> flute<00:04:05.040> part<00:04:05.430> i

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:10.489 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:13.699 

can<00:04:11.489> easily<00:04:11.700> change<00:04:12.269> that<00:04:12.930> sound<00:04:13.319> although<00:04:13.680> i

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
can easily change that sound although i

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:16.099 
can easily change that sound although i
can<00:04:14.099> change<00:04:14.340> the<00:04:14.549> actual<00:04:14.730> audio<00:04:15.480> it's<00:04:15.900> still

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
can change the actual audio it's still

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:20.180 
can change the actual audio it's still
the<00:04:16.229> same<00:04:16.410> pre-recorded<00:04:17.130> audio<00:04:17.519> okay

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
the same pre-recorded audio okay

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:23.870 
the same pre-recorded audio okay
I'm<00:04:21.120> actually<00:04:21.330> using<00:04:21.630> a<00:04:21.930> modulation<00:04:22.710> data<00:04:23.430> in

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
I'm actually using a modulation data in

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.820 
I'm actually using a modulation data in
order<00:04:24.150> to<00:04:24.330> take<00:04:24.600> that<00:04:24.780> sound<00:04:25.140> and<00:04:25.380> bend<00:04:25.710> it

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
order to take that sound and bend it

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:29.000 
order to take that sound and bend it
down<00:04:25.890> and<00:04:26.370> bend<00:04:26.610> it<00:04:26.700> up<00:04:26.820> okay<00:04:27.510> in<00:04:28.110> real<00:04:28.560> in<00:04:28.770> real

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.010 
down and bend it up okay in real in real

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:30.530 
down and bend it up okay in real in real
time<00:04:29.220> without<00:04:29.400> having<00:04:29.820> to<00:04:29.910> get<00:04:30.150> a<00:04:30.180> whole

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:30.540 
time without having to get a whole

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.540 
time without having to get a whole
nother<00:04:30.750> sample<00:04:31.320> and<00:04:31.530> that's<00:04:31.980> what<00:04:32.160> this<00:04:32.280> does

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
nother sample and that's what this does

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:35.150 
nother sample and that's what this does
is<00:04:32.700> that<00:04:32.790> when<00:04:32.940> I<00:04:32.970> go<00:04:33.150> to<00:04:33.180> play<00:04:33.540> a<00:04:33.870> note<00:04:34.230> all<00:04:35.040> I'm

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.160 
is that when I go to play a note all I'm

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.370 
is that when I go to play a note all I'm
doing<00:04:35.220> is<00:04:35.520> I'm<00:04:35.640> bending<00:04:36.030> the<00:04:36.750> sound<00:04:37.110> using

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 
doing is I'm bending the sound using

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.550 
doing is I'm bending the sound using
modulation<00:04:38.070> but<00:04:38.730> it's<00:04:38.880> still<00:04:39.150> the<00:04:39.330> same<00:04:39.750> exact

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
modulation but it's still the same exact

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.180 
modulation but it's still the same exact
audio<00:04:40.980> sample<00:04:41.850> so<00:04:42.600> now<00:04:42.720> to<00:04:42.930> show<00:04:43.260> you<00:04:43.320> how<00:04:43.950> it

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.190 
audio sample so now to show you how it

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:46.130 
audio sample so now to show you how it
all<00:04:44.310> happens<00:04:44.730> is<00:04:44.910> instead<00:04:45.390> of<00:04:45.600> playing<00:04:45.840> on

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:46.140 
all happens is instead of playing on

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:50.510 
all happens is instead of playing on
here<00:04:46.950> and<00:04:47.130> simply<00:04:47.580> own<00:04:47.790> better<00:04:48.390> than<00:04:49.310> it<00:04:50.310> is

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 
here and simply own better than it is

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.940 
here and simply own better than it is
than<00:04:50.940> it<00:04:51.090> is<00:04:51.300> now<00:04:51.930> if<00:04:52.080> I<00:04:52.170> were<00:04:52.290> to<00:04:52.380> play<00:04:52.530> on<00:04:52.680> here

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:52.950 
than it is now if I were to play on here

00:04:52.950 --> 00:05:02.350 
than it is now if I were to play on here
it<00:04:53.130> would<00:04:53.220> sound<00:04:53.370> like<00:04:53.460> this

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:02.360 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.639 

and<00:05:03.360> there<00:05:03.599> we<00:05:03.689> have<00:05:03.719> it<00:05:03.899> it<00:05:04.169> sounds<00:05:04.409> just<00:05:04.469> like

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:04.649 
and there we have it it sounds just like

00:05:04.649 --> 00:05:06.259 
and there we have it it sounds just like
a<00:05:04.739> real<00:05:04.919> instrument<00:05:05.159> you<00:05:05.699> do<00:05:05.789> that<00:05:05.939> for<00:05:06.149> the

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:06.269 
a real instrument you do that for the

00:05:06.269 --> 00:05:08.299 
a real instrument you do that for the
bass<00:05:06.509> player<00:05:06.809> for<00:05:07.080> the<00:05:07.349> drummer<00:05:07.679> and<00:05:07.979> then

00:05:08.299 --> 00:05:08.309 
bass player for the drummer and then

00:05:08.309 --> 00:05:10.159 
bass player for the drummer and then
keep<00:05:08.519> that<00:05:08.669> vocal<00:05:08.999> line<00:05:09.119> on<00:05:09.300> top<00:05:09.569> and<00:05:09.839> it

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:10.169 
keep that vocal line on top and it

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:11.779 
keep that vocal line on top and it
really<00:05:10.349> creates<00:05:10.800> this<00:05:10.860> entire<00:05:11.399> user

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:11.789 
really creates this entire user
