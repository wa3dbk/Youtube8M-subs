00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:10.880 

Creole<00:00:08.670> days<00:00:08.820> has<00:00:09.059> a

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:10.890 
Creole days has a

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:13.049 
Creole days has a
I<00:00:10.980> planted<00:00:11.790> that<00:00:11.850> many

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:13.059 
I planted that many

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:17.810 
I planted that many
some<00:00:13.509> chips<00:00:14.580> now<00:00:15.630> finally<00:00:16.630> after<00:00:16.930> many<00:00:17.289> years

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
some chips now finally after many years

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.630 
some chips now finally after many years
some<00:00:18.820> cherries<00:00:19.330> in<00:00:19.480> addition<00:00:20.380> the<00:00:21.010> some<00:00:21.250> chips

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:21.640 
some cherries in addition the some chips

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:26.339 
some cherries in addition the some chips
used<00:00:21.970> to<00:00:22.150> be<00:00:22.300> made<00:00:22.540> with<00:00:23.130> gas<00:00:24.130> not<00:00:25.060> with<00:00:25.390> sword

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:26.349 
used to be made with gas not with sword

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:31.319 
used to be made with gas not with sword
that<00:00:26.980> son<00:00:29.309> fossil<00:00:30.309> chips<00:00:30.579> don't<00:00:30.820> sound<00:00:31.180> good

00:00:31.319 --> 00:00:31.329 
that son fossil chips don't sound good

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:35.490 
that son fossil chips don't sound good
but<00:00:31.800> but<00:00:32.800> actually<00:00:33.370> now<00:00:33.579> they<00:00:34.090> built<00:00:34.420> a<00:00:34.809> solar

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:35.500 
but but actually now they built a solar

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.799 
but but actually now they built a solar
plant<00:00:35.860> in<00:00:36.510> Modesto<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:38.760> actually<00:00:39.760> make<00:00:40.090> some

00:00:40.799 --> 00:00:40.809 
plant in Modesto to actually make some

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:44.819 
plant in Modesto to actually make some
chips<00:00:41.110> and<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:43.690> technology<00:00:44.410> that<00:00:44.590> they<00:00:44.800> use

00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:44.829 
chips and the technology that they use

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:48.889 
chips and the technology that they use
is<00:00:45.519> parabolic<00:00:46.030> choice<00:00:47.100> now<00:00:48.100> this<00:00:48.370> is<00:00:48.550> not

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
is parabolic choice now this is not

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.489 
is parabolic choice now this is not
utility<00:00:49.899> scale<00:00:50.379> this<00:00:51.370> is<00:00:51.609> more<00:00:52.499> industrial

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:53.499 
utility scale this is more industrial

00:00:53.499 --> 00:00:56.840 
utility scale this is more industrial
this<00:00:54.309> is<00:00:54.489> to<00:00:54.640> power<00:00:54.909> a<00:00:55.269> manufacturing<00:00:56.050> plant

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
this is to power a manufacturing plant

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.410 
this is to power a manufacturing plant
okay<00:00:57.879> now<00:00:58.539> furthermore<00:00:59.609> it<00:01:00.609> doesn't<00:01:01.210> generate

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.420 
okay now furthermore it doesn't generate

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:10.620 
okay now furthermore it doesn't generate
power<00:01:03.449> it<00:01:04.740> only<00:01:05.740> generates<00:01:06.280> heat<00:01:08.580> so<00:01:09.630> through

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:10.630 
power it only generates heat so through

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.750 
power it only generates heat so through
the<00:01:11.250> pipes<00:01:12.630> you<00:01:13.630> will<00:01:13.870> see<00:01:14.610> basically<00:01:15.610> they

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:15.760 
the pipes you will see basically they

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.440 
the pipes you will see basically they
collect<00:01:16.210> the<00:01:16.330> heat<00:01:17.189> and<00:01:18.189> with<00:01:18.640> that<00:01:18.880> they

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
collect the heat and with that they

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.590 
collect the heat and with that they
actually<00:01:19.899> burn<00:01:20.170> the<00:01:20.590> oil<00:01:21.520> they<00:01:22.119> heat<00:01:22.329> up<00:01:22.420> the

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
actually burn the oil they heat up the

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:29.010 
actually burn the oil they heat up the
oil<00:01:22.950> to<00:01:23.950> fry<00:01:24.670> the<00:01:25.049> potato<00:01:26.049> chips<00:01:27.299> so<00:01:28.299> when<00:01:28.840> we

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
oil to fry the potato chips so when we

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.410 
oil to fry the potato chips so when we
talk<00:01:29.289> about<00:01:29.320> solar<00:01:29.860> power<00:01:30.159> I'm<00:01:30.520> not<00:01:31.000> just

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
talk about solar power I'm not just

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.609 
talk about solar power I'm not just
talking<00:01:31.899> about<00:01:31.960> electricity<00:01:33.840> you<00:01:34.840> can<00:01:35.259> create

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:35.619 
talking about electricity you can create

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:40.950 
talking about electricity you can create
heat<00:01:36.630> why<00:01:37.630> is<00:01:37.689> he<00:01:38.020> important<00:01:39.479> let<00:01:40.479> me<00:01:40.630> meet<00:01:40.780> to

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
heat why is he important let me meet to

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.969 
heat why is he important let me meet to
Europe<00:01:41.289> process<00:01:41.920> heat<00:01:42.159> is<00:01:42.399> two-thirds<00:01:43.289> of<00:01:44.289> all

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:44.979 
Europe process heat is two-thirds of all

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:47.710 
Europe process heat is two-thirds of all
and<00:01:45.369> thus<00:01:45.700> industrial<00:01:46.689> energy<00:01:47.200> use

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
and thus industrial energy use

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:53.640 
and thus industrial energy use
here<00:01:48.700> two-thirds<00:01:49.700> of<00:01:49.910> all<00:01:50.390> the<00:01:50.570> energy<00:01:52.120> goes

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:53.650 
here two-thirds of all the energy goes

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:56.650 
here two-thirds of all the energy goes
that<00:01:54.650> industry<00:01:55.370> is<00:01:55.520> is<00:01:55.700> a<00:01:55.730> mere<00:01:55.970> of<00:01:56.060> goes<00:01:56.300> to

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:56.660 
that industry is is a mere of goes to

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:01.470 
that industry is is a mere of goes to
heat<00:01:57.050> something<00:01:58.720> okay<00:01:59.720> so<00:02:00.080> we<00:02:00.260> think<00:02:00.560> of<00:02:00.830> power

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:01.480 
heat something okay so we think of power

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:12.500 
heat something okay so we think of power
but<00:02:02.480> they<00:02:02.990> use<00:02:03.260> is<00:02:03.560> actually<00:02:03.740> in<00:02:04.250> heating

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.569
