 I made frozen cocktail and yogurt chocolate canapé with strawberry fruit brandy. 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.900
 First, make strawberry fruit brandy. 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:33.000
 Cut 150 g of strawberries, cut in half and put in a closed container. Clean the closed container thoroughly. 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 Add 400ml of Suntory Brandy VO to it, and put it so that the strawberries are soaked. Please take out the strawberries at this point. You can freeze it and cook it at a later date. 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 We make drained yogurt. Cover the colander with a paper towel, add plain yogurt (450 g) and drain overnight. 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 When you hurry up, if you put a weight on it, it will drain in 2-3 hours. 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:32.000
 The solid content is "water drain yoghurt" and the water content is whey (whey). We use both without throwing away. 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:58.000
 Chop the plate chocolate (55 g) with a knife and mix with drained yogurt. 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:19.000
 Make frozen strawberry puree and strawberry sauce. 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 Cut the pickled strawberry brandy and put it in a container, 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 Add 150g of fresh strawberries and 3 tablespoons of honey and mix in a hand blender (or mixer). 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 Once puree, put half in heat-resistant bowl. 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:24.000
 The remaining half is mixed with whey and placed in a vat, covered with a wrap and frozen. When frozen it is finished with frozen strawberry puree. 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:36.000
 Heat the heat-resistant bowl for 2 minutes in a microwave oven (500 w), then heat for 1 minute and repeat mixing 2-3 times to remove moisture and alcohol to make a strawberry sauce. 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:55.000
 Add drained yoghurt mixed with chocolate to a cracker with heaping teaspoon and sprinkle 1/2 teaspoon of strawberry sauce. Decorate the mint and you're done. 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:03.000
 Fresh and sweet with strawberry sauce, drained yogurt with chocolate and bitter sweetness goes well with fresh fruit brandy. 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:14.000
