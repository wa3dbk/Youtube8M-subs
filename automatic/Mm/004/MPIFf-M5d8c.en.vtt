algae scraper is definitely a very

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.740 
algae scraper is definitely a very
useful<00:02:39.040> little<00:02:39.370> tool<00:02:39.549> and<00:02:39.730> this<00:02:40.000> goes<00:02:40.239> double

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
useful little tool and this goes double

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.610 
useful little tool and this goes double
if<00:02:40.900> you<00:02:41.319> are<00:02:41.410> a<00:02:41.470> saltwater<00:02:42.010> at<00:02:42.280> worst<00:02:42.579> and<00:02:43.620> well

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
if you are a saltwater at worst and well

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.500 
if you are a saltwater at worst and well
I<00:02:44.859> highly<00:02:45.700> recommend<00:02:46.150> it

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
I highly recommend it

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.990 
I highly recommend it
the<00:02:47.049> only<00:02:47.200> real<00:02:47.530> negative<00:02:47.920> that<00:02:48.489> I<00:02:48.519> can<00:02:48.730> say

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
the only real negative that I can say

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.360 
the only real negative that I can say
about<00:02:49.180> it<00:02:49.389> is<00:02:49.630> because<00:02:49.930> of<00:02:50.290> the<00:02:50.380> flexibility

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
about it is because of the flexibility

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.660 
about it is because of the flexibility
of<00:02:51.489> the<00:02:51.819> razor<00:02:52.060> you<00:02:53.049> sometimes<00:02:53.980> sort<00:02:54.430> of<00:02:54.489> have

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
of the razor you sometimes sort of have

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.599 
of the razor you sometimes sort of have
to<00:02:54.880> work<00:02:55.239> if<00:02:55.569> a<00:02:55.720> bit<00:02:55.930> to<00:02:56.530> get<00:02:56.829> at<00:02:57.100> to<00:02:57.459> get

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:57.609 
to work if a bit to get at to get

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:01.379 
to work if a bit to get at to get
properly<00:02:58.060> at<00:02:58.329> the<00:02:58.500> algae<00:02:59.519> but<00:03:00.519> that's<00:03:00.700> a<00:03:01.120> small

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:01.389 
properly at the algae but that's a small

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:05.059 
that's really that's not much of an
issue<00:03:03.670> when<00:03:03.940> you<00:03:04.030> consider<00:03:04.329> the<00:03:04.540> fact<00:03:04.780> that

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
issue when you consider the fact that

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:08.670 
issue when you consider the fact that
the<00:03:06.069> articulated<00:03:06.819> joint<00:03:07.090> and<00:03:07.680> the

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
the articulated joint and the

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.650 
the articulated joint and the
double-edged<00:03:09.220> blades<00:03:09.609> I<00:03:09.910> really<00:03:10.209> lets<00:03:10.510> you

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
double-edged blades I really lets you

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.190 
double-edged blades I really lets you
get<00:03:10.900> at<00:03:11.139> almost<00:03:11.620> anywhere<00:03:12.280> in<00:03:12.340> the<00:03:12.700> tank

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
get at almost anywhere in the tank

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.930 
get at almost anywhere in the tank
no<00:03:14.200> matter<00:03:14.440> homeland<00:03:15.160> well<00:03:15.280> no<00:03:15.489> matter<00:03:15.700> where

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
no matter homeland well no matter where

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.150 
no matter homeland well no matter where
as<00:03:16.060> long<00:03:16.120> as<00:03:16.389> there's<00:03:16.599> space<00:03:16.720> for<00:03:17.139> it<00:03:17.230> to<00:03:17.950> fit

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
as long as there's space for it to fit

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:19.650 
as long as there's space for it to fit
through<00:03:18.459> like<00:03:18.730> this

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
through like this

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.000 
through like this
then<00:03:19.810> you're<00:03:20.080> going<00:03:20.230> to<00:03:20.320> be<00:03:20.410> able<00:03:20.500> to<00:03:20.680> remove

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
then you're going to be able to remove

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.590 
then you're going to be able to remove
the<00:03:21.250> algae<00:03:23.220> so<00:03:24.220> yeah<00:03:24.370> that<00:03:24.850> sums<00:03:25.240> up<00:03:25.420> what<00:03:25.570> I

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
the algae so yeah that sums up what I

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.280 
the algae so yeah that sums up what I
have<00:03:25.810> to<00:03:25.960> say<00:03:26.110> about<00:03:26.230> the<00:03:26.470> technology<00:03:27.130> is<00:03:27.220> 45

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
have to say about the technology is 45

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:36.250 
have to say about the technology is 45
thanks<00:03:29.290> for<00:03:29.440> watching

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260
