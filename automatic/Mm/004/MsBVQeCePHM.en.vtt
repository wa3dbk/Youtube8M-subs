00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.670
 good so we go for the video the 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:06.420
 last of the day with my a crack and 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.130
 red madeleine 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.889
 we will take a flap start 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.000
 now you know knitting so there 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.170
 it's a bit of a mess because 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.880
 we just made the decreases 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.470
 admitting increases wanted to do 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.029
 a scarf in general is the first 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.289
 piece what do we do so you do a 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.430
 scarf it's very simple you ride a 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.270
 number of miles as we saw 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.010
 in the first video 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.740
 then you decide to do it either 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.050
 jersey stitch in garter st and 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.400
 after you knit that so you 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.050
 knit your listening and your side the 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.070
 length you want but once 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.270
 that you have finished knitting ben it must 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.350
 still an elemental thing is 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.610
 that we will have to beat what we say 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.489
 fold back the stitches say finish your 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.860
 knit to finish your fall is saw 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.059
 that I transform myself a little bit into 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.260
 city ​​of arles has more and more 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.480
 no more kidding with knitting 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.120
 question but when there will have been seven or 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.500
 eight videos to nantua what more then you 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.460
 knit the length you votes 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.360
 richard I advise you to make 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.500
 pretty long scarves 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.360
 often we do not make them long in the beginning 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.350
 because it's drunk I abandoned you 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.610
 also advises to do so with 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.980
 needles to these big ones because that 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.510
 demotivating month and that's how we 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.579
 proceed to fold mic 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.860
 so you have your knit that is getting 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.710
 present this way you go in 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.409
 made to fold knit normally 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.930
 your first two remail as if 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.820
 it was stitches place so hop on 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.140
 go around the loop on 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:21.290
 pass on the gilberte by squeezing a 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:23.430
 little like we go around 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.560
 so now you have all your 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.750
 miles that stay on the right ebit and 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.770
 you have two on the right guilds 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.420
 on the winged left and two on the eight 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.400
 right here is how you're going to do 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.650
 you will take the mesh that is the 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.360
 more towards you the very first that 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.860
 you will knit you go to 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.720
 lift a little like that if the cards 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.740
 and that's the bread is called forgiveness you 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.390
 know more than a year but if we think 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.860
 think carefully about all the words 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.270
 we say yes it was completely 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.659
 porn so you spend your romance 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:52.229
 left under your first my you have it 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:56.390
 raised a little and you go 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:58.700
 above the second this way 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:01.380
 I remonstrated you 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:04.230
 we have a pity it's not his flow 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:08.310
 baugé sleep that goes over my 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:13.050
 first ball and I pass it below 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:16.530
 Vegetable agree I folded my 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:18.660
 first wave there I know that's so 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.870
 I have more than one there but I speak 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.970
 Arabic alone I'm obliged to forget 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:26.310
 to knit a second device 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:29.790
 in the same way in garter stitch I 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:32.340
 go around and I'm back from 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:37.350
 corn on the right high mountain I believe on 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:39.270
 elite left I pass it on hand I 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:43.640
 hand in hand that June 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:48.360
 knit everything and often and I pull it 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:52.790
 at the top and I let her go 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:56.000
 second device 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.000
 it was all 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:02.330
 I take the stitch closest to 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:06.420
 I pass my opinion left underneath 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:12.630
 I pass my my over the lack of j 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:15.410
 have between 3rd age side so I 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.410
 review in cannes 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:27.890
 but it's not thierry and not 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.970
 shoot a little bit leader not 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.400
 too much because press did 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:34.130
 demo shot a little bit too tight 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.510
 it's not pretty but a little bit anyway 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:38.360
 I tend to knit hyper 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:41.590
 flexible angela a little less it depends on 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.590
 each of them 

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:55.080
 we continue we are on the skin 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:55.080
 clear tech 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.750
 here it is here but it accelerates everything 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:00.750
 it 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.310
 separately you see girls well 

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:14.420
 you do not understand what France is 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.680
 clear us but sometimes good 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:23.810
 do not hesitate to ask questions if 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:25.100
 you have questions here but like 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:26.810
 my case for the last corn is the 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:28.280
 question that we all ask ourselves but for 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.479
 the last corn is pretty simple we have it 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.310
 obviously gfa tisot so we can not 

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:31.699
 also resume on the bottom she 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:34.550
 simply 

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:37.180
 so in fact it is that we cut this 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:39.380
 mesh there and we make a knot behind 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.620
 so I leave as if we never 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:45.229
 chopped off 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:46.729
 here I take off Newfoundland I you 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:47.630
 shows there is said that this is a film 

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:48.889
 take a good length of thread when 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:50.090
 even because it can be useful to me 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:51.470
 it's the charters we do not care but it 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:53.389
 can be useful wish a sweater for 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:55.580
 have the additional challenges for 

00:04:53.389 --> 00:05:02.660
 sew or pass so your son does 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:04.870
 like that you take off your mail and you 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:04.870
 know 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:10.490
 these are the proud ones 

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:12.980
 obviously is not 6 to the rest we do 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:14.480
 what fans and here you have 

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:17.000
 folded go wrong that is to say that your 

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:21.280
 knit will not be able to unravel and you 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.280
 you're good here are the girls
