00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:08.619 
the tilt controls then we also use the

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:10.560 
the tilt controls then we also use the
front<00:01:08.920> facing<00:01:09.340> camera<00:01:09.729> probably<00:01:10.270> call<00:01:10.450> the

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.300 
wipeout glory moment which is at the end
of<00:01:12.940> a<00:01:13.060> race<00:01:13.240> it'll<00:01:13.840> take<00:01:13.869> a<00:01:14.080> still<00:01:14.950> shot<00:01:14.979> or<00:01:15.250> a

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 
of a race it'll take a still shot or a

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.670 
of a race it'll take a still shot or a

gets<00:01:17.830> pumped<00:01:18.130> to<00:01:18.189> all<00:01:18.340> the<00:01:18.520> other<00:01:18.670> NGP<00:01:19.180> players

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
gets pumped to all the other NGP players

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.780 
gets pumped to all the other NGP players
so<00:01:19.869> when<00:01:20.020> they<00:01:20.140> finish<00:01:20.470> their<00:01:20.650> race<00:01:21.189> they<00:01:21.580> get

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:21.790 
so when they finish their race they get

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:23.399 
so when they finish their race they get
to<00:01:21.880> see<00:01:22.000> you<00:01:22.119> gloating<00:01:22.570> at<00:01:22.750> them<00:01:22.900> and<00:01:23.260> it

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:23.409 
to see you gloating at them and it

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:25.410 
to see you gloating at them and it
finally<00:01:23.619> we're<00:01:23.890> using<00:01:24.040> the<00:01:24.610> rear<00:01:24.909> camera<00:01:25.299> as

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 
finally we're using the rear camera as

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.780 
finally we're using the rear camera as
well<00:01:25.450> for<00:01:26.229> an<00:01:26.320> augmented<00:01:26.770> reality<00:01:27.100> museum<00:01:27.520> so

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:27.790 
well for an augmented reality museum so

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:29.640 
well for an augmented reality museum so
will<00:01:28.540> then<00:01:28.659> be<00:01:28.750> able<00:01:28.810> to<00:01:28.930> look<00:01:29.080> at<00:01:29.229> your<00:01:29.350> ships
