00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:22.410 
and a quarter and I need to remember

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:24.109 
and a quarter and I need to remember
that<00:01:22.530> as<00:01:22.679> this<00:01:22.830> slides<00:01:23.160> into<00:01:23.429> the<00:01:23.550> unit<00:01:23.910> with

the design of how this eyepiece is laid

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.100 
the design of how this eyepiece is laid
out<00:01:26.130> I<00:01:26.429> actually<00:01:27.090> measured<00:01:27.420> what<00:01:27.600> needs<00:01:27.810> to<00:01:27.990> be

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
out I actually measured what needs to be

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.359 
out I actually measured what needs to be
my<00:01:28.410> inside<00:01:29.030> dimensions<00:01:30.030> on<00:01:30.270> my<00:01:30.479> unit<00:01:31.369> finally

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
my inside dimensions on my unit finally

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:33.919 
my inside dimensions on my unit finally
I've<00:01:32.490> got<00:01:32.520> one<00:01:32.880> more<00:01:33.060> measurement<00:01:33.390> I<00:01:33.690> need<00:01:33.840> to

00:01:33.919 --> 00:01:33.929 
I've got one more measurement I need to

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:36.350 
I've got one more measurement I need to
figure<00:01:34.080> out<00:01:34.259> and<00:01:34.560> that's<00:01:34.979> what<00:01:35.550> distance<00:01:36.090> do<00:01:36.330> I

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
figure out and that's what distance do I

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.050 
figure out and that's what distance do I
want<00:01:36.660> my<00:01:36.869> eye<00:01:36.899> from<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.709> LCD<00:01:38.009> screen<00:01:38.160> how<00:01:38.700> long

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
want my eye from the LCD screen how long

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.570 
want my eye from the LCD screen how long
does<00:01:39.390> this<00:01:39.539> need<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:39.810> be<00:01:39.959> what<00:01:40.709> I<00:01:40.740> did<00:01:41.100> is<00:01:41.310> I

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:41.580 
does this need to be what I did is I

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.090 
does this need to be what I did is I
just<00:01:41.640> took<00:01:41.940> my<00:01:42.000> eyepiece<00:01:42.569> and<00:01:42.840> held<00:01:43.800> something

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
just took my eyepiece and held something

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.070 
just took my eyepiece and held something
with<00:01:44.310> text<00:01:44.610> up<00:01:44.729> on<00:01:44.910> it<00:01:45.060> it<00:01:45.630> may<00:01:45.750> be<00:01:45.780> different

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:46.080 
with text up on it it may be different

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.919 
with text up on it it may be different
for<00:01:46.410> you<00:01:46.500> but<00:01:46.679> I<00:01:46.740> found<00:01:47.039> five<00:01:47.610> inches<00:01:48.179> to<00:01:48.810> be

00:01:48.919 --> 00:01:48.929 
for you but I found five inches to be

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:51.050 
for you but I found five inches to be
just<00:01:49.229> about<00:01:49.500> right<00:01:49.830> for<00:01:50.369> what<00:01:50.490> I<00:01:50.520> felt<00:01:50.819> was

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
just about right for what I felt was

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.850 
just about right for what I felt was
comfortable<00:01:51.630> so<00:01:52.200> now<00:01:52.319> we're<00:01:52.470> going<00:01:52.560> to<00:01:52.619> take

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
comfortable so now we're going to take

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.770 
comfortable so now we're going to take
all<00:01:53.100> our<00:01:53.130> measurements<00:01:53.789> and<00:01:53.970> begin<00:01:54.360> to<00:01:54.509> draw

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
all our measurements and begin to draw

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.050 
all our measurements and begin to draw
out<00:01:55.050> the<00:01:55.380> design<00:01:55.770> going<00:01:56.700> off<00:01:56.910> the

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
out the design going off the

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.240 
out the design going off the
measurements<00:01:57.509> of<00:01:57.630> my<00:01:57.750> LCD<00:01:58.229> screen<00:01:58.560> I<00:01:58.709> start<00:01:59.130> by

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
measurements of my LCD screen I start by

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.790 
measurements of my LCD screen I start by
drawing<00:01:59.490> a<00:01:59.700> line<00:01:59.850> three<00:02:00.330> inches<00:02:00.600> long<00:02:00.899> now<00:02:01.770> I

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:01.800 
drawing a line three inches long now I

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.529 
drawing a line three inches long now I
find<00:02:02.220> and<00:02:02.490> Mark<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:02.849> center<00:02:02.880> point<00:02:03.420> of<00:02:03.479> that

00:02:03.529 --> 00:02:03.539 
find and Mark the center point of that

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:06.589 
find and Mark the center point of that
line<00:02:03.660> which<00:02:04.440> is<00:02:04.649> one<00:02:04.950> and<00:02:04.979> a<00:02:05.130> half<00:02:05.280> inches<00:02:05.670> from

00:02:06.589 --> 00:02:06.599 
line which is one and a half inches from

line which is one and a half inches from
that<00:02:06.630> center<00:02:07.110> point<00:02:07.319> I<00:02:07.560> draw<00:02:07.830> a<00:02:08.039> perpendicular

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
that center point I draw a perpendicular

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.630 
that center point I draw a perpendicular
line<00:02:08.970> straight<00:02:09.869> up<00:02:10.020> measuring<00:02:10.920> five<00:02:11.250> inches

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
line straight up measuring five inches

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.210 
line straight up measuring five inches
long<00:02:11.990> now<00:02:12.990> I<00:02:13.020> take<00:02:13.349> the<00:02:13.530> measurement<00:02:13.980> of<00:02:14.130> the

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220

was the measurement of the sides of my
LCD<00:03:05.510> screen<00:03:05.840> I<00:03:06.109> went<00:03:06.980> ahead<00:03:07.040> and<00:03:07.190> cut<00:03:07.370> out<00:03:07.489> our

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:07.519 
LCD screen I went ahead and cut out our

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:10.059 
LCD screen I went ahead and cut out our
top<00:03:07.970> piece<00:03:08.299> and<00:03:08.540> our<00:03:08.780> side<00:03:09.049> piece<00:03:09.379> so<00:03:09.859> I<00:03:09.920> can

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:10.069 
top piece and our side piece so I can

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:11.229 
top piece and our side piece so I can
try<00:03:10.220> to<00:03:10.250> give<00:03:10.459> you<00:03:10.519> a<00:03:10.579> better<00:03:10.730> idea<00:03:10.790> of<00:03:11.150> what

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 
try to give you a better idea of what

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:12.849 
try to give you a better idea of what

to do here quick is I'm just going to
take<00:03:22.280> the<00:03:22.430> edges<00:03:22.730> and<00:03:22.909> I'm<00:03:23.030> going<00:03:23.180> to<00:03:23.239> bevel

00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:23.569 
take the edges and I'm going to bevel

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:25.700 
take the edges and I'm going to bevel
them<00:03:23.690> with<00:03:23.870> my<00:03:24.019> knife

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:25.710

interestingly enough my calculations

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:34.330 
interestingly enough my calculations
were<00:03:32.420> slightly<00:03:32.719> off<00:03:32.870> and<00:03:33.319> I<00:03:33.379> had<00:03:33.560> to<00:03:33.709> add<00:03:33.859> in<00:03:34.129> an

were slightly off and I had to add in an
extra<00:03:34.760> piece<00:03:35.180> of<00:03:35.450> foam<00:03:35.840> right<00:03:36.530> here<00:03:36.980> in<00:03:37.310> order

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:37.549 
extra piece of foam right here in order

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:41.289 
extra piece of foam right here in order
to<00:03:37.760> make<00:03:37.939> a<00:03:37.969> snug<00:03:38.450> fit<00:03:38.480> for<00:03:39.049> the<00:03:39.140> eyepiece<00:03:40.299> now

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:41.299 
to make a snug fit for the eyepiece now

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:43.149 
to make a snug fit for the eyepiece now
I'm<00:03:41.450> going<00:03:41.599> to<00:03:41.659> take<00:03:41.870> my<00:03:42.019> flexible<00:03:42.620> foam<00:03:42.859> and

00:03:43.149 --> 00:03:43.159 
I'm going to take my flexible foam and

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:44.949 
I'm going to take my flexible foam and
cut<00:03:43.400> out<00:03:43.519> a<00:03:43.549> piece<00:03:43.849> to<00:03:44.090> go<00:03:44.239> between<00:03:44.389> the
