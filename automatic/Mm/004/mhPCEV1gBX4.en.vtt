cards<00:03:25.000> and<00:03:25.209> two<00:03:25.360> rules<00:03:25.630> of<00:03:25.810> the<00:03:25.900> game<00:03:26.080> you're

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
cards and two rules of the game you're

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.320 
cards and two rules of the game you're
either<00:03:26.650> a<00:03:26.799> bomber<00:03:27.070> trader<00:03:27.640> here's<00:03:28.030> some<00:03:28.150> five

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:28.330 
either a bomber trader here's some five

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:29.970 
either a bomber trader here's some five
equipment<00:03:28.810> cards<00:03:29.170> and<00:03:29.500> we're<00:03:29.830> going<00:03:29.950> to

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
equipment cards and we're going to

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.410 
equipment cards and we're going to
replace<00:03:30.340> ninety<00:03:30.760> percent<00:03:30.880> of<00:03:31.060> the<00:03:31.180> game<00:03:31.269> that

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
replace ninety percent of the game that

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.020 
replace ninety percent of the game that
came<00:03:31.600> with<00:03:31.780> the<00:03:31.900> first<00:03:32.110> thing<00:03:32.380> however<00:03:33.250> the

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
came with the first thing however the

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:35.759 
came with the first thing however the
stuff<00:03:34.390> that<00:03:34.570> they've<00:03:34.690> added<00:03:35.170> is<00:03:35.320> really

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:35.769 
stuff that they've added is really

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:37.800 
stuff that they've added is really
awesome<00:03:35.950> the<00:03:36.459> traitor<00:03:36.820> in<00:03:37.000> the<00:03:37.060> bomber<00:03:37.239> aspect

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
awesome the traitor in the bomber aspect

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.170 
awesome the traitor in the bomber aspect
I<00:03:37.989> think<00:03:38.019> add<00:03:38.410> another<00:03:39.010> layer<00:03:39.459> of<00:03:39.489> complexity

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
I think add another layer of complexity

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.500 
I think add another layer of complexity
to<00:03:40.329> the<00:03:40.450> game<00:03:40.600> that's<00:03:40.810> needed<00:03:41.440> because<00:03:41.920> before

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
to the game that's needed because before

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.520 
to the game that's needed because before
and<00:03:43.510> I<00:03:43.570> think<00:03:43.780> I<00:03:43.840> may<00:03:43.930> have<00:03:43.959> said<00:03:44.170> this<00:03:44.350> in<00:03:44.470> the

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
and I think I may have said this in the

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.800 
and I think I may have said this in the
review<00:03:45.310> of<00:03:45.370> the<00:03:45.519> original<00:03:45.820> game<00:03:45.850> once

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
review of the original game once

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:48.540 
review of the original game once
somebody<00:03:47.200> finds<00:03:47.560> out<00:03:47.680> who<00:03:47.830> the<00:03:47.980> agent<00:03:48.160> or<00:03:48.489> the

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:48.550 
somebody finds out who the agent or the

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:50.430 
somebody finds out who the agent or the
kingpin<00:03:49.000> is<00:03:49.150> it<00:03:49.360> snowballs<00:03:50.230> in<00:03:50.380> the

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
kingpin is it snowballs in the

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.470 
kingpin is it snowballs in the
completion<00:03:50.770> really<00:03:51.190> quick<00:03:51.459> it's<00:03:52.000> fun

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
completion really quick it's fun

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.000 
completion really quick it's fun
until<00:03:52.720> that<00:03:52.780> point<00:03:53.019> and<00:03:53.230> it's<00:03:53.409> kind<00:03:53.620> of<00:03:53.680> fun<00:03:53.860> at

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
until that point and it's kind of fun at

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:55.979 
until that point and it's kind of fun at
that<00:03:54.040> point<00:03:54.430> to<00:03:54.640> as<00:03:54.819> long<00:03:54.940> as<00:03:55.120> it's<00:03:55.269> not<00:03:55.420> you

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:55.989 
that point to as long as it's not you

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:58.020 
that point to as long as it's not you
know<00:03:56.019> overly<00:03:56.709> just<00:03:56.950> ridiculous<00:03:57.790> for<00:03:57.940> it's

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
know overly just ridiculous for it's

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:59.220 
know overly just ridiculous for it's
like<00:03:58.150> Oh<00:03:58.269> found<00:03:58.510> out<00:03:58.599> who<00:03:58.659> he<00:03:58.780> is<00:03:58.810> he's<00:03:59.049> dead

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
like Oh found out who he is he's dead

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.220 
like Oh found out who he is he's dead
but<00:04:00.129> this<00:04:00.610> game<00:04:00.790> is<00:04:00.849> like<00:04:01.180> we<00:04:01.690> know<00:04:01.900> who<00:04:02.080> the

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 
but this game is like we know who the

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:04.589 
but this game is like we know who the
agent<00:04:02.409> is<00:04:02.769> but<00:04:03.610> we<00:04:03.730> really<00:04:03.970> need<00:04:04.000> to<00:04:04.150> make<00:04:04.360> sure

00:04:04.589 --> 00:04:04.599 
agent is but we really need to make sure

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:08.190 
agent is but we really need to make sure
there's<00:04:04.810> no<00:04:05.610> there's<00:04:06.610> no<00:04:06.700> traitor<00:04:07.239> or<00:04:07.569> if

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 
there's no there's no traitor or if

there's no there's no traitor or if
you're<00:04:08.440> going<00:04:08.590> to<00:04:08.650> be<00:04:08.739> shooting<00:04:08.980> him<00:04:09.310> are<00:04:09.549> you

a<00:04:09.730> bomber<00:04:10.140> so<00:04:11.140> I<00:04:11.379> like<00:04:11.650> that<00:04:11.799> aspect<00:04:12.010> it's

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
a bomber so I like that aspect it's

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.580 
a bomber so I like that aspect it's
really<00:04:12.849> cool<00:04:13.090> and<00:04:13.390> the<00:04:13.900> equipment<00:04:14.170> car<00:04:14.470> is

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 
really cool and the equipment car is

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:16.050 
really cool and the equipment car is
added<00:04:14.980> or<00:04:15.040> actually<00:04:15.400> really<00:04:15.670> cool<00:04:15.819> themselves

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
added or actually really cool themselves

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.170 
added or actually really cool themselves
though<00:04:16.870> I<00:04:16.900> do<00:04:17.169> wish<00:04:17.739> that<00:04:18.130> they<00:04:18.850> would<00:04:19.000> release

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 
though I do wish that they would release

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.719 
though I do wish that they would release
a<00:04:19.479> pack<00:04:19.780> of<00:04:19.959> equipment<00:04:20.470> cards<00:04:20.859> that<00:04:21.519> are<00:04:21.609> like

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:21.729 
a pack of equipment cards that are like

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:23.250 
a pack of equipment cards that are like
60<00:04:22.270> of<00:04:22.389> them<00:04:22.510> or<00:04:22.660> something<00:04:22.780> I<00:04:22.930> just<00:04:23.110> want<00:04:23.229> a

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.260 
60 of them or something I just want a

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.379 
60 of them or something I just want a
stack<00:04:23.680> of<00:04:23.710> equipment<00:04:24.340> cards<00:04:24.729> to<00:04:25.150> where<00:04:25.270> you

00:04:25.379 --> 00:04:25.389 
stack of equipment cards to where you

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:26.939 
stack of equipment cards to where you
can't<00:04:25.690> count<00:04:26.020> on<00:04:26.139> getting<00:04:26.350> certain<00:04:26.710> cards

00:04:26.939 --> 00:04:26.949 
can't count on getting certain cards

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:29.909 
can't count on getting certain cards
each<00:04:27.190> game<00:04:27.460> or<00:04:27.639> whatever<00:04:28.169> but<00:04:29.169> that's<00:04:29.380> neither

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:29.919 
each game or whatever but that's neither

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:31.290 
each game or whatever but that's neither
here<00:04:30.070> nor<00:04:30.220> there<00:04:30.370> i<00:04:30.550> just<00:04:30.820> wish<00:04:30.940> it<00:04:30.970> came<00:04:31.150> with

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
here nor there i just wish it came with

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:32.969 
here nor there i just wish it came with
more<00:04:31.449> equipment<00:04:31.750> cards<00:04:32.199> however<00:04:32.560> i<00:04:32.650> think

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:32.979 
more equipment cards however i think

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:34.439 
more equipment cards however i think
this<00:04:33.100> is<00:04:33.310> something<00:04:33.490> you<00:04:33.699> need<00:04:33.729> to<00:04:33.940> pick<00:04:34.120> up<00:04:34.270> if

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:34.449 
this is something you need to pick up if

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:37.379 
this is something you need to pick up if
you<00:04:34.570> have<00:04:34.600> the<00:04:35.139> original<00:04:35.590> game<00:04:35.620> I<00:04:36.150> don't<00:04:37.150> know

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:37.389 
you have the original game I don't know

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:39.420 
you have the original game I don't know
if<00:04:37.750> newer<00:04:38.410> printings<00:04:38.860> are<00:04:38.949> going<00:04:39.070> to<00:04:39.130> include

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
if newer printings are going to include

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.460 
if newer printings are going to include
this<00:04:39.699> into<00:04:40.210> the<00:04:40.300> original<00:04:40.720> game<00:04:40.750> that's

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
this into the original game that's

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:43.770 
this into the original game that's
probably<00:04:41.830> a<00:04:42.220> way<00:04:42.970> that<00:04:43.150> I<00:04:43.180> would<00:04:43.300> take<00:04:43.630> the

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:43.780 
probably a way that I would take the

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:45.420 
probably a way that I would take the
game<00:04:43.960> you<00:04:44.169> know<00:04:44.289> just<00:04:44.560> just<00:04:44.949> have<00:04:45.100> the<00:04:45.220> base

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.430 
game you know just just have the base

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.879 
game you know just just have the base
set<00:04:45.760> and<00:04:45.940> that<00:04:46.539> it<00:04:46.780> includes<00:04:47.410> bomber<00:04:47.650> and

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:47.889 
set and that it includes bomber and

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:49.260 
set and that it includes bomber and
traders<00:04:48.280> in<00:04:48.310> there<00:04:48.580> don't<00:04:48.760> even<00:04:48.880> worry<00:04:49.210> about

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.270 
traders in there don't even worry about

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:52.020 
traders in there don't even worry about
it<00:04:49.479> being<00:04:49.690> an<00:04:49.900> expansion<00:04:50.530> but<00:04:51.160> either<00:04:51.580> way<00:04:51.850> if

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:52.030 
it being an expansion but either way if

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:53.430 
it being an expansion but either way if
you<00:04:52.150> have<00:04:52.270> the<00:04:52.389> original<00:04:52.750> definitely<00:04:53.289> pick

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:53.440 
you have the original definitely pick

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.439 
you have the original definitely pick
this<00:04:53.470> up<00:04:53.650> you<00:04:54.039> is<00:04:54.220> totally<00:04:54.669> worth<00:04:55.090> the<00:04:55.120> money

00:04:55.439 --> 00:04:55.449 
this up you is totally worth the money

00:04:55.449 --> 00:04:57.480 
this up you is totally worth the money
even<00:04:56.350> though<00:04:56.440> it<00:04:56.560> does<00:04:56.740> replace<00:04:57.099> most<00:04:57.310> the

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:57.490 
even though it does replace most the

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:59.490 
even though it does replace most the
cards<00:04:57.760> in<00:04:57.880> the<00:04:57.940> game<00:04:58.120> I<00:04:58.360> think<00:04:58.690> that<00:04:58.900> if<00:04:59.110> you've

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500 
cards in the game I think that if you've

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.620 
cards in the game I think that if you've
played<00:04:59.830> the<00:05:00.190> original<00:05:00.280> so<00:05:00.849> many<00:05:01.000> times<00:05:01.270> and

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:01.630 
played the original so many times and

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:03.000 
played the original so many times and
you<00:05:01.660> really<00:05:02.110> like<00:05:02.289> it<00:05:02.500> or<00:05:02.680> maybe<00:05:02.860> you're

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.010 
you really like it or maybe you're

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:03.930 
you really like it or maybe you're
getting<00:05:03.160> to<00:05:03.310> the<00:05:03.370> point<00:05:03.490> where<00:05:03.669> you're<00:05:03.729> burnt

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:03.940
