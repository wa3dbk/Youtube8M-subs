the rebels that their children were
dying<00:01:58.810> because<00:01:59.229> of<00:01:59.409> their<00:01:59.679> choice<00:01:59.979> to

00:02:00.589 --> 00:02:00.599 
dying because of their choice to

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:04.649 
dying because of their choice to
initiate<00:02:01.599> violence<00:02:02.549> every<00:02:03.549> district<00:02:04.090> was

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:04.659 
initiate violence every district was

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.600 

I<00:02:25.300> wonder<00:02:26.300> how<00:02:26.540> that<00:02:26.750> would<00:02:26.930> have<00:02:27.050> felt

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
I wonder how that would have felt

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.119 
I wonder how that would have felt
picking<00:02:28.610> the<00:02:28.730> kids<00:02:28.909> who<00:02:29.209> had<00:02:29.390> to<00:02:29.510> go<00:02:29.690> it<00:02:30.290> is

00:02:31.119 --> 00:02:31.129 
picking the kids who had to go it is

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:34.360 
picking the kids who had to go it is
worse<00:02:31.400> I<00:02:31.760> think<00:02:32.209> to<00:02:32.599> be<00:02:32.750> turned<00:02:33.080> over<00:02:33.319> by<00:02:33.739> your

worse I think to be turned over by your

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.000 
worse I think to be turned over by your
own<00:02:34.549> neighbors<00:02:35.080> then<00:02:36.080> have<00:02:36.319> your<00:02:36.470> name<00:02:36.709> drop

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
own neighbors then have your name drop

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:42.789 
own neighbors then have your name drop
