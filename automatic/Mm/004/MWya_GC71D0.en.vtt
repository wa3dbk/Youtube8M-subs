give you a few pointers and how to use
the<00:00:13.320> stove<00:00:14.599> basically<00:00:15.599> one<00:00:16.199> of<00:00:16.260> the<00:00:16.350> first

things you want to do when you use a
triad<00:00:17.940> stove<00:00:18.180> is<00:00:18.420> to<00:00:19.050> actually<00:00:19.199> push<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:19.890> legs

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
triad stove is to actually push the legs

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.370 
triad stove is to actually push the legs
and<00:00:20.400> usually<00:00:21.210> I<00:00:21.300> make<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:21.570> legs<00:00:21.720> straight<00:00:21.960> on

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
and usually I make the legs straight on

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.679 
and usually I make the legs straight on
the<00:00:22.529> bottom<00:00:22.830> and<00:00:23.010> I<00:00:23.550> actually<00:00:23.699> push<00:00:24.119> it<00:00:24.300> into

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
the bottom and I actually push it into

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.200 
the bottom and I actually push it into
the<00:00:25.109> ground<00:00:25.230> like<00:00:25.890> this<00:00:26.130> and<00:00:26.400> that<00:00:26.880> makes<00:00:27.119> a

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
the ground like this and that makes a

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.060 
the ground like this and that makes a
really<00:00:27.449> stable<00:00:27.750> stove<00:00:28.170> one<00:00:28.769> of<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:28.920> most

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
really stable stove one of the most

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.849 
really stable stove one of the most
common<00:00:29.369> mistakes<00:00:29.460> I<00:00:29.849> see<00:00:30.199> out<00:00:31.199> in<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:31.560> field

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
common mistakes I see out in the field

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.639 
common mistakes I see out in the field
is<00:00:32.160> people<00:00:32.700> have<00:00:33.180> a<00:00:33.239> tendency<00:00:33.420> to<00:00:33.899> put<00:00:34.290> a<00:00:34.350> stove

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
is people have a tendency to put a stove

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.030 
is people have a tendency to put a stove
I<00:00:35.010> like<00:00:35.700> to<00:00:35.820> try<00:00:36.030> out<00:00:36.180> of<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.360> Triad<00:00:36.600> XE<00:00:37.020> on<00:00:38.010> a

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
I like to try out of the Triad XE on a

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.340 
I like to try out of the Triad XE on a
table<00:00:38.520> and<00:00:38.670> stove<00:00:39.660> when<00:00:39.840> you<00:00:39.899> go<00:00:39.989> to<00:00:40.050> put<00:00:40.200> your

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
table and stove when you go to put your

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.450 
table and stove when you go to put your
pot<00:00:40.500> on<00:00:41.270> you<00:00:42.270> could<00:00:42.660> upset<00:00:43.170> it<00:00:43.379> it<00:00:44.129> makes<00:00:44.309> a

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
pot on you could upset it it makes a

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.400 
pot on you could upset it it makes a
little<00:00:44.579> more<00:00:44.730> precarious<00:00:45.120> then<00:00:45.690> if<00:00:46.230> you

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
little more precarious then if you

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.810 
little more precarious then if you
actually<00:00:46.530> anchor<00:00:47.070> in<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.309> ground<00:00:47.610> so<00:00:47.789> I

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
actually anchor in the ground so I

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.400 
actually anchor in the ground so I
really<00:00:48.120> highly<00:00:48.539> recommend<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.020> anchored

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
really highly recommend the anchored

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.610 
really highly recommend the anchored
stove<00:00:49.680> into<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:50.010> ground<00:00:51.289> what<00:00:52.289> you<00:00:52.379> want<00:00:52.559> to

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
stove into the ground what you want to

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.680 
stove into the ground what you want to
do<00:00:52.710> then<00:00:52.890> is<00:00:53.100> use<00:00:53.640> an<00:00:53.850> alcohol<00:00:54.239> fuel<00:00:54.510> bottle

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
do then is use an alcohol fuel bottle

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.709 
do then is use an alcohol fuel bottle
something<00:00:55.110> like<00:00:55.230> this<00:00:55.379> something<00:00:55.680> that<00:00:55.800> has<00:00:56.070> a

00:00:56.709 --> 00:00:56.719 
something like this something that has a

00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:59.720 
something like this something that has a
flip<00:00:57.719> top<00:00:57.960> cap<00:00:58.230> or<00:00:58.530> maybe<00:00:58.829> a<00:00:58.949> sport<00:00:59.370> cap

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
something that pulls up like this and

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.920 
something that pulls up like this and
the<00:01:02.820> purpose<00:01:03.090> of<00:01:03.180> that<00:01:03.300> is<00:01:03.359> so<00:01:03.570> that<00:01:03.690> you<00:01:03.719> can

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
the purpose of that is so that you can

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.460 
the purpose of that is so that you can
actually<00:01:05.000> squirt<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.570> alcohol<00:01:06.960> into<00:01:07.350> the

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
center of the stove like this and with

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.090 
center of the stove like this and with
the<00:01:10.740> tri<00:01:10.979> X<00:01:11.220> dope<00:01:11.479> you<00:01:12.479> want<00:01:12.689> to<00:01:12.830> fill<00:01:13.830> it<00:01:13.860> up<00:01:14.040> to

the tri X dope you want to fill it up to

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.010 
the tri X dope you want to fill it up to
the<00:01:14.220> point<00:01:14.580> that<00:01:14.820> you<00:01:15.060> have<00:01:15.210> a<00:01:15.240> small<00:01:15.600> pool<00:01:15.990> of

the point that you have a small pool of
how<00:01:16.500> ho<00:01:16.710> in<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:16.920> middle<00:01:17.189> about<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.549> size<00:01:17.759> of<00:01:17.850> a

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
how ho in the middle about the size of a

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.510 
how ho in the middle about the size of a
dime<00:01:18.150> more<00:01:18.500> positive

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
dime more positive

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.420

fill<00:01:21.520> it<00:01:21.610> up<00:01:21.670> all<00:01:21.850> the<00:01:21.880> way<00:01:22.000> like<00:01:22.300> this

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
fill it up all the way like this

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.410 
fill it up all the way like this
probably<00:01:24.430> the<00:01:24.490> first<00:01:24.670> or<00:01:24.820> second<00:01:25.090> time<00:01:25.120> that

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 
probably the first or second time that

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.360 
probably the first or second time that
you<00:01:25.570> try<00:01:26.560> to<00:01:26.590> light<00:01:26.830> the<00:01:26.950> stove<00:01:27.130> you'll

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:27.370 
you try to light the stove you'll

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:29.040 
you try to light the stove you'll
probably<00:01:27.580> either<00:01:27.760> under<00:01:28.570> fill<00:01:28.780> it<00:01:28.930> or

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:29.050 
probably either under fill it or

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.620 
probably either under fill it or
overfill<00:01:29.470> it<00:01:29.500> so<00:01:29.890> don't<00:01:30.610> be<00:01:30.730> discouraged<00:01:30.850> you

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
overfill it so don't be discouraged you

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:32.910 
overfill it so don't be discouraged you
know<00:01:31.750> try<00:01:31.990> it<00:01:32.050> a<00:01:32.110> few<00:01:32.140> times<00:01:32.320> you'll<00:01:32.710> get<00:01:32.830> the

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 
know try it a few times you'll get the

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
know try it a few times you'll get the
hang<00:01:32.950> of<00:01:33.160> it<00:01:34.530> once<00:01:35.530> it's<00:01:35.710> full<00:01:35.980> it's<00:01:36.670> a<00:01:36.760> little

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:36.940 
hang of it once it's full it's a little

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:42.990 
hang of it once it's full it's a little
bit<00:01:37.030> more<00:01:40.590> once<00:01:41.590> it's<00:01:41.770> full<00:01:42.010> what<00:01:42.460> you<00:01:42.610> do<00:01:42.820> is

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 
bit more once it's full what you do is

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.970 
bit more once it's full what you do is
it<00:01:43.180> take<00:01:43.450> your<00:01:43.570> match<00:01:46.320> like<00:01:47.320> the<00:01:47.470> stove<00:01:47.740> like

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:47.980 
it take your match like the stove like

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:57.390 
it take your match like the stove like
this<00:01:49.290> and<00:01:50.910> its<00:01:51.910> really<00:01:53.310> dangerous<00:01:54.310> to<00:01:56.340> try<00:01:57.340> to

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:57.400 
this and its really dangerous to try to

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.330 
this and its really dangerous to try to
add<00:01:58.120> more<00:01:58.840> alcohol<00:01:59.290> stove<00:01:59.680> is<00:01:59.800> burning<00:01:59.979> so<00:02:00.160> you

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
add more alcohol stove is burning so you

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:01.469 
add more alcohol stove is burning so you
always<00:02:00.460> want<00:02:00.550> to<00:02:00.670> make<00:02:00.760> sure<00:02:00.820> you<00:02:01.120> do<00:02:01.240> need<00:02:01.450> to

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:01.479 
always want to make sure you do need to

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:03.090 
always want to make sure you do need to
add<00:02:01.660> alcohol<00:02:01.870> that<00:02:02.320> the<00:02:02.440> stove<00:02:02.680> is<00:02:02.770> actually

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
add alcohol that the stove is actually

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.340 
add alcohol that the stove is actually
one<00:02:03.190> hundred<00:02:03.430> percent<00:02:03.460> out<00:02:04.080> one<00:02:05.080> thing<00:02:05.229> I've

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
one hundred percent out one thing I've

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.060 
one hundred percent out one thing I've
heard<00:02:05.920> of<00:02:06.070> is<00:02:07.080> people<00:02:08.080> actually<00:02:08.709> thinking

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.070 
heard of is people actually thinking

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:10.560 
heard of is people actually thinking
that<00:02:09.220> the<00:02:09.369> the<00:02:09.610> flame<00:02:09.850> is<00:02:10.000> out<00:02:10.149> because<00:02:10.330> it's

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:10.570 
that the the flame is out because it's

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:12.810 
that the the flame is out because it's
really<00:02:10.750> difficult<00:02:10.959> to<00:02:11.320> see<00:02:11.530> the<00:02:11.680> flame<00:02:11.920> and

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:12.820 
really difficult to see the flame and

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:15.630 
really difficult to see the flame and
then<00:02:13.000> go<00:02:13.720> and<00:02:14.020> try<00:02:14.200> to<00:02:14.230> pour<00:02:14.530> more<00:02:14.950> apple<00:02:15.310> into

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
then go and try to pour more apple into

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.490 
then go and try to pour more apple into
the<00:02:15.820> stove<00:02:16.630> and<00:02:16.780> what<00:02:16.930> will<00:02:17.050> happen<00:02:17.080> is<00:02:17.380> the

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
the stove and what will happen is the

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:18.990 
the stove and what will happen is the
flame<00:02:17.709> will<00:02:17.860> actually<00:02:18.100> go<00:02:18.190> back<00:02:18.310> up<00:02:18.580> into<00:02:18.850> your

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
flame will actually go back up into your

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.940 
flame will actually go back up into your
fuel<00:02:19.330> bottle<00:02:19.510> and<00:02:19.780> it<00:02:20.080> will<00:02:20.320> explode<00:02:20.620> so

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
fuel bottle and it will explode so

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.460 
fuel bottle and it will explode so
you'll<00:02:21.160> be<00:02:21.250> really<00:02:21.459> careful<00:02:21.580> about<00:02:21.820> that<00:02:22.470> as

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
you'll be really careful about that as

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.110 
you'll be really careful about that as
soon<00:02:23.680> as<00:02:23.830> you<00:02:23.920> like<00:02:24.130> the<00:02:24.340> scope<00:02:24.640> you<00:02:24.850> can<00:02:24.910> go

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
soon as you like the scope you can go

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.650 
soon as you like the scope you can go
ahead<00:02:25.209> and<00:02:25.360> put<00:02:26.260> your<00:02:26.290> pot<00:02:26.650> on<00:02:26.800> top<00:02:26.830> like<00:02:27.250> this

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
ahead and put your pot on top like this

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.390 
ahead and put your pot on top like this
it<00:02:28.660> will<00:02:28.900> take<00:02:29.110> about<00:02:29.290> 30<00:02:29.739> seconds<00:02:30.160> to<00:02:30.250> a

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
it will take about 30 seconds to a

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.400 
it will take about 30 seconds to a
minute<00:02:30.519> or<00:02:30.940> so<00:02:30.970> for<00:02:31.390> the<00:02:31.480> stove<00:02:31.690> to<00:02:31.870> prime<00:02:32.140> and

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
minute or so for the stove to prime and

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.009 
minute or so for the stove to prime and
what's<00:02:33.310> happening<00:02:33.820> if<00:02:33.970> you<00:02:34.330> haven't<00:02:34.630> used<00:02:34.780> an

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:35.019 
what's happening if you haven't used an

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:37.860 
what's happening if you haven't used an
alcohol<00:02:35.380> stove<00:02:35.620> before<00:02:35.830> is<00:02:36.250> the<00:02:37.120> the<00:02:37.540> flame

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
alcohol stove before is the the flame

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.259 
alcohol stove before is the the flame
will<00:02:38.320> heat<00:02:38.680> up<00:02:38.709> the<00:02:39.010> alcohol<00:02:39.160> so<00:02:40.120> that<00:02:40.209> it

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
will heat up the alcohol so that it

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:41.970 
will heat up the alcohol so that it
starts<00:02:40.540> to<00:02:40.600> vaporize<00:02:40.810> and<00:02:41.410> once<00:02:41.590> it<00:02:41.739> does<00:02:41.920> that

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
starts to vaporize and once it does that

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.979 
starts to vaporize and once it does that
within<00:02:42.640> like<00:02:42.910> I<00:02:43.030> said<00:02:43.239> 30<00:02:43.480> seconds<00:02:43.840> to<00:02:43.900> a

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
within like I said 30 seconds to a

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:45.720 
within like I said 30 seconds to a
minute<00:02:44.050> the<00:02:44.620> flame<00:02:44.860> will<00:02:44.890> actually<00:02:45.370> go<00:02:45.519> from

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
minute the flame will actually go from

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.759 
minute the flame will actually go from
the<00:02:45.850> center<00:02:46.239> and<00:02:46.720> expand<00:02:47.200> to<00:02:47.320> the<00:02:47.350> outside

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:47.769 
the center and expand to the outside

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:49.770 
the center and expand to the outside
ring<00:02:48.430> if<00:02:48.820> you<00:02:48.940> can<00:02:49.090> see<00:02:49.239> the<00:02:49.360> little<00:02:49.480> holes

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
ring if you can see the little holes

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.570 
ring if you can see the little holes
here<00:02:50.019> and<00:02:50.050> then<00:02:50.650> still<00:02:50.950> watch<00:02:51.190> them<00:02:51.400> light<00:02:51.550> up

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
here and then still watch them light up

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.380 
here and then still watch them light up
and<00:02:51.970> burn<00:02:52.660> to<00:02:52.900> full<00:02:53.080> capacity<00:02:53.580> so<00:02:54.580> this<00:02:55.180> is<00:02:55.209> the

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
and burn to full capacity so this is the

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.300 
and burn to full capacity so this is the
as<00:02:55.870> you<00:02:55.989> can<00:02:56.110> see<00:02:56.230> it's<00:02:56.350> actually<00:02:56.650> littering

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
as you can see it's actually littering

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.530 
as you can see it's actually littering
so<00:02:58.310> this<00:02:58.460> is<00:02:58.610> the<00:02:58.820> the<00:02:59.210> bar<00:02:59.450> go<00:02:59.660> triad<00:03:00.170> stove

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
so this is the the bar go triad stove

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.870 
so this is the the bar go triad stove
thank<00:03:02.540> you<00:03:02.630> very<00:03:02.660> much
