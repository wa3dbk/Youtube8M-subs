of the pulleys complementing the Vortech
I<00:02:20.959> installed<00:02:21.320> the<00:02:21.440> JLT<00:02:22.070> airbox<00:02:22.580> replacement

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 
I installed the JLT airbox replacement

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.510 
I installed the JLT airbox replacement
intake<00:02:23.810> which<00:02:24.290> did<00:02:24.530> get<00:02:24.709> rid<00:02:24.800> of<00:02:24.920> that<00:02:25.040> factory

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
intake which did get rid of that factory

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.310 
intake which did get rid of that factory
restrictive<00:02:25.700> airbox<00:02:26.270> replaced<00:02:26.989> it<00:02:27.110> with<00:02:27.140> this

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320 
restrictive airbox replaced it with this

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.160 
restrictive airbox replaced it with this
massive<00:02:27.770> power<00:02:28.250> stack<00:02:28.610> filter<00:02:29.150> now<00:02:29.780> this

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
massive power stack filter now this

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:31.930 
massive power stack filter now this
might<00:02:30.410> actually<00:02:30.590> give<00:02:30.980> us<00:02:31.100> a<00:02:31.280> little<00:02:31.670> bit<00:02:31.790> more

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
might actually give us a little bit more

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.580 
might actually give us a little bit more
boost<00:02:32.150> about<00:02:32.330> a<00:02:32.450> pound<00:02:32.690> count<00:02:33.080> and<00:02:33.200> a<00:02:33.230> half<00:02:33.410> or

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
boost about a pound count and a half or

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.590 
boost about a pound count and a half or
so<00:02:33.739> and<00:02:34.040> the<00:02:34.400> best<00:02:34.520> part<00:02:34.820> is<00:02:34.970> it<00:02:35.150> was<00:02:35.239> designed

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
so and the best part is it was designed

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.360 
so and the best part is it was designed
to<00:02:35.630> work<00:02:35.780> specifically<00:02:36.530> with<00:02:36.650> this<00:02:36.890> Vortech

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
to work specifically with this Vortech

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.160 
to work specifically with this Vortech
blower<00:02:37.520> but<00:02:38.150> regardless<00:02:38.660> it's<00:02:38.900> just<00:02:39.019> going<00:02:39.110> to

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
blower but regardless it's just going to

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:40.660 
blower but regardless it's just going to
make<00:02:39.350> sure<00:02:39.380> we're<00:02:39.650> breathing<00:02:39.890> a<00:02:40.130> lot<00:02:40.370> better

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
make sure we're breathing a lot better

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.420 
make sure we're breathing a lot better

performance water map kit here on the
project<00:03:10.909> MMD<00:03:11.180> now<00:03:11.930> the<00:03:12.049> job<00:03:12.290> of<00:03:12.439> a<00:03:12.530> kit<00:03:12.680> like

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:12.799 
project MMD now the job of a kit like

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:14.470 
project MMD now the job of a kit like
this<00:03:12.859> has<00:03:13.250> helped<00:03:13.489> reduce<00:03:13.609> the<00:03:14.000> temperatures

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
this has helped reduce the temperatures

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.420 
this has helped reduce the temperatures
of<00:03:14.599> the<00:03:14.629> combustion<00:03:15.019> chamber<00:03:15.530> preventing<00:03:16.280> any

of the combustion chamber preventing any

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.640 
of the combustion chamber preventing any
detonation<00:03:17.239> and<00:03:17.480> lowing<00:03:17.930> our<00:03:18.049> intake<00:03:18.409> air

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
detonation and lowing our intake air

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.500 
detonation and lowing our intake air
temperatures<00:03:19.159> which<00:03:19.340> is<00:03:19.489> always<00:03:19.970> big<00:03:20.239> on<00:03:20.419> a

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
temperatures which is always big on a

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.720 
temperatures which is always big on a
forced<00:03:20.870> induction<00:03:20.989> car<00:03:21.590> now<00:03:22.220> another<00:03:22.519> nice

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
forced induction car now another nice

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.460 
forced induction car now another nice
thing<00:03:22.790> about<00:03:23.000> this<00:03:23.389> is<00:03:23.659> it<00:03:23.870> can<00:03:23.959> allow<00:03:24.200> us<00:03:24.230> to

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
thing about this is it can allow us to

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.619 
thing about this is it can allow us to
safely<00:03:24.769> run<00:03:25.189> more<00:03:25.370> ignition<00:03:25.849> timing<00:03:26.120> and<00:03:26.510> a

00:03:26.619 --> 00:03:26.629 
safely run more ignition timing and a

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:28.959 
safely run more ignition timing and a
little<00:03:26.810> bit<00:03:26.900> more<00:03:27.079> boost<00:03:27.319> while<00:03:28.129> using<00:03:28.459> pump

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:28.969 
little bit more boost while using pump

00:03:28.969 --> 00:03:30.849 
little bit more boost while using pump
gas<00:03:29.180> so<00:03:29.359> we<00:03:29.419> don't<00:03:29.540> have<00:03:29.599> to<00:03:29.719> go<00:03:29.810> to<00:03:29.870> c16<00:03:30.560> race

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:30.859 
gas so we don't have to go to c16 race

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:33.099 
gas so we don't have to go to c16 race
gas<00:03:31.069> or<00:03:31.310> mutant<00:03:31.639> 5<00:03:31.879> to<00:03:32.510> achieve<00:03:32.840> bigger

gas or mutant 5 to achieve bigger
numbers<00:03:33.560> very<00:03:34.370> important<00:03:34.909> part<00:03:35.120> when<00:03:35.239> we<00:03:35.359> do

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
numbers very important part when we do

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.149
