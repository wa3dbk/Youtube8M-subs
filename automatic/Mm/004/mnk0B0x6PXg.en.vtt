00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.020 
eyeshadow I have the Urban Decay Naked 3
palette<00:03:42.200> I<00:03:42.590> think<00:03:42.859> and<00:03:43.099> this<00:03:43.280> color<00:03:43.760> is<00:03:44.000> called

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
palette I think and this color is called

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.349 
palette I think and this color is called
omen<00:03:44.989> so<00:03:45.380> this<00:03:45.530> is<00:03:45.680> what<00:03:45.799> it<00:03:46.010> is<00:03:46.310> a<00:03:46.669> purpley

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:47.359 
omen so this is what it is a purpley

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:49.509 
omen so this is what it is a purpley
color<00:03:47.690> I'm<00:03:48.230> gonna<00:03:48.319> open<00:03:48.560> it<00:03:48.769> up<00:03:48.829> and<00:03:48.980> show<00:03:49.280> you

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:49.519

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:51.879 
color I'm gonna open it up and show you
it<00:03:50.299> is<00:03:50.510> purpley<00:03:51.079> and<00:03:51.290> I<00:03:51.349> thought<00:03:51.560> this<00:03:51.739> would

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:51.889 
it is purpley and I thought this would

00:03:51.889 --> 00:03:53.319 
it is purpley and I thought this would
be<00:03:51.950> really<00:03:52.250> fun<00:03:52.430> for<00:03:52.459> summer<00:03:52.849> I<00:03:53.030> don't<00:03:53.180> have

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:53.329 
be really fun for summer I don't have

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:55.330 
be really fun for summer I don't have
any<00:03:53.510> purple<00:03:53.959> eyeshadows<00:03:54.560> the<00:03:54.769> only<00:03:54.980> one<00:03:55.130> I

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
any purple eyeshadows the only one I

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.520 
any purple eyeshadows the only one I
have<00:03:55.609> it's<00:03:55.849> like<00:03:56.030> really<00:03:56.750> really<00:03:56.989> dark<00:03:57.260> and<00:03:57.500> I

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
have it's like really really dark and I

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:59.170 
have it's like really really dark and I
never<00:03:57.799> use<00:03:58.160> it<00:03:58.340> and<00:03:58.489> this<00:03:58.579> one's<00:03:58.760> actually<00:03:58.970> a

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
never use it and this one's actually a

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.539 
never use it and this one's actually a
really<00:03:59.359> light<00:03:59.690> color<00:03:59.769> and<00:04:00.769> so<00:04:00.950> I<00:04:00.980> thought<00:04:01.220> that

00:04:01.539 --> 00:04:01.549 
really light color and so I thought that

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:02.770 
really light color and so I thought that
was<00:04:01.760> really<00:04:02.120> pretty

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780
