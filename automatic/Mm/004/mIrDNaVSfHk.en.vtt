00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:07.410
 extraordinary of 5 elevenths of money 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.389
 of the strongest in sterile or nothing 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:13.440
 this designer was requested by 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:15.089
 many subscribers therefore what to say tension 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.039
 immediately and I tell you it will be an episode 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.420
 very particular because in these 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:26.119
 episodes there will be bunches of 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:28.710
 certainly the few that I had the 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:31.830
 March 1st we have the droid 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:35.850
 ok because the roi de knows that we are indeed the 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:38.910
 it was a strong back but fort but 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.730
 not so much because it was played for 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.899
 very little time for now that costs a 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.760
 fuck is a for fun 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:50.760
 let 's say the strategies of bridging in 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.780
 this is rather simple, that is 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.770
 the one of adare calare special 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.900
 work 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.210
 nothing the playable like a rascal now 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:03.530
 as a second bunch guys we have the 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:06.960
 walking and vip which is also this March 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:09.420
 same thing and some strange heroes that 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.790
 put it anyway it was done 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.910
 a little something for a short time and the 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.250
 strategies of this deck were and are 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:20.130
 rather simple or those of 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:23.369
 inflict damage from smashing monsters and 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.940
 now how the raid is playable like 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:30.360
 profane as third March we have 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:32.400
 the ancient gears or even a truck 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.410
 also this deck let's say it did 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.840
 a little something for a short time has 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:38.970
 received the supports with lard and 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.130
 let 's say the strategies of this one too 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:45.380
 rather simple task tgv damage e 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:49.200
 vowels simply or stallani 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:54.120
 no old radio can become a 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:57.210
 already more decent deck with a support 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:59.130
 mac because they are so iran agents 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.200
 I see 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.470
 and nothing even that today is 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.660
 playable as for fun as next 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:11.220
 pier surcharge stan commonly 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:12.870
 said anti mito continuity seen the 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.820
 cards of this step are simple 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:19.980
 when you always play the gray mullet pads 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:22.050
 duke with this mole raid this deck 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:25.890
 let's say you prevent good metal going 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:29.940
 opponent so we have to say 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:33.300
 you fail to do anything e 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.670
 nothing like today is playable like 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:40.019
 last March guys we have the tablet 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:42.930
 strange bunch tablet a product from denar 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:47.190
 senal that was based that is based 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:50.730
 on the scrap of monsters mainly 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:53.190
 makes a fabulous crow and nino scraps with 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.380
 evoque or slits into something more 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.840
 this deck is also a synchro deck given 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:00.920
 which contains tuner that with discarded i 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.280
 special vocated numbers like jaws 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.680
 cerbu rel 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.460
 so thanks to this fable ability 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:10.100
 ii can also afford to do sync 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:15.230
 given the very high as foreign you 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:20.420
 or the quasar nothing the fab land has 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:22.450
 made very few top cute bunch that 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:25.400
 unfortunately I wouldn't like to play 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:29.540
 however in this myth he fails to 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:31.910
 resist as it goes well with macro fish 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:34.280
 urban share sucks too much 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:37.750
 ok guys for this video and everything 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.750
 let's go to a next hello video
