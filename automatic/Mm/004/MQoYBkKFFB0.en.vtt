the citizens that live here in Rowan
County<00:00:52.270> I<00:00:52.690> also<00:00:53.020> think<00:00:53.350> that<00:00:53.470> the<00:00:54.000> produce<00:00:55.000> is

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:55.450 
County I also think that the produce is

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:57.689 
County I also think that the produce is
much<00:00:55.840> fresher<00:00:56.230> it<00:00:56.500> doesn't<00:00:56.800> travel<00:00:57.010> as<00:00:57.220> far<00:00:57.430> so

00:00:57.689 --> 00:00:57.699 
much fresher it doesn't travel as far so

00:00:57.699 --> 00:00:59.250 
much fresher it doesn't travel as far so
