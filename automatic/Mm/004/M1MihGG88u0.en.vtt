one<00:03:22.959> of<00:03:22.989> those<00:03:23.079> tents<00:03:23.530> that<00:03:23.650> you<00:03:23.739> can<00:03:23.980> set<00:03:24.340> up

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
one of those tents that you can set up

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.479 
one of those tents that you can set up
in<00:03:24.909> pretty<00:03:25.750> heavy<00:03:25.870> rain<00:03:26.260> and<00:03:26.620> not<00:03:26.799> get<00:03:27.010> wet<00:03:27.219> and

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489 
in pretty heavy rain and not get wet and

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:29.759 
in pretty heavy rain and not get wet and
the<00:03:27.760> way<00:03:27.879> you<00:03:27.939> would<00:03:28.150> do<00:03:28.299> that<00:03:28.480> is<00:03:29.469> a<00:03:29.530> little

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:29.769 
the way you would do that is a little

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:31.110 
the way you would do that is a little
different<00:03:30.069> than<00:03:30.159> I've<00:03:30.280> done<00:03:30.310> it<00:03:30.519> here<00:03:30.849> you

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
different than I've done it here you

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.110 
different than I've done it here you
would<00:03:31.269> set<00:03:31.510> up<00:03:31.629> the<00:03:32.129> pole<00:03:33.129> to<00:03:33.400> start<00:03:33.700> with<00:03:33.879> and

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
would set up the pole to start with and

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.449 
would set up the pole to start with and
the<00:03:34.299> ground<00:03:34.540> or<00:03:34.810> the<00:03:34.840> the<00:03:35.349> footprint<00:03:35.829> and<00:03:36.069> then

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
the ground or the the footprint and then

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:38.099 
the ground or the the footprint and then
instead<00:03:36.760> of<00:03:36.849> setting<00:03:37.150> up<00:03:37.269> the<00:03:37.569> the<00:03:37.959> inner

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:38.109 
instead of setting up the the inner

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:39.179 
instead of setting up the the inner
portion<00:03:38.349> of<00:03:38.590> the<00:03:38.650> tent<00:03:38.859> you<00:03:38.950> would<00:03:39.069> just

00:03:39.179 --> 00:03:39.189 
portion of the tent you would just

00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:40.920 
portion of the tent you would just
immediately<00:03:39.400> throw<00:03:39.970> the<00:03:40.120> rain<00:03:40.299> fly<00:03:40.540> over<00:03:40.840> the

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
immediately throw the rain fly over the

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.720 
immediately throw the rain fly over the
top<00:03:41.140> to<00:03:41.620> stop<00:03:41.829> the<00:03:41.980> rain<00:03:42.129> from<00:03:42.159> falling<00:03:42.640> on

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730

on you come back outside and stake it
down<00:04:01.359> another<00:04:01.959> nice<00:04:02.200> feature<00:04:02.470> about<00:04:02.919> this

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
down another nice feature about this

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:04.649 
down another nice feature about this
tent<00:04:03.700> and<00:04:03.879> there's<00:04:04.000> several<00:04:04.239> other<00:04:04.419> tents

00:04:04.649 --> 00:04:04.659 
tent and there's several other tents

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:05.909 
tent and there's several other tents
that<00:04:04.720> have<00:04:04.930> that<00:04:05.079> too<00:04:05.290> is<00:04:05.530> the<00:04:05.680> flow-through

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:05.919 
that have that too is the flow-through

00:04:05.919 --> 00:04:07.860 
that have that too is the flow-through
ventilation<00:04:06.129> on<00:04:06.639> the<00:04:06.730> top<00:04:06.909> once<00:04:07.540> I've<00:04:07.659> got<00:04:07.750> the

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
ventilation on the top once I've got the

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:09.929 
ventilation on the top once I've got the
rain<00:04:08.019> fly<00:04:08.290> in<00:04:08.409> place<00:04:08.650> I<00:04:08.950> can<00:04:09.040> pop<00:04:09.519> open<00:04:09.700> these

00:04:09.929 --> 00:04:09.939 
rain fly in place I can pop open these

00:04:09.939 --> 00:04:13.440 
rain fly in place I can pop open these
vents<00:04:10.329> here<00:04:10.510> and<00:04:10.959> that<00:04:11.650> allows<00:04:12.209> air<00:04:13.209> to<00:04:13.239> flow

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450 
vents here and that allows air to flow

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:15.179 
vents here and that allows air to flow
through<00:04:13.870> them<00:04:14.079> completely<00:04:14.769> through<00:04:14.889> the<00:04:15.010> top

00:04:15.179 --> 00:04:15.189 
through them completely through the top

00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:17.550 
through them completely through the top
of<00:04:15.220> the<00:04:15.370> tent<00:04:15.700> and<00:04:16.199> the<00:04:17.199> reason<00:04:17.470> that's

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
of the tent and the reason that's

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:18.810 
of the tent and the reason that's
important<00:04:17.979> is<00:04:18.039> because<00:04:18.099> it<00:04:18.400> cuts<00:04:18.609> down<00:04:18.759> on

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820 
important is because it cuts down on

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.999 
important is because it cuts down on
condensation<00:04:19.739> especially<00:04:20.739> here<00:04:20.859> in<00:04:20.889> the

00:04:20.999 --> 00:04:21.009 
condensation especially here in the

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:23.100 
condensation especially here in the
Carpathians<00:04:21.579> and<00:04:21.759> moist<00:04:22.110> environments

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
Carpathians and moist environments

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:24.600 
Carpathians and moist environments
condensation<00:04:23.650> something<00:04:23.889> we<00:04:23.979> really<00:04:24.130> battle

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
condensation something we really battle

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.219 
condensation something we really battle
against<00:04:24.849> and<00:04:25.150> you<00:04:25.389> can<00:04:25.510> even<00:04:25.690> get<00:04:25.810> almost<00:04:26.050> as

00:04:26.219 --> 00:04:26.229 
against and you can even get almost as

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:27.750 
against and you can even get almost as
wet<00:04:26.440> in<00:04:26.680> the<00:04:26.800> inside<00:04:27.190> of<00:04:27.280> your<00:04:27.370> tent<00:04:27.610> from

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:27.760 
wet in the inside of your tent from

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.310 
wet in the inside of your tent from
condensation<00:04:28.090> as<00:04:28.479> you<00:04:28.599> can<00:04:28.780> from<00:04:29.050> a<00:04:29.110> tent

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:29.320 
condensation as you can from a tent

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:30.600 
condensation as you can from a tent
leaking<00:04:29.710> okay<00:04:30.070> a<00:04:30.159> lot<00:04:30.280> of<00:04:30.400> people<00:04:30.550> I<00:04:30.580> think

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:30.610 
leaking okay a lot of people I think

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:32.460 
leaking okay a lot of people I think
think<00:04:31.360> their<00:04:31.570> tenders<00:04:31.900> leaking<00:04:32.260> when<00:04:32.380> in

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
think their tenders leaking when in

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:33.899 
think their tenders leaking when in
reality<00:04:32.590> it's<00:04:32.979> not<00:04:33.130> it's<00:04:33.430> just<00:04:33.580> that<00:04:33.639> they

00:04:33.899 --> 00:04:33.909 
reality it's not it's just that they

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:35.250 
reality it's not it's just that they
don't<00:04:34.060> have<00:04:34.180> any<00:04:34.300> ventilation<00:04:34.780> in<00:04:34.870> there<00:04:35.050> and

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:35.260 
don't have any ventilation in there and

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:36.899 
don't have any ventilation in there and
they're<00:04:35.349> getting<00:04:35.440> a<00:04:35.620> lot<00:04:35.740> of<00:04:35.770> condensation<00:04:36.099> so

00:04:36.899 --> 00:04:36.909 
they're getting a lot of condensation so

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:38.670 
they're getting a lot of condensation so
the<00:04:37.090> flow<00:04:37.449> through<00:04:37.690> vent<00:04:37.900> feature<00:04:38.229> is<00:04:38.470> really

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
the flow through vent feature is really

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.219 
the flow through vent feature is really
nice<00:04:38.830> if<00:04:39.010> you<00:04:39.130> can<00:04:39.250> find<00:04:39.520> it<00:04:39.990> try<00:04:40.990> to<00:04:41.050> get<00:04:41.199> a

00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:41.229 
nice if you can find it try to get a

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:44.189 
nice if you can find it try to get a
tent<00:04:41.500> that<00:04:41.650> has<00:04:41.710> really<00:04:42.659> well<00:04:43.659> probably<00:04:43.930> most

00:04:44.189 --> 00:04:44.199 
tent that has really well probably most

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:45.450 
tent that has really well probably most
of<00:04:44.320> them<00:04:44.470> have<00:04:44.590> these<00:04:44.770> days<00:04:44.949> but<00:04:45.159> the<00:04:45.250> lighter

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:45.460 
of them have these days but the lighter

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.300 
of them have these days but the lighter
the<00:04:45.550> stakes<00:04:45.909> the<00:04:46.090> better<00:04:46.270> you<00:04:46.510> can<00:04:46.659> get

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.310 
the stakes the better you can get

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:49.970 
the stakes the better you can get
amazingly<00:04:48.310> lightweight

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:49.980 
amazingly lightweight

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:51.890 
amazingly lightweight
aluminum<00:04:50.520> stakes<00:04:50.820> these<00:04:51.210> are<00:04:51.330> not<00:04:51.450> bad<00:04:51.630> right

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
aluminum stakes these are not bad right

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.180 
aluminum stakes these are not bad right
here<00:04:52.080> they<00:04:52.200> come<00:04:52.380> even<00:04:52.620> lighter<00:04:52.800> than<00:04:52.920> this

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.190 
here they come even lighter than this

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:55.760 
here they come even lighter than this
but<00:04:54.030> when<00:04:54.450> you<00:04:54.540> stake<00:04:54.750> me<00:04:54.780> down<00:04:54.990> your<00:04:55.140> tent<00:04:55.350> you

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:55.770 
but when you stake me down your tent you

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:57.290 
but when you stake me down your tent you
want<00:04:55.980> to<00:04:56.070> have<00:04:56.220> it<00:04:56.370> tight<00:04:56.670> because<00:04:57.060> if<00:04:57.180> it's

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 
want to have it tight because if it's

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.230 
want to have it tight because if it's
too<00:04:57.570> if<00:04:58.260> it's<00:04:58.440> loose<00:04:58.680> and<00:04:58.890> sagging<00:04:59.190> that<00:04:59.460> that

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 
too if it's loose and sagging that that

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.300 
too if it's loose and sagging that that
just<00:05:00.540> affects<00:05:00.780> just<00:05:00.840> inviting<00:05:01.350> leakage<00:05:01.890> but

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:02.310 
just affects just inviting leakage but

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:03.620 
just affects just inviting leakage but
on<00:05:02.400> the<00:05:02.490> other<00:05:02.550> hand<00:05:02.670> when<00:05:03.060> you're<00:05:03.210> staking<00:05:03.390> it

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:03.630 
on the other hand when you're staking it

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:04.670 
on the other hand when you're staking it
down<00:05:03.750> you<00:05:03.900> don't<00:05:04.020> want<00:05:04.170> to<00:05:04.230> pull<00:05:04.350> it<00:05:04.380> too<00:05:04.470> tight

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 
down you don't want to pull it too tight

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.980 
down you don't want to pull it too tight
I've<00:05:05.010> seen<00:05:05.190> guys<00:05:05.370> that<00:05:05.700> tried<00:05:06.660> to<00:05:06.750> pull<00:05:06.900> their

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:06.990 
I've seen guys that tried to pull their

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:08.570 
I've seen guys that tried to pull their
tents<00:05:07.230> totai<00:05:07.530> they<00:05:07.680> pulled<00:05:07.920> it<00:05:08.040> out<00:05:08.100> of<00:05:08.160> square

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:08.580 
tents totai they pulled it out of square

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.280 
tents totai they pulled it out of square
and<00:05:08.610> it<00:05:08.850> gets<00:05:09.030> kind<00:05:09.180> of<00:05:09.210> all<00:05:09.360> twisted<00:05:09.750> that<00:05:10.110> can

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:10.290 
and it gets kind of all twisted that can

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:13.709 
and it gets kind of all twisted that can
be<00:05:10.380> a<00:05:10.410> problem<00:05:10.710> also

00:05:13.709 --> 00:05:13.719 

00:05:13.719 --> 00:05:15.389 

and<00:05:14.229> now<00:05:14.349> once<00:05:14.559> you<00:05:14.649> have<00:05:14.769> the<00:05:14.830> four<00:05:15.009> corners

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:15.399 
and now once you have the four corners

00:05:15.399 --> 00:05:17.489 
and now once you have the four corners
take<00:05:15.580> the<00:05:15.789> last<00:05:15.999> step<00:05:16.269> would<00:05:16.539> be<00:05:16.599> to<00:05:16.749> stake<00:05:17.349> out

00:05:17.489 --> 00:05:17.499 
take the last step would be to stake out

00:05:17.499 --> 00:05:19.409 
take the last step would be to stake out
the<00:05:17.649> vestibule<00:05:18.159> now<00:05:18.789> this<00:05:18.939> tent<00:05:19.179> another

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:19.419 
the vestibule now this tent another

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:20.999 
the vestibule now this tent another
another<00:05:19.839> good<00:05:20.169> thing<00:05:20.199> about<00:05:20.409> this<00:05:20.679> tent<00:05:20.919> is

00:05:20.999 --> 00:05:21.009 
another good thing about this tent is

00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:23.039 
another good thing about this tent is
that<00:05:21.159> it<00:05:21.249> has<00:05:21.399> two<00:05:21.639> vestibules<00:05:21.999> that's<00:05:22.689> not<00:05:22.869> an

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:23.049 
that it has two vestibules that's not an

00:05:23.049 --> 00:05:25.139 
that it has two vestibules that's not an
absolute<00:05:23.229> must<00:05:24.039> but<00:05:24.369> it's<00:05:24.489> really<00:05:24.639> nice<00:05:24.909> it

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:25.149 
absolute must but it's really nice it

00:05:25.149 --> 00:05:26.429 
absolute must but it's really nice it
allows<00:05:25.360> you<00:05:25.539> to<00:05:25.599> enter<00:05:25.809> the<00:05:25.929> temple<00:05:26.110> either

00:05:26.429 --> 00:05:26.439 
allows you to enter the temple either

00:05:26.439 --> 00:05:28.259 
allows you to enter the temple either
side<00:05:26.739> also<00:05:27.189> gives<00:05:27.519> you<00:05:27.579> extra<00:05:27.909> storage<00:05:27.969> space

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:28.269 
side also gives you extra storage space

00:05:28.269 --> 00:05:29.969 
side also gives you extra storage space
so<00:05:28.839> I<00:05:28.869> think<00:05:29.019> we<00:05:29.139> have<00:05:29.229> a<00:05:29.289> smaller<00:05:29.559> tent<00:05:29.799> like

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:29.979 
so I think we have a smaller tent like

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:33.119 
so I think we have a smaller tent like
the<00:05:30.129> hubba<00:05:30.309> from<00:05:31.089> MSR<00:05:31.649> and<00:05:32.649> you<00:05:32.739> need<00:05:33.009> that

00:05:33.119 --> 00:05:33.129 
the hubba from MSR and you need that

00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:35.489 
the hubba from MSR and you need that
best<00:05:33.369> if<00:05:33.519> you<00:05:33.610> will<00:05:33.729> store<00:05:34.029> your<00:05:34.239> pack<00:05:34.449> or<00:05:34.899> like

00:05:35.489 --> 00:05:35.499 
best if you will store your pack or like

00:05:35.499 --> 00:05:37.229 
best if you will store your pack or like
