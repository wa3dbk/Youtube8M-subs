00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
going to do that and I also demonstrate

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.430 
going to do that and I also demonstrate
how<00:00:28.199> to<00:00:28.230> use<00:00:28.410> it<00:00:28.680> so<00:00:29.310> first<00:00:30.090> of<00:00:30.240> all<00:00:30.300> it's<00:00:30.929> um<00:00:31.710> a

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:33.440 
how to use it so first of all it's um a

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:40.819 
how to use it so first of all it's um a
little<00:00:34.440> bit<00:00:34.739> up<00:00:35.300> it<00:00:36.300> has<00:00:36.540> a<00:00:38.420> dial<00:00:39.420> to<00:00:39.960> change

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
little bit up it has a dial to change

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.760 
little bit up it has a dial to change
the<00:00:41.070> heat<00:00:41.280> settings<00:00:41.730> from<00:00:42.030> low<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:42.590> extra<00:00:43.590> hot

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
the heat settings from low to extra hot

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.520 
the heat settings from low to extra hot
um<00:00:44.040> those<00:00:44.879> 220<00:00:45.750> degrees<00:00:46.440> Celsius<00:00:47.250> which<00:00:47.550> is

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530 
um those 220 degrees Celsius which is

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:54.380 
um those 220 degrees Celsius which is
hot<00:00:49.530> I<00:00:49.800> think<00:00:50.039> it's<00:00:50.219> like<00:00:50.399> 400<00:00:50.820> +<00:00:53.030> 120<00:00:54.030> degrees

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
hot I think it's like 400 + 120 degrees

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.090 
hot I think it's like 400 + 120 degrees
Fahrenheit<00:00:54.989> something<00:00:55.469> something<00:00:55.890> close<00:00:56.070> to

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
Fahrenheit something something close to

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.299 
Fahrenheit something something close to
that<00:00:56.250> I<00:00:56.670> don't<00:00:57.480> know<00:00:57.539> how<00:00:57.660> you<00:00:59.329> change<00:01:00.329> the

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:01.309 
that I don't know how you change the

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:04.670 
that I don't know how you change the
Fahrenheit<00:01:02.309> Celsius<00:01:02.730> whatever<00:01:03.329> up<00:01:03.600> um<00:01:04.140> so

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
Fahrenheit Celsius whatever up um so

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.490 
Fahrenheit Celsius whatever up um so
yeah<00:01:05.129> it<00:01:05.820> has<00:01:06.150> a<00:01:06.900> on<00:01:07.470> off<00:01:07.710> switch<00:01:07.890> right<00:01:08.430> here

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
yeah it has a on off switch right here

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.260 
yeah it has a on off switch right here
and<00:01:10.500> have<00:01:10.740> a<00:01:10.770> little<00:01:10.890> light<00:01:11.280> so<00:01:11.700> when<00:01:11.939> it's<00:01:12.060> on

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
and have a little light so when it's on

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.929 
and have a little light so when it's on
then<00:01:12.960> you<00:01:13.080> know<00:01:13.200> what's<00:01:13.350> on<00:01:13.530> I<00:01:13.799> have<00:01:14.340> a<00:01:14.369> swivel

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
then you know what's on I have a swivel

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.560 
then you know what's on I have a swivel
cord<00:01:15.560> so<00:01:16.560> it's<00:01:16.740> easy<00:01:16.950> so<00:01:17.280> when<00:01:17.430> you<00:01:17.610> turn<00:01:18.540> the

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
cord so it's easy so when you turn the

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.600 
cord so it's easy so when you turn the
thing<00:01:18.840> on<00:01:19.020> it<00:01:19.259> works<00:01:19.470> better<00:01:20.000> it's<00:01:21.000> 24-karat

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
thing on it works better it's 24-karat

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.289 
thing on it works better it's 24-karat
gold-plated<00:01:23.610> barrel<00:01:24.920> has<00:01:25.920> a<00:01:25.979> powerful<00:01:26.490> spring

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299

gold-plated barrel has a powerful spring
clamp<00:01:27.930> and<00:01:29.360> yeah<00:01:31.220> pretty<00:01:32.220> much<00:01:32.310> it's<00:01:32.549> a<00:01:32.640> basic

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
clamp and yeah pretty much it's a basic

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.350 
clamp and yeah pretty much it's a basic
phone<00:01:33.240> iron<00:01:34.400> it's<00:01:35.400> not<00:01:35.549> a<00:01:35.820> really<00:01:36.150> expensive

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
phone iron it's not a really expensive

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.390 
phone iron it's not a really expensive
program<00:01:36.810> so<00:01:37.140> if<00:01:37.320> you<00:01:37.439> needed<00:01:37.770> coming<00:01:38.070> on<00:01:38.189> I

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
program so if you needed coming on I
