have<00:00:42.100> to<00:00:42.219> tilt<00:00:42.489> the<00:00:42.579> screen<00:00:42.820> to<00:00:43.120> move<00:00:43.379> and<00:00:44.379> then

00:00:44.549 --> 00:00:44.559 
have to tilt the screen to move and then

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:52.590 
have to tilt the screen to move and then
tap<00:00:44.800> the<00:00:44.859> paddle<00:00:45.370> too<00:00:46.199> okay<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:51.329> let's<00:00:52.329> go<00:00:52.539> to

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:52.600 
tap the paddle too okay and let's go to

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.680 
tap the paddle too okay and let's go to
it<00:00:52.839> against<00:00:53.170> what<00:00:53.499> I've<00:00:53.859> been<00:00:53.980> finding<00:00:54.280> a<00:00:54.699> bug

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:55.690 
it against what I've been finding a bug

it against what I've been finding a bug
on<00:00:55.899> this<00:00:56.170> as<00:00:56.379> the<00:00:56.859> paddle<00:00:57.249> doesn't<00:00:57.519> move<00:00:57.640> with

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850 
on this as the paddle doesn't move with

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.549 
on this as the paddle doesn't move with
the<00:00:57.999> accelerometer<00:00:58.719> but<00:00:58.929> once<00:00:59.140> you<00:00:59.289> get<00:00:59.440> it

00:00:59.549 --> 00:00:59.559 
the accelerometer but once you get it

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:02.669 
the accelerometer but once you get it
going<00:00:59.589> it's<00:01:00.010> a<00:01:00.190> really<00:01:00.460> fun<00:01:00.550> game<00:01:01.350> let's<00:01:02.350> go<00:01:02.620> to
