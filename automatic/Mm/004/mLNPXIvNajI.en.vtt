different orders and to really affect

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.410 
different orders and to really affect
the<00:00:52.649> outcome<00:00:53.070> of<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.489> game<00:00:53.670> as<00:00:54.000> a<00:00:54.060> whole

the outcome of the game as a whole

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.900 
the outcome of the game as a whole
through<00:00:55.110> their<00:00:55.590> gameplay<00:00:56.010> by<00:00:56.220> by<00:00:56.730> running

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
through their gameplay by by running

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.970 
through their gameplay by by running
around<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.239> shooting<00:00:57.420> so<00:00:58.020> that<00:00:58.649> meant<00:00:58.890> that

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
around the shooting so that meant that

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.319 
around the shooting so that meant that
we<00:00:59.190> couldn't<00:00:59.430> just<00:00:59.579> have<00:00:59.850> a<00:00:59.910> sort<00:01:00.239> of

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
we couldn't just have a sort of

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.360 
we couldn't just have a sort of
conventional<00:01:00.989> linear<00:01:01.680> narrative<00:01:02.040> that<00:01:02.280> was

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
conventional linear narrative that was

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.299 
conventional linear narrative that was
grafted<00:01:02.730> onto<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.390> game<00:01:03.860> because<00:01:04.860> really<00:01:05.100> we

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
grafted onto the game because really we

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:06.440 
grafted onto the game because really we
don't<00:01:05.399> know<00:01:05.519> what<00:01:05.759> the<00:01:05.820> players<00:01:06.030> gonna<00:01:06.180> do<00:01:06.360> we

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
don't know what the players gonna do we

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:07.459 
don't know what the players gonna do we
don't<00:01:06.570> know<00:01:06.659> how<00:01:06.810> they're<00:01:06.990> gonna<00:01:07.079> take<00:01:07.320> their

00:01:07.459 --> 00:01:07.469 
don't know how they're gonna take their

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:08.690 
don't know how they're gonna take their
approach<00:01:07.799> we<00:01:08.009> don't<00:01:08.159> know<00:01:08.280> what<00:01:08.399> kinds<00:01:08.610> of

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
approach we don't know what kinds of

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.399 
approach we don't know what kinds of
missions<00:01:08.820> they're<00:01:09.119> gonna<00:01:09.240> want<00:01:09.540> to<00:01:09.659> do<00:01:09.810> so<00:01:10.290> we

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
missions they're gonna want to do so we

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.859 
missions they're gonna want to do so we
couldn't<00:01:10.619> have<00:01:10.829> a<00:01:10.890> story<00:01:11.219> that<00:01:11.340> was<00:01:11.610> so<00:01:11.880> locked

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
couldn't have a story that was so locked

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.889 
couldn't have a story that was so locked
in<00:01:13.110> and<00:01:13.320> so<00:01:13.500> so<00:01:13.969> engraved<00:01:14.969> in<00:01:15.149> stone<00:01:15.329> in<00:01:15.749> terms

in and so so engraved in stone in terms

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:17.449 
in and so so engraved in stone in terms
of<00:01:16.020> how<00:01:16.109> it<00:01:16.170> was<00:01:16.289> gonna<00:01:16.350> unfold<00:01:16.799> that<00:01:17.310> the

00:01:17.449 --> 00:01:17.459 
of how it was gonna unfold that the

00:01:17.459 --> 00:01:19.219 
of how it was gonna unfold that the
player<00:01:17.670> was<00:01:17.939> constantly<00:01:18.389> being<00:01:18.600> forced<00:01:19.049> into

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
player was constantly being forced into

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.169 
player was constantly being forced into
these<00:01:19.409> sort<00:01:19.619> of<00:01:19.679> bottlenecks<00:01:20.549> in<00:01:20.819> order<00:01:21.090> to

00:01:21.169 --> 00:01:21.179 
these sort of bottlenecks in order to

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:22.520 
these sort of bottlenecks in order to
see<00:01:21.329> it<00:01:21.450> you<00:01:21.539> know<00:01:21.630> a<00:01:21.659> cutscene<00:01:22.139> or<00:01:22.170> something

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
see it you know a cutscene or something

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:23.480 
see it you know a cutscene or something
that<00:01:22.619> would<00:01:22.709> tell<00:01:22.829> them<00:01:22.950> how<00:01:23.039> the<00:01:23.100> story<00:01:23.369> was

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
that would tell them how the story was

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.969 
that would tell them how the story was
progressing<00:01:23.999> that<00:01:24.959> meant<00:01:25.259> we<00:01:25.409> needed<00:01:25.439> to<00:01:25.829> do

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
progressing that meant we needed to do

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.919 
progressing that meant we needed to do
something<00:01:26.399> which<00:01:26.819> we<00:01:27.029> call<00:01:27.240> sort<00:01:27.869> of

00:01:27.919 --> 00:01:27.929 
something which we call sort of

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:31.069 
something which we call sort of
dynamically<00:01:28.850> sort<00:01:29.850> of<00:01:29.909> procedurally<00:01:30.630> managed

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
dynamically sort of procedurally managed

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.840 
dynamically sort of procedurally managed
narrative<00:01:31.619> right<00:01:31.859> the<00:01:32.189> idea<00:01:32.429> that<00:01:32.609> stories

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
narrative right the idea that stories

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.849 
narrative right the idea that stories
being<00:01:33.240> assembled<00:01:33.539> on<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:33.899> fly<00:01:34.259> by<00:01:34.529> the<00:01:34.590> game

doing<00:01:37.170> in<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.499> game<00:01:37.649> so<00:01:38.490> that's<00:01:39.359> our

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
doing in the game so that's our

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.389
