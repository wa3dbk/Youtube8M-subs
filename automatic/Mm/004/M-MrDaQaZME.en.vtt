00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:53.620 
thing it does is it's gonna reduce the

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.500 
thing it does is it's gonna reduce the
vibration<00:00:53.800> you<00:00:54.790> know<00:00:54.910> this<00:00:55.090> thing<00:00:55.270> is<00:00:55.360> gonna

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:55.510 
vibration you know this thing is gonna

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:57.930 
vibration you know this thing is gonna
spin<00:00:55.960> on<00:00:56.140> there<00:00:56.410> and<00:00:56.620> it's<00:00:57.160> gonna<00:00:57.310> stop<00:00:57.730> that

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 
spin on there and it's gonna stop that

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.750 
spin on there and it's gonna stop that
Harmonix<00:00:58.690> to<00:00:58.930> the<00:00:59.050> vibration<00:00:59.739> so<00:01:00.489> it's<00:01:00.610> going

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:00.760 
Harmonix to the vibration so it's going

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.569
