on your carpal tunnel as well I can use
just<00:02:16.130> the<00:02:16.340> tip<00:02:16.580> of<00:02:16.790> it<00:02:16.970> I<00:02:17.180> could<00:02:17.720> use<00:02:17.870> the<00:02:18.050> whole

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
just the tip of it I could use the whole

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.810 
just the tip of it I could use the whole
blade<00:02:18.620> or<00:02:19.250> just<00:02:19.580> to<00:02:19.730> fit<00:02:19.940> me<00:02:21.550> again<00:02:22.550> I'm<00:02:22.700> going

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:22.820 
blade or just to fit me again I'm going

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.240 
blade or just to fit me again I'm going
to<00:02:22.880> bevel<00:02:23.240> under<00:02:23.740> which<00:02:24.740> will<00:02:24.920> give<00:02:25.070> me<00:02:25.220> a

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
to bevel under which will give me a

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.130 
to bevel under which will give me a
bevel<00:02:25.640> help<00:02:25.880> the<00:02:26.000> hair<00:02:26.180> to<00:02:26.330> turn<00:02:26.540> under<00:02:26.750> a<00:02:26.900> lot

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
bevel help the hair to turn under a lot

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:28.470 
bevel help the hair to turn under a lot
better

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
better

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:34.600 
better
also<00:02:29.480> texturize<00:02:30.140> it<00:02:33.130> instead<00:02:34.130> of<00:02:34.190> having<00:02:34.370> to

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
also texturize it instead of having to

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.090 
also texturize it instead of having to
come<00:02:34.820> in<00:02:35.000> with<00:02:35.150> your<00:02:35.330> shears<00:02:35.660> and<00:02:36.020> pointing<00:02:36.980> it

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
come in with your shears and pointing it

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:43.570 
come in with your shears and pointing it
you<00:02:38.030> get<00:02:38.180> a<00:02:38.209> perfect<00:02:38.720> bevel<00:02:39.080> on<00:02:39.200> that<00:02:40.810> again

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
you get a perfect bevel on that again

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.460 
you get a perfect bevel on that again

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
bit of a weight line there I'm going to

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:49.460 
bit of a weight line there I'm going to
take<00:03:46.110> you<00:03:46.590> again<00:03:47.549> channel<00:03:48.000> car<00:03:48.239> on<00:03:48.629> the<00:03:49.049> TBS
