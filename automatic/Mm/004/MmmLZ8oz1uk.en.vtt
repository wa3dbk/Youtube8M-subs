Farmers Weekly it's all on about gosh
all<00:00:42.910> the<00:00:43.030> dry<00:00:43.540> grass<00:00:43.780> is<00:00:43.990> drying<00:00:44.260> out<00:00:44.440> we

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:45.400 
all the dry grass is drying out we

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.520 
all the dry grass is drying out we
hardly<00:00:45.730> realized<00:00:46.210> that<00:00:46.420> there's<00:00:46.600> a<00:00:46.660> there's<00:00:47.470> a

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:47.530 
hardly realized that there's a there's a

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:48.930 
hardly realized that there's a there's a
drought<00:00:47.710> on<00:00:47.950> I<00:00:48.130> mean<00:00:48.340> what<00:00:48.520> we're<00:00:48.640> trying<00:00:48.760> to

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:48.940 
drought on I mean what we're trying to

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.470 
drought on I mean what we're trying to
do<00:00:49.120> is<00:00:50.010> have<00:00:51.010> an<00:00:51.100> organic<00:00:51.460> system<00:00:51.790> because<00:00:52.330> of

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:52.480 
do is have an organic system because of

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:57.720 
do is have an organic system because of
the<00:00:52.600> array<00:00:52.870> of<00:00:54.390> plants<00:00:55.390> that<00:00:55.540> are<00:00:55.720> that<00:00:56.579> are<00:00:57.579> in

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:57.730 
the array of plants that are that are in

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.380 
the array of plants that are that are in
the<00:00:57.880> lay<00:00:59.040> choosing<00:01:00.040> ones<00:01:00.280> that<00:01:00.670> are<00:01:01.180> good

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.390 
the lay choosing ones that are good

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.049 
the lay choosing ones that are good
nutrition<00:01:01.900> for<00:01:02.050> the<00:01:02.110> Sheep<00:01:02.380> so<00:01:03.010> this<00:01:03.550> Sam<00:01:03.820> for

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
nutrition for the Sheep so this Sam for

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:06.060 
nutrition for the Sheep so this Sam for
example<00:01:04.629> it's<00:01:04.780> very<00:01:04.960> very<00:01:05.199> high<00:01:05.350> protein<00:01:05.650> I

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.070 
example it's very very high protein I

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:07.620 
example it's very very high protein I
mean<00:01:06.400> it's<00:01:06.549> about<00:01:06.759> forty<00:01:07.119> percent<00:01:07.210> protein

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:07.630 
mean it's about forty percent protein

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.020 
mean it's about forty percent protein
but<00:01:08.290> it's<00:01:08.500> um<00:01:08.619> it's<00:01:08.920> a<00:01:09.039> type<00:01:09.249> of<00:01:09.280> protein<00:01:09.609> which

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
but it's um it's a type of protein which

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.510 
but it's um it's a type of protein which
is<00:01:10.060> not<00:01:10.530> degraded<00:01:11.530> in<00:01:11.679> the<00:01:11.710> room<00:01:11.979> and<00:01:12.249> so<00:01:12.429> it

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.520 
is not degraded in the room and so it

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:13.980 
is not degraded in the room and so it
goes<00:01:12.670> straight<00:01:12.850> through<00:01:13.060> to<00:01:13.359> the<00:01:13.450> digestive

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
goes straight through to the digestive

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.349 
goes straight through to the digestive
system<00:01:14.049> and<00:01:14.560> the<00:01:15.009> Lambs<00:01:15.249> absolutely<00:01:15.969> motor<00:01:16.149> on

00:01:16.349 --> 00:01:16.359 
system and the Lambs absolutely motor on

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:20.910 
system and the Lambs absolutely motor on
it<00:01:16.390> it<00:01:16.990> is<00:01:17.140> extraordinary<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:19.990> of<00:01:20.380> course<00:01:20.560> all

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
it it is extraordinary and of course all

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.179 
it it is extraordinary and of course all
all<00:01:21.729> on<00:01:22.479> the<00:01:22.719> basis<00:01:23.079> of<00:01:23.109> deep<00:01:23.409> roots<00:01:23.770> you<00:01:24.069> know

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:24.189 
all on the basis of deep roots you know

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:26.190 
all on the basis of deep roots you know
legumes<00:01:24.789> is<00:01:24.999> what's<00:01:25.179> fixing<00:01:25.420> the<00:01:25.659> nitrogen

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 
legumes is what's fixing the nitrogen

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.559 
legumes is what's fixing the nitrogen
the<00:01:26.619> Sam<00:01:26.859> for<00:01:27.159> in<00:01:27.249> which<00:01:27.460> they've<00:01:27.759> gone<00:01:28.270> for

00:01:28.559 --> 00:01:28.569 
the Sam for in which they've gone for

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:30.929 
the Sam for in which they've gone for
first<00:01:28.869> at<00:01:29.109> some<00:01:29.350> point<00:01:29.619> but<00:01:30.219> the<00:01:30.340> flowers<00:01:30.609> have

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:30.939 
first at some point but the flowers have

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:34.620 
first at some point but the flowers have
gone<00:01:31.119> they've<00:01:31.929> eaten<00:01:32.109> those<00:01:32.350> off<00:01:32.619> first<00:01:33.630> that

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
gone they've eaten those off first that

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.379 
gone they've eaten those off first that
is<00:01:34.810> a<00:01:34.840> tremendous<00:01:35.219> nitrogen<00:01:36.219> fixer<00:01:36.639> so<00:01:37.209> this

00:01:37.379 --> 00:01:37.389 
is a tremendous nitrogen fixer so this

00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:39.690 
is a tremendous nitrogen fixer so this
is<00:01:37.539> there's<00:01:38.020> no<00:01:38.139> no<00:01:38.590> fertilizer<00:01:39.130> going<00:01:39.369> on<00:01:39.520> on

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
is there's no no fertilizer going on on

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.760 
is there's no no fertilizer going on on
this<00:01:39.850> and<00:01:40.329> it's<00:01:40.479> been<00:01:41.109> producing<00:01:41.619> and

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
this and it's been producing and

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.699 
this and it's been producing and
producing<00:01:41.889> for<00:01:42.369> six<00:01:42.579> years<00:01:42.880> so<00:01:43.780> I<00:01:44.079> mean<00:01:44.469> can't

00:01:44.699 --> 00:01:44.709 
producing for six years so I mean can't

00:01:44.709 --> 00:01:48.510 
producing for six years so I mean can't
be<00:01:44.770> about<00:01:44.950> can<00:01:45.189> it<00:01:45.310> and<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:47.799> lamb<00:01:47.950> prices<00:01:48.399> are

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
be about can it and the lamb prices are

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.190 
be about can it and the lamb prices are
up<00:01:48.670> because<00:01:48.969> of<00:01:49.090> cost<00:01:49.329> of<00:01:49.479> fertilizer<00:01:49.959> which

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
up because of cost of fertilizer which

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.569 
up because of cost of fertilizer which
we<00:01:50.350> don't<00:01:50.590> use<00:01:50.829> so<00:01:51.639> jobs<00:01:51.939> are<00:01:52.060> good<00:01:52.179> and<00:01:52.299> really

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
we don't use so jobs are good and really

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.699 
we don't use so jobs are good and really
and<00:01:54.579> it's<00:01:55.029> all<00:01:55.179> very<00:01:55.420> healthy<00:01:55.810> sort<00:01:56.079> of<00:01:56.200> meat

00:01:56.699 --> 00:01:56.709 
and it's all very healthy sort of meat

00:01:56.709 --> 00:01:58.529 
and it's all very healthy sort of meat
if<00:01:57.130> we're<00:01:57.399> in<00:01:57.520> the<00:01:57.639> know<00:01:57.789> the<00:01:58.209> difference

00:01:58.529 --> 00:01:58.539 
if we're in the know the difference

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:01.780 
if we're in the know the difference
between<00:01:58.689> pasture<00:01:59.319> fed<00:01:59.499> and

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:01.790 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.520 

supplemented<00:02:02.790> with<00:02:03.080> cereals<00:02:04.080> which<00:02:04.290> make

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
supplemented with cereals which make

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:05.810 
supplemented with cereals which make
this<00:02:04.680> a<00:02:04.740> very<00:02:05.010> very<00:02:05.100> different<00:02:05.610> product

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
this a very very different product

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.150 
this a very very different product
indeed<00:02:06.270> especially<00:02:07.080> in<00:02:07.440> terms<00:02:07.680> of<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:07.979> health

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
indeed especially in terms of the health

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.870 
indeed especially in terms of the health
benefits<00:02:08.700> of<00:02:08.880> the<00:02:09.030> fatty<00:02:09.479> acid<00:02:09.929> bad<00:02:10.110> balance

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880 
benefits of the fatty acid bad balance

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.220 
benefits of the fatty acid bad balance
pasture-fed<00:02:11.880> is<00:02:12.150> the<00:02:12.300> answer<00:02:12.810> and<00:02:12.959> we<00:02:13.080> ought

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
pasture-fed is the answer and we ought

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.190 
pasture-fed is the answer and we ought
to<00:02:13.260> be<00:02:13.470> able<00:02:13.560> to<00:02:13.800> have<00:02:13.920> a<00:02:14.540> designated<00:02:15.540> label
