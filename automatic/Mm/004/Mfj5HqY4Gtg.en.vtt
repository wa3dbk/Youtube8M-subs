00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.999
 picture of the motto as here the a 

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:08.580
 cappella 02 billion it's a 

00:00:05.999 --> 00:00:10.860
 little worse than the mini it 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.750
 but if I have you then you can do it 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.980
 Come on 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.480
 we already have almost a fair of 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.130
 Therefore, I'll see you later too 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.509
 do not worry we have the option here 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.369
 that's why we also have dual sim 

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:21.329
 actually a relatively good advantage for me 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.159
 can should just talk at the 

00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:24.089
 Special show is the easiest way 

00:00:23.159 --> 00:00:26.400
 tell her the difference between the two 

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:28.320
 see that the two a fiasko hd 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.480
 Of course, having a display is both 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.460
 The same kind of camera, however, here 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.890
 probably just vga and where it is 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.960
 two megapixel quad-core 1.2 gigahertz 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.699
 and the only interesting one either 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.859
 the 4 GB of memory at the Simon are 

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:43.109
 variant plus micro sd memory 

00:00:40.859 --> 00:00:44.879
 expand or you take eight gigabytes 

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:47.550
 in the dual sim variant and then have 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.519
 you do not have a micro sd but we both have one 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.500
 2007 milliampere here in the mini in it 

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:54.989
 while here in 2000 we have the lamp in 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.440
 which is, however, only 3g here 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.329
 no 4g so no lte in the mini so 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.199
 professionals signed but what we on 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.359
 every case is like that 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.439
 metal back already in the middle 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.150
 a bit different from the normal one 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.490
 at the same time in comparison again 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.979
 but sometimes the camera with a flash microphone 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.299
 micro usb and the microphone for 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.840
 calls on probably somewhere 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.939
 here below 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.979
 then we have the side and out 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.600
 switch and regulator and above the 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.850
 headphone jack and of course there's 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.380
 not only in pink 30 years nor the 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.250
 probably sim cards slot or 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.540
 micro sd slot 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.649
 but we also have for example 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.969
 blue or the other day or chance 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:30.990
 a silver you drive all three 

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:33.610
 could 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.170
 here to pick probably soon in 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.710
 germany the price could of course 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.570
 19 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:43.840
 but read that goes on yes 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:45.490
 made we see can pretty quickly 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.049
 with the quad core processor is fun 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.850
 I can use the camera for a short time 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:50.950
 start then we see the daniel here 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.460
 we are still working diligently the camera 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.350
 keeps 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.679
 I 'm actually recording the video 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:58.240
 capable of a photo do with it nor a 

00:01:56.679 --> 00:02:00.069
 a bit sharper on the 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.079
 Front camera change to the rear camera 

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:03.219
 Here we see the nice cable high 

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:04.719
 whole moored or we can 

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:08.560
 the girls do not take pictures of us yet 

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:11.830
 the ones above and then just go 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:14.750
 change over there runs around here 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:17.220
 we see the text quite well 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.330
 under my daniel dresses has the 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.709
 camera a bit blurred though 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.810
 I think I'm fine 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:23.610
 you will receive one all they 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.110
 that's exactly what I like 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.409
 like in the old is that while we 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.090
 but have alcatel surface 

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:31.110
 android vanilla moderately the whole 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.670
 can be used 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.440
 I can show you that best because 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.060
 For example, the original Google 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.519
 Keyboard serves as swift ever 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.989
 after the setup you see it 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:42.900
 all pretty fast I can twist 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:44.040
 and also that it's pleasantly quick as well 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.599
 you can see in comparison especially 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:49.410
 to a 4 inch smartphone the apple 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:55.650
 iphone is the alcatel one touch so 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:58.140
 two mini here one really no too 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.220
 big device 45 2 against 4 inches 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.840
 I would still have a few millimeters 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:04.230
 Differences in height and as I said 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:06.060
 in comparison to go it model 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.349
 They both look the same from the beginning 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.349
 of course that now a black one 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:11.609
 model but if we are the back 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:18.000
 watch is fly away again 

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:19.410
 then we see the camera here 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.940
 little time the vorstÃ¤dter is plastic 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.319
 from onenote here actually one 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.269
 remainder can be compensated 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:25.220
 in the middle but at least a large 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:27.720
 design difference 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.940
 and here is no corresponding 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.380
 agreement side but all things are 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.569
 internally so we built them 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:36.690
 might be able to extend what was the 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:39.530
 short shirts with the alcatel monday two 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.530
 mini factory 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:45.120
