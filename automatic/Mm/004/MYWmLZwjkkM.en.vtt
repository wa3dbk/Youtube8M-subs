00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
den on se 3900 took up and we're able to

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.180 
den on se 3900 took up and we're able to
where<00:02:21.510> we<00:02:21.720> can<00:02:21.930> we<00:02:22.230> can<00:02:22.380> get<00:02:22.530> this<00:02:22.709> actually

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
where we can we can get this actually

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.809 
where we can we can get this actually
working<00:02:23.700> with<00:02:24.170> timecode<00:02:25.170> right<00:02:25.380> here<00:02:25.530> these

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:25.819 
working with timecode right here these

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:30.110 
working with timecode right here these
relative<00:02:26.819> timecode<00:02:27.390> -<00:02:27.959> and<00:02:28.470> now<00:02:28.980> we<00:02:29.850> have<00:02:29.880> the

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
relative timecode - and now we have the

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.320 
relative timecode - and now we have the
ability<00:02:30.450> to<00:02:30.480> scratch<00:02:30.959> and<00:02:31.490> and<00:02:32.490> be<00:02:33.090> able<00:02:33.180> to

effect<00:03:48.560> we've<00:03:49.560> added<00:03:49.769> strip<00:03:50.190> search

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
effect we've added strip search

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.880 
effect we've added strip search
so<00:03:51.120> strip<00:03:51.390> search<00:03:51.630> actually<00:03:52.140> can<00:03:52.320> do<00:03:52.470> several

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
so strip search actually can do several

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.370 
so strip search actually can do several
