talk<00:01:08.460> infected<00:01:09.090> and<00:01:09.409> when<00:01:10.409> I<00:01:10.439> first<00:01:10.619> they

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
talk infected and when I first they

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.190 
talk infected and when I first they
first<00:01:11.460> introduced<00:01:11.850> infected<00:01:12.299> game<00:01:12.630> type<00:01:12.900> it

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
first introduced infected game type it

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.410 
first introduced infected game type it
was<00:01:13.320> really<00:01:13.590> stupid<00:01:13.770> I<00:01:13.979> think<00:01:14.220> yeah<00:01:15.119> when<00:01:15.330> they

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
was really stupid I think yeah when they

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.670 
was really stupid I think yeah when they
first<00:01:15.600> released<00:01:15.900> infected<00:01:16.350> they<00:01:16.500> had

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
first released infected they had

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.260 
first released infected they had
throwing<00:01:17.189> knives<00:01:17.369> equipped<00:01:17.850> onto<00:01:18.030> the

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
throwing knives equipped onto the

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.120 
throwing knives equipped onto the
classes<00:01:18.689> automatically<00:01:19.290> and<00:01:19.500> I<00:01:19.890> found<00:01:20.040> it

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
classes automatically and I found it

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.609 
classes automatically and I found it
really<00:01:20.340> really<00:01:20.610> stupid<00:01:21.240> because<00:01:21.570> you<00:01:22.409> can't

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
really really stupid because you can't

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.890 
really really stupid because you can't
last<00:01:22.830> long<00:01:23.009> when<00:01:24.000> you're<00:01:24.150> playing<00:01:24.390> and<00:01:24.720> all

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
last long when you're playing and all

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.679 
last long when you're playing and all
they<00:01:25.140> also<00:01:25.290> when<00:01:25.920> it<00:01:26.070> first<00:01:26.280> started<00:01:26.549> maps<00:01:27.030> the

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
they also when it first started maps the

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.569 
they also when it first started maps the
matches<00:01:28.200> were<00:01:28.229> only<00:01:28.439> five<00:01:28.740> minutes<00:01:28.920> long<00:01:29.280> I

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
matches were only five minutes long I

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.210 
matches were only five minutes long I
don't<00:01:30.420> find<00:01:30.570> that<00:01:30.659> really<00:01:30.869> much<00:01:31.229> fun<00:01:31.500> because

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
don't find that really much fun because

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.560 
don't find that really much fun because
the<00:01:32.310> matches<00:01:32.610> are<00:01:32.700> too<00:01:32.850> short<00:01:33.030> and<00:01:33.299> they<00:01:33.390> end

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
the matches are too short and they end

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.450 
the matches are too short and they end
really<00:01:33.810> quickly<00:01:34.259> and<00:01:34.470> it's<00:01:35.009> not<00:01:35.130> that<00:01:35.280> fun

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
really quickly and it's not that fun

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.010 
really quickly and it's not that fun
playing<00:01:35.700> in<00:01:35.790> fact<00:01:35.970> because<00:01:36.210> I<00:01:36.270> like<00:01:36.450> I<00:01:36.630> liked

there's my moab another great tip for

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.150 
there's my moab another great tip for
playing<00:03:24.690> infected<00:03:25.170> is<00:03:25.290> that<00:03:25.500> well<00:03:25.980> not

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
playing infected is that well not

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.270 
playing infected is that well not
anymore<00:03:26.400> but<00:03:27.350> find<00:03:28.350> a<00:03:28.440> nice<00:03:28.620> place<00:03:28.650> to<00:03:28.890> hold<00:03:29.190> it

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
anymore but find a nice place to hold it

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.780 
anymore but find a nice place to hold it
down<00:03:29.459> like<00:03:30.030> where<00:03:30.510> we<00:03:30.660> are<00:03:30.780> right<00:03:30.810> now<00:03:30.959> and

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
down like where we are right now and

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.940 
down like where we are right now and
it's<00:03:32.790> kind<00:03:32.970> of<00:03:33.030> funny<00:03:33.240> how<00:03:33.570> like<00:03:34.470> I've<00:03:34.680> been<00:03:34.830> up

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
it's kind of funny how like I've been up

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.590 
it's kind of funny how like I've been up
here<00:03:35.070> for<00:03:35.220> the<00:03:35.310> whole<00:03:35.459> game<00:03:35.760> and<00:03:35.970> if<00:03:36.480> they

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
here for the whole game and if they

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.240 
here for the whole game and if they
actually<00:03:36.840> at<00:03:36.900> the<00:03:36.990> throwing<00:03:37.260> knives<00:03:37.500> I<00:03:37.770> would

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
actually at the throwing knives I would

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:39.350 
actually at the throwing knives I would
probably<00:03:38.370> been<00:03:38.670> dead<00:03:38.850> all<00:03:39.030> of<00:03:39.120> us<00:03:39.209> would

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
probably been dead all of us would

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:40.880 
probably been dead all of us would
probably<00:03:39.660> been<00:03:39.780> dead<00:03:39.959> because<00:03:40.200> now<00:03:40.410> I<00:03:40.620> don't

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
probably been dead because now I don't

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.230 
probably been dead because now I don't
think<00:03:41.040> infected<00:03:41.400> is<00:03:41.490> that<00:03:41.670> much<00:03:41.850> fun<00:03:42.090> without

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:42.240 
think infected is that much fun without

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:45.229 
think infected is that much fun without
um<00:03:42.660> with<00:03:43.260> the<00:03:43.709> throwing<00:03:43.980> knives<00:03:44.190> cuz<00:03:44.580> you<00:03:45.120> know

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
um with the throwing knives cuz you know

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:47.060 
um with the throwing knives cuz you know
just<00:03:45.630> one<00:03:45.959> kid<00:03:46.170> sitting<00:03:46.380> at<00:03:46.530> the<00:03:46.620> top<00:03:46.800> of<00:03:46.860> the

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.070 
just one kid sitting at the top of the

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:49.160 
just one kid sitting at the top of the
hill<00:03:47.220> lining<00:03:47.850> up<00:03:47.940> his<00:03:48.060> shot<00:03:48.300> and<00:03:48.570> then<00:03:49.020> he

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
hill lining up his shot and then he

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:50.690 
hill lining up his shot and then he
throws<00:03:49.380> it<00:03:49.620> man<00:03:49.860> let's<00:03:49.890> just<00:03:50.250> ended<00:03:50.459> the<00:03:50.489> game

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
throws it man let's just ended the game

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.240 
throws it man let's just ended the game
and<00:03:50.820> it<00:03:50.880> ruins<00:03:51.120> it<00:03:51.150> for<00:03:51.209> everyone<00:03:51.650> so<00:03:52.650> I<00:03:52.890> think

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
and it ruins it for everyone so I think

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:54.770 
and it ruins it for everyone so I think
they<00:03:53.340> should<00:03:53.489> really<00:03:53.760> bring<00:03:53.880> back<00:03:54.180> no

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
they should really bring back no

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.170 
they should really bring back no
throwing<00:03:55.170> knives<00:03:55.410> and<00:03:56.220> the<00:03:56.400> 10<00:03:56.610> minute<00:03:56.910> timer

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
throwing knives and the 10 minute timer

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:58.910 
throwing knives and the 10 minute timer
because<00:03:57.750> I<00:03:57.930> think<00:03:58.110> five<00:03:58.410> minutes<00:03:58.709> is<00:03:58.800> too

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
because I think five minutes is too

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.500 
because I think five minutes is too
short<00:03:59.100> amount<00:03:59.370> of<00:03:59.430> time<00:03:59.489> especially<00:04:00.000> to<00:04:00.390> get

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
short amount of time especially to get

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.780 
short amount of time especially to get
him<00:04:00.600> wall<00:04:00.750> before<00:04:00.959> 10<00:04:01.110> Moab<00:04:01.380> I<00:04:01.620> get<00:04:02.370> taken<00:04:02.700> out

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
him wall before 10 Moab I get taken out

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.720 
him wall before 10 Moab I get taken out
right<00:04:03.000> here<00:04:03.270> because<00:04:03.570> we<00:04:03.690> got<00:04:03.780> to<00:04:03.900> swarmed
