and when I applied it and didn't cover

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.700 
and when I applied it and didn't cover
that<00:00:45.930> well<00:00:46.170> so<00:00:46.559> my<00:00:46.710> skin<00:00:46.980> shows<00:00:47.399> through<00:00:47.430> and

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
that well so my skin shows through and

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.630 
that well so my skin shows through and
it<00:00:49.710> wouldn't<00:00:50.190> go<00:00:50.399> on<00:00:50.430> even<00:00:52.160> so<00:00:53.160> there<00:00:53.489> were

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
it wouldn't go on even so there were

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.240 
it wouldn't go on even so there were
certain<00:00:53.910> spots<00:00:54.390> that<00:00:54.719> were<00:00:54.899> wider<00:00:55.379> than<00:00:55.860> other

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
certain spots that were wider than other

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.490 
certain spots that were wider than other
and<00:00:57.239> I<00:00:58.170> tried<00:00:58.500> it<00:00:58.649> with<00:00:59.120> my<00:01:00.120> brushes<00:01:00.500> sponges

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
and I tried it with my brushes sponges

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.859 
and I tried it with my brushes sponges
and<00:01:02.309> with<00:01:02.579> my<00:01:02.699> hands<00:01:03.180> and<00:01:03.390> nothing<00:01:03.480> worked

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.560 

and<00:01:07.470> also<00:01:07.740> another<00:01:08.070> bad<00:01:08.430> thing<00:01:08.850> about<00:01:08.970> it<00:01:09.299> was

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
and also another bad thing about it was

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.520 
and also another bad thing about it was
that<00:01:10.049> it<00:01:10.560> was<00:01:10.890> off<00:01:11.250> pretty<00:01:11.790> easily<00:01:12.060> so<00:01:12.630> it<00:01:13.350> I

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
that it was off pretty easily so it I

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.660 
that it was off pretty easily so it I
don't<00:01:13.860> think<00:01:14.100> it<00:01:14.220> would<00:01:14.430> last<00:01:16.340> that<00:01:17.340> long

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
don't think it would last that long

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.440 
don't think it would last that long
either<00:01:18.650> so<00:01:19.650> I<00:01:19.979> would<00:01:20.280> not<00:01:20.670> recommend<00:01:21.030> this

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
either so I would not recommend this

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:27.770 
either so I would not recommend this
product<00:01:22.790> I<00:01:24.950> have<00:01:25.950> put<00:01:26.790> it<00:01:26.909> away<00:01:27.090> because<00:01:27.659> I

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
product I have put it away because I

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.010 
product I have put it away because I
know<00:01:27.900> I<00:01:27.930> won't<00:01:28.259> use<00:01:28.470> it<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:29.450> instead<00:01:30.450> of<00:01:30.720> this

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
know I won't use it and instead of this

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:43.039 
know I won't use it and instead of this
I<00:01:31.290> use<00:01:38.479> Kryolan<00:01:39.479> TV<00:01:40.290> paint<00:01:40.590> stick<00:01:40.950> and<00:01:42.049> the

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
I use Kryolan TV paint stick and the

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:49.639 
I use Kryolan TV paint stick and the
white<00:01:43.229> one<00:01:43.729> which<00:01:45.439> works<00:01:47.659> like<00:01:48.659> I<00:01:48.899> was<00:01:49.170> hoping

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
white one which works like I was hoping

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.380 
white one which works like I was hoping
this<00:01:50.009> was<00:01:50.280> going<00:01:50.579> to<00:01:50.759> work<00:01:50.939> so<00:01:51.329> I<00:01:52.850> would<00:01:53.850> really

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
this was going to work so I would really

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:03.940 
this was going to work so I would really
recommend<00:01:54.600> this

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.830 

so<00:02:04.950> I<00:02:04.980> definitely<00:02:05.420> definitely<00:02:06.420> recommend

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
so I definitely definitely recommend

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.480 
so I definitely definitely recommend
this<00:02:08.240> because<00:02:09.240> it's<00:02:09.539> really<00:02:10.050> built<00:02:10.679> it's

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:11.490 
this because it's really built it's

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:17.360 
this because it's really built it's
easily<00:02:11.940> to<00:02:12.420> build<00:02:12.660> up<00:02:12.930> and<00:02:14.720> to<00:02:16.070> get<00:02:17.070> an<00:02:17.190> even

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
easily to build up and to get an even

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.850 
easily to build up and to get an even
finish<00:02:17.700> and<00:02:18.180> I<00:02:18.810> would<00:02:18.960> recommend<00:02:19.410> using<00:02:19.620> a

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
finish and I would recommend using a

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.110 
finish and I would recommend using a
sponge<00:02:20.070> with<00:02:20.459> this<00:02:21.470> so<00:02:22.470> I<00:02:22.830> hope<00:02:23.730> you<00:02:23.910> got

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
sponge with this so I hope you got

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.840 
sponge with this so I hope you got
something<00:02:24.480> out<00:02:24.750> of<00:02:24.810> this<00:02:25.200> review<00:02:25.770> and<00:02:26.700> I'll
