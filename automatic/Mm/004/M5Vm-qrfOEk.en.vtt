00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:14.760 
it wasn't really gamertag it was for a

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.450 
it wasn't really gamertag it was for a
different<00:05:15.140> like<00:05:16.140> a<00:05:16.170> different<00:05:16.650> complete

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:17.460 
different like a different complete

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.130

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:26.090 
not an Xbox but I think it's kind of
cool<00:05:22.680> to<00:05:22.980> have<00:05:23.010> a<00:05:23.760> name<00:05:24.270> that's<00:05:24.860> original<00:05:25.860> and

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:26.100 
cool to have a name that's original and

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:28.150 
cool to have a name that's original and

here I'm just giving my opinion of what
I<00:06:15.060> would<00:06:15.270> make<00:06:15.660> as<00:06:15.870> one<00:06:16.130> look<00:06:17.130> at<00:06:17.250> this<00:06:17.370> point<00:06:17.580> I

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:17.640 
I would make as one look at this point I

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:20.180 
I would make as one look at this point I
probably<00:06:17.670> only<00:06:18.330> make<00:06:18.750> the<00:06:19.110> og<00:06:19.680> type<00:06:19.950> gamer

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:20.190 
probably only make the og type gamer

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:22.850 
probably only make the og type gamer
tags<00:06:20.520> where<00:06:20.730> it's<00:06:20.850> got<00:06:21.000> no<00:06:21.240> numbers<00:06:21.690> no<00:06:21.720> xx<00:06:22.500> X's

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:22.860 
tags where it's got no numbers no xx X's

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:25.130 
tags where it's got no numbers no xx X's
and<00:06:23.100> no<00:06:23.280> all<00:06:23.730> capitals<00:06:24.300> and<00:06:24.540> stuff<00:06:24.900> and

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:25.140 
and no all capitals and stuff and

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:26.540 
and no all capitals and stuff and
capitals<00:06:25.620> at<00:06:25.710> the<00:06:25.800> beginning<00:06:26.070> of<00:06:26.130> each<00:06:26.250> letter

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:26.550 
capitals at the beginning of each letter

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:29.240 
capitals at the beginning of each letter
but<00:06:27.270> I<00:06:27.300> mean<00:06:27.570> a<00:06:27.600> year<00:06:27.870> ago<00:06:28.050> I'd<00:06:28.200> probably<00:06:28.680> roll

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:29.250 
but I mean a year ago I'd probably roll

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:30.680
