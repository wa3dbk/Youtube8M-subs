 Minecraft How to create-use a cannon 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.280
 Hello guys. 

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.480
 You see, there's a house there 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.940
 and my friends. 

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:27.060
 And I'm going to destroy it with a cannon. 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.540
 So now I have to build a cannon. 

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:34.920
 So, the first thing you will need is obsidian or any other block 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.480
 you need a button 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.380
 bit of redstone 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.200
 relay 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.980
 a stone slab or any other plate 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.620
 a bucket of water 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.040
 and a bit of TNT. 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.880
 And now we have to wait for the night to come. 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.880
 Why am I on fire? 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.700
 And now we have to put tnt. 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:15.540
 Let's get started. 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.580
 One two three four five six. 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.840
 As you can see, we put it here because it will hit TNT in the front. 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.840
 Now, put TNT in front. 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.200
 Here. 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.900
 Now press the button! 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:46.320
 What is that sound? 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.820
 WHAT? 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.220
 When I find him ... 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.720
 Meanwhile... 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.940
 And this is how ... 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:54.920
 Oh, what's up?!?!
