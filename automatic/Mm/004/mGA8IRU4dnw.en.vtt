00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
very soft and the only things I really

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.389 
very soft and the only things I really
don't<00:01:59.820> like<00:01:59.939> about<00:02:00.240> it<00:02:00.420> is<00:02:00.750> my<00:02:01.619> 24-inch

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
bundles are a lot thinner than the

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.800 
bundles are a lot thinner than the
shorter<00:02:05.280> bundles<00:02:05.670> which<00:02:05.909> are<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:06.240> 20
