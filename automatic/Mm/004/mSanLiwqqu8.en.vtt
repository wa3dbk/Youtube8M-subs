00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
or maybe be the first opening and

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.029 
or maybe be the first opening and
endings<00:00:44.570> for<00:00:44.719> the<00:00:44.809> movie<00:00:45.140> and<00:00:45.320> then<00:00:45.769> later

00:00:46.029 --> 00:00:46.039 
endings for the movie and then later

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:48.459 
endings for the movie and then later
when<00:00:46.309> they<00:00:46.489> actually<00:00:46.820> see<00:00:47.300> it<00:00:47.420> and<00:00:47.629> retype<00:00:48.320> the
