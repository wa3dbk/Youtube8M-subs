00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
many people consider not up to Blizzard

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.330 
many people consider not up to Blizzard
standards<00:01:09.990> for<00:01:10.110> some<00:01:10.290> time<00:01:10.530> but<00:01:10.950> I<00:01:11.010> think<00:01:11.220> with

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
standards for some time but I think with

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.039 
standards for some time but I think with
those<00:01:11.580> changes<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.210> expansion<00:01:12.720> is<00:01:12.840> like<00:01:13.020> a

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
those changes the expansion is like a

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.020 
those changes the expansion is like a
must-buy<00:01:13.590> I'm<00:01:13.950> definitely<00:01:14.369> gonna<00:01:14.729> buy<00:01:14.970> the

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
collectors edition because I think it's

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.730 
collectors edition because I think it's
definitely<00:01:18.090> worth<00:01:18.540> it<00:01:18.689> but<00:01:18.930> yeah<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.470> game<00:01:19.650> is

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
definitely worth it but yeah the game is

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.499 
definitely worth it but yeah the game is
