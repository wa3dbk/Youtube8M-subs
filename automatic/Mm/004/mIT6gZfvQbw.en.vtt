quick<00:00:22.710> here<00:00:23.060> we're<00:00:24.060> gonna<00:00:24.180> create<00:00:24.480> a<00:00:24.539> new

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
quick here we're gonna create a new

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.070 
quick here we're gonna create a new
order<00:00:24.930> or<00:00:25.430> you<00:00:26.430> you<00:00:26.849> select<00:00:27.210> your<00:00:27.359> lab<00:00:27.630> up<00:00:27.840> here

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
order or you you select your lab up here

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.300 
order or you you select your lab up here
from<00:00:28.260> a<00:00:28.349> list<00:00:28.560> of<00:00:28.740> labs<00:00:28.980> that<00:00:29.160> you're

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
from a list of labs that you're

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.490 
from a list of labs that you're
connected<00:00:29.789> to<00:00:29.820> and<00:00:30.150> really<00:00:30.810> it's<00:00:31.230> fairly

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
connected to and really it's fairly

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.830 
connected to and really it's fairly
simple<00:00:31.830> a<00:00:32.009> touchscreen<00:00:32.969> environment<00:00:33.660> so<00:00:33.750> we

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
simple a touchscreen environment so we

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.740 
simple a touchscreen environment so we
select<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.260> tooth<00:00:34.500> that<00:00:34.710> you<00:00:34.800> want<00:00:34.980> to<00:00:35.040> scan

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:35.750 
select the tooth that you want to scan

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.569 
select the tooth that you want to scan
for<00:00:36.750> prep<00:00:37.050> let's<00:00:37.410> say<00:00:37.559> maybe<00:00:38.070> a<00:00:38.190> temporary

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
for prep let's say maybe a temporary

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.750 
for prep let's say maybe a temporary
here<00:00:39.030> and<00:00:39.180> then<00:00:40.140> you<00:00:40.739> can<00:00:40.890> even<00:00:41.010> go<00:00:41.219> in<00:00:41.399> on<00:00:41.579> the

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
here and then you can even go in on the

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.940 
here and then you can even go in on the
tooth<00:00:42.180> itself<00:00:42.600> and<00:00:42.930> make<00:00:43.110> some<00:00:43.320> indications

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
tooth itself and make some indications

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.529 
tooth itself and make some indications
if<00:00:44.100> you<00:00:44.219> want<00:00:44.430> to<00:00:44.520> indicate<00:00:44.879> something<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:45.450> the

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
if you want to indicate something to the

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.590 
if you want to indicate something to the
lab<00:00:45.750> let's<00:00:46.350> say<00:00:46.559> about<00:00:46.770> collars<00:00:47.360> so<00:00:48.360> you<00:00:48.420> can

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
lab let's say about collars so you can

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.680 
lab let's say about collars so you can
do<00:00:48.719> that<00:00:48.870> really<00:00:49.110> easily<00:00:50.180> however<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.539> most

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
do that really easily however the most

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.450 
do that really easily however the most
important<00:00:52.170> of<00:00:52.230> these<00:00:52.440> that<00:00:52.710> is<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.980> scanning

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
important of these that is the scanning

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.119 
important of these that is the scanning
itself<00:00:53.969> and<00:00:54.270> so<00:00:54.989> I<00:00:55.020> have<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.350> scanner<00:00:55.649> here<00:00:55.949> we

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
itself and so I have the scanner here we

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.709 
itself and so I have the scanner here we
have<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.370> tip<00:00:56.610> we<00:00:56.789> can<00:00:56.969> go<00:00:57.090> into<00:00:57.239> the

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
have the tip we can go into the

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.310 
have the tip we can go into the
autoclave<00:00:58.399> and<00:00:59.449> we<00:01:00.449> can<00:01:00.600> either<00:01:00.719> point<00:01:01.109> up

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
autoclave and we can either point up

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.319 
autoclave and we can either point up
words<00:01:01.649> we<00:01:01.829> use<00:01:02.100> that<00:01:02.280> typically<00:01:02.609> for<00:01:02.699> aperture

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
words we use that typically for aperture

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.170 
words we use that typically for aperture
scanning<00:01:03.840> or<00:01:04.769> or<00:01:05.220> down<00:01:05.460> what<00:01:05.670> would<00:01:06.000> be

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
scanning or or down what would be

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.469 
scanning or or down what would be
typically<00:01:06.659> for<00:01:06.900> lower<00:01:07.080> jaw<00:01:07.380> scanning<00:01:08.060> so<00:01:09.060> I'm

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
typically for lower jaw scanning so I'm

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.539 
typically for lower jaw scanning so I'm
just<00:01:09.720> gonna<00:01:09.840> go<00:01:10.049> ahead<00:01:10.200> here<00:01:10.740> scan<00:01:13.189> again<00:01:14.189> no

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
just gonna go ahead here scan again no

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.550 
just gonna go ahead here scan again no
powder<00:01:14.880> or<00:01:15.060> anything<00:01:15.299> so<00:01:15.689> you<00:01:15.780> can<00:01:15.930> just<00:01:16.140> just

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
powder or anything so you can just just

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:36.300 
powder or anything so you can just just
directly<00:01:17.040> go<00:01:17.159> ahead

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.859 

so<00:01:37.310> happier<00:01:37.609> there<00:01:37.880> the<00:01:38.179> lower<00:01:38.359> you<00:01:38.630> are<00:01:38.689> you

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 
so happier there the lower you are you

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:39.910 
so happier there the lower you are you
can<00:01:39.020> take<00:01:39.049> a<00:01:39.200> quick<00:01:39.469> look

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
can take a quick look

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.559 
can take a quick look
does<00:01:40.340> it<00:01:40.490> get<00:01:40.759> a<00:01:40.819> little<00:01:40.939> bit<00:01:41.060> of<00:01:41.240> the<00:01:41.329> cheek

00:01:41.559 --> 00:01:41.569 
does it get a little bit of the cheek

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:43.179 
does it get a little bit of the cheek
here<00:01:41.810> that's<00:01:42.020> not<00:01:42.229> a<00:01:42.259> problem<00:01:42.560> you<00:01:42.770> can<00:01:42.829> trim

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:43.189 
here that's not a problem you can trim

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:46.089 
here that's not a problem you can trim
that<00:01:43.219> away<00:01:43.369> really<00:01:43.819> easily<00:01:43.909> so<00:01:44.859> Pat's<00:01:45.859> like

00:01:46.089 --> 00:01:46.099 
that away really easily so Pat's like

00:01:46.099 --> 00:01:50.499 
that away really easily so Pat's like
this<00:01:46.340> and<00:01:46.670> like<00:01:47.569> that<00:01:47.599> so<00:01:48.759> then<00:01:49.759> moving<00:01:49.969> up<00:01:50.270> to

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 
this and like that so then moving up to

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:52.569 
this and like that so then moving up to
their<00:01:50.719> to<00:01:51.140> their<00:01:51.349> exit<00:01:52.189> that<00:01:52.280> was<00:01:52.369> awkward

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:52.579 
their to their exit that was awkward

00:01:52.579 --> 00:02:24.420 
their to their exit that was awkward
you're<00:01:52.849> now<00:01:53.030> moving<00:01:53.270> to<00:01:53.509> the<00:01:53.539> lower<00:01:53.750> drawer

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.569 

and<00:02:25.430> now<00:02:25.969> for<00:02:26.209> the<00:02:26.299> bytes<00:02:27.099> click<00:02:28.099> over<00:02:28.280> here

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:28.579 
and now for the bytes click over here

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:29.949 
and now for the bytes click over here
and<00:02:28.790> for<00:02:28.939> the<00:02:29.030> Pied<00:02:29.209> you<00:02:29.359> just<00:02:29.569> need<00:02:29.719> a<00:02:29.750> little

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
and for the Pied you just need a little

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:40.179 
and for the Pied you just need a little
bit<00:02:37.750> so<00:02:38.750> it's<00:02:38.959> as<00:02:39.109> simple<00:02:39.140> as<00:02:39.470> that<00:02:39.530> for<00:02:40.099> the

00:02:40.179 --> 00:02:40.189 
bit so it's as simple as that for the

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:42.069 
bit so it's as simple as that for the
pike<00:02:40.400> you<00:02:40.430> don't<00:02:40.730> need<00:02:40.879> so<00:02:41.030> much<00:02:41.239> data<00:02:41.750> you

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:42.079 
pike you don't need so much data you

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:43.360 
pike you don't need so much data you
basically<00:02:42.470> need<00:02:42.650> a<00:02:42.680> little<00:02:42.829> bit<00:02:42.950> of<00:02:43.099> the<00:02:43.220> upper

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
basically need a little bit of the upper

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:44.890 
basically need a little bit of the upper
jaw<00:02:43.760> and<00:02:43.790> the<00:02:44.060> lower<00:02:44.239> jaw<00:02:44.540> and<00:02:44.719> then<00:02:44.840> the

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
jaw and the lower jaw and then the

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.750 
jaw and the lower jaw and then the
software<00:02:45.230> is<00:02:45.349> gonna<00:02:45.560> automatically<00:02:46.310> align<00:02:46.549> it

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
software is gonna automatically align it

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.729 
software is gonna automatically align it
so<00:02:47.389> I<00:02:47.420> guess<00:02:47.720> I<00:02:47.870> don't<00:02:47.900> know<00:02:48.139> how<00:02:48.530> much<00:02:48.680> that

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
so I guess I don't know how much that

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:51.970 
so I guess I don't know how much that
time<00:02:49.189> was<00:02:49.430> but<00:02:49.670> I<00:02:49.700> think<00:02:49.849> maybe<00:02:50.349> one<00:02:51.349> minute<00:02:51.650> 20

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
time was but I think maybe one minute 20

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.129 
time was but I think maybe one minute 20
seconds<00:02:52.459> about<00:02:53.090> that<00:02:53.450> you<00:02:53.659> have<00:02:53.810> the<00:02:53.900> full

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:54.139 
seconds about that you have the full

00:02:54.139 --> 00:02:56.920 
seconds about that you have the full
full<00:02:54.669> the<00:02:55.669> scan<00:02:55.909> from<00:02:56.120> the<00:02:56.269> quarter<00:02:56.629> upper

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
full the scan from the quarter upper

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.720 
full the scan from the quarter upper
lower<00:02:57.139> and<00:02:57.439> would<00:02:57.799> be<00:02:57.919> sufficient<00:02:58.489> for<00:02:58.519> a

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
lower and would be sufficient for a

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.099 
lower and would be sufficient for a
typical<00:02:59.480> molar<00:03:00.519> situation<00:03:01.840> now<00:03:02.840> there's<00:03:03.049> a

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:03.109 
typical molar situation now there's a

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:05.559 
typical molar situation now there's a
few<00:03:03.409> tools<00:03:03.680> that<00:03:03.980> I<00:03:04.010> want<00:03:04.220> to<00:03:04.280> show<00:03:04.459> you<00:03:04.569> where

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:05.569 
few tools that I want to show you where

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:07.960 
few tools that I want to show you where
you<00:03:05.629> can<00:03:05.659> quickly<00:03:06.200> analyze<00:03:06.470> your<00:03:06.950> scan<00:03:07.370> so

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
you can quickly analyze your scan so

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:09.429 
you can quickly analyze your scan so
obviously<00:03:08.329> you<00:03:08.450> can<00:03:08.510> just<00:03:08.750> move<00:03:08.900> ahead<00:03:09.049> and

00:03:09.429 --> 00:03:09.439 
obviously you can just move ahead and

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:11.349 
obviously you can just move ahead and
directly<00:03:10.189> send<00:03:10.489> it<00:03:10.579> to<00:03:10.700> the<00:03:10.849> lab<00:03:11.030> but<00:03:11.239> you<00:03:11.269> can

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:11.359 
directly send it to the lab but you can

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:13.659 
directly send it to the lab but you can
also<00:03:11.599> do<00:03:11.900> a<00:03:11.930> quick<00:03:12.139> analyzes<00:03:12.859> let's<00:03:13.459> say<00:03:13.609> you

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:13.669 
also do a quick analyzes let's say you

00:03:13.669 --> 00:03:15.940 
also do a quick analyzes let's say you
want<00:03:13.970> to<00:03:14.030> see<00:03:14.239> the<00:03:14.480> the<00:03:14.930> contact<00:03:15.470> points<00:03:15.829> of

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
want to see the the contact points of

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:18.069 
want to see the the contact points of
your<00:03:15.980> scan<00:03:16.430> so<00:03:17.120> then<00:03:17.329> you<00:03:17.419> can<00:03:17.569> go<00:03:17.659> ahead<00:03:17.930> here

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:18.079 
your scan so then you can go ahead here

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:19.689 
your scan so then you can go ahead here
and<00:03:18.139> say<00:03:18.379> clearance<00:03:18.859> you<00:03:19.189> want<00:03:19.400> to<00:03:19.459> see<00:03:19.579> the

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:19.699 
and say clearance you want to see the

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:21.819 
and say clearance you want to see the
clearance<00:03:20.030> from<00:03:20.150> the<00:03:20.329> prep<00:03:20.599> and<00:03:20.870> you<00:03:21.470> can<00:03:21.620> turn

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:21.829 
clearance from the prep and you can turn

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:23.949 
clearance from the prep and you can turn
on<00:03:21.979> one<00:03:22.220> door<00:03:22.489> so<00:03:22.760> here<00:03:22.970> you<00:03:23.120> see<00:03:23.150> that<00:03:23.510> the

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959 
on one door so here you see that the

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:25.960 
on one door so here you see that the
contacts<00:03:24.709> and<00:03:24.949> the<00:03:25.220> clearance<00:03:25.579> from<00:03:25.760> the

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
contacts and the clearance from the

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:27.339 
contacts and the clearance from the
upper<00:03:26.209> door<00:03:26.419> and<00:03:26.599> you<00:03:26.690> can<00:03:26.810> even<00:03:26.930> change<00:03:27.199> the

00:03:27.339 --> 00:03:27.349 
upper door and you can even change the

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:28.930 
upper door and you can even change the
column<00:03:27.769> map<00:03:27.949> here<00:03:28.220> to<00:03:28.340> have<00:03:28.489> different

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
column map here to have different

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.659 
column map here to have different
clearance<00:03:29.810> picture<00:03:30.169> you<00:03:30.769> could<00:03:30.949> also<00:03:31.129> go<00:03:31.489> in

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:31.669 
clearance picture you could also go in

00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:34.449 
clearance picture you could also go in
and<00:03:32.000> say<00:03:32.319> direction<00:03:33.319> here<00:03:33.680> and<00:03:33.829> then<00:03:34.280> it<00:03:34.370> will

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
and say direction here and then it will

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:36.490 
and say direction here and then it will
show<00:03:34.729> you<00:03:34.790> the<00:03:35.120> the<00:03:35.389> undercut<00:03:35.930> so<00:03:36.109> if<00:03:36.229> you<00:03:36.349> have

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
show you the the undercut so if you have

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.770 
show you the the undercut so if you have
two<00:03:36.799> preps<00:03:37.159> or<00:03:37.370> three<00:03:37.609> preps<00:03:37.940> you<00:03:38.090> can<00:03:38.239> do<00:03:38.389> come

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
two preps or three preps you can do come

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.750 
two preps or three preps you can do come
against<00:03:39.199> if<00:03:39.349> against<00:03:39.650> and<00:03:39.949> other<00:03:40.519> nice

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
against if against and other nice

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.089 
against if against and other nice
feature<00:03:41.120> is<00:03:41.419> that<00:03:41.659> let's<00:03:42.260> say<00:03:42.409> on<00:03:42.590> the<00:03:42.709> upper

00:03:43.089 --> 00:03:43.099 
feature is that let's say on the upper

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:46.030 
feature is that let's say on the upper
door<00:03:43.400> that<00:03:44.090> you<00:03:44.810> you<00:03:45.049> had<00:03:45.229> a<00:03:45.260> prep<00:03:45.560> now<00:03:45.739> I<00:03:45.769> don't

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040 
door that you you had a prep now I don't

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.009 
door that you you had a prep now I don't
have<00:03:46.310> any<00:03:46.430> preps<00:03:46.760> really<00:03:47.090> here<00:03:47.389> but<00:03:47.810> if<00:03:47.900> you

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:48.019 
have any preps really here but if you

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:50.289 
have any preps really here but if you
want<00:03:48.199> to<00:03:48.290> go<00:03:48.379> back<00:03:48.709> and<00:03:48.949> rescan<00:03:49.519> or<00:03:49.790> you<00:03:50.120> want

00:03:50.289 --> 00:03:50.299 
want to go back and rescan or you want

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:53.409 
want to go back and rescan or you want
to<00:03:50.500> prep<00:03:51.500> more<00:03:51.769> and<00:03:52.069> then<00:03:52.220> scan<00:03:52.549> again<00:03:52.849> it's

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:53.419 
to prep more and then scan again it's

00:03:53.419 --> 00:03:55.869 
to prep more and then scan again it's
very<00:03:53.659> simple<00:03:54.079> you<00:03:54.229> go<00:03:54.379> back<00:03:54.680> click<00:03:55.519> on<00:03:55.760> the

00:03:55.869 --> 00:03:55.879 
very simple you go back click on the

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:59.140 
very simple you go back click on the
upper<00:03:56.180> door<00:03:56.449> oops<00:03:56.780> upper<00:03:57.290> jaw<00:03:57.500> here<00:03:57.909> like<00:03:58.909> this

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
upper door oops upper jaw here like this

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.500 
upper door oops upper jaw here like this
and<00:03:59.479> then<00:03:59.629> you<00:03:59.720> can<00:03:59.870> take<00:04:00.079> away<00:04:01.510> basically

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
and then you can take away basically

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:05.110 
and then you can take away basically
trim<00:04:02.810> away<00:04:02.959> here<00:04:03.439> like<00:04:03.650> a<00:04:03.680> part<00:04:04.099> of<00:04:04.220> the<00:04:04.400> prep

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
trim away here like a part of the prep

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.089 
trim away here like a part of the prep
let's<00:04:05.389> say<00:04:05.569> it<00:04:05.629> was<00:04:05.780> the<00:04:05.930> prep<00:04:06.169> and<00:04:06.439> then<00:04:07.010> you

00:04:07.089 --> 00:04:07.099 
let's say it was the prep and then you

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:09.280 
let's say it was the prep and then you
want<00:04:07.310> to<00:04:07.400> obviously<00:04:08.060> then<00:04:08.299> you<00:04:08.329> prep<00:04:09.019> a<00:04:09.049> little

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290 
want to obviously then you prep a little

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:11.259 
want to obviously then you prep a little
bit<00:04:09.379> more<00:04:09.560> on<00:04:09.650> the<00:04:09.769> patient<00:04:10.250> and<00:04:10.430> you<00:04:10.970> want<00:04:11.180> to

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:11.269 
bit more on the patient and you want to

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:13.479 
bit more on the patient and you want to
come<00:04:11.479> in<00:04:11.659> and<00:04:11.900> and<00:04:12.500> do<00:04:12.709> a<00:04:12.769> little<00:04:12.919> bit<00:04:13.099> scanning

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:13.489 
come in and and do a little bit scanning

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:15.580 
come in and and do a little bit scanning
from<00:04:13.669> there<00:04:13.909> so<00:04:14.689> then<00:04:14.840> you<00:04:14.959> can<00:04:15.079> easily<00:04:15.379> go

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
from there so then you can easily go

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:23.850 
from there so then you can easily go
back

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:27.820 

and<00:04:25.300> then<00:04:26.300> directly<00:04:26.720> fill-in<00:04:27.139> again<00:04:27.410> here<00:04:27.680> so

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
and then directly fill-in again here so

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:29.050 
and then directly fill-in again here so
you<00:04:27.889> don't<00:04:28.040> need<00:04:28.160> to<00:04:28.310> rescan<00:04:28.760> the<00:04:28.790> whole

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.060 
you don't need to rescan the whole

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.750 
you don't need to rescan the whole
situation<00:04:29.770> another<00:04:30.770> thing<00:04:31.070> is<00:04:31.250> if<00:04:31.430> you<00:04:31.550> want

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.760 
situation another thing is if you want

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.909 
situation another thing is if you want
more<00:04:31.970> of<00:04:32.060> the<00:04:32.180> mandible<00:04:32.540> area<00:04:33.200> scanned<00:04:33.650> then

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:33.919 
more of the mandible area scanned then

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:35.379 
more of the mandible area scanned then
you<00:04:34.040> can<00:04:34.190> easily<00:04:34.310> do<00:04:34.610> that<00:04:34.639> you<00:04:35.000> just<00:04:35.210> come

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:35.389 
you can easily do that you just come

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:54.580 
you can easily do that you just come
back<00:04:52.120> so<00:04:53.120> it<00:04:53.240> literally<00:04:53.450> scans<00:04:53.810> any<00:04:54.080> surface

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:54.590 
back so it literally scans any surface

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:56.200 
back so it literally scans any surface
that<00:04:54.800> comes<00:04:55.010> in<00:04:55.160> front<00:04:55.400> of<00:04:55.520> it<00:04:55.669> whether<00:04:55.940> it's

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:56.210 
that comes in front of it whether it's

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:59.530
