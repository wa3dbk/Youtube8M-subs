00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
differ too much there however as we

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.680 
differ too much there however as we
continue<00:02:24.550> the<00:02:24.880> first<00:02:25.090> thing<00:02:25.240> we<00:02:25.330> were<00:02:25.420> taking

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
however the sc-2010 will start to drop

top of that was a final third point to

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:11.040 
top of that was a final third point to
take<00:04:09.370> a<00:04:09.430> look<00:04:09.700> at<00:04:09.880> which<00:04:10.060> will<00:04:10.239> round<00:04:10.630> off<00:04:10.840> how

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.050 
take a look at which will round off how

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:12.960 
take a look at which will round off how
these<00:04:11.230> weapons<00:04:11.410> do<00:04:11.890> their<00:04:12.100> damage<00:04:12.340> the

these weapons do their damage the
sc-2010<00:04:13.720> will<00:04:14.080> shoot<00:04:14.260> at<00:04:14.440> 750<00:04:15.430> rounds<00:04:15.550> per

sc-2010 will shoot at 750 rounds per

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:16.170 
sc-2010 will shoot at 750 rounds per
minute

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
minute

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.000 
minute
whereas<00:04:16.570> the<00:04:16.630> Remington<00:04:16.959> r5<00:04:17.169> will<00:04:17.560> only<00:04:17.799> be

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010 
whereas the Remington r5 will only be

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:21.300 
whereas the Remington r5 will only be
shooting<00:04:18.370> at<00:04:18.459> around<00:04:18.669> about<00:04:18.989> 631<00:04:20.190> rounds<00:04:21.190> per

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:23.340 
shooting at around about 631 rounds per
minute<00:04:21.430> so<00:04:22.120> some<00:04:22.360> differences<00:04:22.810> there<00:04:22.870> between

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:23.350 
minute so some differences there between

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:26.070 
minute so some differences there between
both<00:04:23.590> of<00:04:23.740> the<00:04:23.830> weapons<00:04:24.190> some<00:04:24.580> very<00:04:24.789> in<00:04:25.060> detail

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 
both of the weapons some very in detail

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.050 
both of the weapons some very in detail
that<00:04:26.199> however<00:04:26.919> how<00:04:27.280> does<00:04:27.520> this<00:04:27.610> actually

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
that however how does this actually

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.550 
that however how does this actually
equate<00:04:28.360> to<00:04:28.539> the<00:04:28.629> number<00:04:28.900> of<00:04:28.990> bullets<00:04:29.349> it<00:04:29.470> will

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
equate to the number of bullets it will

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.320 
equate to the number of bullets it will
take<00:04:29.740> to<00:04:29.889> kill<00:04:30.099> with<00:04:30.430> these<00:04:30.610> weapons<00:04:30.879> but

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
take to kill with these weapons but

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:32.760 
take to kill with these weapons but
first<00:04:31.720> of<00:04:31.930> all<00:04:31.990> we<00:04:32.110> need<00:04:32.169> to<00:04:32.259> take<00:04:32.409> a<00:04:32.470> look<00:04:32.650> at

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
first of all we need to take a look at

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:34.469 
first of all we need to take a look at
the<00:04:32.830> headshot<00:04:33.220> multipliers<00:04:33.699> we<00:04:34.000> can<00:04:34.150> see<00:04:34.300> them

00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:34.479 
the headshot multipliers we can see them

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:36.450

enemy you're shooting at and now we can
take<00:04:41.800> a<00:04:41.860> look<00:04:42.159> at<00:04:42.370> how<00:04:42.610> many<00:04:42.669> bullets<00:04:43.180> it<00:04:43.300> would

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:43.389 
take a look at how many bullets it would

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:45.270 
take a look at how many bullets it would
take<00:04:43.569> to<00:04:43.719> drop<00:04:44.020> an<00:04:44.199> enemy<00:04:44.560> at<00:04:44.919> both<00:04:45.099> the

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:25.170 
taking into account upwards and sideways
recoil<00:05:23.080> the<00:05:23.800> sc-2010<00:05:24.580> will<00:05:24.789> have<00:05:24.939> slightly

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:25.180 
recoil the sc-2010 will have slightly

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:27.269 
recoil the sc-2010 will have slightly
greater<00:05:25.750> recoil<00:05:26.319> to<00:05:26.500> the<00:05:26.529> left<00:05:26.830> and<00:05:27.039> to<00:05:27.250> the

00:05:27.269 --> 00:05:27.279 
greater recoil to the left and to the

00:05:27.279 --> 00:05:29.429 
greater recoil to the left and to the
right<00:05:27.400> where<00:05:28.120> the<00:05:28.300> Remington<00:05:28.750> r5<00:05:28.900> will<00:05:29.289> have

00:05:29.429 --> 00:05:29.439 
right where the Remington r5 will have

00:05:29.439 --> 00:05:31.890 
right where the Remington r5 will have
much<00:05:29.830> more<00:05:30.039> recoil<00:05:30.400> upwards<00:05:31.150> so<00:05:31.629> it<00:05:31.719> means

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:31.900 
much more recoil upwards so it means

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:33.689 
much more recoil upwards so it means
that<00:05:32.080> overall<00:05:32.529> the<00:05:32.710> Remington<00:05:33.069> r5<00:05:33.219> will<00:05:33.580> have

00:05:33.689 --> 00:05:33.699 
that overall the Remington r5 will have

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:35.219 
that overall the Remington r5 will have
a<00:05:33.729> little<00:05:34.000> bit<00:05:34.150> more<00:05:34.449> kick<00:05:34.719> while<00:05:35.080> you're

00:05:35.219 --> 00:05:35.229 
a little bit more kick while you're

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:37.080 
a little bit more kick while you're
shooting<00:05:35.440> the<00:05:35.740> weapon<00:05:35.919> so<00:05:36.580> that's<00:05:36.729> covering
