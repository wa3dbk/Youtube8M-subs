here I better get a lighter one here

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.609 
here I better get a lighter one here
though<00:00:16.369> here's<00:00:17.369> the<00:00:17.640> little<00:00:18.329> spot<00:00:19.289> that<00:00:19.499> I'm

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
though here's the little spot that I'm

going<00:00:19.919> to<00:00:20.159> work<00:00:20.699> on<00:00:20.970> and<00:00:21.269> I'll<00:00:21.689> probably<00:00:21.869> only

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
going to work on and I'll probably only

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.140 
going to work on and I'll probably only
just<00:00:22.560> do<00:00:22.679> a<00:00:22.710> portion<00:00:23.130> of<00:00:23.189> this<00:00:23.400> just<00:00:23.640> trying<00:00:23.970> to

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150

just do a portion of this just trying to
get<00:00:24.269> you<00:00:24.449> off<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:24.720> ground<00:00:24.960> so<00:00:25.890> that<00:00:25.919> you<00:00:26.159> can

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
get you off the ground so that you can

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.579 
get you off the ground so that you can
then<00:00:26.640> take<00:00:26.970> whatever<00:00:27.810> portion<00:00:28.109> you<00:00:28.289> want<00:00:28.439> to

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:28.589

and<00:00:32.669> keep<00:00:33.210> this<00:00:33.480> one<00:00:33.719> in<00:00:33.750> here<00:00:34.260> I<00:00:34.410> think<00:00:34.859> that

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
and keep this one in here I think that

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.810 
and keep this one in here I think that
the<00:00:35.430> hair<00:00:35.789> is<00:00:36.090> a<00:00:36.120> little<00:00:36.570> bit<00:00:36.719> unusual<00:00:37.820> you'll

find this though in when you're doing a

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:47.540 
find this though in when you're doing a
portrait<00:00:41.780> it<00:00:42.780> may<00:00:43.500> be<00:00:43.820> totally<00:00:45.980> wrong<00:00:46.980> to<00:00:47.370> put

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
this in here you have to decide is this

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.610 
this in here you have to decide is this
odd<00:00:50.820> will<00:00:51.510> it<00:00:51.600> ever<00:00:51.719> translate<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.469> way<00:00:52.589> I

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
odd will it ever translate the way I

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.340 
odd will it ever translate the way I
want<00:00:52.980> it<00:00:53.179> if<00:00:54.179> I<00:00:54.390> decide<00:00:54.719> to<00:00:54.839> put<00:00:54.960> it<00:00:55.050> in<00:00:55.140> later

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
want it if I decide to put it in later

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.169 
want it if I decide to put it in later
have<00:00:55.620> I<00:00:55.710> laid<00:00:55.890> down<00:00:56.100> my<00:00:56.160> graphite<00:00:56.760> so<00:00:56.969> that<00:00:57.089> I

00:00:57.169 --> 00:00:57.179 
have I laid down my graphite so that I

00:00:57.179 --> 00:01:00.889 
have I laid down my graphite so that I
can<00:00:57.359> actually<00:00:57.920> take<00:00:58.920> this<00:00:59.190> out<00:00:59.460> if<00:01:00.179> I<00:01:00.420> want<00:01:00.690> to

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
can actually take this out if I want to

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.979 
can actually take this out if I want to
I<00:01:01.109> want<00:01:02.070> to<00:01:02.309> because<00:01:02.760> I<00:01:02.789> can't<00:01:02.940> make<00:01:03.390> all<00:01:03.690> the

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
I want to because I can't make all the

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.370 
I want to because I can't make all the
decisions<00:01:04.140> right<00:01:04.940> right<00:01:05.940> from<00:01:06.120> the<00:01:06.270> start<00:01:06.570> but

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
decisions right right from the start but

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.130 
decisions right right from the start but
I<00:01:07.440> may<00:01:07.830> want<00:01:08.100> to<00:01:08.310> again<00:01:08.790> have<00:01:09.390> an<00:01:09.570> opportunity

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
I may want to again have an opportunity

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.610 
I may want to again have an opportunity
to<00:01:10.260> have<00:01:10.350> an<00:01:10.500> uninterrupted<00:01:11.430> stroke<00:01:12.150> and

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:12.620 
to have an uninterrupted stroke and

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.140 
to have an uninterrupted stroke and
sometimes<00:01:13.620> when<00:01:13.800> I<00:01:13.830> try<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:14.190> try<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:14.880> draw

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
sometimes when I try to try to draw

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.770 
sometimes when I try to try to draw
every<00:01:15.710> inconsistency<00:01:17.600> sometimes<00:01:18.600> it

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
every inconsistency sometimes it

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.290 
every inconsistency sometimes it
interrupts<00:01:19.260> maybe<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:20.100> beauty<00:01:20.520> and<00:01:20.670> flow<00:01:21.000> of

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:21.300 
interrupts maybe the beauty and flow of

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.060 
interrupts maybe the beauty and flow of
what<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:21.930> hair<00:01:22.140> could<00:01:22.440> have<00:01:22.560> been<00:01:22.710> had<00:01:22.920> I<00:01:22.950> not

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
what the hair could have been had I not

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.360 
what the hair could have been had I not
included<00:01:23.850> that<00:01:23.880> and<00:01:24.270> so<00:01:25.110> I'm<00:01:25.470> trying<00:01:25.920> to<00:01:26.040> leave

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:26.370 
included that and so I'm trying to leave

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:30.290 
included that and so I'm trying to leave
open<00:01:26.820> my<00:01:27.560> decision-making<00:01:28.560> process<00:01:29.310> all<00:01:29.520> the

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:30.300 
open my decision-making process all the

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:31.490 
open my decision-making process all the
way<00:01:30.330> through<00:01:30.720> my<00:01:30.870> drawing

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
way through my drawing

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:41.800 
way through my drawing
so<00:01:31.920> let's<00:01:32.490> come<00:01:32.760> in<00:01:32.910> here<00:01:32.940> and<00:01:33.210> make<00:01:33.360> this

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.720 

know<00:01:42.810> that<00:01:42.990> I'm<00:01:43.860> gonna<00:01:44.040> just<00:01:44.280> try<00:01:44.490> and<00:01:44.550> get<00:01:44.670> a

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:44.730 
know that I'm gonna just try and get a

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:46.160 
know that I'm gonna just try and get a
feel<00:01:44.940> for<00:01:45.030> it<00:01:45.300> I<00:01:45.390> could<00:01:45.600> have<00:01:45.690> done<00:01:45.810> this<00:01:45.960> with

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
feel for it I could have done this with

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:52.550 
feel for it I could have done this with
my<00:01:46.350> my<00:01:49.400> 4-h<00:01:50.400> -<00:01:50.760> I'm<00:01:51.390> going<00:01:51.720> to<00:01:51.900> now<00:01:52.080> take

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
my my 4-h - I'm going to now take

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.880 
my my 4-h - I'm going to now take
advantage<00:01:53.070> of<00:01:53.310> this<00:01:53.760> and<00:01:54.470> I'm<00:01:55.470> going<00:01:55.830> to

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
advantage of this and I'm going to

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.520 
advantage of this and I'm going to
create<00:01:56.610> a<00:01:56.640> little<00:01:56.820> bit<00:01:56.970> of<00:01:57.150> a<00:01:57.180> buffer<00:01:57.570> zone

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
making sure I'm closing the gap so doing

making sure I'm closing the gap so doing
this<00:02:04.080> quickly<00:02:04.380> I<00:02:04.530> may<00:02:04.770> not<00:02:04.950> be<00:02:05.070> as<00:02:05.180> has<00:02:06.180> you

it gives me some forgiveness then I got
I'm<00:02:23.130> not<00:02:23.310> paying<00:02:23.550> attention<00:02:23.670> and<00:02:24.120> I've<00:02:24.209> got<00:02:24.480> my

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
I'm not paying attention and I've got my

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:25.820 
I'm not paying attention and I've got my
strokes<00:02:24.990> maybe<00:02:25.230> going<00:02:25.440> the<00:02:25.500> wrong<00:02:25.620> direction

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
strokes maybe going the wrong direction

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.280 
strokes maybe going the wrong direction
so<00:02:26.160> it<00:02:26.370> looks<00:02:26.550> like<00:02:26.730> this<00:02:26.940> kind<00:02:27.240> of<00:02:27.330> curls<00:02:28.080> this

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
so it looks like this kind of curls this

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.780 
so it looks like this kind of curls this
way<00:02:28.500> because<00:02:28.830> it's<00:02:29.010> going<00:02:29.100> to<00:02:29.190> become<00:02:29.490> a<00:02:29.520> part

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
way because it's going to become a part

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.310 
way because it's going to become a part
of<00:02:29.850> this<00:02:30.060> or<00:02:30.480> it<00:02:30.720> could<00:02:30.870> be<00:02:30.990> something

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
of this or it could be something

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.470 
of this or it could be something
underneath<00:02:31.560> but<00:02:32.100> let's<00:02:32.280> just<00:02:32.459> get<00:02:32.940> it<00:02:33.090> back<00:02:33.120> on

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
underneath but let's just get it back on

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.060 
underneath but let's just get it back on
track<00:02:33.630> here<00:02:34.110> and<00:02:34.340> have<00:02:35.340> that<00:02:35.580> nice<00:02:37.070> transition

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
track here and have that nice transition

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:41.690 
track here and have that nice transition
into<00:02:38.310> that<00:02:38.340> bend<00:02:38.880> that<00:02:39.870> curl<00:02:40.550> but<00:02:41.550> the

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
into that bend that curl but the

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.940 
into that bend that curl but the
interesting<00:02:42.240> part<00:02:42.450> about<00:02:42.690> this<00:02:42.900> -<00:02:43.110> Ike<00:02:43.560> if<00:02:43.830> I

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
interesting part about this - Ike if I

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.530 
interesting part about this - Ike if I
felt<00:02:44.190> it<00:02:44.250> was<00:02:44.340> too<00:02:44.489> dominant<00:02:44.940> I<00:02:45.030> could<00:02:45.239> take<00:02:45.420> it

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
felt it was too dominant I could take it

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:52.699 
felt it was too dominant I could take it
out<00:02:49.310> but<00:02:50.310> the<00:02:51.209> hair<00:02:51.570> look<00:02:52.290> at<00:02:52.410> all<00:02:52.590> the

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
out but the hair look at all the

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:53.860 
out but the hair look at all the
variations<00:02:53.220> in<00:02:53.400> here

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
variations in here

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.720 
variations in here
none<00:02:54.870> of<00:02:54.900> these<00:02:55.080> are<00:02:55.320> exactly<00:02:55.769> parallel<00:02:56.489> I

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
none of these are exactly parallel I

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.030 
none of these are exactly parallel I
have<00:02:57.420> spaces<00:02:58.170> which<00:02:58.560> we're<00:02:58.709> going<00:02:58.800> to<00:02:58.860> take

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
have spaces which we're going to take

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.500 
have spaces which we're going to take
advantage<00:02:59.489> of<00:02:59.640> and<00:03:00.000> I<00:03:00.600> have<00:03:01.580> enough<00:03:02.580> variance

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
advantage of and I have enough variance

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.410 
advantage of and I have enough variance
that<00:03:03.810> it's<00:03:04.620> what<00:03:04.890> takes<00:03:05.280> the<00:03:05.580> strain<00:03:06.060> out<00:03:06.390> of

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
that it's what takes the strain out of

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.500 
that it's what takes the strain out of
having<00:03:06.720> to<00:03:06.930> draw<00:03:07.170> here<00:03:07.650> because<00:03:08.550> I<00:03:08.820> don't<00:03:09.360> have

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
having to draw here because I don't have

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.300 
having to draw here because I don't have
to<00:03:09.600> be<00:03:09.720> so<00:03:09.900> careful<00:03:10.140> about<00:03:10.590> laying<00:03:10.800> each<00:03:11.040> one

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
to be so careful about laying each one

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.850 
to be so careful about laying each one
down<00:03:11.489> I<00:03:11.820> have<00:03:12.540> to<00:03:12.690> be<00:03:12.810> more<00:03:13.080> careful<00:03:13.350> about

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
down I have to be more careful about

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.800 
down I have to be more careful about
whether<00:03:14.430> I'm<00:03:14.700> capturing<00:03:15.300> the<00:03:15.420> highlight

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
whether I'm capturing the highlight

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.540 
whether I'm capturing the highlight
let's<00:03:16.080> count<00:03:16.290> them<00:03:16.380> the<00:03:16.500> other<00:03:16.650> way<00:03:16.830> it

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:17.550 
let's count them the other way it

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:22.910 
let's count them the other way it
established<00:03:18.150> that<00:03:18.209> a<00:03:18.330> little<00:03:18.660> bit<00:03:18.750> more<00:03:21.920> now

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
established that a little bit more now

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.650 
established that a little bit more now
again<00:03:23.280> I'm<00:03:23.489> just<00:03:23.670> showing<00:03:23.790> you<00:03:24.239> how<00:03:24.269> I'm

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
again I'm just showing you how I'm

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.690 
again I'm just showing you how I'm
approaching<00:03:25.320> doing<00:03:25.590> what<00:03:25.769> I'm<00:03:25.920> seeing<00:03:26.400> here

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
approaching doing what I'm seeing here

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.400 
approaching doing what I'm seeing here
instead<00:03:27.570> of<00:03:27.630> actually<00:03:29.360> maybe<00:03:30.360> getting<00:03:31.290> it

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
instead of actually maybe getting it

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:35.120 
instead of actually maybe getting it
exactly<00:03:31.950> accurate<00:03:32.550> oh<00:03:33.530> let's<00:03:34.530> let's<00:03:34.799> let's

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
exactly accurate oh let's let's let's

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.140 
exactly accurate oh let's let's let's
come<00:03:35.370> back<00:03:35.549> here<00:03:36.330> pass<00:03:36.810> this<00:03:37.230> and<00:03:37.530> do<00:03:37.680> this

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
come back here pass this and do this

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:48.710 
come back here pass this and do this
darker<00:03:39.150> part

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.800 

so<00:03:49.320> I<00:03:49.740> want<00:03:50.310> a<00:03:50.370> clean<00:03:50.580> edge<00:03:50.820> I<00:03:51.180> want<00:03:51.480> to<00:03:51.630> be<00:03:51.720> able

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
so I want a clean edge I want to be able

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.110 
so I want a clean edge I want to be able
to<00:03:51.930> drop<00:03:52.230> past<00:03:52.590> this<00:03:52.980> over<00:03:53.730> here<00:03:53.880> we're<00:03:54.030> gonna

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
to drop past this over here we're gonna

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.220 
to drop past this over here we're gonna
have<00:03:54.180> another<00:03:54.390> clean<00:03:54.660> edge<00:03:54.870> or<00:03:55.020> I'm<00:03:55.140> gonna

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
have another clean edge or I'm gonna

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:56.510 
have another clean edge or I'm gonna
look<00:03:55.380> for<00:03:55.590> all<00:03:55.710> those<00:03:55.920> because<00:03:56.130> they're<00:03:56.370> all

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:56.520 
look for all those because they're all

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.940 
look for all those because they're all
gonna<00:03:56.640> be<00:03:56.880> giving<00:03:57.660> me<00:03:57.750> a<00:03:57.780> great<00:03:58.170> advantage<00:03:58.590> and

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
gonna be giving me a great advantage and

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.810 
gonna be giving me a great advantage and
then<00:03:59.310> when<00:03:59.460> I<00:03:59.490> get<00:03:59.700> over<00:03:59.940> here<00:04:00.300> and<00:04:01.140> I<00:04:01.830> want<00:04:02.790> to

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:02.820 
then when I get over here and I want to

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:04.760 
then when I get over here and I want to
have<00:04:02.970> another<00:04:03.210> level<00:04:03.510> well<00:04:04.110> this<00:04:04.470> could

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:04.770 
have another level well this could

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:08.210 
have another level well this could
possibly<00:04:04.980> be<00:04:05.510> in<00:04:06.510> front<00:04:06.990> of<00:04:07.290> what's<00:04:07.860> behind

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
possibly be in front of what's behind

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.690 
possibly be in front of what's behind
deeper<00:04:09.950> although<00:04:10.950> I<00:04:10.980> can<00:04:11.250> keep<00:04:11.430> developing

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
deeper although I can keep developing

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.330 
deeper although I can keep developing
those<00:04:12.030> things<00:04:12.270> as<00:04:12.420> I<00:04:12.540> go<00:04:12.680> but<00:04:13.680> I<00:04:13.740> want<00:04:14.190> to

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
those things as I go but I want to

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.190 
those things as I go but I want to
capture<00:04:14.640> the<00:04:15.060> highlight<00:04:15.600> you're<00:04:16.019> already

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
capture the highlight you're already

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.920 
capture the highlight you're already
seeing<00:04:16.500> the<00:04:16.709> curve<00:04:16.980> if<00:04:17.850> I<00:04:18.060> find<00:04:18.450> that<00:04:18.600> I<00:04:18.660> want

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
seeing the curve if I find that I want

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.470 
seeing the curve if I find that I want
to<00:04:19.200> intensify<00:04:19.920> that<00:04:20.250> a<00:04:20.430> little<00:04:20.700> bit<00:04:20.850> if<00:04:21.060> you

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:21.480 
to intensify that a little bit if you

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:23.630 
to intensify that a little bit if you
use<00:04:21.690> your<00:04:21.840> eraser<00:04:22.380> right<00:04:22.590> don't<00:04:22.980> swipe<00:04:23.400> it

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:23.640 
use your eraser right don't swipe it

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.210 
use your eraser right don't swipe it
through<00:04:23.750> but<00:04:24.750> use<00:04:24.960> that<00:04:24.990> round<00:04:25.680> into<00:04:26.190> the

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
through but use that round into the

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.720 
through but use that round into the
eraser<00:04:26.790> because<00:04:27.330> again<00:04:27.960> the<00:04:28.470> rounder<00:04:29.340> I<00:04:29.370> keep

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:29.730 
eraser because again the rounder I keep

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:33.650 
eraser because again the rounder I keep
this<00:04:30.000> and<00:04:30.300> the<00:04:31.020> more<00:04:31.350> I've<00:04:32.280> practice<00:04:33.030> having

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
this and the more I've practice having

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:37.010 
this and the more I've practice having
the<00:04:33.780> right<00:04:34.100> bounce<00:04:35.100> the<00:04:35.460> right<00:04:35.640> pressure<00:04:36.020> the

the right bounce the right pressure the

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:38.690 
the right bounce the right pressure the
tapping<00:04:37.590> becomes<00:04:37.920> very<00:04:38.160> effective<00:04:38.580> because

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:38.700 
tapping becomes very effective because

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:42.170 
tapping becomes very effective because
it<00:04:39.000> vignettes<00:04:39.600> it<00:04:40.200> very<00:04:40.560> gates<00:04:40.860> on<00:04:41.280> in<00:04:41.940> there

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.180 
it vignettes it very gates on in there

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.600 
it vignettes it very gates on in there
and<00:04:42.420> even<00:04:42.600> if<00:04:42.840> I<00:04:42.930> did<00:04:43.200> get<00:04:43.380> it<00:04:43.560> a<00:04:43.710> little<00:04:44.460> bit

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
and even if I did get it a little bit

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.490 
and even if I did get it a little bit
different<00:04:44.970> than<00:04:45.120> what<00:04:45.270> I<00:04:45.300> hope<00:04:45.600> I<00:04:45.900> can<00:04:46.350> go

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
different than what I hope I can go

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.410 
different than what I hope I can go
ahead<00:04:46.740> and<00:04:46.860> I<00:04:46.920> can<00:04:46.950> come<00:04:47.640> back<00:04:47.790> in<00:04:48.090> and<00:04:48.270> maybe

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:48.420 
ahead and I can come back in and maybe

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:52.190 
ahead and I can come back in and maybe
take<00:04:48.720> a<00:04:49.490> highlight<00:04:50.490> out<00:04:50.730> of<00:04:50.880> that<00:04:51.090> so<00:04:51.990> now

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:52.200 
take a highlight out of that so now

00:04:52.200 --> 00:05:02.050 
take a highlight out of that so now
let's<00:04:52.470> go<00:04:52.650> ahead<00:04:52.919> and<00:04:53.070> come<00:04:54.380> yeah

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:02.060 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.560 

I'm<00:05:02.810> gonna<00:05:03.050> I'm<00:05:03.380> gonna<00:05:03.590> take<00:05:03.830> this<00:05:04.010> one<00:05:04.280> out

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:04.570 
I'm gonna I'm gonna take this one out

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:07.150 
I'm gonna I'm gonna take this one out
edge<00:05:05.570> I<00:05:06.020> want<00:05:06.169> to<00:05:06.320> go<00:05:06.470> ahead<00:05:06.560> and<00:05:06.680> create<00:05:06.889> that

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:07.160 
edge I want to go ahead and create that

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.550 
edge I want to go ahead and create that
just<00:05:07.370> a<00:05:07.430> little<00:05:07.490> bit<00:05:07.610> more<00:05:08.260> and<00:05:09.260> I<00:05:09.350> could

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:09.560 
just a little bit more and I could

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.470 
just a little bit more and I could
decide<00:05:09.860> to<00:05:09.980> do<00:05:10.100> that<00:05:10.280> earlier<00:05:10.730> or<00:05:11.000> later<00:05:11.030> or

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:11.480 
decide to do that earlier or later or

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:13.030 
decide to do that earlier or later or
whatever<00:05:11.630> yeah<00:05:12.260> maybe<00:05:12.440> I<00:05:12.560> wasn't<00:05:12.800> even

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:13.040 
whatever yeah maybe I wasn't even

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.730 
whatever yeah maybe I wasn't even
necessary<00:05:13.389> because<00:05:14.389> I'm<00:05:14.570> also<00:05:14.810> going<00:05:15.320> to<00:05:15.410> want

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:15.740 
necessary because I'm also going to want

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:20.230 
necessary because I'm also going to want
to<00:05:16.510> show<00:05:17.510> that<00:05:17.840> this<00:05:18.380> is<00:05:18.730> maybe<00:05:19.730> going<00:05:20.030> in

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:20.240 
to show that this is maybe going in

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:21.940 
to show that this is maybe going in
between<00:05:20.570> maybe<00:05:20.870> there's<00:05:21.169> a<00:05:21.230> place<00:05:21.470> I<00:05:21.620> see<00:05:21.770> this

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:21.950 
between maybe there's a place I see this

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:24.430 
between maybe there's a place I see this
dark<00:05:22.190> place<00:05:22.340> here<00:05:22.669> if<00:05:23.270> there<00:05:23.540> was<00:05:23.690> a<00:05:23.720> space<00:05:24.080> and

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:24.440 
dark place here if there was a space and

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:26.200 
dark place here if there was a space and
I<00:05:24.500> wanted<00:05:24.770> to<00:05:24.860> show<00:05:25.100> that<00:05:25.370> there<00:05:25.790> it<00:05:26.000> just

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:26.210 
I wanted to show that there it just

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:29.140 
I wanted to show that there it just
wasn't<00:05:26.600> that<00:05:26.889> intense<00:05:27.889> look<00:05:28.550> at<00:05:28.669> how<00:05:28.820> just

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:29.150 
wasn't that intense look at how just

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:31.240 
wasn't that intense look at how just
that<00:05:29.330> one<00:05:29.570> little<00:05:29.750> dot<00:05:30.080> gave<00:05:30.980> me<00:05:31.130> the

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:31.250 
that one little dot gave me the

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:33.159 
that one little dot gave me the
opportunity<00:05:31.970> to<00:05:32.000> show<00:05:32.450> that<00:05:32.660> this<00:05:32.810> isn't

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:33.169 
opportunity to show that this isn't

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:35.620 
opportunity to show that this isn't
solid<00:05:33.380> if<00:05:34.130> I<00:05:34.340> want<00:05:34.610> it<00:05:34.669> to<00:05:34.700> be<00:05:34.940> fuller<00:05:35.270> and<00:05:35.570> I

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:35.630 
solid if I want it to be fuller and I

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:37.810 
solid if I want it to be fuller and I
want<00:05:35.840> it<00:05:35.900> to<00:05:35.990> be<00:05:36.110> denser<00:05:36.830> then<00:05:37.280> I<00:05:37.490> wouldn't

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:37.820 
want it to be denser then I wouldn't

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:40.540 
want it to be denser then I wouldn't
necessarily<00:05:38.210> put<00:05:38.780> that<00:05:38.930> in<00:05:39.080> there<00:05:39.290> but<00:05:39.950> it

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:40.550 
necessarily put that in there but it

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:42.460 
necessarily put that in there but it
does<00:05:40.820> give<00:05:41.060> me<00:05:41.090> an<00:05:41.270> opportunity<00:05:41.900> with<00:05:42.110> bangs

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:42.470 
does give me an opportunity with bangs

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:45.580 
does give me an opportunity with bangs
and<00:05:42.889> eyebrows<00:05:43.340> showing<00:05:43.790> through<00:05:44.090> or<00:05:44.470> you<00:05:45.470> know

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:45.590 
and eyebrows showing through or you know

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:48.250 
and eyebrows showing through or you know
shoulders<00:05:46.250> showing<00:05:46.580> through<00:05:46.940> that<00:05:47.260> cascading

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:48.260 
shoulders showing through that cascading

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.940 
shoulders showing through that cascading
a<00:05:48.410> hair<00:05:48.680> on<00:05:48.919> a<00:05:48.950> shoulder<00:05:49.990> you<00:05:50.990> can<00:05:51.229> show<00:05:51.919> that

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:51.950 
a hair on a shoulder you can show that

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:53.800 
a hair on a shoulder you can show that
there's<00:05:52.550> something<00:05:52.910> through<00:05:53.330> there<00:05:53.479> just<00:05:53.510> a

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:53.810 
there's something through there just a

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:56.050 
there's something through there just a
little<00:05:53.840> bit<00:05:54.160> look<00:05:55.160> at<00:05:55.280> how<00:05:55.370> effective<00:05:55.580> but<00:05:55.910> one

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:56.060 
little bit look at how effective but one

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:57.790 
little bit look at how effective but one
dot<00:05:56.270> is<00:05:56.479> I<00:05:56.720> think<00:05:56.960> it<00:05:57.020> was<00:05:57.110> effective<00:05:57.410> me<00:05:57.650> it's

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:57.800 
dot is I think it was effective me it's

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.100 
dot is I think it was effective me it's
because<00:05:57.979> I<00:05:58.100> wanted<00:05:58.490> to<00:05:58.669> you<00:05:59.600> know<00:05:59.630> prove<00:05:59.990> a

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:00.110 
because I wanted to you know prove a

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:02.710 
because I wanted to you know prove a
point<00:06:00.320> and<00:06:00.590> I<00:06:00.710> see<00:06:01.310> it<00:06:01.430> but<00:06:02.210> you<00:06:02.300> want<00:06:02.479> to<00:06:02.570> make

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:02.720 
point and I see it but you want to make

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:04.629 
point and I see it but you want to make
sure<00:06:02.750> it's<00:06:03.020> believable<00:06:03.500> that<00:06:03.830> if<00:06:03.979> I<00:06:04.130> followed

00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:04.639 
sure it's believable that if I followed

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:07.150 
sure it's believable that if I followed
this<00:06:05.270> through<00:06:06.110> this<00:06:06.560> would<00:06:06.800> be<00:06:06.919> where<00:06:07.130> it

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:07.160 
this through this would be where it

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.070 
this through this would be where it
would<00:06:07.340> be<00:06:07.550> that's<00:06:08.180> one<00:06:08.510> thing<00:06:08.720> you<00:06:08.810> want<00:06:08.990> to

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:09.080 
would be that's one thing you want to

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:17.530 
would be that's one thing you want to
make<00:06:09.229> sure<00:06:09.260> you<00:06:09.590> do

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:17.540 

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:19.600
