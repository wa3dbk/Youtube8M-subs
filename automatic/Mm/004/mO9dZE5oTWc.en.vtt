00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:02.870 
oven let them cool for just a little bit

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.860 
oven let them cool for just a little bit
and<00:01:03.140> now<00:01:03.739> we<00:01:03.769> are<00:01:04.159> going<00:01:04.370> to<00:01:04.790> cut<00:01:05.299> starting

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:05.870 
and now we are going to cut starting

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:07.090 
and now we are going to cut starting
about<00:01:06.080> right<00:01:06.350> here

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
about right here

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.620 
about right here
you<00:01:07.640> don't<00:01:07.909> want<00:01:08.060> to<00:01:08.120> use<00:01:08.270> the<00:01:08.479> edges<00:01:08.900> for<00:01:09.140> this

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:10.630 
you don't want to use the edges for this

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:16.319 
you don't want to use the edges for this
so<00:01:11.630> about<00:01:12.260> half<00:01:12.710> an<00:01:12.890> inch<00:01:13.990> cut<00:01:14.990> in<00:01:15.170> the<00:01:15.320> middle

00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:16.329 
so about half an inch cut in the middle

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:18.609 
so about half an inch cut in the middle
because<00:01:17.329> the<00:01:17.450> edges<00:01:17.780> seem<00:01:17.990> to<00:01:18.110> be<00:01:18.259> a<00:01:18.289> little

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619 
because the edges seem to be a little

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:21.370 
because the edges seem to be a little
bit<00:01:18.829> harder<00:01:19.310> than<00:01:19.340> the<00:01:19.670> middle<00:01:19.969> of<00:01:20.180> course<00:01:20.450> and
