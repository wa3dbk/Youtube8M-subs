00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:06.060
 new york a huge metropolis one of the 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.040
 many in which the population migrates 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.160
 world in search of a life 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.160
 best 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:26.119
 described as a concrete jungle and 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.890
 oases like this that infuse a breath 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:31.280
 vital to one of the most densely populated cities 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:33.379
 populated on the planet with over 8 million 

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.330
 of inhabitants and more than 100 different languages 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:38.110
 when it comes to the greenery there is only that 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:41.180
 a word on the lips of all space 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:46.489
 There are never enough gardens 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:47.330
 Well it definitely wants lawns trees 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:48.920
 greens 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.470
 sometimes I climb the ladder 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:54.070
 emergency in search of a puff 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:54.070
 fresh air 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.299
 a growing population in 

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:11.360
 a city that cannot physically 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:12.710
 to widen to which stress should be added 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.720
 to live in one of the most popular places 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.100
 competitive in the world and the common 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.530
 aspiration to the best quality of 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.360
 life possible but don't worry 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:25.250
 the situation is definitely 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:26.659
 improving at the top above the 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.030
 hectic traffic on city streets 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:31.909
 there are endless hanging gardens like 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.170
 these the ingenious New Yorkers yes 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:37.009
 they create a little corner of paradise 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:38.599
 wherever they find michael's place with is 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:42.409
 that the rooftop gardens have become 

00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:44.780
 so popular well i think people 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:48.049
 feel the need to go back to nature 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:53.080
 and these roofs are the only spaces 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:55.640
 usable the only ones that can exploit 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.259
 if I look around I see a lot of 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.770
 green in a city full of glass e 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:01.310
 cement 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:04.189
 exactly while people love parks 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.679
 want a private space where you can 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:07.450
 take off your shoes and feel the grass 

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:10.789
 under the feet 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:13.730
 grow your own tomatoes, spices 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:16.730
 and stuff like that thing you do n't 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.260
 wait in the city for sure and what are the 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.260
 advantages of a roof garden like 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.769
 this is true for the owner 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.730
 buzz 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:27.760
 a place to receive friends 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:30.950
 enjoy a sort of private ozzy 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:33.530
 away from the noise of the city with a 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.940
 very relaxing effect on every aspect 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.680
 of one's life 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.230
 seeing what is creating all this 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.370
 I ask why people don't do it anymore 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.350
 try to imagine how it would be new 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.269
 york with its 80 square kilometers 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:48.370
 of space on the green roofs 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:48.370
 then inspire and relax 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.920
 I don't mean michael gardening 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:53.769
 but all this is fantastic 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.420
 I suppose requires a lot of work 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:57.890
 you must keep in mind that it takes effort 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.770
 and constancy 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:01.819
 you have to cut the grass every week 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:05.170
 take care of the greenery all year round 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:07.580
 in spring, summer and even in winter 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.700
 it takes a big commitment to have 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.700
 success 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:19.430
 commitment means time is a resource 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:21.709
 New Yorkers who have no short supply 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:24.400
 considering that the main purpose and 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:27.680
 enjoy the green don't take care of it 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.480
 so how do you cure all this green is 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.820
 slightly more complicated than keeping 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.590
 some vase 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:37.489
 no there are no sheep but something that 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:40.220
 imitates their block if evolution 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:42.140
 produced the perfect mower the car 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:47.150
 husqvarna number makes it more practical 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:49.580
 the operation to learn more I have 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.680
 route 6,000 kilometers to the center 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:53.480
 husqvarna robotics in sweden 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.980
 southern 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:57.350
 the mower was designed here 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:01.840
 husqvarna now in its third generation 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:01.840
 it has exceptional features 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:07.010
 they are robotic means designed for 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:09.140
 operate as a push lawn mower or 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:11.209
 engine are completely automatic 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:12.380
 put in place they do all the work 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:16.510
 in your place 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:16.510
 we can see them in safe action 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:34.500
 he is really shaving the lawn yes but never 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:37.090
 given such a thing 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:39.370
 what happens is going over the edge 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.690
 no problem friend how do you know 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:43.410
 where the boundaries are 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:45.790
 there is a cable interned along the edges 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:49.410
 the lawn mower is located and is maintained 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:49.410
 constantly within the perimeter 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:56.310
 I saw but it seems to move 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:58.900
 go a little haphazardly 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:03.850
 well the purpose is to get a cut 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:05.950
 uniform without stripes a riserba 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:07.090
 commercial leaves strips of 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:08.770
 parallel bands 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:10.900
 we prefer a more uniform appearance 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:13.870
 this is why it proceeds in a different direction 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:16.150
 there are obstacles here a big tree 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:18.850
 trunk the ease what prevents him from 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:20.170
 going to crash, causing damage on 

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:22.600
 these trees there is nothing that 

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:24.190
 stop after touching them turns and 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:26.170
 change of lesson 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:28.600
 let's use it very sharp we do 

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:31.060
 frequent cuts in daily practice 

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:34.510
 always keeping the coat short less 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:37.240
 current less energy consumption is 

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:38.980
 battery powered and works a 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:41.710
 battery and return to this station 

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:42.190
 charge about an hour to fill the 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:44.950
 battery 

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:46.420
 before returning to work the battery 

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:49.210
 it doesn't even have to be big 

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:52.090
 dimensions being able to recharge often 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:57.130
 one more thing I noticed that the grass is 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:59.800
 luxuriantly shiny different from that 

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:03.400
 clipped from a common lawnmower depends 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:06.130
 from the right height and I guess now it is 

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:08.560
 wet because I didn't think it was drizzling 

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:10.240
 tosa auction the lawn in the rain this 

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:12.100
 pink grass able to work with 

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:13.450
 any time the rain is not a 

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:15.040
 problem 

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:17.740
 I see the car moving up a slope 

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:19.660
 down there that slope can overcome let's say 

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:21.280
 always where a lawn mower works 

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:22.810
 the traditional can also be used 

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:26.340
 tape that is a climb without 

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:29.500
 the nice thing in my opinion is to see 

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:31.450
 this is the machine that works while i 

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:33.280
 owners are at the beach office 

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:34.409
 or in the gym 

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:36.209
 I mean 

00:06:34.409 --> 00:06:37.439
 they are free to do what they want not 

00:06:36.209 --> 00:06:38.939
 that's it 

00:06:37.439 --> 00:06:42.149
 one can do whatever he wants 

00:06:38.939 --> 00:06:52.469
 except for the lawn already the dream of 

00:06:42.149 --> 00:06:54.089
 all of us returning to new york can't see 

00:06:52.469 --> 00:06:55.919
 wait to hear what maicon thinks about 

00:06:54.089 --> 00:06:58.409
 our garden expert about it 

00:06:55.919 --> 00:07:02.429
 hi michael how are you 

00:06:58.409 --> 00:07:04.830
 it's fantastic it's not only a wonder 

00:07:02.429 --> 00:07:07.649
 for hanging terraces but for anyone 

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:08.879
 have a green area want to save 

00:07:07.649 --> 00:07:11.369
 time 

00:07:08.879 --> 00:07:13.879
 in short, you can enjoy your space 

00:07:11.369 --> 00:07:17.879
 for the purpose for which you created it 

00:07:13.879 --> 00:07:21.809
 just so what do you think of the cut of 

00:07:17.879 --> 00:07:23.969
 result that you get excellent I want 

00:07:21.809 --> 00:07:26.429
 say at the beginning seems to follow one 

00:07:23.969 --> 00:07:28.589
 unusual scheme but if you don't do not do not 

00:07:26.429 --> 00:07:33.589
 you don't even see the growth of the grass 

00:07:28.589 --> 00:07:39.479
 always remains perfect useful no 

00:07:33.589 --> 00:07:40.949
 very useful therefore the story ends where 

00:07:39.479 --> 00:07:43.610
 it had begun here and in front 

00:07:40.949 --> 00:07:45.929
 to the incredible panorama of new york 

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:48.179
 where someone sees a jungle of 

00:07:45.929 --> 00:07:50.189
 cement I see a place 's potential 

00:07:48.179 --> 00:07:52.229
 where a greener existence can flourish 

00:07:50.189 --> 00:07:55.289
 thanks to the need for contact with the 

00:07:52.229 --> 00:07:57.539
 man's nature wherever the car lives 

00:07:55.289 --> 00:07:59.939
 mover husqvarna ease the way 

00:07:57.539 --> 00:08:02.749
 giving us the time we need to 

00:07:59.939 --> 00:08:02.749
 enjoy life
