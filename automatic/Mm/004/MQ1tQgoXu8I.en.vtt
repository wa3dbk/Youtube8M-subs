00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
the right we've got a more complicated

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.270 
the right we've got a more complicated
pattern<00:02:38.390> it's<00:02:38.570> a<00:02:38.660> Glen<00:02:39.050> check<00:02:39.380> and<00:02:39.620> this<00:02:40.130> is

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
pattern it's a Glen check and this is

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.040 
pattern it's a Glen check and this is
something<00:02:40.490> what<00:02:41.150> I<00:02:41.180> love<00:02:41.420> about<00:02:41.600> these<00:02:41.780> semi

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
something what I love about these semi

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.110 
something what I love about these semi
salts<00:02:42.470> is<00:02:42.590> from<00:02:42.980> a<00:02:43.100> distance<00:02:43.340> they're<00:02:43.880> going

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
salts is from a distance they're going

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.670 
salts is from a distance they're going
to<00:02:44.240> look<00:02:44.390> solid<00:02:44.810> and<00:02:44.930> so<00:02:45.050> they<00:02:45.200> have<00:02:45.380> the<00:02:45.500> same

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
to look solid and so they have the same

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.220 
to look solid and so they have the same
versatility<00:02:46.550> of<00:02:46.580> the<00:02:46.970> solids<00:02:47.390> but<00:02:47.960> when<00:02:48.140> you

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
versatility of the solids but when you

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:49.840 
versatility of the solids but when you
get<00:02:48.410> up<00:02:48.530> close<00:02:48.770> you<00:02:48.800> can<00:02:49.010> see<00:02:49.160> the<00:02:49.340> pattern

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
get up close you can see the pattern

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:51.940 
get up close you can see the pattern
this<00:02:50.090> white<00:02:50.750> here<00:02:51.110> in<00:02:51.200> the<00:02:51.290> bottom<00:02:51.620> right<00:02:51.770> hand

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
this white here in the bottom right hand

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.100 
this white here in the bottom right hand
corner<00:02:52.100> most<00:02:52.970> of<00:02:53.120> you<00:02:53.240> won't<00:02:53.450> be<00:02:53.600> able<00:02:53.690> to<00:02:53.840> see

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
corner most of you won't be able to see

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.650 
corner most of you won't be able to see
that<00:02:54.350> it<00:02:54.440> does<00:02:54.710> have<00:02:54.740> a<00:02:55.280> check<00:02:56.000> pattern<00:02:56.300> and

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
that it does have a check pattern and

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.110 
that it does have a check pattern and
unless<00:02:57.320> you're<00:02:57.530> viewing<00:02:57.830> this<00:02:58.010> and<00:02:58.220> ehq<00:02:58.880> you

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
unless you're viewing this and ehq you

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.100 
unless you're viewing this and ehq you
probably<00:02:59.480> don't<00:02:59.720> actually<00:02:59.930> see<00:03:00.320> that<00:03:02.110> so

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
probably don't actually see that so

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:05.980 
probably don't actually see that so
going<00:03:03.680> from<00:03:03.890> semi<00:03:04.340> solids<00:03:04.730> to<00:03:05.120> now<00:03:05.330> stripe

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:05.990 
going from semi solids to now stripe

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:08.290 
going from semi solids to now stripe
pattern<00:03:06.380> so<00:03:06.530> this<00:03:06.680> is<00:03:06.860> very<00:03:07.580> clear<00:03:07.940> that<00:03:07.970> there

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:08.300 
pattern so this is very clear that there

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.530 
pattern so this is very clear that there
is<00:03:08.480> a<00:03:08.990> pattern<00:03:09.770> to<00:03:10.160> this<00:03:10.340> now<00:03:10.820> the<00:03:11.270> vertical

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
is a pattern to this now the vertical

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.180 
is a pattern to this now the vertical
stripe<00:03:12.020> as<00:03:12.260> it<00:03:12.410> and<00:03:12.560> you<00:03:12.680> don't<00:03:12.830> see<00:03:13.040> them

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
stripe as it and you don't see them

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:14.650 
stripe as it and you don't see them
going<00:03:13.370> across<00:03:13.700> because<00:03:13.880> the<00:03:14.060> reason<00:03:14.390> you<00:03:14.510> see

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
going across because the reason you see

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.510 
going across because the reason you see
a<00:03:14.690> vertical<00:03:14.930> striped<00:03:15.410> often<00:03:15.920> on<00:03:16.040> a<00:03:16.070> shirt<00:03:16.370> is

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:16.520 
a vertical striped often on a shirt is

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:20.470 
a vertical striped often on a shirt is
it<00:03:17.090> gives<00:03:17.420> the<00:03:17.750> illusion<00:03:18.080> of<00:03:18.970> slimming<00:03:19.970> the

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
it gives the illusion of slimming the

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.380 
it gives the illusion of slimming the
figure<00:03:20.810> so<00:03:20.990> this<00:03:21.020> shirt<00:03:21.770> if<00:03:22.010> it's<00:03:22.370> cut<00:03:23.120> right

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
figure so this shirt if it's cut right

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.260 
figure so this shirt if it's cut right
and<00:03:23.660> it<00:03:23.780> fits<00:03:24.050> a<00:03:24.200> man<00:03:24.380> well<00:03:24.590> will<00:03:25.160> usually<00:03:25.850> make

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:26.270 
and it fits a man well will usually make

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:28.540 
and it fits a man well will usually make
a<00:03:26.330> man<00:03:26.630> look<00:03:26.840> a<00:03:26.990> bit<00:03:27.170> thinner<00:03:27.440> in<00:03:27.680> addition<00:03:28.340> it

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:28.550 
a man look a bit thinner in addition it

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:31.690 
a man look a bit thinner in addition it
helps<00:03:29.390> the<00:03:29.540> color<00:03:29.780> bleed<00:03:30.470> into<00:03:31.100> the<00:03:31.220> trousers

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
helps the color bleed into the trousers

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:32.950 
helps the color bleed into the trousers
and<00:03:31.910> why<00:03:32.030> that's<00:03:32.180> important<00:03:32.720> because<00:03:32.810> it

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:32.960 
and why that's important because it

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:35.710 
and why that's important because it
gives<00:03:33.050> you<00:03:33.230> a<00:03:33.260> monochromatic<00:03:34.010> look<00:03:34.640> so<00:03:35.210> these

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720 
gives you a monochromatic look so these

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
got a complicated pattern actually in

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.879 
got a complicated pattern actually in
the<00:04:32.639> white<00:04:32.910> in<00:04:33.240> which<00:04:33.630> we<00:04:33.780> see<00:04:33.960> a<00:04:33.990> very<00:04:34.199> looks

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:34.889 
the white in which we see a very looks

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:37.460 
the white in which we see a very looks

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
like a honeycomb weave so because of the

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:40.219 
like a honeycomb weave so because of the
complexity<00:04:38.160> of<00:04:38.190> this<00:04:38.370> fabric<00:04:38.669> I<00:04:39.050> would<00:04:40.050> be

complexity<00:05:42.210> of<00:05:42.240> the<00:05:42.900> pattern<00:05:43.320> I'm<00:05:43.800> going<00:05:44.070> to

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:44.130 
complexity of the pattern I'm going to

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:47.060 
complexity of the pattern I'm going to
say<00:05:44.280> that<00:05:44.460> this<00:05:44.639> one<00:05:44.909> is<00:05:45.500> you<00:05:46.500> wouldn't<00:05:46.770> really

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:47.070 
say that this one is you wouldn't really

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:49.040 
say that this one is you wouldn't really
want<00:05:47.190> to<00:05:47.490> wear<00:05:47.669> this<00:05:47.849> with<00:05:47.909> a<00:05:48.120> suit<00:05:48.479> you<00:05:48.509> could

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:49.050 
want to wear this with a suit you could

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:50.779 
want to wear this with a suit you could
if<00:05:49.349> you're<00:05:49.560> not<00:05:49.710> wearing<00:05:49.919> a<00:05:50.070> tie<00:05:50.280> with<00:05:50.490> it<00:05:50.610> and

00:05:50.779 --> 00:05:50.789 
if you're not wearing a tie with it and

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:53.089 
if you're not wearing a tie with it and
if<00:05:50.880> you're<00:05:51.030> in<00:05:51.180> a<00:05:51.240> very<00:05:51.449> informal<00:05:52.099> environment

00:05:53.089 --> 00:05:53.099 
if you're in a very informal environment

00:05:53.099 --> 00:05:56.420 
if you're in a very informal environment
or<00:05:54.349> but<00:05:55.349> I<00:05:55.380> think<00:05:55.710> overall<00:05:56.039> this<00:05:56.250> would

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:56.430 
or but I think overall this would

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:58.399 
or but I think overall this would
actually<00:05:56.699> look<00:05:56.819> great<00:05:57.030> again<00:05:57.479> within<00:05:57.719> just<00:05:58.259> a

00:05:58.399 --> 00:05:58.409 
actually look great again within just a

00:05:58.409 --> 00:06:00.409 
actually look great again within just a
pair<00:05:58.590> of<00:05:58.620> trousers<00:05:58.919> and<00:05:59.219> the<00:05:59.669> reason<00:05:59.969> being<00:06:00.180> is

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:00.419 
pair of trousers and the reason being is

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:02.540 
pair of trousers and the reason being is
because<00:06:01.319> of<00:06:01.440> that<00:06:01.530> red<00:06:01.830> it's<00:06:02.009> going<00:06:02.159> to<00:06:02.219> be<00:06:02.370> a

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:02.550 
because of that red it's going to be a

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:04.339 
because of that red it's going to be a
fabric<00:06:03.060> that<00:06:03.210> you<00:06:03.300> don't<00:06:03.630> see<00:06:03.870> very<00:06:04.050> often

00:06:04.339 --> 00:06:04.349 
fabric that you don't see very often

00:06:04.349 --> 00:06:08.240 
fabric that you don't see very often
it's<00:06:04.919> going<00:06:04.949> to<00:06:05.099> help<00:06:05.250> you<00:06:05.370> stand<00:06:05.580> out<00:06:07.250> quickly

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:08.250 
it's going to help you stand out quickly

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:10.670 
it's going to help you stand out quickly
let's<00:06:08.639> talk<00:06:08.849> about<00:06:09.000> weaves<00:06:09.389> and<00:06:09.599> so<00:06:10.380> imagine

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:10.680 
let's talk about weaves and so imagine

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:13.040 
let's talk about weaves and so imagine
these<00:06:11.009> are<00:06:11.069> individual<00:06:11.880> yarns<00:06:12.360> in<00:06:12.539> a<00:06:12.630> fabric

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:13.050 
these are individual yarns in a fabric

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:15.320 
these are individual yarns in a fabric
if<00:06:13.199> you<00:06:14.069> go<00:06:14.340> north<00:06:14.610> and<00:06:14.849> south

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:15.330 
if you go north and south

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:17.749 
if you go north and south
that's<00:06:15.599> the<00:06:16.020> warp<00:06:16.259> up<00:06:16.530> and<00:06:16.770> down<00:06:16.889> across<00:06:17.610> from

00:06:17.749 --> 00:06:17.759 
that's the warp up and down across from

00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:21.290 
that's the warp up and down across from
left<00:06:18.240> to<00:06:18.389> right<00:06:19.039> we<00:06:20.039> see<00:06:20.219> the<00:06:20.250> left<00:06:20.490> and<00:06:20.819> the

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:21.300 
left to right we see the left and the

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:23.170 
left to right we see the left and the
what<00:06:21.539> how<00:06:22.020> these<00:06:22.289> are<00:06:22.469> woven<00:06:22.710> together

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:23.180 
what how these are woven together

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:25.430 
what how these are woven together
depends<00:06:24.180> on<00:06:24.300> not<00:06:24.449> only<00:06:24.509> the<00:06:24.840> strength<00:06:25.110> of<00:06:25.349> the

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:25.440 
depends on not only the strength of the

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:27.350 
depends on not only the strength of the
fabric<00:06:25.830> but<00:06:26.280> usually<00:06:26.789> some<00:06:26.969> of<00:06:27.000> the<00:06:27.150> patterns

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:27.360 
fabric but usually some of the patterns

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:30.770 
fabric but usually some of the patterns
we'll<00:06:27.719> see<00:06:27.900> in<00:06:27.960> it<00:06:28.080> as<00:06:28.199> well<00:06:28.469> so<00:06:29.539> these<00:06:30.539> are<00:06:30.719> the

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:30.780 
we'll see in it as well so these are the

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:33.320 
we'll see in it as well so these are the
four<00:06:31.199> most<00:06:31.530> common<00:06:31.680> shirt<00:06:32.430> fabrics<00:06:32.909> actually

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:34.380 
I take that back

one two the twill is a bit more

complicated and what's interesting about

complicated and what's interesting about
the<00:06:56.410> twill<00:06:56.710> is<00:06:56.920> you<00:06:57.280> actually<00:06:57.820> get<00:06:57.970> a<00:06:58.000> denser

00:06:58.560 --> 00:06:58.570 
the twill is you actually get a denser
