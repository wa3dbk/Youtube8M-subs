hey<00:00:03.750> guys<00:00:03.899> got<00:00:04.109> a<00:00:04.170> secret<00:00:05.160> block<00:00:05.490> sort<00:00:05.970> of<00:00:06.060> not

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
hey guys got a secret block sort of not

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.480 
hey guys got a secret block sort of not
really<00:00:06.750> secret<00:00:07.230> but<00:00:07.350> fun<00:00:07.589> things<00:00:07.919> to<00:00:08.100> do<00:00:08.250> as

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
really secret but fun things to do as

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.520 
really secret but fun things to do as
well<00:00:08.700> but<00:00:09.030> you<00:00:09.600> can<00:00:09.690> probably<00:00:09.840> tell<00:00:10.080> this<00:00:10.350> is

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
well but you can probably tell this is

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.189 
well but you can probably tell this is
an<00:00:10.740> endocrine<00:00:11.250> cell<00:00:11.490> in<00:00:11.789> the<00:00:12.270> overworld<00:00:12.840> which

00:00:13.189 --> 00:00:13.199 
an endocrine cell in the overworld which

00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:15.830 
an endocrine cell in the overworld which
is<00:00:13.590> not<00:00:14.100> really<00:00:14.459> possible<00:00:14.820> I<00:00:15.270> think<00:00:15.600> there's<00:00:15.779> a

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:15.840 
is not really possible I think there's a

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.260 
is not really possible I think there's a
way<00:00:16.139> to<00:00:16.199> do<00:00:16.619> it<00:00:16.770> in<00:00:16.890> survival<00:00:17.640> but<00:00:17.820> you<00:00:17.910> have<00:00:18.090> to

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
way to do it in survival but you have to

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.670 
way to do it in survival but you have to
do<00:00:18.660> so<00:00:19.290> much<00:00:19.650> work<00:00:19.980> just<00:00:20.340> to<00:00:20.940> get<00:00:21.120> it<00:00:21.410> into<00:00:22.410> the

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
do so much work just to get it into the

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.880 
do so much work just to get it into the
overworld<00:00:23.100> so<00:00:23.460> I'm<00:00:24.050> not<00:00:25.050> sure<00:00:25.110> how<00:00:25.500> you<00:00:25.560> do<00:00:25.770> it

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
overworld so I'm not sure how you do it

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.190 
overworld so I'm not sure how you do it
but<00:00:26.190> it's<00:00:26.520> very<00:00:26.850> complicated<00:00:27.240> but<00:00:27.660> we<00:00:28.050> can

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:28.200 
but it's very complicated but we can

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.910 
but it's very complicated but we can
just<00:00:28.350> do<00:00:28.470> this<00:00:28.650> simple<00:00:28.950> command<00:00:29.280> which<00:00:29.520> is

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:30.920 
just do this simple command which is

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.540 
just do this simple command which is
/summon<00:00:31.920> capital<00:00:32.699> e<00:00:32.820> fender<00:00:33.360> and<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.550> capital

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
/summon capital e fender and the capital

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.020 
/summon capital e fender and the capital
C<00:00:35.700> for<00:00:35.850> crystal<00:00:36.210> and<00:00:36.420> we<00:00:37.079> enter<00:00:37.410> that<00:00:37.590> and<00:00:38.030> we

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
C for crystal and we enter that and we

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.479 
C for crystal and we enter that and we
get<00:00:39.270> an<00:00:39.450> endocrine<00:00:40.260> wherever<00:00:40.590> we<00:00:40.800> are<00:00:40.829> stand

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
get an endocrine wherever we are stand

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.290 
get an endocrine wherever we are stand
and<00:00:41.850> place<00:00:42.270> it<00:00:42.480> so<00:00:42.810> you<00:00:43.710> can<00:00:43.860> do<00:00:44.040> that<00:00:44.220> but<00:00:44.790> you

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
and place it so you can do that but you

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.639 
and place it so you can do that but you
probably<00:00:45.480> wonder<00:00:45.930> in<00:00:46.079> a<00:00:46.140> while<00:00:46.260> how<00:00:46.380> did<00:00:46.530> I<00:00:46.590> do

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
probably wonder in a while how did I do

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.950 
probably wonder in a while how did I do
this<00:00:46.860> well<00:00:47.280> I<00:00:47.489> just<00:00:47.550> put<00:00:48.180> it<00:00:48.300> into<00:00:48.540> a<00:00:48.570> command

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
this well I just put it into a command

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:49.310 
this well I just put it into a command
block

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
block

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.280 
block
I<00:00:49.500> put<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:50.460> summon<00:00:51.450> ender<00:00:51.690> crystal<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.200> then

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:52.290 
I put the summon ender crystal and then

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.740 
I put the summon ender crystal and then
the<00:00:52.380> coordinates<00:00:52.890> and<00:00:53.219> I<00:00:54.180> hooked<00:00:54.450> it<00:00:54.570> up<00:00:54.690> to

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
the coordinates and I hooked it up to

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.450 
the coordinates and I hooked it up to
this<00:00:55.350> and<00:00:55.710> if<00:00:55.800> you<00:00:55.860> don't<00:00:55.950> know<00:00:56.070> how<00:00:56.160> to<00:00:56.219> build

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
this and if you don't know how to build

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.799 
this and if you don't know how to build
this<00:00:56.760> then<00:00:57.120> I'll<00:00:57.360> show<00:00:57.510> you<00:00:57.570> right<00:00:57.750> now

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
this then I'll show you right now

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.450 
this then I'll show you right now
because<00:00:58.530> I<00:00:58.590> get<00:00:58.710> a<00:00:58.739> lot<00:00:58.920> of<00:00:58.950> questions<00:00:59.100> every

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
because I get a lot of questions every

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.610 
because I get a lot of questions every
time<00:00:59.730> how<00:00:59.940> to<00:00:59.969> build<00:01:00.210> this<00:01:00.360> you<00:01:00.960> just<00:01:01.079> put<00:01:01.260> two

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
time how to build this you just put two

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.280 
time how to build this you just put two
redstone<00:01:02.329> about<00:01:03.329> three<00:01:03.570> redstone<00:01:03.750> you<00:01:04.110> put

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
redstone about three redstone you put

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.319 
redstone about three redstone you put
one<00:01:04.530> repeater<00:01:04.829> facing<00:01:05.069> that<00:01:05.489> way<00:01:05.639> go<00:01:06.179> on<00:01:06.209> the

00:01:06.319 --> 00:01:06.329 
one repeater facing that way go on the

00:01:06.329 --> 00:01:07.669 
one repeater facing that way go on the
other<00:01:06.450> side<00:01:06.600> put<00:01:06.869> a<00:01:06.929> repeater<00:01:07.229> facing<00:01:07.409> that

00:01:07.669 --> 00:01:07.679 
other side put a repeater facing that

00:01:07.679 --> 00:01:10.160 
other side put a repeater facing that
way<00:01:07.829> put<00:01:08.579> a<00:01:08.639> torch<00:01:08.969> down<00:01:09.240> and<00:01:09.479> you<00:01:09.840> break<00:01:10.020> the

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
way put a torch down and you break the

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.469 
way put a torch down and you break the
torch<00:01:10.409> and<00:01:10.709> replace<00:01:11.009> it<00:01:11.189> with<00:01:11.219> redstone<00:01:11.609> just

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
torch and replace it with redstone just

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.590 
torch and replace it with redstone just
like<00:01:12.630> that<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:12.959> you'll<00:01:13.439> get<00:01:13.560> a<00:01:13.619> infinite

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
like that and you'll get a infinite

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.879 
like that and you'll get a infinite
clock<00:01:15.600> circuit<00:01:16.020> I<00:01:16.289> don't<00:01:16.439> know<00:01:16.499> if<00:01:16.590> it's

00:01:16.879 --> 00:01:16.889 
clock circuit I don't know if it's

00:01:16.889 --> 00:01:18.980 
clock circuit I don't know if it's
called<00:01:17.039> a<00:01:17.100> clock<00:01:17.249> but<00:01:17.520> a<00:01:17.549> circuit<00:01:17.939> and<00:01:18.060> then<00:01:18.810> I

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
called a clock but a circuit and then I

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.749 
called a clock but a circuit and then I
just<00:01:19.170> put<00:01:19.319> it<00:01:19.409> up<00:01:19.499> to<00:01:19.649> that<00:01:19.799> and<00:01:19.979> every<00:01:20.729> time

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
just put it up to that and every time

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.760 
just put it up to that and every time
the<00:01:21.240> pulse<00:01:21.450> hits<00:01:21.779> the<00:01:21.959> command<00:01:22.259> block<00:01:22.499> it

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
the pulse hits the command block it

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.859 
the pulse hits the command block it
spawns<00:01:23.279> another<00:01:23.490> ender<00:01:24.090> crystal<00:01:24.479> in<00:01:24.600> this

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
spawns another ender crystal in this

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.940 
spawns another ender crystal in this
joint<00:01:25.499> mess<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:27.229> it's<00:01:28.229> a<00:01:28.289> fun<00:01:28.469> thing<00:01:28.649> to<00:01:28.709> do

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
joint mess and it's a fun thing to do

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.949 
joint mess and it's a fun thing to do
because<00:01:29.159> you<00:01:29.639> can<00:01:29.670> use<00:01:29.909> this<00:01:30.029> for<00:01:30.209> like<00:01:30.240> maps

00:01:30.949 --> 00:01:30.959 
because you can use this for like maps

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:33.739 
because you can use this for like maps
and<00:01:31.409> stuff<00:01:31.499> like<00:01:31.920> maybe<00:01:32.189> custom<00:01:32.579> maps<00:01:32.759> you<00:01:33.359> use

00:01:33.739 --> 00:01:33.749 
and stuff like maybe custom maps you use

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:35.179 
and stuff like maybe custom maps you use
it<00:01:33.899> in<00:01:33.990> your<00:01:34.020> world<00:01:34.349> and<00:01:34.679> just<00:01:34.829> show<00:01:35.039> your

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
it in your world and just show your

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.609 
it in your world and just show your
friends<00:01:35.609> like<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.509> new<00:01:36.689> block<00:01:37.049> in<00:01:37.319> Minecraft

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
friends like the new block in Minecraft

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.469 
friends like the new block in Minecraft
and<00:01:38.069> like<00:01:38.159> trick<00:01:38.429> them<00:01:38.609> and<00:01:38.759> stuff<00:01:38.939> I'm

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
and like trick them and stuff I'm

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.599 
and like trick them and stuff I'm
getting<00:01:39.689> really<00:01:40.020> no<00:01:40.170> FPS<00:01:40.649> because<00:01:41.039> it's<00:01:41.279> a<00:01:41.369> lot

00:01:41.599 --> 00:01:41.609 
getting really no FPS because it's a lot

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:44.599 
getting really no FPS because it's a lot
of<00:01:41.639> entities<00:01:42.209> right<00:01:42.719> in<00:01:42.810> front<00:01:42.929> of<00:01:42.990> me<00:01:43.079> but<00:01:43.649> if

00:01:44.599 --> 00:01:44.609 
of entities right in front of me but if

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:46.569 
of entities right in front of me but if
you<00:01:44.700> don't<00:01:44.880> want<00:01:45.029> to<00:01:45.090> have<00:01:45.209> like<00:01:45.539> a<00:01:45.569> trippy

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:46.579 
you don't want to have like a trippy

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:49.129 
you don't want to have like a trippy

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:51.169 
but if you walk inside of this thing

00:01:51.169 --> 00:01:55.339 
but if you walk inside of this thing
damn<00:01:52.340> slick<00:01:53.340> guess<00:01:54.329> so<00:01:54.539> confusing<00:01:55.049> major

00:01:55.339 --> 00:01:55.349 
damn slick guess so confusing major

00:01:55.349 --> 00:01:57.260 
damn slick guess so confusing major
making<00:01:55.799> a<00:01:55.859> like<00:01:56.159> a<00:01:56.189> giant<00:01:56.700> maze<00:01:56.909> where<00:01:57.209> you

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
making a like a giant maze where you

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.399 
making a like a giant maze where you
just<00:01:57.359> have<00:01:57.479> to<00:01:57.569> like<00:01:57.689> walk<00:01:57.929> through<00:01:58.259> these

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
just have to like walk through these

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.349 
just have to like walk through these
constantly<00:01:59.099> that<00:01:59.279> would<00:01:59.369> be<00:01:59.429> so<00:01:59.729> confusing

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:00.359 
constantly that would be so confusing

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:03.979 
constantly that would be so confusing
confusing<00:02:01.109> a<00:02:01.319> disorientating<00:02:02.130> but<00:02:02.819> the<00:02:03.749> fun

thing<00:02:04.139> you<00:02:04.169> can<00:02:04.380> do<00:02:04.469> with<00:02:04.590> these<00:02:04.679> is<00:02:04.739> they

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:05.669 
thing you can do with these is they

00:02:05.669 --> 00:02:08.300 
thing you can do with these is they
still<00:02:06.090> explode<00:02:06.749> in<00:02:07.049> the<00:02:07.200> overworld<00:02:07.649> so<00:02:08.069> I've

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
still explode in the overworld so I've

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.080 
still explode in the overworld so I've
got<00:02:09.030> my<00:02:09.149> massive<00:02:09.860> amount<00:02:10.860> of<00:02:11.009> crystals<00:02:11.880> here

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
got my massive amount of crystals here

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.580 
got my massive amount of crystals here
oh<00:02:12.240> my<00:02:12.390> god<00:02:12.570> I've<00:02:12.690> really<00:02:12.960> hope<00:02:13.080> this<00:02:13.200> doesn't

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
oh my god I've really hope this doesn't

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.479 
oh my god I've really hope this doesn't

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
my pc I haven't tested this but if I

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:19.640 
my pc I haven't tested this but if I
punch<00:02:17.819> this<00:02:18.060> now<00:02:18.269> it's<00:02:18.569> gonna<00:02:18.780> act<00:02:19.050> like<00:02:19.170> TNT

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650

falling now um okay let's try get back
to<00:03:10.980> spawn<00:03:11.370> I<00:03:12.140> see<00:03:13.140> where<00:03:13.640> that<00:03:14.640> was<00:03:14.819> crazy<00:03:15.150> like

00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:15.599 
to spawn I see where that was crazy like

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:17.930 
to spawn I see where that was crazy like
what<00:03:15.959> were<00:03:16.049> the<00:03:16.140> coordinates<00:03:16.680> how<00:03:17.430> far<00:03:17.730> did<00:03:17.850> it

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
what were the coordinates how far did it

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.550 
what were the coordinates how far did it
go<00:03:18.090> someone's<00:03:18.420> got<00:03:18.569> like<00:03:18.930> I<00:03:19.049> didn't<00:03:19.260> even<00:03:19.319> look

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
go someone's got like I didn't even look

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.039 
go someone's got like I didn't even look
at<00:03:19.680> the<00:03:19.769> coordinates<00:03:20.329> and<00:03:21.329> how<00:03:21.540> far<00:03:21.840> I<00:03:21.870> went

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
at the coordinates and how far I went

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:23.870 
at the coordinates and how far I went
but<00:03:22.410> yeah<00:03:22.560> that's<00:03:23.100> how<00:03:23.280> you<00:03:23.310> could<00:03:23.579> do<00:03:23.730> with

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
but yeah that's how you could do with

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.490 
but yeah that's how you could do with
ender<00:03:24.180> crystals<00:03:24.569> in<00:03:24.720> the<00:03:24.780> overworld<00:03:25.170> it<00:03:25.380> made

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
ender crystals in the overworld it made

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.240 
ender crystals in the overworld it made
this<00:03:25.940> made<00:03:26.940> a<00:03:27.000> crater<00:03:27.329> not<00:03:27.690> very<00:03:27.840> big<00:03:28.019> one<00:03:28.250> but

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
this made a crater not very big one but

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.210 
this made a crater not very big one but
yeah<00:03:29.810> that's<00:03:30.810> the<00:03:31.170> sender<00:03:31.560> crystals<00:03:31.920> for<00:03:32.130> you

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
yeah that's the sender crystals for you

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.759 
yeah that's the sender crystals for you
a<00:03:32.250> secret<00:03:32.549> block<00:03:32.819> well<00:03:33.239> so<00:03:33.840> that<00:03:34.440> you<00:03:34.530> can<00:03:34.620> get

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
a secret block well so that you can get

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:37.400 
a secret block well so that you can get
in<00:03:34.859> the<00:03:34.920> overworld<00:03:35.250> and<00:03:35.690> have<00:03:36.690> some<00:03:36.930> fun<00:03:37.170> with

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
in the overworld and have some fun with

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.759 
in the overworld and have some fun with
so<00:03:37.950> have<00:03:38.880> fun<00:03:39.150> with<00:03:39.269> your<00:03:39.389> friends<00:03:39.810> be<00:03:40.319> a<00:03:40.349> face
