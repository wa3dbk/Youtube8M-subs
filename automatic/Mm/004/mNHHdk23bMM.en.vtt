yourself about whether or not that

limitation is real or is it perhaps a

limitation is real or is it perhaps a

it<00:02:43.300> something<00:02:43.690> that<00:02:43.840> perhaps<00:02:44.200> your<00:02:44.590> soul<00:02:44.860> is

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100 
it something that perhaps your soul is

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:46.740 
it something that perhaps your soul is
calling<00:02:45.519> you<00:02:45.700> towards<00:02:46.060> and<00:02:46.239> maybe<00:02:46.450> there's

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
calling you towards and maybe there's

that<00:02:46.930> hesitation<00:02:47.190> that<00:02:48.190> fear<00:02:48.519> of<00:02:48.700> your<00:02:48.880> own

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
that hesitation that fear of your own

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.420 
that hesitation that fear of your own
greatness<00:02:49.390> that<00:02:50.170> fear<00:02:50.530> or<00:02:50.739> of<00:02:50.890> stepping<00:02:51.280> into

greatness that fear or of stepping into

greatness that fear or of stepping into
the<00:02:51.550> power<00:02:51.850> of<00:02:52.090> who<00:02:52.239> you<00:02:52.390> really<00:02:52.570> are<00:02:52.900> and<00:02:53.250> so

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
the power of who you really are and so

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:55.890 
the power of who you really are and so
it's<00:02:54.430> easier<00:02:54.760> to<00:02:55.000> have<00:02:55.150> a<00:02:55.180> limitation<00:02:55.870> that

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
it's easier to have a limitation that

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.920 
it's easier to have a limitation that
even<00:02:56.319> you<00:02:56.440> might<00:02:56.620> blame<00:02:56.950> if<00:02:57.220> you<00:02:57.760> will<00:02:58.000> on<00:02:58.239> some

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
even you might blame if you will on some

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.949 
even you might blame if you will on some
external<00:02:59.290> source<00:02:59.940> we<00:03:00.940> ask<00:03:01.180> you<00:03:01.450> to<00:03:01.480> look<00:03:01.810> at

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
external source we ask you to look at

external source we ask you to look at
all<00:03:02.110> these<00:03:02.290> limitations<00:03:02.830> and<00:03:03.250> say<00:03:03.489> am<00:03:03.700> I

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:03.819 
all these limitations and say am I

all these limitations and say am I
imposing<00:03:04.360> this<00:03:04.510> limitation<00:03:05.019> and<00:03:05.459> then<00:03:06.459> dig<00:03:06.670> in

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:06.819 
imposing this limitation and then dig in

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:08.850 
imposing this limitation and then dig in
a<00:03:06.910> little<00:03:06.940> bit<00:03:07.330> more<00:03:07.569> and<00:03:07.810> if<00:03:08.350> you<00:03:08.500> see<00:03:08.739> that

a little bit more and if you see that

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.120 
a little bit more and if you see that

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
you are why are you why would it benefit

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.880 
you are why are you why would it benefit
you<00:03:12.190> to<00:03:12.459> hold<00:03:12.670> yourself<00:03:12.940> back<00:03:13.330> or<00:03:13.890> through

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
you to hold yourself back or through

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:16.590 
you to hold yourself back or through
your<00:03:15.070> awareness<00:03:15.370> that<00:03:15.760> perhaps<00:03:15.970> it<00:03:16.329> is<00:03:16.450> your

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600 
your awareness that perhaps it is your

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.539 
your awareness that perhaps it is your

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
perhaps that awareness loosens it

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:22.590 
perhaps that awareness loosens it
perhaps<00:03:21.310> your<00:03:21.700> awareness<00:03:22.030> gives<00:03:22.420> you

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
perhaps your awareness gives you

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.330 
perhaps your awareness gives you
different<00:03:22.780> ways<00:03:23.200> and<00:03:23.440> points<00:03:23.829> of<00:03:23.920> view<00:03:23.980> to

different ways and points of view to

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.120 
different ways and points of view to
look<00:03:24.549> at<00:03:24.700> that<00:03:24.880> limitation<00:03:25.860> perhaps<00:03:26.860> in<00:03:27.040> the

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
look at that limitation perhaps in the

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:29.310 
look at that limitation perhaps in the
ways<00:03:27.310> that<00:03:27.549> it<00:03:27.700> helps<00:03:27.970> you<00:03:28.180> perhaps<00:03:28.840> in<00:03:29.230> the

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:29.320 
ways that it helps you perhaps in the

ways that it helps you perhaps in the

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:30.820 
ways that you can release it that you

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:32.610 
ways that you can release it that you
hadn't<00:03:31.150> thought<00:03:31.180> of<00:03:31.390> prior<00:03:31.810> to<00:03:32.049> that<00:03:32.200> moment

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440
