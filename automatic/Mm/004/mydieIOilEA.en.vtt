00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.350
 Hello my name is Dominik and I will show you videos about Apple 

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:07.060
 and Mac OS 10 

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:10.320
 and i want to give you the privacy feature of AllThingsD 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.039
 show with the private release here on up to five computers in the 

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:20.729
 to share home network and their library from iTunes and here too 

00:00:20.729 --> 00:00:26.499
 These five computers legally trade you that because instead of doing so 

00:00:26.499 --> 00:00:30.609
 However, these five computers would have to activate each computer 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:35.370
 the fourth victory would like to be released from per year released from integrated EKD 

00:00:35.369 --> 00:00:38.120
 and must be activated 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.500
 that has the reason that you do not just say Hey Hey I bring 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:42.550
 my netbook with 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.340
 includes the Internet Sand Dietmar Schneider the Auditors Media Center 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.560
 to me, of course, all the music I need and we divide and 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.440
 Disable computer so it is not thought the exact license terms 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:54.370
 looks at Bednar 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.740
 I'll just show you how it works 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:01.900
 and I show you in this video by the like the training on a vest 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.980
 white works so first on my 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.030
 Percent main computer on mine 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.630
 MAK I have already released the media library and now another way 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.610
 Incidentally, this can also be - as Jun could almost certainly be identical and 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:16.420
 that's why 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.000
 Percent show that he does not 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.510
 here on the other 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:25.210
 Computer Ing as a recent sage is expanding private enabling 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:30.210
 This window could be important here, the animal is always the same Apple 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.820
 Haiti uses that means 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.360
 a mound that use around 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.690
 on all computers on an incentive devices due to the media library 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.620
 So access 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.440
 so I go now 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.390
 APA Aldi 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.540
 and my password and then say create private share 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.000
 so after entering the data and my old crying 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.070
 and my password, private sharing is now enabled 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:06.630
 I can access the library I could find myself here in Yemen 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.120
 and connect me 

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:12.870
 and could say Unkel I want the song of Lady Gaga now 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.699
 for example 

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:17.709
 then I pull that over let go 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:18.469
 it will 

00:02:18.469 --> 00:02:22.909
 copied on my computer and is my library 

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:27.539
 also a copied means I have this literary pub 

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:32.049
 on my computer is important only that this computer here 

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:34.659
 has been activated 

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:39.150
 wa so you can not play songs if not activated 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.959
 That was also thought when we set the private release and up to five 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.959
 Computer could you do that 

00:02:47.969 --> 00:02:51.589
 yes this is the private release in iTunes on Windows it works the same way 

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:54.770
 and not since operating noise Vigier 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:57.770
 with one in OS Device the whole power 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:02.659
 such tirades is successful 

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:05.749
 and would like to access my library with pride 

00:03:05.749 --> 00:03:09.529
 I have specified then I go first to the settings 

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:12.869
 the app on 

00:03:12.869 --> 00:03:17.779
 and enter the same data under the item Privatfreigabe 

00:03:17.779 --> 00:03:21.499
 the IG has already registered on the computer 

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:25.289
 and then van der Hooft could go bankrupt 

00:03:27.179 --> 00:03:30.019
 under 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:31.729
 shares 

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:35.089
 also release Breul media library 

00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:36.959
 Here he sees himself connecting 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:42.759
 and here I can not only music is Freeman but for example Kauch 

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:47.689
 Here are videos of DVDs with the program Hambrecht for me 

00:03:47.689 --> 00:03:50.169
 Picture finished with hope 

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:55.430
 On the long train from the long flight had been around many can watch and 

00:03:55.429 --> 00:03:59.559
 I'll say the Lord of the Rings, for example, if that's me 

00:03:59.559 --> 00:04:02.939
 I would like to be here now 

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:05.939
 what I'm connected to the iPhone with an airport extreme 

00:04:07.149 --> 00:04:10.919
 my computer can also be seen with the composite it looks like it works 

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:15.389
 actually relatively well it was pretty fast that the movie is over for 

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:17.840
 he will and 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.840
 that works too 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.870
 so on the iPad that works similarly I go here again 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:30.900
 the settings 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:32.930
 he then too 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:33.790
 iPod 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:37.580
 and she needs the same data here in the private release 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.490
 Wiesbaden computer 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:43.490
 you then mine too 

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:48.189
 if i want another media library click here behind 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:51.919
 the media library 

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:53.199
 out 

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:57.889
 he connects to the media library we can see here and 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:00.889
 in Italy she sees briefly 

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:06.889
 and even then can not access the music so now with the media library 

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:08.150
 connected 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:10.559
 and could now 

00:05:10.559 --> 00:05:13.729
 also stream here 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:17.309
 the same applies to the festival of peace filming so on how should the 

00:05:17.309 --> 00:05:20.559
 Normal form showed everything no problem at all
