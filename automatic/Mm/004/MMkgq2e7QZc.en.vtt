 Welcome to a new episode of the mode 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.330
 race with the brighton and how can you 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:10.610

 league at home we play against chelsea 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.179
 that comes from winning three matches 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.490
 followed as you are seeing so this 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:19.190
 It can be a real let partidazo 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:21.950
 there and look at the classification that 

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:24.590
 we are third with 46 the chelsea 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:26.210
 in front of us with 48 if we win this 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.790
 we advance them in the 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.860
 classification so we already have a 

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:33.680
 reason more to go to the three points in 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:35.330
 this game we are going to stop careful that 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.950

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.130
 very important points to follow 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.869
 climbing positions in the table we 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.720
