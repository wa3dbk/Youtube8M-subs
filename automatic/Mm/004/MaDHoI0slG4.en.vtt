 Well, this is the first of the 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:30.519
 celebrations that of which I was 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.980
 speaking how good is easy enough it 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:36.400
 flame lift the arm 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:39.010
 in xbox is achieved by holding the button 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.900
 go pressed ok you have to have what 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.970
 you have to keep pressed and in 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.220
 playstation3 the same but with the 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:48.010
 circle ok press circle and what 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:52.230
 you keep and well, it will make you this 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.230
 holding up the arm 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.530
 we go with the next 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:08.140
 the discs 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.990
 well this is the second that I present 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:17.830
 is the management the ear is a 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:19.210
 Very very Italian celebration is worth the 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.730
 truth is that it is very well and before the 

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:24.100
 I used to do a lot, it's like, 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.230
 the hand a little on the ear and I was going 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.760
 moving the hand as will go what goal 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.000
 what do you get mother 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:34.230
 Well then this is the second 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:39.310
 celebration and good this is achieved in 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:40.510
 xbox by holding down the y button and 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.490
 Playstation 3 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:45.160
 because the same thing you do not keep pressed the 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:48.200
 Triangle button is valid and you will get this 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:51.819
 gesture gesture in the ear or 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.819
 as what you want to call 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.580
 go hug 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.030
 well, these celebrations suck 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.280
 the good finger 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:17.560
 Many people can confuse the 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.720
 with command to shut up, it's the same, so is this 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:22.300
 celebration and the rival believes that 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.520
 you are shushing good is not it is not 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:28.389
 well, but for you to know that good 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:30.310
 from from this angle not from 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:32.650
 this perspective, it may seem that 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.419
 is sending a word but it is not like that 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:38.230
 you get this celebration of sucking 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:41.200
 the good finger for xbox pool 6x i 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:45.160
 you keep the button is valid and in x 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:47.960
 and in playstation3 you press the square and 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:50.000
 you keep the square pressed 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:52.460
 you see that these are very simple 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.590
 let's move on to the next level 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:58.060
 a little bit more complicated maybe but 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:58.060
 come on, nothing, nothing great 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:10.320
 go to the area 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:10.320
 to mark in an incredible way 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:15.860
 Well now I will explain how 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:20.870

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:43.070
 the truth is that it's pretty pretty to me 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:45.920
 I like a lot 

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:48.230
