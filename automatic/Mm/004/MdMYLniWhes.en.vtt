00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 Ah 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:13.370
 Even if I just look at Haha, 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:16.260
 I do not want Hatu to be a total small to medium-sized player. 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:25.070
 Yes in one day 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:25.070
 Ah 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:34.110
 Hi good tv yes 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:38.489
 Robot technology from day to day life that is developed can be found without difficulty as a consumer products 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:41.879
 A typical example is the Novo cleaner. 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:46.590
 But the price is expensive and not cheerful 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:51.449
 Batteries so long because the people are quite uncomfortable LOTS 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:57.840
 This time, I would like to introduce you to a product that is smart enough to cost. 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:01:03.420
 It is the mr6500 which is the newest cleaner creep ni to show about the cause 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:09.090
 First of all, when you look at the configuration of the product , 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:11.340
 I'm particularly looking at the main ansel not designed as a slim young people will love 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:15.330
 I think it 's a good design . 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:18.450
 And this is the driver you need to install the side brush. 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:22.759
 It's a little attention to detail. 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.759
 Let's see how it's used. 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:34.990
 Oh, pig. We're not alone. 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.990
 I can not do it. 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:46.750
 U- mr6500 prevented the emergence of a crash through the center 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.750
 It minimizes the damage caused when cleaning gangeunmi Wallpaper 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.660
 wire 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:02:04.810
 This is the center to detect obstacles. 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:07.990
 I had a lot of things in my room , so I was worried that I could grow up my secretary . 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:11.670
 But I need to know cleanly without clogging 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.670
 So it's completely smart. 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:25.410
 Oh, now I'm going to put my head on and try on my clothes. 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:30.970
 Oh, why do I spread a lot of hair 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:38.940
 Oh, I need a strong, quick cleaning in these places. 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:38.940
 But then the cleaner heard that the hot workforce is weak and it's okay. 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:48.030
 The mr6500 uses a high-performance bldc motor and outputs 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:51.360
 It represents a 30% stronger performance 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:57.150
 It can also be used 10 times longer than a normal motor. 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:03:02.690
 Dog begging is also three times more life than nickel batteries of innocent human hair req 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:02.690
 It is safer and longer to use by adopting ferric phosphate iron curry 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:12.510
 Aaaa also cleaner n 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:12.510
 How important geoguna the motor let's get warm personality 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:25.269
 Oh, right here. There's dust under the bed. 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:25.269
 What would you like to do? 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:45.970
 With a slip arm of 82m in height , the shadow cleaning mode is a vacuum cleaner 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:50.340
 A bar like under the bed or a sofa that was not possible, 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.340
 So you can use it more conveniently 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:04:01.459
 Dust in the wind is also visible where niche that only love can not anymore to clean every corner of the road 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:01.459
 No worries. 

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:17.160
 Klingon Klingon'm also possible to operate the remote control almost all mr6500 

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:17.160
 Thanks to that, it's also possible to clean the car with so much tea. 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.920
 5 

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:26.920
 Ah 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:37.240
 Thank you. 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:47.160
 I had an ear key. After 1 hour, I made a reservation every day. 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.160
 I'll give it to you. 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:54.700
 Connected to a charger in the morning and go out only with reservations, 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:06.100
 We take care of your own self sesame turn gives them a reference to a specified time 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:20.240
 U 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:25.520
 Oh , I'm going to have a cheer without a general affair. 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:29.620
 I think even cleaning the color through the discharge of the indicator micrograph 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.620
 We support the density of mop cleaner 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:36.180
 Strong suction force to every corner 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:42.480
 Not to mention the smart performance that adds convenience 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:46.410
 Bonnie's Feeling Ring mr6500 up to a reasonable price at once 

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:51.770
