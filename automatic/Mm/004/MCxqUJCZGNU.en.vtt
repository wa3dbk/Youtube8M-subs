00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.570 
wheel is going to go on a smaller radius
arc<00:01:03.480> and<00:01:03.840> so<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:04.559> outside<00:01:04.949> wheel<00:01:05.100> has<00:01:05.400> been

arc and so the outside wheel has been

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.320 
arc and so the outside wheel has been
faster<00:01:06.150> to<00:01:06.180> make<00:01:06.510> up<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.900> distance<00:01:07.320> traveled

wheels<00:02:10.349> will<00:02:10.679> spin

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
wheels will spin

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.300 
wheels will spin
at<00:02:11.909> the<00:02:12.180> at<00:02:12.510> the<00:02:12.629> same<00:02:12.840> time<00:02:13.230> so<00:02:13.920> that<00:02:13.950> the

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
at the at the same time so that the

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.479 
at the at the same time so that the
differential<00:02:14.879> is<00:02:15.060> locked<00:02:15.599> or<00:02:16.069> it's<00:02:17.069> not<00:02:17.280> being

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
differential is locked or it's not being

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:19.520 
differential is locked or it's not being
a<00:02:17.549> differential<00:02:18.000> anymore<00:02:18.420> and<00:02:18.599> that<00:02:19.200> will<00:02:19.379> get

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
a differential anymore and that will get

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.910 
a differential anymore and that will get
you<00:02:19.769> get<00:02:20.069> you<00:02:20.190> unstuck<00:02:20.370> so<00:02:21.209> in<00:02:21.420> this<00:02:21.540> truck

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
you get you unstuck so in this truck

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.229 
you get you unstuck so in this truck
either<00:02:22.920> going<00:02:23.190> forward<00:02:23.670> or<00:02:23.819> backwards

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
either going forward or backwards

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:25.190 
either going forward or backwards
because<00:02:24.330> there's<00:02:24.569> actually<00:02:24.840> two<00:02:24.989> of<00:02:25.110> these

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
because there's actually two of these

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.960 
because there's actually two of these
one<00:02:25.500> for<00:02:25.530> a<00:02:25.769> forward<00:02:26.159> direction<00:02:26.580> and<00:02:26.640> one<00:02:26.790> for

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
one for a forward direction and one for

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.720 
one for a forward direction and one for
backwards<00:02:27.330> direction<00:02:27.650> well<00:02:28.650> grab<00:02:29.280> onto<00:02:29.489> this

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
backwards direction well grab onto this

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.930 
backwards direction well grab onto this
lock<00:02:30.480> it<00:02:30.660> in<00:02:30.780> place<00:02:31.459> you<00:02:32.459> know<00:02:32.549> when<00:02:32.670> we<00:02:32.790> will

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
lock it in place you know when we will

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.030 
lock it in place you know when we will
start<00:02:33.000> spinning<00:02:33.330> and<00:02:33.780> the<00:02:34.590> weights<00:02:34.769> will<00:02:34.890> move

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
start spinning and the weights will move

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.220 
start spinning and the weights will move
out<00:02:35.160> to<00:02:35.459> lock<00:02:35.640> it<00:02:35.790> in<00:02:35.879> place<00:02:35.910> the<00:02:36.810> wheels<00:02:37.110> will

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
out to lock it in place the wheels will

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.690 
out to lock it in place the wheels will
get<00:02:37.379> traction<00:02:37.950> and<00:02:38.129> then<00:02:38.790> a<00:02:39.000> way<00:02:39.329> it<00:02:39.480> will<00:02:39.569> go

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
get traction and then a way it will go

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.280 
get traction and then a way it will go
and<00:02:41.700> that's<00:02:41.819> how<00:02:41.970> that<00:02:42.120> that<00:02:42.690> system<00:02:43.049> works

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
and that's how that that system works

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.949 
and that's how that that system works
there<00:02:44.040> are<00:02:44.190> different<00:02:44.549> types<00:02:44.760> of<00:02:45.030> torque

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
there are different types of torque

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.110 
there are different types of torque
sensing<00:02:46.500> and<00:02:46.739> locking<00:02:47.040> differentials<00:02:47.700> but

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
sensing and locking differentials but

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.210 
sensing and locking differentials but
this<00:02:48.299> one<00:02:48.510> is<00:02:48.660> a<00:02:48.859> is<00:02:49.859> a<00:02:50.340> pretty<00:02:50.819> simple<00:02:51.150> one<00:02:51.329> and

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
this one is a is a pretty simple one and

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.910 
this one is a is a pretty simple one and
looks<00:02:53.220> like<00:02:53.280> GM<00:02:53.579> likes<00:02:53.790> it
