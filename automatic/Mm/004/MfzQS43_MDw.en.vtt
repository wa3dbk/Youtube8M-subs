00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.719
 but one smoothie is missing 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.089
 what am i talking about 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.680
 simple it is a basic smoothie 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.840
 of fresh yogurt fruit 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.390
 let's see together what my smoothie is 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.070
 conferred for today to prepare it 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.980
 smoothie with red fruits we have 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:31.679
 need 250 g of low-fat plain yogurt 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:36.059
 150 grams of strawberries 100 g of raspberries 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:40.170
 100 g of optional currant 50 ml 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.879
 of optional milk 20 grams of honey 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.149
 clearly the preparation of the smooth 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:47.940
 ii banal but I suggest you what 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.879
 I like it better you can use it all 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.660
 the fruit you like then I have here 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.620
 of currants 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.690
 now I'm going to remove from the twig or 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.550
 so poured the currants inside a 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:09.510
 glass blender we put the 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:13.430
 strawberries and raspberries and then the chosen yogurt 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:16.140
 a natural white yogurt 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:19.549
 you can choose all the yogurts you have 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.549
 they also like fruit better 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.799
 Meanwhile, we want to see if the 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.909
 otherwise we like texture well 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.909
 add a little milk 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:38.220
 well almost almost a little milk there 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.440
 maybe not all put a couple of 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:44.729
 spoons I like you do n't hear a little more 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:47.119
 soft and would also put about e 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:53.869
 spoon of honey 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:53.869

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:03.840
 we clean the protective cover, and serve immediately 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.580
 smoothie that is perfect for a snack but 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.740
 you can also serve it for a breakfast 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.810
 to start the day in the best possible way 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.020

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.520
