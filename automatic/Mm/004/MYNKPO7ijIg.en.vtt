00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
at least a little bit combine that with

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.410 
at least a little bit combine that with
the<00:00:50.370> fact<00:00:50.489> that<00:00:50.610> I've<00:00:50.760> also<00:00:50.940> been<00:00:51.120> having<00:00:51.390> a

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
the fact that I've also been having a

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.240 
the fact that I've also been having a
bit<00:00:51.539> of<00:00:51.570> dental<00:00:51.960> work<00:00:51.989> done<00:00:52.170> at<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.620> same<00:00:52.800> time

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
bit of dental work done at the same time

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.950 
bit of dental work done at the same time
which<00:00:53.579> is<00:00:53.610> a<00:00:53.760> great<00:00:54.149> combination

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
which is a great combination

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.680 
which is a great combination

but um I want to plan it out a bit first
and<00:02:31.540> get<00:02:32.380> going<00:02:32.680> there<00:02:32.920> but<00:02:33.520> um<00:02:33.700> what<00:02:34.330> else<00:02:34.480> is
