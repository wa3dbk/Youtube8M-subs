00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:04.390
 first four measures of the sequence 

00:00:02.439 --> 00:00:07.319
 of blues for a sixth string chord 

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:07.319
 in this case the 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:17.570
 the first four measures on the 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:20.240
 but what happens if I go to 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:22.820
 there are four measures of four times 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:25.279
 that is, sixteen times in a single actor 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.259
 of no movement can become a 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:29.689
 so annoying riding boring then 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:31.730
 that I have, I have the option to add 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:33.710
 some tensions to my chords 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.260
 dominant to give you a little bit of 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.680
 color or a little density to the 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.680
 chords 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:44.220
 if I add 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.780
 my little finger 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:49.820
 in the space sense of the second 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.820
 string I have a chord with 13 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:57.600
 if the style I have again a 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.650
 seventh we had seen that I could have 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.540
 alternative modification this seventh 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:05.770
 so I can do this movement for 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:08.320
 example 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:12.010
 2. 3 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.010
 and you 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:23.030
 it becomes much less by another the 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.730
 same case I can do in the first 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:28.360
 rope if I put on the first string 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:31.750
 of the mexica video in the seventh space 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:33.910
 it's a ninth chord 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:37.840
 that is also a viable care 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:39.670
 feasible for the dominant chord if I 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:44.800
 stretched my finger I will give a ninth 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:46.210
 augmented conditioner but it's also 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.700
 part of the minor pentatonic scale 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.650
 be able to be the blues that I use to play 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:54.900
 above this sequence therefore 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.900
 I can also play with these two notes 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:05.410
 Y 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:12.170
 I can combine the two tensions 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:16.400
 natural social the three dinners and the 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:19.060
 ninth in the same tournament they give me a 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:22.400
 much more color has already gone to Miami 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:25.500
 to my sequence 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.990
 I make the first four measures 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:31.819
 only by the agreed of the seventh and 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:34.819
 then I got all the tensions 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:34.819
 3a 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:48.310
 now with tensions 3
