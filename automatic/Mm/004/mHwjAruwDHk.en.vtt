line<00:02:51.010> I<00:02:51.609> take<00:02:52.180> evasive<00:02:52.540> action<00:02:52.780> and<00:02:53.260> well<00:02:53.739> I

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:53.769 
line I take evasive action and well I

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:55.949 
line I take evasive action and well I
suppose<00:02:54.220> ya<00:02:54.519> did<00:02:54.760> overtake<00:02:55.150> him<00:02:55.329> off<00:02:55.569> the<00:02:55.750> road

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
suppose ya did overtake him off the road

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:58.229

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:45.059 
probably was an illegal overtake but
that's<00:03:43.480> not<00:03:43.720> the<00:03:43.870> point<00:03:44.049> I'm<00:03:44.379> baking<00:03:44.650> at<00:03:44.919> this

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:45.069 
that's not the point I'm baking at this

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:47.610 
that's not the point I'm baking at this
stage<00:03:45.370> and<00:03:45.669> have<00:03:46.389> let<00:03:46.599> through<00:03:46.810> a<00:03:46.840> Ferrari<00:03:47.260> so

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
stage and have let through a Ferrari so

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.409 
stage and have let through a Ferrari so
I<00:03:47.650> haven't<00:03:48.010> got<00:03:48.129> a<00:03:48.160> penalty<00:03:48.549> for<00:03:48.730> it<00:03:48.910> and<00:03:49.120> I'm

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:49.419 
I haven't got a penalty for it and I'm

00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:50.729 
I haven't got a penalty for it and I'm
now<00:03:49.569> going<00:03:49.750> to<00:03:49.810> try<00:03:49.989> and<00:03:50.109> slip<00:03:50.379> down<00:03:50.620> the

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:50.739 
now going to try and slip down the

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:52.020 
now going to try and slip down the
inside<00:03:51.010> of<00:03:51.069> the<00:03:51.220> Ferrari<00:03:51.579> into<00:03:51.819> the

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
inside of the Ferrari into the

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:53.939 
inside of the Ferrari into the
penultimate<00:03:52.269> corner<00:03:52.690> that's<00:03:53.349> come<00:03:53.620> off<00:03:53.739> quite

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:53.949 
penultimate corner that's come off quite

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:56.550 
penultimate corner that's come off quite
well<00:03:54.010> actually<00:03:54.340> that's<00:03:54.699> very<00:03:55.090> surprising<00:03:55.560> but

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
well actually that's very surprising but

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.259 
well actually that's very surprising but
what's<00:03:56.799> depressing<00:03:57.099> is<00:03:57.519> that<00:03:57.549> I'm<00:03:57.790> only<00:03:57.910> now

00:03:58.259 --> 00:03:58.269 
what's depressing is that I'm only now

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:01.050 
what's depressing is that I'm only now
in<00:03:58.449> P<00:03:58.629> 16<00:03:58.870> so<00:03:59.349> after<00:03:59.590> two<00:03:59.799> laps<00:04:00.069> I'm<00:04:00.370> right<00:04:00.849> back

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
in P 16 so after two laps I'm right back

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:02.009 
in P 16 so after two laps I'm right back
where<00:04:01.120> I<00:04:01.359> started

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:02.019 
where I started

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:03.930 
where I started
and<00:04:02.199> there's<00:04:02.560> a<00:04:02.620> Toro<00:04:02.889> so<00:04:03.220> they're<00:04:03.430> just<00:04:03.609> part

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940 
and there's a Toro so they're just part

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:05.939 
and there's a Toro so they're just part
on<00:04:04.180> the<00:04:04.299> start/finish<00:04:04.810> straight<00:04:04.840> he's<00:04:05.620> giving

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:05.949 
on the start/finish straight he's giving

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:07.439 
on the start/finish straight he's giving
up<00:04:06.040> with<00:04:06.190> the<00:04:06.280> race<00:04:06.489> and<00:04:06.819> frankly<00:04:07.299> I<00:04:07.329> don't

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:07.449 
up with the race and frankly I don't

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:08.879 
up with the race and frankly I don't
blame<00:04:07.660> him<00:04:07.959> because<00:04:08.079> I'm<00:04:08.319> very<00:04:08.500> close<00:04:08.829> to

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:08.889 
blame him because I'm very close to

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:10.979 
blame him because I'm very close to
doing<00:04:09.280> the<00:04:09.400> same<00:04:09.639> there<00:04:10.180> was<00:04:10.239> another<00:04:10.510> car<00:04:10.810> off

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:38.380 
right where that could have ended a far

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:41.250 
right where that could have ended a far
more<00:04:38.410> miserably<00:04:39.070> than<00:04:39.310> it<00:04:39.430> did<00:04:39.610> and<00:04:39.990> some<00:04:40.990> car

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:41.260 
more miserably than it did and some car

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.320 
more miserably than it did and some car
has<00:04:41.560> literally<00:04:41.889> just<00:04:42.190> splattered<00:04:42.760> themselves

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.330 
has literally just splattered themselves

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:46.439 
has literally just splattered themselves
out<00:04:43.510> on<00:04:44.040> me<00:04:45.040> they<00:04:45.310> just<00:04:45.340> clattered<00:04:46.030> into<00:04:46.330> me

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:46.449 
out on me they just clattered into me

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:47.879 
out on me they just clattered into me
and<00:04:46.540> they've<00:04:46.660> gone<00:04:46.810> spinning<00:04:47.500> gone<00:04:47.650> for<00:04:47.860> a

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:47.889 
and they've gone spinning gone for a

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:50.850 
and they've gone spinning gone for a
walk<00:04:48.160> into<00:04:48.850> the<00:04:49.180> gravel<00:04:49.419> and<00:04:49.780> I've<00:04:50.290> gone<00:04:50.620> away

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 
walk into the gravel and I've gone away

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:52.560 
walk into the gravel and I've gone away
very<00:04:51.160> lightly<00:04:51.490> there<00:04:51.820> which<00:04:51.970> is<00:04:52.120> very<00:04:52.180> nice

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:52.570 
very lightly there which is very nice

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:54.300 
very lightly there which is very nice
indeed<00:04:52.720> still<00:04:53.139> behind<00:04:53.470> this<00:04:53.560> Mercedes<00:04:53.889> are

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.310 
indeed still behind this Mercedes are

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.010 
indeed still behind this Mercedes are
going<00:04:54.520> towards<00:04:54.820> the<00:04:54.880> final<00:04:55.060> few<00:04:55.270> corners<00:04:55.630> it's

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020 
going towards the final few corners it's

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.170 
going towards the final few corners it's
going<00:04:56.229> to<00:04:56.290> be<00:04:56.380> a<00:04:56.410> very<00:04:56.830> very<00:04:57.160> late<00:04:57.580> and<00:04:57.940> rash

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:58.180 
going to be a very very late and rash

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:59.700 
going to be a very very late and rash
move<00:04:58.479> for<00:04:58.750> me<00:04:58.900> if<00:04:59.050> it's<00:04:59.169> going<00:04:59.320> to<00:04:59.380> come<00:04:59.590> off

00:04:59.700 --> 00:04:59.710 
move for me if it's going to come off

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:01.620 
move for me if it's going to come off
but<00:05:00.010> it<00:05:00.160> looks<00:05:00.340> like<00:05:00.430> I'm<00:05:00.729> way<00:05:00.940> too<00:05:01.000> far<00:05:01.419> back

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:01.630 
but it looks like I'm way too far back

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:03.900 
but it looks like I'm way too far back
as<00:05:01.840> we<00:05:01.960> go<00:05:02.110> into<00:05:02.290> the<00:05:02.530> penultimate<00:05:02.740> corner<00:05:03.220> the

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:03.910 
as we go into the penultimate corner the

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:05.730 
as we go into the penultimate corner the
car<00:05:04.150> ahead<00:05:04.330> of<00:05:04.450> him<00:05:04.660> jumped<00:05:05.110> there<00:05:05.320> must<00:05:05.620> be

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:05.740 
car ahead of him jumped there must be

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:07.140 
car ahead of him jumped there must be
using<00:05:06.040> the<00:05:06.130> flu<00:05:06.340> Network<00:05:06.729> from<00:05:06.880> Harry<00:05:07.090> Potter

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:07.150 
using the flu Network from Harry Potter

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.540 
using the flu Network from Harry Potter
and<00:05:07.660> it's<00:05:07.810> a<00:05:07.900> rather<00:05:08.110> desperate<00:05:08.500> dive<00:05:09.070> down

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:09.550 
and it's a rather desperate dive down

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:12.600
