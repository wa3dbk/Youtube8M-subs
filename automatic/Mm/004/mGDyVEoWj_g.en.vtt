00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:06.530
 The function will run from the V800 

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:09.379
 and to and also how to zoom in 

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:14.059
 for you so 

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:18.350
 so you can see the date and status here 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:21.050
 the settings the teske the timers favorite 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:24.800
 and again time a bit like the polar 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:26.900
 m400 madea this v800 definitely more 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:30.890
 options so we are going a bit strange 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:33.140
 by the date 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.030
 yes then you can do sleeves training like 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.710
 Students can already be 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:41.000
 well this is back so that is very crazy 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:42.920
 yes this intuitive so I click here and 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.800
 that's back and racing is just because of him 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:48.140
 this smears the enter button in my eyes 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.790
 is this simply the most logical and yes 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.620
 the piece if you're quite the running 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.540
 a lot of sports 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.300
 You don't want to think about it all 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:59.329
 functions and how that works exactly 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:02.390
 so in my eyes it is actually it 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:06.370
 feels best and better at the suunto that I do 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:08.840
 also can test you at the moment 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:12.770
 but well the horns 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:16.610
 status and recovery clearly 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:18.380
 activity week and then its around well 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.640
 You can also view the weeks here 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:25.810
 if there is anything in it my rhythm 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:29.320
 not always the daily activity 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.320
 with the calories 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.789
 and the recovery but good i have here 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:36.079
 I did a lot of sports here 

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:40.000
 so that he can find now very difficult 

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:40.000
 to indicate that gives also attracts so 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:47.630
 settings sport profiles physical settings 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.679
 general settings hello you 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.500
 settings 

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:54.530
 well then we are running around sport 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.610
 bicycles swimming other outdoor sports 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.450
 other indoor sports 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:01.849
 triathlon and brakes again well we brake 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:04.149
 so I find you the vibrate vibration function 

00:02:01.849 --> 00:02:05.689
 always nice so I usually say to 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:09.140
 had tight 

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:12.590
 settings the speed 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:15.049
 the pause car led I leave only briefly 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:18.019
 respond to the heartbeat 

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:22.120
 settings and stare per minute the 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:22.120
 summer or the sun I must say 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:28.810
 visible to other device now know 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.810
 but what they mean 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:31.870
 the more we figure out 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:39.640
 the rest speaks for itself 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:39.640
 to the gps too that's just 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.280
 with this you can do the snake and sport so me 

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:46.250
 Ga sometimes feels skate and a whole 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.780
 day or cloudy and training in the open 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.819
 to a whole day and two cycling races 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.590
 then you could have him on paulus 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:53.299
 but it seems that he just 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.389
 can record an entire day with the normal 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:58.639
 The settings I'm testing is 

00:02:56.389 --> 00:03:00.530
 get used to you very much back 

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:02.319
 cycling too similar to 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:05.480
 so we are not going to go through them all 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:07.310
 and physical settings my weight 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.600
 my height 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.680
 date of birth I am all going now 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:15.440
 I will now interfere with your institution 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.489
 but this whole 2 max, of course, that 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.319
 herd in the hall throughout pieces 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:19.519
 interesting setting that I enjoy 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:22.790
 is going to test 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:26.060
 well the general settings sinke names 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:28.220
 trip with a device is not possible because me 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:34.609
 have not now that in the meantime already at the 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:36.349
 so hand back a long time after one 

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:38.810
 little general stuff that is very much 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:40.070
 interesting and we are back here 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:44.180
 through the settings 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:46.250
 then I will take the tests out now 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.139
 and makes party videos of it 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.449
 who you text because it seems very bad to me 

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:51.880
 nice to show you how 

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:55.459
 works exactly 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:57.699
 so well that's going to be a separate one 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:04:02.209
 demonstrate video 

00:03:57.699 --> 00:04:06.549
 the timer stopwatch countdown 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:06.549
 speaks what is my name I think 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:11.030
 favorite de you can set favorites 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.859
 I'm going too 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:14.509
 there are separate pin or so that are the 

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:17.060
 settings of the 

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:20.180
 v800 and I'll just another video 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.560
 we can take a closer look at that 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:25.540
 feature function t-shirts and I will go 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:25.540
 also compare with a 920 xt
