so we've got you know the usual stuff we

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.830 
so we've got you know the usual stuff we
got<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.550> main<00:00:44.730> blade<00:00:44.969> I'm<00:00:45.270> not<00:00:45.510> gonna<00:00:45.660> go

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
got the main blade I'm not gonna go

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.209 
got the main blade I'm not gonna go
spend<00:00:46.260> too<00:00:46.350> much<00:00:46.500> time<00:00:46.559> on<00:00:46.829> that<00:00:46.980> because

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
spend too much time on that because

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.979 
spend too much time on that because
they're<00:00:47.489> pretty<00:00:47.700> standard<00:00:47.969> tools<00:00:48.390> across<00:00:48.719> the

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
they're pretty standard tools across the

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.340 
they're pretty standard tools across the
set<00:00:50.840> spare<00:00:51.840> blade

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
set spare blade

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.110 
set spare blade
I<00:00:52.379> call<00:00:53.100> it<00:00:53.190> spare<00:00:53.460> cuz<00:00:53.670> that's<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:53.910> one<00:00:54.090> I

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
I call it spare cuz that's the one I

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.350 
I call it spare cuz that's the one I
always<00:00:54.329> keep<00:00:54.629> sharp<00:00:54.980> scissors<00:00:55.980> so<00:00:56.969> far<00:00:57.239> it's

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
always keep sharp scissors so far it's

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:04.759 
always keep sharp scissors so far it's
just<00:00:57.420> like<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:57.809> supertanker<00:00:58.440> right<00:01:03.710> now<00:01:04.710> we

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
just like the supertanker right now we

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.820 
just like the supertanker right now we
start<00:01:05.250> to<00:01:05.339> get<00:01:05.460> different<00:01:05.700> here<00:01:06.680> at<00:01:07.680> the

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
start to get different here at the

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.770 
start to get different here at the
number<00:01:08.250> two<00:01:08.400> Phillips<00:01:08.790> it's<00:01:09.299> actually<00:01:09.659> more

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
number two Phillips it's actually more

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.710 
number two Phillips it's actually more
like<00:01:09.960> a<00:01:09.990> number<00:01:10.320> one<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:10.680> a<00:01:10.740> half<00:01:11.390> on<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.540> main

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
like a number one and a half on the main

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.899 
like a number one and a half on the main
set<00:01:12.990> so<00:01:13.350> it<00:01:13.710> sticks<00:01:13.979> out<00:01:14.130> there<00:01:14.430> you<00:01:14.640> can<00:01:14.820> get

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
set so it sticks out there you can get

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.510 
set so it sticks out there you can get
some<00:01:15.150> torque<00:01:15.479> I<00:01:15.810> mean<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.560> locks<00:01:16.770> 90<00:01:17.159> degrees

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
some torque I mean the locks 90 degrees

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.050 
some torque I mean the locks 90 degrees
or<00:01:18.450> you<00:01:18.750> can<00:01:18.960> extend<00:01:19.770> it<00:01:19.979> all<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.130> way<00:01:20.340> this<00:01:20.909> is

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
or you can extend it all the way this is

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.460 
or you can extend it all the way this is
nice<00:01:21.270> because<00:01:21.509> if<00:01:21.780> you<00:01:21.869> don't<00:01:22.049> have<00:01:22.200> a<00:01:22.229> lot<00:01:22.439> of

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
nice because if you don't have a lot of

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.620 
nice because if you don't have a lot of
clearance<00:01:22.890> around<00:01:23.070> your<00:01:23.460> you<00:01:24.299> know<00:01:24.420> whatever

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
clearance around your you know whatever

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.300 
clearance around your you know whatever
you're<00:01:24.900> wearing<00:01:25.080> your<00:01:25.320> screw<00:01:25.680> is<00:01:25.830> you<00:01:25.979> can<00:01:26.130> get

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
you're wearing your screw is you can get

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.910 
you're wearing your screw is you can get
in<00:01:26.460> there<00:01:26.670> and<00:01:26.850> still<00:01:27.630> turn<00:01:27.840> it<00:01:28.049> whereas<00:01:28.890> if

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
in there and still turn it whereas if

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.560 
in there and still turn it whereas if
it's<00:01:29.220> on<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.490> back<00:01:29.960> like<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.200> super<00:01:31.979> tinkerer

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
it's on the back like the super tinkerer

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.700 
it's on the back like the super tinkerer
then<00:01:33.570> you<00:01:33.750> can't<00:01:33.960> get<00:01:34.110> in<00:01:34.229> there<00:01:34.380> because<00:01:34.500> the

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
then you can't get in there because the

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.719 
then you can't get in there because the
handle<00:01:35.070> bangs<00:01:35.729> on<00:01:35.939> stuff<00:01:36.210> so<00:01:37.460> that's<00:01:38.460> nice

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
handle bangs on stuff so that's nice

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.249 
handle bangs on stuff so that's nice
that<00:01:38.970> was<00:01:39.119> one<00:01:39.270> of<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.420> main<00:01:39.570> reasons<00:01:39.990> I<00:01:40.079> like

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
that was one of the main reasons I like

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.450 
that was one of the main reasons I like
I<00:01:40.560> bought<00:01:40.710> this<00:01:40.950> one<00:01:42.470> opposite<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.649> number<00:01:44.310> 2

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
I bought this one opposite the number 2

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.770 
I bought this one opposite the number 2
