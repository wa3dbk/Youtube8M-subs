okay<00:00:10.350> so<00:00:10.410> our<00:00:10.620> repair<00:00:11.010> is<00:00:11.040> going<00:00:11.340> to<00:00:11.520> start

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:13.960 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:15.680 

this<00:00:14.470> is<00:00:14.680> which

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
this is which

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.120 
this is which
consider<00:00:15.959> very<00:00:16.410> severe<00:00:16.740> scratching<00:00:19.130> which

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
consider very severe scratching which

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.069 
consider very severe scratching which
we've<00:00:20.340> done<00:00:20.550> with<00:00:20.820> a<00:00:21.000> 200<00:00:21.860> grit<00:00:22.860> diamond<00:00:23.820> pad

00:00:24.069 --> 00:00:24.079 
we've done with a 200 grit diamond pad

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:29.029 
we've done with a 200 grit diamond pad
as<00:00:25.079> you<00:00:25.349> can<00:00:25.529> see<00:00:25.770> the<00:00:26.070> scratches<00:00:27.919> through<00:00:28.919> the

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
as you can see the scratches through the

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.450 
as you can see the scratches through the
courts<00:00:29.369> end<00:00:29.579> of<00:00:29.699> resin<00:00:30.950> okay<00:00:31.950> so<00:00:32.130> we<00:00:32.279> have<00:00:32.399> a

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
courts end of resin okay so we have a

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.280 
courts end of resin okay so we have a
nice<00:00:32.640> circle<00:00:34.100> see<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.219> scratches<00:00:36.140> see<00:00:37.140> it's

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
nice circle see the scratches see it's

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.350 
nice circle see the scratches see it's
definitely<00:00:37.739> hazy<00:00:39.950> okay<00:00:40.969> so<00:00:41.969> we're<00:00:42.120> going<00:00:42.239> to

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
definitely hazy okay so we're going to

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.970 
definitely hazy okay so we're going to
bring<00:00:42.510> this<00:00:42.719> up<00:00:42.989> I'm<00:00:43.230> going<00:00:43.440> to<00:00:43.500> quickly<00:00:43.680> go

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
bring this up I'm going to quickly go

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.330 
bring this up I'm going to quickly go
through<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.340> steps<00:00:44.610> just<00:00:44.940> to<00:00:45.780> show<00:00:45.989> you<00:00:46.340> where

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
through the steps just to show you where

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.520 
through the steps just to show you where
you<00:00:47.579> need<00:00:47.760> to<00:00:47.789> be<00:00:48.120> in<00:00:48.480> order<00:00:48.870> to<00:00:48.989> start<00:00:49.289> with

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
you need to be in order to start with

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.720 
you need to be in order to start with
the<00:00:49.620> quartz<00:00:49.890> from<00:00:49.980> it<00:00:51.499> okay<00:00:52.499> so<00:00:52.730> the

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
the quartz from it okay so the

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.809 
the quartz from it okay so the
scratching<00:00:54.539> that<00:00:54.690> we<00:00:54.780> have<00:00:54.960> in<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.819> quartz

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:56.819 
scratching that we have in the quartz

00:00:56.819 --> 00:01:01.669 
scratching that we have in the quartz
top<00:00:57.239> is<00:00:57.679> 200<00:00:58.679> grit<00:00:59.309> level<00:01:00.170> we've<00:01:01.170> done<00:01:01.350> some

00:01:01.669 --> 00:01:01.679 
top is 200 grit level we've done some

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:04.399 
top is 200 grit level we've done some
quick<00:01:01.859> polishing<00:01:02.519> with<00:01:02.729> that<00:01:02.940> 200<00:01:03.780> so<00:01:03.989> no<00:01:04.050> pad

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
quick polishing with that 200 so no pad

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.390 
quick polishing with that 200 so no pad
and<00:01:04.890> we're<00:01:05.729> going<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:06.030> work<00:01:06.180> our<00:01:06.360> way<00:01:06.390> up<00:01:06.720> from

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:07.400 
and we're going to work our way up from

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.480 
and we're going to work our way up from
here<00:01:08.400> so<00:01:09.210> I'm<00:01:09.570> going<00:01:09.810> to<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.229> 400<00:01:11.040> grit<00:01:11.220> pad

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
here so I'm going to the 400 grit pad

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.410 
here so I'm going to the 400 grit pad
and<00:01:11.820> I'm<00:01:12.720> going<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:13.220> lightly<00:01:14.220> mist<00:01:15.500> my<00:01:16.500> area

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
and I'm going to lightly mist my area

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.420 
and I'm going to lightly mist my area
I've<00:01:18.420> already<00:01:18.780> traced<00:01:19.110> around<00:01:19.440> the<00:01:19.890> haze<00:01:20.070> that

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
I've already traced around the haze that

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.900 
I've already traced around the haze that
was<00:01:20.640> there<00:01:20.910> with<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:21.960> China<00:01:22.230> pencil<00:01:22.880> you<00:01:23.880> know

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:23.910 
was there with the China pencil you know

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.630 
was there with the China pencil you know
whatever<00:01:24.240> works<00:01:24.780> for<00:01:24.960> you<00:01:25.350> trying<00:01:26.280> pencil

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
whatever works for you trying pencil

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.710 
whatever works for you trying pencil
works<00:01:26.790> great<00:01:27.060> but<00:01:27.840> does<00:01:28.410> help<00:01:28.680> you<00:01:28.860> keep

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
works great but does help you keep

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.050 
works great but does help you keep
focused<00:01:30.720> on<00:01:30.870> the<00:01:31.020> area<00:01:31.350> that<00:01:31.560> you're

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
focused on the area that you're

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.060 
focused on the area that you're
polishing<00:01:33.060> without<00:01:33.870> making<00:01:34.320> your<00:01:34.470> area<00:01:34.830> too

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
polishing without making your area too

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.860 
polishing without making your area too
large<00:01:35.340> so<00:01:36.500> and<00:01:37.500> using<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.040> storm<00:01:38.340> of<00:01:38.490> hats<00:01:38.870> we

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:39.870 
large so and using the storm of hats we

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:42.580 
large so and using the storm of hats we
are<00:01:40.050> going<00:01:40.320> to<00:01:40.440> use<00:01:40.590> a<00:01:40.890> slightly<00:01:41.250> higher<00:01:41.640> rpm

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
are going to use a slightly higher rpm

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.040 
are going to use a slightly higher rpm
than<00:01:43.590> we<00:01:43.740> would<00:01:43.920> with<00:01:44.040> a<00:01:44.100> resin<00:01:44.520> pad<00:01:44.870> resin<00:01:45.870> pad

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.050 
than we would with a resin pad resin pad

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.270 
than we would with a resin pad resin pad
Rico<00:01:46.740> low<00:01:47.640> very<00:01:48.120> low<00:01:48.210> rpms<00:01:48.960> and<00:01:49.410> at<00:01:49.590> 7<00:01:50.100> or<00:01:50.130> 800

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
Rico low very low rpms and at 7 or 800

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.860 
Rico low very low rpms and at 7 or 800
range

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:51.870 
range

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:55.040 
range
I'll<00:01:52.290> go<00:01:52.440> slightly<00:01:52.950> higher<00:01:53.130> with<00:01:53.400> this<00:01:54.050> with

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:55.050 
I'll go slightly higher with this with

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:57.440 
I'll go slightly higher with this with
wet<00:01:55.320> but<00:01:55.950> I<00:01:56.040> want<00:01:56.250> to<00:01:56.310> go<00:01:56.430> much<00:01:57.030> over<00:01:57.300> a

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
wet but I want to go much over a

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.130 
wet but I want to go much over a
thousand<00:01:58.040> as<00:01:59.040> we<00:01:59.370> do<00:02:00.120> not<00:02:00.270> have<00:02:00.330> a<00:02:00.540> water<00:02:00.750> feed

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
thousand as we do not have a water feed

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.040 
thousand as we do not have a water feed
and<00:02:01.760> primarily<00:02:02.760> the<00:02:03.060> reason<00:02:03.210> for<00:02:03.600> keeping<00:02:03.720> the

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.050 
and primarily the reason for keeping the

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.830 
and primarily the reason for keeping the
RPMs<00:02:04.500> low<00:02:04.860> is<00:02:05.640> so<00:02:05.970> that<00:02:06.090> your<00:02:06.270> water<00:02:06.510> is<00:02:06.690> not

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
RPMs low is so that your water is not

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.499 
RPMs low is so that your water is not
evaporating<00:02:07.740> if<00:02:07.890> you<00:02:08.250> know<00:02:08.399> so<00:02:08.849> quickly<00:02:09.360> that

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
evaporating if you know so quickly that

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:09.950 
evaporating if you know so quickly that
you<00:02:09.569> can

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:09.960 
you can

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.180 
you can
keep<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.350> top<00:02:10.560> wet<00:02:10.860> so<00:02:11.820> we<00:02:12.150> keep<00:02:12.330> a<00:02:12.480> low<00:02:12.660> rpm

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
keep the top wet so we keep a low rpm

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.700 
keep the top wet so we keep a low rpm
low<00:02:14.190> feed<00:02:14.490> rate<00:02:15.140> water<00:02:16.140> will<00:02:16.380> pretty<00:02:16.620> much

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
low feed rate water will pretty much

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.410 
low feed rate water will pretty much
stay<00:02:16.950> on<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:17.400> surface<00:02:17.610> and<00:02:18.030> you<00:02:18.120> don't<00:02:18.270> have

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
stay on the surface and you don't have

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.080 
stay on the surface and you don't have
to<00:02:18.630> miss<00:02:18.870> the<00:02:19.080> top<00:02:19.320> every<00:02:19.740> couple<00:02:20.580> seconds<00:02:21.060> to

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
to miss the top every couple seconds to

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.110 
to miss the top every couple seconds to
keep<00:02:21.330> it<00:02:21.510> wet<00:02:22.010> as<00:02:23.010> soon<00:02:23.220> as<00:02:23.370> the<00:02:23.550> product<00:02:24.000> gets

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
keep it wet as soon as the product gets

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.010 
keep it wet as soon as the product gets
as<00:02:24.720> soon<00:02:24.930> as<00:02:25.050> the<00:02:25.200> area<00:02:25.560> gets<00:02:25.740> dry<00:02:26.810> so<00:02:27.810> you<00:02:27.900> have

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
as soon as the area gets dry so you have

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.980 
as soon as the area gets dry so you have
a<00:02:28.230> high<00:02:28.350> potential<00:02:28.890> of<00:02:29.190> burning<00:02:30.180> in<00:02:30.300> the<00:02:30.420> resin

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
a high potential of burning in the resin

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.950 
a high potential of burning in the resin
in<00:02:31.080> the<00:02:31.170> top<00:02:31.410> very<00:02:32.130> quickly<00:02:32.510> so<00:02:33.510> when<00:02:33.810> you're

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:33.960 
in the top very quickly so when you're

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:39.350 
in the top very quickly so when you're
lower<00:02:34.200> low<00:02:34.530> rpms<00:02:37.310> plenty<00:02:38.310> water<00:02:38.520> low<00:02:39.120> feed

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
lower low rpms plenty water low feed

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:51.590 
lower low rpms plenty water low feed
rate<00:02:47.810> okay<00:02:48.810> so<00:02:48.870> we're<00:02:49.350> at<00:02:49.710> the<00:02:50.250> 800<00:02:50.970> grit<00:02:51.150> level

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
rate okay so we're at the 800 grit level

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.180 
rate okay so we're at the 800 grit level
now<00:02:52.310> with<00:02:53.310> the<00:02:53.610> sonic<00:02:54.210> pads<00:02:54.450> and<00:02:55.190> we've

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
now with the sonic pads and we've

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.760 
now with the sonic pads and we've
removed<00:02:56.430> our<00:02:56.880> damage<00:02:57.920> but<00:02:58.920> as<00:02:59.070> you<00:02:59.250> can<00:02:59.430> see

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:00.770 
removed our damage but as you can see

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:04.970 
removed our damage but as you can see
during<00:03:01.770> that<00:03:02.040> process<00:03:02.310> as<00:03:03.530> which<00:03:04.530> happens

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
during that process as which happens

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.050 
during that process as which happens
with<00:03:05.190> quartz<00:03:05.610> is<00:03:05.820> the<00:03:06.420> snakeskin<00:03:07.290> has<00:03:08.250> been

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
with quartz is the snakeskin has been

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.010 
with quartz is the snakeskin has been
removed<00:03:10.020> or<00:03:10.620> at<00:03:10.710> least<00:03:10.920> partially<00:03:11.520> removed

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:12.020 
removed or at least partially removed

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:15.950 
removed or at least partially removed
during<00:03:13.020> the<00:03:13.200> process<00:03:13.770> so<00:03:14.520> you<00:03:15.480> get<00:03:15.720> a<00:03:15.750> good

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:15.960 
during the process so you get a good

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.740 
during the process so you get a good
shot<00:03:16.260> here<00:03:16.560> where<00:03:16.710> you<00:03:16.770> can<00:03:16.920> really<00:03:17.880> see<00:03:18.270> the

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
shot here where you can really see the

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
shot here where you can really see the
difference<00:03:18.960> in<00:03:19.530> the<00:03:19.620> snakeskin<00:03:21.260> between<00:03:22.260> the

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:22.770 
difference in the snakeskin between the

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:28.670 
difference in the snakeskin between the
factory<00:03:23.340> level<00:03:23.550> which<00:03:24.510> is<00:03:24.720> here<00:03:25.640> and<00:03:27.680> where

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
factory level which is here and where

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.590 
factory level which is here and where
we've<00:03:28.920> been<00:03:29.130> polishing<00:03:29.760> which<00:03:30.210> is<00:03:30.390> right

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
we've been polishing which is right

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:35.420 
we've been polishing which is right
there<00:03:30.900> and<00:03:31.800> this<00:03:32.400> is<00:03:32.460> my<00:03:32.790> black<00:03:33.120> color<00:03:33.500> and<00:03:34.500> as

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
there and this is my black color and as

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.990 
there and this is my black color and as
you<00:03:36.270> notice<00:03:36.720> they<00:03:36.980> react<00:03:37.980> quite<00:03:38.490> differently

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
you notice they react quite differently

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.930 
you notice they react quite differently
to<00:03:39.270> polishing<00:03:40.550> okay<00:03:41.550> but<00:03:43.580> pretty<00:03:44.580> much<00:03:44.760> the

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
to polishing okay but pretty much the

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:49.940 
to polishing okay but pretty much the
same<00:03:46.130> effect<00:03:47.130> with<00:03:47.460> my<00:03:47.670> black<00:03:47.940> piece<00:03:48.440> as<00:03:49.440> you

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
same effect with my black piece as you

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:56.170 
same effect with my black piece as you
can<00:03:50.160> see<00:03:51.050> it's<00:03:52.050> my<00:03:52.230> snakeskin<00:03:52.740> back<00:03:53.520> here<00:03:53.940> and

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
can see it's my snakeskin back here and

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:01.100 
can see it's my snakeskin back here and
kind<00:03:57.180> of<00:03:57.240> a<00:03:57.360> glass-like<00:03:57.720> finish<00:03:58.190> on<00:03:59.190> my<00:04:00.110> my

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 
kind of a glass-like finish on my my

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:04.160 
kind of a glass-like finish on my my
polished<00:04:01.590> area<00:04:02.450> okay<00:04:03.450> it's<00:04:03.720> really<00:04:03.990> no

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
polished area okay it's really no

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.990 
polished area okay it's really no
snakeskin<00:04:04.740> at<00:04:04.890> all

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.480 

okay<00:04:08.660> so<00:04:08.720> we<00:04:08.930> worked<00:04:09.230> our<00:04:09.350> way<00:04:09.380> up<00:04:09.650> through<00:04:09.950> the

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:10.490 
okay so we worked our way up through the

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:13.800 
okay so we worked our way up through the
800<00:04:10.850> grit<00:04:11.240> level<00:04:11.630> with<00:04:12.470> the<00:04:12.710> sauropods<00:04:13.460> and

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
800 grit level with the sauropods and

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:17.190 
800 grit level with the sauropods and
now<00:04:14.810> we're<00:04:15.080> going<00:04:15.320> to<00:04:15.440> do<00:04:15.650> the<00:04:15.770> last<00:04:16.100> step<00:04:16.310> of

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:17.200 
now we're going to do the last step of

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:21.160 
now we're going to do the last step of
polishing<00:04:18.200> with<00:04:18.410> the<00:04:18.530> pads<00:04:19.030> this<00:04:20.030> is<00:04:20.239> 1500

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:21.170 
polishing with the pads this is 1500

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:24.100 
polishing with the pads this is 1500
grit<00:04:21.970> the<00:04:22.970> polishing<00:04:23.420> we've<00:04:23.540> been<00:04:23.690> doing<00:04:23.990> up

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
grit the polishing we've been doing up

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:29.710 
grit the polishing we've been doing up
to<00:04:24.230> this<00:04:24.260> point<00:04:24.620> has<00:04:24.890> been<00:04:24.920> a<00:04:25.870> low<00:04:26.870> rpm<00:04:28.720> slow

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 
to this point has been a low rpm slow

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:34.500 
to this point has been a low rpm slow
feed<00:04:29.990> rate<00:04:30.290> and<00:04:31.630> to<00:04:32.630> get<00:04:32.780> a<00:04:32.810> nice<00:04:33.050> even<00:04:33.470> finish

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:34.510 
feed rate and to get a nice even finish

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:37.600 
feed rate and to get a nice even finish
1500<00:04:35.510> while<00:04:36.200> traditionally<00:04:36.830> the<00:04:36.980> resin<00:04:37.400> pads

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610 
1500 while traditionally the resin pads

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.510 
1500 while traditionally the resin pads
would<00:04:37.850> go<00:04:38.030> for<00:04:38.210> 3,000<00:04:38.930> that<00:04:39.050> stops<00:04:39.410> at<00:04:39.650> 1500

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:40.520 
would go for 3,000 that stops at 1500

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:45.940 
would go for 3,000 that stops at 1500
and<00:04:42.250> this<00:04:43.250> would<00:04:43.550> be<00:04:43.760> completely<00:04:44.090> dry<00:04:44.890> all<00:04:45.890> the

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:45.950 
and this would be completely dry all the

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:50.470 
and this would be completely dry all the
previous<00:04:46.490> steps<00:04:46.790> we<00:04:47.000> did<00:04:47.150> wet<00:04:47.450> and<00:04:49.210> the<00:04:50.210> last

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:50.480 
previous steps we did wet and the last

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:54.370 
previous steps we did wet and the last
step<00:04:50.750> will<00:04:50.990> have<00:04:51.170> to<00:04:51.350> be<00:04:51.470> dry<00:04:51.770> the<00:04:52.580> pad<00:04:53.300> is<00:04:53.690> such

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:54.380 
step will have to be dry the pad is such

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:57.970 
step will have to be dry the pad is such
a<00:04:54.410> fine<00:04:54.790> grit<00:04:55.790> that<00:04:56.150> if<00:04:56.540> you<00:04:56.690> do<00:04:56.900> it<00:04:57.080> wet<00:04:57.320> it

00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:57.980 
a fine grit that if you do it wet it

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:59.680 
a fine grit that if you do it wet it
will<00:04:58.130> gum<00:04:58.310> up<00:04:58.520> immediately<00:04:59.150> and<00:04:59.360> you<00:04:59.510> won't

00:04:59.680 --> 00:04:59.690 
will gum up immediately and you won't

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:01.960 
will gum up immediately and you won't
get<00:04:59.870> good<00:05:00.050> results<00:05:00.500> so<00:05:01.370> this<00:05:01.700> will<00:05:01.880> be

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:01.970 
get good results so this will be

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:04.900 
get good results so this will be
completely<00:05:02.360> dry<00:05:02.570> and<00:05:02.930> higher<00:05:03.680> rpm<00:05:04.520> we're

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:04.910 
completely dry and higher rpm we're

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:09.850 
completely dry and higher rpm we're
going<00:05:05.030> to<00:05:05.090> run<00:05:05.350> around<00:05:06.350> 1800<00:05:07.250> rpm<00:05:07.760> and<00:05:08.860> this

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:09.860 
going to run around 1800 rpm and this

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:11.500 
going to run around 1800 rpm and this
makes<00:05:10.100> pretty<00:05:10.340> quick<00:05:10.640> work<00:05:10.820> of<00:05:11.000> it<00:05:11.150> this<00:05:11.300> will

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:11.510 
makes pretty quick work of it this will

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:15.880 
makes pretty quick work of it this will
be<00:05:11.540> the<00:05:11.660> last<00:05:13.660> step<00:05:14.660> like<00:05:14.870> I<00:05:14.990> said<00:05:15.230> and<00:05:15.530> it<00:05:15.680> will

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:15.890 
be the last step like I said and it will

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:18.990 
be the last step like I said and it will
it<00:05:16.490> will<00:05:16.730> pop<00:05:17.000> the<00:05:17.210> color<00:05:17.390> pretty<00:05:17.870> quickly<00:05:18.169> and

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:19.000 
it will pop the color pretty quickly and

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:26.380 
it will pop the color pretty quickly and
we<00:05:20.860> will<00:05:21.860> also<00:05:22.340> move<00:05:22.580> across<00:05:22.880> the<00:05:25.390> surface

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:26.390 
we will also move across the surface

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:39.780 
we will also move across the surface
quickly<00:05:27.020> as<00:05:27.560> well

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:39.790 

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:49.320 

a<00:05:40.950> 1500<00:05:41.950> grit<00:05:42.780> summer<00:05:43.780> pad<00:05:44.080> polishing<00:05:46.710> and<00:05:48.330> as

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:49.330 
a 1500 grit summer pad polishing and as

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:50.370 
a 1500 grit summer pad polishing and as
you<00:05:49.450> can<00:05:49.540> see<00:05:49.690> there's<00:05:49.840> a<00:05:49.930> little<00:05:50.080> bit<00:05:50.290> of

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:50.380 
you can see there's a little bit of

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:53.270 
you can see there's a little bit of
residual<00:05:50.980> hazing<00:05:51.490> at<00:05:51.610> this<00:05:51.790> point<00:05:52.260> our

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:53.280 
residual hazing at this point our

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:58.830 
residual hazing at this point our
snakeskin<00:05:54.280> is<00:05:54.610> definitely<00:05:55.680> gone<00:05:57.540> mostly<00:05:58.540> gone

00:05:58.830 --> 00:05:58.840 
snakeskin is definitely gone mostly gone

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:01.860 
snakeskin is definitely gone mostly gone
in<00:05:59.110> our<00:05:59.260> repair<00:05:59.710> area<00:06:00.220> as<00:06:01.030> you<00:06:01.210> can<00:06:01.390> see<00:06:01.630> in<00:06:01.780> the

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:01.870 
in our repair area as you can see in the

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:03.780 
in our repair area as you can see in the
forefront<00:06:02.350> there<00:06:02.710> the<00:06:02.980> snake<00:06:03.310> skin<00:06:03.580> is<00:06:03.670> pretty

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:03.790 
forefront there the snake skin is pretty

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:06.030 
forefront there the snake skin is pretty
prominent<00:06:04.300> that's<00:06:04.660> the<00:06:04.870> factory<00:06:05.410> finish

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:06.040 
prominent that's the factory finish

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:09.900 
prominent that's the factory finish
so<00:06:07.560> the<00:06:08.560> quartz<00:06:08.860> Renee<00:06:09.100> will<00:06:09.310> definitely<00:06:09.730> take

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:09.910 
so the quartz Renee will definitely take

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:13.530 
so the quartz Renee will definitely take
it<00:06:10.030> from<00:06:10.210> here<00:06:10.420> and<00:06:11.700> so<00:06:12.700> I<00:06:12.730> wanted<00:06:13.030> to

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:13.540 
it from here and so I wanted to

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:15.770 
it from here and so I wanted to
basically<00:06:14.230> do<00:06:14.560> this<00:06:14.740> to<00:06:14.920> give<00:06:15.100> you<00:06:15.220> a<00:06:15.250> visual

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:15.780 
basically do this to give you a visual

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:18.530 
basically do this to give you a visual
to<00:06:16.780> understand<00:06:17.230> where<00:06:17.500> you<00:06:17.740> need<00:06:17.920> to<00:06:18.070> start

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:18.540 
to understand where you need to start

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:23.280 
to understand where you need to start
with<00:06:19.540> this<00:06:19.830> with<00:06:20.830> the<00:06:21.010> quartz<00:06:21.460> renew<00:06:22.140> okay<00:06:23.140> we

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:23.290 
with this with the quartz renew okay we

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:29.540 
with this with the quartz renew okay we
finished<00:06:23.500> our<00:06:26.100> 1,500<00:06:27.240> summer<00:06:28.240> polishing

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:29.550

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:37.270 
know brought our gloss level up so that

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:41.780 
know brought our gloss level up so that
as<00:06:37.450> much<00:06:38.020> as<00:06:38.050> we<00:06:38.320> can<00:06:38.470> go<00:06:38.710> with<00:06:38.980> the<00:06:39.100> pads<00:06:39.370> so

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:41.790 

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:46.110 

show<00:06:42.790> you<00:06:42.850> a<00:06:43.000> niche<00:06:43.890> piece<00:06:44.890> here<00:06:45.220> there's<00:06:45.940> the

show you a niche piece here there's the
black<00:06:46.390> you<00:06:46.660> can<00:06:46.810> see<00:06:46.840> the<00:06:47.260> snake<00:06:47.800> skin<00:06:48.070> has

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:48.220 
black you can see the snake skin has

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:52.760 
black you can see the snake skin has
been<00:06:48.370> removed<00:06:49.350> and<00:06:50.350> most<00:06:50.770> of<00:06:50.950> our<00:06:51.130> repair<00:06:51.490> area

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:52.770 
been removed and most of our repair area

00:06:52.770 --> 00:07:01.950 
been removed and most of our repair area
our<00:06:53.770> scene<00:06:54.130> is<00:06:58.080> is<00:06:59.080> almost<00:06:59.860> there<00:07:00.660> the<00:07:01.660> quartz

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:01.960 
our scene is is almost there the quartz

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:03.990 
our scene is is almost there the quartz
renew<00:07:02.260> should<00:07:03.250> be<00:07:03.340> able<00:07:03.490> to<00:07:03.550> take<00:07:03.700> it<00:07:03.850> from

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:04.000 
renew should be able to take it from

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.070 
renew should be able to take it from
here<00:07:04.590> without<00:07:05.590> too<00:07:05.980> much<00:07:06.130> struggle<00:07:06.930> but<00:07:07.930> you

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:08.080 
here without too much struggle but you

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:09.690 
here without too much struggle but you
can<00:07:08.230> see<00:07:08.440> when<00:07:08.740> I<00:07:08.770> mentioned<00:07:09.340> that<00:07:09.460> there's

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:09.700 
can see when I mentioned that there's

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:11.970 
can see when I mentioned that there's
residual<00:07:10.300> hazing<00:07:10.840> and<00:07:11.020> that's<00:07:11.740> what<00:07:11.890> the

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:11.980 
residual hazing and that's what the

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:13.920 
residual hazing and that's what the
courts<00:07:12.280> will<00:07:12.340> new<00:07:12.520> addresses<00:07:12.910> this<00:07:13.330> is<00:07:13.540> what<00:07:13.900> I

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:13.930 
courts will new addresses this is what I

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:14.810 
courts will new addresses this is what I
mean

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:14.820 
mean

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:19.110 
mean
and<00:07:15.820> so<00:07:16.090> a<00:07:16.120> color<00:07:16.480> is<00:07:17.430> you<00:07:18.430> know<00:07:18.580> I<00:07:18.610> would<00:07:18.940> say

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:19.120 
and so a color is you know I would say

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:24.960 
and so a color is you know I would say
is<00:07:19.180> about<00:07:19.980> 80%<00:07:22.950> so<00:07:23.950> that's<00:07:24.460> a<00:07:24.580> point<00:07:24.820> of

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:24.970 
is about 80% so that's a point of

00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:27.620 
is about 80% so that's a point of
reference<00:07:25.120> the<00:07:26.080> black<00:07:26.380> is<00:07:26.650> obviously

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:27.630 
reference the black is obviously

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:30.150 
reference the black is obviously
probably<00:07:28.630> the<00:07:28.720> hardest<00:07:29.020> color<00:07:29.230> to<00:07:29.440> work<00:07:29.590> on<00:07:29.860> so

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:30.160 
probably the hardest color to work on so

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:31.560 
probably the hardest color to work on so
that's<00:07:30.340> why<00:07:30.490> I<00:07:30.520> want<00:07:30.760> to<00:07:30.850> show<00:07:31.000> this<00:07:31.210> as<00:07:31.450> an

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:31.570 
that's why I want to show this as an

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:34.320 
that's why I want to show this as an
example<00:07:31.840> and<00:07:32.260> here's<00:07:33.190> a<00:07:33.250> typical<00:07:33.550> color<00:07:34.030> this

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:34.330 
example and here's a typical color this

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:38.910 
example and here's a typical color this
is<00:07:34.540> probably<00:07:36.630> 80%<00:07:37.630> of<00:07:38.170> the<00:07:38.230> colors<00:07:38.620> out<00:07:38.860> there

00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:38.920 
is probably 80% of the colors out there

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:41.790 
is probably 80% of the colors out there
and<00:07:39.400> the<00:07:39.850> states<00:07:40.120> anyway<00:07:40.480> or<00:07:40.930> this<00:07:41.380> type<00:07:41.770> of

00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:41.800 
and the states anyway or this type of

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:45.750 
and the states anyway or this type of
color<00:07:42.220> and<00:07:43.740> it's<00:07:44.740> definitely<00:07:45.310> a<00:07:45.370> little<00:07:45.460> more

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:45.760 
color and it's definitely a little more

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:49.050 
color and it's definitely a little more
forgiving<00:07:46.530> but<00:07:47.530> as<00:07:48.340> you<00:07:48.520> can<00:07:48.700> see<00:07:48.940> the

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:49.060 
forgiving but as you can see the

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:51.200 
forgiving but as you can see the
snakeskin<00:07:49.480> is<00:07:49.780> also<00:07:50.169> go

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:51.210 
snakeskin is also go

00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:55.310 
snakeskin is also go
on<00:07:51.270> in<00:07:51.509> our<00:07:51.660> repair<00:07:52.050> area<00:07:52.470> here<00:07:53.900> and<00:07:54.900> you<00:07:55.199> can

00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:55.320 
on in our repair area here and you can

00:07:55.320 --> 00:08:03.499 
on in our repair area here and you can
see<00:07:55.530> from<00:07:55.710> that<00:07:55.889> level<00:08:00.740> so<00:08:01.740> the<00:08:02.490> coroner<00:08:03.270> will

00:08:03.499 --> 00:08:03.509 
see from that level so the coroner will

00:08:03.509 --> 00:08:06.770 
see from that level so the coroner will
definitely<00:08:03.960> take<00:08:04.169> it<00:08:04.320> from<00:08:04.500> here
