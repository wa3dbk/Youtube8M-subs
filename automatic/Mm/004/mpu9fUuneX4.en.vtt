clothes<00:02:58.560> disturbances<00:02:59.280> in<00:02:59.519> the<00:03:00.530> iron-on

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
clothes disturbances in the iron-on

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.920 
clothes disturbances in the iron-on
transfers<00:03:02.220> and<00:03:02.819> so<00:03:03.120> then<00:03:03.329> I'm<00:03:03.450> just<00:03:03.480> trying<00:03:03.900> to

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930

put them based on my marks in the
approximate<00:03:06.689> locations<00:03:07.170> if<00:03:07.409> your<00:03:07.560> marks<00:03:07.799> are

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
approximate locations if your marks are

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.259 
approximate locations if your marks are
a<00:03:07.980> little<00:03:08.129> off<00:03:08.370> you<00:03:08.640> can<00:03:08.790> adjust<00:03:09.180> that

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
a little off you can adjust that

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:12.410 
a little off you can adjust that
obviously<00:03:09.930> oh<00:03:10.230> and<00:03:10.799> also<00:03:11.010> we<00:03:11.730> erase<00:03:12.000> the<00:03:12.180> marks

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
obviously oh and also we erase the marks

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.000 
obviously oh and also we erase the marks
before<00:03:12.750> you<00:03:12.840> do<00:03:12.959> this<00:03:13.079> because<00:03:13.139> I<00:03:13.530> didn't<00:03:13.859> and

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
before you do this because I didn't and

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.740 
before you do this because I didn't and
you<00:03:14.069> can<00:03:14.250> kind<00:03:14.579> of<00:03:14.670> see<00:03:14.879> it<00:03:14.939> a<00:03:15.000> little<00:03:15.180> I<00:03:15.450> mean

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
you can kind of see it a little I mean

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.080 
you can kind of see it a little I mean
it's<00:03:16.019> not<00:03:16.170> that<00:03:16.409> noticeable<00:03:16.560> but<00:03:17.099> if<00:03:17.909> you

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
it's not that noticeable but if you

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:19.849 
it's not that noticeable but if you
don't<00:03:18.239> want<00:03:18.420> it<00:03:18.480> to<00:03:18.569> be<00:03:18.659> visible<00:03:18.900> oh<00:03:19.319> I<00:03:19.709> would

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:19.859 
don't want it to be visible oh I would

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:21.740 
don't want it to be visible oh I would
race<00:03:20.069> them<00:03:20.340> and<00:03:21.000> then<00:03:21.209> you're<00:03:21.359> just<00:03:21.450> going<00:03:21.720> to

race them and then you're just going to

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.449 
race them and then you're just going to
iron<00:03:22.019> them<00:03:22.319> and<00:03:22.590> since<00:03:22.769> they're<00:03:22.950> smaller

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
iron them and since they're smaller

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.460 
iron them and since they're smaller

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.399 
would happen and then you're just going
to<00:03:41.159> pull<00:03:41.700> off<00:03:41.939> the<00:03:42.120> design<00:03:42.389> now<00:03:42.689> this<00:03:42.930> took<00:03:43.169> way

00:03:43.399 --> 00:03:43.409 
to pull off the design now this took way

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:45.379 
to pull off the design now this took way
longer<00:03:43.439> than<00:03:43.889> it<00:03:44.250> looks<00:03:44.639> it<00:03:44.819> was<00:03:44.970> not<00:03:45.209> that

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:45.389 
longer than it looks it was not that

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:47.929 
longer than it looks it was not that
easy<00:03:45.540> it<00:03:46.439> probably<00:03:46.799> took<00:03:46.889> me<00:03:47.099> like<00:03:47.459> two<00:03:47.819> or

00:03:47.929 --> 00:03:47.939 
easy it probably took me like two or

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:49.490 
easy it probably took me like two or
three<00:03:48.000> minutes<00:03:48.299> to<00:03:48.599> figure<00:03:48.959> out<00:03:49.049> how<00:03:49.199> to<00:03:49.260> pull

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
three minutes to figure out how to pull

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:50.930 
three minutes to figure out how to pull
off<00:03:49.530> because<00:03:50.010> I<00:03:50.250> was<00:03:50.370> afraid<00:03:50.489> that<00:03:50.669> I<00:03:50.819> would

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
off because I was afraid that I would

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.610 
off because I was afraid that I would
just<00:03:51.060> rip<00:03:51.239> the<00:03:51.359> whole<00:03:51.419> design<00:03:51.750> off<00:03:51.959> but<00:03:52.500> it's

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
just rip the whole design off but it's

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.189 
just rip the whole design off but it's
really<00:03:52.769> not<00:03:52.949> that<00:03:53.010> difficult<00:03:53.430> and<00:03:54.269> once<00:03:55.079> you

00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:55.199 
really not that difficult and once you

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:58.550 
really not that difficult and once you
pull<00:03:55.409> it<00:03:55.470> off<00:03:55.590> it's<00:03:55.919> awesome

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.030 

I'm<00:03:59.099> dangerous<00:04:00.000> like<00:04:00.300> Bao<00:04:00.630> Zhu<00:04:01.410> with<00:04:01.590> that<00:04:01.800> one

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
I'm dangerous like Bao Zhu with that one

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:02.690 
I'm dangerous like Bao Zhu with that one
shot

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
shot

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.000 
shot
hands<00:04:03.180> up<00:04:03.360> she<00:04:03.630> said<00:04:03.810> give<00:04:03.989> me<00:04:04.080> everything<00:04:04.560> and

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
hands up she said give me everything and

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:06.830 
hands up she said give me everything and
then<00:04:05.130> I<00:04:05.160> just<00:04:05.520> do<00:04:05.700> the<00:04:05.880> other<00:04:06.060> one<00:04:06.270> too<00:04:06.450> and<00:04:06.660> I'm

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
then I just do the other one too and I'm

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.600 
then I just do the other one too and I'm
almost<00:04:06.959> so<00:04:07.290> much<00:04:07.440> easier<00:04:07.800> kill<00:04:08.280> what<00:04:08.430> those

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 
almost so much easier kill what those

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:26.910 
almost so much easier kill what those
looks<00:04:08.910> play<00:04:09.300> those<00:04:09.540> attacks<00:04:10.050> yeah

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:26.920 

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.180 

if<00:04:27.640> you<00:04:27.820> are

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
if you are

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:33.100 
if you are
a<00:04:29.420> night<00:04:30.420> I<00:04:30.750> think<00:04:31.260> we

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
a night I think we

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.050 
a night I think we
let's<00:04:33.650> hold<00:04:34.010> tight

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
let's hold tight

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:46.700 
let's hold tight
I<00:04:43.700> gotta
