00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.170
 It has been wonderful and I want to go back but 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:03.600
 well at least I take many memories 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.280
 and that's what I 'm going to teach you so 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.840
 first of all as you will remember in the 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.520
 first video that I went up I had the 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.990
 opportunity to go to cannes cross and 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.150
 take a picture with the cart to 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.190
 hogwarts and from there I brought this picture 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.470
 framed in which I leave then with the 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:19.260

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.720

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.820

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.009
 you can take out and me is that I love 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.200
 the cups and I like to collect them 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.670
 that I have one more the next day 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.070
 as you will also have seen in the first 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.560
 video we went to see uy what idea and I 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.140
 suit this slushie glass is very 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.240
 cool and very nice so I already have a 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.190
 I remember also of wicked and happening already 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.380
 the big day you saw in the video 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.240
 previous in which we went to the studios 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.740
 harry potter I'll teach you everything 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.820
 that I brought myself from there in the first place 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.950
 just enter we got this sheet 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.990
 nothing goes free then towards the middle of 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.240
 there was a cafeteria and there it was 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.670
 where I took the butterbeer and well 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.590
 I brought my glass afterwards when the 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.170
 tour we went to the store and there in 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.330
 first place we picked up our photos and 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.280
 videos flying if you want to see the video 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.200
 complete where I go flying 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.420
 click here to the side and you can see it 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.360
 in the previous video the photo comes like this 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:17.540
 of chula opens and then there I am 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:20.360
 well, playing wii and that's wonderful 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:23.000
 and finally it is a great memory and I 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.410
 love and one more memory is still 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.040
 this is good 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:32.280
 It is a box and inside it is this 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.980
 pendrive in which the video is in the 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.380
 that I fly out is a memory 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.330
 great is that I have a video in the 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.970
 I'm flying on a broom for hogwarts 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.860
 that is enough then it is worth separately 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.830
 package that I had bought from the 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.840
 Studies includes digital and physical guidance 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:51.750
 so this is the physical life that I 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:54.090
 they gave account as secrets are the 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.430
 it's many details and such, so it's not 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.860
 that is the great thing but as I remember 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.830
 I love a lot and now I do the things that 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:04.560
 I bought a chocolate frog that day 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:06.390
 frog I've already eaten it but well I have 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:10.080
 here the chrome that is the gryffindor 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:12.600
 moves and just like in the movies and bone 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.490
 the frog was huge, that is, it was like 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.020
 something like a block of chocolate me 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:18.150
 it hurt the teeth when biting the 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.620
 four days later than eat my 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.060
 huge it was but good more than the 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.820
 real in itself what excites me was 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:26.130
 because the box is so chuli and the chroma 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:28.410
 and the same thing happens with dragee pills 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:30.480
 of all the flavors that if you buy 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:33.510
 do not ever probÃ©is of 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.190
 and everything is done is that favor because as 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.500
 you can see the package was by the 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.299
 half more or less the rich almost me 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.370
 I have eaten is very cool again 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:42.150
 just like the one in the movies like this has a 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.459
 I remember pretty 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.110
 then I bought this tour keychain 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:48.360
 time as you can see is a 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.640
 preciousness is very cool is very nice 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:54.440
 so one more memory that I take with me 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:57.840
 I also bought this lovely notebook 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:04:00.840
 jhornan of these super nice has this 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:03.299
 of metallized hogwarts and it's beautiful and 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:06.239
 I'm basically going to use it to talk 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:08.849
 a kind of not daily but as a place 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:12.299
 where where I'll write nice things 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:14.910
 let me pass or beautiful memories here 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:16.380
 I have the ticket for the trip to london the 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:18.299
 entry of wicked the entry of the 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.889
 studios here movie tickets by 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:22.919
 true that yesterday I went to see into the woods 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:24.240
 and wonderful I loved the following 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:26.520
 She is a great frikada who craved 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:29.130
 very much and it is this banner of 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:31.410
 ravenclaw is great that is to say it comes with its 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:33.740
 rope appointment to hang everything and it's 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:36.050
 wonderful and 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:38.870
 finally they gave us this bookmark 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:40.610
 of the studios so look at a 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:42.889
 thing more than michelle and the next day 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:44.479
 We went to the oxford street prime mark and 

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:47.120
 taking advantage that it was all super cheap 

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:49.669
 I bought this sweatshirt from the United Kingdom 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:52.160
 which is good typical memory but the 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:54.949
 I wanted to, and then he did not even give me this 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:57.139
 raven club shirt makes me mad that I do not 

00:04:54.949 --> 00:04:58.789
 it's blue, it's ok, but it's very pretty and 

00:04:57.139 --> 00:05:02.000
 He also gave me this hat that or 

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:03.410
 be a pound the hat is worth mine and good 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.870

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:12.979
