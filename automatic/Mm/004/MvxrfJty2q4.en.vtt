00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:19.009
 hey people and welcome again 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.830
 to a new video yes I'm yours 

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:23.810
 dahlia and you are exactly right 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.029
 I chose the spring of 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:30.980
 hopefully I should come soon 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:32.719
 brought me the new icx 5.0 that fit 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:36.079
 Although not to this great 

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:41.180
 winter time yes it is icy cold us 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:44.680
 have the strongest ones ever since 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:46.969
 Hopefully spring will come again 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:50.329
 and of course we're all on it 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:51.649
 curious and what we need for it are 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:55.300
 Of course no more winter shoes 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:01:00.280
 but we need new loose 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:00.280
 comfortable roads 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:07.660
 great that his brand is in there can 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:10.420
 to make super advertising for nike no 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:11.140
 Of course , I have this typical one here 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.210
 carton 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.320
 then we want to go to school 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:18.240
 take a closer look 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:22.330
 So these are the two trinkets 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:25.690
 People are the new ones 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:28.570
 I have the color black gold because 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:30.070
 start set the color of the year 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.640
 for the shoes 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:35.640
 this is the nike free 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.640
 5.0 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:43.030
 That's the new design I do not know 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:45.810
 whether this is from 2014 will be 2015 respectively 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:49.800
 I really liked that and 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.800
 That's why I recorded it 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.009
 classic construction of the shoe but with 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.950
 new design 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:02:00.250
 So here we can already from 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:03.940
 where 3.0 to that here the sole 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:07.300
 almost here in this network many net 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:09.759
 runs jasid succeeded the 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:13.020
 Developers of nike in my opinion 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:16.020
 is a matter of taste but I like it 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:20.020
 Here you can also see this great 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:27.230
 matthews here you can see nike free 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:31.190
 50 these are now the 250 but one 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:33.920
 I can only quote another model 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:37.330
 say positive about the 3.0 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:41.810
 difference is simply that the 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:42.319
 3.0 the lower the number the stronger 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.970
 is 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:54.500
 this famous barefoot feeling barefoot 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:55.190
 feeling the higher the stronger the 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.709
 dampen 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:00.920
 it just does not feel right visa 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:03.799
 conventional hard hand one goes into the 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:07.060
 school clean and has the feeling than had 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:07.060
 my second sock 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:20.360
 Here, for example, we have again 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:21.660
 this green sole is the typical nike 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.910
 green 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.550
 we have her here this mesh of 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.680
 college holds this together 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:31.170
 whole material is a matter of taste 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.770
 of course we have such a honey 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:36.930
 honeycomb pattern it is very interesting 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:44.670
 but designed the just really so that 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:47.940
 pattern of honey or how it seems 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:51.470
 In any case, they are very very articulate 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:54.750
 Although not as articulate as the 3.0 but 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:57.420
 already very strong we articulate the 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:04.500
 very interesting course between the 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:08.100
 sole and the material and here runs 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:11.250
 that is really nice but it is 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:13.320
 really well done and me 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.670
 also think that they are well ventilated 

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:16.709
 as if there as pure looks 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:20.310
 you may not be here but here 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:21.620
 the air is coming through and none 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:24.199
 georgs 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:27.400
 as always in the middle was going and going 

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:29.960
 real with but they are definitely too 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:32.660
 very breathable 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:36.080
 Here you can see the big between 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:39.949
 white so that simply from the 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:42.860
 from the black basic materials 

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:46.790
 stands out here just the times 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:49.580
 the small on the inside the 5.0 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:53.000
 I have taken this because I have this 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:55.310
 dampen the movie 3.0 bit missing 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.449
 I have and therefore I am for 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:58.699
 this decided 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:05:01.820
 they are really not bad and me 

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:03.199
 she'll be right there at the same time 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:06.139
 next sunshine if he 

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:09.650
 hopefully comes try on otherwise 

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:11.510
 I actually succeeded very well 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:13.100
 Hope you like the video and 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:15.260
