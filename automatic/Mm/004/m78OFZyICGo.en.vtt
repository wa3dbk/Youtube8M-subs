00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
got the Emerald be for the b-team so

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.250 
got the Emerald be for the b-team so
yeah<00:00:47.640> here<00:00:47.850> we<00:00:47.910> go<00:00:48.469> windows<00:00:49.469> up<00:00:49.770> there<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:51.260> so

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
yeah here we go windows up there and so

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.830 
yeah here we go windows up there and so
yeah<00:00:52.410> pressure<00:00:52.829> plate<00:00:53.329> piston<00:00:54.329> doors<00:00:54.600> with

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
yeah pressure plate piston doors with

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.830 
yeah pressure plate piston doors with
glass<00:00:54.870> on<00:00:55.590> them<00:00:55.800> this<00:00:56.010> is<00:00:56.309> a<00:00:56.340> stained<00:00:56.969> white

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
glass on them this is a stained white

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.209 
glass on them this is a stained white
grey<00:00:58.230> glass<00:00:59.510> and<00:01:00.510> then<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.870> real<00:01:01.020> factory<00:01:01.590> now

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
grey glass and then the real factory now

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.670 
grey glass and then the real factory now
none<00:01:02.489> of<00:01:02.640> this<00:01:02.760> really<00:01:03.059> actually<00:01:03.719> functions<00:01:04.439> i

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
none of this really actually functions i

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.350 
none of this really actually functions i
just<00:01:04.890> made<00:01:05.129> it<00:01:05.250> for<00:01:05.489> aesthetic<00:01:06.119> purposes

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
just made it for aesthetic purposes

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.539 
just made it for aesthetic purposes
because<00:01:07.020> it<00:01:07.229> it<00:01:07.740> looks<00:01:07.979> good<00:01:08.479> i<00:01:09.479> think

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
because it it looks good i think

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.740 
because it it looks good i think
so<00:01:12.549> yeah<00:01:12.700> this<00:01:12.939> actually<00:01:13.330> doesn't<00:01:13.450> produce

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.750 
so yeah this actually doesn't produce

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:22.920 
so yeah this actually doesn't produce
anything<00:01:17.130> but<00:01:18.130> it<00:01:19.110> looks<00:01:20.110> cool<00:01:20.229> so<00:01:21.570> we<00:01:22.570> do<00:01:22.720> have

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:22.930 
anything but it looks cool so we do have

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.670 
anything but it looks cool so we do have
a<00:01:22.960> bat<00:01:23.170> box<00:01:23.470> though<00:01:23.740> that's<00:01:23.979> connected<00:01:24.490> to

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
a bat box though that's connected to

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.270 
a bat box though that's connected to
solar<00:01:26.680> panels<00:01:27.100> so<00:01:28.030> on<00:01:28.180> this<00:01:28.299> sort<00:01:28.570> of

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
solar panels so on this sort of

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.910 
solar panels so on this sort of
smokestack<00:01:30.280> ish<00:01:30.490> thing<00:01:31.200> are<00:01:32.200> some<00:01:32.619> solar

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 
smokestack ish thing are some solar

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:40.590 
smokestack ish thing are some solar
panels<00:01:34.830> that<00:01:35.830> does<00:01:36.130> function<00:01:36.640> but<00:01:39.600> basically

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
panels that does function but basically

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.300 
panels that does function but basically
only<00:01:40.810> the<00:01:40.960> power<00:01:41.140> sources<00:01:41.619> are<00:01:41.920> the<00:01:42.039> actual

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 
only the power sources are the actual

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.969 
only the power sources are the actual
things<00:01:42.610> running<00:01:42.909> this<00:01:43.210> and<00:01:43.659> the<00:01:44.319> minecart<00:01:44.860> up

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:44.979 
things running this and the minecart up

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:50.910 
things running this and the minecart up
here<00:01:45.960> you<00:01:46.960> know<00:01:47.080> loop<00:01:47.729> so<00:01:49.259> yeah<00:01:50.259> that's<00:01:50.560> all

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
here you know loop so yeah that's all

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.620 
here you know loop so yeah that's all
the<00:01:51.069> functions<00:01:51.580> there's<00:01:52.210> also<00:01:52.420> more<00:01:52.810> power<00:01:53.080> on

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
the functions there's also more power on

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.139 
the functions there's also more power on
the<00:01:55.630> other<00:01:55.780> side<00:01:56.080> of<00:01:56.110> the<00:01:56.319> factory<00:01:56.580> on<00:01:57.580> top<00:01:57.970> of

00:01:58.139 --> 00:01:58.149 
the other side of the factory on top of

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:01.350 
the other side of the factory on top of
here<00:01:58.390> there's<00:01:58.600> some<00:01:58.659> wind<00:01:59.100> mills<00:02:00.100> and<00:02:00.490> more

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 
here there's some wind mills and more

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.029 
here there's some wind mills and more
solar<00:02:01.630> panels<00:02:04.020> here's<00:02:05.020> the<00:02:05.110> roof<00:02:05.409> it's<00:02:05.709> just

00:02:06.029 --> 00:02:06.039 
solar panels here's the roof it's just

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:09.150 
solar panels here's the roof it's just
got<00:02:06.220> wire<00:02:06.459> over<00:02:06.880> it<00:02:06.940> kind<00:02:07.179> of<00:02:07.240> ugly<00:02:07.420> but<00:02:08.160> that's

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
got wire over it kind of ugly but that's

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.059 
got wire over it kind of ugly but that's
I<00:02:09.970> mean<00:02:10.869> I<00:02:10.929> guess<00:02:11.170> I<00:02:11.290> could<00:02:11.470> have<00:02:11.560> run<00:02:11.739> a<00:02:11.769> lot

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
I mean I guess I could have run a lot

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:15.890 
I mean I guess I could have run a lot
run<00:02:12.580> the<00:02:13.030> wire<00:02:13.239> through<00:02:13.380> the<00:02:14.380> factory<00:02:14.920> but

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
run the wire through the factory but

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:23.540 
run the wire through the factory but
whatever<00:02:16.900> so<00:02:17.549> yeah<00:02:20.070> then<00:02:21.070> if<00:02:21.940> you<00:02:22.239> enter<00:02:22.780> in

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
whatever so yeah then if you enter in

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.670 
whatever so yeah then if you enter in
obviously<00:02:24.030> the<00:02:24.150> factory<00:02:24.540> stuff<00:02:24.780> with<00:02:24.990> a<00:02:25.020> mass

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
obviously the factory stuff with a mass

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.800 
obviously the factory stuff with a mass
fabricator<00:02:25.950> of<00:02:26.670> course<00:02:27.320> down<00:02:28.320> here<00:02:29.450> is<00:02:30.450> kind

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
fabricator of course down here is kind

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.810 
fabricator of course down here is kind
of<00:02:30.870> like<00:02:31.020> a<00:02:31.080> little<00:02:31.470> almost<00:02:32.190> like<00:02:32.490> a<00:02:32.580> break

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
of like a little almost like a break

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.710 
of like a little almost like a break
room<00:02:33.060> sort<00:02:33.450> of<00:02:33.540> thing<00:02:33.750> I<00:02:34.050> imagine<00:02:35.480> drink<00:02:36.480> your

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
room sort of thing I imagine drink your

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:43.790 
room sort of thing I imagine drink your
coffee<00:02:39.410> now<00:02:40.410> let's<00:02:40.680> do<00:02:40.860> that<00:02:42.620> drink<00:02:43.620> some

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
coffee now let's do that drink some

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.580 
coffee now let's do that drink some
coffee<00:02:44.040> here

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.809 

well<00:02:47.590> I<00:02:47.970> should<00:02:48.970> give<00:02:49.450> you<00:02:49.480> speed<00:02:50.550> speed<00:02:51.550> boost

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:51.819 
well I should give you speed speed boost

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:53.750 
well I should give you speed speed boost
and<00:02:52.150> the<00:02:52.180> camera<00:02:52.720> will<00:02:52.750> be<00:02:53.019> weird<00:02:53.260> but<00:02:53.470> maybe

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
and the camera will be weird but maybe

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.690 
and the camera will be weird but maybe
maybe<00:02:54.760> at<00:02:55.000> the<00:02:55.150> end<00:02:55.180> anyway<00:02:56.050> so<00:02:56.110> we<00:02:56.410> got

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
maybe at the end anyway so we got

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:02.550 
maybe at the end anyway so we got
