00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:16.880
 and our dreams and hopes travel 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:20.030
 with you 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:26.380
 The sea â€‹â€‹is general and natural 

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:26.380
 as for them in a god 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.649
 and if a child dreamed of becoming 

00:00:36.359 --> 00:00:40.660
 something different from what society 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:44.489
 I had planned for him 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.489
 and if a guy is throwing something else 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:51.699
 my son was on the bus 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.269
 God what he made clear 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:02.860
 you are the answer to the question of whether 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:08.060
 we are alone in the universe 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:10.189
 saying that I am your son you are my son 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.560
 I have to believe that they sent you here 

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:14.770
 some reason and even if it takes the rest 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:19.469
 of your life 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.469
 you deserve to discover what that reason is 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.860
 how do you find someone who has 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:28.930
 spent his life erasing his trail 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.930
 for some it was a guardian angel 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:34.430
 for others a ghost that has never 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.200
 embedded 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:39.620
 you will be in the inhabitants of the earth 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:42.400
 an ideal to fight for 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:45.260
 they rush to continue they will stumble 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.270
 will fall 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:50.649
 but in the end 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.649
 if there was nobody in the sun 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:56.600
 in the end it will help them achieve great 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.600
 these 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:13.190
 you think your son is safe 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.190
 I will find 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.910
 and my father believed that if the world 

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:22.390
 will discover who I was 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:25.770
 would reject me I was convinced that 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.770
 the world was not ready 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:36.450
 the killing slice is not a s in me 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:39.819
 world means hope because here is 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:44.430
 a s what do you think 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:44.430
 he forgives 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.400
 ah
