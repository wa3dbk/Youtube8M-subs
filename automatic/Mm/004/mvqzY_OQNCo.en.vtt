00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
so it's beyond Gotham I heard it's

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.700 
so it's beyond Gotham I heard it's
actually<00:01:35.800> not<00:01:36.310> an<00:01:36.520> open<00:01:36.940> world<00:01:37.120> game<00:01:37.450> which<00:01:38.380> I

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
actually not an open world game which I

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:40.860 
actually not an open world game which I
find<00:01:39.130> to<00:01:39.490> be<00:01:39.610> the<00:01:39.790> most<00:01:40.030> disappointing<00:01:40.690> part

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:40.870 
find to be the most disappointing part

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:44.520 
find to be the most disappointing part
of<00:01:41.200> this<00:01:41.320> new<00:01:41.530> game<00:01:41.770> um<00:01:42.600> I<00:01:43.600> admit<00:01:44.350> it's

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
of this new game um I admit it's

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.110 
of this new game um I admit it's
actually<00:01:44.860> kind<00:01:45.040> of<00:01:45.100> hard<00:01:45.340> to<00:01:45.460> put<00:01:45.760> an<00:01:45.940> open

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:46.120 
actually kind of hard to put an open

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.850 
actually kind of hard to put an open
world<00:01:46.480> game<00:01:46.780> when<00:01:47.110> you're<00:01:47.230> going<00:01:47.560> out<00:01:47.650> into

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
for the game but they decided not to

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:13.950 
for the game but they decided not to
because<00:02:12.810> you<00:02:13.810> know

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960 
because you know
