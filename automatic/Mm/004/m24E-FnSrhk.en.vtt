00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
things to come you know not saying that

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.209 
things to come you know not saying that
we<00:00:57.989> wanted<00:00:58.320> to<00:00:58.379> write<00:00:58.530> those<00:00:58.680> records<00:00:59.039> again

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
we wanted to write those records again

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.740 
we wanted to write those records again
because<00:00:59.399> we<00:00:59.430> did<00:00:59.670> we<00:00:59.969> can't<00:01:00.239> write<00:01:00.570> those

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
because we did we can't write those

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.900 
because we did we can't write those
records<00:01:01.079> again<00:01:01.260> we're<00:01:01.440> ten<00:01:02.399> years<00:01:02.579> older<00:01:02.820> than

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
records again we're ten years older than

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.520 
records again we're ten years older than
one<00:01:03.030> word<00:01:03.149> about<00:01:03.239> those<00:01:03.480> records<00:01:03.840> says<00:01:04.110> days

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
one word about those records says days

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.820 
one word about those records says days
are<00:01:04.739> long<00:01:04.890> gone<00:01:04.920> you<00:01:05.430> don't<00:01:05.580> mean<00:01:05.869> but<00:01:06.869> I<00:01:07.530> think

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
are long gone you don't mean but I think

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.320 
are long gone you don't mean but I think
that<00:01:07.979> that<00:01:08.010> we're<00:01:08.490> still<00:01:08.670> capable<00:01:08.880> of<00:01:09.180> that

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
that that we're still capable of that

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.840 
that that we're still capable of that
style<00:01:09.630> and<00:01:10.020> i<00:01:10.710> think<00:01:10.950> that<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.220> right<00:01:11.400> this

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
style and i think that the right this

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.410 
style and i think that the right this
new<00:01:12.030> record<00:01:12.330> is<00:01:12.390> like<00:01:12.450> a<00:01:12.510> progression<00:01:12.960> of<00:01:14.420> what

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
new record is like a progression of what

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.999 
new record is like a progression of what
my<00:01:15.570> veins<00:01:15.780> been<00:01:15.990> doing<00:01:16.290> for<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.590> last<00:01:16.680> 10

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
my veins been doing for the last 10

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.609 
my veins been doing for the last 10
years<00:01:17.040> and<00:01:17.689> but<00:01:18.689> i<00:01:18.720> think<00:01:18.990> that<00:01:19.020> there<00:01:19.259> is<00:01:19.290> that

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
years and but i think that there is that

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.410 
years and but i think that there is that
kind<00:01:19.799> of<00:01:19.920> retro<00:01:20.340> kind<00:01:20.759> of<00:01:20.820> elements<00:01:21.210> on<00:01:21.299> the

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
kind of retro kind of elements on the

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.730 
kind of retro kind of elements on the
signatures<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:22.020> some<00:01:22.170> of<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.290> parts<00:01:22.619> and

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
signatures and some of the parts and

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.490 
signatures and some of the parts and
some<00:01:22.890> of<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.009> heaviness<00:01:23.250> i<00:01:24.259> think<00:01:25.259> we<00:01:25.320> kind<00:01:25.470> of

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
some of the heaviness i think we kind of

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.980 
some of the heaviness i think we kind of
got<00:01:25.590> back<00:01:25.770> to<00:01:25.860> that<00:01:26.150> chad<00:01:27.150> and<00:01:27.330> guitarist<00:01:27.750> greg
