hopefully you'll notice about the

hopefully you'll notice about the
Broadway<00:01:12.200> limited<00:01:12.350> switchers<00:01:12.890> is<00:01:13.040> that

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 
Broadway limited switchers is that

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:14.500 
Broadway limited switchers is that
you're<00:01:13.400> running<00:01:13.520> out<00:01:13.790> as<00:01:13.940> a<00:01:14.030> road<00:01:14.270> engine

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:14.510 
you're running out as a road engine

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.230 
you're running out as a road engine
they're<00:01:15.260> a<00:01:15.290> lot<00:01:15.530> slower<00:01:15.920> than<00:01:16.220> our<00:01:16.340> main<00:01:17.030> road

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
they're a lot slower than our main road

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.000 
they're a lot slower than our main road
diesels<00:01:17.690> and<00:01:17.870> the<00:01:18.110> reason<00:01:18.440> for<00:01:18.590> that<00:01:18.650> is<00:01:18.979> that

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.010 
diesels and the reason for that is that

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:21.160 
diesels and the reason for that is that
most<00:01:19.460> of<00:01:19.610> the<00:01:19.700> switchers<00:01:20.119> really<00:01:20.630> only<00:01:20.900> went

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
most of the switchers really only went

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.200 
most of the switchers really only went
45<00:01:21.890> 50<00:01:22.250> miles<00:01:22.400> an<00:01:22.580> hour<00:01:22.640> maybe<00:01:22.970> a<00:01:23.060> little

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
45 50 miles an hour maybe a little

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.440 
45 50 miles an hour maybe a little
faster<00:01:23.479> with<00:01:23.840> the<00:01:23.960> flexible<00:01:24.440> trucks<00:01:24.850> and<00:01:25.850> so

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
faster with the flexible trucks and so

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.290 
faster with the flexible trucks and so
we<00:01:26.660> gear<00:01:27.080> our<00:01:27.110> switchers<00:01:27.740> lower<00:01:28.160> one<00:01:28.820> so<00:01:29.119> that

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:29.300 
we gear our switchers lower one so that

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.600 
we gear our switchers lower one so that
the<00:01:29.450> speed<00:01:30.380> is<00:01:30.560> closer<00:01:30.830> to<00:01:30.979> the<00:01:31.220> prototypical

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
the speed is closer to the prototypical

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.090 
the speed is closer to the prototypical
speed<00:01:32.090> and<00:01:32.360> two<00:01:32.750> it<00:01:32.900> makes<00:01:33.080> it<00:01:33.320> a<00:01:33.590> lot<00:01:34.040> better

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
speed and two it makes it a lot better

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.760 
speed and two it makes it a lot better
for<00:01:34.700> close-in<00:01:34.970> switching<00:01:35.720> and<00:01:35.869> this<00:01:36.380> switcher

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
for close-in switching and this switcher

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.420 
for close-in switching and this switcher
I've<00:01:36.890> got<00:01:37.100> here<00:01:37.780> if<00:01:38.780> you<00:01:39.020> run<00:01:39.170> in<00:01:39.380> DCC<00:01:39.920> and<00:01:40.160> you

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
I've got here if you run in DCC and you

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.359 
I've got here if you run in DCC and you
just<00:01:40.640> cycle<00:01:41.000> it<00:01:41.090> between<00:01:41.920> speed<00:01:42.920> step<00:01:43.130> zero

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369 
just cycle it between speed step zero

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:45.700 
just cycle it between speed step zero
and<00:01:43.580> speed<00:01:43.820> step<00:01:44.090> one<00:01:44.390> or<00:01:44.509> two<00:01:44.660> you<00:01:45.229> can<00:01:45.380> stop

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
and speed step one or two you can stop

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.410 
and speed step one or two you can stop
the<00:01:45.950> thing<00:01:46.160> I<00:01:46.190> always<00:01:46.399> say<00:01:46.520> stop<00:01:46.880> on<00:01:47.060> a<00:01:47.090> dime<00:01:47.180> I

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
the thing I always say stop on a dime I

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.600 
the thing I always say stop on a dime I
think<00:01:47.780> I<00:01:47.840> can<00:01:47.990> stop<00:01:48.200> this<00:01:48.410> 20<00:01:48.740> or<00:01:48.830> 30<00:01:48.979> times<00:01:49.039> in

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
think I can stop this 20 or 30 times in

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.200 
think I can stop this 20 or 30 times in
the<00:01:49.700> width<00:01:49.880> of<00:01:50.000> a<00:01:50.090> dime<00:01:50.320> and<00:01:51.640> it's<00:01:52.640> really<00:01:53.030> nice

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
the width of a dime and it's really nice

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.570 
the width of a dime and it's really nice
for<00:01:53.570> switching<00:01:53.869> you<00:01:54.830> watch<00:01:55.039> this<00:01:55.250> thing<00:01:55.310> I'll

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:55.580 
for switching you watch this thing I'll

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.010 
for switching you watch this thing I'll
pull<00:01:55.789> it<00:01:55.820> in<00:01:56.030> go<00:01:56.860> stop<00:01:57.860> go<00:01:58.310> stop<00:01:58.940> go<00:01:59.180> stop<00:01:59.600> you

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
pull it in go stop go stop go stop you

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.960 
pull it in go stop go stop go stop you
know<00:02:00.110> just<00:02:00.410> just<00:02:00.560> stop<00:02:01.009> wherever<00:02:01.399> you<00:02:01.580> want<00:02:01.820> it

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970 
know just just stop wherever you want it

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:03.820 
know just just stop wherever you want it

and so it's really nice if you're trying
to<00:02:05.410> pull<00:02:06.410> it<00:02:06.530> in<00:02:06.649> couple<00:02:06.920> with<00:02:07.009> a<00:02:07.039> freight<00:02:07.910> car

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
to pull it in couple with a freight car

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:15.050 
to pull it in couple with a freight car
can<00:02:08.750> you<00:02:08.810> stop<00:02:09.110> it<00:02:10.690> right<00:02:11.690> there

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:44.130 

really<00:02:15.750> great<00:02:15.930> for<00:02:15.960> switching

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.960 

a<00:02:44.170> lot<00:02:44.740> of<00:02:44.770> switchers<00:02:45.160> came<00:02:45.400> with<00:02:45.550> a<00:02:45.580> single

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
a lot of switchers came with a single

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.700 
a lot of switchers came with a single
chime<00:02:46.180> horn<00:02:46.570> and<00:02:48.900> remodel<00:02:49.900> ours<00:02:50.050> mostly<00:02:50.560> with

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:50.710 
chime horn and remodel ours mostly with

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:55.380 
chime horn and remodel ours mostly with
their<00:02:51.160> standard<00:02:51.670> horn<00:02:51.910> and<00:02:52.150> you'll<00:02:52.510> hear<00:02:52.720> it<00:02:54.390> a

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
their standard horn and you'll hear it a

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.600 
their standard horn and you'll hear it a
lot<00:02:56.170> of<00:02:56.230> people<00:02:56.350> don't<00:02:56.560> like<00:02:56.680> that<00:02:56.950> sound<00:02:57.250> and

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
lot of people don't like that sound and

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.430 
lot of people don't like that sound and
so<00:02:57.700> a<00:02:57.730> good<00:02:57.940> project<00:02:58.540> that<00:02:58.660> people<00:02:58.930> can<00:02:59.080> do<00:02:59.260> is

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
so a good project that people can do is

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.090 
so a good project that people can do is
you<00:02:59.590> go<00:03:00.240> buy<00:03:01.240> an<00:03:01.420> aftermarket<00:03:01.830> set<00:03:02.830> of<00:03:02.920> brass

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
you go buy an aftermarket set of brass

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.130 
you go buy an aftermarket set of brass
horns<00:03:03.550> in<00:03:03.700> three<00:03:04.060> or<00:03:04.180> five<00:03:04.390> chime<00:03:04.720> mount<00:03:04.990> them

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
horns in three or five chime mount them

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.740 
horns in three or five chime mount them
up<00:03:05.170> on<00:03:05.350> the<00:03:05.470> roof<00:03:05.760> most<00:03:06.760> anybody<00:03:07.180> can<00:03:07.390> do<00:03:07.540> that

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
up on the roof most anybody can do that

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.590 
up on the roof most anybody can do that
