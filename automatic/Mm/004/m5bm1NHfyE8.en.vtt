 me 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:31.480
 Using that semiconductor laser 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:31.820
 Semiconductor laser as a white against it you get the blue light it to the phosphor of yellow head 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:36.890
 Of the lamp 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:38.990
 What is the highest output is the basic idea only laser headlamps 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:45.320
 Yes 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:46.370
 Now let's deliver that as a lamp for research and development to visit that Simdrive 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:50.270
 Gotten to 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:52.630

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.630
 Yes 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:01:02.780
 Sim Drive is a venture from Keio University to jointly develop electric vehicles with various companies 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:08.659
 going 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:12.200
 Stanley Electric was responsible for laser headlamps at 35 companies 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:17.359
 Led to a room near the pet and led 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:22.090
 After going to the camp in the form of a hybrid type of laser headlamp 

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:32.020
 High beam pants that have ever configured toreno ledo 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:32.020
 Well in that musical is the state can run on public roads in some of you have public satisfaction Yes 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:58.790
 It becomes Boo Boo cooperation form 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:02:04.030
 It's safe to say that it's safe to join a maker, and then it's about that time of the designer 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:04.030
 It is also in the form of increased freedom about the net lamp 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:24.140
 Boo Boo nice d Next Satie 2nd This is Tidardin overall performance heart cost 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.260
 talked 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:31.050
 That accumulate in the Wu place 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.000
 We heard from the car maker is 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.380
 me 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.440
 That's right I haven't got an answering story yet 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.440
 ee
