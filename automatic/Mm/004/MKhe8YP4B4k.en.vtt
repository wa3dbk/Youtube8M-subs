00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:05.470
 this is a pigeon pigeon 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.280
 columba livia 

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:13.410
 let's watch a little so 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:16.290
 people can understand what the crop is 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:19.650
 this fight is fought and in this 

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:23.369
 case is a full crop full of 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.770
 little seeds there all seeds 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.590
 I did barely find it is to put a 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:32.730
 bunch of little seeds to see if he ate 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:36.450
 alone in this case ate alone 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:40.170
 question facilitates a lot the 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:42.060
 feeding if you do not eat here 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.750
 we have one 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:50.970
 tuberculin syringe will beat the 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:55.940
 small chest where I cut the peak 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:58.090
 I put seeds and loading this is 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:02.880
 syringe 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:02.880
 I give it to eat so let's see pigeon 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:10.430
 he immobilized him with his hand with these two 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:13.390
 fingers opens the beak and in the 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:16.460
 food there is 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:20.450
 Very good 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:23.770
 the ideal thing in a pigeon is not to advance what 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:28.509
 do not caress him a lot or let's say 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:31.040
 contain him shelter him give him food water 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:33.650
 but not being all the time giving it 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.979
 kisses kisses kisses if you want it 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:38.960
 release now if one says good this 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:41.060
 pigeon I keep it because it will be 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:45.290
 better with me because you do not have a come 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:49.340
 wing because it broke the paw is half 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:55.039
 followed then I keep it and the meek 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:58.460
 If not, it's ideal if you live alone trying 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:02:02.840
 of being independent next to 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:05.330
 our release document that is 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.780
 we can give them then there they go to 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:13.239
 to be able to guide the steps to follow 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:13.239
 to release it in an ideal place and not 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.680
 lets go see it 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:23.110
 as you see this is the crop 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.360
 this is a pigeon that you want all the 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:31.030
 time and that is barbarous because it says no 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.850
 no no no no humans, no humans 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:37.750
 not to see yes 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:41.820
 if they grab me in Cordoba with this new 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.820
 idea that we are 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:51.260
 carenciados good food for kids 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.260
 this is the much 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:59.340
 and it is the full crop 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:02.570
 good with good luck and good luck to 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.570
 those who are watching us
