the<00:00:29.670> alien<00:00:30.000> I<00:00:30.119> think<00:00:30.330> it's<00:00:30.420> absolutely

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
the alien I think it's absolutely

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.659 
the alien I think it's absolutely
essential<00:00:31.019> and<00:00:31.529> it<00:00:31.949> has<00:00:32.070> been<00:00:32.189> like<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.520> very

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
essential and it has been like the very

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:33.950 
essential and it has been like the very
beginning<00:00:33.000> that<00:00:33.149> you<00:00:33.180> could<00:00:33.390> walk<00:00:33.510> on<00:00:33.660> English

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
beginning that you could walk on English

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.660 
beginning that you could walk on English
and<00:00:34.140> ceilings<00:00:34.500> in<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.739> geometry<00:00:34.950> the

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
and ceilings in the geometry the

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.639 
and ceilings in the geometry the
landscape<00:00:36.180> becomes<00:00:36.540> very<00:00:36.930> much<00:00:37.140> part<00:00:37.410> of<00:00:37.559> the

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
landscape becomes very much part of the

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.590 
landscape becomes very much part of the
game<00:00:37.800> play<00:00:38.070> for<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.489> alien<00:00:38.760> player<00:00:39.030> as<00:00:39.420> it

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
game play for the alien player as it

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.209 
game play for the alien player as it
wasn't<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.960> original<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.800> predator

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
wasn't the original the predator

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.500 
wasn't the original the predator
obviously<00:00:41.700> we're<00:00:41.850> trying<00:00:42.030> to<00:00:42.180> recapture

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
obviously we're trying to recapture

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.750 
obviously we're trying to recapture
going<00:00:43.050> back<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.500> original<00:00:44.040> movies<00:00:44.430> trying

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
going back to the original movies trying

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.850 
going back to the original movies trying
to<00:00:44.820> recapture<00:00:45.090> what<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.690> predator<00:00:46.050> does<00:00:46.230> with

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
to recapture what the predator does with

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.470 
to recapture what the predator does with
a<00:00:46.890> way<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.219> predator<00:00:47.610> maneuvers<00:00:48.180> around<00:00:48.270> the

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
a way the predator maneuvers around the

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.630 
a way the predator maneuvers around the
landscape<00:00:48.750> which<00:00:49.350> is<00:00:49.530> also<00:00:49.710> quite<00:00:50.070> exciting

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
landscape which is also quite exciting

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.189 
landscape which is also quite exciting
and<00:00:51.059> of<00:00:51.180> course<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.449> Marines<00:00:51.719> got<00:00:52.050> to<00:00:52.140> be

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
and of course the Marines got to be

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.110 
and of course the Marines got to be
great<00:00:52.410> there<00:00:52.620> are<00:00:52.680> some<00:00:52.800> brilliant<00:00:53.309> shooters

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
great there are some brilliant shooters

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.000 
great there are some brilliant shooters
out<00:00:54.300> there<00:00:54.360> that<00:00:54.840> quite<00:00:55.110> frankly<00:00:55.140> riff<00:00:55.770> off

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
out there that quite frankly riff off

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.639 
out there that quite frankly riff off
the<00:00:56.370> Marines<00:00:57.059> in<00:00:57.360> fact<00:00:57.570> probably<00:00:58.020> most<00:00:58.410> of

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
the Marines in fact probably most of

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.860 
the Marines in fact probably most of
them<00:00:58.800> rip<00:00:59.010> off<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.399> original<00:00:59.609> movie<00:01:00.270> so<00:01:00.690> we've

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
them rip off the original movie so we've

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.360 
them rip off the original movie so we've
got<00:01:00.989> to<00:01:01.079> go<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.199> little<00:01:01.440> bit<00:01:01.649> further<00:01:01.800> with<00:01:02.160> that

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
got to go a little bit further with that

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.670 
got to go a little bit further with that
as<00:01:02.520> well<00:01:02.550> let's<00:01:03.239> face<00:01:03.420> it<00:01:03.660> that<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.199> predator

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
as well let's face it that the predator

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.560 
as well let's face it that the predator
really<00:01:05.070> is<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.339> big<00:01:05.489> guy<00:01:05.670> he's<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.210> one<00:01:06.390> with

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
really is the big guy he's the one with

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
attitude and the scale the Marines kind

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.670 
attitude and the scale the Marines kind
of<00:01:11.909> stuck<00:01:12.119> in<00:01:12.150> a<00:01:12.299> hard<00:01:12.450> place<00:01:12.659> and<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.320> alien

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
of stuck in a hard place and the alien

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.910 
of stuck in a hard place and the alien
itself<00:01:14.040> is<00:01:14.280> kind<00:01:14.549> of<00:01:15.170> not<00:01:16.170> a<00:01:16.229> mindless<00:01:16.590> killer

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
itself is kind of not a mindless killer

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.800 
itself is kind of not a mindless killer
but<00:01:17.189> it<00:01:17.310> you<00:01:17.430> know<00:01:17.549> is<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:18.000> weapon<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.479> aliens

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
but it you know is the weapon the aliens

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.840 
but it you know is the weapon the aliens
the<00:01:19.259> weapon<00:01:19.560> itself<00:01:19.650> so<00:01:20.189> going<00:01:20.460> back<00:01:20.580> to<00:01:20.640> the

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
the weapon itself so going back to the

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.340 
the weapon itself so going back to the
days<00:01:21.000> of<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.240> original<00:01:21.630> what<00:01:21.750> we<00:01:21.869> tried<00:01:22.080> to<00:01:22.110> do

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
days of the original what we tried to do

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.749 
days of the original what we tried to do
is<00:01:22.470> make<00:01:22.680> it<00:01:22.710> so<00:01:23.070> that<00:01:23.220> in<00:01:23.400> example

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
is make it so that in example

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.510 
is make it so that in example
multiplayer<00:01:24.590> players<00:01:25.590> could<00:01:25.890> score<00:01:26.250> things

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
multiplayer players could score things

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.010 
multiplayer players could score things
the<00:01:26.700> way<00:01:26.820> they<00:01:26.970> wanted<00:01:27.299> to<00:01:27.479> and<00:01:27.810> that's

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
the way they wanted to and that's

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.390 
the way they wanted to and that's
something<00:01:28.259> I<00:01:28.439> think<00:01:28.500> is<00:01:28.710> really<00:01:28.979> important

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
something I think is really important

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.090 
something I think is really important
that<00:01:29.610> we<00:01:29.759> try<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:30.270> recapture<00:01:30.780> so<00:01:31.409> that<00:01:31.710> each

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
that we try to recapture so that each

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.130 
that we try to recapture so that each
are<00:01:32.520> kind<00:01:33.210> of<00:01:33.240> building<00:01:33.659> on<00:01:33.810> their<00:01:33.990> own

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
are kind of building on their own

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.920 
are kind of building on their own
strengths<00:01:34.770> and<00:01:34.799> hopefully<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:36.329> how<00:01:36.450> kind<00:01:36.869> of

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
strengths and hopefully the how kind of

tuation<00:01:41.190> we've<00:01:41.880> obviously<00:01:41.970> watched<00:01:42.330> the

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:42.480 
tuation we've obviously watched the

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.149 
tuation we've obviously watched the
movies<00:01:42.780> many<00:01:42.990> times<00:01:43.260> we<00:01:43.530> continue<00:01:43.890> to<00:01:44.010> watch

other<00:01:46.350> things<00:01:46.500> I<00:01:47.010> think<00:01:47.310> going<00:01:47.640> back<00:01:47.820> to<00:01:48.030> that

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
other things I think going back to that

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.150 
other things I think going back to that
base<00:01:48.390> material<00:01:48.990> is<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.470> best<00:01:49.620> way<00:01:49.800> of<00:01:49.830> doing

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:50.160 
base material is the best way of doing

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:51.200 
base material is the best way of doing
it<00:01:50.280> some<00:01:50.490> of<00:01:50.580> the<00:01:50.640> more<00:01:50.760> modern<00:01:50.880> movies
