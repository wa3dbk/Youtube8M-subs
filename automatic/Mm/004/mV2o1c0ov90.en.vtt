00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:08.200
 make the driver a good job but there 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:11.049
 driving such important vehicles 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:13.080
 also requires great responsibility and 

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:15.219
 here at the safe driving center in misano 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.980
 we can train the drivers ad 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:19.480
 tackle dangerous situations to 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.789
 grow like this to them 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:24.210
 professionalism and their safety of 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:24.210
 travel 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:38.420
 it's on the road that you drive 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:42.100
 performs at the eco drive in and thanks courses 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:44.990
 also ad huff and the last euro 6 xf105 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.910
 you truckers can become i 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:48.770
 protagonists in safety in 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.250
 consumption reduction and respect 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.250
 environment 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.239
 it takes to get a result 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:02.340
 three components an efficient means one 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.540
 training and of course the part 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.540
 the driver is important 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.079
 we did the training in the classroom but 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:15.479
 now it's up to you drivers 

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:17.520
 protagonists on the road adapt the 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.770
 guide to the new media that from faeces puts to 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.990
 arrangement check tools 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.789
 adjust your guide to get 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.649
 the maximum result 

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:29.060
 an efficient guide an ecological guide 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:29.060
 but also safe driving 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.520
 behind me the evidence track what is the 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.020
 test track an equipped yard where 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.670
 in complete safety 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.950
 we can simulate situations of 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.869
 emergency and take action 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.979
 manual skills on the steering wheel understand the dynamics 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:46.369
 of the vehicle 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:47.869
 in a nutshell drive safer one 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:48.820
 of the exercises we do during 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:51.020
 our safe driving courses 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.659
 and the exercise we call the 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.280
 rotate what you need to make us understand 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:57.049
 how close is a limit of 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.909
 rollover of our vehicles 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:00.560
 as you can see is throughout 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:02.390
 tranquility there is a little wheel that 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.590
 prevents tipping but allows 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.229
 the driver to bring his own 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.360
 vehicle over the tipping limit 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:10.030
 important driving position 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.140
 steering precision is important 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.060
 important to understand through mirrors 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:17.350
 when it's time to straighten out 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:19.640
 slightly to prevent tipping over 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.410
 let's start now with the exercise of 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.780
 braking a simulation of one 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:26.720
 daily situation that allows us to 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:29.120
 learn the correct use of the brake e 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:33.010
 of the steering 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.010
 a few meters ahead 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:41.110
 a sudden obstacle with this 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.860
 exercise we learn the right and technique 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.860
 to avoid it 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:04.719
 transport and ecology traffic e 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.730
 environment can and must cohabit for 

00:03:04.719 --> 00:03:10.000
 this we have the best at our disposal 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.810
 instrument technological innovation and the 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.420
 training 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.430
 thank you for watching this 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.439
 short video and give you the appointment in 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:20.370
 one of da ecodriving courses 

00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:20.370
 see you later 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.700
 well
