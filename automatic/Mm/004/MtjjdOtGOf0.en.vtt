00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:16.580
 I can not promise that they 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.580

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:35.660

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:45.250

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:54.390
 First spot I'll find 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:56.290
 is curl up for the first question 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.260

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:01.899
 make do I want it very important that 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.970
 many motivation speakers and successes 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:05.259
 books is always that one that 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:05.920
 successful people sleep little that 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:08.470
 is just nonsense 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:11.680
 Sleep is extremely important to sleep 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:13.330
 Removed waste products in the brain 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.840
 if he does not do that, he'll wake up 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:18.490
 long term extremely ill i have a lot 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.039
 Little currently slept by university 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.450
 in the first year of independence 

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:24.759
 and really try this one now 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.610
 year to sleep regularly 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:28.720
 Just give me times where I can see clearly 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.880
 less per night may sleep yet 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.740
 46 hours or the whole always tries 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.149
 catch up again 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.179
 seven to eight already in the long run 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:38.530
 you want to be productive then you have to 

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:40.600
 really look that we lower 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.119
 Sleep times you have that long enough 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.920
 sleep that is just as important that 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:47.380
 Training then of course for the job 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.240
 for everything that enough sleep me this 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.899
 very good book on martin luther 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.899
 business class 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.300
 Next question is how is the perfect marco 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.800
 Of course, a question does not leave 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.790
 flat rate answer I think you can 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.160
 say it's the perfect one 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.750
 market sharing given a specific 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.190
 situation so for me the perfect 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:22.240
 Brand division so take it for everyone 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:25.030
 not every day much works often 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:27.370
 always somehow trains to 150 in 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.320
 he has to be the head of the foundry 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.640
 wireless field perfect huge selection 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:33.130
 second food 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.080
 you always have enough energy 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.000
 in the morning at the job center for the family 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.860
 or friends and poor to training and 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.900
 through the low fat factor for through 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.250
 still very heavy calories 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.810
 Exclude even if the calories 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.280
 not one perfect marco breakdown 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.870
 For me, for example, it would only be 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.670
 between 50 and 80 grams of fat 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.390
 Body size, of course, 18 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:54.520
 body weight protein and the rest with 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:56.950
 Quartz fill up as many cards still 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:59.290
 a court next rossi the interesting 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.540
 why is he always in such a good mood ? 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.890
 simple answer just as 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.019
 independent too many things do not 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.780
 that means I would say 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:10.720
 you 're about to go easy things too 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.100
 laugh because so much is wrong 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.750
 First, I'm someone's out 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.489
 very good to laugh at yourself 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.840
 and it's extremely important that you look at yourself 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:18.970
 really focused on the moment 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.620
 I still have a lot of activities today 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.640
 but you do not influence what I do 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.739
 right now if you look at yourself 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.570
 really trying to hide everything 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:28.329
 just to enjoy what you are watching 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:29.860
 then it can be done once 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:31.480
 Next thing I ask a lot of war 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.940
 Questions about studying 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:36.250
 what should I study at which 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.079
 university and such go firstly 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.390
 I would quickly as much as 

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:42.489
 possible to try out relatively young 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.630
 as many internships as many jobs like him 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:45.489
 because it is always very 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:47.260
 easy to find what you do not like 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:48.910
 Of course that limits the time off for 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.989
 that may already be one 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.610
 or maybe you will find 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:53.320
 also directly first what a very good 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.710
 Feld really does not try everything 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:56.480
 possible to do everything possible 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:58.010
 a good university from always so im 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.990
 everything actually does not matter 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:01.400
 if you are a great guy and somehow 

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:03.110
 is different from each other but is 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.280
 just often do not meet and just 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:06.350
 this formalie that of my good 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.120
 University studies helps you around 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:10.220
 painted try losverfahren does not want 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.960
 a good abi have tried studying 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.400
 already tried record tests 

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:15.170
 tried on abroad 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.910
 private universities here for example 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:19.640
 funded or through a student job 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:21.530
 little churches changes questions i 

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:24.110
 I'm late with the cookbook 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:28.360
 does philipp you hear people on the 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:28.360
 channel to date no one locked 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:34.970
 he just uses it in the 

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:36.350
 I have a small look at the description 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.010
 cinema made for the things the 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:40.040
 frequently asked 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:41.570
 I want to have it instead 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.080
 I really really long again 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:43.390
 worked 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.260
 At some point he came that night 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:47.450
 describes already fell asleep 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:49.100
 you have such an idea so far 

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:50.870
 to reduce your problems described 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:52.610
 The muscles could build up something 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.990
 he should eat so enteuter ezb sitting 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:55.010
 I always like it when you are mine 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:57.680
 do not write that you have problems 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:59.090
 but after a certain time what 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.710
 her success lady is like 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:02.330
 Follow me in the video clip 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:04.250
 A maximum of 10 to 15 seconds is best 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:07.490
 in the landscape engine I can directly contact them 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:08.660
 hang in front of the video and tell in it 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:11.210
 me following I just start with 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:13.370
 yeast then puts you shortly before his 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:16.010
 if you want to know where it comes from 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:17.600
 and then just what we are 

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:19.880
 has reached for example water in 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:21.680
 on the topic of muscle building it may be that 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.970
 they very proud decreased to rad 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.740
 have that after your graduation 

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:26.360
 have done that in uni conclusion 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:27.650
 made her travel somewhere 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.990
 be three things it is very important to me 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:31.070
 First, because of clip secondly 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:32.360
 that you really notice that they are 

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:34.130
 incredibly proud of their achievements 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:36.050
 be and thirdly that they really 

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:37.130
 it's easy to fight the positive 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:40.280
 let's see if you really have a thing 

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:41.300
 then with a laugh in the face makes 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:42.740
 it can be much easier 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:44.000
 make the goal of it is that simple 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:45.980
 I think that way too often the 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.120
 things that can not make the 

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:49.540
 foreground, the things that make you 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.540
 has reached 

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:52.880
 lena i could be easy in the year or in 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:55.790
 two 

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:57.020
 Submitted the video and got on 

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:59.120
 on youtube and you can just 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:00.290
 pull up if anything 

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:02.810
 does not work the video then sends 

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:05.240

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:14.450
 then i can help you in the team for the 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:16.160
 answer next week is today 

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:19.340
 friday that means we only see video 

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:21.560
 What friday is a bit that is 

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:24.800
 tomorrow is the video tomorrow 

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:27.200
 from yesterday is a special video and 

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:28.610
 The day after tomorrow I come to prep video 

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:30.800
 am really looking forward it if you 

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:32.870
 want to meet with me then bought one 

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.890
 bit of bulgur can be alternative 

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:35.180
 probably also use couscous 

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:38.240
 I just want to force you to do that 

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:40.780
 more sources more different 

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:43.340
 Food tried in yours 

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:45.380

 means my legs in the hand 

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:53.480
 After that, take the video for you 

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:57.280
 then upload it into the team 

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:57.280
 and then it's finally called
