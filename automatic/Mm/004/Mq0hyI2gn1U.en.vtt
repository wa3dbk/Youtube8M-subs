00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:03.040
 Hello 

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:04.650
 Shinichi Horii 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.970
 It is ancient lotus 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:09.970
 Urgent company performance 

00:00:10.949 --> 00:00:13.949
 I hope you pray here and the universe is good 

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:17.249
 To Suzu wave return home 

00:00:17.249 --> 00:00:20.669
 I'm going to be nervous before the partnership 

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:23.939
 Yes I did some research 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.669
 Other than this 

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:28.890
 It's up to here 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.119
 The time to make it bigger now 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:34.430
 It is also possible to play 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:35.960
 Well for this too 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.300
 As a British sill 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.300
 The right hand is important 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:45.530
 If sound fly away 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.530
 3g 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.000

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.680
 Let's go home 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.870
 Remarks When you got married 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.870
 ja This is the difference between effects and effects 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.910
 In this case it's a bit difficult 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.630
 The movie is going high 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.020
 In this way I was told at a stretch, but more than five schools 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.070
 Is it 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.130
 It's hard to get over here 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.270
 How is it lost? 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.100
 Ema: It has always been a dream, but it's low to break into here. 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.170
 Defeat deco 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.530
 Landlord k 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.880
 Yamakuni is hard to come out 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.560
 because edius 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.820
 Come every box as a pro 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.820
 One stamp 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:41.700
 If this happens again 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.910
 I will extend 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:46.150
 Well a little 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.100
 Lord of Enjo 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.300
 Because in the pipe 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.310
 Lol 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.330
 If anything platinum 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.840
 I feel like I'm advantageous 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.180
 But because there is this revision 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.670
 It is only that it is selling by the situation of democracy 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:03.660
 is 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.340
 I do not want to be Kiso wide area 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.519
 Here was the former 

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:09.789
 I guess 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:11.439
 This is 

00:02:11.439 --> 00:02:13.089
 I can't wait for a while 

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:15.389
 A little collection as ecb 

00:02:15.389 --> 00:02:16.809
 Hard to reach 

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:17.909
 Well dressed up 

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:20.909
 It will be 

00:02:21.609 --> 00:02:24.499
 I'm trying to keep track of heritage 

00:02:24.499 --> 00:02:27.499
 Even after being calm in some cases 

00:02:29.499 --> 00:02:30.939
 * 7 

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:34.360
 I don't like sailing in the city of loneliness 

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:40.070
 It's the best for 22 countries 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:41.399
 Just a little bit 

00:02:41.399 --> 00:02:43.760
 m2 is also quite 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.439
 Actually it is so 

00:02:45.439 --> 00:02:46.910
 I came here even if it was freezing 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.479
 Because this man engineer can not be taken 

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:52.079
 Advance to return to Manakana or a little 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:53.139
 It is good, is not it 

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:56.249
 It is a pattern not done while taking a pipe 

00:02:56.249 --> 00:02:59.549
 The starring was said to be accompanied by Kodai Fukui Takai 

00:03:00.139 --> 00:03:03.260
 Well this is also a little bit crazy 

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:07.809
 I'm talking in Japan 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:09.999
 If widely 

00:03:09.999 --> 00:03:11.909
 If there is a difference to here a little 

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:14.909
 Name book and this is a test 

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:18.759
 Limited to this 

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:21.759
 There is also resistance 

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:25.849
 Right arm that strikes out with a little bit of macro 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:28.849
 Yes this will do the best with this 

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:32.049
 I'm sure I'm back 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:35.200
 I hope that you will get a deposit when you throw it 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:38.649
 But it may be high 

00:03:38.649 --> 00:03:41.109
 While having a good reputation in English 

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:44.109
 It means that it will fight the US 

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:48.919
 It is various in doctor on the morning of 2nd 

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:51.919
 Ema 

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:55.839
 I haven't seen this, but it has grown 

00:03:56.419 --> 00:04:00.919
 It's a heartwarming experience to use it all from one building to another 

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:01.959
 not to mention 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:05.709
 f. Because it is a man to be hit because it is when selling a little 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:08.169
 This will also be horse racing 

00:04:08.169 --> 00:04:11.569
 There is a castle like this 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:13.089
 Again here 

00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:16.089
 Well like this 

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:19.969
 Maconnay 

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:22.969
 It is dolphins 

00:04:27.279 --> 00:04:29.189
 Excavated 

00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:31.000
 It's okay here 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.580
 No lessons learned 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:34.979
 Denuclearization 

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:37.340
 It is Katsura town Totsuka here though 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:39.139
 US movie 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:42.139
 It is one of the castle ruins of glory 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:46.960
 There are various changes, though 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.050
 Also the performance of a British company 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.979
 Yeah ago 

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:54.370
 If you study in various ways 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:56.969
 There are some interesting points 

00:04:56.969 --> 00:04:58.460
 Still 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:01.460
 Yes, because it contains difficult changes 

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:08.370
 I want to put in my research 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:09.680
 Thank you very much
