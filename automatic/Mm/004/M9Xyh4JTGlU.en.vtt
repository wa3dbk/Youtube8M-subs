to<00:00:15.240> provide<00:00:15.630> your<00:00:15.809> system<00:00:16.199> with<00:00:16.320> more<00:00:16.529> USB

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
to provide your system with more USB

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.170 
to provide your system with more USB
ports<00:00:17.460> this<00:00:18.150> is<00:00:18.330> a<00:00:18.359> USB<00:00:18.810> 3<00:00:19.080> header<00:00:19.289> cable<00:00:19.770> and

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:20.180 
ports this is a USB 3 header cable and

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.509 
ports this is a USB 3 header cable and
behind<00:00:21.180> it<00:00:21.330> we<00:00:21.480> see<00:00:21.689> a<00:00:21.720> USB<00:00:22.410> 2<00:00:22.710> header<00:00:23.039> cable

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
behind it we see a USB 2 header cable

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.320 
behind it we see a USB 2 header cable
which<00:00:24.390> is<00:00:24.539> now<00:00:24.689> coming<00:00:24.930> into<00:00:25.199> view<00:00:26.150> the<00:00:27.150> header

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
which is now coming into view the header

of<00:00:37.829> them<00:00:37.950> are<00:00:38.100> keyed<00:00:39.110> let's<00:00:40.110> take<00:00:40.260> a<00:00:40.290> closer

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
of them are keyed let's take a closer

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.990 
of them are keyed let's take a closer
look<00:00:40.829> now<00:00:40.890> at<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.399> USB<00:00:41.940> 2<00:00:42.629> cable<00:00:43.140> and<00:00:43.879> at<00:00:44.879> the

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
look now at the USB 2 cable and at the

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.459 
look now at the USB 2 cable and at the
header<00:00:45.239> that<00:00:45.480> plugs<00:00:45.719> into<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:45.989> motherboard

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
header that plugs into the motherboard

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.950 
header that plugs into the motherboard
you<00:00:47.219> can<00:00:47.370> see<00:00:47.579> here<00:00:47.820> that<00:00:47.940> it's<00:00:48.120> keyed<00:00:48.450> by

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
you can see here that it's keyed by

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.689 
you can see here that it's keyed by
having<00:00:49.289> some<00:00:49.440> of<00:00:49.469> its<00:00:49.680> holes<00:00:49.920> plugged<00:00:50.690> and<00:00:52.699> now

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
having some of its holes plugged and now

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:54.770 
having some of its holes plugged and now
we're<00:00:53.820> going<00:00:53.910> to<00:00:54.030> go<00:00:54.120> down<00:00:54.239> and<00:00:54.420> take<00:00:54.480> a<00:00:54.539> closer

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
we're going to go down and take a closer

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.750 
we're going to go down and take a closer
look<00:00:55.020> at<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.260> USB<00:00:55.649> 3<00:00:55.920> header<00:00:56.100> cable<00:00:56.930> and<00:00:58.609> as<00:00:59.609> we

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
look at the USB 3 header cable and as we

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.880 
look at the USB 3 header cable and as we
zoom<00:00:59.940> in<00:01:00.300> on<00:01:00.390> it<00:01:00.449> we<00:01:00.809> can<00:01:00.960> see<00:01:01.199> that<00:01:01.230> it's<00:01:01.530> keyed

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
zoom in on it we can see that it's keyed

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.420 
zoom in on it we can see that it's keyed
by<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.550> use<00:01:02.850> of<00:01:03.320> a<00:01:04.320> tongue<00:01:04.589> which<00:01:04.830> corresponds

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
by the use of a tongue which corresponds

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.160 
by the use of a tongue which corresponds
to<00:01:05.489> a<00:01:05.610> cutout<00:01:07.040> here's<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.220> USB<00:01:08.700> 3<00:01:09.330> header<00:01:09.900> on

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
to a cutout here's the USB 3 header on

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.090 
to a cutout here's the USB 3 header on
the<00:01:10.200> motherboard<00:01:10.700> and<00:01:12.560> as<00:01:13.560> we<00:01:13.680> zoom<00:01:13.710> in<00:01:13.950> on<00:01:14.040> the

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
the motherboard and as we zoom in on the

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.580 
the motherboard and as we zoom in on the
motherboard<00:01:14.340> again<00:01:14.840> we're<00:01:15.840> now<00:01:15.960> going<00:01:16.229> to<00:01:16.350> see

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
motherboard again we're now going to see

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:17.990 
motherboard again we're now going to see
that<00:01:16.710> we're<00:01:16.860> going<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.130> put<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.460> bracket

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
that we're going to put the bracket

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.429 
that we're going to put the bracket
right<00:01:18.150> here<00:01:20.570> here<00:01:21.570> we're<00:01:21.750> installing<00:01:22.140> the

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
right here here we're installing the

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.190 
right here here we're installing the
bracket<00:01:22.650> we're<00:01:23.490> first<00:01:23.670> of<00:01:23.820> all<00:01:23.939> removing<00:01:24.509> the

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
bracket we're first of all removing the

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.160 
bracket we're first of all removing the
blank<00:01:26.189> card<00:01:26.460> bracket<00:01:27.030> with<00:01:27.450> our<00:01:27.600> screw<00:01:27.869> driver

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
blank card bracket with our screw driver

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.620 
blank card bracket with our screw driver
and<00:01:28.470> we're<00:01:29.400> going<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:29.549> spin<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:29.970> screw<00:01:30.240> out<00:01:30.420> by

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
and we're going to spin the screw out by

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.749 
and we're going to spin the screw out by
hand<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.740> avoid<00:01:31.950> dropping<00:01:32.220> it<00:01:32.490> into<00:01:32.670> the

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
hand to avoid dropping it into the

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:38.600 
hand to avoid dropping it into the
motherboard<00:01:36.650> ok<00:01:37.650> now<00:01:37.829> that<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.100> bracket<00:01:38.490> is

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
motherboard ok now that the bracket is

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.990 
motherboard ok now that the bracket is
gone<00:01:38.939> we<00:01:39.840> can<00:01:39.990> now<00:01:40.170> slide<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:41.310> new<00:01:41.460> bracket<00:01:41.729> in

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
gone we can now slide the new bracket in

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.639 
gone we can now slide the new bracket in
from<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.329> top<00:01:42.509> of<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:42.780> system<00:01:43.170> as<00:01:43.320> we<00:01:43.619> see

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
from the top of the system as we see

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.990 
from the top of the system as we see
here<00:01:44.630> and<00:01:46.280> then<00:01:47.280> we'll<00:01:47.430> push<00:01:47.670> it<00:01:47.820> through

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
here and then we'll push it through

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.139 
here and then we'll push it through
until<00:01:48.630> it<00:01:48.810> snaps<00:01:49.530> into<00:01:49.829> place<00:01:49.920> as<00:01:50.960> we<00:01:51.960> have<00:01:52.110> now

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:53.149 
until it snaps into place as we have now

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:56.090 
until it snaps into place as we have now
next<00:01:54.149> we<00:01:54.420> attach<00:01:54.600> a<00:01:54.960> screw<00:01:55.259> you<00:01:55.560> might<00:01:55.740> find<00:01:55.920> it

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
next we attach a screw you might find it

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.340 
next we attach a screw you might find it
easier<00:01:56.189> to<00:01:56.700> put<00:01:57.210> in<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:57.390> screw<00:01:57.659> partly<00:01:58.229> by

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
easier to put in the screw partly by

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.709 
easier to put in the screw partly by
hand<00:01:59.149> so<00:02:00.149> it<00:02:00.210> doesn't<00:02:00.420> fall<00:02:00.509> out<00:02:00.570> your

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
hand so it doesn't fall out your

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.719 
hand so it doesn't fall out your
screwdriver<00:02:01.110> and<00:02:01.380> so<00:02:02.189> here<00:02:02.340> we're<00:02:02.460> putting<00:02:02.579> it

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
screwdriver and so here we're putting it

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.149 
screwdriver and so here we're putting it
in<00:02:02.850> by<00:02:03.000> hand<00:02:03.530> we're<00:02:04.530> going<00:02:04.649> to<00:02:04.740> put<00:02:04.860> it<00:02:04.950> in<00:02:05.009> by

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
in by hand we're going to put it in by

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.210 
in by hand we're going to put it in by
hand<00:02:05.460> and<00:02:06.000> spin<00:02:06.360> it<00:02:06.540> till<00:02:07.140> it's<00:02:07.409> finger<00:02:08.009> tight

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
hand and spin it till it's finger tight

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.390 
hand and spin it till it's finger tight
and<00:02:09.200> then<00:02:10.200> we<00:02:10.349> will<00:02:10.500> finish<00:02:10.649> the<00:02:10.860> job<00:02:10.890> with<00:02:11.280> our

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
and then we will finish the job with our

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.630 
and then we will finish the job with our
screwdriver

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
screwdriver

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.010 
screwdriver
and<00:02:13.470> so<00:02:14.470> now<00:02:14.650> we're<00:02:14.800> using<00:02:14.920> a<00:02:15.130> screwdriver<00:02:15.490> to

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
and so now we're using a screwdriver to

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.610 
and so now we're using a screwdriver to
finish<00:02:17.020> tightening<00:02:17.230> the<00:02:17.500> bracket<00:02:17.830> into<00:02:17.950> place

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
finish tightening the bracket into place

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.960 
finish tightening the bracket into place
we're<00:02:20.620> putting<00:02:21.010> it<00:02:21.100> right<00:02:21.130> by<00:02:21.310> the<00:02:21.370> video<00:02:21.550> card

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
we're putting it right by the video card

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.190 
we're putting it right by the video card
because<00:02:22.930> there's<00:02:23.110> very<00:02:23.260> little<00:02:23.350> space<00:02:23.530> there

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
because there's very little space there

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.390 
because there's very little space there
now<00:02:26.200> that<00:02:26.320> we've<00:02:26.470> completed<00:02:26.620> that<00:02:27.040> it's<00:02:27.250> time

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
now that we've completed that it's time

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.640 
now that we've completed that it's time
to<00:02:27.520> plug<00:02:27.670> the<00:02:27.760> header<00:02:27.910> cable<00:02:28.330> in<00:02:28.480> so<00:02:29.410> here<00:02:29.560> we

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
to plug the header cable in so here we

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.980 
to plug the header cable in so here we
have<00:02:29.800> our<00:02:29.980> header<00:02:30.550> cable<00:02:30.970> and<00:02:31.150> we're<00:02:31.660> plugging

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:31.990 
have our header cable and we're plugging

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:35.160 
have our header cable and we're plugging
it<00:02:32.140> in<00:02:32.290> to<00:02:32.890> the<00:02:33.010> keyed<00:02:33.310> USB<00:02:34.150> 3<00:02:34.480> port<00:02:34.810> on<00:02:35.050> the

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
it in to the keyed USB 3 port on the

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.300 
it in to the keyed USB 3 port on the
motherboard<00:02:37.560> and<00:02:38.560> let's<00:02:38.890> take<00:02:39.010> a<00:02:39.040> look<00:02:39.250> at

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
motherboard and let's take a look at

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.790 
motherboard and let's take a look at
that<00:02:39.400> again<00:02:39.459> as<00:02:39.940> we<00:02:40.060> zoom<00:02:40.090> back<00:02:40.500> so<00:02:41.500> here's<00:02:41.680> our

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
that again as we zoom back so here's our

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.250 
that again as we zoom back so here's our
cable<00:02:42.220> we're<00:02:43.090> going<00:02:43.240> to<00:02:43.300> line<00:02:43.480> it<00:02:43.510> up<00:02:43.720> with<00:02:43.780> the

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
cable we're going to line it up with the

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.560 
cable we're going to line it up with the
cutout<00:02:45.040> to<00:02:45.850> match<00:02:46.030> the<00:02:46.180> tongue<00:02:46.360> on<00:02:46.480> the

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
cutout to match the tongue on the

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:49.199 
cutout to match the tongue on the
connector<00:02:47.430> stuck<00:02:48.430> in<00:02:48.550> a<00:02:48.580> groove<00:02:48.760> connection

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
connector stuck in a groove connection

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:52.229 
connector stuck in a groove connection
and<00:02:49.390> we<00:02:50.380> push<00:02:50.620> it<00:02:50.739> into<00:02:50.860> place<00:02:51.040> and<00:02:51.459> that

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
and we push it into place and that

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:55.830 
and we push it into place and that
completes<00:02:52.600> our<00:02:52.690> installation<00:02:53.020> process
