00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
gonna just fold it this way in half and

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.830 
gonna just fold it this way in half and
fold<00:00:09.420> this<00:00:09.570> line<00:00:09.980> over<00:00:10.980> here<00:00:11.099> into<00:00:11.969> this<00:00:12.599> line

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
fold this line over here into this line

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:23.890 
fold this line over here into this line
here<00:00:16.369> it's<00:00:17.369> not<00:00:17.550> overly<00:00:17.940> difficult

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:23.900 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.930 

and<00:00:24.590> fold<00:00:24.890> back<00:00:25.070> the<00:00:25.190> other<00:00:25.370> way<00:00:25.400> just<00:00:25.730> to<00:00:25.790> make

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:25.940 
and fold back the other way just to make

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.260 
and fold back the other way just to make
sure<00:00:25.970> that<00:00:26.210> it's<00:00:26.360> nicely<00:00:27.140> folded<00:00:27.970> and<00:00:28.970> you

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:29.270 
sure that it's nicely folded and you

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:42.390 
sure that it's nicely folded and you
have<00:00:29.390> to<00:00:29.480> do<00:00:29.600> it<00:00:29.660> the<00:00:29.720> other<00:00:29.840> side<00:00:31.420> excuse<00:00:32.420> me

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:42.400 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.150 

there<00:00:43.400> ya<00:00:43.610> go<00:00:43.910> but<00:00:44.510> more<00:00:45.440> folded<00:00:45.829> in<00:00:46.100> the

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:46.160 
there ya go but more folded in the

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.580 
there ya go but more folded in the
middle<00:00:46.489> there<00:00:46.670> and<00:00:47.050> just<00:00:48.050> to<00:00:48.110> illustrate<00:00:48.230> this

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:48.590 
middle there and just to illustrate this

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.880 
middle there and just to illustrate this
next<00:00:48.890> part<00:00:49.070> I'm<00:00:49.309> just<00:00:49.370> gonna<00:00:49.640> use<00:00:49.790> a<00:00:49.820> pin

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:50.890 
next part I'm just gonna use a pin

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.020 
next part I'm just gonna use a pin
you're<00:00:51.890> gonna<00:00:52.040> have<00:00:52.129> to<00:00:52.220> make<00:00:52.370> a<00:00:52.400> fold<00:00:52.730> that

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
you're gonna have to make a fold that

00:00:53.030 --> 00:01:01.090 
you're gonna have to make a fold that
goes<00:00:53.870> over<00:00:55.390> along<00:00:56.390> these<00:00:56.540> lines<00:00:59.949> so<00:01:00.949> you're

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
goes over along these lines so you're

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.340 
goes over along these lines so you're
gonna<00:01:01.190> have<00:01:01.340> to<00:01:01.370> fold<00:01:01.640> along<00:01:01.910> those<00:01:02.090> lines<00:01:02.390> so

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 
gonna have to fold along those lines so

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.229 
gonna have to fold along those lines so
I<00:01:03.650> find<00:01:03.980> the<00:01:04.070> best<00:01:04.160> way<00:01:04.339> to<00:01:04.369> do<00:01:04.550> it<00:01:04.670> is<00:01:04.820> to<00:01:05.059> sort

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:05.239 
I find the best way to do it is to sort

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:22.870 
I find the best way to do it is to sort
of<00:01:05.330> pinch<00:01:05.660> it<00:01:05.810> like<00:01:08.500> that

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.810 

like<00:01:23.450> that<00:01:23.659> inside<00:01:24.409> sort<00:01:24.799> of<00:01:24.860> a<00:01:25.070> little<00:01:25.490> square

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
like that inside sort of a little square

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.640 
like that inside sort of a little square
in<00:01:25.850> the<00:01:26.000> middle<00:01:26.030> there<00:01:26.360> and<00:01:26.570> you'll<00:01:27.380> see<00:01:27.500> it's

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:27.650 
in the middle there and you'll see it's

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:28.840 
in the middle there and you'll see it's
not<00:01:27.799> popped<00:01:28.130> down<00:01:28.280> like<00:01:28.460> that

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
not popped down like that

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.300 
not popped down like that
and<00:01:29.659> if<00:01:29.780> you<00:01:29.869> fold<00:01:30.080> it<00:01:30.320> properly<00:01:30.590> you<00:01:31.100> should

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
and if you fold it properly you should

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.180 
and if you fold it properly you should
easily<00:01:31.610> be<00:01:31.759> able<00:01:31.909> to<00:01:32.119> just<00:01:32.890> crunch<00:01:33.890> it<00:01:34.009> into

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:34.190 
easily be able to just crunch it into

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.719 
easily be able to just crunch it into
something<00:01:34.369> like<00:01:34.460> that<00:01:36.340> if<00:01:37.340> you<00:01:37.460> missed<00:01:37.670> that

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:37.729 
something like that if you missed that

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:40.359 
something like that if you missed that
another<00:01:38.270> way<00:01:38.450> to<00:01:38.509> do<00:01:38.720> it<00:01:38.750> is<00:01:38.930> to<00:01:39.380> hold<00:01:39.770> both

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369 
another way to do it is to hold both

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:42.100 
another way to do it is to hold both
sides<00:01:40.610> like<00:01:40.729> this<00:01:40.790> and<00:01:41.090> push<00:01:41.570> towards<00:01:41.750> the

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
sides like this and push towards the

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.899 
sides like this and push towards the
middle<00:01:42.320> and<00:01:43.990> push<00:01:44.990> this<00:01:45.200> middle<00:01:45.740> bit<00:01:45.830> down<00:01:46.130> and

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:46.909 
middle and push this middle bit down and

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:50.260 
middle and push this middle bit down and
she<00:01:47.060> just<00:01:47.210> pop<00:01:47.450> right<00:01:47.659> in<00:01:47.869> and<00:01:48.880> so<00:01:49.880> if<00:01:50.119> you

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
she just pop right in and so if you

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:51.490 
she just pop right in and so if you
follow<00:01:50.479> along<00:01:50.630> the<00:01:50.780> lines<00:01:50.960> that<00:01:51.110> we<00:01:51.289> made

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
follow along the lines that we made

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:52.050 
follow along the lines that we made
earlier

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
earlier

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.430 
earlier
she'll<00:01:53.060> be<00:01:53.149> able<00:01:53.210> to<00:01:53.330> do<00:01:53.390> it<00:01:53.509> and<00:01:53.690> if<00:01:54.140> you<00:01:54.259> fold

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:54.440 
she'll be able to do it and if you fold

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.279 
she'll be able to do it and if you fold
the<00:01:54.590> side<00:01:54.799> over<00:01:55.190> like<00:01:55.310> the<00:01:55.429> song<00:01:56.080> so<00:01:57.080> I<00:01:57.110> went

00:01:57.279 --> 00:01:57.289 
the side over like the song so I went

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:59.980 
the side over like the song so I went
from<00:01:57.380> there<00:01:57.590> to<00:01:57.619> there<00:01:57.770> and<00:01:58.569> this<00:01:59.569> little<00:01:59.810> flap

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
from there to there and this little flap

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.529 
from there to there and this little flap
should<00:02:00.170> just<00:02:00.289> pop<00:02:00.470> down<00:02:00.740> and<00:02:01.700> you'll<00:02:02.300> see<00:02:02.360> that

00:02:02.529 --> 00:02:02.539 
should just pop down and you'll see that

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:06.190 
should just pop down and you'll see that
little<00:02:02.780> square<00:02:03.520> and<00:02:04.630> now<00:02:05.630> if<00:02:05.750> you<00:02:05.869> pull<00:02:06.080> this

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
little square and now if you pull this

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.210 
little square and now if you pull this
back<00:02:06.259> but<00:02:06.649> around<00:02:08.769> you<00:02:09.769> just<00:02:09.890> have<00:02:10.039> something

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
back but around you just have something

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:16.580 
back but around you just have something
that<00:02:10.369> looks<00:02:10.550> like<00:02:10.610> this

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.519 

and<00:02:17.590> that<00:02:17.769> concludes<00:02:18.129> part<00:02:18.310> two
