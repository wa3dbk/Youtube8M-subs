00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 now wants to come back to a new one 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.919
 dress tutorial today I show you how 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.840
 you build an example and the data 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.670
 and short plan how to do such a few 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.219
 chips are created but we catch first 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.710
 at first we became like that somehow 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:23.130
 As gears you do with four sticks 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:27.689
 then you're gonna get the house will you do 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:29.400
 gold around the iron gold bank goldman 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.399
 four diamonds are pretty expensive though 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:36.120
 brown ready for the smp table of the brand 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:40.140
 diamond in here diamonds 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:42.420
 redstone and 3 and again three obsidian 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.760
 So we need six social ones 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.980
 once laser is just the more you 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.680
 the faster it works 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.260
 one has the energy but has as 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.750
 first one always do one so here two 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:59.370
 diamonds obsidian prevails over years and years 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:01.230
 then we still need five women 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.229
 I am here now 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:09.720
 a server engine just here 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:10.159
 cobblestone class slopes and tokyo and 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.280
 Seoul 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:17.180
 then we'll build something like that for myself 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.810
 have the good contacts here and golden 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:22.610
 Forget contact 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:27.150
 I introduce myself with a wooden fence 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:29.850
 a british transport toll I ask 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.079
 me here with klaas in the wood here now 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.450
 I know a bit of a fast one 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:36.479
 answer with me in it so normal 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.820
 wood boards just did and gold as well 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.329
 gold golden transport stays and here 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.759
 gold gold clear 

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:48.060
 let's start here we want 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:52.049
 times so strÃ¤ter and contacts then play 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.400
 the sterling engine then gold and then 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:58.740
 At the front 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:02:01.520
 the laser which lifting off whatever 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:04.680
 then we put the sm-title here 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:09.540
 Too far away was too close to doing here 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:12.240
 a little bucket is on bucket 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:14.610
 that might generate his electricity but it 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:17.370
 nothing happens as we see we do 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:20.700
 then here we go then we could do so 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.730
 make a redstone chip that needs it 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.730
 now 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:37.420
 so too much emmett brown we currently 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.459
 there are 500 in it 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:43.129
 and here we see how much she arrives 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:45.560
 theirs at the moment so that's just so 

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:47.420
 a spaceship now gold there 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.370
 we can change here if the bar 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:53.870
 is full then the chip is just like that 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:55.459
 besides, that way off the golden ones 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:58.549
 then we need chipsets for snacks 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:01.640
 tutorial where I show you how to get involved 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:04.610
 automatic warehouse with such water and 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:08.599
 build something and I hope I had total 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:11.450
 like how I build the sm-title 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:13.750
 say until the next tutorial of the 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.750
 vereins
