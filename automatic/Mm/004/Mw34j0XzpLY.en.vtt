 hard and avoid is possible if then 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:15.340
 so we go we started drawing shapes by 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.680

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:20.470

 fast this is a super fast video what 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.899
 accelerate because it took me almost six hours 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.100
 for the painting then I did what 

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:30.490
 accelerate so that in six minutes nothing 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:32.440
 more 69 to make it not so boring 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.820
 and you can see it fast not good what 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.039

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.360

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:39.399

 and much faster than the speedy 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.190
 gonzález I think he was left behind 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.789
 8 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.520
 speedy gonzález or aguas spas 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.490
 in white 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:38.520
 because i was in the westin grand force 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.520
 of production 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.400
 I do not pencil it this I did 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:50.050
 directly with the brush with the 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.450
 painting because I was really going to cover it 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:55.120
 all with the blue paint that I put on it and 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.160
 really, I still had to 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.019
 position the place had to see everything 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.850
 that was improvised because then there 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:03.250
 moments that you could move your image 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:05.110
 so then once drawn if already 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.370
 I had it then I would stay and there what 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.290
 you have to leave us then here I'll 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.390
 I was moving because I was creating in the 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.720
 moment this whole process not good then 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.720
 so we go 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.180
 they are light 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.580
 here we are putting the details 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:24.890
 the shadows the lights that the car has 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.210
 the way to give it dimension and that 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:28.370
 is the way it takes time and 

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:31.970
 all the little things that is not the same as 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:34.690

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:57.240
 asphalt road 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:59.280
 today it seems that it is descending from the 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:01.350
 sky that's a path that comes from 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:05.690
 heaven and is an angel that comes to the rescue 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:05.690
