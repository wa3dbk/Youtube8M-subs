00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:55.790 
top of the knife and only the edge is
polished<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:54.809> this<00:00:54.930> is<00:00:55.050> a<00:00:55.079> single<00:00:55.469> bevel

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
polished and this is a single bevel

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.979 
polished and this is a single bevel
knife<00:00:55.949> if<00:00:56.460> you<00:00:56.520> can<00:00:56.730> reverse<00:00:57.059> it<00:00:57.090> you'll<00:00:57.780> see

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
knife if you can reverse it you'll see

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.569 
knife if you can reverse it you'll see
it<00:00:58.109> it's<00:00:58.230> completely<00:00:58.379> polished<00:00:58.920> on<00:00:59.250> this<00:00:59.399> side

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
it it's completely polished on this side

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.189 
it it's completely polished on this side
so<00:00:59.730> it's<00:00:59.850> right<00:01:00.090> handle<00:01:00.480> single<00:01:00.870> bevel

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199

forged today is also as you can see a

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.510 
forged today is also as you can see a
single<00:01:18.090> bevel<00:01:18.540> and<00:01:19.320> it<00:01:19.619> also<00:01:19.830> has<00:01:20.900> that

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
single bevel and it also has that

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.910 
single bevel and it also has that
quality<00:01:23.520> where<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:24.000> back<00:01:24.210> is<00:01:24.689> soft<00:01:25.080> and<00:01:25.350> only

the<00:01:26.070> edge<00:01:26.220> is<00:01:26.960> hard<00:01:27.960> so<00:01:28.470> that<00:01:28.500> allows<00:01:29.130> the

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
the edge is hard so that allows the

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.940 
the edge is hard so that allows the
whole<00:01:29.579> blade<00:01:29.820> to<00:01:30.000> flex<00:01:30.270> and<00:01:30.479> yes<00:01:31.439> at<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.740> same

whole blade to flex and yes at the same

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.300 
whole blade to flex and yes at the same
time<00:01:32.189> you<00:01:32.659> have<00:01:33.659> a<00:01:33.689> very<00:01:33.990> hard<00:01:34.259> edge<00:01:34.950> which

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
time you have a very hard edge which

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.569 
time you have a very hard edge which
will<00:01:35.520> last<00:01:36.240> for<00:01:36.390> a<00:01:36.509> long<00:01:36.570> time<00:01:37.100> next<00:01:38.100> one<00:01:38.369> we

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
will last for a long time next one we

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.210 
will last for a long time next one we
have<00:01:38.610> a<00:01:39.270> large<00:01:40.100> cleaver

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220

well<00:01:41.820> it's<00:01:41.970> fairly<00:01:42.390> substantial<00:01:43.110> cleaver<00:01:43.350> as

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
well it's fairly substantial cleaver as

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.069 
well it's fairly substantial cleaver as
you<00:01:43.619> can<00:01:43.799> see<00:01:44.180> it's<00:01:45.180> pretty<00:01:45.509> thick<00:01:45.750> here<00:01:46.020> it

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
you can see it's pretty thick here it

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.810 
you can see it's pretty thick here it
was<00:01:46.259> forged<00:01:46.619> from<00:01:46.770> a<00:01:46.860> full<00:01:47.220> quarter<00:01:47.640> inch

the boning or paring knife basically I
took<00:02:16.050> this<00:02:16.440> triangle<00:02:17.190> wedge<00:02:17.490> shape<00:02:17.790> from<00:02:18.030> the

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
took this triangle wedge shape from the

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.710 
took this triangle wedge shape from the
classical<00:02:19.080> Japanese<00:02:19.590> debbye<00:02:20.400> knife<00:02:20.720> and

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
classical Japanese debbye knife and

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.260 
classical Japanese debbye knife and
debbye<00:02:22.020> is<00:02:22.440> a<00:02:22.470> very<00:02:23.160> thick<00:02:23.490> wedge-shaped

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
debbye is a very thick wedge-shaped

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.150 
debbye is a very thick wedge-shaped
knife<00:02:24.720> used<00:02:25.110> for<00:02:25.350> cutting<00:02:25.530> up<00:02:25.740> fish<00:02:25.980> or

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
knife used for cutting up fish or

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.180 
knife used for cutting up fish or
chicken<00:02:26.600> so<00:02:27.600> this<00:02:27.870> works<00:02:28.170> very<00:02:28.709> well<00:02:28.800> if<00:02:29.100> you

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
chicken so this works very well if you

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:30.970 
chicken so this works very well if you
want<00:02:29.400> to<00:02:29.520> cut<00:02:29.730> up<00:02:29.760> your<00:02:30.209> chicken<00:02:30.480> for<00:02:30.780> example

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
want to cut up your chicken for example

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.440 
want to cut up your chicken for example
because<00:02:31.980> usually<00:02:32.490> people<00:02:32.760> take<00:02:32.790> the<00:02:33.120> longest

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
because usually people take the longest

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.690 
because usually people take the longest
knife<00:02:33.660> they<00:02:33.870> have<00:02:34.080> and<00:02:34.410> then<00:02:34.830> struggle<00:02:35.340> trying

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
knife they have and then struggle trying

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.000 
knife they have and then struggle trying
to<00:02:35.880> get<00:02:36.120> the<00:02:36.270> point<00:02:36.540> into<00:02:37.320> the<00:02:37.470> joint<00:02:37.740> while

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
to get the point into the joint while

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.740 
to get the point into the joint while
the<00:02:38.310> hand<00:02:38.550> is<00:02:38.730> eight<00:02:38.940> inches<00:02:39.300> away<00:02:39.450> from<00:02:39.570> the

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
the hand is eight inches away from the

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.440 
the hand is eight inches away from the
chicken<00:02:40.250> so<00:02:41.250> this<00:02:41.550> works<00:02:41.910> really<00:02:42.030> well<00:02:42.390> for

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
chicken so this works really well for

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.440 
chicken so this works really well for
little<00:02:43.350> pesky<00:02:44.069> jobs<00:02:44.459> like<00:02:44.670> this<00:02:44.819> because<00:02:45.239> it's

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
little pesky jobs like this because it's

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.600 
little pesky jobs like this because it's
very<00:02:45.660> short<00:02:45.930> have<00:02:46.560> very<00:02:46.770> good<00:02:46.920> control<00:02:47.400> you

very short have very good control you

balcony that somebody else makes so I

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.520 
balcony that somebody else makes so I
think<00:03:57.030> this<00:03:57.299> is<00:03:57.480> the<00:03:57.660> probably<00:03:58.320> the<00:03:58.380> biggest

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
think this is the probably the biggest

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.979 
think this is the probably the biggest
potential<00:03:59.190> for<00:03:59.640> this<00:03:59.880> myth<00:04:00.120> is<00:04:00.660> to<00:04:00.870> be

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
potential for this myth is to be

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:04.819 
potential for this myth is to be
recognized<00:04:01.530> as<00:04:01.799> a<00:04:01.829> valid<00:04:02.400> way<00:04:03.269> of<00:04:03.829> making

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:04.829 
recognized as a valid way of making

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:09.530 
recognized as a valid way of making
