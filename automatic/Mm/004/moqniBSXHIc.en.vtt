00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:14.940
 to all these karachi 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.320
 today live from a new 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.060
 video I hope you have good for 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.580
 my part and that's great when 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.320
 jauzion end up well for another one 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.700
 good little score on fernand almost a 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.110
 top 100 again so I try the 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.820
 to still send past video a little bit of 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:28.110
 salt so if my mates for the second 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.470
 times since I've had no 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:30.180
 the video 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.259
 well then they must have had some of the 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.790
 video a few days ago that makes me 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:34.320
 pleasure you've seen for the 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.030
 technical so I wait in the barn 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.140
 I'm doing my little trick so I'll you 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.790
 let's look at the technique it's 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.920
 really not complicated we do this 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.450
 technique up the sleeve down until 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.010
 the end pretty much so there you go 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.390
 see that I'm killing on the outside but if 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.680
 you really want because in fact 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.180
 as we are in trouble are really 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.470
 resistant as you will see it 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.820
 must return to the barn for 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.890
 Russian irons pawn in the branch so 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.960
 it's not complicated and we do that to 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.550
 from the inning in advance 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.020
 So this technique you do it at 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.960
 from sleeve 22 to your 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.930
 dead so that is until the sleeve 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.700
 we will say about 70 for the record 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.290
 I think this is the saying so I 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.579
 made fifty-one inning and I'm 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.900
 dead really stupid enough so there 

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:11.070
 you've seen that I'm starting to 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.860
 easter is a bit no matter how on 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.710
 the map view that is low at this level 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.670
 even though I made spawn in the branch 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.170
 they are pointing out just as fast as 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.190
 out but even he spawn faster 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.350
 outside only in the barn 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.909
 so it's really a low technique 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.840
 here you do a little like you 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.800
 feel but I advise you 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.420
 really the technique that I'm going to 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.650
 to do is go into the barn for 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.300
 kill you actually go back to 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.440
 the end of the barn they will enter 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.740
 in and you're actually it's not 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.909
 more complicated than that and after that 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.520
 until the sleeve you manage 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.930
 for beats for easter and one of the best that 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.370
 you can before you can do this 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.780
 technique since zombies do not ring 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.070
 not fast enough and spawn a little bit 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.960
 randomly so that makes it 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.390
 do not do all this spawn in the barn and 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.960
 so it's more complicated to manage 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:54.000
 so I wanted to commit suicide at 50.2 so I 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.460
 am dead at the 51 so really 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.600
 clothes I was really disgusted 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.760
 it took about ten hours 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.690
 close to realize this gameplay so I 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.130
 thank you again to all 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.159
 people against check and on the live at 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.469
 the end 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:06.939
 of suicide and that's where we 

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:08.800
 was starting to see a lot of people so 

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:10.390
 it's a shame people have missed 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.190
 a lot of things you must see 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.110
 a lot of regen so the technique too 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.900
 to make boxes I advise you 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:19.180
 frankly the eyes m so why the 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:22.090
 eyes m so kill you kill you all 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.500
 ramparts so the time for that it 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.250
 stay like that this respect is only said 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.959
 it has response 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.879
 I advise you to attack everything 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:30.280
 to make a good ball so a good 

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:31.780
 package you expect kind of five 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.370
 minutes turned with the zombies that's 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.019
 really no bullshit the time that 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.640
 well even the last ramparts dies if 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:38.530
 you have more balls and that his 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.840
 responsible that there are all the zombies 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.920
 you cast an eyes m you sleep them 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.959
 after you go make your boxes 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.030
 so quiet about for parma in 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.840
 game there it took me 45 minutes from 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.870
 of the sleeve 50 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.400
 I needed two to three rules of that 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.609
 balaj package really not terribly 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.480
 well so that was a little bit that's why 

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:56.859
 that it's a shame that I'm 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.940
 ugly marc a little that those crawling 

00:02:56.859 --> 00:02:59.140
 because you saw the ramparts at 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.549
 after a while but she has everywhere and 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.220
 then we can not go kill too 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:04.540
 quickly we would like I'm dead 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.280
 low cut as you will see it 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.049
 did not delay I make a round trip there 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.180
 I 'm going to have even hot game I spent 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:11.170
 really here between two quick I 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.829
 am going for a ride and I'm going 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.780
 to die stupidly 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:15.340
 so after ten hours basin 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.889
 I was a little disgusted I died for 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.690
 the first time round 44-45 so there 

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:22.269
 you see death stupidly game 51 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.660
 I would have run I would have been good 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:26.680
 not serious 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:28.180
 so I do 741 1000 points 4541 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.389
 elimination we told you I'm dead 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:33.430
 in round 45 for the first time 

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:39.220
 after I died at the 47 doing 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:41.109
 a box at the 49 and the 51 for the 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.819
 last north so I was a little 

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:45.549
 disgusted I wanted to sui 6 and right after 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:47.560
 the round 50 2 so that's so c 241 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:48.940
 1000 points you see one for those 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.440
 who was telling me the last time aside 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.810
 avenue claude and ben I'm not in 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.700
 customize a good ranking 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.870
 normal and there you go see a game 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.450
 was doing a little novel of drums I 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.549
 am 137th world so I think that 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:01.900
 it is rather correct as place mallet 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:03.069
 is sent to maybe several 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.139
 community channels I would see well 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:06.849
 so if mu full debate thanks to them 

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:09.099
 so here is so I hope this video 

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:11.259
 is paid this little technique of the 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:13.980
 feeder the a45 will have you pleased so 

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:15.959
 still a year almost top 100 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.250
 in fact she so so here we go 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:20.090
 leave it on it go I tell you worse 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.090
 everyone was going next
