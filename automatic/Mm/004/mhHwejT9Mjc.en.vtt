00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
on the bend without actually affecting

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.090 
on the bend without actually affecting
the<00:01:16.020> phone<00:01:16.200> which<00:01:16.380> is<00:01:16.500> weird<00:01:16.680> because<00:01:16.860> the

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
the phone which is weird because the

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.580 
the phone which is weird because the
phones<00:01:17.310> actually<00:01:17.490> curved<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.240> screen<00:01:18.570> and<00:01:19.380> so

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
phones actually curved the screen and so

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.170 
phones actually curved the screen and so
somehow<00:01:20.040> it<00:01:20.369> actually<00:01:20.729> doesn't<00:01:20.880> even<00:01:21.060> affect

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
somehow it actually doesn't even affect

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.650 
somehow it actually doesn't even affect
the<00:01:22.140> curve<00:01:22.350> of<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.500> phone<00:01:22.710> whatsoever

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:26.660 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.850 

now<00:01:27.660> one<00:01:27.810> of<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:27.960> main<00:01:28.110> reasons<00:01:28.410> I<00:01:28.500> think<00:01:28.530> this

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
now one of the main reasons I think this

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.740 
now one of the main reasons I think this
phone<00:01:29.010> is<00:01:29.160> going<00:01:29.280> to<00:01:29.340> take<00:01:29.490> off<00:01:29.700> because<00:01:30.390> LG

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
phone is going to take off because LG

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.300 
phone is going to take off because LG
announced<00:01:30.960> that<00:01:31.170> it<00:01:31.260> has<00:01:31.380> a<00:01:31.410> self-healing

back cover meaning that light scuffs to
medium<00:01:35.370> scuffs<00:01:35.670> it<00:01:35.940> can<00:01:36.060> actually<00:01:36.180> self<00:01:36.660> heal

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
medium scuffs it can actually self heal

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.990
