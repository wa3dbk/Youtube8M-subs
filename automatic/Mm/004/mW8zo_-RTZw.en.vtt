00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.410 
guys I mean look they stimulate they do
lighter<00:02:12.220> weights<00:02:12.580> then<00:02:12.850> you<00:02:12.940> think<00:02:13.180> they<00:02:13.360> do

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
lighter weights then you think they do

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.530 
lighter weights then you think they do
and<00:02:14.310> then<00:02:15.310> they're<00:02:15.490> making<00:02:15.850> gains<00:02:16.060> ya<00:02:16.300> Leah

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
and then they're making gains ya Leah

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.360 
and then they're making gains ya Leah
there<00:02:16.900> were<00:02:17.020> the<00:02:17.230> third<00:02:17.560> that<00:02:17.890> look<00:02:18.160> when<00:02:18.310> you

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
there were the third that look when you

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.850 
there were the third that look when you
get<00:02:18.460> to<00:02:18.640> a<00:02:18.670> certain<00:02:18.730> level<00:02:19.120> of<00:02:19.660> training<00:02:20.530> a

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
get to a certain level of training a

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.430 
get to a certain level of training a
certain<00:02:21.400> level<00:02:21.580> of<00:02:21.790> advanced<00:02:22.570> lifting<00:02:23.110> are

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
certain level of advanced lifting are

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.290 
certain level of advanced lifting are
you<00:02:24.100> really<00:02:24.310> going<00:02:24.520> to<00:02:24.580> progressively<00:02:25.090> over

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
you really going to progressively over

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.270 
you really going to progressively over
little<00:02:25.600> weight<00:02:25.720> if<00:02:25.900> weight<00:02:26.200> was<00:02:26.470> just<00:02:26.800> if<00:02:27.130> you

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
little weight if weight was just if you

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.620 
little weight if weight was just if you
could<00:02:27.310> lift<00:02:27.550> wait<00:02:27.790> to<00:02:27.940> just<00:02:28.150> get<00:02:28.330> linear

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
could lift wait to just get linear

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.660 
could lift wait to just get linear

just guessing it depends on the
individual<00:03:40.060> I<00:03:40.090> always<00:03:40.330> send<00:03:40.510> that<00:03:40.630> email<00:03:40.660> back

individual I always send that email back

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.350 
individual I always send that email back
it<00:03:41.290> depends<00:03:41.680> now<00:03:42.340> once<00:03:42.670> you<00:03:42.760> get<00:03:42.910> past<00:03:42.940> that

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:43.360 
it depends now once you get past that

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.130 
it depends now once you get past that
certain<00:03:43.959> level<00:03:45.120> that's<00:03:46.120> when<00:03:46.600> you<00:03:46.870> can<00:03:47.019> get

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140 
certain level that's when you can get

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.229 
certain level that's when you can get
crazy<00:03:47.500> with<00:03:47.709> it<00:03:47.769> but<00:03:48.040> as<00:03:48.220> a<00:03:48.640> beginner<00:03:49.120> or

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
take a program and up to 12 to 16 weeks

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.030 
take a program and up to 12 to 16 weeks
you<00:03:54.790> can<00:03:55.000> do<00:03:55.239> that<00:03:55.420> and<00:03:55.690> you<00:03:55.840> can<00:03:56.019> increase<00:03:56.650> the

you can do that and you can increase the

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.670 
you can do that and you can increase the
frequency<00:03:57.580> or<00:03:58.540> it<00:03:58.780> can<00:03:58.900> increase<00:03:59.140> the<00:03:59.260> volume

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680

muscle<00:04:05.739> whereas<00:04:06.489> muscle<00:04:07.000> confusion<00:04:07.239> is<00:04:08.019> a

00:04:08.339 --> 00:04:08.349 
muscle whereas muscle confusion is a

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:10.619 
muscle whereas muscle confusion is a
great<00:04:08.769> marketing<00:04:09.310> gimmick<00:04:09.730> it's<00:04:10.209> a<00:04:10.390> great

00:04:10.619 --> 00:04:10.629 
great marketing gimmick it's a great

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:12.809 
great marketing gimmick it's a great
little<00:04:10.810> term<00:04:11.230> and<00:04:11.500> it's<00:04:11.920> cool<00:04:12.280> and<00:04:12.400> all<00:04:12.579> and

it's<00:04:13.180> not<00:04:13.390> a<00:04:13.420> bad<00:04:13.870> thing<00:04:14.170> but<00:04:15.040> it<00:04:15.159> isn't<00:04:15.670> just

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
it's not a bad thing but it isn't just

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.150 
it's not a bad thing but it isn't just
it<00:04:16.299> isn't<00:04:16.449> optimal<00:04:17.049> I<00:04:17.259> believe<00:04:17.620> for

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.080 
the shit out of them but I don't think a

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:36.990 
the shit out of them but I don't think a
weekly<00:04:35.500> change<00:04:35.800> of<00:04:35.979> a<00:04:36.039> program<00:04:36.430> for<00:04:36.639> beginner
