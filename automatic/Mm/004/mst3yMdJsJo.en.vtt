00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:05.970
 now let's start talking about the 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:08.580
 vitamins that are for the nails for 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.190
 nails we have three the first one is the 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:14.249
 iron iron is very important 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:18.050
 because it is he who helps to give strength to 

00:00:14.249 --> 00:00:21.270
 the nails the iron we already know is a 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:23.670
 very strong unit but then also 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.340
 It helps our nails feel very 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.290
 very hard then when they have some 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.080
 that tend to break fast then 

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:33.020
 consume iron where they can find 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.620
 the iron in the nuts 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:40.730
 the second important thing for nails 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:43.550
 is zinc zinc is in charge of 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.950
 the nails that look like pores and 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.680
 you are falling but as if 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:50.480
 Scales that are scaly zinc is 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.850
 very important for that and that's why 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.890
 we must take it and it is part of the 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.140
 routine of the vitamins of the nails 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:02.320
 where can we find it in the 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:02.320
 chocolate the peanut and the payment 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:10.340
 the third of the vitamins that we should 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:12.979
 to take for the nails is the b12 the b12 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:15.650
 is responsible for putting the nails 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:17.600
 be clear and that they look transparent 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:20.000
 many times we see that we get 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:23.119
 dots on the nails are white or 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.909
 stained nails that's lack of vitamin 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:28.130
 b12 where we can find it 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:30.200
 we can find in the cheeses in the 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.680
