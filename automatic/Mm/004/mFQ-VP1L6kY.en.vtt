 pulls both sides back and forth 

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:07.680
 and I believe that it is the last weapon of the 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.480
 game and they high alot of explosives in the 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.580

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:20.970
 very good damage 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:24.630

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:27.359

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.109
 Of car 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.540
 This all helps a lot in the field of 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.930
 battle that in this case are the clues or 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:39.420
 arenas that have inside the game is good 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.920
 ranking list in case I'm already in the 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.660
 second ranking list 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.690
 the first ranking list I've done with 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.820
 the cars but say so rotten 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.520
 I stayed in first and after a 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.190
 time comes an event of this public event 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:56.070

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.390

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.489
 arrive first 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.579
 There's going to be another event that I go through. 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.559
 for next clichy to arrive first 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.119
 and so on 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.040
 so come on go on because it matters 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.750
 Enough of curling 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.439
 Do you know that this curse is for who 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:15.930
 You have doubt if you bought the game who has 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.420
 some that they intend to buy even 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.860
 to know the peculiarities of the 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.030
 game to know if it's worth it or not 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.680
 Okay, stay here, I'll explain the 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.259
 types of racing that are enabled 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.229
 for now do not know if I have more're 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:33.329
 I did not reach the end of the game still runs 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.729
 if this race offers the best 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.799
 reward of all kinds 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.650
 in the case of it consisting of only one 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:45.240
 normal running without a firearm only 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:47.430
 with indirect type mine and oil weapons 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.079
 that you play on the track but not those 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.180
 The weapons I showed you are others. 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:53.850
 types of gun is good as if it were the 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.399
 banana peels mario kart making 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:00.299
 an analogy the second type of race 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:02.659
 bear or race that in this case only 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:06.090
 power racing the fact that I can use more 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:08.910
 certain but the rest is the same thing 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:12.750
 This is what I like most knockout. 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.280
 each lap is being eliminated the last 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.370
 placed 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.560
 of the race or even very exciting 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.450
 including the kind of race I go 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.330
 show you guys soon 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:26.660
 and the other mode of play he's done 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:29.090
 in arenas in circuit but without arenas 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.459
 and it's like you're a method tourist is 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:34.010
 everybody tells everybody everybody makes a team 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:37.220
 of f1 net last last man 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:39.650
 standing is the winner of the event 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.660
 so let's make a run of 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.910
 knockout for you to have an idea of 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:47.600
 how is the game and stop listening to this 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:50.450
 annoying voice that speaks to you is let's go there 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.470
 gold rush and come to 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.420
 running 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.850
 You 're here so far because you 're very 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:58.850
 interested in knowing what it is like to 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:05.930
 gameplay of this great racing game 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:09.050
 and come on gasnier first gameplay goal 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.250
 I'm not the clinging live this 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:12.350
 part of the race 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:15.260
 You know why because I have to record 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:18.470
 I left the program on the microphone 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:20.000
 there he gave paulo but also another 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.269
 problem that I did not arrive at first 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.299
 The first time I tried to win 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:28.040
 I came in second and then recorded another 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:31.070
 gameplay I came in second again 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:34.010
 so what I decided to do I decided 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:37.310
 bet first round of the first 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:39.230
 race is a race that can have maximum 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:42.019
 seven laps 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:48.079
 depending on whether any player died 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:49.010
 for example at each turn a player leaves 

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:50.930
 of the match 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:53.209
 the one who comes last if he 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.980
 to die before there decreases one 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:57.890
 because there will be one player 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:00.530
 You will not have to eliminate more people 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:04.940
 that is to say if in the first return already to die 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:07.310
 in seven players in the case and I only left 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:11.109
 already wins on the first lap but there 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:13.850
 almost impossible to happen is clear 

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:16.850
 You saw this first round was 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:18.209
 very good because I put up a 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:20.639
 certain point 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:22.919
 the first lap is not possible 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:25.380
 use firearms 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:28.979
 only from a certain point which is a 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:32.069
 Battle zone point I think it 's beautiful 

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:34.830
 horizone and there it releases use of weapons 

00:04:32.069 --> 00:04:38.009
 This first turn is just to show 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:41.099
 you how the circuit and then after such 

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:42.810
 You stopped with a montage of the best 

00:04:41.099 --> 00:04:44.520
 that the ones I got to do 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:48.780
 just for you to have an idea of ​​how 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:50.460
 that the use of this weapon 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:53.580
 12 gauge 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:56.099
 wow who shoots back and forth 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.970
 also in the middle of the race in the 

00:04:56.099 --> 00:04:58.770
 track 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:00.840
 You will see that you have some items. 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:03.960
 to get caught up with the kart summary 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:06.360
 even those items that are a 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:08.220
 Only question is that even if you already 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.180
 You know what you're going to get, so it's a little 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:11.430
 best 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:13.259
 there depending on the color you can choose 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:15.509
 that you want 

00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:16.380
 if it is an item with the red ball in 

00:05:15.509 --> 00:05:17.849
 return 

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:19.880
 he will have to be with one of these 

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:24.840
 things that I'm going to be following 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:27.240
 nitro armament and who from defense like 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:29.940
 for example in that part in law that 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:32.280
 I just got out and I picked up an item on the 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:35.430
 red was like a dark has 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:37.889
 how to get the oil to play on the track 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:42.380
 to mess up the others who come after 

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:45.240
 to slip into landmines and 

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:48.090
 smoke also makes a lot of noise 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:51.539
 coming back and not counting that he has to 

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:54.719
 You can save your game which is the nitro that 

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:59.099
 is also danger in the red items 

00:05:54.719 --> 00:06:01.469
 if it is green the item is and has to be healed 

00:05:59.099 --> 00:06:05.280
 will always be the item to fix your 

00:06:01.469 --> 00:06:09.090
 car and if it's yellow it's going to be 

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:10.650
 money always so soon already by far 

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:12.900
 have the possibility to know which one 

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:14.400
 be your interest in which item 

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:17.580
 Do you want to take that moment? 

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:18.509
 depending on how is your state and your 

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:21.780
 car

 so let's see some more kills and why 

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:27.420
