00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.940
...She looks like she's about to say something.

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:06.040
But from the way she is staying silent...

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:13.500
Her words are at her mouth, but she seems to be... lacking something?

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.640
...Kyousuke-shi...

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.340
Saori, please.

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.100
I want to hear what you have to say.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.540
But, but...

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:25.600
■ Do what you want? ■
But, but...

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:30.470
■ Do what you want? ■
I don't know what I should do anymore...!

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.790
I don't know what I should do anymore...!

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:34.520
I understand how Saori feels. I understand, but...!

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.620
Then, just do what you want.

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:39.950
Eh...?

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:44.900
I'm not you, so I can't understand you completely.

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:51.790
If what I said so far still can't shake your determination, then perhaps this is the best choice for you?

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.850
...In that case, I won't say anything further.

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:57.970
Kyousuke-shi...

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.680
...it's my honour to have received your understanding.

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.720
I still haven't fully accepted this yet...

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:11.750
But, even if we no longer hang out with each other, we're still friends forever!

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.330
This was embarrassing to say for me.

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.330
However, this is how I truly feel, and I can't lie to myself.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:25.950
Well then... take care of yourself.

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:35.330
A few months after that...

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.450
I received a letter and a photograph from Saori.

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:45.320
In the letter, she wrote that her wedding was held on her birthday.

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:51.870
Because the wedding reception was only for relatives, Kirino, Kuroneko and I were not invited.

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:55.450
Next, the photograph...

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.680
Showed Saori dressed in a pure white wedding dress.

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.430
...she looks beautiful.

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:08.770
With a nice smile on her face, Saori really gives the feel of a neat and proper lady.

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:13.180
I would say that Saori is truly a worthy beauty.

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.420
But, why is it so?

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:21.200
When I look at her smiling face, my heart hurts.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.120
It's embarrassing to say, but my heart feels like it's being crushed with loneliness.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.330
This has to be the feeling of seeing your daughter getting married off.

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.070
...hey, Saori.

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:37.820
This was... the right thing to do, right?

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:44.350
Saori smiled with a lonely expression in the picture...

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:57.260
