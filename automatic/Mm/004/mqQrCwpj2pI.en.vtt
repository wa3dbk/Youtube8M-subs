in<00:00:26.519> this<00:00:26.699> next<00:00:26.939> example<00:00:27.180> we<00:00:27.779> see<00:00:27.960> how<00:00:28.259> the

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
in this next example we see how the

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.670 
in this next example we see how the
power<00:00:29.039> door<00:00:29.430> lock<00:00:30.230> circuitry<00:00:31.230> actually

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:31.680 
power door lock circuitry actually

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.189 
power door lock circuitry actually
operates<00:00:32.160> on<00:00:32.340> within<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.759> system<00:00:33.149> and<00:00:33.930> this

00:00:34.189 --> 00:00:34.199 
operates on within the system and this

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:37.850 
operates on within the system and this
again<00:00:34.559> is<00:00:35.070> a<00:00:35.280> system<00:00:35.760> that<00:00:36.000> is<00:00:36.270> actually<00:00:36.480> uh<00:00:36.860> as

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
again is a system that is actually uh as

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.889 
again is a system that is actually uh as
we're<00:00:38.070> going<00:00:38.220> to<00:00:38.280> see<00:00:38.550> next<00:00:38.760> controlled<00:00:39.690> by

the<00:00:43.830> actual<00:00:44.309> systems<00:00:44.910> nowadays<00:00:45.150> are

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
the actual systems nowadays are

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.979 
the actual systems nowadays are
controlled<00:00:46.230> by<00:00:46.290> some<00:00:46.620> kind<00:00:46.860> of<00:00:47.010> module<00:00:47.989> gone

controlled by some kind of module gone

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.899 
controlled by some kind of module gone
are<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.379> days<00:00:49.589> where<00:00:49.949> you<00:00:49.980> are<00:00:50.280> going<00:00:50.519> to<00:00:50.699> see

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:50.909 
are the days where you are going to see

00:00:50.909 --> 00:00:54.950 
are the days where you are going to see
a<00:00:50.940> power<00:00:52.220> system<00:00:53.220> or<00:00:53.610> a<00:00:53.640> control<00:00:54.059> system<00:00:54.449> with

a power system or a control system with

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.290 
a power system or a control system with
a<00:00:55.050> point-to-point<00:00:55.559> connection<00:00:56.339> meaning<00:00:57.089> the

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
a point-to-point connection meaning the

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.200 
a point-to-point connection meaning the
switch<00:00:57.570> directly<00:00:58.050> connected<00:00:58.590> to<00:00:58.710> a<00:00:58.770> motor<00:00:59.210> so

again<00:01:00.510> in<00:01:00.690> this<00:01:00.899> particular<00:01:01.109> case<00:01:01.649> we<00:01:01.829> see<00:01:02.010> the

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
again in this particular case we see the

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.979 
again in this particular case we see the
power<00:01:02.340> door<00:01:02.550> lock<00:01:02.760> module<00:01:03.270> connected<00:01:03.690> to<00:01:03.840> its

power door lock module connected to its
ground<00:01:04.229> source<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:04.890> this<00:01:05.489> system<00:01:05.729> is

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
ground source and this system is

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.749 
ground source and this system is
actually<00:01:06.539> a<00:01:06.570> ground<00:01:07.110> control<00:01:08.039> are<00:01:08.399> you<00:01:08.580> know

00:01:08.749 --> 00:01:08.759 
actually a ground control are you know

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:10.810 
actually a ground control are you know
that<00:01:08.970> because<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.630> system<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.259> motor<00:01:10.500> is

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
that because the system the motor is

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.120 
that because the system the motor is
directly<00:01:11.820> connected<00:01:12.690> to<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.869> fuse<00:01:13.289> or<00:01:13.470> to<00:01:14.009> the

this motor to be activated a a specific
positive<00:01:23.490> pulse<00:01:24.060> has<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:25.140> be<00:01:25.259> implemented<00:01:26.190> by

00:01:26.389 --> 00:01:26.399 
positive pulse has to be implemented by

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:29.690 
positive pulse has to be implemented by
the<00:01:26.460> actual<00:01:26.880> module<00:01:27.300> a<00:01:27.830> again<00:01:28.830> the<00:01:29.399> even

to<00:01:36.840> move<00:01:37.049> up<00:01:37.259> and<00:01:37.470> down<00:01:37.680> but<00:01:38.009> this<00:01:38.130> is<00:01:38.189> just<00:01:38.460> one

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
to move up and down but this is just one

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.789 
to move up and down but this is just one
side<00:01:38.970> of<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.240> circuit<00:01:39.659> and<00:01:39.689> we<00:01:40.320> are<00:01:40.409> trying<00:01:40.680> to

side of the circuit and we are trying to
simplify<00:01:41.310> it<00:01:41.369> for<00:01:41.640> sake<00:01:41.880> of<00:01:42.060> explanation<00:01:42.210> and

simplify it for sake of explanation and

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.490 
simplify it for sake of explanation and
in<00:01:43.470> this<00:01:43.649> case<00:01:43.920> we<00:01:44.250> see<00:01:44.460> that<00:01:45.060> a<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:46.020> actual

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
in this case we see that a the actual

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.630 
in this case we see that a the actual
system<00:01:47.009> it's<00:01:47.850> connected<00:01:48.840> by<00:01:48.990> a<00:01:49.170> some<00:01:50.100> form<00:01:50.520> of

is<00:02:37.709> important<00:02:38.280> in<00:02:38.340> this<00:02:38.459> particular<00:02:38.760> case

00:02:39.789 --> 00:02:39.799 
is important in this particular case

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:42.289 
is important in this particular case
keep<00:02:40.799> in<00:02:40.950> mind<00:02:41.159> that<00:02:41.340> you<00:02:41.459> also<00:02:41.610> have<00:02:41.939> to<00:02:42.120> have

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:42.299 
keep in mind that you also have to have

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:47.390 
keep in mind that you also have to have
a<00:02:42.629> data<00:02:42.959> the<00:02:43.920> data<00:02:44.189> path<00:02:44.579> in<00:02:45.360> mind<00:02:46.129> again<00:02:47.129> the

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
a data the data path in mind again the

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.330 
a data the data path in mind again the
blue<00:02:47.640> line<00:02:47.879> as<00:02:48.599> we<00:02:49.200> just<00:02:49.650> saw<00:02:50.569> actually

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
blue line as we just saw actually

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.920 
blue line as we just saw actually
determines<00:02:53.340> the<00:02:53.489> path<00:02:53.730> of<00:02:53.970> electrons<00:02:54.480> through

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
determines the path of electrons through

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.350 
determines the path of electrons through
the<00:02:55.379> actual<00:02:55.650> module<00:02:55.890> itself<00:02:56.400> and<00:02:56.640> the<00:02:57.090> Green

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
the actual module itself and the Green

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.350 
the actual module itself and the Green
Line<00:02:57.390> is<00:02:57.629> the<00:02:57.870> switched<00:02:58.530> or<00:02:58.920> the<00:02:59.579> ignition

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
Line is the switched or the ignition

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.770 
Line is the switched or the ignition
switch<00:03:00.510> side<00:03:01.290> that<00:03:01.739> goes<00:03:01.920> to<00:03:02.040> the<00:03:02.159> module

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
switch side that goes to the module

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.170 
switch side that goes to the module
again<00:03:03.780> a<00:03:04.230> lot<00:03:04.680> of<00:03:04.799> these<00:03:05.000> functions<00:03:06.000> are

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
again a lot of these functions are

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.910 
again a lot of these functions are
controlled<00:03:06.599> by<00:03:07.019> the<00:03:07.319> body<00:03:07.709> module<00:03:08.280> and<00:03:09.349> but<00:03:10.349> in

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
controlled by the body module and but in

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.399 
controlled by the body module and but in
many<00:03:11.189> instances<00:03:11.310> a<00:03:12.209> separate<00:03:12.810> module<00:03:13.260> is

00:03:13.399 --> 00:03:13.409 
many instances a separate module is

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:15.979 
many instances a separate module is
actually<00:03:13.620> used<00:03:14.220> to<00:03:14.489> control<00:03:15.060> these<00:03:15.209> specific

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
actually used to control these specific

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:18.470 
actually used to control these specific
functions<00:03:16.500> such<00:03:17.040> as<00:03:17.069> power<00:03:17.700> windows<00:03:18.120> seats

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
functions such as power windows seats

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:34.340 
functions such as power windows seats
and<00:03:18.930> door<00:03:19.200> locks
