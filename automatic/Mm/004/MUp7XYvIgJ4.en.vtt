one of the first things you do is you

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.109 
one of the first things you do is you
start<00:00:27.390> cutting<00:00:27.720> in<00:00:28.140> round<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:28.920> molding<00:00:29.369> the

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
stipple into the corners like so just to

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.080 
stipple into the corners like so just to
make<00:00:38.129> sure<00:00:38.160> you<00:00:38.370> didn't<00:00:38.610> killed<00:00:38.820> a<00:00:38.879> little

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
you've covered the whole inside of this

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.450 
you've covered the whole inside of this
panel<00:00:47.820> here<00:00:48.410> okay<00:00:49.410> and<00:00:50.010> once<00:00:50.250> you've<00:00:50.430> done

panel here okay and once you've done
that<00:00:50.670> you<00:00:51.600> can<00:00:51.629> then<00:00:52.079> start<00:00:52.710> working<00:00:53.190> on<00:00:53.460> this

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
that you can then start working on this

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.270 
that you can then start working on this
section<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:54.960> again<00:00:55.379> what<00:00:55.770> you<00:00:55.860> do<00:00:56.039> is<00:00:56.160> you

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
section and again what you do is you

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.180 
section and again what you do is you
just<00:00:56.309> apply<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.789> paint<00:00:57.710> making<00:00:58.710> sure<00:00:58.949> that

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
just apply the paint making sure that

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.000 
just apply the paint making sure that
you<00:00:59.309> spread<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.940> paint<00:01:00.210> evenly<00:01:00.840> across<00:01:01.109> if

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
you spread the paint evenly across if

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.709 
you spread the paint evenly across if
you<00:01:02.129> don't<00:01:02.280> spread<00:01:02.609> it<00:01:02.699> across<00:01:02.789> evenly<00:01:03.510> you

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
you don't spread it across evenly you

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.620 
you don't spread it across evenly you
will<00:01:03.840> end<00:01:04.080> up<00:01:04.290> what's<00:01:04.589> patchiness<00:01:05.630> which

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
will end up what's patchiness which

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.300 
will end up what's patchiness which
means<00:01:06.930> that<00:01:07.170> part<00:01:07.380> of<00:01:07.470> what<00:01:07.590> we've<00:01:07.770> covered<00:01:07.799> in

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
means that part of what we've covered in

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.080 
means that part of what we've covered in
the<00:01:08.460> other<00:01:08.549> part<00:01:08.880> won't<00:01:10.280> so<00:01:11.280> once<00:01:11.670> you've<00:01:11.880> done

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
the other part won't so once you've done

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.929 
the other part won't so once you've done
that<00:01:12.439> what<00:01:13.439> you<00:01:13.560> do<00:01:13.710> is<00:01:13.860> you<00:01:14.010> start<00:01:14.340> laying<00:01:14.640> off

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
that what you do is you start laying off

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.410 
that what you do is you start laying off
and<00:01:15.930> lean<00:01:16.799> off<00:01:17.009> basically<00:01:17.729> means<00:01:17.970> that<00:01:18.299> it's

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
and lean off basically means that it's

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.240 
and lean off basically means that it's
going<00:01:18.509> to<00:01:18.630> give<00:01:18.720> it<00:01:18.750> a<00:01:18.900> nice<00:01:19.080> finish<00:01:19.560> with<00:01:19.950> very

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
going to give it a nice finish with very

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.960 
going to give it a nice finish with very
very<00:01:20.640> few<00:01:20.820> brush<00:01:21.780> marks

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
very few brush marks

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.640 
very few brush marks
and<00:01:24.450> what<00:01:24.630> you<00:01:24.720> can<00:01:24.870> do<00:01:25.020> to<00:01:25.230> check<00:01:25.440> that<00:01:25.530> if

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
and what you can do to check that if

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.260 
and what you can do to check that if
you've<00:01:25.800> covered<00:01:26.010> it<00:01:26.310> is<00:01:26.400> just<00:01:26.610> have<00:01:27.060> a<00:01:27.090> little

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
you've covered it is just have a little

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.270 
you've covered it is just have a little
look<00:01:27.360> down<00:01:27.690> and<00:01:28.080> if<00:01:28.530> you<00:01:28.650> see<00:01:28.890> there's<00:01:29.130> no

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
look down and if you see there's no

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.220 
look down and if you see there's no
flashing<00:01:30.000> which<00:01:30.330> means<00:01:30.600> that<00:01:30.840> there's<00:01:31.080> no

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:31.230 
flashing which means that there's no

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:35.750 
flashing which means that there's no
patchi's<00:01:31.800> then<00:01:32.100> you've<00:01:32.250> finished<00:01:34.760> once

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:35.760 
patchi's then you've finished once

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.360 
patchi's then you've finished once
you've<00:01:35.910> done<00:01:36.120> that<00:01:36.180> all<00:01:36.690> three<00:01:37.320> panels<00:01:37.890> or<00:01:38.160> all

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:38.370 
you've done that all three panels or all

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:40.040 
you've done that all three panels or all
four<00:01:38.580> panels<00:01:39.000> what<00:01:39.150> you<00:01:39.240> then<00:01:39.390> do<00:01:39.630> is<00:01:39.660> you

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:40.050 
four panels what you then do is you

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:45.350 
four panels what you then do is you
start<00:01:40.230> working<00:01:40.680> in<00:01:40.770> this<00:01:40.890> section<00:01:44.330> all<00:01:45.330> the

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
start working in this section all the

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.340 
start working in this section all the
way<00:01:45.630> down<00:01:45.900> across<00:01:47.300> and<00:01:48.300> then<00:01:48.510> we<00:01:48.900> do<00:01:49.080> the<00:01:49.170> same

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
way down across and then we do the same

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.140 
way down across and then we do the same
in<00:01:49.410> all<00:01:49.650> the<00:01:49.770> panels<00:01:50.190> and<00:01:50.400> all<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.580> sections

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:51.150 
in all the panels and all the sections

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.750 
in all the panels and all the sections
once<00:01:52.050> you<00:01:52.200> finish<00:01:52.530> that<00:01:52.560> you<00:01:53.040> start<00:01:53.370> working

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:53.760 
once you finish that you start working

00:01:53.760 --> 00:02:01.670 
once you finish that you start working
on<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:53.910> sides<00:01:55.220> going<00:01:56.220> down<00:01:57.470> like<00:01:58.470> so

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.650 

and<00:02:02.280> again<00:02:02.730> you<00:02:03.090> would<00:02:03.180> use<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:03.450> same

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:03.660 
and again you would use the same

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:09.469 
and again you would use the same
technique<00:02:04.200> to<00:02:05.990> layoff<00:02:08.180> once<00:02:09.180> you've<00:02:09.330> done

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
technique to layoff once you've done

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.100 
technique to layoff once you've done
that<00:02:09.540> you've<00:02:10.170> completed<00:02:10.350> your<00:02:10.619> panel<00:02:10.979> door
