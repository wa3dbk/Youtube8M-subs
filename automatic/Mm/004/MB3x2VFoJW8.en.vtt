operant conditioning and that means your

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:24.929 
operant conditioning and that means your
horse<00:00:23.590> is<00:00:23.740> learning<00:00:23.949> to<00:00:24.160> operate<00:00:24.189> on<00:00:24.789> their

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:24.939 
horse is learning to operate on their

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:26.220 
horse is learning to operate on their
environment<00:00:25.420> they're<00:00:25.630> learning<00:00:25.779> to<00:00:25.990> get

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:26.230 
environment they're learning to get

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:27.900 
environment they're learning to get
things<00:00:26.470> that<00:00:26.619> they<00:00:26.769> want<00:00:27.010> or<00:00:27.250> to<00:00:27.369> avoid<00:00:27.609> things

things that they want or to avoid things

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:30.800 
things that they want or to avoid things
they<00:00:28.060> don't<00:00:28.210> want<00:00:28.330> so<00:00:29.230> if<00:00:29.500> you<00:00:29.590> see<00:00:30.279> any

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
they don't want so if you see any

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.960 
they don't want so if you see any
behavior<00:00:31.810> in<00:00:32.080> your<00:00:32.290> horse's<00:00:32.770> life<00:00:32.980> increasing

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:33.970 
behavior in your horse's life increasing

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.090 
behavior in your horse's life increasing
in<00:00:34.060> frequency<00:00:34.170> that<00:00:35.170> means<00:00:35.440> something<00:00:35.950> in<00:00:36.070> the

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:36.100 
in frequency that means something in the

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.580 
in frequency that means something in the
environment<00:00:36.250> is<00:00:36.760> reinforcing<00:00:37.360> it<00:00:37.629> so<00:00:38.230> that

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:38.590 
environment is reinforcing it so that

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:39.869 
environment is reinforcing it so that
could<00:00:38.739> be<00:00:38.829> something<00:00:39.070> you<00:00:39.280> want<00:00:39.460> to<00:00:39.550> see<00:00:39.700> more

00:00:39.869 --> 00:00:39.879 
could be something you want to see more

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:41.340 
could be something you want to see more
of<00:00:39.940> or<00:00:40.270> something<00:00:40.600> you<00:00:40.690> don't<00:00:40.719> want<00:00:41.110> to<00:00:41.200> see

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:41.350 
of or something you don't want to see

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.260 
of or something you don't want to see
more<00:00:41.559> of<00:00:41.590> but<00:00:42.129> means<00:00:42.399> something<00:00:42.489> is<00:00:42.910> happening

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:43.270 
more of but means something is happening

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:45.360 
more of but means something is happening
to<00:00:43.329> reinforce<00:00:43.930> it<00:00:44.140> and<00:00:44.289> sometimes<00:00:45.100> we're<00:00:45.219> not

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:45.370 
to reinforce it and sometimes we're not

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:47.220 
to reinforce it and sometimes we're not
always<00:00:45.520> aware<00:00:45.730> of<00:00:45.910> what<00:00:46.120> those<00:00:46.570> factors<00:00:47.020> might

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:47.230 
always aware of what those factors might

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:48.840 
always aware of what those factors might
be<00:00:47.440> that<00:00:47.770> what's<00:00:48.010> coming<00:00:48.219> into<00:00:48.520> play<00:00:48.789> to

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:48.850 
be that what's coming into play to

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.630 
be that what's coming into play to
affect<00:00:49.660> their<00:00:49.780> personality<00:00:50.410> or<00:00:50.500> affect<00:00:51.129> you

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:51.640 
affect their personality or affect you

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.490 
affect their personality or affect you
know<00:00:51.760> behaviors<00:00:52.239> that<00:00:52.420> they're<00:00:52.600> doing<00:00:52.960> for

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:53.500 
know behaviors that they're doing for

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.250 
know behaviors that they're doing for
example<00:00:53.920> a<00:00:54.070> good<00:00:54.250> a<00:00:54.309> good<00:00:55.300> situation<00:00:56.109> I<00:00:56.199> think

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
example a good a good situation I think

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.220 
example a good a good situation I think
of<00:00:56.649> where<00:00:57.070> our<00:00:57.370> horses<00:00:58.210> gets<00:00:58.539> reinforced<00:00:59.140> in

00:00:59.220 --> 00:00:59.230 
of where our horses gets reinforced in

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:00.680 
of where our horses gets reinforced in
their<00:00:59.350> environment<00:00:59.859> we<00:00:59.980> don't<00:01:00.190> think<00:01:00.430> we're

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
their environment we don't think we're

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.759 
their environment we don't think we're
reinforcing<00:01:01.690> them<00:01:01.840> is<00:01:01.960> a<00:01:02.199> lot<00:01:02.440> of<00:01:02.559> times

00:01:02.759 --> 00:01:02.769 
reinforcing them is a lot of times

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:04.590 
reinforcing them is a lot of times
you'll<00:01:02.980> see<00:01:03.129> horses<00:01:03.519> pawing<00:01:03.910> in<00:01:04.000> the<00:01:04.090> barn<00:01:04.330> of

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
you'll see horses pawing in the barn of

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.210 
you'll see horses pawing in the barn of
the<00:01:04.690> cross<00:01:04.900> tie<00:01:05.170> and<00:01:05.470> then<00:01:05.920> there's<00:01:06.130> a

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:06.220 
the cross tie and then there's a

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.460 
the cross tie and then there's a
tendency<00:01:06.820> for<00:01:06.850> us<00:01:07.090> to<00:01:07.420> come<00:01:07.600> up<00:01:07.720> and<00:01:07.900> want<00:01:08.380> to

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:08.470 
tendency for us to come up and want to

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.830 
tendency for us to come up and want to
stop<00:01:08.680> them<00:01:08.890> and<00:01:09.040> and<00:01:09.310> just<00:01:09.610> to<00:01:10.030> discipline

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
stop them and and just to discipline

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.270 
stop them and and just to discipline
them<00:01:10.960> or<00:01:11.080> you<00:01:11.350> know<00:01:11.380> fuss<00:01:11.680> at<00:01:11.860> them<00:01:12.010> for<00:01:12.160> that

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
them or you know fuss at them for that

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.520 
them or you know fuss at them for that
behavior<00:01:12.580> to<00:01:12.850> correct<00:01:13.150> them<00:01:13.390> and<00:01:13.630> oftentimes

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 
behavior to correct them and oftentimes

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.740 
behavior to correct them and oftentimes
you'll<00:01:14.920> see<00:01:15.100> it<00:01:15.250> doesn't<00:01:15.490> go<00:01:15.760> away<00:01:16.060> in<00:01:16.300> fact<00:01:16.600> it

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:16.750 
you'll see it doesn't go away in fact it

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:18.840 
you'll see it doesn't go away in fact it
just<00:01:16.780> tends<00:01:17.200> to<00:01:17.290> get<00:01:17.500> worse<00:01:17.710> because<00:01:18.550> in<00:01:18.760> that

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
just tends to get worse because in that

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.760 
just tends to get worse because in that
situation<00:01:19.570> a<00:01:19.660> lot<00:01:19.810> of<00:01:19.930> times<00:01:20.170> the<00:01:20.380> horse<00:01:20.590> would

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
situation a lot of times the horse would

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:22.440 
situation a lot of times the horse would
rather<00:01:20.950> have<00:01:21.220> some<00:01:21.580> interaction<00:01:22.120> would

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 
rather have some interaction would

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.150 
rather have some interaction would
rather<00:01:22.630> have<00:01:22.870> you<00:01:22.990> come<00:01:23.200> up<00:01:23.230> even<00:01:23.590> if<00:01:23.890> it's<00:01:23.980> to

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:24.160 
rather have you come up even if it's to

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:25.470 
rather have you come up even if it's to
say<00:01:24.340> no<00:01:24.550> no<00:01:24.760> don't<00:01:25.030> do<00:01:25.210> that

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:25.480 
say no no don't do that

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.180 
say no no don't do that
they<00:01:25.900> are<00:01:26.020> getting<00:01:26.380> a<00:01:26.470> response<00:01:26.890> they're

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:27.190 
they are getting a response they're

they are getting a response they're
getting<00:01:27.460> a<00:01:27.490> reaction<00:01:27.640> so<00:01:28.540> sometimes<00:01:28.960> the<00:01:29.170> best

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 
getting a reaction so sometimes the best
