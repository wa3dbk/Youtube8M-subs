out really soon I'm guessing but um this
was<00:01:02.190> released<00:01:02.430> in<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.730> UK<00:01:02.910> first<00:01:03.449> so<00:01:04.080> they<00:01:04.799> do

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
was released in the UK first so they do

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.100 
was released in the UK first so they do
have<00:01:05.250> it<00:01:05.369> there<00:01:05.549> but<00:01:06.270> this<00:01:06.570> is<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.869> lash

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.240 
my ultimate opinion on it so first of
all<00:02:06.689> I'm<00:02:06.780> gonna<00:02:06.899> curl<00:02:07.229> my<00:02:07.320> lashes<00:02:07.409> because<00:02:07.979> I

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
all I'm gonna curl my lashes because I

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.420 
all I'm gonna curl my lashes because I
just<00:02:08.789> love<00:02:09.390> to<00:02:09.539> curl<00:02:09.690> my<00:02:09.720> lashes<00:02:09.810> and<00:02:10.289> it<00:02:10.649> just

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
just love to curl my lashes and it just

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:17.230 
just love to curl my lashes and it just
makes<00:02:11.700> your<00:02:11.879> mascara<00:02:12.510> look<00:02:12.629> so<00:02:12.840> much<00:02:12.959> better

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.240 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.790 

I'm<00:02:18.240> not<00:02:18.480> gonna<00:02:18.570> wear<00:02:18.750> any<00:02:18.960> eyeliner<00:02:19.290> today

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
I'm not gonna wear any eyeliner today

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.560 
I'm not gonna wear any eyeliner today
just<00:02:20.160> I<00:02:20.460> hope<00:02:20.850> that<00:02:21.000> doesn't<00:02:21.150> like<00:02:21.330> make<00:02:21.540> a

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
just I hope that doesn't like make a

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:26.510 
just I hope that doesn't like make a
difference<00:02:21.780> but<00:02:24.860> so<00:02:25.860> here's<00:02:26.100> like<00:02:26.250> my<00:02:26.400> own

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
difference but so here's like my own

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:27.950 
difference but so here's like my own
natural<00:02:26.970> lashes<00:02:27.180> I<00:02:27.510> would<00:02:27.660> say<00:02:27.780> they're<00:02:27.930> a

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:27.960 
natural lashes I would say they're a

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.140 
natural lashes I would say they're a
medium<00:02:28.530> length<00:02:28.830> and<00:02:29.100> not<00:02:29.220> like<00:02:29.340> super<00:02:29.760> long<00:02:29.910> or

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
medium length and not like super long or

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.400 
medium length and not like super long or
anything<00:02:30.330> but<00:02:30.720> they're<00:02:30.870> just<00:02:30.990> a<00:02:31.080> medium

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
anything but they're just a medium

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.500 
anything but they're just a medium
length<00:02:31.560> I<00:02:31.770> would<00:02:31.890> say<00:02:32.040> so<00:02:32.910> I'm<00:02:33.180> gonna<00:02:33.300> apply

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
length I would say so I'm gonna apply

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.610 
length I would say so I'm gonna apply
this<00:02:33.630> mascara<00:02:35.270> just<00:02:36.270> a<00:02:36.390> brush<00:02:36.600> again<00:02:36.930> it's

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
this mascara just a brush again it's

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:38.510 
this mascara just a brush again it's
really<00:02:37.830> thin

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
really thin

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:47.690 
really thin
I<00:02:43.760> like<00:02:44.760> the<00:02:45.000> formula<00:02:45.810> of<00:02:45.990> it<00:02:46.200> it's<00:02:46.920> kind<00:02:47.520> of<00:02:47.550> in

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
I like the formula of it it's kind of in

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.400 
I like the formula of it it's kind of in
between<00:02:47.730> oh<00:02:48.060> right<00:02:48.360> and<00:02:48.540> it's<00:02:48.690> wet<00:02:48.990> in<00:02:49.110> a<00:02:49.200> dry

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
between oh right and it's wet in a dry

00:02:49.410 --> 00:03:09.860 
between oh right and it's wet in a dry
formula<00:03:01.490> so<00:03:02.490> there's<00:03:03.000> my<00:03:03.180> first<00:03:03.210> coat<00:03:08.870> looks

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
formula so there's my first coat looks

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.540 
formula so there's my first coat looks
pretty<00:03:10.230> good<00:03:10.380> so<00:03:10.440> far<00:03:10.590> I'm<00:03:11.010> gonna<00:03:11.160> do<00:03:11.340> another

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
pretty good so far I'm gonna do another

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:20.890 
pretty good so far I'm gonna do another
coat

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.390 

so<00:03:21.900> that's<00:03:22.080> what<00:03:22.260> my<00:03:22.380> second<00:03:22.800> cut<00:03:22.950> looks<00:03:23.160> like

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
so that's what my second cut looks like

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.740 
so that's what my second cut looks like
it's<00:03:23.670> like<00:03:23.910> really<00:03:24.870> awesome<00:03:26.150> I'm<00:03:27.150> like<00:03:27.450> really

for my final thoughts on the Rimmel lash
accelerator<00:04:09.720> unless<00:04:10.290> I<00:04:10.500> would<00:04:10.620> say<00:04:10.770> I<00:04:11.040> really

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
accelerator unless I would say I really

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.670 
accelerator unless I would say I really
do<00:04:12.030> like<00:04:12.240> this<00:04:12.450> mascara<00:04:12.720> I<00:04:13.050> think<00:04:13.260> it<00:04:13.350> does<00:04:13.650> a

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
do like this mascara I think it does a

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.940 
do like this mascara I think it does a
really<00:04:14.100> great<00:04:14.310> job<00:04:14.430> of<00:04:15.049> lengthening<00:04:16.049> and<00:04:16.440> give

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
really great job of lengthening and give

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.610 
really great job of lengthening and give
you<00:04:17.040> some<00:04:17.280> volume<00:04:17.640> as<00:04:17.820> well<00:04:18.060> I<00:04:18.450> would<00:04:19.200> say<00:04:19.410> that

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
you some volume as well I would say that

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.530 
you some volume as well I would say that
it<00:04:19.709> does<00:04:19.739> get<00:04:20.220> a<00:04:20.250> little<00:04:20.370> bit<00:04:20.610> clumpy<00:04:20.940> kind<00:04:21.450> of

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:21.540 
it does get a little bit clumpy kind of

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.750 
it does get a little bit clumpy kind of
can<00:04:21.660> get<00:04:21.810> a<00:04:21.870> little<00:04:22.109> bit<00:04:22.290> spider<00:04:22.710> lashy<00:04:23.010> but

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
can get a little bit spider lashy but

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.160 
can get a little bit spider lashy but
that's<00:04:23.970> okay<00:04:24.240> for<00:04:24.300> me<00:04:24.540> because<00:04:24.720> I<00:04:24.840> kind<00:04:25.080> of

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:25.170 
that's okay for me because I kind of

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:26.870 
that's okay for me because I kind of
like<00:04:25.350> that<00:04:25.620> effect<00:04:25.800> I<00:04:26.220> don't<00:04:26.250> know<00:04:26.490> if<00:04:26.700> you

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
like that effect I don't know if you

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.790 
like that effect I don't know if you
guys<00:04:27.090> don't<00:04:27.360> like<00:04:27.480> it<00:04:27.540> then<00:04:28.380> you<00:04:28.470> might<00:04:28.620> want

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
to stay away from it but I think it does

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.330 
to stay away from it but I think it does
a<00:04:30.180> really<00:04:30.450> good<00:04:30.600> job<00:04:30.660> and<00:04:31.050> I<00:04:31.170> like<00:04:31.380> I<00:04:31.650> really
