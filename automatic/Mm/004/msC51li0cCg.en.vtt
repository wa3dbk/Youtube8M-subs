00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:01.500 
have you ever gotten the impression when

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:02.600 
have you ever gotten the impression when
you<00:00:01.560> look<00:00:01.709> at<00:00:01.800> someone's<00:00:02.070> face<00:00:02.220> that<00:00:02.490> they

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:02.610 
you look at someone's face that they

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:04.940 
you look at someone's face that they
might<00:00:02.850> not<00:00:03.120> be<00:00:03.480> the<00:00:03.750> smartest<00:00:04.080> person<00:00:04.560> in<00:00:04.799> the

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
might not be the smartest person in the

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.340 
might not be the smartest person in the
room<00:00:05.100> turns<00:00:06.029> out<00:00:06.210> there's<00:00:06.390> actually<00:00:06.629> science

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
room turns out there's actually science

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.680 
room turns out there's actually science
to<00:00:07.740> that<00:00:07.919> researchers<00:00:08.730> have<00:00:08.940> found<00:00:09.150> that

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
to that researchers have found that

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:10.850 
to that researchers have found that
people<00:00:09.929> were<00:00:10.200> able<00:00:10.380> to<00:00:10.650> estimate

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
people were able to estimate

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.860 
people were able to estimate
intelligence<00:00:11.849> with<00:00:12.030> an<00:00:12.120> accuracy<00:00:12.540> higher

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
intelligence with an accuracy higher

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.419 
intelligence with an accuracy higher
than<00:00:13.080> chance<00:00:13.320> from<00:00:13.740> static<00:00:14.130> facial

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
than chance from static facial

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.519 
than chance from static facial
photographs<00:00:14.849> of<00:00:15.059> men<00:00:15.240> but<00:00:15.750> not<00:00:15.929> from<00:00:16.199> photos

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
photographs of men but not from photos

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.109 
photographs of men but not from photos
of<00:00:16.710> women<00:00:16.890> an<00:00:17.160> important<00:00:17.520> note<00:00:17.670> will<00:00:17.820> to<00:00:18.000> get

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
of women an important note will to get

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:19.490 
of women an important note will to get
which<00:00:18.390> will<00:00:18.570> get<00:00:18.750> back<00:00:18.900> to<00:00:19.050> a<00:00:19.080> little<00:00:19.289> later<00:00:19.410> on

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
which will get back to a little later on

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.340 
which will get back to a little later on
so<00:00:19.770> let's<00:00:20.250> bring<00:00:20.340> up<00:00:20.430> this<00:00:20.550> picture<00:00:21.350> they

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
so let's bring up this picture they

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:23.689 
so let's bring up this picture they
brought<00:00:22.529> in<00:00:22.650> college<00:00:23.070> students<00:00:23.519> and<00:00:23.640> they

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
brought in college students and they

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.160 
brought in college students and they
took<00:00:23.850> pictures<00:00:23.910> of<00:00:24.480> their<00:00:24.600> faces<00:00:24.990> making

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
took pictures of their faces making

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.650 
took pictures of their faces making
neutral<00:00:25.710> expressions<00:00:26.580> and<00:00:26.910> they<00:00:27.029> did<00:00:27.210> IQ

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
neutral expressions and they did IQ

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:28.730 
neutral expressions and they did IQ
tests<00:00:28.019> and<00:00:28.140> things<00:00:28.230> like<00:00:28.410> that

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
tests and things like that

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.439 
tests and things like that
then<00:00:29.160> they<00:00:29.310> brought<00:00:29.519> in<00:00:29.580> other<00:00:30.029> college

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
then they brought in other college

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.030 
then they brought in other college
students<00:00:30.779> all<00:00:30.929> at<00:00:30.960> Charles<00:00:31.410> University<00:00:31.439> by

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
students all at Charles University by

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.400 
students all at Charles University by
the<00:00:32.099> way<00:00:32.309> in<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.940> Czech<00:00:33.090> Republic<00:00:33.120> 40<00:00:34.079> men<00:00:34.200> and

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
the way in the Czech Republic 40 men and

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.490 
the way in the Czech Republic 40 men and
40<00:00:34.649> women<00:00:34.770> who<00:00:35.399> took<00:00:35.640> an<00:00:35.820> exam<00:00:36.510> to<00:00:36.840> gauge<00:00:37.110> on

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
40 women who took an exam to gauge on

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.650 
40 women who took an exam to gauge on
how<00:00:37.950> intelligent<00:00:38.700> and<00:00:38.850> how<00:00:38.940> attracted<00:00:39.570> they

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
how intelligent and how attracted they

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.990 
how intelligent and how attracted they
thought<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:39.989> person<00:00:40.140> were<00:00:40.590> was<00:00:41.100> then<00:00:41.850> they

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
thought the person were was then they

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.389 
thought the person were was then they
found<00:00:42.270> that<00:00:42.510> it<00:00:42.870> was<00:00:43.140> actually<00:00:43.440> statistically

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
found that it was actually statistically

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.220 
found that it was actually statistically
significant<00:00:45.120> their<00:00:45.300> estimate<00:00:45.930> of<00:00:46.079> their

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
significant their estimate of their

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.380 
significant their estimate of their
perceived<00:00:46.590> intelligence<00:00:47.219> did<00:00:47.789> actually<00:00:48.210> map

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
perceived intelligence did actually map

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:49.850 
perceived intelligence did actually map
to<00:00:48.600> some<00:00:48.780> extent<00:00:49.140> to<00:00:49.260> their<00:00:49.379> actual

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
to some extent to their actual

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.650 
to some extent to their actual
intelligence<00:00:50.760> we've<00:00:51.149> got<00:00:51.300> some<00:00:51.510> more

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
intelligence we've got some more

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.139 
intelligence we've got some more
information<00:00:51.870> why<00:00:52.350> that<00:00:52.559> might<00:00:52.739> be<00:00:52.770> but<00:00:53.670> uh<00:00:53.699> is

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
information why that might be but uh is

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.869 
information why that might be but uh is
this<00:00:54.570> surprising<00:00:55.140> I<00:00:55.649> was<00:00:56.340> surprised<00:00:56.699> by<00:00:56.850> it

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
this surprising I was surprised by it

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.420 
this surprising I was surprised by it
only<00:00:57.660> because<00:00:57.930> I<00:00:58.050> feel<00:00:58.289> like<00:00:58.350> oh<00:00:58.739> no<00:00:59.129> people

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
only because I feel like oh no people

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.130 
only because I feel like oh no people
are<00:00:59.579> gonna<00:00:59.670> have<00:00:59.789> more<00:00:59.940> evidence<00:01:00.329> to<00:01:00.420> like<00:01:00.660> be

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
are gonna have more evidence to like be

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.860 
are gonna have more evidence to like be
mean<00:01:01.440> to<00:01:01.649> others<00:01:02.120> but<00:01:03.120> it<00:01:03.270> didn't<00:01:03.629> really

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
mean to others but it didn't really

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.990 
mean to others but it didn't really
surprise<00:01:04.080> me<00:01:04.439> given<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:05.040> other<00:01:05.280> studies<00:01:05.909> that

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
surprise me given the other studies that

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.280 
surprise me given the other studies that
are<00:01:06.060> sort<00:01:06.330> of<00:01:06.360> similar<00:01:06.420> like<00:01:06.960> they've<00:01:07.110> done

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
are sort of similar like they've done

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.080 
are sort of similar like they've done
studies<00:01:07.950> that<00:01:08.070> are<00:01:08.189> crazy

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
studies that are crazy

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.109 
studies that are crazy
that<00:01:09.689> essentially<00:01:10.409> show<00:01:10.740> that<00:01:11.040> you<00:01:11.460> can<00:01:11.700> judge

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
that essentially show that you can judge

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.830 
that essentially show that you can judge
a<00:01:12.390> person's<00:01:13.080> sexual<00:01:13.470> orientation<00:01:14.570> in<00:01:15.570> like

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
a person's sexual orientation in like

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.749 
a person's sexual orientation in like
microseconds<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:17.130> if<00:01:17.250> you<00:01:17.369> just<00:01:17.549> kind<00:01:17.670> of

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
microseconds and if you just kind of

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.429 
microseconds and if you just kind of
like<00:01:17.880> use<00:01:18.030> your<00:01:18.119> intuition<00:01:18.570> because<00:01:19.200> you<00:01:19.320> can

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
like use your intuition because you can

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.380 
like use your intuition because you can
call<00:01:19.619> it<00:01:19.799> and<00:01:19.979> these<00:01:20.460> like<00:01:20.670> really<00:01:20.909> quick

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
call it and these like really quick

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.800 
call it and these like really quick
judgments<00:01:22.110> you<00:01:22.409> are<00:01:22.619> much<00:01:22.950> better<00:01:22.979> able<00:01:23.280> to

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
judgments you are much better able to

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.550 
judgments you are much better able to
decide<00:01:24.810> attorney<00:01:25.170> whether<00:01:25.380> or<00:01:25.500> not

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
decide attorney whether or not

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.260 
decide attorney whether or not
somebody's<00:01:25.890> like<00:01:26.040> gay<00:01:26.610> or<00:01:26.939> straight<00:01:27.030> or

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
somebody's like gay or straight or

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.109 
somebody's like gay or straight or
whatever<00:01:27.780> uh<00:01:28.110> just<00:01:28.829> by<00:01:28.979> looking<00:01:29.310> at<00:01:29.460> them<00:01:29.640> what

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
whatever uh just by looking at them what

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.999 
whatever uh just by looking at them what
firm<00:01:30.360> I<00:01:30.600> think<00:01:30.810> we've<00:01:30.930> all<00:01:31.079> experienced<00:01:31.770> that

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
firm I think we've all experienced that

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.410 
firm I think we've all experienced that
I<00:01:32.220> mean<00:01:32.369> I<00:01:32.430> think<00:01:32.490> that's<00:01:32.729> one<00:01:32.909> of<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.060> reasons

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
I mean I think that's one of the reasons

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.609 
I mean I think that's one of the reasons
it<00:01:33.570> seems<00:01:33.780> ridiculous<00:01:34.170> to<00:01:34.439> say<00:01:34.590> that

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
it seems ridiculous to say that

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.499 
it seems ridiculous to say that
homosexuality<00:01:35.009> is<00:01:35.579> choice<00:01:35.970> you<00:01:36.180> just<00:01:36.360> make

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
homosexuality is choice you just make

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.510 
homosexuality is choice you just make
out<00:01:36.780> boom<00:01:37.110> your<00:01:37.500> face<00:01:37.650> doesn't<00:01:38.009> change<00:01:38.220> based

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
out boom your face doesn't change based

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.999 
out boom your face doesn't change based
on<00:01:38.670> that<00:01:38.820> and<00:01:39.240> that's<00:01:39.420> true<00:01:39.930> of<00:01:39.990> everybody<00:01:40.259> but

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
on that and that's true of everybody but

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.350 
on that and that's true of everybody but
perhaps<00:01:41.220> in<00:01:41.490> this<00:01:41.579> way<00:01:41.759> it's<00:01:42.030> a<00:01:42.119> small

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
perhaps in this way it's a small

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.969 
perhaps in this way it's a small
percentage<00:01:42.930> of<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.140> explanation<00:01:43.590> and<00:01:43.950> so

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
percentage of the explanation and so

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.010 
percentage of the explanation and so
let's<00:01:44.460> get<00:01:44.610> into<00:01:44.790> why<00:01:44.970> they<00:01:45.329> think<00:01:45.600> this<00:01:45.750> might

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
let's get into why they think this might

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.899 
let's get into why they think this might
have<00:01:46.200> happened<00:01:46.229> so<00:01:46.860> faces<00:01:47.700> that<00:01:47.790> are

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
have happened so faces that are

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.460 
have happened so faces that are
perceived<00:01:48.270> as<00:01:48.390> highly<00:01:48.780> intelligent<00:01:49.110> are

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
perceived as highly intelligent are

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.160 
perceived as highly intelligent are
rather<00:01:49.770> prolonged<00:01:50.700> with<00:01:51.390> a<00:01:51.420> broader<00:01:51.689> distance

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
rather prolonged with a broader distance

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.469 
rather prolonged with a broader distance
between<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.530> eyes<00:01:52.649> a<00:01:52.979> larger<00:01:53.490> nose<00:01:53.729> a<00:01:54.000> slight

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
between the eyes a larger nose a slight

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.420 
between the eyes a larger nose a slight
upturn<00:01:54.930> to<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.229> corners<00:01:55.560> of<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:55.740> mouth<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:56.130> a

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
upturn to the corners of the mouth and a

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.850 
upturn to the corners of the mouth and a
sharper<00:01:56.909> pointing<00:01:57.509> less<00:01:57.810> rounded<00:01:58.409> chin

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
sharper pointing less rounded chin

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.190 
sharper pointing less rounded chin
by<00:01:59.700> contrast<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.420> perception<00:02:00.840> of<00:02:00.930> lower

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
by contrast the perception of lower

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.830 
by contrast the perception of lower
intelligence<00:02:01.649> is<00:02:02.100> associated<00:02:02.790> with<00:02:02.840> broader

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
intelligence is associated with broader

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.139 
intelligence is associated with broader
more<00:02:04.229> rounded<00:02:04.680> faces<00:02:05.159> with<00:02:05.310> eyes<00:02:05.460> closer<00:02:05.909> to

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
more rounded faces with eyes closer to

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.419 
more rounded faces with eyes closer to
each<00:02:06.270> other<00:02:06.479> a<00:02:06.659> shorter<00:02:07.380> nose<00:02:07.590> declining

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
each other a shorter nose declining

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.369 
each other a shorter nose declining
corners<00:02:08.940> of<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.119> mouth<00:02:09.239> and<00:02:09.509> rounded<00:02:10.289> and

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
corners of the mouth and rounded and

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.080 
corners of the mouth and rounded and
massive<00:02:10.860> chin<00:02:11.190> yeah

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
massive chin yeah

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.090 
massive chin yeah
maybe<00:02:13.050> I<00:02:13.170> should<00:02:13.440> give<00:02:13.590> the<00:02:13.709> people<00:02:13.950> watching

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
maybe I should give the people watching

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.890 
maybe I should give the people watching
us<00:02:14.340> a<00:02:14.459> few<00:02:14.640> seconds<00:02:15.030> to<00:02:15.150> finish<00:02:15.420> doing<00:02:15.630> their

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
us a few seconds to finish doing their

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:16.160 
us a few seconds to finish doing their
like

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
like

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.559 
like
estimates<00:02:16.650> of<00:02:16.770> how<00:02:16.950> like<00:02:17.459> wide<00:02:17.790> every<00:02:18.240> part<00:02:18.450> of

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
estimates of how like wide every part of

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:20.090 
estimates of how like wide every part of
it<00:02:18.720> is<00:02:18.930> that<00:02:19.110> I'm<00:02:19.260> interested<00:02:19.440> in<00:02:19.680> like<00:02:19.890> it's

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
it is that I'm interested in like it's

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.830 
it is that I'm interested in like it's
got<00:02:20.310> hits<00:02:20.490> I'm<00:02:20.610> not<00:02:20.760> I'm<00:02:20.880> not<00:02:20.910> a<00:02:21.030> guy<00:02:21.270> so<00:02:21.540> I

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
months for Lissette we've already proven

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.330 
months for Lissette we've already proven
our<00:02:42.360> intelligence<00:02:42.989> chops<00:02:43.380> or<00:02:43.620> whatever<00:02:43.830> but

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
our intelligence chops or whatever but

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.100 
our intelligence chops or whatever but
feel<00:02:44.519> free<00:02:44.730> to<00:02:44.820> analyze<00:02:45.239> us<00:02:45.480> and<00:02:45.660> do<00:02:45.750> some<00:02:45.930> sort

thinking<00:03:09.300> about<00:03:09.390> that<00:03:09.660> in<00:03:09.840> connection<00:03:10.080> with

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
thinking about that in connection with

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.559 
thinking about that in connection with
women<00:03:10.769> who<00:03:10.920> are<00:03:11.069> gonna<00:03:11.430> be<00:03:11.550> like<00:03:11.910> the<00:03:12.269> most

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569 
women who are gonna be like the most

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:15.770 
women who are gonna be like the most
feminine<00:03:12.780> yeah<00:03:13.620> and<00:03:14.100> remember<00:03:14.730> from<00:03:15.209> early<00:03:15.600> on

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
feminine yeah and remember from early on

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.539 
feminine yeah and remember from early on
and<00:03:16.110> that<00:03:16.200> this<00:03:16.290> only<00:03:16.709> worked<00:03:17.010> for<00:03:17.160> seeing

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:17.549 
and that this only worked for seeing

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:19.640 
and that this only worked for seeing
male<00:03:17.730> faces<00:03:18.299> hurlan<00:03:18.630> faces<00:03:19.170> it<00:03:19.290> didn't<00:03:19.500> work

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
male faces hurlan faces it didn't work

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.699 
male faces hurlan faces it didn't work
because<00:03:19.739> obviously<00:03:20.070> we're<00:03:20.820> like<00:03:21.000> way<00:03:21.269> smarter

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709 
because obviously we're like way smarter

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:24.620 
because obviously we're like way smarter
all<00:03:22.709> of<00:03:22.950> them<00:03:23.190> know<00:03:23.459> there's<00:03:23.700> no<00:03:23.850> variance<00:03:24.420> and

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
all of them know there's no variance and

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:25.699 
all of them know there's no variance and
what<00:03:24.720> from<00:03:24.870> one<00:03:25.019> woman<00:03:25.140> to<00:03:25.320> another

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
what from one woman to another

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:27.050 
what from one woman to another
no<00:03:26.040> I'm<00:03:26.160> kidding<00:03:26.370> but<00:03:26.640> I<00:03:26.670> found<00:03:26.940> that

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
no I'm kidding but I found that

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.420 
no I'm kidding but I found that
interesting<00:03:27.269> yeah<00:03:27.870> now<00:03:28.470> understand<00:03:29.100> that<00:03:29.220> the

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
interesting yeah now understand that the

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.220 
interesting yeah now understand that the
the<00:03:29.670> sort<00:03:29.940> of<00:03:30.000> difference<00:03:30.450> between<00:03:30.810> the<00:03:30.959> smart

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
the sort of difference between the smart

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:32.930 
the sort of difference between the smart
looking<00:03:31.560> face<00:03:31.799> and<00:03:32.100> the<00:03:32.190> dome<00:03:32.430> looking<00:03:32.790> face

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
looking face and the dome looking face

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.240 
looking face and the dome looking face
we<00:03:33.150> talked<00:03:33.360> about<00:03:33.480> that<00:03:34.019> that<00:03:34.320> is<00:03:34.590> sort<00:03:34.920> of<00:03:35.040> an

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
we talked about that that is sort of an

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.030 
we talked about that that is sort of an
exaggerated<00:03:35.940> idea<00:03:36.329> of<00:03:36.690> of<00:03:37.110> it<00:03:37.320> the<00:03:37.530> actual

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
exaggerated idea of of it the actual

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.530 
exaggerated idea of of it the actual
difference<00:03:38.430> in<00:03:38.579> intelligence<00:03:38.820> between<00:03:39.299> those

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
difference in intelligence between those

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.090 
difference in intelligence between those
is<00:03:39.660> slightly<00:03:39.870> smaller<00:03:40.019> they<00:03:40.500> they<00:03:40.680> they<00:03:40.950> make

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
is slightly smaller they they they make

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.530 
is slightly smaller they they they make
note<00:03:41.280> of<00:03:41.310> that<00:03:41.430> but<00:03:41.940> there<00:03:42.120> are<00:03:42.269> these

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
note of that but there are these

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.750 
note of that but there are these
differences<00:03:43.079> it<00:03:43.290> is<00:03:43.530> actually<00:03:44.190> able<00:03:44.370> to<00:03:44.549> be

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
differences it is actually able to be

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.150 
differences it is actually able to be
seen<00:03:44.940> in<00:03:45.120> some<00:03:45.329> faces<00:03:45.810> but<00:03:45.959> not<00:03:46.140> all<00:03:46.380> I<00:03:46.650> think

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
seen in some faces but not all I think

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.410 
seen in some faces but not all I think
that's<00:03:47.459> pretty<00:03:47.640> interesting<00:03:47.760> because<00:03:48.180> we

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
that's pretty interesting because we

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:49.699 
that's pretty interesting because we
definitely<00:03:48.630> think<00:03:49.079> that<00:03:49.290> we<00:03:49.380> can<00:03:49.530> look<00:03:49.620> at

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
definitely think that we can look at

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:50.900 
definitely think that we can look at
someone's<00:03:50.010> face<00:03:50.100> and<00:03:50.340> know<00:03:50.430> something<00:03:50.700> about

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
someone's face and know something about

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.390 
someone's face and know something about
them<00:03:51.359> like<00:03:52.260> if<00:03:52.380> you<00:03:52.500> look<00:03:52.859> at<00:03:52.980> like<00:03:53.130> you<00:03:53.280> know<00:03:53.370> a

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
them like if you look at like you know a

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.979 
them like if you look at like you know a
stereotypical<00:03:53.880> like<00:03:54.120> hillbilly<00:03:54.900> or

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
stereotypical like hillbilly or

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:55.640 
stereotypical like hillbilly or
something<00:03:55.320> like<00:03:55.410> that

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
something like that

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.349 
something like that
their<00:03:56.040> faces<00:03:56.280> look<00:03:56.489> different<00:03:57.090> than<00:03:57.239> other

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:57.359 
their faces look different than other

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:00.020 
their faces look different than other
people<00:03:57.750> for<00:03:57.930> some<00:03:58.079> reason<00:03:58.489> now<00:03:59.489> understand

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
people for some reason now understand

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.430 
people for some reason now understand
that<00:04:00.150> this<00:04:00.239> is<00:04:00.420> not<00:04:00.630> like<00:04:00.900> this<00:04:01.200> is<00:04:01.320> not

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
that this is not like this is not

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.979 
that this is not like this is not
determinative<00:04:02.250> like<00:04:02.700> just<00:04:03.150> because<00:04:03.480> you<00:04:03.750> have

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
determinative like just because you have

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:06.349 
determinative like just because you have
this<00:04:04.230> face<00:04:04.470> doesn't<00:04:04.829> matter<00:04:05.070> learn<00:04:05.459> more<00:04:05.760> but

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:06.359 
this face doesn't matter learn more but

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:08.660 
this face doesn't matter learn more but
it<00:04:06.420> is<00:04:06.540> interesting<00:04:06.810> because<00:04:07.079> does<00:04:08.070> learning

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
it is interesting because does learning

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:11.449 
it is interesting because does learning
possibly<00:04:09.450> have<00:04:09.630> some<00:04:10.079> physical<00:04:10.890> effect<00:04:11.220> on<00:04:11.370> us

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
possibly have some physical effect on us

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:12.920 
possibly have some physical effect on us
or<00:04:11.609> is<00:04:11.730> it<00:04:11.850> all<00:04:12.030> just<00:04:12.060> sort<00:04:12.540> of<00:04:12.600> predisposition

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
or is it all just sort of predisposition

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.440 
or is it all just sort of predisposition
like<00:04:13.530> you<00:04:14.010> have<00:04:14.190> this<00:04:14.400> face<00:04:14.670> and<00:04:14.940> you<00:04:15.239> have<00:04:15.420> a

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
like you have this face and you have a

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:16.490 
like you have this face and you have a
certain<00:04:15.720> amount<00:04:15.900> of<00:04:15.989> intelligence<00:04:16.289> that

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
certain amount of intelligence that

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:17.810 
certain amount of intelligence that
you're<00:04:16.709> destined<00:04:17.039> to<00:04:17.070> have<00:04:17.280> all<00:04:17.609> right<00:04:17.669> I

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
you're destined to have all right I

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.940 
you're destined to have all right I
don't<00:04:18.060> worry<00:04:18.390> I<00:04:18.539> think<00:04:18.570> another<00:04:18.930> thing<00:04:19.530> that

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:19.950 
don't worry I think another thing that

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:21.589 
don't worry I think another thing that
we<00:04:20.159> should<00:04:20.190> consider<00:04:20.580> as<00:04:20.729> well<00:04:20.940> is<00:04:21.120> how<00:04:21.150> much

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:21.599 
we should consider as well is how much

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:24.140 
we should consider as well is how much
of<00:04:21.930> our<00:04:22.340> perceptions<00:04:23.340> are<00:04:23.669> actually

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
of our perceptions are actually

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:25.830 
of our perceptions are actually
influencing<00:04:24.479> intelligence

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
influencing intelligence

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.480 
influencing intelligence
so<00:04:25.960> there's<00:04:26.199> a<00:04:26.380> ton<00:04:26.710> of<00:04:26.770> studies<00:04:27.190> with<00:04:27.340> like

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
so there's a ton of studies with like

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.300 
so there's a ton of studies with like
teachers<00:04:27.910> who<00:04:28.630> are<00:04:29.050> manipulated<00:04:29.860> in<00:04:29.980> essence

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
teachers who are manipulated in essence

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:31.590 
teachers who are manipulated in essence
and<00:04:30.430> are<00:04:30.520> told<00:04:30.699> this<00:04:30.880> is<00:04:30.940> a<00:04:31.060> smart<00:04:31.419> student

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:31.600 
and are told this is a smart student

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.810 
and are told this is a smart student
this<00:04:31.840> is<00:04:31.990> a<00:04:32.020> dumb<00:04:32.470> student<00:04:32.889> and<00:04:33.280> that<00:04:33.310> it's

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:33.820 
this is a dumb student and that it's

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:35.610 
this is a dumb student and that it's
completely<00:04:34.300> false<00:04:34.540> right<00:04:34.840> but<00:04:35.229> at<00:04:35.320> the<00:04:35.440> end<00:04:35.470> of

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
completely false right but at the end of

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.439 
completely false right but at the end of
like<00:04:35.800> the<00:04:35.919> semester<00:04:36.490> because<00:04:36.760> the<00:04:37.120> teacher

00:04:37.439 --> 00:04:37.449 
like the semester because the teacher

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:39.990 
like the semester because the teacher
has<00:04:38.020> treated<00:04:38.350> the<00:04:38.530> students<00:04:38.889> differently<00:04:39.280> the

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000 
has treated the students differently the

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.120 
has treated the students differently the
perfect<00:04:40.720> student<00:04:41.080> they<00:04:41.169> thought<00:04:41.440> was<00:04:41.740> smarter

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.130 
perfect student they thought was smarter

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:43.950 
perfect student they thought was smarter
ends<00:04:42.460> up<00:04:42.610> performing<00:04:43.150> much<00:04:43.270> better<00:04:43.300> saying
