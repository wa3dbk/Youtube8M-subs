00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:08.600
 Samsung has a completely new smartphone 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:11.619
 row baptized lifted here 

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:13.340
 we now have the galaxy a5 and the galaxy 

00:00:11.619 --> 00:00:16.340
 a3 lie 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:17.949
 seven is also announced the 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:21.259
 would then have to lie here then 

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:24.230
 diagonal in the display of 5.5 inches 

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:26.960
 here are five here are 4.5 inches 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.429
 then you have the choice in the future 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.249
 and then decide because that 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:33.230
 design is the same everywhere 

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:35.930
 that means above all things I have 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:38.149
 a metal frame around it does that 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.430
 Of course, very stable , of course 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:41.930
 just also very valent mine 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.370
 opinion so I think the design 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.219
 extremely successful with these from 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:49.489
 ground edges in front and behind 

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:52.250
 and last but not least, ultrathin 7.1 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:55.910
 millimeter in both cases and very much 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:58.579
 very easy 123 grams with a 5 counter 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:01.640
 and over here 110 grams that's for 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:03.649
 Today's conditions are extremely easy 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.230
 right wrinkle breads I find a lot 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:10.430
 very pleasant and the backs are like that 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:11.930
 roughened very slightly so also 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:15.260
 case a good grip on the fingers 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.640
 I like everything very much here 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.710
 By the way, you already have the same over there 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.660
 Seen these are the two slots once 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.240
 for the nano sense so the very whole 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:27.190
 small and over here that's the slot 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:29.420
 officially for the sd card up to 64gb 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:32.890
 But I tested it with a 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:35.900
 Sandy 128gb no problem at all 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:38.900
 internally in both cases 16 gigabytes 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:41.180
 built-in of it are still free net 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.910
 Update all preinstalled 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:46.880
 apps 10,7 this is the value with which he 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:49.400
 must calculate internally 10 7 gb net 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.230
 yes you can already 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.900
 if it is this zloty at the 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:56.210
 page then that means you can 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.560
 Do not swap the battery for me since 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.480
 I care for a long long time 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.820
 actually, the first one can think back 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:04.790
 times that samsung a replaceable 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.410
 Battery has indeed the contents with the 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.140
 time I have to say god, unfortunately 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:10.300
 the firmly installed lithium polymer 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.760
 by the way, in both cases 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:16.090
 and the big ones are 2300 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:18.970
 millennia in the small 1900's and 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:21.670
 if you relate that to the 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.320
 Display size is in both cases 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.850
 just below an average of seven 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.310
 percent below average and that 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.510
 display is the most hungry one 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.340
 Power consumers always on the 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.900
 other side they're super amoled 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.210
 displays how to get that from samsung 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:37.120
 knows and there it is usually so that 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:39.100
 the relatively energy efficient are dark 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.660
 pixel consume less energy 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.070
 they are always pretty good in the tests 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.440
 therefore cut off at the same time 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:47.380
 the two now not the big ones 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.900
 but still want to make again 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.400
 briefly show what because already in the 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.800
 still to know detail is one 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.980
 difference because over here at the a3 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.870
 At the a5 we have what samsung 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.720
 Lately know the typical 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:04.000
 diamond matrix that is the red one 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.560
 green and blue subpixels each 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.840
 to form a single image point 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.810
 they are as you can see here relatively 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:13.960
 arranged the same and also diamonds 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:16.300
 shaped rhomboid and so in theirs 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:18.580
 structure and over here at the a3 it is 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:22.840
 what else is there because it is the 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:24.540
 stripe agb matrix thus agb for red green 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.860
 blue completely clear and relatively 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:30.489
 evenly arranged almost as well as 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.810
 on a lcd but you can get away from it 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:33.130
 Do not chase down your horns now 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.690
 let it all go so well 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:38.440
 therefore we reversals in other 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:40.450
 urge is clearly more expensive here 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:44.320
 device 399 euros non-binding 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:47.739
 price recommendation and therefore 720 x 1280 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:51.209
 pixel over here 299 euros 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:54.220
 Price recommendations therefore 540 x 960 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:56.080
 pixel so what does that mean like we said 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:59.320
 Let's take a closer look 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:01.900
 I'm just looking at the writings 

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:03.610
 are relatively large you can on both 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.560
 I also read very well 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:07.750
 although actually the pixeldichte 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:12.880
 So it's pretty lean here at the a5 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:14.890
 talk was about a whopping 2 195 ppm 34 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:19.329
 percent below average and here 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:20.799
 over there are still 244 ppi 55 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:23.110
 percent below average so there 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:25.210
 both do not mess with glory 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:27.220
 Nevertheless, I think that you are there now 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.629
 should not let himself be freaked out 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:32.770
 because I now simply times 

00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:33.639
 the same photo on both and that 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:35.770
 I have to think a little bit more 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:39.310
 make it bigger so it is now 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:40.900
 I believe in the same size and 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:42.520
 if you look at such a few 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:45.069
 details look at here, for example 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:47.379
 those turrets on top of it or that 

00:04:45.069 --> 00:04:49.180
 I would like to stay here again in 

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:51.310
 an optical magnifier 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:53.800
 that you can watch it so at 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:56.349
 two is because not too much to 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:58.030
 recognize because I think I need you 

00:04:56.349 --> 00:04:59.469
 now about differences then not synonymous 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:03.789
 more upset or echauffieren 

00:04:59.469 --> 00:05:04.659
 So that's just ok with both and 

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:07.210
 above all things for this 

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:08.830
 cheap but okay not 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:09.449
 tip that one should just believe me 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:11.409
 knowledge 

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:12.759
 otherwise there is of course also 

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:15.039
 a few differences what the 

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:17.650
 equipment concerns on the one hand what the 

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:20.229
 as far as the camera is concerned here on the back 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:23.800
 because I'm the big at the a5 

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:25.779
 just under 3 10 megapixels at the small 8 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:27.940
 By the way, megapixel videos incidentally 

00:05:25.779 --> 00:05:29.889
 in full hd on and also at the 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:31.690
 front camera, it is identical again 

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:34.270
 next to it both photos with five 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:37.120
 megapixel on videos also here in 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:38.110
 full-hd hear and be amazed and do it 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.400
 Of course, everything is also important 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:42.520
 the same processor in it 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:46.360
 snapdragon 410 so the newer one 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:49.389
 means four cores is 1.2 gigahertz 

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:51.580
 now not so great has renault 306 and 

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:54.580
 over there are two gigabytes 

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:55.810
 Memory in the small 15 he is 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:57.669
 yes, as I said the smaller display 

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:59.080
 with lower resolution so must 

00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:01.029
 calculate less pixels 

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:02.860
 that's why I assume that 

00:06:01.029 --> 00:06:05.259
 probably still both in the 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:07.719
 benchmarks relatively identical cut off 

00:06:05.259 --> 00:06:08.589
 The surface is completely clear anyway 

00:06:07.719 --> 00:06:11.440
 at samsung 

00:06:08.589 --> 00:06:14.289
 it is android 4 44 from the operating system 

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:17.289
 here and I have this user interface 

00:06:14.289 --> 00:06:19.060
 which is called touchwiz know that 

00:06:17.289 --> 00:06:20.289
 We all believe in the meantime 

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:23.289
 I do not really have to do enough anymore 

00:06:20.289 --> 00:06:24.490
 to elaborate on and before some 

00:06:23.289 --> 00:06:25.419
 We have the equipment ago 

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:27.080
 full package 

00:06:25.419 --> 00:06:30.020
 lte can 

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:33.919
 yes means 150 megabits per second in the 

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:39.430
 download nominal 0 2 hspa that is in 

00:06:33.919 --> 00:06:41.900
 umts-nets 42 bluetooth 4.0 nfc 

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:44.180
 wireless lan in the way, both have 

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:47.150
 not wireless lan ac so that 

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:48.949
 currently only both because of that 

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:52.400
 land and association just know it 

00:06:48.949 --> 00:06:54.080
 at the 5 nomen est omen this is the 5th 

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:55.849
 gigahertz band also supports that 

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:57.740
 a little higher because of that not so crowded 

00:06:55.849 --> 00:07:00.229
 and at a3, that's going to be weird 

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:00.889
 the radio does not support only 2.4 

00:07:00.229 --> 00:07:03.889
 gigahertz 

00:07:00.889 --> 00:07:05.300
 why such a few details 

00:07:03.889 --> 00:07:07.159
 you should know stop in the difference 

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:09.759
 but by and large are faith 

00:07:07.159 --> 00:07:11.690
 I just two beautiful middle class 

00:07:09.759 --> 00:07:12.740
 Equipment prices you have to look like the times 

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:15.289
 develop now 

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:16.940
 they are just now coming 

00:07:15.289 --> 00:07:18.080
 in these days in the trade 

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:22.699
 that's why there is not really 

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:24.710
 street prices vp as I said 3 99 92 so 

00:07:22.699 --> 00:07:27.770
 I assume that now to start 

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:30.199
 the prices so about 380 280 so one hundred 

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:31.310
 euro difference will be so with it 

00:07:30.199 --> 00:07:32.960
 I hope you a little further 

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:34.639
 finally helped to have helped 

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:36.460
 please still so consequently main channel also 

00:07:34.639 --> 00:07:38.569
 still to subscribe and recommend 

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:41.319
 Thank you very much for your research 

00:07:38.569 --> 00:07:41.319
 bye for now 

00:07:44.529 --> 00:07:46.619
 just
