tutorial<00:00:13.349> from<00:00:14.040> modern<00:00:14.429> mixing<00:00:14.880> so<00:00:15.690> today<00:00:15.960> I

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
tutorial from modern mixing so today I

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.470 
tutorial from modern mixing so today I
wanted<00:00:16.440> to<00:00:16.500> talk<00:00:16.859> about<00:00:17.220> making<00:00:17.850> your<00:00:17.880> claps

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
wanted to talk about making your claps

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.140 
wanted to talk about making your claps
wide<00:00:18.990> and<00:00:19.410> big<00:00:19.650> and<00:00:19.949> fat<00:00:20.250> and<00:00:20.490> of<00:00:20.880> course

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
wide and big and fat and of course

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.640 
wide and big and fat and of course
that's<00:00:21.330> going<00:00:21.480> to<00:00:21.539> be<00:00:21.630> dependent<00:00:22.260> on<00:00:22.439> the

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
that's going to be dependent on the

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.679 
that's going to be dependent on the
sounds<00:00:23.039> that<00:00:23.130> you<00:00:23.189> get<00:00:23.519> but<00:00:23.970> you<00:00:24.600> know

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
sounds that you get but you know

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:25.910 
sounds that you get but you know
hopefully<00:00:24.869> this<00:00:25.170> would<00:00:25.289> be<00:00:25.380> a<00:00:25.410> good<00:00:25.590> starting

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
hopefully this would be a good starting

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.859 
hopefully this would be a good starting
point<00:00:26.099> for<00:00:26.340> you<00:00:26.460> so<00:00:27.060> I<00:00:27.090> know<00:00:27.240> like<00:00:27.660> in<00:00:27.779> the

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
point for you so I know like in the

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.810 
point for you so I know like in the
beginning<00:00:28.230> stages<00:00:28.470> of<00:00:28.619> mixing<00:00:29.130> it's<00:00:29.429> it's

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
beginning stages of mixing it's it's

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.640 
beginning stages of mixing it's it's
really<00:00:30.300> there's<00:00:30.660> a<00:00:30.720> lot<00:00:30.840> of<00:00:30.960> information<00:00:31.500> to

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
really there's a lot of information to

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.790 
really there's a lot of information to
take<00:00:32.279> in<00:00:32.340> and<00:00:32.910> it's<00:00:33.420> overwhelming<00:00:34.110> and<00:00:34.290> a<00:00:34.559> lot

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
take in and it's overwhelming and a lot

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.170 
take in and it's overwhelming and a lot
of<00:00:34.920> it<00:00:35.040> is<00:00:35.160> you<00:00:35.250> think<00:00:35.520> that<00:00:35.579> you<00:00:35.760> need<00:00:35.969> to<00:00:36.059> do

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
of it is you think that you need to do

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.940 
of it is you think that you need to do
something<00:00:36.570> to<00:00:36.690> everything<00:00:37.170> to<00:00:37.320> make<00:00:37.530> you<00:00:37.860> know

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
something to everything to make you know

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.400 
something to everything to make you know
the<00:00:38.070> track<00:00:38.340> sound<00:00:38.610> good<00:00:38.850> but<00:00:39.210> a<00:00:39.450> lot<00:00:40.079> of<00:00:40.230> that's

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
the track sound good but a lot of that's

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.660 
the track sound good but a lot of that's
actually<00:00:40.800> not<00:00:40.920> true<00:00:41.190> and<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.489> more

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
actually not true and the more

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:42.979 
actually not true and the more
experience<00:00:42.120> that<00:00:42.239> I<00:00:42.300> get<00:00:42.510> and<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.690> more<00:00:42.840> that

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
experience that I get and the more that

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.540 
experience that I get and the more that
the<00:00:43.320> more<00:00:43.469> tracks<00:00:43.739> that<00:00:43.860> I<00:00:43.950> work<00:00:44.129> on<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.399> more

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
the more tracks that I work on the more

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.119 
the more tracks that I work on the more
that<00:00:44.640> I<00:00:44.700> mix<00:00:45.059> I<00:00:45.210> actually<00:00:45.390> feel<00:00:45.870> like<00:00:46.129> I'm

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
that I mix I actually feel like I'm

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.250 
that I mix I actually feel like I'm
simplifying<00:00:47.730> my<00:00:48.090> process<00:00:48.480> a<00:00:48.510> lot<00:00:48.780> more<00:00:48.809> I'm

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
simplifying my process a lot more I'm

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.810 
simplifying my process a lot more I'm
stripping<00:00:49.620> things<00:00:49.890> away<00:00:50.219> I'm<00:00:50.340> taking<00:00:50.700> things

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
stripping things away I'm taking things

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.220 
stripping things away I'm taking things
away<00:00:51.030> I'm<00:00:51.270> getting<00:00:51.420> rid<00:00:51.690> of<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.899> unnecessary

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
away I'm getting rid of the unnecessary

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.709 
away I'm getting rid of the unnecessary
because<00:00:52.800> a<00:00:53.250> lot<00:00:53.850> of<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.030> times<00:00:54.270> you<00:00:54.420> actually

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
because a lot of the times you actually

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.869 
because a lot of the times you actually
don't<00:00:54.930> have<00:00:55.140> to<00:00:55.199> do<00:00:55.530> something<00:00:56.070> to<00:00:56.280> a<00:00:56.520> sound

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
don't have to do something to a sound

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.580 
don't have to do something to a sound
you<00:00:57.120> just<00:00:57.149> you<00:00:57.480> just<00:00:57.629> don't<00:00:57.870> it<00:00:58.109> just<00:00:58.320> you<00:00:58.440> can

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
you just you just don't it just you can

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.319 
you just you just don't it just you can
blend<00:00:58.829> it<00:00:59.010> in<00:00:59.160> and<00:00:59.399> with<00:00:59.850> a<00:00:59.879> little<00:01:00.180> bit<00:01:00.300> of

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
blend it in and with a little bit of

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:01.970 
blend it in and with a little bit of
massaging<00:01:00.899> you<00:01:00.989> can<00:01:01.140> get<00:01:01.320> it<00:01:01.410> to<00:01:01.530> sound<00:01:01.739> really

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
massaging you can get it to sound really

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.280 
massaging you can get it to sound really
good<00:01:02.250> so<00:01:03.120> in<00:01:03.359> this<00:01:03.480> case<00:01:03.750> I'm<00:01:04.019> going<00:01:04.110> to<00:01:04.170> be

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
good so in this case I'm going to be

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.899 
good so in this case I'm going to be
talking<00:01:04.619> more<00:01:04.769> about<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:05.070> concepts<00:01:05.610> about

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
talking more about the concepts about

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.969 
talking more about the concepts about
this<00:01:06.119> clap<00:01:06.479> and<00:01:06.780> how<00:01:07.049> I<00:01:07.080> got<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.470> sound<00:01:07.740> and

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
this clap and how I got the sound and

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.390 
this clap and how I got the sound and
not<00:01:08.549> so<00:01:08.880> much<00:01:09.090> about<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:10.290> tip<00:01:10.860> or<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.070> trick

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
not so much about the tip or the trick

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.310 
not so much about the tip or the trick
because<00:01:11.610> in<00:01:11.970> this<00:01:12.090> case<00:01:12.270> it's<00:01:12.540> really<00:01:12.600> really

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
because in this case it's really really

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.289 
because in this case it's really really
not<00:01:13.470> that<00:01:13.740> important<00:01:14.220> because<00:01:14.340> what<00:01:14.820> I<00:01:14.850> did<00:01:14.970> to

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
not that important because what I did to

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.899 
not that important because what I did to
make<00:01:15.450> this<00:01:15.630> sound<00:01:15.840> wider<00:01:16.170> is<00:01:16.490> you<00:01:17.490> know<00:01:17.610> it's<00:01:17.820> a

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
make this sound wider is you know it's a

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.390 
make this sound wider is you know it's a
very<00:01:17.939> very<00:01:18.509> simple<00:01:18.900> technique<00:01:19.100> but<00:01:20.100> let<00:01:20.310> me

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
very very simple technique but let me

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.740 
very very simple technique but let me
explain<00:01:20.490> to<00:01:20.850> you<00:01:20.909> why<00:01:21.090> I<00:01:21.119> did<00:01:21.330> what<00:01:21.360> I<00:01:21.509> did<00:01:21.600> and

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
explain to you why I did what I did and

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.179 
explain to you why I did what I did and
then<00:01:21.960> hopefully<00:01:22.200> you<00:01:22.409> understand<00:01:22.890> what<00:01:23.040> I<00:01:23.070> was

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
then hopefully you understand what I was

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.070 
then hopefully you understand what I was
trying<00:01:23.340> to<00:01:23.580> do<00:01:23.759> and<00:01:24.030> then<00:01:24.450> you<00:01:24.630> can<00:01:24.780> go<00:01:24.930> and

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
trying to do and then you can go and

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.460 
trying to do and then you can go and
apply<00:01:25.259> this<00:01:25.380> into<00:01:26.009> your<00:01:26.490> tracks<00:01:26.850> so<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:28.229> first

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
apply this into your tracks so the first

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.330 
apply this into your tracks so the first
thing<00:01:28.619> I<00:01:28.710> did<00:01:28.770> was<00:01:29.040> with<00:01:29.280> clap<00:01:29.520> 1<00:01:29.820> it<00:01:30.630> was

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
thing I did was with clap 1 it was

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
thing I did was with clap 1 it was
primarily<00:01:32.340> a<00:01:32.460> mono<00:01:32.759> sound<00:01:33.030> there<00:01:33.210> was<00:01:33.299> a

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
primarily a mono sound there was a

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.749 
primarily a mono sound there was a
little<00:01:33.540> bit<00:01:33.630> of<00:01:33.720> stereo<00:01:34.079> information<00:01:34.490> but<00:01:35.490> I

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
little bit of stereo information but I

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.990 
little bit of stereo information but I
felt<00:01:36.390> like<00:01:36.630> clap<00:01:37.170> 1<00:01:37.500> and<00:01:37.740> clap<00:01:38.040> 3<00:01:38.520> with<00:01:38.759> those

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
felt like clap 1 and clap 3 with those

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.420 
felt like clap 1 and clap 3 with those
together<00:01:39.630> and<00:01:39.990> both<00:01:40.200> of<00:01:40.409> those<00:01:40.530> in<00:01:40.770> stereo<00:01:41.280> it

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
together and both of those in stereo it

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.910 
together and both of those in stereo it
had<00:01:41.610> this<00:01:41.759> nice<00:01:42.150> thickening<00:01:42.840> to<00:01:43.049> it<00:01:43.200> because

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
had this nice thickening to it because

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.980 
had this nice thickening to it because
clap<00:01:44.220> 2<00:01:44.430> is<00:01:44.610> a<00:01:44.640> mono<00:01:44.970> sound<00:01:45.270> and<00:01:45.600> that<00:01:45.689> one<00:01:45.840> was

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
clap 2 is a mono sound and that one was

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.420 
clap 2 is a mono sound and that one was
kind<00:01:46.170> of<00:01:46.229> going<00:01:46.380> straight<00:01:46.740> up<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:46.890> middle<00:01:47.310> so

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
kind of going straight up the middle so

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.880 
kind of going straight up the middle so
I<00:01:47.820> figured<00:01:48.149> if<00:01:48.270> I<00:01:48.390> could<00:01:48.570> somehow<00:01:48.840> get<00:01:49.229> clap<00:01:49.560> 1

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
I figured if I could somehow get clap 1

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.969 
I figured if I could somehow get clap 1
and<00:01:50.100> clap<00:01:50.340> 3<00:01:50.820> to<00:01:51.360> co-exist<00:01:52.110> together<00:01:52.290> to<00:01:52.740> sort

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
and clap 3 to co-exist together to sort

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.340 
and clap 3 to co-exist together to sort
of<00:01:53.040> fuse<00:01:53.610> themselves<00:01:54.270> together<00:01:54.659> into<00:01:55.320> a

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
of fuse themselves together into a

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.649 
of fuse themselves together into a
stereo<00:01:55.860> sound<00:01:56.189> that<00:01:56.759> could<00:01:56.909> be<00:01:57.060> a<00:01:57.090> really

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
stereo sound that could be a really

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.330 
stereo sound that could be a really
really<00:01:57.869> good<00:01:58.020> support<00:01:58.439> for<00:01:58.890> clapping<00:01:59.250> number

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
really good support for clapping number

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.639 
really good support for clapping number
2<00:01:59.729> so<00:02:00.270> clap<00:02:00.509> number<00:02:00.840> two<00:02:01.020> would<00:02:01.110> be<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.290> mono

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
2 so clap number two would be the mono

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.370 
2 so clap number two would be the mono
source<00:02:02.040> and<00:02:02.340> then<00:02:02.820> clap<00:02:03.060> 1<00:02:03.390> and<00:02:03.600> clap<00:02:03.780> 3<00:02:04.170> would

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
source and then clap 1 and clap 3 would

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.190 
source and then clap 1 and clap 3 would
almost<00:02:04.530> be<00:02:04.860> a<00:02:04.890> stereo<00:02:05.520> layered<00:02:05.939> sound<00:02:06.420> so<00:02:06.930> that

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
almost be a stereo layered sound so that

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.960 
almost be a stereo layered sound so that
would<00:02:07.380> give<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.740> fatness<00:02:08.250> and<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.520> fullness

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
would give the fatness and the fullness

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.080 
would give the fatness and the fullness
to<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:09.360> overall<00:02:09.750> clap<00:02:10.170> sound<00:02:10.530> so<00:02:11.280> let<00:02:11.819> me<00:02:11.910> show

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
to the overall clap sound so let me show

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.520 
to the overall clap sound so let me show
you<00:02:12.150> with<00:02:12.510> clap<00:02:13.050> 3

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
you with clap 3

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.050 
you with clap 3
this<00:02:13.709> one<00:02:13.890> came<00:02:14.100> in<00:02:14.280> sterile<00:02:14.700> it's<00:02:14.850> just<00:02:14.970> the

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
this one came in sterile it's just the

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:22.820 
this one came in sterile it's just the
way<00:02:15.180> I<00:02:15.209> got<00:02:15.540> it<00:02:15.750> and<00:02:16.170> play<00:02:16.319> it<00:02:16.440> for<00:02:16.620> you<00:02:21.830> so

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
way I got it and play it for you so

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.710 
way I got it and play it for you so
that's<00:02:23.040> very<00:02:23.280> much<00:02:23.550> a<00:02:23.610> clap<00:02:23.940> sound<00:02:24.270> and<00:02:24.540> let<00:02:24.630> me

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
that's very much a clap sound and let me

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.840 
that's very much a clap sound and let me
play<00:02:24.870> clap<00:02:25.350> one<00:02:25.680> with<00:02:25.950> that<00:02:26.190> now<00:02:26.400> but<00:02:26.700> without

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
play clap one with that now but without

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:35.690 
play clap one with that now but without
the<00:02:27.209> plug-in<00:02:27.630> on<00:02:33.860> it<00:02:34.860> sounds<00:02:35.160> ok<00:02:35.400> and<00:02:35.580> this<00:02:35.640> is

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
the plug-in on it sounds ok and this is

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.370 
the plug-in on it sounds ok and this is
a<00:02:35.940> little<00:02:36.180> bit<00:02:36.300> of<00:02:36.360> a<00:02:36.450> delay<00:02:36.750> to<00:02:36.810> it<00:02:37.050> as<00:02:37.140> well<00:02:37.350> so

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
a little bit of a delay to it as well so

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.800 
a little bit of a delay to it as well so
it<00:02:37.650> kind<00:02:37.830> of<00:02:37.890> comes<00:02:38.100> after<00:02:38.640> a<00:02:38.850> tiny<00:02:39.239> bit<00:02:39.480> after

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
it kind of comes after a tiny bit after

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.930 
it kind of comes after a tiny bit after
clap<00:02:40.020> number<00:02:40.350> three<00:02:40.590> now<00:02:41.190> let<00:02:41.459> me<00:02:41.610> turn<00:02:41.760> this

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
clap number three now let me turn this

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.430 
clap number three now let me turn this
in<00:02:42.090> the<00:02:42.180> steroid<00:02:42.600> here<00:02:42.780> and<00:02:42.900> you<00:02:42.959> can<00:02:43.080> see<00:02:43.290> what

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
in the steroid here and you can see what

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:51.320 
in the steroid here and you can see what
it<00:02:43.530> sounds<00:02:43.860> like<00:02:49.790> see<00:02:50.790> how<00:02:50.910> it's<00:02:51.090> just<00:02:51.150> a

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
it sounds like see how it's just a

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.660 
it sounds like see how it's just a
little<00:02:51.660> bit<00:02:51.780> wider<00:02:52.019> well<00:02:52.560> a<00:02:52.709> lot<00:02:53.010> wider<00:02:53.310> and

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
little bit wider well a lot wider and

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.690 
little bit wider well a lot wider and
it's<00:02:53.820> way<00:02:54.209> more<00:02:54.239> full<00:02:54.840> now<00:02:55.019> it<00:02:55.170> just<00:02:55.350> has<00:02:55.470> this

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
it's way more full now it just has this

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.750 
it's way more full now it just has this
really<00:02:56.700> beefy<00:02:57.660> sound<00:02:57.959> to<00:02:58.170> it<00:02:58.319> so<00:02:59.100> now<00:02:59.130> I'll

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
really beefy sound to it so now I'll

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.790 
really beefy sound to it so now I'll
play<00:03:00.030> the<00:03:00.090> clap<00:03:00.420> number<00:03:00.750> two<00:03:00.930> in<00:03:01.080> solo<00:03:01.590> so<00:03:01.650> you

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
play the clap number two in solo so you

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:02.870 
play the clap number two in solo so you
can<00:03:01.890> hear<00:03:01.980> what<00:03:02.069> that<00:03:02.100> sounds<00:03:02.459> like<00:03:02.519> on<00:03:02.700> its

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
can hear what that sounds like on its

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:10.309 
can hear what that sounds like on its
own<00:03:06.500> and<00:03:08.330> then<00:03:09.330> now<00:03:09.660> let's<00:03:09.989> bring<00:03:10.170> in<00:03:10.290> the

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319 
own and then now let's bring in the

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:12.020 
own and then now let's bring in the
stereo<00:03:10.739> information<00:03:10.890> and<00:03:11.489> see<00:03:11.700> what<00:03:11.850> that

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
stereo information and see what that

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:20.259 
stereo information and see what that
does

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:20.269 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:23.690 

so<00:03:21.269> now<00:03:21.450> you<00:03:21.510> have<00:03:21.780> this<00:03:21.930> big<00:03:22.320> Y<00:03:22.829> clap<00:03:23.310> sound

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
so now you have this big Y clap sound

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.220 
so now you have this big Y clap sound
again<00:03:24.030> with<00:03:24.180> clap<00:03:24.420> number<00:03:24.750> two<00:03:24.900> being<00:03:25.200> the

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
again with clap number two being the

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:26.870 
again with clap number two being the
main<00:03:25.590> sound<00:03:25.980> that<00:03:26.280> you're<00:03:26.400> going<00:03:26.549> to<00:03:26.579> hear

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
main sound that you're going to hear

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.610 
main sound that you're going to hear
when<00:03:27.030> you<00:03:27.120> listen<00:03:27.390> to<00:03:27.480> the<00:03:27.600> record<00:03:27.780> and<00:03:28.110> then

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
when you listen to the record and then

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.110 
when you listen to the record and then
the<00:03:28.739> other<00:03:28.920> two<00:03:29.160> claps<00:03:29.519> or<00:03:29.700> that<00:03:29.820> that's

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
the other two claps or that that's

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.300 
the other two claps or that that's
supporting<00:03:30.840> and<00:03:31.079> that<00:03:31.590> are<00:03:31.709> supporting<00:03:32.190> that

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
supporting and that are supporting that

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:33.830 
supporting and that are supporting that
clap<00:03:32.579> and<00:03:32.790> they're<00:03:32.880> in<00:03:33.000> stereo<00:03:33.510> so<00:03:33.720> they're

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
clap and they're in stereo so they're

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.870 
clap and they're in stereo so they're
kind<00:03:34.049> of<00:03:34.140> wrapping<00:03:34.950> themselves<00:03:35.100> around<00:03:35.579> clap

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
kind of wrapping themselves around clap

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.190 
kind of wrapping themselves around clap
number<00:03:36.209> two<00:03:36.329> they're<00:03:36.540> sort<00:03:36.720> of<00:03:36.750> hugging<00:03:37.079> it

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
number two they're sort of hugging it

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.050 
number two they're sort of hugging it
making<00:03:37.530> it<00:03:37.590> sound<00:03:37.769> beefier<00:03:38.310> and<00:03:38.340> fatter<00:03:38.940> and

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
making it sound beefier and fatter and

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.750 
making it sound beefier and fatter and
fuller<00:03:39.739> so<00:03:40.739> I'm<00:03:41.160> going<00:03:41.340> to<00:03:41.400> show<00:03:41.519> you<00:03:41.579> what<00:03:41.730> I

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
fuller so I'm going to show you what I

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.490 
fuller so I'm going to show you what I
did<00:03:41.940> is<00:03:42.120> very<00:03:42.180> simple<00:03:42.750> to<00:03:42.959> get<00:03:43.140> this<00:03:43.260> in<00:03:43.410> a

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
did is very simple to get this in a

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.289 
did is very simple to get this in a
stereo<00:03:43.859> all<00:03:44.070> I<00:03:44.100> did<00:03:44.370> was<00:03:44.519> put<00:03:44.700> the<00:03:44.820> doubler<00:03:45.180> on

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 
stereo all I did was put the doubler on

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:47.479 
stereo all I did was put the doubler on
it<00:03:45.450> and<00:03:45.989> again<00:03:46.260> I'm<00:03:46.440> very<00:03:46.470> very<00:03:47.040> simple<00:03:47.400> when

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
it and again I'm very very simple when

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:49.490 
it and again I'm very very simple when
it<00:03:47.519> comes<00:03:47.790> to<00:03:47.910> what<00:03:48.030> I<00:03:48.060> do<00:03:48.180> all<00:03:48.900> I<00:03:48.959> did<00:03:49.260> was<00:03:49.380> I

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
it comes to what I do all I did was I

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:50.990 
it comes to what I do all I did was I
turned<00:03:49.739> this<00:03:49.920> hype<00:03:50.220> this<00:03:50.579> high<00:03:50.760> frequency

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
turned this hype this high frequency

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.410 
turned this hype this high frequency
shelf<00:03:51.570> here<00:03:51.780> off<00:03:52.019> and<00:03:52.380> I<00:03:52.799> left<00:03:53.180> the<00:03:54.180> left

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
shelf here off and I left the left

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:55.880 
shelf here off and I left the left
channel<00:03:54.600> and<00:03:54.780> the<00:03:54.870> right<00:03:54.930> channel<00:03:55.109> delay<00:03:55.680> in

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
channel and the right channel delay in

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:57.770 
channel and the right channel delay in
stereo<00:03:56.310> so<00:03:56.519> left<00:03:56.760> and<00:03:56.910> right<00:03:57.000> and<00:03:57.359> then<00:03:57.510> I<00:03:57.600> turn

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
stereo so left and right and then I turn

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.500 
stereo so left and right and then I turn
the<00:03:57.810> direct<00:03:58.260> signal<00:03:58.470> off<00:03:58.859> so<00:03:59.579> that<00:03:59.609> all<00:04:00.150> you're

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
the direct signal off so that all you're

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:01.970 
the direct signal off so that all you're
hearing<00:04:00.840> is<00:04:01.079> the<00:04:01.109> left<00:04:01.500> and<00:04:01.739> the<00:04:01.799> right

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
hearing is the left and the right

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.440 
hearing is the left and the right
channel<00:04:02.220> stereo<00:04:02.700> information<00:04:03.329> you're<00:04:03.420> not

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
channel stereo information you're not

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.120 
channel stereo information you're not
hearing<00:04:03.840> anything<00:04:04.079> come<00:04:04.410> up<00:04:04.560> to<00:04:04.680> Center<00:04:04.829> and

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
hearing anything come up to Center and

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.610 
hearing anything come up to Center and
the<00:04:06.000> delay<00:04:06.299> I<00:04:06.329> left<00:04:06.690> stock<00:04:06.989> and<00:04:07.230> the<00:04:07.290> two<00:04:07.440> and<00:04:07.590> I

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
the delay I left stock and the two and I

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.250 
the delay I left stock and the two and I
left<00:04:07.769> of<00:04:07.950> stock<00:04:08.190> so<00:04:08.299> again<00:04:09.299> it's<00:04:09.840> very<00:04:09.930> very

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
left of stock so again it's very very

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:11.509 
left of stock so again it's very very
simple<00:04:10.680> I'm<00:04:10.920> not<00:04:11.070> doing<00:04:11.280> anything

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 
simple I'm not doing anything

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:13.160 
simple I'm not doing anything
complicated<00:04:12.030> here<00:04:12.600> you<00:04:12.750> know<00:04:12.840> you<00:04:12.900> don't<00:04:13.079> have

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170 
complicated here you know you don't have

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:15.140 
complicated here you know you don't have
to<00:04:13.320> use<00:04:13.440> ten<00:04:13.709> plugins<00:04:14.160> to<00:04:14.370> achieve<00:04:14.670> a<00:04:14.700> stereo

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
to use ten plugins to achieve a stereo

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.330 
to use ten plugins to achieve a stereo
sound<00:04:15.450> and<00:04:15.720> it's<00:04:16.289> all<00:04:16.440> about<00:04:16.680> how<00:04:16.859> everything

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
sound and it's all about how everything

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.190 
sound and it's all about how everything
works<00:04:17.579> together<00:04:17.789> so<00:04:18.090> now<00:04:18.450> I<00:04:18.479> feel<00:04:18.840> like<00:04:18.870> clap

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
works together so now I feel like clap

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:20.990 
works together so now I feel like clap
one<00:04:19.500> two<00:04:19.769> and<00:04:19.919> three<00:04:20.190> work<00:04:20.400> a<00:04:20.519> little<00:04:20.760> bit

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
one two and three work a little bit

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.240 
one two and three work a little bit
better<00:04:21.209> together<00:04:21.450> than<00:04:21.690> did<00:04:22.049> before<00:04:22.470> and<00:04:22.740> now

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
better together than did before and now

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.219 
better together than did before and now
the<00:04:23.310> sound<00:04:23.729> the<00:04:23.970> overall<00:04:24.450> clap<00:04:24.750> sound<00:04:25.050> is<00:04:25.200> a

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:25.229 
the sound the overall clap sound is a

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:26.839 
the sound the overall clap sound is a
lot<00:04:25.500> fatter<00:04:25.800> and<00:04:26.010> a<00:04:26.099> lot

00:04:26.839 --> 00:04:26.849 
lot fatter and a lot

00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:29.360 
lot fatter and a lot
so<00:04:27.240> what<00:04:27.360> I'll<00:04:27.449> do<00:04:27.569> is<00:04:27.720> I'll<00:04:27.870> play<00:04:28.050> it<00:04:28.370> first

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
so what I'll do is I'll play it first

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:30.920 
so what I'll do is I'll play it first
I'm<00:04:29.520> going<00:04:29.639> to<00:04:29.729> play<00:04:29.910> without<00:04:30.120> the<00:04:30.419> song<00:04:30.660> on

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
I'm going to play without the song on

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.710 
I'm going to play without the song on
and<00:04:31.199> I'm<00:04:31.889> going<00:04:32.160> to<00:04:32.280> play<00:04:32.490> the<00:04:32.789> clap<00:04:33.389> number

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
and I'm going to play the clap number

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.480 
and I'm going to play the clap number
one<00:04:33.930> in<00:04:34.110> mono<00:04:34.380> and<00:04:34.710> then<00:04:34.919> I'll<00:04:35.009> turn<00:04:35.160> on<00:04:35.340> to

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
one in mono and then I'll turn on to

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.309 
one in mono and then I'll turn on to
stereo<00:04:35.910> and<00:04:36.240> then<00:04:36.720> what<00:04:36.870> I'll<00:04:36.960> do<00:04:37.080> is<00:04:37.199> I'll

00:04:37.309 --> 00:04:37.319 
stereo and then what I'll do is I'll

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:38.330 
stereo and then what I'll do is I'll
turn<00:04:37.500> the<00:04:37.590> record<00:04:37.740> on<00:04:38.009> so<00:04:38.160> you<00:04:38.220> can<00:04:38.310> hear

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
turn the record on so you can hear

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:39.650 
turn the record on so you can hear
everything<00:04:38.849> else<00:04:39.030> and<00:04:39.180> you'll<00:04:39.330> hear<00:04:39.539> the

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.660 
everything else and you'll hear the

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.210 
everything else and you'll hear the
difference<00:04:39.690> of<00:04:40.139> what<00:04:40.289> that<00:04:40.410> sounds<00:04:40.830> like<00:04:40.889> and

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
difference of what that sounds like and

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:42.800 
difference of what that sounds like and
again<00:04:41.849> you're<00:04:42.030> not<00:04:42.060> going<00:04:42.270> to<00:04:42.330> hear<00:04:42.509> a<00:04:42.539> huge

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
again you're not going to hear a huge

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:44.390 
again you're not going to hear a huge
night-and-day<00:04:43.169> difference<00:04:43.770> but<00:04:44.009> it's<00:04:44.220> all

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
night-and-day difference but it's all

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:45.860 
night-and-day difference but it's all
these<00:04:44.520> little<00:04:44.580> subtle<00:04:45.090> things<00:04:45.449> that<00:04:45.630> you<00:04:45.720> do

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
these little subtle things that you do

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:47.600 
these little subtle things that you do
to<00:04:45.900> the<00:04:46.139> mix<00:04:46.380> and<00:04:46.560> make<00:04:46.680> a<00:04:46.740> big<00:04:47.099> difference<00:04:47.250> in

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:47.610 
to the mix and make a big difference in

00:04:47.610 --> 00:05:10.990 
to the mix and make a big difference in
the<00:04:47.699> long<00:04:47.849> run<00:04:48.120> so<00:04:48.780> let's<00:04:48.900> check<00:04:49.139> this<00:04:49.259> out<00:04:49.470> now

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:11.000 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:18.129 

my<00:05:12.000> calendar<00:05:13.159> I'm<00:05:14.159> taking<00:05:14.849> a<00:05:15.060> vacation<00:05:15.300> way

way
I<00:05:25.419> was<00:05:26.379> bad

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:27.770 
I was bad

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:31.740 
I was bad
any<00:05:27.919> water<00:05:29.139> I'm

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:31.750 
any water I'm

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:38.210

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:38.220 

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:40.950 

ok<00:05:39.220> so<00:05:39.280> I<00:05:39.430> know<00:05:39.520> the<00:05:39.730> vocal<00:05:40.090> is<00:05:40.180> a<00:05:40.240> huge<00:05:40.510> focal

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:40.960 
ok so I know the vocal is a huge focal

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:42.600 
ok so I know the vocal is a huge focal
point<00:05:41.230> and<00:05:41.440> it's<00:05:41.710> a<00:05:41.800> lot<00:05:41.980> louder<00:05:42.190> than<00:05:42.370> the

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:42.610 
point and it's a lot louder than the

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:45.030 
point and it's a lot louder than the
clap<00:05:42.880> so<00:05:43.180> it<00:05:43.330> is<00:05:43.450> you<00:05:44.200> know<00:05:44.230> sort<00:05:44.530> of<00:05:44.590> drowning

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:45.040 
clap so it is you know sort of drowning

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:47.040 
clap so it is you know sort of drowning
out<00:05:45.160> the<00:05:45.280> clap<00:05:45.490> sound<00:05:45.820> but<00:05:46.060> you<00:05:46.660> should<00:05:46.930> be

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:47.050 
out the clap sound but you should be

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:48.450 
out the clap sound but you should be
able<00:05:47.110> to<00:05:47.230> hear<00:05:47.380> when<00:05:47.590> I<00:05:47.650> turn<00:05:47.830> the<00:05:47.950> doubler<00:05:48.310> on

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:48.460 
able to hear when I turn the doubler on

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:51.090 
able to hear when I turn the doubler on
for<00:05:48.700> clap<00:05:48.910> one<00:05:49.240> that<00:05:49.930> all<00:05:50.260> of<00:05:50.380> a<00:05:50.440> sudden<00:05:50.830> the

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:51.100 
for clap one that all of a sudden the

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:53.310 
for clap one that all of a sudden the
overall<00:05:51.550> clap<00:05:51.880> sound<00:05:52.210> just<00:05:52.420> got<00:05:52.480> a<00:05:52.630> lot<00:05:52.960> wider

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:53.320 
overall clap sound just got a lot wider

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:54.870 
overall clap sound just got a lot wider
and<00:05:53.650> it<00:05:53.710> filled<00:05:54.040> up<00:05:54.130> a<00:05:54.250> lot<00:05:54.430> of<00:05:54.550> empty<00:05:54.790> space

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:54.880 
and it filled up a lot of empty space

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.430 
and it filled up a lot of empty space
that<00:05:55.360> you<00:05:55.420> sort<00:05:55.660> of<00:05:55.720> hear<00:05:55.900> in<00:05:56.050> between<00:05:56.320> the

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:56.440 
that you sort of hear in between the

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:59.220 
that you sort of hear in between the
speakers<00:05:56.860> so<00:05:57.700> again<00:05:58.660> nothing<00:05:59.080> too

00:05:59.220 --> 00:05:59.230 
speakers so again nothing too

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:00.930 
speakers so again nothing too
complicated<00:05:59.590> again<00:06:00.010> I<00:06:00.130> try<00:06:00.310> to<00:06:00.340> simplify<00:06:00.910> my

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:00.940 
complicated again I try to simplify my

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:04.200 
complicated again I try to simplify my
process<00:06:01.480> as<00:06:01.630> much<00:06:01.810> as<00:06:01.870> I<00:06:02.080> possibly<00:06:02.260> can<00:06:03.210> but

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:04.210 
process as much as I possibly can but

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:06.150 
process as much as I possibly can but
again<00:06:04.270> that<00:06:04.690> should<00:06:05.050> hopefully<00:06:05.260> be<00:06:05.500> a<00:06:05.650> usable

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:06.160 
again that should hopefully be a usable

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:07.380 
again that should hopefully be a usable
technique<00:06:06.550> that<00:06:06.730> you<00:06:06.820> can<00:06:06.850> use<00:06:07.120> in<00:06:07.240> your<00:06:07.270> own

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:07.390 
technique that you can use in your own

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:10.080 
technique that you can use in your own
mixes<00:06:07.900> and<00:06:08.140> that's<00:06:08.830> it<00:06:09.040> for<00:06:09.190> now<00:06:09.370> so<00:06:09.760> hopefully

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:10.090 
mixes and that's it for now so hopefully

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:11.760 
mixes and that's it for now so hopefully
you<00:06:10.150> enjoyed<00:06:10.420> that<00:06:10.600> and<00:06:10.750> I<00:06:10.990> will<00:06:11.170> see<00:06:11.380> you<00:06:11.560> on
