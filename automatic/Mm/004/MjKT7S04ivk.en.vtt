particular<00:01:32.450> is<00:01:33.350> something<00:01:33.950> that<00:01:34.250> happens

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
particular is something that happens

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.420 
particular is something that happens
when<00:01:35.390> a<00:01:35.690> bunch<00:01:36.320> of<00:01:36.440> people<00:01:36.500> come<00:01:36.830> together<00:01:36.980> and

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
when a bunch of people come together and

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.700 
when a bunch of people come together and
produce<00:01:37.520> something<00:01:37.940> that<00:01:38.840> is<00:01:39.200> just<00:01:39.500> it's

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
produce something that is just it's

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.460 
produce something that is just it's
greater<00:01:40.070> than<00:01:40.160> the<00:01:40.370> sum<00:01:40.520> of<00:01:40.580> its<00:01:40.700> parts<00:01:40.820> and

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 
greater than the sum of its parts and

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.270 
greater than the sum of its parts and
there<00:01:42.470> isn't<00:01:42.560> really<00:01:42.710> any<00:01:42.950> other<00:01:43.100> experience

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
there isn't really any other experience

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.330 
there isn't really any other experience
I<00:01:43.610> can<00:01:43.820> think<00:01:44.000> of<00:01:44.210> that<00:01:44.830> that<00:01:45.830> produces<00:01:46.220> that

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
I can think of that that produces that

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:47.800 
I can think of that that produces that
kind<00:01:46.490> of<00:01:46.580> satisfaction<00:01:46.940> from<00:01:47.210> creating<00:01:47.720> that

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
kind of satisfaction from creating that

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.490 
kind of satisfaction from creating that
kind<00:01:48.050> of<00:01:48.260> art<00:01:49.040> with<00:01:49.729> a<00:01:50.150> bunch<00:01:51.110> of<00:01:51.200> people<00:01:51.290> the
