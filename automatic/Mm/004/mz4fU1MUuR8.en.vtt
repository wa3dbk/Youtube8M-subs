first rubber tire release now that I

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.240

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
think about it Dean McDonough me till

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.179 
think about it Dean McDonough me till
right<00:02:02.369> now<00:02:02.479> as<00:02:03.479> far<00:02:03.689> as<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:03.869> wheels<00:02:04.079> I<00:02:04.350> don't

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
right now as far as the wheels I don't

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.540 
right now as far as the wheels I don't
it<00:02:05.820> looks<00:02:05.969> okay<00:02:06.270> with<00:02:06.450> these<00:02:06.630> wheels<00:02:07.520> when<00:02:08.520> I

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
it looks okay with these wheels when I

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.609 
it looks okay with these wheels when I
show<00:02:08.759> each<00:02:08.910> of<00:02:09.030> the<00:02:09.090> wheels<00:02:09.270> of<00:02:09.569> the<00:02:09.599> next<00:02:10.200> five

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
show each of the wheels of the next five

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.630 
show each of the wheels of the next five
models<00:02:11.280> including<00:02:11.730> this<00:02:11.970> one<00:02:12.180> so<00:02:12.360> all<00:02:12.390> six

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
models including this one so all six

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.370 
models including this one so all six
if<00:02:13.760> their<00:02:13.970> new<00:02:14.120> wheels<00:02:14.330> let<00:02:14.600> me<00:02:14.690> know<00:02:14.810> really

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
if their new wheels let me know really

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.950 
if their new wheels let me know really
don't<00:02:15.590> pay<00:02:15.980> attention<00:02:16.100> to<00:02:16.460> wheels<00:02:17.240> that<00:02:17.630> much

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:17.960 
don't pay attention to wheels that much

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.520 
don't pay attention to wheels that much
if<00:02:18.260> they're<00:02:18.440> new<00:02:18.620> or<00:02:18.650> old<00:02:19.270> but<00:02:20.320> bobble<00:02:21.320> gonna

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
if they're new or old but bobble gonna

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.290 
if they're new or old but bobble gonna
there's<00:02:21.800> gonna<00:02:21.890> be<00:02:22.070> three<00:02:22.280> in<00:02:22.430> the<00:02:22.520> case<00:02:22.760> so<00:02:23.090> I

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
there's gonna be three in the case so I

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:24.850 
there's gonna be three in the case so I
think<00:02:23.450> this<00:02:23.810> one<00:02:24.020> might<00:02:24.140> be<00:02:24.200> hanging<00:02:24.590> on<00:02:24.710> the

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
think this one might be hanging on the

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.590 
think this one might be hanging on the
pegs<00:02:25.160> a<00:02:25.400> little<00:02:25.640> bit<00:02:25.760> not<00:02:26.000> exactly<00:02:26.510> a

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
pegs a little bit not exactly a

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.810 
pegs a little bit not exactly a
collector<00:02:27.440> favorite<00:02:27.860> even<00:02:28.340> though<00:02:28.520> it<00:02:28.640> does

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
collector favorite even though it does

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.210 
collector favorite even though it does
have<00:02:28.850> some<00:02:29.300> history<00:02:29.780> number<00:02:30.650> two<00:02:30.830> I<00:02:31.070> believe

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
have some history number two I believe

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.030 
have some history number two I believe
this<00:02:31.490> is<00:02:31.670> also<00:02:31.850> another<00:02:32.240> Mattel<00:02:32.750> creation<00:02:33.410> you

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
this is also another Mattel creation you

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.000 
this is also another Mattel creation you
have<00:02:34.070> the<00:02:34.550> altered<00:02:35.150> eagle<00:02:35.780> this<00:02:36.500> is<00:02:36.710> a<00:02:36.740> newer

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
have the altered eagle this is a newer

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.950 
have the altered eagle this is a newer
Mattel<00:02:37.430> casting<00:02:37.970> it<00:02:38.090> was<00:02:38.180> only<00:02:38.360> introduced<00:02:38.810> in

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:38.960 
Mattel casting it was only introduced in

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.060 
Mattel casting it was only introduced in
2012

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.070 
2012

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:43.810 
2012
there<00:02:40.820> was<00:02:40.910> a<00:02:40.940> new<00:02:41.180> model<00:02:41.510> in<00:02:41.660> 2012<00:02:42.470> I<00:02:42.790> have<00:02:43.790> a

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:43.820 
there was a new model in 2012 I have a

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:45.430 
there was a new model in 2012 I have a
couple<00:02:44.090> colors<00:02:44.360> and<00:02:44.750> that's<00:02:44.930> enough<00:02:45.200> for<00:02:45.380> me

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
couple colors and that's enough for me

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.580 
couple colors and that's enough for me
it's<00:02:45.950> kind<00:02:46.130> of<00:02:46.190> just<00:02:46.700> kind<00:02:46.910> of<00:02:46.940> odd<00:02:47.470> looks<00:02:48.470> like

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
it's kind of just kind of odd looks like

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.699 
it's kind of just kind of odd looks like
they<00:02:48.709> stuck<00:02:48.950> the<00:02:49.100> body<00:02:49.340> on<00:02:49.580> a<00:02:49.610> rail<00:02:49.910> and<00:02:50.500> but<00:02:51.500> I

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
they stuck the body on a rail and but I

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:53.380 
they stuck the body on a rail and but I
guess<00:02:51.920> that's<00:02:52.160> typical<00:02:52.610> of<00:02:52.640> drag<00:02:52.910> racing<00:02:53.239> it's

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
guess that's typical of drag racing it's

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:54.820 
guess that's typical of drag racing it's
not<00:02:53.510> unusual<00:02:53.959> for<00:02:53.989> people<00:02:54.170> come<00:02:54.620> up<00:02:54.650> with

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
not unusual for people come up with

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:58.990 
not unusual for people come up with
different<00:02:55.430> things<00:02:55.640> for<00:02:56.120> a<00:02:56.180> drag<00:02:56.660> racing<00:02:58.000> as

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
different things for a drag racing as

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.550 
different things for a drag racing as
far<00:02:59.239> as<00:02:59.330> the<00:02:59.420> wheels<00:02:59.600> that's<00:02:59.900> the<00:03:00.050> best<00:03:00.380> thing

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
far as the wheels that's the best thing

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.370 
far as the wheels that's the best thing
like<00:03:00.890> that<00:03:00.920> big<00:03:01.370> fat<00:03:01.850> meat<00:03:02.209> on<00:03:02.480> the<00:03:02.660> back<00:03:03.020> there

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:56.360 
case this one only has two per case so

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.780 
case this one only has two per case so
it<00:03:56.450> might<00:03:56.570> be<00:03:56.630> a<00:03:56.780> little<00:03:56.930> hollered<00:03:57.500> oh<00:03:57.790> yeah

00:05:34.719 --> 00:05:34.729 
but to be honest with you mm they didn't

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:37.089 
but to be honest with you mm they didn't
seem<00:05:34.910> to<00:05:34.940> sell<00:05:35.449> all<00:05:35.720> that<00:05:35.990> well<00:05:36.410> when<00:05:36.979> they

00:05:37.089 --> 00:05:37.099 
seem to sell all that well when they

00:05:37.099 --> 00:05:39.790 
seem to sell all that well when they
were<00:05:37.190> reintroduced<00:05:37.520> in<00:05:38.320> 2012<00:05:39.320> and<00:05:39.560> I<00:05:39.590> think

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:39.800 
were reintroduced in 2012 and I think

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.520 
were reintroduced in 2012 and I think
2013<00:05:40.220> for<00:05:40.639> flying<00:05:40.940> customs<00:05:41.449> maybe<00:05:42.349> it's

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:42.530 
2013 for flying customs maybe it's

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:44.469 
2013 for flying customs maybe it's
because<00:05:42.680> they<00:05:42.949> were<00:05:43.039> plastic<00:05:43.520> tired<00:05:43.849> vehicles

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:44.479 
because they were plastic tired vehicles

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:46.750 
because they were plastic tired vehicles
and<00:05:45.229> collectors<00:05:45.800> kind<00:05:46.039> of<00:05:46.130> they<00:05:46.460> don't<00:05:46.610> mind

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:46.760 
and collectors kind of they don't mind

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.070 
and collectors kind of they don't mind
paying<00:05:46.970> extra<00:05:47.210> money<00:05:47.419> if<00:05:47.630> they<00:05:47.750> getting

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:48.080 
paying extra money if they getting

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:50.020
