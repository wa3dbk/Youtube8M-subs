you can't put a neutral but for the stop

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:46.570 
you can't put a neutral but for the stop
something<00:01:45.740> like<00:01:45.830> this<00:01:45.950> really<00:01:46.100> don't<00:01:46.310> have<00:01:46.430> to

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:46.580 
something like this really don't have to

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.760 
something like this really don't have to
in<00:01:46.640> case<00:01:46.760> you<00:01:46.850> have<00:01:46.940> to<00:01:47.030> go<00:01:47.180> I<00:01:47.440> see<00:01:48.440> it's<00:01:48.560> clear

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
in case you have to go I see it's clear

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.590 
in case you have to go I see it's clear
so<00:01:48.980> just<00:01:49.190> gonna

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.429 

and<00:01:52.600> then<00:01:52.869> when<00:01:52.990> you're<00:01:53.110> going<00:01:53.140> to<00:01:53.259> shift

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:53.439 
and then when you're going to shift

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:55.230 
and then when you're going to shift
through<00:01:53.590> the<00:01:53.710> second<00:01:54.130> fare<00:01:54.369> car<00:01:54.580> for<00:01:54.880> one<00:01:55.090> that

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
through the second fare car for one that

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.399 
through the second fare car for one that
has<00:01:55.390> higher<00:01:55.570> rpms<00:01:55.960> like<00:01:56.080> this<00:01:56.229> you're<00:01:56.350> gonna

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:56.409 
has higher rpms like this you're gonna

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:57.749 
has higher rpms like this you're gonna
do<00:01:56.590> it<00:01:56.680> relatively<00:01:57.130> quick<00:01:57.310> it's<00:01:57.490> only<00:01:57.580> four

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:57.759 
do it relatively quick it's only four

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:00.030 
do it relatively quick it's only four
starting<00:01:58.030> and<00:01:58.150> stopping<00:01:58.330> really<00:01:58.950> so<00:01:59.950> I'm

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:00.040 
starting and stopping really so I'm

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.700 
starting and stopping really so I'm
going<00:02:00.159> to<00:02:00.220> put<00:02:00.369> press<00:02:00.729> on<00:02:00.850> the<00:02:00.909> clutch<00:02:01.149> and<00:02:01.710> I'm

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
going to put press on the clutch and I'm

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:04.830 
going to put press on the clutch and I'm
going<00:02:02.830> to<00:02:02.890> put<00:02:03.100> it<00:02:03.189> into<00:02:03.430> second<00:02:03.790> gear<00:02:04.000> I'm

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
going to put it into second gear I'm

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.590 
going to put it into second gear I'm
going<00:02:05.080> to<00:02:05.140> slowly<00:02:05.320> take<00:02:05.560> it<00:02:05.680> off<00:02:05.770> the<00:02:05.860> clutch

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
going to slowly take it off the clutch

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.270 
going to slowly take it off the clutch
there's<00:02:07.600> a<00:02:07.659> catch<00:02:07.930> spot<00:02:08.319> where<00:02:08.679> the<00:02:08.860> gear<00:02:09.130> will

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
there's a catch spot where the gear will

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.590 
there's a catch spot where the gear will
actually<00:02:09.610> catch<00:02:09.850> with<00:02:10.119> the<00:02:10.239> rest<00:02:10.420> of<00:02:10.539> the

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
actually catch with the rest of the

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:11.880 
actually catch with the rest of the
transmission<00:02:11.170> and<00:02:11.290> you'll<00:02:11.470> actually<00:02:11.620> feel

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
transmission and you'll actually feel

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.130 
transmission and you'll actually feel
the<00:02:12.010> car<00:02:12.190> jolt<00:02:12.760> a<00:02:12.910> little<00:02:13.150> bit<00:02:13.300> that's<00:02:13.900> where

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
the car jolt a little bit that's where

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:15.479 
the car jolt a little bit that's where
the<00:02:14.200> catch<00:02:14.350> is<00:02:14.560> if<00:02:14.739> you<00:02:14.770> actually<00:02:15.220> keep<00:02:15.370> your

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
the catch is if you actually keep your

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:17.790 
the catch is if you actually keep your
foot<00:02:15.640> just<00:02:15.819> the<00:02:15.880> tiniest<00:02:16.360> bit<00:02:16.480> on<00:02:16.870> the<00:02:17.050> gas<00:02:17.200> on

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
foot just the tiniest bit on the gas on

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:18.509 
foot just the tiniest bit on the gas on
the<00:02:17.980> gas

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:18.519 
the gas

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:20.250 
the gas
you'll<00:02:19.000> Rev<00:02:19.300> match<00:02:19.600> and<00:02:19.840> that<00:02:19.870> means<00:02:20.110> the

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
you'll Rev match and that means the

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:21.780 
you'll Rev match and that means the
gears<00:02:20.739> are<00:02:20.890> going<00:02:21.010> the<00:02:21.069> same<00:02:21.099> speed<00:02:21.310> of<00:02:21.700> the

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
gears are going the same speed of the

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.040 
gears are going the same speed of the
transmission<00:02:22.420> and<00:02:22.569> you<00:02:22.630> won't<00:02:22.780> have<00:02:22.870> any

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
transmission and you won't have any

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.559 
transmission and you won't have any
jolting<00:02:23.580> stopping<00:02:24.580> against<00:02:24.850> a<00:02:25.060> clutch<00:02:25.300> and

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
jolting stopping against a clutch and

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:30.570 
jolting stopping against a clutch and
brake<00:02:25.780> put<00:02:26.500> into<00:02:26.680> neutral<00:02:27.040> and<00:02:27.250> first<00:02:29.580> slowly

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
brake put into neutral and first slowly

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:31.949 
brake put into neutral and first slowly
take<00:02:30.850> off<00:02:30.940> my<00:02:31.120> foot<00:02:31.299> off<00:02:31.420> the<00:02:31.540> clutch<00:02:31.569> and

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
take off my foot off the clutch and

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:34.650 
take off my foot off the clutch and
press<00:02:32.200> on<00:02:32.350> that<00:02:32.440> goes<00:02:32.620> on<00:02:32.769> the<00:02:32.950> gas<00:02:33.330> go<00:02:34.330> again

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
press on that goes on the gas go again

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:41.620 
press on that goes on the gas go again
shift<00:02:34.989> the<00:02:35.049> second

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:46.000 

and<00:02:42.200> break<00:02:44.260> maybe<00:02:45.260> since<00:02:45.500> we're<00:02:45.680> going<00:02:45.800> around

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
and break maybe since we're going around

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:47.380 
and break maybe since we're going around
the<00:02:46.160> turn<00:02:46.340> and<00:02:46.550> you<00:02:46.610> slow<00:02:46.820> down<00:02:46.940> putting<00:02:47.270> into

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
the turn and you slow down putting into

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.180 
the turn and you slow down putting into
second<00:02:47.870> pressing<00:02:48.410> on<00:02:48.620> the<00:02:48.680> clutch<00:02:48.890> and<00:02:49.100> the

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
second pressing on the clutch and the

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:54.580 
second pressing on the clutch and the
brake<00:02:50.590> switching<00:02:51.590> again<00:02:52.930> and<00:02:53.930> then<00:02:54.350> we're<00:02:54.500> off

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
brake switching again and then we're off

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.950 
brake switching again and then we're off
and<00:02:54.980> now<00:02:55.970> I'm<00:02:56.060> going<00:02:56.150> to<00:02:56.240> start<00:02:56.450> doing<00:02:56.570> a<00:02:56.750> few

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:56.960 
and now I'm going to start doing a few

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.450 
and now I'm going to start doing a few
other<00:02:57.140> techniques<00:02:57.440> that<00:02:57.740> you<00:02:57.920> might<00:02:58.130> need<00:02:58.280> to

00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:58.460 
other techniques that you might need to

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:06.440 
other techniques that you might need to
know<00:02:59.560> we're<00:03:00.560> going<00:03:00.680> to<00:03:00.740> go<00:03:00.830> to<00:03:00.890> hell

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.180 

I'm<00:03:06.959> kind<00:03:07.200> of<00:03:07.260> a<00:03:07.349> hill<00:03:07.500> so<00:03:07.680> if<00:03:07.800> you<00:03:07.890> look<00:03:08.040> out

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
I'm kind of a hill so if you look out

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.309 
I'm kind of a hill so if you look out
the<00:03:08.310> window<00:03:08.760> we're<00:03:09.420> rolling<00:03:09.840> because<00:03:09.989> I'm<00:03:10.200> in

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319 
the window we're rolling because I'm in

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:12.290 
the window we're rolling because I'm in
neutral<00:03:10.459> and<00:03:11.459> when<00:03:11.670> you're<00:03:11.790> on<00:03:11.819> a<00:03:11.879> hill<00:03:12.090> that's

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
neutral and when you're on a hill that's

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:13.160 
neutral and when you're on a hill that's
something<00:03:12.569> you're<00:03:12.690> actually<00:03:12.900> gonna<00:03:12.989> have<00:03:13.050> to

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
something you're actually gonna have to

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.030 
something you're actually gonna have to
get<00:03:13.290> used<00:03:13.440> to<00:03:13.530> now<00:03:13.590> there's<00:03:13.769> a<00:03:13.830> few<00:03:13.980> different

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
get used to now there's a few different

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.100 
get used to now there's a few different
things<00:03:14.340> that<00:03:14.459> you<00:03:14.640> could<00:03:14.760> do<00:03:14.970> to<00:03:15.690> counteract

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
things that you could do to counteract

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.170 
things that you could do to counteract
this<00:03:16.590> rolling<00:03:17.010> now<00:03:17.370> one<00:03:17.670> of<00:03:17.700> the<00:03:17.790> techniques

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
this rolling now one of the techniques

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.640 
this rolling now one of the techniques
that<00:03:18.390> if<00:03:18.540> you're<00:03:18.660> on<00:03:18.750> an<00:03:18.840> extreme<00:03:19.230> Hill<00:03:19.410> like

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
that if you're on an extreme Hill like

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.740 
that if you're on an extreme Hill like
say<00:03:19.830> San<00:03:20.099> Francisco<00:03:20.580> it's<00:03:21.269> actually<00:03:21.540> put<00:03:21.660> on

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
say San Francisco it's actually put on

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.990 
say San Francisco it's actually put on
the<00:03:21.810> parking<00:03:22.019> brake<00:03:22.319> you<00:03:23.280> can<00:03:23.489> actually<00:03:23.610> start

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
the parking brake you can actually start

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.210 
the parking brake you can actually start
revving<00:03:24.360> a<00:03:24.420> little<00:03:24.690> bit<00:03:24.870> while<00:03:25.410> you<00:03:25.980> have<00:03:26.190> your

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
revving a little bit while you have your

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.509 
revving a little bit while you have your
foot<00:03:26.610> on<00:03:26.790> the<00:03:26.880> clutch<00:03:27.000> and<00:03:27.360> the<00:03:27.690> gas<00:03:28.310> here<00:03:29.310> that

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
foot on the clutch and the gas here that

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:33.890 
foot on the clutch and the gas here that
put<00:03:30.510> this<00:03:30.599> down<00:03:32.090> and<00:03:33.090> you'll<00:03:33.360> start<00:03:33.599> to<00:03:33.660> roll

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
put this down and you'll start to roll

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.809 
put this down and you'll start to roll
without<00:03:34.049> rolling<00:03:34.500> back<00:03:34.680> at<00:03:34.830> all<00:03:34.980> that's

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:35.819 
without rolling back at all that's

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:37.220 
without rolling back at all that's
actually<00:03:36.120> a<00:03:36.180> really<00:03:36.390> safe<00:03:36.660> way<00:03:36.840> to<00:03:36.870> do<00:03:37.049> it<00:03:37.140> you

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
actually a really safe way to do it you

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:43.650 
actually a really safe way to do it you
just<00:03:37.260> have<00:03:37.470> to<00:03:37.560> make<00:03:37.650> sure<00:03:37.860> that<00:03:38.010> you<00:03:38.129> don't

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.180 

all<00:03:44.660> right<00:03:44.810> so<00:03:45.050> now<00:03:45.320> we're<00:03:45.500> on<00:03:45.620> the<00:03:45.770> site<00:03:45.980> Hill

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:46.190 
all right so now we're on the site Hill

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:47.860 
all right so now we're on the site Hill
and<00:03:46.400> I'm<00:03:46.610> gonna<00:03:46.730> do<00:03:46.970> that<00:03:47.060> demonstrate<00:03:47.570> once

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
and I'm gonna do that demonstrate once

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:49.630 
and I'm gonna do that demonstrate once
again<00:03:48.140> I'm<00:03:48.950> gonna<00:03:49.070> do<00:03:49.250> it<00:03:49.310> without<00:03:49.400> the

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.640 
again I'm gonna do it without the

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.040 
again I'm gonna do it without the
parking<00:03:49.910> brake<00:03:50.060> so<00:03:50.270> basically<00:03:50.630> this<00:03:50.840> is<00:03:50.900> just

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:51.050 
parking brake so basically this is just

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:52.960 
parking brake so basically this is just
timing<00:03:51.800> you'll<00:03:52.010> get<00:03:52.130> used<00:03:52.340> to<00:03:52.460> this<00:03:52.580> there's<00:03:52.910> a

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
timing you'll get used to this there's a

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:54.280 
timing you'll get used to this there's a
car<00:03:53.150> behind<00:03:53.240> you<00:03:53.480> I<00:03:53.510> recommend<00:03:53.840> doing<00:03:54.140> the

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
car behind you I recommend doing the

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.620 
car behind you I recommend doing the
parking<00:03:54.620> brake<00:03:54.770> technique<00:03:55.160> but<00:03:55.940> start<00:03:56.300> off

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:58.630 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:02.710 

first<00:03:59.630> gear<00:04:01.030> might<00:04:02.030> roll<00:04:02.240> a<00:04:02.270> little<00:04:02.480> bit

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 
first gear might roll a little bit

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.030 
first gear might roll a little bit
that's<00:04:02.930> natural<00:04:03.940> to<00:04:04.940> accelerate<00:04:05.740> you<00:04:06.740> get<00:04:06.890> to

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
that's natural to accelerate you get to

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.210 
that's natural to accelerate you get to
about<00:04:07.250> 3,500<00:04:08.150> rpms<00:04:08.510> for<00:04:08.660> this<00:04:08.780> car<00:04:08.960> I<00:04:08.990> like<00:04:09.220> so

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
about 3,500 rpms for this car I like so

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:15.130 
about 3,500 rpms for this car I like so
if<00:04:10.280> just<00:04:10.430> second<00:04:13.570> just<00:04:14.570> driving<00:04:14.870> regular

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:15.140 
if just second just driving regular

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:16.570 
if just second just driving regular
that's<00:04:15.320> pretty<00:04:15.560> much<00:04:15.710> driving<00:04:16.010> Clark's<00:04:16.430> right

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:16.580 
that's pretty much driving Clark's right

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:18.820 
that's pretty much driving Clark's right
there
