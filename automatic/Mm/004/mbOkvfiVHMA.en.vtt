gonna be making a tutorial for Minecraft
boosters<00:00:10.469> and<00:00:11.509> let's<00:00:12.509> just<00:00:12.780> say<00:00:12.990> you<00:00:13.320> want<00:00:14.190> to

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
boosters and let's just say you want to

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.620 
boosters and let's just say you want to
take<00:00:14.429> out<00:00:14.580> this<00:00:16.130> helps<00:00:17.130> our<00:00:17.310> building<00:00:18.270> thing

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
take out this helps our building thing

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:25.750 
take out this helps our building thing
where<00:00:19.080> and<00:00:21.020> I'll<00:00:22.020> start<00:00:22.230> by<00:00:22.640> paying<00:00:23.640> tracks<00:00:24.119> on

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:25.760 
where and I'll start by paying tracks on

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.640 
where and I'll start by paying tracks on
the<00:00:26.760> building<00:00:27.090> well<00:00:27.449> from<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.199> building<00:00:28.500> down

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
the building well from the building down

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:34.990 
the building well from the building down
to<00:00:28.769> bomb<00:00:29.359> and<00:00:31.850> I'll<00:00:32.850> bring<00:00:33.000> it<00:00:33.180> all<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:33.989> way

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:35.000 
to bomb and I'll bring it all the way

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.700 
to bomb and I'll bring it all the way
over<00:00:36.000> here<00:00:36.270> and<00:00:36.750> up<00:00:37.230> here

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
over here and up here

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.490 
over here and up here
make<00:00:38.070> sure<00:00:38.309> you<00:00:38.489> pit<00:00:39.020> make<00:00:40.020> sure<00:00:40.200> you<00:00:40.320> make

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
make sure you pit make sure you make

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.740 
make sure you pit make sure you make
like<00:00:41.399> an<00:00:41.670> elevated<00:00:42.600> part<00:00:43.320> of<00:00:43.500> it<00:00:43.879> so<00:00:44.879> it<00:00:45.390> does

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
like an elevated part of it so it does

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.970 
like an elevated part of it so it does
that<00:00:45.989> that's<00:00:46.770> our<00:00:46.980> diagonal<00:00:47.370> thing<00:00:48.680> and<00:00:49.680> then

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
that that's our diagonal thing and then

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.819 
that that's our diagonal thing and then
I'll<00:00:50.250> put<00:00:50.460> our<00:00:51.260> cobblestone<00:00:52.260> block<00:00:52.530> there

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
I'll put our cobblestone block there

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.200 
I'll put our cobblestone block there
because<00:00:53.789> it<00:00:54.329> just<00:00:54.420> makes<00:00:54.899> it<00:00:55.110> you<00:00:56.100> know<00:00:56.129> so<00:00:57.090> it

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
because it just makes it you know so it

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.389 
because it just makes it you know so it
doesn't<00:00:57.239> just<00:00:57.600> like<00:00:57.780> end<00:00:58.940> and<00:01:00.980> for<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.070> pisser

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
doesn't just like end and for the pisser

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.560 
doesn't just like end and for the pisser
part<00:01:02.960> you're<00:01:03.960> gonna<00:01:04.080> want<00:01:04.460> the<00:01:05.460> tracks<00:01:05.850> right

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
part you're gonna want the tracks right

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.420 
part you're gonna want the tracks right
next<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.520> the<00:01:09.140> actual<00:01:10.140> track<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:11.010> leads<00:01:11.220> up<00:01:11.400> to

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
next to the actual track the leads up to

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.950 
next to the actual track the leads up to
the<00:01:11.610> building<00:01:13.040> you<00:01:14.040> want<00:01:14.250> to<00:01:14.369> make<00:01:14.520> sure<00:01:14.960> that

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
the building you want to make sure that

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.469 
the building you want to make sure that
this<00:01:16.200> diagonal<00:01:16.740> bit<00:01:16.890> is<00:01:17.070> next<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:17.700> a<00:01:17.759> flat<00:01:18.180> bit

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
this diagonal bit is next to a flat bit

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.840 
this diagonal bit is next to a flat bit
of<00:01:19.460> the<00:01:21.049> of<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.710> booster<00:01:23.040> and<00:01:23.220> then<00:01:23.460> you<00:01:23.640> want

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
of the of the booster and then you want

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.920 
of the of the booster and then you want
to<00:01:23.939> have<00:01:24.090> a<00:01:24.150> cart<00:01:24.600> there<00:01:26.450> and<00:01:27.450> this<00:01:27.720> is<00:01:27.780> the

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
that's where like the sort of glitch

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.340 
that's where like the sort of glitch
sing<00:01:29.880> all<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.540> glitching<00:01:30.930> sort<00:01:31.170> of<00:01:31.229> thing

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
for the rest of the booster just to make

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.280 
for the rest of the booster just to make
it<00:01:54.270> more<00:01:54.720> convenient<00:01:55.140> you<00:01:55.530> want<00:01:56.219> to<00:01:56.310> make<00:01:56.729> this

it more convenient you want to make this

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:03.380 
it more convenient you want to make this
shape<00:01:58.290> so<00:01:59.180> that<00:02:01.759> and<00:02:02.759> I'm<00:02:02.880> gonna<00:02:03.060> put<00:02:03.329> the

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
shape so that and I'm gonna put the

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.310 
shape so that and I'm gonna put the
tracks<00:02:03.600> on<00:02:03.780> it<00:02:03.899> and<00:02:04.020> so<00:02:04.140> that<00:02:04.350> when<00:02:05.250> this<00:02:05.490> car

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
tracks on it and so that when this car

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.229 
tracks on it and so that when this car
gets<00:02:07.320> boosted<00:02:07.640> it<00:02:08.640> will<00:02:08.789> just<00:02:08.910> come<00:02:09.090> up<00:02:09.209> here

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
gets boosted it will just come up here

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.170 
gets boosted it will just come up here
go<00:02:10.140> around

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
go around

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.470 
go around
and<00:02:11.810> then<00:02:12.200> come<00:02:12.500> back<00:02:12.530> on<00:02:13.129> the<00:02:13.459> truck<00:02:13.670> is<00:02:13.909> it

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
and then come back on the truck is it

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.149 
and then come back on the truck is it
was<00:02:14.629> going<00:02:14.780> on<00:02:15.019> and<00:02:15.319> then<00:02:15.590> he'll<00:02:15.739> come<00:02:15.980> back

00:02:16.149 --> 00:02:16.159 
was going on and then he'll come back

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:25.449 
was going on and then he'll come back
here<00:02:16.930> I'll<00:02:17.930> show<00:02:18.140> you<00:02:19.269> how<00:02:20.269> it<00:02:20.450> works<00:02:24.220> see<00:02:25.220> that

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
here I'll show you how it works see that

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:26.979 
here I'll show you how it works see that
will<00:02:25.610> go<00:02:25.730> all<00:02:25.849> the<00:02:25.970> way<00:02:26.000> to<00:02:26.120> the<00:02:26.269> top<00:02:26.450> and<00:02:26.720> that

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:26.989 
will go all the way to the top and that

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:29.110 
will go all the way to the top and that
one<00:02:27.200> will<00:02:27.530> go<00:02:27.680> around<00:02:28.159> there<00:02:28.519> and<00:02:28.819> come<00:02:29.090> back

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
one will go around there and come back

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.479 
one will go around there and come back
down<00:02:31.659> that's<00:02:32.659> basically<00:02:33.140> how<00:02:33.349> it<00:02:33.470> works<00:02:33.530> it

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:34.489 
down that's basically how it works it

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:38.789 
down that's basically how it works it
you<00:02:35.239> you're<00:02:35.659> gonna<00:02:35.780> want<00:02:36.049> to<00:02:36.170> make<00:02:36.489> the<00:02:37.489> hole

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:38.799 
you you're gonna want to make the hole

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:43.720 
you you're gonna want to make the hole
this<00:02:39.799> bit<00:02:41.140> well<00:02:42.140> I

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
this bit well I

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.690 
this bit well I
this<00:02:43.940> one's<00:02:44.180> 8<00:02:44.569> blocks<00:02:44.989> wide<00:02:45.799> it<00:02:46.310> works<00:02:46.489> long

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
this one's 8 blocks wide it works long

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.920 
this one's 8 blocks wide it works long
even<00:02:46.970> sorry<00:02:48.129> because<00:02:49.129> I<00:02:49.370> made<00:02:50.299> it<00:02:50.420> that<00:02:50.599> one

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
even sorry because I made it that one

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.280 
even sorry because I made it that one
because<00:02:51.349> it<00:02:51.769> the<00:02:52.459> fact<00:02:52.700> the<00:02:53.000> longer<00:02:53.510> is<00:02:53.900> the

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
because it the fact the longer is the

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.619 
because it the fact the longer is the
faster<00:02:54.709> you're<00:02:54.829> gonna<00:02:54.889> get<00:02:55.190> and<00:02:55.459> the<00:02:56.030> long<00:02:56.209> the

00:02:56.619 --> 00:02:56.629 
faster you're gonna get and the long the

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:58.179 
faster you're gonna get and the long the
longer<00:02:56.900> are<00:02:56.959> you<00:02:57.019> gonna<00:02:57.109> be<00:02:57.409> able<00:02:57.650> to<00:02:57.709> maintain

00:02:58.179 --> 00:02:58.189 
longer are you gonna be able to maintain

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:02.679 
longer are you gonna be able to maintain
a<00:02:58.670> speed<00:02:59.560> and<00:03:00.560> if<00:03:01.280> you<00:03:01.400> have<00:03:01.639> it<00:03:01.790> like<00:03:01.819> three

00:03:02.679 --> 00:03:02.689 
a speed and if you have it like three

00:03:02.689 --> 00:03:06.119 
a speed and if you have it like three
blocks<00:03:03.019> it<00:03:03.500> won't<00:03:03.790> be<00:03:04.790> that<00:03:05.450> it<00:03:05.870> wouldn't

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:06.129 
blocks it won't be that it wouldn't

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:11.440 
blocks it won't be that it wouldn't
maintain<00:03:07.129> the<00:03:07.340> speed<00:03:07.609> for<00:03:07.909> as<00:03:08.060> long<00:03:09.370> so<00:03:10.450> that's

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
maintain the speed for as long so that's

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:16.030 
maintain the speed for as long so that's
about<00:03:11.569> it<00:03:12.189> it's<00:03:13.189> quite<00:03:13.370> easy<00:03:13.579> to<00:03:13.730> make<00:03:13.879> it<00:03:15.040> it's
