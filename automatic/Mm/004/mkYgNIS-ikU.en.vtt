00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:33.070
 In 2008 the second generation of the Honda Classic will reach the Spanish market 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.310
 a polyvalent dietary a segment b of the so-called global 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:40.750
 since the brand does not sell virtually everyone 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.830
 It has been three years since the time came for the rest of the imco profile is 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:48.840
 say a redesign with aesthetic touches to update it and 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.030
 allow him to remain imprisoned for four more years competing in the market 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.870
 this rescue lynx used to incorporate a new member to the family 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:57.790
 it is already 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.790
 the hybrid version of the electric line case 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.940
 them hybrids showed up last October at the auto show of 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:05.549
 Paris 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.010
 and it was scheduled to go on sale this spring 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:11.780
 but natural disasters happened in japan 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.260
 have forced the world's largest engine consultant to change plans 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.740
 the brand has announced that the launch has had to delay the last 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.740
 quarter of 2011 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.710
 they have received a series of changes abroad 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.240
 both to update its image and to reduce its coefficient 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.040
 of aerodynamic resistance in order to improve fuel economy 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.259
 the front and rear bumpers have been redesigned and have also been 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:06.380
 retouched the headlights and grill the versions of 1 point 2 and 1 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:07.969
 4 liter point 

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:11.680
 the rear lenses have been changed with the addition of a section 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.359
 Largest red 

00:02:13.359 --> 00:02:17.870
 to offer a greater differentiation between gasoline versions the Jalil 

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:47.609
 the most notable change in the interior is the adoption of a material that 

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:51.779
 Darker dashboard and in a single color that is combined with a new fabric 

00:02:51.779 --> 00:02:54.099
 for seat upholstery 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:57.239
 the illumination of the dashboard has been unified in a single orange tone 

00:02:57.869 --> 00:03:00.889
 to offer greater contrast with the dashboard 

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:05.090
 now chrome rings are used to define the air outlets the panel 

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:08.449
 instruments and the air conditioning screen continue to be incorporated 

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:15.339
 the rear seats are completely flat to house them 

00:03:15.339 --> 00:03:17.619
 what leaves a floor very low for load 

00:03:17.619 --> 00:03:20.269
 which is only possible because of the configuration of the deposit in 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:21.469
 central position 

00:03:21.469 --> 00:03:24.749
 that uses waves and also incorporates the European incident 

00:03:25.869 --> 00:03:29.679
 the bases of the seats are introduced into the space normally occupied by the 

00:03:29.679 --> 00:03:31.179
 fuel tank 

00:03:31.179 --> 00:03:34.469
 thereby releasing useful space in the back 

00:03:34.469 --> 00:03:35.689
 this new and until today 

00:03:35.689 --> 00:03:38.960
 and also a function that allows filling the rear seats 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.960
 for greater passenger comfort 

00:03:43.869 --> 00:03:47.929
 the new jarit version will keep the practical aspects of the versions with 

00:03:47.929 --> 00:03:52.289
 conventional motor since the compact nature of the ima wave system allows 

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:57.069
 keep the flexible seats and about 300 liters of cargo capacity in the 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:00.069
 trunk 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:19.399
 the new hybrid model has the same motor unit as the minsal with the same 

00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:24.309
 petrol engine i a one-three-liter gap and the same electric motor 

00:04:24.309 --> 00:04:28.150
 in them jaime this system is combined with an automatic gearbox of 

00:04:28.149 --> 00:04:29.439
 continuous variation 

00:04:29.439 --> 00:04:34.620
 pvp and has emissions of 104 grams per kilometer 12 eyes 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:38.230
 the average fuel consumption approved this four point five liters 

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:41.229
 at 100 km 

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:46.610
 that ethics and integrates the function istmo types that takes advantage of the lighting 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:50.559
 of the speedometer to tell the driver how it affects his style of 

00:04:50.559 --> 00:04:52.749
 driving to the economy more 

00:04:52.749 --> 00:04:56.219
 The eco-assist function allows drivers to have the maximum 

00:04:56.219 --> 00:04:59.370
 economy in your vehicle in the situation is equal 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:02.730
 as well as having real-time information about the effect of the use of 

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:05.229
 brakes and accelerators the fuel expense 

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:08.229
 and in consequence of the environmental impact 

00:05:11.189 --> 00:05:15.219
 This gasoline engine proportion 88 horsepower maximum 

00:05:15.219 --> 00:05:18.219
 and 121 liters per meter of thrust torque 

00:05:18.839 --> 00:05:22.329
 but the key hybrid systems is the assistance provided by the engine 

00:05:22.329 --> 00:05:26.239
 Electricity that can help increase performance has to maintain consumption 

00:05:27.319 --> 00:05:29.680
 in figures very happy 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:34.190
 the electric motor uses coils with high-density pellets the magnet this 

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:37.570
 High performance to supply 14 horsepower 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.599
 and 78 eat five grandchildren wall meters push maximum 

00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:51.300
 honda has stung its experience in the development of the models thinks demands 

00:05:51.299 --> 00:05:54.610
 recipe and the result is the econ button 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:58.350
 when the driver or press here said vital function management system of the 

00:05:58.349 --> 00:05:59.059
 vehicle 

00:05:59.059 --> 00:06:02.409
 that adopts a specific configuration to improve the consumption of 

00:06:02.409 --> 00:06:03.650
 gas 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:06.919
 it does so without affecting safety levels or benefits 

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:09.919
 general car 

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:25.830
 to complement the launch of the country in them as authorization 

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:29.589
 conventional also offers reductions in fjord emissions 

00:06:29.589 --> 00:06:32.029
 the biggest economy 

00:06:32.029 --> 00:06:37.039
 the versions with motor of 1 2 liters and they say now 123 grams by kilometer of 

00:06:37.039 --> 00:06:38.569
 blind 

00:06:38.569 --> 00:06:42.110
 an approved consumption of fuel of 5 comadres virus in the belts 

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:48.039
 versions with a 1-point 4-liter engine have a level of emissions from 

00:06:48.039 --> 00:06:50.249
 126 grams per kilometer 

00:06:50.249 --> 00:06:54.809
 with a fuel consumption of 5 point 5 liters to 100 km in mixed cycle 

00:06:55.559 --> 00:06:58.559
 They offer us diesel engines for this mobile 

00:07:03.139 --> 00:07:07.110
 the prices for later is that they will be between 14 thousand 900 euros 

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:10.419
 and the 18 thousand 200 euros and for the adhesion jalil 

00:07:10.419 --> 00:07:13.979
 points must be added at 3 euros to the price of the finish selected 

00:07:14.589 --> 00:07:18.239
 so that starting in October, the JalÃ© version will be paid almost 

00:07:18.239 --> 00:07:21.239
 same that is paid now for the automatic change gvt
