00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
go for this one so basically it's one of

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.870 
go for this one so basically it's one of
those<00:01:07.110> match<00:01:07.439> three<00:01:08.070> games<00:01:08.460> you<00:01:08.700> have<00:01:08.820> to

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
those match three games you have to

for<00:01:12.780> them<00:01:12.900> to<00:01:12.930> pop<00:01:13.260> and<00:01:13.560> for<00:01:13.799> you<00:01:13.860> to<00:01:13.950> get

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.030 
for them to pop and for you to get
points<00:01:14.490> so<00:01:15.360> if<00:01:15.479> you<00:01:15.630> match<00:01:15.810> for<00:01:16.380> you<00:01:16.860> actually

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
points so if you match for you actually

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.090 
points so if you match for you actually
get<00:01:17.340> more<00:01:17.549> points<00:01:17.790> then<00:01:18.780> you<00:01:19.229> do<00:01:19.409> if<00:01:19.680> it's<00:01:19.890> just

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:28.579 

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:46.080 

sounds<00:01:29.579> great

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.060 

and<00:01:47.090> sometimes<00:01:47.450> the<00:01:47.600> fruits<00:01:47.840> do<00:01:48.140> combine<00:01:48.710> so

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
and sometimes the fruits do combine so

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.760 
and sometimes the fruits do combine so
that<00:01:49.250> when<00:01:49.579> they<00:01:49.729> do<00:01:49.789> pop<00:01:50.350> you<00:01:51.350> get<00:01:51.530> more
