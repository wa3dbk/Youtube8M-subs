hey does this mean the key blizzard in
today's<00:00:01.770> video<00:00:02.100> is<00:00:02.250> before-and-after<00:00:02.669> Mara

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
today's video is before-and-after Mara

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.889 
today's video is before-and-after Mara
lube<00:00:04.549> so<00:00:05.549> this<00:00:05.640> is<00:00:05.819> Mara<00:00:06.029> Lube<00:00:06.330> it's<00:00:06.540> not<00:00:06.720> like

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
lube so this is Mara Lube it's not like

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:08.509 
lube so this is Mara Lube it's not like
one<00:00:07.200> of<00:00:07.230> the<00:00:07.350> things<00:00:07.529> you'd<00:00:07.710> put<00:00:07.890> in<00:00:08.010> with<00:00:08.400> the

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
one of the things you'd put in with the

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.000 
one of the things you'd put in with the
like<00:00:08.670> a<00:00:08.700> syringe<00:00:09.120> which<00:00:09.870> is<00:00:10.230> like<00:00:10.380> Lubich<00:00:10.769> sore

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
like a syringe which is like Lubich sore

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.129 
like a syringe which is like Lubich sore
the<00:00:11.580> loop<00:00:11.730> from<00:00:11.910> the<00:00:11.969> cubicle<00:00:12.389> it's<00:00:12.900> one<00:00:13.049> of

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
the loop from the cubicle it's one of

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:14.749 
the loop from the cubicle it's one of
those<00:00:13.230> it's<00:00:13.410> much<00:00:13.860> more<00:00:14.070> runny<00:00:14.309> ER<00:00:14.429> than<00:00:14.580> that

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
those it's much more runny ER than that

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.680 
those it's much more runny ER than that
it's<00:00:15.030> white<00:00:15.750> as<00:00:16.109> you<00:00:16.440> can<00:00:16.590> see<00:00:16.800> and<00:00:17.539> all<00:00:18.539> you

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
it's white as you can see and all you

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.290 
it's white as you can see and all you
don't<00:00:18.990> need<00:00:19.260> to<00:00:19.650> like<00:00:19.859> lube<00:00:20.100> the<00:00:20.180> take<00:00:21.180> the

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
don't need to like lube the take the

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.870 
don't need to like lube the take the
cube<00:00:21.600> part<00:00:21.869> you<00:00:21.960> just<00:00:22.020> um<00:00:22.350> like<00:00:23.010> each<00:00:23.220> cube<00:00:23.550> has

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
cube part you just um like each cube has

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.300 
cube part you just um like each cube has
holes<00:00:24.150> like<00:00:24.510> this<00:00:24.750> and<00:00:25.140> you<00:00:25.650> just<00:00:25.769> put<00:00:26.099> it<00:00:26.220> in

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
holes like this and you just put it in

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.910 
holes like this and you just put it in
like<00:00:26.369> this<00:00:26.789> and<00:00:27.029> squeeze<00:00:27.869> and<00:00:28.140> let<00:00:28.320> one<00:00:28.500> let<00:00:28.800> it

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
like this and squeeze and let one let it

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.240 
like this and squeeze and let one let it
have<00:00:29.130> a<00:00:29.269> one<00:00:30.269> or<00:00:30.390> two<00:00:30.480> drops<00:00:30.720> on<00:00:31.050> this<00:00:31.740> side<00:00:32.040> and

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
have a one or two drops on this side and

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.760 
have a one or two drops on this side and
then<00:00:32.369> that<00:00:32.550> side<00:00:32.820> and<00:00:33.030> then<00:00:33.989> that's<00:00:34.710> pretty

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
then that side and then that's pretty

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.709 
then that side and then that's pretty
much<00:00:34.980> it<00:00:35.219> and<00:00:35.280> then<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:36.149> great<00:00:36.510> thing<00:00:36.690> about

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
much it and then the great thing about

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:37.310 
much it and then the great thing about
Mara<00:00:37.020> loop

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
Mara loop

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.110 
Mara loop
is<00:00:37.380> that<00:00:37.920> you<00:00:38.040> don't<00:00:38.219> have<00:00:38.370> to<00:00:38.489> do<00:00:38.670> that<00:00:38.879> much

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
is that you don't have to do that much

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.959 
is that you don't have to do that much
break-in<00:00:39.690> it's<00:00:39.899> mostly<00:00:40.440> about<00:00:40.700> maybe<00:00:41.700> one

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
break-in it's mostly about maybe one

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.630 
break-in it's mostly about maybe one
solve<00:00:42.300> on<00:00:42.570> a<00:00:42.600> 3x3<00:00:43.469> and<00:00:43.680> then<00:00:44.070> you'll<00:00:44.250> get<00:00:44.399> used

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
solve on a 3x3 and then you'll get used

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.690 
solve on a 3x3 and then you'll get used
to<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:44.879> feeling<00:00:45.180> of<00:00:45.270> Mara<00:00:45.480> lube<00:00:45.660> um<00:00:46.530> so<00:00:47.309> um

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
to the feeling of Mara lube um so um

today's video is before and after mo

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.130 
today's video is before and after mo
Mara<00:00:49.829> loop<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:50.309> so<00:00:51.030> I'm<00:00:51.449> going<00:00:51.600> to<00:00:51.660> be<00:00:51.780> doing<00:00:51.930> a

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
Mara loop and so I'm going to be doing a

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.369 
Mara loop and so I'm going to be doing a
before<00:00:52.469> and<00:00:52.530> after<00:00:52.649> on<00:00:53.010> Mara<00:00:53.579> loop<00:00:53.789> with<00:00:54.120> my

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:54.379 
before and after on Mara loop with my

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:58.849 
before and after on Mara loop with my
wit<00:00:55.379> to<00:00:55.620> version<00:00:56.160> one<00:00:56.340> in<00:00:56.550> blue<00:00:57.289> my<00:00:58.289> mo<00:00:58.559> you<00:00:58.620> way

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
wit to version one in blue my mo you way

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.150 
wit to version one in blue my mo you way
long<00:00:59.100> in<00:00:59.690> black<00:01:00.690> and<00:01:00.930> my<00:01:01.260> shank<00:01:01.530> shell<00:01:01.739> six<00:01:02.010> by

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
long in black and my shank shell six by

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.030 
long in black and my shank shell six by
six<00:01:02.430> so<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.629> solar<00:01:03.899> sync<00:01:04.140> Shang<00:01:04.470> Shang<00:01:04.619> six<00:01:04.920> by

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
six so the solar sync Shang Shang six by

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.600 
six so the solar sync Shang Shang six by
six<00:01:05.309> is<00:01:05.489> probably<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.090> most<00:01:06.659> well<00:01:07.020> known<00:01:07.049> um

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
six is probably the most well known um

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.700 
six is probably the most well known um
cube<00:01:08.610> that<00:01:08.820> is<00:01:09.060> works<00:01:09.540> for<00:01:09.780> Mara<00:01:09.990> Mara<00:01:10.470> loop

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
cube that is works for Mara Mara loop

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.070 
cube that is works for Mara Mara loop
like<00:01:10.890> every<00:01:11.220> cube<00:01:11.460> works<00:01:11.670> is<00:01:12.000> what<00:01:12.720> I've<00:01:12.810> heard

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
like every cube works is what I've heard

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.880 
like every cube works is what I've heard
but<00:01:13.710> I'm<00:01:14.580> wife<00:01:14.729> but<00:01:15.270> while<00:01:15.659> looking<00:01:15.900> at<00:01:16.080> um<00:01:16.409> six

five six morning tutorials everybody

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.080 
five six morning tutorials everybody
says<00:01:19.500> that<00:01:19.549> you<00:01:20.549> should<00:01:20.729> lube<00:01:20.880> it<00:01:21.000> with

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
says that you should lube it with

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.270 
says that you should lube it with
marleau<00:01:21.479> and<00:01:21.720> lou<00:01:21.810> bik's<00:01:22.259> because<00:01:22.920> Marlowe

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
marleau and lou bik's because Marlowe

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.580 
marleau and lou bik's because Marlowe
makes<00:01:23.520> it<00:01:23.729> go<00:01:24.000> really<00:01:24.390> really<00:01:24.630> nice<00:01:24.810> and<00:01:25.140> so

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
makes it go really really nice and so

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.920 
makes it go really really nice and so
that's<00:01:25.770> why<00:01:25.890> I'm<00:01:25.979> using<00:01:26.040> this<00:01:26.369> cube<00:01:26.640> um<00:01:27.150> so

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
that's why I'm using this cube um so

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.660 
that's why I'm using this cube um so
first<00:01:28.140> off<00:01:28.530> let's<00:01:28.560> do<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:28.979> befores<00:01:29.400> for<00:01:29.610> all

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
first off let's do the befores for all

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.060 
first off let's do the befores for all
the<00:01:29.790> cubes<00:01:30.090> for<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:30.840> wit<00:01:30.990> -<00:01:31.200> oh<00:01:31.409> it<00:01:31.650> has<00:01:31.770> a<00:01:31.829> very

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
the cubes for the wit - oh it has a very

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.990 
the cubes for the wit - oh it has a very
nice<00:01:32.610> patchy<00:01:33.030> feeling<00:01:33.479> it's<00:01:34.140> super<00:01:34.590> fast<00:01:35.000> it

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
nice patchy feeling it's super fast it

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.179 
nice patchy feeling it's super fast it
rarely<00:01:36.479> ever<00:01:36.600> locks<00:01:36.930> up<00:01:37.200> and<00:01:37.409> pops<00:01:37.650> like<00:01:37.979> I've

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
rarely ever locks up and pops like I've

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.190 
rarely ever locks up and pops like I've
never<00:01:38.400> had<00:01:38.579> a<00:01:38.610> pop<00:01:38.820> on<00:01:38.970> this<00:01:39.090> cube<00:01:39.360> Oh<00:01:39.540> might

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
never had a pop on this cube Oh might

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.569 
never had a pop on this cube Oh might
have<00:01:40.350> it<00:01:40.470> right<00:01:40.619> kind<00:01:40.950> of<00:01:41.009> tight<00:01:41.189> right<00:01:41.369> now

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
have it right kind of tight right now

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.649 
have it right kind of tight right now
and<00:01:42.270> it<00:01:42.630> can't<00:01:42.869> cut<00:01:43.290> quite<00:01:43.920> 45<00:01:44.430> and<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:45.420> reason

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
and it can't cut quite 45 and the reason

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.469 
and it can't cut quite 45 and the reason
for<00:01:45.750> that<00:01:45.810> is<00:01:46.020> that<00:01:46.200> so<00:01:46.920> like<00:01:47.189> after<00:01:47.430> I<00:01:47.640> apply

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
for that is that so like after I apply

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.929 
for that is that so like after I apply
the<00:01:48.540> Mara<00:01:48.810> lube<00:01:49.020> um<00:01:49.259> it'll<00:01:50.040> you<00:01:50.399> can<00:01:50.549> see<00:01:50.790> the

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
the Mara lube um it'll you can see the

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.719 
the Mara lube um it'll you can see the
difference<00:01:51.329> a<00:01:51.570> lot<00:01:51.990> easier<00:01:52.320> if<00:01:52.470> it's<00:01:52.590> tight<00:01:52.860> um

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
difference a lot easier if it's tight um

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.270 
difference a lot easier if it's tight um
next<00:01:54.299> is<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.720> way<00:01:54.840> long<00:01:55.079> I've<00:01:55.619> kept<00:01:55.829> this<00:01:55.950> cube

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
next is the way long I've kept this cube

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.109 
next is the way long I've kept this cube
on<00:01:56.640> regular<00:01:57.240> tensions<00:01:58.640> I've<00:01:59.640> gone<00:01:59.790> all<00:02:00.000> my

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
on regular tensions I've gone all my

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.999 
on regular tensions I've gone all my
TV's<00:02:00.479> with<00:02:00.630> this<00:02:00.780> cube<00:02:01.079> and<00:02:01.290> it's<00:02:01.560> just<00:02:01.799> really

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
TV's with this cube and it's just really

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.480 
TV's with this cube and it's just really
awesome

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:05.920 

algorithms<00:02:05.270> are<00:02:05.510> really<00:02:05.540> nicely

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930 
algorithms are really nicely

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:11.080 
algorithms are really nicely
corner-cutting<00:02:07.070> is<00:02:08.710> over<00:02:09.710> 45<00:02:10.190> on<00:02:10.550> both<00:02:10.789> sides

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
corner-cutting is over 45 on both sides

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:12.670 
corner-cutting is over 45 on both sides
that's<00:02:11.840> really<00:02:12.200> awesome

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
that's really awesome

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.170 
that's really awesome
lastly<00:02:13.520> the<00:02:13.700> 6x6<00:02:14.090> um<00:02:14.750> it<00:02:15.140> can<00:02:15.320> cut<00:02:15.770> like<00:02:16.190> that

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
lastly the 6x6 um it can cut like that

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.540 
lastly the 6x6 um it can cut like that
much<00:02:18.400> with<00:02:19.400> a<00:02:19.730> lot<00:02:19.910> of<00:02:19.940> force<00:02:20.240> and<00:02:20.510> a<00:02:20.630> lot<00:02:20.780> less

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
much with a lot of force and a lot less

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.530 
much with a lot of force and a lot less
probably<00:02:22.550> um<00:02:23.270> it<00:02:23.480> turns<00:02:23.600> terribly<00:02:24.230> um<00:02:25.540> you've

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
probably um it turns terribly um you've

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.320 
probably um it turns terribly um you've
seen<00:02:26.750> my<00:02:26.900> review<00:02:27.740> on<00:02:27.860> the<00:02:27.890> stretch<00:02:28.670> out<00:02:28.820> 6x6

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
seen my review on the stretch out 6x6

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.000 
seen my review on the stretch out 6x6
you<00:02:29.450> know<00:02:29.570> that<00:02:29.810> I<00:02:30.050> really<00:02:30.590> don't<00:02:30.740> like<00:02:30.860> this

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
you know that I really don't like this

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:32.800 
you know that I really don't like this
puzzle<00:02:31.430> um<00:02:31.640> it's<00:02:32.000> just<00:02:32.090> one<00:02:32.390> of<00:02:32.420> those<00:02:32.570> things

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
puzzle um it's just one of those things

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.770 
puzzle um it's just one of those things
that<00:02:32.959> um<00:02:33.860> your<00:02:34.459> friend<00:02:34.730> sees<00:02:34.910> you<00:02:35.030> solve<00:02:35.240> a<00:02:35.330> 6m

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
that um your friend sees you solve a 6m

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.390 
that um your friend sees you solve a 6m
at<00:02:36.050> three<00:02:36.290> by<00:02:36.380> three<00:02:36.620> and<00:02:36.800> they're<00:02:37.280> all

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
at three by three and they're all

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.250 
at three by three and they're all
impressed<00:02:37.700> and<00:02:37.970> then<00:02:38.090> you<00:02:38.180> solve<00:02:38.420> a<00:02:38.510> 6x6<00:02:38.930> and

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
impressed and then you solve a 6x6 and

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.949 
impressed and then you solve a 6x6 and
their<00:02:39.950> mind<00:02:40.220> is<00:02:40.370> like<00:02:40.580> completely<00:02:41.060> blown<00:02:41.239> it's

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
their mind is like completely blown it's

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:43.210 
their mind is like completely blown it's
just<00:02:42.140> one<00:02:42.290> of<00:02:42.380> those<00:02:42.440> things<00:02:42.709> that's<00:02:42.830> nice<00:02:43.040> to

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
just one of those things that's nice to

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.340 
just one of those things that's nice to
have<00:02:43.370> and<00:02:43.670> looks<00:02:43.850> cool<00:02:44.060> on<00:02:44.090> a<00:02:44.239> shelf<00:02:44.510> but<00:02:45.320> I

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
have and looks cool on a shelf but I

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:48.430 
have and looks cool on a shelf but I
don't<00:02:45.590> really<00:02:45.680> solve<00:02:46.040> this<00:02:46.280> on<00:02:46.580> very<00:02:47.480> often<00:02:47.810> so

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
don't really solve this on very often so

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:49.630 
don't really solve this on very often so
now<00:02:48.620> I'm<00:02:48.770> going<00:02:48.920> to<00:02:48.980> go<00:02:49.100> ahead<00:02:49.190> and<00:02:49.400> apply<00:02:49.550> the

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
now I'm going to go ahead and apply the

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.620 
now I'm going to go ahead and apply the
lube<00:02:49.880> and<00:02:50.090> I'll<00:02:50.300> be<00:02:50.420> right<00:02:50.510> back<00:02:52.120> okay<00:02:53.120> so<00:02:53.600> I

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
lube and I'll be right back okay so I

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.900 
lube and I'll be right back okay so I
just<00:02:53.690> finished<00:02:54.140> living<00:02:54.739> the<00:02:54.800> cubes<00:02:55.190> and<00:02:55.430> um<00:02:55.610> I

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
just finished living the cubes and um I

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:57.729 
just finished living the cubes and um I
haven't<00:02:56.600> even<00:02:56.660> turned<00:02:56.900> them<00:02:57.140> really<00:02:57.380> except

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 
haven't even turned them really except

00:02:57.739 --> 00:02:59.020 
haven't even turned them really except
for<00:02:57.890> when<00:02:58.010> I<00:02:58.070> was<00:02:58.130> breaking<00:02:58.430> in<00:02:58.489> the<00:02:58.580> loop<00:02:58.790> I

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
for when I was breaking in the loop I

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.660 
for when I was breaking in the loop I
didn't<00:02:59.810> home<00:03:00.020> one<00:03:00.590> solve<00:03:00.920> on<00:03:01.130> the<00:03:01.220> to<00:03:01.370> exit

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
didn't home one solve on the to exit

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.360 
didn't home one solve on the to exit
elastic<00:03:02.120> and<00:03:02.390> um<00:03:03.110> my<00:03:03.680> goodness<00:03:04.040> this<00:03:04.160> is<00:03:04.340> like

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
elastic and um my goodness this is like

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.500 
elastic and um my goodness this is like
it<00:03:04.850> feels<00:03:05.150> like<00:03:05.270> a<00:03:05.360> very<00:03:06.260> loose<00:03:06.680> cube<00:03:07.300> but<00:03:08.300> I

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
it feels like a very loose cube but I

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.570 
it feels like a very loose cube but I
know<00:03:08.570> it's<00:03:08.810> not<00:03:08.959> because<00:03:09.200> it<00:03:09.620> was<00:03:10.100> high<00:03:10.310> just

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:10.580 
know it's not because it was high just

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:12.090 
know it's not because it was high just
like<00:03:10.850> five<00:03:11.480> minutes<00:03:11.660> ago

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.100 
like five minutes ago

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.130 
like five minutes ago
um<00:03:13.100> there's<00:03:14.090> like<00:03:14.239> no<00:03:14.420> resistance<00:03:14.989> I'm

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
um there's like no resistance I'm

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.199 
um there's like no resistance I'm
turning<00:03:15.530> I<00:03:15.680> can<00:03:16.310> just<00:03:16.459> do<00:03:16.580> like<00:03:16.730> whatever<00:03:17.030> kind

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.209 
turning I can just do like whatever kind

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:22.210 
turning I can just do like whatever kind
of<00:03:17.239> moves<00:03:17.420> I<00:03:17.540> want<00:03:17.720> oh<00:03:20.290> it's<00:03:21.290> almost<00:03:21.440> so<00:03:21.950> fast

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
of moves I want oh it's almost so fast

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:29.340 
of moves I want oh it's almost so fast
that<00:03:22.519> it's<00:03:22.720> kind<00:03:23.720> of<00:03:23.870> unstable<00:03:26.530> you<00:03:27.530> just<00:03:27.739> be

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350 
that it's kind of unstable you just be

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:33.520 
that it's kind of unstable you just be
it<00:03:30.350> cuts<00:03:30.680> 45<00:03:31.459> now<00:03:31.780> let<00:03:32.780> me<00:03:32.870> do<00:03:32.959> it<00:03:33.080> to<00:03:33.260> that<00:03:33.290> one

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
it cuts 45 now let me do it to that one

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.750 
it cuts 45 now let me do it to that one
side<00:03:33.769> just<00:03:33.799> to<00:03:34.160> make<00:03:34.280> sure<00:03:34.400> that<00:03:35.890> yeah<00:03:36.950> that's

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
side just to make sure that yeah that's

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.130 
side just to make sure that yeah that's
45<00:03:38.030> on<00:03:38.299> all<00:03:38.420> sides<00:03:38.660> actually<00:03:40.540> it's<00:03:41.540> in<00:03:42.049> the

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.140 
45 on all sides actually it's in the

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:43.990 
45 on all sides actually it's in the
reverse<00:03:42.440> forgot<00:03:43.190> to<00:03:43.280> show<00:03:43.400> the<00:03:43.519> beginning<00:03:43.850> but

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
reverse forgot to show the beginning but

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.820 
reverse forgot to show the beginning but
it<00:03:44.090> was<00:03:44.180> about<00:03:44.360> here<00:03:44.540> in<00:03:44.630> the<00:03:44.720> beginning<00:03:45.019> now

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:45.830 
it was about here in the beginning now

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:48.759 
it was about here in the beginning now
it's<00:03:46.070> like<00:03:46.250> here<00:03:47.170> and<00:03:48.170> that's<00:03:48.380> a<00:03:48.500> huge

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:48.769 
it's like here and that's a huge

anything it was just kind of loud and

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.030 
anything it was just kind of loud and
annoying<00:04:14.419> it's<00:04:14.630> still<00:04:14.810> out<00:04:14.989> but

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:16.040 
annoying it's still out but

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.670 
annoying it's still out but
wow<00:04:16.340> this<00:04:16.580> is<00:04:16.760> really<00:04:17.390> good<00:04:17.660> okay<00:04:17.990> so<00:04:18.470> now<00:04:18.650> for

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:20.240 
the way along the way long has really

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:22.900 
the way along the way long has really
kept<00:04:20.450> it<00:04:20.720> some<00:04:21.020> blocky<00:04:21.440> feel<00:04:21.830> I<00:04:22.100> can<00:04:22.880> really

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:22.910 
kept it some blocky feel I can really

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:25.030 
kept it some blocky feel I can really
just<00:04:23.150> when<00:04:23.990> I'm<00:04:24.080> turning<00:04:24.350> it<00:04:24.470> I<00:04:24.590> can<00:04:24.830> still

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.040 
just when I'm turning it I can still

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.790 
just when I'm turning it I can still
feel<00:04:25.220> the<00:04:26.210> bossiness<00:04:26.600> and<00:04:27.020> the<00:04:27.200> turning<00:04:27.620> style

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 
feel the bossiness and the turning style

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.570 
feel the bossiness and the turning style
hasn't<00:04:28.220> changed<00:04:28.580> like<00:04:29.240> it<00:04:29.390> has<00:04:29.540> for<00:04:30.490> for<00:04:31.490> the

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 
hasn't changed like it has for for the

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:38.590 
hasn't changed like it has for for the
weight<00:04:31.700> too<00:04:31.900> but<00:04:32.900> it<00:04:33.140> is<00:04:33.290> a<00:04:33.530> lot<00:04:33.710> faster<00:04:33.740> I<00:04:37.600> mean

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:38.600 
weight too but it is a lot faster I mean

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:39.940 
weight too but it is a lot faster I mean
so<00:04:38.750> fast<00:04:39.020> that<00:04:39.200> I'm<00:04:39.320> starting<00:04:39.590> to<00:04:39.710> think<00:04:39.800> that

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:39.950 
so fast that I'm starting to think that

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:45.550 
so fast that I'm starting to think that
I'm<00:04:40.100> a<00:04:40.220> mighty<00:04:40.400> ferns<00:04:40.760> wrong<00:04:44.080> so<00:04:45.080> like<00:04:45.320> the<00:04:45.440> way

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:45.560 
I'm a mighty ferns wrong so like the way

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:46.900 
I'm a mighty ferns wrong so like the way
to<00:04:45.620> I<00:04:45.770> think<00:04:45.860> I<00:04:46.100> might<00:04:46.250> have<00:04:46.280> bent<00:04:46.520> into<00:04:46.730> this

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:46.910 
to I think I might have bent into this

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:47.760 
to I think I might have bent into this
now

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770 
now

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:50.140 
now
it's<00:04:48.770> really<00:04:49.010> fathoms<00:04:49.490> going<00:04:49.700> to<00:04:49.760> do<00:04:49.940> a<00:04:49.970> quick

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.150 
it's really fathoms going to do a quick

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:51.490 
it's really fathoms going to do a quick
song<00:04:50.360> so<00:04:50.570> you<00:04:50.600> guys<00:04:50.780> can<00:04:50.960> see<00:04:51.110> the<00:04:51.170> performance

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:51.500 
song so you guys can see the performance

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:58.680 
song so you guys can see the performance
um<00:04:52.220> so<00:04:52.850> you<00:04:52.940> can<00:04:53.090> see<00:04:53.410> how<00:04:56.950> it's<00:04:57.950> really<00:04:58.070> fast

00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:58.690 
um so you can see how it's really fast

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:02.170 
um so you can see how it's really fast
like<00:04:59.690> I<00:04:59.870> said<00:05:00.110> so<00:05:00.520> let's<00:05:01.520> see<00:05:01.670> how<00:05:01.790> this<00:05:01.940> is

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:02.180 
like I said so let's see how this is

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:06.760 
like I said so let's see how this is
just<00:05:02.860> reference<00:05:03.860> I<00:05:04.010> have<00:05:04.040> around<00:05:04.550> um<00:05:05.770> 21

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:06.770 
just reference I have around um 21

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:21.160 
just reference I have around um 21
seconds<00:05:07.190> maybe<00:05:09.430> there<00:05:10.430> we<00:05:10.520> go<00:05:12.070> okay<00:05:20.020> it's<00:05:21.020> hard

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:21.170 
seconds maybe there we go okay it's hard

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:42.130 
seconds maybe there we go okay it's hard
to<00:05:21.350> see<00:05:21.530> through<00:05:21.710> the<00:05:21.830> viewfinder<00:05:21.980> so<00:05:40.990> I<00:05:41.990> was

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:42.140 
to see through the viewfinder so I was

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:44.110 
to see through the viewfinder so I was
25<00:05:42.440> seconds<00:05:42.710> solve<00:05:42.950> through<00:05:43.790> the<00:05:43.940> viewfinder

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:44.120 
25 seconds solve through the viewfinder

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.990 
25 seconds solve through the viewfinder
which<00:05:44.600> is<00:05:44.870> some<00:05:45.200> pretty<00:05:45.620> good<00:05:45.860> for<00:05:46.130> me<00:05:46.280> um

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:47.000 
which is some pretty good for me um

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.540 
which is some pretty good for me um
little<00:05:47.480> situation<00:05:48.160> so<00:05:49.160> um<00:05:49.340> yeah<00:05:49.460> that's

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:49.550 
little situation so um yeah that's

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:51.070 
little situation so um yeah that's
pretty<00:05:49.730> much<00:05:49.850> it<00:05:50.090> for<00:05:50.120> the<00:05:50.420> way<00:05:50.570> long<00:05:50.780> thing<00:05:50.990> I

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:51.080 
pretty much it for the way long thing I

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:52.270 
pretty much it for the way long thing I
forgot<00:05:51.200> to<00:05:51.350> mention<00:05:51.440> about<00:05:51.740> more<00:05:51.950> loop<00:05:52.160> is

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:52.280 
forgot to mention about more loop is

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:54.730 
forgot to mention about more loop is
that<00:05:52.310> it<00:05:52.520> wears<00:05:52.670> off<00:05:52.900> pretty<00:05:53.900> quickly<00:05:54.170> so<00:05:54.320> on

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:54.740 
that it wears off pretty quickly so on

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:57.400 
that it wears off pretty quickly so on
I'm<00:05:55.100> sure<00:05:55.400> that<00:05:55.550> I'll<00:05:55.640> be<00:05:55.960> reliving<00:05:56.960> these<00:05:57.110> all

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:57.410 
I'm sure that I'll be reliving these all

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:00.760 
I'm sure that I'll be reliving these all
these<00:05:58.000> both<00:05:59.000> of<00:05:59.150> these<00:05:59.180> at<00:05:59.390> least<00:05:59.570> um<00:06:00.260> after

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:00.770 
these both of these at least um after

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:05.110 
these both of these at least um after
they<00:06:01.070> wear<00:06:01.220> off<00:06:01.340> and<00:06:02.210> so<00:06:02.450> for<00:06:02.630> the<00:06:02.690> 6x6<00:06:03.400> um<00:06:04.400> it's

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:05.120 
they wear off and so for the 6x6 um it's

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:08.310 
they wear off and so for the 6x6 um it's
been<00:06:05.300> it's<00:06:05.570> smoother<00:06:05.990> I<00:06:06.640> mean<00:06:07.640> it's<00:06:08.120> not

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:08.320 
been it's smoother I mean it's not

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:11.950 
been it's smoother I mean it's not
faster<00:06:09.400> but<00:06:10.400> it<00:06:10.490> is<00:06:10.610> faster<00:06:11.000> but<00:06:11.180> I<00:06:11.450> mean

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:11.960 
faster but it is faster but I mean

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:16.690 
faster but it is faster but I mean
turning<00:06:12.200> it<00:06:13.420> it<00:06:14.420> just<00:06:14.600> feels<00:06:14.900> like<00:06:15.520> it<00:06:16.520> just

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:16.700 
turning it it just feels like it just

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:20.170 
turning it it just feels like it just
feels<00:06:16.790> better<00:06:17.030> turning<00:06:17.450> it<00:06:17.570> I<00:06:17.750> mean<00:06:18.440> I<00:06:18.910> did<00:06:19.910> get

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:20.180 
feels better turning it I mean I did get

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:23.380 
feels better turning it I mean I did get
a<00:06:20.390> lot<00:06:20.750> of<00:06:20.900> loop<00:06:21.050> inside<00:06:21.440> and<00:06:22.190> I<00:06:22.880> did<00:06:23.030> get<00:06:23.180> a<00:06:23.240> lot

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:23.390 
a lot of loop inside and I did get a lot

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:28.350 
a lot of loop inside and I did get a lot
of<00:06:23.480> Lube<00:06:23.600> on<00:06:23.690> the<00:06:23.780> outside<00:06:24.050> as<00:06:24.140> well<00:06:24.290> but

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:02.500 
guys before and after Mario Lube my

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:04.140 
guys before and after Mario Lube my
final<00:07:02.919> impressions<00:07:03.040> on<00:07:03.460> my<00:07:03.580> Lube<00:07:03.820> is<00:07:03.940> that<00:07:04.060> it

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:09.010 
the tension between the pieces so unlike

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:13.740 
the tension between the pieces so unlike
the<00:07:09.130> wit<00:07:09.250> to<00:07:09.280> um<00:07:10.180> a<00:07:10.570> scratchy<00:07:11.440> and<00:07:12.210> it<00:07:13.210> still

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:13.750 
the wit to um a scratchy and it still

the wit to um a scratchy and it still
retains<00:07:14.050> that<00:07:14.169> you<00:07:14.320> still<00:07:14.650> retain<00:07:14.770> the<00:07:14.980> same

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:17.230 
feeling on on three by threes or at

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:20.250 
feeling on on three by threes or at
least<00:07:17.380> the<00:07:17.500> way<00:07:17.590> long<00:07:18.419> and<00:07:19.419> the<00:07:19.630> last<00:07:19.810> thing<00:07:20.080> is
