to<00:00:55.370> do<00:00:55.489> a<00:00:55.520> Pokemon<00:00:56.120> of<00:00:56.210> the<00:00:56.270> week<00:00:56.420> on<00:00:56.600> that

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 
to do a Pokemon of the week on that

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.600 
to do a Pokemon of the week on that
maybe<00:00:57.050> it<00:00:57.170> is<00:00:57.290> a<00:00:57.320> love<00:00:57.800> disk<00:00:58.040> or<00:00:58.219> something<00:00:58.489> but

maybe it is a love disk or something but
even<00:00:58.790> that<00:00:59.000> I<00:00:59.180> think<00:00:59.420> could<00:00:59.510> use<00:00:59.690> a<00:00:59.719> water

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:00.110 
even that I think could use a water

even that I think could use a water
pulse<00:01:00.380> this<00:01:01.340> doesn't<00:01:01.700> even<00:01:01.910> have<00:01:02.300> any<00:01:02.600> real

what a flimsy set you have to work with

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:39.850 
what a flimsy set you have to work with
here<00:01:37.909> it's<00:01:38.060> Wyatt<00:01:38.330> I<00:01:38.720> don't<00:01:39.350> think<00:01:39.619> that<00:01:39.680> even

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860 
here it's Wyatt I don't think that even

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:41.760 
here it's Wyatt I don't think that even
though<00:01:40.100> we're<00:01:40.310> in<00:01:40.340> the<00:01:40.430> X&amp;Y<00:01:40.820> 6th<00:01:41.450> generation

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
though we're in the X&amp;Y 6th generation

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.490 
though we're in the X&amp;Y 6th generation
it<00:01:42.770> will<00:01:42.950> change<00:01:42.979> from<00:01:43.729> tier<00:01:44.150> barely<00:01:44.990> used<00:01:45.290> to

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
it will change from tier barely used to

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.950 
it will change from tier barely used to
anything<00:01:45.770> higher<00:01:46.310> because<00:01:46.670> quite<00:01:47.390> frankly<00:01:47.450> it

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
anything higher because quite frankly it

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.410 
anything higher because quite frankly it
could<00:01:48.439> be<00:01:48.590> even<00:01:48.710> demoted<00:01:49.369> one<00:01:49.400> because<00:01:50.030> it

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
could be even demoted one because it

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.890 
could be even demoted one because it
lost<00:01:50.659> tickle<00:01:51.229> somehow<00:01:51.650> unless<00:01:52.070> surbhi<00:01:52.900> did

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119 
not put it in there for some reason or I

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:58.810 
not put it in there for some reason or I
overlooked<00:01:56.750> it<00:01:56.960> which<00:01:57.350> I<00:01:57.650> thoroughly<00:01:58.369> checked

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
overlooked it which I thoroughly checked

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:06.039 
that's interesting that's a little sad
so<00:02:04.310> what<00:02:04.670> tickle<00:02:05.000> did<00:02:05.210> in<00:02:05.390> past<00:02:05.840> generations

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:06.049 
so what tickle did in past generations

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:08.259 
so what tickle did in past generations
was<00:02:06.710> lower<00:02:07.040> your<00:02:07.340> opponent's<00:02:07.790> attack<00:02:08.060> and

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:08.269 
was lower your opponent's attack and

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:10.300 
was lower your opponent's attack and
defense<00:02:08.509> by<00:02:08.690> one<00:02:08.899> stage<00:02:09.170> which<00:02:09.769> is<00:02:09.799> a<00:02:09.920> very

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
defense by one stage which is a very

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.100 
defense by one stage which is a very
useful<00:02:10.549> supporting<00:02:11.239> move<00:02:11.390> so<00:02:11.600> now<00:02:11.720> really<00:02:12.019> the

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
useful supporting move so now really the

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.460 
useful supporting move so now really the
only<00:02:12.260> other<00:02:12.560> supporting<00:02:13.280> option<00:02:13.670> you<00:02:13.760> have<00:02:13.790> is

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
only other supporting option you have is

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.620 
only other supporting option you have is
safeguard<00:02:15.470> and<00:02:15.880> destiny<00:02:16.880> bond<00:02:17.060> which<00:02:17.390> I

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
safeguard and destiny bond which I

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.090 
safeguard and destiny bond which I
suppose<00:02:17.959> is<00:02:18.019> a<00:02:18.290> good<00:02:18.500> option<00:02:18.709> when<00:02:19.040> you

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
suppose is a good option when you

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.670 
suppose is a good option when you
consider<00:02:19.400> shadow<00:02:19.760> tag<00:02:20.090> if<00:02:20.329> you<00:02:21.139> have<00:02:21.380> this

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
consider shadow tag if you have this

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:22.930 
consider shadow tag if you have this
punching<00:02:22.190> bag

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
punching bag

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.050 
punching bag
able<00:02:23.930> to<00:02:24.170> sustain<00:02:24.410> a<00:02:24.650> few<00:02:25.070> hits<00:02:25.340> and<00:02:25.790> you

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
able to sustain a few hits and you

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.900 
able to sustain a few hits and you
switch<00:02:26.360> out<00:02:26.570> on<00:02:26.810> a<00:02:27.380> maxed<00:02:28.220> out<00:02:28.480> HP<00:02:29.480> sweeper

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
switch out on a maxed out HP sweeper

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.070 
switch out on a maxed out HP sweeper
then<00:02:31.910> you<00:02:32.060> can<00:02:32.210> probably<00:02:32.570> take<00:02:32.660> it<00:02:32.810> with<00:02:32.930> you

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
then you can probably take it with you

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.800 
then you can probably take it with you
but<00:02:33.560> it's<00:02:33.710> all<00:02:33.830> down<00:02:34.190> to<00:02:34.220> timing<00:02:34.610> and<00:02:34.910> it's<00:02:35.600> all

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
but it's all down to timing and it's all

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.990 
but it's all down to timing and it's all
you<00:02:36.470> can<00:02:36.650> really<00:02:36.800> do<00:02:37.010> with<00:02:37.190> this<00:02:37.370> swab<00:02:37.670> of<00:02:37.700> fat

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
you can really do with this swab of fat

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.240 
you can really do with this swab of fat
so<00:02:38.240> max<00:02:38.840> out<00:02:39.020> its<00:02:39.170> defense<00:02:39.530> max<00:02:39.890> out<00:02:40.100> its

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
so max out its defense max out its

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.420 
so max out its defense max out its
special<00:02:40.610> defense<00:02:40.880> and<00:02:41.180> its<00:02:42.170> stats<00:02:42.620> on<00:02:42.890> top<00:02:43.190> of

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
special defense and its stats on top of

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.210 
special defense and its stats on top of
its<00:02:43.580> weak<00:02:43.790> move<00:02:44.120> pool<00:02:44.420> is<00:02:44.840> what<00:02:45.200> combines<00:02:45.800> to

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
its weak move pool is what combines to

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.120 
its weak move pool is what combines to
put<00:02:46.460> it<00:02:46.580> in<00:02:46.700> this<00:02:46.880> tier<00:02:47.300> of<00:02:47.450> just<00:02:48.230> terrible

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
put it in this tier of just terrible

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.820 
put it in this tier of just terrible
terrible<00:02:49.550> options<00:02:50.420> there's<00:02:50.900> really<00:02:51.470> nothing

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830 
terrible options there's really nothing

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:53.230 
terrible options there's really nothing
you<00:02:51.860> can<00:02:52.070> do<00:02:52.160> to<00:02:52.190> surprise<00:02:52.670> somebody<00:02:52.970> with<00:02:53.210> a
