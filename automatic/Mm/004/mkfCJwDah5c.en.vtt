but<00:02:31.560> we<00:02:31.739> got<00:02:31.890> that<00:02:32.040> trick<00:02:32.340> room<00:02:32.489> going<00:02:32.700> on<00:02:32.910> so

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
but we got that trick room going on so

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:34.910 
but we got that trick room going on so
that's<00:02:33.690> just<00:02:33.870> going<00:02:34.019> to<00:02:34.170> be<00:02:34.230> heatwave

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
that's just going to be heatwave

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.850 
that's just going to be heatwave
eruption<00:02:35.610> whatever<00:02:36.239> enough<00:02:36.720> damage<00:02:37.170> oh<00:02:37.349> man

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
eruption whatever enough damage oh man

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.589 
eruption whatever enough damage oh man
that's<00:02:38.040> a<00:02:38.099> good<00:02:38.250> combo<00:02:38.610> falling<00:02:39.299> out<00:02:39.420> the

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
that's a good combo falling out the

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:43.580 
that's a good combo falling out the
resist<00:02:39.930> right<00:02:40.200> there<00:02:40.410> not<00:02:41.310> bad<00:02:42.500> it's<00:02:43.500> like

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
resist right there not bad it's like

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.020 
resist right there not bad it's like
wondering<00:02:43.890> why<00:02:43.980> did<00:02:44.129> not<00:02:44.250> capitalize<00:02:44.519> and

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
wondering why did not capitalize and

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.360 
wondering why did not capitalize and
that<00:02:45.599> actually<00:02:46.110> captain<00:02:46.319> camera<00:02:46.739> pretty<00:02:47.160> safe

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
that actually captain camera pretty safe

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.819 
that actually captain camera pretty safe
so<00:02:47.670> I<00:02:47.910> like<00:02:48.420> that<00:02:48.599> call<00:02:48.840> right<00:02:48.870> there<00:02:49.230> and<00:02:49.440> then

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:49.829 
so I like that call right there and then

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:52.640 
so I like that call right there and then
dusclops<00:02:50.340> dusclops<00:02:51.329> refreshes<00:02:52.079> trick<00:02:52.380> room

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
dusclops dusclops refreshes trick room

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.440 
dusclops dusclops refreshes trick room
becomes<00:02:53.400> an<00:02:53.579> annoyance<00:02:54.030> and<00:02:54.180> now<00:02:54.269> it's

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
becomes an annoyance and now it's

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.120 
becomes an annoyance and now it's
superior<00:02:54.840> and<00:02:55.200> trick<00:02:55.380> room<00:02:55.590> versus<00:02:56.010> the

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
superior and trick room versus the

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.220 
superior and trick room versus the
eruption<00:02:56.700> maybe<00:02:57.360> he'll<00:02:57.720> be<00:02:57.840> able<00:02:57.989> to<00:02:58.140> just

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
eruption maybe he'll be able to just

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.190 
eruption maybe he'll be able to just
protect<00:02:58.709> for<00:02:59.040> a<00:02:59.099> second<00:02:59.720> that's<00:03:00.720> not<00:03:00.930> all<00:03:00.959> he

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
protect for a second that's not all he

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.050 
protect for a second that's not all he
can<00:03:01.349> do<00:03:01.470> no<00:03:01.890> no<00:03:02.099> cameras<00:03:02.430> with<00:03:02.579> the<00:03:02.610> eruption

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
can do no no cameras with the eruption

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.789 
can do no no cameras with the eruption
so<00:03:03.569> that's<00:03:03.900> just<00:03:04.079> going<00:03:04.200> to<00:03:04.319> be<00:03:04.349> a<00:03:04.410> super

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:04.799 
so that's just going to be a super

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:07.309 
so that's just going to be a super
amount<00:03:05.010> of<00:03:05.099> damage<00:03:05.430> that's<00:03:05.819> a<00:03:05.970> KO<00:03:06.180> I'm<00:03:06.900> excited

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
amount of damage that's a KO I'm excited

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:08.690 
amount of damage that's a KO I'm excited
