00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.149
 good kids Ivan because we are here 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.310
 in a new video of people to 5 and os 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.870
 I come to teach two new strollers that 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.099
 this is not one of them obviously 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.019
 this one I've already shown in a video today 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.389
 that if you have not seen it happen because 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.670
 often piece of car teaches me the 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.820
 very cute strollers ears that go to 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.350
 have a theme that you're going to freak out 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.910
 I really liked it 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.590
 I come to teach it so nothing can 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.289
 clean up and now we see many 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.599
 kids here you have the first of the 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.849
 cars that I wanted to show you and well 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.279
 for fans of the saga at full throttle 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.899
 or good media followers you will know that 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.340
 this is one of the cars that comes out 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:39.210
 first movie that leads to brian 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:41.280
 o'conner paul walker who is the actor and 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.739
 Well, it's an epic car, a car 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.090
 Indian law or as I would say a car of 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.969
 These marks a before and after 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.340
 the age of cars and well, very 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.989
 very very cool as you see the graffiti of 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.090
 the pains in working in the car for 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.190
 that you see it in detail because the 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.190
 paint is exactly the same as the one 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.649
 He's in the car as you can see he's with him 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.149
 it's like a guy pointing with his hand and 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.640
 the other arm I do not know what is in your hand 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.010
 like a spear or something 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.930
 and the truth is that not enough or 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.470
 carries like the hand in the ray that follows 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:16.770
 up here to the pole basically the 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.479
 lights that is pretty handsome the car 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.909
 and you have all already got all of the 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.070
 marks for the position the truth is that 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.020
 it's really cool there we see the one since you put 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.850
 in also the one that starts the first 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.009
 car from the first movie that is the 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.810
 this car that is green that is with the 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.100
 that starts with the one that made the first 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.830
 race and the truth is that to me 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.390
 I loved it too, and I wish it was not 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.800
 surely they will put it because here 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.690
 start with the cachetazos of at full throttle 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.520
 surely they will all go in and the 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.800
 truth is that it's a pass now I'm going to 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.280
 teach another car that I like a lot 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:50.130
 much more than this one so let's go there yes 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.960
 sir here we have the other stroller that 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.450
 as I say it is still from the saga 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.340
 at full throttle 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.929
 this is the car the vision 'skyline' with 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.759
 the one that starts just the second movie 

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:01.860
 that the second movie is also a 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.390
 of my favorites because I like it a lot 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.000
 the theme of street racing and 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.950
 all that and just start like that or the 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.330
 movie I think it has the best 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.769
 start I've seen from the movie of 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.910
 at full throttle because you do not start very 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:13.920
 handsome in plan calls 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.140
 a street race and run with this 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.450
 very cool piece of that film and car 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.820
 very cool that start and fuck this 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.230
 car is that the painting is very handsome 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.540
 As you can see, I saw the stripes 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.580
 sides and good for you to see that in 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.410
 gta you can put anything 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.170
 any damn car of any 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.840
 series of any videogame of life 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.120
 real , whatever the truth is, it's a 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.740
 total pass I love this car the 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.930
 truth that guys are lately 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:41.910
 very much like the theme of the modes of 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.070
 could put cars and such was cool for 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.330
 example, I love the mountain 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:47.160
 to go a hokey that I got was 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.560
 incredible but good little by little they go 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.600
 coming out better things and then from 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.400
 while this one of the cars is one is 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.430
 an addiction, that is, this is 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:59.400
 put cars so cool I all all 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.900
 the damn day I get into pages of 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.610
 motorcycles to look for new cars because there 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:06.000

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:07.680

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:32.490
 selling and I do not know if you're getting used to 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:35.130
 to be playing and watch them pass or is it 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:36.660

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.920

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.310
 simply teaching him why is that 

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:43.380

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.180

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.470
 I hope you have flown there you have 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.940
 the two cars at full speed of jÃ¼rgen 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.350
 It would say is a little before 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:13.300
 I go because I still do not think I've 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:14.920
 taught this so I'm going to ride 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:19.380
 Hello 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:21.660
 ok let's repair it while 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:24.130
 and now we're going I'll do one thing 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:27.580
 put a little more day why 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:29.950
 and to make it better and now 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:33.490
 let's show him a little bit that has 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:35.560
 forgotten and well then here you see the 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:38.500
 car is a pass the truth has a 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:40.090
 It's a bit old, the nose and that 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.560
 but of course, the movie is more or 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:45.220
 less old but what is the car 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:46.600
 mola mola quite done I do not know if it arrives 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.940
 to be exactly the model because I 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:52.000
 The car of the 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:53.830
 series that this the nose and that but not 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.900
 I have no idea the truth that is a 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:56.950
 last good bye I love the colors 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.620
 can also be changed for example 

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:02.080
 Compressive politician looks after me 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:04.180
 the cop does not pursue the policy parrao 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.560
 is now always essential several 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.350
 models as you can see can be painted 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:10.330
 several colors the same as the other car 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:11.710
 but good the original is the one that I have 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.210
 taught the one that seems most like they were 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:15.760
 like the blue lines and the car was 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:17.500
 grayish white was like grayish 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.250
 so then it 's the model that really 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.950
 I have taught you 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:22.360
 The truth is that mola is pretty cool 

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:25.500
 several colors I would have it even 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:28.150
 that of another color I think good gives the same 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:30.249
 I hope that you the video that the 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:31.809
 uglier color car has left him like that 

00:05:30.249 --> 00:05:33.039
 I hope that we are the side of realization of 

00:05:31.809 --> 00:05:35.830
 the iii favorites and until next one a 

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:38.830
 mega video goodbye 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:38.830
 two 

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:46.020
 the truth
