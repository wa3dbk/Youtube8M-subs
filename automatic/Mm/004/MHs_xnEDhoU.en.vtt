00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 
yourself the choppers that I build now

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.680 
yourself the choppers that I build now
still<00:01:58.140> have<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.410> same<00:01:59.130> error<00:01:59.940> correct<00:02:00.360> look

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
but I build them so that they're
