so<00:00:18.720> here's<00:00:18.900> a<00:00:18.990> sample<00:00:19.230> trip<00:00:19.650> plan<00:00:19.920> on<00:00:20.160> OneNote

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
so here's a sample trip plan on OneNote

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.990 
so here's a sample trip plan on OneNote
if<00:00:21.449> I<00:00:21.660> tap<00:00:21.960> on<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.230> note<00:00:22.590> itself<00:00:23.130> the<00:00:23.640> keyboard

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
if I tap on the note itself the keyboard

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.759 
if I tap on the note itself the keyboard
will<00:00:24.210> show<00:00:24.449> up<00:00:24.660> and<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:25.320> first<00:00:25.529> thing<00:00:25.680> that's

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
will show up and the first thing that's

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.040 
will show up and the first thing that's
noticeable<00:00:26.160> is<00:00:26.460> that<00:00:26.490> red<00:00:26.910> dot<00:00:27.240> it's<00:00:27.660> red

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
noticeable is that red dot it's red

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.650 
noticeable is that red dot it's red
because<00:00:28.439> that's<00:00:28.769> my<00:00:29.250> accent<00:00:29.789> color<00:00:29.970> for<00:00:30.359> this

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
because that's my accent color for this

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.900 
because that's my accent color for this
phone<00:00:30.929> it<00:00:31.289> might<00:00:31.500> be<00:00:31.679> different<00:00:32.040> for<00:00:32.219> you<00:00:32.399> so

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
let's go ahead and start typing here let

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.130 
let's go ahead and start typing here let
me<00:00:35.370> type<00:00:35.550> check<00:00:35.850> into<00:00:36.120> flight<00:00:38.899> you<00:00:39.899> could<00:00:40.020> also

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
familiar so far so let's go ahead and

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.360 
familiar so far so let's go ahead and
play<00:00:51.660> with<00:00:51.690> that<00:00:52.079> new<00:00:52.289> dot<00:00:52.530> on<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:52.980> keyboard

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.970 
play with that new dot on the keyboard
for<00:00:53.850> example<00:00:54.300> we<00:00:54.809> have<00:00:54.960> flight<00:00:55.230> reservation

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
for example we have flight reservation

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.240 
for example we have flight reservation
WQ<00:00:56.670> 2<00:00:56.879> 3<00:00:57.210> 4<00:00:57.539> and<00:00:57.809> I<00:00:58.350> want<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:58.590> change<00:00:58.770> that<00:00:59.010> into

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
WQ 2 3 4 and I want to change that into

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.900 
WQ 2 3 4 and I want to change that into
wz<00:01:00.149> 2<00:01:00.510> 3<00:01:00.780> 4<00:01:01.079> so<00:01:01.559> I'll<00:01:01.770> be<00:01:01.920> using<00:01:02.039> that<00:01:02.219> to<00:01:02.609> move

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
wz 2 3 4 so I'll be using that to move

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.630 
wz 2 3 4 so I'll be using that to move
the<00:01:02.969> cursor<00:01:03.510> to<00:01:04.049> replace<00:01:04.559> letters<00:01:04.979> in<00:01:05.189> certain

the cursor to replace letters in certain
words<00:01:05.880> but<00:01:06.869> take<00:01:07.110> a<00:01:07.140> look<00:01:07.320> since<00:01:07.590> this<00:01:07.860> is<00:01:08.040> a

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
words but take a look since this is a

Windows 10 preview it's still a little

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.500 
Windows 10 preview it's still a little
buggy<00:01:10.710> right<00:01:10.950> now<00:01:11.130> so<00:01:11.369> if<00:01:11.460> I<00:01:11.580> tap<00:01:12.299> the

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
buggy right now so if I tap the

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.060 
buggy right now so if I tap the
backspace<00:01:12.960> button<00:01:13.170> it<00:01:13.470> doesn't<00:01:13.710> erase<00:01:14.010> the

cue it erased letter where my cursor was
at<00:01:17.280> originally<00:01:18.119> I've<00:01:18.570> also<00:01:18.780> noticed<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.320> dot

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
at originally I've also noticed the dot

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.410

that will show up it's a little bit
different<00:01:36.600> to<00:01:37.220> let's<00:01:38.220> say<00:01:38.340> Windows<00:01:38.670> Phone<00:01:38.909> 8.1

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150

on if you press and hold you have a

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.440 
on if you press and hold you have a
shorter<00:01:43.200> way<00:01:43.350> to<00:01:43.520> to<00:01:44.520> write<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.820> numbers<00:01:45.119> so

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
shorter way to to write the numbers so

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.160 
shorter way to to write the numbers so
I'm<00:01:45.780> kind<00:01:46.140> of<00:01:46.229> not<00:01:46.439> liking<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.220> new<00:01:47.630> layout<00:01:48.630> so

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
I'm kind of not liking the new layout so

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.530 
I'm kind of not liking the new layout so
for<00:01:49.350> example<00:01:49.740> if<00:01:49.920> I<00:01:50.040> want<00:01:50.220> to<00:01:50.280> write<00:01:50.430> 1983<00:01:51.360> I

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
for example if I want to write 1983 I

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.380 
for example if I want to write 1983 I
was<00:01:52.020> quickly<00:01:52.500> doing<00:01:53.369> that<00:01:53.670> by<00:01:53.880> just<00:01:54.030> pressing

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
was quickly doing that by just pressing

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.480 
was quickly doing that by just pressing
and<00:01:54.509> hold<00:01:56.180> just<00:01:57.180> dragging<00:01:57.689> it<00:01:57.810> like<00:01:58.229> that<00:01:58.490> but

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
and hold just dragging it like that but

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.880
