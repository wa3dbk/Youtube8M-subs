00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.190 
private gardens or some absolutely
beautiful<00:01:56.640> specimens<00:01:57.630> that<00:01:57.719> have<00:01:57.810> fronds

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
beautiful specimens that have fronds

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.709 
beautiful specimens that have fronds
from<00:01:58.469> top<00:01:58.649> to<00:01:58.680> bottom<00:01:58.890> I<00:01:59.399> planted<00:02:00.210> these<00:02:00.360> ones

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
from top to bottom I planted these ones

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:07.100 
from top to bottom I planted these ones
in<00:02:01.290> April<00:02:03.049> 2000<00:02:04.049> and<00:02:04.430> it's<00:02:05.430> 11<00:02:05.909> now<00:02:06.030> 2011<00:02:06.750> so<00:02:07.049> I

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
in April 2000 and it's 11 now 2011 so I

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.190 
in April 2000 and it's 11 now 2011 so I
planted<00:02:07.320> these<00:02:07.530> April<00:02:07.920> 2008<00:02:08.759> and<00:02:09.149> we<00:02:10.080> had<00:02:10.170> a

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
planted these April 2008 and we had a

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.380 
planted these April 2008 and we had a
pretty<00:02:10.349> cold<00:02:10.619> winter<00:02:10.950> December<00:02:11.430> 2008<00:02:12.209> and

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
pretty cold winter December 2008 and

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.550 
pretty cold winter December 2008 and
they<00:02:12.480> went<00:02:12.660> through<00:02:12.810> that<00:02:12.900> unprotect

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
they went through that unprotect

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.500 
they went through that unprotect
so<00:02:13.830> they<00:02:14.400> didn't<00:02:14.580> have<00:02:14.700> any<00:02:14.819> damage<00:02:15.060> on<00:02:15.390> him

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
so they didn't have any damage on him

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.480 
so they didn't have any damage on him
and<00:02:15.990> I<00:02:16.110> don't<00:02:16.410> ever<00:02:16.560> expect<00:02:16.770> them<00:02:17.040> to<00:02:17.069> get<00:02:17.280> cold

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
and I don't ever expect them to get cold

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.699 
and I don't ever expect them to get cold
damage<00:02:17.880> on<00:02:18.030> him<00:02:18.150> here<00:02:18.330> so<00:02:18.540> I'll<00:02:19.380> grab<00:02:19.470> that

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
damage on him here so I'll grab that

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:20.870 
damage on him here so I'll grab that
camera<00:02:19.950> and<00:02:20.130> I'll<00:02:20.220> give<00:02:20.370> you<00:02:20.459> a<00:02:20.520> closer<00:02:20.730> look

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
camera and I'll give you a closer look

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.040 
camera and I'll give you a closer look
at<00:02:21.780> this<00:02:22.020> palm<00:02:22.290> and<00:02:23.360> for<00:02:24.360> palm<00:02:24.569> growers<00:02:24.900> out

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
at this palm and for palm growers out

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.570 
at this palm and for palm growers out
there<00:02:25.260> in<00:02:25.350> temperate<00:02:25.830> climates<00:02:25.860> are<00:02:26.370> many

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
there in temperate climates are many

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.210 
there in temperate climates are many
species<00:02:26.880> of<00:02:27.090> tracky<00:02:27.420> carpus<00:02:27.959> in<00:02:28.110> the<00:02:28.740> genus<00:02:28.980> I

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
species of tracky carpus in the genus I

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.510 
species of tracky carpus in the genus I
think<00:02:29.459> there's<00:02:30.319> eight<00:02:31.319> species<00:02:31.709> of<00:02:32.250> tracky

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
think there's eight species of tracky

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.910 
think there's eight species of tracky
carpus<00:02:33.060> the<00:02:33.959> most<00:02:34.140> cold<00:02:34.410> taller<00:02:34.650> and<00:02:34.830> his

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
carpus the most cold taller and his

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.470 
carpus the most cold taller and his
tracking<00:02:35.220> carpus<00:02:35.580> take<00:02:35.760> he'll<00:02:36.000> that<00:02:36.180> grows<00:02:36.330> at

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
tracking carpus take he'll that grows at

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.620 
tracking carpus take he'll that grows at
around<00:02:36.660> 80<00:02:37.110> 200<00:02:37.770> foot<00:02:38.239> northeast<00:02:39.239> facing

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
around 80 200 foot northeast facing

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.809 
around 80 200 foot northeast facing
slopes<00:02:39.930> of<00:02:40.080> the<00:02:40.140> Himalayan<00:02:40.560> mom<00:02:40.739> so<00:02:41.100> I'm<00:02:41.640> not

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
slopes of the Himalayan mom so I'm not

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:43.760 
slopes of the Himalayan mom so I'm not
exactly<00:02:42.030> sure<00:02:42.390> this<00:02:42.780> were<00:02:42.989> they<00:02:43.260> the<00:02:43.530> exact

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
exactly sure this were they the exact

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.110 
exactly sure this were they the exact
location<00:02:44.250> where<00:02:44.280> this<00:02:44.430> is<00:02:44.580> native<00:02:44.760> to<00:02:44.880> but

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
location where this is native to but

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.090 
location where this is native to but
somewhere<00:02:45.480> probably<00:02:45.660> in<00:02:45.959> China<00:02:46.350> they<00:02:46.890> may

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
somewhere probably in China they may

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.710 
somewhere probably in China they may

even be extinct in the wild who knows

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.280 
even be extinct in the wild who knows
but<00:02:49.590> I<00:02:50.220> wanted<00:02:51.120> to<00:02:51.209> try<00:02:51.420> if<00:02:51.660> you<00:02:51.780> can<00:02:51.900> find<00:02:52.110> that

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
but I wanted to try if you can find that

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:53.930 
but I wanted to try if you can find that
the<00:02:52.410> nurseries<00:02:52.739> not<00:02:52.890> super<00:02:53.370> common<00:02:53.790> at

I'd I was keeping my eye open for
wedgies<00:03:05.760> and<00:03:05.790> I<00:03:06.720> pulled<00:03:07.050> a<00:03:07.110> couple<00:03:07.140> of<00:03:07.410> them

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
wedgies and I pulled a couple of them

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:08.330 
wedgies and I pulled a couple of them
out<00:03:07.590> of<00:03:07.739> there<00:03:07.830> over<00:03:08.010> the<00:03:08.100> years

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
out of there over the years

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.220 
out of there over the years
and<00:03:08.610> there's<00:03:08.880> also<00:03:09.000> a<00:03:09.120> lot<00:03:09.269> of<00:03:09.300> hybrids<00:03:09.750> so<00:03:09.900> my

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
and there's also a lot of hybrids so my

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.050 
and there's also a lot of hybrids so my
hybridize<00:03:10.709> this<00:03:10.920> one<00:03:11.069> with<00:03:11.190> a<00:03:11.220> regular<00:03:11.580> 4<00:03:11.760> to<00:03:11.910> 9

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
hybridize this one with a regular 4 to 9

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.750 
hybridize this one with a regular 4 to 9
and<00:03:12.660> it<00:03:12.900> makes<00:03:13.080> a<00:03:13.170> really<00:03:13.380> nice<00:03:13.650> looking<00:03:14.519> palm

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
and it makes a really nice looking palm

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.509 
and it makes a really nice looking palm
so<00:03:15.480> we'll<00:03:16.290> grab<00:03:16.470> that<00:03:16.500> give<00:03:17.190> you<00:03:17.280> a<00:03:17.310> closer

rihanna's so you can see the smaller

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.590 
rihanna's so you can see the smaller
stiffer<00:03:24.320> fronds<00:03:25.320> on<00:03:25.590> it<00:03:26.209> there's<00:03:27.209> another<00:03:27.299> one

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
stiffer fronds on it there's another one

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.380 
stiffer fronds on it there's another one
here<00:03:28.280> hopefully<00:03:29.280> that's<00:03:29.430> a<00:03:29.640> hopefully<00:03:30.329> we

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
have both sexes of Palms here then we'll

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.310 
have both sexes of Palms here then we'll
get<00:03:31.950> some<00:03:32.100> fruit<00:03:32.340> on<00:03:32.459> these<00:03:32.579> when<00:03:32.760> they<00:03:32.850> mature

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:33.320 
get some fruit on these when they mature

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.630 
get some fruit on these when they mature
and<00:03:34.320> there's<00:03:34.500> the<00:03:34.620> regular<00:03:34.920> track<00:03:35.190> you<00:03:35.310> Karpis

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.699 
and there's the regular track you Karpis
4<00:03:35.820> to<00:03:35.970> 90<00:03:36.239> so<00:03:36.450> you<00:03:36.510> look<00:03:36.630> at<00:03:36.720> the<00:03:36.780> messy<00:03:37.110> sloppy

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
4 to 90 so you look at the messy sloppy

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:39.800 
4 to 90 so you look at the messy sloppy
looking<00:03:38.250> fronds<00:03:38.579> on<00:03:38.820> there<00:03:38.970> they<00:03:39.090> get<00:03:39.209> blown

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
looking fronds on there they get blown

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.259 
looking fronds on there they get blown
about<00:03:39.989> messed<00:03:40.440> up<00:03:40.650> in<00:03:40.890> the<00:03:41.820> wind<00:03:42.000> they're<00:03:42.239> a

about messed up in the wind they're a

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
lot larger but that's another foolproof

I had my way I'd have the streets lined
