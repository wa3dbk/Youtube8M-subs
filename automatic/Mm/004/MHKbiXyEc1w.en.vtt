is<00:00:25.910> my<00:00:26.029> dog<00:00:26.210> Bella's<00:00:26.600> crate<00:00:26.930> she<00:00:27.199> said<00:00:27.410> since

is my dog Bella's crate she said since

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:29.109 
is my dog Bella's crate she said since
she<00:00:27.860> was<00:00:27.980> a<00:00:28.010> puppy<00:00:28.430> she's<00:00:28.610> about<00:00:28.760> three<00:00:29.000> years

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:29.119 
she was a puppy she's about three years

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:30.580 
she was a puppy she's about three years
old<00:00:29.359> now

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:30.590 
old now

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.640 
old now
so<00:00:31.070> it's<00:00:31.910> it<00:00:32.360> is<00:00:32.540> big<00:00:32.809> enough<00:00:33.050> for<00:00:33.110> her<00:00:33.320> to<00:00:33.350> land

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:33.650 
so it's it is big enough for her to land

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:35.410 
so it's it is big enough for her to land
here<00:00:33.949> comfortably<00:00:34.430> she's<00:00:34.670> little<00:00:34.910> curled<00:00:35.270> up

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:35.420 
here comfortably she's little curled up

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.210 
here comfortably she's little curled up
but<00:00:35.600> she<00:00:35.780> loves<00:00:36.199> her<00:00:36.410> crate<00:00:36.710> because<00:00:36.890> it's

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:37.220 
but she loves her crate because it's

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:38.860 
but she loves her crate because it's
always<00:00:37.340> like<00:00:37.580> a<00:00:37.610> little<00:00:37.940> doggie<00:00:38.150> bedroom<00:00:38.690> and

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:38.870 
always like a little doggie bedroom and

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:40.150 
always like a little doggie bedroom and
that's<00:00:39.050> how<00:00:39.200> I<00:00:39.230> think<00:00:39.320> we<00:00:39.530> should<00:00:39.860> make<00:00:40.010> this

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:40.160 
that's how I think we should make this
