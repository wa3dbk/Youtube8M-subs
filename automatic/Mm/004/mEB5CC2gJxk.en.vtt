you'd need to do to push because right

you'd need to do to push because right
now<00:01:02.789> as<00:01:02.910> you<00:01:03.000> can<00:01:03.120> see<00:01:03.180> on<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.480> screen<00:01:03.780> we're

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
now as you can see on the screen we're

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.410 
now as you can see on the screen we're
just<00:01:04.650> firing<00:01:05.250> missiles<00:01:05.700> back<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:06.090> forth<00:01:06.270> we

just firing missiles back and forth we

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.550 
just firing missiles back and forth we
hope<00:01:06.540> this<00:01:06.720> like<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.020> style<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.380> game<00:01:07.409> I

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
hope this like the style the game I

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.560 
hope this like the style the game I
didn't<00:01:07.890> realize<00:01:08.220> at<00:01:08.400> this<00:01:08.549> point<00:01:08.790> it's<00:01:09.299> later

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
didn't realize at this point it's later

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.070 
didn't realize at this point it's later
on<00:01:09.840> that<00:01:10.020> you<00:01:10.140> see<00:01:10.380> sort<00:01:10.619> of<00:01:11.119> a<00:01:12.119> coordinated

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
on that you see sort of a coordinated

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.929 
on that you see sort of a coordinated
militarized<00:01:13.680> zone<00:01:13.979> but<00:01:14.340> right<00:01:14.520> now<00:01:14.670> it's<00:01:14.880> just

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
militarized zone but right now it's just

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.080 
militarized zone but right now it's just
chaos<00:01:15.509> like<00:01:15.930> important<00:01:16.830> turrets<00:01:17.280> down<00:01:17.549> there

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
chaos like important turrets down there

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.270 
chaos like important turrets down there
being<00:01:18.330> blown<00:01:18.659> up<00:01:18.689> instantly<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.830> we're<00:01:20.159> just

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
being blown up instantly and we're just

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.890 
being blown up instantly and we're just
putting<00:01:20.490> some<00:01:20.729> more<00:01:20.880> back<00:01:21.060> down<00:01:21.240> again<00:01:21.509> and<00:01:21.750> it

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
putting some more back down again and it

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.830 
putting some more back down again and it
just<00:01:22.170> it<00:01:23.100> gets<00:01:23.430> more<00:01:23.729> fun<00:01:24.000> as<00:01:24.180> it<00:01:24.390> goes<00:01:24.570> wrong

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
just it gets more fun as it goes wrong

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.380 
just it gets more fun as it goes wrong
at<00:01:25.799> least<00:01:25.860> I<00:01:26.159> find<00:01:26.400> it<00:01:26.549> those<00:01:26.700> and<00:01:26.970> I<00:01:27.030> find<00:01:27.270> it

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
at least I find it those and I find it

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.210 
at least I find it those and I find it
so<00:01:27.509> much<00:01:27.689> fun<00:01:27.900> because<00:01:28.080> it<00:01:28.590> gives<00:01:28.829> a<00:01:28.920> different

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
so much fun because it gives a different

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.420 
so much fun because it gives a different
feel<00:01:29.369> to<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.610> game<00:01:29.909> it's<00:01:30.180> completely

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.430 
feel to the game it's completely

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.530 
feel to the game it's completely
completely<00:01:32.430> different<00:01:32.820> than<00:01:33.210> what<00:01:33.450> I<00:01:33.479> thought

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
completely different than what I thought

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.030 
completely different than what I thought
it<00:01:33.869> would<00:01:33.990> be<00:01:34.079> I<00:01:34.110> thought<00:01:34.560> it<00:01:34.710> would<00:01:34.829> just<00:01:34.860> be

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
it would be I thought it would just be

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.920 
it would be I thought it would just be
Rockets<00:01:35.520> every<00:01:35.790> few<00:01:35.970> seconds<00:01:36.360> more<00:01:36.540> like<00:01:36.630> an<00:01:36.750> F

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
Rockets every few seconds more like an F

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.670 
Rockets every few seconds more like an F
mode<00:01:37.229> feel<00:01:37.560> but<00:01:38.490> instead<00:01:39.060> I<00:01:39.590> don't<00:01:40.590> know<00:01:40.650> I

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
mode feel but instead I don't know I

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.410 
mode feel but instead I don't know I
kind<00:01:41.040> of<00:01:41.100> like<00:01:41.220> it<00:01:41.280> it's<00:01:41.579> it's<00:01:41.850> it's<00:01:42.090> a<00:01:42.210> much

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
really interesting because the game

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.389 
really interesting because the game
could<00:01:57.090> have<00:01:57.180> gone<00:01:57.299> either<00:01:57.540> way<00:01:57.689> at<00:01:57.960> any<00:01:58.079> point

00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:58.399 
could have gone either way at any point

could have gone either way at any point
there<00:01:59.399> were<00:01:59.490> times<00:02:00.000> in<00:02:00.149> this<00:02:00.240> game<00:02:00.450> where<00:02:00.719> they

there were times in this game where they

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.170 
there were times in this game where they
were<00:02:00.960> pushing<00:02:01.439> in<00:02:01.710> our<00:02:01.920> base<00:02:02.100> heavily<00:02:02.549> and<00:02:02.759> you

no-man's land line was was we had all

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.910 
no-man's land line was was we had all
turrets<00:02:12.840> in<00:02:12.930> line<00:02:13.200> those

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
turrets in line those

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.860 
turrets in line those
space<00:02:14.220> in<00:02:14.400> between<00:02:14.700> we're<00:02:14.910> all<00:02:15.060> minions<00:02:15.510> died

space in between we're all minions died

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.650 
space in between we're all minions died
and<00:02:16.200> got<00:02:16.410> shat<00:02:16.830> on<00:02:16.860> then<00:02:17.730> they<00:02:17.970> had<00:02:18.239> their<00:02:18.480> line

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
and got shat on then they had their line

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.870 
and got shat on then they had their line
of<00:02:18.690> turrets<00:02:19.170> you<00:02:19.800> could<00:02:20.069> not<00:02:20.250> cross<00:02:20.489> that<00:02:20.700> line

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
of turrets you could not cross that line

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.309 
of turrets you could not cross that line
if<00:02:21.150> you<00:02:21.270> try<00:02:21.510> it<00:02:21.569> you<00:02:21.840> would<00:02:21.959> just<00:02:21.989> get

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
if you try it you would just get

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.800 
if you try it you would just get
destroyed<00:02:22.770> by<00:02:23.040> the<00:02:23.099> turrets<00:02:23.670> special<00:02:24.630> laser

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
destroyed by the turrets special laser

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.140 
destroyed by the turrets special laser
that<00:02:25.080> fires<00:02:25.290> every<00:02:25.590> 10<00:02:25.770> seconds<00:02:26.190> and<00:02:26.400> there's

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
that fires every 10 seconds and there's

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.420 
that fires every 10 seconds and there's
20<00:02:27.330> turrets<00:02:27.810> so<00:02:28.200> you<00:02:28.890> literally<00:02:29.160> could<00:02:29.400> not

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
20 turrets so you literally could not

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.720 
20 turrets so you literally could not
cross<00:02:29.730> that<00:02:29.970> land<00:02:30.180> which<00:02:30.780> is<00:02:30.930> why<00:02:31.050> I'm<00:02:31.230> saying

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
cross that land which is why I'm saying

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.610 
cross that land which is why I'm saying
when<00:02:32.730> you<00:02:32.880> plan<00:02:33.150> to<00:02:33.180> invade<00:02:33.660> you<00:02:34.170> need<00:02:34.500> to

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
when you plan to invade you need to

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.559 
when you plan to invade you need to
coordinate<00:02:35.220> with<00:02:35.370> your<00:02:35.520> team<00:02:35.819> and<00:02:36.000> all<00:02:36.239> fire

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
your rockets and your grenades at the

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.610 
your rockets and your grenades at the
same<00:02:38.520> time<00:02:38.790> to<00:02:39.000> silence<00:02:39.450> the<00:02:39.630> enemy<00:02:39.900> take<00:02:40.440> down

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
same time to silence the enemy take down

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.050 
same time to silence the enemy take down
their<00:02:40.830> turrets<00:02:41.160> so<00:02:41.340> they're<00:02:41.489> down<00:02:41.640> for<00:02:41.850> a<00:02:41.880> few

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
their turrets so they're down for a few

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.940 
their turrets so they're down for a few
seconds<00:02:42.510> before<00:02:42.630> they<00:02:42.959> can<00:02:43.140> spawn<00:02:43.410> more<00:02:43.709> and

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
seconds before they can spawn more and

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.840 
seconds before they can spawn more and
then<00:02:44.700> you<00:02:44.819> flood<00:02:45.209> in<00:02:45.390> and<00:02:46.280> that's<00:02:47.280> just<00:02:47.489> that

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
then you flood in and that's just that

grenades<00:03:26.519> because<00:03:27.120> they<00:03:27.660> are<00:03:28.230> but<00:03:28.560> they're<00:03:28.769> so

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
grenades because they are but they're so

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.280 
grenades because they are but they're so
beautiful<00:03:29.340> they<00:03:29.880> get<00:03:30.510> Quadra<00:03:30.870> kill<00:03:30.900> Zoe

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
beautiful they get Quadra kill Zoe

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.440 
beautiful they get Quadra kill Zoe
they're<00:03:31.799> beautiful<00:03:32.190> but<00:03:32.700> they're<00:03:33.209> just<00:03:33.329> the

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
they're beautiful but they're just the

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.280 
they're beautiful but they're just the
best<00:03:34.250> the<00:03:35.250> least<00:03:35.760> impressive<00:03:36.090> I<00:03:36.540> would<00:03:36.840> say<00:03:37.049> is

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
best the least impressive I would say is

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.410 
best the least impressive I would say is
the<00:03:37.560> rockets<00:03:37.980> and<00:03:38.250> I<00:03:38.549> know<00:03:38.609> they're<00:03:38.970> good<00:03:39.209> and

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
the rockets and I know they're good and

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.720 
the rockets and I know they're good and
you<00:03:40.230> can<00:03:40.380> imagine<00:03:40.650> why<00:03:40.980> they're<00:03:41.220> good<00:03:41.430> in<00:03:41.579> this

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
you can imagine why they're good in this

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.819 
you can imagine why they're good in this
because<00:03:42.180> you<00:03:42.329> could<00:03:42.510> just<00:03:42.720> fire<00:03:43.440> them<00:03:43.680> in<00:03:43.799> a

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:43.829 
because you could just fire them in a

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:46.759 
because you could just fire them in a
line<00:03:44.070> and<00:03:44.280> run<00:03:44.430> sideways<00:03:44.970> and<00:03:45.150> take<00:03:45.329> out<00:03:45.769> all

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
line and run sideways and take out all

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:48.650 
line and run sideways and take out all
the<00:03:47.010> turrets<00:03:47.340> it's<00:03:47.700> it's<00:03:47.880> not<00:03:48.180> as<00:03:48.329> good<00:03:48.510> as

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
the turrets it's it's not as good as

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:49.220 
the turrets it's it's not as good as
you'd<00:03:48.840> think

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
you'd think

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.390 
you'd think
it's<00:03:50.070> better<00:03:50.430> for<00:03:51.269> wiping<00:03:51.780> down<00:03:52.040> one<00:03:53.040> or<00:03:53.070> two

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
it's better for wiping down one or two

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.729 
it's better for wiping down one or two
people<00:03:53.640> because<00:03:54.450> because<00:03:55.200> it's<00:03:55.350> visually

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
people because because it's visually

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:57.770 
people because because it's visually
updated<00:03:56.160> it<00:03:56.280> looks<00:03:56.519> scary<00:03:56.970> on<00:03:57.180> screen<00:03:57.510> so<00:03:57.690> you

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
updated it looks scary on screen so you

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.809 
updated it looks scary on screen so you
think<00:03:57.989> oh<00:03:58.079> shit<00:03:58.380> this<00:03:58.530> rockets<00:03:58.890> run<00:03:59.069> that's

00:03:59.809 --> 00:03:59.819 
think oh shit this rockets run that's

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:02.360 
think oh shit this rockets run that's
that's<00:04:00.630> another<00:04:00.870> thing<00:04:01.140> that<00:04:01.500> I<00:04:01.680> find<00:04:02.069> in<00:04:02.220> this
