00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.770
 It exists to be relax as you like 

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:10.380
 Welcome 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.150
 I'm finishing an album with your union 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.920
 union if you want I tell you title 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:17.050
 tentative is going to kill me diego piano 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:20.380
 fried but I do not know if we're going to sing 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:22.779
 we're not really two and I think 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.640
 that if the tree is going to be called in 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:26.590
 opium path that's going to be the 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.689
 true title but they're going to be four 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:32.489
 volume you fall to a question 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:32.489
 asks what genius thinks about education 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.510
 well I think yes I think it's okay 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.670
 what seems serious to me is what happened 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:43.050
 with falcioni mouth came to win a 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:47.440
 tournament 13 point of difference 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:49.149
 and honestly when when the mouth of 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.579
 bianchi worked many years ago 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:53.949
 it was also said that he played badly 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:55.540
 so what is the only thing that I know is 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:57.489
 what mouth is bigger than 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:01.600
 temporary decisions that have been taken 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:03.930
 always about the club that is on high 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.660
 the fidelity of the mouth fan 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.550
 it was horrible to have to make it 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:10.830
 out to bianchi but at the same time he did not 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:12.630
 He wanted to leave and that was what he studied 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.460
 he did not want to go and I'm going to say it 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.690
 although I do not know and for me the technician 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.060
 natural and I think for all 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:21.390
 mouth fans the near future and 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.190
 better Guillermo of that this doubt but 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.190
 Falcioni of life should have 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.950
 continued 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:31.190
 when they were trained by the Germans with 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.930
 that stealing that device that they did as 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.720
 it is called the apparatus of the Germans but 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:38.450
 I never get 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:41.090
 soccer the german goal is good 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:44.690
 argentina is a goal from which he plays 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:46.040
 better to this device then to all 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:48.140
 players training and are with 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.540
 touch screens seeing who is the 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.970
 that plays it better and basically it's a 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:55.580
 return machine the 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.260
 ball in two touches maximum you 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.420
 spits the ball at 100 kilometers per 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:02.330
 time and water to stop it and place it 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.880
 in one place and then they practice soccer and 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:07.760
 the goal that made us the soccer goal 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:10.570
 even so it wins worldwide and true that 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.570
 are you going to take him
