00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
don't like about this is when you pull

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.610 
don't like about this is when you pull
out<00:02:18.320> the<00:02:18.980> product<00:02:19.900> there's<00:02:20.900> not<00:02:21.230> like<00:02:21.590> a

out the product there's not like a
really<00:02:22.040> great<00:02:22.310> stopper<00:02:23.000> to<00:02:23.150> get<00:02:23.300> the<00:02:23.450> product

really great stopper to get the product

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.160 
really great stopper to get the product
off<00:02:24.080> so<00:02:24.530> it's<00:02:24.680> really<00:02:25.130> goopy<00:02:25.580> and<00:02:26.270> I<00:02:26.840> have<00:02:27.020> to

product off and then it gets my tube of
my<00:02:32.840> mascara<00:02:33.410> I<00:02:33.500> like<00:02:33.710> really<00:02:34.400> really<00:02:34.970> dirty

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:35.240 
my mascara I like really really dirty

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.740 
my mascara I like really really dirty
and<00:02:35.420> gross<00:02:36.200> so<00:02:37.010> um<00:02:37.820> like<00:02:38.180> and<00:02:38.330> as<00:02:38.420> you<00:02:38.570> can<00:02:38.690> see

and gross so um like and as you can see

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.590 
and gross so um like and as you can see
the<00:02:39.110> hole<00:02:39.410> is<00:02:39.620> huge<00:02:40.040> so<00:02:40.910> there's<00:02:41.120> nothing<00:02:41.390> that

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
the hole is huge so there's nothing that

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.100 
the hole is huge so there's nothing that
really<00:02:41.990> like<00:02:42.170> sucks<00:02:42.740> the<00:02:43.490> product<00:02:44.210> off<00:02:44.420> now

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
really like sucks the product off now

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:51.550 
really like sucks the product off now
maybe<00:02:45.860> mine<00:02:46.160> is<00:02:46.310> broken<00:02:47.740> but<00:02:49.810> that's<00:02:50.810> probably

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
maybe mine is broken but that's probably

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.010 
maybe mine is broken but that's probably
the<00:02:51.800> one<00:02:52.010> downside<00:02:52.490> to<00:02:52.550> this<00:02:52.850> mascara<00:02:53.420> is<00:02:53.750> this

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 
the one downside to this mascara is this

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.260 
the one downside to this mascara is this
really<00:02:54.290> goopy<00:02:54.590> it's<00:02:55.220> already<00:02:55.490> wet<00:02:55.790> and<00:02:56.090> then<00:02:56.240> I

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:56.270 
really goopy it's already wet and then I

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:59.290 
really goopy it's already wet and then I
can't<00:02:56.660> get<00:02:57.260> it<00:02:57.410> off<00:02:57.590> the<00:02:57.860> product<00:02:58.340> so<00:02:58.550> it<00:02:59.060> all

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.300 
can't get it off the product so it all

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.200 
can't get it off the product so it all
seems<00:02:59.690> to<00:02:59.990> clump<00:03:00.350> up<00:03:00.590> right<00:03:01.400> there<00:03:01.730> at<00:03:02.030> the

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:02.210 
seems to clump up right there at the

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:04.570 
seems to clump up right there at the
head<00:03:02.390> of<00:03:02.720> the<00:03:02.900> brush<00:03:03.140> you<00:03:03.860> can<00:03:04.040> kind<00:03:04.280> of<00:03:04.370> see

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 
head of the brush you can kind of see

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:09.250 
head of the brush you can kind of see
where<00:03:04.820> it's<00:03:04.940> clumped<00:03:05.390> up<00:03:06.520> and<00:03:07.520> then<00:03:08.240> you<00:03:08.990> look

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
where it's clumped up and then you look

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.770 
where it's clumped up and then you look
down<00:03:09.290> into<00:03:10.010> the<00:03:10.130> tube<00:03:10.430> it<00:03:11.060> doesn't<00:03:11.450> seem<00:03:11.630> to

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
down into the tube it doesn't seem to

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.350 
down into the tube it doesn't seem to
meet<00:03:11.930> a<00:03:12.110> whole<00:03:12.470> lot<00:03:12.920> of<00:03:13.280> product<00:03:14.090> I<00:03:14.210> don't

just depth and boots and they just kind

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:39.940 
just depth and boots and they just kind
of<00:03:37.190> stand<00:03:37.580> out<00:03:37.820> which<00:03:38.390> is<00:03:38.540> what<00:03:38.690> I<00:03:38.720> like<00:03:39.080> it's<00:03:39.770> a

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
of stand out which is what I like it's a

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.580 
of stand out which is what I like it's a
very<00:03:40.190> dark<00:03:40.670> black<00:03:41.300> and<00:03:41.630> I<00:03:41.930> know<00:03:42.080> that<00:03:42.260> sounds

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
very dark black and I know that sounds

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.740 
very dark black and I know that sounds
silly<00:03:42.800> but<00:03:43.730> there<00:03:43.880> are<00:03:44.030> some<00:03:44.270> house<00:03:44.450> scares

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
silly but there are some house scares

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.280 
silly but there are some house scares
where<00:03:45.020> you<00:03:45.170> can<00:03:45.350> apply<00:03:46.390> to<00:03:47.390> your<00:03:47.420> eyes<00:03:47.690> and<00:03:48.050> it

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
where you can apply to your eyes and it

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:49.840 
where you can apply to your eyes and it
just<00:03:48.470> doesn't<00:03:48.830> make<00:03:48.980> them<00:03:49.190> really<00:03:49.400> stand<00:03:49.700> out

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:49.850 
just doesn't make them really stand out

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:51.730 
just doesn't make them really stand out
like<00:03:50.000> the<00:03:50.120> black<00:03:50.450> is<00:03:50.690> just<00:03:50.870> not<00:03:51.080> that<00:03:51.110> intense

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:51.740 
like the black is just not that intense

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:56.160 
like the black is just not that intense
and<00:03:52.070> this<00:03:52.580> black<00:03:52.940> is<00:03:53.240> so<00:03:54.080> I<00:03:54.110> really<00:03:54.500> like<00:03:54.740> that

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.170 
and this black is so I really like that

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:01.270 
and this black is so I really like that
it's<00:03:57.170> made<00:03:57.350> in<00:03:57.560> the<00:03:57.620> USA<00:03:59.470> but<00:04:00.470> it's<00:04:00.650> a<00:04:00.830> pretty

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
it's made in the USA but it's a pretty

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.910 
it's made in the USA but it's a pretty
great<00:04:01.580> mascara<00:04:02.240> I<00:04:02.540> really<00:04:03.050> like<00:04:03.230> it<00:04:03.500> I've<00:04:03.650> kind

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:03.920 
great mascara I really like it I've kind

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.710 
great mascara I really like it I've kind
of<00:04:04.040> been<00:04:04.100> using<00:04:04.400> it<00:04:04.640> instead<00:04:04.850> of<00:04:04.940> my<00:04:05.150> falsies

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.720 
of been using it instead of my falsies

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.260 
of been using it instead of my falsies
and<00:04:06.220> I'm<00:04:07.220> finding<00:04:07.520> that<00:04:07.700> I<00:04:07.760> don't<00:04:08.060> need<00:04:08.180> to

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:08.270 
and I'm finding that I don't need to

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:10.750 
and I'm finding that I don't need to
curl<00:04:08.480> my<00:04:08.510> lashes<00:04:08.630> when<00:04:09.290> I<00:04:09.320> use<00:04:09.590> it<00:04:09.620> so<00:04:10.520> this

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 
curl my lashes when I use it so this

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.690 
curl my lashes when I use it so this
might<00:04:11.000> be<00:04:11.030> a<00:04:11.150> really<00:04:11.540> good<00:04:12.310> mascara<00:04:13.310> if<00:04:13.550> you

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:13.700 
might be a really good mascara if you

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.400 
might be a really good mascara if you
have<00:04:13.880> fine<00:04:14.180> lashes<00:04:14.690> and<00:04:14.840> just<00:04:14.900> want<00:04:15.170> a<00:04:15.200> little
