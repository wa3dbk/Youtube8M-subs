watched season one yet it's kind of

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:11.190 
watched season one yet it's kind of
outside<00:03:07.300> of<00:03:07.480> my<00:03:07.660> normal<00:03:09.810> viewing<00:03:10.810> thing<00:03:11.050> but

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
outside of my normal viewing thing but

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.120 
outside of my normal viewing thing but
you<00:03:11.290> know<00:03:11.380> it<00:03:11.530> could<00:03:11.650> be<00:03:11.770> something<00:03:11.950> like

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
you know it could be something like

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.640 
you know it could be something like
princess<00:03:12.520> princess<00:03:12.790> where<00:03:13.320> even<00:03:14.320> though<00:03:14.410> it

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
princess princess where even though it

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.230 
princess princess where even though it
doesn't<00:03:15.340> sound<00:03:15.730> like<00:03:15.820> something<00:03:15.850> they<00:03:16.150> have

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:16.240 
doesn't sound like something they have

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.080 
doesn't sound like something they have
normally<00:03:16.540> appealed<00:03:16.810> to<00:03:16.840> me<00:03:17.040> and<00:03:18.040> in<00:03:18.610> terms<00:03:18.940> of

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
normally appealed to me and in terms of

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.710 
normally appealed to me and in terms of
a<00:03:19.350> yaoi<00:03:20.350> kind<00:03:20.920> of<00:03:21.070> setup<00:03:22.060> it's<00:03:22.360> actually

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
a yaoi kind of setup it's actually

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.210 
a yaoi kind of setup it's actually
pretty<00:03:22.810> entertaining<00:03:23.230> i<00:03:23.380> think<00:03:23.590> another<00:03:23.980> one

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
pretty entertaining i think another one

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.190 
pretty entertaining i think another one
like<00:03:24.370> that<00:03:24.520> might<00:03:24.760> have<00:03:24.880> been<00:03:24.910> a<00:03:25.060> kill<00:03:25.930> Korra

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
like that might have been a kill Korra

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.770 
like that might have been a kill Korra
mouth<00:03:26.470> although<00:03:26.890> that<00:03:27.070> one<00:03:27.220> had<00:03:27.430> even<00:03:27.780> less

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
mouth although that one had even less

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.240 
mouth although that one had even less
undertones<00:03:29.260> and<00:03:29.410> Prince<00:03:29.650> princes<00:03:30.100> and

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
undertones and Prince princes and

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.199 
undertones and Prince princes and
Brendan's<00:03:30.970> presence<00:03:31.390> wasn't<00:03:31.930> out<00:03:32.650> right<00:03:33.209> okay

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.209 
Brendan's presence wasn't out right okay

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:37.199 
Brendan's presence wasn't out right okay
but<00:03:34.470> whatever<00:03:35.470> i<00:03:35.709> don't<00:03:35.769> know<00:03:36.010> i<00:03:36.250> should

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
but whatever i don't know i should

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:38.580 
but whatever i don't know i should
probably<00:03:37.420> still<00:03:37.750> give<00:03:37.900> the<00:03:37.930> original<00:03:38.380> want<00:03:38.530> to

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
probably still give the original want to

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:40.860 
probably still give the original want to
watch<00:03:38.739> but<00:03:38.950> there's<00:03:39.190> so<00:03:39.370> much<00:03:39.540> watch<00:03:40.540> that<00:03:40.810> I

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
watch but there's so much watch that I

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.710 
watch but there's so much watch that I
just<00:03:41.050> don't<00:03:41.230> get<00:03:41.320> around<00:03:41.530> to<00:03:41.709> it<00:03:42.090> now<00:03:43.090> this<00:03:43.570> is

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
just don't get around to it now this is

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.710 
just don't get around to it now this is
the<00:03:43.750> reason<00:03:43.930> why<00:03:44.050> this<00:03:44.590> week<00:03:45.519> stuff<00:03:45.820> is<00:03:46.000> big

as<00:04:09.370> did<00:04:09.700> City<00:04:09.970> Hunter<00:04:10.209> 91<00:04:11.640> which<00:04:12.640> is<00:04:13.000> I<00:04:13.030> think

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:13.420 
as did City Hunter 91 which is I think

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:18.509 
as did City Hunter 91 which is I think
called<00:04:14.110> city<00:04:14.799> hunter<00:04:15.130> 4<00:04:15.459> x<00:04:16.830> DVD<00:04:17.830> aficionado

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519 
called city hunter 4 x DVD aficionado

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:23.640 
called city hunter 4 x DVD aficionado
but<00:04:19.000> either<00:04:19.150> way<00:04:19.450> I<00:04:20.669> have<00:04:21.669> them<00:04:21.820> both<00:04:22.650> they

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 
but either way I have them both they

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:24.990 
but either way I have them both they
both<00:04:23.680> seem<00:04:24.040> to<00:04:24.130> be<00:04:24.220> good<00:04:24.460> in<00:04:24.610> good<00:04:24.790> working

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
both seem to be good in good working

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.150 
both seem to be good in good working
condition<00:04:25.150> and<00:04:25.630> two<00:04:25.780> of<00:04:25.870> them<00:04:25.930> together

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
condition and two of them together

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.719 
condition and two of them together
probably<00:04:27.160> cost<00:04:27.370> about<00:04:27.520> 500<00:04:29.610> although<00:04:30.610> they

00:04:30.719 --> 00:04:30.729 
probably cost about 500 although they

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:33.240 
probably cost about 500 although they
were<00:04:30.790> bought<00:04:31.030> individual<00:04:31.479> in<00:04:31.570> anyways<00:04:32.250> that's

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 
were bought individual in anyways that's

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:37.450 
were bought individual in anyways that's

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.760 

so<00:04:38.060> I<00:04:38.090> think<00:04:38.330> some<00:04:38.479> people<00:04:38.780> were<00:04:38.990> confused<00:04:39.500> i

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:39.770 
so I think some people were confused i

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:41.439 
so I think some people were confused i
wasn't<00:04:40.130> on<00:04:40.250> I<00:04:40.550> wasn't<00:04:40.819> saying<00:04:41.060> I<00:04:41.210> was<00:04:41.330> on

00:04:41.439 --> 00:04:41.449 
wasn't on I wasn't saying I was on

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:44.379 
wasn't on I wasn't saying I was on
vacation<00:04:42.280> yet<00:04:43.280> or<00:04:43.520> I<00:04:43.550> wasn't<00:04:43.819> going<00:04:44.150> to<00:04:44.240> be

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:44.389 
vacation yet or I wasn't going to be

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:46.809 
vacation yet or I wasn't going to be
here<00:04:44.930> out<00:04:45.319> of<00:04:45.500> town<00:04:45.710> or<00:04:45.740> whatnot<00:04:46.039> I<00:04:46.310> was

00:04:46.809 --> 00:04:46.819 
here out of town or whatnot I was

00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:48.460 
here out of town or whatnot I was
actually<00:04:47.000> saying<00:04:47.479> that<00:04:47.720> I<00:04:47.750> would<00:04:47.900> actually<00:04:48.139> be

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:48.470 
actually saying that I would actually be

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:50.610 
actually saying that I would actually be
leaving<00:04:48.860> next<00:04:49.340> week<00:04:49.550> so<00:04:49.849> next<00:04:50.060> week's<00:04:50.330> video

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620 
leaving next week so next week's video

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:55.150 
leaving next week so next week's video

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.189 
probably be posted Wednesday night late
at<00:04:55.190> night<00:04:55.639> because<00:04:56.479> I<00:04:56.660> could<00:04:56.810> probably<00:04:56.990> just

00:04:57.189 --> 00:04:57.199 
at night because I could probably just

00:04:57.199 --> 00:04:58.540 
at night because I could probably just
sleep<00:04:57.500> on<00:04:57.620> the<00:04:57.800> trip<00:04:58.039> so<00:04:58.190> it<00:04:58.250> doesn't<00:04:58.490> matter

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.550 
sleep on the trip so it doesn't matter

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:04.689

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:28.669 
that from the right stuff there's a
