 I would like to see the interview of 8 people who took part in the victory match held yesterday 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:16.650
 I was worried during the preliminaries, but would you like to meet the semifinals ? 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:19.860
 The semi-final was good well a What kind of place would you like for the championship

 That's right I think I'm getting better gradually if I can get some more easy to eat 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:49.870
 The start seems to be quite good this section, but 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:50.390

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.940

 It had been well maintained until the semi-final race, but it feels like

 It is not bad but I will go a step further 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:14.480
 How about the end of this start of this section 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:18.340
