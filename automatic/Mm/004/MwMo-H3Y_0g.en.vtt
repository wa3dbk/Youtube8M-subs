00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630 
because then I've got a way to the next

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:18.820 
because then I've got a way to the next
round<00:04:17.900> and<00:04:18.049> the<00:04:18.169> next<00:04:18.380> round<00:04:18.560> I'm<00:04:18.680> probably

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:18.830 
round and the next round I'm probably

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:20.979 
round and the next round I'm probably
being<00:04:19.040> like<00:04:19.220> an<00:04:19.549> hour's<00:04:19.940> time<00:04:19.970> because<00:04:20.870> that's

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:20.989 
being like an hour's time because that's

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:22.360 
being like an hour's time because that's
the<00:04:21.080> only<00:04:21.109> downside<00:04:21.680> that<00:04:21.710> you<00:04:21.979> can't<00:04:22.190> pick
