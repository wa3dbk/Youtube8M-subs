00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
Kajal eyeliner I first was going to do a

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.680 
Kajal eyeliner I first was going to do a
first<00:00:08.220> impression<00:00:08.639> on<00:00:08.730> it<00:00:08.970> and<00:00:09.150> I<00:00:09.240> filmed<00:00:09.599> it

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
first impression on it and I filmed it

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.690 
first impression on it and I filmed it
before<00:00:09.780> I<00:00:10.019> left<00:00:10.440> for<00:00:10.710> Florida<00:00:10.830> but<00:00:11.460> then<00:00:11.580> when

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
before I left for Florida but then when

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.490 
before I left for Florida but then when
I<00:00:11.730> uploaded<00:00:12.120> the<00:00:12.269> footage<00:00:12.420> to<00:00:12.719> my<00:00:12.840> computer<00:00:13.259> I

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
I uploaded the footage to my computer I

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.140 
I uploaded the footage to my computer I
realized<00:00:14.040> that<00:00:14.160> it<00:00:14.250> was<00:00:14.340> all<00:00:14.460> out<00:00:14.670> of<00:00:14.700> focus

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
realized that it was all out of focus

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.689 
realized that it was all out of focus
so<00:00:15.690> I<00:00:15.719> had<00:00:15.870> to<00:00:15.990> re-film<00:00:16.170> but<00:00:16.710> I<00:00:16.920> have<00:00:17.130> at<00:00:17.490> least

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
so I had to re-film but I have at least

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.000 
so I had to re-film but I have at least
now<00:00:18.300> I've<00:00:18.510> tried<00:00:19.080> it<00:00:19.199> out<00:00:19.350> and<00:00:19.590> I've<00:00:19.650> worn<00:00:19.859> it

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
now I've tried it out and I've worn it

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.380 
now I've tried it out and I've worn it
down<00:00:20.160> in<00:00:20.279> Florida<00:00:20.609> where<00:00:20.760> was<00:00:20.880> really<00:00:21.119> hot<00:00:21.270> and

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.179

that looks after using it quite a bit
but<00:01:29.520> I<00:01:29.579> use<00:01:29.820> this<00:01:30.000> every<00:01:30.270> day<00:01:30.299> and<00:01:30.600> I<00:01:30.659> was<00:01:30.780> down

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
but I use this every day and I was down

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.569 
but I use this every day and I was down
in<00:01:30.960> Florida<00:01:31.079> for<00:01:31.590> about<00:01:31.740> a<00:01:31.920> week<00:01:32.250> and<00:01:32.460> a<00:01:32.549> half

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
in Florida for about a week and a half

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.179 
in Florida for about a week and a half
and<00:01:33.060> on<00:01:33.960> basically<00:01:34.409> all<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.740> product<00:01:35.100> is

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
and on basically all the product is

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.830 
and on basically all the product is
still<00:01:35.369> there<00:01:35.640> so<00:01:35.909> I<00:01:35.939> think<00:01:36.060> it'll<00:01:36.390> last<00:01:36.540> quite

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
still there so I think it'll last quite

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.319 
still there so I think it'll last quite
a<00:01:36.900> while<00:01:36.960> so<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.770> color<00:01:37.950> I<00:01:38.009> got<00:01:38.369> was<00:01:38.549> onyx<00:01:39.000> rush

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
eyeliner I'm sorry that I couldn't do a

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.090 
eyeliner I'm sorry that I couldn't do a
first<00:02:36.300> impression<00:02:36.780> but<00:02:36.960> I<00:02:36.990> think<00:02:37.320> this<00:02:37.500> it

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
first impression but I think this it

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.410 
first impression but I think this it
actually<00:02:38.520> works<00:02:38.700> out<00:02:38.850> better<00:02:39.060> because<00:02:39.390> I

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
actually works out better because I

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:40.880 
actually works out better because I
could<00:02:39.570> tell<00:02:39.690> you<00:02:39.810> my<00:02:39.930> honest<00:02:40.230> opinion<00:02:40.620> and

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
could tell you my honest opinion and

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.840 
I've worn it in one of the most humid
places<00:02:42.690> this<00:02:43.140> eyeliner<00:02:43.470> really<00:02:44.010> hung<00:02:44.820> in

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
places this eyeliner really hung in
