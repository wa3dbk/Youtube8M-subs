think we plan a ton of these shots and

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.680 
think we plan a ton of these shots and
most<00:02:30.740> of<00:02:30.890> it<00:02:31.010> is<00:02:31.130> we<00:02:31.310> go<00:02:31.430> to<00:02:31.520> a<00:02:31.580> site<00:02:31.850> we<00:02:32.510> just

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
most of it is we go to a site we just

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.510 
most of it is we go to a site we just
kind<00:02:32.810> of<00:02:32.870> look<00:02:33.020> at<00:02:33.170> this<00:02:33.620> scenario<00:02:33.890> and<00:02:34.370> where

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
kind of look at this scenario and where

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:35.680 
kind of look at this scenario and where
we're<00:02:34.670> at<00:02:34.760> and<00:02:35.030> kind<00:02:35.120> of<00:02:35.239> just<00:02:35.390> figured<00:02:35.600> out

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
we're at and kind of just figured out

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.630 
we're at and kind of just figured out
from<00:02:35.780> there<00:02:35.989> and<00:02:36.020> just<00:02:36.470> kind<00:02:36.709> of<00:02:36.770> wing<00:02:36.920> it<00:02:36.950> and

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
from there and just kind of wing it and

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.370 
from there and just kind of wing it and
so<00:02:37.850> there's<00:02:38.060> not<00:02:38.120> a<00:02:38.180> lot<00:02:38.390> of<00:02:38.510> a<00:02:38.690> lot<00:02:39.320> of

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
so there's not a lot of a lot of

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.710 
so there's not a lot of a lot of
planning<00:02:39.890> speaking<00:02:40.459> of<00:02:40.580> winging<00:02:41.060> it<00:02:41.209> one<00:02:41.540> that
