00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 today it is about the deposit game 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.549
 go or, more precisely, why 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:05.940
 Her is not yet in her hands 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.160
 can 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.780
 we are sorry and yes we are one 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.290
 a bit late but there are good ones 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.330
 reasons for that namely the among other things 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.400
 the puky the creator of landfill so 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.690
 has brought in many own ideas that 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.619
 we need a bit longer for that 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.660
 to edit all 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.340
 but he can do it much better 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.960
 and explain in more detail than me 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.359
 Let's call him 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:31.640
 in a totally real phone conversation 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.640
 live right 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:46.530
 I do not care is important wondered when will 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:51.719
 The depot in japan paper is total 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:53.460
 useless closed what you come 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.100
 actually the landfill pen and paper 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.690
 Well that's a very good question 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:05.250
 I even have an answer here somewhere 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:06.600
 he quickly prepared the 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.939
 Now ask where I am in position with 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.400
 dolls when does the depot japan come? 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.080
 and paper finally good question i have 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.420
 the answer 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:18.850
 unfortunately it takes a little longer 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:21.750
 Do not be so strict with us 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.750
 strict 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:27.110
 as the smell of a work sweat 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:29.570
 somehow whether to research gc hardly serves 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.290
 but enough salbadert because there you have 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.900
 more partie 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.900
 unfortunately it takes a little longer 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:39.380
 we have a small trailer 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.460
 brimming in our truck Zweiachser 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.049
 our notes 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.119
 we will probably still be up to the 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:53.430
 sit there in the late autumn 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:53.430
 unfortunately it takes a little longer 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:04.609
 meaningful damn he gives it 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.479
 because there is no comparative to if so how 

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:09.969
 fully deserve it 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:09.969
 I give you a seal and a letter 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:16.720
 just like that on that run paper 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:22.060
 The completed moral work will be in the 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:24.160
 Foreword to the appendix net appendix 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.040
 Let's take a look at roland fischer details 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.080
 place and tables full with values ​​flat 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.870
 maybe you should look up 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:35.790
 to make your buddies casual and am 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.790
 value the table 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:41.160
 it just takes a little longer 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.850
 I am wonderful that you have this song 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.560
 wrote 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:50.540
 even if you maybe in time 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.990
 still on the role play would have to work 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.640
 but can the statement of this 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:56.510
 great poetic music after works 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.730
 Yes, yes 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:02.360
 It takes a little longer but good 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:05.330
 Reason yes the super duper good reason 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:07.840
 on which you can look forward very is 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:10.610
 that of course the roleplay so 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.370
 so it has become incredibly big 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:15.560
 material that we have worn together 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.850
 to cover this entire new world 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:20.120
 to write off the toni if ​​you like that 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:23.050
 a small square kilometer in 2 34 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:25.280
 square kilometers have been allowed to play so far 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:31.390
 yes that so much stuff together 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:36.320
 come that is work will be with her 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:37.760
 The neighbor lid can kill something 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:41.480
 is in there, for example, everything in it 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:44.989
 yes that never seen so we have 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.670
 for example, you knew, for example 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:49.160
 that except north northeast pool 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:52.910
 there are three more poles on landfills 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:56.450
 yes the styrofoam the media holding expo 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:04:01.250
 of course or if you feel like it 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:03.650
 fecal matter, how can you? 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:05.810
 get along there if not with 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:08.750
 our great only a game book with 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:09.920
 many helpful continent cards the 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:13.190
 unfortunately not so much in detail 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:15.700
 but very many useful values 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:15.700
 tables 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:24.890
 we actually have a great deal 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:27.770
 material you have you can completely new 

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:30.440
 visit continents on the landfill and 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:34.040
 Of course, well-known places to 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:36.380
 for example, if sven nothing else 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:41.090
 comes to mind in Cuba or in the sausage 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:44.000
 production of plant and stink that 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:45.340
 that is a fun there you should 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.570
 definitely go there 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:49.250
 or if it comes to me in the desert 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:51.169
 from transportable batteries again 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:53.660
 We actually have some 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:54.139
 place on the pole robert yes that 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:55.639
 sultanate 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:58.189
 al gore they all knew that before 

00:04:55.639 --> 00:05:00.039
 the stream goes down and there is a lot 

00:04:58.189 --> 00:05:03.580
 many great places to discover 

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:06.229
 the least of them are real 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:08.439
 Unfortunately, health is it takes a little 

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:08.439
 longer 

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:15.620
 we can also look at something 

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:16.819
 because some of the landscapes are the doll 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:18.620
 to which we have already 

00:05:16.819 --> 00:05:21.800
 Illustrations and we can tell you 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:22.819
 Now they are showing great 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:27.889
 effect purely leafed 

00:05:22.819 --> 00:05:30.069
 the very tasty yes it comes 

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:30.069
 even more 

00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:38.900
 Actually, the book is practically finished 

00:05:36.259 --> 00:05:41.960
 It has over 200 pages over a million 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:44.080
 sign that will be neat what it is 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:47.770
 just needs a little bit longer 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:47.770
 Thank you for your patience
