00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.700
 I wanted to talk to you about salmon 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.700
 Cat food for humans, 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.400
 The lining of tuna, 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.400
 Or the stupid fish that does not understand anything about how a river works. 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.400
 They are known to go upstream 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.700
 But because of the electric dams it became impossible 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.000
 But do not worry because we discovered recently 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
 that America is ON! 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 I'm here to introduce you to a new technology called the SALMON CANON 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.300
 It's happening on CBS this morning 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:43.210
 You know, you know Sometimes ... 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.710
 It is said that the news has lost its touch 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.510
 But there for once they have torn all fucking 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.710
 because a cannon, sending a fish over a barge 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.010
 it's absolutely amazing! 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.010
 If you wonder how it goes at the barrel exit 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.710
 the company that makes the gun, WHOOSHH Innovation 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.510
 has created a slow motion video about classical music 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:25.310
 In your greatest moments of despair ... 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.310
 when you will see a world tormented by war 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.320
 Remember this video and say: 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:37.020
 We can do great things We can do great things 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.320
 Let me tell you how much I love the salmon cannon 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:49.520
 I love it so much that we built ours! 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.020
 Let's see where this salmon lands 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:00.520
 The daily show John Stewart 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:08.020
 Ok ok it works. Let's try with 2. 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:17.020
 The Tonight Show Jimmy Fallon 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:23.320
 Very nice ! Let's try something more complicated! 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:30.020
 - You stole my daughter, what were you waiting for? -I do not deny it but I do not remember 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.430
 - It's convenient - it cost me your love! 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:51.030
 Clearly, it's the most awesome thing ever invented! 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.530
 Let's see how far we can go with this machine. 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:05.030
 Dwight Howard breaks two fingers while countering a salmon 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.030
 Stop, stop 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:41.530
 R2 Great! Except it's "Bleep bleep skwak bloop" 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.030
 I resign I can not work like that 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:09.730
 Shut up the Chewie! 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.530
 MMMmmm Salmon!
