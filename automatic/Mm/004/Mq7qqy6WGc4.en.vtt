00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
and close the top and you can see it's

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:20.920

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
because if the steam stays in there it's

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.220 
because if the steam stays in there it's
just<00:01:22.550> going<00:01:22.700> to<00:01:22.820> drip<00:01:23.210> back<00:01:23.420> into<00:01:23.450> the<00:01:23.810> oil<00:01:23.840> and
