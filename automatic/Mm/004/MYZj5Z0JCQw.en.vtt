00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
into search just want to go along press

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.050 
into search just want to go along press
up<00:01:24.750> so<00:01:25.259> this<00:01:25.439> method<00:01:25.740> is<00:01:26.100> quite<00:01:26.369> effective<00:01:26.490> and

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
up so this method is quite effective and

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.530 
up so this method is quite effective and
I<00:01:27.330> excuse<00:01:27.750> it<00:01:27.930> quite<00:01:28.170> a<00:01:28.200> bit<00:01:29.090> before<00:01:30.090> but

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
I excuse it quite a bit before but

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.240 
I excuse it quite a bit before but
basically<00:01:30.900> it<00:01:31.229> may<00:01:31.619> take<00:01:31.829> a<00:01:31.860> little<00:01:32.040> bit<00:01:32.159> of

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
basically it may take a little bit of

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.940 
basically it may take a little bit of
while<00:01:32.490> to<00:01:33.299> find<00:01:33.570> a<00:01:33.930> deal<00:01:34.350> you<00:01:34.590> might<00:01:34.770> have<00:01:34.860> to

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
while to find a deal you might have to

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.359 
while to find a deal you might have to
go<00:01:35.070> through<00:01:35.340> about<00:01:35.430> 50<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:35.970> 60<00:01:36.210> pages<00:01:37.009> but<00:01:38.009> you

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
go through about 50 to 60 pages but you

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.310 
go through about 50 to 60 pages but you
know<00:01:38.490> any<00:01:38.759> profit<00:01:39.210> is<00:01:39.299> good<00:01:39.479> profit<00:01:39.900> and<00:01:40.049> it's

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
know any profit is good profit and it's

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.469 
know any profit is good profit and it's
better<00:01:40.590> than<00:01:40.710> just<00:01:40.770> waiting<00:01:41.700> for<00:01:41.909> one<00:01:41.939> card

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
better than just waiting for one card

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.770 
better than just waiting for one card
over<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.140> over<00:01:43.200> again<00:01:43.939> because<00:01:44.939> a<00:01:45.390> lot<00:01:45.750> of

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
over and over again because a lot of

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.660 
over and over again because a lot of
people<00:01:45.869> don't<00:01:46.470> really<00:01:46.590> look<00:01:46.799> at<00:01:46.920> informs<00:01:47.490> and

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
people don't really look at informs and

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.690 
people don't really look at informs and
they<00:01:48.090> easily<00:01:48.329> slip<00:01:48.810> through<00:01:49.110> so<00:01:50.100> there's<00:01:50.520> no

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
they easily slip through so there's no
