00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
downloaded a file

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.480 
downloaded a file
it<00:00:13.080> was<00:00:13.440> started<00:00:13.830> out<00:00:13.980> to<00:00:14.160> be<00:00:14.190> a<00:00:16.190> Sketchup<00:00:17.190> file

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
it was started out to be a Sketchup file

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.970 
it was started out to be a Sketchup file
done<00:00:18.359> on<00:00:18.600> Sketchup<00:00:19.320> and<00:00:20.300> and<00:00:21.300> then<00:00:21.900> I<00:00:21.930> used<00:00:22.619> I

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.410 
done on Sketchup and and then I used I
actually<00:00:23.369> imported<00:00:24.240> it<00:00:24.420> with<00:00:25.609> 2013<00:00:26.609> Revit<00:00:27.240> and

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
actually imported it with 2013 Revit and

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.550 
actually imported it with 2013 Revit and
then<00:00:28.220> exported<00:00:29.220> that<00:00:29.550> to<00:00:30.390> an<00:00:30.510> FBX<00:00:30.990> file<00:00:31.289> which

here I will bring up the material list

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.969 
here I will bring up the material list
and<00:01:24.030> this<00:01:24.689> is<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:24.990> current<00:01:25.380> one<00:01:25.590> that's<00:01:25.799> in

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500 
let's see black here and maybe red here

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.980 
let's see black here and maybe red here
I<00:01:53.650> don't<00:01:54.490> know<00:01:54.700> all<00:01:54.850> the<00:01:55.000> colors<00:01:55.180> that<00:01:55.360> Optimus

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
of it I'm gonna select carbon fiber for

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.640 
of it I'm gonna select carbon fiber for
that<00:02:17.560> and<00:02:18.180> I<00:02:19.180> know<00:02:19.330> these<00:02:19.510> are<00:02:19.570> tires<00:02:20.020> so<00:02:20.530> they

that and I know these are tires so they

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.800 
that and I know these are tires so they
go<00:02:20.800> black<00:02:21.220> and<00:02:22.740> see<00:02:23.740> here<00:02:24.310> zoom<00:02:25.270> in<00:02:25.450> into<00:02:25.630> his

go black and see here zoom in into his
face<00:02:26.350> here<00:02:27.240> I<00:02:28.350> might<00:02:29.350> pick<00:02:30.000> red<00:02:31.000> or<00:02:32.130> black

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
face here I might pick red or black

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.860 
face here I might pick red or black
let's<00:02:34.480> see<00:02:34.780> black<00:02:35.380> yeah<00:02:36.040> looks<00:02:36.280> cool<00:02:36.490> that<00:02:36.550> way

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
let's see black yeah looks cool that way

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.770 
let's see black yeah looks cool that way
okay<00:02:37.870> so<00:02:37.930> uh<00:02:38.310> there's<00:02:39.310> my<00:02:39.520> little<00:02:40.240> Optimus

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
okay so uh there's my little Optimus

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.090 
okay so uh there's my little Optimus
Prime<00:02:41.080> that<00:02:41.770> I<00:02:42.100> downloaded<00:02:42.820> from<00:02:43.060> Google

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
Prime that I downloaded from Google

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:49.680 
Prime that I downloaded from Google
actually<00:02:45.209> native<00:02:47.100> Sketchup<00:02:48.540> converted<00:02:49.540> to

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
actually native Sketchup converted to

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.770 
actually native Sketchup converted to
Revit<00:02:50.080> and<00:02:50.520> there's<00:02:51.520> probably<00:02:51.880> an<00:02:52.030> easier<00:02:52.510> way

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
Revit and there's probably an easier way

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.430 
Revit and there's probably an easier way
of<00:02:52.810> doing<00:02:53.230> it<00:02:53.440> that<00:02:54.040> you<00:02:54.850> Autodesk<00:02:55.660> gurus<00:02:56.110> know

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
of doing it that you Autodesk gurus know

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.710 
of doing it that you Autodesk gurus know
but<00:02:57.160> this<00:02:57.280> is<00:02:57.459> just<00:02:57.640> a<00:02:57.850> simple<00:02:58.269> way<00:02:58.420> of<00:02:58.450> me

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
but this is just a simple way of me

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.370 
but this is just a simple way of me
doing<00:02:58.750> it<00:02:59.170> that<00:02:59.410> was<00:03:00.540> simple<00:03:01.540> for<00:03:01.600> familiar

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
doing it that was simple for familiar

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:07.410 
doing it that was simple for familiar
for<00:03:02.620> me<00:03:02.650> to<00:03:02.860> do<00:03:03.040> so<00:03:04.470> let's<00:03:05.470> see<00:03:05.800> also<00:03:06.400> you<00:03:07.300> know

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
for me to do so let's see also you know

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.290 
for me to do so let's see also you know
I<00:03:07.450> want<00:03:07.690> to<00:03:07.750> also<00:03:07.900> show<00:03:08.260> you<00:03:08.290> this<00:03:08.860> red<00:03:09.610> here<00:03:10.150> is

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:10.300 
I want to also show you this red here is

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.540 
I want to also show you this red here is
awfully<00:03:10.959> bright<00:03:11.290> red<00:03:11.709> and<00:03:11.920> I<00:03:11.950> want<00:03:12.130> to<00:03:12.190> for

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.550 
awfully bright red and I want to for

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:14.759 
awfully bright red and I want to for
being<00:03:12.760> plastic<00:03:13.330> I<00:03:13.480> want<00:03:13.690> to<00:03:13.780> darken<00:03:14.470> that<00:03:14.739> a

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
little bit you know a way of doing that

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.199 
little bit you know a way of doing that
is<00:03:17.410> go<00:03:17.650> right<00:03:17.860> up<00:03:17.980> to<00:03:18.010> here<00:03:18.250> expand<00:03:19.030> this

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
is go right up to here expand this

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
little menu here and go into material

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.830 
little menu here and go into material
properties<00:03:23.950> and<00:03:24.250> I'm<00:03:24.790> going<00:03:24.940> to<00:03:25.030> right<00:03:25.600> over

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
properties and I'm going to right over

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.600 
properties and I'm going to right over
here<00:03:26.110> just<00:03:26.260> darken<00:03:26.739> that<00:03:26.860> red<00:03:27.100> a<00:03:27.130> little<00:03:27.340> bit

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
here just darken that red a little bit

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.729 
here just darken that red a little bit
that<00:03:27.730> I<00:03:27.820> selected<00:03:28.420> and<00:03:28.660> I'm<00:03:29.230> gonna<00:03:29.380> do<00:03:29.560> the

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739 
that I selected and I'm gonna do the

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:31.670 
that I selected and I'm gonna do the
same<00:03:29.769> thing<00:03:30.040> with<00:03:30.489> this<00:03:30.670> one<00:03:30.730> dark

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
same thing with this one dark

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.599 
same thing with this one dark
a<00:03:31.709> little<00:03:32.069> bit<00:03:32.420> but<00:03:33.420> there<00:03:33.689> there<00:03:34.560> you<00:03:34.680> go<00:03:34.859> I'll

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:35.609 
a little bit but there there you go I'll

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:39.130 
a little bit but there there you go I'll
close<00:03:35.939> that<00:03:35.969> and<00:03:36.629> then<00:03:37.409> I<00:03:37.650> will<00:03:38.099> select<00:03:38.459> a

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140 
close that and then I will select a

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.319 
close that and then I will select a
environment<00:03:40.140> that<00:03:40.500> kind<00:03:40.950> of<00:03:41.010> looks<00:03:41.329> pretty

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:42.329 
environment that kind of looks pretty

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:44.569 
environment that kind of looks pretty
good<00:03:42.510> with<00:03:42.659> the<00:03:42.750> background

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:44.579 
good with the background

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:47.750 
good with the background
it's<00:03:44.939> populating<00:03:45.659> now<00:03:45.920> yeah<00:03:46.920> there<00:03:47.280> you<00:03:47.430> go

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
it's populating now yeah there you go

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.140 
it's populating now yeah there you go
so<00:03:48.719> there's<00:03:49.049> Optimus<00:03:49.799> Prime<00:03:50.129> in<00:03:50.370> a<00:03:50.609> grassy

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
so there's Optimus Prime in a grassy

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:56.080 
so there's Optimus Prime in a grassy
field<00:03:52.159> getting<00:03:53.159> ready<00:03:53.400> to<00:03:53.930> rule<00:03:54.930> the<00:03:55.079> world

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
field getting ready to rule the world

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:01.490 
field getting ready to rule the world
seeing<00:03:57.090> here<00:03:57.389> okay<00:03:58.109> and<00:03:58.819> so<00:03:59.819> there's<00:04:00.030> a<00:04:00.500> a

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
seeing here okay and so there's a a

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.740 
seeing here okay and so there's a a
little<00:04:02.370> another<00:04:02.760> little<00:04:03.090> short<00:04:03.329> video<00:04:03.510> an

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
little another little short video an

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.780 
little another little short video an
example<00:04:04.230> of<00:04:04.439> playing<00:04:04.769> around<00:04:04.919> with<00:04:05.220> Autodesk

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
example of playing around with Autodesk

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.270 
example of playing around with Autodesk
showcase<00:04:06.299> 2013<00:04:07.109> which<00:04:07.409> I<00:04:07.530> really<00:04:07.919> really<00:04:08.159> do

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
showcase 2013 which I really really do

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.649 
showcase 2013 which I really really do
like<00:04:08.489> and<00:04:08.730> I<00:04:08.790> did<00:04:08.970> check<00:04:09.870> the<00:04:10.049> price<00:04:10.290> of<00:04:10.620> this

00:04:11.649 --> 00:04:11.659 
like and I did check the price of this

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:14.449 
like and I did check the price of this
program<00:04:12.659> in<00:04:12.870> and<00:04:13.169> surprisingly<00:04:14.010> surprisingly

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
program in and surprisingly surprisingly

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:16.580 
program in and surprisingly surprisingly
enough<00:04:15.150> I<00:04:15.359> found<00:04:15.599> out<00:04:15.780> that<00:04:15.900> this<00:04:16.049> program<00:04:16.560> is

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
enough I found out that this program is

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:21.800 
enough I found out that this program is
actually<00:04:17.310> very<00:04:18.120> reasonable<00:04:18.900> and<00:04:19.019> in<00:04:19.440> cost<00:04:20.810> it

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
actually very reasonable and in cost it

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:25.010 
actually very reasonable and in cost it
was<00:04:22.280> roughly<00:04:23.280> under<00:04:23.820> $1,000<00:04:24.720> for<00:04:24.900> this

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
was roughly under $1,000 for this

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.210 
was roughly under $1,000 for this
program<00:04:25.550> so<00:04:26.550> it's<00:04:27.349> relatively<00:04:28.349> not<00:04:29.009> too

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
program so it's relatively not too

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.839 
program so it's relatively not too
expensive<00:04:31.070> anyway<00:04:32.070> so<00:04:32.220> that's<00:04:32.430> my<00:04:32.610> short

00:04:32.839 --> 00:04:32.849 
expensive anyway so that's my short

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:36.590 
expensive anyway so that's my short
video<00:04:33.180> and<00:04:33.509> we'll<00:04:33.930> see<00:04:34.169> you<00:04:34.289> next<00:04:34.349> time
