 encrypted this very attentive to the service of his fellow musicians as well as those of 

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:59.939
 different actors 

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:02.939
 of the electronic music industry 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:08.200
 it is thanks to his more than 40 years of passion interests for the accordion 

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:11.749
 that this magician leaves us on the accordion of tomorrow 

00:03:11.749 --> 00:03:15.129

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.429
 which contributed the biggest development of the Roma agreement 

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:28.760
 what does it grant long and what is the difference with a 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.699
 digital accordion 

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:33.699
 based on sampling technology 

00:03:34.719 --> 00:03:35.999
 these goods 

00:03:35.999 --> 00:03:38.339
 the problem of this technology 

00:03:38.339 --> 00:03:40.849
 is that the registration conditions may have to be 

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:42.329
 perfect 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:46.449
 they depend on many parameters like a sound environment of the studio 

00:03:47.119 --> 00:03:50.309
 microphones of the sound engineer this agreement 

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:53.099
 especially as 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:56.619

 there are several elements that determine these sounds 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:07.029
 lucho is complex 

00:04:07.029 --> 00:04:10.029

 for accordions the center was created from scratch 

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:20.000
 that all the parameters one can listen mulliez apart to give 

00:04:19.999 --> 00:04:23.849
 to the instrument all the expressiveness of the acoustic accordion 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:29.280
 the vercors of the shadows is the first instrument of its kind to combine 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.820
