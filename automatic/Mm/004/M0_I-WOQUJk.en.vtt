looks like a weird green light on it it

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.179 
looks like a weird green light on it it

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
looks very similar to the location that

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:46.850 
looks very similar to the location that
you<00:01:45.869> had<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.170> go<00:01:46.290> around<00:01:46.409> when<00:01:46.680> you<00:01:46.770> were

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
you had to go around when you were

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.410 
you had to go around when you were
infected<00:01:47.250> and<00:01:47.700> you<00:01:47.880> have<00:01:47.970> to<00:01:48.060> touch<00:01:48.240> the

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
infected and you have to touch the

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.510 
infected and you have to touch the
keypads<00:01:48.899> so<00:01:49.470> i<00:01:49.860> don't<00:01:50.130> know<00:01:50.189> if<00:01:50.250> you<00:01:50.340> have<00:01:50.430> to

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
keypads so i don't know if you have to

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.010 
keypads so i don't know if you have to
get<00:01:50.640> infected<00:01:50.970> go<00:01:51.240> touch<00:01:51.479> one<00:01:51.659> of<00:01:51.689> these<00:01:51.840> and

touch<00:01:52.140> several<00:01:52.590> of<00:01:52.680> them<00:01:52.860> so<00:01:52.979> they<00:01:53.100> might<00:01:53.280> be

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
touch several of them so they might be

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.880 
touch several of them so they might be
near<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:54.000> vicinity<00:01:54.119> so<00:01:54.570> definitely<00:01:55.409> be<00:01:55.680> on
