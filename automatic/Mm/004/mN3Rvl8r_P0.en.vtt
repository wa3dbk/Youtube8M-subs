00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
until she stops hopping I'd rather end a

you can take popcorn you can grind you
into<00:01:04.530> cornmeal<00:01:05.659> so<00:01:06.659> it's<00:01:06.840> very<00:01:07.080> very

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
into cornmeal so it's very very

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.460 
into cornmeal so it's very very
versatile<00:01:08.580> all<00:01:09.240> right<00:01:09.420> stores<00:01:09.869> for<00:01:10.140> a<00:01:10.170> long

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
versatile all right stores for a long

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.910 
versatile all right stores for a long
time<00:01:11.600> so<00:01:12.600> if<00:01:12.750> you<00:01:12.840> don't<00:01:13.020> have<00:01:13.200> popcorn<00:01:13.560> in

your your long-term plan you should and

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.890 
your your long-term plan you should and
then<00:01:16.979> think<00:01:17.220> about<00:01:17.310> growing<00:01:17.790> some<00:01:18.030> for

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
then think about growing some for

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.310 
then think about growing some for
sustainability<00:01:22.340> get<00:01:23.340> a<00:01:23.369> little<00:01:23.700> bit<00:01:23.820> harder

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320

I<00:01:53.270> could<00:01:54.270> have<00:01:54.360> gone<00:01:54.479> a<00:01:54.509> few<00:01:54.720> more<00:01:54.869> minutes<00:01:55.250> but

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
I could have gone a few more minutes but

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.690 
I could have gone a few more minutes but
basically<00:01:56.670> all<00:01:56.939> it<00:01:56.970> is<00:01:57.979> as<00:01:58.979> you<00:01:59.189> can<00:01:59.310> see<00:01:59.549> the

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
basically all it is as you can see the

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.600 
basically all it is as you can see the
little<00:01:59.820> handle<00:02:00.149> turning<00:02:00.770> and<00:02:01.770> that<00:02:02.310> keeps<00:02:02.520> it

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
little handle turning and that keeps it

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.680 
little handle turning and that keeps it
from<00:02:02.759> burning<00:02:03.619> tell<00:02:04.619> what<00:02:04.770> you<00:02:04.890> can<00:02:05.039> do<00:02:05.220> oh<00:02:05.690> you

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:06.690 
from burning tell what you can do oh you

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.639 
from burning tell what you can do oh you
can<00:02:06.929> salt<00:02:07.319> it<00:02:08.569> we<00:02:09.569> have<00:02:09.720> long-term<00:02:10.170> butter

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
can salt it we have long-term butter

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.759 
can salt it we have long-term butter
plus<00:02:10.950> you<00:02:11.190> can<00:02:11.310> can<00:02:11.519> your<00:02:11.700> own<00:02:11.819> butter<00:02:12.709> so<00:02:13.709> you

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:13.769 
plus you can can your own butter so you

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:17.960 
plus you can can your own butter so you
can<00:02:14.010> have<00:02:14.160> popcorn<00:02:15.110> at<00:02:16.110> any<00:02:16.319> time<00:02:16.590> I<00:02:16.910> think<00:02:17.910> it

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
can have popcorn at any time I think it

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.720 
can have popcorn at any time I think it
would<00:02:18.090> be<00:02:18.150> more<00:02:18.180> of<00:02:18.390> a<00:02:18.510> treat<00:02:19.319> but<00:02:20.160> it's<00:02:20.310> also<00:02:20.519> a

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
would be more of a treat but it's also a
