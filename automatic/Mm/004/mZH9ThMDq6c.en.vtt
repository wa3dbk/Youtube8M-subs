looking at this video as you can see

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.540 
looking at this video as you can see
Kobe<00:00:44.300> Bryant<00:00:44.809> is<00:00:44.930> dribbling<00:00:45.890> the<00:00:45.949> ball<00:00:46.190> and

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
Kobe Bryant is dribbling the ball and

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.569 
Kobe Bryant is dribbling the ball and
all<00:00:46.969> the<00:00:47.180> sudden<00:00:47.390> he<00:00:47.750> falls<00:00:48.050> down<00:00:48.430> no<00:00:49.430> one

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:49.579 
all the sudden he falls down no one

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:53.229 
all the sudden he falls down no one
knows<00:00:49.789> what's<00:00:50.059> going<00:00:50.390> on<00:00:50.539> because<00:00:52.090> no<00:00:53.090> one

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:53.239 
knows what's going on because no one

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:55.299 
knows what's going on because no one
really<00:00:53.270> touched<00:00:53.930> him<00:00:54.140> or<00:00:54.260> pushed<00:00:54.559> him<00:00:54.770> he<00:00:55.070> just

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:55.309 
really touched him or pushed him he just

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:57.580 
really touched him or pushed him he just
fell<00:00:55.520> down<00:00:55.550> and<00:00:56.059> you<00:00:56.090> can<00:00:56.899> see<00:00:57.050> it<00:00:57.140> from<00:00:57.289> both

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:57.590 
fell down and you can see it from both

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.680 
fell down and you can see it from both
angles<00:01:00.399> the<00:01:01.399> reason<00:01:01.699> he<00:01:01.820> fell<00:01:02.090> down<00:01:02.329> was

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
angles the reason he fell down was

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.139 
angles the reason he fell down was
because<00:01:03.050> as<00:01:03.339> he<00:01:04.339> was<00:01:04.460> taking<00:01:04.759> a<00:01:04.850> step

00:01:05.139 --> 00:01:05.149 
because as he was taking a step

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:07.690 
because as he was taking a step
dribbling<00:01:05.690> the<00:01:05.720> ball<00:01:05.990> he<00:01:06.890> tore<00:01:07.160> his<00:01:07.310> Achilles

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
dribbling the ball he tore his Achilles

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.669 
dribbling the ball he tore his Achilles
tendon<00:01:07.759> as<00:01:08.270> you<00:01:08.420> can<00:01:08.630> see<00:01:08.960> he<00:01:09.200> kind<00:01:09.410> of<00:01:09.440> looked

00:01:09.669 --> 00:01:09.679 
tendon as you can see he kind of looked

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:12.389 
tendon as you can see he kind of looked
back<00:01:09.770> to<00:01:10.130> see<00:01:10.280> if<00:01:10.369> someone<00:01:10.789> stepped<00:01:11.119> on<00:01:11.330> his

00:01:12.389 --> 00:01:12.399 
back to see if someone stepped on his

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:16.719 
back to see if someone stepped on his
heel<00:01:13.399> or<00:01:14.080> someone<00:01:15.080> hit<00:01:15.320> his<00:01:15.470> foot<00:01:16.190> from<00:01:16.399> behind

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:16.729 
heel or someone hit his foot from behind

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:18.460 
heel or someone hit his foot from behind
because<00:01:16.970> that's<00:01:17.300> what<00:01:17.509> it<00:01:17.630> really<00:01:17.840> feels<00:01:17.959> like

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
because that's what it really feels like

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.020 
because that's what it really feels like
when<00:01:19.280> you<00:01:19.580> tear<00:01:20.539> your<00:01:20.750> Achilles<00:01:21.080> tendon<00:01:21.110> and

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030 
when you tear your Achilles tendon and

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.350 
when you tear your Achilles tendon and
because<00:01:23.030> he<00:01:23.179> couldn't<00:01:23.860> push<00:01:24.860> off<00:01:25.209> with<00:01:26.209> his

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
because he couldn't push off with his

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.930 
because he couldn't push off with his
left<00:01:26.599> foot<00:01:26.830> he<00:01:27.830> naturally<00:01:28.250> fell<00:01:28.849> down<00:01:29.119> and

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:30.940 
left foot he naturally fell down and

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:37.630 
left foot he naturally fell down and
extreme<00:01:31.940> pain<00:01:34.599> follows<00:01:35.599> right<00:01:35.780> after<00:01:36.200> and<00:01:36.640> the

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
extreme pain follows right after and the

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.430 
extreme pain follows right after and the
pain<00:01:37.819> actually<00:01:37.970> subsides<00:01:38.599> right<00:01:38.899> afterwards

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:39.440 
pain actually subsides right afterwards

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.309 
pain actually subsides right afterwards
and<00:01:39.739> then<00:01:40.009> later<00:01:40.610> on<00:01:40.729> it<00:01:41.270> becomes<00:01:41.959> more<00:01:42.200> and

00:01:42.309 --> 00:01:42.319 
and then later on it becomes more and

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:46.180 
and then later on it becomes more and
more<00:01:42.410> painful<00:01:42.950> so<00:01:43.580> I<00:01:43.970> have<00:01:44.420> prepared<00:01:45.020> a<00:01:45.319> video

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:46.190 
more painful so I have prepared a video

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.389 
more painful so I have prepared a video
animation<00:01:46.849> that<00:01:47.179> will<00:01:47.390> show<00:01:47.690> you<00:01:47.750> how<00:01:48.399> Kobe

animation<00:01:55.849> you<00:01:56.119> you<00:01:56.690> see<00:01:57.140> how<00:01:57.410> he<00:01:58.629> takes<00:01:59.629> a

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
animation you you see how he takes a

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:02.800 
animation you you see how he takes a
first<00:02:00.500> step<00:02:00.860> dribbling<00:02:01.459> the<00:02:01.489> ball<00:02:01.759> and<00:02:02.090> his

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
first step dribbling the ball and his

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.839 
first step dribbling the ball and his
foot<00:02:03.200> goes<00:02:03.440> into<00:02:03.830> a<00:02:03.860> awkward<00:02:04.700> position<00:02:05.629> and

00:02:06.839 --> 00:02:06.849 
foot goes into a awkward position and

00:02:06.849 --> 00:02:10.419 
foot goes into a awkward position and
he's<00:02:07.849> pushing<00:02:08.360> off<00:02:08.539> with<00:02:09.500> his<00:02:09.679> left<00:02:09.709> foot<00:02:10.220> and

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
he's pushing off with his left foot and

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:14.170 
he's pushing off with his left foot and
as<00:02:11.209> he's<00:02:11.480> doing<00:02:11.750> that<00:02:11.959> his<00:02:12.670> heel<00:02:13.670> cord<00:02:13.970> or

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
as he's doing that his heel cord or

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.050 
as he's doing that his heel cord or
Achilles<00:02:14.569> tendon<00:02:14.989> tears<00:02:15.800> completely<00:02:16.550> and<00:02:16.760> he

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
Achilles tendon tears completely and he

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.440 
Achilles tendon tears completely and he
was<00:02:17.330> not<00:02:17.569> able<00:02:17.900> to<00:02:18.200> push<00:02:19.190> off<00:02:19.459> and<00:02:19.819> he<00:02:20.180> fells

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
was not able to push off and he fells

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.289 
was not able to push off and he fells
down<00:02:20.689> and<00:02:20.959> a<00:02:21.290> closer<00:02:21.859> look

00:02:23.289 --> 00:02:23.299 
down and a closer look

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:28.819 
down and a closer look
shows<00:02:24.299> that<00:02:24.799> when<00:02:25.799> he<00:02:26.129> pushes<00:02:26.970> off<00:02:27.829> because

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:28.829 
shows that when he pushes off because

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:34.759 
shows that when he pushes off because
probably<00:02:29.280> had<00:02:29.670> a<00:02:30.709> weakness<00:02:31.709> of<00:02:32.010> the<00:02:33.769> Achilles

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769

tendon<00:02:34.799> in<00:02:35.400> in<00:02:36.299> an<00:02:37.290> area<00:02:37.709> that's<00:02:38.040> about

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:40.549 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:43.280 

probably<00:02:41.549> three<00:02:42.180> to<00:02:42.360> four<00:02:42.569> centimeter<00:02:43.049> above

probably three to four centimeter above
the<00:02:43.769> insertion<00:02:44.430> of<00:02:44.549> the<00:02:44.790> Achilles<00:02:45.599> tendon

00:03:33.619 --> 00:03:33.629 
inserting the device on the top portion

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:35.599 
inserting the device on the top portion
of<00:03:33.959> the<00:03:34.109> Achilles<00:03:34.379> tendon<00:03:34.440> and<00:03:34.889> sutures<00:03:35.370> go

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:35.609 
of the Achilles tendon and sutures go

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:40.490 
of the Achilles tendon and sutures go
across<00:03:35.910> and<00:03:37.609> usually<00:03:38.609> there's<00:03:38.790> three<00:03:39.500> sutures

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
across and usually there's three sutures

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.180 
across and usually there's three sutures
these<00:03:40.739> are<00:03:41.419> non-absorbable<00:03:42.919> we<00:03:43.919> call<00:03:44.069> them

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
these are non-absorbable we call them

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.390 
these are non-absorbable we call them
fiber<00:03:44.489> wire<00:03:44.849> sutures<00:03:45.419> that<00:03:46.199> gets<00:03:46.680> put<00:03:47.370> through

the Achilles tendon on the top portion

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.580 
the Achilles tendon on the top portion
and<00:03:49.919> then<00:03:50.609> you<00:03:50.970> repeat<00:03:51.419> the<00:03:51.569> same<00:03:51.840> step<00:03:52.290> on<00:03:52.500> the

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
and then you repeat the same step on the

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.539 
and then you repeat the same step on the
bottom<00:03:53.549> portion<00:03:53.790> of<00:03:54.120> the<00:03:54.180> Achilles<00:03:54.599> tendon

00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:55.549 
bottom portion of the Achilles tendon

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:59.300 
bottom portion of the Achilles tendon
this<00:03:56.549> is<00:03:56.699> granted<00:03:57.239> if<00:03:57.919> the<00:03:58.919> Achilles<00:03:59.280> tendon

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
this is granted if the Achilles tendon

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:04.670 
this is granted if the Achilles tendon
was<00:04:00.230> torn<00:04:01.549> above<00:04:02.549> the<00:04:02.819> insertion<00:04:03.359> if<00:04:03.599> the<00:04:04.440> tear

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
was torn above the insertion if the tear

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.559 
was torn above the insertion if the tear
is<00:04:04.889> right<00:04:05.099> at<00:04:05.280> the<00:04:05.400> insertion<00:04:05.879> you<00:04:06.030> cannot<00:04:06.269> use

00:04:06.559 --> 00:04:06.569 
is right at the insertion you cannot use

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:09.259 
is right at the insertion you cannot use
this<00:04:06.780> device<00:04:07.069> so<00:04:08.069> after<00:04:08.609> we<00:04:08.849> have<00:04:09.030> these

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:09.269 
this device so after we have these

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:12.080 
this device so after we have these
strings<00:04:09.810> we<00:04:10.500> tie<00:04:11.129> them<00:04:11.190> together<00:04:11.519> and<00:04:11.940> the

strings we tie them together and the

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:17.949 
strings we tie them together and the
Achilles<00:04:12.389> tendon<00:04:12.859> comes<00:04:14.150> together<00:04:15.150> and<00:04:15.599> you

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
Achilles tendon comes together and you

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:23.480 
Achilles tendon comes together and you
repair<00:04:18.959> it<00:04:18.989> at<00:04:19.320> this<00:04:19.500> point<00:04:19.769> and<00:04:21.800> the<00:04:22.800> skin<00:04:23.190> is

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
repair it at this point and the skin is

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.719 
repair it at this point and the skin is
closed<00:04:24.000> and<00:04:24.330> the<00:04:24.690> patient<00:04:25.260> usually<00:04:25.470> goes<00:04:26.340> into
