00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.440
 hello we will introduce you to the 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:10.420
 perforated microphone on lines 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.639
 back we took a model c3 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:14.260
 which is a pretty complicated vehicle for 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:17.320
 explain to you what to do and what 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:19.890
 which is worth avoiding first step us 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:22.540
 remove the rear wiper 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.250
 if there are stickers we will 

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:25.230
 worth the glue with the 10th ' real bad 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:30.750
 number one 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:35.440
 otherwise we think of cleaning with the 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:37.030
 final tinner degreaser products because the 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.769
 cleaning and degreasing the interior 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:45.309
 is an important part of France 

00:00:38.769 --> 00:00:46.719
 have micro perforated we have our 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:49.120
 perforated microphone that we have to ask his 

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:51.280
 island is backward I will use the ass 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.339
 jim small specific device for 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.780
 cut the liner without damaging the vinyl 

00:00:53.339 --> 00:01:00.749
 so I'm going to do my first 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:04.379
 cut in the middle of the vinyl to separate 

00:01:00.749 --> 00:01:05.500
 my break so just cards slightly 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.290
 mobinil 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:11.680
 I spend my little dance blade I 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:14.350
 recalls an essential point the microphone 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:20.530
 perforated is a vinyl that arise at 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:22.810
 dry and not to the water the use of 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.700
 the squeegee with the felt is 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:30.540
 necessary to prevent scratches on 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:33.130
 the vinyl so here I do my case age 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.740
 then I'm going to detour and my 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:39.960
 wipers and my kalach is over 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.960
 now let's remove the liner 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:52.520
 so cutting and ease 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:02:00.399
 by our action of just now I 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:02:00.399
 simply sets the middle and 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:12.780
 I withdraw our party then the first 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:16.050
 thing you must not do is 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:18.660
 push the folds when we have prices on 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:22.530
 not push the folds not draw on the 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:24.720
 vinyl to not generate tracks that 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.630
 will appear directly or if we 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.459
 can push them later 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:33.060
 so the first thing to do is 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:36.360
 to really stretch the vinyl for that 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:39.840
 we will vote slightly the upper part 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:42.900
 or remove from the constraint 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:48.270
 we were well taken bing vinyls years 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:49.530
 position is here at the time we 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.360
 let's see that we have folds 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.540
 horizontal it's perfectly normal 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:58.050
 read a simple action of 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:00.410
 transition to the grave and will do them 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.410
 disappear 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:10.379
 ditto for the high toulon like a 

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:12.459
 small addition up 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:15.280
 we are renewing the operation 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:16.959
 few schools up to the high place the 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.120
 high part slightly folded for not 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:21.579
 be disturbed by the spoiler and 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.920
 warming shoes just going 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:39.639
 to be able to reach a little vinyl 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:41.049
 months ago it 's songs so slightly 

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:43.510
 we can also use memory 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:44.109
 of vinyl form as there is a 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:47.739
 voltage 

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:50.439
 we will recover from the material to 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:52.299
 with the help of a bald one can 

00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:56.579
 return the vinyl to its shape 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:59.739
 initial light little raclette 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:02.799
 regular slightly an arc of a circle 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:05.609
 a constant pressure makes it possible to come 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:05.609
 fix the vinyl 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:28.590
 if the vinyl is applied to the edge 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:29.370
 of the glass like this without any 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:34.040
 constraint 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:34.040
 there is no reason for him to take off 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:44.600
 we see here all along the 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:49.120
 rear window that there is not at all 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:52.940
 folds vinyl has no constraint 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:55.060
 immediately after the tension of 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:05:01.280
 applied beans must be marouflaged 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:03.130
 immediately to avoid the appearance 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.900
 of bubbles 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:06.800
 once the vinyl is applied we will 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:09.110
 proceed to the cuts 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.840
 we're going to do here on all the 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:14.780
 around a shaving cut a little bit of 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:17.890
 blow not shaved one in a bed 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:21.070
 manager of the 45 degrees of the cutter 

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:21.070
 down 

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:32.010
 I advise you twice the cut 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:34.380
 finished putting a little hot shot 

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:39.860
 to come to finish applying 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:39.860
 perfectly the edge of the moon is a 

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:46.320
 it is very important to finalize well 

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:49.170
 the angles to not have a risk 

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:50.400
 savings to make the cut at 

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:55.610
 level of the wiper we have 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:55.610
 used the blue mare cut in support 

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:07.160
 so we use the little crook 

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:10.190
 facilitate the passage of the film under the 

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:12.500
 joined once more we will 

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:14.600
 use the movie memory one for 

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:16.780
 come marry perfectly the outline of the 

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:16.780
 yellow 

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:26.010
 if you feel that you are close to 

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:27.840
 the maximum size of the vinyl you 

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:29.970
 can always to strengthen the 

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:35.510
 fixing to stitch a ring of 

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:42.120
 sealing or position it on the edge 

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:45.650
 of the perforated microphone and you just go 

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:45.650
 pass inside 

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:52.600
 like this 

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:56.050
 think that if you have a seal at this 

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:58.480
 level there the sealing band must 

00:06:56.050 --> 00:07:02.370
 well be on the glazing and not on the 

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:05.350
 joint we apply the young to the rounded 

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:08.230
 who after I go with the racket the 

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:13.090
 pass between the windows and the 

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:15.570
 attached that may well stuck like those 

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:18.280
 on the glazing and not on the jury 

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:21.450
 if the band to move away well applied 

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:24.100
 we see almost no difference 

00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:29.320
 all that remains is to put back the towel 

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:30.580
 ice and the break is over 

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:32.410
 if you want to specialize in the 

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:36.120
 filming etc 6 we are at your 

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:36.120
 provision a training center
