with<00:02:50.110> cupholders<00:02:52.079> I'm<00:02:53.079> just<00:02:53.319> some<00:02:53.500> CDs<00:02:53.950> that<00:02:54.160> I

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
with cupholders I'm just some CDs that I

00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:00.030 
with cupholders I'm just some CDs that I
listen<00:02:54.549> to<00:02:54.700> more<00:02:55.690> storage<00:02:55.930> space<00:02:55.989> up<00:02:56.319> here<00:02:59.040> and

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
listen to more storage space up here and

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.259 
listen to more storage space up here and
that's<00:03:00.190> pretty<00:03:00.310> much<00:03:00.430> it<00:03:00.670> oh<00:03:00.760> yeah<00:03:00.970> right<00:03:01.150> out

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269 
that's pretty much it oh yeah right out

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:04.740 
that's pretty much it oh yeah right out
of<00:03:01.329> the<00:03:01.420> clock<00:03:01.769> so<00:03:02.819> is<00:03:03.819> it<00:03:04.060> a<00:03:04.120> sub<00:03:04.390> display<00:03:04.629> if

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
of the clock so is it a sub display if

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.900 
of the clock so is it a sub display if
you<00:03:04.870> want<00:03:05.019> to<00:03:05.079> call<00:03:05.200> of<00:03:05.319> that<00:03:05.470> only<00:03:05.980> nice<00:03:06.459> dials

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
you want to call of that only nice dials

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:08.940 
you want to call of that only nice dials
still<00:03:07.660> very<00:03:07.870> basic<00:03:08.260> this<00:03:08.379> car<00:03:08.560> doesn't<00:03:08.829> really

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
still very basic this car doesn't really

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.170 
still very basic this car doesn't really
offer<00:03:09.099> anything<00:03:10.769> no<00:03:11.769> electric<00:03:12.670> windows<00:03:13.000> or

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
offer anything no electric windows or

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:18.870 
offer anything no electric windows or
whatnot<00:03:14.280> so<00:03:15.280> we<00:03:15.310> got<00:03:17.340> of<00:03:18.340> course<00:03:18.579> the<00:03:18.670> fuel

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
whatnot so we got of course the fuel

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.270 
whatnot so we got of course the fuel
gauge<00:03:19.030> over<00:03:19.269> there<00:03:19.569> just<00:03:20.380> puts<00:03:20.769> added<00:03:21.100> power

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
gauge over there just puts added power

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.670 
gauge over there just puts added power
around<00:03:21.489> here

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.210 

this<00:03:25.310> is<00:03:25.549> okay<00:03:26.420> that's<00:03:27.409> off<00:03:27.590> radio<00:03:27.980> thank

190 kilometers an hour mark that's
pretty<00:03:41.989> quick<00:03:42.170> really<00:03:42.560> my<00:03:42.950> previous<00:03:43.310> car

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:43.489 
pretty quick really my previous car

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:45.759 
pretty quick really my previous car
could<00:03:43.730> barely<00:03:43.939> do<00:03:44.180> I<00:03:44.510> couldn't<00:03:45.109> even<00:03:45.260> do<00:03:45.439> 100

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:45.769 
could barely do I couldn't even do 100

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:47.410 
could barely do I couldn't even do 100
miles<00:03:45.890> an<00:03:46.069> hour<00:03:46.189> so<00:03:46.670> that<00:03:46.819> so<00:03:47.150> it<00:03:47.239> couldn't

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.420 
miles an hour so that so it couldn't

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.990 
miles an hour so that so it couldn't
even<00:03:47.569> do<00:03:47.629> 160<00:03:48.260> kilometers<00:03:48.680> an<00:03:48.769> hour<00:03:49.000> which

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
even do 160 kilometers an hour which

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.759 
even do 160 kilometers an hour which
sucks<00:03:50.599> pretty<00:03:50.720> much<00:03:50.959> this<00:03:51.260> car<00:03:51.470> is<00:03:51.560> a<00:03:51.590> bit

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:51.769 
sucks pretty much this car is a bit

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:54.899 
sucks pretty much this car is a bit
faster<00:03:52.099> than<00:03:52.189> that<00:03:52.480> my<00:03:53.480> previous<00:03:53.870> car<00:03:54.049> had<00:03:54.200> an

00:03:54.899 --> 00:03:54.909 
faster than that my previous car had an

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:59.259 
faster than that my previous car had an
0-200<00:03:55.909> time<00:03:56.120> of<00:03:57.109> 20<00:03:57.620> seconds<00:03:58.069> this<00:03:58.790> car<00:03:59.030> can<00:03:59.180> do

00:03:59.259 --> 00:03:59.269 
0-200 time of 20 seconds this car can do

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:04.899 
0-200 time of 20 seconds this car can do
it<00:03:59.389> in<00:03:59.450> 12<00:03:59.720> even<00:04:00.650> less<00:04:00.889> if<00:04:01.099> I<00:04:01.250> try<00:04:03.459> so<00:04:04.459> so<00:04:04.670> far

00:04:04.899 --> 00:04:04.909 
it in 12 even less if I try so so far

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:08.890 
it in 12 even less if I try so so far
I've<00:04:05.150> used<00:04:05.180> about<00:04:05.599> a<00:04:06.970> little<00:04:07.970> over<00:04:08.150> 30<00:04:08.510> liters

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
I've used about a little over 30 liters

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.199 
I've used about a little over 30 liters
of<00:04:09.049> fuel<00:04:09.230> and<00:04:09.560> I've<00:04:09.650> come<00:04:09.950> almost<00:04:10.790> 500

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:11.209 
of fuel and I've come almost 500

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:13.839 
of fuel and I've come almost 500
kilometres<00:04:11.659> so<00:04:12.189> it's<00:04:13.189> not<00:04:13.400> really<00:04:13.819> that

00:04:13.839 --> 00:04:13.849 
kilometres so it's not really that

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:16.150 
kilometres so it's not really that
economical<00:04:14.659> but<00:04:14.870> no<00:04:15.349> it's<00:04:15.560> better<00:04:15.709> than<00:04:15.950> that

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160 
economical but no it's better than that

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:17.699 
economical but no it's better than that
than<00:04:16.820> nothing<00:04:17.150> I<00:04:17.239> suppose

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
than nothing I suppose

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:21.520 
than nothing I suppose
my<00:04:18.709> previous<00:04:18.919> car<00:04:19.190> could<00:04:19.370> do<00:04:19.489> a<00:04:20.530> 600

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 
my previous car could do a 600

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:26.080 
my previous car could do a 600
kilometres<00:04:21.949> on<00:04:22.070> 30<00:04:22.250> liters<00:04:22.639> but<00:04:23.349> yeah<00:04:24.349> I<00:04:25.090> don't

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 
kilometres on 30 liters but yeah I don't

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:28.420 
kilometres on 30 liters but yeah I don't
really<00:04:26.240> care<00:04:26.539> so<00:04:26.750> let<00:04:27.590> me<00:04:27.680> fire<00:04:27.860> it<00:04:27.889> up<00:04:28.070> for<00:04:28.280> you
