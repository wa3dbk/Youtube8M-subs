a<00:05:16.919> duty<00:05:17.159> tote<00:05:17.370> is<00:05:17.550> it's<00:05:17.969> kind<00:05:18.270> of<00:05:18.300> that<00:05:18.419> dumping

00:05:18.769 --> 00:05:18.779 
a duty tote is it's kind of that dumping

00:05:20.209 --> 00:05:20.219 
ground but I never feel like it's

00:05:20.219 --> 00:05:22.070

overwhelming<00:05:20.490> on<00:05:20.879> my<00:05:20.969> figure<00:05:21.330> this<00:05:21.750> is<00:05:21.810> that

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 
overwhelming on my figure this is that

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.320 
overwhelming on my figure this is that
same<00:05:22.289> idea<00:05:22.529> where<00:05:22.949> you<00:05:23.279> can<00:05:23.520> dump<00:05:23.759> things<00:05:24.090> in

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:24.330 
same idea where you can dump things in

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:26.179 
same idea where you can dump things in
it<00:05:24.509> but<00:05:24.659> it's<00:05:24.960> not<00:05:25.080> just<00:05:25.139> this<00:05:25.469> giant<00:05:26.009> bag

00:05:26.179 --> 00:05:26.189 
it but it's not just this giant bag

00:05:26.189 --> 00:05:27.769 
it but it's not just this giant bag
that's<00:05:26.460> like<00:05:26.610> knocking<00:05:26.849> people<00:05:27.330> behind<00:05:27.569> you

00:05:27.769 --> 00:05:27.779 
that's like knocking people behind you

00:05:27.779 --> 00:05:29.300 
that's like knocking people behind you
in<00:05:27.900> front<00:05:28.199> of<00:05:28.289> you<00:05:28.439> exactly<00:05:28.949> if<00:05:29.159> you

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:29.310 
in front of you exactly if you

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:30.950 
in front of you exactly if you
definitely<00:05:29.789> keep<00:05:30.000> it<00:05:30.150> contained<00:05:30.509> which<00:05:30.810> is

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960 
definitely keep it contained which is

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.899 
definitely keep it contained which is
nice<00:05:31.139> I<00:05:31.349> mean<00:05:31.500> like<00:05:31.919> I<00:05:32.039> said<00:05:32.099> that<00:05:32.400> full-size
