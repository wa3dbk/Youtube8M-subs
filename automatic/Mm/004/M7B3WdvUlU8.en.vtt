00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:21.850 
right course I was at I left but then I

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:23.250 
right course I was at I left but then I
realized<00:05:22.180> that<00:05:22.270> where<00:05:22.510> I<00:05:22.540> am<00:05:22.720> so<00:05:22.930> I<00:05:22.960> had<00:05:23.050> to<00:05:23.140> go

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:23.260 
realized that where I am so I had to go

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:27.120 
realized that where I am so I had to go
down<00:05:23.530> to<00:05:23.700> Wooster<00:05:25.260> bit<00:05:26.260> where<00:05:26.680> you<00:05:26.830> just<00:05:27.010> go

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:27.130 
down to Wooster bit where you just go

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:28.920 
down to Wooster bit where you just go
from<00:05:27.280> one<00:05:27.550> end<00:05:27.940> to<00:05:28.450> the<00:05:28.540> next

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:28.930 
from one end to the next

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:32.760 
from one end to the next
yeah<00:05:29.290> so<00:05:30.210> we're<00:05:31.210> gonna<00:05:31.330> go<00:05:31.540> towards<00:05:31.720> route<00:05:32.080> 20

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:32.770
