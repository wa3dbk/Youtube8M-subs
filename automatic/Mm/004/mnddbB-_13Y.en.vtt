 was an object to complement the 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.920
 brush and paint and to start the 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:42.899
 work we are going to take approximately 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:45.110

 this part and puts it into the 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.199
 bottle to make work easier 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:59.760
 we will pass the glue and spread with the 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:01:02.850
 brush and now we'll start to change

 My magic in the bottle is more 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:10.220
 easy and as you go about wrapping you up 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.220
