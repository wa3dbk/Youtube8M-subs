00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.890
 she would like us to reach a goal 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.660
 more than anything of 400 light I know that if 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.730
 you can reach more than 400 like with the 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.859
 last support we have had for this 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.720
 great channel and good guys now yes 

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:07.000
 you have to start with everything and we're going to 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.350
 take away the third person and now yes 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.910
 let's go to the level that I did here 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.520
 well the truth luisgé well sensual louis 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:15.429
 so big malpensados ​​malpensados ​​ok 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.619
 ok and good one little thing that ends up here 

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:19.390
 fart a sheep there is not a sheep here 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:21.190
 in the leader and good guys we are already going to 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.890
 start with everything and the first 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:26.950
 curiosity the most important one for me 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.479
 is that here the water basically the 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.790
 first curiosity is that the water in the 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:31.420
 leader basically you put water in the 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.549
 never 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.979
 we are going to be able or is it a curiosity 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:37.270
 that some open others not, but that's why 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:39.850
 I bring it so all the curiosities 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:42.700
 I do not know what I'm going to bring them, ok guys 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.380
 and good water can not be basically 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.119
 you can not put in the cne see what it is 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.460
 the other curiosity good guys we're going to 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:52.299
 put this jar here of lava 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:55.390
 and to see around here and here guys 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:58.150
 ok if you for an example let's see if 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.310
 you put to see curse that I just 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.930
 load the keep like we're going to put it 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.750
 here a little bit of lava to see we are going to 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:07.869
 put a little bit of lava in there we go to 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.670
 put Jorge already I'm burning ok 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:12.220
 example you want to chop you are going to apply 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.260
 here very very beautiful and good you find 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.720
 lava that will happen that the lava in the 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.730
 leader is going to be super super fast like 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.100
 if it were water in what is a world 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.019
 normal that is if you picas and basically 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:25.300
 you find fast lava or you're already 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:27.459
 dead in a matter of seconds already 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.500
 touch the lava so you have to have a lot 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:31.450
 Beware of the colo which is the lava in the 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.400
 you have to be very careful and therefore 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.170
 the water can not put another little thing 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.360
 that they will find every time they go to 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:40.110
 find this type of gravel floating 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:42.459
 as if nothing as if not or is the 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.320
 leader there is always what things are 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:45.880
 weird so well I'm going to put a 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.519
 little bit of lava here so you see more or 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.230
 less than when you put lava the effect of 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:52.180
 fall makes them fall so there it is or 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.970
 it just dropped everything that is 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:57.250
 floating by inertia more than anything 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.930
 it's going to fall out ok guys so 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.970
 good another little thing that also many do not 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.310
 you know is that this block the arena of 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.830
 soul serves as something troll you put 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:09.160
 behind the door and then when you 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:11.020
 when you enter a normal house you 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.760
 you can put here and for example let's 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:15.010
 Let's assume to see're going to get 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.440
 this block we're going to put the we're going to 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.240
 put a door here and basically you 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.520
 you put a door here what's here does not 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:23.500
 I know why it went wrong to see let's see 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:25.510
 Okay it's a little bad but hey 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.670
 it is assumed that when the sand of souls 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.430
 is on the floor for example is here 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:32.140
 Below you can enter you can 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.870
 enter basically enter the house 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:37.600
 great but when when you want 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.040
 leave open the door you will not be able or 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.750
 either when you are in a normal house is 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.190
 like something troll that you can also 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.200
 to do is one thing that has nothing to do 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:45.910
 a lot with this but well I know 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.380
 I count because the truth I know there is 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.270
 many trolls watching this video and what 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.190
 can do another curiosity guys is 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:52.810
 that the clock is not going to serve you 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:55.090
 will be spinning day and night 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:57.250
 not even at night the compass compass 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.500
 it's going to go crazy and it's not going to serve you 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.300
 ok guys and another curiosity that the 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.690
 it is true but very very succulent ok 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:03.910
 I'm going to 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:09.460
 to see to see where the bed is already 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:12.580
 I went away I do not want to lose anymore ok and good 

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:15.430
 let's see where the fucking bed is my girl 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:17.979
 then to the camera bed 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.959
 hey I already lost is that in the leader or 

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:22.690
 you lose you can not be that I have 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:25.419
 lost so I'm not good another little thing 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.889
 guys that when tubes apply to 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:28.930
 upwards you will do as 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:31.270
 happens is going to be like a world a world 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.400
 normal ok guys to see let's go towards 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.930
 upwards up ok we're going towards 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.449
 up we're going to continue up towards 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:39.789
 up up until you find 

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:41.949
 what is the mother stone that is the 

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:43.870
 stone that is at the end of everything you're going to 

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:45.910
 find a stone type like that and now 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:47.710
 you're going to break it until the end and you're going to 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:49.870
 to be able to find what is the end of 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:52.210
 neder ok guys is something that many do not 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:54.430
 they will know others and they will know and another little thing 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:56.590
 guys that I think grow up zetas 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:59.680
 but I think that only happens in what 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:02.020
 which species basically because my mother 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.550
