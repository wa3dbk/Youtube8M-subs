00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:10.099
 hello in this tutorial I'm going to show you 

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:13.039
 how to decorate our pens or our 

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:15.980
 pencils with a pineapple to give you that 

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:17.660
 Christmas touch of this time so 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.970
 good I'll show you the materials 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.730
 what are we going to need to do 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.440
 our craft will occupy a pencil 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.140
 of those who already bring Christmas motifs 

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:29.510
 preferably to make these look more 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:32.119
 are some revenues or it can be a 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:35.359
 pen previously lined with what is 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:37.940
 ribbon in the color of your preference so 

00:00:35.359 --> 00:00:39.649
 like pom-poms in the colors of his 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.620
 choice I chose this since 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:45.199
 regularly are the Christmas colors and 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:48.390
 we are also going to occupy two clean pipes 

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:51.000
 one in red and one white 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.520
 and our piñatas of these that already 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.920
 They sell well in sachets 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.780
 They are the little ones and well they come 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.400
 painted like that so it's not much 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.890
 easier to make our 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:05.010
 crafts we are also going to need 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.050
 what is glue or it can be your 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.240
 hot silicone gun to make it 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.770
 much faster in making it good 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.080
 Well, I'll show you how it is 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.810
 what is done 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.690
 The first thing we're going to do is we're going to 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:20.500
 put our two pipes together to 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.500
 can roll them 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:27.410
 we make the tips down so that 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:31.010
 We will not sting Now 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:33.740
 let's just roll up thus a 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:36.880
 with another so that they are mixed 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.880
 colors and look more 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:45.800
 and we will have stayed like this now 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.240
 the next step is let's do it 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:53.600
 now with what is the pen 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.600
 let's put a little bit of silicone 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:03.649
 and let's put here what is the tip 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:06.040
 to clean pipes and let's roll this 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:06.040
 bit 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:14.409
 let's put another little silicon 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.920
 so that we stay fixed and do not 

00:02:14.409 --> 00:02:16.920
 go to move 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:27.070
 in this way we have stayed like this now 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.930
 with the remaining pipe cleaners we are going to 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:33.090
 turn it around so that it is 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.090
 formed the base where the piñata will go 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.710
 and we will stay like this obviously is done 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.290
 down because it's not stuck but 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:51.480
 right now that we put silicone to 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.480
 paste the pineapple because it will be all together 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:00.330
 We will read so that now this 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:03.290
 last part we are going to fix it by putting a 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.290
 little bit of silicone 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:14.459
 let's accommodate the one bit by giving it 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.459
 better way 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:21.840
 and it has stayed like this now we are going to 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:24.470
 select the piñata we're going to 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.470
 place it 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:33.260
 let's use this little one and look 

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:35.980
 you regularly bring a little thread 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.980
 to take it off 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:43.230
 and bring this bit of what is the 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:47.480
 piñata and we're also going to eliminate it 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.480
 completely so that it is flat 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:55.330
 in if they break very easy and look at 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:58.800
 this way we are left like this 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:01.330
 Now let's put what is silicone 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:04.410
 we are going to put enough so that 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:04.410
 well joined the piñata 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:14.540
 we put it like that and we're going to do 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:14.540
 up and clean pipes 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.949
 look at it this way, it is now like this 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:30.130
 all firm from this part below and well 

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:32.320
 stuck with the pineapple and look at us 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:34.539
 stayed this way now so that it 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:36.759
 see so much nicer here we have 

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:40.110
 the option of putting a monkey or 

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:40.110
 hit what are the pompoms 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:46.720
 let's put silicone 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:53.480
 and let's put a point in white 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:57.160
 one green and one red 

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:57.160
 and return to do the same 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:06.300
 we turn like that and now we're going to oppress 

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:08.569
 all so that they are well glued 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:12.660
 and better trained 

00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:16.400
 It tastes like a little pompom flower 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:16.400
 remove the remains of silicone 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:23.400
 and look in this way, very easy and 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:25.770
 fast was adorned what is our 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:27.180
 pen and as I mentioned them also 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:29.670
 we can do it with what are the 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:31.500
 pencils good friends, I hope that 

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:33.660
 this simple craft has been of his 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:35.310
 I welcome you to share it if you want 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:38.330
 liked and see you in the next 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:38.330
