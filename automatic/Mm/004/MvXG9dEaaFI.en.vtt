00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:15.959 
for all gummed up inside on adventure
time<00:00:13.559> so<00:00:14.559> I'm<00:00:14.619> going<00:00:14.740> to<00:00:14.799> run<00:00:14.920> through<00:00:15.070> three

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:15.969 
time so I'm going to run through three

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:20.160 
time so I'm going to run through three
things<00:00:17.010> first<00:00:18.010> the<00:00:18.160> courts<00:00:18.490> then<00:00:19.449> Sean<00:00:19.900> Patton

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:20.170 
things first the courts then Sean Patton

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:23.340 
things first the courts then Sean Patton
and<00:00:20.650> then<00:00:20.980> I<00:00:21.010> move<00:00:21.400> together<00:00:21.780> without<00:00:22.780> vocals

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:23.350 
and then I move together without vocals

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:27.390 
and then I move together without vocals
so<00:00:23.560> you<00:00:23.650> get<00:00:23.980> an<00:00:24.039> idea<00:00:24.100> of<00:00:24.250> how<00:00:24.370> to<00:00:24.430> play<00:00:24.640> it

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:27.400 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:32.280 

so<00:00:27.910> to<00:00:28.060> start<00:00:28.300> off<00:00:28.420> we've<00:00:29.050> got<00:00:29.550> G<00:00:31.140> which<00:00:32.140> I'd

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:32.290 
so to start off we've got G which I'd

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:33.630 
so to start off we've got G which I'd
recommend<00:00:32.680> playing<00:00:32.860> with<00:00:33.100> the<00:00:33.160> third<00:00:33.370> fourth

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:33.640 
recommend playing with the third fourth

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:39.990 
recommend playing with the third fourth
and<00:00:33.790> fifth<00:00:33.880> fingers<00:00:35.220> then<00:00:36.220> g<00:00:36.670> g7<00:00:38.580> so<00:00:39.580> you'll

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:40.000 
and fifth fingers then g g7 so you'll

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.970 
and fifth fingers then g g7 so you'll
kind<00:00:40.600> of<00:00:40.660> see<00:00:40.900> saw<00:00:41.410> from<00:00:41.950> the<00:00:42.160> G<00:00:43.030> to<00:00:43.330> the<00:00:43.420> g7

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
kind of see saw from the G to the g7

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.460 
kind of see saw from the G to the g7
fifth<00:00:44.980> to<00:00:45.250> the<00:00:45.280> first<00:00:46.230> finger<00:00:47.230> on<00:00:47.260> the<00:00:47.379> first

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:47.470 
fifth to the first finger on the first

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.570 
fifth to the first finger on the first
fret<00:00:48.010> of<00:00:48.820> the<00:00:48.879> high<00:00:49.150> e<00:00:49.300> and<00:00:50.080> then<00:00:50.410> you've<00:00:50.710> got<00:00:50.920> C

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:51.580 
fret of the high e and then you've got C

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:57.390 
fret of the high e and then you've got C
minor<00:00:52.860> and<00:00:53.860> then<00:00:54.309> G<00:00:54.460> has<00:00:54.610> seven<00:00:56.129> so<00:00:57.129> that's<00:00:57.309> the

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:57.400 
minor and then G has seven so that's the

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.280 
minor and then G has seven so that's the
first<00:00:57.640> kind<00:00:58.000> of<00:00:58.150> thing<00:00:58.809> you<00:00:58.989> want<00:00:59.080> through

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:01.839 
that twice then you've got the bridging

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:03.630 
that twice then you've got the bridging
kind<00:01:02.019> of<00:01:02.080> thing<00:01:02.260> or<00:01:02.589> of<00:01:03.010> course<00:01:03.250> whatever<00:01:03.489> you
