 War

 for the block Green and what ever 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:32.170
 Zumas bring that here 

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.800
 Yes, you can have Rule Chest 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.800
 and drive enough block games and that one has here 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:43.559
 you can see percent of those already seen in the front panel Indios 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.780
 that we still came the minutes slip 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.160
 other things 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.750
 definitely around Tom 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.430
 Downloading SmartStream needed an extra pipo 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:56.600
 an extract MÃ¼ller 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.640
 we were the prices around 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:03.920
 is it the 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.670
 RB topics as he human points Chr's point of view 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.510
 not the Lehmann 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:11.880
 if it is here 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.880
 Consideration for the tables is provided by Marc Springer 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.120
 So the um 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.350
 The source briefly describes the poor man in the mid-term 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.070
 That's what she does 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.890
 So moved that the Capes paid I do not know exactly 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:28.490
 how much it costs 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.530
 but there is also a light version of it 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.830
 So then you can have three bridges installed areas is also folk 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.030
 and everything else below 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.790
 because that is easily unnecessary Venice and now is bringing us market 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.670
 to be the measure for him to Marzling grief 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.750
 a us then I have already installed the used he would have 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.750
 install and then you have to 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.359
 install media-tech punk bands dollars all around 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.899
 Environmentalists are as well then will postpone what they said 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.759
 no events when your calendar order 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:09.869
 No time in their calendars and a turnaround on the North Pole 

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:13.559
 then facebook chat can ins with Facebook 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:17.319
 iPhone Club only 1 percent as for banks without 

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:21.319
 then box is one too 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:22.500
 it was only 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.789
 Lula calendar food lunar calendar 

00:02:24.789 --> 00:02:28.069
 Jab was allowed to calculator so computer 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:30.009
 again in the calendar 

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:31.020
 that's enough 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.339
 was what can be worthwhile with a wide view 

00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:36.089
 Ca only had boxing of the show 

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:38.219
 then come yourself 

00:02:38.219 --> 00:02:41.039
 then again in the forum 

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:44.829
 closer for me is very well reported that the man has been injured 

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:49.209
 Euro and primarily sometimes even look 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:53.879
 that's the gt-r and then one of the old packs what's called the xmas 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:56.879
 Political Reform called that 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:01.129
 here and there I have the one team sent the walls staged 

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:04.129
 these points more brought Dream House rehearsals 

00:03:05.029 --> 00:03:08.029
 that he does not like Jan Wolff Wheat Kings like that 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:11.930
 Font size Tattersall can go to his factory here Ulrich 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:13.809
 Schiller Blackpool student 

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:16.669
 Enter Brad Pitt after 

00:03:16.669 --> 00:03:21.219
 the girls in x-men Origin and that because the doctors Peterek vom 

00:03:21.219 --> 00:03:22.700
 more AP that is 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.559
 iPods or iPhones 

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:29.449
 Only then is the cult considered the axles as taken 

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:30.429
 News 

00:03:30.429 --> 00:03:34.079
 no numbers with the chamber group which but then go to a lawyer 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:36.059
 he is represented 

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:39.039
 we have God and with that he was still 

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:44.489
 So better for him, depending on August, just start Maria Ho 

00:03:45.279 --> 00:03:46.799
 around 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:50.900
 Enter the weather code then you will have to knot it as well 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.499
 That's what you think about it 

00:03:52.499 --> 00:03:55.239
 now it is now possible 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:58.939
 so then she could again unanimously on the such offices 

00:03:58.939 --> 00:04:01.939
 I know for two hours what is actually quite good 

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:04.849
 and then 

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:07.849
 do you have the smarts cheaper and what will the curve 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:12.789
 s who sees the deputies is like the pages 

00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:14.369
 we are these 

00:04:14.369 --> 00:04:17.430
 Kurt points then I can make pages here 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.109
 then I can too 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:23.190
 the persistent quirk that God and right choice push for 

00:04:24.439 --> 00:04:26.990
 now it will be down again 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.090
 or if you or if you do not want to have both of them so z 

00:04:33.069 --> 00:04:36.069
 what to do Euro 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:41.490
 that can make big now we come to discouraged Minh Tuan 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:47.180
 So does a staff of acquisitions remain under pressure 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:50.180
 Fini poverty Glocks likes, among other things 

00:04:51.249 --> 00:04:54.620
 PAP there could be no Seikel in the end only one shot 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:57.430
 instead of just knocking 2 on 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:00.430
 something has shown that turn on the first time 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:05.509
 However, years ago, however, it seems to have stopped ablaze Logsch that the 

00:05:05.509 --> 00:05:06.699
 BAG 

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:09.520
 about one and a half percent of those really interested 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:13.760
 On the truth, unfortunately, one is not very logical usually it is 

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:15.599
 then here always this style unfortunately 

00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:17.789
 yes not done away 

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:21.719
 some states would use the app the first time around after I use the app 

00:05:21.719 --> 00:05:23.710
 with it way but around 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:26.720
 Picture because I have to learn a lot to do so otherwise you have 

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.849
 no chance anymore that somehow 

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:32.219
 we are like that one can take except with percent falls just to go 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:35.539
 thanks to their own theme block 

00:05:35.539 --> 00:05:36.780
 that it will be different 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:39.819
 I've never seen any but only up there 

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:43.879
 in the city is Bahr 

00:05:43.879 --> 00:05:46.759
 and what the bullet hit the backup 

00:05:46.759 --> 00:05:50.229
 that still so on nudity definitions mm 

00:05:50.779 --> 00:05:54.039
 Possibilities to listen 

00:05:54.039 --> 00:05:58.300
 in the evening meet and also because he yes what actually that would be you 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:00.610
 mentioned 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:03.610
 then shops can strive 

00:06:04.189 --> 00:06:07.189
 by simply 

00:06:08.999 --> 00:06:11.240
 so on b 

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:12.430
 that's how it is 

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:15.110
 Klamauk Schools is actually the cult too 

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:18.110
 almost like a book page so Roberts pull 

00:06:19.029 --> 00:06:19.850
 so 

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:21.699
 his team track 

00:06:21.699 --> 00:06:25.730
 then enough blocks Manuela have or cattle other which the plant more 

00:06:25.729 --> 00:06:26.820
 crack it 

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:30.169
 Standard time-out for example now 

00:06:30.169 --> 00:06:33.169
 then I can write that everywhere now 

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:37.139
 the Briton 

00:06:37.139 --> 00:06:39.069
 "No matter what, I come out 

00:06:39.069 --> 00:06:41.070
 but have no girl 

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:43.779
 only five earthTV are not enough anymore 

00:06:43.779 --> 00:06:48.029
 then it remains different and how far she wants to be with the 

00:06:48.029 --> 00:06:50.159
 market 

00:06:50.159 --> 00:06:53.499
 that was all I could say and double partner Steffen 

00:06:53.499 --> 00:06:55.169
 see you next time
