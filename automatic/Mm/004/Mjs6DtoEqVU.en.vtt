better<00:02:16.040> this<00:02:16.220> next<00:02:16.280> time<00:02:16.700> I<00:02:16.880> promise<00:02:18.580> but<00:02:19.580> it

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
better this next time I promise but it

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.160 
better this next time I promise but it
looks<00:02:19.880> like<00:02:19.970> there's<00:02:20.360> the<00:02:20.570> pack<00:02:20.780> a<00:02:20.810> punch

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
looks like there's the pack a punch

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:26.170 
looks like there's the pack a punch
their<00:02:21.440> right<00:02:21.680> as<00:02:21.830> you<00:02:22.010> spawn<00:02:22.430> and<00:02:25.090> so<00:02:26.090> I'm

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
their right as you spawn and so I'm

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.630 
their right as you spawn and so I'm
assuming<00:02:26.300> you<00:02:26.780> go<00:02:27.080> to<00:02:27.140> the<00:02:27.530> moon<00:02:27.830> map<00:02:28.160> and<00:02:28.460> then

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
assuming you go to the moon map and then

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.910 
assuming you go to the moon map and then
you<00:02:28.730> have<00:02:28.820> to<00:02:28.910> come<00:02:29.120> back<00:02:29.150> somehow<00:02:29.830> but<00:02:30.830> I'm

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
you have to come back somehow but I'm

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.199 
you have to come back somehow but I'm
not<00:02:30.950> going<00:02:31.220> to<00:02:31.280> have<00:02:31.400> a<00:02:31.460> clue<00:02:31.640> how<00:02:31.760> to<00:02:31.790> do<00:02:32.030> that

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
not going to have a clue how to do that

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:33.730 
not going to have a clue how to do that
so<00:02:32.510> it<00:02:32.600> doesn't<00:02:32.840> look<00:02:32.900> like<00:02:32.959> i'll<00:02:33.290> get<00:02:33.470> a<00:02:33.500> pack

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:33.740 
so it doesn't look like i'll get a pack

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.350 
so it doesn't look like i'll get a pack
a<00:02:33.770> punch<00:02:34.100> to<00:02:34.160> gun<00:02:34.430> this<00:02:34.610> first<00:02:34.850> playthrough
