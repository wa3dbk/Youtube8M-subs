00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.070
 youtube are charlie and welcome to 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.009
 this new video as you can see 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.350
 this will not be the usual gameplay and not 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.179
 me usually what it is nsg 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.129
 not just gameplay an address book 

00:00:36.179 --> 00:00:41.129
 particular time to bring some 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:44.699
 freshness on the canal or at least I hope 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:46.350
 I will talk about video games and movie books 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:48.600
 anything else related to culture 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:53.370
 nerd but not only can I also talk about 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:55.530
 special events or my life as well as the 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.739
 my life may be of interest to anyone from 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.389
 you, however, the arguments will be 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.940
 especially suggested by you enough 

00:01:00.389 --> 00:01:05.280
 write here in the comments nsg what ne 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.619
 you think of is the topic you want that 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.140
 talk if my speeches are not clear 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.180
 they will be scientific technicians or all 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.729
 those things there because I'll talk about what 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.469
 I think arguing my ideas though 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.329
 then asking for your opinion why 

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:20.340
 the sense of this format is really 

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:21.719
 to exchange ideas for non 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.530
 let him weigh too much detachment from 

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:24.210
 gameplay people 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.619
 I decided to bring it first 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.820
 topic just a video game that 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.369
 the one most treated on my channel 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.439
 minecraft minecraft is a video game of 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.270
 sandbox type designed by markus persson 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.880
 wedding is published for the first time 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:45.479
 in May 2009 then when I had 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:49.130
 about 12 years I believe but what exactly 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:52.409
 a simple sandbox in sand box no 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.850
 started the ok I go away just a sandbox 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.039
 is a type of game that has no limits 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.950
 to the player but he knows that he is 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:59.909
 itself to create goals 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.710
 providing him with tools for the 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.259
 survival and leaving them open 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.759
 world or an open space 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.560
 where player can do whatever he wants 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.490
 without having to follow a plot 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.890
 main game 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:11.880
 other examples of sandboxes besides minecraft 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.650
 were they like 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.270
 for example terraria ann turner the 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.950
 think a little, even gta is coming 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.090
 considered as a sandbox for why 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.180
 within this game the player 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:25.110
 he can steal what he wants to go where he wants 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:27.630
 even fucking those who want to say 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.470
 played gta I found a whore and 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.470
 then killed 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.230
 minecraft plot my favorite thing 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.790
 of the game is just the feeling of 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.380
 freedom that gives you when you play it 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.670
 because it's the gameplay it's pretty much 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.010
 infinite you can do whatever you want 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.570
 go wherever you want and above all then 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.400
 unleash your creativity by building e 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:47.130
 designing what you prefer e 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:52.770
 maybe you can say first found the 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:54.390
 graphics sucks yes and no graphics 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:57.140
 minecraft imitated several times in 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.350
 his later titles is deliberately 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.850
 poor 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.070
 nowadays games can 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:04.770
 to get to cost even 70 euros maybe 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:08.970
 for their absurd graphics over hbv in 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:09.630
 more and maybe the gameplay is boring or 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.730
 too short 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:14.250
 by this I do not mean that all the 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.560
 games that cost so much have a 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.330
 shit gameplay is clear there are 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.130
 games that are worth their price e 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.600
 maybe even more 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.030
 but in those cases another may arise 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.250
 problem you have a PC powerful enough to 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.650
 hold it minecraft with only 20 euros 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.600
 brings practically infinite gameplay 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.000
 with a rather particular graphic that 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.560
 even a 4 gigabyte pc unit is one 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.100
 cock graphics card succeeds at 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:40.910
 I hold and I say from experience I don't know 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:44.340
 not even if this case still turns on 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:47.810
 now you can get them to say yes, but after 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.810
 a little minecraft scott 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:53.970
 you are sure even if you are 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.980
 shattered chestnuts work in caverns 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:58.440
 as a Chilean miner on the internet is 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:00.900
 can be found in infinite fashions and 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:03.840
 of maps that transform minecraft into a 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:06.780
 horror game and I know something about it in a 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.400
 rpg in a fps and so on and so forth 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.930
 so why if this game is like that 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.850
 varies so well structured and taken in 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.560
 around a good part of the circle 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:15.630
 for me the reasons are mainly two 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:18.390
 the first reason that makes it so immediate future 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:20.400
 and its popularity as it happened 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:22.200
 among the people also three video games there 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.540
 they are the most popular ones that come 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.820
 hated and loved at the same time often 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:28.980
 the game is criticized by someone from 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.090
 the trend is rather influential 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:33.060
 human 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:35.610
 many people follow the mass 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:37.350
 begin to hate the game maybe without 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.820
 never having opened it just because he has it 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.590
 said this given person 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:42.000
 the second reason why second 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:43.950
 me this game is singing diato is 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.320
 closely related to the first being 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:48.180
 Extremely popular minecraft easy 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:51.480
 to use with no gameplay at all 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:53.490
 complicated and let's face it also easy to 

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:55.440
 cracking is one of the most popular games 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:57.780
 treated here on youtube especially by 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.310
 neo youtubers now the pipe is full of 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.470
 channels dedicated solely to this 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:03.330
 videogame and the thing is not negative in 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:06.210
 itself but it becomes when these videos 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:08.670
 they are made by children without videos 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:10.350
 a minimum of quality, perhaps elegant or 

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:12.030
 completely copied from a youtuber 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:14.460
 the bigger, of course, I don't mean 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:16.110
 to the channels just opened because myself 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:18.480
 at the beginning I didn't know what he meant 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:20.370
 avoid or what quality meant but 

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:22.680
 over time I have learned to increase the 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:26.130
 quality of the videos and at least to sell them 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:28.830
 watchable I think I'm talking about two 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:31.410
 channels and rich in unoriginal videos 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:33.450
 poor quality that the go ahead 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:35.070
 the more things get worse than they manage to 

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:38.400
 remain standing only thanks to 

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:40.200
 then famous and hated parts replacement 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:42.180
 as you can see we cannot blame anyone 

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:43.890
 criticize this game that even 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:46.530
 criticizes the youtubers who treat it 

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:48.510
 because it was so miss treaty is 

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:49.890
 worn that probably also the 

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:51.840
 lady also 18 us broke i 

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:53.400
 balls to hear about it 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.780
 in fact I should learn to lower 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:56.190
 the item when I register otherwise 

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:57.960
 inside of these I find myself with the 

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:59.720
 broom in conclusion we can say ha 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:01.620
 so that minecraft is a varied game 

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:03.210
 nice customizable both from 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:05.220
 play that to look at indeed 

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:07.560
 despite being so teased 

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:08.010
 and one of the most followed video games up here 

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:10.440
 youtube 

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:13.860
 in fact if I play another game, it's not me 

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:15.600
 no one in poverty and you what 

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:17.220
 do you think you agree with that 

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:19.530
 what I say or for all the video you have 

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:21.360
 held an expression of the kind what is going on 

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:22.760
 saying this is sick what is smoked 

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:25.140
 please let it shut up 

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:26.580
 write it with a comment below is 

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:28.470

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:30.180
 will be shown in the next episode of 

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:31.680
