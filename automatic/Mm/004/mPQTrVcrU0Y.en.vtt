taupe<00:01:45.840> I<00:01:46.290> have<00:01:46.770> this<00:01:46.920> pair<00:01:47.220> of<00:01:47.520> taupe<00:01:47.910> earrings

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:48.510 
taupe I have this pair of taupe earrings

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:50.330 
taupe I have this pair of taupe earrings
I<00:01:48.810> just<00:01:49.080> think<00:01:49.470> that<00:01:49.590> taupe<00:01:49.860> is<00:01:50.040> a<00:01:50.070> very

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
I just think that taupe is a very

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.580 
I just think that taupe is a very
difficult<00:01:51.150> color<00:01:51.360> to<00:01:51.510> try<00:01:52.170> and<00:01:52.320> explain

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
difficult color to try and explain

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.770 
difficult color to try and explain
because<00:01:52.920> it's<00:01:53.040> kind<00:01:53.850> of<00:01:53.910> like<00:01:54.120> grey<00:01:54.390> with<00:01:54.660> them

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
because it's kind of like grey with them

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.630 
because it's kind of like grey with them
it's<00:01:54.900> kind<00:01:55.140> of<00:01:55.170> like<00:01:55.290> brown<00:01:55.530> like<00:01:56.130> beige<00:01:56.340> as

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
it's kind of like brown like beige as

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.940 
it's kind of like brown like beige as
well<00:01:56.790> so<00:01:57.420> it's<00:01:57.600> one<00:01:58.140> of<00:01:58.170> those<00:01:58.320> in-between

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
well so it's one of those in-between

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.040 
well so it's one of those in-between
