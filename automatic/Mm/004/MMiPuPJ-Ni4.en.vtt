tip of the week you know when it comes
to<00:00:05.910> decoys<00:00:06.299> it<00:00:06.509> really<00:00:06.779> is<00:00:06.899> a<00:00:06.930> difference

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
to decoys it really is a difference

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:08.509 
to decoys it really is a difference
we've<00:00:07.529> tried<00:00:07.740> all<00:00:07.770> different<00:00:08.040> types<00:00:08.340> of

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
we've tried all different types of

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.600 
we've tried all different types of
decoys<00:00:08.880> and<00:00:09.590> met<00:00:10.590> up<00:00:10.620> with<00:00:10.950> these<00:00:11.070> folks<00:00:11.400> from

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
decoys and met up with these folks from

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.039 
decoys and met up with these folks from
doubleheader<00:00:12.090> decoy<00:00:12.450> last<00:00:12.719> year<00:00:12.900> and<00:00:12.990> we

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
doubleheader decoy last year and we

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:14.180 
doubleheader decoy last year and we
start<00:00:13.320> trying<00:00:13.500> them<00:00:13.710> they<00:00:13.889> come<00:00:14.040> out<00:00:14.160> with

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
start trying them they come out with

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.709 
start trying them they come out with
this<00:00:14.400> new<00:00:14.580> and<00:00:14.820> this<00:00:14.940> year<00:00:15.150> they're<00:00:15.420> calling

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
this new and this year they're calling

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.540 
this new and this year they're calling
Houdini<00:00:16.109> because<00:00:16.529> it<00:00:16.650> works<00:00:16.800> like<00:00:17.010> magic<00:00:17.039> and

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
Houdini because it works like magic and

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:18.890 
Houdini because it works like magic and
I<00:00:17.609> think<00:00:17.789> you<00:00:17.880> can<00:00:18.000> tell<00:00:18.180> from<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:18.420> footage<00:00:18.750> it

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
I think you can tell from the footage it

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.230 
I think you can tell from the footage it
so<00:00:19.080> far<00:00:19.289> this<00:00:19.560> year<00:00:19.619> it's<00:00:20.460> been<00:00:20.640> incredible

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
so far this year it's been incredible

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.450 
so far this year it's been incredible
double-header<00:00:22.140> decoy<00:00:22.500> obviously<00:00:23.100> lives<00:00:23.310> up

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
double-header decoy obviously lives up

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.130 
double-header decoy obviously lives up
to<00:00:23.490> its<00:00:23.699> name<00:00:23.760> this<00:00:24.090> one<00:00:24.150> comes<00:00:24.630> with<00:00:24.779> two

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
to its name this one comes with two

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.019 
to its name this one comes with two
different<00:00:25.320> heads<00:00:25.619> we<00:00:25.949> prefer<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.369> red<00:00:26.730> head

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
different heads we prefer the red head

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.580 
different heads we prefer the red head
because<00:00:27.390> it's<00:00:27.539> more<00:00:27.689> of<00:00:27.810> a<00:00:27.869> subordinate<00:00:28.380> head

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
because it's more of a subordinate head

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.870 
because it's more of a subordinate head
they<00:00:29.429> also<00:00:29.580> come<00:00:29.910> with<00:00:29.939> a<00:00:30.060> white<00:00:30.330> head<00:00:31.880> this

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
they also come with a white head this

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.180 
they also come with a white head this
gobbler<00:00:33.450> has<00:00:33.719> just<00:00:33.989> been<00:00:34.200> he's<00:00:34.800> been<00:00:34.920> beat<00:00:35.160> up

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
gobbler has just been he's been beat up

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.340 
gobbler has just been he's been beat up
so<00:00:35.489> far<00:00:35.730> in<00:00:35.880> fact<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.630> way<00:00:36.780> it<00:00:36.899> works<00:00:37.140> you

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
so far in fact the way it works you

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.750 
so far in fact the way it works you
stick<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:37.860> stake<00:00:38.070> of<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.250> ground<00:00:38.489> and<00:00:38.610> set

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
stick the stake of the ground and set

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.670 
stick the stake of the ground and set
him<00:00:38.879> on<00:00:39.000> it<00:00:39.210> but<00:00:39.719> I<00:00:39.930> can't<00:00:40.260> really<00:00:40.379> show<00:00:40.620> you

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
him on it but I can't really show you

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.170 
him on it but I can't really show you
the<00:00:40.829> way<00:00:40.920> it<00:00:41.100> works<00:00:41.550> real<00:00:41.790> well<00:00:41.820> right<00:00:42.000> now

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
the way it works real well right now

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.600 
the way it works real well right now
because<00:00:42.690> this<00:00:42.719> gobbler<00:00:43.290> broke<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.340> stake<00:00:44.579> in

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
because this gobbler broke the stake in

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.160 
because this gobbler broke the stake in
half<00:00:44.910> when<00:00:45.059> he<00:00:45.120> jumped<00:00:45.480> up<00:00:45.539> here<00:00:45.719> on<00:00:45.870> him<00:00:46.020> and

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
half when he jumped up here on him and

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.290 
half when he jumped up here on him and
tore<00:00:46.350> him<00:00:46.500> off<00:00:46.620> of<00:00:46.649> it<00:00:47.010> but<00:00:47.250> that's<00:00:47.640> okay<00:00:48.030> well

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
tore him off of it but that's okay well

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.810 
tore him off of it but that's okay well
won't<00:00:48.570> get<00:00:48.690> another<00:00:48.899> stake<00:00:49.260> for<00:00:49.500> him<00:00:49.649> but<00:00:49.820> if

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
won't get another stake for him but if

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.590 
won't get another stake for him but if
you're<00:00:51.030> looking<00:00:51.059> for<00:00:52.820> maybe<00:00:53.820> an<00:00:54.059> extra<00:00:54.449> edge

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
you're looking for maybe an extra edge

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.600 
you're looking for maybe an extra edge
when<00:00:54.989> your<00:00:55.140> bow<00:00:55.710> hunting<00:00:55.949> these<00:00:56.070> birds<00:00:56.340> or

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
when your bow hunting these birds or

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.450 
when your bow hunting these birds or
even<00:00:56.850> shotgun<00:00:57.210> hunting<00:00:57.420> them<00:00:57.570> a<00:00:58.070> real<00:00:59.070> decoy

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
even shotgun hunting them a real decoy

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.910 
even shotgun hunting them a real decoy
really<00:00:59.940> really<00:01:00.870> works<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.320> nice<00:01:01.500> thing<00:01:01.739> about

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
really really works the nice thing about

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.929 
really really works the nice thing about
this<00:01:02.579> decoy<00:01:02.969> to<00:01:03.210> is<00:01:03.449> that<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.979> tail<00:01:05.220> comes<00:01:05.729> off

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
this decoy to is that the tail comes off

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.420 
this decoy to is that the tail comes off
