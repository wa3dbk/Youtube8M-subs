00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:57.570 
can see mine is completely destroyed
when<00:01:55.510> the<00:01:55.540> power<00:01:55.870> washer<00:01:56.080> hit<00:01:56.830> the<00:01:57.040> appendages

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:57.580 
when the power washer hit the appendages

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.120 
when the power washer hit the appendages
that<00:01:57.640> are<00:01:58.060> on<00:01:58.300> the<00:01:58.600> paddle<00:01:59.200> wheel<00:01:59.350> it<00:01:59.860> just

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
that are on the paddle wheel it just

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.370 
that are on the paddle wheel it just
blew<00:02:00.400> them<00:02:00.610> off<00:02:00.820> completely<00:02:01.120> so<00:02:01.960> basically

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
blew them off completely so basically

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:03.660 
blew them off completely so basically
what<00:02:02.560> we<00:02:02.650> need<00:02:02.770> to<00:02:02.860> do<00:02:02.980> is<00:02:03.160> remove<00:02:03.490> this

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
what we need to do is remove this

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.320 
what we need to do is remove this
housing<00:02:04.180> to<00:02:04.330> get<00:02:04.450> access<00:02:04.930> to<00:02:05.760> the<00:02:06.760> cotter<00:02:07.000> pin

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330 
housing to get access to the cotter pin

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.650 
housing to get access to the cotter pin
and<00:02:08.369> replace<00:02:09.369> the<00:02:09.550> wheel<00:02:09.700> in<00:02:10.239> order<00:02:10.450> to<00:02:10.539> take

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
and replace the wheel in order to take

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.120 
and replace the wheel in order to take
the<00:02:10.780> housing<00:02:11.110> off<00:02:11.230> we've<00:02:11.500> got<00:02:11.530> to<00:02:11.800> remove

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
the housing off we've got to remove

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.030 
the housing off we've got to remove
three<00:02:12.910> screws<00:02:13.000> one<00:02:13.660> two<00:02:13.960> three

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
three screws one two three

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.980 
three screws one two three
they're<00:02:15.400> located<00:02:15.790> in<00:02:15.820> these<00:02:15.940> holes<00:02:16.180> once<00:02:16.870> we

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
they're located in these holes once we

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.580 
they're located in these holes once we
get<00:02:17.080> that<00:02:17.230> off

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
get that off

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:18.990 
get that off
we'll<00:02:17.680> get<00:02:17.800> access<00:02:18.280> to<00:02:18.310> the<00:02:18.519> speed<00:02:18.760> sensor

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
we'll get access to the speed sensor

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:35.190 
we'll get access to the speed sensor
itself<00:02:32.550> now<00:02:33.550> that's<00:02:33.879> still<00:02:34.150> on<00:02:34.330> there<00:02:34.540> pretty

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
itself now that's still on there pretty

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.380 
itself now that's still on there pretty
tight<00:02:35.319> I<00:02:35.739> can't<00:02:36.099> really<00:02:36.250> budge<00:02:36.519> that<00:02:36.790> the

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
tight I can't really budge that the

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.059 
tight I can't really budge that the
reason<00:02:37.690> for<00:02:37.810> that<00:02:37.870> is<00:02:38.170> that<00:02:38.319> there's<00:02:38.530> some

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069 
reason for that is that there's some

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:41.550 
reason for that is that there's some
silicone<00:02:39.660> behind<00:02:40.660> this<00:02:40.870> housing<00:02:41.290> which<00:02:41.440> is

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
silicone behind this housing which is

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:42.990 
silicone behind this housing which is
protecting<00:02:41.980> water<00:02:42.250> from<00:02:42.459> going<00:02:42.549> inside<00:02:42.849> the

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
protecting water from going inside the

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.690 
protecting water from going inside the
boat<00:02:43.150> so<00:02:43.840> I'm<00:02:44.620> thinking<00:02:45.160> the<00:02:45.280> easiest<00:02:45.489> way<00:02:45.640> to

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
boat so I'm thinking the easiest way to

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.330 
boat so I'm thinking the easiest way to
get<00:02:45.849> this<00:02:46.000> off<00:02:46.239> is<00:02:46.510> with<00:02:46.660> a<00:02:46.690> gentle<00:02:47.080> pry<00:02:47.290> with<00:02:48.040> a

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
get this off is with a gentle pry with a

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.270 
get this off is with a gentle pry with a
flathead<00:02:49.150> screwdriver<00:02:49.950> when<00:02:50.950> you're<00:02:51.069> doing

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
flathead screwdriver when you're doing

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.740 
flathead screwdriver when you're doing
this<00:02:51.370> be<00:02:51.579> really<00:02:51.730> careful<00:02:52.209> not<00:02:52.360> to<00:02:52.569> scratch

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
this be really careful not to scratch

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.370 
this be really careful not to scratch
your<00:02:53.049> gel<00:02:53.319> coat<00:02:54.630> you<00:02:55.630> can<00:02:55.810> really<00:02:55.989> mess<00:02:56.140> it<00:02:56.319> up

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
your gel coat you can really mess it up

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:10.650 
your gel coat you can really mess it up
anyway<00:02:57.160> here<00:02:57.310> we<00:02:57.370> go<00:03:07.739> there<00:03:08.739> we<00:03:08.799> go<00:03:08.950> and<00:03:09.660> that

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
anyway here we go there we go and that

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.819 
anyway here we go there we go and that
just<00:03:10.900> pops<00:03:11.049> off<00:03:11.610> okay<00:03:12.610> so<00:03:12.670> here<00:03:13.450> we<00:03:13.480> have<00:03:13.829> the

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:14.829 
just pops off okay so here we have the

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:17.759 
just pops off okay so here we have the
speed<00:03:15.099> sensor<00:03:15.310> itself<00:03:15.760> and<00:03:16.349> this<00:03:17.349> is<00:03:17.530> where

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:17.769 
speed sensor itself and this is where

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:20.009 
speed sensor itself and this is where
the<00:03:18.730> wheel<00:03:18.910> the<00:03:19.239> paddle<00:03:19.510> wheel<00:03:19.569> needs<00:03:19.780> to<00:03:19.870> be

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:20.019 
the wheel the paddle wheel needs to be

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:22.319 
the wheel the paddle wheel needs to be
replaced<00:03:20.290> there's<00:03:20.890> a<00:03:20.980> small<00:03:21.280> pin<00:03:21.639> holding

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:22.329 
replaced there's a small pin holding

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:25.500 
replaced there's a small pin holding
this<00:03:23.079> wheel<00:03:23.319> in<00:03:23.470> place<00:03:23.500> right<00:03:23.859> now<00:03:23.980> so<00:03:24.510> the

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
this wheel in place right now so the

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.300 
this wheel in place right now so the
best<00:03:25.660> way<00:03:25.840> to<00:03:25.930> get<00:03:26.079> that<00:03:26.290> out<00:03:26.350> I'm<00:03:27.100> going<00:03:27.160> to

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
best way to get that out I'm going to

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.629 
best way to get that out I'm going to
move<00:03:27.489> the<00:03:27.639> camera<00:03:27.819> up<00:03:28.060> a<00:03:28.150> bit<00:03:28.299> I<00:03:29.430> don't<00:03:30.430> know<00:03:30.549> if

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:30.639 
move the camera up a bit I don't know if

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:33.379 
move the camera up a bit I don't know if
you<00:03:30.730> can<00:03:30.850> see<00:03:31.090> that<00:03:31.269> there<00:03:31.540> there<00:03:32.200> is<00:03:32.230> a<00:03:32.380> small

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:33.389 
you can see that there there is a small

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:36.870 
you can see that there there is a small
pin<00:03:34.389> located<00:03:35.200> right<00:03:36.160> here<00:03:36.220> that<00:03:36.609> we<00:03:36.670> have<00:03:36.760> to

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
pin located right here that we have to

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.640 
pin located right here that we have to
push<00:03:37.060> out<00:03:37.269> so<00:03:37.989> I'm<00:03:38.079> just<00:03:38.170> going<00:03:38.319> to<00:03:38.349> use<00:03:38.500> the

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
push out so I'm just going to use the

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.309 
push out so I'm just going to use the
corner<00:03:38.950> of<00:03:39.160> the<00:03:39.480> flat-head<00:03:40.480> screwdriver

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:43.800 
corner of the flat-head screwdriver
and<00:03:42.069> see<00:03:42.639> if<00:03:42.700> we<00:03:42.819> can<00:03:42.970> persuade<00:03:43.450> it<00:03:43.599> to<00:03:43.690> come

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
and see if we can persuade it to come

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:50.809 
and see if we can persuade it to come
out<00:03:45.329> there<00:03:46.329> we<00:03:46.419> go

00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:50.819 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:54.089

long no needlenose pliers grab the other

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:58.289 
long no needlenose pliers grab the other
side<00:03:54.419> and<00:03:55.500> there<00:03:56.500> we<00:03:56.590> go<00:03:56.880> okay<00:03:57.880> so<00:03:57.940> I<00:03:58.060> have<00:03:58.180> the

00:03:58.289 --> 00:03:58.299 
side and there we go okay so I have the

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:00.360 
side and there we go okay so I have the
new<00:03:58.450> paddle<00:03:58.750> wheel<00:03:58.930> here<00:03:59.169> and<00:03:59.290> the<00:03:59.680> new<00:04:00.130> pin

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
new paddle wheel here and the new pin

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.400 
new paddle wheel here and the new pin
that<00:04:00.549> came<00:04:00.700> with<00:04:00.849> it<00:04:00.989> you<00:04:01.989> need<00:04:02.139> to<00:04:02.230> make<00:04:02.380> sure

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:02.410 
that came with it you need to make sure

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:04.500 
that came with it you need to make sure
that<00:04:02.859> when<00:04:03.010> you're<00:04:03.160> installing<00:04:03.370> this<00:04:03.790> the

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
that when you're installing this the

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:09.030 
that when you're installing this the
flat<00:04:04.810> portions<00:04:05.700> face<00:04:07.470> towards<00:04:08.470> the<00:04:08.680> front<00:04:09.010> of

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
flat portions face towards the front of

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.920 
flat portions face towards the front of
the<00:04:09.099> boat<00:04:09.280> at<00:04:09.430> the<00:04:09.489> bottom<00:04:09.790> and<00:04:09.940> the<00:04:10.660> reason

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
the boat at the bottom and the reason

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:12.120 
the boat at the bottom and the reason
for<00:04:10.959> this<00:04:11.169> is<00:04:11.230> because<00:04:11.410> there's<00:04:11.739> water<00:04:12.010> that

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.130 
for this is because there's water that

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:14.550 
for this is because there's water that
comes<00:04:12.459> through<00:04:12.730> this<00:04:12.880> channel<00:04:13.380> hits<00:04:14.380> the

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 
comes through this channel hits the

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.330 
comes through this channel hits the
paddle<00:04:14.859> wheel<00:04:14.980> makes<00:04:15.880> it<00:04:16.030> spin<00:04:16.329> and<00:04:16.599> that's

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
paddle wheel makes it spin and that's

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.310 
paddle wheel makes it spin and that's
what<00:04:18.340> the<00:04:18.459> sensor<00:04:18.760> picks<00:04:18.940> up<00:04:19.180> as<00:04:19.329> the<00:04:20.049> wheel<00:04:20.169> is

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
what the sensor picks up as the wheel is

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.219 
what the sensor picks up as the wheel is
spinning<00:04:20.349> if<00:04:20.829> you<00:04:20.950> install<00:04:21.519> it<00:04:21.609> the<00:04:21.700> wrong<00:04:21.849> way

00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:23.229 
spinning if you install it the wrong way

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:25.649 
spinning if you install it the wrong way
it's<00:04:23.620> not<00:04:23.830> that<00:04:23.979> it's<00:04:24.099> been<00:04:24.220> properly<00:04:24.700> so

00:04:25.649 --> 00:04:25.659 
it's not that it's been properly so

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:30.000 
it's not that it's been properly so
