this before me but or used it in this
way<00:00:18.660> before<00:00:18.990> me<00:00:19.080> but<00:00:19.170> I've<00:00:19.289> never<00:00:19.500> heard<00:00:19.680> about

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
way before me but I've never heard about

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.439 
way before me but I've never heard about
it<00:00:20.039> so<00:00:20.160> I<00:00:20.189> was<00:00:20.310> kind<00:00:20.550> of<00:00:20.609> excited<00:00:21.000> with<00:00:21.119> it<00:00:21.150> want

that I think if you know about this that

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.120 
that I think if you know about this that
you<00:00:26.250> can<00:00:26.460> get<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:26.820> dog<00:00:27.000> your<00:00:27.539> dog<00:00:27.779> to<00:00:28.109> be<00:00:28.260> much

you can get the dog your dog to be much
more<00:00:29.429> obedient<00:00:29.760> in<00:00:30.119> specific<00:00:30.779> situations<00:00:31.590> and

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859

I<00:00:31.980> want<00:00:32.279> to<00:00:32.399> share<00:00:32.579> this<00:00:32.790> with<00:00:33.000> you<00:00:33.180> so<00:00:33.660> the

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
I want to share this with you so the

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.110 
I want to share this with you so the
method<00:00:34.469> that<00:00:34.590> I'm<00:00:34.770> calling<00:00:35.190> well<00:00:35.640> that<00:00:35.969> it's

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
method that I'm calling well that it's

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.380 
method that I'm calling well that it's
called<00:00:36.390> this<00:00:36.690> is<00:00:36.750> a<00:00:37.320> default<00:00:38.160> behavior<00:00:38.850> so

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
called this is a default behavior so

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.060 
called this is a default behavior so
there's<00:00:39.570> this<00:00:39.719> phenomenon<00:00:40.410> that<00:00:40.739> I've<00:00:40.890> known

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
there's this phenomenon that I've known

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.380 
there's this phenomenon that I've known
about<00:00:41.280> lots<00:00:41.550> of<00:00:41.670> trainers<00:00:41.969> have<00:00:42.059> known<00:00:42.270> about

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
about lots of trainers have known about

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.090 
about lots of trainers have known about
I've<00:00:42.660> just<00:00:42.809> never<00:00:42.960> intentionally<00:00:43.680> used<00:00:43.890> it

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
I've just never intentionally used it

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.060 
I've just never intentionally used it
correctly<00:00:44.309> before<00:00:44.820> that<00:00:45.690> in<00:00:46.649> fact<00:00:46.890> it's

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
correctly before that in fact it's

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.310 
correctly before that in fact it's
normally<00:00:47.550> a<00:00:47.579> problem<00:00:48.120> with<00:00:48.870> dealing<00:00:49.140> with

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
normally a problem with dealing with

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.260 
normally a problem with dealing with
animals<00:00:49.829> and<00:00:49.920> I<00:00:49.980> try<00:00:50.219> to<00:00:50.280> work<00:00:50.820> around<00:00:51.000> how<00:00:51.210> to

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
animals and I try to work around how to

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.319 
animals and I try to work around how to
fix<00:00:51.600> it<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:52.020> I<00:00:52.530> don't<00:00:52.590> ever<00:00:52.920> use<00:00:53.190> it<00:00:53.370> for<00:00:53.730> what

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
fix it and I don't ever use it for what

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.360 
fix it and I don't ever use it for what
I<00:00:54.600> think<00:00:55.110> it<00:00:55.230> could<00:00:55.379> be<00:00:55.500> used<00:00:55.710> for<00:00:55.800> so<00:00:56.160> this<00:00:56.340> is

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
I think it could be used for so this is

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.400 
I think it could be used for so this is
called<00:00:56.640> a<00:00:56.730> default<00:00:56.940> behavior<00:00:57.660> I<00:00:57.870> first

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
called a default behavior I first

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.810 
called a default behavior I first
noticed<00:00:58.770> this<00:00:58.829> in<00:00:59.010> my<00:00:59.129> bird<00:00:59.370> training

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
noticed this in my bird training

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.490 
noticed this in my bird training
background<00:01:00.059> where<00:01:00.570> we<00:01:00.690> would<00:01:00.840> teach<00:01:01.050> birds<00:01:01.350> to

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
background where we would teach birds to

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.429 
background where we would teach birds to
do<00:01:01.620> things<00:01:01.890> so<00:01:02.390> we<00:01:03.390> would<00:01:03.539> always<00:01:03.780> teach<00:01:04.229> the

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
do things so we would always teach the

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:05.780 
do things so we would always teach the
birds<00:01:04.650> to<00:01:04.890> wait<00:01:05.040> they'd<00:01:05.280> pick<00:01:05.430> up<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.640> little

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
birds to wait they'd pick up the little

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.420 
birds to wait they'd pick up the little
foot<00:01:06.030> and<00:01:06.180> they<00:01:06.240> wave<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:06.770> and<00:01:07.770> then<00:01:08.130> we<00:01:08.220> teach

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
foot and they wave and and then we teach

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:09.980 
foot and they wave and and then we teach
them<00:01:08.580> some<00:01:08.820> other<00:01:08.880> things<00:01:09.150> what<00:01:09.360> we<00:01:09.479> realize

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
them some other things what we realize

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.440 
them some other things what we realize
is<00:01:10.020> that<00:01:10.409> we<00:01:11.400> would<00:01:11.580> we<00:01:11.880> would<00:01:12.030> notice<00:01:12.420> that

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
is that we would we would notice that

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.210 
is that we would we would notice that
when<00:01:12.720> we<00:01:12.840> were<00:01:12.990> you<00:01:13.350> know<00:01:13.439> I<00:01:13.500> don't<00:01:13.650> know<00:01:13.710> 10<00:01:14.070> or

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
when we were you know I don't know 10 or

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:35.960 
bird hadn't learned yet we wouldn't
notice<00:01:34.890> that<00:01:35.189> when<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.400> bird<00:01:35.520> was<00:01:35.670> like<00:01:35.790> I

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
notice that when the bird was like I

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.160 
notice that when the bird was like I
don't<00:01:36.030> know<00:01:36.210> what<00:01:36.299> else<00:01:36.420> opposed<00:01:36.600> to<00:01:36.720> it<00:01:36.960> would

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
don't know what else opposed to it would

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.499 
don't know what else opposed to it would
default<00:01:37.740> to<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.430> wave<00:01:38.579> picking<00:01:39.060> up<00:01:39.150> its<00:01:39.270> foot

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
default to the wave picking up its foot

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.960 
default to the wave picking up its foot
and<00:01:39.720> waving<00:01:40.049> and<00:01:40.470> we<00:01:41.220> always<00:01:41.400> you<00:01:41.700> know<00:01:41.759> how<00:01:41.909> to

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
and waving and we always you know how to

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.819 
and waving and we always you know how to
use<00:01:42.119> strategies<00:01:42.570> to<00:01:42.659> avoid<00:01:42.960> this<00:01:43.229> so<00:01:43.530> that<00:01:43.680> the

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
use strategies to avoid this so that the

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.889 
use strategies to avoid this so that the
animal<00:01:44.369> wouldn't<00:01:44.520> do<00:01:44.729> that<00:01:44.880> during<00:01:45.119> a<00:01:45.270> show<00:01:45.509> or

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
animal wouldn't do that during a show or

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.270 
animal wouldn't do that during a show or
doing<00:01:46.110> a<00:01:46.170> performance<00:01:46.710> and<00:01:46.829> those<00:01:46.890> sorts<00:01:47.220> of

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
doing a performance and those sorts of

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.170 
doing a performance and those sorts of
things<00:01:47.490> and<00:01:47.670> so<00:01:48.380> it<00:01:49.380> was<00:01:49.530> kind<00:01:49.740> of<00:01:49.770> a<00:01:49.860> problem

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
things and so it was kind of a problem

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.870 
things and so it was kind of a problem
however<00:01:51.180> I<00:01:51.750> realized<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:53.130> other<00:01:53.159> day<00:01:53.399> that<00:01:53.579> I

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
however I realized the other day that I

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.819 
however I realized the other day that I
had<00:01:54.060> accidentally<00:01:54.570> trained<00:01:54.840> my<00:01:55.020> new<00:01:55.170> golden

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
had accidentally trained my new golden

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.889 
had accidentally trained my new golden
retriever<00:01:56.250> ginger<00:01:56.700> who's<00:01:56.880> now<00:01:57.030> 15<00:01:57.420> weeks<00:01:57.630> old

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
retriever ginger who's now 15 weeks old

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.010 
retriever ginger who's now 15 weeks old
the<00:01:58.500> first<00:01:58.829> behavior<00:01:59.640> which<00:01:59.969> was<00:02:00.210> leave<00:02:00.750> it

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
the first behavior which was leave it

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.490 
the first behavior which was leave it
and<00:02:01.229> I<00:02:01.829> really<00:02:02.430> lucked<00:02:02.670> out<00:02:02.880> here<00:02:03.360> and<00:02:03.540> I<00:02:03.780> and<00:02:04.229> I

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
and I really lucked out here and I and I

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.319 
and I really lucked out here and I and I
wanted<00:02:04.740> to<00:02:04.920> share<00:02:05.250> this<00:02:05.399> suggestion<00:02:05.880> with<00:02:06.210> you

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
wanted to share this suggestion with you

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:10.130 
wanted to share this suggestion with you
because<00:02:06.689> I<00:02:06.930> think<00:02:07.409> that<00:02:07.979> leave<00:02:08.550> it<00:02:08.819> is<00:02:09.140> the

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
because I think that leave it is the

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.400 
because I think that leave it is the
Holy<00:02:10.440> Grail<00:02:10.979> behavior<00:02:11.910> of

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
Holy Grail behavior of

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.980 
Holy Grail behavior of
training<00:02:13.830> it's<00:02:14.250> the<00:02:14.550> most<00:02:14.760> beneficial<00:02:15.750> you

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
training it's the most beneficial you

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.600 
training it's the most beneficial you
can<00:02:16.200> get<00:02:16.380> your<00:02:16.530> dog<00:02:16.650> to<00:02:16.830> back<00:02:17.040> off<00:02:17.250> of<00:02:17.280> other

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
can get your dog to back off of other

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.750 
can get your dog to back off of other
people<00:02:18.150> stop<00:02:18.780> chewing<00:02:19.170> kids<00:02:19.530> leave<00:02:20.340> the<00:02:20.370> food

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
people stop chewing kids leave the food

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:21.920 
people stop chewing kids leave the food
that<00:02:20.910> you've<00:02:21.060> accidentally<00:02:21.450> dropped<00:02:21.690> on<00:02:21.840> the

hands<00:02:27.180> down<00:02:27.480> the<00:02:27.750> command<00:02:28.110> I<00:02:28.320> use<00:02:28.710> more<00:02:29.160> than

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
hands down the command I use more than

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.420 
hands down the command I use more than
ever<00:02:29.640> the<00:02:30.180> other<00:02:30.420> one<00:02:30.690> that<00:02:30.720> I<00:02:30.930> use<00:02:31.350> that<00:02:32.160> that

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
ever the other one that I use that that

ever the other one that I use that that
is<00:02:32.700> really<00:02:33.060> awesome<00:02:33.600> is<00:02:33.720> to<00:02:33.960> go<00:02:34.110> to<00:02:34.170> your<00:02:34.380> bed

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
is really awesome is to go to your bed

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.740 
is really awesome is to go to your bed
because<00:02:35.370> go<00:02:35.550> to<00:02:35.580> your<00:02:35.790> bed<00:02:35.970> is<00:02:36.150> kind<00:02:36.450> of<00:02:36.540> like

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
because go to your bed is kind of like

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.810 
because go to your bed is kind of like
leave<00:02:37.050> it<00:02:37.230> where<00:02:37.530> they<00:02:38.280> have<00:02:38.430> to<00:02:38.520> go<00:02:38.610> to<00:02:38.700> their

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
leave it where they have to go to their

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.250 
leave it where they have to go to their
bed<00:02:38.940> so<00:02:39.210> they're<00:02:39.360> automatically<00:02:39.810> leaving

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
bed so they're automatically leaving

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.910 
bed so they're automatically leaving
something<00:02:40.530> and<00:02:40.890> so<00:02:41.870> with<00:02:42.870> my<00:02:43.020> last<00:02:43.290> dog<00:02:43.650> that<00:02:43.860> I

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
something and so with my last dog that I

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.710 
something and so with my last dog that I
have<00:02:43.950> I<00:02:44.100> taught<00:02:44.280> go<00:02:44.820> to<00:02:44.880> your<00:02:45.030> bed<00:02:45.240> as<00:02:45.510> its

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
have I taught go to your bed as its

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.660 
have I taught go to your bed as its
first<00:02:45.990> command<00:02:46.470> and<00:02:46.680> with<00:02:47.010> this<00:02:47.130> talk<00:02:47.400> I

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
first command and with this talk I

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.060 
first command and with this talk I
injure<00:02:48.390> I<00:02:48.660> taught<00:02:48.990> leave<00:02:49.320> it<00:02:49.500> as<00:02:49.620> the<00:02:49.890> first

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
injure I taught leave it as the first

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.610 
injure I taught leave it as the first
command<00:02:50.460> and<00:02:50.640> so<00:02:51.060> what<00:02:51.240> I<00:02:51.270> notice<00:02:51.780> when<00:02:52.170> and

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
command and so what I notice when and

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.050 
command and so what I notice when and
when<00:02:52.860> I<00:02:52.890> think<00:02:53.010> back<00:02:53.250> about<00:02:53.430> the<00:02:53.730> training

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
when I think back about the training

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.250 
when I think back about the training
what<00:02:54.240> I<00:02:54.270> notice<00:02:54.540> when<00:02:54.660> I'm<00:02:54.750> teaching<00:02:54.870> the<00:02:55.080> dogs

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
what I notice when I'm teaching the dogs

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.980 
what I notice when I'm teaching the dogs
to<00:02:55.380> do<00:02:55.500> things<00:02:55.710> first<00:02:56.010> is<00:02:56.190> is<00:02:57.120> they<00:02:57.750> always

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 
to do things first is is they always

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.830 
to do things first is is they always
would<00:02:58.380> revert<00:02:58.770> back<00:02:59.190> to<00:02:59.730> the<00:03:00.030> first<00:03:00.390> behavior

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
would revert back to the first behavior

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.660 
would revert back to the first behavior
I<00:03:00.870> taught<00:03:01.170> them<00:03:01.380> if<00:03:01.500> my<00:03:01.710> old<00:03:01.890> dog<00:03:02.130> Bower<00:03:02.400> if

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
I taught them if my old dog Bower if

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.390 
I taught them if my old dog Bower if
there<00:03:02.850> was<00:03:02.970> a<00:03:03.000> bed<00:03:03.300> anywhere<00:03:03.870> near<00:03:04.230> where<00:03:05.130> he

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
there was a bed anywhere near where he

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.190 
there was a bed anywhere near where he
was<00:03:05.640> and<00:03:05.850> I<00:03:05.880> asked<00:03:06.120> him<00:03:06.210> to<00:03:06.240> do<00:03:06.420> something<00:03:06.450> he

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
was and I asked him to do something he

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.140 
was and I asked him to do something he
would<00:03:07.350> without<00:03:07.740> even<00:03:08.010> thinking<00:03:08.520> want<00:03:08.940> to<00:03:09.060> go

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
would without even thinking want to go

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.480 
would without even thinking want to go
to<00:03:09.210> the<00:03:09.360> bed<00:03:09.600> first<00:03:10.230> because<00:03:10.980> especially<00:03:11.280> if

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
didn't do calm I worked on go to bed and

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.630 
didn't do calm I worked on go to bed and
worked<00:03:51.209> on<00:03:51.360> leave<00:03:51.570> it<00:03:51.750> first<00:03:52.110> and<00:03:52.640> I've

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
worked on leave it first and I've

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.110 
worked on leave it first and I've
realized<00:03:54.630> that<00:03:55.080> those<00:03:55.980> two<00:03:56.400> behaviors<00:03:56.790> have

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
realized that those two behaviors have

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.590 
realized that those two behaviors have
made<00:03:57.360> my<00:03:57.630> life<00:03:57.930> so<00:03:58.230> much<00:03:59.100> easier<00:03:59.370> because<00:04:00.150> they

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
made my life so much easier because they

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.350 
made my life so much easier because they
are<00:04:00.900> the<00:04:01.110> behaviors<00:04:01.590> my<00:04:01.830> dog<00:04:02.100> will<00:04:02.430> go<00:04:02.670> to<00:04:02.730> by

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
are the behaviors my dog will go to by

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.050 
are the behaviors my dog will go to by
default<00:04:03.870> so<00:04:04.830> when<00:04:05.010> an<00:04:05.160> environment<00:04:05.700> is<00:04:05.760> very

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
default so when an environment is very

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.720 
default so when an environment is very
distracting<00:04:06.959> the<00:04:07.530> message<00:04:08.280> gets<00:04:08.640> through

distracting the message gets through

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.300 
distracting the message gets through
clear<00:04:09.450> because<00:04:09.660> it<00:04:09.930> was<00:04:09.959> the<00:04:10.200> first<00:04:10.310> behavior

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
clear because it was the first behavior

they<00:04:11.910> learned<00:04:12.180> so<00:04:12.600> my<00:04:12.870> tip<00:04:13.170> to<00:04:13.440> you<00:04:13.470> if<00:04:14.100> you

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
learn it in 20 minutes by the way it

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.110 
learn it in 20 minutes by the way it
took<00:04:43.860> her<00:04:43.980> a<00:04:44.010> couple<00:04:44.220> of<00:04:44.370> days<00:04:44.580> to<00:04:44.820> learn<00:04:44.940> that

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 
took her a couple of days to learn that

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.870 
took her a couple of days to learn that
behavior<00:04:45.600> but<00:04:46.590> maybe<00:04:47.250> that's<00:04:47.520> because<00:04:47.580> I<00:04:47.760> have

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 
behavior but maybe that's because I have

behavior but maybe that's because I have
three<00:04:48.090> kids<00:04:48.330> like<00:04:48.660> running<00:04:49.380> around<00:04:49.470> in<00:04:49.710> my

house is a little more distracting but I

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:53.930 
house is a little more distracting but I
did<00:04:52.380> teach<00:04:52.620> leave<00:04:52.890> it<00:04:53.070> in<00:04:53.220> a<00:04:53.460> very<00:04:53.700> short

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:53.940 
did teach leave it in a very short

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.150 
did teach leave it in a very short
amount<00:04:54.120> of<00:04:54.300> time<00:04:54.360> and<00:04:54.870> both<00:04:55.740> are<00:04:55.980> fantastic

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160 
amount of time and both are fantastic

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.370 
amount of time and both are fantastic
and<00:04:56.880> both<00:04:57.270> are<00:04:57.450> behaviors<00:04:57.870> that<00:04:57.900> I<00:04:58.050> highly

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:58.380 
and both are behaviors that I highly

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:00.770 
and both are behaviors that I highly
recommend<00:04:58.410> that<00:04:59.010> that<00:04:59.820> you<00:05:00.030> that<00:05:00.360> you<00:05:00.510> teach

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780 
recommend that that you that you teach

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:03.350 
recommend that that you that you teach
your<00:05:00.990> dog<00:05:01.230> then<00:05:01.860> the<00:05:02.010> third<00:05:02.250> example<00:05:02.820> that<00:05:03.330> I

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 
your dog then the third example that I

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.060 
your dog then the third example that I
wanted<00:05:03.660> to<00:05:03.720> share<00:05:03.900> with<00:05:04.020> you<00:05:04.260> is<00:05:04.440> that<00:05:04.860> if

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:05.070 
wanted to share with you is that if

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:06.620 
wanted to share with you is that if
you've<00:05:05.310> already<00:05:05.640> trained<00:05:06.120> your<00:05:06.210> dog<00:05:06.390> its

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:06.630 
you've already trained your dog its

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:09.740 
you've already trained your dog its
first<00:05:06.900> behavior<00:05:07.440> and<00:05:08.060> think<00:05:09.060> about<00:05:09.360> how<00:05:09.690> you

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:09.750 
first behavior and think about how you

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:12.290 
first behavior and think about how you
could<00:05:10.110> use<00:05:10.170> that<00:05:10.680> behavior<00:05:11.250> in<00:05:11.490> a<00:05:12.270> way

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.300 
could use that behavior in a way

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.480 
could use that behavior in a way
realizing<00:05:13.200> your<00:05:13.320> dog<00:05:13.500> is<00:05:13.620> going<00:05:13.770> to<00:05:13.980> default

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:14.490 
realizing your dog is going to default

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:18.770 
realizing your dog is going to default
to<00:05:14.640> it<00:05:14.910> too<00:05:15.480> to<00:05:16.350> be<00:05:16.710> a<00:05:16.740> better<00:05:17.040> asset<00:05:17.370> not<00:05:18.300> asset

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:18.780 
to it too to be a better asset not asset

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:20.600 
to it too to be a better asset not asset
well<00:05:19.170> I<00:05:19.260> guess<00:05:19.440> asset<00:05:19.890> in<00:05:20.040> your<00:05:20.070> training

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:20.610 
well I guess asset in your training

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:22.520 
well I guess asset in your training

what<00:05:43.290> a<00:05:43.320> difference<00:05:43.500> it<00:05:43.860> makes<00:05:43.890> I've<00:05:44.340> never

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:44.550 
what a difference it makes I've never

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:47.150 
what a difference it makes I've never
put<00:05:45.060> the<00:05:45.180> two<00:05:45.390> together<00:05:45.690> before<00:05:46.350> I<00:05:46.560> realized

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:47.160

put the two together before I realized
that<00:05:47.400> dogs<00:05:47.670> do<00:05:47.910> that<00:05:48.090> I<00:05:48.300> just<00:05:48.450> never<00:05:48.600> thought

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:48.840 
that dogs do that I just never thought

that dogs do that I just never thought
how<00:05:49.020> to<00:05:49.080> use<00:05:49.260> it<00:05:49.410> constructively<00:05:49.680> and<00:05:50.510> so<00:05:51.510> I

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:51.540 
how to use it constructively and so I

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:53.000 
how to use it constructively and so I
had<00:05:51.690> that<00:05:51.840> thought<00:05:51.990> today<00:05:52.260> I<00:05:52.470> just<00:05:52.800> want<00:05:52.950> to
