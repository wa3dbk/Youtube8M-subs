00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
going to be on the top of your knuckle

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.479 
going to be on the top of your knuckle
here<00:02:36.970> and<00:02:37.150> your<00:02:37.870> bottom<00:02:38.200> lip<00:02:38.319> is<00:02:38.560> going<00:02:39.010> to<00:02:39.189> be

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
here and your bottom lip is going to be

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:42.000 
here and your bottom lip is going to be
right<00:02:40.299> below<00:02:40.629> the<00:02:40.810> knuckle<00:02:40.959> and<00:02:41.319> you're<00:02:41.889> going

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
right below the knuckle and you're going

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.899 
right below the knuckle and you're going
to<00:02:42.040> be<00:02:42.159> blowing<00:02:43.049> downwards<00:02:44.280> sort<00:02:45.280> of<00:02:45.370> down<00:02:45.670> at

00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:45.909 
to be blowing downwards sort of down at

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:49.280 
to be blowing downwards sort of down at
an<00:02:46.000> angle<00:02:46.389> like<00:02:46.420> this<00:02:46.829> now<00:02:47.829> you<00:02:47.920> don't<00:02:48.069> want<00:02:48.220> to

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
an angle like this now you don't want to

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:54.420 
an angle like this now you don't want to
really<00:02:50.290> scrunch<00:02:50.769> your<00:02:50.829> lips<00:02:51.099> up<00:02:51.250> they're<00:02:53.430> sort

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
really scrunch your lips up they're sort

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.119 
really scrunch your lips up they're sort
of<00:02:54.519> a<00:02:54.669> your<00:02:55.260> person<00:02:56.260> your<00:02:56.349> lips<00:02:56.560> out<00:02:56.799> a<00:02:56.829> little

00:02:57.119 --> 00:02:57.129 
of a your person your lips out a little

00:02:57.129 --> 00:02:59.490 
of a your person your lips out a little
bit<00:02:57.629> getting<00:02:58.629> the<00:02:58.780> angle<00:02:58.870> just<00:02:59.139> right<00:02:59.230> is

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
bit getting the angle just right is

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.089 
bit getting the angle just right is
pretty<00:03:00.400> tough<00:03:00.810> but<00:03:01.810> once<00:03:01.989> you<00:03:02.109> get<00:03:02.290> it<00:03:02.409> I<00:03:02.590> think

00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:03.099 
pretty tough but once you get it I think

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:04.379 
pretty tough but once you get it I think
it's<00:03:03.189> probably<00:03:03.370> sort<00:03:03.639> of<00:03:03.730> like<00:03:03.849> riding<00:03:04.060> a<00:03:04.239> bike

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:04.389 
it's probably sort of like riding a bike

00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:06.929 
it's probably sort of like riding a bike
you<00:03:04.419> just<00:03:04.919> remember<00:03:05.919> the<00:03:06.129> proper<00:03:06.459> angle<00:03:06.760> to<00:03:06.849> do

00:03:06.929 --> 00:03:06.939 
you just remember the proper angle to do

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:08.580 
you just remember the proper angle to do
it<00:03:07.090> like<00:03:07.389> learning<00:03:07.959> to<00:03:08.079> whistle<00:03:08.200> with<00:03:08.379> your

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
it like learning to whistle with your

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.890 
it like learning to whistle with your
lips<00:03:08.769> so<00:03:09.639> I'll<00:03:10.269> try<00:03:10.419> to<00:03:10.480> show<00:03:10.629> you<00:03:10.720> from<00:03:10.810> the

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
lips so I'll try to show you from the

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.640 
lips so I'll try to show you from the
side<00:03:11.109> here<00:03:11.319> hands<00:03:12.510> tightly<00:03:13.510> together<00:03:13.720> thumbs

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
side here hands tightly together thumbs

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:29.819 
side here hands tightly together thumbs
aligned<00:03:15.659> we've<00:03:16.659> got<00:03:16.870> that<00:03:17.079> gap<00:03:17.889> in<00:03:18.159> there<00:03:28.829> see

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:29.829 
aligned we've got that gap in there see

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:31.559 
aligned we've got that gap in there see
now<00:03:30.010> I'm<00:03:30.159> messing<00:03:30.459> though<00:03:30.579> I<00:03:30.879> think<00:03:31.389> it's

00:03:31.559 --> 00:03:31.569 
now I'm messing though I think it's

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:37.009 
now I'm messing though I think it's
because<00:03:31.720> my<00:03:31.870> hands<00:03:32.560> are<00:03:32.650> a<00:03:32.680> little<00:03:32.739> sweaty

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:39.030 

so<00:03:38.019> that's<00:03:38.169> sort<00:03:38.290> of<00:03:38.379> what<00:03:38.500> my<00:03:38.560> mouth<00:03:38.739> is<00:03:38.919> doing

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
so that's sort of what my mouth is doing

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.719 
so that's sort of what my mouth is doing
what<00:03:39.280> I'm<00:03:39.370> doing<00:03:39.400> this<00:03:39.810> top<00:03:40.810> lip<00:03:41.079> is<00:03:41.949> pressed

00:03:42.719 --> 00:03:42.729 
what I'm doing this top lip is pressed

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:44.189 
what I'm doing this top lip is pressed
against<00:03:43.120> the<00:03:43.180> top<00:03:43.419> knuckle<00:03:43.780> pretty<00:03:43.989> hard

00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:44.199 
against the top knuckle pretty hard

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:47.280 
against the top knuckle pretty hard
actually<00:03:44.760> but<00:03:45.760> the<00:03:45.849> bottom<00:03:46.180> lip<00:03:46.329> is<00:03:46.479> more

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
actually but the bottom lip is more

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.500 
actually but the bottom lip is more
loosely<00:03:47.650> pressed<00:03:48.010> forming<00:03:48.790> a<00:03:48.849> seal<00:03:49.060> here<00:03:49.329> and

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
loosely pressed forming a seal here and

00:03:49.510 --> 00:04:05.360 
loosely pressed forming a seal here and
you're<00:03:49.989> blowing<00:03:50.290> down<00:03:50.650> at<00:03:51.040> an<00:03:51.340> angle

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.800

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
by changing the size of the pocket

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:17.810 
by changing the size of the pocket
