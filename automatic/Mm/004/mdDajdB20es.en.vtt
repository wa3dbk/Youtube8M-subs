 Halle RPO the best comes to DVD to take a ride will be a movie of the whole 

00:00:04.929 --> 00:00:07.390
 to say to big clubs 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:11.360
 Red stands for such a big fear or extremely retired 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:12.809
 Stress dangerous 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.189
 Lead actor Bruce Willis played Exterior and himself 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:19.330
 Clerk earned that she is always appreciative of his person 

00:00:19.329 --> 00:00:22.570
 iced and the phone to contact the heir of a 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.349
 At night, a killer squad visits a very cool one 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:30.140
 casual yet feminine vein crew but this command from the 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.910
 Road to rooms and sets off to clear up 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.790
 what's going on there 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.750
 as the first had the clerk herself Rieger the 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.719
 Telephone contact with old age must bring to safety 

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:44.579
 and if he joins his ex-colleagues here wonderfully played 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.790
 Morgan Freeman John Malkovich and Helen 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.040
 Müller if that are out of the award winner 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.400
 By the way, who then gives John Malkovich a particularly ceded early against 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.780
 Ex-teacher surrendered 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.940
 one of the best seen differently 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.040
 who in the team really really worth seeing 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.560
 Finally, there is a very cursory expert on every second expert 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.790
 the property looks fantastic concrete could be because the conversion Megan 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.000
 Fox is not the best brand stretching to be adopted and consume 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.090
 for years more about which one then say that at least virtually take over 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.090
 here and there a small supplement 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.770
 I can not believe it is dead 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.100
 it stays at 0 0 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.100
 that fits his 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.680
 how difficult it was 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.020
 I was a bit scary 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.020
 4 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.950
 why do not they want to save 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.170
 as not quite gone for years 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.170
 by Martin Schildwächter Dusseldorf is under five years old 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:55.939
 it looks great for that 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:58.939
 fantastic 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.660
 let's not say that she is very relieved of the command 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:04.380
 NATO 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.899
 because they will do everything in their power to continue to do so 

00:02:30.669 --> 00:02:33.669
 these are bicycles 

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:39.089
 he has lost face yes I can go 

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:47.879
 but only recently 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:50.939
 the coat is the fourth president of the United States 

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:55.569
 which creates a death list and all eyewitnesses of a Moss has that 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:59.359
 back out of the way for which he was once responsible for the 80s on this 

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:01.839
 List also our main heroes 

00:03:01.839 --> 00:03:06.459
 you have to honestly say this movie is action and shootouts pot the 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:09.749
 Story is not quite as far-fetched as my Wimber 

00:03:09.749 --> 00:03:13.519
 Expendables is me just because he says I thought that would be a total 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:15.199
 normal action movie 

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:18.390
 sporadically the critics firefighters but had to determine 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.490
 the relatively much Klamauk from 1 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:24.320
 It's a lot like being on expendables on no half things 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:28.820
 1 and 2 meet if you know that before that that is a very funny 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:33.240
 Film dramaturgic Maier what can you say but it's just not extreme 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:37.450
 well occupied Kaarst this movie is funny I was a little disappointed 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.470
 because I expected something different 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.020
 I've seen better films in this direction as well 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:46.300
 Example of an event in Athens if the film does not know the way one 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:49.309
 Criticism will follow then look at you necessarily go 

00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:53.629
 for me must first gather is world but a fairly successful 

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:57.999
 Film if you know what you are getting into and find it worth seeing and 

00:03:57.999 --> 00:04:00.309
 therefore give him seven out of ten points
