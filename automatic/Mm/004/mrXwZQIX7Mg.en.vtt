00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:05.419
 If Hakodate-shi comes over and Eniwaji Asuka's high, it will be of value 

00:00:05.419 --> 00:00:07.989
 How do you feel in total 5 types 

00:00:07.989 --> 00:00:10.599
 Yes, as a whole team 

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:12.089
 ny 

00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:15.089
 Focusing on live coaches 

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:19.179
 I'm wondering if I'm going in a good way 

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:22.689
 I personally say something special about this year's campsite 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:24.869
 What's up? 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.069
 I agree 

00:00:27.069 --> 00:00:30.419
 I can not do one more point, but I can not be convinced even in the light 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:31.589
 so 

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:35.450
 I am really happy and confident this year and I am full 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.310
 I think that there is nothing important after that 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:39.440
 Is it 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.180
 Yamashiro 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:42.640
 I have no treatment 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.180
 The most important part and the story As a team 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:47.930
 What kind of volvar 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:49.950
 I don't have a student 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.480
 I think that there is a simple especially later 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.850
 I think that I came to that camp and played the game in the same 12 years 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.480
 But what is being done in it is such a problem or something like this 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.420
 The daily routine is a total of 5 types that can not 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.300
 I am in front of Yamakawa 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.360
 As a team if it is within the limit of the village 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.350
 Blood is also done 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.300
 To be able to communicate 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.710
 I'll do my best to ask why I was old 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.810
 How can I get in front of the ball 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.240
 I think if you do as a team of 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.610
 When it can be done, structural reform will bring good results 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.479
 That's it, but I do not know where it is, but there 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:32.090
 Of course, I think credit is like securitization 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.240
 I personally think that this year's team results are important 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.750
 But there is also a tournament targeted for selection of the Olympic Games 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.540
 How about Taguchi 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:40.880
 1 year 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.150
 Why is stable performance 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.330
 I think that I want to stop it becoming a condition from 2002 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.850
 Ask questions from that supporter this time by all means 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.620
 I hope you like it 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:57.230
 2 I can not separate by such a favorite season 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:58.500
 You need 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.960
 Britain is still a child 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.150
 I always carry the Honda player that I made myself behind the goal 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.510
 Are you based on 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:10.590
 Can you decide the goal for the south pole goal in this match? 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.020
 I recovered from what I felt 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.449
 total- 

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:15.929
 I turned around 

00:02:15.929 --> 00:02:17.269
 The supporter is 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:18.919
 It's a book 

00:02:18.919 --> 00:02:20.689
 I'm waving the flag 

00:02:20.689 --> 00:02:23.859
 I'm based on that and I'm going to shake my hand there 

00:02:23.859 --> 00:02:24.479
 is 

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:27.179
 It is a diet book of friction of this Monaco, but 

00:02:27.179 --> 00:02:31.129
 I can not make 1 score this year 

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:33.669
 Every year we have two digits 

00:02:33.669 --> 00:02:35.909
 That's a shame 

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:38.840
 However, Mr. Yokoyama was in good security 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.539
 Also called law 3 

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:43.739
 On the other hand, we are asking what is the matter 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:47.190
 By the way, put a lot of children of that summer in that support 

00:02:47.189 --> 00:02:49.909
 Though I was a kid, what kind of child was he when he was a child 

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:52.569
 I use 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:55.659
 It is the heart 

00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:58.639
 A lot from the terminal of the user 

00:02:58.639 --> 00:02:59.859
 There are many 

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:03.149
 About 1 adult 

00:03:03.149 --> 00:03:05.169
 -Of the emitter to move 

00:03:05.169 --> 00:03:08.489
 Digital consumer electronics Kanda Saya Kang An Chan 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:11.049
 It was funny 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:13.310
 It was formed this year 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.310
 Is it such an arrowhead? 

00:03:18.929 --> 00:03:21.529
 I will do my best 

00:03:21.529 --> 00:03:24.529
 Stocks going out this season 

00:03:27.249 --> 00:03:29.469
 I will practice 

00:03:29.469 --> 00:03:32.689
 It's not easy 

00:03:32.689 --> 00:03:33.989
 Together 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:35.480
 Let's make Nagoya live
