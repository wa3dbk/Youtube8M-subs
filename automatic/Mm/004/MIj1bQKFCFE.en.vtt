00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.450 
ourselves and we did well so we can play
like<00:01:13.020> that<00:01:13.170> we<00:01:13.530> can<00:01:13.710> week<00:01:13.890> out<00:01:14.040> back<00:01:14.280> home

we'll<00:01:15.090> get<00:01:15.180> some<00:01:15.330> good<00:01:15.450> results<00:01:15.600> and

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
we'll get some good results and

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.660 
we'll get some good results and
obviously<00:01:16.740> has<00:01:16.860> not<00:01:16.950> been<00:01:17.070> a<00:01:17.130> great<00:01:17.340> start<00:01:17.549> to

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
obviously has not been a great start to

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.910 
obviously has not been a great start to
our<00:01:17.700> season<00:01:18.090> but<00:01:18.270> I<00:01:18.450> think<00:01:18.840> I'm<00:01:19.049> we<00:01:19.590> sure<00:01:19.770> that

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
our season but I think I'm we sure that

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.230 
our season but I think I'm we sure that
we'll<00:01:20.040> call<00:01:20.220> it<00:01:20.310> a<00:01:20.369> team<00:01:20.520> we<00:01:20.640> can<00:01:20.970> turn<00:01:21.119> it

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
we'll call it a team we can turn it

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.940 
we'll call it a team we can turn it
around<00:01:21.270> so<00:01:21.659> we<00:01:21.960> have<00:01:22.049> to<00:01:22.170> work<00:01:22.350> hard<00:01:22.590> like<00:01:22.740> this

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
around so we have to work hard like this

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.429 
around so we have to work hard like this
take<00:01:23.610> every<00:01:23.850> game<00:01:24.000> with<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.240> attitude<00:01:24.509> and<00:01:24.930> I

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
take every game with the attitude and I

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.469 
take every game with the attitude and I
think<00:01:25.740> we'll<00:01:25.860> be<00:01:25.890> okay<00:01:26.189> so<00:01:26.250> tonight<00:01:27.180> with<00:01:27.420> the

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
think we'll be okay so tonight with the

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:28.789 
think we'll be okay so tonight with the
result<00:01:27.780> is<00:01:27.869> bad<00:01:28.020> but<00:01:28.229> performance<00:01:28.680> is<00:01:28.770> very

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
result is bad but performance is very
