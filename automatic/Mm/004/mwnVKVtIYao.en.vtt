 want to invest more on dark lipstick 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.109
 because we do not use frequently or 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.640
 so we want to test for example 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:27.500
 another color 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.600

 from the list that I like a lot here 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.409
