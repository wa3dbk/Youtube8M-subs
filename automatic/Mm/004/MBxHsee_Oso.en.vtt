all right I have another question yeah I

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.980 
all right I have another question yeah I
have<00:00:03.240> question<00:00:03.600> from<00:00:03.720> Natalie<00:00:04.080> Dingle

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:05.990 
have question from Natalie Dingle

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:08.240 
have question from Natalie Dingle
approximately<00:00:06.990> how<00:00:07.200> many<00:00:07.259> stars<00:00:07.770> are<00:00:07.890> born

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
approximately how many stars are born

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:14.930 
approximately how many stars are born
and<00:00:08.460> dying<00:00:08.670> each<00:00:08.910> day<00:00:13.009> I'm<00:00:14.009> assuming<00:00:14.490> birthday

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
and dying each day I'm assuming birthday

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.500 
and dying each day I'm assuming birthday
and<00:00:15.540> not<00:00:15.780> somebody<00:00:16.080> else's<00:00:16.470> day<00:00:16.710> earth<00:00:17.510> right

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
and not somebody else's day earth right

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.570 
and not somebody else's day earth right
but<00:00:19.020> of<00:00:19.199> course<00:00:19.410> other<00:00:19.650> planets<00:00:20.220> have<00:00:20.340> days

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
but of course other planets have days

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.050 
but of course other planets have days
yes<00:00:21.390> in<00:00:21.600> fact<00:00:21.720> Venus's<00:00:22.410> day<00:00:22.650> is<00:00:23.519> longer<00:00:23.910> than

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
yes in fact Venus's day is longer than

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.900 
yes in fact Venus's day is longer than
its<00:00:24.300> year<00:00:24.590> just<00:00:25.590> chill<00:00:26.250> on<00:00:26.279> that<00:00:26.400> one<00:00:26.699> for<00:00:26.849> a

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
its year just chill on that one for a

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.640 
its year just chill on that one for a
bit<00:00:27.560> so<00:00:29.510> Leanne's<00:00:30.510> face<00:00:30.779> just<00:00:31.109> scrunched<00:00:31.560> up

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
bit so Leanne's face just scrunched up

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.250 
bit so Leanne's face just scrunched up
in<00:00:31.920> a<00:00:34.910> yeah<00:00:35.910> yeah<00:00:36.180> Venus<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.690> day<00:00:36.899> is<00:00:37.079> last

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
in a yeah yeah Venus the day is last

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.690 
in a yeah yeah Venus the day is last
longer<00:00:37.469> than<00:00:37.620> yet<00:00:37.800> but<00:00:37.980> we'll<00:00:38.309> get<00:00:38.460> back<00:00:38.550> to

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
longer than yet but we'll get back to

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.660 
longer than yet but we'll get back to
that<00:00:38.850> if<00:00:39.239> we<00:00:40.079> go<00:00:40.200> there<00:00:40.350> so<00:00:40.770> and<00:00:41.280> where<00:00:41.489> was<00:00:41.579> i

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
that if we go there so and where was i

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.940 
that if we go there so and where was i
before<00:00:41.700> i<00:00:42.030> distracted<00:00:42.510> myself<00:00:42.890> how<00:00:43.890> many

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
before i distracted myself how many

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.459 
before i distracted myself how many

started to warn you today so you can do
what's<00:00:46.680> called<00:00:46.739> a<00:00:46.920> back-of-the-envelope

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:48.079 
what's called a back-of-the-envelope

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:50.450 
what's called a back-of-the-envelope
calculation<00:00:49.079> really<00:00:49.350> ready<00:00:49.530> all<00:00:49.710> right<00:00:49.860> our

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
calculation really ready all right our

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.479 
calculation really ready all right our
galaxy<00:00:51.000> has<00:00:51.030> about<00:00:51.680> just<00:00:52.680> say<00:00:52.800> 100<00:00:53.160> billion

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
galaxy has about just say 100 billion

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.689 
galaxy has about just say 100 billion
stars<00:00:53.719> okay<00:00:54.719> and<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.980> universe<00:00:56.309> has<00:00:56.340> been

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
stars okay and the universe has been

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.670 
stars okay and the universe has been
around<00:00:56.910> for<00:00:57.360> about<00:00:57.449> 10<00:00:58.050> billion<00:00:58.260> years<00:00:58.410> with

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
around for about 10 billion years with

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.260 
around for about 10 billion years with
back-of-the-envelope<00:00:59.370> means<00:00:59.850> you<00:01:00.000> change

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
back-of-the-envelope means you change

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.510 
back-of-the-envelope means you change
the<00:01:00.510> number<00:01:00.780> to<00:01:00.960> make<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.230> math<00:01:01.410> easy<00:01:01.710> but

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
the number to make the math easy but

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.200 
the number to make the math easy but
you're<00:01:02.730> answering<00:01:03.140> my<00:01:04.140> taxes<00:01:04.589> all<00:01:05.060> so<00:01:06.060> but

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
you're answering my taxes all so but

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.640 
you're answering my taxes all so but
your<00:01:06.330> answer<00:01:06.600> will<00:01:06.720> be<00:01:06.810> approximately

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
your answer will be approximately

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.020 
your answer will be approximately
correct<00:01:07.680> and<00:01:08.250> later<00:01:08.460> on<00:01:08.580> you<00:01:08.670> could<00:01:08.820> put<00:01:08.939> the

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
correct and later on you could put the

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.940 
correct and later on you could put the
exact<00:01:09.360> number<00:01:09.689> in<00:01:09.840> if<00:01:10.290> you<00:01:10.439> want<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.650> exact

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
exact number in if you want the exact

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.190 
exact number in if you want the exact
answer<00:01:11.189> so<00:01:11.880> say<00:01:12.119> we<00:01:12.299> have<00:01:12.330> about<00:01:12.570> 100<00:01:12.930> billion

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
answer so say we have about 100 billion

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.499 
answer so say we have about 100 billion
stars<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:14.010> universe<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.790> galaxy<00:01:15.420> has

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
stars and the universe the galaxy has

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.380 
stars and the universe the galaxy has
been<00:01:15.570> out<00:01:15.689> for<00:01:15.869> ten<00:01:16.049> billion<00:01:16.439> years<00:01:16.520> okay<00:01:17.520> so

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
been out for ten billion years okay so

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.420 
been out for ten billion years okay so
we<00:01:19.110> have<00:01:19.200> a<00:01:19.229> hundred<00:01:19.350> billion<00:01:19.619> stars<00:01:19.710> we've

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
we have a hundred billion stars we've

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.820 
we have a hundred billion stars we've
been<00:01:20.549> around<00:01:20.640> for<00:01:20.880> ten<00:01:21.090> billion<00:01:21.450> years<00:01:21.830> that

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
been around for ten billion years that

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.870 
been around for ten billion years that
means<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.220> galaxy<00:01:23.700> makes<00:01:23.939> ten<00:01:24.810> stars<00:01:25.110> a<00:01:25.200> year

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
means the galaxy makes ten stars a year

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.460 
means the galaxy makes ten stars a year
that's<00:01:26.880> an<00:01:27.000> average<00:01:27.119> yeah<00:01:27.659> on<00:01:27.840> average<00:01:27.990> that's

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
that's an average yeah on average that's

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.020 
that's an average yeah on average that's
right<00:01:28.650> if<00:01:28.829> it<00:01:29.009> made<00:01:29.130> ten<00:01:29.340> stars<00:01:29.549> a<00:01:29.670> year

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
right if it made ten stars a year

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.760 
right if it made ten stars a year
throughout<00:01:30.600> this<00:01:30.689> whole<00:01:30.869> life<00:01:31.049> we'd<00:01:31.320> have<00:01:31.470> 100

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
throughout this whole life we'd have 100

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.190 
throughout this whole life we'd have 100
billion<00:01:31.920> stars<00:01:32.420> over<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.509> 10<00:01:33.689> billion<00:01:33.990> years

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
billion stars over the 10 billion years

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
billion stars over the 10 billion years
that's<00:01:34.680> how<00:01:34.770> that<00:01:34.829> works

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
that's how that works

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.039 
that's how that works
so<00:01:35.549> it<00:01:35.970> makes<00:01:36.119> about<00:01:36.240> ten<00:01:36.450> stars<00:01:36.689> a<00:01:36.780> year<00:01:36.930> so

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
so it makes about ten stars a year so

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.740 
so it makes about ten stars a year so
that's<00:01:37.110> about<00:01:37.350> one<00:01:37.590> a<00:01:37.619> month<00:01:37.890> and<00:01:38.360> so<00:01:39.360> we<00:01:39.689> don't

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
that's about one a month and so we don't

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.679 
that's about one a month and so we don't
quite<00:01:40.079> make<00:01:40.320> a<00:01:40.380> star<00:01:40.710> a<00:01:40.740> day<00:01:41.009> on<00:01:41.430> average<00:01:41.689> about

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
quite make a star a day on average about

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.420 
quite make a star a day on average about
one<00:01:43.020> a<00:01:43.049> month<00:01:43.140> we<00:01:44.009> could<00:01:44.130> live<00:01:44.310> with<00:01:44.399> that

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
one a month we could live with that

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.510 
one a month we could live with that
however<00:01:45.470> that's<00:01:46.470> not<00:01:46.649> actually<00:01:46.979> how<00:01:47.250> stars

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
however that's not actually how stars

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.490 
however that's not actually how stars
are<00:01:47.610> born<00:01:47.759> they<00:01:48.210> weren't<00:01:48.479> episodically<00:01:49.200> in

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
are born they weren't episodically in

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.859 
are born they weren't episodically in
stars<00:01:50.009> in<00:01:50.369> stellar<00:01:50.670> nurseries<00:01:51.360> where

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
stars in stellar nurseries where

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.109 
stars in stellar nurseries where
thousands<00:01:52.619> of<00:01:52.740> stars<00:01:53.009> are<00:01:53.280> born<00:01:53.490> all<00:01:53.820> at<00:01:54.030> the

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
thousands of stars are born all at the

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.990 
thousands of stars are born all at the
same<00:01:54.299> time<00:01:54.439> so<00:01:55.439> if<00:01:55.560> you<00:01:55.680> were<00:01:55.770> a<00:01:55.979> planet<00:01:56.880> in

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
same time so if you were a planet in

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.670
