00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.710
 English which means teenagers so 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.269
 it's a series that is 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:27.699
 I will say the the product between two 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:30.910
 weight and strength 10 33 3 strengths 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:34.030
 that is, martika production which is 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:36.399
 an audiovisual structure the rti which 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.620
 accompany the program throughout 

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:41.350
 unfold this for three years and a 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.750
 mobile phone operator stole his 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:46.300
 works and of course obviously who 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:49.540
 accompany the project to their own little 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.979
 historic teenagers this is a series the 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.649
 content has been eight years andyy series 

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:54.760
 which is sheathed three years ago and that makes 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:55.960
 an incursion into the world of 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.039
 teens 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.199
 so there are themes that are 

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:01.480
 developed to know the contact with 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:04.660
 school the results and relationships with 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:06.550
 the parents and then all the themes 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:09.490
 like AIDS and especially the reports 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:13.570
 between young people and this program there a 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:14.530
 hearing that thanks to god was mounted 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.240
 a very good audience 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.979
 today we have this series is 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.970
 broadcast in four countries it is 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:21.399
 disseminated in the case of countries and 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.420
 including an international channel that 

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:24.909
 diffuse today everywhere 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.640
 complicity to worry v5 it's not 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:29.950
 of advertising and the news of this 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.780
 series is the invitation to the festival 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.630
 africa views 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:37.090
 seen from Africa both festival among so many 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.820
 others in montreal which is 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.979
 so much cinema festival that usually 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.829
 it must be said only receives 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:46.119
 fiction and documentary programs 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:49.810
 but especially for this edition is 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:51.100
 there through tv5 have received the series 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.289
 teenagers and immediately hooked 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.170
 the organizers who have seventeen 

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:57.119
 sawmills in confession for the festival 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.770
 what attracted them 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:03.250
 what seduced them is certainly 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.869
 the series in itself the speech to 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.670
 teens that's already a thing 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:07.840
 gets into their world but in addition 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.220
 it's all the mechanism what is there 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.019
 around teenagers because it 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:14.260
 to know is that all 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:16.510
 teens of the teenager we in him 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.459
 contract with the ace with martika 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.140
 production that is to progress from one 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:22.180
 point 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:24.069
 so beyond a series it's a 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.140
 youth who takes the gamble of progress 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:28.870
 one point each quarter and the 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:31.480
 results are convincing yields 1.7 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.400
 will adhere to some of the best 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.690
 academic results most of our 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.579
 actors are high school graduates that's what 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.049
 determines the career that's what 

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:41.380
 determines the square to say there is 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:43.060
 beyond the entertainment aspect there is 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.609
 also the serious and the two young people who 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.810
 leave with us that they are indecent 

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:47.579
 joel him he is a today in 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.410
 second year 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:52.840
 specialization he says a sphere mines 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:54.430
 and oil and vanessa paws and a calf 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.560
 who is of Beninese origin 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.560
 he represented the ivory coast so he 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.599
 there is also the symbol of integration 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:05.380
 so there are four people we will say 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:07.660
 five people this actors trip and 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.340
 writers yourself accompany him in 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.200
 a student and a journalist of the roast 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.870
 and newspaper sees there and if means 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.849
 allow us to parents and to that 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.519
 level it must be said that we have 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:19.980
 support and that's why I'm on 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:22.890
 the plateau d 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.299

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:32.909
 ministry of integration the ministry 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:36.840

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:38.879
 youth and the primature who who we 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.170

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:41.670
 the file has been filed with the 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:44.549

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:47.489
 is at the machete of course a price yes 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:49.920
 you have to know that you know in a 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:52.500

 this series the like the producer has 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:11.430
 the habit of saying it there are symbols 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.290
