what's<00:00:13.799> up<00:00:13.950> everybody<00:00:14.250> right<00:00:14.790> now<00:00:14.820> we<00:00:15.059> are

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
what's up everybody right now we are

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.150 
what's up everybody right now we are
about<00:00:15.450> to<00:00:15.630> review<00:00:16.289> guys<00:00:16.980> best<00:00:17.699> BCAA

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:19.160 
about to review guys best BCAA

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.560 
about to review guys best BCAA
so<00:00:20.160> we're<00:00:20.310> going<00:00:20.460> to<00:00:20.520> be<00:00:20.609> going<00:00:20.760> over<00:00:21.000> what<00:00:21.330> is

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
so we're going to be going over what is

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.720 
so we're going to be going over what is
it<00:00:21.779> we're<00:00:22.230> going<00:00:22.439> over<00:00:22.650> the<00:00:22.769> breakdown<00:00:23.310> the

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
it we're going over the breakdown the

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.970 
it we're going over the breakdown the
flavors<00:00:24.180> available<00:00:24.359> and<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.380> mix<00:00:25.560> ability

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
flavors available and the mix ability

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.859 
flavors available and the mix ability
and<00:00:26.099> taste<00:00:26.310> so<00:00:27.090> what<00:00:27.300> is<00:00:27.510> it

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
and taste so what is it

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.779 
and taste so what is it
it<00:00:28.050> is<00:00:28.199> a<00:00:28.230> branched<00:00:28.650> chain<00:00:28.769> amino<00:00:28.800> acid<00:00:29.609> with<00:00:29.760> a

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
it is a branched chain amino acid with a

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.620 
it is a branched chain amino acid with a
very<00:00:30.590> original<00:00:31.590> name<00:00:31.619> and<00:00:32.099> it's<00:00:32.610> a<00:00:32.850> big<00:00:33.390> a<00:00:33.420> fun

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
very original name and it's a big a fun

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.250 
very original name and it's a big a fun
of<00:00:33.750> EP<00:00:33.989> I<00:00:34.020> call<00:00:34.410> it<00:00:34.559> best<00:00:34.890> BCAA<00:00:35.899> it<00:00:36.899> actually<00:00:37.170> is

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
of EP I call it best BCAA it actually is

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.549 
of EP I call it best BCAA it actually is
a<00:00:37.290> really<00:00:37.350> good<00:00:37.680> product<00:00:37.950> I<00:00:38.460> looked<00:00:38.910> into<00:00:39.120> it

00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:39.559 
a really good product I looked into it

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:43.250 
a really good product I looked into it
myself<00:00:40.559> and<00:00:41.370> used<00:00:42.180> it<00:00:42.329> myself<00:00:42.480> in<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.050> past

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
myself and used it myself in the past

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.049 
myself and used it myself in the past
but<00:00:43.920> to<00:00:44.129> figure<00:00:44.250> of<00:00:44.430> all<00:00:44.520> that<00:00:44.670> let's<00:00:44.789> go<00:00:44.910> right

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
but to figure of all that let's go right

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.910 
but to figure of all that let's go right
into<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.329> breakdown<00:00:48.289> alright<00:00:49.289> so<00:00:49.469> in<00:00:49.649> each

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
into the breakdown alright so in each

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.860 
into the breakdown alright so in each
scoop<00:00:50.340> of<00:00:50.550> best<00:00:51.390> BCAA<00:00:52.699> we<00:00:53.699> got<00:00:53.850> 250<00:00:54.600> milligrams

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
scoop of best BCAA we got 250 milligrams

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.700 
scoop of best BCAA we got 250 milligrams
of<00:00:55.260> leucine<00:00:55.710> 12<00:00:56.309> 50<00:00:56.670> milligrams<00:00:57.090> isoleucine

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 
of leucine 12 50 milligrams isoleucine

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.220 
of leucine 12 50 milligrams isoleucine
1250<00:00:58.710> milligrams<00:00:59.460> of<00:00:59.640> Valium<00:00:59.820> in<00:01:00.149> that<00:01:00.600> 2<00:01:00.840> to<00:01:01.020> 1

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
1250 milligrams of Valium in that 2 to 1

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.920 
1250 milligrams of Valium in that 2 to 1
to<00:01:01.440> 1<00:01:01.620> ratio<00:01:01.829> which<00:01:02.100> i<00:01:02.190> love<00:01:02.430> to<00:01:02.460> see<00:01:02.820> you<00:01:03.809> also

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
to 1 ratio which i love to see you also

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.899 
to 1 ratio which i love to see you also
have<00:01:04.170> AG<00:01:04.409> machine<00:01:04.769> in<00:01:04.920> there<00:01:05.129> that's<00:01:05.640> pretty

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
have AG machine in there that's pretty

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.899 
have AG machine in there that's pretty
much<00:01:06.119> getting<00:01:07.110> my<00:01:07.380> kind<00:01:08.159> of<00:01:08.250> like<00:01:08.340> a<00:01:08.369> cognitive

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
much getting my kind of like a cognitive

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.770 
much getting my kind of like a cognitive
enhancer<00:01:09.540> plus<00:01:09.900> a<00:01:10.909> lrg<00:01:11.909> enhancer<00:01:12.390> so<00:01:12.540> you<00:01:12.630> get

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
enhancer plus a lrg enhancer so you get

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.539 
enhancer plus a lrg enhancer so you get
a<00:01:12.810> little<00:01:12.930> bit<00:01:13.170> of<00:01:13.260> that<00:01:13.409> extra<00:01:13.770> blood<00:01:14.070> flow<00:01:14.130> in

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
a little bit of that extra blood flow in

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.780 
a little bit of that extra blood flow in
there<00:01:15.080> so<00:01:16.080> before<00:01:16.380> I<00:01:16.409> move<00:01:16.560> on<00:01:16.770> what<00:01:17.549> makes

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
there so before I move on what makes

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.910 
there so before I move on what makes
this<00:01:18.000> different<00:01:18.330> or<00:01:18.630> what<00:01:18.869> BPI<00:01:19.259> is<00:01:19.409> um

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
this different or what BPI is um

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.399 
this different or what BPI is um
staining<00:01:20.909> that's<00:01:21.180> different<00:01:21.540> about<00:01:21.689> this<00:01:21.960> BCA

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
staining that's different about this BCA

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.490 
staining that's different about this BCA

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
a new angle own BCAAs and both they're

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:41.680 
a new angle own BCAAs and both they're
going<00:02:40.430> to<00:02:40.489> gain<00:02:40.610> the<00:02:40.819> extra<00:02:41.060> point<00:02:41.390> it<00:02:41.569> would

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
going to gain the extra point it would

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.000 
going to gain the extra point it would
have<00:02:41.780> been<00:02:41.870> an<00:02:41.930> 8<00:02:42.050> out<00:02:42.170> of<00:02:42.260> 10<00:02:42.319> but<00:02:42.709> I'll<00:02:42.830> give

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
have been an 8 out of 10 but I'll give

have been an 8 out of 10 but I'll give
it<00:02:43.040> an<00:02:43.190> extra<00:02:43.400> point<00:02:43.640> because<00:02:44.000> they<00:02:44.180> give<00:02:44.390> me

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
it an extra point because they give me

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.229 
it an extra point because they give me
exact<00:02:45.110> amounts<00:02:45.800> of<00:02:45.920> my<00:02:46.640> fresh<00:02:46.970> chain<00:02:47.150> amino

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
cyclone cup check it out alright did it

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.610 
cyclone cup check it out alright did it
in<00:03:12.849> the<00:03:12.940> last<00:03:13.180> video<00:03:13.540> which<00:03:14.049> was<00:03:14.080> an<00:03:14.379> about

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
in the last video which was an about

00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:27.819 
not forgotten print the cyclone code

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:33.869 
not forgotten print the cyclone code
just<00:03:30.540> see<00:03:31.540> how<00:03:32.379> it<00:03:32.590> mixed<00:03:32.890> up<00:03:33.010> I<00:03:33.190> went<00:03:33.640> a<00:03:33.670> little
