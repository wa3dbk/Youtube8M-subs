00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.200

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.770
 that will change the chip to the 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:09.869
 Africa 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:13.390
 then when you log minecraft will 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:16.569
 stay like this, understand 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:20.260
 The hand you see is a little thinner. 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:24.490
 that there are two I've seen, and it looks like 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:28.060
 which is thinner and that's what I hope to have 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:30.640
 helped you if I helped from a young 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:35.230

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:37.200
 're working out right and I did not help the UN 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.430
 I did not like this because to look for 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.380

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.660
