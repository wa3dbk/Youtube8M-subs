this<00:01:04.619> is<00:01:04.769> why<00:01:04.979> I<00:01:05.309> think<00:01:06.270> every<00:01:06.570> time<00:01:06.720> you<00:01:06.900> get<00:01:07.020> a

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
this is why I think every time you get a

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.440 
this is why I think every time you get a
new<00:01:07.320> piece<00:01:07.560> of<00:01:07.590> gear<00:01:07.979> it<00:01:08.760> takes<00:01:09.000> time<00:01:09.240> to<00:01:09.270> learn

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
new piece of gear it takes time to learn

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.300 
new piece of gear it takes time to learn
the<00:01:10.229> rate<00:01:10.470> of<00:01:10.619> people<00:01:10.770> out<00:01:10.979> there<00:01:11.010> that

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
the rate of people out there that

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.310 
the rate of people out there that
actually<00:01:11.430> read<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.119> manual<00:01:12.600> and<00:01:12.720> really<00:01:13.049> dig

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
actually read the manual and really dig

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.929 
actually read the manual and really dig
into<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:14.010> pieces<00:01:14.280> of<00:01:14.400> equipment<00:01:14.490> and

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
into the pieces of equipment and

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.660 
into the pieces of equipment and
software<00:01:15.659> they<00:01:15.869> own<00:01:16.049> is<00:01:16.369> unfortunately<00:01:17.369> very

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
software they own is unfortunately very

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.490

very very low
what's<00:01:19.950> more<00:01:20.159> often<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.729> case<00:01:20.880> is<00:01:21.180> people<00:01:21.750> get

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
what's more often the case is people get

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.600 
what's more often the case is people get
all<00:01:22.080> this<00:01:22.200> gear<00:01:22.560> and<00:01:22.890> they're<00:01:23.070> always<00:01:23.369> feeding

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
all this gear and they're always feeding

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
the next day you picked up the guitar

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.850 
the next day you picked up the guitar
you<00:01:38.310> would<00:01:38.579> never<00:01:39.030> be<00:01:39.420> able<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:39.720> get<00:01:40.650> to<00:01:40.829> a

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.600 
complicated in some cases as learning a
program<00:01:55.140> like<00:01:55.259> Ableton<00:01:55.740> and<00:01:55.799> or<00:01:55.950> Pro<00:01:56.130> Tools<00:01:56.369> or

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
program like Ableton and or Pro Tools or

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.249 
program like Ableton and or Pro Tools or
Cubase<00:01:57.060> or<00:01:57.360> logic<00:01:58.229> so<00:01:59.630> this<00:02:00.630> may<00:02:00.810> seem<00:02:00.869> kind<00:02:01.229> of

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
counterintuitive coming from me I tend

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.789 
counterintuitive coming from me I tend
to<00:02:03.420> be<00:02:03.540> more<00:02:03.570> of<00:02:03.810> an<00:02:03.899> evangelist<00:02:04.469> for<00:02:04.560> new

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
to be more of an evangelist for new

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.499 
to be more of an evangelist for new
technology<00:02:05.399> and<00:02:05.549> you<00:02:05.610> see<00:02:05.790> me<00:02:05.909> reviewing<00:02:06.240> lots

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
technology and you see me reviewing lots

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.290 
technology and you see me reviewing lots
of<00:02:06.659> new<00:02:06.810> types<00:02:07.020> of<00:02:07.170> gear<00:02:07.469> and<00:02:07.680> I<00:02:08.550> don't

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
of new types of gear and I don't

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.029 
of new types of gear and I don't
necessarily<00:02:09.509> think<00:02:09.959> that<00:02:10.349> you<00:02:10.530> shouldn't<00:02:10.920> go

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
necessarily think that you shouldn't go

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.730 
necessarily think that you shouldn't go
out<00:02:11.069> and<00:02:11.459> buy<00:02:11.910> the<00:02:11.970> new<00:02:12.209> stuff<00:02:12.450> and

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
out and buy the new stuff and

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.370 
out and buy the new stuff and
like<00:02:12.920> that<00:02:13.100> but<00:02:13.400> make<00:02:14.240> sure<00:02:14.270> that<00:02:14.510> when<00:02:14.930> you<00:02:15.080> do

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
like that but make sure that when you do

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.640 
like that but make sure that when you do
you<00:02:15.710> invest<00:02:16.190> the<00:02:16.310> time<00:02:16.480> into<00:02:17.650> mastering

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
you invest the time into mastering

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.640 
you invest the time into mastering
things<00:02:18.950> I<00:02:19.100> mean<00:02:19.250> I<00:02:19.430> spend<00:02:20.210> hours<00:02:20.810> upon<00:02:21.410> hours

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
manual something like that so you

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.630 
manual something like that so you
actually<00:03:23.990> do<00:03:24.500> learn<00:03:24.710> how<00:03:24.980> to<00:03:25.010> use<00:03:25.280> this<00:03:25.460> device

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
your quality will go down it will

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.340 
your quality will go down it will
actually<00:03:31.700> be<00:03:31.790> increased<00:03:32.210> but<00:03:32.690> it<00:03:32.810> is<00:03:32.900> about

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 
actually be increased but it is about

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:35.410 
actually be increased but it is about
taking<00:03:33.680> the<00:03:33.770> time<00:03:33.800> to<00:03:34.490> invest<00:03:34.820> into<00:03:35.030> the<00:03:35.150> new
