00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.630 
can live in peace and it finds out but
one<00:00:33.930> of<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.079> members<00:00:34.380> of<00:00:34.410> Terra<00:00:34.710> is<00:00:34.890> Keith<00:00:35.219> is

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
one of the members of Terra is Keith is

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.090 
one of the members of Terra is Keith is
actually<00:00:36.239> his<00:00:36.360> Kurt<00:00:36.630> isn't<00:00:37.070> necromancy<00:00:38.070> and

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
actually his Kurt isn't necromancy and

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.560 
actually his Kurt isn't necromancy and
it's<00:00:38.399> I'm<00:00:38.610> probably<00:00:38.940> guessing<00:00:39.180> his<00:00:39.390> father

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
it's I'm probably guessing his father

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.750 
it's I'm probably guessing his father
Keith<00:00:39.840> is<00:00:40.020> actually<00:00:40.320> under<00:00:41.040> his<00:00:41.190> own<00:00:41.340> curse<00:00:41.579> I

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
Keith is actually under his own curse I

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.430 
Keith is actually under his own curse I
mean<00:00:41.910> he<00:00:42.059> is<00:00:42.090> a<00:00:42.180> skeleton<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.870> fuck<00:00:43.020> sake<00:00:43.260> so

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
mean he is a skeleton the fuck sake so

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.650 
mean he is a skeleton the fuck sake so
he<00:00:43.559> can<00:00:43.739> probably<00:00:43.920> like<00:00:44.219> what<00:00:44.850> he<00:00:44.940> does<00:00:45.120> that

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
he can probably like what he does that

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.299 
he can probably like what he does that
he's<00:00:46.110> able<00:00:46.289> to<00:00:46.410> like<00:00:46.590> just<00:00:46.829> integrate<00:00:47.190> himself

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
he's able to like just integrate himself

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.819 
he's able to like just integrate himself
I'm<00:00:47.579> guessing<00:00:48.030> he<00:00:48.120> like<00:00:48.469> decomposes<00:00:49.469> his<00:00:49.620> own

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
I'm guessing he like decomposes his own

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.619 
I'm guessing he like decomposes his own
body<00:00:50.129> and<00:00:50.219> then<00:00:50.430> recomposes<00:00:51.270> it<00:00:51.390> with<00:00:51.510> his

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
body and then recomposes it with his

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.049 
body and then recomposes it with his
magic<00:00:52.050> I'm<00:00:52.170> guessing<00:00:52.620> like<00:00:52.670> stuff<00:00:53.670> like<00:00:53.850> that

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
magic I'm guessing like stuff like that

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.700 
magic I'm guessing like stuff like that
and<00:00:54.390> he's<00:00:54.629> controlling<00:00:55.020> you<00:00:55.170> know<00:00:55.230> Silver's

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
and he's controlling you know Silver's

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.470 
and he's controlling you know Silver's
body<00:00:55.949> with<00:00:56.190> this<00:00:56.430> and<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.879> eggs<00:00:57.030> chambers<00:00:57.390> I

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
body with this and the eggs chambers I

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.209 
body with this and the eggs chambers I
guess<00:00:57.780> with<00:00:57.930> that<00:00:57.960> he's<00:00:58.500> either<00:00:58.680> hasn't<00:00:59.129> got

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
guess with that he's either hasn't got

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.670 
guess with that he's either hasn't got
that<00:00:59.250> much<00:00:59.730> control<00:01:00.539> over<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:01.020> shoulder<00:01:01.469> like

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
that much control over the shoulder like

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.340 
that much control over the shoulder like
maybe<00:01:01.920> he<00:01:02.160> has<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:02.489> go<00:01:03.359> part<00:01:03.870> way<00:01:04.049> with<00:01:04.229> his

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
maybe he has to go part way with his

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.320 
maybe he has to go part way with his
magic<00:01:04.710> in<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:04.830> same<00:01:05.040> leg<00:01:05.309> or<00:01:05.489> directly<00:01:06.030> in<00:01:06.180> one

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
magic in the same leg or directly in one

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.030 
magic in the same leg or directly in one
key<00:01:06.570> you<00:01:06.840> know<00:01:06.990> just<00:01:07.229> don't<00:01:07.380> control<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.830> body

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
key you know just don't control the body

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.120 
key you know just don't control the body
something<00:01:08.820> like<00:01:09.060> that<00:01:09.210> or<00:01:09.420> maybe<00:01:09.600> like<00:01:10.130> after

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
something like that or maybe like after

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.649 
something like that or maybe like after
like<00:01:11.159> gray<00:01:11.580> form<00:01:11.909> or<00:01:12.090> something<00:01:12.360> maybe<00:01:12.510> like

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
like gray form or something maybe like

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.330 
like gray form or something maybe like
wouldn't<00:01:13.110> have<00:01:13.200> that<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.530> clutches<00:01:14.070> of<00:01:14.100> death

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
wouldn't have that the clutches of death

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.060 
wouldn't have that the clutches of death
maybe<00:01:14.640> that<00:01:15.080> Cree<00:01:16.080> will<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:16.619> stuff<00:01:16.770> like<00:01:16.890> that

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
maybe that Cree will and stuff like that

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.910 
maybe that Cree will and stuff like that
I<00:01:17.369> guess<00:01:17.850> it's<00:01:18.060> kind<00:01:18.210> of<00:01:18.240> like<00:01:18.420> in<00:01:18.810> Naruto<00:01:19.770> as

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
I guess it's kind of like in Naruto as

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.649 
I guess it's kind of like in Naruto as
well<00:01:20.159> when<00:01:20.369> you<00:01:20.490> get<00:01:20.640> see<00:01:20.909> like<00:01:21.390> everyone

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
well when you get see like everyone

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.600 
well when you get see like everyone
provides<00:01:22.080> or<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.500> Edit<00:01:22.740> and<00:01:22.979> say<00:01:23.189> maybe<00:01:23.430> it's

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
provides or the Edit and say maybe it's

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.070

like<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.880> first<00:01:24.119> thing<00:01:24.330> called<00:01:24.540> a<00:01:24.630> free<00:01:24.900> will

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
like the first thing called a free will

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.480 
like the first thing called a free will
something<00:01:25.380> but<00:01:25.680> then<00:01:25.830> they<00:01:25.920> can<00:01:26.100> have<00:01:26.250> their

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
something but then they can have their

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.310 
something but then they can have their
freewill<00:01:26.820> taken<00:01:27.180> away<00:01:27.750> from<00:01:27.810> them<00:01:28.110> I<00:01:28.259> don't

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
freewill taken away from them I don't

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.830
