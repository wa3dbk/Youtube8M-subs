 video you learn how to do here 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.950
 wonderful moon manicure with 

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:12.290
 gel polishes we will use came 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:17.070
 from the firm year 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:23.430
 ultra bond from the firm on the dead top and base 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:27.510
 from firm year and color blue tone 55 from 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.170
 but he and the white tone 24 from the firm walks on 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.390
 races 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.460
 for a start, carefully cut the nail 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:36.000
 plates will press it in order 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.480
 to remove excess sebum moisture 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.399
 and and nakupalis nail plate 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.860
 Next, cover the nail plate in the morning 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.079
 gundam possible to cover both still in 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.489
 the area well do you watch the tip 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.180
 to 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:53.969
 Ultra bond didnâ€™t run on the side roller and 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.270
 under the cuticle now it's time to apply 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.970
 base base need 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:01.310
 no one kim layer because it was he 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:03.860
 eyes depend hands gel polish will 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:07.409
 filmed and of course the thick layer where 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:11.130
 harder to dissolve than thin 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:14.399
 and, in principle, mainly base function 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:17.789
 only creaks on steve plate and colors 

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:25.679
 for there is gel polish half - planets 

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:28.349
 Sock further the most interesting for lune 

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:30.689
 I chose white color which means on it 

00:01:28.349 --> 00:01:33.119
 stage i will cover the intended 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:36.979
 lune square white lacquered code 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.979
 resembles color 24 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:43.009
 in order to make our bun sex thick 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:46.130
 saturated color without lumen to me 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:48.380
 will be sufficient to two layers of gel and nail polish 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.780
 you are guided by how much 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.890
 strong pigmented light that would 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.500
 you spent yourself 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.930
 and now we need a small 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:00.610
 piece of foil and Santa edges tassel 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.610
 to paint the market 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.810
 wet the gel polish 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.810
 and draw a smile 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:30.300
 if you find it difficult to draw a symmetrical 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.170
 and even smile from the first time put 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.330
 two dots 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.940
 first in the middle nails will become apples 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.440
 the highest point smile from the wind their 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.150
 put where the smile will be 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.790
 start and end 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.730
 now just connect their lines and 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.260
 paint over oil 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.420
 need to apply several layers would 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:51.030
 Illumination until nails remain 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.720
