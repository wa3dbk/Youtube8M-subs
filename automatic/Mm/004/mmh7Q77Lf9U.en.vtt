I'm also going to draw the bottom so we

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:38.080 
I'm also going to draw the bottom so we
come<00:01:33.110> up<00:01:33.289> and<00:01:33.640> we<00:01:34.640> drawing<00:01:35.060> the<00:01:35.330> nose<00:01:36.909> and<00:01:37.909> we

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:53.520 

then<00:01:47.020> we<00:01:47.200> draw<00:01:48.990> bottom<00:01:49.990> of<00:01:50.110> the<00:01:50.200> gin<00:01:52.290> we<00:01:53.290> come

then we draw bottom of the gin we come

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.600 
then we draw bottom of the gin we come
down<00:01:55.170> or<00:01:56.170> chiseled<00:01:56.590> chin<00:01:56.890> I'm<00:01:57.040> going<00:01:57.250> to<00:01:57.400> draw

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
down or chiseled chin I'm going to draw

down or chiseled chin I'm going to draw
here<00:01:58.229> you<00:01:59.229> might<00:01:59.440> find<00:01:59.740> it<00:01:59.890> helpful<00:02:00.040> to

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
here you might find it helpful to

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.100 
here you might find it helpful to
actually<00:02:00.549> draw<00:02:00.970> the<00:02:01.030> whole<00:02:01.330> nose<00:02:01.600> in<00:02:01.900> like

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
actually draw the whole nose in like

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:03.540 
actually draw the whole nose in like
this<00:02:02.350> so<00:02:02.560> you<00:02:02.680> can<00:02:02.740> see<00:02:03.009> you've<00:02:03.159> got<00:02:03.190> it

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:03.550 
this so you can see you've got it

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:05.460 
this so you can see you've got it
roughly<00:02:03.940> in<00:02:04.119> the<00:02:04.210> right<00:02:04.390> position<00:02:04.930> you<00:02:05.350> can

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
roughly in the right position you can

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:06.840 
roughly in the right position you can
always<00:02:05.619> rub<00:02:05.920> it<00:02:06.040> out<00:02:06.190> at<00:02:06.399> a<00:02:06.430> later<00:02:06.670> stage

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
always rub it out at a later stage

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.779 
always rub it out at a later stage
that's<00:02:07.270> not<00:02:07.450> a<00:02:07.479> problem<00:02:07.800> then<00:02:08.800> we<00:02:08.830> draw<00:02:09.280> the

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
that's not a problem then we draw the

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:14.370 
that's not a problem then we draw the
other<00:02:09.970> eye<00:02:10.090> in<00:02:11.520> and<00:02:12.520> because<00:02:13.420> her<00:02:13.900> head<00:02:14.170> is

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
other eye in and because her head is

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.720 
other eye in and because her head is
tilted<00:02:14.830> this<00:02:15.520> way<00:02:15.750> the<00:02:16.750> ear<00:02:17.310> is<00:02:18.310> actually

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
tilted this way the ear is actually

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.770 
tilted this way the ear is actually
going<00:02:18.910> to<00:02:19.090> be<00:02:19.209> about<00:02:19.950> here<00:02:21.420> such<00:02:22.420> as<00:02:22.570> draw<00:02:22.750> a

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
going to be about here such as draw a

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.560 
going to be about here such as draw a
shape<00:02:23.080> like<00:02:23.290> that<00:02:23.560> for<00:02:23.830> the<00:02:23.920> ear<00:02:24.360> you<00:02:25.360> can

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
shape like that for the ear you can

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:27.840 
shape like that for the ear you can
indicate<00:02:26.140> the<00:02:26.560> back<00:02:26.739> of<00:02:26.890> the<00:02:26.980> head<00:02:27.190> need<00:02:27.730> to

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
indicate the back of the head need to

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:29.610 
indicate the back of the head need to
draw<00:02:28.030> him<00:02:28.239> in<00:02:28.360> a<00:02:28.450> bit<00:02:28.600> more<00:02:28.780> unique<00:02:29.260> you<00:02:29.470> would

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
draw him in a bit more unique you would

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.410 
draw him in a bit more unique you would
see<00:02:29.830> because<00:02:30.130> he's<00:02:30.340> tilted<00:02:30.820> this<00:02:31.060> way

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
see because he's tilted this way

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.740 
see because he's tilted this way
you<00:02:32.170> would<00:02:32.320> actually<00:02:32.440> see<00:02:32.680> underneath<00:02:33.750> the

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
you would actually see underneath the

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:40.830 
you would actually see underneath the
chin<00:02:35.280> just<00:02:36.280> here<00:02:37.080> and<00:02:38.850> the<00:02:39.850> ear<00:02:40.060> would<00:02:40.660> be

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
chin just here and the ear would be

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.920 
chin just here and the ear would be
about<00:02:42.060> approximately<00:02:43.060> there<00:02:43.269> I<00:02:43.480> might<00:02:43.720> bring

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
about approximately there I might bring
