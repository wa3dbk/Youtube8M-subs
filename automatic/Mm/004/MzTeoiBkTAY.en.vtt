00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.639 
into random generated number and if we
pick<00:00:32.940> out<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.239> number<00:00:33.480> 30<00:00:33.870> will<00:00:34.170> say<00:00:34.350> we'll<00:00:34.530> go

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
pick out the number 30 will say we'll go

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.280 
pick out the number 30 will say we'll go
to<00:00:34.710> along<00:00:35.399> because<00:00:35.820> it's<00:00:36.149> 10<00:00:36.390> each<00:00:36.600> page<00:00:36.930> and
