 hello everyone with you andrey channel review 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.830
 foreign goods 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:25.650
 Today I want to tell you about 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.919
 small but very useful things when 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:31.890
 here you can help 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:34.649
 measure the actual capacity of your batteries 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.149
 phones and floors banks as well 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:40.469
 determine the quality of your chargers 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.100
 devices and cables to them and so the first 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.450
 device 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:48.540
 Here is such a blue charger doctor 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:52.940
 transfixed by three and a half to seven 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:55.920
 Volt and amperage from 0 to 3 amps 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.750
 primitive simple device 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.110
 help him you can determine 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:05.659
 the quality of your charger and a 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:09.960
 also cord 2 devices are already over 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:13.079
 advanced with it you can 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.240
 also determine the quality of the charger 

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:17.549
 devices and cord and also measure 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.340
 real battery capacity power bank of 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:23.820
 mobile phones mp3 players h-what 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:27.000
 has usb output characteristics given 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:31.770
 devices following 1 current from 3 to 7 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:35.460
 Volt from 50 mm to three and a half amps 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.000
 hours output current is the same for 3 s 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.229
 by half 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:44.130
 ampere hours capacity from 0 to 19999 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:46.140
 amp clock made in china so let's 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.689
 now I will show you how to use 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:52.979
 data devices and tell you how 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:55.260
 measure the quality of cords and charge for 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.930
 order to check we need 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:04.920
 Charger 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:12.280
 unit we plug it in charger and here 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:18.980
 usb cable further this whole thing we 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:20.450
 socket and how the phone and now showed how 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:24.110
 will come out charger now this 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.549
 518 10 tail and charging immediately goes 0 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.190
 amp because we have nothing that 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:30.560
 There were no loads so 0 show 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.540
 when you connect phone mp3 player 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:43.129
 or tablet will be issued 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:46.730
 appropriate readings is a charger 

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:53.260
 the device works in a similar way and the lace 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:03:01.310
 we plug in the charger and 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:03:04.549
 cable back and here it is the phone and here 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:08.170
 as we see more information here 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:11.930
 in detail and here this voltage is displayed 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:16.040
 voltage should be between 4.9 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:18.799
 volts to 5 and 3 volts if more or 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:23.919
 less sign is not good this is the current strength with 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:26.510
 which charge this capacity is 0 this 

00:03:23.919 --> 00:03:29.480
 memory cells this device can 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:32.900
 keep yourself up to 10 your testimony 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:35.269
 metering which is very convenient you 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.340
 can see at any moment that you are 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:39.650
 measured to switch between 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:43.790
 cells need to double click on this 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:46.129
 button and stand and press down and then 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:52.310
 just thought we hold here first 

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:54.790
 trophy to 2 boxes 3 see them stored 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:56.409
 all measurements 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:00.560
 to erase 

00:03:56.409 --> 00:04:01.090
 your measurements you need here for example you want 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.129
 wipe off 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:07.069
 measuring 6 boxes here you need to be 

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:08.479
 go to the fifth bloodhound and click and 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:12.340
 hold this button 

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:12.340
 somewhere we press 5 seconds 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:17.329
 here you skip that cell and 

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:19.940
 her testimony is so confused 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:23.510
 happens erasing evidence on this 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:25.190
 device using this 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:27.020
 devices 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:30.800
 You can also check the charger 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:33.020
 device which wire is immediately building 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.950
 like this we see 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:39.340
 Yusbi my connector is not there, it is immediately arranged 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:49.370
 charger before we need 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:52.280
 perform the following actions connector from 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:55.060
 This charger is connected with 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:55.060
 back side 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:58.270
 tester 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:09.010
 that's hooked 

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:13.910
 further charging 

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:19.910
 then from the reverse side we output the cable 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:21.610
 charger socket and cable into 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:26.240
 phone and so here we can check 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:29.150
 the quality of such a charger as 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:32.120
 see all pretty easy 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:35.120
 This device will be useful because 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:37.150
 that on aliexpress is very much 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:40.520
 not sold as a charger 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:42.949
 cables to them and also fake power 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:45.080
 bank of using this device you 

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:48.070
 can replace the container and if anything happens 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:50.330
 open a dispute start matching goods 

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:54.160
 With this device you can 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:57.470
 just check the quality and usb cable and 

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:59.229
 charger cost this one 

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:01.789
 more simple blue 

00:05:59.229 --> 00:06:03.979
 the device varies from one to two 

00:06:01.789 --> 00:06:07.010
 dollars the cost of this 

00:06:03.979 --> 00:06:09.349
 more advanced varies from 

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:12.860
 four and a half to seven dollars 

00:06:09.349 --> 00:06:15.349
 I do not see some difference, so I 

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:18.160
 leave the link the most attractive 

00:06:15.349 --> 00:06:21.110
 at the cost of this gadget 

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:24.169
 Thank you all for watching the video.
