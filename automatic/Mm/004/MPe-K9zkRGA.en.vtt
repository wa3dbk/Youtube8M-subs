00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
were given we could actually playback

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.450 
were given we could actually playback
videos<00:01:45.299> at<00:01:45.540> several<00:01:45.930> different<00:01:45.960> speeds<00:01:46.710> in

the actual file one thing we really
liked<00:01:53.640> about<00:01:53.790> this<00:01:54.180> camera<00:01:54.630> was<00:01:55.049> that<00:01:55.350> we<00:01:55.530> had

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
liked about this camera was that we had

the ability to optically zoom in video

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.240 
the ability to optically zoom in video
mode<00:02:00.180> and<00:02:00.360> that's<00:02:00.479> a<00:02:00.659> 14<00:02:01.110> X<00:02:01.350> optical<00:02:01.590> zoom<00:02:01.890> in

mode and that's a 14 X optical zoom in
video<00:02:02.549> mode<00:02:02.930> the<00:02:03.930> only<00:02:04.290> thing<00:02:04.469> we<00:02:04.590> did<00:02:04.799> notice

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
video mode the only thing we did notice

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.690 
video mode the only thing we did notice
was<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:07.079> sound<00:02:07.860> of<00:02:08.099> the

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
actual the optical motor while we were

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:15.259 
actual the optical motor while we were
zooming<00:02:12.090> in<00:02:12.450> but<00:02:13.140> it's<00:02:14.040> very<00:02:14.489> very<00:02:14.970> quiet

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:15.269
