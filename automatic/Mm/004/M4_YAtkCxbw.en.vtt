00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.080
 Forgive Tino 

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:06.400
 And that does not just mean Ninja celebrates inviting and droppings but also for sports 

00:00:06.399 --> 00:00:09.700
 Tourers such as k 1200 guests or Fehse 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:15.319
 In the endurance test the Bridgestone was only 16 years old 

00:00:15.319 --> 00:00:18.730
 felt thoroughly and very intensely on the tooth 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:21.909
 he had to drive off during a nonstop ride 

00:00:21.909 --> 00:00:26.479
 Signs how tough he is in the south of Spain and he had to after that 

00:00:26.479 --> 00:00:30.489
 The racetrack prove that you can go on heavy tours with athletes 

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:32.790
 can live with the ambitions 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:33.710
 and even 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.710
 but a journey of more than 3000 kilometers 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.400
 Gospel we are at the press presentation of the new Eurosport 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.330
 Tire Bartl Achstetten and God's 16 now have two days occasion guests on 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.080
 The racetrack today will be overland tires on various engine then too 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.720
 test 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.100
 by his first impression 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.600
 As a first impression was relatively good especially the feedback from 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.859
 Another good 

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:26.720
 the difference to 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.720
 even though it definitely wants first place 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:32.560
 Feedback would be carried out 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.260
 to become front and rear wheel 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.670
 Round of exhibitions is definitely lower I think you have to 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.260
 bit up 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.550
 in one on the motorcycles pro Cologne 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.380
 Percent what machines are 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.700
 These are, for example, machines we use on the race track 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.440
 can be moved around the whole day and endure that 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.290
 that means they need a corresponding tire 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:01.210
 who also covers a particularly wide range of applications and is 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.100
 It's not just a race track, we also have to live on the highway or have to 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.770
 go at least to the racetrack and also there must work under 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.959
 all the conditions you can imagine 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:14.819
 dryness 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:15.819
 cold 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:20.969
 that must all work if under the riders Strasbourg has tires 

00:02:20.969 --> 00:02:21.769
 he too 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:24.989
 Regener 16 yesterday on the race track Herborn works 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:29.159
 more formally predecessor than the government's kind of formal predecessor but that 

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:30.559
 Ban is relied on 

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:34.699
 Here on the racetrack will be a great stable 

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:37.349
 displace and extremely predictable 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:39.320
 this test showed very clearly 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:43.130
 Beijing is the lucky fort with the only 16 bed a significant improvement 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:48.319
 compared to the also very good and popular Peking 05 10 has succeeded 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:52.209
 the occasionally criticized durability of the fictitious interest rate is 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:54.929
 his successor is no longer an issue 

00:02:54.929 --> 00:02:57.929
 the lack of feedback to the driver as well 

00:02:58.509 --> 00:03:03.289
 with the b-team only 16 to Fritz Stoll clearly an outstanding sports tire 

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:05.239
 successful 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:09.079
 Also, some Motor Corp called drivers such as the reigning world champion 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:13.400
 Casey Stoner or Ducati newcomer Marko Men at War 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:14.889
 could not take it 

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:19.259
 directly from the first wm-run in Cartagena the remains La Frontera fly 

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:25.249
 they played a major role in the development of the game - 16 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:27.079
 The technique comes after all 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:31.510
 Various films have always called to boost the development of laboratories 

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:34.949
 Steffen Hofmann from the 15th 

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:38.029
 on standard type airport 

00:03:38.029 --> 00:03:39.579
 58 58 

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:44.529
 could be the world champion Casey Stoner Marco Melandri and Anthony West of the 

00:03:44.529 --> 00:03:48.659
 Road qualities are now uncertain when tires convince themselves 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:54.159
 Although, for once, there was no trophy for these racetracks 

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:56.279
 or earn points 

00:03:56.279 --> 00:03:57.659
 Neeson is the stars 

00:03:57.659 --> 00:03:59.670
 as these pictures impressively prove 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:03.169
 anything but comfortable 

00:04:03.169 --> 00:04:07.729
 on a small private pension for the cautious brakes visitors 

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:11.459
 the thoroughbred racers also wanted to be in the show for the press despite the 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:14.459
 unfamiliar scenery machines absolute abandonment 

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:19.729
 especially blatant is without and Marco Melandri the mood is very too 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:20.500
 enjoy 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.140
 without having to sound pressure victories or good placements 

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:27.280
 relaxed to kick some points on the long haul 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:29.660
 true to the motto 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:32.660
 I just want to play I TU Dortmund 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:37.180
 even after these very fierce points among the best racers in the world 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.440
 shown that the criticism is now 16 15 good condition 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:45.050
 where you can assume the dominant team 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:49.219
 especially the middle tires as well as the rank six draws 

00:04:49.219 --> 00:04:52.939
 the next call charged the two ducati factory drivers 

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:55.349
 are largely foreign 

00:04:55.349 --> 00:04:59.110
 Naturally, there were also very popular autographs of the DAX in the desert 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:03.530
 whether on caps under motorcycle parts of the world champion and his colleagues 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:06.530
 presented themselves without airs and very satisfied 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:13.630
 Casey Stoner 

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:16.090
 the BC only 16 works brilliantly 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:21.050
 he is an evolution evolved from the bag of studded tires of Mutu Tebbe 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:24.150
 actually he should arrive to the guests 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:28.290
 we take Â«Today I thought about the ride with this bike and the new one 

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:32.280
 bridgestone tires that love motor baby a good school for the 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.659
 Development of road tires St 

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:38.370
 he stays it was the first time I with a road tire on the 

00:05:38.369 --> 00:05:40.349
 Racetrack had the same feeling 

00:05:40.349 --> 00:05:43.559
 who with a tearful a real Sedlak b 

00:05:43.559 --> 00:05:47.129
 I think it's a big step for safety, too 

00:05:48.249 --> 00:05:49.470
 Anthony West 

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:53.430
 it is nice that we are characterized by our whole test work and that 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:57.380
 Getting it over a tire can work it up to excellently 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.400
 while 

00:06:07.749 --> 00:06:08.740
 Ing 

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:12.680
 Loris Capirossi are my first impression is very good 

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:17.060
 I am really impressed. Think this is the first time this is due to the 

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:20.860
 Roads ripping users he felt so familiar I think 

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:24.440
 Bridgestone did a really good job BZ 

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:29.439
 enthusiastic racers impressed media representatives and a completely 

00:06:29.439 --> 00:06:31.620
 convince the long distance test 

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:35.630
 With the b-team only 16, Bridgestone is actually another big one 

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:38.539
 Succeeded in stepping towards race tires for the road
