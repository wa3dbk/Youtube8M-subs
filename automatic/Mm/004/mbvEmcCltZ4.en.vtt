for Newtown but she's young she's 18 and

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.240 
for Newtown but she's young she's 18 and
she<00:02:04.259> is<00:02:04.380> learnings<00:02:04.860> and

she is learnings and

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.920 
she is learnings and

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
yeah I think it's really hard as a

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.610 
yeah I think it's really hard as a
viewer<00:02:10.890> sometimes<00:02:11.460> to<00:02:11.700> get<00:02:11.970> the<00:02:12.210> right

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
viewer sometimes to get the right

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.930 
viewer sometimes to get the right
perception<00:02:13.620> of<00:02:13.710> people<00:02:13.920> because<00:02:14.700> it's<00:02:14.880> so

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
perception of people because it's so

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.240 
perception of people because it's so
heavily<00:02:15.450> edited<00:02:15.720> it<00:02:16.140> is<00:02:16.260> quite<00:02:16.560> hard<00:02:16.770> just<00:02:17.040> to
