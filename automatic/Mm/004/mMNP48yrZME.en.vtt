rather than to give them something they
didn't<00:01:46.680> want<00:01:46.890> will<00:01:47.130> never<00:01:47.520> use<00:01:48.030> I<00:01:48.479> went<00:01:48.750> the

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
didn't want will never use I went the

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.670 
didn't want will never use I went the

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
works quite well for example I give them

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.620 
works quite well for example I give them

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
this because that means something that's

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.050 
this because that means something that's
broken<00:02:18.940> down<00:02:19.500> or<00:02:20.500> perhaps<00:02:21.460> I'll<00:02:21.790> give<00:02:21.970> them
