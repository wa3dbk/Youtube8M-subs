incredibly loyal group of alumni and I

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:24.779 
incredibly loyal group of alumni and I
think<00:04:22.840> part<00:04:23.080> of<00:04:23.139> the<00:04:23.229> reason<00:04:23.259> is<00:04:23.770> that<00:04:24.370> the<00:04:24.610> law

00:04:24.779 --> 00:04:24.789 
think part of the reason is that the law

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:27.029 
think part of the reason is that the law
faculty<00:04:25.120> are<00:04:25.569> deeply<00:04:25.960> invested<00:04:26.229> in<00:04:26.529> the

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
success and well-being of law students

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.830 
success and well-being of law students
