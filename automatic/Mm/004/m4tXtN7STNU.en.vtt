something like that that is an
explanation<00:02:25.630> luckily<00:02:26.630> in<00:02:26.750> Jane's<00:02:27.050> case<00:02:27.380> we

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
explanation luckily in Jane's case we

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.440 
explanation luckily in Jane's case we
didn't<00:02:27.860> see<00:02:28.010> that<00:02:28.040> really<00:02:28.970> more<00:02:29.150> the<00:02:29.269> other

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
didn't see that really more the other

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.320 
didn't see that really more the other
two<00:02:29.720> problems<00:02:29.989> so<00:02:30.709> what<00:02:30.920> is<00:02:31.069> the<00:02:31.430> solution<00:02:31.640> for

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
two problems so what is the solution for

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.140 
two problems so what is the solution for
Jane's<00:02:33.250> situation<00:02:34.250> to<00:02:34.519> understand<00:02:35.030> the

Jane's situation to understand the

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.580 
Jane's situation to understand the

solution you have to understand the
problem<00:02:37.040> a<00:02:37.130> little<00:02:37.430> bit<00:02:37.580> better<00:02:37.790> essentially

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
problem a little bit better essentially

problem a little bit better essentially
what<00:02:38.870> we're<00:02:38.989> looking<00:02:39.260> at<00:02:39.380> with<00:02:39.500> post<00:02:39.709> nasal

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
what we're looking at with post nasal

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.280 
what we're looking at with post nasal
drip<00:02:40.100> for<00:02:40.489> example<00:02:40.940> is<00:02:41.330> mucus<00:02:41.780> dripping<00:02:42.200> from

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
drip for example is mucus dripping from

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.320 
drip for example is mucus dripping from
the<00:02:42.440> back<00:02:42.620> of<00:02:42.799> your<00:02:42.920> nose<00:02:43.160> into<00:02:43.489> your<00:02:43.910> throat

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
the back of your nose into your throat

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:45.820 
the back of your nose into your throat
and<00:02:44.510> we<00:02:44.600> have<00:02:44.720> a<00:02:44.750> really<00:02:44.930> nice<00:02:45.170> demonstration

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
and we have a really nice demonstration

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:47.500 
and we have a really nice demonstration
of<00:02:45.950> that<00:02:46.100> here<00:02:46.400> if<00:02:46.519> you're<00:02:47.030> looking<00:02:47.299> at<00:02:47.420> the

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
of that here if you're looking at the

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.509 
of that here if you're looking at the
back<00:02:47.660> of<00:02:47.690> the<00:02:47.930> nose<00:02:48.110> here<00:02:48.620> you<00:02:48.769> can<00:02:48.980> see<00:02:49.190> how

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:49.519 
back of the nose here you can see how

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:51.820 
back of the nose here you can see how
it's<00:02:50.090> a<00:02:50.239> straight<00:02:50.630> shot<00:02:50.959> to<00:02:51.230> go<00:02:51.410> from<00:02:51.590> the<00:02:51.650> back

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830 
it's a straight shot to go from the back

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:53.860 
it's a straight shot to go from the back
of<00:02:52.040> the<00:02:52.100> nose<00:02:52.310> down<00:02:52.910> into<00:02:53.239> the<00:02:53.360> throat<00:02:53.660> and

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
of the nose down into the throat and

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.750 
of the nose down into the throat and
when<00:02:54.260> it<00:02:54.350> lands<00:02:54.650> there<00:02:55.010> if<00:02:55.220> you<00:02:55.340> imagine<00:02:55.670> that

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
when it lands there if you imagine that

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.509 
when it lands there if you imagine that
this<00:02:55.910> is<00:02:55.970> your<00:02:56.299> throat<00:02:56.660> over<00:02:56.989> here<00:02:57.519> normally

00:02:58.509 --> 00:02:58.519 
this is your throat over here normally

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:00.460 
this is your throat over here normally
we<00:02:58.790> have<00:02:58.819> mucus<00:02:59.420> that<00:02:59.450> goes<00:02:59.720> down<00:02:59.930> our<00:03:00.140> throats

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
we have mucus that goes down our throats

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.849 
we have mucus that goes down our throats
all<00:03:00.709> day<00:03:01.070> long<00:03:01.280> thin<00:03:02.030> clear<00:03:02.780> easy<00:03:03.350> to<00:03:03.530> swallow

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:03.859 
all day long thin clear easy to swallow

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:05.680 
all day long thin clear easy to swallow
so<00:03:04.459> it's<00:03:04.579> going<00:03:04.700> to<00:03:04.790> look<00:03:04.910> a<00:03:05.060> lot<00:03:05.209> like<00:03:05.269> this

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
so it's going to look a lot like this

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.140 
so it's going to look a lot like this
just<00:03:06.440> dripping<00:03:06.680> straight<00:03:07.190> down<00:03:07.459> no

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
just dripping straight down no

nasal<00:03:10.940> drip<00:03:11.150> is<00:03:11.450> a<00:03:11.480> different<00:03:11.870> problem

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
nasal drip is a different problem

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.819 
nasal drip is a different problem

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
mucus more viscous more thick so instead

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.530 
mucus more viscous more thick so instead
of<00:03:18.530> pouring<00:03:18.829> right<00:03:19.070> through<00:03:19.519> it<00:03:20.030> actually

of pouring right through it actually
gets<00:03:20.720> stuck<00:03:21.109> and<00:03:21.410> you<00:03:22.160> see<00:03:22.340> this<00:03:22.489> really<00:03:22.700> goopy

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
gets stuck and you see this really goopy

stuff that is goopy it is and it just

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:27.729 
stuff that is goopy it is and it just
sits<00:03:26.000> right<00:03:26.090> there<00:03:26.269> on<00:03:26.540> the<00:03:26.630> throat<00:03:26.930> you<00:03:27.440> feel

sits right there on the throat you feel

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:30.220 
sits right there on the throat you feel
that<00:03:27.950> your<00:03:28.220> brain<00:03:28.489> perceives<00:03:28.940> it<00:03:29.209> what<00:03:29.480> makes

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
that your brain perceives it what makes

that your brain perceives it what makes
you<00:03:30.410> want<00:03:30.620> to<00:03:30.739> clear<00:03:30.950> your<00:03:31.100> throat<00:03:31.430> exactly

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
you want to clear your throat exactly

you want to clear your throat exactly
the<00:03:32.630> other<00:03:33.049> thing<00:03:33.410> that<00:03:33.650> we<00:03:33.890> had<00:03:34.010> talked<00:03:34.280> about

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
the other thing that we had talked about

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:37.840 
the other thing that we had talked about
was<00:03:35.359> acid<00:03:35.780> reflux<00:03:36.230> and<00:03:36.470> that<00:03:36.799> specifically<00:03:37.609> is

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:37.850 
was acid reflux and that specifically is

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:40.180 
was acid reflux and that specifically is
when<00:03:38.090> acid<00:03:38.450> from<00:03:38.600> your<00:03:38.750> stomach<00:03:39.049> can't<00:03:39.920> stay

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
when acid from your stomach can't stay

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.580 
when acid from your stomach can't stay
down<00:03:40.430> and<00:03:40.670> so<00:03:41.359> gravity<00:03:41.780> normally<00:03:42.290> when<00:03:42.410> we're

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
down and so gravity normally when we're

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.410 
down and so gravity normally when we're
walking<00:03:42.950> around<00:03:43.069> keeps<00:03:43.760> everything<00:03:44.239> down

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 
walking around keeps everything down

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.740 
walking around keeps everything down
south'<00:03:44.810> as<00:03:45.380> soon<00:03:45.590> as<00:03:45.739> we<00:03:45.859> lay<00:03:46.069> down<00:03:46.280> at<00:03:46.489> night

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
south' as soon as we lay down at night

south' as soon as we lay down at night
gravity<00:03:47.750> isn't<00:03:47.900> working<00:03:48.170> in<00:03:48.260> our<00:03:48.380> favor

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 
gravity isn't working in our favor

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:50.590 
gravity isn't working in our favor
anymore<00:03:49.130> as<00:03:49.370> it<00:03:49.700> just<00:03:49.819> pops<00:03:50.090> right<00:03:50.239> back<00:03:50.390> up

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:50.600 
anymore as it just pops right back up
