I<00:04:42.340> think<00:04:42.640> Capitol<00:04:43.120> Corridor<00:04:43.479> helps<00:04:44.080> the

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:44.200 
I think Capitol Corridor helps the

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:48.060 
I think Capitol Corridor helps the
environment<00:04:44.350> by<00:04:46.110> obviously<00:04:47.110> less<00:04:47.320> less<00:04:47.710> fuels

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.070 
environment by obviously less less fuels

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:50.820 
environment by obviously less less fuels
and<00:04:48.340> emissions<00:04:48.930> less<00:04:49.930> people<00:04:50.200> on<00:04:50.440> the<00:04:50.590> road

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
and emissions less people on the road

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:51.750 
and emissions less people on the road
it's<00:04:51.340> just

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:51.760 
it's just

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:52.670 
it's just
absolutely

big difference in the emissions and

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:40.490 
big difference in the emissions and
