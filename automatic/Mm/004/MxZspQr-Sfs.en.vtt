00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
wolf so you know much like when you

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.219 
wolf so you know much like when you
fought<00:01:08.850> King<00:01:09.090> Hippo<00:01:09.299> you<00:01:09.570> need<00:01:09.689> to<00:01:09.780> notice<00:01:10.110> his

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
patterns in the correct time originally

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:15.770 
patterns in the correct time originally
we<00:01:14.970> played<00:01:15.150> around<00:01:15.330> with<00:01:15.420> a<00:01:15.540> bunch<00:01:15.659> of

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
we played around with a bunch of

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.600 
we played around with a bunch of
different<00:01:15.869> control<00:01:16.350> schemes<00:01:16.380> for<00:01:16.830> it<00:01:16.979> but<00:01:17.159> one

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
different control schemes for it but one

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:18.980 
different control schemes for it but one
of<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.790> goals<00:01:18.030> for<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.299> game<00:01:18.450> is<00:01:18.600> they<00:01:18.750> like

real pushes in the mystery is in the

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.950 
real pushes in the mystery is in the
exploration<00:01:25.920> is<00:01:26.369> in<00:01:26.520> know<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.509> like<00:01:27.810> the

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
exploration is in know the like the

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.920 
exploration is in know the like the
craziness<00:01:28.320> and<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.890> script<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:29.700> yeah<00:01:30.600> it's

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
craziness and the script and yeah it's

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.260 
craziness and the script and yeah it's
we<00:01:31.380> had<00:01:31.500> talked<00:01:31.680> earlier<00:01:32.040> about<00:01:32.100> this<00:01:32.430> but<00:01:32.759> it

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
we had talked earlier about this but it

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:56.819 
definitely inspired by that too but in a

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:59.749 
definitely inspired by that too but in a
weird<00:03:57.000> way<00:03:57.090> that<00:03:57.239> like<00:03:57.629> Commodore<00:03:58.500> 64<00:03:59.040> or<00:03:59.489> like

00:03:59.749 --> 00:03:59.759

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:06.719 
that's where we kind of got that

00:04:06.719 --> 00:04:09.649 
that's where we kind of got that
understanding<00:04:07.620> the<00:04:07.739> games<00:04:07.979> could<00:04:08.250> be<00:04:08.659> more

for you no iPhone and iOS development is
to<00:04:47.200> try<00:04:47.410> to<00:04:47.440> like<00:04:47.740> hopefully<00:04:48.310> at<00:04:48.820> least

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:48.850 
to try to like hopefully at least

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:50.670 
to try to like hopefully at least
partially<00:04:49.360> prove<00:04:49.810> out<00:04:49.930> the<00:04:50.110> idea<00:04:50.440> that<00:04:50.500> you

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680 
partially prove out the idea that you

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.460 
partially prove out the idea that you
can<00:04:50.830> make<00:04:51.070> weird<00:04:51.430> new<00:04:52.180> interesting<00:04:52.840> crap<00:04:53.110> it

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:53.470 
can make weird new interesting crap it

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:56.100 
can make weird new interesting crap it
doesn't<00:04:53.740> have<00:04:53.860> to<00:04:54.010> be<00:04:54.040> 99<00:04:54.580> cent<00:04:54.850> Arkady<00:04:55.210> and

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.110 
doesn't have to be 99 cent Arkady and

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:58.830 
doesn't have to be 99 cent Arkady and
hopefully<00:04:57.040> you<00:04:57.070> know<00:04:57.310> people<00:04:57.670> it'll<00:04:58.450> find<00:04:58.720> an

00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:58.840 
hopefully you know people it'll find an

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.260 
hopefully you know people it'll find an
audience<00:04:59.070> there<00:05:00.070> stairs<00:05:00.370> there<00:05:00.640> those<00:05:01.030> stairs

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:01.270
