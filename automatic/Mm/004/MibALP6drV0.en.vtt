00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:56.150 

and<00:05:51.080> the<00:05:52.080> printer<00:05:52.470> would<00:05:52.650> process<00:05:52.920> it<00:05:55.160> what

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:56.160 
and the printer would process it what

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.240 
and the printer would process it what
should<00:05:56.610> happen<00:05:56.880> is<00:05:57.360> that<00:05:58.290> this<00:05:58.530> light<00:05:58.800> over

00:05:59.240 --> 00:05:59.250 
should happen is that this light over

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:04.040 
should happen is that this light over
here<00:05:59.690> should<00:06:00.690> go<00:06:01.020> off<00:06:02.150> if<00:06:03.150> it<00:06:03.330> doesn't<00:06:03.720> go<00:06:03.840> off

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:04.050 
here should go off if it doesn't go off

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:06.950 
here should go off if it doesn't go off
that<00:06:04.950> means<00:06:05.250> that<00:06:05.670> you<00:06:06.090> either<00:06:06.300> replace<00:06:06.750> the
