00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
so we tell ourselves to give up or move

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.990 
so we tell ourselves to give up or move
on<00:00:44.210> but<00:00:45.210> really<00:00:45.860> those<00:00:46.860> dreams<00:00:47.370> that<00:00:47.969> you

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.500 
it's only when time is past and we

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.640 
it's only when time is past and we
looked<00:01:05.710> down<00:01:06.010> at<00:01:06.370> our<00:01:06.400> hands<00:01:07.440> see<00:01:08.440> the

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:08.650 
looked down at our hands see the

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:13.410 
looked down at our hands see the
wrinkles<00:01:09.479> see<00:01:10.479> yourselves<00:01:10.990> aged<00:01:12.270> that<00:01:13.270> we

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420 
wrinkles see yourselves aged that we

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.010 
wrinkles see yourselves aged that we
realize<00:01:13.840> time<00:01:14.590> is<00:01:14.650> running<00:01:15.280> out<00:01:15.840> we<00:01:16.840> can

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
realize time is running out we can

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.440 
realize time is running out we can
choose<00:01:17.380> to<00:01:17.770> continue<00:01:18.040> to<00:01:18.700> tuck<00:01:18.910> those<00:01:19.090> dreams

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
choose to continue to tuck those dreams

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.300 
choose to continue to tuck those dreams
away<00:01:20.490> or<00:01:21.570> we<00:01:22.570> can<00:01:22.750> decide<00:01:23.110> that<00:01:23.500> it's<00:01:23.950> time<00:01:24.070> to

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
away or we can decide that it's time to

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.070 
away or we can decide that it's time to
bring<00:01:24.700> them<00:01:24.880> out<00:01:25.060> and<00:01:25.330> into<00:01:25.780> the<00:01:25.930> sunlight

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
bring them out and into the sunlight

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.740 
bring them out and into the sunlight
even<00:01:29.080> if<00:01:29.200> they<00:01:29.380> can't<00:01:29.680> come<00:01:29.979> true<00:01:30.390> at<00:01:31.390> least

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
even if they can't come true at least

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.580 
even if they can't come true at least
see<00:01:32.350> within<00:01:32.560> yourself<00:01:33.159> but<00:01:33.820> you<00:01:33.970> tried<00:01:34.590> you
