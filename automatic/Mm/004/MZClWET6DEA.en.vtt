00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
kind of that little nucleus then when

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.490 
kind of that little nucleus then when
she<00:00:39.450> Connie's<00:00:39.600> got<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.840> same<00:00:40.020> way<00:00:40.170> you<00:00:40.230> know

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
she Connie's got the same way you know

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.290 
she Connie's got the same way you know
it's<00:00:40.620> like<00:00:40.680> from<00:00:40.890> Huntington<00:00:41.250> down<00:00:41.489> to<00:00:41.760> where

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
it's like from Huntington down to where

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.400 
it's like from Huntington down to where
we're<00:00:42.450> at<00:00:42.480> it's<00:00:42.750> like<00:00:42.840> there's<00:00:43.020> a<00:00:43.110> lot<00:00:43.260> of<00:00:43.290> good

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
we're at it's like there's a lot of good

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.990 
we're at it's like there's a lot of good
surfers<00:00:43.920> doing<00:00:44.190> a<00:00:44.250> lot<00:00:44.340> of<00:00:44.399> different<00:00:44.789> things

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
surfers doing a lot of different things

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.819 
surfers doing a lot of different things
it's<00:00:45.210> not<00:00:45.360> just<00:00:45.600> like<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:46.230> same<00:00:46.440> style<00:00:46.739> of

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
it's not just like the same style of

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.520 
it's not just like the same style of
surfer<00:00:47.160> so<00:00:47.340> I<00:00:47.550> don't<00:00:48.420> know<00:00:48.480> why<00:00:48.690> that<00:00:48.719> is<00:00:48.989> it's

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
surfer so I don't know why that is it's

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.229 
surfer so I don't know why that is it's
not<00:00:49.739> necessarily<00:00:50.430> that<00:00:50.579> there's<00:00:50.789> better

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
not necessarily that there's better

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.790 
not necessarily that there's better
waves<00:00:51.480> here<00:00:51.780> or<00:00:51.989> there<00:00:52.230> but<00:00:52.260> i<00:00:52.440> think<00:00:52.710> it<00:00:52.770> just

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
waves here or there but i think it just

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.639 
waves here or there but i think it just
it's<00:00:53.610> like<00:00:53.760> a<00:00:53.789> gauntlet<00:00:54.690> like<00:00:55.020> a<00:00:55.050> competitive

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
it's like a gauntlet like a competitive

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.020 
it's like a gauntlet like a competitive
little<00:00:55.890> area<00:00:56.219> where<00:00:56.399> everyone<00:00:56.670> just<00:00:56.820> wants<00:00:56.879> to

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
little area where everyone just wants to

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.120 
little area where everyone just wants to
outdo<00:00:57.180> each<00:00:57.300> other<00:00:57.539> or<00:00:57.840> something

00:00:59.120 --> 00:00:59.130 
outdo each other or something

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:01.970 
outdo each other or something
I<00:00:59.220> really<00:01:00.000> think<00:01:00.180> its<00:01:00.420> a<00:01:00.510> mix<00:01:00.720> of<00:01:00.990> of<00:01:01.200> the<00:01:01.740> waves

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
I really think its a mix of of the waves

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.070 
I really think its a mix of of the waves
that<00:01:02.220> we<00:01:02.370> do<00:01:02.550> get<00:01:02.790> there's<00:01:03.060> there's<00:01:03.420> quality

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
that we do get there's there's quality

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.200 
that we do get there's there's quality
and<00:01:04.380> quantity<00:01:04.680> and<00:01:05.130> all<00:01:05.489> different<00:01:05.790> you<00:01:06.090> know

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
and quantity and all different you know

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.870 
and quantity and all different you know
point<00:01:06.480> breaks<00:01:06.720> Beach<00:01:07.080> breaks<00:01:07.410> not<00:01:08.220> so<00:01:08.700> many

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
point breaks Beach breaks not so many

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.570 
point breaks Beach breaks not so many
reef<00:01:09.180> breaks<00:01:09.510> but<00:01:09.860> quality<00:01:10.860> point<00:01:11.070> breaks<00:01:11.340> and

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
reef breaks but quality point breaks and

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.350 
reef breaks but quality point breaks and
then<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:11.970> then<00:01:12.740> there's<00:01:13.740> you<00:01:14.610> know<00:01:14.640> we're<00:01:15.330> a

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360
