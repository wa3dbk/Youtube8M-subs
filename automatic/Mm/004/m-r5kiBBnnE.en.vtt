00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
direct link to the software is just and

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:23.960 
direct link to the software is just and
clits<00:00:22.890> so<00:00:22.949> you<00:00:23.070> can<00:00:23.189> just<00:00:23.220> click<00:00:23.519> on<00:00:23.640> it<00:00:23.789> and<00:00:23.820> it

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
will download the core temp software so

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.419 
will download the core temp software so
just<00:00:26.220> click<00:00:26.340> on<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.580> core<00:00:26.849> temp<00:00:27.090> link<00:00:28.429> and

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
just click on the core temp link and

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:30.830 
just click on the core temp link and
download<00:00:29.609> it<00:00:29.939> to<00:00:30.269> wherever<00:00:30.480> you<00:00:30.660> would<00:00:30.779> like

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
download it to wherever you would like

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.560 
download it to wherever you would like
then<00:00:31.769> click<00:00:32.040> on<00:00:32.189> it<00:00:32.369> and<00:00:32.520> install<00:00:33.420> the

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
then click on it and install the

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.049 
then click on it and install the
software<00:00:35.809> so<00:00:36.809> when<00:00:37.170> you<00:00:37.290> run<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.770> software<00:00:38.059> it

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
software so when you run the software it

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.959 
software so when you run the software it
may<00:00:39.210> take<00:00:39.239> a<00:00:39.420> few<00:00:39.540> minutes<00:00:39.960> low<00:00:40.370> start<00:00:41.370> to<00:00:41.790> load

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
may take a few minutes low start to load

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.069 
may take a few minutes low start to load
up<00:00:42.290> this<00:00:43.290> is<00:00:43.500> just<00:00:43.739> because<00:00:44.010> it's<00:00:44.129> a<00:00:45.079> open

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
up this is just because it's a open

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.299 
up this is just because it's a open
source<00:00:46.289> software<00:00:46.500> so<00:00:46.890> there's<00:00:47.039> many<00:00:47.160> things

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
source software so there's many things

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.940 
source software so there's many things
they<00:00:47.610> need<00:00:47.789> to<00:00:47.820> do<00:00:48.090> so<00:00:48.809> it's<00:00:48.930> kind<00:00:49.140> of<00:00:49.200> slow<00:00:49.500> so

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
they need to do so it's kind of slow so

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.250 
they need to do so it's kind of slow so
really<00:00:50.640> doesn't<00:00:50.879> affect<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.239> process<00:00:51.690> so<00:00:52.230> you

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
really doesn't affect the process so you

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.080 
really doesn't affect the process so you
can<00:00:52.440> just<00:00:52.469> go<00:00:52.710> through<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:52.980> settings<00:00:53.160> and

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
can just go through the settings and

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.299 
can just go through the settings and
install<00:00:54.690> it<00:00:54.719> I<00:00:55.050> usually<00:00:55.620> just<00:00:55.800> go<00:00:56.160> to<00:00:56.219> the

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
install it I usually just go to the

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.040 
install it I usually just go to the
standard<00:00:56.699> settings<00:00:57.090> not<00:00:57.539> much<00:00:57.690> you<00:00:57.719> need<00:00:57.960> to

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
standard settings not much you need to

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.979 
standard settings not much you need to
fix<00:00:58.280> you<00:00:59.280> can<00:00:59.460> go<00:00:59.760> to<00:00:59.820> custom<00:01:00.059> and<00:01:00.390> if<00:01:00.480> if<00:01:00.840> you

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
fix you can go to custom and if if you

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.299 
fix you can go to custom and if if you
don't<00:01:01.170> want<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.440> toolbars<00:01:01.800> you<00:01:01.920> can<00:01:02.039> remove

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
don't want the toolbars you can remove

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:03.729 
don't want the toolbars you can remove
them<00:01:02.460> but<00:01:02.640> I'm<00:01:02.699> just<00:01:02.850> going<00:01:03.000> to<00:01:03.030> go<00:01:03.120> to<00:01:03.180> express

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:03.739 
them but I'm just going to go to express

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:07.580 
them but I'm just going to go to express
accept<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:05.750> you<00:01:06.750> can<00:01:06.869> download<00:01:07.049> it<00:01:07.350> here

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
since i already downloaded its software

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.469 
since i already downloaded its software
i'm<00:01:09.720> just<00:01:09.930> going<00:01:10.080> to<00:01:10.200> cancel<00:01:10.830> this<00:01:11.330> click<00:01:12.330> x

the software you can lunch to launch the

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.700 
the software you can lunch to launch the
core<00:01:17.040> temps<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.820> software<00:01:18.330> and<00:01:19.170> you<00:01:19.350> can<00:01:19.530> view

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
core temps the software and you can view

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.510 
core temps the software and you can view
the<00:01:19.950> temperature<00:01:20.610> of<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:22.220> processor<00:01:23.220> since

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
the temperature of the processor since

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.969 
the temperature of the processor since
mine<00:01:24.000> I<00:01:24.210> have<00:01:24.450> my<00:01:24.659> processor<00:01:25.320> is<00:01:25.470> a<00:01:25.500> dual-core

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
mine I have my processor is a dual-core

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.700 
mine I have my processor is a dual-core
processor<00:01:26.640> with<00:01:26.759> four<00:01:27.000> threads<00:01:27.270> it<00:01:27.509> shows<00:01:28.140> the

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
processor with four threads it shows the

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.350 
processor with four threads it shows the
temperature<00:01:28.920> of<00:01:29.280> both<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.729> course<00:01:29.970> so<00:01:30.270> the

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
temperature of both the course so the

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.560 
temperature of both the course so the
first<00:01:30.600> core<00:01:30.810> is<00:01:30.930> 58<00:01:31.470> degrees<00:01:31.890> and<00:01:32.210> the<00:01:33.210> second

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
first core is 58 degrees and the second

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.679 
first core is 58 degrees and the second
core<00:01:33.750> is<00:01:33.930> 60<00:01:34.740> degrees<00:01:35.030> this<00:01:36.030> is<00:01:36.180> jumping<00:01:36.570> up

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
core is 60 degrees this is jumping up

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.030 
core is 60 degrees this is jumping up
and<00:01:36.810> down<00:01:36.960> because<00:01:37.380> I'm<00:01:37.740> actually<00:01:37.950> running<00:01:38.369> a

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 
and down because I'm actually running a

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.230 
and down because I'm actually running a
running<00:01:41.040> of<00:01:41.220> video<00:01:41.670> software<00:01:41.939> in<00:01:42.210> the

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
running of video software in the

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.690 
running of video software in the
background<00:01:42.780> so<00:01:43.110> this<00:01:43.649> is<00:01:43.860> how<00:01:43.979> I'm<00:01:44.130> recording

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
background so this is how I'm recording

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.819 
background so this is how I'm recording
the<00:01:45.509> video<00:01:45.630> right<00:01:45.899> now<00:01:45.960> so<00:01:46.259> this<00:01:46.380> is<00:01:46.560> why<00:01:46.770> it's

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
the video right now so this is why it's

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:51.410 
the video right now so this is why it's
jumping<00:01:47.640> up<00:01:47.700> and<00:01:47.790> down<00:01:47.880> a<00:01:47.970> lot<00:01:49.880> well<00:01:50.880> so<00:01:51.060> thank

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
jumping up and down a lot well so thank

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.149 
jumping up and down a lot well so thank
you<00:01:51.570> for<00:01:51.720> watching<00:01:52.079> and<00:01:52.229> please<00:01:52.439> leave<00:01:53.100> a

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159
