00:00:01.669 --> 00:00:06.150
 Speak there, guys. 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:06.810
 we're here again on Easy Mode channel 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.080
 huh 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:13.290
 I'm going to speak here very fast about 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:16.710
 the noise says there is no noise caused by 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:21.140
 mainly by the driver, not so much 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.140
 driver as the 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:26.550
 logical 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:29.099
 What happens is the following pedal 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:32.610
 losing drive alone already generates noise is 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.739
 everybody knows this but there are those 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:39.239
 moments you see that have a noise 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:44.219
 It's exaggerated then this is not normal and 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:46.370
 often those of exaggerated noise is 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:50.309
 power grid 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:52.590
 So what happened here at home ? 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.300
 He was rehearsing time of the collapsed UN 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:58.739
 It did not seem to be very unbearable at the moment. 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.730
 in the same church what is the 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:04.140
 people did 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:06.060
 based on the basic principle that you 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.750
 have a guitar that does not make noise 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:14.700
 unip cables that do not generate noise and source 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:16.470
 that does not generate noise is the people like me 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.320
 here at home as if turning off the 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:22.439
 appliances up to where I arrived in 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:27.060
 refrigerator refrigerator there it trigger 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:31.619
 engine and generated noise in my 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:34.770
 equipment in the church was an equipment 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:38.009
 I used to call the desk together, I do not know 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:42.810
 name now that the same thing happened 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:44.549
 he was noise in the net just went off 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:49.259
 these two equipment there the people 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:53.479
 discovered a glass in the noise decreased in 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:57.390
 a few moments until you get to 0 and 8 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:02:01.040
 then the tip is more from the 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:03.990
 principle that is the source cable guitar 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:06.329
 be in good condition as to leave 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.190
 it also generates noise so it does something 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.649
 picks up a borrowed guitar picks up 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.939
 borrowed 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:16.939
 To see if that's it, I have not got it yet. 

00:02:13.939 --> 00:02:20.239
 the case of an equipment by itself 

00:02:16.939 --> 00:02:22.480
 noise is excessive noise , right? 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:25.909
 We're talking about guede noise. 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:30.349
 excessive do not fly from the normal pedal 

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:34.700
 of course it has several other 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:36.980
 other things than us and such but 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.829
 Puerto Rico walnut pedal is very 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:42.829
 very much and it gets bad 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:44.989
 I bring Timbu is the pedal of us critter and 

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:46.819
 was not made to take ronchi give and 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:49.159
 was made to take to make a 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:52.209
 Fine adjustment however was not made 

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:55.159
 to take 100% of the noise with that 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:56.450
 shameless bastard in effect to make a 

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:59.659
 fine adjustment 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:02.290
 so stay the tip or give a jewel in is 

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:05.209
 Give me a clue too. Send me a tip. 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:07.010
 some experiences that you are 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:11.260
 passing and it worked right for us to 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:15.440
 help and here we do not have one is 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:20.599
 no intention of making money alone 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:24.910
 to exchange experience is also us 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:24.910
 Let's talk, hug.
