00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 poodle as I have more current 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.350
 stay with my gluten 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.990
 challenge gluten yes sorry people i say 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.059
 luton point out 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:13.710
 what is going on, what am I doing in the big one 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.839
 all I have to say I have now 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.970
 is now the second week so today 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.279
 is saturday 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.920
 I pulled everything through me 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.810
 had once 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.460
 Once I have something moderate to bake 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.000
 Eaten where a bit klute with it 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.070
 was 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.390
 what happened during the last week 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.040
 So I realized that the 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.489
 Digestive problems has constipation 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.620
 yes it has been more difficult 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.360
 i got a few megapixels i 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.530
 Do not know if you see it that way 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.590
 just in the camera 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.690
 So I want to be here is such a huge thing 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.100
 and here is a huge thing though 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.649
 I generally noticed that I 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.879
 the skin picture has improved yes that 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.399
 Skin picture has improved 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:56.430
 I still have the feeling that 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.920
 I'm a bit more active 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.510
 bit fitter and so it is me 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.250
 definitely noticed last two 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.930
 There were no other weeks 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.119
 changes would have influenced this 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.430
 that can all stay the same yes 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:12.470
 So just take him for a while 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.799
 the second week gluten free 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.119
 in the meantime short and 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.770
 digestive problems in the form of 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.600
 constipation yes that was really 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.600
 difficult to press 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:26.280
 So you know yes and the skin 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.450
 in itself has gotten better 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.960
 the skin is also in my opinion 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.119
 not quite as finished is the house 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.549
 has also given more pimples first 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.619
 I noticed this was more pimples 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.820
 meanwhile these little ones are wrapping 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.680
 Declined because for them a few more 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.360
 big you have to go on 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.570
 watch how that goes on 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:48.899
 behaves with the plane and so far 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.130
 actually positive I think ever 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.560
 after what the next two weeks 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.509
 I'll just bring gluten like that 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.110
 far goes down so yes I say 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.690
 By and large it is not 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.650
 big difference my oatmeal 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:04.890
 and thick flakes I have now 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:07.480
 exchanged for these and buckwheat 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.550
 and if I just think about it now 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:11.500
 whether I take the two things now or 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.990
 the two things for that I am good free 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.910
 also the rice milk has that harbor 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:19.560
 would like to go against it with a hard one 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:21.970
 Try it out yahoo it brings 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.260
 that is not a big sacrifice and now 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.490
 I say I 'm going to eat somewhere now 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.280
 or I 'm going to eat noodles or me 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:28.690
 first at home normal noodles yes then 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.800
 it's just that way so I find it yourself 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.930
 not bad now and it means 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.910
 for me now no waiver or 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.680
 a restriction one buys again 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.840
 just a few other things 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.130
 or is it all in the box and is 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.170
 thereby reducing just a bit 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.390
 Why can not but in real in 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.100
 Final conclusion is only in two weeks 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.480
 because I am technically through 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.920
 or continue with banana 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.470
 Iceland let's see if I think that by 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.970
 five days only bananas will then see 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.590
 In this sense I wish you everything 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.150
