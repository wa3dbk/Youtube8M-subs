though and the gun is so big it kind of

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:35.190 
though and the gun is so big it kind of
brings<00:03:32.920> him<00:03:33.130> down<00:03:33.160> but<00:03:34.120> still<00:03:34.360> looks<00:03:34.750> very

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.590

actually<00:03:39.160> does<00:03:39.340> go<00:03:39.460> in<00:03:39.730> the<00:03:39.880> side<00:03:40.060> of<00:03:40.120> it<00:03:40.390> I

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:40.600 
actually does go in the side of it I

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.840 
actually does go in the side of it I
think<00:03:41.080> it<00:03:41.530> gets<00:03:41.680> in<00:03:41.890> the<00:03:41.980> way<00:03:42.100> a<00:03:42.130> little<00:03:42.400> bit<00:03:42.520> so

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:42.850 
think it gets in the way a little bit so

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:45.240 
think it gets in the way a little bit so
I<00:03:42.880> don't<00:03:43.240> usually<00:03:43.420> use<00:03:43.810> it<00:03:44.050> but<00:03:44.590> it's<00:03:44.800> just<00:03:45.100> a

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
I don't usually use it but it's just a

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.290 
I don't usually use it but it's just a
very<00:03:45.790> nice<00:03:46.060> toy<00:03:46.420> all<00:03:46.720> in<00:03:46.900> all<00:03:47.050> it<00:03:47.590> does<00:03:47.950> come

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160 
just like the other one with its ampsuit

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.890 
just like the other one with its ampsuit
which<00:03:51.730> you<00:03:51.880> can<00:03:52.030> obviously<00:03:52.210> put<00:03:52.720> down<00:03:52.930> and

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900
