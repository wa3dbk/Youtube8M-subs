00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:12.639 
do is we turn off with the old switch

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:15.310 
do is we turn off with the old switch
all<00:00:13.639> I<00:00:13.700> keypad<00:00:14.269> here<00:00:14.510> we<00:00:14.719> select<00:00:14.870> the<00:00:15.110> length

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:15.320 
all I keypad here we select the length

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:20.160 
all I keypad here we select the length
of<00:00:15.530> paper<00:00:15.740> when<00:00:16.070> we<00:00:16.250> cut<00:00:16.430> an<00:00:16.490> a4<00:00:16.640> so<00:00:17.770> b-29<00:00:19.150> seven

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:20.170 
of paper when we cut an a4 so b-29 seven

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:25.060 
of paper when we cut an a4 so b-29 seven
what<00:00:21.170> we<00:00:21.260> do<00:00:21.410> that<00:00:21.529> is<00:00:21.650> push<00:00:21.859> value<00:00:23.650> the<00:00:24.650> resets

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:25.070 
what we do that is push value the resets

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:26.620 
what we do that is push value the resets
and<00:00:25.400> then<00:00:25.520> this<00:00:25.699> is<00:00:25.880> the<00:00:26.000> amount<00:00:26.180> tabs<00:00:26.480> are

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:26.630 
and then this is the amount tabs are

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.060 
and then this is the amount tabs are
going<00:00:26.779> to<00:00:26.840> cut<00:00:27.019> so<00:00:27.320> in<00:00:27.470> this<00:00:27.590> case<00:00:27.830> we're<00:00:27.980> going

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:28.070 
going to cut so in this case we're going

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.460 
going to cut so in this case we're going
to<00:00:28.130> cut<00:00:28.279> four<00:00:28.519> tabs<00:00:28.730> push<00:00:29.090> full<00:00:29.390> and<00:00:30.230> you<00:00:30.289> push

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:30.470 
to cut four tabs push full and you push

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.270 
to cut four tabs push full and you push
your<00:00:30.529> value<00:00:30.859> again<00:00:32.769> so<00:00:33.769> far

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
your value again so far

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.100 
your value again so far
did<00:00:34.970> you<00:00:35.090> see<00:00:35.360> on<00:00:35.449> my<00:00:35.570> left<00:00:35.600> foot<00:00:35.870> we<00:00:35.989> have<00:00:36.020> a

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.110 
did you see on my left foot we have a

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:37.420 
did you see on my left foot we have a
foot<00:00:36.350> pedal<00:00:36.469> this<00:00:36.860> is<00:00:37.010> always<00:00:37.160> going<00:00:37.370> to

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:37.430 
foot pedal this is always going to

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.569 
foot pedal this is always going to
activate<00:00:37.940> the<00:00:38.750> cutter<00:00:38.989> or<00:00:39.890> do<00:00:40.100> to<00:00:40.250> take<00:00:40.430> our

00:00:40.569 --> 00:00:40.579 
activate the cutter or do to take our

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:44.860 
activate the cutter or do to take our
first<00:00:40.790> paper<00:00:41.149> piece<00:00:41.600> of<00:00:41.750> paper<00:00:43.719> level<00:00:44.719> in

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
first paper piece of paper level in

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.049 
first paper piece of paper level in
there<00:00:45.079> make<00:00:46.010> sure<00:00:46.040> it's<00:00:46.219> on<00:00:46.370> this<00:00:46.520> backstop

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:47.059 
there make sure it's on this backstop

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:49.110 
there make sure it's on this backstop
once<00:00:47.570> you've<00:00:47.780> got<00:00:47.960> a<00:00:47.989> nice<00:00:48.200> and<00:00:48.410> squared<00:00:48.680> up

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.120 
once you've got a nice and squared up

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.889 
once you've got a nice and squared up
put<00:00:50.120> pressure<00:00:50.360> down<00:00:50.480> on<00:00:50.660> the<00:00:50.809> foot<00:00:50.989> pedal

00:00:52.889 --> 00:00:52.899 
put pressure down on the foot pedal

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:55.510 
put pressure down on the foot pedal
that's<00:00:53.899> it<00:00:54.110> that's<00:00:54.469> our<00:00:54.680> first<00:00:54.890> tab<00:00:55.280> what's

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:55.520 
that's it that's our first tab what's

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.369 
that's it that's our first tab what's
this<00:00:55.640> cut<00:00:55.940> the<00:00:56.329> backstop<00:00:56.690> will<00:00:56.870> move

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:57.379 
this cut the backstop will move

00:00:57.379 --> 00:00:59.920 
this cut the backstop will move
so<00:00:58.190> when<00:00:58.430> there<00:00:58.579> need<00:00:58.789> to<00:00:58.940> do<00:00:59.120> is<00:00:59.390> just<00:00:59.660> putting

00:00:59.920 --> 00:00:59.930 
so when there need to do is just putting

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.010 
so when there need to do is just putting
our<00:00:59.989> second<00:01:00.410> piece<00:01:00.530> of<00:01:00.559> paper<00:01:00.920> you<00:01:01.870> slide<00:01:02.870> it

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:03.020 
our second piece of paper you slide it

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.859 
our second piece of paper you slide it
in<00:01:03.339> turn<00:01:04.339> up<00:01:04.430> to<00:01:04.580> the<00:01:04.670> backstop<00:01:05.089> put<00:01:05.600> pressure

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:05.869 
in turn up to the backstop put pressure

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:15.690 
in turn up to the backstop put pressure
on<00:01:06.050> the<00:01:06.170> left<00:01:06.350> foot<00:01:09.520> backstop<00:01:10.520> moves<00:01:10.790> again

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.240 

slide<00:01:16.700> it<00:01:16.850> in<00:01:16.970> make<00:01:17.930> sure<00:01:18.080> it's<00:01:18.229> all<00:01:18.950> squared

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
slide it in make sure it's all squared

there we have a four times one two three
you<00:01:38.810> can't<00:01:39.079> produce<00:01:39.259> diamonds<00:01:39.670> what<00:01:40.670> you<00:01:40.729> do

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
you can't produce diamonds what you do

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.969 
you can't produce diamonds what you do
is<00:01:41.000> just<00:01:41.030> simply<00:01:41.420> reverse<00:01:41.930> the<00:01:41.960> order<00:01:42.259> you

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
is just simply reverse the order you

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:46.270 
is just simply reverse the order you
take<00:01:43.720> for<00:01:44.720> the<00:01:45.110> last<00:01:45.350> piece<00:01:45.680> that<00:01:45.860> you<00:01:45.950> did<00:01:45.979> not

cut<00:01:47.200> you<00:01:48.200> let<00:01:48.380> in<00:01:48.500> the<00:01:48.590> machine

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:49.159 
cut you let in the machine

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:54.770 
cut you let in the machine
once<00:01:49.790> again<00:01:49.970> box<00:01:50.570> it<00:01:50.750> up

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.060 

we<00:01:55.780> cut<00:01:55.960> it<00:01:56.080> we<00:01:56.200> are<00:01:56.320> going<00:01:56.619> to<00:01:56.710> get<00:01:56.830> a<00:01:56.860> cut

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 
we cut it we are going to get a cut

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.010 
we cut it we are going to get a cut
three<00:01:57.430> pieces<00:01:57.460> of<00:01:57.820> paper<00:01:57.880> so<00:01:58.270> I<00:01:58.330> scoped<00:01:58.780> that

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
three pieces of paper so I scoped that

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.330 
three pieces of paper so I scoped that
the<00:01:59.080> second<00:01:59.470> piece<00:01:59.970> slide<00:02:00.970> it<00:02:01.119> in<00:02:02.040> box<00:02:03.040> it<00:02:03.280> up

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
the second piece slide it in box it up

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:10.850 
the second piece slide it in box it up
and<00:02:08.310> then<00:02:09.310> you<00:02:09.429> only<00:02:09.550> cut<00:02:09.759> the<00:02:09.789> third<00:02:10.119> piece

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
and then you only cut the third piece

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:22.229 
and then you only cut the third piece
third<00:02:11.860> and<00:02:12.100> final<00:02:12.489> to<00:02:12.940> create<00:02:20.850> so<00:02:21.850> you<00:02:21.910> create

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:22.239 
third and final to create so you create

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:30.569 
third and final to create so you create
honest<00:02:22.600> you<00:02:22.750> have<00:02:22.870> one<00:02:24.300> two<00:02:25.300> three<00:02:27.569> four
