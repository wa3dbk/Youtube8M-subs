 receive compensation or compensation 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:04.020
 in the event that that happens 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:04.020
 from events to concerted risks 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.640
 you never had for cheap insurance 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:18.590
 we must mention that many are passed 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:21.360
 for the price exclusively because 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.190
 we can end up paying more 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.350
 once we get behind the wheel 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:29.300
 There can be a thousand unforeseen events 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.300

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.520
 with height of the insurance 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.810
 many times when hiring insurance only 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.940
 we look at the basics but the 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:46.220
 coverage is something to take into account 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.140
 the cheap to the expensive thread but it 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.080
 can find complete insurance to 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.150
 good price 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.590
 you have to know how to search within the market 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:56.230
 in the sign the something that samuel to 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.600
 our needs 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:59.800
 it is useless to take out insurance for everything 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.080
 risk for an old car and 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:06.000
 ramshackle to pay more for creatures 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.000
 dark of the scales of the steels 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.590
 looking insecure 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.910
 There are different car insurers 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.740
 in the market that compete and offer 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.110
 different car insurance packages 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.940
 in this way we have a great 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.850
 opportunity to find insurance 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.590
 our expectations there are many 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.050
 factors that increase the final price 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.600
 Insurance 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:35.330
 for example the history of parts in the 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:37.340
 current company if we have it 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.800
 old driving license the 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.470
 Brand power and car add-ons 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:45.160
 if a farm is saved and even the 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.150
 gender of drivers 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.340
 normally with equal conditions 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:52.840
 independent of the country women 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.840
 they have more affordable companies 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.879
 and create our own package 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:04.570
 There are insurers that offer different 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.310
 car insurance packages and we 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:08.500
 will help create the personal and even though 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.330
 may have a higher cost this may 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.170
 be better for the needs that 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.170
 need to cover 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.680
 happiness our policy 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:24.790
 it is important to analyze everything he says 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.010
 our insurance policy in this way 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.330
 the possible misunderstanding will be reduced and it is 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.100
 that the policy is something that many 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:32.900
 people stop reading 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.880
 we must consult any doubt 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.040
 directly with the department of 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.840
 customer service of the insurer or 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.230
 to the broker with whom we hire the 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.230
 safe 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:48.430
 verify that the contract matches 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:48.430
 The policy 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:55.550
 when hiring our car insurance 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.170
 We have a copy of the contract and 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:00.760
 the policy so before signing 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:02.830
 we must verify all your concerts 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:06.870
 and above all we must always carry it 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:06.870
 with us in the glove compartment of the car 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:14.370
 weigh and apply for or not the coverage of 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:14.370
 own damages 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:21.639
 this is most commonly known for everything 

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:23.229
 risk, although it should be pointed out that 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:26.180
 There is no policy covering any 

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:29.060
 risk that may happen 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:30.949
 it is more in this modality what according to the 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:34.330
 attraction that the car makes and 

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:37.040
 you can also include franchises 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:39.230
 there are usually eventualities like 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:41.920
 example natural disasters in the 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:44.140
 that insurance companies do not enter 

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.340
 this type of coverage is usually something 

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:47.470
 face 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:51.340
 it did not compensate especially if the vehicle 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:53.260
 is new or has great value even 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:54.820
 there are brands of cars that give a year 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.870
 of co2 for all risk insurance with the 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:58.880
 tip of the car 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:01.280
 most people usually 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:04.150
 hire him between the first 35 years 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.150
 of life of the car 

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:11.010
 third party insurance the most requested 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:17.690
 It is cheaper than the previous 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:20.330
 Ideally, when the car goes 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:23.660
 having a few years of use this 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:27.169
 type of insurance we should be clear that 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:28.969
 This is the most requested type of policy 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:31.639
 with the obligatory insurance neither the big ones 

00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:33.409
 that we cause to third parties but not 

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:36.249
 will cover the damage to our vehicle or 

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:36.249
 the people who go 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:43.560
 and infrastructure of the insurer 

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:51.030
 there are colleagues who do not have offices or 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:52.830
 only in the capitals have this 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:56.060
 causes a tremendous bureaucracy that 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:59.600
 It can end by despairing 

00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:01.160
 we must assess if they compensate us without 

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:03.050
 have full confidence that 

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:05.230
 insurer will respond quickly and of 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:07.780
 efficient way 

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:09.520
 although in truth there are companies with 

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:12.010
 which you can hire insurance 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:14.700
 car online and they are truly 

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:14.700
 responsible 

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:21.440
 and check roadside assistance 

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:28.000
 in the assistance that you require one of 

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:30.360
 the most important points in an insurance 

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.360
 of car 

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:35.100
 we must check that our policy 

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:36.660
 includes this assistance and analyze if 

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:37.980
 there is some kind of limitation in 

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:39.840
 how much distance in kilometers 

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:42.180
 captain to take the car to the workshop 

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:43.920
 from the site of the accident because if 

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:45.870
 we can not be forced to 

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:49.970
 disburse a significant amount for 

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:49.970
 the transfer of the car out there in nearby 

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:54.860
 and let's not say if our intention is 

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:56.480
 evaluate the trusted tortillas already 

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:58.550
 that the vehicle is supposed to 

00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:00.380
 spend several days in the workshop and can 

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:02.120
 so the most logical thing is to choose one that 

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:03.860
 be in our city to not have to 

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:07.060
 Take another trip when picking up 

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:07.060
 he was building arranged 

00:07:10.449 --> 00:07:17.380
 we hope this video can be useful 

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:17.380
 of help thanks and best regards
