all<00:01:15.659> of<00:01:15.689> these<00:01:15.900> things<00:01:16.140> but<00:01:16.560> as<00:01:16.650> time

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
all of these things but as time

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.170 
all of these things but as time
progressed<00:01:17.070> we<00:01:17.490> realized<00:01:17.850> that<00:01:18.000> it<00:01:18.090> would

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
progressed we realized that it would

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.570 
progressed we realized that it would
probably<00:01:18.450> be<00:01:18.810> better<00:01:19.020> if<00:01:19.290> we<00:01:19.350> gave<00:01:20.250> a<00:01:20.280> little

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
probably be better if we gave a little

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:21.950 
probably be better if we gave a little
bit<00:01:20.670> of<00:01:20.759> lead<00:01:20.939> time<00:01:21.150> and<00:01:21.450> had<00:01:21.570> a<00:01:21.600> little<00:01:21.720> bit<00:01:21.930> of

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
bit of lead time and had a little bit of

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.929 
bit of lead time and had a little bit of
prep<00:01:22.350> for<00:01:22.890> these<00:01:23.009> things<00:01:23.310> and<00:01:23.490> didn't<00:01:23.729> just

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
prep for these things and didn't just

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.910 
prep for these things and didn't just
decide<00:01:24.299> right<00:01:24.930> there<00:01:25.140> on<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.320> spot<00:01:25.530> what<00:01:25.830> we

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
decide right there on the spot what we

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.170 
decide right there on the spot what we
were<00:01:26.040> going<00:01:26.159> to<00:01:26.250> do<00:01:26.430> so<00:01:26.729> that<00:01:26.880> is<00:01:26.970> what<00:01:27.090> I'm

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
were going to do so that is what I'm

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.899

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
seems like an awfully bad idea and the

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.520 
seems like an awfully bad idea and the
last<00:03:41.430> question<00:03:41.580> is<00:03:41.970> is<00:03:42.150> it<00:03:42.180> really<00:03:42.510> $35<00:03:43.350> to

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
park at VidCon and the answer that is

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.509
