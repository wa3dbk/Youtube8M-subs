00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:09.950 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:13.620 

you

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:13.630 

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:26.670 

you

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:26.680 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:35.400 

you

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:35.410 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:43.370 

so<00:00:36.480> how<00:00:37.480> do<00:00:37.540> they<00:00:37.690> do<00:00:37.750> this<00:00:37.840> well<00:00:41.610> basically

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:43.380 
so how do they do this well basically

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:46.260 
so how do they do this well basically
the<00:00:44.380> place<00:00:44.770> where<00:00:45.040> you<00:00:45.160> see<00:00:45.489> a<00:00:45.730> block<00:00:46.239> that

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:46.270 
the place where you see a block that

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:49.020 
the place where you see a block that
really<00:00:46.989> should<00:00:47.320> not<00:00:47.559> be<00:00:47.830> there<00:00:48.070> Lee<00:00:48.250> this

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.030 
really should not be there Lee this

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.390 
really should not be there Lee this
first<00:00:49.360> one<00:00:49.540> not<00:00:50.290> the<00:00:50.440> second<00:00:50.800> one<00:00:50.920> put<00:00:51.220> this

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:51.400 
first one not the second one put this

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.630 
first one not the second one put this
third<00:00:51.670> one<00:00:51.879> fifth<00:00:52.750> one<00:00:52.840> seventh<00:00:53.559> one<00:00:53.769> ninth

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:54.640 
third one fifth one seventh one ninth

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.280 
third one fifth one seventh one ninth
one<00:00:55.050> all<00:00:56.050> of<00:00:56.350> those<00:00:56.590> are<00:00:56.949> ghosts<00:00:57.430> blocks<00:00:58.290> so

00:00:59.280 --> 00:00:59.290 
one all of those are ghosts blocks so

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:01.410 
one all of those are ghosts blocks so
these<00:00:59.860> are<00:01:00.040> just<00:01:00.070> falling<00:01:00.610> sand<00:01:00.940> entities

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.420 
these are just falling sand entities

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.710 
these are just falling sand entities
with<00:01:02.140> the<00:01:02.230> time<00:01:02.500> of<00:01:02.710> zero<00:01:03.010> so<00:01:03.670> they<00:01:03.879> d<00:01:04.180> spawn<00:01:04.479> as

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:04.720 
with the time of zero so they d spawn as

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.700 
with the time of zero so they d spawn as
soon<00:01:05.170> as<00:01:05.350> they<00:01:05.470> appear<00:01:06.570> and<00:01:07.570> the<00:01:08.259> slight

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:08.710 
soon as they appear and the slight

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:11.490 
soon as they appear and the slight
upwards<00:01:09.310> velocity<00:01:09.970> so<00:01:10.869> that<00:01:10.899> they<00:01:11.140> don't<00:01:11.259> just

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 
upwards velocity so that they don't just

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.300 
upwards velocity so that they don't just
immediately<00:01:12.070> start<00:01:12.340> falling<00:01:12.700> they<00:01:13.600> are<00:01:13.810> a<00:01:14.310> bit

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 
immediately start falling they are a bit

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.290 
immediately start falling they are a bit
glitchy<00:01:15.789> but<00:01:16.600> that's<00:01:16.930> it's<00:01:17.649> not<00:01:17.800> too<00:01:18.100> bad<00:01:18.369> you

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:19.300 
glitchy but that's it's not too bad you

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.859 
glitchy but that's it's not too bad you
can<00:01:19.479> live<00:01:19.690> the<00:01:19.840> fat<00:01:21.330> so<00:01:22.330> if<00:01:22.420> they're<00:01:22.570> falling

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:22.869 
can live the fat so if they're falling

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:25.440 
can live the fat so if they're falling
sand<00:01:23.170> what's<00:01:24.130> making<00:01:24.460> them<00:01:24.520> solid<00:01:24.970> why<00:01:25.149> can't

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
sand what's making them solid why can't

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.930 
sand what's making them solid why can't
I<00:01:25.600> just<00:01:25.630> walk<00:01:26.020> straight<00:01:26.229> through<00:01:26.440> it<00:01:26.860> and<00:01:27.009> what

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:27.940 
I just walk straight through it and what

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:35.430 
I just walk straight through it and what
can<00:01:28.060> I<00:01:28.090> walk<00:01:28.390> on<00:01:28.660> it<00:01:29.310> well<00:01:31.649> I'll<00:01:32.649> show<00:01:33.070> you<00:01:34.440> I'll

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:35.440 
can I walk on it well I'll show you I'll

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.540 
can I walk on it well I'll show you I'll
just<00:01:35.500> change<00:01:36.039> the<00:01:38.100> fonts<00:01:39.100> and<00:01:39.250> then<00:01:39.459> the

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:39.550 
just change the fonts and then the

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:42.089 
just change the fonts and then the
texture<00:01:40.149> to<00:01:40.420> be<00:01:40.569> glass<00:01:40.959> so<00:01:41.470> you<00:01:41.500> can<00:01:41.800> see

00:01:42.089 --> 00:01:42.099 
texture to be glass so you can see

00:01:42.099 --> 00:01:50.430 
texture to be glass so you can see
inside<00:01:42.490> it<00:01:42.550> and<00:01:44.190> you<00:01:45.190> will<00:01:45.520> see<00:01:45.880> I<00:01:47.069> can<00:01:49.440> flower

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:50.440 
inside it and you will see I can flower

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.169 
inside it and you will see I can flower
pots<00:01:50.800> yeah<00:01:51.899> so<00:01:53.220> inside<00:01:54.220> every<00:01:54.610> falling<00:01:54.940> sand

00:01:55.169 --> 00:01:55.179 
pots yeah so inside every falling sand

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:58.830 
pots yeah so inside every falling sand
there<00:01:55.899> is<00:01:56.140> a<00:01:56.170> flowerpot<00:01:57.270> so<00:01:58.270> you're<00:01:58.720> not

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
there is a flowerpot so you're not

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.469 
there is a flowerpot so you're not
actually<00:01:59.110> walking<00:01:59.860> on<00:02:00.280> the<00:02:00.700> falling<00:02:01.030> sand<00:02:01.240> of

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:01.479 
actually walking on the falling sand of

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:06.050 
actually walking on the falling sand of
course<00:02:01.750> you're<00:02:02.530> walking<00:02:02.890> on<00:02:03.069> the<00:02:03.670> flowerpot

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
course you're walking on the flowerpot

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.210 
course you're walking on the flowerpot
this<00:02:07.060> is<00:02:07.179> almost<00:02:07.690> exactly<00:02:07.869> like<00:02:08.349> it<00:02:08.679> was<00:02:08.709> in

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
this is almost exactly like it was in

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:10.949 
this is almost exactly like it was in
simply<00:02:09.789> starts<00:02:10.090> video<00:02:10.330> that<00:02:10.479> he<00:02:10.569> did<00:02:10.720> a<00:02:10.750> while

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
simply starts video that he did a while

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:16.140 
simply starts video that he did a while
ago<00:02:11.760> but<00:02:13.140> his<00:02:14.140> required<00:02:14.620> you<00:02:15.459> to<00:02:15.489> have<00:02:15.730> a<00:02:15.760> fence

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
ago but his required you to have a fence

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.800 
ago but his required you to have a fence
post<00:02:16.270> under<00:02:16.900> here<00:02:17.290> in<00:02:17.470> the<00:02:17.920> block<00:02:18.160> 36<00:02:18.730> and<00:02:19.120> then

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
post under here in the block 36 and then

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.260 
post under here in the block 36 and then
also<00:02:20.050> a<00:02:20.260> flower<00:02:20.470> pot<00:02:20.800> while<00:02:21.459> mine<00:02:21.700> is<00:02:21.730> just<00:02:22.180> a

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
also a flower pot while mine is just a

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.110 
also a flower pot while mine is just a
flower<00:02:22.510> pot<00:02:22.780> and<00:02:23.080> then<00:02:23.200> the<00:02:23.319> ghost<00:02:23.530> blocks<00:02:24.120> now

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
flower pot and then the ghost blocks now

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.770 
flower pot and then the ghost blocks now
also<00:02:25.390> you<00:02:26.220> wouldn't<00:02:27.220> normally<00:02:27.459> be<00:02:27.970> able<00:02:28.480> to

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
also you wouldn't normally be able to

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.460 
also you wouldn't normally be able to
spawn<00:02:29.430> a<00:02:30.430> falling<00:02:31.150> sand<00:02:31.420> and<00:02:31.900> a<00:02:32.200> half

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
spawn a falling sand and a half

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.619 
spawn a falling sand and a half
increment<00:02:33.010> so<00:02:33.670> like<00:02:33.849> 1.5<00:02:34.840> blocks<00:02:35.110> up<00:02:35.500> but

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:36.629 
increment so like 1.5 blocks up but

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:40.470 
increment so like 1.5 blocks up but
there<00:02:37.629> is<00:02:37.780> a<00:02:37.810> bug<00:02:38.110> in<00:02:38.349> the<00:02:39.040> new<00:02:39.129> snapshot<00:02:39.480> where

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
there is a bug in the new snapshot where

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.680 
there is a bug in the new snapshot where
if<00:02:40.750> you<00:02:40.900> use<00:02:41.080> relative<00:02:41.590> coordinates<00:02:42.280> as<00:02:42.550> I<00:02:43.330> had

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
if you use relative coordinates as I had

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.210 
if you use relative coordinates as I had
here

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
here

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.510 
here
it<00:02:46.220> will<00:02:46.459> spawn<00:02:46.760> it<00:02:46.910> one<00:02:47.360> half<00:02:47.660> block<00:02:48.520> let's

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:49.520 
it will spawn it one half block let's

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.960 
it will spawn it one half block let's
see<00:02:49.730> one<00:02:50.300> half<00:02:50.540> block<00:02:51.069> lower<00:02:52.069> one<00:02:52.640> half<00:02:52.760> block

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
see one half block lower one half block

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.059 
see one half block lower one half block
lower<00:02:53.180> yeah<00:02:53.390> one<00:02:53.959> half<00:02:54.110> block<00:02:54.380> lower<00:02:54.709> than<00:02:54.950> it

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:55.069 
lower yeah one half block lower than it

00:02:55.069 --> 00:03:01.059 
lower yeah one half block lower than it
should<00:02:55.280> normally<00:02:55.730> spawn<00:02:58.120> so<00:02:59.920> this<00:03:00.920> is<00:03:00.950> the

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:01.069 
should normally spawn so this is the

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:07.090 
should normally spawn so this is the
command<00:03:03.040> summit<00:03:04.209> false<00:03:05.209> and<00:03:05.569> entity<00:03:06.020> and<00:03:06.890> then

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
command summit false and entity and then

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.860 
command summit false and entity and then
the<00:03:07.220> relative<00:03:07.670> coordinates<00:03:08.209> just<00:03:08.630> pawn<00:03:08.840> it

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
the relative coordinates just pawn it

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.479 
the relative coordinates just pawn it
over<00:03:09.140> there<00:03:09.319> and<00:03:09.709> keep<00:03:09.890> in<00:03:10.040> mind<00:03:10.220> that<00:03:10.310> it's

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
over there and keep in mind that it's

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:14.590 
over there and keep in mind that it's
going<00:03:10.580> to<00:03:10.640> be<00:03:10.760> a<00:03:10.790> half<00:03:11.090> a<00:03:11.120> lot<00:03:11.420> lower<00:03:13.330> the<00:03:14.330> tile

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600

ID<00:03:14.900> so<00:03:15.410> the<00:03:15.560> texture<00:03:15.920> you<00:03:15.980> want<00:03:16.190> to<00:03:16.280> give<00:03:16.400> it<00:03:16.520> in

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
ID so the texture you want to give it in

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:22.360 
ID so the texture you want to give it in
my<00:03:17.209> case<00:03:17.510> this<00:03:18.380> would<00:03:18.650> be<00:03:18.680> a<00:03:19.330> note<00:03:20.330> block<00:03:21.370> time

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
my case this would be a note block time

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.020 
my case this would be a note block time
zero<00:03:23.769> you<00:03:24.769> don't<00:03:24.950> want<00:03:25.100> to<00:03:25.160> drop<00:03:25.430> any<00:03:25.610> items

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
zero you don't want to drop any items

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.140 
zero you don't want to drop any items
when<00:03:26.209> it<00:03:26.300> falls<00:03:26.480> and<00:03:27.380> then<00:03:27.680> the<00:03:27.769> motion<00:03:28.100> is<00:03:28.310> a

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
when it falls and then the motion is a

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.780 
when it falls and then the motion is a
slight<00:03:30.019> upwards<00:03:30.739> velocity<00:03:31.310> which<00:03:31.489> you<00:03:31.640> can

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
slight upwards velocity which you can

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:40.180 
slight upwards velocity which you can
see<00:03:31.819> right<00:03:31.970> here<00:03:34.209> 0.04<00:03:37.900> and<00:03:38.900> these<00:03:39.769> are<00:03:39.980> these

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
see right here 0.04 and these are these

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:41.410 
see right here 0.04 and these are these
all<00:03:40.370> these<00:03:40.640> command<00:03:40.970> blocks<00:03:41.150> are<00:03:41.300> all

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420 
all these command blocks are all

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.210 
all these command blocks are all
basically<00:03:41.630> the<00:03:41.840> same<00:03:41.959> thing<00:03:42.170> just<00:03:43.100> with

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
basically the same thing just with

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.270 
basically the same thing just with
different<00:03:43.489> relative<00:03:44.090> coordinates<00:03:44.680> so<00:03:45.680> this

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
different relative coordinates so this

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.430 
different relative coordinates so this
first<00:03:46.519> one<00:03:46.730> is<00:03:46.940> for<00:03:47.269> that<00:03:47.420> one<00:03:48.050> that's<00:03:48.230> kind<00:03:48.410> of

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
first one is for that one that's kind of

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.949 
first one is for that one that's kind of
halfway<00:03:48.650> and<00:03:48.890> sand<00:03:49.250> next<00:03:50.120> one's<00:03:50.329> for<00:03:50.510> third

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 
halfway and sand next one's for third

note<00:03:53.959> block<00:03:54.549> 79<00:03:56.860> and<00:03:57.860> then<00:03:57.920> this<00:03:58.340> just<00:03:58.850> a<00:03:58.970> one

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
note block 79 and then this just a one

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.509 
note block 79 and then this just a one

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250 
single day set block 0 negative 10 so

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:13.710 
single day set block 0 negative 10 so
right<00:04:10.610> below<00:04:10.850> it<00:04:10.880> minus<00:04:11.540> one<00:04:11.690> on<00:04:11.780> the<00:04:11.840> y-value

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:19.669 
it's destroying it each time so this

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:22.750 
it's destroying it each time so this

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
if I've used to smuggle in my past few

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.830 
if I've used to smuggle in my past few
videos<00:04:24.770> so<00:04:25.130> you<00:04:25.190> might<00:04:25.510> recognize<00:04:26.510> it<00:04:26.720> anyway

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 
videos so you might recognize it anyway

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.330 
videos so you might recognize it anyway
there<00:04:29.840> is<00:04:29.990> one<00:04:30.289> problem<00:04:30.530> with<00:04:30.950> this<00:04:31.010> however

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
there is one problem with this however

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:34.210 
there is one problem with this however
which<00:04:32.330> is<00:04:32.570> that<00:04:32.840> you<00:04:32.960> can't<00:04:33.320> just<00:04:33.590> walk

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:34.220 
which is that you can't just walk

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:36.640 
which is that you can't just walk
straight<00:04:34.430> of<00:04:34.729> it<00:04:34.850> like<00:04:35.539> stairs<00:04:35.870> I<00:04:36.169> can't<00:04:36.440> just

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
straight of it like stairs I can't just

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:40.180 
straight of it like stairs I can't just
you<00:04:37.100> know<00:04:37.220> run<00:04:37.490> up<00:04:37.850> the<00:04:38.000> stairs<00:04:39.010> if<00:04:40.010> you've

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.190 
you know run up the stairs if you've

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:42.460 
you know run up the stairs if you've
seen<00:04:40.340> simply<00:04:40.640> socks<00:04:40.880> video<00:04:41.150> he<00:04:41.870> can<00:04:42.140> do<00:04:42.350> that

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:42.470 
seen simply socks video he can do that

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:45.610 
seen simply socks video he can do that
with<00:04:42.650> his<00:04:42.800> design<00:04:43.930> but<00:04:44.930> that<00:04:45.080> was<00:04:45.200> in<00:04:45.350> an

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:45.620 
with his design but that was in an

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.550 
with his design but that was in an
earlier<00:04:46.160> version<00:04:46.370> and<00:04:46.900> you<00:04:47.900> can't<00:04:48.169> really<00:04:48.320> do

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:48.560 
earlier version and you can't really do

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.670 
earlier version and you can't really do
any<00:04:48.800> more<00:04:48.979> I<00:04:49.250> had<00:04:49.970> tried<00:04:50.180> it<00:04:50.419> it<00:04:50.990> just<00:04:51.050> for<00:04:51.530> some

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 
any more I had tried it it just for some

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:56.050 
any more I had tried it it just for some
reason<00:04:51.710> it's<00:04:52.340> it's<00:04:52.789> broken<00:04:53.090> like<00:04:53.390> that<00:04:53.570> so<00:04:55.060> why

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:56.060 
reason it's it's broken like that so why

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:57.360 
reason it's it's broken like that so why
would<00:04:56.270> you<00:04:56.360> use<00:04:56.390> this<00:04:56.750> design

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:57.370 
would you use this design

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:00.450 
would you use this design
for<00:04:57.520> that<00:04:57.669> over<00:04:58.090> simply<00:04:58.360> Sark's<00:04:58.660> design<00:04:59.460> well

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460 
for that over simply Sark's design well

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:05.280 
for that over simply Sark's design well
mine<00:05:01.360> can<00:05:01.570> be<00:05:01.600> suspended<00:05:02.320> in<00:05:02.560> midair<00:05:04.229> so<00:05:05.229> you

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:05.290 
mine can be suspended in midair so you

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:07.530 
mine can be suspended in midair so you
don't<00:05:05.530> need<00:05:05.620> anything<00:05:05.889> below<00:05:06.669> it<00:05:06.820> no<00:05:07.120> nothing

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:07.540 
don't need anything below it no nothing

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:09.680 
don't need anything below it no nothing
nothing<00:05:07.900> to<00:05:08.139> cover<00:05:08.350> nothing<00:05:08.740> to<00:05:08.830> hide<00:05:09.040> and

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:09.690 
nothing to cover nothing to hide and

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:13.760 
nothing to cover nothing to hide and
also<00:05:10.690> you<00:05:11.470> can<00:05:11.680> do<00:05:11.830> this<00:05:11.979> completely<00:05:12.699> in<00:05:13.120> game

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:13.770 
also you can do this completely in game

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:17.129 
also you can do this completely in game
so<00:05:14.770> no<00:05:15.220> MCEdit<00:05:15.940> filters<00:05:16.479> are<00:05:16.720> quiet<00:05:16.960> or

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:17.139 
so no MCEdit filters are quiet or

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:20.400 
so no MCEdit filters are quiet or
anything<00:05:17.470> like<00:05:17.500> that<00:05:17.940> you<00:05:18.940> just<00:05:19.290> build<00:05:20.290> this

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:20.410 
anything like that you just build this

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:22.710 
anything like that you just build this
clock<00:05:20.740> which<00:05:21.070> I<00:05:21.220> did<00:05:21.430> and<00:05:21.639> then<00:05:21.729> ghost<00:05:22.419> blocks

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:22.720 
clock which I did and then ghost blocks

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:27.990 
clock which I did and then ghost blocks
and<00:05:23.139> then<00:05:23.940> for<00:05:24.940> the<00:05:25.120> floating<00:05:26.910> for<00:05:27.910> the

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:28.000 
and then for the floating for the

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.439 
and then for the floating for the
floating<00:05:28.530> flower<00:05:29.530> pots<00:05:29.830> just<00:05:30.729> use<00:05:30.910> set<00:05:31.210> block

00:05:31.439 --> 00:05:31.449 
floating flower pots just use set block

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:33.900 
floating flower pots just use set block
make<00:05:32.380> sure<00:05:32.560> not<00:05:32.680> to<00:05:32.740> update<00:05:32.979> them<00:05:33.340> because<00:05:33.789> if

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:33.910 
make sure not to update them because if

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:36.029 
make sure not to update them because if
you<00:05:33.970> ever<00:05:34.120> update<00:05:34.389> them<00:05:34.810> the<00:05:35.740> game<00:05:35.860> will

00:05:36.029 --> 00:05:36.039 
you ever update them the game will

00:05:36.039 --> 00:05:37.590 
you ever update them the game will
realize<00:05:36.430> that<00:05:36.789> there's<00:05:37.030> a<00:05:37.090> flower<00:05:37.330> pot

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:37.600 
realize that there's a flower pot
