00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 
because I started it and I was it go

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.039 
because I started it and I was it go
yeah<00:00:49.129> I'll<00:00:49.220> probably<00:00:49.369> like<00:00:49.729> it<00:00:49.909> and<00:00:50.150> I<00:00:50.390> ended

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:51.049 
yeah I'll probably like it and I ended

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:57.820 
yeah I'll probably like it and I ended
up<00:00:51.170> not<00:00:51.350> liking<00:00:51.530> it<00:00:51.769> that<00:00:52.129> much<00:00:55.869> so<00:00:56.869> killzone<00:00:57.650> 2

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:57.830 
up not liking it that much so killzone 2

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:00.070 
up not liking it that much so killzone 2
gets<00:00:58.129> like<00:00:58.369> three<00:00:58.790> videos<00:00:59.119> done<00:00:59.570> every<00:00:59.869> two

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:00.080

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
Japanese stuff usually it's pretty

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.720 
Japanese stuff usually it's pretty
straightforward<00:03:04.360> but<00:03:04.930> sometimes<00:03:05.590> it's<00:03:05.829> not

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
straightforward but sometimes it's not

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.930 
straightforward but sometimes it's not
as<00:03:06.910> straightforward<00:03:08.370> anyway<00:03:09.370> that's<00:03:09.579> pretty

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
as straightforward anyway that's pretty

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.780 
as straightforward anyway that's pretty
much<00:03:10.060> it<00:03:10.709> the<00:03:11.709> heck<00:03:11.890> kind<00:03:12.130> of<00:03:12.280> annoyed<00:03:12.489> me<00:03:12.670> at

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
much it the heck kind of annoyed me at

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.509 
much it the heck kind of annoyed me at
times<00:03:12.940> it<00:03:13.510> started<00:03:13.900> off<00:03:13.989> good<00:03:14.230> and<00:03:14.470> kind<00:03:15.459> of

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 
times it started off good and kind of

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:20.490 
times it started off good and kind of
poorly<00:03:15.840> and<00:03:17.459> yeah<00:03:18.989> we<00:03:19.989> have<00:03:20.140> some<00:03:20.170> funny

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
poorly and yeah we have some funny

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.390 
poorly and yeah we have some funny
moments<00:03:20.680> but<00:03:22.200> unfortunately<00:03:23.200> the<00:03:23.769> design<00:03:24.130> was

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
moments but unfortunately the design was

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.569 
moments but unfortunately the design was
incredibly<00:03:25.329> super<00:03:25.750> repetitive<00:03:26.380> the<00:03:27.190> only

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:27.579 
incredibly super repetitive the only

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:30.720 
incredibly super repetitive the only
thing<00:03:27.760> it<00:03:27.880> did<00:03:28.090> was<00:03:28.120> it<00:03:28.660> just<00:03:29.549> recycled<00:03:30.549> the

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
thing it did was it just recycled the

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.870 
thing it did was it just recycled the
same<00:03:31.350> platforming<00:03:32.350> and<00:03:32.560> just<00:03:33.310> added<00:03:33.730> more

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
same platforming and just added more

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.090 
same platforming and just added more
 in<00:03:34.269> the<00:03:34.329> way<00:03:34.480> like<00:03:34.840> oh<00:03:35.049> look<00:03:35.320> tiny<00:03:35.739> jumps

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
 in the way like oh look tiny jumps

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:37.040 
 in the way like oh look tiny jumps
and<00:03:36.400> some<00:03:36.579> koopa

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.050 
and some koopa

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:38.390 
and some koopa
and<00:03:37.170> then<00:03:37.290> there<00:03:37.500> was<00:03:37.590> dry<00:03:37.800> bones<00:03:38.070> everywhere

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
fall on my head and kill me that's

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.470 
fall on my head and kill me that's
pretty<00:04:19.650> much<00:04:19.890> what<00:04:20.160> I<00:04:20.190> what<00:04:20.880> I<00:04:20.910> have<00:04:21.090> save<00:04:21.330> up

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:21.480 
pretty much what I what I have save up

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:26.000 
pretty much what I what I have save up
ahead<00:04:23.420> but<00:04:24.420> we<00:04:24.540> pretty<00:04:24.810> much<00:04:24.930> did<00:04:25.260> the<00:04:25.800> same

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
ahead but we pretty much did the same

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:28.370 
ahead but we pretty much did the same
thing<00:04:26.040> most<00:04:26.610> of<00:04:26.820> the<00:04:26.970> time<00:04:27.240> it<00:04:27.660> never<00:04:28.050> really

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380 
thing most of the time it never really

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.160 
thing most of the time it never really
changed<00:04:28.860> unless<00:04:28.980> we<00:04:29.190> got<00:04:29.310> to<00:04:29.430> a<00:04:29.460> ghost<00:04:29.700> house

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:30.170 
changed unless we got to a ghost house

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:33.770 
changed unless we got to a ghost house
then<00:04:31.170> it<00:04:31.290> kind<00:04:31.470> of<00:04:31.500> changed<00:04:32.390> what<00:04:33.390> most<00:04:33.570> of<00:04:33.720> the

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780 
then it kind of changed what most of the

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:35.620 
then it kind of changed what most of the
other<00:04:33.900> levels<00:04:34.260> were<00:04:34.440> exactly<00:04:35.130> the<00:04:35.250> same

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 
other levels were exactly the same

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:43.490 
other levels were exactly the same
except<00:04:36.630> new<00:04:36.900> stuff<00:04:37.170> was<00:04:37.320> added<00:04:41.480> whatever<00:04:42.500> it

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500 
except new stuff was added whatever it

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.000 
except new stuff was added whatever it
there<00:04:44.070> was<00:04:44.190> no<00:04:44.370> cake<00:04:45.530> really<00:04:46.530> annoying<00:04:46.890> at

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.010 
there was no cake really annoying at

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:50.870 
there was no cake really annoying at
times<00:04:47.040> I<00:04:48.050> think<00:04:49.050> I'm<00:04:49.110> gonna<00:04:49.200> sneeze<00:04:49.700> hope<00:04:50.700> not

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 
times I think I'm gonna sneeze hope not

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.700 
times I think I'm gonna sneeze hope not
because<00:04:51.660> that<00:04:51.870> would<00:04:52.470> be<00:04:52.650> pretty<00:04:52.830> annoying

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:54.710 
because that would be pretty annoying

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:58.310 
because that would be pretty annoying
but<00:04:55.710> that's<00:04:55.980> pretty<00:04:56.190> much<00:04:56.690> my<00:04:57.690> thoughts<00:04:58.020> on

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 
but that's pretty much my thoughts on

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.440 
but that's pretty much my thoughts on
the<00:04:58.440> hack<00:04:58.820> we<00:04:59.820> already<00:05:00.090> know<00:05:00.210> what<00:05:00.360> these

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:00.450 
the hack we already know what these

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:03.890 
the hack we already know what these
enemies<00:05:00.720> are<00:05:00.990> and<00:05:01.200> I<00:05:01.400> severely<00:05:02.400> are<00:05:03.330> seriously

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900 
enemies are and I severely are seriously

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:09.290 
enemies are and I severely are seriously
doubt<00:05:04.140> that<00:05:04.169> I<00:05:05.990> any<00:05:06.990> extra<00:05:07.410> stuff<00:05:08.300> yeah

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
doubt that I any extra stuff yeah

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.630 
doubt that I any extra stuff yeah
there's<00:05:09.570> no<00:05:09.750> extra<00:05:10.080> stuff<00:05:10.290> so<00:05:10.560> that's<00:05:11.340> the<00:05:11.580> end

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:11.640 
there's no extra stuff so that's the end

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.040 
there's no extra stuff so that's the end
I'm<00:05:11.970> going<00:05:12.120> to<00:05:12.180> pick<00:05:12.300> a<00:05:12.330> new<00:05:12.390> hack<00:05:12.690> from<00:05:12.900> my

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:13.050 
I'm going to pick a new hack from my

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:16.070 
I'm going to pick a new hack from my
pile<00:05:13.320> o<00:05:13.530> hacks<00:05:13.800> to<00:05:14.070> choose<00:05:14.460> from<00:05:14.900> and<00:05:15.900> we'll
