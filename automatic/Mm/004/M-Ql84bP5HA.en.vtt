00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.970
 well once we assemble the picture 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.890
 electrical and we change what we 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.770
 was missing was to come to the facility and 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.130
 finish placing it install it well 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:38.870
 we have put 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:40.300
 this this plastic spiral that stops 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.940
 that is something more beautiful more 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:45.860
 presentable clips and good ones 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:49.220
 Different elements the differential 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:51.950
 general thermal manne for the theme of the 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:55.470
 pool one that is lit and of 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:58.140
 watering another one for one several plugs 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:00.120
 the time clock the contact for the 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.290
 pool pump keeps an engine 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:06.340
 from the pool 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:09.340
 a thermal magnet of 25 for the output 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:11.200
 of the focus transformer and good for 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.050
 here we have the perimetric clamp 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:17.410
 and we are seeing what the engine consumes 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:19.050
 of pool 3 with 30 plus or minus 3 with 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:22.380
 31 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:24.940
 we have calibrated it here has to 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:28.090
 calibrate the motor guard 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:30.460
 and local and bramos was more or less not 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:33.940
 exact here it comes to you from two and a half to 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:36.220
 four but it's not an exact thing there will be 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:39.390
 that I regulate a little bit more I have it almost 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:41.920
 in three and a half because it's also going 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:45.090
 connected to the output of that the 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:49.109
 chlorine producer 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:52.020
 because this pool is steam by salt 

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:55.079
 it does not go for chlorine, it has this gadget that 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.630
 is connected to the switchboard and this is 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:01.140
 this this piece is what produces the 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.740
 chlorine you get conventional salt and 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.830
 produces chlorine 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.650
 over here we have the pool pump 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.869
 the filter 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:13.340
 the key is the reader to the valve 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:17.280
 selector and the different valves for 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:19.890
 suction drive return fund and 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.440
 free background 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:25.920
 well here we have the manometer this does not 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:28.530
 I installed it I was another company and 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:31.860
 As I said, it is regulated a bit more 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.959
 because we have connected this because 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.940
 because this only works when the 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:37.920
 pump running 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.500
 back said this here we have the 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.600
 transformer and this transformer is of 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:46.730
 the power supply of the 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.730
 sprinklers that we have here 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.130
 what is this is the centralist who is going to 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:54.320
 regulate the 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.320
 the sprinklers we have here the 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.299
 the solenoid valve the stopcock 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.379
 and here we will select or 

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:08.440
 we will program the areas we want 

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:10.569
 that watering works 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.549
 there is nothing 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:17.260
 this is another job that we can 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:21.010
 find this in this electrical box 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.749
 is bigger than because it's done as 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.090
 you usually say the measure for this 

00:03:22.749 --> 00:03:27.670
 work because if it were for an office 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:29.450
 normal because it would be different from some 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:32.000
 thermal magnet 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:34.370
 the timeclock an answering a WORD 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.810
 of engine and this if I had focus the 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:39.819
 pool if I did not also have the way 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:44.000
 We would eliminate or that would be 1 1 2 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:45.500
 3 4 and 5 elements good that would be more 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.280
 of elements because they are double elements 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:51.620
 but good 5 components and it depends if 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:54.560
 it takes focus not apart from it would also lead 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:56.920
 your transformer then we would have the 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:00.819
 selector of 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:02.650
 manual 0 automatic and already in this case 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:04.060
 for the position when he has tension and 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.849
 when it 's up and running if I 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:10.270
 example the maceros this pilot was me 

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:13.520
 for it goes off and the pump goes off and 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:16.650
 also in the exchange of it 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:18.239
 from the pool 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:20.310
 the tension as we can observe 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:22.889
 is still on and if we cut the 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:25.050
 thermal magnet of the pool is us 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:26.900
 turn off and that would tell us not to 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.180
 I would have tension 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:31.550
 well then we put it automatic like the 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:34.340
 clock is off by no time 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:37.210
 turn it on we put it in manual and we 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.210
 puts it back on track 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:42.020
 well nothing 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:44.060
 I hope it serves someone many 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:47.150
 thank you if you have any questions ask 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:50.430
 or even if you want me to do some 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:52.470
 electrical scheme we do not care 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.750
 for that we are here to help each other 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:56.750
 everyone 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:58.480
 and learn from everyone too 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:03.270
 when well 

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:03.270
 thank you very much and until the next video
