options<00:04:27.400> I<00:04:27.520> thought<00:04:27.670> about<00:04:27.820> putting<00:04:28.000> a<00:04:28.150> tarp

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.330 
options I thought about putting a tarp

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.540 
options I thought about putting a tarp
over<00:04:28.480> this<00:04:28.750> but<00:04:28.960> I'm<00:04:29.050> afraid<00:04:29.860> that<00:04:30.250> the<00:04:30.310> wind

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
over this but I'm afraid that the wind

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:33.840 
over this but I'm afraid that the wind
is<00:04:30.940> going<00:04:31.750> to<00:04:31.810> blow<00:04:31.930> and<00:04:32.430> it<00:04:33.430> would<00:04:33.550> scratch

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:33.850 
is going to blow and it would scratch

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:37.440 
is going to blow and it would scratch
everything<00:04:34.180> up<00:04:35.820> really<00:04:36.820> wish<00:04:36.970> I<00:04:37.060> had<00:04:37.180> to<00:04:37.240> paint

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:37.450 
everything up really wish I had to paint

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:40.080 
everything up really wish I had to paint
but<00:04:37.570> that<00:04:37.810> would<00:04:37.900> be<00:04:37.960> great<00:04:38.790> if<00:04:39.790> I<00:04:39.910> had<00:04:40.060> a

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
but that would be great if I had a

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:43.590 
but that would be great if I had a
garage<00:04:40.240> that<00:04:41.140> would<00:04:41.260> be<00:04:41.380> excellent<00:04:42.160> too<00:04:42.600> but

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:43.600 
garage that would be excellent too but

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:44.670 
garage that would be excellent too but
