00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
good you know I could probably plant

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.190 
good you know I could probably plant
these<00:03:08.590> already<00:03:08.890> actually<00:03:09.129> and<00:03:09.670> I<00:03:10.599> may<00:03:10.780> just<00:03:11.079> do

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
these already actually and I may just do

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.449 
these already actually and I may just do
that<00:03:12.420> now<00:03:13.420> this<00:03:13.660> one<00:03:13.930> did<00:03:14.319> not<00:03:14.349> ruin<00:03:14.769> what<00:03:15.370> he

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:18.449 
that now this one did not ruin what he
suppose<00:03:15.700> happened<00:03:16.709> we<00:03:17.709> got<00:03:17.889> left<00:03:18.099> out<00:03:18.280> of<00:03:18.310> the

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
suppose happened we got left out of the

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:18.960 
suppose happened we got left out of the
water

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
water

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.960 
water
yep<00:03:19.780> a<00:03:19.989> little<00:03:20.319> shorter<00:03:20.739> I<00:03:20.920> didn't<00:03:21.730> have<00:03:21.849> it

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
yep a little shorter I didn't have it

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.569 
yep a little shorter I didn't have it
down<00:03:22.120> in<00:03:22.299> the<00:03:22.389> water<00:03:22.980> might<00:03:23.980> be<00:03:24.130> able<00:03:24.250> to<00:03:24.400> save

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:24.579 
down in the water might be able to save

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:26.039 
down in the water might be able to save
it<00:03:24.730> I<00:03:24.819> don't<00:03:25.000> know<00:03:25.150> that<00:03:25.599> the<00:03:25.690> that<00:03:25.840> one's

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:26.049 
it I don't know that the that one's

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:31.890 
it I don't know that the that one's
really<00:03:26.290> nice<00:03:28.980> and<00:03:29.980> there<00:03:30.220> we<00:03:30.340> go<00:03:30.519> you<00:03:30.900> know

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
really nice and there we go you know

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.270 
really nice and there we go you know
these<00:03:32.169> can<00:03:32.349> sit<00:03:32.590> in<00:03:32.680> the<00:03:32.739> water<00:03:32.919> for<00:03:33.250> quite

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
these can sit in the water for quite

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.099 
these can sit in the water for quite
some<00:03:33.730> time

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:34.109 
some time

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:38.039 
some time
but<00:03:35.109> I<00:03:35.319> actually<00:03:35.530> would<00:03:36.130> just<00:03:36.519> assume<00:03:37.049> get

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:38.049 
but I actually would just assume get

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:42.030 
but I actually would just assume get
them<00:03:38.260> in<00:03:38.440> some<00:03:38.730> dirt<00:03:40.200> but<00:03:41.200> to<00:03:41.440> transplant

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
them in some dirt but to transplant

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.009 
them in some dirt but to transplant
these<00:03:42.280> is<00:03:42.669> going<00:03:42.819> to<00:03:42.880> be<00:03:42.940> very<00:03:43.239> very<00:03:43.480> simple

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:44.019 
these is going to be very very simple

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:45.930 
these is going to be very very simple
and<00:03:44.230> I<00:03:44.859> think<00:03:44.889> I'm<00:03:45.280> going<00:03:45.430> to<00:03:45.489> put<00:03:45.700> them<00:03:45.790> in<00:03:45.910> a

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940 
and I think I'm going to put them in a

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:50.280 
and I think I'm going to put them in a
pot<00:03:46.919> similar<00:03:47.919> to<00:03:48.130> what<00:03:48.310> I<00:03:48.340> have<00:03:48.669> now<00:03:49.169> because<00:03:50.169> I

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
pot similar to what I have now because I

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.250 
pot similar to what I have now because I
really<00:03:50.590> like<00:03:50.799> them<00:03:50.980> in<00:03:51.310> that<00:03:52.109> career<00:03:53.109> I

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
really like them in that career I

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.440 
really like them in that career I
actually<00:03:53.829> use<00:03:54.220> those<00:03:54.430> for<00:03:54.669> terrariums<00:03:55.239> and

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
actually use those for terrariums and

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.979 
actually use those for terrariums and
they<00:03:56.200> look<00:03:56.380> really<00:03:56.590> good<00:03:57.450> but<00:03:58.450> I<00:03:58.510> put<00:03:58.690> this<00:03:58.810> in

00:03:58.979 --> 00:03:58.989
