 the website of the administration

 federal aviation 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:43.000
 www.efe.com advises parents that 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.000
 your children are subject to a system 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.340
 proper retention for children 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.020
 adapted based on his weight and height and 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.960
 they show a retention system 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.970
 approved by the government since it can 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.220
 have turbulence at any time 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:58.989
 the safest place for a child is a 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:02.920
 seat with restraint system for 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:04.930
 children not the lap of an adult 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.450
 be sure to check with the airline 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.509
 who travel because they usually have rules and 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:12.490
 special prices for babies and children 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:14.350
 for example the age of your son or daughter 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:17.049
 will determine if you need the approval 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.690
 in writing from a doctor to travel with 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:20.910
 the younger 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.920
 also keep in mind that traveling with 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.870
 a child restricts the seats where 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.820
 can sit due to regulations 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:28.820
 of the federal aviation administration 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.299
 if you can choose flights that match 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:37.549
 the nap time of your son or daughter 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.549
 maybe so I can rest something 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:43.280
 remember to take the toy and the 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:45.770
 Favorite blanket for your son or daughter 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.960
 and bring games and puzzles to help you 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.229
 occupy the time of your son or daughter in the 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.229
 airplane 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:55.030
 If you have to stop, ask for a 

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:57.850
 map of the airport to plan the 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:00.069
 connection in advance this will help you 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.340
 to locate services and restaurants with a 

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:04.829
 minimal effort 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.810
 I tried to imagine the trip through 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:09.539
 the eyes of your son or daughter everything 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:12.060
 possible that they are now better for him or 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:14.960
 she will be tired enough or 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.570
 tired to fall asleep 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:19.370
 while waiting to board anime to your 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:21.470
 son or daughter to consume all the 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:25.270
 possible energy so that it is more 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.270
 relaxed and tired during the trip 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.890
 have something on hand for your child or 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.620
 daughter eat or drink during takeoff and 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:35.970
 the swallowing or chewing landing can 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.970
 help him uncover his ears 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.580
 as usual if the fears of your 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.450
 son or daughter prevent him from leading a life 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:46.190
 full there is professional help available 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:49.540
 many psychologists recommend therapy 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:51.969
 of the game to overcome fears 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:54.569
 ask your son or daughter if he has 

00:02:51.969 --> 00:02:57.340
 some doubt about these experiences 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:03:00.659
 this could initiate a dialogue and a 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.659
 learning opportunity
