00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 and then everything breeze right here today 28 here 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:10.290
 To give a tip to you, very good to 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.809
 me it 's just fuck that the best 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.269
 closely damaging the best profile for 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.730
 you need to have this play with 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.199
 This guy will help you a lot - come on 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.150
 give a lot in your company 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:25.619
 I thought a classic knife would only go 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:31.349
 change everything and let's go to that advantage and 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:35.100
 if this is the best profile of the game is 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:37.430
 simply the o2 top month or the 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.930
 focus 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:43.020
 others simply this when you 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.820
 takes shot is an exchange of fire a gun 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.700
 Do not go up there. 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.950
 taking front of that leaps his 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.199
 gun for this fight is never much 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:57.449
 especially important in this game that 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:58.739
 You just die, you 're going to do a lot. 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.530
 difference for you 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:06.060
 first because I recommend second 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:09.689
 because that's what is fast with balcony 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.850
 fast attack you aim faster 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.920
 another thing that makes the difference a lot in 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.290
 google fight time then these two 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.360
 parks are the two best projects of the 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.070
 game are the essential fish that you 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.780
 you must always be with those two 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.810
 opinion projects 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.159
 In case you do not want to but in my 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.570
 opinion these are the two products 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:32.119
 essential 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:34.439
 so now let's go play the salt day 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:39.630
 helping with air 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:40.439
 this server or the stock in the games 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.320
 past 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:46.140
 he is very important for who plays dr 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.000
 He helps a lot in google fight. 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.850
 who does not know what he's doing is watching 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.640
 You can move turning more 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.680
 easy this game I found very strong you 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.840
 turns very fast and moves a lot 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.299
 fast then it is a very design 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.450
 important also if you travel there you 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:05.520
 do not play already r7 playing to climb 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.479
 you put the slayer got an oscar 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.789
 to win 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.090
 oh my God, but I like you a lot 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.810
 play I'm going to create a class that 's salt 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:17.290
 beauty and 6 3 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:20.890
 main players you need 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:24.160
 let's ride now start 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:27.459
 assault is to have all weapons with the shovel 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:30.220
 My favorite weapon is to get out of here. 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:31.360
 2010 she for me the best to open the 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.330
 game luck 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:38.769
 I really like to play with her and I play 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:42.690
 who plays with it a reflex and long that 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:42.690
 either it would be the local brake 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:50.410
 right here just no more 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.390
 I only use this sometimes it's good if I put 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:54.190
 this flu and sometimes it helps a little more 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:58.510
 I already started this one here as it is the same as 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:59.739
 she has almost no recall so one is 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:08.620
 very easy to control so do not 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:09.790
 Needs a lot of the same blow reflex 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.890
 in other media 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.660
 This here I think it can 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.760
 messing up will not help you much 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.200
 sometimes left this little blue 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.540
 that's cute 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.850
 Simple so I have not used guns 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.980
 secondary has not used lethal 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.120
 now you have to be playing species already 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.579
 or prospects 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.560
 There you go and create your class depends on 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:31.690
 your company is a very serious pulls a lot 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.359
 up and got a little more defensive 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:37.090
 It's too much I already have oscar winning 

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:38.590
 I always say without ammunition to recharge 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:40.569
 fast and 19 years 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:42.489
 In this game I'm really enjoying the 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:44.440
 space is making a sound rolls a lot 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:47.410
 good from the public far and the fucking dude 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:49.900
 I put this kind come and they 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.760
 now I only need now how much to create 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.959
 that the class stands want to place 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.310
 much stronger 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:56.950
 I'm not really sure what I got. 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:59.769
 put I always see it worth to remember 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:01.239
 putting it all just that I go 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:02.739
 putting became the attack from the beginning 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:06.579
 I'm going to put a class like it's 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:09.040
 play even fast recharge think 

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:10.209
 cool agility that can increase the 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.220
 my speed 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:13.989
 in marathon son marathon you run 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:16.780
 for much longer 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:19.510
 now where are you going to talk to each other and if 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:21.340
 from here invisible and jean has a class 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:24.130
 perfect to play and try to catch your 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:27.120
 Who is stabilized so that you liked it? 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:29.910
 do not forget these advantages here 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:34.199
 are the two main prizes of the game is 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:36.570
 the focus of what equals then for the pecs 

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:37.949
 great fucking helping a lot better 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:40.590
 too much respect did not start well 

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:41.910
 hard not to know any the focus 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:43.860
 I did not know what to do after 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:47.210
 I've been getting into the morning so I'm just waiting. 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:47.210
 Did you like the video I went to?
