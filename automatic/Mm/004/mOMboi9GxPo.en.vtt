material that the customer really really
likes<00:02:58.999> and<00:02:59.329> will<00:03:00.049> generate<00:03:00.499> a<00:03:00.560> silicone<00:03:01.040> mold

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:01.069 
likes and will generate a silicone mold

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:03.339 
likes and will generate a silicone mold
from<00:03:01.519> it<00:03:01.700> from<00:03:02.420> the<00:03:02.540> object<00:03:02.689> part<00:03:03.079> and<00:03:03.290> then

00:03:03.339 --> 00:03:03.349 
from it from the object part and then

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:04.959 
from it from the object part and then
cast<00:03:03.650> the<00:03:03.769> parts<00:03:04.069> on<00:03:04.159> any<00:03:04.310> type<00:03:04.519> of<00:03:04.549> material

of the client that's it so use an object
part<00:03:07.819> to<00:03:07.939> make<00:03:08.090> this<00:03:08.239> mold<00:03:08.510> absolutely<00:03:09.319> what's

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
part to make this mold absolutely what's

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.550 
part to make this mold absolutely what's
great<00:03:10.099> about<00:03:10.189> the<00:03:10.459> object<00:03:10.909> part<00:03:11.510> is<00:03:11.780> there's

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
great about the object part is there's
