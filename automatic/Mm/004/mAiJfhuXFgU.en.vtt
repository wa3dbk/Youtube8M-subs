you know their cardiac cath report their
x-rays<00:00:43.579> images<00:00:44.180> everything<00:00:44.540> that<00:00:44.840> you<00:00:44.989> need

x-rays images everything that you need
at<00:00:45.440> the<00:00:45.770> touch<00:00:45.920> of<00:00:46.070> a<00:00:46.160> button<00:00:46.840> if<00:00:47.840> that<00:00:48.170> comes

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:48.410 
at the touch of a button if that comes

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.540 
at the touch of a button if that comes
about<00:00:48.649> that's<00:00:49.010> a<00:00:49.160> beautiful<00:00:49.399> thing<00:00:49.760> I<00:00:51.550> would

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.550 
about that's a beautiful thing I would

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.770 
about that's a beautiful thing I would
hope<00:00:52.940> that<00:00:54.070> there<00:00:55.070> would<00:00:55.340> be<00:00:55.450> not<00:00:56.450> an

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 
hope that there would be not an

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.139 
hope that there would be not an
Associated<00:00:57.469> upgrade<00:00:57.980> cost<00:00:58.370> and<00:00:58.850> all<00:00:58.969> the

00:00:59.139 --> 00:00:59.149 
Associated upgrade cost and all the

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:00.459 
Associated upgrade cost and all the
other<00:00:59.270> things<00:00:59.539> that<00:00:59.660> goes<00:00:59.870> with<00:01:00.110> that

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:00.469 
other things that goes with that

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:03.369 
other things that goes with that
I<00:01:00.500> think<00:01:00.969> EMR<00:01:01.969> can<00:01:02.360> be<00:01:02.510> very<00:01:02.750> useful<00:01:02.809> in

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:03.379 
I think EMR can be very useful in

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:05.710 
I think EMR can be very useful in
standardizing<00:01:03.980> medical<00:01:04.879> reports<00:01:05.390> across

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
standardizing medical reports across

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.859 
standardizing medical reports across
patient<00:01:06.259> groups<00:01:06.470> the<00:01:07.310> problem<00:01:07.610> is<00:01:07.700> it<00:01:08.660> takes<00:01:08.690> a

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:08.869 
patient groups the problem is it takes a

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:10.900 
patient groups the problem is it takes a
lot<00:01:08.990> of<00:01:09.020> time<00:01:09.289> I<00:01:09.619> find<00:01:10.280> that<00:01:10.520> patient

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:10.910 
lot of time I find that patient

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:12.969 
lot of time I find that patient
physicians<00:01:11.840> are<00:01:12.020> spending<00:01:12.380> as<00:01:12.530> much<00:01:12.560> time

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
physicians are spending as much time

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:14.680 
physicians are spending as much time
with<00:01:13.130> the<00:01:13.250> patient<00:01:13.700> as<00:01:13.820> they<00:01:13.970> are<00:01:14.149> documenting

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:14.690 
with the patient as they are documenting

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:20.100 
with the patient as they are documenting
on<00:01:15.439> EMR<00:01:15.979> and<00:01:17.290> you<00:01:18.290> know<00:01:18.439> there's<00:01:18.680> got<00:01:18.890> to<00:01:19.070> be

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.110 
on EMR and you know there's got to be

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.320 
on EMR and you know there's got to be
some<00:01:21.110> improvement<00:01:21.619> in<00:01:21.710> that<00:01:21.920> area<00:01:22.280> but<00:01:23.150> I<00:01:23.210> do

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 
some improvement in that area but I do

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.850 
some improvement in that area but I do
think<00:01:23.720> that<00:01:24.820> EMR<00:01:25.820> will<00:01:26.689> improve<00:01:27.200> healthcare

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 
think that EMR will improve healthcare

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.530 
think that EMR will improve healthcare
in<00:01:28.400> the<00:01:28.580> long<00:01:28.790> run<00:01:29.890> and<00:01:30.890> I<00:01:31.580> think<00:01:32.450> it's

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
in the long run and I think it's

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.260 
in the long run and I think it's
inevitable<00:01:33.189> just<00:01:34.189> with<00:01:34.430> the<00:01:34.640> way<00:01:34.759> the<00:01:35.000> society

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
inevitable just with the way the society

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.390 
inevitable just with the way the society
is<00:01:35.600> going<00:01:35.750> towards<00:01:36.259> more<00:01:36.439> of<00:01:36.500> a<00:01:36.650> technological

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:37.400 
is going towards more of a technological

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.560 
is going towards more of a technological
state<00:01:38.270> I<00:01:38.600> mean<00:01:39.140> I<00:01:39.640> think<00:01:40.640> some<00:01:41.060> physicians

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
state I mean I think some physicians

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.380 
state I mean I think some physicians
would<00:01:41.840> frankly<00:01:42.470> prefer<00:01:42.890> the<00:01:43.100> good<00:01:43.280> old<00:01:43.400> pencil

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
would frankly prefer the good old pencil

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.950 
would frankly prefer the good old pencil
and<00:01:44.780> paper<00:01:46.030> and<00:01:47.030> talking<00:01:47.420> to<00:01:47.479> the<00:01:47.570> patient

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
and paper and talking to the patient

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.410 
and paper and talking to the patient
spending<00:01:48.259> more<00:01:48.350> time<00:01:48.590> with<00:01:48.829> them<00:01:49.040> and<00:01:49.420> forming

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
spending more time with them and forming

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.620 
spending more time with them and forming
the<00:01:50.540> bond<00:01:50.750> but<00:01:51.140> unfortunately<00:01:52.329> it's<00:01:53.329> not<00:01:53.509> in

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
the bond but unfortunately it's not in

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.679 
the bond but unfortunately it's not in
our<00:01:53.750> hands<00:01:53.990> anymore<00:01:54.320> I<00:01:54.680> mean<00:01:55.670> we're<00:01:56.119> having<00:01:56.390> to

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:56.689 
our hands anymore I mean we're having to

00:01:56.689 --> 00:01:59.920 
our hands anymore I mean we're having to
do<00:01:56.840> it<00:01:57.040> some<00:01:58.040> are<00:01:58.310> more<00:01:58.729> easily<00:01:59.180> adaptable<00:01:59.630> to

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
do it some are more easily adaptable to

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.219 
do it some are more easily adaptable to
it<00:02:00.049> than<00:02:00.229> others<00:02:01.360> and<00:02:02.360> it<00:02:02.509> is<00:02:02.630> taking<00:02:02.960> up<00:02:03.049> time

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
it than others and it is taking up time

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:05.920 
it than others and it is taking up time
but<00:02:03.710> I<00:02:04.040> don't<00:02:04.970> think<00:02:05.180> there's<00:02:05.299> anywhere<00:02:05.540> any

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930 
but I don't think there's anywhere any

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.979 
but I don't think there's anywhere any
way<00:02:06.140> out<00:02:06.380> I<00:02:06.740> may<00:02:07.219> be<00:02:07.399> in<00:02:07.790> consult<00:02:08.360> sometimes<00:02:08.810> we

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:08.989 
way out I may be in consult sometimes we

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:11.289
