00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.430
 hello everyone I'm a little welcome 777 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.779
 the shift now in economic lakes 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.460
 legends in which a little more 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.410
 difficult to find the counterpart 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.200
 economic this time it seems to me that 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.610
 found a pretty decent one e 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.410
 so before you start, remember 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.570
 put I like this video to have 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.160
 other economic gems and I remind you of 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.570
 then suggest another point 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.310
 the economic agenda that you would like 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:28.199
 see to whom economic is de bruyn tell you 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.740
 which was practically impossible to find 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.899
 a Romanian coc is useless because of it 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.460
 they are two there is maxim there is another in 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.829
 just to say where it looks like, there are 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.790
 only two 10 13 from down 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.850
 however we now see the 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:45.270
 speed statistics 84 of the municipalities 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:48.390
 in 79 dribbling 85 of the legend against 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.730
 83 de bruyn so the speed is a 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:54.660
 in a bit distant then not even so much 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.129
 dribbling instead we are there 2 shot 85 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.989
 against 81 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.300
 here there is here I had to find one 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.840
 player who had dribbling pass 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:06.150
 and throw here if i found players who 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.670
 they had shot they hadn't passed maybe 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.930
 vice versa, therefore , that passage must be well 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.710
 it is not so far 3 2 he defends it 42 42 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:17.520
 passage that is the fundamental thing 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:20.369
 according to me 88 of needles control 83 of de 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.310
 bruyn and finally tombstone trip 66 against 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:26.009
 the 70 so many are similar a little less 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.450
 obviously the weakened version though 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.650
 to make you understand well let's see 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.420
 in-game statistics 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.009
 so let's put aside a moment 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.290
 bruyn we go to see the best of 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.850
 needles such as the 88 control 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.540
 90 ball of kroos as there are 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:42.030
 a lot of the 86 dribbles 92 punishments 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.430
 91 rigor with toto short pass here 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.820
 lynskey the first the first column which 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:50.070
 you really see a little absurd stuff 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.899
 minus the other column you see as 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.579
 the acceleration is not very high though 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.500
 however 84 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:59.219
 then we have vision for a cycle of 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:02.040
 server total statistics in game 2.123 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:05.520
 de bruyn instead has some of his best 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:09.119
 control paolo 85 dribbling 84 passes 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:11.970
 long 83 long shot 84 place of that 85 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.530
 could also say a column here 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.930
 good 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.850
 green enough so many orange things 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:20.209
 however, punishments are a lot 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:22.190
 away from each other between the two, however, even the rigors 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:25.280
 anyway, it's a good thing that these are things 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:27.530
 which says punishments rigorous things from 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.030
 still pure de bruyn pecks a little 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.920
 on the other side it has no acceleration 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:34.069
 however very high he goes he doesn't know is not 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:37.250
 very fast vision that at the end 83 rs 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:40.280
 we are there total statistics in game 2020 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.390
 there are 100 of difference 103 true 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.760
 precision is a little bit 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:46.160
 but a good thing is the weakest 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.739
 because it is a strong thing of both 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.560
 and in fact 55 are the stars instead 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:53.780
 four and four skills are entered 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.209
 then 54 54 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:03:01.220
 the price instead of needles is between 210 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:03.739
 thousand and 310 thousand de bruyn 356,000 as 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.600
 you are always no difference now 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:07.370
 seeing my own my own against mine 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.230
 final vote on the card 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.580
 I still remind you to let me know here 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.870
 below in the comments 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.850
 another legend that you would like 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.200
 see, however , not many are missing 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:17.630
 however I still continue a little bit 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.640
 this series and if you put them liked 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:24.190
 crying written to my channel and comments 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:24.190
 from bonsai 77 all hello to everyone
