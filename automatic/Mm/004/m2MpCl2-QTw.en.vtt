00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
I've just announced a brand new game

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.169 
I've just announced a brand new game
mode<00:00:10.019> called<00:00:10.219> supremacy<00:00:11.219> so<00:00:11.519> basically<00:00:11.940> this

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
mode called supremacy so basically this

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.749 
mode called supremacy so basically this
is<00:00:12.240> a<00:00:12.590> simpler<00:00:13.590> version<00:00:13.620> of<00:00:14.070> conquest<00:00:14.519> from

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
is a simpler version of conquest from

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.939 
is a simpler version of conquest from
battlefield<00:00:15.360> it's<00:00:16.080> five<00:00:16.350> points<00:00:16.740> on<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:16.920> map

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
battlefield it's five points on the map

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.769 
battlefield it's five points on the map
and<00:00:17.310> it's<00:00:17.789> a<00:00:17.850> very<00:00:17.880> large<00:00:18.300> map<00:00:18.600> as<00:00:18.750> well

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
and it's a very large map as well

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.070 
and it's a very large map as well
includes<00:00:19.650> vehicles<00:00:20.070> and<00:00:20.279> heroes<00:00:20.910> so<00:00:21.570> you

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
includes vehicles and heroes so you

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.080 
includes vehicles and heroes so you
start<00:00:22.380> off<00:00:22.470> with<00:00:22.680> two<00:00:22.859> points<00:00:23.220> each<00:00:23.340> each<00:00:23.760> team

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
start off with two points each each team

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.970 
start off with two points each each team
and<00:00:24.359> in<00:00:24.990> one<00:00:25.080> has<00:00:25.170> to<00:00:25.260> go<00:00:25.350> for<00:00:25.500> a<00:00:25.560> central<00:00:25.830> point

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
and in one has to go for a central point

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.830 
and in one has to go for a central point
there's<00:00:26.340> no<00:00:26.490> like<00:00:26.699> I'm<00:00:27.000> going<00:00:27.539> to<00:00:27.599> sneak

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
there's no like I'm going to sneak

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.240 
there's no like I'm going to sneak
around<00:00:27.960> a<00:00:28.140> back<00:00:28.320> and<00:00:28.500> take<00:00:28.619> the<00:00:28.740> back<00:00:28.920> point

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
around a back and take the back point

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.189 
around a back and take the back point
it's<00:00:29.849> all<00:00:30.060> about<00:00:30.090> that<00:00:30.359> central<00:00:30.900> point

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
it's all about that central point

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.290 
it's all about that central point
everyone's<00:00:31.980> going<00:00:32.189> into<00:00:32.340> that<00:00:32.430> confronting

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
everyone's going into that confronting

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.240 
everyone's going into that confronting
moment<00:00:33.809> and<00:00:33.989> attacking<00:00:34.260> each<00:00:34.469> other<00:00:34.559> so<00:00:35.130> it's

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
moment and attacking each other so it's

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.979 
moment and attacking each other so it's
always<00:00:35.340> a<00:00:35.489> little<00:00:35.969> bit<00:00:36.149> more<00:00:36.210> simpler<00:00:36.570> there's

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
always a little bit more simpler there's

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.060 
always a little bit more simpler there's
a<00:00:37.079> lot<00:00:37.110> battlefield<00:00:37.620> we<00:00:37.739> could<00:00:37.890> be<00:00:37.950> a<00:00:37.980> little

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
a lot battlefield we could be a little

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.139 
a lot battlefield we could be a little
bit<00:00:38.219> stealth<00:00:38.460> weakest<00:00:38.790> crap<00:00:38.969> in<00:00:39.090> two

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
bit stealth weakest crap in two

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.819 
bit stealth weakest crap in two
different<00:00:39.300> teams<00:00:39.600> this<00:00:40.410> will<00:00:40.559> take<00:00:40.680> different

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
different teams this will take different

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.220 
different teams this will take different
points<00:00:41.370> this<00:00:41.940> is<00:00:42.000> about<00:00:42.180> one<00:00:42.480> singular<00:00:42.840> point

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
points this is about one singular point

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.380 
points this is about one singular point
every<00:00:43.829> team<00:00:44.040> has<00:00:44.190> a<00:00:44.250> own<00:00:44.640> point<00:00:44.910> to<00:00:45.000> defend

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
every team has a own point to defend

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.479 
every team has a own point to defend
also<00:00:45.840> their<00:00:45.960> own<00:00:46.079> point<00:00:46.320> to<00:00:46.440> attack<00:00:46.800> so<00:00:47.340> it's

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
also their own point to attack so it's

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.220 
also their own point to attack so it's
very<00:00:47.610> very<00:00:47.700> focused<00:00:48.329> well<00:00:48.840> this<00:00:48.930> is<00:00:48.960> really

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
very very focused well this is really

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.479 
very very focused well this is really
good<00:00:49.440> because<00:00:49.530> I<00:00:49.710> guess<00:00:49.860> people<00:00:50.190> like<00:00:50.219> to

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
good because I guess people like to

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.700 
good because I guess people like to
either<00:00:50.730> defend<00:00:51.149> or<00:00:51.570> be<00:00:51.719> aggressive<00:00:52.230> the

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
either defend or be aggressive the

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.020 
either defend or be aggressive the
fenders<00:00:53.010> can<00:00:53.129> hand<00:00:53.340> back<00:00:53.520> with<00:00:53.760> that<00:00:53.879> list

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
fenders can hand back with that list

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.000 
fenders can hand back with that list
sniper<00:00:54.270> rifles<00:00:54.750> or<00:00:54.989> more<00:00:55.199> defensive<00:00:55.680> weapons

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
sniper rifles or more defensive weapons

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.860 
sniper rifles or more defensive weapons
and<00:00:56.640> back<00:00:56.820> and<00:00:56.969> to<00:00:57.059> try<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:57.270> defend<00:00:57.570> the

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
and back and to try and defend the

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.990 
and back and to try and defend the
aggressive<00:00:58.559> people<00:00:58.680> can<00:00:58.980> go<00:00:59.250> full<00:00:59.489> into<00:00:59.910> like

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
aggressive people can go full into like

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.819 
aggressive people can go full into like
a<00:01:00.030> separate<00:01:00.420> team<00:01:00.570> has<00:01:01.170> just<00:01:01.379> attacked<00:01:01.500> that

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
a separate team has just attacked that

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.910 
a separate team has just attacked that
one<00:01:02.070> point<00:01:02.460> for<00:01:03.390> lon<00:01:03.680> so<00:01:04.680> this<00:01:04.799> particular

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
one point for lon so this particular

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.010 
one point for lon so this particular
mode<00:01:05.369> will<00:01:05.549> take<00:01:05.729> place<00:01:05.880> on<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.390> largest<00:01:06.810> maps

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
mode will take place on the largest maps

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.649 
mode will take place on the largest maps
on<00:01:07.200> battlefront<00:01:07.890> which<00:01:08.010> is<00:01:08.130> very<00:01:08.310> exciting

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:08.659 
on battlefront which is very exciting

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:11.000 
on battlefront which is very exciting
this<00:01:09.659> will<00:01:09.810> include<00:01:10.020> vehicles<00:01:10.560> so<00:01:10.830> the

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
this will include vehicles so the

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.179 
this will include vehicles so the
walkers<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.909> x-wings<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.600> Thai<00:01:12.780> fires<00:01:13.189> but

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
walkers the x-wings the Thai fires but

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.560 
walkers the x-wings the Thai fires but
it<00:01:14.280> would<00:01:14.369> depend<00:01:14.490> on<00:01:14.760> what<00:01:14.880> map<00:01:15.090> you<00:01:15.210> plan<00:01:15.420> on

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
it would depend on what map you plan on

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.660 
it would depend on what map you plan on
so<00:01:15.810> depend<00:01:16.229> on<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.380> map<00:01:16.560> will<00:01:16.830> include<00:01:17.400> from

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
so depend on the map will include from

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.100 
so depend on the map will include from
vehicles<00:01:18.060> and<00:01:18.360> that<00:01:18.450> sort<00:01:18.659> of<00:01:18.689> stuff<00:01:18.750> which<00:01:19.080> is

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
vehicles and that sort of stuff which is

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.990 
vehicles and that sort of stuff which is
which<00:01:20.040> is<00:01:20.070> exciting<00:01:20.340> because<00:01:20.490> I've<00:01:20.700> see<00:01:20.820> once

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
which is exciting because I've see once

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.370 
which is exciting because I've see once
you<00:01:21.119> get<00:01:21.240> used<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.540> maps<00:01:21.780> you<00:01:21.930> so<00:01:22.080> know

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
you get used to the maps you so know

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.870 
you get used to the maps you so know
what<00:01:22.409> vehicles<00:01:23.009> will<00:01:23.100> be<00:01:23.130> on<00:01:23.280> that<00:01:23.400> map<00:01:23.610> and

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
what vehicles will be on that map and

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.870 
what vehicles will be on that map and
silver<00:01:24.630> plan<00:01:25.200> your<00:01:25.380> tactics<00:01:25.799> around<00:01:26.070> that<00:01:26.280> it

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
silver plan your tactics around that it

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.330 
silver plan your tactics around that it
really<00:01:27.180> does<00:01:27.330> seem<00:01:27.570> like<00:01:27.650> bow<00:01:28.650> front<00:01:29.009> is<00:01:29.189> the

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
really does seem like bow front is the

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.149 
really does seem like bow front is the
more<00:01:29.490> simplistic<00:01:30.020> battlefield<00:01:31.020> which<00:01:31.799> for<00:01:32.040> me

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
more simplistic battlefield which for me

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.230 
more simplistic battlefield which for me
is<00:01:32.189> personally<00:01:32.700> quite<00:01:32.880> exciting<00:01:33.210> because

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
is personally quite exciting because

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.480 
is personally quite exciting because
like<00:01:33.479> I<00:01:33.600> said<00:01:33.720> before<00:01:33.869> I<00:01:34.290> am<00:01:34.799> very<00:01:35.130> much<00:01:35.340> an

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
like I said before I am very much an

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.249 
like I said before I am very much an
uber<00:01:35.759> battlefield<00:01:36.240> I<00:01:36.420> just<00:01:36.659> can't<00:01:36.960> seem<00:01:37.229> to

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
uber battlefield I just can't seem to

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.140 
uber battlefield I just can't seem to
handle<00:01:37.500> it<00:01:37.770> I've<00:01:37.979> played<00:01:38.250> it<00:01:38.369> for<00:01:38.400> a<00:01:38.549> while<00:01:38.759> I

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
handle it I've played it for a while I

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.480 
handle it I've played it for a while I
can't<00:01:39.810> drive<00:01:40.140> a<00:01:40.200> jet<00:01:40.530> fighter<00:01:40.740> I<00:01:41.040> can't<00:01:41.340> do

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
can't drive a jet fighter I can't do

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.639 
can't drive a jet fighter I can't do
anything<00:01:41.670> so<00:01:42.060> jump<00:01:42.659> into<00:01:42.840> battle<00:01:43.229> front<00:01:43.470> is

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
anything so jump into battle front is

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.560 
anything so jump into battle front is
more<00:01:44.100> simplistic<00:01:44.520> and<00:01:44.939> a<00:01:44.970> saint<00:01:45.149> like<00:01:45.240> a<00:01:45.299> sort

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
more simplistic and a saint like a sort

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.330 
more simplistic and a saint like a sort
easy<00:01:45.750> dumped<00:01:46.049> into<00:01:46.229> for<00:01:46.979> a<00:01:47.009> couple<00:01:47.189> of<00:01:47.220> hours

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
easy dumped into for a couple of hours

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.160 
easy dumped into for a couple of hours
and<00:01:47.610> actually<00:01:47.850> enjoy<00:01:47.970> myself<00:01:48.270> but<00:01:48.899> I'm<00:01:48.990> sure

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
and actually enjoy myself but I'm sure

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.510 
and actually enjoy myself but I'm sure
some<00:01:49.439> like<00:01:49.590> proper<00:01:49.890> like<00:01:50.070> hardcore

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
some like proper like hardcore

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.880 
some like proper like hardcore
battlefield<00:01:51.329> players<00:01:51.600> will<00:01:51.750> be<00:01:51.840> like<00:01:51.990> this<00:01:52.740> is

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
battlefield players will be like this is

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.530 
battlefield players will be like this is
a<00:01:52.920> little<00:01:53.189> bit<00:01:53.280> too<00:01:53.430> simplistic<00:01:54.030> and<00:01:54.299> it's

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
a little bit too simplistic and it's

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.149 
a little bit too simplistic and it's
like<00:01:54.689> no<00:01:54.899> much<00:01:55.110> tactics<00:01:55.590> you<00:01:55.710> can<00:01:55.740> do<00:01:55.950> it's

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
like no much tactics you can do it's

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.639 
like no much tactics you can do it's
pretty<00:01:56.430> much<00:01:56.700> be<00:01:57.509> aggressive<00:01:58.020> or<00:01:58.590> defensive

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
pretty much be aggressive or defensive

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.859 
pretty much be aggressive or defensive
and<00:01:59.340> it's<00:01:59.490> very<00:01:59.729> very<00:01:59.759> linear<00:02:00.149> which<00:02:00.420> is<00:02:00.600> I

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
and it's very very linear which is I

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.380 
and it's very very linear which is I
don't<00:02:01.770> know<00:02:01.920> I<00:02:02.219> think<00:02:02.579> that's<00:02:02.700> ok<00:02:02.880> for<00:02:02.909> myself

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
don't know I think that's ok for myself

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.789 
don't know I think that's ok for myself
but<00:02:03.630> people<00:02:03.930> that<00:02:04.049> perhaps<00:02:04.290> a<00:02:04.530> little<00:02:04.619> bit

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
but people that perhaps a little bit

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.639 
but people that perhaps a little bit
more<00:02:04.890> hardcore<00:02:05.340> may<00:02:06.149> be<00:02:06.210> disappointed<00:02:06.930> also

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
more hardcore may be disappointed also

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.109 
more hardcore may be disappointed also
the<00:02:07.770> heroes<00:02:08.099> will<00:02:08.280> be<00:02:08.310> back<00:02:08.580> for<00:02:08.819> this<00:02:08.879> mode

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
the heroes will be back for this mode

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.600 
the heroes will be back for this mode

pet that face like a lot of help looks

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:19.009 
pet that face like a lot of help looks
like<00:02:16.890> a<00:02:16.980> special<00:02:17.370> saw<00:02:17.519> ability<00:02:18.120> they<00:02:18.690> can<00:02:18.840> last

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
like a special saw ability they can last

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:20.809 
like a special saw ability they can last
for<00:02:19.170> quite<00:02:19.260> a<00:02:19.319> while<00:02:19.530> which<00:02:19.590> is<00:02:19.890> definitely<00:02:20.519> a

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
for quite a while which is definitely a

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:23.449 
for quite a while which is definitely a
plus<00:02:21.060> Lou<00:02:21.840> scopus<00:02:22.230> but<00:02:22.379> use<00:02:22.560> that<00:02:22.739> force<00:02:23.129> push

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
plus Lou scopus but use that force push

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:25.820 
plus Lou scopus but use that force push
and<00:02:23.730> stuff<00:02:23.940> so<00:02:24.209> it<00:02:24.900> will<00:02:25.049> push<00:02:25.260> away<00:02:25.379> the<00:02:25.470> enemy

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
and stuff so it will push away the enemy

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.949 
and stuff so it will push away the enemy
and<00:02:26.370> is<00:02:26.580> just<00:02:26.700> like<00:02:26.819> avance<00:02:27.480> very<00:02:27.840> very

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
and is just like avance very very

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:29.270 
and is just like avance very very
quickly<00:02:28.140> so<00:02:28.440> the<00:02:28.530> heroes<00:02:28.799> will<00:02:28.920> be<00:02:28.980> very<00:02:29.220> very

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
quickly so the heroes will be very very

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.190 
quickly so the heroes will be very very
bored<00:02:29.610> in<00:02:29.790> this<00:02:29.849> mode<00:02:30.090> try<00:02:30.750> and<00:02:30.840> capture<00:02:31.019> those

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
bored in this mode try and capture those

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.949 
bored in this mode try and capture those
points<00:02:31.709> as<00:02:32.190> quick<00:02:32.430> as<00:02:32.549> possible<00:02:32.750> so<00:02:33.750> like<00:02:33.870> I

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
points as quick as possible so like I

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:35.539 
points as quick as possible so like I
said<00:02:34.019> the<00:02:34.290> match<00:02:34.470> will<00:02:34.769> last<00:02:35.069> around<00:02:35.220> 10

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:35.549 
said the match will last around 10

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:37.130 
said the match will last around 10
minutes<00:02:35.730> of<00:02:35.849> apparently<00:02:36.299> you<00:02:36.420> can<00:02:36.569> gain<00:02:36.810> time

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
minutes of apparently you can gain time

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.500 
minutes of apparently you can gain time
or<00:02:37.349> lose<00:02:37.560> time<00:02:37.830> depending<00:02:38.670> like<00:02:38.819> who<00:02:39.060> captures

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
or lose time depending like who captures

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.900 
or lose time depending like who captures
what<00:02:39.660> went<00:02:39.930> so<00:02:40.140> that's<00:02:40.769> a<00:02:40.890> factor<00:02:41.310> but<00:02:41.340> I<00:02:41.670> guess

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
what went so that's a factor but I guess

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.280 
what went so that's a factor but I guess
the<00:02:42.060> game<00:02:42.180> will<00:02:42.299> be<00:02:42.360> around<00:02:42.540> 10<00:02:42.840> minutes<00:02:43.019> long

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
the game will be around 10 minutes long

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.020 
the game will be around 10 minutes long
which<00:02:43.500> is<00:02:43.860> around<00:02:44.280> the<00:02:44.459> right<00:02:44.610> amount<00:02:44.940> of

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
which is around the right amount of

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.220 
which is around the right amount of
think<00:02:45.239> it's<00:02:45.390> not<00:02:45.480> too<00:02:45.690> long<00:02:45.870> not<00:02:45.930> too<00:02:46.200> short

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
think it's not too long not too short

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.619 
think it's not too long not too short
and<00:02:46.709> and<00:02:47.489> yeah<00:02:47.640> I'm<00:02:47.819> excited<00:02:47.970> its<00:02:48.329> mode<00:02:48.480> it

00:02:48.619 --> 00:02:48.629 
and and yeah I'm excited its mode it
