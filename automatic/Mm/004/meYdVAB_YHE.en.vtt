00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:10.149
 We're going to need oaxaca cheese pumpkins 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:15.780
 and four eggs with yolk and white 

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:15.780
 separated 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:22.590
 for the sauce I used 7 tomatoes branches a 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:26.340
 small piece of onion a tooth of 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.140
 garlic and two serrano chiles here we cut 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.750
 We put the tomatoes in the blender 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:34.860
 when we finished and we added the 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:37.530
 Chill the onion and garlic and the last one 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.920
 add a cup of water 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:46.100
 add the little oil to your pan and 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.100
 light the stove on medium-high heat 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:53.060
 since the oil is hot add the 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:56.450
 salsa and if you feel that you are missing 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:59.120
 more watery this can put more water 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:02.160
 and if they like it that way they can 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.890
 leave and no longer let more 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.790
 low fire and now yes to prepare 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.820
 our pumpkins 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:13.670
 let's take our zucchini and 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:17.060
 let's cut the edges of the two 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.600
 sides and along we're going to start 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:23.670
 half 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:28.170
 well and then take a spoon and remove 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:30.690
 the carnita of the medium carefully like this 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.720
 as I am doing here take your 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:32.720
 weather 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.259
 ah 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.770
 now you have to fill the pumpkin 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.530
 with the cheese it is and the cheese is very 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:10.740
 big this cut not so that it fits well 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.900
 in the pumpkin and they just put in 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.550
 of the pumpkin and then they will take the 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:18.170
 two parts of the pumpkin and they're going to 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:20.810
 attach as well as what I'm doing here 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.720
 and so that the pumpkins do not open 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:26.080
 let's secure with a toothpick in each 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.080
 side 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:43.090
 Now you have to beat the egg whites 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:46.180
 until they are about to nougat 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:50.730
 since they are mixed add the yolk of 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.730
 egg one by one slowly 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:03:02.069
 add a little oil to a pan and 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:02.069
 light your stove over medium-high heat 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:08.040
 I have to quote the egg and bathe 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.040
 all right 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:14.519
 and then carefully add to the 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.519
 oil 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:22.450
 cooking the pumpkins and turning the 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:25.450
 until the egg is completely 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.450
 Cooked 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.670
 since your pumpkins are ready 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:38.440
 add the here to the sauce so that it 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.440
 finish well to cook the pumpkin 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:45.010
 you have to cover them and let them cost 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.349
 all right 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:50.440
 10 to 15 minutes until you 

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:52.660
 think that at the same time be ready now 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.200
