00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 hello welcome to my 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.080
 staggers we make one today 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.880
 it will be one of them 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.700
 completely scary remainder utilization 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.530
 because we baked biscuits today and 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.929
 Since we only needed money cut 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.699
 we have a lot of protein left over 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.130
 This protein can now either 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.660
 For example, make a pablo warthe 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.340
 as I have done before 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.390
 which is incredibly delicious and the 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.050
 you should definitely 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.510
 try out 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.090
 the recipe I link to you here or 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.710
 you can make small pc and piece 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.570
 Here we have some inspiration 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.270
 leave the magazine and be 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.940
 halloween a few today 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.680
 make scary ghosts and to me and 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.780
 I 'll show you the same now 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.739
 few ingredients and then show you how 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:49.890
 it continues immediately 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:52.590
 we have three wise men here than 150 super 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.570
 and it counts per 150 grams of sugar 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.420
 that's why it does not matter how much you have left 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.670
 just take 150 grams per sugar 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.010
 then we set and phone gap 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.000
 strength and a pinch of salt help 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.000
 namely that the protein structures 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.619
 is destroyed faster 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.750
 Now we give the protein first 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.640
 put the salt in the mixing bowl and leave 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.790
 Stir it until the egg white 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.500
 Stiff is and gradually comes 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.479
 the sugar with pure and then we have to 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.369
 this mixture for about four minutes 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.310
 stir until the sugar is in it 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:26.310
 In the end, one should have resolved 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.600
 bc solid mass have arisen and then 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.939
 Can we get the food strength 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.270
 fold in and then this is meringue 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.049
 already ready to inject 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:37.320
 Now I have him a pouch 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:40.970
 having a school with was huge and 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.970
 I'm stuck here in mine 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:47.000
 pÃ¶lten stand so I have both 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:49.970
 Hands free and now this wm off 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.750
 then with the injection bag on speaks 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.520
 Now I just take one 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.149
 second card and pushes it all 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.710
 ahead 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:02:01.220
 then I'll do that back there 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:05.929
 do not get dirty now will be turned 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:08.700
 almost always in front 

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:10.259
 and now you can either do this 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.590
 meringue massa directly on the baking paper 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:15.150
 Just inject so circular or 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.250
 English as an aid and I think so 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.720
 now especially good these opladen 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.030
 You can buy it for the whole year 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.519
 the net supply kitchen and it is even 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.900
 you know opladen and opladen yes 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:26.700
 actually from the christmas bakery 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.590
 but there is also the whole yes 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.269
 you can not submitted again 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.370
 Must have macaroons or cocoa macaroons 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:34.680
 but you can just to 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.780
 example also use this evil 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:41.580
 to make spirits that I take s 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:44.040
 paper which is on the table too 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.810
 I now have a wafer 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.660
 and have therefore been a nice 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:54.390
 Round circle came out and can now 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:56.660
 start from the outside and then in the middle 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.660
 once 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:10.670
 By the way, my wafers have one 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:12.890
 diameter of 50 mm than 5 cm and the 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:16.060
 but there are also in small series 40 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.060
 mm for example 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:41.640
 Duisburg on www just was not 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:43.830
 hard okay and rebecca are now 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.900
 finished sprayed and so they are allowed 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:47.610
 now dry on the tin in the oven 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.489
 I wanted to do that for air 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:51.090
 at 70 degrees and they need about 90 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:52.920
 minutes 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.090
 if you do not have one around the oven 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.020
 can you just upper and 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.180
 take heat 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:58.680
 then takes about 90 degrees and next 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.380
 also 90 minutes 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.910
 you also recognize if the bc kaska finished 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:08.790
 are dried if you just times 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:10.080
 on it knocks us well and 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.590
 we'll let it dry now and then 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:16.919
 Let's see the building office again 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:20.130
 and made to see are ours 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:22.260
 Enthister and Sandra still mark 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:24.540
 a few eyes on it and that we take 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.790
 simply this fitting color is in fact 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:28.950
 now free and style just come 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:30.600

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.770
 color is given on it the colors are 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:36.150
 You can get a lot of weight here now 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:38.220
 just paint with a brush 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:40.740
 apply either only two eyes 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:43.940
 confused with me or just a whole 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.940
 Face off like here 

00:04:58.689 --> 00:05:05.229

00:05:03.059 --> 00:05:06.999
 We hope that this recipe 

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:09.069

00:05:06.999 --> 00:05:10.889
 Idea and loser and I will now
