00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:13.080
 and then people singing with one more mold 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:17.340
 Is this even if you are not the love of 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:20.189
 rpc 1.4.2 cost that leaves the team with 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.570
 alexandre in the description also involves the 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:29.150
 link from my other video that is not even 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:37.350
 a moody nÃ© 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:53.489
 if he wins again his folder that 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:55.800
 tried to move anything can close some 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:59.640
 some mistakes, right? 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:08.570
 even if a bit of some things 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:08.570
 You gotta talk, I'm here alone. 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:34.220
 It took me a long time to cut it here and 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:34.220
 Come back soon, it's almost over. 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:02:06.600
 Do not forget more in the end you can close the 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:02:09.000
 business and mode ipc installed one point 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.260
 account of new things like xavi and 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.930
 I gave em emerald 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:19.629
 and this central set I chose Emerald 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:21.340
 It's remembering again that I leave the link 

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:24.909
 of my other video teaching business 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:31.110
 the mother is reduced and as a fondness for 

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:31.110
 you and etc. 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:38.950
 and that's what I see is staying here 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:49.030
 with playing guitar 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:51.010
 a cool thing to ensure that the 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:56.879
 idea is that this be 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:59.349
 but then you know the video will stick around 

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:01.900
 You liked it, you liked it. 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:06.569
 white favorite is changing a lot 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.569
 posting the video post the place and
