who's the new spider-man and this is the
question<00:00:42.350> I've<00:00:42.650> been<00:00:42.680> getting<00:00:43.220> a<00:00:43.310> lot

question I've been getting a lot
personally<00:00:44.240> guys<00:00:44.660> you<00:00:44.870> know<00:00:44.990> I'm<00:00:45.170> speculating

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:45.680 
personally guys you know I'm speculating

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.460 
personally guys you know I'm speculating
just<00:00:46.370> like<00:00:46.550> you<00:00:46.790> I<00:00:46.820> don't<00:00:47.270> really<00:00:47.510> know<00:00:47.900> who<00:00:48.230> or

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:48.470 
just like you I don't really know who or

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:51.220 
just like you I don't really know who or
when<00:00:49.190> but<00:00:49.460> of<00:00:49.610> course<00:00:49.850> just<00:00:50.510> to<00:00:50.690> answer<00:00:51.079> this

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:51.230 
when but of course just to answer this

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.170 
when but of course just to answer this
question<00:00:51.440> I've<00:00:51.950> got<00:00:52.190> three<00:00:52.610> possible

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:53.180 
question I've got three possible

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:54.940 
question I've got three possible
scenarios<00:00:53.390> most<00:00:53.990> likely<00:00:54.410> stand<00:00:54.680> there<00:00:54.800> is

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:54.950 
scenarios most likely stand there is

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:57.280 
scenarios most likely stand there is
pretty<00:00:55.190> obvious<00:00:55.520> ones<00:00:56.090> but<00:00:56.239> I<00:00:56.420> will<00:00:56.780> give<00:00:57.020> some

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:57.290 
pretty obvious ones but I will give some

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:59.740 
pretty obvious ones but I will give some
reasoning<00:00:57.829> behind<00:00:58.100> them<00:00:58.670> so<00:00:58.910> when<00:00:59.420> we<00:00:59.450> will

00:00:59.740 --> 00:00:59.750 
reasoning behind them so when we will

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:01.479 
reasoning behind them so when we will
find<00:01:00.050> out<00:01:00.230> who<00:01:00.470> is<00:01:00.620> the<00:01:00.770> new<00:01:00.890> spider-man<00:01:01.370> of

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
find out who is the new spider-man of

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:03.580 
find out who is the new spider-man of
course<00:01:01.700> number<00:01:01.970> one<00:01:02.180> most<00:01:02.750> obvious<00:01:03.230> man<00:01:03.440> at

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:03.590 
course number one most obvious man at

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:05.770 
course number one most obvious man at
this<00:01:03.710> point<00:01:03.770> is<00:01:04.280> during<00:01:05.030> the<00:01:05.119> next<00:01:05.299> two<00:01:05.630> week

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:08.690 
up to April first yes I still believe

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:11.020 
up to April first yes I still believe
that<00:01:08.740> right<00:01:09.740> before<00:01:09.950> the<00:01:10.159> Civil<00:01:10.610> I<00:01:10.700> start

the<00:05:24.900> new<00:05:25.080> actor<00:05:25.440> now<00:05:26.160> why<00:05:26.700> is<00:05:26.760> unlikely<00:05:27.240> you

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:27.510 
the new actor now why is unlikely you

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:30.140 
the new actor now why is unlikely you
guys<00:05:27.660> already<00:05:28.020> realize<00:05:28.590> that<00:05:28.860> in<00:05:29.130> our<00:05:29.310> age<00:05:29.640> age

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:30.150 
guys already realize that in our age age

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:34.640 
guys already realize that in our age age
of<00:05:30.480> Internet<00:05:31.050> age<00:05:31.380> of<00:05:32.270> TMZ<00:05:33.270> age<00:05:33.990> of<00:05:34.380> you<00:05:34.560> know

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:34.650 
of Internet age of TMZ age of you know

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:36.830 
of Internet age of TMZ age of you know
it's<00:05:34.890> very<00:05:35.070> hard<00:05:35.220> keep<00:05:35.640> as<00:05:35.790> such<00:05:36.240> thing<00:05:36.660> a

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:36.840 
it's very hard keep as such thing a

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.530 
it's very hard keep as such thing a
secret<00:05:37.080> to<00:05:37.560> keep<00:05:37.770> the<00:05:38.100> extras<00:05:38.460> name<00:05:38.700> as<00:05:38.970> secret

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:39.540 
secret to keep the extras name as secret

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:42.320 
secret to keep the extras name as secret
and<00:05:39.780> it's<00:05:40.080> very<00:05:40.380> unlikely<00:05:40.560> but<00:05:41.250> they<00:05:41.669> can<00:05:42.060> pull

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:42.330 
and it's very unlikely but they can pull

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:44.570 
and it's very unlikely but they can pull
this<00:05:42.540> off<00:05:42.810> this<00:05:43.320> would<00:05:43.530> be<00:05:43.710> really<00:05:43.980> great<00:05:44.280> but

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:44.580 
this off this would be really great but

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:45.770 
this off this would be really great but
then<00:05:44.730> again<00:05:44.820> you<00:05:45.030> know<00:05:45.180> if<00:05:45.360> the<00:05:45.570> movie

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:45.780 
then again you know if the movie

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:48.050 
then again you know if the movie
premiers<00:05:46.260> in<00:05:46.350> one<00:05:46.680> country<00:05:46.950> before<00:05:47.460> another
