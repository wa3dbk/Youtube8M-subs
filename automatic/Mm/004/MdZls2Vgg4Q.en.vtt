00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.970
 these build computer 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:08.949
 but in the cinema motherboard 

00:00:08.949 --> 00:00:11.949
 Rapid cooler 

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:18.539
 so as not to scratch the table 

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:26.130
 different their installation is different 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.409
 how to install two types of processors 

00:00:29.409 --> 00:00:32.409
 pentium 4 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:35.280
 the process looks like 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.280
 pentium 4 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.030
 it has 2 missing keys 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.160
 contacts 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.150
 Beijing 4 connector on our motherboard 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.150
 board 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.930
 Hey 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.570
 in other words 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.570
 there are keys 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.190
 grabbing 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:08.680
 for this you need 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.100
 from pull to the side and then lift the lever 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.490
 and etc 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.230
 lifting the lever 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:19.230
 excessive effort 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.480
 regarding juices 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.570
 stalin processes 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.570
 here by no means follows 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.200
 any effort 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:41.250
 area we just wrong 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.540
 to orient 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.680
 need a more unpleasant situation 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.530
 if you try to put the wrong 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.370
 processes 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:51.480
 but Tymoshkina socket 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.520
 this case will have them neatly 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.130
 straighten 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.840
 let the lever down 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.760
 and thereby fix 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.200
 socket processor 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.220
 Now 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:07.370
 rockers fall away 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:10.370
 and install a cooler 

00:02:11.389 --> 00:02:13.649
 heat exchange between processor ti 

00:02:13.649 --> 00:02:16.429
 radiator 

00:02:16.429 --> 00:02:19.919
 years of cooler or sold separately 

00:02:19.919 --> 00:02:22.039
 on cul or dinner 

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:24.289
 all thermal interface 

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:26.389
 yes or no need to apply thermal grease 

00:02:26.389 --> 00:02:28.959
 either you need to clear before installation 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:31.959
 cooler from the thermometer face 

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:37.879
 Azov them them on the entire surface 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:40.879
 as thin as possible exactly 

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:45.199
 method of mounting the cooler depends on 

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:48.199
 motherboard and types of cooler itself 

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:50.549
 m cases on the motherboard 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:53.019
 there are four holes in 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:54.459
 socket perimeter 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:55.869
 above the cooler 

00:02:55.869 --> 00:02:58.149
 four latches which are inserted into 

00:02:58.149 --> 00:03:01.149
 hole on the board and snaps into place 

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:06.619
 due to which the clamps 

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:09.049
 here's a latch better snap and 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:12.049
 opposite to him diagonally 

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:22.939
 tanya fan 

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:24.669
 to the appropriate connectors on 

00:03:24.669 --> 00:03:26.839
 motherboard 

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:29.019
 fdi volumes have keys 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:31.329
 therefore wrong connect power and 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:32.899
 will not succeed 

00:03:32.899 --> 00:03:34.899
 extra wire is desirable like that 

00:03:34.899 --> 00:03:37.899
 to wind so that he did not hit the fan 

00:03:39.119 --> 00:03:41.539
 and forget to connect the fan power 

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:44.109
 if the fan will not work 

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:47.229
 Savisaar lights up 

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:49.659
 so we 

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:52.089
 pentium 4 in 

00:03:52.089 --> 00:03:55.779
 in 75 put the cooler and hooked up 

00:03:55.779 --> 00:03:58.779
 they are fan 

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:02.749
 so install athlon 64 processor firm 

00:04:02.749 --> 00:04:05.379
 but 

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:07.379
 Fiat 4 

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:08.869
 there are old people 

00:04:08.869 --> 00:04:11.869
 missing legs in one corner 

00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:17.809
 it corresponds to the missing 

00:04:17.809 --> 00:04:20.809
 socket pins 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:36.210
 and their keys 

00:04:45.249 --> 00:04:48.249
 and latch time lever 

00:04:56.009 --> 00:04:59.009
 red nasty thin layer 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:32.270
 click them 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.830
 connect power fans
