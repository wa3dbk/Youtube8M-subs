00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.110 
as the first

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.600 
as the first
GBE<00:01:21.190> and<00:01:21.990> our<00:01:22.990> fourth<00:01:23.320> chord<00:01:23.710> our<00:01:23.950> final<00:01:24.340> chord

GBE and our fourth chord our final chord

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:29.910 
GBE and our fourth chord our final chord
our<00:01:25.300> moving<00:01:25.479> down<00:01:26.190> f-sharp<00:01:27.190> a<00:01:27.850> D<00:01:28.660> and<00:01:28.930> if<00:01:29.830> you

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 
our moving down f-sharp a D and if you

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.380 
our moving down f-sharp a D and if you
notice<00:01:30.220> this<00:01:30.340> is<00:01:30.400> actually<00:01:30.760> the<00:01:30.880> same<00:01:31.090> as<00:01:31.119> our

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
notice this is actually the same as our

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.870 
notice this is actually the same as our
second<00:01:31.750> chord<00:01:32.050> but<00:01:33.010> it's<00:01:33.190> in<00:01:33.340> an<00:01:33.430> inversion

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
second chord but it's in an inversion

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.580 
second chord but it's in an inversion
which<00:01:34.270> means<00:01:34.479> we're<00:01:34.630> changing<00:01:35.050> the<00:01:35.140> order<00:01:35.350> of

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
which means we're changing the order of

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.230 
which means we're changing the order of
the<00:01:35.740> three<00:01:35.979> notes<00:01:36.310> but<00:01:36.610> the<00:01:36.729> three<00:01:36.970> notes<00:01:37.150> are

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
the three notes but the three notes are

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.440 
the three notes but the three notes are
the<00:01:37.360> same<00:01:37.619> so<00:01:38.619> first<00:01:39.430> chord<00:01:39.700> here<00:01:39.880> our<00:01:40.060> second

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
the same so first chord here our second

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:46.290 
the same so first chord here our second
or<00:01:40.600> second<00:01:41.259> chord<00:01:41.710> is<00:01:41.860> a<00:01:42.190> D<00:01:42.700> F<00:01:43.180> sharp<00:01:45.180> back<00:01:46.180> to

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:46.300 
or second chord is a D F sharp back to

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.330 
or second chord is a D F sharp back to
here<00:01:46.450> our<00:01:46.600> fourth<00:01:46.869> chord<00:01:47.200> same<00:01:47.590> three<00:01:47.890> notes<00:01:48.070> a

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
here our fourth chord same three notes a

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.820 
here our fourth chord same three notes a
G<00:01:49.149> f-sharp<00:01:49.450> but<00:01:49.960> we're<00:01:50.050> switching<00:01:50.259> that<00:01:50.500> order

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:50.830 
G f-sharp but we're switching that order

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:52.350 
G f-sharp but we're switching that order
so<00:01:50.950> this<00:01:51.039> is<00:01:51.190> an<00:01:51.280> inversion<00:01:51.670> we're<00:01:52.030> starting

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360 
so this is an inversion we're starting

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.820 
so this is an inversion we're starting
with<00:01:52.479> F<00:01:52.630> sharp<00:01:52.960> on<00:01:53.110> the<00:01:53.229> bottom<00:01:54.090> then<00:01:55.090> D<00:01:55.830> those

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830 
with F sharp on the bottom then D those

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.190 
with F sharp on the bottom then D those
are<00:01:56.950> our<00:01:57.039> four<00:01:57.340> different<00:01:57.789> shapes<00:01:58.030> for<00:01:59.020> the

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
are our four different shapes for the

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.770 
are our four different shapes for the
entire<00:01:59.440> song<00:01:59.740> of<00:01:59.950> fallen<00:02:00.450> so<00:02:01.450> let's<00:02:01.660> go

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
entire song of fallen so let's go

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:02.850 
entire song of fallen so let's go
through<00:02:01.930> those<00:02:02.080> all<00:02:02.289> together<00:02:02.619> we're<00:02:02.770> going

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 
through those all together we're going

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.710 
through those all together we're going
to<00:02:02.950> play<00:02:03.070> all<00:02:03.220> three<00:02:03.430> notes<00:02:03.670> of<00:02:03.940> each<00:02:04.149> shape<00:02:04.450> at

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
to play all three notes of each shape at

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:10.589 
to play all three notes of each shape at
once<00:02:05.050> ready<00:02:05.380> chord<00:02:06.250> one<00:02:07.530> or<00:02:08.530> two

00:02:10.589 --> 00:02:10.599

one<00:02:23.870> more<00:02:24.049> time

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.340

1<00:02:47.690> remember<00:02:48.380> each<00:02:48.560> chord<00:02:48.920> gets<00:02:49.480> six<00:02:50.480> counts

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
1 remember each chord gets six counts

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.650 
1 remember each chord gets six counts
and<00:02:51.370> on<00:02:52.370> the<00:02:52.490> first<00:02:52.730> count<00:02:52.910> in<00:02:53.120> the<00:02:53.210> right<00:02:53.390> hand

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
for the verse we don't play anything so

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:02.740 
for the verse we don't play anything so
that's<00:02:55.280> a<00:02:55.400> rest<00:02:56.320> so<00:02:57.320> it<00:02:57.740> goes<00:02:57.980> 1<00:02:58.490> 2<00:02:58.750> 3<00:02:59.750> 4<00:03:00.440> 5<00:03:01.040> 6

let's go through all four of those in a
row<00:03:42.040> without<00:03:42.190> stopping<00:03:42.370> we're<00:03:43.209> going<00:03:43.330> to<00:03:43.420> give

on<00:03:45.250> the<00:03:45.340> first<00:03:45.580> two<00:03:45.760> do<00:03:45.880> the<00:03:45.970> same<00:03:46.180> pattern<00:03:46.540> for

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:46.569 
on the first two do the same pattern for

00:03:46.569 --> 00:04:00.080 
on the first two do the same pattern for
each<00:03:46.810> chord<00:03:47.170> here<00:03:48.130> we<00:03:48.220> go<00:03:48.340> and<00:03:49.590> one<00:03:53.069> one<00:03:56.459> one

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:13.130 

one<00:04:01.129> more<00:04:02.129> time<00:04:02.340> faster<00:04:03.180> one

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.660 

all<00:04:14.140> right<00:04:14.350> that's<00:04:14.710> the<00:04:14.830> verse<00:04:15.040> right<00:04:15.460> hand

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:15.670 
all right that's the verse right hand

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:18.449 
all right that's the verse right hand
for<00:04:16.630> the<00:04:16.690> cornice<00:04:17.080> is<00:04:17.170> actually<00:04:17.470> easier<00:04:17.890> we're

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
for the cornice is actually easier we're

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:31.730 
for the cornice is actually easier we're
going<00:04:18.670> to<00:04:18.730> play<00:04:18.850> the<00:04:18.970> whole<00:04:19.150> board<00:04:19.510> six<00:04:19.989> times

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.140 

so<00:04:32.740> let's<00:04:32.919> talk<00:04:33.039> left-hand<00:04:33.580> it's<00:04:33.849> a<00:04:33.999> bit

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.150 
so let's talk left-hand it's a bit

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:35.249 
so let's talk left-hand it's a bit
easier<00:04:34.449> than<00:04:34.599> the<00:04:34.689> right<00:04:34.870> so<00:04:34.990> we're<00:04:35.139> just

00:04:35.249 --> 00:04:35.259 
easier than the right so we're just

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:36.540 
easier than the right so we're just
going<00:04:35.379> to<00:04:35.439> add<00:04:35.590> it<00:04:35.800> in<00:04:35.919> instead<00:04:36.189> of<00:04:36.249> doing<00:04:36.490> it

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550 
going to add it in instead of doing it

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:38.429 
going to add it in instead of doing it
by<00:04:36.610> itself<00:04:36.729> we're<00:04:37.689> gonna<00:04:37.779> hang<00:04:38.080> out<00:04:38.199> right

00:04:38.429 --> 00:04:38.439 
by itself we're gonna hang out right

00:04:38.439 --> 00:04:41.010 
by itself we're gonna hang out right
here<00:04:38.620> with<00:04:38.830> our<00:04:39.009> cookies<00:04:39.599> and<00:04:40.599> notice<00:04:40.870> where

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:44.430 
our pointer finger is it's right on a B

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:46.799 
our pointer finger is it's right on a B
these<00:04:45.430> are<00:04:45.490> the<00:04:45.669> two<00:04:45.759> notes<00:04:46.120> and<00:04:46.449> then<00:04:46.689> left
