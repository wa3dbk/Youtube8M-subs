00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.520

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:26.170
 hello how about friends welcome to zone 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:29.140

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:31.270
 spend an excellent weekend and good 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.730
 I bring you guys now an unboxing of 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:37.060
 some headsets are brand all the 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:39.780
 bitches are air force p11 these 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:42.550
 they work for playstation3 work 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.970
 for pc and I imagine that they will work 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:49.690
 also for the playstation 4 so 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:51.550
 so let's proceed to open them and good 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.550
 I had to buy this so as 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:57.290
 who says emergency because then the 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:01:01.430
 bosses that I had before they were the 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:03.710
 and other beach bulls, well, I do not know 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:06.350
 they broke me then you see this 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.720
 thrilled when I play and sometimes they are 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.270
 the shots then for that but now 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:15.250
 I have these new troll pitch that is 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:19.070
 well these are have a stereo sound 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:21.410
 but bone amplify the stereo sound 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:23.990
 then it will be heard as well as that 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:26.890
 it is excellent and for those who do not know 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:30.830
 which is a stereo sound so amplified 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:34.280
 it means that you can amplify 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:37.759
 amplify the sounds like this is this 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:41.350
 and well let's go there we are taking them 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:44.270
 super super unboxing super headsets 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:46.970
 then let's see how it goes 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.250
 to see and see what's up after a while 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:52.880
 I use that I say what about me 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:54.890
 they came out so I said I did not buy the 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.990
 same as I had before because I said let's go 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:00.320
 to try some new ones then ones that 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:03.110
 they are thus cheaper comfortable for the 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.130
 pocket so I bought these and good 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.950
 here brings one of the 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:10.700
 cables that are important that is why 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:13.670
 where are you going to listen to the game also 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:16.310
 this good you serve so that if you use 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:19.730
 capturadora have you 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.290
 you have your YouTube channel or something or 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.750
 like to play in tweets then also 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.610
 maybe that can be good for you 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.069
 make your likes the method 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.760
 then this let's see what else it brings 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:34.370
 we are going to keep pulling out here as much as 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:36.890
 important here is all the cable that 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:40.819
 it brings quite a long cable 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:43.670
 this is better because good if you are your 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:45.709
 television is far from you have a 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.050
 pretty extended cable so that you 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:51.580
 You may not be so close to the 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:54.500
 television then well come on and the box 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:57.920
 good what styles what designs what 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.989
 bring in the box where this beautiful comes 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.670
 headset and the colors I love because 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:04.519
 good apart from that the favorite color 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:06.739
 mine is the black the red color gives you like 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:09.380
 that a combination as well as coming 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:11.810
 excellent then let's see me good 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:14.660
 I have already used bright tower and I have had 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:17.830
 the fortune that I get to put sounds 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:19.340
 the quality of the sound and the recording is 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.260
 Excellent 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.460
 then there he brings to control the 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.580
 volume 

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:28.010
 and also to mutate and bring your clip 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:30.530
 to be able to turn it on wherever you want and 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:33.440
 here is the good the cable that I tell you 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:36.520
 it's pretty big, pretty long 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:38.470
 then we will proceed to open it 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:40.360
 and well, some friends are telling me 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:42.670
 by twitter and facebook that also already 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.290
 they have them so and that they have left 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.500
 very good so tell if someone 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:49.030
 have say down there in the comments 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:52.660
 good to see how you think 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:56.230
 so here it was for when you go 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:04:00.670
 to connect receive a current through 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:03.610
 usb medium so it 's excellent is 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:07.660
 It is recommended that a headset has 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:10.530
 usb to make it more comfortable to use it 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:13.110
 elsewhere so 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:17.040
 there we are finished with the almost with the 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:19.440
 super unboxing and we just bring some 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:22.169
 little things that always bring all the 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:24.419
 boxes is like a manual booklet that you 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:27.000
 says how to use it but I think it's 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:30.750
 more than easy to use a headset here 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:33.360
 bring good stickers and we are also going to 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:35.400
