00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
so this is just simply the TP command

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.569 
so this is just simply the TP command
and<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.719> TP<00:00:46.140> command<00:00:46.530> cannon<00:00:46.890> is<00:00:47.070> set<00:00:47.430> up<00:00:47.550> to

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
and the TP command cannon is set up to

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.670 
and the TP command cannon is set up to
allow<00:00:48.500> relative<00:00:49.500> teleporting<00:00:50.489> very<00:00:51.090> easily

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:51.680 
allow relative teleporting very easily

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.260 
allow relative teleporting very easily
so<00:00:52.680> you<00:00:52.710> can<00:00:53.219> teleport<00:00:53.460> any<00:00:53.760> types<00:00:54.120> of

so you can teleport any types of
entities<00:00:54.629> items<00:00:55.370> villagers<00:00:56.370> armor<00:00:56.850> stands

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500 
entities items villagers armor stands

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.660 
entities items villagers armor stands
falling<00:00:58.500> sand<00:00:58.770> blocks<00:00:59.070> to<00:00:59.280> make<00:00:59.309> cool

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
falling sand blocks to make cool

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.450 
falling sand blocks to make cool
animations<00:01:00.329> anything<00:01:00.989> you<00:01:01.079> want<00:01:01.289> to<00:01:01.379> do<00:01:01.530> so

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
animations anything you want to do so

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.270 
animations anything you want to do so
basically<00:01:03.239> it's<00:01:03.480> just<00:01:03.539> TP<00:01:04.080> @<00:01:04.350> e<00:01:04.650> so<00:01:05.070> we're

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
basically it's just TP @ e so we're

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.480 
basically it's just TP @ e so we're
saying<00:01:05.489> all<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:06.210> villagers<00:01:06.830> are<00:01:07.830> going<00:01:08.280> to<00:01:08.400> be

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
saying all the villagers are going to be

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.810 
saying all the villagers are going to be
teleported<00:01:08.820> to<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.930> armor<00:01:10.320> stand<00:01:10.430> now<00:01:11.430> this

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
teleported to the armor stand now this

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.570 
teleported to the armor stand now this
works<00:01:12.270> because<00:01:13.080> there's<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.860> only<00:01:14.040> one<00:01:14.250> armor

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
works because there's the only one armor

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.480 
works because there's the only one armor
stand<00:01:14.820> in<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.030> world<00:01:16.100> for<00:01:17.100> them<00:01:17.250> to<00:01:17.369> be

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
stand in the world for them to be

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.719 
stand in the world for them to be
teleported<00:01:17.909> to<00:01:18.240> and<00:01:19.130> if<00:01:20.130> you<00:01:20.310> had<00:01:20.400> multiple

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
teleported to and if you had multiple

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.609 
teleported to and if you had multiple
armor<00:01:20.939> stands<00:01:21.180> it<00:01:21.420> might<00:01:21.720> get<00:01:21.900> interesting<00:01:22.409> I

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
armor stands it might get interesting I

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:23.960 
armor stands it might get interesting I
don't<00:01:22.799> know<00:01:22.950> this<00:01:23.159> is<00:01:23.310> actually<00:01:23.400> a<00:01:23.580> test<00:01:23.820> I've

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
don't know this is actually a test I've

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.179 
don't know this is actually a test I've
never<00:01:24.150> done<00:01:24.450> this<00:01:24.630> it<00:01:25.170> but<00:01:25.560> I<00:01:25.619> don't<00:01:25.979> think

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
never done this it but I don't think

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.130 
never done this it but I don't think
this<00:01:26.310> will<00:01:26.490> work

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 
this will work

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.050 
this will work
yeah<00:01:28.140> this<00:01:28.380> won't<00:01:28.619> work<00:01:28.770> because<00:01:29.189> you<00:01:29.610> don't

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
yeah this won't work because you don't

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.090 
yeah this won't work because you don't
know<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.720> specific<00:01:31.380> place<00:01:31.680> that<00:01:31.740> is
