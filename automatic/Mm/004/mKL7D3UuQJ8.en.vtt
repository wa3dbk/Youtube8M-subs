vehicle
well<00:00:13.440> first<00:00:13.769> off<00:00:13.950> people<00:00:14.160> notice<00:00:14.639> it's<00:00:14.849> not<00:00:15.000> a

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
well first off people notice it's not a

well first off people notice it's not a
box<00:00:15.240> the<00:00:16.199> outgoing<00:00:16.609> vehicle<00:00:17.609> was<00:00:17.820> a<00:00:17.850> box<00:00:18.180> to

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
box the outgoing vehicle was a box to

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.620 
box the outgoing vehicle was a box to
the<00:00:18.449> Liberty<00:00:19.189> the<00:00:20.189> the<00:00:20.460> point<00:00:20.699> here<00:00:21.210> was<00:00:21.420> if

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
the Liberty the the point here was if

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.210 
the Liberty the the point here was if
it's<00:00:21.810> going<00:00:21.960> to<00:00:22.020> be<00:00:22.170> really<00:00:22.560> efficient<00:00:23.039> it's

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
it's going to be really efficient it's

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.320 
it's going to be really efficient it's
got<00:00:23.340> a<00:00:23.369> look<00:00:23.609> at<00:00:23.760> fish<00:00:23.910> it's<00:00:24.119> got<00:00:24.240> to

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
got a look at fish it's got to

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.720 
got a look at fish it's got to
communicate<00:00:24.779> that<00:00:24.960> through<00:00:25.019> the<00:00:25.320> shape<00:00:25.730> this

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
communicate that through the shape this

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.570 
communicate that through the shape this
vehicle<00:00:27.180> cuts<00:00:28.140> a<00:00:28.260> much<00:00:28.470> more<00:00:29.160> efficient

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
vehicle cuts a much more efficient

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.519 
vehicle cuts a much more efficient
profile<00:00:30.170> aerodynamics<00:00:31.170> are<00:00:31.289> really

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
profile aerodynamics are really

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.970 
profile aerodynamics are really
important<00:00:31.980> now<00:00:32.099> for<00:00:32.130> us<00:00:32.579> for<00:00:32.969> fuel<00:00:33.180> economy<00:00:33.980> so

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
important now for us for fuel economy so

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.530 
important now for us for fuel economy so
it's<00:00:35.130> got<00:00:35.280> a<00:00:35.309> much<00:00:35.610> sleeker<00:00:36.120> faster

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
it's got a much sleeker faster

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.080 
it's got a much sleeker faster
windshield<00:00:37.410> it's<00:00:37.920> more<00:00:38.219> derived<00:00:38.579> from<00:00:38.910> the

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
windshield it's more derived from the

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.850 
windshield it's more derived from the
Grand<00:00:39.300> Cherokee<00:00:39.750> side<00:00:39.989> of<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.170> family<00:00:40.559> style

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
Grand Cherokee side of the family style

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.060 
Grand Cherokee side of the family style
wise<00:00:41.190> so<00:00:42.180> you'll<00:00:42.360> see<00:00:42.540> a<00:00:42.570> lot<00:00:42.809> of<00:00:43.070> sculpting

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
wise so you'll see a lot of sculpting

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.040 
wise so you'll see a lot of sculpting
and<00:00:44.370> muscle<00:00:44.730> in<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:44.969> sheet<00:00:45.210> metal<00:00:45.360> the

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
and muscle in the sheet metal the

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.350 
and muscle in the sheet metal the
windshields<00:00:46.590> real<00:00:47.190> fast<00:00:47.460> recall<00:00:47.910> it's<00:00:48.059> a<00:00:48.149> laid

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
windshields real fast recall it's a laid

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.569 
windshields real fast recall it's a laid
back<00:00:48.390> windshield<00:00:48.950> but<00:00:49.950> it's<00:00:50.070> also<00:00:50.190> got<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.520> be

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
back windshield but it's also got to be

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.790 
back windshield but it's also got to be
its<00:00:50.700> own<00:00:51.050> animal<00:00:52.050> it's<00:00:52.199> got<00:00:52.320> to<00:00:52.440> be<00:00:52.530> its<00:00:52.649> own

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
its own animal it's got to be its own

00:00:52.800 --> 00:01:40.440 
its own animal it's got to be its own
design

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.810 

so<00:01:41.450> you'll<00:01:41.659> see<00:01:41.920> especially<00:01:42.920> the<00:01:43.280> front<00:01:43.610> end

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
so you'll see especially the front end

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.240 
so you'll see especially the front end
is<00:01:43.939> quite<00:01:44.090> a<00:01:44.180> bit<00:01:44.329> different<00:01:44.750> the<00:01:45.680> seven<00:01:46.009> slot

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
is quite a bit different the seven slot

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.880 
is quite a bit different the seven slot
grill<00:01:46.460> is<00:01:46.729> now<00:01:46.909> raked<00:01:47.750> back<00:01:48.110> and<00:01:48.470> then<00:01:48.590> we<00:01:48.710> pick

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
grill is now raked back and then we pick

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.859 
grill is now raked back and then we pick
that<00:01:49.009> up<00:01:49.070> really<00:01:49.549> from<00:01:49.759> the<00:01:49.909> 70<00:01:50.390> for<00:01:50.600> the

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869 
that up really from the 70 for the

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:54.279 
that up really from the 70 for the
full-size<00:01:51.640> Cherokee<00:01:52.640> we've<00:01:53.360> used<00:01:53.570> that<00:01:53.750> that

00:01:54.279 --> 00:01:54.289 
full-size Cherokee we've used that that

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:56.410 
full-size Cherokee we've used that that
key<00:01:54.560> on<00:01:54.799> a<00:01:54.830> couple<00:01:55.789> different<00:01:56.060> vehicles

little while and the Wranglers but here

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.230 
little while and the Wranglers but here
it's<00:02:00.439> much<00:02:00.560> more<00:02:00.770> amplified<00:02:01.070> and<00:02:01.640> and

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
it's much more amplified and and

it's much more amplified and and

through that

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.340 
through that
little<00:03:07.090> bit<00:03:07.240> higher<00:03:07.420> so<00:03:07.780> if<00:03:07.840> the<00:03:07.930> car<00:03:08.110> gets<00:03:08.230> a

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
little bit higher so if the car gets a

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.050 
little bit higher so if the car gets a
pedestrian<00:03:08.860> needles<00:03:09.100> much<00:03:09.550> friendlier

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060
