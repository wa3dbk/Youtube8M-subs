Doug<00:01:52.020> now<00:01:52.619> you<00:01:52.680> notice<00:01:53.130> here<00:01:53.280> how<00:01:53.490> far<00:01:53.520> forward

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
Doug now you notice here how far forward

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.969 
Doug now you notice here how far forward
this<00:01:54.420> wheel<00:01:54.659> is<00:01:54.840> it's<00:01:55.020> almost<00:01:55.439> touching<00:01:55.829> right

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
this wheel is it's almost touching right

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.760 
this wheel is it's almost touching right
here<00:01:56.750> when<00:01:57.750> I<00:01:57.780> first<00:01:58.079> got<00:01:58.259> it<00:01:58.409> here<00:01:58.560> I<00:01:58.590> thought

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
here when I first got it here I thought

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.859 
here when I first got it here I thought
I<00:01:58.829> could<00:01:59.040> just<00:01:59.219> extend<00:01:59.430> my<00:01:59.729> heart<00:02:00.000> out<00:02:00.600> so<00:02:00.750> we

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
I could just extend my heart out so we

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.300 
I could just extend my heart out so we
loosen<00:02:01.229> our<00:02:01.290> hive<00:02:01.500> joints<00:02:01.890> if<00:02:01.979> it's<00:02:02.100> going<00:02:02.250> to

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
loosen our hive joints if it's going to

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.969 
loosen our hive joints if it's going to
be<00:02:02.430> a<00:02:02.460> five<00:02:02.850> minute<00:02:03.210> job<00:02:03.240> at<00:02:03.689> most<00:02:03.960> puller<00:02:04.710> heim

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:10.400 
see kind of Springs are leaning forward

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.870 
see kind of Springs are leaning forward
the<00:02:10.580> shots<00:02:11.180> are<00:02:11.420> leaning<00:02:11.600> forward<00:02:12.580> so<00:02:13.580> they

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
the shots are leaning forward so they

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.790 
the shots are leaning forward so they
but<00:02:14.120> they<00:02:14.270> have<00:02:14.480> joints<00:02:14.840> will<00:02:15.050> not<00:02:15.290> let<00:02:15.530> us<00:02:15.620> do

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
but they have joints will not let us do

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:16.240 
but they have joints will not let us do
that

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250

side I did a little research on trying
to<00:02:27.830> just<00:02:28.370> lengthen<00:02:28.610> my<00:02:28.820> radius<00:02:29.390> arms<00:02:29.780> but

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:30.320 
to just lengthen my radius arms but

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.200 
to just lengthen my radius arms but
that's<00:02:30.500> one<00:02:30.650> change<00:02:30.890> the<00:02:31.040> geometry<00:02:31.280> and<00:02:31.790> I<00:02:32.000> was

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:32.210 
that's one change the geometry and I was

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:34.840 
that's one change the geometry and I was
going<00:02:32.360> to<00:02:32.450> lengthen<00:02:33.050> all<00:02:33.290> four<00:02:33.560> of<00:02:33.590> them<00:02:33.830> so<00:02:34.460> at

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
going to lengthen all four of them so at

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:36.940 
going to lengthen all four of them so at
the<00:02:35.030> point<00:02:35.300> where<00:02:35.510> at<00:02:35.690> I've<00:02:36.290> only<00:02:36.530> got<00:02:36.710> four

the point where at I've only got four

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.860 
the point where at I've only got four
bolts<00:02:37.280> left<00:02:37.490> holding<00:02:37.790> this<00:02:37.910> body<00:02:38.180> on<00:02:38.390> I'm

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
bolts left holding this body on I'm

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.420 
bolts left holding this body on I'm
going<00:02:39.020> to<00:02:39.080> go<00:02:39.230> ahead<00:02:39.410> and<00:02:39.590> raise<00:02:39.740> the<00:02:39.980> body<00:02:40.190> up

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
going to go ahead and raise the body up

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.220 
going to go ahead and raise the body up
we're<00:02:40.910> going<00:02:41.000> to<00:02:41.060> have<00:02:41.180> to<00:02:41.300> wash<00:02:41.540> all<00:02:41.900> that<00:02:41.930> off

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:46.630 
the frame I'm gonna have to move all
that<00:02:44.240> back<00:02:44.540> two<00:02:45.200> inches<00:02:45.650> to<00:02:46.070> get<00:02:46.190> this<00:02:46.400> wheel

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
that back two inches to get this wheel

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.220 
that back two inches to get this wheel
to<00:02:46.820> look<00:02:47.030> right<00:02:47.270> because<00:02:47.750> it<00:02:47.870> just<00:02:47.960> looks

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
to look right because it just looks

to look right because it just looks
funny<00:02:48.500> kicked<00:02:48.830> up<00:02:48.950> under<00:02:49.280> there<00:02:49.460> so<00:02:49.880> you<00:02:50.510> can

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
funny kicked up under there so you can

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.960 
funny kicked up under there so you can
see<00:02:50.840> we're<00:02:51.110> just<00:02:51.770> having<00:02:52.550> that<00:02:52.610> a<00:02:52.670> little<00:02:52.880> bit

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
see we're just having that a little bit

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:54.670 
see we're just having that a little bit
of<00:02:53.120> smoke<00:02:53.480> put<00:02:53.600> that<00:02:53.780> in<00:02:53.840> the<00:02:53.900> wrong<00:02:54.050> spot<00:02:54.440> is

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
of smoke put that in the wrong spot is

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.860 
of smoke put that in the wrong spot is
going<00:02:54.830> to<00:02:54.890> create<00:02:55.220> us<00:02:55.430> a<00:02:55.610> lot<00:02:56.030> of<00:02:56.300> headache<00:02:56.690> and

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
going to create us a lot of headache and

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.770 
going to create us a lot of headache and
work<00:02:57.250> also<00:02:58.250> while<00:02:58.640> we<00:02:58.730> do<00:02:58.880> that<00:02:59.090> when<00:02:59.360> I<00:02:59.390> when<00:02:59.750> I

work also while we do that when I when I
take<00:03:00.080> this<00:03:00.200> body<00:03:00.470> off<00:03:00.650> I<00:03:00.860> was<00:03:01.010> setting<00:03:01.340> them<00:03:01.430> to

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
take this body off I was setting them to

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.310 
take this body off I was setting them to
a<00:03:01.640> jig<00:03:01.940> I<00:03:02.060> got<00:03:02.210> a<00:03:02.240> little<00:03:02.390> body<00:03:02.570> jig<00:03:02.900> I<00:03:03.020> can<00:03:03.170> put

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:03.320 
a jig I got a little body jig I can put

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.920 
a jig I got a little body jig I can put
it<00:03:03.410> on<00:03:03.560> and<00:03:03.860> I<00:03:04.370> can<00:03:04.580> adjust<00:03:05.120> this<00:03:05.540> like<00:03:05.750> right

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
it on and I can adjust this like right

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.480 
it on and I can adjust this like right
now<00:03:06.110> that<00:03:06.320> door<00:03:06.500> didn't<00:03:06.800> fit<00:03:06.950> so<00:03:06.980> I<00:03:07.220> put

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:07.490 
now that door didn't fit so I put

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:09.640 
now that door didn't fit so I put
spacers<00:03:07.970> in<00:03:08.150> the<00:03:08.240> back<00:03:08.420> of<00:03:08.690> this<00:03:09.260> quarter

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
spacers in the back of this quarter

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.530 
spacers in the back of this quarter
panel<00:03:10.040> and<00:03:10.340> I<00:03:10.640> can<00:03:10.670> adjust<00:03:10.910> this<00:03:11.239> quarter

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
panel and I can adjust this quarter

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.030 
panel and I can adjust this quarter
panel<00:03:11.840> and<00:03:11.930> adjust<00:03:12.020> that<00:03:12.380> hood<00:03:12.590> and<00:03:12.770> I'll<00:03:12.830> sit

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
panel and adjust that hood and I'll sit

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.949 
panel and adjust that hood and I'll sit
out<00:03:13.130> on<00:03:13.160> the<00:03:13.340> jig<00:03:13.610> like<00:03:13.820> that<00:03:14.060> then<00:03:14.570> when<00:03:14.720> I<00:03:14.780> get

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
out on the jig like that then when I get

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:16.630 
out on the jig like that then when I get
it<00:03:15.080> I<00:03:15.110> can<00:03:15.620> go<00:03:15.830> ahead<00:03:15.920> and<00:03:16.010> paint<00:03:16.340> the<00:03:16.459> body

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
it I can go ahead and paint the body

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.880 
it I can go ahead and paint the body
will<00:03:17.300> have<00:03:17.420> the<00:03:17.570> rolling<00:03:17.959> get<00:03:18.170> running<00:03:18.620> here

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
will have the rolling get running here
