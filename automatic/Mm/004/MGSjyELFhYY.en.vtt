00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.839 

although<00:03:49.790> P<00:03:49.969> word<00:03:50.209> I<00:03:51.040> want<00:03:52.040> to<00:03:52.189> solve<00:03:52.430> this<00:03:52.670> a

00:03:52.839 --> 00:03:52.849 
although P word I want to solve this a

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:54.220 
although P word I want to solve this a
little<00:03:53.000> in<00:03:53.299> a<00:03:53.359> little<00:03:53.389> bit<00:03:53.689> of<00:03:53.719> water<00:03:54.019> before

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
little in a little bit of water before

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:57.160 
little in a little bit of water before
you<00:03:54.469> add<00:03:54.620> it<00:03:54.739> to<00:03:54.769> the<00:03:54.859> recipe<00:03:55.389> because<00:03:56.389> the

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.170 
you add it to the recipe because the

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:58.750 
you add it to the recipe because the
reasoning<00:03:57.560> this<00:03:57.709> one<00:03:57.889> is<00:03:57.980> crunchy<00:03:58.370> as<00:03:58.459> I<00:03:58.579> did

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
reasoning this one is crunchy as I did

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:07.050 
reasoning this one is crunchy as I did
not<00:03:58.790> do<00:03:59.120> that<00:03:59.269> so<00:04:00.879> you<00:04:01.879> get<00:04:02.000> the<00:04:02.120> sweetness<00:04:02.419> but

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.309 

generally<00:04:08.060> speaking<00:04:08.090> I<00:04:08.569> don't<00:04:08.750> like<00:04:08.900> my<00:04:09.049> kings

00:04:09.309 --> 00:04:09.319 
generally speaking I don't like my kings

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:12.190 
generally speaking I don't like my kings
to<00:04:09.590> be<00:04:09.680> gone<00:04:09.980> sheep<00:04:10.280> and<00:04:11.269> decile<00:04:11.659> dog<00:04:11.930> didn't

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200 
to be gone sheep and decile dog didn't

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.409 
to be gone sheep and decile dog didn't
dissolve<00:04:12.590> into<00:04:12.919> the<00:04:13.069> cream<00:04:13.730> cheese<00:04:13.760> butter

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:14.419 
dissolve into the cream cheese butter

00:04:14.419 --> 00:04:18.270 
dissolve into the cream cheese butter
solution<00:04:15.519> so<00:04:16.519> it's<00:04:17.239> still<00:04:17.539> kind<00:04:17.690> of<00:04:17.780> crunchy

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
solution so it's still kind of crunchy

00:04:18.280 --> 00:05:12.720 
solution so it's still kind of crunchy
but<00:04:19.280> still

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:12.730 

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:16.650 

now<00:05:13.630> I'm<00:05:13.780> into<00:05:14.050> the<00:05:14.170> weight<00:05:14.350> loss<00:05:14.560> phase<00:05:15.660> and

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:16.660 
now I'm into the weight loss phase and

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:18.420
