I didn't follow a recipe we always make

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:34.639 
I didn't follow a recipe we always make
our<00:01:33.389> own<00:01:33.600> barbecue<00:01:33.840> sauce<00:01:34.200> a<00:01:34.229> lot<00:01:34.469> of<00:01:34.560> the

00:01:34.639 --> 00:01:34.649 
our own barbecue sauce a lot of the

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:36.529 
our own barbecue sauce a lot of the
times<00:01:34.859> anyways<00:01:35.369> so<00:01:35.700> it's<00:01:35.880> just<00:01:36.060> ketchup<00:01:36.299> and

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:36.539

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:39.050 
times anyways so it's just ketchup and
mustard<00:01:36.689> and<00:01:37.079> a<00:01:37.200> little<00:01:37.409> bit<00:01:37.529> of<00:01:38.029> brown<00:01:39.029> sugar

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
mustard and a little bit of brown sugar

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.789 
mustard and a little bit of brown sugar
and<00:01:39.569> different<00:01:39.840> spices<00:01:40.079> so<00:01:40.319> we<00:01:40.409> didn't<00:01:40.679> add

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
and different spices so we didn't add

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.289

obviously I didn't add the brown sugar

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.849

is really sweet so it's almost 3/4 apple
butter<00:01:47.069> and<00:01:47.749> then<00:01:48.749> like<00:01:48.929> a<00:01:48.959> barbecue<00:01:49.469> sauce

00:01:49.489 --> 00:01:49.499
