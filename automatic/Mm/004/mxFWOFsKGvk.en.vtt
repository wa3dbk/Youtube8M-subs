00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:04.700 
there's an easter egg ins came very near
the<00:00:02.190> beginning<00:00:02.370> right<00:00:03.210> where<00:00:03.389> i<00:00:03.419> am<00:00:03.540> here<00:00:03.899> on

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710 
the beginning right where i am here on

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:10.790 
the beginning right where i am here on
to<00:00:05.549> that<00:00:05.700> boat<00:00:08.809> you<00:00:09.809> can<00:00:09.929> only<00:00:10.050> do<00:00:10.290> this<00:00:10.410> sound

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
to that boat you can only do this sound

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.220 
to that boat you can only do this sound
if<00:00:11.190> you<00:00:11.700> have<00:00:11.820> the<00:00:12.030> cryptographic<00:00:12.630> sequencer

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
if you have the cryptographic sequencer

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.560 
if you have the cryptographic sequencer
so<00:00:13.950> you<00:00:14.460> got<00:00:14.580> to<00:00:14.670> wait<00:00:14.790> till<00:00:14.969> you<00:00:15.089> get<00:00:15.210> that<00:00:15.420> in

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
so you got to wait till you get that in

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.390 
so you got to wait till you get that in
the<00:00:15.719> game<00:00:15.929> i<00:00:18.410> tried<00:00:19.410> all<00:00:19.560> around<00:00:19.859> the<00:00:19.949> boat<00:00:20.160> um

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
the game i tried all around the boat um

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.400 
the game i tried all around the boat um
on<00:00:21.300> where<00:00:21.630> to<00:00:21.810> use<00:00:21.930> the<00:00:22.080> cryptographic

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
on where to use the cryptographic

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.380 
on where to use the cryptographic
sequencer<00:00:22.890> and<00:00:23.250> it<00:00:23.430> works<00:00:23.580> best<00:00:23.820> on<00:00:24.000> top<00:00:24.240> of

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
sequencer and it works best on top of

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:32.630 
sequencer and it works best on top of
this<00:00:24.480> right<00:00:25.199> here<00:00:25.410> in<00:00:25.619> this<00:00:25.949> area<00:00:31.309> and<00:00:32.309> then

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
this right here in this area and then

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:33.860 
this right here in this area and then
just<00:00:32.790> gonna<00:00:32.910> have<00:00:33.059> to<00:00:33.149> try<00:00:33.360> round<00:00:33.570> with<00:00:33.719> the

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
just gonna have to try round with the

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:57.630 
just gonna have to try round with the
passwords<00:00:34.530> that<00:00:34.590> see<00:00:34.829> which<00:00:34.980> one<00:00:35.130> works

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:57.640 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.740 

once<00:00:58.640> you<00:00:58.760> get<00:00:58.880> into<00:00:59.030> here<00:00:59.300> it<00:00:59.450> goes<00:00:59.570> into

00:00:59.740 --> 00:00:59.750 
once you get into here it goes into

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:01.630 
once you get into here it goes into
first<00:00:59.990> person<00:01:00.200> and<00:01:00.620> you're<00:01:01.070> not<00:01:01.190> able<00:01:01.340> to

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
first person and you're not able to

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.780 
first person and you're not able to
switch<00:01:01.880> into<00:01:02.060> the<00:01:02.300> detective<00:01:02.570> mode<00:01:02.990> or<00:01:03.790> jump

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
switch into the detective mode or jump

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.160 
switch into the detective mode or jump
in<00:01:04.940> here<00:01:05.090> you<00:01:05.240> can't<00:01:05.270> do<00:01:05.600> anything<00:01:05.840> in<00:01:06.050> here

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
in here you can't do anything in here

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.760 
in here you can't do anything in here
but<00:01:06.350> look<00:01:06.470> around<00:01:06.800> and<00:01:07.900> what<00:01:08.900> I<00:01:08.930> coz<00:01:09.440> a<00:01:09.470> lot<00:01:09.620> of

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
but look around and what I coz a lot of

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.120 
but look around and what I coz a lot of
these<00:01:09.830> bugs<00:01:10.190> I<00:01:10.310> think<00:01:10.490> that<00:01:10.610> cockroaches
