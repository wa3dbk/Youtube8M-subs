00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:06.990
 and how to say to appreciate this mode and 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.430
 especially let's I'm just the little ones 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.060
 pigs because otherwise it's going to be a 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.110
 invention of the peaks an amazing thing 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.680
 but that's not why we're here 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.590
 today 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.790
 so we can see that I have in front of 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.320
 eyes it's pretty weird to see tomorrow 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.080
 so a great and a life brings together to 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.540
 nothing very small and I have more 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:28.950
 seriously some Chinese wang that's 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:31.170
 what does that add you to this caen option 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.360
 do right click and you hold with 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.609
 your mouse or pad I knew you 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.960
 play you hold there you go 

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:39.740
 maybe more my time because of the sound 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.740
 trip 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.710
 it is stronger than it has destroyed all 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.230
 suddenly I'm not in creative mode 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.990
 the mob spawner when you have it like 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:55.330
 you saw it did not destroy it because 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.860
 it's still more 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:01.750
 complicated good game just kill for 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:04.840
 can you watch this is still a 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.730
 something else when you are already targeting a 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.150
 enemy and you clicks or there I have more 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:08.530
 of food 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:12.540
 I forgot the name given by contract 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.540
 wastes a lot of your food 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.340
 would not have got fed up that would be silly 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:29.320
 good so I 'm just going to give myself to 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:31.470
 to eat the little ones I spent doing 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.470
 damages 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:42.050
 I find you not eat here here 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:45.680
 so look I'm going to do on Islam 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:48.220
 here when you have enemies look 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:52.430
 I advise you to aim others by 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:55.850
 victory and so that's it all 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:57.260
 lurking is looked at at once they are 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.030
 all dead all those I typed are 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.250
 dead my fat is a kind of disease 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.959
 if I can say it's the stage and the 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:06.040
 chopper it's going to kill them directly I 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:08.390
 put cows here to show you 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.040
 like that you'll be able to see the 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.860
 carnage that this mode can do and that's 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:17.780
 pretty epic 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:19.459
 if I can say it then like this 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.819
 then right clicks against this mode 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:25.910
 you can use it only if you 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:27.170
 have 5 ham so kiss you have 5 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.280
 legs we can use you can 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.440
 use with me but it will not be 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.760
 effective or not even used I 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:35.170
 managed once to use it you 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.170
 do not know if it's a bug look 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:42.110
 I 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:43.490
 here I am putting your creative time 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:45.970
 to get up look at everything they 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:47.900

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.030
 I also have it a little bit 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.900
 the barriers look I have nothing on me 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.900
 I just pick up 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.709
 all I can pick up their lead 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.989
 and basically theft that's it adds you 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:05.440
 the function of being able to type and as 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:06.970
 this is against you can 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.340
 to use it-that was something in 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:11.590
 hands for example less to survive 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.450
 with something in the hands are 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:16.540

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:18.660

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.560
