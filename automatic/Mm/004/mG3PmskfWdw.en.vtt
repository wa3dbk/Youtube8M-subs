dig this interesting target I have
marked<00:00:28.619> off<00:00:28.820> you<00:00:29.820> can<00:00:30.000> hear<00:00:30.210> a<00:00:30.240> little<00:00:30.390> bit<00:00:30.570> of

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
marked off you can hear a little bit of

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.060 
marked off you can hear a little bit of
chatter<00:00:30.960> because<00:00:31.529> I'm<00:00:31.740> in<00:00:32.180> boost<00:00:33.180> process

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:34.070 
chatter because I'm in boost process

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.490 
chatter because I'm in boost process
let's<00:00:35.070> go<00:00:35.250> up<00:00:35.399> to<00:00:35.579> sensitivity<00:00:36.480> can't<00:00:37.170> go<00:00:37.320> any

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
let's go up to sensitivity can't go any

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.639 
let's go up to sensitivity can't go any
higher<00:00:38.809> let's<00:00:39.809> go<00:00:39.989> back<00:00:40.170> to<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.440> boost

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
higher let's go back to the boost

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.220 
higher let's go back to the boost
process<00:00:41.280> now<00:00:42.059> right<00:00:42.420> where<00:00:42.629> this<00:00:42.780> piece<00:00:43.050> of

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
process now right where this piece of

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.630 
process now right where this piece of
black<00:00:43.440> glass<00:00:43.770> is<00:00:45.890> that<00:00:46.890> shows<00:00:47.190> you<00:00:47.340> how<00:00:47.460> old

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
black glass is that shows you how old

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.750 
black glass is that shows you how old
the<00:00:47.850> site<00:00:48.120> is<00:00:48.680> really<00:00:49.680> early<00:00:50.160> black<00:00:50.430> glass

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
the site is really early black glass

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.630 
the site is really early black glass
base<00:00:51.120> was<00:00:51.449> plowed<00:00:52.110> up<00:00:52.320> let<00:00:53.280> me<00:00:53.340> show<00:00:53.430> you

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
base was plowed up let me show you

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.600 
base was plowed up let me show you
something<00:00:54.120> here<00:00:54.530> with<00:00:55.530> a<00:00:55.559> boost<00:00:55.860> process<00:00:56.460> I've

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
something here with a boost process I've

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:06.440 
something here with a boost process I've
got<00:00:56.760> a<00:00:56.789> nice<00:00:57.059> signal<00:00:57.510> Mart<00:01:04.610> it's<00:01:05.610> jumping<00:01:06.270> but

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
got a nice signal Mart it's jumping but

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.929 
got a nice signal Mart it's jumping but
I'm<00:01:06.570> seeing<00:01:06.810> high<00:01:07.110> numbers<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:08.280> it<00:01:08.610> sounds

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
I'm seeing high numbers and it sounds

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.350 
I'm seeing high numbers and it sounds
really<00:01:09.150> good<00:01:09.510> actually<00:01:10.170> I<00:01:10.229> can<00:01:11.000> almost<00:01:12.000> get

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
really good actually I can almost get

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.270 
really good actually I can almost get
the<00:01:12.479> coil<00:01:12.780> Antje<00:01:13.320> off<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.590> ground<00:01:13.890> and<00:01:14.040> still

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
the coil Antje off the ground and still

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.399 
the coil Antje off the ground and still
get<00:01:14.840> when<00:01:15.840> I<00:01:15.869> see<00:01:16.170> it<00:01:16.290> jumping<00:01:16.680> up<00:01:16.799> into<00:01:17.070> 81<00:01:17.670> and

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:18.409 
get when I see it jumping up into 81 and

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:22.100 
get when I see it jumping up into 81 and
87<00:01:19.939> I'm<00:01:20.939> going<00:01:21.210> to<00:01:21.299> dig<00:01:21.479> that<00:01:21.689> one

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
87 I'm going to dig that one

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.980 
87 I'm going to dig that one
now<00:01:22.500> let's<00:01:22.799> uh<00:01:23.240> when<00:01:24.240> you<00:01:24.330> get<00:01:24.420> a<00:01:24.479> repeatable

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
now let's uh when you get a repeatable

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.350 
now let's uh when you get a repeatable
signal<00:01:25.470> you<00:01:25.560> should<00:01:25.770> dig<00:01:25.979> it<00:01:26.100> anyways<00:01:26.490> now

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
signal you should dig it anyways now

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.109 
signal you should dig it anyways now
we'll<00:01:27.540> go<00:01:27.630> back<00:01:27.659> into<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.290> processes<00:01:29.070> and<00:01:29.280> go

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
we'll go back into the processes and go

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.920 
we'll go back into the processes and go
back<00:01:30.329> to<00:01:30.509> what<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.810> old<00:01:30.990> 75<00:01:31.470> had<00:01:31.950> to<00:01:32.100> de<00:01:32.310> and

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
back to what the old 75 had to de and

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:43.069 
back to what the old 75 had to de and
see<00:01:34.310> what<00:01:35.310> we<00:01:35.430> did<00:01:35.700> look<00:01:36.689> at<00:01:36.810> that<00:01:41.780> I'm<00:01:42.780> seeing

see what we did look at that I'm seeing
some<00:01:43.409> high<00:01:43.590> numbers<00:01:44.100> that<00:01:44.280> I<00:01:44.340> lollie<00:01:44.579> see<00:01:44.939> in<00:01:45.060> a

I think get something on this one a lot

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.089 
I think get something on this one a lot
of<00:02:52.630> military<00:02:52.810> buttons<00:02:53.500> have<00:02:53.620> come<00:02:53.799> out<00:02:53.950> of

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:54.099 
of military buttons have come out of

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:59.039 
of military buttons have come out of
here<00:02:54.250> let's<00:02:54.489> see<00:02:54.640> what<00:02:54.819> we<00:02:54.910> got<00:02:55.090> here<00:02:57.599> yeah<00:02:58.599> I

mostly<00:06:12.419> check-in<00:06:13.290> signals<00:06:13.560> today<00:06:14.540> but<00:06:15.540> uh

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:15.620 
mostly check-in signals today but uh

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:17.930 
mostly check-in signals today but uh
there<00:06:16.620> was<00:06:16.800> a<00:06:16.830> lot<00:06:17.130> of<00:06:17.160> things<00:06:17.490> that<00:06:17.669> came<00:06:17.910> up

00:06:34.219 --> 00:06:34.229 
and tiny droplets a lead it's definitely

00:06:34.229 --> 00:06:36.500 
and tiny droplets a lead it's definitely
got<00:06:34.410> some<00:06:34.520> sensitivity<00:06:35.550> I<00:06:35.700> kept<00:06:36.090> picking<00:06:36.390> up

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:36.510 
got some sensitivity I kept picking up

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:38.540 
got some sensitivity I kept picking up
the<00:06:36.660> eyelets<00:06:37.080> of<00:06:37.229> my<00:06:37.380> boots<00:06:37.680> quite<00:06:38.100> a<00:06:38.130> bit<00:06:38.400> as

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:38.550 
the eyelets of my boots quite a bit as

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:41.900 
the eyelets of my boots quite a bit as
well<00:06:38.580> so<00:06:39.860> definitely<00:06:40.860> got<00:06:41.100> some<00:06:41.280> power<00:06:41.520> and

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:41.910 
well so definitely got some power and
