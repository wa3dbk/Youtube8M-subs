you're gonna need a chisel I need to

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.660 
you're gonna need a chisel I need to
know<00:02:55.489> how<00:02:55.700> far<00:02:56.030> I'm<00:02:56.180> going<00:02:56.329> to<00:02:56.420> cut<00:02:56.599> down<00:02:57.670> so

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
know how far I'm going to cut down so

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.259 
know how far I'm going to cut down so
you<00:02:58.730> take<00:02:59.120> your<00:02:59.150> individual<00:02:59.840> boards<00:03:01.120> lay<00:03:02.120> it

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:02.269 
you take your individual boards lay it

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:07.030 
you take your individual boards lay it
on<00:03:02.390> its<00:03:02.420> side<00:03:02.720> and<00:03:03.819> then<00:03:04.819> line<00:03:05.450> your<00:03:05.859> 2x4<00:03:06.859> up

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
on its side and then line your 2x4 up

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.160 
on its side and then line your 2x4 up
flat<00:03:07.430> on<00:03:07.840> the<00:03:08.840> top

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
flat on the top

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.350 
flat on the top
this<00:03:10.709> is<00:03:10.920> how<00:03:11.040> deep<00:03:11.670> you're<00:03:11.910> gonna<00:03:12.090> want<00:03:12.300> to

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
this is how deep you're gonna want to

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.790 
this is how deep you're gonna want to
cut<00:03:13.010> and<00:03:14.010> then<00:03:14.209> approximately<00:03:15.620> where<00:03:16.620> you've

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
cut and then approximately where you've

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.710 
cut and then approximately where you've
made<00:03:17.069> your<00:03:17.310> marks<00:03:17.670> just<00:03:17.910> run<00:03:18.270> a<00:03:18.300> line<00:03:18.510> across

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
made your marks just run a line across

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.870 
made your marks just run a line across
there<00:03:19.020> it<00:03:19.170> doesn't<00:03:19.319> have<00:03:19.560> to<00:03:19.680> be<00:03:19.800> exact<00:03:20.220> that's

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
there it doesn't have to be exact that's

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.520 
there it doesn't have to be exact that's
just<00:03:21.209> where<00:03:21.480> you're<00:03:21.630> going<00:03:21.840> how<00:03:22.170> far<00:03:22.410> down

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
just where you're going how far down

just where you're going how far down
you're<00:03:22.770> going<00:03:22.890> to<00:03:22.980> cut<00:03:23.160> it<00:03:23.450> you<00:03:24.450> flip<00:03:24.810> it<00:03:24.840> over

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
you're going to cut it you flip it over

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.840 
you're going to cut it you flip it over
lay<00:03:26.970> your<00:03:27.000> 2x4<00:03:27.750> down<00:03:28.250> make<00:03:29.250> sure<00:03:29.280> it's<00:03:29.550> lined

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:44.680 
and it's a really good savings if you
don't<00:06:43.100> really<00:06:43.280> care<00:06:43.400> what<00:06:43.790> the<00:06:43.940> color<00:06:44.180> is<00:06:44.450> you

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:44.690 
don't really care what the color is you

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:47.820 
don't really care what the color is you
can<00:06:44.840> usually<00:06:45.350> sort<00:06:45.800> through<00:06:45.980> there<00:06:46.270> this<00:06:47.270> is<00:06:47.480> a

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:47.830 
can usually sort through there this is a

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:53.680 
can usually sort through there this is a
$22<00:06:48.830> gallon<00:06:49.730> of<00:06:50.050> exterior<00:06:51.050> latex<00:06:51.440> paint<00:06:52.690> but

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:53.690 
$22 gallon of exterior latex paint but

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:55.420 
$22 gallon of exterior latex paint but
because<00:06:54.050> it<00:06:54.410> isn't<00:06:54.770> the<00:06:54.860> color<00:06:55.100> that<00:06:55.340> the

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:55.430 
because it isn't the color that the

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:59.590 
because it isn't the color that the
customer<00:06:55.910> wanted<00:06:56.330> it<00:06:57.230> only<00:06:57.440> costs<00:06:57.800> me<00:06:57.860> $8<00:06:58.600> so

00:06:59.590 --> 00:06:59.600 
customer wanted it only costs me $8 so

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:01.870 
customer wanted it only costs me $8 so
next<00:07:00.410> time<00:07:00.620> you<00:07:00.860> need<00:07:00.890> to<00:07:01.070> some<00:07:01.340> paint<00:07:01.610> for<00:07:01.820> a
