to make another one maybe like appear

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:42.199 
to make another one maybe like appear
somewhere<00:02:38.209> for<00:02:39.209> that<00:02:39.329> middle<00:02:39.599> row<00:02:41.030> and<00:02:42.030> I've

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
somewhere for that middle row and I've

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:44.839 
somewhere for that middle row and I've
got<00:02:42.329> a<00:02:42.360> string<00:02:42.780> on<00:02:42.900> my<00:02:43.019> dotting<00:02:43.260> tool<00:02:43.849> don't

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:44.849 
got a string on my dotting tool don't

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:48.050 
got a string on my dotting tool don't
want<00:02:45.000> that<00:02:45.180> and<00:02:46.400> I'm<00:02:47.400> going<00:02:47.579> to<00:02:47.640> do<00:02:47.819> another

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
want that and I'm going to do another

00:02:48.060 --> 00:03:06.330 
want that and I'm going to do another
one<00:02:50.959> let's<00:02:51.959> say<00:02:52.319> like<00:02:53.010> over<00:02:53.430> here

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.369 

okay<00:03:07.000> so<00:03:07.360> that's<00:03:07.510> going<00:03:07.660> to<00:03:07.720> be<00:03:07.780> all<00:03:07.989> going<00:03:08.230> out

00:03:08.369 --> 00:03:08.379 
okay so that's going to be all going out

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:12.270 
okay so that's going to be all going out
this<00:03:08.560> dark<00:03:08.890> purple<00:03:10.709> and<00:03:11.709> I'm<00:03:11.920> just<00:03:12.069> going<00:03:12.190> to

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
this dark purple and I'm just going to

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.320 
this dark purple and I'm just going to
do<00:03:12.430> one<00:03:12.700> right<00:03:13.060> above<00:03:14.849> this<00:03:15.849> one's<00:03:16.090> a<00:03:16.239> little

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330 
do one right above this one's a little

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:23.520 
do one right above this one's a little
bit<00:03:16.569> harder<00:03:16.900> to<00:03:17.080> see<00:03:17.319> until<00:03:17.769> it's<00:03:17.950> dry<00:03:18.220> but<00:03:22.530> a

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
bit harder to see until it's dry but a

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.170 
bit harder to see until it's dry but a
lot<00:03:23.799> of<00:03:23.830> the<00:03:23.980> Indian<00:03:24.310> corn<00:03:24.580> does<00:03:24.790> have<00:03:25.000> this

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
lot of the Indian corn does have this

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:30.000 
lot of the Indian corn does have this
dark<00:03:27.209> almost<00:03:28.209> a<00:03:28.420> bluish<00:03:28.840> purple<00:03:29.349> color<00:03:29.560> to<00:03:29.860> it

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
dark almost a bluish purple color to it

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.130 
dark almost a bluish purple color to it
and<00:03:30.730> I<00:03:30.849> think<00:03:30.940> we'll<00:03:31.209> just<00:03:31.420> do<00:03:31.599> to<00:03:31.810> it<00:03:31.959> I'm

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
and I think we'll just do to it I'm

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:51.770 
and I think we'll just do to it I'm
taking<00:03:32.709> the<00:03:32.890> orange<00:03:33.220> color

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.570 

and<00:03:52.780> as<00:03:52.960> I<00:03:53.170> do<00:03:53.230> the<00:03:53.560> row<00:03:53.710> next<00:03:54.010> to<00:03:54.130> it<00:03:54.340> you<00:03:54.430> can

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:54.580 
and as I do the row next to it you can

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.150 
and as I do the row next to it you can
see<00:03:54.820> that<00:03:55.000> I'm<00:03:55.120> kind<00:03:55.360> of<00:03:55.450> going<00:03:55.690> in<00:03:56.560> between

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 
see that I'm kind of going in between

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.880 
see that I'm kind of going in between
the<00:03:58.090> dark<00:03:58.480> purple<00:03:58.900> and<00:03:59.050> the<00:03:59.110> yellow<00:03:59.410> going<00:03:59.740> in

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890 
the dark purple and the yellow going in

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:02.550 
the dark purple and the yellow going in
between<00:04:00.250> because<00:04:01.150> again<00:04:01.690> on<00:04:01.870> the<00:04:02.050> corn<00:04:02.320> you'll

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
between because again on the corn you'll

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:09.800 
between because again on the corn you'll
notice<00:04:02.920> that<00:04:02.950> is<00:04:03.310> not<00:04:05.160> it's<00:04:06.160> not<00:04:08.010> there<00:04:09.010> not<00:04:09.160> a

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
notice that is not it's not there not a

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.640 
notice that is not it's not there not a
parallel<00:04:10.810> I<00:04:10.840> guess<00:04:11.110> is<00:04:11.290> the<00:04:11.410> word<00:04:11.440> I'm<00:04:11.620> looking

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
parallel I guess is the word I'm looking

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:22.310 
parallel I guess is the word I'm looking
for

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:33.890 

so<00:04:22.950> next<00:04:23.130> I<00:04:23.340> have<00:04:23.490> my<00:04:23.670> light<00:04:23.910> yellow

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:35.870 

and<00:04:34.139> you<00:04:34.650> can<00:04:34.830> see<00:04:35.009> I'm<00:04:35.100> leaving<00:04:35.400> a<00:04:35.490> little<00:04:35.669> bit

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880 
and you can see I'm leaving a little bit

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.980 
and you can see I'm leaving a little bit
of<00:04:36.000> space<00:04:36.270> in<00:04:36.570> between<00:04:36.720> each<00:04:36.930> kernel<00:04:37.410> and

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:38.990 
of space in between each kernel and

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.600 
of space in between each kernel and
that's<00:04:39.990> where<00:04:40.229> our<00:04:40.259> dark<00:04:40.740> color<00:04:41.040> is<00:04:41.310> going<00:04:41.520> to

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610 
that's where our dark color is going to

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:46.700 
that's where our dark color is going to
show<00:04:41.820> up<00:04:42.030> in<00:04:42.150> between<00:04:45.169> so<00:04:46.169> that<00:04:46.320> we<00:04:46.410> don't<00:04:46.560> have

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
show up in between so that we don't have

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.629 
show up in between so that we don't have
to<00:04:47.100> trace<00:04:48.000> each<00:04:48.300> kernel<00:04:48.660> with<00:04:48.900> black<00:04:49.490> or<00:04:50.490> with

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:50.639 
to trace each kernel with black or with

00:04:50.639 --> 00:05:04.050 
to trace each kernel with black or with
the<00:04:50.789> dark

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:04.060 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:17.450 

alright

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:17.460 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.520 

alright<00:05:18.240> we've<00:05:18.389> got<00:05:18.419> our<00:05:18.720> maroon<00:05:19.050> color<00:05:19.289> now

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:19.530 
alright we've got our maroon color now

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:21.680 
alright we've got our maroon color now

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:21.690 
which is our last color and that's just

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:23.510 
which is our last color and that's just
going<00:05:21.900> to<00:05:21.990> go<00:05:22.139> in<00:05:22.169> the<00:05:22.620> spots<00:05:22.949> that<00:05:23.160> are<00:05:23.340> left

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:55.630 
and there's the final look you can see a

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:57.060 
and there's the final look you can see a
little<00:05:55.870> bit<00:05:56.050> of<00:05:56.110> the<00:05:56.230> color<00:05:56.260> smeared<00:05:56.800> together
