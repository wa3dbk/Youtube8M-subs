00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:06.010
 we continue the discovery of a bag the party and the women met 

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:08.459
 were already quite a lot of points 

00:00:08.459 --> 00:00:10.879
 Corsican independence 

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:13.079
 the same meaning and the telephony part 

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:14.969
 for that, several reasons for that 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.089
 the first is that we do not have the same hours 

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:19.699
 with a sim card 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:22.699
 so we wonder how is it 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.849
 the lay the day before the communication part and Algerian pardon 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.670
 the second is what the phone does not have a physical button 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:34.890
 to pick up hooked like on an iphone so the telephony part she 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:35.550
 is really 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.690
 to manage their common applications 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:40.840
 like the disability situation 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.960
 so we wondered what to launch the application is what was 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.740
 still there 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:47.000
 available 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.080
 - success a little brown phone with a nikos now at the 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.920
 ball to the application phone economy friendly contacts last ago 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.610
 seven weeks nsn insured afp 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:01.790
 talent to the phone application launches so as a normal application 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.200
 at the moment 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.710
 it supports the landscape mode send it is fluid enough we thought 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.710
 really a happiness to use in mode 2 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.090
 because they because here are the keys migrants and we have a return 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:20.170
 of force then 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:21.910
 because we have since 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:23.050
 we feel it 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.799
 could then just pass the call so here we will do a test 

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:29.440
 take 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.440
 with the respondent 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.340
 so when we call we have different elements that will not show up at the 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.540
 ability to mute the possibility of having a file on 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:40.920
 Did you know 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.340
 the harmfulness 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:43.930
 to pass 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.030
 in speaker mode 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.460
 make sure you're done to answer the form 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.940
 the ability to give two argue in apps that 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.940
 you see there the telephony part since the application will know 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.560
 smiling 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.070
 that's okay then 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.050
 for the flights piling up its customers have little mud we can choose if we 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:05.810
 wish that advance 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.820
 rotation automatically we share 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.469
 there I am still a warrant 

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:11.659
 what's interesting is that when you're online with a contact 

00:02:11.659 --> 00:02:12.449
 ap 

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:13.889
 an unknown person 

00:02:13.889 --> 00:02:17.229
 just click on it so there's a charge of combat that appears 

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:22.879
 interesting enough on board an airplane sent a sms can exceed the 

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:23.879
 meaning calais-reims 

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:26.240
 percent while those in contact 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.459
 so we can add them to the directory 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:31.109
 all the next joy 

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:34.260
 it is touching it is well done we have a call log to give in to do 

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:37.629
 so we have a signage very easily identifiable we drove 

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:40.819
 missed calls in blue and calls 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:43.440
 past and return calls received 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.490
 with each time the vignette so what we want is a blow 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:48.649
 in the three 

00:02:48.649 --> 00:02:50.269
 and when you kill me 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:53.019
 here we can open the business card directly from the context where 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:56.019
 delete delete the entry 

00:02:57.379 --> 00:03:00.379
 here for the clearance part a little on the phone 

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:03.779
 I'm talking about navigation are compared to the data in time to select 

00:03:03.779 --> 00:03:06.779
 a provider 

00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:10.589
 by positioning directly contact that in the great repertoire 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:16.569
 when in the mode the alarming portrait swept these countries the letters 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:18.689
 which is displayed so we can very easily arrive 

00:03:18.689 --> 00:03:21.999
 contact according to needs 

00:03:21.999 --> 00:03:23.789
 we are looking for 

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:26.609
 it is the order in portrait mode 

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:30.879
 yeah that's it if we miss a call timer has broken business 

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:35.439
 but that allows to have a detail mobile calls said a doctor 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.639
 since this weekend 

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:39.769
 we also 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:42.969
 bank account management the answer is referred 

00:03:42.969 --> 00:03:46.729
 we have the possibility to define several peoples with several types 

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:47.659
 of contracts 

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:49.629
 goldstone scariolo 

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:51.779
 ip telephony also 

00:03:51.779 --> 00:03:55.389
 so here I will try for example the dancer type of calls that we want 

00:03:55.389 --> 00:03:58.389
 make 

00:04:00.529 --> 00:04:03.759
 I will call my friend and I will cybercrime my friend Julian 

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:06.759
 apart from an observation that is why we contact 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:10.430
 decidedly the best on this case he is on the sideline 

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:14.159
 to the joy that is online 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.090
 call attempt 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.139
 she was saying that he was not taking care of the trouble money made way soweto 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:29.139
 account I was that meaning calais reims it works 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:35.370
 the f-150 anyway it works we had tested with the clubs 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.690
 batista and so we get to sam to pascal can directly since the 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:41.690
 3g network sfr so that's a good news 

00:04:43.309 --> 00:04:46.370
 So here is the level -1 6% and the part 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:48.759
 we must put it into play 

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:51.479
 they have mostly what we eat wait for a phone part we have a 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:54.479
 attacked history very comfortable that his story is why the 

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:54.980
 media 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:57.389
 and who percent were very complete 

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:01.620
 we had the opportunity to support at different times often system on 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:03.170
 between one has a keyboard 

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:06.440
 who is willing to communicate who is embarrassing since the beginning at the end 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:10.789
 we have the opportunity to choose what cyberdefense the past 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:15.190
 we have the possibility to choose directly in his contacts of 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.580
 fast way 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.580
 another interesting point that we have the possibility 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:24.339
 when the phone app is not a is not open 

00:05:24.339 --> 00:05:28.150
 abbas to directly ask the world the name of the contact on the keyboard 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:30.620
 the club of the capital 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:33.620
 and here we will have the list 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:39.539
 a message 

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:41.839
 it's like the year 

00:05:41.839 --> 00:05:45.159
 at the time when blockages in e10 and reese 

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:48.159
 in the phone part on the nokia n900 I find that 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:52.360
 she had won a good phone call the majority of 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:53.930
 phones she is very complete 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:56.930
 they allow to subscribe to a protocol of beautiful meetings 

00:05:57.529 --> 00:05:59.860
 so that's pretty good news 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:03.199
 after the wii if the application is like any other but you have to announce it via 

00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:06.729
 a dedicated icon so 5 5 it can be a little painful juppÃ© once 

00:06:06.729 --> 00:06:09.509
 we confirmed it's not more complicated than going into a tiny 

00:06:09.509 --> 00:06:13.279
 press the green keys or g to select a contact 

00:06:13.279 --> 00:06:16.739
 I found that making a call using his service weapon with a 

00:06:16.739 --> 00:06:17.719
 other device 

00:06:17.719 --> 00:06:21.430
 and also remembered as easy and the quality of communication is very 

00:06:21.429 --> 00:06:22.819
 good 

00:06:22.819 --> 00:06:25.570
 whether in speaker mode or normal mode 

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:29.199
 he left his network with sfr in any case she is very good
