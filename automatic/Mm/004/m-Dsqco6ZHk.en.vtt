sports<00:02:17.360> do<00:02:17.750> you<00:02:17.810> envisage<00:02:18.020> this<00:02:18.290> is<00:02:18.440> going<00:02:18.560> to

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
sports do you envisage this is going to

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.040 
sports do you envisage this is going to
be<00:02:18.770> most<00:02:19.250> useful<00:02:19.340> for<00:02:19.820> so<00:02:20.270> we<00:02:20.390> have<00:02:20.630> come<00:02:20.900> to

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
be most useful for so we have come to

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.620 
be most useful for so we have come to
garments<00:02:21.530> in<00:02:21.740> both<00:02:22.040> our<00:02:22.370> ascent<00:02:23.000> range<00:02:23.240> so

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
garments in both our ascent range so

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.900 
garments in both our ascent range so
that's<00:02:24.260> really<00:02:24.440> mountain<00:02:24.950> focused<00:02:25.520> but<00:02:25.760> and

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
that's really mountain focused but and

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.430 
that's really mountain focused but and
then<00:02:26.030> we<00:02:26.120> also<00:02:26.300> have<00:02:26.540> a<00:02:26.570> composite<00:02:26.930> garment<00:02:27.290> as

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
then we also have a composite garment as

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.470 
then we also have a composite garment as
part<00:02:27.740> of<00:02:27.860> our<00:02:28.010> white<00:02:28.610> line<00:02:28.790> range<00:02:29.060> so<00:02:29.270> that's

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
part of our white line range so that's

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.420 
part of our white line range so that's
really<00:02:29.630> based<00:02:29.930> or<00:02:30.200> ski<00:02:30.470> touring<00:02:30.860> and<00:02:30.980> high

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
one this extremely heavy trophy and it's

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.540 
one this extremely heavy trophy and it's
quite<00:02:47.330> a<00:02:47.360> cool<00:02:48.050> idea<00:02:48.200> that<00:02:48.739> basically<00:02:49.190> soft

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
quite a cool idea that basically soft

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:51.009 
quite a cool idea that basically soft

I<00:02:51.080> guess<00:02:51.260> would<00:02:51.410> be<00:02:51.440> where<00:02:51.769> the<00:02:51.890> to<00:02:52.040> join<00:02:52.370> but

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
I guess would be where the to join but

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.759 
I guess would be where the to join but
