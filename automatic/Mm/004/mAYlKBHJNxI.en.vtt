00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:09.860
 next here we have a blind 

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:12.869
 horizontal 2-inch and a half call 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.910
 Horizontal blind type cutter 

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:18.000
 charles shooters as they are known in 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.849
 the market as they have start with 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.210
 2-inch wooden tablets or sheets 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:28.050
 and a half in this case this is not a 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:30.060
 shooter but it has the tablet and the width 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.240
 of the 2-inch wooden tablet and 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:36.090
 average and the advantage of this blind that 

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:38.550
 makes it look very elegant is the cornice 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.280
 decorative in this case this cornice 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.859
 since it measures around 14 centimeters 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.379
 height and it gives and it gives much 

00:00:43.859 --> 00:00:48.629
 elegance to what is the blind 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.780
 apart you can appreciate that this 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.670
 shutter does not have us the tablets 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.469
 of wood are not stamped 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.879
 it means that you 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:02.719
 they will practically have if I were 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:07.050
 perforated had about 75 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:08.250
 die-cut 25 25 and 25 and in this case 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.640
 well 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:14.430
 in all the light input we will proceed 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.990
 here open what is the blind of 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.450
 wood 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.479
 if in this case good this is the 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.520
 elevator we have it on the other side as 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:27.470
 we saw here this is the cornice 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:30.060
 decorative note this is not gallery 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:33.180
 gallery is much simpler this is 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:38.070
 a cornice of 14 centimeters in height 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:40.369
 is this cornice is that is optional and 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:45.040
 It gives a lot of body what is the 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:48.840
 blind let's see what is the operation 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:51.090
 and here we can notice what 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.130
 let's see the outward visibility this 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.770
 blind has a highly visible 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.829
 as 50 percent visibility is 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.780
 Outside this we will not achieve 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:03.450
 a horizontal wood blind of 2 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.800
 inches because for precisely 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:10.729
 because the blade is wider 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:13.610
 here as I told you the tablets are not 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:17.030
 die-cut this is a double system 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:19.640
 of double cord on the ladder that 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:22.310
 they allow the tablets to tilt 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:26.850
 without being stamped and they save all 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:29.340
 so what is all the light input 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:32.010
 and obviously for safety because I do not 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.810
 come in case of a robbery do not see it from 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.370
 outside inwards in this case 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.890
 also all our versions 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.830
 they handle a real trapezoidal part 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.920
 not lower light filters this 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:46.250
 blind could also have been 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:50.940
 ordered with a cane and at the same price 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:55.620
 so then with this we hope to have 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:59.250
 been this one to have explained what is 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:01.370
 because beauty is blind and the and 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.620
 what is this 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.659
 because the touch of elegance that gives 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.879
 the decorative cornice and then 

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:11.209
 It is definitely horizontal 

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:14.090
 two and a half inches wood 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:16.640
 Shooter is much more elegant than 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:19.280
 the two- inch traditional and by the 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:22.239
 good functionality we thank you very much 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.239
 its time thanks
