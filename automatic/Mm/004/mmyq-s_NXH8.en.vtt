00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
in this clip I'm going to show how to

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.320 
in this clip I'm going to show how to
remove<00:00:08.069> the<00:00:08.670> top<00:00:08.940> off<00:00:09.210> of<00:00:09.240> an<00:00:09.570> acoustic<00:00:10.050> guitar

the guitar I chose for this is actually

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.640 
the guitar I chose for this is actually
a<00:00:14.219> very<00:00:14.490> low<00:00:14.820> cost

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:15.650 
a very low cost

Costco guitar with a plywood top the

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.790 
Costco guitar with a plywood top the
idea<00:00:20.010> is<00:00:20.189> that<00:00:20.369> I'm<00:00:20.580> going<00:00:20.880> to<00:00:21.380> make<00:00:22.380> a<00:00:22.410> brand

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
idea is that I'm going to make a brand

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.939 
idea is that I'm going to make a brand
new<00:00:22.920> solid<00:00:23.490> wood<00:00:23.640> top<00:00:24.470> starting<00:00:25.470> off<00:00:25.619> with

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
new solid wood top starting off with

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.759 
new solid wood top starting off with
removing<00:00:26.580> the<00:00:26.730> bridge<00:00:27.000> so<00:00:27.929> for<00:00:28.109> this<00:00:28.230> part<00:00:28.560> we

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
removing the bridge so for this part we

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.890 
removing the bridge so for this part we
heat<00:00:29.519> up<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:29.699> bridge<00:00:30.000> and<00:00:30.269> get<00:00:30.539> through<00:00:30.779> the

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
heat up the bridge and get through the

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:37.549 
heat up the bridge and get through the
glue<00:00:35.180> my<00:00:36.180> total<00:00:36.570> choice<00:00:36.809> to<00:00:37.140> start<00:00:37.410> on

glue my total choice to start on

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.950 
glue my total choice to start on
removing<00:00:37.980> a<00:00:38.039> bridge<00:00:38.420> would<00:00:39.420> be<00:00:39.570> to<00:00:39.690> use<00:00:39.930> a

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
removing a bridge would be to use a

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.540 
removing a bridge would be to use a
cheap<00:00:40.620> clothing<00:00:41.010> iron<00:00:41.309> I<00:00:41.719> heat<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.899> iron<00:00:43.550> put

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
cheap clothing iron I heat the iron put

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.549 
cheap clothing iron I heat the iron put
it<00:00:44.670> on<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.940> bridge<00:00:45.180> let<00:00:45.870> it<00:00:45.989> sit<00:00:46.289> and<00:00:46.320> melt

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
it on the bridge let it sit and melt

it on the bridge let it sit and melt
through<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:46.920> glue<00:00:47.100> for<00:00:47.340> a<00:00:47.399> bit<00:00:47.550> and<00:00:47.760> then<00:00:48.410> it's

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
through the glue for a bit and then it's

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.029 
through the glue for a bit and then it's
time<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:49.649> start<00:00:49.800> prying<00:00:51.649> after<00:00:52.649> I<00:00:52.680> get<00:00:52.800> it<00:00:52.980> a

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
time to start prying after I get it a

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.680 
time to start prying after I get it a
little<00:00:53.190> bit<00:00:53.399> loose<00:00:53.609> and<00:00:53.940> then<00:00:54.030> switch<00:00:54.359> up<00:00:54.539> to

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
little bit loose and then switch up to

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.319 
little bit loose and then switch up to
steam<00:00:55.399> in<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.489> same<00:00:56.730> way<00:00:56.879> that<00:00:57.000> one<00:00:57.120> might

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
steam in the same way that one might

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.869 
steam in the same way that one might
steam<00:00:57.629> out<00:00:57.809> a<00:00:57.840> neck<00:00:58.170> or<00:00:58.199> do<00:00:58.620> others<00:00:58.949> parts<00:00:59.699> I

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
steam out a neck or do others parts I

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.009 
steam out a neck or do others parts I
use<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.570> an<00:01:00.870> old<00:01:01.050> cappuccino<00:01:01.800> maker<00:01:01.949> and

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:03.019 
use the an old cappuccino maker and

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:06.290 
use the an old cappuccino maker and
start<00:01:04.190> putting<00:01:05.190> steam<00:01:05.550> under<00:01:05.880> there<00:01:06.060> and

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:06.300 
start putting steam under there and

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.600 
start putting steam under there and
loosening<00:01:07.050> the<00:01:07.200> glue<00:01:07.410> as<00:01:07.740> it<00:01:07.979> eats<00:01:08.369> through

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
loosening the glue as it eats through

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.749 
loosening the glue as it eats through
although<00:01:09.600> it<00:01:09.780> makes<00:01:09.930> a<00:01:10.080> bit<00:01:10.229> of<00:01:10.350> a<00:01:10.409> mess<00:01:10.759> start

00:01:11.749 --> 00:01:11.759 
although it makes a bit of a mess start

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:13.340 
although it makes a bit of a mess start
softening<00:01:12.090> everything<00:01:12.420> up<00:01:12.840> and<00:01:13.020> in<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.140> long

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
softening everything up and in the long

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.160 
softening everything up and in the long
run<00:01:13.380> makes<00:01:13.770> it<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:13.979> lot<00:01:14.189> easier<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:14.850> get<00:01:15.000> off<00:01:15.210> as

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
run makes it a lot easier to get off as

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.840 
run makes it a lot easier to get off as
you<00:01:16.350> can<00:01:16.500> see<00:01:16.770> there's<00:01:17.100> a<00:01:17.159> section<00:01:17.640> where

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
you can see there's a section where

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.690 
you can see there's a section where
basically<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.659> needle<00:01:19.409> is<00:01:19.530> under<00:01:19.740> there<00:01:19.950> let

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
basically the needle is under there let

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.940 
basically the needle is under there let
it<00:01:20.729> soften<00:01:21.030> up<00:01:21.329> and<00:01:21.450> I<00:01:21.540> just<00:01:21.780> slowly<00:01:22.140> pry<00:01:22.619> it<00:01:22.680> up

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
it soften up and I just slowly pry it up

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.270 
it soften up and I just slowly pry it up
I<00:01:23.939> suggest<00:01:24.930> being<00:01:25.140> careful<00:01:25.650> here<00:01:25.829> if<00:01:25.950> you<00:01:26.040> plan

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
I suggest being careful here if you plan

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.090 
I suggest being careful here if you plan
to<00:01:26.310> reuse<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:26.939> bridge<00:01:27.320> which<00:01:28.320> in<00:01:28.470> this<00:01:28.650> case<00:01:28.860> I

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
to reuse the bridge which in this case I

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.010 
to reuse the bridge which in this case I
hope<00:01:29.310> -<00:01:29.549> one<00:01:30.000> can<00:01:30.180> always<00:01:30.329> go<00:01:30.540> back<00:01:30.570> and<00:01:30.869> make

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
hope - one can always go back and make

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.590 
hope - one can always go back and make
another<00:01:31.189> but<00:01:32.189> if<00:01:32.549> you<00:01:32.610> have<00:01:32.939> a<00:01:32.970> decent<00:01:33.240> bridge

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
another but if you have a decent bridge

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.050 
another but if you have a decent bridge
on<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:33.899> guitar<00:01:34.399> there's<00:01:35.399> no<00:01:35.579> reason<00:01:35.939> really

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
on the guitar there's no reason really

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.399 
on the guitar there's no reason really
to<00:01:36.270> let<00:01:36.420> that<00:01:36.600> go<00:01:36.840> to<00:01:36.899> waste

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:39.409 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:42.139 

take<00:01:40.409> your<00:01:40.590> time<00:01:40.799> here<00:01:41.130> doesn't<00:01:42.000> really

00:01:42.139 --> 00:01:42.149 
take your time here doesn't really

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:44.630 
take your time here doesn't really
matter<00:01:42.390> if<00:01:42.570> you<00:01:42.659> do<00:01:42.810> damage<00:01:43.079> to<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.560> top<00:01:43.829> but

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
matter if you do damage to the top but

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.810 
matter if you do damage to the top but
if<00:01:44.939> you<00:01:45.090> can<00:01:45.329> you<00:01:45.540> want<00:01:45.689> to<00:01:45.780> preserve<00:01:46.110> the

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 
if you can you want to preserve the

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.130 
if you can you want to preserve the
bridge<00:01:47.820> so<00:01:48.119> that<00:01:48.270> you<00:01:48.329> don't<00:01:48.509> have<00:01:48.689> to<00:01:48.810> go<00:01:48.930> back

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
bridge so that you don't have to go back

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.380 
bridge so that you don't have to go back
and<00:01:49.290> remake<00:01:49.590> it<00:01:49.619> one<00:01:50.579> of<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.729> reasons<00:01:51.030> I<00:01:51.149> like

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
and remake it one of the reasons I like

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.030 
and remake it one of the reasons I like
to<00:01:51.570> remove<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:51.930> bridge<00:01:52.170> is<00:01:52.380> so<00:01:52.560> that<00:01:52.740> later<00:01:52.920> on

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
to remove the bridge is so that later on

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.410 
to remove the bridge is so that later on
when<00:01:53.460> it's<00:01:53.610> time<00:01:53.759> to<00:01:53.850> put<00:01:54.000> it<00:01:54.060> in<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.180> router

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
when it's time to put it in the router

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.840 
when it's time to put it in the router
the<00:01:55.079> bridge<00:01:55.320> is<00:01:55.500> free<00:01:55.799> and<00:01:56.040> also<00:01:56.310> I<00:01:56.340> can<00:01:56.579> lay

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
the bridge is free and also I can lay

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.209 
the bridge is free and also I can lay
the<00:01:57.090> top<00:01:57.299> of<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.509> guitar<00:01:57.630> down<00:01:58.219> onto

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
the top of the guitar down onto

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.560 
the top of the guitar down onto
something<00:01:59.549> so<00:01:59.700> I<00:01:59.729> can<00:01:59.939> trace<00:02:00.240> it<00:02:00.420> as<00:02:00.539> a

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
something so I can trace it as a

that<00:02:05.939> there<00:02:06.180> may<00:02:06.420> be<00:02:06.450> different<00:02:07.110> ways<00:02:07.140> of

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
that there may be different ways of

here<00:02:45.769> see<00:02:46.769> that<00:02:47.180> occasionally<00:02:48.180> it'll<00:02:48.359> dry<00:02:48.659> out

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
here see that occasionally it'll dry out

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:49.910 
here see that occasionally it'll dry out
again<00:02:48.900> and<00:02:49.319> you're<00:02:49.409> going<00:02:49.500> to<00:02:49.560> have<00:02:49.680> to<00:02:49.799> go

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
again and you're going to have to go

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.259 
again and you're going to have to go
back<00:02:49.950> through<00:02:50.340> and<00:02:50.370> put<00:02:50.609> a<00:02:50.639> little<00:02:50.790> more<00:02:50.879> steam

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
back through and put a little more steam

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:56.330 
back through and put a little more steam
in<00:02:53.510> once<00:02:54.510> again<00:02:54.659> I<00:02:55.049> suggest<00:02:55.980> you<00:02:56.099> take<00:02:56.280> your

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
in once again I suggest you take your

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.729 
in once again I suggest you take your
time<00:02:56.700> doesn't<00:02:57.599> take<00:02:57.750> much<00:02:57.989> to<00:02:58.230> start<00:02:58.500> getting

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
time doesn't take much to start getting

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:01.879 
time doesn't take much to start getting
wood<00:02:58.919> to<00:02:59.069> split<00:02:59.220> as<00:02:59.609> I<00:03:00.180> said<00:03:00.450> the<00:03:00.689> top<00:03:01.560> is<00:03:01.769> not

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:01.889 
wood to split as I said the top is not

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:04.309 
wood to split as I said the top is not
really<00:03:02.220> the<00:03:02.340> issue<00:03:02.629> but<00:03:03.629> the<00:03:03.780> bridge<00:03:03.989> plate

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
really the issue but the bridge plate

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:06.860 
really the issue but the bridge plate
can<00:03:05.040> be<00:03:05.159> a<00:03:05.189> little<00:03:05.400> bit<00:03:05.489> of<00:03:05.579> a<00:03:05.639> pain<00:03:05.879> really

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
can be a little bit of a pain really

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.780 
can be a little bit of a pain really
nice<00:03:07.019> high-end<00:03:07.290> guitars<00:03:07.799> use<00:03:08.069> ebony<00:03:08.489> or<00:03:08.519> other

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
nice high-end guitars use ebony or other

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.580 
nice high-end guitars use ebony or other
really<00:03:09.239> hard<00:03:09.269> woods<00:03:09.659> to<00:03:09.840> make<00:03:09.900> a<00:03:10.019> bridge<00:03:10.290> plate

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
really hard woods to make a bridge plate

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.720 
really hard woods to make a bridge plate
I<00:03:11.060> doubt<00:03:12.060> that<00:03:12.269> that's<00:03:12.389> what's<00:03:12.659> used<00:03:12.840> on<00:03:13.019> this

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
I doubt that that's what's used on this

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:18.080 
I doubt that that's what's used on this
potentially<00:03:14.730> this<00:03:14.849> is<00:03:14.909> mahogany<00:03:15.389> or<00:03:17.090> rosewood

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
potentially this is mahogany or rosewood

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.089 
potentially this is mahogany or rosewood
or<00:03:18.599> something<00:03:18.959> of<00:03:19.049> that<00:03:19.079> sort<00:03:19.470> but<00:03:19.590> once<00:03:20.010> again

00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:20.099 
or something of that sort but once again

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:22.430 
or something of that sort but once again
I<00:03:20.400> doubt<00:03:20.700> it<00:03:20.909> it's<00:03:21.090> probably<00:03:21.629> a<00:03:21.659> much<00:03:22.139> lower

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
I doubt it it's probably a much lower

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.280 
I doubt it it's probably a much lower
grade<00:03:22.769> wood<00:03:23.040> that's<00:03:23.310> been<00:03:23.549> painted<00:03:24.540> brown<00:03:24.959> or

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
grade wood that's been painted brown or

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.559 
grade wood that's been painted brown or
almost<00:03:25.979> black<00:03:26.370> just<00:03:26.699> to<00:03:26.790> match<00:03:27.060> and<00:03:27.329> look<00:03:27.419> like

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:27.569 
almost black just to match and look like

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:30.710 
almost black just to match and look like
it's<00:03:27.750> a<00:03:27.810> better<00:03:27.930> guitar<00:03:29.359> once<00:03:30.359> again<00:03:30.599> I'm

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
it's a better guitar once again I'm

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.619 
it's a better guitar once again I'm
adding<00:03:30.959> a<00:03:31.019> little<00:03:31.139> more<00:03:31.290> steam<00:03:32.359> when<00:03:33.359> I<00:03:33.389> get<00:03:33.540> to

00:03:33.619 --> 00:03:33.629 
adding a little more steam when I get to

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:34.969 
adding a little more steam when I get to
the<00:03:33.750> point<00:03:33.989> where<00:03:34.109> I<00:03:34.139> can<00:03:34.349> finally<00:03:34.560> take<00:03:34.889> it

00:03:34.969 --> 00:03:34.979 
the point where I can finally take it

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:37.610 
the point where I can finally take it
off<00:03:35.129> and<00:03:36.060> see<00:03:36.239> the<00:03:36.389> steam<00:03:36.659> is<00:03:36.810> rolling<00:03:37.169> in<00:03:37.349> it's

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
off and see the steam is rolling in it's

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.860 
off and see the steam is rolling in it's
coming<00:03:37.949> out<00:03:38.040> of<00:03:38.159> the<00:03:38.359> pinholes<00:03:39.359> it's<00:03:39.690> also

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
coming out of the pinholes it's also

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.050 
coming out of the pinholes it's also
coming<00:03:40.229> through<00:03:40.560> the<00:03:40.680> sound<00:03:40.919> hole<00:03:41.159> it's<00:03:42.000> a

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
coming through the sound hole it's a

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.509 
coming through the sound hole it's a
good<00:03:42.239> side<00:03:42.479> it<00:03:42.690> means<00:03:42.780> things<00:03:43.139> are<00:03:43.260> loose<00:03:43.519> it's

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
good side it means things are loose it's

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:52.840 
good side it means things are loose it's
penetrating

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:52.850 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:54.010 

what<00:03:52.940> are<00:03:53.000> the<00:03:53.090> nice<00:03:53.210> things<00:03:53.450> about<00:03:53.510> working

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:54.020 
what are the nice things about working

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:57.520 
what are the nice things about working
with<00:03:54.170> wood<00:03:54.470> is<00:03:54.770> that<00:03:55.420> it's<00:03:56.420> very<00:03:56.870> resilient

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
with wood is that it's very resilient

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.130 
with wood is that it's very resilient
it's<00:03:58.430> a<00:03:58.490> natural<00:03:58.880> material<00:03:59.000> that<00:03:59.540> encounters

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140 
it's a natural material that encounters

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.920 
it's a natural material that encounters
water<00:04:00.470> in<00:04:00.710> nature<00:04:01.070> and<00:04:01.540> if<00:04:02.540> you're<00:04:02.660> careful

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
water in nature and if you're careful

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:06.400 
water in nature and if you're careful
you<00:04:03.580> can<00:04:04.580> basically<00:04:05.120> let<00:04:05.270> it<00:04:05.390> dry<00:04:05.690> out<00:04:05.720> and<00:04:06.140> get

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:06.410 
you can basically let it dry out and get

and<00:04:41.660> realize<00:04:41.960> that<00:04:41.990> there<00:04:42.350> were<00:04:42.440> two<00:04:42.650> dowels

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
and realize that there were two dowels

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:47.050 
and realize that there were two dowels
sticking<00:04:43.400> up<00:04:43.690> just<00:04:44.690> past<00:04:44.930> the<00:04:45.730> saddle<00:04:46.730> on<00:04:46.820> each

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:50.170 
sticking up just past the saddle on each
side<00:04:47.360> I<00:04:48.400> left<00:04:49.400> that<00:04:49.580> part<00:04:49.820> out<00:04:50.000> of<00:04:50.060> the

side I left that part out of the

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:52.270 
side I left that part out of the
photograph<00:04:51.140> but<00:04:51.320> you<00:04:51.410> can<00:04:51.560> see<00:04:51.770> as<00:04:51.920> I<00:04:51.950> worked

it I was able to pull it up he's
pointing<00:04:55.010> here<00:04:55.220> at<00:04:55.310> the<00:04:55.430> two<00:04:55.610> dowels<00:04:55.850> and

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:57.670 
pointing here at the two dowels and

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:02.320 
pointing here at the two dowels and
while<00:04:58.670> everything<00:04:59.060> is<00:04:59.270> still<00:04:59.330> moist<00:05:01.330> it's

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.150 
while everything is still moist it's
it's<00:05:02.690> a<00:05:02.810> good<00:05:02.990> time<00:05:03.260> to<00:05:03.440> try<00:05:03.590> to<00:05:03.680> remove<00:05:03.950> those

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.160 
it's a good time to try to remove those

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.790 
it's a good time to try to remove those
dowels<00:05:04.460> if<00:05:04.670> you<00:05:04.790> want<00:05:05.000> to<00:05:05.350> different<00:05:06.350> methods

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800

dowels if you want to different methods
I<00:05:06.950> was<00:05:07.310> able<00:05:07.460> to<00:05:07.580> use<00:05:07.730> a<00:05:07.760> chisel<00:05:08.090> and<00:05:08.420> just<00:05:08.660> pry

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:09.200 
I was able to use a chisel and just pry

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:12.650 
it out you see here I just carefully

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:15.780 
it out you see here I just carefully
work<00:05:12.980> with<00:05:13.160> it<00:05:13.370> and<00:05:13.610> it<00:05:13.730> just<00:05:13.910> comes<00:05:14.120> right<00:05:14.480> out

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:15.790 
work with it and it just comes right out

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:21.250 
work with it and it just comes right out
and<00:05:17.740> that's<00:05:18.740> bridge<00:05:19.040> removed<00:05:19.750> the<00:05:20.750> next<00:05:21.080> step

this I route a small channel in the

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:30.550 
this I route a small channel in the
binding<00:05:29.150> because<00:05:29.840> I'm<00:05:30.080> going<00:05:30.200> to<00:05:30.290> wind<00:05:30.470> up

replacing the binding anyway when I go

through as you can see in the video I

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:39.000 
through as you can see in the video I
was<00:05:36.020> able<00:05:36.170> to<00:05:36.320> use<00:05:36.740> a<00:05:37.100> bearing<00:05:38.090> on<00:05:38.240> a<00:05:38.300> flush<00:05:38.720> cut

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:39.010 
was able to use a bearing on a flush cut

router bit in the router table and I
just<00:05:42.350> slowly<00:05:42.680> go<00:05:42.950> around<00:05:43.690> cut<00:05:44.690> a<00:05:44.720> nice<00:05:44.930> little

just slowly go around cut a nice little
channel<00:05:47.320> being<00:05:48.320> careful<00:05:48.800> this<00:05:49.640> is<00:05:49.790> actually<00:05:50.150> a

channel being careful this is actually a

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:51.880 
channel being careful this is actually a
really<00:05:50.390> low<00:05:50.660> end<00:05:50.870> guitar<00:05:51.230> and<00:05:51.470> I'm<00:05:51.530> not<00:05:51.680> sure

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:51.890

really low end guitar and I'm not sure
there<00:05:52.040> was<00:05:52.130> very<00:05:52.310> much<00:05:52.520> binding<00:05:53.270> on<00:05:53.450> there<00:05:53.660> was

there was very much binding on there was

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:56.200 
there was very much binding on there was
probably<00:05:54.260> a<00:05:54.350> lot<00:05:54.530> of<00:05:54.590> paint<00:05:54.980> things<00:05:55.910> started

flying<00:05:56.480> off<00:05:56.720> it<00:05:56.930> seemed<00:05:57.200> like<00:05:57.410> black<00:05:57.710> pain<00:05:58.010> was

00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:58.190 
flying off it seemed like black pain was

00:05:58.190 --> 00:05:59.860 
flying off it seemed like black pain was
going<00:05:58.490> everywhere<00:05:58.820> it<00:05:59.450> might<00:05:59.600> have<00:05:59.720> been<00:05:59.810> a

don't<00:06:06.860> worry<00:06:07.040> too<00:06:07.250> much<00:06:07.280> about<00:06:07.430> the<00:06:07.820> top

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:08.030 
don't worry too much about the top

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:09.400 
don't worry too much about the top
you're<00:06:08.330> probably<00:06:08.540> going<00:06:08.750> to<00:06:08.810> replace<00:06:09.170> this

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:09.410 
you're probably going to replace this

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:12.400 
you're probably going to replace this
top<00:06:09.680> anyway<00:06:10.250> and<00:06:10.520> so<00:06:11.360> scratching<00:06:11.900> the<00:06:11.990> top<00:06:12.200> is

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:12.410 
top anyway and so scratching the top is

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:14.500 
top anyway and so scratching the top is
not<00:06:12.530> really<00:06:12.980> a<00:06:13.010> big<00:06:13.400> deal<00:06:13.430> as<00:06:13.910> you<00:06:14.060> can<00:06:14.210> see<00:06:14.390> I'm

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:14.510 
not really a big deal as you can see I'm

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:17.530 
not really a big deal as you can see I'm
just<00:06:14.540> working<00:06:15.110> my<00:06:15.260> way<00:06:15.290> around<00:06:15.880> I<00:06:16.880> took<00:06:17.510> a

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:17.540 
just working my way around I took a

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:19.600 
just working my way around I took a
couple<00:06:17.960> practice<00:06:18.290> cuts<00:06:18.770> which<00:06:19.040> I<00:06:19.160> didn't<00:06:19.430> put

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:19.610 
couple practice cuts which I didn't put

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:22.150 
couple practice cuts which I didn't put
on<00:06:19.790> the<00:06:20.120> video<00:06:20.410> just<00:06:21.410> to<00:06:21.500> make<00:06:21.650> sure<00:06:21.680> I<00:06:21.860> had<00:06:22.130> the

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:22.160 
on the video just to make sure I had the

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.040 
on the video just to make sure I had the
right<00:06:22.400> depth<00:06:22.790> and<00:06:23.120> I<00:06:23.300> was<00:06:23.420> able<00:06:23.690> to<00:06:23.750> get<00:06:23.900> it

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:24.050 
right depth and I was able to get it

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:30.970 
right depth and I was able to get it
exposed<00:06:29.050> overall<00:06:30.050> this<00:06:30.230> is<00:06:30.290> a<00:06:30.410> pretty<00:06:30.500> quick

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:30.980 
exposed overall this is a pretty quick

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:33.490 
exposed overall this is a pretty quick
procedure<00:06:31.430> I'm<00:06:32.180> just<00:06:32.420> taking<00:06:32.720> my<00:06:32.750> time<00:06:32.870> here

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:33.500 
procedure I'm just taking my time here

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:35.350 
procedure I'm just taking my time here
also<00:06:33.770> because<00:06:34.190> it's<00:06:34.340> on<00:06:34.460> film<00:06:34.820> I<00:06:35.030> wanted<00:06:35.240> to

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:35.360 
also because it's on film I wanted to

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:36.700 
also because it's on film I wanted to
make<00:06:35.510> sure<00:06:35.540> that<00:06:35.870> the<00:06:35.990> guy<00:06:36.140> operating<00:06:36.560> the

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:36.710 
make sure that the guy operating the

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:39.310 
make sure that the guy operating the
camera<00:06:37.070> could<00:06:37.250> get<00:06:37.400> everything<00:06:37.610> in<00:06:37.820> place<00:06:38.320> so

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:39.320 
camera could get everything in place so

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:40.600 
camera could get everything in place so
I'm<00:06:39.440> just<00:06:39.590> going<00:06:39.890> kind<00:06:40.040> of<00:06:40.190> slowly<00:06:40.370> you'll

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:40.610 
I'm just going kind of slowly you'll

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:42.160 
I'm just going kind of slowly you'll
notice<00:06:40.970> where<00:06:41.150> you<00:06:41.240> still<00:06:41.510> see<00:06:41.720> some<00:06:41.750> black

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:42.170 
notice where you still see some black

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:44.170 
notice where you still see some black
that's<00:06:42.590> where<00:06:42.740> I<00:06:42.770> think<00:06:42.860> that<00:06:43.130> it's<00:06:43.880> actually

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:44.180 
that's where I think that it's actually

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:46.690 
that's where I think that it's actually
been<00:06:44.300> painted<00:06:44.840> instead<00:06:45.530> of<00:06:45.650> having<00:06:45.830> binding

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:46.700 
been painted instead of having binding

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:48.280 
been painted instead of having binding
on<00:06:46.850> there<00:06:47.090> and<00:06:47.210> the<00:06:47.330> paint<00:06:47.570> sort<00:06:47.840> of<00:06:47.930> soaked

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:48.290 
on there and the paint sort of soaked

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:52.320 
on there and the paint sort of soaked
through<00:06:48.530> the<00:06:48.680> wood<00:06:49.660> I'm<00:06:50.660> only<00:06:50.810> going<00:06:51.200> in<00:06:51.320> maybe

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:52.330 
through the wood I'm only going in maybe

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:55.840 
through the wood I'm only going in maybe
three<00:06:53.330> hundredths<00:06:53.690> of<00:06:53.750> an<00:06:53.870> inch<00:06:54.490> just<00:06:55.490> enough

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:55.850 
three hundredths of an inch just enough

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:57.340 
three hundredths of an inch just enough
to<00:06:56.000> get<00:06:56.120> into<00:06:56.270> that<00:06:56.450> channel<00:06:56.930> and<00:06:57.050> get<00:06:57.230> that

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:57.350 
to get into that channel and get that

00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:01.560 
to get into that channel and get that
glue<00:06:57.590> joint<00:06:57.890> exposed

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:01.570 

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:04.060 

something<00:07:02.570> of<00:07:02.690> note<00:07:02.930> is<00:07:03.200> that<00:07:03.260> cousteau

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:04.070 
something of note is that cousteau

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:05.800 
something of note is that cousteau
guitar<00:07:04.400> tops<00:07:04.700> even<00:07:05.000> though<00:07:05.300> maybe<00:07:05.600> they're

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:05.810 
guitar tops even though maybe they're

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:07.810 
guitar tops even though maybe they're
called<00:07:06.050> flat<00:07:06.320> tops<00:07:06.590> they're<00:07:06.860> really<00:07:07.130> not<00:07:07.280> flat

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:07.820 
called flat tops they're really not flat

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:10.960 
called flat tops they're really not flat
they<00:07:08.750> have<00:07:08.840> a<00:07:08.900> slight<00:07:09.350> arc<00:07:09.680> in<00:07:09.860> them<00:07:10.010> and<00:07:10.790> you

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:10.970 
they have a slight arc in them and you

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:12.550 
they have a slight arc in them and you
need<00:07:11.120> to<00:07:11.240> make<00:07:11.360> sure<00:07:11.660> that<00:07:11.870> you're<00:07:12.050> you're

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:12.560 
need to make sure that you're you're

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:15.670 
need to make sure that you're you're
holding<00:07:13.010> down<00:07:13.190> pushing<00:07:14.060> down<00:07:14.240> a<00:07:14.270> bit<00:07:14.600> so<00:07:15.530> that

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:15.680 
holding down pushing down a bit so that

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:17.500 
holding down pushing down a bit so that
you<00:07:15.770> have<00:07:15.950> a<00:07:15.980> consistent<00:07:16.580> cut<00:07:16.820> going<00:07:17.060> all<00:07:17.390> the

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:17.510 
you have a consistent cut going all the

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:24.400 
you have a consistent cut going all the
way<00:07:17.540> through<00:07:22.240> just<00:07:23.240> continuing<00:07:23.780> to<00:07:23.870> work<00:07:24.110> my

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:24.410 
way through just continuing to work my

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:27.780 
way through just continuing to work my
way<00:07:24.620> around<00:07:25.090> want<00:07:26.090> a<00:07:26.150> nice<00:07:26.330> clean<00:07:26.570> channel<00:07:27.140> in

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:27.790 
way around want a nice clean channel in

00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:30.940 
way around want a nice clean channel in
the<00:07:28.790> end<00:07:28.940> when<00:07:29.330> it's<00:07:29.450> time<00:07:29.690> to<00:07:29.720> go<00:07:29.930> back<00:07:30.110> put

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:30.950 
the end when it's time to go back put

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:33.520 
the end when it's time to go back put
some<00:07:31.010> new<00:07:31.310> binding<00:07:31.730> in<00:07:31.820> there<00:07:32.030> I<00:07:32.240> think<00:07:33.140> it'll

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:33.530 
some new binding in there I think it'll

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:35.350 
some new binding in there I think it'll
be<00:07:33.680> a<00:07:33.710> lot<00:07:33.950> easier<00:07:33.980> as<00:07:34.580> long<00:07:34.820> as<00:07:35.000> it's<00:07:35.210> been

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:35.360 
be a lot easier as long as it's been

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:42.220 
be a lot easier as long as it's been
done<00:07:35.630> in<00:07:35.780> a<00:07:35.840> slow<00:07:36.230> and<00:07:36.440> uniform<00:07:36.860> way<00:07:41.140> now<00:07:42.140> I've

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:42.230 
done in a slow and uniform way now I've

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:45.640 
done in a slow and uniform way now I've
worked<00:07:42.410> my<00:07:42.650> way<00:07:42.860> around<00:07:44.230> you'll<00:07:45.230> see<00:07:45.320> I'm

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:45.650 
worked my way around you'll see I'm

00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:47.830 
worked my way around you'll see I'm
going<00:07:45.800> to<00:07:45.890> show<00:07:46.070> here<00:07:46.340> in<00:07:46.460> a<00:07:46.520> second<00:07:46.970> this<00:07:47.420> seam

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:47.840 
going to show here in a second this seam

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:57.879 
going to show here in a second this seam
hold<00:07:48.590> it<00:07:48.710> up<00:07:48.830> to<00:07:48.980> the<00:07:49.010> camera

00:07:57.879 --> 00:07:57.889 

00:07:57.889 --> 00:08:00.760 

and<00:07:57.979> as<00:07:58.639> we<00:07:58.849> zoom<00:07:59.150> in<00:07:59.419> you<00:07:59.449> can<00:07:59.719> get<00:07:59.960> an<00:08:00.289> idea<00:08:00.710> of

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:00.770 
and as we zoom in you can get an idea of

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:03.659 
and as we zoom in you can get an idea of
where<00:08:00.949> that<00:08:01.069> channel<00:08:01.520> has<00:08:01.550> been<00:08:01.819> routed<00:08:02.000> away

00:08:03.659 --> 00:08:03.669 
where that channel has been routed away

00:08:03.669 --> 00:08:07.119 
where that channel has been routed away
and<00:08:04.669> now<00:08:05.330> I'm<00:08:05.449> pointing<00:08:05.900> where<00:08:06.169> the<00:08:06.319> top<00:08:06.919> has

00:08:07.119 --> 00:08:07.129 
and now I'm pointing where the top has

00:08:07.129 --> 00:08:10.689 
and now I'm pointing where the top has
been<00:08:07.280> glued<00:08:07.580> on<00:08:07.909> to<00:08:08.240> the<00:08:08.270> sides
