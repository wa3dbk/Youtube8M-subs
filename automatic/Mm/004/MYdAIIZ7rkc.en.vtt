00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:06.180
 hello everyone my name is Pablo and in this 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.639
 new video I'm going to show you a 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.370
 new figure with the twist robot and today you 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.260
 I'm going to teach how to make rice 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.269
 saval good first of all many 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.490
 thanks to everyone who is already more than 30 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:21.449
 subscribers and good thank you very much for 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:24.600
 support and I love in a common that you 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.640
 like my videos and such and good nothing 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.440
 Well, after a long time, we are going 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.540
 to start making videos 

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.460
 well let's start with the rose what 

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:36.010
 first having the rubik 'tweets' done 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.380
 a line is worth and with the vertex looking 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.420
 up we're going to do the following 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:44.440
 we twist the vertex or the corner is worth 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:47.590
 up a perfect time 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:50.260
 now we lower these two the vertex 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:51.470
 rotated and the next the two towards 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:55.790
 down 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:58.040
 just only those two like that and we're going to do 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:01.670
 the same as we did in the ball and in the 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:03.590
 turtle this kind of little balls here 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.120
 it's going to look like a half pyramid 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:07.340
 white you will see 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.380
 we take but to understand this step you look 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:12.080
 in the tutorial of the ball that is 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:15.200
 perfect perfectly explained 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:18.220
 ok we turn all this long line down 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.820
 here it's worth cutting it 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.820
 OK 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:28.190
 towards here and now from here we are going to 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:31.940
 upload the whole line of is here 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:34.640
 perfect we will have this that goes to 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.560
 be what the center of the rose and now 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:40.390
 what we are going to do is have it like this 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.390
 ok let's turn around here 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:46.010
 let's rotate this so it was like that 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.010
 this line following this line now 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:50.390
 you have to follow this well and perfect 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:53.360
 Now the only thing we are going to do is 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.600
 circle this circle putting tab that 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.260
 it's very easy 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.260
 OK 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.070
 Now what we have to do is 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:10.080
 OK 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:12.210
 now we turn around here it's worth 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:17.450
 we turn 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:17.450
 and here we turn 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:23.719
 and now we are putting chips around 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:27.319
 as first we are going to turn around here 

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:29.870
 here is worth all the entire line to 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:31.500
 inside so that we are staying 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.990
 this 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.700
 now again 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:40.130
 we turn 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:42.880
 1 2 3 and 4 around here 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.880
 outward 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:49.810
 and this is already very intuitive now let's go 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:52.420
 we're going to have to turn around here 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.790
 I'm I think it's very intuitive and it's 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.230
 easy 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.090
 to understand where to turn 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:00.540
 page 2 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:04.680
 and finally, that's the way it is and we would have 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:06.629
 well done the rose we will clarify a 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.760
 last time the last steps 

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:11.900
 OK 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:15.400
 we have it so now 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:17.260
 we turn around in here 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:20.670
 so that we are containing a 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.670
 second row around this circle 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:26.870
 Now we turn is 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:30.220
 so that we put it like this one and 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.220
 finally here 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:36.980
 1 2 3 and 4 here we cut towards 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:38.860
 in to give the rose and good and 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.819
 we have made our rose with the ruit 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:42.349
 I hope I served you 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:44.390
 liked the video and nothing like that I'll go 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:47.830
 uploading videos and even products 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:47.830
 thank you all
