hi there this is Richard Gila woods here
and<00:00:03.419> I've<00:00:03.510> got<00:00:03.689> a<00:00:03.720> wonderful<00:00:04.170> 6<00:00:05.160> string<00:00:05.400> guitar

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
and I've got a wonderful 6 string guitar

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.550 
and I've got a wonderful 6 string guitar
that<00:00:05.940> Breedlove<00:00:06.420> was<00:00:06.690> kind<00:00:07.020> enough<00:00:07.290> to<00:00:07.350> make

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
that Breedlove was kind enough to make

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.589 
that Breedlove was kind enough to make
for<00:00:07.799> me<00:00:07.919> many<00:00:08.099> years<00:00:08.340> ago<00:00:08.519> it's<00:00:09.179> one<00:00:09.330> of<00:00:09.420> the

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
for me many years ago it's one of the

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:11.959 
for me many years ago it's one of the
signature<00:00:10.500> models<00:00:10.860> I<00:00:11.040> think<00:00:11.250> there's<00:00:11.429> only<00:00:11.490> 11

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
signature models I think there's only 11

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.110 
signature models I think there's only 11
of<00:00:12.030> these<00:00:12.210> out<00:00:12.450> there<00:00:13.099> and<00:00:14.099> I<00:00:14.490> have<00:00:14.670> this<00:00:14.820> in<00:00:15.000> an

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
of these out there and I have this in an

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.250 
of these out there and I have this in an
open<00:00:15.269> C<00:00:15.809> tuning<00:00:16.139> right<00:00:16.560> now<00:00:16.740> which<00:00:16.980> is<00:00:17.220> a<00:00:17.250> CG

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:18.260 
open C tuning right now which is a CG

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.580 
open C tuning right now which is a CG
CGC<00:00:19.460> so<00:00:20.460> my<00:00:20.609> low<00:00:20.820> bass<00:00:21.090> is<00:00:21.390> tuned<00:00:21.720> down<00:00:21.900> to

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
CGC so my low bass is tuned down to

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.099 
CGC so my low bass is tuned down to
whole<00:00:22.830> steps<00:00:23.250> fifth<00:00:24.150> string<00:00:24.480> is<00:00:24.630> down<00:00:24.840> one

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
whole steps fifth string is down one

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.519 
whole steps fifth string is down one
whole<00:00:25.350> step<00:00:25.560> from<00:00:26.189> A<00:00:26.369> to<00:00:26.400> G<00:00:26.840> 4th<00:00:27.840> strings<00:00:28.230> down

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
whole step from A to G 4th strings down

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.200 
whole step from A to G 4th strings down
from<00:00:28.769> a<00:00:28.859> D<00:00:28.980> to<00:00:29.039> C<00:00:29.400> and<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:29.640> second<00:00:30.000> string

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
from a D to C and the second string

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.260 
from a D to C and the second string
comes<00:00:30.480> up<00:00:30.720> a<00:00:30.929> half<00:00:31.710> step<00:00:31.920> from<00:00:32.160> B<00:00:32.550> to<00:00:32.579> C<00:00:32.730> so<00:00:33.239> that

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
comes up a half step from B to C so that

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.810 
comes up a half step from B to C so that
gives<00:00:33.660> me<00:00:33.899> a<00:00:33.930> C<00:00:34.200> try<00:00:34.559> out<00:00:34.770> or<00:00:34.920> a<00:00:34.980> C<00:00:35.219> chord<00:00:35.489> so

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
gives me a C try out or a C chord so

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.479 
gives me a C try out or a C chord so
it's<00:00:36.030> c<00:00:36.809> GC<00:00:37.110> GC<00:00:37.770> e

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.729 

and<00:00:41.840> surprisingly<00:00:42.840> what<00:00:43.140> I<00:00:43.170> want<00:00:43.410> to<00:00:43.530> show<00:00:43.680> you

and surprisingly what I want to show you
on<00:00:43.950> this<00:00:44.160> video<00:00:44.520> here<00:00:44.579> is<00:00:45.290> something<00:00:46.290> that<00:00:46.440> I

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
on this video here is something that I

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.139 
on this video here is something that I
don't<00:00:46.590> see<00:00:46.770> covered<00:00:47.219> very<00:00:47.430> often<00:00:47.820> which<00:00:47.969> is

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
don't see covered very often which is

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.360 
don't see covered very often which is
actually<00:00:48.600> how<00:00:49.199> to<00:00:49.230> use<00:00:49.500> your<00:00:49.680> other<00:00:49.829> fingers

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
actually how to use your other fingers

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.490 
actually how to use your other fingers
while<00:00:50.640> you're<00:00:50.879> holding<00:00:51.269> a<00:00:51.360> slide<00:00:51.690> where<00:00:52.440> the

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
while you're holding a slide where the

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.369 
while you're holding a slide where the
slides<00:00:52.860> not<00:00:53.129> even<00:00:53.430> being<00:00:53.610> used<00:00:53.730> so<00:00:54.660> many

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
slides not even being used so many

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.170 
slides not even being used so many
people<00:00:55.829> are<00:00:55.920> uncomfortable<00:00:56.610> where<00:00:56.790> it<00:00:56.940> flies

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
people are uncomfortable where it flies

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.390 
people are uncomfortable where it flies
all<00:00:57.510> over<00:00:57.839> the<00:00:57.960> place<00:00:58.199> so<00:00:58.530> this<00:00:58.860> little<00:00:59.250> video

00:00:59.390 --> 00:00:59.400 
all over the place so this little video

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.630 
all over the place so this little video

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
is intended to show you about

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.490 
is intended to show you about
stabilization<00:01:02.640> where<00:01:02.879> you<00:01:03.659> basically<00:01:04.199> want

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
stabilization where you basically want

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.260 
stabilization where you basically want
to<00:01:04.589> rest<00:01:04.800> your<00:01:04.920> ring<00:01:05.220> finger<00:01:05.670> against<00:01:06.180> the

to rest your ring finger against the
slide<00:01:06.690> to<00:01:06.930> stabilize<00:01:07.560> it<00:01:07.860> while<00:01:08.729> either<00:01:09.060> that

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
slide to stabilize it while either that

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.230 
slide to stabilize it while either that
finger<00:01:09.780> or<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.170> other<00:01:10.350> two<00:01:10.710> here<00:01:11.250> play<00:01:11.909> some

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
finger or the other two here play some

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.510 
finger or the other two here play some
notes<00:01:14.869> so<00:01:15.869> what<00:01:16.050> I'm<00:01:16.170> doing<00:01:16.200> is<00:01:16.590> on<00:01:16.830> strings<00:01:17.220> 1

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
notes so what I'm doing is on strings 1

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.749 
notes so what I'm doing is on strings 1
&amp;<00:01:17.670> 3<00:01:17.700> I<00:01:18.350> have<00:01:19.350> this<00:01:19.530> little<00:01:19.830> position<00:01:20.190> I<00:01:20.520> call<00:01:20.729> a

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
&amp; 3 I have this little position I call a

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.940 
&amp; 3 I have this little position I call a
position<00:01:21.270> 1

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
position 1

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.620 
position 1
and<00:01:23.219> with<00:01:23.369> my<00:01:23.549> picking<00:01:24.060> hand<00:01:24.299> I'm<00:01:24.479> just

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
and with my picking hand I'm just

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.300 
and with my picking hand I'm just
plucking<00:01:25.079> strings<00:01:25.439> four<00:01:25.740> three<00:01:26.070> two<00:01:26.280> one<00:01:28.310> and

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
plucking strings four three two one and

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.980 
plucking strings four three two one and
then<00:01:29.460> I'll<00:01:29.579> call<00:01:29.789> that<00:01:29.820> a<00:01:30.149> shape<00:01:30.539> I'll<00:01:30.780> call

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
then I'll call that a shape I'll call

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.020 
then I'll call that a shape I'll call
that<00:01:31.140> shape<00:01:31.439> one<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:32.369> I'll<00:01:32.490> play<00:01:32.700> that<00:01:32.880> at

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
that shape one and I'll play that at

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.020 
that shape one and I'll play that at
frets<00:01:33.329> one<00:01:33.719> then<00:01:34.229> starting<00:01:34.679> at<00:01:34.799> three<00:01:35.189> and

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
frets one then starting at three and

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.080 
frets one then starting at three and
eight<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:36.750> then<00:01:37.409> my<00:01:37.530> shape<00:01:37.829> too<00:01:38.159> would<00:01:38.520> be<00:01:38.729> my

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
eight and then my shape too would be my

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.590 
eight and then my shape too would be my
middle<00:01:39.420> fingers<00:01:39.869> on<00:01:40.140> five<00:01:40.759> fret<00:01:41.759> 5<00:01:42.000> here<00:01:42.390> and

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
middle fingers on five fret 5 here and

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.950 
middle fingers on five fret 5 here and
then<00:01:42.720> seven<00:01:43.289> then<00:01:43.439> ten<00:01:44.130> and<00:01:44.310> twelve<00:01:44.659> so<00:01:45.659> I<00:01:45.689> just

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
then seven then ten and twelve so I just

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.620 
then seven then ten and twelve so I just
think<00:01:46.289> of<00:01:46.619> this<00:01:46.950> shape<00:01:47.399> one<00:01:47.700> is<00:01:47.909> one<00:01:48.179> three

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
think of this shape one is one three

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.100 
think of this shape one is one three
eight<00:01:48.869> and<00:01:49.289> shape<00:01:50.250> two<00:01:50.579> is<00:01:50.909> five<00:01:51.329> seven<00:01:51.750> ten

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
eight and shape two is five seven ten

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.330 
eight and shape two is five seven ten
twelve<00:01:53.899> so<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:55.049> idea<00:01:55.409> is<00:01:55.649> just<00:01:55.679> to<00:01:56.130> practice

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
twelve so the idea is just to practice

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.149 
twelve so the idea is just to practice
either<00:01:56.849> picking<00:01:57.149> or<00:01:57.450> strumming<00:01:57.959> and<00:01:58.159> holding

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
either picking or strumming and holding

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.249 
either picking or strumming and holding
the<00:01:59.280> slide<00:01:59.610> without<00:01:59.880> using<00:02:00.599> it<00:02:00.780> and<00:02:00.959> just

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
the slide without using it and just

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:10.600 
the slide without using it and just
getting<00:02:01.560> used<00:02:01.590> to<00:02:01.860> it<00:02:01.950> being<00:02:02.310> on<00:02:02.459> your<00:02:02.610> hand

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.250 

you

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.080 

so<00:02:15.099> that's<00:02:15.310> all<00:02:15.459> you're<00:02:15.640> doing<00:02:15.670> you're<00:02:16.060> just

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
so that's all you're doing you're just

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.199 
so that's all you're doing you're just
getting<00:02:16.540> used<00:02:16.690> to<00:02:16.930> any<00:02:17.830> kind<00:02:18.640> of<00:02:18.730> strumming

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
getting used to any kind of strumming

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:25.360 
getting used to any kind of strumming
you<00:02:19.330> can<00:02:19.510> pick

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.410 

anything<00:02:26.370> you<00:02:26.459> want<00:02:26.610> to<00:02:26.640> do<00:02:26.790> a<00:02:26.819> lot<00:02:27.000> of<00:02:27.120> trial

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
anything you want to do a lot of trial

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.330 
anything you want to do a lot of trial
and<00:02:27.510> error<00:02:27.660> and<00:02:27.930> it<00:02:28.410> doesn't<00:02:28.680> have<00:02:28.800> to<00:02:28.920> be<00:02:29.040> fast

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
and error and it doesn't have to be fast

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.460 
and error and it doesn't have to be fast
but<00:02:29.790> the<00:02:29.940> idea<00:02:30.300> is<00:02:30.420> to<00:02:30.660> try<00:02:30.930> and<00:02:30.990> hold<00:02:31.290> that

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
but the idea is to try and hold that

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.920 
but the idea is to try and hold that
slide<00:02:31.709> in<00:02:32.069> place<00:02:32.340> and<00:02:32.670> getting<00:02:33.390> comfortable

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
slide in place and getting comfortable

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.600 
slide in place and getting comfortable
and<00:02:34.140> getting<00:02:34.470> it<00:02:34.590> used<00:02:34.770> to<00:02:34.920> being<00:02:35.130> a<00:02:35.250> part<00:02:35.520> of

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
and getting it used to being a part of

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.490 
and getting it used to being a part of
your<00:02:35.670> hand<00:02:38.750> you<00:02:39.750> don't<00:02:39.900> even<00:02:40.110> have<00:02:40.230> to<00:02:40.380> play

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
your hand you don't even have to play

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:41.960 
your hand you don't even have to play
with<00:02:40.709> your<00:02:40.739> left<00:02:41.040> hand<00:02:41.190> just<00:02:41.400> get<00:02:41.580> used<00:02:41.760> to<00:02:41.880> it

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
with your left hand just get used to it

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.370 
with your left hand just get used to it
being<00:02:42.300> there<00:02:44.600> then<00:02:45.600> if<00:02:45.750> you<00:02:45.840> want<00:02:46.020> to<00:02:46.140> start

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
being there then if you want to start

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:59.540 
being there then if you want to start
using<00:02:46.590> it<00:02:46.830> a<00:02:46.920> little<00:02:47.130> bit<00:02:47.310> of<00:02:58.010> so<00:02:59.010> sometimes

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
using it a little bit of so sometimes

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.460 
using it a little bit of so sometimes
you'll<00:02:59.790> notice<00:03:00.120> I<00:03:00.239> keep<00:03:00.450> my<00:03:00.630> index<00:03:01.050> finger

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
you'll notice I keep my index finger

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.220 
you'll notice I keep my index finger
flat<00:03:01.800> behind<00:03:02.250> it<00:03:02.400> resting<00:03:02.850> on<00:03:02.970> the<00:03:03.090> strings<00:03:03.420> to

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
flat behind it resting on the strings to

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.160 
flat behind it resting on the strings to
give<00:03:04.380> it<00:03:04.530> some<00:03:04.940> stability<00:03:05.989> extra<00:03:06.989> stability

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
give it some stability extra stability

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.940 
give it some stability extra stability
and<00:03:07.769> a<00:03:08.340> smoother<00:03:08.850> sound<00:03:09.260> and<00:03:10.260> sometimes<00:03:10.769> I'll

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
and a smoother sound and sometimes I'll

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.380 
and a smoother sound and sometimes I'll
lift<00:03:11.130> that<00:03:11.340> index<00:03:11.670> to<00:03:11.760> get<00:03:11.910> a<00:03:11.970> little<00:03:12.090> bit<00:03:12.300> of

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
lift that index to get a little bit of

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.080 
lift that index to get a little bit of
rattle<00:03:13.010> and<00:03:14.010> in<00:03:14.160> blues<00:03:14.489> that<00:03:14.790> can<00:03:14.940> be

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
rattle and in blues that can be

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.270 
rattle and in blues that can be
particularly<00:03:15.720> effective<00:03:16.560> at<00:03:16.680> the<00:03:16.769> second<00:03:17.160> and

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
particularly effective at the second and

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.630 
particularly effective at the second and
third<00:03:17.400> fret

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.130 

just<00:03:21.030> kind<00:03:21.240> of<00:03:21.300> open<00:03:21.630> it<00:03:21.720> up<00:03:21.810> and<00:03:22.020> then<00:03:22.110> a

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
just kind of open it up and then a

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.040 
just kind of open it up and then a
little<00:03:22.319> extra<00:03:22.500> vibrato<00:03:23.240> left<00:03:24.240> to<00:03:24.480> right<00:03:24.690> like

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.050 
little extra vibrato left to right like

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:27.470 
little extra vibrato left to right like
this<00:03:25.319> with<00:03:25.709> the<00:03:26.010> fret<00:03:26.400> itself<00:03:26.970> being<00:03:27.270> the

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
this with the fret itself being the

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.500 
this with the fret itself being the
center<00:03:27.900> point<00:03:28.819> and<00:03:29.819> then<00:03:30.090> you<00:03:30.209> can<00:03:30.360> do<00:03:30.480> a

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
center point and then you can do a

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:36.320 
center point and then you can do a
slower<00:03:30.900> or<00:03:31.230> a<00:03:31.260> faster<00:03:31.860> vibrato<00:03:32.280> so<00:03:35.330> practice

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
slower or a faster vibrato so practice

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.600 
slower or a faster vibrato so practice
your<00:03:36.480> vibrato<00:03:36.840> speeds<00:03:37.350> practice<00:03:38.040> your<00:03:38.220> finger

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
your vibrato speeds practice your finger

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:52.839 
your vibrato speeds practice your finger
movements

00:03:52.839 --> 00:03:52.849 

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:55.190 

so<00:03:53.849> see<00:03:54.269> what<00:03:54.420> you<00:03:54.510> can<00:03:54.659> do<00:03:54.750> about<00:03:54.840> just

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
so see what you can do about just

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.309 
so see what you can do about just
getting<00:03:55.530> the<00:03:55.650> idea<00:03:56.040> of<00:03:56.310> holding<00:03:56.579> your<00:03:56.849> hand<00:03:57.319> in

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 
getting the idea of holding your hand in

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:00.679 
getting the idea of holding your hand in
place<00:03:58.379> with<00:03:58.920> the<00:03:59.040> slide<00:03:59.370> and<00:03:59.760> noodling<00:04:00.569> around

00:04:00.679 --> 00:04:00.689 
place with the slide and noodling around

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:03.530 
place with the slide and noodling around
and<00:04:01.290> that's<00:04:01.950> the<00:04:02.370> purpose<00:04:02.849> of<00:04:02.969> this<00:04:03.120> video<00:04:03.480> is

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
and that's the purpose of this video is

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.080 
and that's the purpose of this video is
get<00:04:04.079> used<00:04:04.260> to<00:04:04.409> this<00:04:04.590> being<00:04:04.980> there<00:04:05.310> all<00:04:05.909> right

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
get used to this being there all right
