monster from the deck and then once that

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.550 
monster from the deck and then once that
happens<00:04:17.979> you<00:04:18.220> can<00:04:18.549> activate<00:04:19.090> this<00:04:19.150> card<00:04:19.690> to<00:04:19.900> D

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 
happens you can activate this card to D

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.089 
happens you can activate this card to D
single<00:04:20.950> them<00:04:21.099> and<00:04:21.370> bring<00:04:21.579> out<00:04:21.729> the<00:04:23.099> monsters

00:04:24.089 --> 00:04:24.099

that<00:04:24.310> made<00:04:24.550> them

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:24.910 
that made them

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.520 
that made them
and<00:04:25.120> then<00:04:25.660> sink<00:04:25.960> for<00:04:26.140> the<00:04:26.290> same<00:04:26.650> guy<00:04:27.520> again

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530 
and then sink for the same guy again

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.720 
and then sink for the same guy again
whichever<00:04:29.530> one<00:04:29.590> you<00:04:29.740> made<00:04:29.890> previously<00:04:30.370> and

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:33.820 
then a plus off of them once again so

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:35.970 
then a plus off of them once again so
it's<00:04:34.030> really<00:04:34.240> good<00:04:34.540> it<00:04:34.810> allows<00:04:35.530> you<00:04:35.650> to<00:04:35.740> plus
