on the inside of the cardboard box but
an<00:00:19.560> even<00:00:19.680> easier<00:00:19.890> way<00:00:20.130> of<00:00:20.220> doing<00:00:20.609> this<00:00:20.640> would

an even easier way of doing this would

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.420 
an even easier way of doing this would
be<00:00:21.570> to<00:00:21.720> take<00:00:21.840> a<00:00:21.900> photo<00:00:22.170> copy<00:00:22.439> of<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:22.949> page<00:00:23.160> I've

done a photocopy of my my drawing here

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.109 
done a photocopy of my my drawing here
but<00:00:26.039> you<00:00:26.130> could<00:00:26.250> take<00:00:26.400> a<00:00:26.430> photo<00:00:26.640> copied<00:00:26.970> from

it<00:00:30.060> down<00:00:30.390> onto<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:31.470> cardboard<00:00:32.040> just<00:00:32.969> simply

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
it down onto the cardboard just simply

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.670

simple paper adhesive or an aerosol glue
but<00:00:39.780> I've<00:00:39.899> redrawn<00:00:40.170> it<00:00:40.410> onto<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:40.770> card<00:00:41.040> so

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
but I've redrawn it onto the card so

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.200 
but I've redrawn it onto the card so
it's<00:00:42.120> a<00:00:42.480> simple<00:00:43.230> case<00:00:43.440> then<00:00:43.739> of<00:00:44.030> cutting<00:00:45.030> out

it's a simple case then of cutting out

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.970 
it's a simple case then of cutting out
the<00:00:46.020> shapes<00:00:46.550> from<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.670> cardboard<00:00:48.860> try<00:00:49.860> and

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
the shapes from the cardboard try and

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:56.330 
the shapes from the cardboard try and
cut<00:00:50.160> carefully<00:00:50.520> two<00:00:50.910> lines<00:00:54.980> and<00:00:55.980> you<00:00:56.010> want<00:00:56.219> to

cut carefully two lines and you want to

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:02.799 
cut carefully two lines and you want to
end<00:00:56.520> up<00:00:56.760> with<00:00:58.460> three<00:01:00.320> telling<00:01:01.320> your<00:01:01.500> shapes

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:02.809 
end up with three telling your shapes

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:07.399
