too<00:01:08.400> much<00:01:08.610> about<00:01:08.820> it<00:01:08.970> because<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.240> game's<00:01:09.420> not

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
too much about it because the game's not

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.990 
too much about it because the game's not
even<00:01:09.840> out<00:01:09.960> yet<00:01:09.990> but<00:01:10.340> I'm<00:01:11.340> just<00:01:11.790> going<00:01:11.909> to<00:01:11.970> throw

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000

guess this is from someone who has the

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.649 
guess this is from someone who has the
game<00:01:16.229> already<00:01:16.530> but<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.820> enemy<00:01:18.000> can't<00:01:18.450> even

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659
