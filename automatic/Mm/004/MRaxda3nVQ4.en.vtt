00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.120 
and he said probably not in zero point
12<00:01:16.670> but<00:01:17.299> we<00:01:17.390> will<00:01:17.540> start<00:01:17.869> with<00:01:18.020> 0<00:01:18.380> points<00:01:18.560> 13

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
12 but we will start with 0 points 13

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.160 
12 but we will start with 0 points 13
and<00:01:19.430> there<00:01:20.030> will<00:01:20.180> be<00:01:20.210> another<00:01:20.600> bunch<00:01:20.960> of

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
and there will be another bunch of

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.859 
and there will be another bunch of
mind-blowing<00:01:21.710> features<00:01:22.369> so<00:01:22.939> stay<00:01:23.240> tuned<00:01:23.539> so

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:23.869 
mind-blowing features so stay tuned so

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:25.840 
mind-blowing features so stay tuned so
again<00:01:24.200> they're<00:01:24.409> not<00:01:24.560> stopping<00:01:24.799> at<00:01:25.219> zero<00:01:25.549> point

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
again they're not stopping at zero point

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.969 
again they're not stopping at zero point
well<00:01:26.090> they're<00:01:26.420> going<00:01:26.600> to<00:01:26.719> continue<00:01:27.079> now<00:01:27.799> some

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
well they're going to continue now some

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:29.590 
well they're going to continue now some
of<00:01:28.070> the<00:01:28.130> features<00:01:28.280> I<00:01:28.490> would<00:01:28.759> expect<00:01:29.090> to<00:01:29.180> see<00:01:29.420> is

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
of the features I would expect to see is

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.810 
of the features I would expect to see is
possibly<00:01:30.079> redstone<00:01:30.590> and<00:01:30.859> I<00:01:31.189> would<00:01:31.399> expect<00:01:31.700> to

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
possibly redstone and I would expect to

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.490 
possibly redstone and I would expect to
see<00:01:32.000> things<00:01:32.210> like<00:01:32.359> trading<00:01:32.810> these<00:01:33.289> are<00:01:33.439> the

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
see things like trading these are the

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.230 
see things like trading these are the
things<00:01:33.649> that<00:01:33.770> we<00:01:33.979> don't<00:01:34.159> have<00:01:34.490> available<00:01:35.090> as

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
things that we don't have available as

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.660 
things that we don't have available as
of<00:01:35.479> yet<00:01:35.719> as<00:01:35.899> for<00:01:36.289> a<00:01:36.320> mind-blowing<00:01:36.950> feature<00:01:37.250> a

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
of yet as for a mind-blowing feature a

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.029 
of yet as for a mind-blowing feature a
mind-blowing<00:01:38.420> feature<00:01:38.659> to<00:01:38.869> me<00:01:39.079> would<00:01:39.469> be<00:01:39.500> the

00:01:40.029 --> 00:01:40.039 
mind-blowing feature to me would be the

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:42.520 
mind-blowing feature to me would be the
end<00:01:40.490> the<00:01:41.000> Enderdragon<00:01:41.780> or<00:01:41.929> the<00:01:42.049> wither<00:01:42.229> boss

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
end the Enderdragon or the wither boss

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.620 
end the Enderdragon or the wither boss
so<00:01:42.740> who<00:01:42.890> knows<00:01:43.039> these<00:01:43.549> might<00:01:43.880> be<00:01:44.030> introduced

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
so who knows these might be introduced

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.989 
so who knows these might be introduced
in<00:01:44.869> the<00:01:44.990> next<00:01:45.350> big<00:01:45.530> zero<00:01:45.920> point<00:01:46.189> 13<00:01:46.579> update

00:01:46.989 --> 00:01:46.999

in the next big zero point 13 update
which<00:01:47.509> means<00:01:47.749> that<00:01:47.929> this<00:01:48.170> year<00:01:48.469> we<00:01:48.679> might<00:01:48.920> see

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:49.189 
which means that this year we might see

a specific names maybe I wanted to call
this<00:06:46.370> dog<00:06:46.610> Sparky<00:06:47.150> just<00:06:47.780> for<00:06:47.960> a<00:06:47.990> random<00:06:48.380> name<00:06:48.530> I

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:48.800 
this dog Sparky just for a random name I

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:51.610 
this dog Sparky just for a random name I
wanted<00:06:49.190> to<00:06:49.280> calm<00:06:49.430> Sparky<00:06:49.940> and<00:06:50.870> it's<00:06:51.110> raining<00:06:51.470> I

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:51.620 
wanted to calm Sparky and it's raining I

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:53.710 
wanted to calm Sparky and it's raining I
could<00:06:52.310> then<00:06:52.430> simply<00:06:52.760> put<00:06:52.940> Sparky<00:06:53.390> down<00:06:53.539> on<00:06:53.660> the

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:53.720 
could then simply put Sparky down on the

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:54.730 
could then simply put Sparky down on the
floor<00:06:53.870> and<00:06:53.930> I'd<00:06:54.080> know<00:06:54.229> which<00:06:54.350> dog

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:54.740 
floor and I'd know which dog

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:56.740 
floor and I'd know which dog
which<00:06:54.949> obviously<00:06:55.340> you<00:06:55.639> can<00:06:55.849> tame<00:06:56.449> them<00:06:56.630> and

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:56.750 
which obviously you can tame them and

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:58.240 
which obviously you can tame them and
stuff<00:06:56.930> like<00:06:57.080> that<00:06:57.139> he<00:06:57.440> doesn't<00:06:57.650> like<00:06:57.740> rain<00:06:57.979> and

00:06:58.240 --> 00:06:58.250 
stuff like that he doesn't like rain and

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:00.610 
stuff like that he doesn't like rain and
it<00:06:58.370> seemed<00:06:58.580> to<00:06:58.669> rain<00:06:59.000> perfect<00:06:59.780> timing<00:06:59.960> the

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:00.620 
it seemed to rain perfect timing the

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:02.080 
it seemed to rain perfect timing the
best<00:07:00.830> time<00:07:01.039> to<00:07:01.190> get<00:07:01.280> rain<00:07:01.490> is<00:07:01.729> right<00:07:01.940> now

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:02.090 
best time to get rain is right now

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:04.029 
best time to get rain is right now
probably<00:07:02.360> because<00:07:02.780> we<00:07:03.020> can<00:07:03.169> find<00:07:03.410> a<00:07:03.740> creep

00:07:04.029 --> 00:07:04.039 
probably because we can find a creep

00:07:04.039 --> 00:07:05.020 
probably because we can find a creep
waiting<00:07:04.310> at<00:07:04.400> a<00:07:04.430> super<00:07:04.669> charged<00:07:04.849> creeper

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:05.030 
waiting at a super charged creeper

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:06.460 
waiting at a super charged creeper
before<00:07:05.479> it<00:07:05.599> was<00:07:05.720> well<00:07:05.960> worth<00:07:05.990> keeping<00:07:06.410> you

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:06.470 
before it was well worth keeping you

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:09.129 
before it was well worth keeping you
updated<00:07:06.590> with<00:07:07.400> you<00:07:07.759> a<00:07:07.789> few<00:07:08.150> things<00:07:08.180> today<00:07:08.720> I

00:07:09.129 --> 00:07:09.139 
updated with you a few things today I

00:07:09.139 --> 00:07:11.350

think<00:07:09.889> having<00:07:10.069> animals<00:07:10.520> when<00:07:10.819> name<00:07:10.940> tags<00:07:11.180> is<00:07:11.330> a

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:11.360 
think having animals when name tags is a

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:12.790 
think having animals when name tags is a
great<00:07:11.539> addition<00:07:11.780> again<00:07:12.319> it's<00:07:12.530> only<00:07:12.710> available

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:12.800 
great addition again it's only available

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:16.450 
great addition again it's only available
in<00:07:13.449> creative<00:07:14.449> and<00:07:15.380> also<00:07:15.860> I<00:07:15.889> say<00:07:16.099> it's<00:07:16.280> only

00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:16.460

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:21.249 
available if you use the embedded tear
which<00:07:19.400> does<00:07:19.580> require<00:07:19.819> you<00:07:20.090> to<00:07:20.270> back<00:07:20.569> out<00:07:20.780> go<00:07:21.199> to
