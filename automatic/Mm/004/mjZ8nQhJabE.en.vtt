 hi to all his friends his minots 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.000
 can be found in this new video 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.460
 tutorial on mac and today i'm going 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.519
 teach you how to install a mode on 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.620
 minecraft 1.7.2 and every 1.7 it 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.350
 will exist so here I am today I 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.650
 you install too many times on 1.7.2 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:24.000
 so how do we then go 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:27.930
 in his first kraft the point 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.910
 minecraft here so this way of 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.120
 years a fashion is the manual way 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.520
 so without minecraft forge without anything the 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.500
 interesting mode cmodh manually 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:41.910
 that's it then you go get the 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.350
 folder version that is here and you 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.760
 open it normally there will be all 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.530
 versions that you have on your 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.719
 model so what are we going to do 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.329
 if we are going to create a new file or to 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.039
 call it new folder here it is 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.969
 it's like that 

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:59.219
 mode these are the modes that's all 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:03.480
 just what are we going to do is 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:05.060
 we will go to the 1.7.2 folder 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:11.970
 will copy 

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:16.890
 here we are going to stick here and we will change 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:18.570
 all this so we will rename here then 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:23.130
 how do we go to rename that one 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:25.830
 will call it mode and here also mode all 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:30.659
 simply we will open the project area 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:33.600
 by opening with tex is said and we 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:37.680
 will erase all that even the quotation marks 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:40.680
 and we will replace by mode that's it 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:44.939
 leaves her automatically saves and 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:48.770
 now we will just click 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:54.570
 on the way points var we will open with 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:56.549
 darchy utility here nathan a little bit and 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.590
 it will open a new folder 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.860
 so that's the compiled point compiled 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.329
 decompressing here is it in then 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.689
 the first thing to have as 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:09.270
 reflex is to look for the meta a knock 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:13.230
 so meta 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:15.660
 1 and the deleted since if we do not 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.080
 does not remove the metal the mode does not 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.820
 will not work it's finished 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:23.370
 here is I deleted land is 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.800
 correct and now just this 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.930
 what I'm going to do is I'm going 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:30.830
 double click on it and I'm going 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:36.030
 select all mode files 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:41.040
 I'm going to drag the same being 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:42.870
 replaced and that's the mode is put on 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.930
 your mike wright now it remains 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.600
 more than any sectioned so you 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:51.590
 do as for all selected 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:57.710
 here you right click 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:03:00.450
 you put compressed here that's it 

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:02.640
 normally all the way down or if you 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.320
 do not find where you put that in the 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.680
 search bar here archive points 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.790
 VIP 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:11.910
 here you find it or drag it here 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:15.330
 for an office for now you the 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:19.140
 put in the file mode you 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:24.020
 now delete this shot there and this 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:31.920
 from here where the fame you call it 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:35.100

 new version of minecraft that 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:44.459
 is called fashion and that will allow us 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:46.820
 to have the modes on our game then we 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:51.440
 will test that right now 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:54.570
 so I ask on minecraft 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.160

 that I'm going to go on a profile I can 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:09.890
