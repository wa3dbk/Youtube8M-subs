 ah 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.080
 all right 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.899
 hello friends of people beta venezuela and of 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:51.899
 beta zulia people today I come to show you 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:54.320
 how to make infuser me for my me with the 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.210
 lettuce leaf 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.829
 The first thing to do is place 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:02.589
 the leaf in the sun 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:03.990
 that is dry this has happened all day 

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:05.580
 here 

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:08.580
 Y 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:11.480
 and boil water 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.480
 and let it rest 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.840
 we come 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:22.750
 and it's in a bottle of 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:25.900
 of already settled water that is already 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.900
 previously boiled 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:32.020
 and the only thing that moves we introduce 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:35.560
 the lettuce 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:41.430
 Normally and we will add it 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:41.430
 one drop of milk per liter of water 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.470
 the other part of the video I will be 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:50.980
 talking about 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:53.050
 the milk drops and put her here 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:55.510
 respective mesh 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:58.770
 good friends as I was saying already 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:58.770
 each container 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:05.820
 they were already introduced to the drop of 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:09.330
 milk as he is saying is a drop of 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:14.010
 milk for every liter of water we put 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:16.890
 a mesh so you do not get insects 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:20.849
 and we put it in a part where it does not 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:25.560
 give the sunlight directly and this 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:28.420
 in 5 days you already have it for 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:31.690
 medium and that's where we're going to 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:34.140
 to give him the infusor llosa our 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.140
 fry 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:40.970
 this you have to put two or three droplets 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:43.630
 of milk every day so that the 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:46.630
 decomposition process 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:49.930
 and the fermentation becomes faster 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:53.800
 that's optional if they do not get milk 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:57.300
 matter well, we can have the same 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:03:00.940
 paramecia of all types of diffuser me 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:04.510
 I hope you liked it and that you 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:08.430
 serve something for future start 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.430
 the beta until then
