00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:15.480
 little hyper fast video for that 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.160
 it is a masking oil anti cellulite 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.450
 that's it, so I know it's not the 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.869
 season but I have some towards viva 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:23.610
 Algeria also want 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:26.580
 I hesitated between the show she's a 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:29.669
 little yes the thing a gel effect the oil 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.360
 because I want to be like that 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:35.550
 this is the period 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:38.370
 so I mourned the caffeine 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.989
 since we can allow in the oil 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.290
 I did not put anything in oil 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:46.170
 vegetable good end 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.850
 will nassera plants that I have done regular 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.940
 iron man or still good for the time 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.859
 decongestant Wii etc. and oils 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.289
 essential reality for an action 

00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:57.890
 anti semitic here and it is super fast 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:03.510
 to do these two minutes chrono 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:05.610
 malerba good and joni mia not tip-top 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.200
 tip-top so I got a container 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.119
 with a sprint 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.189
 I recovered that it was a floral water 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:14.439
 Normally oils are therefore a 

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:16.090
 navy and the workers it's too much 

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:19.899
 double cedh which I want to 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:22.929
 recover recover to savoie there 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:25.030
 it was my macerate to manage my 

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:25.479
 macerate of ivy or sailors of my 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.340
 garden 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:28.270
 is not it in soybean oil I 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.240
 still going to make a little effort 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:33.579
 to tell me and pretty much is 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.270
 obsessional na I 'm about 50 

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:37.539
 milliliters 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.659
 it may not have done all my 

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:44.170
 bottle because she is tall 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:46.770
 it was good that vaudreuil of melvita 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:50.610
 50 milliliters 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:57.640
 I put it to you and it starts to turn 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:02:01.060
 so that makes sense but already his thousand 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:14.069
 of products that's normal and the rest 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:15.780
 Well, we have about ten 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:19.690
 women 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:23.109
 sorry 30 minutes we made you 130 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:25.269
 milliliters of macerate then compared 

00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:27.310
 to my macerate I want to say anyway 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:29.560
 one thing is why we see a 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:32.120
 little trick rushed to the bottom by a 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.010
 tool I was going to 2 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.840
 vitamin e when I make them so that 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:39.200
 they keep a little bit I celebrated 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:43.700
 this summer so in sanaa by cons for 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.720
 to have an oil natie nantes and easy 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.989
 to apply on the skin 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:50.269
 I will add my natural restitu 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:53.659
 silicone it was cosmeto diagrams 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:56.390
 personal and there we will have a product that 

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:58.730
 will be less fat necessarily so 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:01.370
 there too I will put what I have 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.860
 do not even want to leave me like that 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.390
 it's over it avoids the asparagus 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:10.040
 kind of inch to this recovers because 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:12.700
 precisely these flights so I'm 30 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.700
 milliliters 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:20.870
 so we were on his age and then am 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:23.599
 going down 138 to the air and 30 that makes to 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.700
 about 160 thousand fast and that's 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:26.810
 serious 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.129
 and now I put my oils 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:30.769
 essential I even have the bands is 

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:32.840
 I wanted to leave I do not know anything about 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:34.280
 coffee no yes I'm doing an emulsion thing 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.560
 but as I wanted to use all my 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.359
 oil and that I did but an emulsion 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.250
 I would not have all used the hundred 

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:42.380
 thirty minutes that remain weak 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.120
 I do a caffeine night it will be for 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:45.739
 next time but I was attacking 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:49.609
 killed his book of essential oil 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:52.970
 so I'll put ten games almost 

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:56.000
 want to put 15 15 of each is 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:57.799
 not too to ten 10 because it 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:03.949
 going to have the bank the moose I 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:06.530
 so much turn my son but I do not feel 

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:08.569
 no stronger photosensitizers by 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:10.699
 against it's not for the morning and you have 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:12.799
 shatters the temperature during its 85 

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:13.459
 years puts on a bikini as I put 20 

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:14.830
 may 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:18.580
 so that's 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:20.980
 almost always being so close it's 

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:23.890
 anti-cellulite essential oils x 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:25.060
 decongestant circulatory information 

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:27.640
 tonic and so on 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.440
 and there I lose my ten years let's be 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:32.140
 serious 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:34.060
 after that is the jir a new rose so has the 

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:35.710
 good for everything for the geranium 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:37.530
 at xaia not that mask it seems that 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:45.490
 for branches grow to legear 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:47.410
 also say badly after we have the wood of 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:49.900
 rose like rosewood hill and 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:51.960
 circulatory henri at q what I read 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:57.090
 photos nor photonics especially 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:05:02.290
 bodros dissociates after bruce this is the 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:17.940
 juniper so there too also say if 

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:17.940
 I come to the force and open it 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:33.860
 so to open it at near the 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:37.100
 path ranking 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:42.200
 what idea also say I have there I 

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:44.020
 have a little what is cedar 

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:49.880
 of the atlas very good for traffic 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:51.650
 it's classy when I say no 

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:54.010
 because when I have at least six kinds 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:57.520
 of view the essential difference that pays 

00:05:54.010 --> 00:06:00.770
 my share while maintaining rosemary 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:01.580
 so that's good too yes the ivy 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:04.280
 omar 

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:06.170
 why did I bring maceration 

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:09.020
 maral yesterday I did it on purpose for 

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:13.490
 legs because that's exactly how 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:15.560
 to say ivy and anti celtic and the 

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:17.870
 decongestant rosemary is also 

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:21.710
 circulatory we know both 

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:25.300
 together and after what is it 

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:28.670
 lemon in there will be deleted 

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:29.930
 the last one is just five en route 

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:32.450
 because she is very strong 

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:34.460
 it's cinnamon there the channel do 

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:38.390
 be careful if you really support it 

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:39.320
 not you do not put them right so but 

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:42.370
 this time it's over 

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:45.710
 there's more to put the thing and especially 

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:46.640
 I will say well shake it 

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:49.130
 not mix what I'm going to be 

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:50.660
 mixed with pc games did not notice then 

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:53.990
 we do not see but that it is normal 

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:55.790
 their priori I have about it with 

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:58.310
 the light do not see I have little by little 

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:59.900
 until then so my pool is too 

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:02.570
 big but as I wanted to use a 

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:05.000
 glass thing I will shake all 

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:07.040
 cleverly is everywhere and on everything 

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.940
 we can do is leave a small 

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:11.560
 little rested 

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:11.560
 serrieres here I say goodbye
