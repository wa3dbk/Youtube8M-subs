00:00:13.749 --> 00:00:16.779
 the credit crisis all nice and kind 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:21.330
 but as far as I'm concerned, that is not right and the auction crisis is leading 

00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:25.309
 emmen therefore not necessary because I predict a great future for this kind 

00:00:25.309 --> 00:00:29.849
 terror packaging that is the well-known bid packaging the dike 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:32.329
 it contains three liters 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:34.319
 that is significantly cheaper than 

00:00:34.319 --> 00:00:38.409
 Buy four of the same bottles and that is another benefit to you 

00:00:38.409 --> 00:00:42.010
 actually a bit excited about the bag so that you started with 

00:00:42.009 --> 00:00:47.859
 apple that can also hold 6 brooks content it is a drawback only to this 

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:50.579
 kind of packs look if your credit crisis became the trip that friends 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.499
 invite to party, of course, we can't put on a suit like that 

00:00:55.499 --> 00:00:59.800
 of course it looks technically so it is now 

00:00:59.799 --> 00:01:04.119
 Subsequent pot sizes espresso machines do byrd and that is 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:07.119
 there is also such a thing as the online dender 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.250
 there he is 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:17.120
 then of course something very different happens that is being and design styling 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.260
 then we will remove this 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.820
 so get this one 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.319
 watertight bulkheads the rider being publicly ugly 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.580
 cardboard box 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.410
 here we will remove 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:32.680
 7 this is 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.680
 grab the silver moon with wine 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.540
 disappears 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:42.800
 the ioc chinne 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.800
 it is now gentlemen 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.500
 the lid on it 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.960
 The nice thing about this system is that you are 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.100
 never have the hassle with 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.780
 the line does not call on temperature on the series so one 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.970
 rollertje it is pilotage and so would the number of banks they assumed 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.740
 set at 16 degrees that is what I am worth in this case room temperature 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.740
 inside I just put in a very pleasant afternoon 

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:13.999
 and she went key and we think we do not crisis at the time 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:21.019
 so come the crisis 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:23.219
 nut village 

00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:26.799
 and then of course the crisis is really over and we have the 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:32.329
 in a tender with all those that are no longer needed, alex goes behind of course 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:33.059
 from 

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:35.089
 Champagne 

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:39.989
 tiel carson nice this case then we put it on the show in utrecht of the world 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:41.609
 pub 6 

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:45.189
 and the hammer waiting quietly until we can celebrate 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:49.459
 that fact, therefore, actually our pension 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:50.299
 secured
