stick left or it'll be broke so came up

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:55.649 
stick left or it'll be broke so came up
with<00:01:53.229> this<00:01:53.380> idea<00:01:53.619> and<00:01:54.220> it's<00:01:54.670> based<00:01:55.000> on<00:01:55.270> an

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:55.659 
with this idea and it's based on an

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:00.240 
with this idea and it's based on an
American<00:01:56.170> rock<00:01:56.380> classic<00:01:56.950> and<00:01:58.200> Tanguy<00:01:59.229> now<00:02:00.220> I

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250
