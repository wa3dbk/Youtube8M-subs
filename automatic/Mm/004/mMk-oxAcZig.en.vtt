00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
is hourly offense is going to be similar

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.860 
is hourly offense is going to be similar
to<00:00:31.500> what<00:00:31.710> San<00:00:31.949> Antonio<00:00:32.430> did<00:00:32.700> back<00:00:33.540> when<00:00:33.570> they

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
to what San Antonio did back when they

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.770 
to what San Antonio did back when they
had<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.200> two<00:00:34.680> bigs<00:00:35.130> and<00:00:35.399> David<00:00:36.149> and<00:00:36.300> Tim<00:00:36.510> and

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
had the two bigs and David and Tim and

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.220 
had the two bigs and David and Tim and
and<00:00:36.989> but<00:00:37.890> you<00:00:38.340> know<00:00:38.460> again<00:00:38.750> there'll<00:00:39.750> be<00:00:39.809> some

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
and but you know again there'll be some

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.319 
and but you know again there'll be some
bits<00:00:40.500> and<00:00:40.680> pieces<00:00:41.040> of<00:00:41.070> triangle<00:00:41.790> involved<00:00:42.210> in

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
bits and pieces of triangle involved in

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.000 
bits and pieces of triangle involved in
it<00:00:42.450> but<00:00:42.510> i<00:00:42.600> think<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:42.899> triangle<00:00:43.440> it's<00:00:43.530> emotion

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
it but i think the triangle it's emotion

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.100 
it but i think the triangle it's emotion
office<00:00:44.370> for<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.610> most<00:00:44.820> part<00:00:45.059> and<00:00:45.629> a<00:00:45.899> lot<00:00:46.079> of

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
office for the most part and a lot of

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.770 
office for the most part and a lot of
people<00:00:46.469> have<00:00:46.969> bits<00:00:47.969> and<00:00:48.149> pieces<00:00:48.480> of<00:00:48.629> that

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
people have bits and pieces of that

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.439 
people have bits and pieces of that
within<00:00:49.440> their<00:00:49.680> offense<00:00:50.129> and<00:00:50.309> so<00:00:50.579> won't<00:00:51.180> be<00:00:51.239> any

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
within their offense and so won't be any

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.330 
within their offense and so won't be any
different<00:00:51.660> for<00:00:51.899> us<00:00:52.020> and<00:00:52.079> we'll<00:00:52.860> make<00:00:53.129> sure

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
different for us and we'll make sure

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.020 
different for us and we'll make sure
that<00:00:54.050> Kobe's<00:00:55.050> in<00:00:55.260> his<00:00:55.410> comfort<00:00:55.770> zone<00:00:55.829> or<00:00:56.280> sweet

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
that Kobe's in his comfort zone or sweet

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
spots out on the floor so they sort of

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.610 
spots out on the floor so they sort of
triangle<00:00:59.550> elements<00:00:59.940> you're<00:01:00.059> thinking<00:01:00.750> say

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
triangle elements you're thinking say

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.410 
triangle elements you're thinking say
those<00:01:02.100> triangle<00:01:02.520> elements<00:01:02.940> carrying<00:01:03.270> over

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
those triangle elements carrying over

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.870 
those triangle elements carrying over
that<00:01:03.870> in<00:01:04.470> particular<00:01:04.650> involves<00:01:05.339> Kobe<00:01:05.670> like

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
that in particular involves Kobe like

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.130 
that in particular involves Kobe like
how<00:01:05.970> you're<00:01:06.119> thinking<00:01:06.150> about<00:01:06.420> trying<00:01:06.810> to<00:01:06.930> use

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
how you're thinking about trying to use

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.820 
how you're thinking about trying to use
him<00:01:07.380> and<00:01:07.590> where<00:01:08.189> he<00:01:08.220> fits<00:01:08.520> into<00:01:08.729> all<00:01:08.880> this<00:01:09.830> all

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
him and where he fits into all this all

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.899 
him and where he fits into all this all
about<00:01:10.950> that<00:01:11.390> looks<00:01:12.390> at<00:01:12.540> it<00:01:13.400> there's<00:01:14.400> none<00:01:14.729> of

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
about that looks at it there's none of

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.999 
about that looks at it there's none of
that<00:01:14.939> those<00:01:15.600> triangle<00:01:16.200> elements<00:01:16.740> that<00:01:16.860> you

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
that those triangle elements that you

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.620 
that those triangle elements that you
were<00:01:17.100> talking<00:01:17.460> about<00:01:17.580> you<00:01:17.820> know<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:17.939> bits<00:01:18.450> and

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
were talking about you know the bits and

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.530 
were talking about you know the bits and
pieces<00:01:18.990> oh<00:01:19.140> good<00:01:19.770> hands<00:01:20.340> is<00:01:20.820> great<00:01:21.150> this<00:01:21.360> is

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
pieces oh good hands is great this is

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.870 
pieces oh good hands is great this is
gonna<00:01:21.840> come<00:01:22.140> around<00:01:22.439> rosters<00:01:22.920> good<00:01:23.220> how<00:01:23.729> much

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
gonna come around rosters good how much

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.940 
gonna come around rosters good how much
you<00:01:24.000> cost<00:01:24.150> a<00:01:24.869> lot<00:01:25.170> less<00:01:25.229> than<00:01:25.590> anyone<00:01:25.740> else

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
you cost a lot less than anyone else

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:35.890 
you cost a lot less than anyone else
you're<00:01:26.070> gonna<00:01:26.479> I'll<00:01:27.479> go<00:01:27.600> talk<00:01:27.810> to<00:01:27.869> Mitch

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:35.900 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.969 

triangle<00:01:36.900> elements<00:01:37.320> that<00:01:37.439> you<00:01:37.560> were<00:01:37.650> talking

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
triangle elements that you were talking

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.700 
triangle elements that you were talking
about<00:01:38.299> now<00:01:39.299> is<00:01:39.750> that<00:01:39.780> specifically<00:01:40.530> how<00:01:40.650> you

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
about now is that specifically how you

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.410 
about now is that specifically how you
think<00:01:41.009> Kobe<00:01:41.220> could<00:01:41.579> fit<00:01:41.759> into<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.030> mix<00:01:42.240> like

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
think Kobe could fit into the mix like

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.880 
think Kobe could fit into the mix like
retaining<00:01:42.840> those<00:01:42.930> elements<00:01:43.229> on<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.560> triangle

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
retaining those elements on the triangle

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.740 
retaining those elements on the triangle
yeah<00:01:44.460> I<00:01:44.490> mean<00:01:44.759> he<00:01:44.850> can<00:01:45.030> fit<00:01:45.210> in<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.390> mix<00:01:45.570> that

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
yeah I mean he can fit in the mix that

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.039 
yeah I mean he can fit in the mix that
way<00:01:45.930> there's<00:01:46.170> some<00:01:46.320> other<00:01:46.470> ideas<00:01:46.920> that<00:01:47.040> I<00:01:47.100> have

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:48.049 
way there's some other ideas that I have

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:50.870 
way there's some other ideas that I have
as<00:01:49.049> to<00:01:49.170> how<00:01:49.649> I'll<00:01:49.860> give<00:01:50.130> them<00:01:50.220> to<00:01:50.310> fit<00:01:50.549> in<00:01:50.700> but

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
as to how I'll give them to fit in but

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.240 
as to how I'll give them to fit in but
you<00:01:51.689> know<00:01:51.780> bits<00:01:52.020> and<00:01:52.229> pieces<00:01:52.530> of<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.710> triangle

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
you know bits and pieces of the triangle

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.800 
you know bits and pieces of the triangle
not<00:01:53.460> only<00:01:53.700> for<00:01:53.880> him<00:01:54.060> but<00:01:54.090> for<00:01:54.329> some<00:01:54.659> of<00:01:54.750> the

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
not only for him but for some of the

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.840 
not only for him but for some of the
other<00:01:54.930> guys<00:01:55.020> too<00:01:55.560> there's<00:01:56.430> a<00:01:56.520> little<00:01:56.670> bit<00:01:56.790> of

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
other guys too there's a little bit of

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.819 
other guys too there's a little bit of
comfort<00:01:57.090> zone<00:01:57.420> there<00:01:57.689> but<00:01:57.930> you<00:01:58.500> know<00:01:58.590> I<00:01:58.649> have

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
comfort zone there but you know I have

00:01:58.829 --> 00:01:59.740 
comfort zone there but you know I have
some<00:01:58.979> other<00:01:59.100> ideas

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
some other ideas

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:07.040 
think the mix is with him in terms of

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.150 
think the mix is with him in terms of
working<00:02:07.220> tomorrow<00:02:08.200> he<00:02:09.200> wasn't<00:02:09.410> coping<00:02:09.560> mixes

I meant I think he'll be on the ball
summit<00:02:22.100> I<00:02:22.310> think<00:02:22.970> he<00:02:23.150> you<00:02:23.360> know<00:02:23.450> he<00:02:23.720> doesn't

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
summit I think he you know he doesn't

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.570 
summit I think he you know he doesn't
necessarily<00:02:24.350> have<00:02:24.500> to<00:02:24.530> be<00:02:24.680> a<00:02:24.770> Chris<00:02:25.040> Paul<00:02:25.310> in<00:02:25.490> a

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
necessarily have to be a Chris Paul in a

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.150 
necessarily have to be a Chris Paul in a
pick<00:02:25.730> and<00:02:25.850> roll<00:02:25.910> situation<00:02:26.780> but<00:02:26.990> because<00:02:27.950> he

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
pick and roll situation but because he

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.400 
pick and roll situation but because he
is<00:02:28.220> who<00:02:28.490> he<00:02:28.520> is<00:02:28.880> he's<00:02:29.720> going<00:02:29.900> to<00:02:29.959> command<00:02:30.110> a<00:02:30.380> lot

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
is who he is he's going to command a lot

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.670 
is who he is he's going to command a lot
of<00:02:30.709> attention<00:02:31.190> and<00:02:31.540> draw<00:02:32.540> a<00:02:32.570> double-team<00:02:32.900> you

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
of attention and draw a double-team you

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
of attention and draw a double-team you
know<00:02:33.800> whenever<00:02:34.040> he<00:02:34.280> comes<00:02:34.459> off

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
know whenever he comes off

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.060 
know whenever he comes off
pick-and-rolls<00:02:35.030> so<00:02:35.600> sometimes<00:02:36.080> he'll<00:02:36.920> be

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
pick-and-rolls so sometimes he'll be

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.100 
pick-and-rolls so sometimes he'll be
involved<00:02:37.489> in<00:02:37.610> pinker<00:02:37.880> roles<00:02:38.090> not<00:02:38.660> only<00:02:38.810> look

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
involved in pinker roles not only look

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.320 
involved in pinker roles not only look
for<00:02:39.140> an<00:02:40.100> opportunity<00:02:40.250> to<00:02:40.640> screw<00:02:40.820> himself<00:02:41.000> but

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
for an opportunity to screw himself but

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.240 
for an opportunity to screw himself but
to<00:02:41.480> be<00:02:41.600> a<00:02:41.630> facilitator<00:02:41.810> because<00:02:42.650> he's<00:02:43.070> going

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
to be a facilitator because he's going

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.220 
to be a facilitator because he's going
to<00:02:43.310> draw<00:02:43.580> or<00:02:43.820> tractor<00:02:44.420> a<00:02:44.450> lot<00:02:44.600> of<00:02:44.750> attention<00:02:45.110> in

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
to draw or tractor a lot of attention in

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.590 
to draw or tractor a lot of attention in
situations<00:02:45.830> like<00:02:45.890> that<00:02:46.040> and<00:02:46.520> then<00:02:46.670> you<00:02:47.510> know

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
situations like that and then you know

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.270 
situations like that and then you know
anytime<00:02:47.959> you<00:02:48.020> can<00:02:48.350> have<00:02:48.530> somebody<00:02:48.830> that<00:02:48.980> comes

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
anytime you can have somebody that comes

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.949 
anytime you can have somebody that comes
off<00:02:49.459> of<00:02:49.520> screens<00:02:49.820> removes<00:02:50.330> well<00:02:50.540> doubt<00:02:50.810> the

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
off of screens removes well doubt the

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:53.680 
off of screens removes well doubt the
ball<00:02:51.880> you<00:02:52.880> know<00:02:52.970> they're<00:02:53.360> harder<00:02:53.660> to

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
ball you know they're harder to

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.210 
ball you know they're harder to
double-team<00:02:54.230> so<00:02:54.530> we'll<00:02:54.709> mix<00:02:54.890> some<00:02:55.070> of<00:02:55.160> those

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
double-team so we'll mix some of those

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.930 
double-team so we'll mix some of those
elements<00:02:55.459> in<00:02:55.820> there<00:02:55.940> to<00:02:56.120> enter<00:02:56.870> it<00:02:57.050> in

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
elements in there to enter it in

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.460 
elements in there to enter it in

sooner<00:05:28.070> than<00:05:28.190> later<00:05:28.370> for<00:05:29.060> everything<00:05:29.450> and<00:05:29.690> it

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:30.350 
sooner than later for everything and it

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:32.469 
sooner than later for everything and it
will<00:05:30.470> continue<00:05:30.560> like<00:05:31.100> that<00:05:31.130> with<00:05:32.120> the<00:05:32.210> often

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:35.550 
but they're often spin different than

think our role Derek misty of change
well<00:05:40.980> you<00:05:41.580> know<00:05:41.730> the<00:05:42.330> one<00:05:42.510> thing<00:05:42.750> is<00:05:42.990> it<00:05:43.400> it'd

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:44.400 
well you know the one thing is it it'd

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.630 
well you know the one thing is it it'd
be<00:05:44.640> a<00:05:44.670> an<00:05:45.000> equal-opportunity<00:05:46.370> offense<00:05:47.370> where

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:47.640 
be a an equal-opportunity offense where

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:49.790 
be a an equal-opportunity offense where
the<00:05:48.390> one<00:05:48.600> the<00:05:48.810> two<00:05:48.960> or<00:05:49.110> the<00:05:49.140> three<00:05:49.230> can<00:05:49.650> bring

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:49.800 
the one the two or the three can bring

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.760 
the one the two or the three can bring
the<00:05:49.920> ball<00:05:50.100> up<00:05:50.130> because<00:05:50.550> all<00:05:50.730> the<00:05:50.880> smalls<00:05:51.210> are

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:51.770 
the ball up because all the smalls are

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:54.560 
the ball up because all the smalls are
interchangeable<00:05:52.770> so<00:05:53.730> so<00:05:54.210> there's<00:05:54.330> not<00:05:54.450> going

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:54.570 
interchangeable so so there's not going

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:55.790 
interchangeable so so there's not going
to<00:05:54.630> be<00:05:54.690> too<00:05:54.870> much<00:05:54.900> different<00:05:55.380> because<00:05:55.440> in<00:05:55.740> the

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:55.800 
to be too much different because in the

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.450 
to be too much different because in the
past<00:05:56.120> you<00:05:57.120> know<00:05:57.870> here<00:05:58.320> they<00:05:58.830> had<00:05:59.010> multiple

00:05:59.450 --> 00:05:59.460 
past you know here they had multiple

past you know here they had multiple
guys<00:05:59.580> even<00:06:00.030> including<00:06:00.540> Lamar<00:06:00.870> bring<00:06:01.110> the<00:06:01.200> ball

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:01.380 
guys even including Lamar bring the ball

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:04.010 
guys even including Lamar bring the ball
up<00:06:01.410> but<00:06:02.370> the<00:06:02.460> one<00:06:02.610> thing<00:06:02.850> that<00:06:02.910> we<00:06:03.630> like<00:06:03.870> to

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:04.020

emphasize we like to emphasize attacking

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:07.700 
emphasize we like to emphasize attacking
the<00:06:06.000> clock<00:06:06.240> and<00:06:06.480> we<00:06:07.080> want<00:06:07.290> to<00:06:07.350> get<00:06:07.440> the<00:06:07.560> ball

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:07.710 
the clock and we want to get the ball

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:08.980 
the clock and we want to get the ball
from<00:06:07.860> the<00:06:08.010> back<00:06:08.160> court<00:06:08.460> to<00:06:08.550> the<00:06:08.640> front<00:06:08.880> court

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:08.990 
from the back court to the front court

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:11.960 
from the back court to the front court
within<00:06:09.990> the<00:06:10.170> first<00:06:10.380> four<00:06:10.710> four<00:06:11.130> seconds<00:06:11.670> or<00:06:11.790> so

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:11.970 
within the first four four seconds or so

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:13.810 
within the first four four seconds or so
so<00:06:12.210> that<00:06:12.360> we<00:06:12.480> can<00:06:12.600> get<00:06:12.720> to<00:06:12.960> second<00:06:13.470> and<00:06:13.560> third

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:13.820 
so that we can get to second and third

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:16.010 
so that we can get to second and third
sometimes<00:06:14.820> a<00:06:14.970> fourth<00:06:15.210> option<00:06:15.420> without<00:06:15.720> our

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:16.020 
sometimes a fourth option without our

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:17.540 
sometimes a fourth option without our
backs<00:06:16.230> pinned<00:06:16.470> against<00:06:16.710> the<00:06:16.770> shot<00:06:17.040> clock<00:06:17.310> so

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:17.550 
backs pinned against the shot clock so

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:19.280 
backs pinned against the shot clock so
we'd<00:06:17.970> like<00:06:18.120> to<00:06:18.240> get<00:06:18.330> the<00:06:18.420> ball<00:06:18.570> up<00:06:18.630> the<00:06:18.840> floor<00:06:18.960> a
