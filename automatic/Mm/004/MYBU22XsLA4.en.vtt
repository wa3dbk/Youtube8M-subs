00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
of course can fly at high speeds and

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.660 
of course can fly at high speeds and
eventually<00:01:56.200> at<00:01:56.410> certain<00:01:56.950> points<00:01:57.340> he'll<00:01:57.460> take

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
eventually at certain points he'll take

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.340 
eventually at certain points he'll take
him<00:01:57.850> down<00:01:58.090> bring<00:01:58.510> him<00:01:58.600> down<00:01:58.750> the<00:01:58.930> ground<00:01:59.140> and

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:01.300 
just beat the crap out of them and this

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.420 
just beat the crap out of them and this
is<00:02:01.480> exactly<00:02:01.710> what<00:02:02.710> this<00:02:02.860> screenshot<00:02:03.160> is

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.430 
is exactly what this screenshot is

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.340 
is exactly what this screenshot is
showing<00:02:03.730> you<00:02:03.850> let's<00:02:04.479> move<00:02:04.630> on<00:02:04.810> to<00:02:04.840> the<00:02:05.050> fourth

showing you let's move on to the fourth
one<00:02:05.590> we<00:02:05.770> got<00:02:06.010> the<00:02:06.540> freaking<00:02:07.540> batwing<00:02:08.170> giving

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
one we got the freaking batwing giving

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:09.960 
one we got the freaking batwing giving
upgrades<00:02:09.039> that<00:02:09.280> that<00:02:09.429> will<00:02:09.550> be<00:02:09.670> like<00:02:09.820> the

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
upgrades that that will be like the

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.060 
upgrades that that will be like the
coolest<00:02:10.240> thing<00:02:10.660> and<00:02:10.899> it<00:02:11.320> just<00:02:11.470> makes<00:02:11.680> so<00:02:11.920> much

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.070 
coolest thing and it just makes so much

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.330 
coolest thing and it just makes so much
sense<00:02:12.130> it's<00:02:12.880> just<00:02:13.209> like<00:02:13.860> Stefan<00:02:14.860> he'll<00:02:15.130> like

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
sense it's just like Stefan he'll like

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.310 
sense it's just like Stefan he'll like
you<00:02:15.370> stick<00:02:15.850> close<00:02:15.880> to<00:02:16.360> source<00:02:16.600> material<00:02:17.140> now

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
you stick close to source material now

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.380 
you stick close to source material now
that<00:02:17.530> this<00:02:17.620> is<00:02:17.800> like<00:02:17.950> in<00:02:18.220> source<00:02:18.550> material<00:02:19.090> but

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
that this is like in source material but

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.690 
that this is like in source material but
this<00:02:19.990> fits<00:02:20.260> perfectly<00:02:20.740> in<00:02:20.980> that<00:02:21.010> I<00:02:21.340> mean<00:02:21.550> it's

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
this fits perfectly in that I mean it's

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.630 
this fits perfectly in that I mean it's
just<00:02:21.790> the<00:02:22.300> batwing<00:02:22.750> like<00:02:23.530> connecting<00:02:24.400> to<00:02:24.520> the

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
just the batwing like connecting to the

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.900 
just the batwing like connecting to the
Batmobile<00:02:25.150> just<00:02:25.450> fits<00:02:25.690> so<00:02:26.080> well<00:02:26.110> it's<00:02:26.739> so<00:02:27.100> like

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
Batmobile just fits so well it's so like

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.780 
Batmobile just fits so well it's so like
I<00:02:28.060> have<00:02:28.209> OCD<00:02:28.420> and<00:02:29.080> it's<00:02:29.410> extremely<00:02:30.070> satisfying

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
I have OCD and it's extremely satisfying

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.210 
I have OCD and it's extremely satisfying
so<00:02:31.209> is<00:02:31.390> the<00:02:31.510> fact<00:02:31.810> that<00:02:31.959> Batman<00:02:32.950> in<00:02:33.130> the

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
so is the fact that Batman in the

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.850 
so is the fact that Batman in the
Batmobile<00:02:33.790> are<00:02:34.060> just<00:02:34.510> two<00:02:34.930> and<00:02:35.140> two<00:02:35.470> of<00:02:35.739> the

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
Batmobile are just two and two of the

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.850 
Batmobile are just two and two of the
same<00:02:36.070> person<00:02:36.340> it<00:02:36.640> fits<00:02:37.060> it<00:02:37.780> fits<00:02:37.810> very<00:02:38.260> well<00:02:38.350> as

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
same person it fits it fits very well as

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.380 
same person it fits it fits very well as
we're<00:02:39.100> going<00:02:39.220> to<00:02:39.370> the<00:02:39.459> fifth<00:02:39.670> screenshot<00:02:40.209> we

members of GCPD I don't actually
recognize<00:02:48.489> but<00:02:48.850> this<00:02:49.540> is<00:02:49.690> just<00:02:49.720> Batman

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350

talking<00:02:51.250> to<00:02:51.400> the<00:02:51.550> you<00:02:51.910> know<00:02:52.030> the<00:02:52.150> members<00:02:52.570> of

talking to the you know the members of

talking to the you know the members of
the<00:02:53.170> GCPD<00:02:53.800> who<00:02:54.100> care<00:02:54.370> the<00:02:54.400> most<00:02:54.760> about<00:02:54.970> Gotham

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
the GCPD who care the most about Gotham

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.350 
the GCPD who care the most about Gotham
this<00:02:56.650> has<00:02:56.799> probably<00:02:57.040> taken<00:02:57.370> place<00:02:57.730> it<00:02:57.970> looks

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
this has probably taken place it looks

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.840 
this has probably taken place it looks
like<00:02:58.600> it<00:02:58.720> would<00:02:58.810> be<00:02:58.870> in<00:02:59.080> the<00:02:59.110> GCPD<00:02:59.670> you<00:03:00.670> know

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
like it would be in the GCPD you know

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:02.729 
like it would be in the GCPD you know
the<00:03:01.269> holding<00:03:01.660> cell<00:03:01.900> like<00:03:02.049> that's<00:03:02.230> underground

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:02.739 
the holding cell like that's underground

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:04.050 
the holding cell like that's underground
but<00:03:02.950> it<00:03:03.040> doesn't<00:03:03.340> really<00:03:03.430> look<00:03:03.700> like<00:03:03.760> that

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
but it doesn't really look like that

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.240 
but it doesn't really look like that
because<00:03:04.239> there's<00:03:04.480> a<00:03:04.540> window<00:03:04.930> up<00:03:05.140> in<00:03:05.470> the<00:03:05.650> you

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
because there's a window up in the you

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.039 
because there's a window up in the you
know<00:03:06.280> the<00:03:06.459> top<00:03:06.670> left<00:03:06.940> corner<00:03:07.209> that's<00:03:07.780> looking

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:08.049 
know the top left corner that's looking

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:10.800 
know the top left corner that's looking
out<00:03:08.170> to<00:03:08.290> the<00:03:08.320> sky<00:03:08.650> so<00:03:09.209> this<00:03:10.209> could<00:03:10.390> probably<00:03:10.600> be

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
out to the sky so this could probably be

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.990 
out to the sky so this could probably be
taking<00:03:11.200> place<00:03:11.320> somewhere<00:03:11.680> else<00:03:11.830> this<00:03:12.760> is<00:03:12.880> the

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
taking place somewhere else this is the

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.300 
taking place somewhere else this is the
last<00:03:13.209> second<00:03:14.019> to<00:03:14.110> last<00:03:14.230> screenshot<00:03:14.830> this<00:03:15.160> is

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
last second to last screenshot this is

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.520 
last second to last screenshot this is
once<00:03:15.519> again<00:03:15.640> pretty<00:03:16.299> much<00:03:16.480> the<00:03:16.660> batwing<00:03:17.049> about

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
once again pretty much the batwing about

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.100 
once again pretty much the batwing about
to<00:03:17.769> connect<00:03:18.070> with<00:03:18.130> the<00:03:18.280> Batmobile<00:03:19.110> nothing

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110 
to connect with the Batmobile nothing

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:22.949 
to connect with the Batmobile nothing
really<00:03:20.230> new<00:03:20.530> here<00:03:20.560> it's<00:03:21.010> just<00:03:21.330> HD<00:03:22.330> it's<00:03:22.750> great

to<00:03:23.140> me<00:03:23.260> this<00:03:23.890> is<00:03:24.040> a<00:03:24.070> last<00:03:24.340> screenshot<00:03:24.820> this<00:03:24.970> is

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
to me this is a last screenshot this is

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:26.670 
to me this is a last screenshot this is
the<00:03:25.150> most<00:03:25.330> interesting<00:03:25.690> because<00:03:26.080> it<00:03:26.470> looks

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
the most interesting because it looks

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.350 
the most interesting because it looks
like<00:03:26.860> this<00:03:27.010> is<00:03:27.160> in<00:03:27.310> detective<00:03:27.850> mode<00:03:27.880> and

like this is in detective mode and

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.840 
like this is in detective mode and
there's<00:03:29.200> someone<00:03:29.650> that<00:03:29.769> was<00:03:29.890> beat<00:03:30.100> up<00:03:30.130> we<00:03:30.730> got

there's someone that was beat up we got
