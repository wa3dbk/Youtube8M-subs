planned<00:00:08.030> but<00:00:10.280> I'm<00:00:11.280> dividing<00:00:12.000> my<00:00:12.320> oncidium

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:13.460 
planned but I'm dividing my oncidium

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:19.939 
planned but I'm dividing my oncidium
dancing<00:00:14.460> ladies<00:00:15.770> go<00:00:16.770> with<00:00:16.920> Ramsey<00:00:18.710> it's<00:00:19.710> in

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
one of my older videos and it took me a

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.210 
one of my older videos and it took me a
long<00:00:24.240> time<00:00:24.300> to<00:00:26.630> to<00:00:27.630> do<00:00:27.869> it<00:00:28.050> cuz<00:00:28.349> I<00:00:28.529> always

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
long time to to do it cuz I always

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.709 
long time to to do it cuz I always
forgot<00:00:29.910> to<00:00:30.119> do<00:00:30.240> it<00:00:30.830> but<00:00:31.830> finally<00:00:32.099> I<00:00:32.399> had<00:00:32.820> I<00:00:33.120> made

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
forgot to do it but finally I had I made

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.819 
forgot to do it but finally I had I made
the<00:00:33.840> time<00:00:34.079> to<00:00:35.390> to<00:00:36.390> divide<00:00:36.690> it<00:00:36.870> this<00:00:37.469> is<00:00:37.620> what<00:00:37.800> I

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
the time to to divide it this is what I

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:43.040 
the time to to divide it this is what I
started<00:00:38.190> with<00:00:38.600> it's<00:00:39.600> 1<00:00:40.590> 2<00:00:40.800> 3<00:00:41.070> 4<00:00:41.550> 5<00:00:42.120> pseudobulbs

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
started with it's 1 2 3 4 5 pseudobulbs

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.920 
started with it's 1 2 3 4 5 pseudobulbs
that<00:00:43.230> I<00:00:43.260> had<00:00:43.620> originally<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:44.850> this<00:00:45.570> one<00:00:45.750> the

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
that I had originally and this one the

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.610 
that I had originally and this one the
first<00:00:46.140> one<00:00:46.320> that<00:00:47.129> I<00:00:47.190> got<00:00:47.489> after<00:00:47.670> I<00:00:47.879> bought<00:00:48.210> it

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.620 
first one that I got after I bought it

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.310 
first one that I got after I bought it
as<00:00:49.620> I<00:00:49.860> told<00:00:50.190> you<00:00:50.370> in<00:00:50.460> other<00:00:50.579> video<00:00:50.910> I<00:00:51.270> got<00:00:52.050> this

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
as I told you in other video I got this

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.560 
as I told you in other video I got this
oncidium<00:00:53.270> from<00:00:54.270> from<00:00:55.260> Lowe's<00:00:55.940> and<00:00:56.940> it<00:00:57.120> had<00:00:57.329> no

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
oncidium from from Lowe's and it had no

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.950 
oncidium from from Lowe's and it had no
roots<00:00:58.280> so<00:00:59.280> I<00:00:59.609> put<00:01:00.059> it<00:01:00.180> in<00:01:00.449> a<00:01:00.809> bark<00:01:01.710> media<00:01:02.160> and

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 
roots so I put it in a bark media and

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.140 
roots so I put it in a bark media and
inside<00:01:03.960> a<00:01:03.989> plastic<00:01:04.290> bag<00:01:04.530> and<00:01:05.070> it<00:01:05.519> took<00:01:05.700> 6

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
inside a plastic bag and it took 6

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.789 
inside a plastic bag and it took 6
months<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.630> start<00:01:07.260> growing<00:01:07.710> roots<00:01:08.060> and<00:01:09.799> then

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
months to start growing roots and then

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.340 
months to start growing roots and then
after<00:01:11.250> that<00:01:11.400> I<00:01:11.460> got<00:01:11.610> these<00:01:12.000> other<00:01:12.330> two<00:01:12.720> little

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
after that I got these other two little

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.359 
after that I got these other two little
balls<00:01:13.560> and<00:01:14.100> two<00:01:14.580> more<00:01:14.790> I<00:01:15.409> actually<00:01:16.409> wanted<00:01:17.070> to

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
balls and two more I actually wanted to

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:23.570 
balls and two more I actually wanted to
divide<00:01:18.000> it<00:01:18.180> into<00:01:19.700> 3<00:01:20.700> pseudobulbs<00:01:21.420> each<00:01:21.740> but<00:01:22.740> it

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
divide it into 3 pseudobulbs each but it

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.560 
divide it into 3 pseudobulbs each but it
it<00:01:24.390> actually<00:01:24.900> grew<00:01:25.229> so<00:01:25.799> crooked<00:01:26.180> that<00:01:27.180> it's

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
it actually grew so crooked that it's

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.260 
it actually grew so crooked that it's
not<00:01:27.840> possible<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.799> have<00:01:28.829> 3<00:01:29.520> pseudobulbs

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
not possible to have 3 pseudobulbs

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.620 
not possible to have 3 pseudobulbs
together<00:01:31.670> let<00:01:32.670> me<00:01:32.759> see<00:01:32.909> if<00:01:33.030> I<00:01:33.150> can<00:01:33.360> show<00:01:33.570> you

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
together let me see if I can show you

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:40.100 
together let me see if I can show you
what<00:01:34.500> I<00:01:34.530> mean<00:01:36.979> they<00:01:37.979> face<00:01:38.369> I<00:01:38.909> mean<00:01:39.750> they<00:01:39.869> grow

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
what I mean they face I mean they grow

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.270 
what I mean they face I mean they grow
in<00:01:40.170> totally<00:01:40.680> opposite<00:01:42.500> so<00:01:43.500> this<00:01:43.530> is<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.009> kind

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
in totally opposite so this is the kind

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.270 
in totally opposite so this is the kind
of<00:01:44.399> orchids<00:01:44.970> that<00:01:45.060> grow<00:01:45.829> some<00:01:46.829> people<00:01:47.100> call

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
of orchids that grow some people call

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.639 
of orchids that grow some people call
them<00:01:47.369> climbers<00:01:47.970> because<00:01:48.390> they<00:01:49.170> don't<00:01:49.409> grow

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
them climbers because they don't grow

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:57.200 
them climbers because they don't grow
straight<00:01:51.619> parallel<00:01:53.450> they<00:01:54.450> grow<00:01:54.750> like<00:01:56.210> they're

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
straight parallel they grow like they're

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.170 
straight parallel they grow like they're
attached<00:01:57.479> to<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:57.840> to<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:58.759> trees<00:01:59.759> to<00:02:00.090> the

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
attached to the to the trees to the

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.550 
attached to the to the trees to the
trunks<00:02:00.600> and<00:02:00.750> and<00:02:00.960> they're<00:02:01.530> going<00:02:01.829> up<00:02:02.570> so<00:02:03.570> as

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
trunks and and they're going up so as

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.630 
trunks and and they're going up so as
you<00:02:05.310> can<00:02:05.460> see<00:02:05.670> here<00:02:06.469> the<00:02:07.469> bottom<00:02:08.009> one<00:02:08.340> was

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
you can see here the bottom one was

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.059 
you can see here the bottom one was
before<00:02:09.450> and<00:02:09.690> then<00:02:10.349> the<00:02:10.470> other<00:02:10.590> one<00:02:10.739> is<00:02:10.890> going

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
before and then the other one is going

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.130 
before and then the other one is going
up<00:02:11.400> and<00:02:11.670> the<00:02:11.849> new<00:02:12.030> one<00:02:12.239> is<00:02:12.360> going<00:02:12.569> to<00:02:12.690> be<00:02:12.840> higher

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
up and the new one is going to be higher

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.149 
up and the new one is going to be higher
than<00:02:13.170> that

00:02:14.149 --> 00:02:14.159 
than that

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:19.979 
than that
so<00:02:16.230> I<00:02:17.230> think<00:02:17.829> part<00:02:18.280> of<00:02:18.400> it<00:02:18.489> is<00:02:18.549> it<00:02:18.970> was<00:02:19.180> my<00:02:19.510> fault

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 
so I think part of it is it was my fault

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:27.270 
so I think part of it is it was my fault
because<00:02:20.319> I<00:02:21.989> kept<00:02:22.989> moving<00:02:23.430> the<00:02:24.430> plan<00:02:26.069> and<00:02:27.069> I

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
because I kept moving the plan and I

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:33.319 
because I kept moving the plan and I
didn't<00:02:27.849> let<00:02:28.030> it<00:02:28.090> grow<00:02:28.569> as<00:02:29.049> he<00:02:29.590> should<00:02:31.200> so<00:02:32.200> I

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:33.329 
didn't let it grow as he should so I

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:36.780 
didn't let it grow as he should so I
ended<00:02:34.329> up<00:02:34.420> with<00:02:34.629> this<00:02:34.870> since<00:02:35.260> at<00:02:35.470> Ole<00:02:35.680> Miss<00:02:35.790> but

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
ended up with this since at Ole Miss but

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.360 
ended up with this since at Ole Miss but
this<00:02:37.390> year<00:02:37.689> gave<00:02:38.019> me<00:02:38.170> a<00:02:38.200> really<00:02:38.590> beautiful

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
this year gave me a really beautiful

display of blooms and well I don't have

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.849 
display of blooms and well I don't have
a<00:02:44.590> tripod<00:02:44.829> so<00:02:45.099> that's<00:02:45.640> um<00:02:46.079> so<00:02:47.079> I'm<00:02:47.230> handling

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:02.879 
this is what I made the card as you can
see<00:02:58.750> on<00:02:58.870> this<00:02:59.019> other<00:02:59.230> one<00:02:59.319> here<00:03:01.680> here<00:03:02.680> what

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:02.889 
see on this other one here here what

00:03:02.889 --> 00:03:05.210 
see on this other one here here what
where<00:03:03.340> it<00:03:03.489> was<00:03:03.730> attached<00:03:04.209> to<00:03:04.389> the<00:03:04.569> other<00:03:04.750> one

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
where it was attached to the other one

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:12.410 
where it was attached to the other one
and<00:03:09.209> I'm<00:03:10.209> cutting<00:03:10.959> all<00:03:11.139> the<00:03:11.680> roots<00:03:11.950> that<00:03:12.099> are

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
and I'm cutting all the roots that are

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.229 
and I'm cutting all the roots that are
looking<00:03:13.420> for<00:03:13.859> this<00:03:14.859> one<00:03:15.159> it<00:03:15.400> looks<00:03:16.060> like<00:03:16.209> a

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
looking for this one it looks like a

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:21.300 
looking for this one it looks like a
string<00:03:16.629> this<00:03:16.810> is<00:03:16.989> actually<00:03:17.500> the<00:03:18.280> root<00:03:18.989> and<00:03:20.310> but

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
string this is actually the root and but

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.170 
string this is actually the root and but
it's<00:03:22.060> say<00:03:22.299> inside<00:03:22.810> the<00:03:22.989> root<00:03:23.639> but<00:03:24.639> it<00:03:24.879> should

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
it's say inside the root but it should

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.990 
it's say inside the root but it should
look<00:03:25.449> like<00:03:25.510> this<00:03:25.810> one<00:03:27.359> they<00:03:28.359> are<00:03:28.510> fleshing

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
look like this one they are fleshing

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.899 
look like this one they are fleshing
they<00:03:31.000> have<00:03:31.269> a<00:03:31.299> cover<00:03:33.750> these<00:03:34.750> strings<00:03:35.319> are

00:03:35.899 --> 00:03:35.909 
they have a cover these strings are

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:39.689 
they have a cover these strings are
covered<00:03:36.909> with<00:03:37.540> this<00:03:37.659> other<00:03:37.930> thing<00:03:38.319> that<00:03:38.699> I

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:39.699 
covered with this other thing that I

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:41.369 
covered with this other thing that I
cannot<00:03:40.000> pronounce<00:03:40.269> so<00:03:40.599> I'm<00:03:40.720> not<00:03:40.900> going<00:03:41.109> to<00:03:41.169> say

00:03:41.369 --> 00:03:41.379 
cannot pronounce so I'm not going to say

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:47.729 
cannot pronounce so I'm not going to say
it<00:03:43.680> so<00:03:44.790> I'm<00:03:45.790> cutting<00:03:46.269> when<00:03:46.930> I<00:03:46.959> don't<00:03:47.290> have<00:03:47.500> any

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:47.739 
it so I'm cutting when I don't have any

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:50.009 
it so I'm cutting when I don't have any
roots<00:03:48.159> on<00:03:48.310> my<00:03:48.430> orchids<00:03:48.790> I<00:03:48.970> leave<00:03:49.269> these<00:03:49.479> ones<00:03:49.780> I

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 
roots on my orchids I leave these ones I

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:51.800 
roots on my orchids I leave these ones I
mean<00:03:50.530> I

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
mean I

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.920 
mean I
they<00:03:52.810> are<00:03:52.989> mushy<00:03:53.409> I<00:03:54.090> think<00:03:55.090> already<00:03:55.239> got<00:03:55.900> rid

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
they are mushy I think already got rid

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.210 
they are mushy I think already got rid
of<00:03:56.169> the<00:03:56.530> other<00:03:56.739> one<00:03:56.859> the<00:03:57.419> bad<00:03:58.419> ones<00:03:58.690> anyway<00:03:59.590> so

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
of the other one the bad ones anyway so

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.619 
of the other one the bad ones anyway so
I<00:04:00.549> peel<00:04:01.510> it<00:04:01.659> off<00:04:02.190> and<00:04:03.190> I<00:04:03.370> got<00:04:03.609> all<00:04:03.819> the<00:04:04.060> the

00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:04.629 
I peel it off and I got all the the

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:09.000 
I peel it off and I got all the the
cover<00:04:05.169> because<00:04:05.409> it<00:04:05.680> was<00:04:06.030> brown<00:04:07.030> and<00:04:07.769> mushy

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010 
cover because it was brown and mushy

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.800 
cover because it was brown and mushy
so<00:04:09.970> I<00:04:10.000> just<00:04:10.419> left<00:04:10.720> this<00:04:10.930> string<00:04:11.829> so<00:04:12.819> what<00:04:13.569> I<00:04:13.599> was

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
so I just left this string so what I was

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:15.420 
so I just left this string so what I was
saying<00:04:13.840> is<00:04:14.260> that<00:04:14.290> when<00:04:14.919> they<00:04:15.010> don't<00:04:15.129> have

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
saying is that when they don't have

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.649 
saying is that when they don't have
roots<00:04:15.699> at<00:04:15.849> all<00:04:16.000> I<00:04:16.239> leave<00:04:16.810> these<00:04:16.989> strings<00:04:17.530> and

00:04:18.649 --> 00:04:18.659 
roots at all I leave these strings and

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:25.740 
roots at all I leave these strings and
just<00:04:19.659> to<00:04:20.260> have<00:04:21.659> some<00:04:22.659> way<00:04:23.169> to<00:04:24.419> to<00:04:25.419> get<00:04:25.570> this

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
just to have some way to to get this

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:27.340 
just to have some way to to get this
between<00:04:26.080> the<00:04:26.380> media<00:04:27.010> so<00:04:27.190> they

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:27.350 
between the media so they

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.430 
between the media so they
don't<00:04:27.560> they<00:04:28.280> don't<00:04:28.400> move<00:04:28.640> too<00:04:28.850> much<00:04:29.440> so

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.440 
don't they don't move too much so

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.960 
don't they don't move too much so
because<00:04:30.770> they<00:04:30.890> need<00:04:31.130> somehow<00:04:31.790> to<00:04:32.860> to<00:04:33.970> anchor

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:34.970 
because they need somehow to to anchor

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:41.580 
because they need somehow to to anchor
the<00:04:35.510> plan<00:04:35.750> to<00:04:35.990> the<00:04:36.080> media<00:04:37.480> so<00:04:38.480> I<00:04:39.670> have<00:04:40.670> to<00:04:40.850> dream

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590 
the plan to the media so I have to dream

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:47.500 
the plan to the media so I have to dream
the<00:04:42.590> roots<00:04:42.860> and<00:04:45.520> most<00:04:46.520> of<00:04:46.700> all<00:04:46.910> they<00:04:47.210> have<00:04:47.480> to

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:47.510 
the roots and most of all they have to

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:49.810 
the roots and most of all they have to
look<00:04:47.930> like<00:04:48.170> this<00:04:48.500> one<00:04:48.800> they<00:04:49.370> have<00:04:49.400> to<00:04:49.520> be

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:49.820 
look like this one they have to be

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:54.490 
look like this one they have to be
fleshy<00:04:50.480> and<00:04:50.930> firm<00:04:51.440> and<00:04:52.330> not<00:04:53.330> mushy<00:04:53.780> let<00:04:54.230> me<00:04:54.350> see

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.500 
fleshy and firm and not mushy let me see

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.930 
fleshy and firm and not mushy let me see
if<00:04:54.590> I<00:04:54.680> can<00:04:54.890> find<00:04:55.160> a<00:04:55.400> bad<00:04:55.670> one

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:57.940 
if I can find a bad one

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:01.830 
if I can find a bad one
well<00:04:58.940> I<00:04:59.000> think<00:04:59.090> already<00:04:59.420> cut<00:04:59.810> them<00:04:59.900> all<00:05:00.050> but

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:01.840 
well I think already cut them all but

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:06.760 
well I think already cut them all but
well<00:05:02.840> this<00:05:03.170> one<00:05:03.530> is<00:05:03.940> not<00:05:04.940> too<00:05:05.150> bad<00:05:05.330> but<00:05:05.630> if<00:05:05.900> you

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:06.770 
well this one is not too bad but if you

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:10.050 
well this one is not too bad but if you
touch<00:05:07.550> it<00:05:07.580> you<00:05:08.000> can<00:05:08.210> see<00:05:08.360> that<00:05:08.540> it's<00:05:08.690> not<00:05:08.900> firm

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:10.060 
touch it you can see that it's not firm

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:18.420 
touch it you can see that it's not firm
so<00:05:11.060> you<00:05:11.090> can<00:05:11.450> see<00:05:11.660> here<00:05:16.060> as<00:05:17.060> you<00:05:17.390> can<00:05:17.450> see<00:05:17.600> there

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:18.430 
so you can see here as you can see there

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:23.880 
so you can see here as you can see there
this<00:05:19.430> is<00:05:19.640> the<00:05:20.090> root<00:05:20.360> inside<00:05:21.140> of<00:05:21.470> this<00:05:22.460> cover<00:05:22.970> I

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:23.890 
this is the root inside of this cover I

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:26.320 
this is the root inside of this cover I
don't<00:05:24.890> know<00:05:24.950> if<00:05:25.040> it's<00:05:25.190> called<00:05:25.490> velopment

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:26.330 
don't know if it's called velopment

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:30.400 
don't know if it's called velopment
or<00:05:26.510> something<00:05:27.080> like<00:05:27.200> that<00:05:27.910> so<00:05:29.020> these<00:05:30.020> ones<00:05:30.260> are

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:30.410 
or something like that so these ones are

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:32.850 
or something like that so these ones are
brown<00:05:30.740> because<00:05:30.950> they<00:05:31.250> were<00:05:31.460> outside<00:05:32.090> the<00:05:32.330> pot

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:32.860 
brown because they were outside the pot

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:37.060 
brown because they were outside the pot
so<00:05:33.860> I<00:05:34.280> guess<00:05:34.670> they<00:05:35.120> got<00:05:35.390> burned<00:05:35.690> by<00:05:35.870> the<00:05:36.070> light

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:37.070 
so I guess they got burned by the light

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:40.930 
so I guess they got burned by the light
because<00:05:37.790> they<00:05:37.910> they're<00:05:38.300> by<00:05:39.230> my<00:05:39.440> window<00:05:39.940> facing

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:40.940 
because they they're by my window facing

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:44.230 
because they they're by my window facing
wastes<00:05:41.510> which<00:05:42.050> is<00:05:42.230> really<00:05:42.770> bright<00:05:43.280> on<00:05:43.910> the

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:44.240 
wastes which is really bright on the

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:49.630 
wastes which is really bright on the
afternoons<00:05:46.120> so<00:05:47.680> you<00:05:48.680> have<00:05:48.830> to<00:05:48.980> cut<00:05:49.190> all<00:05:49.430> the

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:49.640 
afternoons so you have to cut all the

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:53.680 
afternoons so you have to cut all the
roots<00:05:49.880> that<00:05:50.060> are<00:05:50.120> looking<00:05:50.600> mushy<00:05:51.380> or<00:05:51.830> or<00:05:52.690> dead

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:53.690 
roots that are looking mushy or or dead

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:57.130 
roots that are looking mushy or or dead
and<00:05:54.640> and<00:05:55.640> leave<00:05:55.910> only<00:05:56.060> the<00:05:56.570> ones<00:05:56.930> that<00:05:57.020> are

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:57.140 
and and leave only the ones that are
