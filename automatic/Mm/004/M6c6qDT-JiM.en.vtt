definitely<00:03:35.090> is<00:03:35.330> lacking<00:03:36.080> that<00:03:36.739> extra<00:03:37.400> thing

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.979 
definitely is lacking that extra thing
to<00:03:38.570> make<00:03:39.200> that<00:03:39.560> price<00:03:39.890> tag<00:03:40.390> realistic<00:03:41.390> so<00:03:41.750> I

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:41.989 
to make that price tag realistic so I

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:44.500 
to make that price tag realistic so I
would<00:03:42.170> expect<00:03:42.590> to<00:03:42.650> pay<00:03:42.739> for<00:03:42.920> this<00:03:43.160> as<00:03:43.459> it<00:03:43.850> sits

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510 
would expect to pay for this as it sits

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.949 
would expect to pay for this as it sits
right<00:03:44.690> now<00:03:44.870> around<00:03:45.739> about<00:03:46.430> 15<00:03:47.030> pounds<00:03:47.360> so<00:03:47.750> I
