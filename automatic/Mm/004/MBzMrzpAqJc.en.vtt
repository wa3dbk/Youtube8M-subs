00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:36.940 
the possibility that you know the

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.240 
the possibility that you know the
Cowboys<00:04:37.360> could<00:04:37.630> show<00:04:37.930> up<00:04:38.140> like<00:04:38.500> they<00:04:38.710> did<00:04:38.770> that

also good possibility that Tony Romo and

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.250 
also good possibility that Tony Romo and
his<00:04:45.070> choking<00:04:45.430> tendencies<00:04:46.240> will<00:04:46.450> show<00:04:46.900> up<00:04:47.080> as

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:47.260 
his choking tendencies will show up as

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.470 
his choking tendencies will show up as
well<00:04:47.410> and<00:04:47.800> you<00:04:48.220> know<00:04:48.340> what<00:04:48.460> I<00:04:48.490> would<00:04:48.850> love<00:04:49.240> to

best<00:04:53.230> I<00:04:53.800> hope<00:04:54.190> this<00:04:54.430> is<00:04:54.640> one<00:04:54.850> of<00:04:54.880> those<00:04:55.060> games

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:55.300

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.080 
best I hope this is one of those games
that's<00:04:55.870> back<00:04:56.290> and<00:04:56.500> forth<00:04:56.770> super<00:04:57.580> close<00:04:57.850> a

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.090 
that's back and forth super close a

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:00.810 
that's back and forth super close a
nail-biter<00:04:58.930> and<00:04:59.290> the<00:04:59.650> Cowboys<00:05:00.130> have<00:05:00.430> it<00:05:00.640> and

nail-biter and the Cowboys have it and

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:03.990 
nail-biter and the Cowboys have it and
then<00:05:01.180> I<00:05:01.210> hope<00:05:01.540> Tony<00:05:02.020> Romo<00:05:02.650> does<00:05:03.460> one<00:05:03.760> of<00:05:03.850> his

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:04.000 
then I hope Tony Romo does one of his

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.650 
then I hope Tony Romo does one of his
epic<00:05:04.690> fails<00:05:05.400> against<00:05:06.400> my<00:05:06.550> Eagles<00:05:07.000> that<00:05:07.090> will
