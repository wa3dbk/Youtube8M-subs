00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
so annoying and learn the maps is also

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.250 
so annoying and learn the maps is also
quite<00:00:50.550> a<00:00:50.670> lot<00:00:51.030> annoying<00:00:51.480> it's<00:00:51.660> really<00:00:51.989> shitty

quite a lot annoying it's really shitty
compared<00:00:52.860> to<00:00:53.039> you<00:00:53.539> quantum<00:00:54.539> apps<00:00:54.690> like<00:00:54.840> this

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
compared to you quantum apps like this

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.959 
compared to you quantum apps like this
this<00:00:55.289> just<00:00:55.350> like<00:00:55.710> Google<00:00:56.100> Instant<00:00:56.460> a<00:00:56.670> short

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
this just like Google Instant a short

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.869 
this just like Google Instant a short
lovely<00:00:57.239> in<00:00:57.329> it<00:00:57.449> but<00:00:58.050> yeah<00:00:58.230> so<00:00:59.160> learner<00:00:59.370> maps<00:00:59.670> is

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
lovely in it but yeah so learner maps is

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.299 
lovely in it but yeah so learner maps is
a<00:00:59.940> lot<00:01:00.420> different<00:01:00.750> than<00:01:01.289> quantum<00:01:01.800> contour

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
a lot different than quantum contour

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.640 
a lot different than quantum contour
maps<00:01:02.489> lunar<00:01:03.000> maps<00:01:03.239> is<00:01:03.480> a<00:01:03.809> really<00:01:04.110> close<00:01:04.320> quotes

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
maps lunar maps is a really close quotes

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.940 
maps lunar maps is a really close quotes
a<00:01:04.830> map<00:01:05.010> with<00:01:05.580> those<00:01:06.299> poor<00:01:06.659> I<00:01:06.990> don't<00:01:07.770> know<00:01:07.830> how

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
a map with those poor I don't know how

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.370 
a map with those poor I don't know how
many<00:01:07.979> pillars<00:01:08.400> let's<00:01:09.000> see<00:01:09.210> one<00:01:09.689> two<00:01:09.720> five

pillars in the middle if you jump if you

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.120 
pillars in the middle if you jump if you
like<00:01:14.130> walk<00:01:14.400> into<00:01:14.820> a<00:01:14.850> pillar<00:01:15.150> it<00:01:15.479> will<00:01:16.130> boost

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
like walk into a pillar it will boost

you up in the air if you walk into the
middle<00:01:19.920> pillar<00:01:20.310> one<00:01:21.150> in<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.299> middle<00:01:21.450> you<00:01:21.720> will

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
middle pillar one in the middle you will

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.690 
middle pillar one in the middle you will
fight<00:01:22.140> all<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.650> way<00:01:22.680> until<00:01:22.920> you<00:01:23.220> hit<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.430> roof

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
fight all the way until you hit the roof

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.030 
fight all the way until you hit the roof
at<00:01:24.240> least<00:01:24.479> sometimes<00:01:25.049> but<00:01:25.619> there's<00:01:25.770> also<00:01:25.860> a

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
at least sometimes but there's also a

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.560 
at least sometimes but there's also a
lot<00:01:26.070> of<00:01:26.189> teleportation<00:01:26.610> some<00:01:27.060> rooms<00:01:27.360> and

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
lot of teleportation some rooms and

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.090 
lot of teleportation some rooms and
doors<00:01:27.659> open<00:01:28.110> like<00:01:28.200> you<00:01:28.439> to<00:01:28.530> see<00:01:28.680> just<00:01:28.890> a<00:01:28.979> few

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
seconds ago and then you can just walk

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.050 
seconds ago and then you can just walk
in<00:01:31.920> something<00:01:32.280> and<00:01:32.430> it<00:01:32.490> will<00:01:32.579> teleport<00:01:32.790> you

in something and it will teleport you

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.999 
in something and it will teleport you
all<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.540> way<00:01:33.630> up<00:01:33.840> to<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:34.140> map<00:01:34.380> or<00:01:34.590> like

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
all the way up to the map or like

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.539 
all the way up to the map or like
different<00:01:35.490> place<00:01:35.670> but<00:01:36.210> also<00:01:36.390> you<00:01:37.049> can<00:01:37.340> put<00:01:38.340> out

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
different place but also you can put out

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.910 
different place but also you can put out
so<00:01:38.850> turn<00:01:39.060> out<00:01:39.270> to<00:01:39.570> gravity<00:01:40.020> this<00:01:40.350> is<00:01:40.530> little

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
so turn out to gravity this is little

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.789 
so turn out to gravity this is little
cube<00:01:41.250> if<00:01:41.430> you<00:01:41.579> press<00:01:41.909> on<00:01:42.240> it<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:43.170> zero<00:01:43.590> gravity

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
cube if you press on it the zero gravity

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.600 
cube if you press on it the zero gravity
will<00:01:44.369> stop<00:01:45.149> or<00:01:45.450> okay<00:01:46.170> activated<00:01:47.040> again<00:01:47.130> so

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
will stop or okay activated again so

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.039 
will stop or okay activated again so
where<00:01:47.729> you<00:01:47.880> getting<00:01:48.299> schooled<00:01:48.630> in<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:48.930> air

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
where you getting schooled in the air

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.039 
where you getting schooled in the air
but<00:01:49.229> its<00:01:49.409> pillars<00:01:49.770> and<00:01:50.100> it's<00:01:50.610> it's<00:01:51.299> off<00:01:51.479> you're

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
but its pillars and it's it's off you're

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.020 
but its pillars and it's it's off you're
just<00:01:52.200> flipping<00:01:52.829> die<00:01:53.040> instantly<00:01:53.549> because<00:01:53.880> you

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
just flipping die instantly because you

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.660 
just flipping die instantly because you
fall<00:01:54.720> to<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:55.049> ground<00:01:55.079> so<00:01:55.649> hard<00:01:55.860> which<00:01:56.490> is

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
fall to the ground so hard which is

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.429 
fall to the ground so hard which is
really<00:01:56.909> annoying<00:01:57.149> also<00:01:57.840> an<00:01:57.899> annoying<00:01:58.140> thing

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
really annoying also an annoying thing

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.640 
it will make the mac unplayable I mean I
think<00:04:21.060> the<00:04:21.209> concept<00:04:21.630> is<00:04:21.810> really<00:04:22.109> interesting

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
think the concept is really interesting

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.280 
think the concept is really interesting
and<00:04:22.740> really<00:04:22.800> cool<00:04:23.190> but<00:04:23.790> I<00:04:24.060> don't<00:04:24.360> think<00:04:25.050> that

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:25.290 
and really cool but I don't think that

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:28.550 
and really cool but I don't think that
it's<00:04:25.410> too<00:04:25.860> smart<00:04:26.400> to<00:04:26.790> be<00:04:26.910> doing<00:04:27.210> since<00:04:27.540> I<00:04:27.840> know

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
it's too smart to be doing since I know

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.160 
it's just I have mixed feelings about
this<00:04:31.350> map<00:04:31.590> a<00:04:31.860> lots<00:04:32.700> of<00:04:32.940> mixed<00:04:33.270> feelings<00:04:33.300> it's

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:34.170 
this map a lots of mixed feelings it's

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:36.830 
this map a lots of mixed feelings it's
also<00:04:34.320> a<00:04:34.500> really<00:04:34.680> easy<00:04:35.010> base<00:04:35.340> camp<00:04:35.700> map<00:04:35.970> because

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
also a really easy base camp map because

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.080 
also a really easy base camp map because
your<00:04:37.320> base<00:04:37.590> is<00:04:37.620> still<00:04:38.070> quite<00:04:38.340> a<00:04:38.370> solid<00:04:38.850> place

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
your base is still quite a solid place

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:40.970 
your base is still quite a solid place
and<00:04:39.390> you<00:04:39.690> can<00:04:39.840> just<00:04:39.990> camp<00:04:40.200> around<00:04:40.380> the<00:04:40.560> corner

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:40.980 
and you can just camp around the corner

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:44.030 
and you can just camp around the corner
if<00:04:41.160> you're<00:04:41.550> an<00:04:42.000> alpha<00:04:42.360> like<00:04:42.900> I<00:04:43.080> am<00:04:43.260> and<00:04:43.710> you<00:04:43.830> can

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:44.040 
if you're an alpha like I am and you can

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.460 
if you're an alpha like I am and you can
if<00:04:44.190> you<00:04:44.280> can<00:04:44.310> basically<00:04:44.730> I'm<00:04:45.120> Bravo<00:04:45.600> so<00:04:46.050> easily

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
if you can basically I'm Bravo so easily

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.680 
if you can basically I'm Bravo so easily

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
and I know just the map it's ah but yeah

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.890 
and I know just the map it's ah but yeah
so<00:04:55.470> the<00:04:55.560> map<00:04:55.710> brings<00:04:56.550> you<00:04:56.790> a<00:04:56.850> lots<00:04:57.150> of<00:04:57.360> shit<00:04:57.600> you

so the map brings you a lots of shit you

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.440 
so the map brings you a lots of shit you
can<00:04:58.050> also<00:04:58.200> if<00:04:58.890> you<00:04:59.010> see<00:04:59.220> now<00:04:59.550> there<00:05:00.180> was<00:05:00.300> this
