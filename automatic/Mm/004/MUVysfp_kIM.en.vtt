00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:13.580 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:19.669 

they<00:01:14.580> said<00:01:14.960> two<00:01:15.960> tools<00:01:16.380> in<00:01:16.710> one<00:01:18.319> here<00:01:19.319> we<00:01:19.470> have

00:01:19.669 --> 00:01:19.679 
they said two tools in one here we have

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:26.899 
they said two tools in one here we have
a<00:01:21.380> carabiner<00:01:23.780> which<00:01:24.780> could<00:01:25.110> use<00:01:25.490> be<00:01:26.490> used<00:01:26.670> as<00:01:26.880> a

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
a carabiner which could use be used as a

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:35.920 
a carabiner which could use be used as a
bottle<00:01:27.450> opener

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:44.160 

well<00:01:36.940> there's<00:01:37.940> a<00:01:38.090> pocket<00:01:38.360> clip<00:01:40.630> point<00:01:41.630> down

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:51.910 

the<00:01:45.670> Sun<00:01:46.670> started<00:01:47.210> over<00:01:47.570> here<00:01:50.290> and<00:01:51.290> then<00:01:51.650> they

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
the Sun started over here and then they

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.540 
the Sun started over here and then they
have<00:01:52.190> this<00:01:52.550> blade<00:01:53.030> launcher<00:01:53.810> I<00:01:54.050> remember<00:01:54.800> what

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:55.550 
have this blade launcher I remember what

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:11.410 
have this blade launcher I remember what
it's<00:01:55.670> called<00:02:06.190> quick<00:02:07.190> release<00:02:07.610> thing<00:02:08.770> where<00:02:10.420> it

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
it's called quick release thing where it

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:21.370 
it's called quick release thing where it
goes<00:02:13.239> just<00:02:14.239> halfway<00:02:17.980> like<00:02:18.980> that<00:02:19.630> so<00:02:20.630> you<00:02:21.260> have

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
goes just halfway like that so you have

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:37.180 
goes just halfway like that so you have
to<00:02:21.530> flick<00:02:21.770> it<00:02:21.920> open<00:02:32.590> have<00:02:33.590> this<00:02:35.709> visit<00:02:36.709> pivots

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
to flick it open have this visit pivots

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.670 
to flick it open have this visit pivots
I<00:02:38.380> remember<00:02:39.380> I<00:02:39.590> have<00:02:39.920> to<00:02:40.070> look<00:02:40.190> it<00:02:40.400> up<00:02:40.430> again<00:02:41.000> I

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
I remember I have to look it up again I

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:49.030 
I remember I have to look it up again I
can't<00:02:42.680> remember<00:02:43.010> all<00:02:43.340> the<00:02:43.489> stuff<00:02:44.380> I<00:02:48.040> thought

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
can't remember all the stuff I thought

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:56.229 
can't remember all the stuff I thought
at<00:02:49.459> first<00:02:51.130> the<00:02:52.130> Hoffs<00:02:52.700> rated<00:02:53.239> at<00:02:53.360> edge<00:02:54.850> as<00:02:55.850> you

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
at first the Hoffs rated at edge as you

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:03.130 
at first the Hoffs rated at edge as you
can<00:02:56.450> see<00:02:56.660> there<00:02:57.190> would<00:02:58.190> be<00:02:58.220> a<00:02:58.370> problem<00:03:02.140> but

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
can see there would be a problem but

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:11.610 
can see there would be a problem but
actually<00:03:05.410> it<00:03:06.410> works<00:03:06.739> great<00:03:07.040> even<00:03:07.700> the<00:03:07.850> car<00:03:08.120> wit

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.449 

it<00:03:12.620> works<00:03:12.980> great<00:03:13.430> on<00:03:13.700> ropes<00:03:14.420> and<00:03:14.870> stuff<00:03:15.459> so

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
it works great on ropes and stuff so

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:23.199 
it works great on ropes and stuff so
this<00:03:16.880> one<00:03:17.090> is<00:03:17.650> always<00:03:18.650> on<00:03:18.980> the<00:03:19.160> boat<00:03:22.209> and

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
this one is always on the boat and

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:25.180 
this one is always on the boat and
therefore<00:03:23.750> the<00:03:23.870> carabiner<00:03:24.440> is<00:03:24.560> good<00:03:24.829> it<00:03:24.950> too

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
therefore the carabiner is good it too

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:35.680 
therefore the carabiner is good it too
is<00:03:26.000> to<00:03:26.269> hang<00:03:26.480> it<00:03:30.760> it's<00:03:31.760> liner<00:03:32.090> lock<00:03:34.510> you<00:03:35.510> can

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
is to hang it it's liner lock you can

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:37.140 
is to hang it it's liner lock you can
see<00:03:35.870> there

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
see there

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:45.540 
see there
and<00:03:38.440> the<00:03:39.460> blade<00:03:40.460> fits<00:03:41.060> real<00:03:41.390> real<00:03:41.720> real<00:03:41.750> good

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:45.550 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:49.270 

the<00:03:46.550> carabiner<00:03:47.030> has<00:03:47.600> a<00:03:47.630> lot<00:03:48.200> to<00:03:48.530> it<00:03:48.710> so<00:03:48.950> you

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
the carabiner has a lot to it so you

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.810 
the carabiner has a lot to it so you
can't<00:03:50.230> push<00:03:51.230> back<00:03:51.590> you<00:03:51.830> have<00:03:51.950> to<00:03:52.130> push<00:03:52.490> it<00:03:52.640> down

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:52.820 
can't push back you have to push it down

00:03:52.820 --> 00:04:03.040 
can't push back you have to push it down
and<00:03:53.180> done<00:03:53.360> back<00:03:54.610> down<00:03:55.610> done<00:03:56.210> back<00:04:00.430> okay<00:04:02.050> the

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:03.050 
and done back down done back okay the

and done back down done back okay the
blade<00:04:03.320> is<00:04:05.710> 7.1<00:04:06.710> centimeters<00:04:10.540> 2.8<00:04:11.540> inches<00:04:12.970> when

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970 
blade is 7.1 centimeters 2.8 inches when

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:23.610 
blade is 7.1 centimeters 2.8 inches when
it's<00:04:14.090> closed<00:04:15.640> it's<00:04:18.010> 40<00:04:19.390> 4<00:04:20.390> inches<00:04:21.080> and<00:04:22.420> 10.3

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050 
it's a lightweight ER because of the

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:40.510 
it's a lightweight ER because of the
aluminum<00:04:36.190> can<00:04:37.190> remove<00:04:37.700> the<00:04:38.090> pocket<00:04:38.540> clip<00:04:39.520> if

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:40.520

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:53.510 
like this yeah that's about it you can

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:57.629 
like this yeah that's about it you can
probably<00:05:54.700> change<00:05:55.700> the<00:05:55.850> side<00:05:56.330> of<00:05:56.360> it<00:05:56.720> if<00:05:57.080> you

00:05:57.629 --> 00:05:57.639 
probably change the side of it if you

00:05:57.639 --> 00:06:01.500 
probably change the side of it if you
take<00:05:58.639> out<00:05:58.820> some<00:05:59.090> pliers<00:05:59.360> or<00:05:59.810> something<00:06:00.370> but

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:01.510 
take out some pliers or something but

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:08.580 
take out some pliers or something but
I'm<00:06:02.510> right<00:06:02.810> handed<00:06:03.020> so<00:06:03.560> it<00:06:03.860> stays<00:06:04.370> that<00:06:04.400> way

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:08.590 

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:12.130 

hope<00:06:09.590> you<00:06:09.770> enjoyed<00:06:10.100> it
