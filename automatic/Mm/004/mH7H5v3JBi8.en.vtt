00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:04.650
 hello to everyone and lucas for 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.540
 to be called today I'm going 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.570
 do you a little video about battles 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.840
 run a free game that came out to 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:15.450
 homeland for a long time where I am already 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:17.070
 ranked in the best so I'm going 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.880
 you make a little video and you 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:24.180
 know there by looking at my wallpaper 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:27.330
 or the apps that my ipad is 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:30.740
 equipped with ios is just going 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:35.030
 7.0 that came out a long time ago 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.030
 so good video 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:51.180
 so here we are on the app you 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:54.100
 can see I'm ranking 5 7 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:58.150
 1584 so I'm the second of the 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:01:04.180
 line of the boss league lead here 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:08.200
 time as the first at 9506 the second 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:09.760
 and the third set came to me as I 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:13.810
 will try to make you the best 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:18.479
 video so with this nice character who 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:20.820
 is conducted everything is more expensive 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.290
 improvements we can have 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.300
 so I'll make you a little 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.880
 video 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:30.610
 a little part about this on this game 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.800
 huge which is very very very very good 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:37.810
 where the graphics are very well done 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:41.800
 so I hope I'm going to make you a 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:46.979
 good part I will not be the last 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.979

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:59.750
 my internet connection is not famous 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:02.170
 right now so if there are bugs that's 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.170
 normal 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.720
 it promises 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.050
 and 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.510
 you 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:36.740
 you can see also in the race 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:42.970
 that it's a murderous race where we have 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:42.970
 is full of weapons and also that 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:54.920
 and also that when we pick up cubes 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:58.100
 eh ben we unlock an object whatever 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:00.320
 the object is made go further 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.900

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:04.660
 walk done pump to finish 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:08.780

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:11.990
