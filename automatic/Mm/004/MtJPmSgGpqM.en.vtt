00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
we ran drivers setup 64 because we are

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.539 
we ran drivers setup 64 because we are

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
to cue PST we didn't know what PR L

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.679 
to cue PST we didn't know what PR L
stands<00:01:58.950> for<00:01:59.070> is<00:01:59.430> preferred<00:01:59.820> roaming<00:02:00.210> list<00:02:00.420> and
