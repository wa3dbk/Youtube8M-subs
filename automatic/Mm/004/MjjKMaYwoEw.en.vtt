00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:07.890
 hello everyone with you again boris 

00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:11.940
 decided to remove the additions of the post loop 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:15.900
 why its because the original 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:21.380
 the idea did not work out initially 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:26.300
 such was bilan dead arrow 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:30.029
 there were no turns when contacting 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:32.759
 but made for back heel 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:37.649
 to Cyril pulled back Batman 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:40.579
 washing but practice has shown that the reverse 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:45.989
 how many works up to half 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:49.610
 a big tower when you went out 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:53.399
 draw out the example here as an angle up 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:56.039
 towers over everything began to engage 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:01:03.180
 side of the body and speaking gave inertia 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:09.440
 strong simply put was the fear that 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:11.660
 she generally breaks down what i did 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:15.020
 again studied the Internet looked 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:18.650
 everywhere you probably decided all the same people 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:26.440
 probably not for nothing came up with this one 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:32.050
 vector tag did what it means 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:33.340
 a hinge was made on the boom of the tower 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:38.210
 to 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:42.700
 screed went here and so on 180 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:46.760
 degrees here from centimeter already 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:49.730
 a centimeter iron made an ear carved 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:52.940
 here are such blanks dressing on 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:56.330
 screed and all this through the bolts over here 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:02:00.140
 attached the hinge attached through 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:03.290
 amplifiers too centimeter further here 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:06.080
 This is a turn signal made from 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:10.250
 thick-walled pipes, too, centimeter 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:14.750
 each pipe is taken 5 millimeters 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:16.730
 eat with dad 5 millimeters with mom 5 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:21.250
 millimeters so they go chamfer 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:23.959
 chamfer rested plus another finger 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:26.900
 holes are made at a distance of 5 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:32.330
 millimeters apart for through 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:36.680
 fingertip cut in the tower 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:40.489
 Inserted sleeve in my 35 millimeters 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:44.910
 outer diameter inner 25 and finger 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:49.490
 25 well and 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.490
 now practice has shown that 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:59.500
 this vector thrust system 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:02.810
 works fine is below that top 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:06.920
 the only problem appears when 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:09.489
 Need to say directly bottom 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:13.849
 the box there is just the bottom of the door here 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:15.530
 here it is a tie she interferes before 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:18.170
 will have to come up with something here 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:23.079
 running dog any on the back 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:27.290
 screed is no longer a problem in principle 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:30.709
 it has proven itself well gay though 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:34.629
 This profile is not like that 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:37.549
 wall force 4 millimeters i.e. he 

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:40.040
 when you start working everything rises 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:43.519
 rests when the tension appears all 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:46.780
 inertia disappears completely and all 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:54.760
 inertia goes to the exhaust hood 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:04:01.459
 Well , I do not know how to show well 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:08.140
 Now the boom is now rising after 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:10.090
 rests on the turn signal ends 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:13.350
 that's the same 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:17.260
 body cracks with might and main 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:22.980
 this rack she was overwhelmed was 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:27.130
 pull further here what else 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:31.540
 as in the first part said that this a 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:34.000
 god turn signal holes turned out not 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:38.050
 coaxial to each other but there is another here 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:46.110
 outside and therefore throw a finger through 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:49.160
 but itâ€™s not clear 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:50.570
 boom swing adjustments back and forth 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:54.200
 decreases 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:57.900
 so I've already started quietly 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:58.650
 six metal honestly soon more here 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:03.420
 fat 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:06.960
 and the first thing I thought of then put 

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:09.540
 here a sheet of fat that and edentichnye 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:13.500
 on top of another, flood the pad with 

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:15.650
 a hole to let the finger cellar through it 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:20.730
 into this hole 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:23.610
 then already or adjustment will come out more 

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:27.450
 clear note 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:31.980
 slipway pleased in principle pulls 

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:35.460
 works well well the only thing 

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:36.470
 when I throw an arrow in the direction but tom 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:40.320
 turn signals 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:43.080
 tower throwing away the side starts 

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:44.990
 turn out here but here too 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:50.220
 I prepare the clamp 

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:53.570
 there will be a thick-walled yoke puffed out of long 

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:58.040
 nuts on the bolts indigenous 

00:05:53.570 --> 00:06:02.460
 pneumatic wrench spun scored it all 

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:06.510
 there is not going anywhere so friends 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:11.569
 who watched the first part about my 

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:15.409
 self-made slipway can honestly say 

00:06:11.569 --> 00:06:19.119
 to work with reverse fastener even 

00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:21.860
 probably from a thick pipe will not work 

00:06:19.119 --> 00:06:26.240
 why because inertia appears 

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:28.959
 strong so best to do here 

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:32.089
 such a vector traction 

00:06:28.959 --> 00:06:37.119
 even though it takes a lot of time for these things 

00:06:32.089 --> 00:06:41.139
 hinges and material to look for but it is more 

00:06:37.119 --> 00:06:44.119
 constructively it turns out so 

00:06:41.139 --> 00:06:49.779
 the conclusion is what is best done 

00:06:44.119 --> 00:06:52.419
 on pushing vector traction called 

00:06:49.779 --> 00:06:56.559
 all all inertia 

00:06:52.419 --> 00:07:01.580
 of all these elements only fingers go 

00:06:56.559 --> 00:07:02.330
 2 that finger rub the middle finger on 

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:05.529
 finger i 

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:09.740
 screed goes into the car itself 

00:07:05.529 --> 00:07:10.900
 unique not on bath lags and designs 

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:14.490
 stocks 

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:18.790
 so friends if anyone started doing 

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:21.780
 redo it is too late all good luck 

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:21.780
 bye everyone
