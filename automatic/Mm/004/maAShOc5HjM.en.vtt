 doing classroom or other classroom

 work as technical visits 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.329
 practically impossible 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.969
 the strike of the administrative technicians 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:59.280

 is in favor of dialogue and cites in 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.840
 advances already made between rectory and 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.909
 administrative technicians on strike 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.280
 according to professor marconi jamilson 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.049
 ufop's management understands that the 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.390
 Dialogue is the best way to 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.180
 solution of conflicts according to him the 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.560
 administration has not measured efforts 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.930
 with the national association of 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.360

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.159

 at the national level are resumed. 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.110
 sooner for the sake of the greater 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.240
 equity that the public university 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.560
 autonomous and democratic enclosure 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.990
 We talked to luiz otávio. 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.030

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.700
 direction 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:53.250

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.800

 The movement was organized by the 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:16.830
 if it is the advice of basic entities 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.510

 none entered the campus neither vehicles nor 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:47.610
 pedestrians how does the intention work 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.470

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.200
 I think we want it and that's what it was 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.240
 There are promised people who want to come 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.250
 You do not want 30 percent which is the 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:01.590
 jec that the strike has to give us want 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.450
 100% to pop what we have to have and 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.250
 That's what we're asking that this 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.500
 movement has already been triggered in 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.630
 other Mariana units we'll take yes 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.430
 Yes, there is information that I 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.709
 I have been able to talk to him for 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.570
 the morning is also in the 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:17.459
 idea for the whole body even from 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:19.380
 How long have you been here? I'm here. 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.850
 six in the morning until six in the morning where 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.070
 intends to stay until 11 pm and 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.890
 Maybe even the days we want. 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:26.820
 having an answer said that while the 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:28.320
 The answer is do not leave here. 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:30.480
 It is also good to remember that in the week 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.160
 come on Wednesday at 3 pm 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.930
 that in our speaker of the space in 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.310
 a team that not in fact I was already 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.350
 general assembly of students to 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.930
 continue this debate keep this debate 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:43.260
 continues to grow and develop 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:45.630
 idea by which the rectory speaks the position 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:48.090
 of the rector is in favor of the 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:51.630
 rights of administrative technicians 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:53.340
 this manifestation would then be a 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:55.980
 the federal government to take a 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.250
 The decision is in favor of the 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.990
 this strike also 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.090
 we want to see the strike 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:03.280
 mobilized to write the strike do 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:05.800
 now is to make the strike happen 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.600
 in this sense the people who see in Greece 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:12.870
 solved and I think the answer 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:12.870
 for the strike and this is what he wants to see 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:35.430
 newspaper voice duty to inform
