00:00:47.939 --> 00:00:47.949 
PvE anyway you see the problem here

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:49.950 
PvE anyway you see the problem here
isn't<00:00:48.579> the<00:00:48.789> weapon<00:00:49.089> to<00:00:49.449> me<00:00:49.570> he<00:00:49.690> would<00:00:49.809> just

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:49.960 
isn't the weapon to me he would just

can't be bothered to aim technically
speaking<00:00:51.730> this<00:00:52.390> is<00:00:52.570> the<00:00:52.749> best<00:00:52.989> primary<00:00:53.499> exact

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:53.800 
speaking this is the best primary exact

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.529 
speaking this is the best primary exact
because<00:00:54.069> it's<00:00:54.309> a<00:00:54.399> one<00:00:54.609> headshot<00:00:55.030> kill<00:00:55.210> weapon

00:00:55.529 --> 00:00:55.539 
because it's a one headshot kill weapon

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:56.880 
because it's a one headshot kill weapon
the<00:00:55.719> difference<00:00:56.050> between<00:00:56.170> getting<00:00:56.469> that<00:00:56.710> one

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:56.890 
the difference between getting that one

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.369 
the difference between getting that one
hit<00:00:57.100> kill<00:00:57.339> and<00:00:57.519> the<00:00:57.699> player<00:00:57.879> is<00:00:58.089> aim<00:00:58.539> and<00:00:58.899> in

00:00:59.369 --> 00:00:59.379 
hit kill and the player is aim and in

using<00:01:06.250> stalker<00:01:06.610> which<00:01:06.790> basically<00:01:07.240> grants<00:01:07.570> the

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:07.659 
using stalker which basically grants the

which basically increases the invisible
affect<00:01:11.740> the<00:01:12.430> objective<00:01:12.820> here<00:01:13.000> is<00:01:13.030> to

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:13.120 
affect the objective here is to

sight<00:01:15.220> we<00:01:15.640> do<00:01:15.760> this<00:01:15.880> because<00:01:16.030> when<00:01:16.360> you<00:01:16.479> aim<00:01:16.659> at

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 
sight we do this because when you aim at

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.000 
sight we do this because when you aim at
the<00:01:16.930> head<00:01:17.080> of<00:01:17.110> your<00:01:17.290> enemy<00:01:17.320> you<00:01:17.680> will<00:01:17.710> see<00:01:17.979> a

even<00:01:32.740> before<00:01:32.860> pausing<00:01:33.160> I<00:01:33.430> knew<00:01:33.580> I<00:01:33.610> was<00:01:33.730> going

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
even before pausing I knew I was going

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.130 
even before pausing I knew I was going

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
to get the head shot because the red dot

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:36.840 
to get the head shot because the red dot
stands<00:01:35.380> out<00:01:35.500> a<00:01:35.530> lot<00:01:35.920> more<00:01:36.190> when<00:01:36.460> in<00:01:36.580> camera

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850

example this guy stood absolute no

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:43.950 
example this guy stood absolute no
