00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
well you can't tell I took a huge saw

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.890 
well you can't tell I took a huge saw
that<00:00:11.099> I<00:00:11.160> imagine<00:00:11.639> is<00:00:11.759> intended<00:00:12.240> for<00:00:12.269> wood<00:00:12.630> and

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
that I imagine is intended for wood and

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.880 
that I imagine is intended for wood and
made<00:00:13.889> one<00:00:14.250> big<00:00:14.759> cut<00:00:15.630> straight<00:00:16.080> down<00:00:16.139> here<00:00:16.740> that

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
made one big cut straight down here that

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.560 
made one big cut straight down here that
you<00:00:16.949> might<00:00:17.100> be<00:00:17.130> able<00:00:17.310> to<00:00:17.460> make<00:00:17.550> out<00:00:17.910> just

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
you might be able to make out just

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.240 
you might be able to make out just
barely<00:00:18.810> it's<00:00:19.080> not<00:00:19.289> too<00:00:19.439> noticeable<00:00:19.619> let's

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
barely it's not too noticeable let's

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.620 
barely it's not too noticeable let's
pull<00:00:20.460> this<00:00:20.580> thing<00:00:20.820> off<00:00:20.939> here<00:00:21.180> so<00:00:21.330> you<00:00:21.420> can<00:00:21.539> get

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
pull this thing off here so you can get

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.710 
pull this thing off here so you can get
a<00:00:21.689> better<00:00:21.840> look<00:00:22.340> then<00:00:23.340> when<00:00:24.029> I<00:00:24.060> cut<00:00:24.390> that<00:00:24.420> in

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
a better look then when I cut that in

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.599 
a better look then when I cut that in
half<00:00:24.750> I<00:00:25.109> had<00:00:25.260> two<00:00:25.500> separate<00:00:25.859> squid<00:00:26.130> off<00:00:26.279> halves

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
half I had two separate squid off halves

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.019 
half I had two separate squid off halves
and<00:00:26.910> I<00:00:27.510> made<00:00:27.720> a<00:00:27.900> little<00:00:28.199> cut<00:00:28.500> straight<00:00:28.949> through

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:29.029 
and I made a little cut straight through

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:31.400 
and I made a little cut straight through
here<00:00:30.029> that<00:00:30.330> you<00:00:30.390> might<00:00:30.449> be<00:00:30.689> able<00:00:30.750> to<00:00:30.900> see<00:00:31.170> along

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
here that you might be able to see along

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.590 
here that you might be able to see along
that<00:00:31.590> line<00:00:31.830> and<00:00:32.099> another<00:00:32.790> one<00:00:33.000> straight<00:00:33.360> down

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
that line and another one straight down

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.740 
that line and another one straight down
here<00:00:34.610> with<00:00:35.610> all<00:00:35.790> of<00:00:35.820> these<00:00:36.059> cuts<00:00:36.390> I<00:00:36.570> actually

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
here with all of these cuts I actually

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.869 
here with all of these cuts I actually
managed<00:00:37.320> to<00:00:37.440> avoid<00:00:37.770> hitting<00:00:38.100> anything<00:00:38.430> of<00:00:38.700> any

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
managed to avoid hitting anything of any

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.450 
managed to avoid hitting anything of any
sort<00:00:39.149> of<00:00:39.239> importance<00:00:39.809> so<00:00:40.680> that<00:00:40.860> opened<00:00:41.219> up<00:00:41.309> the

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
sort of importance so that opened up the

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.430 
sort of importance so that opened up the
body<00:00:41.670> for<00:00:42.000> me<00:00:42.149> to<00:00:42.450> put<00:00:42.660> all<00:00:42.809> of<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:43.110> work<00:00:43.290> you

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
body for me to put all of the work you

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.860 
body for me to put all of the work you
bits<00:00:43.620> inside<00:00:44.000> except<00:00:45.000> for<00:00:45.210> this<00:00:45.329> which<00:00:45.629> I

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
bits inside except for this which I

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.319 
bits inside except for this which I
intend<00:00:46.110> on<00:00:46.410> replacing<00:00:46.829> but<00:00:47.340> i'm<00:00:47.789> just<00:00:48.120> going

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
intend on replacing but i'm just going

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:49.910 
intend on replacing but i'm just going
to<00:00:48.360> use<00:00:48.450> this<00:00:48.719> as<00:00:48.930> a<00:00:48.960> demonstration<00:00:49.260> that<00:00:49.680> it

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
to use this as a demonstration that it

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.220 
to use this as a demonstration that it
does<00:00:50.070> still<00:00:50.399> work<00:00:50.640> so<00:00:51.449> let's<00:00:51.719> play<00:00:51.960> some

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
does still work so let's play some

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:59.479 
does still work so let's play some
crappy<00:00:52.949> music<00:00:53.129> through<00:00:53.579> this<00:00:53.699> thing<00:00:54.000> and<00:00:58.489> the

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
crappy music through this thing and the

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.119 
crappy music through this thing and the
speakers<00:00:59.910> in<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.120> mouth<00:01:00.739> speaker<00:01:01.739> i<00:01:01.770> should

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
speakers in the mouth speaker i should

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.990 
speakers in the mouth speaker i should
say<00:01:02.370> is<00:01:02.730> playing<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.449> music<00:01:04.040> so<00:01:05.040> l<00:01:05.580> still

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
say is playing the music so l still

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.510 
say is playing the music so l still
works<00:01:06.299> and<00:01:06.979> we<00:01:07.979> should<00:01:08.130> probably<00:01:08.280> get<00:01:08.460> a

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
works and we should probably get a

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.920 
works and we should probably get a
better<00:01:08.580> look<00:01:08.790> at<00:01:09.000> what's<00:01:09.060> going<00:01:09.450> on<00:01:09.570> inside<00:01:09.750> of

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
better look at what's going on inside of

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.090 
better look at what's going on inside of
here<00:01:10.200> so<00:01:10.380> I'm<00:01:10.439> just<00:01:10.590> going<00:01:10.710> to<00:01:10.770> disconnect

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
here so I'm just going to disconnect

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.980 
here so I'm just going to disconnect
this<00:01:12.020> and<00:01:13.020> put<00:01:13.890> that<00:01:14.010> aside<00:01:14.299> after<00:01:15.299> I've<00:01:15.720> made

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
this and put that aside after I've made

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.780 
this and put that aside after I've made
all<00:01:16.170> these<00:01:16.350> cuts<00:01:16.650> I<00:01:16.860> had<00:01:17.130> a<00:01:17.159> separate<00:01:17.549> piece

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
all these cuts I had a separate piece

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.230 
all these cuts I had a separate piece
that<00:01:18.119> I<00:01:18.210> could<00:01:18.390> just<00:01:18.570> pull<00:01:18.810> clean<00:01:19.590> off<00:01:20.240> like

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
that I could just pull clean off like

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.060 
that I could just pull clean off like
this<00:01:21.509> and<00:01:22.850> this<00:01:23.850> piece<00:01:24.210> is<00:01:24.509> basically<00:01:25.470> a<00:01:25.710> top

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
this and this piece is basically a top

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.330 
this and this piece is basically a top
hatch<00:01:26.479> to<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.509> squid<00:01:27.869> got<00:01:28.080> as<00:01:28.290> dumb<00:01:29.189> as<00:01:29.220> it

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
hatch to the squid got as dumb as it

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.960 
hatch to the squid got as dumb as it
sounds<00:01:29.780> and<00:01:30.780> if<00:01:31.020> we<00:01:31.049> look<00:01:31.259> inside<00:01:31.470> here<00:01:32.280> you'll

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
sounds and if we look inside here you'll

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.230 
sounds and if we look inside here you'll
see<00:01:33.060> a<00:01:34.189> compartment<00:01:35.189> that<00:01:35.579> I<00:01:35.610> hollowed<00:01:36.119> out

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
see a compartment that I hollowed out

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.870 
see a compartment that I hollowed out
with<00:01:36.450> a<00:01:36.479> dremel<00:01:36.799> that<00:01:37.799> I<00:01:37.829> have<00:01:38.070> placed<00:01:38.430> all<00:01:38.759> of

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
with a dremel that I have placed all of

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.600 
with a dremel that I have placed all of
the<00:01:39.270> circuitry<00:01:40.229> and<00:01:40.350> batteries<00:01:41.100> and<00:01:41.369> power

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
the circuitry and batteries and power

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.270 
the circuitry and batteries and power
that<00:01:42.380> take<00:01:43.380> care<00:01:43.649> of<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:43.829> speaker<00:01:44.250> and

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
that take care of the speaker and

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.770 
that take care of the speaker and
amplify<00:01:44.820> and<00:01:45.630> amplify<00:01:46.110> it<00:01:46.170> basically<00:01:47.780> right

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
amplify and amplify it basically right

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.020 
amplify and amplify it basically right
now<00:01:48.810> this<00:01:49.560> little<00:01:49.770> stereo<00:01:50.280> thing<00:01:50.549> is<00:01:50.729> coming

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
now this little stereo thing is coming

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.819 
now this little stereo thing is coming
out<00:01:51.180> of<00:01:51.210> here<00:01:51.479> but<00:01:52.140> it<00:01:52.229> will<00:01:52.350> hopefully<00:01:52.470> be

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
out of here but it will hopefully be

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.060 
out of here but it will hopefully be
getting<00:01:53.100> replaced<00:01:53.460> soon<00:01:54.110> by<00:01:55.110> an<00:01:55.500> FM<00:01:55.860> radio

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
getting replaced soon by an FM radio

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.179 
getting replaced soon by an FM radio
tuner<00:01:56.930> which<00:01:57.930> will<00:01:58.170> allow<00:01:58.259> me<00:01:58.530> to<00:01:58.619> play<00:01:58.740> music

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
tuner which will allow me to play music

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.859 
tuner which will allow me to play music
right<00:01:59.369> for<00:01:59.610> my<00:01:59.729> ipod<00:02:00.060> in<00:02:00.270> my<00:02:00.360> pocket<00:02:00.780> without

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
right for my ipod in my pocket without

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.990 
right for my ipod in my pocket without
any<00:02:01.170> sort<00:02:01.409> of<00:02:01.500> extra<00:02:01.799> hookups<00:02:02.159> and<00:02:02.430> it'll<00:02:02.880> let

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
any sort of extra hookups and it'll let

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.950 
any sort of extra hookups and it'll let
me<00:02:03.149> keep<00:02:03.299> the<00:02:03.360> entire<00:02:03.750> thing<00:02:03.890> closed<00:02:04.890> up

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
me keep the entire thing closed up

what<00:02:07.950> I<00:02:07.979> did<00:02:08.660> and<00:02:09.660> let's<00:02:10.649> see<00:02:10.800> if<00:02:10.890> I<00:02:10.950> can<00:02:10.979> just

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
what I did and let's see if I can just

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.010 
what I did and let's see if I can just
open<00:02:11.819> this<00:02:11.940> up<00:02:12.000> for<00:02:12.390> you<00:02:12.480> all<00:02:12.600> to<00:02:12.720> get<00:02:12.810> a<00:02:12.870> better

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
open this up for you all to get a better

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.790 
open this up for you all to get a better
look<00:02:13.880> you'll<00:02:14.880> see<00:02:15.120> that<00:02:15.270> I've<00:02:15.390> got<00:02:15.420> two<00:02:15.930> nails

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
look you'll see that I've got two nails

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.080 
look you'll see that I've got two nails
in<00:02:17.220> there<00:02:17.550> acting<00:02:17.970> is<00:02:18.090> pins<00:02:19.790> they<00:02:20.790> actually

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
in there acting is pins they actually

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.160 
in there acting is pins they actually
hold<00:02:21.240> the<00:02:21.360> thing<00:02:21.480> together<00:02:21.660> pretty<00:02:22.050> well

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
hold the thing together pretty well

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.140 
hold the thing together pretty well
although<00:02:22.500> i<00:02:22.680> plan<00:02:23.040> on<00:02:23.069> gluing<00:02:23.610> it<00:02:23.640> along<00:02:24.000> this

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
although i plan on gluing it along this

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.729 
although i plan on gluing it along this
whole<00:02:24.330> seam<00:02:24.660> when<00:02:24.900> I'm<00:02:24.989> good<00:02:25.230> and<00:02:25.260> done<00:02:25.530> and

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
whole seam when I'm good and done and

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:28.460 
whole seam when I'm good and done and
green<00:02:26.310> stuff<00:02:26.550> in<00:02:26.730> the<00:02:26.819> gap<00:02:26.970> between<00:02:27.209> here<00:02:27.660> but

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
green stuff in the gap between here but

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:29.900 
green stuff in the gap between here but
let's<00:02:28.650> just<00:02:28.739> pull<00:02:29.010> this<00:02:29.130> apart<00:02:29.310> for<00:02:29.670> a<00:02:29.700> moment

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
let's just pull this apart for a moment

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.580 
let's just pull this apart for a moment
so<00:02:30.150> you<00:02:30.209> can<00:02:30.300> get<00:02:30.480> a<00:02:30.540> better<00:02:30.750> look<00:02:30.840> and<00:02:32.209> this<00:02:33.209> is

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
so you can get a better look and this is

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.949 
so you can get a better look and this is
the<00:02:34.590> entirety<00:02:35.190> of<00:02:35.220> what's<00:02:35.489> inside<00:02:35.810> you<00:02:36.810> have

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
the entirety of what's inside you have

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.440 
the entirety of what's inside you have
this<00:02:37.140> little<00:02:37.410> circuit<00:02:37.860> thing<00:02:38.150> which<00:02:39.150> I

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
this little circuit thing which I

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.600 
this little circuit thing which I
cannibalize<00:02:40.230> is<00:02:40.440> out<00:02:40.560> of<00:02:40.590> a<00:02:40.709> cheap<00:02:40.920> i<00:02:41.070> pair<00:02:41.519> of

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
cannibalize is out of a cheap i pair of

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.600 
cannibalize is out of a cheap i pair of
ipod<00:02:41.760> speakers<00:02:42.510> and<00:02:42.920> let's<00:02:43.920> turn<00:02:44.070> this<00:02:44.220> off<00:02:44.430> to

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
ipod speakers and let's turn this off to

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.759 
ipod speakers and let's turn this off to
save<00:02:44.760> some<00:02:44.940> battery<00:02:45.269> power<00:02:45.510> as<00:02:45.660> well<00:02:45.720> and<00:02:46.230> you

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
save some battery power as well and you

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:48.650 
save some battery power as well and you
can<00:02:46.800> pull<00:02:47.100> this<00:02:47.220> right<00:02:47.459> out<00:02:47.489> of<00:02:47.730> here<00:02:48.030> it<00:02:48.420> goes

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
can pull this right out of here it goes

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.060 
can pull this right out of here it goes
through<00:02:48.959> and<00:02:49.110> it<00:02:49.350> goes<00:02:49.650> in<00:02:49.800> through<00:02:49.920> the<00:02:50.040> top

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
through and it goes in through the top

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.910 
through and it goes in through the top
as<00:02:50.400> well<00:02:50.580> and<00:02:50.850> I've<00:02:51.600> just<00:02:51.630> got<00:02:51.930> it<00:02:52.080> roughly

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
as well and I've just got it roughly

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.770 
as well and I've just got it roughly
wired<00:02:53.160> into<00:02:53.670> the<00:02:53.790> speaker<00:02:54.180> that<00:02:54.360> you<00:02:54.450> can<00:02:54.570> see

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
wired into the speaker that you can see

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.900 
wired into the speaker that you can see
coming<00:02:55.110> in<00:02:55.230> through<00:02:55.410> the<00:02:55.440> mouth<00:02:55.709> here<00:02:55.950> and<00:02:56.160> the

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
coming in through the mouth here and the

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.470 
coming in through the mouth here and the
head<00:02:57.060> still<00:02:57.330> does<00:02:57.540> come<00:02:57.720> off<00:02:58.489> like<00:02:59.489> this<00:03:00.150> and

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
head still does come off like this and

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.680 
head still does come off like this and
you<00:03:01.320> can<00:03:01.350> get<00:03:01.590> a<00:03:01.620> look<00:03:01.800> at<00:03:01.890> the<00:03:01.980> speaker<00:03:02.690> so

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
you can get a look at the speaker so

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.449 
you can get a look at the speaker so
really<00:03:03.989> it<00:03:04.080> all<00:03:04.170> breaks<00:03:04.380> down<00:03:04.590> into<00:03:04.980> a<00:03:05.069> number

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
really it all breaks down into a number

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.170 
really it all breaks down into a number
of<00:03:05.580> parts<00:03:05.940> and<00:03:06.739> it<00:03:07.739> all<00:03:07.920> goes<00:03:08.130> together<00:03:08.400> just

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
of parts and it all goes together just

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.240 
of parts and it all goes together just
as<00:03:09.360> well<00:03:09.569> I<00:03:09.840> actually<00:03:10.380> had<00:03:10.769> the<00:03:10.890> trial<00:03:11.160> and

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
as well I actually had the trial and

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:12.650 
as well I actually had the trial and
error<00:03:11.459> some<00:03:11.670> of<00:03:11.760> these<00:03:11.850> holes<00:03:12.090> for<00:03:12.360> the<00:03:12.390> pins

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
error some of these holes for the pins

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.960 
error some of these holes for the pins
but<00:03:13.470> once<00:03:13.709> I<00:03:13.829> got<00:03:13.860> them<00:03:14.130> lined<00:03:14.340> up<00:03:14.489> just<00:03:14.549> right

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
but once I got them lined up just right

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:20.239 
but once I got them lined up just right
I<00:03:15.560> was<00:03:16.560> very<00:03:16.890> happy<00:03:17.280> with<00:03:17.549> how<00:03:17.700> it<00:03:17.820> turned<00:03:17.850> out
