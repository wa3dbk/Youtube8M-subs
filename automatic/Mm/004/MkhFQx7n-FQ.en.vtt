00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
and then also lip here so three

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:27.520 
and then also lip here so three
different<00:02:26.570> chambers<00:02:26.720> there's<00:02:27.080> chamber<00:02:27.350> one

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
different chambers there's chamber one

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.040 
different chambers there's chamber one
down<00:02:27.950> here<00:02:28.330> chamber<00:02:29.330> 2<00:02:29.480> is<00:02:29.570> going<00:02:29.690> to<00:02:29.750> be<00:02:29.840> all

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
down here chamber 2 is going to be all

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.530 
down here chamber 2 is going to be all
over<00:02:30.500> here<00:02:30.770> and<00:02:31.400> then<00:02:31.610> chamber<00:02:31.910> 3<00:02:32.150> is<00:02:32.270> right

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
over here and then chamber 3 is right

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.080 
over here and then chamber 3 is right
here<00:02:32.750> and<00:02:32.990> they're<00:02:33.110> all<00:02:33.520> pretty<00:02:34.520> well<00:02:34.730> sealed

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
here and they're all pretty well sealed

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.210 
here and they're all pretty well sealed
off<00:02:35.470> so<00:02:36.470> it<00:02:36.680> should<00:02:36.830> be<00:02:36.860> pretty<00:02:36.980> interesting

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
off so it should be pretty interesting

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.450 
off so it should be pretty interesting
case<00:02:38.090> with<00:02:38.270> some<00:02:38.390> nice<00:02:38.570> airflow<00:02:39.500> options-

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:40.460 
case with some nice airflow options-

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:41.500 
case with some nice airflow options-
think<00:02:40.670> i<00:02:40.700> wanna<00:02:40.820> mention<00:02:40.910> we<00:02:41.090> do<00:02:41.180> have<00:02:41.300> four

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
think i wanna mention we do have four

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.690 
think i wanna mention we do have four
USB<00:02:41.780> three<00:02:42.080> right<00:02:42.290> here<00:02:42.320> on<00:02:42.560> the<00:02:42.650> top<00:02:42.800> that

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
USB three right here on the top that

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.060 
USB three right here on the top that
should<00:02:43.850> pretty<00:02:43.940> much<00:02:44.090> sum<00:02:44.330> it<00:02:44.420> up<00:02:44.480> and<00:02:45.050> s10<00:02:45.890> and

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
should pretty much sum it up and s10 and

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:49.490 
should pretty much sum it up and s10 and
manta

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.460 

this<00:02:50.280> is<00:02:50.670> the<00:02:50.790> me<00:02:51.000> onyx<00:02:51.300> cast<00:02:51.570> or<00:02:51.780> so<00:02:52.230> there<00:02:52.380> it

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
this is the me onyx cast or so there it

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.530 
this is the me onyx cast or so there it
is<00:02:52.560> beside<00:02:53.010> the<00:02:53.040> nails<00:02:53.310> and<00:02:53.670> as<00:02:54.270> you<00:02:54.390> can<00:02:54.510> see

is beside the nails and as you can see

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.600 
is beside the nails and as you can see
it's<00:02:54.720> slightly<00:02:55.020> smaller<00:02:55.410> and<00:02:55.740> it's<00:02:56.310> meant<00:02:56.550> to

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
it's slightly smaller and it's meant to

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.610 
it's slightly smaller and it's meant to
be<00:02:56.640> somewhere<00:02:57.060> between<00:02:57.180> Tom<00:02:57.750> and<00:02:57.780> claw<00:02:58.410> grip

be somewhere between Tom and claw grip
but<00:02:59.010> you<00:02:59.100> can<00:02:59.220> actually<00:02:59.340> use<00:02:59.610> both<00:02:59.820> with<00:03:00.030> it<00:03:00.150> so

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
but you can actually use both with it so

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.680 
but you can actually use both with it so
here's<00:03:00.810> my<00:03:00.870> hand<00:03:01.140> or<00:03:01.590> canes<00:03:02.160> and<00:03:02.540> we<00:03:03.540> have<00:03:03.660> a

here's my hand or canes and we have a
dpi<00:03:04.200> adjustment<00:03:04.710> right<00:03:04.860> there<00:03:05.010> but<00:03:05.190> this<00:03:05.370> can

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
dpi adjustment right there but this can

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.490 
dpi adjustment right there but this can
be<00:03:05.640> mapped<00:03:05.850> and<00:03:06.720> then<00:03:06.840> we<00:03:06.930> have<00:03:07.020> our<00:03:07.140> scroll

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
be mapped and then we have our scroll

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.320 
be mapped and then we have our scroll
feels<00:03:08.010> nice<00:03:08.220> all<00:03:08.760> right<00:03:08.850> on<00:03:08.970> the<00:03:09.030> side<00:03:09.209> there

you can use them for forward and back or
you<00:03:13.170> can<00:03:13.290> remap<00:03:13.590> them<00:03:13.800> and<00:03:14.280> also<00:03:15.090> there<00:03:15.270> is<00:03:15.300> an

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
you can remap them and also there is an

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.180 
you can remap them and also there is an
interesting<00:03:15.990> texture<00:03:16.410> here<00:03:16.680> on<00:03:16.800> the<00:03:16.890> side<00:03:17.040> so

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
interesting texture here on the side so

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:18.410 
interesting texture here on the side so
the<00:03:17.280> entire<00:03:17.550> mouse<00:03:17.820> has<00:03:18.030> a<00:03:18.060> rubberized

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
the entire mouse has a rubberized

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.480 
the entire mouse has a rubberized
coating<00:03:18.810> nice<00:03:19.680> and<00:03:19.860> soft<00:03:20.040> it's<00:03:20.220> what<00:03:20.310> I<00:03:20.340> mean

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:20.490 
coating nice and soft it's what I mean

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:21.949 
coating nice and soft it's what I mean
it's<00:03:20.610> me<00:03:20.730> onyx<00:03:21.000> I<00:03:21.060> just<00:03:21.240> pick<00:03:21.540> it<00:03:21.570> up<00:03:21.720> and<00:03:21.870> it's

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
it's me onyx I just pick it up and it's

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:25.250 
it's me onyx I just pick it up and it's
like<00:03:22.110> you<00:03:22.830> feel<00:03:23.010> it<00:03:23.160> it's<00:03:23.280> a<00:03:23.340> meiotic<00:03:23.730> CS<00:03:24.260> this

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
like you feel it it's a meiotic CS this

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:26.930 
like you feel it it's a meiotic CS this
is<00:03:25.410> a<00:03:25.440> little<00:03:25.620> different<00:03:25.709> it's<00:03:26.310> sort<00:03:26.760> of<00:03:26.880> a

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
is a little different it's sort of a

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.150 
is a little different it's sort of a
grip<00:03:27.150> for<00:03:27.360> your<00:03:27.450> thumb<00:03:27.660> it's<00:03:28.590> a<00:03:28.620> nice<00:03:28.770> texture

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
grip for your thumb it's a nice texture

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.190 
grip for your thumb it's a nice texture
but<00:03:29.430> it's<00:03:29.580> not<00:03:29.850> distracting<00:03:30.090> when<00:03:30.840> I<00:03:30.870> head<00:03:31.050> in

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
but it's not distracting when I head in

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.770 
but it's not distracting when I head in
my<00:03:31.290> hands<00:03:31.470> it<00:03:31.620> was<00:03:31.709> um<00:03:31.950> it's<00:03:32.670> still<00:03:33.000> soft<00:03:33.270> but

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
my hands it was um it's still soft but

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.270 
my hands it was um it's still soft but
it<00:03:33.870> adds<00:03:33.989> a<00:03:34.110> little<00:03:34.200> grip<00:03:34.470> and<00:03:34.650> so<00:03:34.709> I<00:03:34.800> kind<00:03:35.250> of

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
it adds a little grip and so I kind of

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.770 
it adds a little grip and so I kind of
like<00:03:35.400> that<00:03:35.610> and<00:03:36.090> the<00:03:36.150> bottom<00:03:36.390> there<00:03:36.540> we<00:03:36.630> see

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
like that and the bottom there we see

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.210 
like that and the bottom there we see
are<00:03:36.930> probably<00:03:37.440> took<00:03:37.530> the<00:03:37.650> floor<00:03:37.800> ethylene

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
are probably took the floor ethylene

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.070 
are probably took the floor ethylene
feet<00:03:38.489> just<00:03:38.700> two<00:03:39.239> big<00:03:39.420> ones<00:03:39.540> one<00:03:39.750> on<00:03:39.840> the<00:03:39.900> top

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
feet just two big ones one on the top

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.930 
feet just two big ones one on the top
and<00:03:40.200> one<00:03:40.320> on<00:03:40.350> the<00:03:40.410> bottom<00:03:40.470> and<00:03:41.160> right<00:03:41.640> there

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
and one on the bottom and right there

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.290 
and one on the bottom and right there
inside<00:03:42.600> there<00:03:42.959> is<00:03:43.440> the<00:03:44.100> pic<00:03:44.580> start<00:03:44.790> that's<00:03:45.120> the

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:45.300 
inside there is the pic start that's the

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.860 
inside there is the pic start that's the
3310<00:03:46.370> infrared<00:03:47.370> sensor<00:03:47.790> and<00:03:47.970> they've

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
3310 infrared sensor and they've

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.630 
3310 infrared sensor and they've
actually<00:03:49.080> used<00:03:49.560> the<00:03:49.739> ARM<00:03:49.890> processor<00:03:50.489> on<00:03:50.610> the

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
actually used the ARM processor on the

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.000 
actually used the ARM processor on the
inside<00:03:50.730> to<00:03:51.150> sort<00:03:51.360> of<00:03:51.420> overclock<00:03:51.840> this<00:03:52.050> and<00:03:52.860> it

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
inside to sort of overclock this and it

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.860 
inside to sort of overclock this and it
will<00:03:53.040> go<00:03:53.190> all<00:03:53.310> the<00:03:53.340> way<00:03:53.459> up<00:03:53.610> to<00:03:53.640> 10,000<00:03:54.510> dpi<00:03:54.750> you

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
will go all the way up to 10,000 dpi you

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.180 
will go all the way up to 10,000 dpi you
probably<00:03:55.170> don't<00:03:55.350> need<00:03:55.440> that<00:03:55.590> much<00:03:55.799> but<00:03:56.010> you

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
probably don't need that much but you

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.460 
probably don't need that much but you
know<00:03:56.280> what<00:03:56.540> now<00:03:57.540> it's<00:03:57.720> going<00:03:57.810> to<00:03:57.870> go<00:03:57.959> to<00:03:58.019> 10,000

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
know what now it's going to go to 10,000

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:59.870 
know what now it's going to go to 10,000
even<00:03:58.620> if<00:03:58.709> you<00:03:58.769> want<00:03:58.920> it<00:03:58.980> or<00:03:59.100> not<00:03:59.160> most<00:03:59.640> people

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
even if you want it or not most people

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.820 
even if you want it or not most people
going<00:04:00.000> to<00:04:00.030> play<00:04:00.150> around<00:04:00.410> 2,000<00:04:01.410> 3,000

going to play around 2,000 3,000

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:04.009 
going to play around 2,000 3,000
whatever<00:04:02.120> let's<00:04:03.120> just<00:04:03.180> slide<00:04:03.450> this<00:04:03.570> aside<00:04:03.870> we

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 
whatever let's just slide this aside we

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:05.060 
whatever let's just slide this aside we
got<00:04:04.110> the<00:04:04.200> braided<00:04:04.440> cable<00:04:04.680> they<00:04:04.769> don't<00:04:04.890> want<00:04:05.010> to

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.070 
got the braided cable they don't want to

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:07.280 
got the braided cable they don't want to
forget<00:04:05.160> that<00:04:05.400> slide<00:04:06.239> aside<00:04:06.360> and<00:04:06.660> then<00:04:06.810> came

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
forget that slide aside and then came

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:08.750 
forget that slide aside and then came
the<00:04:07.320> Sun<00:04:07.590> boxes<00:04:07.950> thing<00:04:08.130> did<00:04:08.280> we<00:04:08.370> get<00:04:08.489> a<00:04:08.610> show

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
the Sun boxes thing did we get a show

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:09.530 
the Sun boxes thing did we get a show
you<00:04:08.820> guys<00:04:08.970> what<00:04:09.150> it's<00:04:09.239> going<00:04:09.330> to<00:04:09.390> look<00:04:09.450> like

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
you guys what it's going to look like

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.509 
you guys what it's going to look like
they<00:04:10.049> also<00:04:10.230> said<00:04:10.470> this<00:04:10.560> is<00:04:10.650> a<00:04:10.680> prototype<00:04:10.890> the

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 
they also said this is a prototype the

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:12.410 
they also said this is a prototype the
logo<00:04:11.730> is<00:04:11.850> going<00:04:11.970> to<00:04:12.030> move<00:04:12.120> a<00:04:12.209> little<00:04:12.299> bit

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
logo is going to move a little bit

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:13.729 
logo is going to move a little bit
farther<00:04:12.690> to<00:04:12.959> the<00:04:12.989> back<00:04:13.230> and<00:04:13.410> that<00:04:13.470> sort<00:04:13.709> of

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
farther to the back and that sort of

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:16.849 
farther to the back and that sort of
thing<00:04:13.799> but<00:04:14.090> here<00:04:15.090> we<00:04:15.180> are<00:04:15.209> the<00:04:15.450> case<00:04:15.859> they've

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
thing but here we are the case they've

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:18.380 
thing but here we are the case they've
actually<00:04:17.010> done<00:04:17.430> a<00:04:17.760> few<00:04:17.910> different<00:04:18.359> things

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:18.390 
actually done a few different things

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:20.060 
actually done a few different things
look<00:04:18.959> on<00:04:19.049> the<00:04:19.140> outside<00:04:19.169> first<00:04:19.590> of<00:04:19.799> the<00:04:19.919> case

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
look on the outside first of the case

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.860 
look on the outside first of the case
you'll<00:04:20.280> notice<00:04:20.519> that<00:04:20.549> there's<00:04:20.790> not<00:04:21.630> a<00:04:21.690> lot<00:04:21.840> of

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
you'll notice that there's not a lot of

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.320 
you'll notice that there's not a lot of
nonsense<00:04:22.109> not<00:04:22.530> a<00:04:22.560> lot<00:04:22.740> of<00:04:22.770> holy<00:04:22.979> crap<00:04:23.610> 10,000

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
nonsense not a lot of holy crap 10,000

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.080 
nonsense not a lot of holy crap 10,000
DP<00:04:25.110> is<00:04:25.229> just<00:04:25.680> you<00:04:25.770> know<00:04:25.890> me<00:04:26.100> onyx<00:04:26.370> open<00:04:26.820> up<00:04:26.880> and

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
DP is just you know me onyx open up and

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.719 
DP is just you know me onyx open up and
let's<00:04:27.479> take<00:04:27.600> a<00:04:27.660> look<00:04:27.830> they're<00:04:28.830> going<00:04:29.490> on<00:04:29.610> about

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:29.729 
let's take a look they're going on about

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:32.469 
let's take a look they're going on about
the<00:04:29.850> craftsmanship<00:04:30.240> rules<00:04:30.510> look<00:04:30.750> at<00:04:30.840> that

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:32.479 
the craftsmanship rules look at that

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:36.909 
the craftsmanship rules look at that
that<00:04:33.479> is<00:04:33.600> fancy<00:04:34.050> so<00:04:34.710> what<00:04:35.550> they<00:04:35.669> did<00:04:35.850> here<00:04:36.060> was

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:36.919 
that is fancy so what they did here was

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:40.219 
that is fancy so what they did here was
they<00:04:37.919> try<00:04:38.669> to<00:04:38.729> find<00:04:39.030> the<00:04:39.240> right<00:04:39.810> type<00:04:40.110> of

00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:40.229 
they try to find the right type of
