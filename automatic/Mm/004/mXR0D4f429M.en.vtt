amp<00:07:12.470> I've<00:07:13.470> got<00:07:13.620> the<00:07:13.680> speaker<00:07:13.979> out<00:07:14.250> here<00:07:14.550> pretty

00:07:14.839 --> 00:07:14.849 
amp I've got the speaker out here pretty

00:07:14.849 --> 00:07:16.670 
amp I've got the speaker out here pretty
standard<00:07:15.270> stuff<00:07:15.539> and<00:07:15.840> then<00:07:16.349> we've<00:07:16.470> got<00:07:16.650> a

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:16.680 
standard stuff and then we've got a

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:18.439 
standard stuff and then we've got a
really<00:07:16.919> cool<00:07:17.130> feature<00:07:17.370> they<00:07:17.789> record<00:07:18.180> out

00:07:18.439 --> 00:07:18.449 
really cool feature they record out

00:07:18.449 --> 00:07:21.640 
really cool feature they record out
which<00:07:19.319> basically<00:07:20.130> is<00:07:20.310> a<00:07:20.340> speaker<00:07:20.789> emulated

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:21.650 
which basically is a speaker emulated

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:25.070 
which basically is a speaker emulated
recording<00:07:22.650> out<00:07:23.270> function<00:07:24.270> and<00:07:24.569> it<00:07:24.750> lets<00:07:24.960> you

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:25.080 
recording out function and it lets you

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:27.110 
recording out function and it lets you
basically<00:07:25.199> go<00:07:25.740> either<00:07:25.889> into<00:07:26.159> a<00:07:26.250> PA<00:07:26.460> system<00:07:26.550> or

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:27.120 
basically go either into a PA system or

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:30.710 
basically go either into a PA system or
recording<00:07:27.630> equipment<00:07:28.139> and<00:07:29.389> also<00:07:30.389> it's<00:07:30.509> not<00:07:30.659> a

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:30.720 
recording equipment and also it's not a

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:32.839 
recording equipment and also it's not a
silent<00:07:31.050> by<00:07:31.830> now<00:07:32.009> so<00:07:32.250> you<00:07:32.340> can<00:07:32.490> still<00:07:32.699> hear

00:07:32.839 --> 00:07:32.849 
silent by now so you can still hear

00:07:32.849 --> 00:07:34.159 
silent by now so you can still hear
yourself<00:07:33.180> coming<00:07:33.389> through<00:07:33.539> the<00:07:33.599> speakers<00:07:33.990> so

00:07:34.159 --> 00:07:34.169 
yourself coming through the speakers so

00:07:34.169 --> 00:07:35.600 
yourself coming through the speakers so
like<00:07:34.320> if<00:07:34.440> you're<00:07:34.530> playing<00:07:34.560> a<00:07:34.800> live<00:07:34.979> show<00:07:35.280> and

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:35.610 
like if you're playing a live show and

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:37.100 
like if you're playing a live show and
you<00:07:36.060> just<00:07:36.210> can't<00:07:36.419> get<00:07:36.509> a<00:07:36.539> good<00:07:36.690> sound<00:07:36.900> to<00:07:36.960> the

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:37.110 
you just can't get a good sound to the

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:38.629 
you just can't get a good sound to the
microphone<00:07:37.560> plug<00:07:37.860> this<00:07:37.979> right<00:07:38.039> into<00:07:38.340> the<00:07:38.460> PA

00:07:38.629 --> 00:07:38.639 
microphone plug this right into the PA

00:07:38.639 --> 00:07:40.189 
microphone plug this right into the PA
system<00:07:38.759> and<00:07:39.270> you<00:07:39.389> can<00:07:39.509> still<00:07:39.719> hear<00:07:39.840> yourself

00:07:40.189 --> 00:07:40.199 
system and you can still hear yourself

00:07:40.199 --> 00:07:41.540 
system and you can still hear yourself
on<00:07:40.349> stage<00:07:40.620> while<00:07:40.800> getting<00:07:40.979> a<00:07:41.099> really<00:07:41.370> good

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:41.550 
on stage while getting a really good

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:43.700 
on stage while getting a really good
tone<00:07:41.789> out<00:07:41.969> of<00:07:42.000> the<00:07:42.090> PA<00:07:42.300> also<00:07:43.080> for<00:07:43.199> recording<00:07:43.590> -
