into<00:00:38.969> my<00:00:39.120> scalp<00:00:39.480> and<00:00:39.780> then<00:00:40.200> let<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.770> rest<00:00:40.800> of

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
into my scalp and then let the rest of

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.020 
into my scalp and then let the rest of
the<00:00:41.489> shampoo<00:00:41.969> just<00:00:42.660> rinse<00:00:43.500> down<00:00:43.860> my<00:00:44.250> hair<00:00:44.579> so<00:00:45.000> I

so for me because my hair is so long I
have<00:02:14.970> to<00:02:15.120> use<00:02:15.300> smaller<00:02:15.690> sections<00:02:16.350> in<00:02:16.560> order<00:02:16.650> to

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
have to use smaller sections in order to

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.130 
have to use smaller sections in order to
make<00:02:17.040> sure<00:02:17.070> that<00:02:17.610> my<00:02:18.090> hair<00:02:18.330> doesn't<00:02:18.720> require

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
make sure that my hair doesn't require

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.350 
make sure that my hair doesn't require
me<00:02:19.410> to<00:02:19.440> sit<00:02:19.739> under<00:02:20.100> a<00:02:20.130> hooded<00:02:20.489> dryer<00:02:20.610> for<00:02:21.030> six

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
hours for all of my hair to dry so I use

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.420 
hours for all of my hair to dry so I use
smaller<00:02:24.600> sections<00:02:25.200> and<00:02:25.470> also<00:02:25.650> this<00:02:25.980> helps

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
smaller sections and also this helps

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.699 
smaller sections and also this helps
with<00:02:26.610> just<00:02:27.180> maintaining<00:02:27.780> a<00:02:27.930> more<00:02:28.140> uniform

completely dries in the rods that's the
worst<00:02:41.370> thing<00:02:41.730> to<00:02:41.760> do<00:02:42.060> is<00:02:42.540> to<00:02:42.780> take<00:02:42.959> out<00:02:43.110> your
