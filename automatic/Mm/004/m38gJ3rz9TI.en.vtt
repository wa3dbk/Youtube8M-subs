00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:18.710
 for now, evolution, soccer 2010, the main changes come evolution 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.939
 only that the 2010 are felt within the four lines 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:28.289
 graphic promoters has been absurdly improved and the modeling and textures of 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.329
 players are better than ever in the series 

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:35.820
 mayors are much more elaborate and help 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.820
 more realistic matches 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.150
 look that 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.760
 in this 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.760
 awakening 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.710
 the animations still close by strange movements and breaking was 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.720
 empty fathers day are more solid 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:08.940
 in general the whole of the work I took slightly higher than the one seen at parties 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:09.920
 of s 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:15.060
 mainly because of the greater politeness in animations and if they are not interactive 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.790
 during matches such as the stylist's entries when marking fouls and 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.700
 similar to controls of what is experienced and the uncertainty of conab 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.970
 who will stay in the gold version some details search regular flight the two 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.090
 endpoints dealing with players but spoiling aspects that looked like 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:36.280
 seated 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.480
 pro-revolution 2010 has a faster pace than the 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:45.880
 and the handling and handling of the ball was more complicated. 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.430
 in the same way as in the latter aspect, fifa 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:55.170
 almost existed days also require more accuracy and skill once again than 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.140
 if you learn to deal with them there is efficacy is greater than in the version 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:05.399
 2009, while such adjustments make the bouts more intense and balanced 

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:29.399
 it's the hardest to create plays on the floor and dribble forcing plays 

00:02:29.399 --> 00:02:33.929
 on the side the improvements over the last version are few but the 

00:02:33.929 --> 00:02:38.929
 enough to make crosses and sidelines and aerial balls more options 

00:02:38.929 --> 00:02:43.769
 efficient and recurrent than normal at last artificial intelligence 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:45.510
 continued oscillating 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.489
 before the perceived faith an improvement in the movement of colleagues 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:50.479
 team says 

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:55.859
 however remain defects and old of the series undecided goalkeepers and little 

00:02:55.859 --> 00:03:01.029
 trusted wings that come by a command should advance signals 

00:03:01.029 --> 00:03:07.449
 online disputes and the old system that existed has been vastly improved. 

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:10.329
 registration on conab's website has been deleted 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:15.299
 adding everything but bureaucratic ball games the most viewed than in 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:20.709
 2009 version without so many light but again the level of general schooling 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:23.919
 not as tall as fifa 2010 

00:03:23.919 --> 00:03:27.699
 supported also by less and statistics that go to revolution and 

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:29.159
 only he does not have 

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:33.159
 as last year only Brazilian team present to the international of 

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:37.750
 gay port flanked by worldwide bags and vibrates the suit 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.860
 as teams representing South America 

00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:47.609
 the leagues of france italy and holland remain fully licensed spain 

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:51.469
 just partially and england only in liverpool in manchester 

00:03:51.469 --> 00:03:52.709
 united 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:57.449
 on the other hand, the councilman having the possibility of menus and narration in 

00:03:57.449 --> 00:04:00.449
 Portuguese from Portugal 

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:13.109
 the option should please and help many players but given that fifa 

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:15.169
 already has three of the translated air 

00:04:15.169 --> 00:04:19.310
 years and that the konami plan to produce a choice and commentary on the mission 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:21.449
 Brazilian and gave up the idea 

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:22.800
 ends up being little 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.800
 very little 

00:04:26.689 --> 00:04:31.360
 with the evolution of soccer 2010 is a version of the series quito in the disputes 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:36.899
 more balanced when printing rhythm of game more agile and demanding greater level 

00:04:36.899 --> 00:04:39.430
 ability to harmonize the ball 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:43.440
 although in its imbalance other points like the aerial moves 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:48.730
 the visual presents a considerable improvement but the game options 

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:53.180
 I'm a bit like all those accused with the book says caprice and varieties 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:57.880
 absurdly inferior to fifa only gave up fans of the series mechanics 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.900
 hardly become frustration 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.749
 the body to change to the competition 

00:05:02.749 --> 00:05:07.189
 in this aspect the provider or sense that he is very strong for him the with the 

00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:07.930
 rival 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:12.850
 but it is increasingly clear superiority of the electronics and hot 100 all others 

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:13.490
 questions
