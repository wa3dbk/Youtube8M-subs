a<00:00:13.580> key<00:00:13.849> animator<00:00:14.389> then<00:00:15.230> you'd<00:00:15.440> get<00:00:15.650> something

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:15.830 
a key animator then you'd get something

of today's productions your shots that

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:33.270 
of today's productions your shots that
you<00:00:31.490> would<00:00:31.610> receive<00:00:31.940> would<00:00:32.629> already<00:00:32.840> have

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:33.280 
you would receive would already have

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.759 
you would receive would already have
timing<00:00:34.280> set<00:00:34.579> to<00:00:34.760> them<00:00:35.260> the<00:00:36.260> thing<00:00:36.499> to

00:00:36.759 --> 00:00:36.769 
timing set to them the thing to

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:39.040 
timing set to them the thing to
understand<00:00:37.129> though<00:00:37.219> is<00:00:37.249> that<00:00:37.749> the<00:00:38.749> layout

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.050 
understand though is that the layout

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.099 
understand though is that the layout
timing<00:00:39.829> would<00:00:40.460> be<00:00:40.640> set<00:00:40.879> to<00:00:41.059> whatever<00:00:41.300> was<00:00:41.960> in

00:00:42.099 --> 00:00:42.109 
timing would be set to whatever was in

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:44.590 
timing would be set to whatever was in
the<00:00:42.199> story<00:00:42.499> reel<00:00:42.769> but<00:00:43.640> it's<00:00:44.120> really<00:00:44.390> the

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:44.600 
the story reel but it's really the

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.200 
the story reel but it's really the
animators<00:00:45.140> responsibility<00:00:46.039> to<00:00:46.730> figure<00:00:46.940> out

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210 
animators responsibility to figure out

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.989 
animators responsibility to figure out
the<00:00:47.359> timing<00:00:47.719> for<00:00:47.899> the<00:00:47.989> performances<00:00:48.620> so<00:00:48.999> what

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:49.999 
the timing for the performances so what

00:00:49.999 --> 00:00:52.360 
the timing for the performances so what
you<00:00:50.120> get<00:00:50.390> isn't<00:00:50.719> always<00:00:50.809> set<00:00:51.079> in<00:00:51.199> stone<00:00:51.440> now

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 
you get isn't always set in stone now

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.329 
you get isn't always set in stone now
part<00:00:52.699> of<00:00:52.819> doing<00:00:52.940> any<00:00:53.239> drawing<00:00:54.339> my

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:55.339 
part of doing any drawing my

00:00:55.339 --> 00:00:56.979 
part of doing any drawing my
recommendation<00:00:56.059> has<00:00:56.149> always<00:00:56.329> been<00:00:56.510> to<00:00:56.690> do<00:00:56.839> the

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
recommendation has always been to do the

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:59.619 
recommendation has always been to do the
timing<00:00:57.260> first<00:00:57.769> I<00:00:58.039> didn't<00:00:58.850> show<00:00:59.030> that<00:00:59.210> here

00:00:59.619 --> 00:00:59.629 
timing first I didn't show that here

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:02.529 
timing first I didn't show that here
just<00:00:59.809> to<00:01:00.739> save<00:01:00.979> on<00:01:01.190> time<00:01:01.429> and<00:01:01.879> probably<00:01:02.420> show

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:02.539 
just to save on time and probably show

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:05.229 
just to save on time and probably show
you<00:01:02.600> that<00:01:03.379> in<00:01:03.589> another<00:01:03.800> video<00:01:04.010> but<00:01:04.400> you<00:01:04.879> do<00:01:05.089> the

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:05.239 
you that in another video but you do the

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:07.060 
you that in another video but you do the
timing<00:01:05.479> first<00:01:05.960> and<00:01:06.290> the<00:01:06.470> reason<00:01:06.830> you<00:01:06.920> do<00:01:07.040> that

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
timing first and the reason you do that

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:08.560 
timing first and the reason you do that
is<00:01:07.220> because<00:01:07.460> it<00:01:07.700> gets<00:01:07.880> you<00:01:08.060> to<00:01:08.090> start<00:01:08.420> thinking

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
is because it gets you to start thinking

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.130 
is because it gets you to start thinking
ahead<00:01:08.840> about<00:01:09.350> what<00:01:09.950> you're<00:01:10.549> going<00:01:10.820> to<00:01:10.850> draw<00:01:11.240> in

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 
ahead about what you're going to draw in

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:13.959 
ahead about what you're going to draw in
terms<00:01:12.500> of<00:01:12.710> animation<00:01:13.100> I<00:01:13.490> mean<00:01:13.790> you're<00:01:13.880> already

00:01:13.959 --> 00:01:13.969 
terms of animation I mean you're already

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:15.249 
terms of animation I mean you're already
thinking<00:01:14.210> about<00:01:14.390> the<00:01:14.479> animation<00:01:14.899> the<00:01:15.020> moment

00:01:15.249 --> 00:01:15.259 
thinking about the animation the moment

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:17.289 
thinking about the animation the moment
you<00:01:15.320> start<00:01:15.530> plotting<00:01:15.680> down<00:01:15.979> your<00:01:16.159> arcs<00:01:16.460> and

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:17.299 
you start plotting down your arcs and

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:18.520 
you start plotting down your arcs and
trying<00:01:17.540> to<00:01:17.630> figure<00:01:17.840> out<00:01:17.869> what<00:01:18.049> do<00:01:18.200> I<00:01:18.229> want<00:01:18.469> to

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
trying to figure out what do I want to

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.080 
trying to figure out what do I want to
ease<00:01:18.680> it<00:01:18.890> out<00:01:19.009> of<00:01:19.130> this<00:01:19.250> so<00:01:19.369> I<00:01:19.430> want<00:01:19.640> to<00:01:19.759> you

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.219 
ease it out of this so I want to you
know<00:01:20.240> ease<00:01:20.780> into<00:01:21.469> you<00:01:22.130> know<00:01:22.219> another<00:01:22.399> pose<00:01:23.229> you

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
know ease into you know another pose you

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:27.010 
know ease into you know another pose you
will<00:01:24.439> have<00:01:24.560> you<00:01:24.860> know<00:01:24.890> a<00:01:25.479> smoother<00:01:26.479> arc<00:01:26.719> do<00:01:26.990> I

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
will have you know a smoother arc do I

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.480 
will have you know a smoother arc do I
wanna<00:01:27.200> have<00:01:27.289> a<00:01:27.350> quicker<00:01:27.619> you<00:01:28.009> know<00:01:28.039> range<00:01:28.369> of

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
wanna have a quicker you know range of

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.349 
wanna have a quicker you know range of
motion<00:01:28.850> and<00:01:29.420> all<00:01:29.570> that<00:01:29.780> and<00:01:30.710> again<00:01:31.549> the<00:01:31.850> prior

00:01:32.349 --> 00:01:32.359 
motion and all that and again the prior

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:36.760 
motion and all that and again the prior
to<00:01:32.630> to<00:01:33.469> drawing<00:01:34.189> anything<00:01:34.549> first<00:01:35.380> I've<00:01:36.380> always

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
to to drawing anything first I've always

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.069 
to to drawing anything first I've always
told<00:01:37.009> animators<00:01:37.700> you<00:01:38.180> know<00:01:38.299> whether<00:01:38.689> it<00:01:38.960> was

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:39.079 
told animators you know whether it was

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:42.219 
told animators you know whether it was
to<00:01:40.070> you<00:01:40.549> know<00:01:40.640> on<00:01:40.759> three<00:01:40.969> delivery<00:01:41.420> or<00:01:41.750> when<00:01:42.200> I

just work it out physically you know get

physical<00:02:01.759> level<00:02:02.090> you<00:02:02.659> know<00:02:02.749> you<00:02:02.810> can<00:02:03.049> feel<00:02:03.409> the

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
physical level you know you can feel the

physical level you know you can feel the

weight of a punch or even a walk or if
there's<00:02:07.369> a<00:02:07.460> character<00:02:08.030> you<00:02:08.720> know<00:02:08.780> acting<00:02:09.229> out

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
there's a character you know acting out

there's a character you know acting out
dialogue<00:02:09.860> you<00:02:10.310> know<00:02:10.340> you<00:02:10.490> get<00:02:11.270> to<00:02:11.300> understand

dialogue you know you get to understand

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.630 
dialogue you know you get to understand

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
well where is the or should it really

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.200 
well where is the or should it really
emphasize<00:02:15.740> the<00:02:16.740> acting<00:02:17.220> in<00:02:17.460> the<00:02:17.640> performance

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
emphasize the acting in the performance

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:21.800 
emphasize the acting in the performance
of<00:02:18.450> the<00:02:18.930> character<00:02:19.380> or<00:02:19.650> the<00:02:19.950> prop<00:02:20.220> even<00:02:20.810> and

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
of the character or the prop even and

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.480 
of the character or the prop even and
you<00:02:22.350> would<00:02:22.470> do<00:02:22.620> that<00:02:22.770> with<00:02:23.130> you<00:02:23.400> know

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
you would do that with you know

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.000 
you would do that with you know
stopwatch<00:02:24.120> or<00:02:24.390> if<00:02:25.200> you'd<00:02:25.380> want<00:02:25.680> to<00:02:25.740> record

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
stopwatch or if you'd want to record

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.480 
stopwatch or if you'd want to record
yourself<00:02:26.400> doing<00:02:26.580> that<00:02:26.790> and<00:02:27.060> you<00:02:27.150> can<00:02:28.310> you<00:02:29.310> can

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
yourself doing that and you can you can

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:32.360 
yourself doing that and you can you can
feel<00:02:29.790> the<00:02:30.390> nuances<00:02:30.990> that<00:02:31.350> are<00:02:31.620> taking<00:02:32.100> place

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
feel the nuances that are taking place

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.120 
feel the nuances that are taking place
and<00:02:32.670> that<00:02:33.270> is<00:02:33.570> what<00:02:33.840> helps<00:02:33.990> you<00:02:34.320> create<00:02:34.680> a<00:02:34.860> more

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
and that is what helps you create a more

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.480 
and that is what helps you create a more
believable<00:02:35.970> and<00:02:36.720> convincing<00:02:37.490> performance

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
believable and convincing performance

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.790 
believable and convincing performance
rather<00:02:39.300> than<00:02:39.540> just<00:02:39.870> you<00:02:40.080> know<00:02:40.200> going<00:02:40.410> straight

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
rather than just you know going straight

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.350 
rather than just you know going straight
ahead<00:02:40.890> from<00:02:41.220> the<00:02:41.490> pose<00:02:41.670> that's<00:02:41.880> been<00:02:42.090> given

ahead from the pose that's been given

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.490 
ahead from the pose that's been given
out<00:02:42.450> you<00:02:42.600> know<00:02:42.690> you<00:02:42.750> really<00:02:43.110> need<00:02:43.350> to<00:02:43.470> think

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
out you know you really need to think

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.550 
out you know you really need to think
ahead<00:02:43.770> about<00:02:44.250> what<00:02:45.210> you're<00:02:45.480> doing<00:02:45.840> and<00:02:45.990> then

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
ahead about what you're doing and then

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.030 
ahead about what you're doing and then
once<00:02:46.830> you<00:02:46.980> have<00:02:47.340> that<00:02:47.670> acting<00:02:48.480> a<00:02:48.780> you<00:02:49.710> know<00:02:49.800> in

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
once you have that acting a you know in

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.400 
once you have that acting a you know in
your<00:02:50.340> mind<00:02:50.400> you've<00:02:51.390> practiced<00:02:52.020> it<00:02:52.140> a<00:02:52.230> few

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
your mind you've practiced it a few

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.740 
your mind you've practiced it a few
times<00:02:52.590> and<00:02:53.070> you've<00:02:54.030> already<00:02:54.150> had<00:02:54.360> sort<00:02:54.630> of<00:02:54.690> a

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
times and you've already had sort of a

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.200 
times and you've already had sort of a
general<00:02:54.930> idea<00:02:55.170> of<00:02:55.470> how<00:02:55.530> that<00:02:56.400> you<00:02:56.700> want<00:02:57.000> the

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:57.210 
general idea of how that you want the

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:59.060 
general idea of how that you want the
timing<00:02:57.600> to<00:02:57.750> go<00:02:57.930> you<00:02:57.990> know<00:02:58.260> you're<00:02:58.710> going<00:02:58.860> back

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
timing to go you know you're going back

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.430 
timing to go you know you're going back
and<00:02:59.250> forth<00:02:59.490> a<00:02:59.610> lot<00:02:59.700> then<00:03:00.450> you<00:03:00.570> can<00:03:00.720> go<00:03:00.870> down<00:03:01.050> and

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
and forth a lot then you can go down and

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.380 
and forth a lot then you can go down and
start<00:03:01.710> yarding<00:03:01.890> out<00:03:02.160> you<00:03:02.430> know<00:03:02.520> drawing<00:03:03.210> down

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
start yarding out you know drawing down

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.150 
start yarding out you know drawing down
which<00:03:03.690> frames<00:03:03.990> are<00:03:04.200> going<00:03:04.230> to<00:03:04.470> you<00:03:04.770> are<00:03:04.800> going

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
which frames are going to you are going

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.330 
which frames are going to you are going
to<00:03:05.220> take<00:03:05.370> place<00:03:05.580> here<00:03:06.800> however<00:03:07.800> the<00:03:08.070> thing

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
to take place here however the thing

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.090 
to take place here however the thing
that<00:03:08.520> I've<00:03:08.760> come<00:03:09.120> to<00:03:09.150> realize<00:03:09.540> is<00:03:09.570> that<00:03:10.100> when

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
that I've come to realize is that when

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.310 
that I've come to realize is that when
you're<00:03:11.220> plotting<00:03:11.580> out<00:03:11.670> your<00:03:11.820> timing<00:03:12.240> and<00:03:13.080> your

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
you're plotting out your timing and your

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.380 
you're plotting out your timing and your
spacing<00:03:13.830> it's<00:03:14.580> not<00:03:14.760> always<00:03:14.910> going<00:03:15.240> to<00:03:15.300> be

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
spacing it's not always going to be

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.620 
spacing it's not always going to be
exactly<00:03:15.660> what<00:03:16.170> you<00:03:16.260> want<00:03:16.530> and<00:03:17.520> that's<00:03:18.000> okay<00:03:18.360> it

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
exactly what you want and that's okay it

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.680 
exactly what you want and that's okay it
the<00:03:19.590> key<00:03:19.830> process<00:03:20.670> of<00:03:20.880> animating<00:03:21.360> sort<00:03:21.600> of

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
the key process of animating sort of

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.630 
the key process of animating sort of
that<00:03:21.840> experimental<00:03:22.620> stage<00:03:22.860> you<00:03:23.370> know<00:03:23.460> that's

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
that experimental stage you know that's

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.270 
that experimental stage you know that's
where<00:03:23.790> you<00:03:23.880> can<00:03:24.000> really<00:03:24.180> have<00:03:24.360> some<00:03:24.390> fun

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
where you can really have some fun

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.170 
where you can really have some fun
animating<00:03:26.280> it<00:03:26.460> is<00:03:26.580> you<00:03:26.760> know<00:03:26.820> you're<00:03:27.000> trying

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
animating it is you know you're trying

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.880 
animating it is you know you're trying
out<00:03:27.420> new<00:03:27.660> things<00:03:27.840> you<00:03:28.320> know<00:03:28.350> after<00:03:28.740> you've

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
out new things you know after you've

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.580 
out new things you know after you've
performed<00:03:29.430> stuff<00:03:29.970> out<00:03:30.180> and<00:03:30.480> you<00:03:31.350> know<00:03:31.440> you've

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
performed stuff out and you know you've

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.070 
performed stuff out and you know you've
already<00:03:31.830> you've<00:03:32.490> set<00:03:32.730> your<00:03:32.820> time<00:03:33.060> chart<00:03:33.420> you

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
already you've set your time chart you

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.560 
already you've set your time chart you
know<00:03:34.170> and<00:03:34.500> maybe<00:03:34.680> you<00:03:35.070> know<00:03:35.330> certain<00:03:36.330> things

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
know and maybe you know certain things

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.180 
know and maybe you know certain things
can<00:03:36.780> move<00:03:36.900> a<00:03:37.020> lot<00:03:37.170> faster<00:03:37.200> or<00:03:37.800> things<00:03:38.010> could

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
can move a lot faster or things could

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.760 
can move a lot faster or things could
slow<00:03:38.640> down<00:03:38.850> a<00:03:38.880> bit<00:03:39.200> that's<00:03:40.200> where<00:03:40.380> you<00:03:40.470> get<00:03:40.620> to

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:40.770 
slow down a bit that's where you get to

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:42.200 
slow down a bit that's where you get to
really<00:03:40.800> play<00:03:41.160> around<00:03:41.190> with<00:03:41.550> the<00:03:41.730> with<00:03:42.120> the

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:42.210 
really play around with the with the

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:45.290 
really play around with the with the
range<00:03:42.420> of<00:03:42.510> motion<00:03:42.830> so<00:03:44.000> what<00:03:45.000> I've<00:03:45.090> done<00:03:45.240> here

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:45.300 
range of motion so what I've done here

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:47.540 
range of motion so what I've done here
is<00:03:45.600> I've<00:03:46.140> already<00:03:46.350> acted<00:03:46.830> out<00:03:46.950> you<00:03:47.100> know<00:03:47.220> the

is I've already acted out you know the
hand<00:03:47.790> opening<00:03:48.180> up<00:03:48.330> and<00:03:48.630> with<00:03:49.170> my<00:03:49.320> stopwatch

hand opening up and with my stopwatch
you<00:03:49.980> know<00:03:50.070> I<00:03:50.100> click<00:03:50.610> at<00:03:50.760> random<00:03:51.090> parts<00:03:51.390> to<00:03:51.480> see

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
you know I click at random parts to see

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.200 
you know I click at random parts to see
where<00:03:51.960> is<00:03:52.200> most<00:03:52.860> changing<00:03:53.280> or<00:03:53.430> I'd<00:03:53.610> even<00:03:53.820> slow

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:54.210 
where is most changing or I'd even slow

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:57.410 
where is most changing or I'd even slow
it<00:03:54.390> down<00:03:55.100> you<00:03:56.100> know<00:03:56.190> by<00:03:56.430> myself<00:03:56.610> without<00:03:57.240> a

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
it down you know by myself without a

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.380 
it down you know by myself without a
stopwatch<00:03:57.780> and<00:03:58.230> just<00:03:58.380> like<00:03:58.970> see<00:03:59.970> you<00:04:00.300> know

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
stopwatch and just like see you know

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.510 
stopwatch and just like see you know
well<00:04:00.660> where<00:04:01.230> is<00:04:01.350> the<00:04:01.440> most<00:04:01.620> change<00:04:01.920> happening

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:02.520 
well where is the most change happening

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:05.720 
well where is the most change happening
and<00:04:02.850> at<00:04:03.150> what<00:04:03.360> point<00:04:03.600> you<00:04:04.080> know<00:04:04.430> what<00:04:05.430> would<00:04:05.580> be

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
and at what point you know what would be

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:08.030 
and at what point you know what would be
confusing<00:04:06.180> to<00:04:06.300> because<00:04:06.690> you<00:04:06.810> also<00:04:07.010> need<00:04:08.010> to

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
confusing to because you also need to

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.980 
confusing to because you also need to
think<00:04:08.340> that<00:04:08.520> there<00:04:08.760> is<00:04:08.790> somebody<00:04:09.660> who's<00:04:09.810> going

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:09.990 
think that there is somebody who's going

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:11.390 
think that there is somebody who's going
to<00:04:10.110> be<00:04:10.200> coming<00:04:10.320> after<00:04:10.650> you<00:04:10.950> if<00:04:11.070> you're<00:04:11.220> in<00:04:11.340> a

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
to be coming after you if you're in a

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.510 
to be coming after you if you're in a
larger<00:04:11.670> production<00:04:12.290> or<00:04:13.290> if<00:04:13.830> you<00:04:14.190> know<00:04:14.280> you're

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:14.520 
larger production or if you know you're

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:17.090 
larger production or if you know you're
working<00:04:14.850> in<00:04:14.970> stages<00:04:15.540> with<00:04:15.840> the<00:04:15.959> client<00:04:16.440> you

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
working in stages with the client you

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.789 
working in stages with the client you
want<00:04:17.940> to<00:04:18.060> put<00:04:18.480> down<00:04:18.690> the<00:04:19.109> most<00:04:19.320> important

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
want to put down the most important

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:22.820 
want to put down the most important
parts<00:04:20.220> that<00:04:20.460> that<00:04:21.359> tell<00:04:21.570> the<00:04:21.720> story<00:04:21.989> or<00:04:22.350> that

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
parts that that tell the story or that

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:24.320 
parts that that tell the story or that
tell<00:04:23.040> the<00:04:23.190> performance<00:04:23.760> or<00:04:23.910> drive<00:04:24.210> the

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
tell the performance or drive the

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:25.370 
tell the performance or drive the
performance<00:04:24.810> excuse<00:04:25.169> me

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
performance excuse me

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:29.270 
performance excuse me
and<00:04:26.300> again<00:04:27.300> you<00:04:27.450> know<00:04:27.570> it's<00:04:27.930> not<00:04:28.190> it's<00:04:29.190> not

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
and again you know it's not it's not

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.890 
and again you know it's not it's not
going<00:04:29.430> to<00:04:29.490> come<00:04:29.610> off<00:04:29.730> perfect<00:04:30.210> the<00:04:30.510> first<00:04:30.720> time

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
going to come off perfect the first time

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:32.540 
going to come off perfect the first time
around<00:04:31.020> it's<00:04:31.410> very<00:04:31.470> experimental

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
around it's very experimental

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:35.120 
around it's very experimental
you<00:04:33.300> know<00:04:33.420> animation<00:04:34.140> is<00:04:34.290> a<00:04:34.320> fine<00:04:34.680> art<00:04:34.860> and<00:04:35.040> it

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.130 
you know animation is a fine art and it

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:36.200 
you know animation is a fine art and it
takes<00:04:35.340> time<00:04:35.550> to<00:04:35.730> master

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
takes time to master

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.750 
takes time to master
so<00:04:36.630> just<00:04:36.900> to<00:04:37.020> recap<00:04:37.230> you<00:04:37.680> know<00:04:37.770> to<00:04:38.460> get<00:04:38.610> better

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:38.760 
so just to recap you know to get better

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.280 
so just to recap you know to get better
timing<00:04:39.030> better<00:04:39.360> spacing<00:04:39.630> you<00:04:39.900> want<00:04:40.050> to<00:04:40.140> act

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:40.290 
timing better spacing you want to act

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:42.800 
timing better spacing you want to act
out<00:04:40.470> your<00:04:40.710> shot<00:04:40.950> or<00:04:41.100> seen<00:04:41.600> nothing<00:04:42.600> will<00:04:42.720> be

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
out your shot or seen nothing will be

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:44.210 
out your shot or seen nothing will be
exact<00:04:43.140> the<00:04:43.230> first<00:04:43.440> time<00:04:43.680> and<00:04:43.890> you<00:04:43.950> can<00:04:44.070> always

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220 
exact the first time and you can always

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:46.780 
exact the first time and you can always
adjust<00:04:44.430> things<00:04:44.820> later<00:04:45.120> but<00:04:45.930> once<00:04:46.140> you<00:04:46.320> do<00:04:46.560> have

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:46.790 
adjust things later but once you do have

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:49.250 
adjust things later but once you do have
satisfying<00:04:47.790> keys<00:04:48.120> and<00:04:48.360> breakdowns<00:04:48.780> then<00:04:49.140> you

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:49.260 
satisfying keys and breakdowns then you

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:50.690 
satisfying keys and breakdowns then you
can<00:04:49.380> go<00:04:49.500> back<00:04:49.530> to<00:04:49.710> your<00:04:49.950> timing<00:04:50.310> chart<00:04:50.550> and

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:50.700 
can go back to your timing chart and

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.550 
can go back to your timing chart and
start<00:04:50.940> getting<00:04:51.210> precise<00:04:51.600> but<00:04:52.230> where<00:04:52.410> you<00:04:52.530> want

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 
start getting precise but where you want

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.050 
start getting precise but where you want
your<00:04:52.950> in-betweens<00:04:53.490> and<00:04:53.670> whether<00:04:53.820> they're

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 
your in-betweens and whether they're

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.460 
your in-betweens and whether they're
going<00:04:54.210> to<00:04:54.300> be<00:04:54.450> easing<00:04:54.780> in<00:04:54.900> or<00:04:55.020> using<00:04:55.290> out

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:55.470 
going to be easing in or using out

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:57.190 
going to be easing in or using out
something<00:04:56.220> to<00:04:56.280> keep<00:04:56.430> in<00:04:56.580> mind<00:04:56.610> though<00:04:56.970> is<00:04:57.120> that

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:57.200 
something to keep in mind though is that

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.060 
something to keep in mind though is that
animation<00:04:58.200> is<00:04:58.290> a<00:04:58.320> very<00:04:58.500> collaborative<00:04:58.800> effort

00:04:59.060 --> 00:04:59.070 
animation is a very collaborative effort

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:01.250 
animation is a very collaborative effort
and<00:04:59.370> sometimes<00:04:59.760> we<00:04:59.940> tend<00:05:00.120> to<00:05:00.210> rely<00:05:00.390> a<00:05:00.840> little

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:01.260 
and sometimes we tend to rely a little

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.200 
and sometimes we tend to rely a little
too<00:05:01.410> much<00:05:01.590> on<00:05:01.770> the<00:05:01.860> next<00:05:02.070> person<00:05:02.520> but<00:05:03.000> if<00:05:03.090> we

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.210 
too much on the next person but if we

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:04.790 
too much on the next person but if we
won't<00:05:03.420> let<00:05:03.480> our<00:05:03.660> productions<00:05:04.320> to<00:05:04.440> start<00:05:04.680> going

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 
won't let our productions to start going

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:05.930 
won't let our productions to start going
a<00:05:04.890> little<00:05:04.980> bit<00:05:05.160> smoother<00:05:05.520> and<00:05:05.670> you<00:05:05.730> want<00:05:05.880> to

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:05.940 
a little bit smoother and you want to

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:07.760 
a little bit smoother and you want to
become<00:05:06.120> an<00:05:06.330> invaluable<00:05:06.720> member<00:05:07.290> to<00:05:07.410> your<00:05:07.500> team

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770 
become an invaluable member to your team

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:09.980 
become an invaluable member to your team
the<00:05:08.280> best<00:05:08.460> thing<00:05:08.640> to<00:05:08.730> do<00:05:08.910> is<00:05:09.030> to<00:05:09.150> have<00:05:09.300> solid

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:09.990 
the best thing to do is to have solid

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:12.800 
the best thing to do is to have solid
drawings<00:05:10.890> and<00:05:11.070> you<00:05:11.460> get<00:05:11.670> that<00:05:11.850> by<00:05:12.060> you<00:05:12.720> know

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:12.810

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:28.890 
can just focus on performance one clear

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:30.530 
can just focus on performance one clear
drawing<00:05:29.160> can<00:05:29.310> be<00:05:29.400> more<00:05:29.640> helpful<00:05:29.970> than<00:05:30.240> six

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:30.540 
drawing can be more helpful than six
