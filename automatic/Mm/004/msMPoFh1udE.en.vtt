00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
lower I found the root on the a string

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.639 
lower I found the root on the a string
and<00:00:31.090> I<00:00:31.210> plug<00:00:31.419> in<00:00:31.540> an<00:00:31.689> a<00:00:31.930> major<00:00:32.169> looking<00:00:32.470> shape

00:00:32.639 --> 00:00:32.649 
and I plug in an a major looking shape

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:38.370 
and I plug in an a major looking shape
that's<00:00:32.860> a<00:00:33.190> flat<00:00:33.489> major<00:00:34.210> E<00:00:35.850> flat<00:00:36.850> minor<00:00:37.380> make

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:38.380 
that's a flat major E flat minor make

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:39.870 
that's a flat major E flat minor make
that<00:00:38.559> look<00:00:38.710> like<00:00:38.860> an<00:00:39.040> a<00:00:39.130> minor<00:00:39.399> shape<00:00:39.700> instead

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:39.880 
that look like an a minor shape instead

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:44.400 
that look like an a minor shape instead
of<00:00:40.030> an<00:00:40.149> a<00:00:40.210> major<00:00:40.450> shape<00:00:42.059> so<00:00:43.059> there's<00:00:43.410> flat

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:44.410 
of an a major shape so there's flat

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:49.380 
of an a major shape so there's flat
minor<00:00:44.860> E<00:00:45.390> flat<00:00:46.390> seven<00:00:47.490> it<00:00:48.490> kind<00:00:48.820> of<00:00:48.910> looks<00:00:49.240> like

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:49.390 
minor E flat seven it kind of looks like

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.770 
minor E flat seven it kind of looks like
the<00:00:49.720> a<00:00:49.750> major<00:00:50.110> but<00:00:50.530> then<00:00:50.680> we<00:00:51.180> borrow<00:00:52.180> like<00:00:52.570> that

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:52.780 
the a major but then we borrow like that

00:00:52.780 --> 00:01:02.069 
the a major but then we borrow like that
now<00:00:53.080> we<00:00:53.140> have<00:00:53.350> E<00:00:53.650> flat<00:00:53.890> seven<00:01:00.810> and<00:01:01.810> so<00:01:01.990> if

00:01:02.069 --> 00:01:02.079 
now we have E flat seven and so if

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:04.530 
now we have E flat seven and so if
that's<00:01:02.230> all<00:01:02.440> you<00:01:03.100> know<00:01:03.250> fairly<00:01:03.820> easy<00:01:04.150> for<00:01:04.449> you

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:04.540 
that's all you know fairly easy for you

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.490 
then take a progression like for

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:15.569 
then take a progression like for
instance<00:01:10.619> G<00:01:11.619> major<00:01:11.909> to<00:01:12.909> C<00:01:13.149> major<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:15.130> E<00:01:15.159> minor

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:31.589 
closest e know it's either on the a
string<00:02:29.560> or<00:02:29.950> the<00:02:30.099> E<00:02:30.129> string<00:02:30.400> it's<00:02:30.819> right<00:02:31.090> here

00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:31.599 
string or the E string it's right here

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:33.720 
string or the E string it's right here
I<00:02:31.629> might<00:02:32.469> have<00:02:32.620> to<00:02:32.739> you<00:02:33.040> know<00:02:33.129> figure<00:02:33.400> it<00:02:33.609> out

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
I might have to you know figure it out

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.000 
I might have to you know figure it out
but<00:02:34.090> that's<00:02:34.180> what<00:02:34.389> practice<00:02:34.810> is<00:02:34.900> for<00:02:35.170> figuring

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
but that's what practice is for figuring

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.309 
but that's what practice is for figuring
this<00:02:36.189> stuff<00:02:36.250> out<00:02:36.549> so<00:02:37.120> C's<00:02:37.359> right<00:02:37.569> there<00:02:37.840> it's

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 
this stuff out so C's right there it's

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:40.140 
this stuff out so C's right there it's
on<00:02:38.409> the<00:02:38.500> E<00:02:38.530> string<00:02:38.980> and<00:02:39.189> I<00:02:39.280> said<00:02:39.459> C<00:02:39.639> major<00:02:39.819> so

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
on the E string and I said C major so

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.059 
on the E string and I said C major so
we're<00:02:40.269> gonna<00:02:40.359> make<00:02:40.689> it<00:02:40.810> look<00:02:40.930> like<00:02:41.139> an<00:02:41.680> E<00:02:41.829> major

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:42.069 
we're gonna make it look like an E major

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:56.940 
we're gonna make it look like an E major
shape<00:02:44.489> so<00:02:50.549> then<00:02:51.549> I<00:02:51.669> said<00:02:51.730> II<00:02:52.120> minor<00:02:55.950> the

shape so then I said II minor the

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.580 
shape so then I said II minor the
