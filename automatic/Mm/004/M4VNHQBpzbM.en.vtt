00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
you could bring it back to life this way

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.450 
you could bring it back to life this way
and<00:01:51.030> you'll<00:01:51.810> definitely<00:01:52.140> need<00:01:52.799> a<00:01:53.040> manual

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
and you'll definitely need a manual

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
charger people think this is like

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.819 
charger people think this is like
outdated<00:01:57.119> tech<00:01:58.170> it's<00:01:58.409> not<00:01:58.619> outdated

tech not at all not at all and many

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.510 
tech not at all not at all and many
times<00:02:02.969> these<00:02:03.780> electronic<00:02:04.439> garbage<00:02:04.950> I<00:02:05.130> call<00:02:05.369> it

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
times these electronic garbage I call it

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.280 
times these electronic garbage I call it
I<00:02:05.640> don't<00:02:05.880> like<00:02:06.030> it<00:02:06.210> it's<00:02:06.509> like<00:02:06.659> really<00:02:07.049> great

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
I don't like it it's like really great

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.499 
I don't like it it's like really great
when<00:02:07.500> it<00:02:07.619> works<00:02:07.759> but<00:02:08.759> when<00:02:09.030> there's<00:02:09.179> a<00:02:09.239> problem

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
when it works but when there's a problem

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:10.699 
when it works but when there's a problem
it<00:02:10.020> sucks

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
it sucks

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.490 
it sucks
so<00:02:11.580> that's<00:02:12.239> what<00:02:12.599> I<00:02:12.629> have<00:02:12.750> to<00:02:12.810> say

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
so that's what I have to say

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.500 
so that's what I have to say
that<00:02:13.920> means<00:02:14.130> big<00:02:14.370> you<00:02:14.790> know<00:02:14.910> not<00:02:15.090> to<00:02:15.210> put<00:02:15.390> it

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
that means big you know not to put it

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.870 
that means big you know not to put it
too<00:02:15.630> uh<00:02:15.830> succinctly<00:02:16.830> but<00:02:17.220> when<00:02:17.700> there's<00:02:17.820> a

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
too uh succinctly but when there's a

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.760 
too uh succinctly but when there's a
problem<00:02:18.090> with<00:02:18.270> the<00:02:18.390> electronic<00:02:19.020> stuff<00:02:19.230> I<00:02:19.530> mean

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
problem with the electronic stuff I mean

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.340 
problem with the electronic stuff I mean
it's<00:02:19.830> like<00:02:20.130> you're<00:02:20.640> you're<00:02:21.120> just<00:02:21.200> plain<00:02:22.200> out

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
it's like you're you're just plain out

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.880 
it's like you're you're just plain out
of<00:02:22.500> luck

of luck

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.740 
of luck
you're<00:02:23.130> playing<00:02:23.400> out<00:02:23.550> of<00:02:23.670> luck<00:02:23.820> a<00:02:24.120> lot<00:02:24.600> of

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
you're playing out of luck a lot of

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.360 
you're playing out of luck a lot of
times<00:02:24.930> the<00:02:25.050> old-school<00:02:25.530> stuff<00:02:25.800> works<00:02:26.130> so<00:02:26.310> if

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
times the old-school stuff works so if

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.190 
times the old-school stuff works so if
your<00:02:26.520> battery<00:02:26.940> gets<00:02:27.210> and<00:02:27.810> say<00:02:27.960> you're<00:02:28.110> an

battery by mistake too far in use you
just<00:02:37.170> might<00:02:37.470> use<00:02:37.680> it<00:02:37.830> up<00:02:37.950> where<00:02:38.130> it's<00:02:38.250> down<00:02:38.400> to

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
just might use it up where it's down to

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.370 
just might use it up where it's down to
like<00:02:38.670> two<00:02:39.090> volts<00:02:39.480> or<00:02:39.630> something<00:02:39.990> like<00:02:40.140> that

minutes let it cool down then then you

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:00.980 
minutes let it cool down then then you
maybe<00:02:59.730> start<00:03:00.090> using<00:03:00.300> something<00:03:00.630> like<00:03:00.840> this

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:00.990 
maybe start using something like this

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:02.960 
maybe start using something like this
with<00:03:01.200> a<00:03:01.230> desulfation<00:03:02.010> you<00:03:02.459> can<00:03:02.580> start<00:03:02.820> using

with a desulfation you can start using

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.600 
with a desulfation you can start using
the<00:03:03.150> other<00:03:03.240> charger<00:03:03.780> this<00:03:04.590> might<00:03:05.160> bring<00:03:05.459> it

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
the other charger this might bring it

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.050 
the other charger this might bring it
back<00:03:05.820> and<00:03:06.720> just<00:03:07.250> using<00:03:08.250> electronic<00:03:08.790> stuff

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
back and just using electronic stuff

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.420 
back and just using electronic stuff
forget<00:03:09.870> about<00:03:10.050> it<00:03:10.320> man<00:03:10.500> I<00:03:10.620> found<00:03:11.040> out<00:03:11.220> I've

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430

forget about it man I found out I've
been<00:03:11.459> messing<00:03:11.880> around<00:03:11.940> with<00:03:12.270> so<00:03:12.600> much

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
been messing around with so much

been messing around with so much
mechanical<00:03:13.290> stuff<00:03:13.470> for<00:03:13.709> some<00:03:13.830> point<00:03:14.040> quite<00:03:14.430> a

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
mechanical stuff for some point quite a

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:17.210 
mechanical stuff for some point quite a
few<00:03:14.700> years<00:03:14.910> and<00:03:15.540> I<00:03:16.140> found<00:03:16.350> when<00:03:16.830> the<00:03:16.890> battery

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
few years and I found when the battery

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.729 
few years and I found when the battery
gets<00:03:17.400> way<00:03:17.670> discharged<00:03:18.470> the<00:03:19.470> only<00:03:19.590> way<00:03:19.680> to

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
gets way discharged the only way to

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:22.009 
gets way discharged the only way to
bring<00:03:19.950> it<00:03:20.040> back<00:03:20.690> Chargers<00:03:21.690> gonna<00:03:21.900> have

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
bring it back Chargers gonna have

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:23.540 
bring it back Chargers gonna have
actually<00:03:22.320> had<00:03:22.500> this<00:03:22.650> thing<00:03:22.890> for<00:03:22.920> gazillion

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 
actually had this thing for gazillion

actually had this thing for gazillion
years<00:03:23.580> and<00:03:24.390> replace<00:03:24.690> the<00:03:24.840> cords<00:03:25.230> on<00:03:25.380> it<00:03:25.530> stuff

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 
years and replace the cords on it stuff

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.729 
years and replace the cords on it stuff
like<00:03:25.890> that<00:03:26.250> it<00:03:26.459> still<00:03:26.790> works<00:03:27.350> energy<00:03:28.350> so<00:03:28.709> I

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
like that it still works energy so I

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:32.930 
like that it still works energy so I
recommend<00:03:29.660> you<00:03:30.660> visit<00:03:30.780> backup<00:03:31.370> keep<00:03:32.370> a<00:03:32.489> manual
