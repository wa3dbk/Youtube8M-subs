00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
um it's not one of those things where I

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.560 
um it's not one of those things where I
could<00:01:44.310> really<00:01:44.490> say<00:01:44.820> like<00:01:44.850> oh<00:01:45.240> they<00:01:45.390> should

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.149 
could really say like oh they should
have<00:01:45.689> just<00:01:45.840> done<00:01:46.020> this<00:01:46.229> instead<00:01:46.470> and<00:01:46.799> then<00:01:47.070> it

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
have just done this instead and then it

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.620 
have just done this instead and then it
would<00:01:47.280> have<00:01:47.340> been<00:01:47.399> perfect<00:01:47.790> because<00:01:48.060> the

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
would have been perfect because the

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.120 
would have been perfect because the
engineering<00:01:49.290> of<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.500> motherfucker<00:01:49.890> is

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
engineering of the motherfucker is

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.999 
engineering of the motherfucker is
amazing<00:01:50.970> it's<00:01:51.180> really<00:01:51.720> really<00:01:51.960> cool<00:01:52.140> like<00:01:52.530> the

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
amazing it's really really cool like the

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.800 
amazing it's really really cool like the
way<00:01:53.100> they<00:01:53.250> did<00:01:53.399> it<00:01:53.520> I<00:01:53.610> still<00:01:53.850> love<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.540> figure

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
way they did it I still love the figure

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.100 
way they did it I still love the figure
but<00:01:55.229> I<00:01:55.439> honestly<00:01:56.189> would<00:01:56.399> not<00:01:56.579> like<00:01:57.090> it<00:01:57.299> so<00:01:57.719> much

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
but I honestly would not like it so much

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.719 
but I honestly would not like it so much
if<00:01:58.439> I<00:01:58.740> did<00:01:58.920> not<00:01:59.070> get<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.369> upgrades<00:01:59.820> with<00:02:00.060> it<00:02:00.240> so

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
if I did not get the upgrades with it so

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:03.560 
if I did not get the upgrades with it so
let<00:02:02.729> me<00:02:02.820> show<00:02:02.939> you<00:02:03.030> what<00:02:03.149> he<00:02:03.210> looks<00:02:03.390> like<00:02:03.450> in

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
let me show you what he looks like in

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.139 
let me show you what he looks like in
his<00:02:04.350> other<00:02:04.770> reason<00:02:05.130> why<00:02:05.460> I'm<00:02:05.520> doing<00:02:05.790> it<00:02:05.850> too<00:02:06.030> is

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
his other reason why I'm doing it too is

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.359 
his other reason why I'm doing it too is
because<00:02:06.329> in<00:02:06.750> pretty<00:02:07.469> much<00:02:07.500> all<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:07.920> reviews

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
because in pretty much all the reviews

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.180 
because in pretty much all the reviews
it's<00:02:08.879> you<00:02:09.629> know<00:02:09.780> you<00:02:09.840> get<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.560> gun<00:02:10.800> is<00:02:10.979> about

with um these diecast
parts<00:03:13.260> that<00:03:13.410> go<00:03:13.560> on<00:03:13.680> the<00:03:13.770> handle<00:03:14.100> right<00:03:14.280> that

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:15.240 
parts that go on the handle right that

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:18.199 
parts that go on the handle right that
makes<00:03:15.450> a<00:03:15.540> big<00:03:16.080> big<00:03:16.790> fucking<00:03:17.790> difference

you feel I mean you want most of the

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:23.810 
you feel I mean you want most of the

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300 
you know these are the heavy components

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.120 
you know these are the heavy components
are<00:03:36.390> right<00:03:36.570> here<00:03:36.930> but<00:03:37.350> with<00:03:37.590> the<00:03:37.709> diecast

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
makes it thing overall a good weight

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.650 
makes it thing overall a good weight
without<00:03:41.040> them<00:03:41.549> it<00:03:41.790> feels<00:03:42.000> that<00:03:42.330> felt<00:03:42.540> a<00:03:42.630> little

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
without them it feels that felt a little

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.740 
without them it feels that felt a little
light<00:03:43.049> until<00:03:43.470> I<00:03:43.530> put<00:03:43.799> the<00:03:43.980> grades<00:03:44.340> on<00:03:44.549> so<00:03:44.910> it's

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
light until I put the grades on so it's

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:51.310 
light until I put the grades on so it's
just<00:03:45.930> these<00:03:46.140> parts<00:03:46.530> right<00:03:46.620> here<00:03:46.739> these<00:03:47.670> plates

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:51.320
