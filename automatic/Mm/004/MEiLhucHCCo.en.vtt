00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
heavily into sand or sand in my personal

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.189 
heavily into sand or sand in my personal
opinion<00:00:14.820> the<00:00:15.540> bigger<00:00:15.750> the<00:00:15.900> better

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
opinion the bigger the better

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.380 
opinion the bigger the better
I<00:00:16.350> want<00:00:16.619> something<00:00:16.920> huge<00:00:17.310> and<00:00:17.520> ridiculous<00:00:18.090> and

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
I want something huge and ridiculous and

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.060 
I want something huge and ridiculous and
for<00:00:18.600> that<00:00:18.750> reason<00:00:19.109> I've<00:00:19.439> come<00:00:19.770> up<00:00:19.890> with<00:00:19.920> a

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
for that reason I've come up with a

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.130 
for that reason I've come up with a
really<00:00:20.490> cool<00:00:20.640> little<00:00:20.939> circuit<00:00:21.420> that<00:00:21.570> allows

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
really cool little circuit that allows

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.380 
really cool little circuit that allows
you<00:00:22.350> to<00:00:22.470> build<00:00:22.710> giant<00:00:23.010> doors<00:00:23.490> with<00:00:23.880> relative

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
you to build giant doors with relative

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.810 
you to build giant doors with relative
ease<00:00:24.660> now<00:00:24.960> I<00:00:24.990> say<00:00:25.289> that<00:00:25.529> very<00:00:25.769> loosely<00:00:26.189> and<00:00:26.400> you

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
ease now I say that very loosely and you

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.880 
ease now I say that very loosely and you
will<00:00:26.939> see<00:00:27.150> why<00:00:27.359> in<00:00:27.599> a<00:00:27.660> little<00:00:27.990> bit<00:00:28.199> but<00:00:28.560> before

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
will see why in a little bit but before

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.230 
will see why in a little bit but before
we<00:00:29.010> get<00:00:29.130> on<00:00:29.310> with<00:00:29.490> all<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:29.760> technicalities

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
we get on with all the technicalities

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.479 
we get on with all the technicalities
and<00:00:30.720> confusing<00:00:31.199> stuff<00:00:31.410> let's<00:00:31.920> take<00:00:32.160> a<00:00:32.189> look<00:00:32.369> at

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
and confusing stuff let's take a look at

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:33.860 
and confusing stuff let's take a look at
this<00:00:32.579> one<00:00:32.790> in<00:00:32.910> action<00:00:33.030> because<00:00:33.540> let's<00:00:33.780> be

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
this one in action because let's be

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.860 
this one in action because let's be
honest<00:00:34.200> that's<00:00:34.559> what<00:00:34.680> we're<00:00:34.950> all<00:00:35.070> here<00:00:35.280> for<00:00:35.870> so

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
honest that's what we're all here for so

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.750 
honest that's what we're all here for so
here<00:00:37.079> we<00:00:37.170> are<00:00:37.200> then<00:00:37.500> this<00:00:37.739> door<00:00:38.010> is<00:00:38.250> six<00:00:38.579> blocks

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
here we are then this door is six blocks

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.360 
here we are then this door is six blocks
tall<00:00:39.149> and<00:00:39.420> six<00:00:39.870> blocks<00:00:40.140> wide<00:00:40.440> it<00:00:40.739> can<00:00:40.980> be<00:00:41.129> wider

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
tall and six blocks wide it can be wider

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.610 
tall and six blocks wide it can be wider
but<00:00:41.969> unfortunately<00:00:42.690> it<00:00:42.870> can't<00:00:43.110> be<00:00:43.230> any<00:00:43.350> taller

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
but unfortunately it can't be any taller

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.860 
but unfortunately it can't be any taller
because<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.219> Pistons<00:00:44.640> just<00:00:44.789> can't<00:00:45.300> push<00:00:45.600> any

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
because the Pistons just can't push any

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.229 
because the Pistons just can't push any
more<00:00:46.079> blocks<00:00:46.350> it<00:00:46.620> is<00:00:46.710> literally<00:00:47.129> that<00:00:47.399> tall<00:00:48.059> so

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
more blocks it is literally that tall so

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.130 
more blocks it is literally that tall so
let's<00:00:48.420> take<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:48.600> look<00:00:48.809> at<00:00:48.930> it

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
let's take a look at it

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.930 
let's take a look at it
we<00:00:49.410> just<00:00:49.590> flick<00:00:49.770> this<00:00:49.890> lever<00:00:50.129> here<00:00:50.219> and<00:00:50.550> you

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
we just flick this lever here and you

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.660 
we just flick this lever here and you
will<00:00:51.090> see<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.719> door<00:00:51.960> is<00:00:52.489> ridiculously<00:00:53.489> slow

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
will see the door is ridiculously slow

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.720 
will see the door is ridiculously slow
it<00:00:54.030> takes<00:00:54.379> absolutely<00:00:55.379> ages<00:00:55.649> to<00:00:56.039> go<00:00:56.190> down<00:00:56.430> into

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
it takes absolutely ages to go down into

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.700 
it takes absolutely ages to go down into
the<00:00:56.940> ground<00:00:56.969> and<00:00:57.449> that<00:00:57.899> is<00:00:57.989> because<00:00:58.350> of<00:00:58.559> the

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
the ground and that is because of the

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.260 
the ground and that is because of the
way<00:00:58.829> that<00:00:58.980> this<00:00:59.190> circuit<00:00:59.579> works<00:00:59.789> but<00:01:00.000> you<00:01:00.090> can

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
way that this circuit works but you can

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.180 
way that this circuit works but you can
see<00:01:00.449> now<00:01:00.930> that<00:01:00.960> it's<00:01:01.289> all<00:01:01.440> gone<00:01:01.620> down<00:01:01.800> we<00:01:02.039> can

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
see now that it's all gone down we can

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.880 
see now that it's all gone down we can
just<00:01:02.370> hop<00:01:02.550> on<00:01:02.760> through<00:01:03.120> there<00:01:03.629> is<00:01:03.930> our<00:01:04.199> arch<00:01:04.500> is

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
just hop on through there is our arch is

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.859 
just hop on through there is our arch is
up<00:01:05.129> in<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.549> sky<00:01:05.850> there<00:01:06.090> is<00:01:06.150> no<00:01:06.510> visible

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
up in the sky there is no visible

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.350 
up in the sky there is no visible
redstone<00:01:07.439> and<00:01:07.680> yeah<00:01:08.340> all<00:01:08.549> looks<00:01:08.760> pretty<00:01:09.000> good

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
redstone and yeah all looks pretty good

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.149 
redstone and yeah all looks pretty good
then<00:01:09.600> when<00:01:09.780> we<00:01:09.869> flick<00:01:10.080> this<00:01:10.170> leaver<00:01:10.409> again<00:01:10.740> you

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
then when we flick this leaver again you

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.710 
then when we flick this leaver again you
will<00:01:11.280> see<00:01:11.340> that<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.729> closing<00:01:11.970> sequence<00:01:12.330> is

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
will see that the closing sequence is

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.260 
will see that the closing sequence is
actually<00:01:13.110> significantly<00:01:13.380> faster<00:01:14.280> so<00:01:14.850> at

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
actually significantly faster so at

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.570 
actually significantly faster so at
least<00:01:15.390> that's<00:01:15.600> something<00:01:15.780> positive<00:01:16.460> now<00:01:17.460> I'm

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
least that's something positive now I'm

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.070 
least that's something positive now I'm
going<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:17.820> make<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.090> assumption<00:01:18.450> that<00:01:18.659> that

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
going to make the assumption that that

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.719 
going to make the assumption that that
was<00:01:19.259> fairly<00:01:19.560> predictable<00:01:20.070> you<00:01:20.130> probably

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
was fairly predictable you probably

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.969 
was fairly predictable you probably
expected<00:01:21.479> that<00:01:21.630> to<00:01:21.659> happen<00:01:21.960> so<00:01:22.290> now<00:01:22.740> we're

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
expected that to happen so now we're

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.679 
expected that to happen so now we're
going<00:01:23.130> to<00:01:23.250> get<00:01:23.430> on<00:01:23.640> to<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.850> interesting<00:01:24.479> stuff

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
going to get on to the interesting stuff

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.749 
going to get on to the interesting stuff
which<00:01:24.990> is<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.229> Redstone<00:01:25.830> behind<00:01:26.130> it<00:01:26.280> so<00:01:26.670> I'm

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
which is the Redstone behind it so I'm

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.609 
which is the Redstone behind it so I'm
going<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:26.970> hop<00:01:27.119> into<00:01:27.330> my<00:01:27.570> air<00:01:27.869> world<00:01:28.290> where

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
going to hop into my air world where

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.410 
going to hop into my air world where
everything<00:01:29.100> is<00:01:29.220> clear<00:01:29.549> we<00:01:29.939> can<00:01:30.119> get<00:01:30.240> a<00:01:30.270> nice

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
everything is clear we can get a nice

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.120 
everything is clear we can get a nice
cinematic<00:01:31.079> going<00:01:31.380> so<00:01:31.500> you<00:01:31.560> can<00:01:31.680> get<00:01:31.799> all<00:01:31.979> the

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
cinematic going so you can get all the

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.920 
cinematic going so you can get all the
angles<00:01:32.579> and<00:01:32.729> all<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:33.000> views<00:01:33.299> of<00:01:33.450> this<00:01:33.600> beast

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
angles and all the views of this beast

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.280 
angles and all the views of this beast
so<00:01:34.500> let's<00:01:34.680> go<00:01:35.210> now<00:01:36.210> before<00:01:36.570> you<00:01:36.689> jump<00:01:36.720> out<00:01:37.170> your

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
so let's go now before you jump out your

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.319 
so let's go now before you jump out your
chair<00:01:37.560> and<00:01:37.740> eject<00:01:38.130> yourself<00:01:38.579> out<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:39.000> window

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
chair and eject yourself out the window

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:40.850 
chair and eject yourself out the window
at<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.600> thought<00:01:39.780> of<00:01:39.930> building<00:01:40.290> this<00:01:40.409> thing<00:01:40.680> I

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
at the thought of building this thing I

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.010 
at the thought of building this thing I
will<00:01:41.159> admit<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.520> you<00:01:41.729> that<00:01:41.970> it<00:01:42.390> is<00:01:42.420> fairly

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
will admit to you that it is fairly

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.350 
will admit to you that it is fairly
large<00:01:43.229> at<00:01:43.530> least<00:01:43.770> on<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.159> surface<00:01:44.549> of<00:01:44.670> it<00:01:44.850> but

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
large at least on the surface of it but

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.600 
large at least on the surface of it but
the<00:01:45.570> concept<00:01:46.049> itself<00:01:46.409> is<00:01:46.590> really<00:01:47.220> cool<00:01:47.430> as

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
the concept itself is really cool as

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.700 
the concept itself is really cool as
I've<00:01:47.759> said<00:01:48.090> many<00:01:48.149> times<00:01:48.509> in<00:01:48.960> this<00:01:49.049> video<00:01:49.200> it

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
I've said many times in this video it

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.859 
I've said many times in this video it
actually<00:01:50.250> uses<00:01:50.490> sand<00:01:50.880> stackers<00:01:51.390> rather<00:01:51.659> than

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
actually uses sand stackers rather than

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.050 
actually uses sand stackers rather than
piston<00:01:52.259> extenders<00:01:52.740> to<00:01:53.130> push<00:01:53.340> all<00:01:53.579> of<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.820> sand

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
piston extenders to push all of the sand

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.929 
piston extenders to push all of the sand
up<00:01:54.240> which<00:01:54.479> is<00:01:54.659> a<00:01:54.899> why<00:01:55.200> so<00:01:55.590> slow<00:01:55.649> but<00:01:56.430> B<00:01:56.670> Y

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
up which is a why so slow but B Y

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.450 
up which is a why so slow but B Y
doesn't<00:01:57.240> travel<00:01:57.630> down<00:01:57.990> about<00:01:58.259> 15<00:01:58.829> blocks<00:01:59.159> to

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
doesn't travel down about 15 blocks to

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.800 
doesn't travel down about 15 blocks to
the<00:01:59.579> bottom<00:01:59.820> of<00:01:59.939> the<00:02:00.030> design<00:02:00.329> so<00:02:00.540> it<00:02:00.659> does

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
the bottom of the design so it does

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.569 
the bottom of the design so it does
actually<00:02:00.990> keep<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.530> size<00:02:01.710> down<00:02:01.950> a<00:02:02.009> little<00:02:02.310> bit

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
actually keep the size down a little bit

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.850 
actually keep the size down a little bit
another<00:02:03.299> cool<00:02:03.600> thing<00:02:03.630> about<00:02:03.990> this<00:02:04.320> design<00:02:04.649> is

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
another cool thing about this design is

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.280 
another cool thing about this design is
that<00:02:05.189> it<00:02:05.310> uses<00:02:05.520> variable<00:02:06.240> post<00:02:06.479> extenders<00:02:07.140> to

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
that it uses variable post extenders to

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.680 
that it uses variable post extenders to
govern<00:02:08.069> how<00:02:08.280> tall<00:02:08.640> the<00:02:08.819> door<00:02:09.000> is<00:02:09.179> so<00:02:09.420> say<00:02:09.629> you

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
govern how tall the door is so say you

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.570 
govern how tall the door is so say you
wanted<00:02:10.050> just<00:02:10.289> a<00:02:10.379> three-high<00:02:10.830> door<00:02:11.099> rather

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
wanted just a three-high door rather

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.280 
wanted just a three-high door rather
than<00:02:11.819> the<00:02:11.940> six<00:02:12.180> one<00:02:12.330> then<00:02:12.540> you<00:02:12.629> just<00:02:12.810> remove<00:02:12.959> a

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
than the six one then you just remove a

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.539 
than the six one then you just remove a
bunch<00:02:13.409> of<00:02:13.560> items<00:02:13.709> from<00:02:13.980> the<00:02:14.129> hoppers<00:02:14.430> and

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:14.549 
bunch of items from the hoppers and

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:17.030 
bunch of items from the hoppers and
there<00:02:15.090> we<00:02:15.239> go<00:02:15.420> it<00:02:15.659> would<00:02:16.049> be<00:02:16.170> done<00:02:16.379> it's<00:02:16.709> a<00:02:16.799> very

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
there we go it would be done it's a very

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.009 
there we go it would be done it's a very
versatile<00:02:17.640> design<00:02:17.849> and<00:02:18.180> you<00:02:18.480> can<00:02:18.629> chop<00:02:18.840> and

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
versatile design and you can chop and

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:21.649 
versatile design and you can chop and
change<00:02:19.170> it<00:02:19.379> how<00:02:19.469> you<00:02:19.530> like<00:02:20.060> so<00:02:21.060> I<00:02:21.090> guess<00:02:21.420> I

00:02:21.649 --> 00:02:21.659 
change it how you like so I guess I

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:23.119 
change it how you like so I guess I
should<00:02:21.900> probably<00:02:22.109> give<00:02:22.469> you<00:02:22.620> a<00:02:22.650> bit<00:02:22.980> of<00:02:23.040> a

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:23.129 
should probably give you a bit of a

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:24.860 
should probably give you a bit of a
bare-bones<00:02:23.519> demonstration<00:02:24.390> here<00:02:24.569> so<00:02:24.750> we

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
bare-bones demonstration here so we

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.839 
bare-bones demonstration here so we
flick<00:02:25.140> this<00:02:25.260> lever<00:02:25.500> and<00:02:25.769> you<00:02:25.829> will<00:02:26.370> see<00:02:26.579> this

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
flick this lever and you will see this

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:28.849 
flick this lever and you will see this
little<00:02:27.150> machine<00:02:27.269> down<00:02:27.659> the<00:02:27.689> bottom<00:02:28.140> is<00:02:28.349> what

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:28.859 
little machine down the bottom is what

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:30.830 
little machine down the bottom is what
is<00:02:28.980> doing<00:02:29.189> it<00:02:29.430> is<00:02:29.640> taking<00:02:29.939> the<00:02:30.209> sand<00:02:30.420> from<00:02:30.599> this

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
is doing it is taking the sand from this

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.690 
is doing it is taking the sand from this
pillar<00:02:31.049> and<00:02:31.290> pushing<00:02:31.920> it<00:02:32.010> up<00:02:32.129> like<00:02:32.340> this<00:02:32.549> and

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
pillar and pushing it up like this and

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.910 
pillar and pushing it up like this and
then<00:02:33.299> all<00:02:33.510> of<00:02:33.659> the<00:02:33.750> sand<00:02:34.019> will<00:02:34.260> be<00:02:34.290> stored<00:02:34.739> in

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
then all of the sand will be stored in

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.619 
then all of the sand will be stored in
this<00:02:35.189> section<00:02:35.640> if<00:02:35.819> you<00:02:35.939> would<00:02:36.030> use<00:02:36.239> they<00:02:36.420> piss

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:36.629 
this section if you would use they piss

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:38.420 
this section if you would use they piss
things<00:02:36.870> then<00:02:37.109> you<00:02:37.620> would<00:02:37.739> have<00:02:37.950> all<00:02:38.189> of<00:02:38.340> your

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
things then you would have all of your

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.429 
things then you would have all of your
pistons<00:02:38.909> retract<00:02:39.389> right<00:02:39.720> the<00:02:39.870> way<00:02:39.989> down<00:02:40.019> and

00:02:40.429 --> 00:02:40.439 
pistons retract right the way down and

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:42.319 
pistons retract right the way down and
your<00:02:41.040> door<00:02:41.189> would<00:02:41.370> probably<00:02:41.670> finish<00:02:41.970> right

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:42.329 
your door would probably finish right

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:44.149 
your door would probably finish right
about<00:02:42.569> down<00:02:42.810> here<00:02:43.139> which<00:02:43.590> just<00:02:43.859> seems<00:02:44.069> pretty

00:02:44.149 --> 00:02:44.159 
about down here which just seems pretty

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:46.129 
about down here which just seems pretty
ridiculous<00:02:45.030> now<00:02:45.359> if<00:02:45.480> you<00:02:45.569> flick<00:02:45.780> this<00:02:45.900> lever

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:46.139 
ridiculous now if you flick this lever

00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:47.750 
ridiculous now if you flick this lever
again<00:02:46.500> you<00:02:46.920> will<00:02:47.069> see<00:02:47.129> that<00:02:47.489> the<00:02:47.639> little

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
again you will see that the little

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.729 
again you will see that the little
system<00:02:48.209> works<00:02:48.420> a<00:02:48.599> lot<00:02:48.810> faster<00:02:49.260> this<00:02:49.379> way<00:02:49.560> round

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
system works a lot faster this way round

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:51.530 
system works a lot faster this way round
and<00:02:49.980> that<00:02:50.370> is<00:02:50.459> just<00:02:50.670> due<00:02:50.909> to<00:02:50.939> the<00:02:51.120> way<00:02:51.239> that<00:02:51.269> the

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
and that is just due to the way that the

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:52.940 
and that is just due to the way that the
sand<00:02:51.750> is<00:02:51.840> falling<00:02:52.200> and<00:02:52.349> then<00:02:52.650> you<00:02:52.739> do<00:02:52.859> a<00:02:52.889> little

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
sand is falling and then you do a little

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.550 
sand is falling and then you do a little
pulses<00:02:53.669> there<00:02:53.909> but<00:02:54.359> it<00:02:54.569> is<00:02:54.720> now<00:02:54.930> up<00:02:55.200> to<00:02:55.230> the

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
pulses there but it is now up to the

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.220 
pulses there but it is now up to the
very<00:02:55.799> top<00:02:55.919> so<00:02:56.489> there<00:02:56.730> it<00:02:56.849> is<00:02:57.000> that<00:02:57.540> is<00:02:57.689> our<00:02:57.870> sand

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
very top so there it is that is our sand

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.789 
very top so there it is that is our sand
door<00:02:58.470> closed<00:02:58.799> and<00:02:59.040> it<00:02:59.370> all<00:02:59.459> works<00:02:59.700> very<00:03:00.000> nicely

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:00.799 
door closed and it all works very nicely

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:03.409 
door closed and it all works very nicely
now<00:03:01.799> unfortunately<00:03:02.579> I'm<00:03:02.790> not<00:03:03.030> going<00:03:03.209> to<00:03:03.329> be

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:03.419 
now unfortunately I'm not going to be

00:03:03.419 --> 00:03:05.360 
now unfortunately I'm not going to be
doing<00:03:03.599> a<00:03:03.689> tutorial<00:03:03.750> on<00:03:04.379> this<00:03:04.680> specific<00:03:05.189> design

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
doing a tutorial on this specific design

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.179 
doing a tutorial on this specific design
simply<00:03:06.000> because<00:03:06.329> it<00:03:06.540> is<00:03:07.139> fairly<00:03:07.650> large<00:03:08.040> and

00:03:08.179 --> 00:03:08.189 
simply because it is fairly large and

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:09.920 
simply because it is fairly large and
there<00:03:08.579> is<00:03:08.730> quite<00:03:09.030> a<00:03:09.060> lot<00:03:09.269> of<00:03:09.299> things<00:03:09.599> I<00:03:09.780> would

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
there is quite a lot of things I would

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.690 
there is quite a lot of things I would
have<00:03:09.959> to<00:03:10.200> teach<00:03:10.409> you<00:03:10.560> on<00:03:10.739> how<00:03:10.859> to<00:03:10.889> do<00:03:11.129> it<00:03:11.159> for

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
have to teach you on how to do it for

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.580 
have to teach you on how to do it for
example<00:03:12.150> for<00:03:12.329> every<00:03:12.450> single<00:03:12.870> size<00:03:13.230> of<00:03:13.409> door

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
example for every single size of door

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.409 
example for every single size of door
you<00:03:13.769> need<00:03:13.950> you<00:03:14.400> need<00:03:14.579> a<00:03:14.609> different<00:03:14.939> set<00:03:15.299> of

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:15.419 
you need you need a different set of

00:03:15.419 --> 00:03:17.240 
you need you need a different set of
items<00:03:15.959> in<00:03:16.200> these<00:03:16.409> hoppers<00:03:16.650> so<00:03:16.950> what<00:03:17.099> I<00:03:17.129> would

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
items in these hoppers so what I would

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.610 
items in these hoppers so what I would
suggest<00:03:17.549> you<00:03:17.849> do<00:03:18.090> is<00:03:18.239> if<00:03:18.900> you<00:03:19.019> really<00:03:19.290> do<00:03:19.409> want

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
suggest you do is if you really do want

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.289 
suggest you do is if you really do want
to<00:03:19.650> take<00:03:19.799> a<00:03:19.859> closer<00:03:20.129> look<00:03:20.220> at<00:03:20.459> this<00:03:20.549> one<00:03:20.819> I<00:03:20.940> have

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299 
to take a closer look at this one I have

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:23.719 
to take a closer look at this one I have
included<00:03:21.629> a<00:03:21.989> well<00:03:22.260> download<00:03:22.530> and<00:03:22.919> an<00:03:23.159> mcedit

00:03:23.719 --> 00:03:23.729 
included a well download and an mcedit

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:25.640 
included a well download and an mcedit
schematic<00:03:23.760> in<00:03:24.449> the<00:03:24.599> description<00:03:25.139> that<00:03:25.560> you

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
schematic in the description that you

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:26.839 
schematic in the description that you
can<00:03:25.799> download<00:03:26.010> for<00:03:26.280> yourselves

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:26.849 
can download for yourselves

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:28.520 
can download for yourselves
put<00:03:27.090> it<00:03:27.209> into<00:03:27.329> your<00:03:27.479> world<00:03:27.750> safe<00:03:27.989> files<00:03:28.290> and

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
put it into your world safe files and

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.020 
put it into your world safe files and
just<00:03:28.829> mess<00:03:29.069> about<00:03:29.220> with<00:03:29.579> all<00:03:29.790> of<00:03:29.909> the

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
just mess about with all of the

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.059 
just mess about with all of the
circuitry<00:03:30.599> put<00:03:31.169> different<00:03:31.440> items<00:03:31.769> into<00:03:32.010> the

00:03:32.059 --> 00:03:32.069 
circuitry put different items into the

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:34.280 
circuitry put different items into the
hoppers<00:03:32.400> and<00:03:32.549> see<00:03:33.090> what<00:03:33.299> happens<00:03:33.690> the<00:03:33.840> chances

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
hoppers and see what happens the chances

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:35.569 
hoppers and see what happens the chances
are<00:03:34.440> you<00:03:34.590> going<00:03:34.769> to<00:03:34.889> break<00:03:35.069> it<00:03:35.280> but<00:03:35.459> that's

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:35.579 
are you going to break it but that's

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:37.520 
are you going to break it but that's
fine<00:03:35.849> because<00:03:35.909> obviously<00:03:36.629> there<00:03:37.139> is<00:03:37.260> a<00:03:37.290> backup

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
fine because obviously there is a backup

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.530 
fine because obviously there is a backup
in<00:03:37.889> the<00:03:38.040> form<00:03:38.280> of<00:03:38.370> the<00:03:38.489> world<00:03:38.669> download<00:03:38.909> but

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
in the form of the world download but

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.270 
in the form of the world download but
