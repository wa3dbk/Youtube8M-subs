00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.370
 a bit early 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:10.370
 all this fuss 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.509
 and often on this plane 

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:22.679
 now we want to turn around 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.560
 it's still 9 o'clock 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.560
 as to the success why 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.770
 during three days in new york 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:41.910
 here is the making of constant currency according to two recent studies 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.140
 it is a certainty why 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.140
 they would be eight suspects as if you did not understand why 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.000

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.420
 to amqui 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:56.650
 this lack of France 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:59.230
 a possible manipulation to surrender 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.840
 I learned that I was certain that the dakar 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.200
 I will add that it remains 

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:08.430
 not sure that the older man has always wanted me to be on earth 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.110
 the other airports 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.210

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.960
 like what 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.040
 both ap 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.840
 a few minutes later 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.840
 I hope now 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.980
 in the classic event 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.380
 in respect for my life 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.380
 I am personally I think it's good 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.140
 since 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.140
 shock 

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:11.819
 the stolen culture 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:12.819
 the club 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:15.819

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:19.819
 guillaume gille 

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:52.959

 2 

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:06.629
 it's tough

 the euro is progressing 

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:23.289
 but at what cost 

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:41.009
 the first source 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:47.029
