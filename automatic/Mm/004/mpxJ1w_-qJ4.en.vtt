00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:49.869 
the different boot animations now if you

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:53.969 
the different boot animations now if you
do<00:01:50.050> the<00:01:50.380> full<00:01:50.830> rom<00:01:51.700> which<00:01:52.360> is<00:01:52.539> what<00:01:52.690> I<00:01:52.720> did<00:01:53.229> just

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
do the full rom which is what I did just

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:55.699 
do the full rom which is what I did just
a<00:01:54.069> flashable<00:01:54.520> zip<00:01:54.670> I<00:01:55.060> think<00:01:55.270> it's<00:01:55.390> much<00:01:55.509> easier

00:01:55.699 --> 00:01:55.709 
a flashable zip I think it's much easier

00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:59.279 
a flashable zip I think it's much easier
you<00:01:56.709> do<00:01:56.920> have<00:01:57.160> to<00:01:57.459> install<00:01:57.880> the<00:01:58.149> gaps<00:01:58.509> as<00:01:58.810> well

00:01:59.279 --> 00:01:59.289 
you do have to install the gaps as well

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:02.820 
you do have to install the gaps as well
but<00:01:59.649> the<00:02:00.250> developer<00:02:01.020> includes<00:02:02.020> a<00:02:02.259> link<00:02:02.590> to

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:02.830 
but the developer includes a link to

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.550 
but the developer includes a link to
where<00:02:02.979> you<00:02:03.009> can<00:02:03.190> find<00:02:03.640> the<00:02:04.390> google<00:02:04.929> apps<00:02:05.200> that

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
where you can find the google apps that

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.990 
where you can find the google apps that
work<00:02:05.800> best<00:02:06.220> with<00:02:06.580> the<00:02:06.940> dark<00:02:07.420> aokp<00:02:08.289> theme<00:02:09.000> so

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
work best with the dark aokp theme so

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.850 
work best with the dark aokp theme so
that's<00:02:10.209> what<00:02:10.450> I<00:02:10.479> did<00:02:10.630> also<00:02:11.080> and<00:02:11.530> I'll<00:02:11.620> show

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
that's what I did also and I'll show

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.650 
that's what I did also and I'll show
that<00:02:12.099> here<00:02:12.280> in<00:02:12.370> a<00:02:12.430> second<00:02:12.849> so<00:02:13.060> let's<00:02:13.240> readjust

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
that here in a second so let's readjust

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.600 
that here in a second so let's readjust
the<00:02:13.750> camera<00:02:14.110> we'll<00:02:14.260> be<00:02:14.349> right<00:02:14.560> back<00:02:14.739> alright

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
the camera we'll be right back alright

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.089 
the camera we'll be right back alright
so<00:02:15.790> as<00:02:16.090> you<00:02:16.300> saw<00:02:16.510> it<00:02:16.720> when<00:02:16.900> it<00:02:17.050> fired<00:02:17.349> up<00:02:17.560> here<00:02:17.980> I

there's<00:04:37.000> a<00:04:37.090> ton<00:04:37.330> of<00:04:37.360> stuff<00:04:37.780> in<00:04:37.900> here<00:04:37.930> you<00:04:38.260> can

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470 
there's a ton of stuff in here you can

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:40.210 
there's a ton of stuff in here you can
play<00:04:38.740> around<00:04:38.919> with

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:40.220 
play around with

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:44.380 
play around with
and<00:04:41.440> the<00:04:42.440> developer<00:04:42.920> says<00:04:43.220> that<00:04:43.550> if<00:04:43.790> you<00:04:43.970> try<00:04:44.360> a

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:44.390 
and the developer says that if you try a

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:46.600 
and the developer says that if you try a
different<00:04:44.870> kernel<00:04:45.320> that<00:04:45.680> will<00:04:45.860> even<00:04:46.220> increase

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:46.610 
different kernel that will even increase

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:49.510 
different kernel that will even increase
the<00:04:47.000> amount<00:04:47.750> of<00:04:48.020> options<00:04:48.620> you<00:04:48.770> can<00:04:48.950> customize

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:49.520 
the amount of options you can customize

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.500 
the amount of options you can customize
on<00:04:49.850> your<00:04:50.360> rom<00:04:50.630> when<00:04:51.350> you<00:04:51.470> install<00:04:51.860> the<00:04:52.040> full

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:52.510 
on your rom when you install the full

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:56.200 
on your rom when you install the full
rom<00:04:53.510> like<00:04:53.870> I<00:04:53.900> did<00:04:54.380> it<00:04:54.730> automatically<00:04:55.730> comes

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:56.210 
rom like I did it automatically comes

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:59.680 
rom like I did it automatically comes
with<00:04:56.570> the<00:04:57.100> developers<00:04:58.100> custom<00:04:58.670> kernel<00:04:59.150> it's

00:04:59.680 --> 00:04:59.690 
with the developers custom kernel it's

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:01.720 
with the developers custom kernel it's
based<00:05:00.020> on<00:05:00.230> stock<00:05:00.740> kernel<00:05:01.070> but<00:05:01.370> it's<00:05:01.520> one<00:05:01.700> that

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:01.730 
based on stock kernel but it's one that

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:04.030 
based on stock kernel but it's one that
he's<00:05:02.030> tweaking<00:05:02.540> he<00:05:03.080> says<00:05:03.380> choosing<00:05:03.830> a<00:05:03.920> new

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:04.040 
he's tweaking he says choosing a new

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.100 
he's tweaking he says choosing a new
kernel<00:05:04.340> will<00:05:04.610> also<00:05:05.030> increase<00:05:05.450> battery<00:05:05.840> life

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:06.110 
kernel will also increase battery life

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:09.610 
kernel will also increase battery life
and<00:05:07.270> stability<00:05:08.270> but<00:05:08.510> like<00:05:09.170> i<00:05:09.260> said<00:05:09.290> i've<00:05:09.500> been

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:09.620 
and stability but like i said i've been

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:10.900 
and stability but like i said i've been
using<00:05:09.740> this<00:05:09.920> for<00:05:09.980> a<00:05:10.130> couple<00:05:10.220> days<00:05:10.490> and<00:05:10.550> i

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:10.910 
using this for a couple days and i

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:13.600 
using this for a couple days and i
haven't<00:05:11.240> seen<00:05:11.420> any<00:05:11.690> problems<00:05:12.410> I<00:05:12.710> had<00:05:13.460> this

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:13.610 
haven't seen any problems I had this

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:16.360 
haven't seen any problems I had this
charge<00:05:13.970> overnight<00:05:14.510> and<00:05:15.170> you<00:05:15.590> see<00:05:15.830> it's<00:05:16.040> almost

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:16.370 
charge overnight and you see it's almost

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:19.720 
charge overnight and you see it's almost
4pm<00:05:16.760> and<00:05:17.480> I've<00:05:18.110> got<00:05:18.380> eighty<00:05:18.740> percent<00:05:19.220> battery

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:19.730 
4pm and I've got eighty percent battery

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:23.830 
4pm and I've got eighty percent battery
left<00:05:20.170> so<00:05:21.170> it's<00:05:21.680> not<00:05:21.950> bad<00:05:22.280> at<00:05:22.580> all<00:05:22.880> all<00:05:23.360> right<00:05:23.570> so

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:23.840 
left so it's not bad at all all right so

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.440 
left so it's not bad at all all right so
real<00:05:24.110> quickly<00:05:24.140> we<00:05:24.800> will<00:05:25.130> run<00:05:25.400> quadrant<00:05:26.240> and

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:26.450 
real quickly we will run quadrant and

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:29.200 
real quickly we will run quadrant and
check<00:05:27.200> out<00:05:27.380> the<00:05:27.500> benchmark<00:05:28.070> going<00:05:28.880> in<00:05:29.030> I've

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:29.210 
check out the benchmark going in I've

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:30.730 
check out the benchmark going in I've
closed<00:05:29.540> all<00:05:29.750> the<00:05:29.840> applications<00:05:30.200> that<00:05:30.590> were

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:30.740 
closed all the applications that were

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:35.200 
closed all the applications that were
running<00:05:31.810> so<00:05:32.810> we<00:05:32.930> should<00:05:33.140> be<00:05:33.320> good<00:05:33.350> to<00:05:33.530> go<00:05:34.210> start

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:35.210 
running so we should be good to go start

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:36.909 
running so we should be good to go start
this<00:05:35.480> up<00:05:35.720> and<00:05:35.900> we'll<00:05:36.230> be<00:05:36.380> right<00:05:36.530> back<00:05:36.680> when

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:36.919

00:05:59.500 --> 00:05:59.510 
around with different kernels and see if

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:02.800 
around with different kernels and see if
that<00:05:59.540> helped<00:06:00.669> there<00:06:01.669> you<00:06:01.760> go<00:06:01.880> guys<00:06:02.090> real<00:06:02.780> quick
