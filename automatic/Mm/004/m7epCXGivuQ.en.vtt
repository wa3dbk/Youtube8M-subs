think<00:00:53.309> we<00:00:53.670> said<00:00:55.969> what<00:00:56.969> are<00:00:57.000> we<00:00:57.120> looking<00:00:57.539> for

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
think we said what are we looking for

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:06.620 
think we said what are we looking for
that's<00:01:02.660> okay<00:01:04.250> either<00:01:05.250> there<00:01:05.640> is<00:01:05.670> always<00:01:06.420> going

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
that's okay either there is always going

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.969 
that's okay either there is always going
to<00:01:06.750> be<00:01:06.810> pain<00:01:07.259> and<00:01:08.119> if<00:01:09.119> there<00:01:09.360> is<00:01:09.600> it<00:01:10.410> better<00:01:10.740> be

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
to be pain and if there is it better be

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:23.770 
to be pain and if there is it better be
fairly<00:01:14.330> distributed<00:01:17.689> that<00:01:21.590> there<00:01:22.590> are<00:01:22.920> no

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
fairly distributed that there are no

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.830 
fairly distributed that there are no
superiors<00:01:24.780> I<00:01:25.820> think<00:01:26.820> we're<00:01:27.030> all<00:01:27.210> about<00:01:27.390> the

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
superiors I think we're all about the

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.609 
superiors I think we're all about the
same<00:01:28.880> but<00:01:29.880> there<00:01:30.090> certainly<00:01:30.450> are<00:01:30.689> advantages

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
same but there certainly are advantages

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:42.289 
same but there certainly are advantages
in<00:01:32.990> life<00:01:37.189> and<00:01:38.189> money<00:01:39.409> no<00:01:40.409> and<00:01:40.710> who<00:01:41.579> writes<00:01:41.970> the

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
in life and money no and who writes the

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:47.120 
in life and money no and who writes the
history<00:01:43.070> and<00:01:44.070> who<00:01:44.280> says<00:01:44.840> whose<00:01:45.840> goods

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
history and who says whose goods

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.219 
history and who says whose goods
who's<00:01:47.729> got<00:01:48.090> it<00:01:48.510> and<00:01:49.009> the<00:01:50.009> rich<00:01:50.420> control<00:01:51.420> the

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
who's got it and the rich control the

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.840 
who's got it and the rich control the
history<00:01:54.470> so<00:01:55.470> I<00:01:55.500> suppose<00:01:55.890> I'm<00:01:56.130> saying<00:01:56.520> that

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
history so I suppose I'm saying that

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.719 
history so I suppose I'm saying that
these<00:01:57.119> are<00:01:57.920> valuable<00:01:58.920> people<00:01:59.159> they<00:01:59.430> never

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
these are valuable people they never

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:09.800 
these are valuable people they never
looked<00:02:00.630> at<00:02:00.840> it<00:02:01.020> again<00:02:02.000> what<00:02:03.000> do<00:02:03.899> I<00:02:08.630> have<00:02:09.630> to

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
looked at it again what do I have to

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.300 
looked at it again what do I have to
throw<00:02:09.989> that<00:02:10.259> back<00:02:10.530> at<00:02:10.739> you<00:02:10.920> thank<00:02:11.610> you<00:02:13.310> define

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
throw that back at you thank you define

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.370 
throw that back at you thank you define
it<00:02:14.670> a<00:02:14.910> little<00:02:15.600> bit<00:02:15.750> more

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
it a little bit more

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.910 
it a little bit more
I<00:02:16.410> mean<00:02:16.830> invite<00:02:17.100> I<00:02:17.130> do<00:02:17.310> anything<00:02:18.350> it<00:02:19.350> it's<00:02:19.860> long

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
I mean invite I do anything it it's long

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:28.330 
I mean invite I do anything it it's long
two<00:02:22.920> seconds<00:02:24.230> if<00:02:25.230> we<00:02:25.500> think<00:02:25.920> of<00:02:26.510> what<00:02:27.510> we<00:02:27.720> know

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
two seconds if we think of what we know

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.880 
two seconds if we think of what we know
of<00:02:29.340> how<00:02:29.580> pictures<00:02:30.480> were<00:02:30.690> use<00:02:30.959> whether<00:02:31.470> it<00:02:31.709> be

of how pictures were use whether it be

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.350 
of how pictures were use whether it be
the<00:02:32.489> caves<00:02:32.880> and<00:02:33.300> altamirano<00:02:34.260> wherever

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
apparently we've made symbols whether it

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:50.590 
apparently we've made symbols whether it
