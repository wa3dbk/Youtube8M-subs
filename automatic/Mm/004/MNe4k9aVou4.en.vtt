scavenger cold blood toughness and fast

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.870 
scavenger cold blood toughness and fast
hands<00:02:35.960> and<00:02:36.200> the<00:02:36.770> only<00:02:36.950> one<00:02:37.070> I<00:02:37.100> really<00:02:37.160> liked

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
hands and the only one I really liked

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.550 
hands and the only one I really liked
was<00:02:38.000> toughness<00:02:38.540> it's<00:02:38.750> kind<00:02:38.960> of<00:02:38.990> like<00:02:39.080> focus

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
was toughness it's kind of like focus

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.560 
was toughness it's kind of like focus
from<00:02:39.830> mw3<00:02:41.080> so<00:02:42.190> I'm<00:02:43.190> going<00:02:43.370> to<00:02:43.400> use<00:02:43.580> a<00:02:43.610> nice

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:48.280 
from mw3 so I'm going to use a nice
toughness<00:02:45.140> I<00:02:45.290> think<00:02:45.560> in<00:02:45.680> that<00:02:45.830> and<00:02:47.290> that's

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
toughness I think in that and that's

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.320 
toughness I think in that and that's
really<00:02:48.500> all<00:02:48.620> I<00:02:49.070> kind<00:02:49.700> of<00:02:49.760> liked<00:02:49.940> out<00:02:50.120> there
