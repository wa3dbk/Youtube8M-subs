00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
them quite a few times I don't really

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.279

like<00:00:47.879> him<00:00:48.090> too<00:00:48.270> much<00:00:48.510> I<00:00:48.750> don't<00:00:48.809> think<00:00:49.170> he's

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
like him too much I don't think he's

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:50.810

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
skill uh so I a stuck him in at number

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.880 
skill uh so I a stuck him in at number
four<00:01:36.299> there<00:01:36.540> and<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:37.079> main<00:01:37.229> reason<00:01:37.259> for<00:01:37.770> that

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
four there and the main reason for that

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.039 
four there and the main reason for that
is<00:01:38.130> just<00:01:38.280> because<00:01:38.640> his<00:01:39.180> league<00:01:39.420> isn't<00:01:39.659> great

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
is just because his league isn't great

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.620 
is just because his league isn't great
so<00:01:40.290> that's<00:01:40.890> why<00:01:41.040> Martinez<00:01:41.670> is<00:01:41.880> a<00:01:41.909> number<00:01:42.390> four

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
so that's why Martinez is a number four

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.679 
so that's why Martinez is a number four
and<00:01:42.930> a<00:01:43.380> number<00:01:43.680> five<00:01:44.159> no<00:01:44.850> number<00:01:45.180> three<00:01:45.450> fuck
