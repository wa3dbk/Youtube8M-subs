corrected it it's just added help into
the<00:02:42.760> dictionary<00:02:43.760> so<00:02:43.909> you<00:02:44.000> do<00:02:44.120> have<00:02:44.269> to

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
the dictionary so you do have to

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.619 
the dictionary so you do have to
actually<00:02:44.569> type<00:02:44.989> in<00:02:45.109> hello<00:02:45.290> and<00:02:45.650> then<00:02:46.389> see<00:02:47.389> in
