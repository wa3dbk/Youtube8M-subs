00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.170
 2 

00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:04.170
 tee 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.810
 Various things comes with an option 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:21.760
 While Ai site is also a matter of course 

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:21.760
 Also still this is also made to appear after being renewed towards the meter 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:33.520
 Gri 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:36.810
 Certainly, 10 people are teaching the brakes and 10 people are teaching 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:39.260
 Now in intelligent mode 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.260
 I do not 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.329
 This is also new 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.550
 It is kind 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:49.579
 Have 3ds 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.579
 It feels like only the vehicle speed is steadily rising. 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.809
 Balance 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.280
 to you 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.290
 The front shakes rapidly 7 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:06.190
 In the direction you want to go 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.190
 I 'm obediently 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:16.409
 It's about a kilometer , so even changes are normally smooth 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.990
 A good balance of the front and rear 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:22.320
 Rolls is great 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:27.420
 I do not feel strange strength and I think very good 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:32.990
 Compared to pit after all the movement of the front is in amazing sharp 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:36.020
 The car is moving a bit lightly 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.909
 It is really nice torque feeling under 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.659
 There is a gap in the accelerator 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:41.440
 Anyway 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.530
 In the moment 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:47.910
 The registration that the car comes out in front of you 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.910
 It feels very good 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:54.470
 I feel it is good 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:06.420
 Intelligent mode isas sharp word sense this time really really handle 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:10.910
 It is also very important for the driver to be able to operate here without leaving it 25 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:13.690
 Well, the steering wheel can handle various things without talking 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:16.950
 The origin of the position 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.950
 After all this car is also 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:26.050
 After all, hold the steering wheel and step on the accelerator 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:30.250
 After all I think that it is the best to get the experience 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:33.530
 Anyway, it looks like an electrician a 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:35.810
 I think it's a car 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.530
 It was fun behind the wheel 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.690
 After that 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:45.350
 Of people who are in the same space 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:48.850
 All means because I think that it is felt that feeling good maybe 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:48.850
 Please try to test drive 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.810
 Oh
