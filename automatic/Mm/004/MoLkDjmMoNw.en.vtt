00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:08.630
 after a very successful debut the 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:11.360
 making frame beautiful with presentation 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:14.420
 from the marina thing araújo 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:17.410
 Teach you how to do a little more now 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:17.410
 to your house 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:27.060
 Hi, see you here to teach you. 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.890
 make beautiful again is ready 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.410
 We have a very good idea of a 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.880
 for us to keep our 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.580
 recipes those wonderful recipes 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.440
 What's your problem with teaching us, huh? 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.700
 Do you already have a little book of the Fabian? 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.390
 now you will learn how to do the 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:45.059
 To start, we 'll go. 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.800
 cut this box, you 'll see that the 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.730
 structure will help a lot in the 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:53.070
 process that she has this side're right to 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.290
 People are going to take advantage of it to be able to 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.930
 structure our binder so I 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:00.720
 I need to open the box, we'll go. 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.850
 disassemble the bottom of the carton 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.659
 cut one of the sides for us 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.659
 open here 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:18.620
 the ruler measured here the 18 18 16 and 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:21.770
 18 is going to start to see the 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:23.650
 structure of our binder is 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:28.100
 We'll have to cut a little bit. 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:29.510
 this time so that it stays the same 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.060
 proportion 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:35.920
 so we'll measure here 13 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.920
 cm is enough 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.790
 we have opted from both sides and we already have 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.040
 here o 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.520
 the basis of what we will use in our 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.520
 closed 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.030
 now it's time to pass the line 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:59.640
 so here we are glued to these 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:01.860
 two lateral bases is reminding that 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.600
 this medium here will be the bottom of the 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.700
 binder so now we will not 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.220
 passing glue miles does not just happen in these 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:11.370
 two sides and will apply the paper and 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:14.400
 I'll get those cute papers that 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.800
 People love this I found so much nobody. 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.800
 so this paper here we will cut 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.780
 it with the width of 21 centimeters 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.209
 You'll tell me more, but we will. 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.520
 did not cut the base with 18 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:27.959
 because it is but this leftover is precisely the 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.150
 finish what we are going to do in 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:34.739
 side of our file so we're 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:37.140
 cut that same paper I'm going to split 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:41.150
 It's a way for us to do both. 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.150
 sides of the closed 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:47.540
 so now we'll paste it on paper 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:53.060
 remembering to align the end of the piece with 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:55.640
 the end of the paper there to facilitate 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.950
 Your work cuts a little 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:01.780
 end of paper becomes much easier 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.780
 folding and finishing after 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:12.210
 so the test already glued on both sides is 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:14.370
 our role then we will make a 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:16.020
 detail on the bottom right 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.270
 we will put a different role 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:21.510
 to make that color mixing of one 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:24.720
 Grace and for this project I'm going to use 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:26.310
 this leaf here you go it's from 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.170
 a solid color but you will see that it 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.450
 has a beautiful relief that is a 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.760
 one in which always gives a 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:35.820
 more charm for the project 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:40.290
 so I'll cut as far as the bottom 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:42.150
 of our piece that I come here 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:45.000
 so I'll have her a little more 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:47.340
 five centimeters but I'm going to cut 10 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.200
 because she will have two bars left 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.290
 sides for each side will be fine. 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.290
 beautiful 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:10.600
 an internal finish with a 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:10.600
 kraft paper 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:18.410
 Now I'm doing the fold for the hour. 

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:24.700
 that we put a crumb on it is already 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:24.700
 all armed as well as closed must be 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:31.560
 to fill the binder we'll use 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:34.259
 the envelopes 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:36.690
 or the secret that overcoming people using cut 

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:39.660
 The mouth of the taer envelope knows we do not 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:46.740
 will need and will also be cutting the 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:49.620
 background folks will fold it is a medium 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:53.250
 Well, then, what do we do? 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:57.000
 created two pockets here, we'll go 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:59.570
 glue these sides to let them 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.570
 all together 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:11.750
 So this is going to turn into 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:14.960
 nice here 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:16.820
 this one is the result of the ninth of the crux 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:20.030
 from our binder so we'll go 

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:24.050
 to pass only a few queues 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:27.039
 of glue here and on the other 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:27.039
 let it dry 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:34.810
 We're going to drill here to 

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:34.810
 close our binder 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:44.360
 the slack off button and I'll hold it in 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:48.230
 button and come back in the same same 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:51.950
 The hole is pulling it well and I'm going to 

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:55.340
 Okay, it's behind the button. 

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:56.930
 Now we're going to the other side, right? 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:59.090
 wearing the same elastic we go 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:00.560
 make an aid to learn in this 

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:03.190
 button that will stay there in front of the 

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.190
 our play 

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:15.560
 O pulled Tanks closed here're ready 

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:17.480
 we key in that piece I used a tape is 

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:21.140
 red gorgorão to give one more 

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:23.450
 charm that application in detail 

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:26.450
 a sticker has several things that you 

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:28.910
 You can use it here to really leave. 

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:31.340
 that touch well your in the project that the 

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:34.820
 people taught you to do today and beyond 

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:37.040
 a binder for recipes is not that same 

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:40.100
 template you can use to save photos 

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:41.960
 if you can use it with a tissue 

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:44.150
 Fabric finishes super 

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:45.830
 sophisticated I wanted to remind you 

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:47.810
 do not forget that all this 

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:50.270
 step-by-step information you 

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:52.010
 need to make this piece will be 

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:54.380
 on our social networks 

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:55.820
 accessing thing voice and sandro case is 

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:58.610
 you will find all the information 

00:06:55.820 --> 00:07:01.820
 and you need to do the same as we do 

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:03.620
 made here or even more cool, I hope 

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:05.479
 Did you like this one? 

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:06.440
 ask us to teach you how to do 

00:07:05.479 --> 00:07:07.610
 Not today 

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:09.740

 soon and I just want you guys 

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:14.479

00:07:14.479 --> 00:07:21.430
 sure that everyone at home already has 

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:21.430
 eager for the next run out
