00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:09.000
 one night is not leonardo gender 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.770
 I live in Santa Maria Rio Grande do Sul and 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.780
 I did an update on MeditarrÃ¡neo in 

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:17.610
 force would be to pass on the experience I 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:23.359
 was complementary to the cut 10 x 6 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:23.359
 a while ago 16 years ago and 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.859
 I want to comment on this guitar here 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.090
 higher cost-benefit ratio that exists 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:34.620
 example she 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:38.280
 this new Indonesian model has taken 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.330
 an interesting thing that models 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.370
 gift 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:46.980
 the wood at the same time same model 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:51.650
 she is not as good as this goal 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.650
 old military team 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:58.700
 and yet the bridge of that new generation 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.630
 what is happening is a little better than 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.360
 That i had 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:06.950
 now I made a note in it because it was 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:08.630
 shaping the focus to be changing behind 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.369
 auto focus camera so I could not 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.409
 I still think it's possible to 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:14.850
 pass information 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:17.729
 I paid jb 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:21.270
 on the bridge that is prohibitive so announced 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:24.450
 which is not very proud I like it - 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:27.780
 avoided camargo is very eclectic even 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:30.360
 lightweight thrash lucila are 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.119
 approved for this type of sound and other 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.450
 59 on the arm 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:39.049
 I heard comments that I and there from 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.909
 of the ideal combination was the jeci in the arm 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:44.729
 said that comments on the single 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:47.819
 not much more gain than me too 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:51.000
 I could pay and I did not feel as 

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:52.409
 difference I liked even a little more 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.970
 gain but it's good because usually you 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:59.700
 The singer, the arm singer , is beer. 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.679
 increases the volume by a little more 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.810
 that other highlights in an investment 

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:05.520
 it would have a volume of channel has not 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.729
 to go through the high volume but 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.170
 important this difference I eat 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:15.440
 they said it was a combination I 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:18.950
 I liked it and now I put a bridge cut 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:21.390
 here now 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:24.180
 Mandela regularity had never passed 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:27.209
 for an image and I'm impressed 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:30.780
 because before you touched that bridge 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:35.070
 It was very bad that it's a system that you 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:38.000
 cut the rope and take the reverse end and put 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:40.140
 for in here he undertakes the concave with 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.780
 screw 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:48.330
 and the other mine I show her there 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:50.670
 passed the rope from behind and 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.200
 precisely where it fixed but there was a 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:57.390
 big step because it had a 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:59.820
 problem or the wear and tear that gets there 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:06.320
 set up poorly when you can not just 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:06.320
 rice and had no efficiency and felt 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.930
 that whole thing 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:15.840
 if you change with the budget you already have a 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:18.450
 problem with the same configuration and 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:23.489
 intends more accurate as if you 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:25.920
 to regulate with the brush and maintain 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:26.640
 that same brand or even people 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.890
 of rope 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.959
 I miss playing a little because I have to 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.489
 regularly in me and moves me neuton 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:37.070
 below 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:40.940
 but the chords were 10 and Joseph was 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:45.600
 Do you like a fight for me? 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:48.900
 and hard enough 90 cup endurance shots 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:50.700
 now as clean plays every time the 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.380
 The dog is quiet, safe enough. 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.490
 know how not to play professionally only 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:56.730
 for me 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:58.140
 This is the best of the year. 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:01.110
 I'm being a little by chance that the 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.550
 Tension Like Gene Fine Tuning Milton 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:05.070
 eat right 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:08.070
 the chef in that in her even a little soft I 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:09.750
 I'm feeling a little more light. 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:12.660
 and then training a little in the goods and 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:17.220
 such so then wanted to show the car 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:20.540
 on I 'll sue in the wet already 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.540
 it was good
