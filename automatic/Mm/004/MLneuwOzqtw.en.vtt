I<00:00:03.339> am<00:00:04.339> chief<00:00:04.580> executive<00:00:05.180> officer<00:00:05.720> of

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:05.930 
I am chief executive officer of

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:09.940 
I am chief executive officer of
logistics<00:00:06.919> and<00:00:07.129> production<00:00:08.000> at<00:00:08.950> Saddleback

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:09.950 
logistics and production at Saddleback

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:11.440 
logistics and production at Saddleback
productions<00:00:10.460> and<00:00:10.759> what<00:00:10.969> we're<00:00:11.090> going<00:00:11.240> to<00:00:11.269> do

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:11.450 
productions and what we're going to do

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:14.560 
productions and what we're going to do
here<00:00:11.690> we're<00:00:11.929> scoping<00:00:12.860> the<00:00:13.009> KLR<00:00:13.610> 650<00:00:14.000> exhaust

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:14.570 
here we're scoping the KLR 650 exhaust

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:16.690 
here we're scoping the KLR 650 exhaust
because<00:00:15.019> a<00:00:15.200> lot<00:00:15.440> of<00:00:15.500> people<00:00:15.769> are<00:00:15.830> doing<00:00:15.950> this

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:16.700 
because a lot of people are doing this

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:21.310 
because a lot of people are doing this
frugal<00:00:17.570> exhaust<00:00:17.990> mod<00:00:18.290> and<00:00:18.590> I<00:00:19.780> don't<00:00:20.780> know<00:00:20.990> but

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:21.320 
frugal exhaust mod and I don't know but

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.940 
frugal exhaust mod and I don't know but
I<00:00:21.350> think<00:00:21.470> the<00:00:22.360> 2010s<00:00:23.360> that<00:00:23.540> we're<00:00:23.660> writing<00:00:23.950> the

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:24.950 
I think the 2010s that we're writing the

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:26.710 
I think the 2010s that we're writing the
exhaust<00:00:25.310> has<00:00:25.550> been<00:00:25.580> modified<00:00:26.030> on<00:00:26.420> it<00:00:26.540> because

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:26.720 
exhaust has been modified on it because

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.870 
exhaust has been modified on it because
I<00:00:26.750> don't<00:00:26.930> get<00:00:27.050> that<00:00:27.200> chirping<00:00:27.530> sound<00:00:27.710> so<00:00:28.610> we'll

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:28.880 
I don't get that chirping sound so we'll

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.150 
I don't get that chirping sound so we'll
fire<00:00:29.090> the<00:00:29.120> bike<00:00:29.390> up<00:00:29.570> here<00:00:29.600> for<00:00:30.080> you<00:00:30.230> and<00:00:30.410> we'll

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:31.160 
fire the bike up here for you and we'll

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.010 
fire the bike up here for you and we'll
listen<00:00:31.280> to<00:00:31.520> the<00:00:31.610> chirp<00:00:31.880> if<00:00:32.090> you<00:00:32.540> can<00:00:32.689> hear<00:00:32.930> it

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:33.020 
listen to the chirp if you can hear it

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:34.600 
listen to the chirp if you can hear it
because<00:00:33.260> quite<00:00:33.620> honestly<00:00:33.950> I<00:00:34.010> can't<00:00:34.340> hear<00:00:34.520> it

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:34.610 
because quite honestly I can't hear it

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:51.260 
because quite honestly I can't hear it
on<00:00:34.670> my<00:00:34.730> bike<00:00:35.060> so<00:00:36.040> without<00:00:37.040> further<00:00:37.280> ado

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.010 

as<00:00:51.510> you<00:00:52.020> can<00:00:52.200> hear<00:00:52.790> there's<00:00:53.810> doesn't<00:00:54.810> seem<00:00:54.930> to

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
as you can hear there's doesn't seem to

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:03.799 
as you can hear there's doesn't seem to
be<00:00:55.140> any<00:00:55.260> chirp<00:00:55.530> there<00:00:55.800> so<00:00:56.550> we're<00:00:57.150> going<00:00:57.300> up

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.230 

so<00:01:04.809> I<00:01:04.840> can't<00:01:05.199> see<00:01:05.500> a<00:01:05.610> security<00:01:06.610> tripping<00:01:07.120> at

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240 
so I can't see a security tripping at

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.380 
so I can't see a security tripping at
all<00:01:07.330> so<00:01:07.630> what<00:01:08.230> we<00:01:08.350> thought<00:01:08.530> we<00:01:08.680> do<00:01:08.940> we<00:01:09.940> take<00:01:10.180> our

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 
all so what we thought we do we take our

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.480 
all so what we thought we do we take our
handy-dandy<00:01:10.780> de<00:01:11.110> Labarre<00:01:11.380> scope<00:01:11.710> and<00:01:11.950> we

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
handy-dandy de Labarre scope and we

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:20.070 
handy-dandy de Labarre scope and we
would<00:01:13.350> scope<00:01:14.350> the<00:01:15.930> exhaust<00:01:16.930> of<00:01:17.200> the<00:01:18.570> 2010<00:01:19.570> KLR

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:20.080 
would scope the exhaust of the 2010 KLR

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.360 
would scope the exhaust of the 2010 KLR
and<00:01:20.229> see<00:01:20.440> if<00:01:20.560> there's<00:01:20.770> much<00:01:21.280> of<00:01:21.310> a<00:01:21.490> difference

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:23.370 
and see if there's much of a difference

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:31.860 
and see if there's much of a difference
which<00:01:27.660> going<00:01:28.660> through<00:01:28.900> the<00:01:30.270> first<00:01:31.270> opening

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:31.870 
which going through the first opening

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:36.150 
which going through the first opening
here<00:01:32.170> you<00:01:32.320> can<00:01:32.560> see<00:01:32.860> that<00:01:33.130> it's<00:01:34.710> it's<00:01:35.710> similar

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:36.160 
here you can see that it's it's similar

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.550 
here you can see that it's it's similar
to<00:01:36.509> what<00:01:37.509> I've<00:01:37.630> seen<00:01:37.869> pulled<00:01:38.170> out<00:01:38.320> of<00:01:38.470> the

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
to what I've seen pulled out of the

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.030 
to what I've seen pulled out of the
other<00:01:38.680> ones<00:01:38.950> and<00:01:40.080> it's<00:01:41.080> got<00:01:41.350> the<00:01:41.710> spark

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:42.040 
other ones and it's got the spark

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.640 
other ones and it's got the spark
arrestor<00:01:42.490> at<00:01:42.640> the<00:01:42.790> end<00:01:42.970> of<00:01:43.150> it<00:01:43.290> then<00:01:44.290> it<00:01:44.470> comes

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:44.650 
arrestor at the end of it then it comes

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:48.440 
arrestor at the end of it then it comes
into<00:01:44.860> another<00:01:45.220> section<00:01:45.600> where<00:01:46.600> there's<00:01:46.930> a

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
into another section where there's a

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.100 
into another section where there's a
break<00:01:49.450> between<00:01:49.869> a<00:01:51.060> looks<00:01:52.060> like<00:01:52.330> another<00:01:52.720> cone

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
break between a looks like another cone

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.100 
break between a looks like another cone
of<00:01:53.440> some<00:01:53.860> sort<00:01:54.190> a<00:01:54.430> cone<00:01:55.240> effect<00:01:55.630> I<00:01:55.810> think<00:01:55.840> that

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
of some sort a cone effect I think that

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.410 
of some sort a cone effect I think that
cone<00:01:56.470> is<00:01:56.770> to<00:01:57.040> distribute<00:01:57.970> the<00:01:58.330> exhaust<00:01:59.290> around

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
cone is to distribute the exhaust around

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.240 
cone is to distribute the exhaust around
the<00:02:01.420> spark<00:02:01.990> arrestor<00:02:02.440> before<00:02:02.770> it<00:02:02.830> comes<00:02:03.040> out

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 
the spark arrestor before it comes out

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.139 
the spark arrestor before it comes out
and<00:02:03.910> then<00:02:04.509> it<00:02:04.630> goes<00:02:04.750> down<00:02:04.780> into<00:02:04.930> another<00:02:05.380> tube

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
and then it goes down into another tube

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.980 
and then it goes down into another tube
and<00:02:07.149> that<00:02:07.300> tube<00:02:07.360> is<00:02:07.990> down<00:02:08.410> into<00:02:08.710> a<00:02:08.740> welded<00:02:09.160> end

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:09.990 
and that tube is down into a welded end

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:16.110 
and that tube is down into a welded end
so<00:02:10.990> it<00:02:11.170> looks<00:02:11.350> very<00:02:11.440> similar<00:02:12.240> to<00:02:13.410> the<00:02:15.120> exhaust

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
so it looks very similar to the exhaust

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.880 
so it looks very similar to the exhaust
on<00:02:17.280> the<00:02:18.280> other<00:02:18.430> ones<00:02:18.640> that<00:02:18.819> I've<00:02:18.940> seen<00:02:19.890> but

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
on the other ones that I've seen but

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.290 
on the other ones that I've seen but
there<00:02:21.040> doesn't<00:02:21.220> seem<00:02:21.370> to<00:02:21.490> be<00:02:21.640> any<00:02:21.819> chirp<00:02:22.120> in

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
there doesn't seem to be any chirp in

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.680 
there doesn't seem to be any chirp in
here<00:02:22.510> I<00:02:22.540> think<00:02:22.750> probably<00:02:23.260> what<00:02:23.560> they've<00:02:23.800> done

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
here I think probably what they've done

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.440 
here I think probably what they've done
because<00:02:25.690> the<00:02:25.990> trip<00:02:26.260> I<00:02:26.470> think<00:02:26.560> would<00:02:26.920> be<00:02:27.450> from

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
because the trip I think would be from

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.930 
because the trip I think would be from
the<00:02:28.740> exhaust<00:02:29.740> gases<00:02:30.220> being<00:02:30.430> forced<00:02:30.850> through

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
the exhaust gases being forced through

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.250 
the exhaust gases being forced through
those<00:02:32.069> through<00:02:33.069> those<00:02:33.220> openings<00:02:34.050> in<00:02:35.050> the

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
those through those openings in the

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.690 
those through those openings in the
spark<00:02:35.560> arrestor<00:02:36.010> and<00:02:36.160> I<00:02:36.220> think<00:02:36.459> that<00:02:36.580> they've

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
spark arrestor and I think that they've

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.160 
spark arrestor and I think that they've
enlarged<00:02:37.060> the<00:02:37.330> openings<00:02:37.690> in<00:02:37.810> the<00:02:37.870> spark

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
enlarged the openings in the spark

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.010 
enlarged the openings in the spark
arrestor<00:02:38.530> that's<00:02:38.709> only<00:02:38.830> my<00:02:39.010> hunch<00:02:40.020> because

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.020 
arrestor that's only my hunch because

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:42.840 
arrestor that's only my hunch because
that<00:02:41.200> chirp<00:02:41.530> effect<00:02:41.860> sounds<00:02:42.220> to<00:02:42.340> me<00:02:42.459> like<00:02:42.490> it's

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
that chirp effect sounds to me like it's

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:44.870 
that chirp effect sounds to me like it's
exhaust<00:02:43.270> being<00:02:43.600> squeezed<00:02:44.020> to<00:02:44.230> a<00:02:44.290> small<00:02:44.620> hole

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
exhaust being squeezed to a small hole

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.260 
exhaust being squeezed to a small hole
so<00:02:45.880> they've<00:02:46.150> probably<00:02:47.020> enlarged<00:02:47.740> those<00:02:47.920> holes

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
so they've probably enlarged those holes

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:52.650 
so they've probably enlarged those holes
and<00:02:49.270> to<00:02:49.810> remove<00:02:50.200> that<00:02:50.670> chirp<00:02:51.670> at<00:02:52.180> least<00:02:52.390> that's

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
and to remove that chirp at least that's

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.510 
and to remove that chirp at least that's
the<00:02:52.870> way<00:02:52.930> I'm<00:02:53.110> reading<00:02:53.319> it<00:02:53.550> and<00:02:55.020> I<00:02:56.020> thought<00:02:56.520> it

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:57.520 
the way I'm reading it and I thought it

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:03.890 
the way I'm reading it and I thought it
would<00:02:57.640> be<00:02:57.790> interesting<00:02:57.910> to<00:02:58.540> see<00:03:00.510> how<00:03:01.510> far

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
would be interesting to see how far

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:11.370 
would be interesting to see how far
how<00:03:04.900> far<00:03:05.200> down<00:03:05.470> that<00:03:08.070> that<00:03:09.750> welded<00:03:10.750> pieces<00:03:10.960> so

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
how far down that that welded pieces so

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.790 
how far down that that welded pieces so
I'm<00:03:11.680> inserting<00:03:12.070> a<00:03:12.280> long<00:03:12.430> girl<00:03:12.670> get<00:03:13.620> to<00:03:14.620> that

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:14.800 
I'm inserting a long girl get to that

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.030 
I'm inserting a long girl get to that
point<00:03:15.040> and<00:03:15.310> just<00:03:15.970> my<00:03:16.870> rough<00:03:17.470> measurement<00:03:17.950> with

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
point and just my rough measurement with

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.580 
point and just my rough measurement with
my<00:03:18.160> fingers<00:03:18.520> and<00:03:18.990> putting<00:03:19.990> it<00:03:20.080> up<00:03:20.170> against<00:03:20.500> the

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
my fingers and putting it up against the

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.480 
my fingers and putting it up against the
bike<00:03:21.720> on<00:03:22.720> the<00:03:22.840> bottom<00:03:23.260> here<00:03:23.590> it<00:03:23.770> appears<00:03:23.920> that

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:24.490 
bike on the bottom here it appears that

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:27.240 
bike on the bottom here it appears that
it's<00:03:24.640> almost<00:03:25.030> into<00:03:25.600> the<00:03:26.250> called--it

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
it's almost into the called--it

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:28.860 
it's almost into the called--it
converter<00:03:27.700> so<00:03:28.030> there's<00:03:28.240> probably<00:03:28.330> a<00:03:28.540> piece<00:03:28.690> in

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
converter so there's probably a piece in

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:29.760 
converter so there's probably a piece in
here<00:03:28.990> that's<00:03:29.140> weld<00:03:29.320> again

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:29.770 
here that's weld again

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:34.110 
here that's weld again
so<00:03:30.370> I<00:03:30.780> on<00:03:31.780> like<00:03:32.680> 2010<00:03:33.250> newer<00:03:33.520> I<00:03:33.610> don't<00:03:33.910> think

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
so I on like 2010 newer I don't think

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.260 
so I on like 2010 newer I don't think
that<00:03:34.300> there's<00:03:34.480> really<00:03:34.570> a<00:03:34.810> reason<00:03:35.020> to<00:03:35.610> to<00:03:36.610> do

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:37.270 
that there's really a reason to to do

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:38.730 
that there's really a reason to to do
them<00:03:37.390> onto<00:03:37.600> the<00:03:37.870> exhaust<00:03:38.170> unless<00:03:38.590> you're

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:38.740 
them onto the exhaust unless you're

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:40.890 
them onto the exhaust unless you're
going<00:03:38.830> to<00:03:38.890> replace<00:03:39.130> the<00:03:39.310> whole<00:03:39.430> pipe<00:03:39.900> because

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
going to replace the whole pipe because

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.780 
going to replace the whole pipe because
I<00:03:41.470> don't<00:03:41.800> think<00:03:41.980> there's<00:03:42.100> any<00:03:42.250> trip<00:03:42.520> in<00:03:42.670> this

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
I don't think there's any trip in this

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:47.180 
I don't think there's any trip in this
alright<00:03:44.220> that's<00:03:45.220> what<00:03:45.430> it<00:03:45.490> appears<00:03:45.550> to<00:03:45.850> me<00:03:45.880> so

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
alright that's what it appears to me so

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.640 
alright that's what it appears to me so
so<00:03:48.360> I<00:03:49.360> was<00:03:49.780> thinking<00:03:50.020> about<00:03:50.050> drilling<00:03:50.440> it<00:03:50.530> out

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
so I was thinking about drilling it out

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.130 
so I was thinking about drilling it out
but<00:03:50.950> then<00:03:51.490> again<00:03:51.670> I'm<00:03:51.910> thinking<00:03:52.270> no<00:03:52.780> I<00:03:52.810> don't

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:53.140 
but then again I'm thinking no I don't

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:55.290 
but then again I'm thinking no I don't
think<00:03:53.170> so<00:03:53.320> I<00:03:53.590> think<00:03:53.770> I<00:03:53.950> won't<00:03:54.070> bother<00:03:54.250> I<00:03:54.670> don't

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:55.300 
think so I think I won't bother I don't

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:56.340 
think so I think I won't bother I don't
think<00:03:55.420> it's<00:03:55.510> going<00:03:55.600> to<00:03:55.660> gain<00:03:55.870> anything<00:03:56.110> all

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:56.350 
think it's going to gain anything all

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:58.380 
think it's going to gain anything all
just<00:03:56.530> going<00:03:56.620> to<00:03:56.680> do<00:03:56.830> is<00:03:57.060> open<00:03:58.060> up<00:03:58.090> the<00:03:58.209> exhaust

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390 
just going to do is open up the exhaust

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:59.850 
just going to do is open up the exhaust
make<00:03:58.630> it<00:03:58.750> louder<00:03:58.959> and<00:03:59.260> there<00:03:59.440> you<00:03:59.530> know<00:03:59.620> trip

00:03:59.850 --> 00:03:59.860 
make it louder and there you know trip

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.310 
make it louder and there you know trip
there<00:04:00.010> anyway<00:04:00.310> so<00:04:00.450> that's<00:04:01.450> what<00:04:02.080> I'm<00:04:02.170> going<00:04:02.260> to

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:02.320 
there anyway so that's what I'm going to

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:05.220 
there anyway so that's what I'm going to
do<00:04:02.470> I'm<00:04:02.650> gonna<00:04:02.860> leave<00:04:03.340> it<00:04:03.430> alone<00:04:04.110> yeah<00:04:05.110> the

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
do I'm gonna leave it alone yeah the

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:06.510 
do I'm gonna leave it alone yeah the
other<00:04:05.350> thing<00:04:05.530> I<00:04:05.590> was<00:04:05.709> thinking<00:04:05.770> about<00:04:06.010> too<00:04:06.310> was

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:06.520 
other thing I was thinking about too was

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:10.020 
other thing I was thinking about too was
that<00:04:07.050> some<00:04:08.050> of<00:04:08.140> the<00:04:08.200> US<00:04:08.950> models<00:04:09.459> and<00:04:09.670> Canadian

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
that some of the US models and Canadian

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.250 
that some of the US models and Canadian
models<00:04:10.300> may<00:04:10.390> not<00:04:10.540> necessarily<00:04:10.660> be<00:04:11.050> the<00:04:11.230> same

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.260 
models may not necessarily be the same

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.440 
models may not necessarily be the same
this<00:04:11.920> is<00:04:12.070> being<00:04:12.190> a<00:04:12.340> Canadian<00:04:12.550> model<00:04:13.030> is<00:04:13.180> kada

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450 
this is being a Canadian model is kada

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:15.930 
this is being a Canadian model is kada
model<00:04:13.750> sometimes<00:04:13.959> or<00:04:14.320> mean<00:04:14.519> for<00:04:15.519> a<00:04:15.550> worldwide

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 
model sometimes or mean for a worldwide

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.599 
model sometimes or mean for a worldwide
market<00:04:16.239> where<00:04:16.959> the<00:04:17.080> US<00:04:17.320> mark<00:04:17.620> market<00:04:18.459> is

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:18.609 
market where the US mark market is

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:21.470 
market where the US mark market is
slightly<00:04:19.090> different<00:04:19.390> and<00:04:19.690> the<00:04:20.190> EPA

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:21.480 
slightly different and the EPA

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.720 
slightly different and the EPA
specifications<00:04:22.480> and<00:04:22.660> are<00:04:22.720> for<00:04:23.440> the<00:04:23.680> US<00:04:24.550> market

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:24.730 
specifications and are for the US market

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:26.310 
specifications and are for the US market
lightly<00:04:25.240> different<00:04:25.570> than<00:04:25.660> say<00:04:25.780> the<00:04:25.810> worldwide

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 
lightly different than say the worldwide

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.770 
lightly different than say the worldwide
market<00:04:26.530> and<00:04:26.950> the<00:04:27.460> Canadian<00:04:27.850> the<00:04:28.330> Canadian

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
market and the Canadian the Canadian

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:30.480 
market and the Canadian the Canadian
bike<00:04:28.960> sometimes<00:04:29.290> are<00:04:29.680> slightly<00:04:29.890> different<00:04:30.340> so

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
bike sometimes are slightly different so

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:32.159 
bike sometimes are slightly different so
so<00:04:31.060> it<00:04:31.150> could<00:04:31.330> be<00:04:31.480> that<00:04:31.660> the<00:04:31.780> Canadian

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:32.169 
so it could be that the Canadian

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:34.380 
so it could be that the Canadian
Canadian<00:04:32.650> exhaust<00:04:33.250> is<00:04:33.460> different<00:04:34.120> and<00:04:34.300> that's

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:34.390 
Canadian exhaust is different and that's

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:36.720 
Canadian exhaust is different and that's
why<00:04:34.600> you've<00:04:34.750> got<00:04:34.870> the<00:04:34.990> chirp<00:04:35.520> down<00:04:36.520> in<00:04:36.640> the

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:36.730 
why you've got the chirp down in the

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:37.890 
why you've got the chirp down in the
ones<00:04:36.880> that<00:04:37.030> I've<00:04:37.120> seen<00:04:37.330> because<00:04:37.450> all<00:04:37.630> the<00:04:37.750> one

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 
ones that I've seen because all the one

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:38.970 
ones that I've seen because all the one
of<00:04:37.990> the<00:04:38.080> videos<00:04:38.320> I've<00:04:38.440> watched<00:04:38.650> it<00:04:38.770> all<00:04:38.860> from

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:38.980 
of the videos I've watched it all from

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:40.530 
of the videos I've watched it all from
the<00:04:39.070> states<00:04:39.310> so<00:04:39.460> that<00:04:40.060> could<00:04:40.210> be<00:04:40.240> one<00:04:40.390> of<00:04:40.480> the

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:40.540 
the states so that could be one of the

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:42.810 
the states so that could be one of the
reasons
