the<00:02:11.530> vault<00:02:11.709> of<00:02:11.800> glass<00:02:11.860> takes<00:02:12.310> place<00:02:12.580> on<00:02:12.730> Venus

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
the vault of glass takes place on Venus

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:14.910 
the vault of glass takes place on Venus
and<00:02:13.300> you<00:02:13.720> need<00:02:13.900> six<00:02:14.140> members<00:02:14.500> in<00:02:14.650> order<00:02:14.860> to

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
and you need six members in order to

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.490 
and you need six members in order to
play<00:02:15.130> the<00:02:15.760> recommendation<00:02:16.450> level<00:02:17.080> to<00:02:17.230> start

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
play the recommendation level to start

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.040 
play the recommendation level to start
is<00:02:17.680> 26<00:02:18.310> although<00:02:19.120> it<00:02:19.239> is<00:02:19.420> room<00:02:19.660> where<00:02:19.810> you<00:02:19.900> can

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
is 26 although it is room where you can

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.160 
is 26 although it is room where you can
play<00:02:20.200> at<00:02:20.290> a<00:02:20.349> lower<00:02:20.500> level<00:02:20.590> but<00:02:21.400> it's<00:02:22.269> not<00:02:22.690> it's

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
play at a lower level but it's not it's

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.070 
play at a lower level but it's not it's
not<00:02:23.739> smart<00:02:23.980> to<00:02:24.069> do<00:02:24.220> that<00:02:24.250> the<00:02:25.239> reason<00:02:25.540> that<00:02:25.780> is

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
not smart to do that the reason that is

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.540 
not smart to do that the reason that is
because<00:02:26.530> as<00:02:26.680> you<00:02:26.800> level<00:02:26.920> up<00:02:27.130> you<00:02:27.280> get<00:02:27.430> better

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
because as you level up you get better

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.460 
because as you level up you get better
weapons<00:02:27.970> you<00:02:28.150> get<00:02:28.269> better<00:02:28.450> armor<00:02:28.810> so<00:02:29.110> the

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
weapons you get better armor so the

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.199 
weapons you get better armor so the
higher<00:02:29.650> the<00:02:29.800> level<00:02:29.890> you<00:02:30.130> are<00:02:30.340> it'll<00:02:31.000> make<00:02:31.120> it

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
higher the level you are it'll make it

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:33.449 
higher the level you are it'll make it
just<00:02:31.360> a<00:02:31.420> little<00:02:31.450> bit<00:02:31.630> easier<00:02:31.810> for<00:02:32.230> you<00:02:32.319> and<00:02:32.530> in

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
just a little bit easier for you and in

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:35.070 
just a little bit easier for you and in
all<00:02:34.060> honesty<00:02:34.090> if<00:02:34.540> you're<00:02:34.630> gonna<00:02:34.750> have<00:02:34.900> six

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
all honesty if you're gonna have six

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.320 
all honesty if you're gonna have six
players<00:02:35.260> you<00:02:35.980> probably<00:02:36.400> want<00:02:36.640> to<00:02:36.819> plate<00:02:37.120> like

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
players you probably want to plate like

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.570 
players you probably want to plate like
ideally<00:02:37.959> two<00:02:38.170> players<00:02:38.500> of<00:02:38.799> each<00:02:39.040> class<00:02:39.310> so<00:02:39.549> you

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
ideally two players of each class so you

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.390 
ideally two players of each class so you
want<00:02:39.819> to<00:02:40.269> tightens<00:02:40.690> two<00:02:41.019> hunters<00:02:41.920> into

want to tightens two hunters into
warlocks<00:02:43.209> I<00:02:43.390> think<00:02:43.569> those<00:02:43.660> are<00:02:43.690> what<00:02:43.870> they're

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
warlocks I think those are what they're

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:47.610 
warlocks I think those are what they're
called<00:02:44.200> but<00:02:45.720> yeah<00:02:46.720> getting<00:02:47.140> to<00:02:47.230> the<00:02:47.319> vault<00:02:47.470> is

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
called but yeah getting to the vault is

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.809 
called but yeah getting to the vault is
super<00:02:48.280> super<00:02:48.700> easy<00:02:48.819> and<00:02:50.370> all<00:02:51.370> you<00:02:51.519> got<00:02:51.640> to<00:02:51.730> do

super super easy and all you got to do

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:53.699 
super super easy and all you got to do
is<00:02:51.849> go<00:02:52.090> to<00:02:52.150> your<00:02:52.209> orbit<00:02:52.630> select<00:02:53.200> Venus<00:02:53.530> and

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
is go to your orbit select Venus and

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:55.800 
is go to your orbit select Venus and
you'll<00:02:54.010> see<00:02:54.160> here<00:02:54.400> that<00:02:54.430> my<00:02:54.790> level<00:02:55.180> is<00:02:55.510> not

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:57.750 
you'll see here that my level is not
high<00:02:55.870> enough<00:02:56.079> to<00:02:56.470> unlock<00:02:56.739> the<00:02:56.890> raid<00:02:57.069> but<00:02:57.640> this

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
high enough to unlock the raid but this

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.789 
high enough to unlock the raid but this
is<00:02:57.880> where<00:02:58.030> you<00:02:58.120> find<00:02:58.360> it<00:02:58.569> I<00:02:58.780> am<00:02:59.470> guessing<00:02:59.650> that

locations of the raids the rage will be
at<00:03:05.319> different<00:03:05.590> locations<00:03:05.980> as<00:03:06.130> they<00:03:06.280> roll<00:03:06.430> out

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:06.549 
at different locations as they roll out

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:09.210 
at different locations as they roll out

it's<00:03:46.569> just<00:03:46.780> something<00:03:47.019> I<00:03:47.170> wouldn't

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
it's just something I wouldn't

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:48.840 
it's just something I wouldn't
personally<00:03:47.920> want<00:03:48.250> to<00:03:48.280> risk<00:03:48.430> you<00:03:48.579> can<00:03:48.700> also

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:48.850 
personally want to risk you can also

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:50.910 
personally want to risk you can also
search<00:03:49.120> for<00:03:49.180> clans<00:03:49.930> groups<00:03:50.380> and<00:03:50.590> that<00:03:50.709> kind<00:03:50.889> of

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
search for clans groups and that kind of

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.349 
search for clans groups and that kind of
thing<00:03:50.980> maybe<00:03:51.280> you'll<00:03:51.549> just<00:03:51.579> stumble<00:03:52.000> on

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:52.359 
thing maybe you'll just stumble on

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:54.660 
thing maybe you'll just stumble on
somebody<00:03:52.810> like<00:03:52.900> in<00:03:53.170> game<00:03:53.500> chat<00:03:53.799> or<00:03:54.069> whatever

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 
somebody like in game chat or whatever

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:56.640 
somebody like in game chat or whatever
around<00:03:55.239> the<00:03:55.329> game<00:03:55.480> that<00:03:55.690> you<00:03:56.170> know<00:03:56.260> works<00:03:56.470> for

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
around the game that you know works for

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.789 
around the game that you know works for
you<00:03:56.739> but<00:03:57.340> yeah<00:03:57.489> so<00:03:58.450> that's<00:03:59.079> where<00:03:59.319> the<00:03:59.650> vault

00:03:59.789 --> 00:03:59.799 
you but yeah so that's where the vault

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:02.250 
you but yeah so that's where the vault
of<00:04:00.040> glass<00:04:00.099> mission<00:04:00.989> specifically<00:04:01.989> I'm

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260 
of glass mission specifically I'm

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:03.569 
of glass mission specifically I'm
assuming<00:04:02.829> that<00:04:02.980> most<00:04:03.099> of<00:04:03.250> these<00:04:03.370> guidelines

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:03.579 
assuming that most of these guidelines

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:06.420 
assuming that most of these guidelines
will<00:04:03.940> probably<00:04:04.299> stay<00:04:04.840> about<00:04:05.079> the<00:04:05.139> same<00:04:05.430> but

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
will probably stay about the same but

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.819 
will probably stay about the same but
yeah<00:04:06.880> hopefully<00:04:07.120> it<00:04:07.660> helps<00:04:08.019> somewhat<00:04:08.530> it's

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:08.829 
yeah hopefully it helps somewhat it's

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:09.420 
yeah hopefully it helps somewhat it's
