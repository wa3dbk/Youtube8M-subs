and<00:02:17.050> I<00:02:17.350> like<00:02:17.560> it<00:02:17.710> how<00:02:17.800> some<00:02:18.070> people<00:02:18.340> think

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
and I like it how some people think

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:21.030 
and I like it how some people think
because<00:02:18.870> Nintendo<00:02:19.870> is<00:02:20.050> denying<00:02:20.560> that<00:02:20.860> there

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
would be a price drop that that means

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.080 
would be a price drop that that means
it's<00:02:23.080> not<00:02:23.140> going<00:02:23.410> to<00:02:23.530> happen<00:02:23.730> like<00:02:24.730> you<00:02:24.910> guys
