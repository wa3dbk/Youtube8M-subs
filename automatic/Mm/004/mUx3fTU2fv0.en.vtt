00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:51.980 
you open this trunk and you get the

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:56.380 
you open this trunk and you get the
manuals<00:01:52.370> and<00:01:52.960> why<00:01:54.100> I<00:01:55.100> really<00:01:55.700> like<00:01:55.880> that<00:01:56.210> the

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
manuals and why I really like that the

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.570 
manuals and why I really like that the
wire<00:01:56.810> matches<00:01:57.320> the<00:01:57.500> headphone<00:01:57.860> color<00:01:58.100> now<00:01:58.310> I

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:58.580 
wire matches the headphone color now I

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.460 
wire matches the headphone color now I
didn't<00:01:59.090> like<00:01:59.330> how<00:01:59.600> they<00:01:59.750> would<00:01:59.870> just<00:02:00.020> randomly

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 
didn't like how they would just randomly

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:12.190 
didn't like how they would just randomly
have<00:02:00.710> a<00:02:00.740> red<00:02:00.979> wire<00:02:01.390> with<00:02:02.390> like<00:02:09.310> I<00:02:11.200> watched

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
have a red wire with like I watched

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.410 
have a red wire with like I watched
videos<00:02:12.620> like<00:02:12.800> this<00:02:12.920> before<00:02:13.100> and<00:02:13.550> they<00:02:14.150> showed

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
videos like this before and they showed

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.199 
videos like this before and they showed
the<00:02:14.570> manual<00:02:14.930> and<00:02:15.170> I<00:02:15.700> thought<00:02:16.700> it<00:02:16.850> was<00:02:16.910> kind<00:02:17.150> of

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
the manual and I thought it was kind of

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:18.670 
the manual and I thought it was kind of
boring<00:02:17.450> it<00:02:17.810> just<00:02:17.989> shows<00:02:18.200> a<00:02:18.230> bunch<00:02:18.500> of

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:55.580 
would be my complaint these are really

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:58.629 
would be my complaint these are really
really<00:05:55.820> expensive<00:05:56.139> but<00:05:57.139> I<00:05:57.409> mean<00:05:57.830> they<00:05:58.400> seem

00:05:58.629 --> 00:05:58.639 
really expensive but I mean they seem

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:01.540 
really expensive but I mean they seem
pretty<00:05:58.849> durable<00:05:59.120> so

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:01.550 
pretty durable so

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:03.800 
pretty durable so
I'm<00:06:02.550> hoping<00:06:02.820> these<00:06:03.030> could<00:06:03.240> turn<00:06:03.420> out<00:06:03.540> real

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:03.810 
I'm hoping these could turn out real

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:07.130 
I'm hoping these could turn out real
good<00:06:03.990> I<00:06:05.180> can't<00:06:06.180> get<00:06:06.360> over<00:06:06.390> how<00:06:06.720> pretty<00:06:06.750> this

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:07.140 
good I can't get over how pretty this

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:10.640 
good I can't get over how pretty this
color<00:06:07.200> is<00:06:07.590> so<00:06:07.800> really<00:06:08.130> it's<00:06:08.400> my<00:06:08.580> favorite<00:06:09.620> so<00:06:10.620> I

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:10.650 
color is so really it's my favorite so I

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:15.920 
color is so really it's my favorite so I
could<00:06:10.800> just<00:06:10.980> be<00:06:11.480> jamming<00:06:12.480> out<00:06:14.090> all<00:06:15.090> right<00:06:15.300> well

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:15.930 
could just be jamming out all right well

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:20.480 
could just be jamming out all right well
I<00:06:16.290> guess<00:06:16.740> that's<00:06:17.100> the<00:06:17.220> Oh<00:06:19.190> got<00:06:20.190> to<00:06:20.280> show<00:06:20.430> you

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:20.490 
I guess that's the Oh got to show you

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:22.970 
I guess that's the Oh got to show you
the<00:06:20.580> inside<00:06:20.730> of<00:06:20.910> the<00:06:21.000> pouch<00:06:21.180> so<00:06:21.930> getting<00:06:22.890> the

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:22.980 
the inside of the pouch so getting the

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:25.070 
the inside of the pouch so getting the
pouch<00:06:23.130> looks<00:06:23.370> like<00:06:23.520> this<00:06:23.790> I<00:06:24.090> have<00:06:24.330> this<00:06:24.480> handle

on<00:06:25.230> it<00:06:25.470> you<00:06:26.460> could<00:06:26.670> just<00:06:26.870> carry<00:06:27.870> your

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:28.020

on it you could just carry your
headphones<00:06:29.060> la<00:06:30.060> dee<00:06:30.120> dee<00:06:30.420> Dawg<00:06:31.130> kind<00:06:32.130> of

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:32.190 
headphones la dee dee Dawg kind of

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:35.800 
headphones la dee dee Dawg kind of
inside<00:06:32.730> it's<00:06:33.180> like<00:06:33.330> cushiony<00:06:34.140> and<00:06:34.170> soft

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:35.810 
inside it's like cushiony and soft

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:37.880 
inside it's like cushiony and soft
probably<00:06:36.810> really<00:06:36.990> good<00:06:37.290> protection<00:06:37.530> for

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:37.890 
probably really good protection for

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:39.320 
probably really good protection for
headphones<00:06:38.430> and<00:06:38.640> then<00:06:38.760> it<00:06:38.850> has<00:06:39.000> this<00:06:39.120> little

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:39.330 
headphones and then it has this little

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:47.990 
headphones and then it has this little
pouch<00:06:39.800> for<00:06:40.800> your<00:06:40.910> cable<00:06:46.520> beyond<00:06:47.520> there

pouch for your cable beyond there

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.450

I<00:06:48.030> like<00:06:48.480> the<00:06:48.570> pouch<00:06:48.750> it's<00:06:49.410> kind<00:06:49.620> of<00:06:49.710> bulky<00:06:49.950> but

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:50.460 
I like the pouch it's kind of bulky but

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:54.350 
I like the pouch it's kind of bulky but
I<00:06:50.730> guess<00:06:51.300> the<00:06:51.540> headphones<00:06:51.900> are<00:06:53.000> kind<00:06:54.000> of<00:06:54.060> bulky

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:54.360 
I guess the headphones are kind of bulky

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:56.090 
I guess the headphones are kind of bulky
