00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
okay this is a the alley man i've been

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.880 
okay this is a the alley man i've been
using<00:00:05.400> zmodeler<00:00:05.790> for<00:00:06.390> quite<00:00:06.930> some<00:00:07.140> time<00:00:07.170> made

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
using zmodeler for quite some time made

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.850 
using zmodeler for quite some time made
a<00:00:07.919> couple<00:00:08.099> of<00:00:08.280> models<00:00:08.639> for<00:00:08.910> a<00:00:09.150> san<00:00:09.450> andreas<00:00:09.860> I'd

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
a couple of models for a san andreas I'd

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.900 
a couple of models for a san andreas I'd
like<00:00:11.040> to<00:00:11.190> show<00:00:11.400> you<00:00:11.429> how<00:00:11.820> to<00:00:12.530> texture<00:00:13.530> and

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:13.910 
like to show you how to texture and

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.000 
like to show you how to texture and
zmodeler<00:00:15.350> so<00:00:16.350> I'm<00:00:16.410> going<00:00:16.560> to<00:00:16.590> start<00:00:16.800> off<00:00:16.949> with

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
zmodeler so I'm going to start off with

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:25.029 
zmodeler so I'm going to start off with
the<00:00:17.750> making<00:00:18.750> a<00:00:18.840> simple<00:00:19.050> box<00:00:21.680> like<00:00:22.680> this<00:00:22.710> okay

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:25.039 
the making a simple box like this okay

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:30.200 
the making a simple box like this okay
and<00:00:26.039> I've<00:00:26.160> got<00:00:26.400> a<00:00:26.430> left<00:00:27.380> view<00:00:28.380> window<00:00:28.769> my<00:00:29.519> UV

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
and I've got a left view window my UV

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.440 
and I've got a left view window my UV
map<00:00:30.449> or<00:00:30.630> window<00:00:31.019> at<00:00:31.410> 3d<00:00:31.949> window<00:00:32.759> and<00:00:33.210> our

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
map or window at 3d window and our

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.770 
map or window at 3d window and our
prospective<00:00:34.050> window<00:00:34.350> opened<00:00:34.950> here<00:00:35.719> so<00:00:36.719> you

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
prospective window opened here so you

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.139 
prospective window opened here so you
can<00:00:36.960> see<00:00:36.989> here<00:00:37.640> here's<00:00:38.640> my<00:00:39.260> simple<00:00:40.260> little<00:00:41.149> box

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
can see here here's my simple little box

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.299 
can see here here's my simple little box
here<00:00:43.820> go<00:00:44.820> to<00:00:44.879> faces<00:00:45.480> mode<00:00:45.660> click<00:00:46.500> on<00:00:46.739> that<00:00:46.920> you

here go to faces mode click on that you

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:48.979 
here go to faces mode click on that you
can<00:00:47.370> tell<00:00:47.789> it's<00:00:47.969> in<00:00:48.090> phases<00:00:48.450> moves<00:00:48.660> could

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
can tell it's in phases moves could

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.639 
can tell it's in phases moves could
because<00:00:49.530> each<00:00:49.829> face<00:00:50.390> has<00:00:51.390> a<00:00:51.420> red<00:00:51.719> dot<00:00:51.960> in<00:00:52.199> the

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
texture layers i'm going to add that

texture layers i'm going to add that
texture<00:01:34.610> click<00:01:35.610> on<00:01:35.790> it<00:01:35.939> first<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:36.570> then<00:01:36.600> okay

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
texture click on it first and then okay

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.560 
texture click on it first and then okay
then<00:01:38.520> you<00:01:38.759> assign<00:01:39.240> to<00:01:39.540> selection

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:48.340 

there<00:01:43.470> you<00:01:43.590> go<00:01:45.890> as<00:01:46.890> you<00:01:47.130> can<00:01:47.250> tell<00:01:47.310> it's<00:01:47.700> not<00:01:47.790> in

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
there you go as you can tell it's not in

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.620 
there you go as you can tell it's not in
the<00:01:49.350> correct<00:01:49.530> way<00:01:49.950> or<00:01:50.340> you<00:01:50.850> know<00:01:50.940> the<00:01:51.060> sideways

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
the correct way or you know the sideways

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:59.830 
the correct way or you know the sideways
and<00:01:52.020> backwards<00:01:54.979> so<00:01:55.979> what<00:01:56.190> you<00:01:56.400> have<00:01:56.580> to<00:01:56.760> do<00:01:58.040> is

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
and backwards so what you have to do is

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:06.680 
and backwards so what you have to do is
to<00:02:01.400> create<00:02:02.400> a<00:02:02.430> new<00:02:04.610> mapping<00:02:05.610> texture<00:02:06.270> to<00:02:06.450> that

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:06.690 
to create a new mapping texture to that

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.240 
to create a new mapping texture to that
and<00:02:07.160> the<00:02:08.160> way<00:02:08.310> you<00:02:08.369> do<00:02:08.580> it<00:02:08.610> is<00:02:08.880> you<00:02:09.030> go<00:02:09.390> to<00:02:09.420> your

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
and the way you do it is you go to your

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.190 
and the way you do it is you go to your
vertex<00:02:11.250> mode<00:02:11.430> where<00:02:12.390> you<00:02:12.660> see<00:02:12.810> all<00:02:12.840> your

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
vertex mode where you see all your

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.000 
vertex mode where you see all your
vertices<00:02:14.130> on<00:02:14.400> the<00:02:14.820> whole<00:02:14.940> model<00:02:15.330> and<00:02:15.890> you<00:02:16.890> can

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
vertices on the whole model and you can

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.540 
vertices on the whole model and you can
see<00:02:17.160> the<00:02:17.280> normals<00:02:18.200> these<00:02:19.200> green<00:02:19.500> lines<00:02:19.800> from

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
see the normals these green lines from

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.740 
see the normals these green lines from
the<00:02:20.610> one<00:02:20.880> that<00:02:21.030> you<00:02:21.150> have<00:02:21.270> selected<00:02:23.540> you<00:02:24.540> want

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
the one that you have selected you want

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.040 
the one that you have selected you want
to<00:02:24.950> right<00:02:25.950> click<00:02:25.980> in<00:02:26.459> the<00:02:26.610> left<00:02:27.510> view<00:02:27.690> window

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
to right click in the left view window

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.930 
to right click in the left view window
because<00:02:28.739> that's<00:02:28.950> where<00:02:29.100> I<00:02:29.130> have<00:02:29.340> my<00:02:29.370> texture

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
because that's where I have my texture

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.420 
because that's where I have my texture
on<00:02:30.260> mapping<00:02:32.180> edit<00:02:33.180> UV<00:02:33.590> and<00:02:34.590> you<00:02:35.160> want<00:02:35.340> to

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
on mapping edit UV and you want to

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:41.210 
on mapping edit UV and you want to
generate<00:02:35.910> new<00:02:36.769> option<00:02:38.420> click<00:02:39.420> OK<00:02:39.810> and<00:02:40.650> you<00:02:41.010> see

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
generate new option click OK and you see

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.759 
generate new option click OK and you see
how<00:02:41.370> it<00:02:41.780> tile<00:02:42.780> the<00:02:43.050> texture<00:02:43.500> on<00:02:43.650> that<00:02:43.860> one<00:02:44.070> face

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:45.769 
how it tile the texture on that one face

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:47.990 
how it tile the texture on that one face
so<00:02:46.769> we're<00:02:46.920> going<00:02:47.010> to<00:02:47.130> have<00:02:47.220> to<00:02:47.370> adjust<00:02:47.760> that

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
so we're going to have to adjust that

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.860 
so we're going to have to adjust that
the<00:02:48.720> words<00:02:48.989> all<00:02:49.940> centered<00:02:50.940> in<00:02:51.690> this<00:02:51.900> one<00:02:52.110> area

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
the words all centered in this one area

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.289 
the words all centered in this one area
the<00:02:54.870> way<00:02:55.049> you<00:02:55.799> want<00:02:56.010> to<00:02:56.070> do<00:02:56.190> that<00:02:56.430> is<00:02:56.640> since

00:02:57.289 --> 00:02:57.299 
the way you want to do that is since

00:02:57.299 --> 00:02:58.910 
the way you want to do that is since
you've<00:02:57.480> got<00:02:57.660> it<00:02:57.810> textured<00:02:58.290> on<00:02:58.410> there<00:02:58.650> you<00:02:58.799> go
