00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:27.970
 how about friends welcome to a new edition of 8 bp 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.560
 my name is luciano hipólito 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.520
 how the custom white balance is done 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.310
 they see the previous injury 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:39.310
 oprah determined as super daylight 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.320
 st 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.320
 but what about lighting 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.640
 these predefined settings we can in these color dominant images that 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.070
 We do not understand 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.990
 in these cases we must make a 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:54.700
 defined by yourself 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:55.790
 or rather 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:56.950
 a white balance 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:58.510
 personalized 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.510
 let's say for example 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:05.200
 but outside 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.590
 besides the blue sky 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:08.850
 aside 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.600
 no red building on the other side 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.600
 in this situation it would be quite difficult to know 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.350
 inside the room 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.350
 and much less if we consider 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.450
 This is an ideal situation to apply a custom fit should 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:27.580
 do what 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.580
 the methodology is as follows 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.150
 white object removal photo 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.370
 we invite the camera that took that picture we just made as 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:40.370
 reference for the serena 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.200
 in the middle of the shooting 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.090
 we choose the option to get off the personalized car 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.300
 english 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:50.290
 that is all 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.290
 it may be the complicated one but it's actually quite easy 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.360
 now I show you how it is made with crumb 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.760
 because the procedure is a little bit with another model 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.780
 in synthesis the same 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.710
 and probably have a club 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.710
 everything in pc indicated for your camera 

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:12.139
 it amines the mind from time to time you have to place it 

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:15.759
 I'm going to photograph this stuffed animal 

00:02:17.719 --> 00:02:21.179
 create an endless background with a white cardboard 

00:02:21.179 --> 00:02:25.179
 Since I'm going to work in dim light, they probably need a speed 

00:02:25.179 --> 00:02:26.969
 pretty good duration 

00:02:26.969 --> 00:02:29.629
 for this reason mount the camera 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:32.299
 so that the photo 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:35.299
 it is important that they know the stuffed animal 

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:38.099
 The day is cloudy 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:41.099
 and although you do not notice 

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:46.729
 on the other hand loquillo of the bird 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:49.329
 so as a result 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:50.749
 inside the room 

00:02:50.749 --> 00:02:52.399
 also predictable 

00:02:52.399 --> 00:02:55.399
 but by doing something from my camera 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:59.579
 took the first picture 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:01.259
 in the result 

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:03.299
 the color is slightly off 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:04.719
 well the yellow 

00:03:04.719 --> 00:03:07.039
 I decide to take stock of the personalized car 

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:10.369
 even photograph a flat surface 

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:13.369
 you can use a sheet 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:15.879
 or any lunar surface 

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:17.059
 keep in mind 

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:20.489
 the telecinco group 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:23.649
 I tried to get it 

00:03:23.649 --> 00:03:25.979
 irene posed to gray photographic kaka 

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:28.769
 It is designed specifically for this purpose 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:31.909
 They are inexpensive and easily available on the internet 

00:03:32.839 --> 00:03:35.839
 omar labruna 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:39.519
 and took a picture 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:46.979
 lijo the píriz option I choose the palau 

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:48.139
 obama moved 

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:49.319
 but customized 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:50.399
 then 

00:03:50.399 --> 00:03:53.399
 the camera asks me to indicate which photo is going to be taken as 

00:03:53.999 --> 00:03:55.899
 for the custom serenade 

00:03:55.899 --> 00:03:58.899
 the ico the photograph that has parts 

00:04:00.279 --> 00:04:02.889
 immediately 

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:05.699
 and me without custom adjustment prayer 

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:07.869
 that is all 

00:04:07.869 --> 00:04:10.129
 took a picture our stuffed animal 

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:12.499
 to review what custom balance 

00:04:12.499 --> 00:04:14.669
 alarte has given good 

00:04:14.669 --> 00:04:16.719
 here it is 

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:19.719
 if we compare it with previous 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.849
 that's all for today I hope you liked it 

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:27.349
 and that they have learned 

00:04:27.349 --> 00:04:30.169
 I am pretty luciani and now I say goodbye 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:32.240
 a hug and we'll see each other in the next
