00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:14.300
 hello guys and girls from youtube me 

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.130
 dispute make a mini tutorial very 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:18.290
 zoom quickie mod for version 

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:19.940
 1.7 point 4 of minecraft and good to tell you 

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:21.529
 that this module that allows us to do 

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:23.750
 something similar what allows us to do 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:26.330
 optical in which is to zoom with the key 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.439
 control of our keyboard set the 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:30.770
 truth is that it's pretty enough 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:32.570
 well and a mushroom biome is pretty 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:34.370
 pretty good because that way easily 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.560
 let's control if enemies come to us 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:39.590
 what's beyond and well then 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:42.630
 quickly let's see 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:44.970
 everything we have right in front of us 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:47.399
 a question that you already asked me with the 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:50.460
 previous version with the 172 what happens if 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.110
 in the control key we have the zoom as 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.879
 let's run now or how are you going to 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.250
 compatibilizar good then it is simple you 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.839
 we give to escape because we have a zombie 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.480
 we give you escape we give you options 

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:02.910
 controls and we're going down here 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.979
 check here tells us to run now 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.020
 same have the same key as the mod 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.300
 Well, we are going to give you here and 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.869
 let's give for example to the alt vale so 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:14.130
 simple as this accept accept and 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.759
 come back then when I 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.570
 press alt I'm going to run 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:23.070
 Normally when we play minecraft 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:25.320
 we have the key in space that is 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.770
 we have the finger in space so 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.929
 that's good, we find it a bit 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:33.090
 complicated being able to change chases me 

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:34.730
 a little bit worth I do not know why it is 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.330
