things to this thing is made out of
plastic<00:02:31.190> and<00:02:31.610> I<00:02:31.730> could<00:02:31.940> see<00:02:32.180> that<00:02:32.300> potentially

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
plastic and I could see that potentially

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.190 
plastic and I could see that potentially
breaking<00:02:34.060> now<00:02:35.060> here<00:02:35.330> it's<00:02:35.450> here's<00:02:35.900> another

this<00:02:38.209> tripod<00:02:39.459> this<00:02:40.459> is<00:02:40.850> the<00:02:41.060> locking

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
this tripod this is the locking

this tripod this is the locking
mechanism<00:02:42.110> for<00:02:42.980> the<00:02:43.190> tilt<00:02:43.820> but<00:02:44.239> here's<00:02:44.480> the

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
mechanism for the tilt but here's the

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.670 
mechanism for the tilt but here's the
problem<00:02:45.220> this<00:02:46.220> thing<00:02:46.610> runs<00:02:47.239> into<00:02:47.690> this<00:02:48.350> thing

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
problem this thing runs into this thing

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.640 
problem this thing runs into this thing
if<00:02:49.010> you<00:02:49.100> try<00:02:49.310> to<00:02:49.370> loosen<00:02:49.640> it<00:02:49.910> too<00:02:50.090> much<00:02:50.330> it<00:02:51.140> runs

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
if you try to loosen it too much it runs

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.500 
if you try to loosen it too much it runs
into<00:02:52.180> this<00:02:53.180> little<00:02:53.510> bracket<00:02:54.070> that<00:02:55.070> attaches

into this little bracket that attaches
your<00:02:56.510> right<00:02:57.130> handle<00:02:58.130> now<00:02:58.820> there's<00:02:59.030> a<00:02:59.090> very

00:02:59.259 --> 00:02:59.269 
your right handle now there's a very

your right handle now there's a very
easy<00:02:59.420> workaround<00:03:00.230> for<00:03:00.320> this<00:03:00.470> problem<00:03:01.060> all<00:03:02.060> you

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
easy workaround for this problem all you

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:08.130 
easy workaround for this problem all you
have<00:03:02.780> to<00:03:02.930> do<00:03:03.140> is<00:03:04.870> detach<00:03:06.040> you<00:03:07.040> will<00:03:07.220> right

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
have to do is detach you will right

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.870 
have to do is detach you will right
handle<00:03:09.140> this<00:03:09.650> comes<00:03:09.950> right<00:03:10.220> off<00:03:10.250> you<00:03:10.700> can

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
handle this comes right off you can

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:16.140 
handle this comes right off you can
throw<00:03:11.120> it<00:03:11.180> away<00:03:11.239> and<00:03:12.580> your<00:03:13.690> tilt<00:03:14.690> lock<00:03:14.950> leaver

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
throw it away and your tilt lock leaver

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.810 
throw it away and your tilt lock leaver
no<00:03:17.150> longer<00:03:17.630> runs<00:03:18.260> into<00:03:18.650> it<00:03:18.800> another<00:03:19.340> sort<00:03:19.700> of

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:19.820 
no longer runs into it another sort of

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:23.370 
no longer runs into it another sort of
clever<00:03:20.360> thing<00:03:20.690> they<00:03:20.930> did<00:03:21.170> was<00:03:21.980> this<00:03:22.730> tilt<00:03:23.060> lock

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
clever thing they did was this tilt lock

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.310 
clever thing they did was this tilt lock
is<00:03:24.380> sort<00:03:24.739> of<00:03:24.800> like<00:03:24.950> a<00:03:24.980> wrench<00:03:25.489> that<00:03:25.850> you<00:03:26.000> can

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.320 
is sort of like a wrench that you can

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.350 
is sort of like a wrench that you can
pull<00:03:27.320> out<00:03:27.350> and<00:03:27.530> reposition<00:03:28.340> you<00:03:28.880> can<00:03:28.970> pull

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360 
pull out and reposition you can pull

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:30.030 
pull out and reposition you can pull
this<00:03:29.540> out

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
this out

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.560 
this out
pull<00:03:31.040> that<00:03:31.190> out<00:03:31.430> like<00:03:31.700> that<00:03:31.910> away<00:03:32.269> from<00:03:32.450> the

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:32.570 
pull that out like that away from the

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:34.780 
pull that out like that away from the
head<00:03:32.780> and<00:03:33.050> you<00:03:33.140> can<00:03:33.290> reposition<00:03:33.950> this<00:03:34.250> handle

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
head and you can reposition this handle

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:39.340 
head and you can reposition this handle
without<00:03:35.450> affecting<00:03:36.350> the<00:03:37.250> tilt<00:03:38.150> lock<00:03:38.360> so<00:03:39.260> if

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.350 
without affecting the tilt lock so if

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:42.160 
without affecting the tilt lock so if
you<00:03:39.470> do<00:03:39.620> decide<00:03:39.920> to<00:03:39.980> use<00:03:40.130> that<00:03:40.400> right<00:03:41.170> handle

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.170 
you do decide to use that right handle

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:43.780 
you do decide to use that right handle
which<00:03:42.470> is<00:03:42.590> attached<00:03:42.920> right<00:03:43.100> there<00:03:43.519> is

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
which is attached right there is

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.280 
which is attached right there is
possible<00:03:44.780> to<00:03:44.959> use<00:03:44.989> the<00:03:45.350> right<00:03:45.530> handle

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
possible to use the right handle

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.140 
possible to use the right handle
and<00:03:46.500> use<00:03:46.980> the<00:03:47.159> tilt<00:03:47.400> lock<00:03:47.549> but<00:03:47.790> it's<00:03:47.909> a<00:03:47.970> bit

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
and use the tilt lock but it's a bit

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.309 
and use the tilt lock but it's a bit
cumbersome<00:03:48.689> because<00:03:49.049> to<00:03:49.739> lock<00:03:50.010> or<00:03:50.280> unlock<00:03:50.459> or

00:03:51.309 --> 00:03:51.319 
cumbersome because to lock or unlock or

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:53.630 
cumbersome because to lock or unlock or
increase<00:03:52.319> or<00:03:52.470> decrease<00:03:52.620> the<00:03:53.040> drag<00:03:53.220> on<00:03:53.549> the

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
increase or decrease the drag on the

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.429 
increase or decrease the drag on the
tilt<00:03:53.879> you<00:03:54.420> have<00:03:54.540> to<00:03:54.659> pull<00:03:54.870> this<00:03:55.019> out<00:03:55.260> and

00:03:55.429 --> 00:03:55.439 
tilt you have to pull this out and

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:57.199 
tilt you have to pull this out and
reposition<00:03:56.040> it<00:03:56.159> so<00:03:56.310> it<00:03:56.549> seems<00:03:56.790> that<00:03:56.909> that

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
reposition it so it seems that that

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:58.970 
reposition it so it seems that that
right<00:03:57.569> handle<00:03:58.019> will<00:03:58.140> sort<00:03:58.379> of<00:03:58.439> add<00:03:58.709> it<00:03:58.860> on

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
right handle will sort of add it on

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.470 
right handle will sort of add it on
there<00:03:59.220> as<00:03:59.340> an<00:03:59.459> afterthought<00:04:00.000> and<00:04:00.120> they<00:04:00.239> didn't

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
there as an afterthought and they didn't

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.059 
there as an afterthought and they didn't
really<00:04:00.629> think<00:04:00.959> it<00:04:01.470> through<00:04:01.530> when<00:04:01.920> they<00:04:02.010> were

00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:02.069 
really think it through when they were

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:04.309 
really think it through when they were
designing<00:04:02.489> this<00:04:02.760> thing<00:04:03.049> now<00:04:04.049> another<00:04:04.230> thing

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:04.319 
designing this thing now another thing

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:07.580 
designing this thing now another thing
that<00:04:04.709> this<00:04:04.799> runs<00:04:05.129> into<00:04:05.489> is<00:04:05.810> this<00:04:06.810> lever<00:04:07.110> here

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
that this runs into is this lever here

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.259 
that this runs into is this lever here
the<00:04:07.799> tightening<00:04:08.250> lever<00:04:08.489> for<00:04:08.790> the<00:04:08.879> balance

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:09.269 
the tightening lever for the balance

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:12.619 
the tightening lever for the balance
plate<00:04:09.980> it<00:04:10.980> will<00:04:11.159> make<00:04:11.400> contact<00:04:11.970> with<00:04:12.120> that<00:04:12.299> but

00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:12.629 
plate it will make contact with that but

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:15.679 
plate it will make contact with that but
fortunately<00:04:13.290> this<00:04:14.040> locking<00:04:14.549> lever<00:04:14.819> does

00:04:15.679 --> 00:04:15.689 
fortunately this locking lever does

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:19.069 
fortunately this locking lever does
ratchet<00:04:16.380> in<00:04:16.530> the<00:04:16.620> same<00:04:16.949> way<00:04:17.250> as<00:04:17.609> the<00:04:18.359> tilt<00:04:18.900> lock

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 
ratchet in the same way as the tilt lock

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:21.319 
ratchet in the same way as the tilt lock
lever<00:04:19.380> you<00:04:19.889> just<00:04:20.100> pull<00:04:20.370> that<00:04:20.400> out<00:04:20.579> towards<00:04:21.150> you

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:21.329 
lever you just pull that out towards you

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:24.590 
lever you just pull that out towards you
and<00:04:21.780> you<00:04:21.870> can<00:04:22.049> reposition<00:04:22.620> the<00:04:23.160> lever<00:04:23.600> without

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 
and you can reposition the lever without

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.650 
and you can reposition the lever without
turning<00:04:25.440> the<00:04:25.620> screw<00:04:26.070> and<00:04:26.340> by<00:04:27.000> doing<00:04:27.210> that<00:04:27.360> you

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
turning the screw and by doing that you

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.360 
turning the screw and by doing that you
should<00:04:27.930> be<00:04:28.080> able<00:04:28.260> to<00:04:28.350> keep<00:04:28.500> it<00:04:28.680> out<00:04:28.889> of<00:04:29.100> the<00:04:29.190> way

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
of the tilt lock lever or you could just

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:42.320 
of the tilt lock lever or you could just
grind<00:04:34.830> it<00:04:35.010> down<00:04:35.220> using<00:04:35.460> power<00:04:35.789> tools<00:04:40.760> okay<00:04:41.760> now

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330

here and if you just loosen the lever a

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:00.379 
here and if you just loosen the lever a
little<00:04:56.340> bit<00:04:56.699> it<00:04:56.880> does<00:04:57.060> this<00:04:59.150> pretty<00:05:00.150> cool

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:00.389

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:39.900 
rather than a pneumatic one now of

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:41.390 
rather than a pneumatic one now of

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:43.530 
center column is that it prevents damage

down I've all done that thing where

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:50.089 
down I've all done that thing where

00:05:50.089 --> 00:05:50.099 
you're cranking up the center column you

00:05:50.099 --> 00:05:52.250 
you're cranking up the center column you
let<00:05:50.340> go<00:05:50.520> the<00:05:50.550> camera<00:05:51.060> and<00:05:51.240> somehow<00:05:51.479> you<00:05:51.659> forget

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:52.260 
let go the camera and somehow you forget

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:53.990 
let go the camera and somehow you forget
to<00:05:52.440> lock<00:05:52.620> down<00:05:52.830> the<00:05:53.010> center<00:05:53.280> column<00:05:53.430> and<00:05:53.909> the

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:54.000 
to lock down the center column and the

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.770 
to lock down the center column and the
camera<00:05:54.300> goes<00:05:54.479> crashing<00:05:55.200> down<00:05:55.380> about<00:05:55.710> two<00:05:55.979> feet

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:56.780 
camera goes crashing down about two feet

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:58.360 
camera goes crashing down about two feet
makes<00:05:56.930> a<00:05:57.020> really<00:05:57.230> loud<00:05:57.320> scary<00:05:57.830> noise<00:05:58.070> and<00:05:58.310> you

go holy crap my $2,000 camera that's not
funding<00:06:02.000> that<00:06:02.090> happens<00:06:02.510> with<00:06:03.350> this<00:06:03.590> it<00:06:04.070> can't

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:04.400 
funding that happens with this it can't

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.129 
funding that happens with this it can't
happen<00:06:04.610> but<00:06:05.090> you<00:06:05.270> do<00:06:05.389> have<00:06:05.570> to<00:06:05.690> deal<00:06:05.870> with<00:06:05.960> the

00:06:06.129 --> 00:06:06.139 
happen but you do have to deal with the

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:08.590 
happen but you do have to deal with the
whole<00:06:06.290> jack-in-the-box<00:06:07.220> thing<00:06:07.490> so<00:06:07.910> it's<00:06:08.450> just

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:08.600 
whole jack-in-the-box thing so it's just

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:10.540 
whole jack-in-the-box thing so it's just
kind<00:06:08.840> of<00:06:08.870> a<00:06:08.960> trade-off<00:06:09.230> it's<00:06:10.040> personal

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:10.550 
kind of a trade-off it's personal

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:12.159 
kind of a trade-off it's personal
preference<00:06:10.790> it<00:06:11.150> depends<00:06:11.510> which<00:06:11.750> thing<00:06:12.020> you'd

00:06:12.159 --> 00:06:12.169 
preference it depends which thing you'd

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:14.080 
preference it depends which thing you'd
rather<00:06:12.410> put<00:06:12.710> up<00:06:12.830> with<00:06:13.070> and<00:06:13.430> finally<00:06:13.850> there<00:06:14.060> is

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:14.090 
rather put up with and finally there is

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:16.960 
rather put up with and finally there is
one<00:06:14.360> more<00:06:14.510> thing<00:06:14.810> the<00:06:15.530> weight<00:06:15.800> this<00:06:16.190> tripod<00:06:16.730> is

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:16.970 
one more thing the weight this tripod is

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:18.879 
one more thing the weight this tripod is
not<00:06:17.240> light<00:06:17.750> by<00:06:18.080> any<00:06:18.320> stretch<00:06:18.710> of<00:06:18.740> the

00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:18.889 
not light by any stretch of the

00:06:18.889 --> 00:06:21.879 
not light by any stretch of the
imagination<00:06:19.240> it<00:06:20.240> weighs<00:06:20.810> just<00:06:21.139> over<00:06:21.710> 10

00:06:21.879 --> 00:06:21.889 
imagination it weighs just over 10

00:06:21.889 --> 00:06:23.980 
imagination it weighs just over 10
pounds<00:06:22.070> so<00:06:22.610> it's<00:06:22.790> definitely<00:06:23.210> not<00:06:23.510> something

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:23.990 
pounds so it's definitely not something

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:25.350 
pounds so it's definitely not something
you'd<00:06:24.110> want<00:06:24.290> to<00:06:24.320> go<00:06:24.440> backpacking<00:06:24.740> with

you'd want to go backpacking with

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.940 
you'd want to go backpacking with
however<00:06:26.360> that<00:06:26.810> could<00:06:27.020> also<00:06:27.139> be<00:06:27.320> an<00:06:27.500> advantage

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:27.950

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:29.270 
because that means it's going to be more
