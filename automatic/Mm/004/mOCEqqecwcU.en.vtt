however he's reached into his Moltres
which<00:01:37.079> is<00:01:37.259> also<00:01:37.530> very<00:01:37.860> good<00:01:37.979> position<00:01:38.340> for<00:01:38.579> him

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
which is also very good position for him

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.300 
which is also very good position for him
however<00:01:39.750> i<00:01:40.049> could<00:01:40.409> probably<00:01:40.590> out<00:01:40.799> speed<00:01:41.130> this

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
however i could probably out speed this

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.550 
however i could probably out speed this
thing<00:01:41.390> cuz<00:01:42.390> then<00:01:42.780> i<00:01:42.840> haven't<00:01:43.079> brought<00:01:43.200> i<00:01:43.409> have

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
thing cuz then i haven't brought i have

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.319 
thing cuz then i haven't brought i have
a<00:01:43.590> stone<00:01:44.070> edge<00:01:44.220> as<00:01:44.340> well<00:01:44.549> so<00:01:44.880> i'm<00:01:44.939> pretty<00:01:45.149> sure

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
a stone edge as well so i'm pretty sure

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.149 
a stone edge as well so i'm pretty sure
i<00:01:45.360> can<00:01:45.509> easily<00:01:45.840> kill<00:01:45.990> this<00:01:46.049> thing<00:01:46.110> off<00:01:46.409> and

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
i can easily kill this thing off and

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.260 
i can easily kill this thing off and
that's<00:01:47.280> what<00:01:47.340> was<00:01:47.460> going<00:01:47.610> to<00:01:47.670> try<00:01:47.729> to<00:01:47.820> pull<00:01:48.090> off

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
that's what was going to try to pull off

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.899 
that's what was going to try to pull off
or<00:01:48.479> what<00:01:48.570> its<00:01:48.689> plan<00:01:48.869> to<00:01:48.899> do<00:01:49.200> but<00:01:49.799> either<00:01:50.579> way

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
or what its plan to do but either way

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.600 
or what its plan to do but either way
storage<00:01:51.270> kills<00:01:51.570> him<00:01:51.720> so<00:01:51.990> good<00:01:52.710> i<00:01:52.979> was<00:01:53.310> really

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:28.379 
that is very nice for me I mean sure my

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:30.440 
that is very nice for me I mean sure my
defense<00:02:28.650> fell<00:02:28.920> but<00:02:29.189> I<00:02:29.430> mean<00:02:29.639> this<00:02:30.180> thing<00:02:30.420> is

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
defense fell but I mean this thing is

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.270 
defense fell but I mean this thing is
already<00:02:30.870> a<00:02:30.900> glass<00:02:31.139> cannon<00:02:31.650> pretty<00:02:31.889> much<00:02:32.040> as<00:02:32.159> it

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
already a glass cannon pretty much as it

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.610 
already a glass cannon pretty much as it
is<00:02:32.310> so<00:02:32.670> it's<00:02:32.760> not<00:02:32.849> a<00:02:32.909> big<00:02:33.090> deal<00:02:33.359> I<00:02:33.900> could<00:02:34.500> pretty

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
is so it's not a big deal I could pretty

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.170 
is so it's not a big deal I could pretty
much<00:02:34.680> died<00:02:34.980> from<00:02:35.250> any<00:02:35.459> other<00:02:35.549> attack<00:02:35.909> at<00:02:36.060> this

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
much died from any other attack at this

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.149
