00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.250 

I<00:00:00.060> think<00:00:00.329> what<00:00:00.450> we're<00:00:00.570> looking<00:00:00.900> at<00:00:01.020> is

00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:01.260 
I think what we're looking at is

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:03.560 
I think what we're looking at is
symmetry<00:00:02.010> and<00:00:02.340> that<00:00:02.550> creating<00:00:03.090> the<00:00:03.149> body<00:00:03.360> as<00:00:03.540> a

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:03.570 
symmetry and that creating the body as a

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.349 
symmetry and that creating the body as a
whole<00:00:03.689> that<00:00:04.110> the<00:00:04.319> body<00:00:04.529> works<00:00:05.040> best<00:00:05.580> in<00:00:05.850> whole

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
whole that the body works best in whole

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:08.240 
whole that the body works best in whole
and<00:00:06.600> if<00:00:07.290> there's<00:00:07.500> something<00:00:07.740> off<00:00:08.040> or

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
and if there's something off or

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.089 
and if there's something off or
asymmetrical<00:00:08.970> we<00:00:09.599> basically<00:00:09.870> don't<00:00:10.530> work<00:00:10.889> as

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
asymmetrical we basically don't work as

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.730 
asymmetrical we basically don't work as
well<00:00:11.130> we<00:00:12.000> use<00:00:12.599> the<00:00:12.780> expression<00:00:13.230> sticks<00:00:13.590> out

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
well we use the expression sticks out

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.379 
well we use the expression sticks out
like<00:00:13.769> a<00:00:13.920> sore<00:00:14.009> thumb<00:00:14.219> why<00:00:14.700> because<00:00:15.210> it's

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
like a sore thumb why because it's

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.150 
like a sore thumb why because it's
asymmetrical<00:00:16.049> why<00:00:16.529> does<00:00:16.680> someone<00:00:16.890> with<00:00:17.130> a

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
asymmetrical why does someone with a

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.760 
asymmetrical why does someone with a
limp<00:00:17.699> or<00:00:17.970> a<00:00:18.000> hunchback<00:00:18.810> stick<00:00:19.109> out<00:00:19.289> because<00:00:19.650> of

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
limp or a hunchback stick out because of

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.400 
limp or a hunchback stick out because of
asymmetry<00:00:20.100> and<00:00:20.580> also<00:00:21.300> even<00:00:21.720> in<00:00:21.810> architecture

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
asymmetry and also even in architecture

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.519 
asymmetry and also even in architecture
will<00:00:22.619> find<00:00:22.890> that<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.730> beautiful

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:24.529 
will find that the beautiful

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:26.870 
will find that the beautiful
surroundings<00:00:25.529> have<00:00:25.769> a<00:00:25.830> symmetry<00:00:26.400> about<00:00:26.550> them

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
surroundings have a symmetry about them

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.670 
surroundings have a symmetry about them
or<00:00:27.090> our<00:00:27.210> bodies<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:27.779> most<00:00:27.960> beautiful<00:00:28.470> and

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
or our bodies the most beautiful and

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.650 
or our bodies the most beautiful and
perfect<00:00:29.039> athletes<00:00:29.460> have<00:00:29.730> a<00:00:29.760> symmetry<00:00:30.300> to<00:00:30.510> them

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
perfect athletes have a symmetry to them

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.410 
perfect athletes have a symmetry to them
and<00:00:30.890> so<00:00:31.890> with<00:00:32.340> osteopathy<00:00:33.000> we're<00:00:33.120> trying<00:00:33.329> to

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
and so with osteopathy we're trying to

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.760 
and so with osteopathy we're trying to
restore<00:00:33.719> that<00:00:33.870> now<00:00:34.079> we<00:00:34.140> can't<00:00:34.380> always<00:00:34.559> get

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
restore that now we can't always get

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.459 
restore that now we can't always get
perfect<00:00:35.130> symmetry<00:00:35.510> but<00:00:36.510> when<00:00:36.870> I<00:00:36.899> start<00:00:37.350> I

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
perfect symmetry but when I start I

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.310 
perfect symmetry but when I start I
generally<00:00:37.920> start<00:00:38.090> from<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.270> bottom<00:00:39.390> looking

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
generally start from the bottom looking

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.500 
generally start from the bottom looking
at<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.590> length<00:00:40.800> of<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.040> leg<00:00:41.250> looking<00:00:42.239> at<00:00:42.390> the

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
at the length of the leg looking at the

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.799 
at the length of the leg looking at the
alignment<00:00:42.989> of<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.250> ankle<00:00:44.250> joints<00:00:44.809> Tunisian

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
alignment of the ankle joints Tunisian

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.319

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
motion as I move around I'm moving

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.840 
motion as I move around I'm moving
around<00:00:57.930> under<00:00:58.230> ankle<00:00:58.590> and<00:00:58.770> remain<00:00:59.160> ticking

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
external and internal rotation oh so

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.630 
external and internal rotation oh so
this<00:01:02.579> is<00:01:02.730> my<00:01:02.760> fascial<00:01:03.799> the<00:01:04.799> different<00:01:05.309> types

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
this is my fascial the different types

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.010 
this is my fascial the different types
of<00:01:07.970> manipulation<00:01:08.970> can<00:01:09.150> almost<00:01:09.479> all<00:01:09.840> be

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
of manipulation can almost all be

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.310 
of manipulation can almost all be
combined<00:01:10.380> in<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.799> palpation<00:01:11.430> and<00:01:12.320> the

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
combined in the palpation and the

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.200 
combined in the palpation and the
evaluation<00:01:13.979> I<00:01:14.100> tend<00:01:14.369> to<00:01:14.400> go<00:01:14.549> right<00:01:14.939> ahead<00:01:15.090> and

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
evaluation I tend to go right ahead and

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.240 
evaluation I tend to go right ahead and
treat<00:01:15.479> people<00:01:15.840> when<00:01:16.470> I<00:01:16.500> look<00:01:16.770> at<00:01:16.920> her

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
treat people when I look at her

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.770 
treat people when I look at her
asymmetry<00:01:17.880> in<00:01:18.000> her<00:01:18.090> pelvis<00:01:18.420> she's<00:01:18.570> got<00:01:18.750> a

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
asymmetry in her pelvis she's got a

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.149 
asymmetry in her pelvis she's got a
little<00:01:18.960> bit<00:01:19.140> more<00:01:19.350> tightness<00:01:19.770> on<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.009> right

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
little bit more tightness on the right

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.820 
little bit more tightness on the right
side<00:01:20.369> than<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.729> left<00:01:20.759> side<00:01:21.119> so<00:01:21.960> if<00:01:22.470> you<00:01:22.619> slide

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
side than the left side so if you slide

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.560 
side than the left side so if you slide
beggar<00:01:23.100> also<00:01:23.400> into<00:01:23.580> one<00:01:23.700> more<00:01:23.880> food<00:01:24.090> so<00:01:24.450> we're

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
beggar also into one more food so we're

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:25.399 
beggar also into one more food so we're
going<00:01:24.659> to<00:01:24.750> treat<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:25.049> righty<00:01:25.200> if<00:01:25.320> you're

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
going to treat the righty if you're

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.350 
going to treat the righty if you're
around<00:01:25.740> it<00:01:25.979> and<00:01:26.159> Felicia<00:01:27.000> you're<00:01:27.180> going<00:01:27.299> to

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
around it and Felicia you're going to

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.960 
around it and Felicia you're going to
push<00:01:27.479> against<00:01:27.720> me<00:01:27.900> and<00:01:28.500> relax<00:01:28.770> push<00:01:29.610> against

have command or swimming how much horse
you<00:01:38.380> put<00:01:40.799> now<00:01:41.799> you're<00:01:41.950> going<00:01:42.070> to<00:01:42.130> turn<00:01:42.280> over

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
you put now you're going to turn over

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:50.719 
you put now you're going to turn over
when<00:01:43.930> your<00:01:44.049> belly<00:01:44.140> face<00:01:44.440> down<00:01:47.580> so<00:01:48.720> you<00:01:49.720> look<00:01:49.990> at

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
when your belly face down so you look at

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.710 
when your belly face down so you look at
the<00:01:51.729> sacrum<00:01:52.270> take<00:01:52.450> a<00:01:52.479> big<00:01:52.659> breath<00:01:52.780> in<00:01:54.659> why<00:01:55.659> do

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:55.720 
the sacrum take a big breath in why do

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.940 
the sacrum take a big breath in why do
we<00:01:55.899> call<00:01:56.080> this<00:01:56.140> the<00:01:56.500> sacred<00:01:56.920> bone<00:01:57.509> sacred<00:01:58.950> and

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
we call this the sacred bone sacred and

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:01.440 
we call this the sacred bone sacred and
the<00:02:00.040> idea<00:02:00.280> is<00:02:00.340> gentlemen<00:02:00.759> if<00:02:00.970> it's<00:02:01.119> changed

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
the idea is gentlemen if it's changed

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:10.710 
the idea is gentlemen if it's changed
station<00:02:02.910> come<00:02:03.910> home<00:02:04.060> sacred<00:02:07.679> ok<00:02:09.179> alright<00:02:10.179> take

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
station come home sacred ok alright take

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.910 
station come home sacred ok alright take
a<00:02:10.750> big<00:02:10.840> breath<00:02:11.050> in<00:02:13.110> so<00:02:14.110> which<00:02:14.290> came<00:02:14.530> first<00:02:14.800> the

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
a big breath in so which came first the
