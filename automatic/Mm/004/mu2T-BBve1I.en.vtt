00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:05.260
 No 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:12.819
 tomorrow evening 

00:00:12.819 --> 00:00:16.439
 have the fastest car or power it's handling 

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:18.669
 the car of the 

00:00:18.669 --> 00:00:21.669
 you have to allow the most here 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.970
 this new 911 infuses respect the vents Peter Spuhler 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.860
 CEO Rick Nash and Identi ca I understand 35 am he has that too 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:41.030
 and the testers at 145 pounds less than a new study give check 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:47.410
 However, the gt 2 costs significantly more force a hundred 90 00 euros for braking 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:48.550
 standard 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:54.430
 Rennsport capable brake discs made of carbon Tirard not there 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.789
 the engine makes 50 hp more than the 911 Turbo is always standing 

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:00.690
 530 hp 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.550
 1044 kilos curb weight Heine explosive mixture 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.620
 that had to 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.520
 but also change because our series are very fun 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.290
 give yourself to equip that means so with the electronic 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.290
 components 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:25.560
 among the guests 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.220
 next to the tracks and there it is already 30% you needed the Verden 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.260
 for the time being 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.750
 a guardian angel will give you with the hitherto out of you gray 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.940
 we have to make it over seven airbags everywhere 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:51.280
 it's both an impressive build here when your own brothers build three 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.280
 Weeks a year 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.550
 due to the time it is like a house 

00:02:12.279 --> 00:02:15.599
 Lusebrink slow motion the steering on needed they are not does not hang 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:17.259
 that is suddenly coming 

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:21.499
 like real race car and mostly also these reasons polls is very 

00:02:21.499 --> 00:02:24.499
 we do not have to impress by the minute 

00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:32.229
 "Never have such a powerful Sauter 

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:34.769
 and still this borderline 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:38.749
 the 1930 in the first round with disability very well 

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:47.420
 a nervous shrug back from the gt is amazingly easy to drive 

00:02:52.669 --> 00:02:56.989
 the races were once again the racing athletes' tribute in the eye 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:59.989
 Stopwatch for the lap times, for example 

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:07.629
 or the folding backrests of the bucket seats an unusual 

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:11.649
 Property for such Susann styled especially since no one can sit behind 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:17.989
 she drives this powerhouse enough 

00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:26.949
 the gp2 pushes unbelievable descendants 

00:03:29.389 --> 00:03:30.989
 in the three big victories and 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:33.359
 Now he should crack the Tempo 100 mark 

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:37.539
 The speed jumps upwards as if you were the gas 

00:03:43.529 --> 00:03:49.069
 after eleven seconds to stand 200 on the clock and leaves at 329 kilometers per 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:50.639
 Hour to be over 

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:51.620
 the GTI 2 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.810
 is definitely the strongest to see
