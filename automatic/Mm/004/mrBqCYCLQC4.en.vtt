that's<00:03:18.840> I<00:03:19.170> think<00:03:19.530> it's<00:03:19.650> really<00:03:19.800> important<00:03:20.130> to

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
that's I think it's really important to

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.350 
that's I think it's really important to
think<00:03:20.310> about<00:03:20.430> what<00:03:20.700> else<00:03:20.730> they're<00:03:20.970> going<00:03:21.270> to

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
think about what else they're going to

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:22.760 
think about what else they're going to
implementing<00:03:21.900> you<00:03:22.140> know<00:03:22.170> that<00:03:22.530> they<00:03:22.650> have

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:22.770 
implementing you know that they have

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:24.080 
implementing you know that they have
something<00:03:23.130> lined<00:03:23.310> up<00:03:23.459> we<00:03:23.640> don't<00:03:23.820> know<00:03:23.910> exactly

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
something lined up we don't know exactly

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.460 
something lined up we don't know exactly
what<00:03:24.570> it<00:03:24.690> is<00:03:24.890> I'm<00:03:25.890> sure<00:03:26.250> that<00:03:27.000> we'll<00:03:27.780> see<00:03:28.080> it

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
what it is I'm sure that we'll see it

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.380 
what it is I'm sure that we'll see it
implemented<00:03:29.100> with<00:03:29.490> stuff<00:03:29.820> like<00:03:29.880> battlefield

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
implemented with stuff like battlefield

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.080 
implemented with stuff like battlefield
4<00:03:30.630> and<00:03:31.220> different<00:03:32.220> EA<00:03:32.340> games<00:03:32.670> up<00:03:32.850> they'll<00:03:33.000> be

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
4 and different EA games up they'll be

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.370 
4 and different EA games up they'll be
releasing<00:03:33.690> for<00:03:34.020> now<00:03:34.140> on<00:03:35.480> they<00:03:36.480> they<00:03:36.959> tried

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
releasing for now on they they tried

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.930 
releasing for now on they they tried
with<00:03:37.770> SimCity<00:03:38.700> to<00:03:39.180> have<00:03:39.390> the<00:03:39.600> always-online

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
with SimCity to have the always-online

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.680 
with SimCity to have the always-online
thing<00:03:41.940> and<00:03:42.150> and<00:03:42.330> that<00:03:42.630> that<00:03:42.900> failed<00:03:43.370> massively

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
thing and and that that failed massively

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:46.760 
thing and and that that failed massively
especially<00:03:45.690> around<00:03:45.780> launched<00:03:46.380> its<00:03:46.590> just

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:46.770 
especially around launched its just

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:48.560 
especially around launched its just
people<00:03:46.890> can<00:03:47.400> get<00:03:47.550> into<00:03:47.700> the<00:03:47.730> games<00:03:48.120> it<00:03:48.480> was

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.570 
people can get into the games it was

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:50.840 
people can get into the games it was
taking<00:03:48.930> forever<00:03:49.050> to<00:03:49.350> log<00:03:49.620> in<00:03:49.890> and<00:03:50.070> there<00:03:50.700> was<00:03:50.730> a

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
taking forever to log in and there was a

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:52.610 
taking forever to log in and there was a
lot<00:03:51.120> of<00:03:51.150> issues<00:03:51.360> surrounded<00:03:51.959> on<00:03:52.110> that<00:03:52.380> and

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
lot of issues surrounded on that and

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.160 
lot of issues surrounded on that and
that<00:03:53.400> could<00:03:53.580> have<00:03:53.700> been<00:03:53.790> a<00:03:53.850> learning<00:03:54.209> step<00:03:54.600> for

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
that could have been a learning step for

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:56.840 
that could have been a learning step for
them<00:03:55.320> they<00:03:55.560> could<00:03:55.739> have<00:03:55.860> looked<00:03:56.220> at<00:03:56.430> that<00:03:56.580> and

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
them they could have looked at that and

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:59.090 
them they could have looked at that and
been<00:03:57.060> okay<00:03:57.450> that<00:03:57.660> didn't<00:03:57.930> work<00:03:57.989> well<00:03:58.410> how<00:03:58.890> can

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
been okay that didn't work well how can

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:00.590 
been okay that didn't work well how can
we<00:03:59.130> make<00:03:59.370> this<00:03:59.430> better<00:03:59.760> the<00:03:59.970> next<00:04:00.000> time<00:04:00.300> and

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
we make this better the next time and

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.030 
we make this better the next time and
continuing<00:04:01.230> with<00:04:01.380> the<00:04:01.500> always-online

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040

this I don't know I there haven't been
any<00:04:50.760> details<00:04:51.330> released<00:04:51.720> on<00:04:52.020> the<00:04:52.170> current

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 
any details released on the current

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.440 
any details released on the current
online<00:04:52.680> passes<00:04:53.130> what's<00:04:53.730> going<00:04:53.940> to<00:04:54.000> go<00:04:54.120> on<00:04:54.150> with

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:54.450 
online passes what's going to go on with

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:56.060 
online passes what's going to go on with
those<00:04:54.600> I<00:04:54.900> would<00:04:55.320> imagine<00:04:55.410> that<00:04:55.770> they're<00:04:56.040> just

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.070 
those I would imagine that they're just

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:58.610 
those I would imagine that they're just
going<00:04:56.340> to<00:04:56.430> continue<00:04:57.110> eventually<00:04:58.110> maybe<00:04:58.320> like

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:58.620 
going to continue eventually maybe like

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:59.930 
going to continue eventually maybe like
a<00:04:58.650> year<00:04:58.920> from<00:04:59.070> now<00:04:59.130> they'll<00:04:59.490> just<00:04:59.670> say<00:04:59.820> like

00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940 
a year from now they'll just say like

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:01.580 
a year from now they'll just say like
okay<00:05:00.210> well<00:05:00.360> online<00:05:00.510> passes<00:05:00.900> no<00:05:01.260> longer

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:01.590 
okay well online passes no longer

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:04.160 
okay well online passes no longer
relevant<00:05:02.090> although<00:05:03.090> i<00:05:03.150> would<00:05:03.390> guess<00:05:03.840> for<00:05:04.110> the

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:04.170 
relevant although i would guess for the

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:05.660 
relevant although i would guess for the
majority<00:05:04.470> of<00:05:04.650> those<00:05:04.800> games<00:05:05.010> that<00:05:05.280> those

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:05.670 
majority of those games that those

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:07.820 
majority of those games that those
servers<00:05:06.000> will<00:05:06.300> be<00:05:06.330> shut<00:05:06.630> down<00:05:06.690> i<00:05:07.170> would

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:07.830 
servers will be shut down i would

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:09.470 
servers will be shut down i would
imagine<00:05:07.890> that<00:05:08.160> only<00:05:08.430> battlefield<00:05:08.940> 3<00:05:09.270> would<00:05:09.450> be

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:09.480 
imagine that only battlefield 3 would be

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.240 
imagine that only battlefield 3 would be
the<00:05:09.720> thing<00:05:09.870> to<00:05:09.930> continue<00:05:10.500> through<00:05:10.890> from<00:05:11.100> that

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:11.250 
the thing to continue through from that

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:15.380 
the thing to continue through from that
maybe<00:05:11.550> mass<00:05:11.850> effect<00:05:12.210> 3<00:05:12.480> as<00:05:12.600> well<00:05:12.630> but<00:05:14.270> so<00:05:15.270> we

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:15.390 
maybe mass effect 3 as well but so we

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:16.190 
maybe mass effect 3 as well but so we
don't<00:05:15.540> know<00:05:15.660> if<00:05:15.750> there's<00:05:15.900> going<00:05:16.020> to<00:05:16.110> be<00:05:16.140> any

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:16.200 
don't know if there's going to be any

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.830 
don't know if there's going to be any
kind<00:05:16.410> of<00:05:16.560> retroactive<00:05:17.360> things<00:05:18.360> for<00:05:18.600> that

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:18.840 
kind of retroactive things for that

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.620 
kind of retroactive things for that
however<00:05:19.620> in<00:05:20.400> the<00:05:20.520> future<00:05:20.850> any<00:05:21.120> games<00:05:21.420> that<00:05:21.570> are

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:21.630 
however in the future any games that are

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:22.730 
however in the future any games that are
going<00:05:21.720> to<00:05:21.780> be<00:05:21.900> coming<00:05:21.930> out<00:05:22.230> within<00:05:22.440> the<00:05:22.590> next

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:22.740 
going to be coming out within the next

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:24.830 
going to be coming out within the next
couple<00:05:23.430> months<00:05:23.850> there<00:05:24.150> will<00:05:24.180> know<00:05:24.420> though

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:24.840 
couple months there will know though

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.990 
couple months there will know though
there<00:05:25.260> will<00:05:25.410> be<00:05:25.590> no<00:05:25.770> online<00:05:26.040> passes<00:05:26.460> for<00:05:26.880> that

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.000 
there will be no online passes for that

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.370 
there will be no online passes for that
so<00:05:27.480> you<00:05:27.540> guys<00:05:27.630> don't<00:05:27.810> have<00:05:27.900> to<00:05:28.020> worry<00:05:28.230> about

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:28.380 
so you guys don't have to worry about

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:30.920 
so you guys don't have to worry about
that<00:05:28.500> you<00:05:28.710> can<00:05:28.830> buy<00:05:28.950> the<00:05:29.010> game<00:05:29.250> used<00:05:29.550> and<00:05:30.510> have

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:30.930 
that you can buy the game used and have

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.980 
that you can buy the game used and have
access<00:05:31.470> to<00:05:31.650> the<00:05:31.770> online<00:05:31.890> content<00:05:32.840> like<00:05:33.840> i<00:05:33.870> said

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:33.990

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:36.560 
access to the online content like i said
i<00:05:34.140> think<00:05:34.380> it's<00:05:34.500> a<00:05:34.590> good<00:05:34.710> move<00:05:34.770> for<00:05:35.220> EA<00:05:35.570> it's

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:36.570 
i think it's a good move for EA it's

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:39.020 
i think it's a good move for EA it's
guarding<00:05:37.110> them<00:05:37.320> some<00:05:37.620> good<00:05:37.950> press<00:05:38.310> in<00:05:38.610> which

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:39.030 
guarding them some good press in which

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:41.120 
guarding them some good press in which
they've<00:05:39.360> had<00:05:39.690> some<00:05:39.960> really<00:05:40.230> bad<00:05:40.620> press

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:41.130 
they've had some really bad press

they've had some really bad press
recently<00:05:42.020> so<00:05:43.020> good<00:05:43.170> for<00:05:43.350> them<00:05:43.730> let's<00:05:44.730> hope
