00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.690
 hello everyone with you maracasi you are watching 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:09.750
 transfer chic position issue 98 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:13.769
 So let's start with a good position on the map. 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:16.260
 the Arctic in the g8 square you will need 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.980
 Pretty smart heavy tank with durable 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.949
 the tower 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.699
 drive here as fast as possible at the beginning 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.890
 fight 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:26.029
 here of course there is a chance to 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:29.189
 grab and although this rarely happens 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:31.769
 here you can perfectly tank due 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:35.300
 terrain mostly of course 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:37.820
 the enemy is seen only in ldm and 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.000
 the tower will therefore pierce you 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.910
 complicated 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.989
 you yourself would be perfectly able to shoot at 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:48.930
 enemies who are in front if u 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.850
 tank better and than i-7 then 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.809
 here you can only stick out 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.840
 one tower 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.719
 but it's worth noting that this place fits 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.969
 only for more or less fast cars 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.460
 because otherwise you can just from here 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.500
 do not get out except that you can like this 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.900
 right here lean out and shoot at 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.210
 opponents who are already on top 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.780
 is generally position quite 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.780
 not bad 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:19.190
 another good position on the map 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:21.710
 polar in square d 1 you will need 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:24.560
 a tank with good military ones is desirable 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:27.410
 so that the towers were strong and 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.660
 take this position the beginning of the battle from here 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:32.240
 you will be able to shoot at enemies 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:35.330
 that protrude into the square c 2 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:38.420
 quite often there are enemies attacking and you 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:40.640
 you can shoot from here at the expense of 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.310
 relief you can hide your body 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:46.340
 You can generally go completely to the safe 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.660
 to recharge the drum for example of course 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.730
 there is art 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:52.250
 this is probably the main drawback of this 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:54.770
 positions but still because of the uneven 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:57.140
 relief art here often smears 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:01.040
 Of course, it is desirable to go here if you're a 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:03.560
 In general, there is no generally a good position for 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:06.680
 causing damage and defo 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:10.010
 I recommend this direction to her 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:12.340
 tank like t57 heavy can with drum 

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:14.930
 Immediately even pretty good 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:18.410
 The following positions we have on 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:20.390
 map map in square g9 I would 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.870
 would say that this position is more 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:26.150
 Suitable for Fri-Sau but the player could 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:29.390
 nice to play and square 2 as you 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.920
 do you understand his disguise is bad and with 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.560
 his something 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:36.500
 it should always glow but not here 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:39.610
 he stood calmly behind this bush 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:42.500
 which is in g9 square and 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:45.200
 tune damage and not glow that is 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:48.020
 the place allows you to shoot perfectly 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.780
 opponents and do not even glow with a tank 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:53.180
 bad disguise this position I'm 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:56.030
 first recommend if your 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:59.120
 the allies went to the forest and act there 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:01.790
 active distracts attention in 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.709
 in this case, opponents are unlikely to pass 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.950
 further and will not shine you and you can 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:09.290
 ok to do that damage and you will 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.570
 be safe following 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:14.630
 position is on the tundra map in 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:16.370
 square one I often drive here 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:19.070
 because I think that at low levels 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:23.090
 it is really very useful and 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:26.590
 positions and for it you will need a very 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:28.959
 fast tank with good disguise and 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:31.580
 preferably also with good visibility 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:33.800
 climb on this slide you could 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:36.050
 to see that in the beginning I could not call in 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:39.290
 overclocking though you can do it by 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:42.410
 at least on t71 and on my tree 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:44.709
 get you done and how can you 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:47.780
 see a great view from here 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:50.540
 opponents who attack in square f 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:53.510
 1 and not substituted and you can perfectly 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:56.810
 deal damage to them and not shine 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:59.060
 This is the main advantage of this position . 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:02.120
 you yourself can often highlight 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:04.549
 enemies and it is very good but 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:07.160
 the disadvantage of this position is 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:09.380
 that opponents may not 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.900
 hold back your allies and then they 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:14.599
 will pass on will not stand here and 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:16.400
 you canâ€™t shoot new ones 

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:19.430
 because there will interfere with the mountain 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:22.400
 the whole position is very good for everyone 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:25.580
 I recommend for such tanks as e25 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:28.760
 Ideal just fit probably yourself in 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:31.430
 make sure of this and so on 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:32.180
 Today's position is also on the map 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:35.530
 tundra 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:39.380
 I had to and very long and carefully 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:42.500
 look out for a long time could not call on 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:44.870
 In general, this little mountain needs to be taken quite 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:48.440
 big overclocking and go just like that 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:50.990
 by the way now I drove here otherwise you 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:53.539
 spend a lot of time and nerves 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:56.530
 so you can call very quickly and without 

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:59.300
 problems position is actually very 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:02.270
 interesting she is suitable for very 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:04.850
 fast tanks with good disguise and 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:07.419
 preferably with a good overview from here you 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:09.830
 can sweep a huge territory 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:12.260
 opponents here shines constantly in 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:14.750
 different places and you can perfectly 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:19.190
 Damage to them is especially convenient here with 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:20.780
 towers on a tank like the t67 also stand 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:22.669
 note that you can sometimes here 

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:24.610
 highlight someone though rarely in 

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:27.710
 mostly you shoot at someone else's glare 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:29.539
 but if enemies are far away you 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:32.570
 you can shoot at them and at the same time 

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:34.849
 they themselves will not shine this position 

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:36.919
 I recommend still using on 

00:05:34.849 --> 00:05:38.020
 low levels since it is much 

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:40.300
 safer 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:42.759
 well and on it all friends thanks for
