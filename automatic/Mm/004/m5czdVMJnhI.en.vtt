00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
I made a replica of his Firefly but I

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.580 
I made a replica of his Firefly but I
cut<00:00:51.149> off<00:00:51.270> my<00:00:51.360> bath<00:00:51.660> I<00:00:51.899> don't<00:00:52.170> know<00:00:52.260> if<00:00:52.350> you<00:00:52.410> did

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.850 
cut off my bath I don't know if you did
that<00:00:52.620> but<00:00:53.059> instead<00:00:54.059> of<00:00:54.210> half<00:00:54.510> inch<00:00:54.719> PVC<00:00:55.140> I<00:00:55.590> used

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
that but instead of half inch PVC I used

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.610 
that but instead of half inch PVC I used
happen<00:00:56.399> some<00:00:56.640> PVC<00:00:56.969> so<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.660> it's<00:00:58.170> a<00:00:58.379> tighter

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
happen some PVC so the it's a tighter

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.700 
happen some PVC so the it's a tighter
fit<00:00:58.770> and<00:00:59.430> they<00:00:59.579> don't<00:00:59.760> have<00:00:59.940> to<00:01:00.149> use<00:01:00.270> the

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
fit and they don't have to use the

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.450 
fit and they don't have to use the
Vulcan<00:01:01.710> chains<00:01:02.039> so<00:01:03.030> and<00:01:03.570> I've<00:01:04.260> got<00:01:04.470> my<00:01:04.680> Titan

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
Vulcan chains so and I've got my Titan

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.510 
Vulcan chains so and I've got my Titan
scatter<00:01:05.909> was<00:01:06.180> on<00:01:06.930> mouth<00:01:07.320> I'm<00:01:07.830> not<00:01:08.100> sure<00:01:08.159> what

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
scatter was on mouth I'm not sure what

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.850 
scatter was on mouth I'm not sure what
type<00:01:08.700> of<00:01:08.840> inch<00:01:09.840> that<00:01:10.110> is<00:01:10.170> I<00:01:10.350> think<00:01:10.590> it's<00:01:10.770> like

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
three inch male it's a female and then I

just like taped and superglue it all
around<00:01:15.420> like<00:01:15.750> for<00:01:15.960> like<00:01:16.049> 20<00:01:16.590> minutes<00:01:16.770> took

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
around like for like 20 minutes took

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.380 
around like for like 20 minutes took
like<00:01:17.430> three<00:01:17.790> days<00:01:18.000> to<00:01:18.270> dry<00:01:18.619> up<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:20.580> the

times<00:05:51.730> using<00:05:52.730> still<00:05:53.480> I<00:05:53.780> could<00:05:54.590> see<00:05:54.860> that<00:05:55.070> one

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:55.310 
times using still I could see that one

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:58.630 
times using still I could see that one
but<00:05:56.300> I<00:05:56.330> could<00:05:56.690> not<00:05:56.870> see<00:05:57.170> the<00:05:57.200> first<00:05:57.530> one<00:05:57.830> to<00:05:58.130> be
