 everyone welcome back to this their 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.589
 video blog about technology 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.799
 f5 to be updated on everything 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:09.799
 what has 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:16.769
 what has to do with the world 

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:16.769
 technological 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.859
 every day we can realize 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:33.500
 how technology integrates much more 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:35.840
 to our daily life the things that 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.090
 we use the clothes that we wear 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.460
 even the food that we eat 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.980
 depends a lot on the technology that 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.930
 we have currently dreamed you are 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.629
 my friend ever having a house 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:49.550
 like the one that has the magnate bill gates 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:52.460
 or like any star has 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.800
 of rock a house of those that with a single 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.329
 applaud or with a push of a button you 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.119
 turn on the lights turn on the fireplace 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:01.309
 the bathtub is turned on, well you are 

00:00:59.119 --> 00:01:04.040
 technologies applied to homes are 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:05.689
 domotic flame the pharmacy is the set 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.659
 of technologies that are incorporated to 

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:10.280
 control and automate a home a 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:12.619
 building so that the life of the 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.080
 people that inhabit these enclosures be 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:18.229
 much simpler and much more 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:20.960
 cool but not so much let's talk 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:22.790
 see what is a smart home we went 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.229
 to the Monterrey shopping center and there 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.750
 we found one with some characters 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:29.120
 quite particular let's see what it was 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:32.120
 they tell us 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.120
 but 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.479
 and how are we talking about home automation 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.610
 technology smart homes 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:41.810
 applied to the houses we came for the 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.670
 Monterrey shopping center where 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.970
 there is precisely a smart house 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:49.760
 that although I was a bit into a movie 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.750
 house is fully automated let's go 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.200
 to see what he has in the house 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.200
 put it 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:59.600
 and my whole family is super technological 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.580
 super cool come here is going to 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.350
 present my parents welcome to 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.270
 our smart little house and the young 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.650
 is asking her daughter here 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.149
 where the walls were left is that 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.070
 imagine after what is this 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.930
 little gift this is a day gift of 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:14.330
 mothers of my lady wife doÃ±a silvia 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.590
 true there is a lot of money no more or less 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.660
 because it 's that I bought all that 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.180
 technology but I do not marry for 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:22.400
 true walls then why and my 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.140
 lady also made my advance my 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.819
 Father's day gift is true to her 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:29.359
 he gave me this 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:29.359
 Y 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:37.099
 It's a biometric sheet and that's what he wants 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.629
 say it has no longer return to 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:40.970
 use keys because the key is 

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:42.769
 is the true fingerprint and that 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:47.150
 It works very simple, but I can 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:49.549
 try to see if the plate that is what 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.079
 more mysterious fact for example if 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:52.430
 we activate the sheet and you put your 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:55.220
 fingerprint for example will happen to you 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:57.790
 days supply 112 percent serious and 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.790
 make released 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.790
 Thank you 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:14.600
 with pleasure my lord in this house 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.710
 we have the audiovisual part you have 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.710
 he is a martyr and in his house 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:23.260
 you did not teach me you are already obsolete 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:24.760
 true why why is that better 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.099
 said we have these devices 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.230
 smart which allows you 

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:31.000
 to navigate in any social network or in 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.220
 any page to catch if it was 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.620
 start is to click on any of the 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.390
 applications that you want and can 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.890
 navigate the stuff you can be in 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:41.110
 social networks and Alava in their 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.030
 cable system the thing is that these 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:45.370
 devices you can be browsing 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:47.409
 and everything that reproduces it and in the 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.659
 cited television is going to sound through 

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:51.489
 a digital connection 500 watts of sound 

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:53.790
 in that device that we have there is 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:53.790
 true 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:11.250
 bracelets spoke with the bad dress of 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:11.250
 babuchas and did not see 

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:17.530
 good in the monster in the light is true 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:19.840
 I'm going to show you also from here 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:22.510
 and from here what is the difference between 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:24.670
 both of them so I can contribute if this one is supported 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:26.890
 for any part is true this is not 

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:30.840
 because it 's connected to light and this one 

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:30.840
 need wifi wafa 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:40.180
 wifi we are transporting you and the music 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:42.250
 that that he did not show them because 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:44.680
 see one in each part of your house you can 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:46.540
 put a very music producing list 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:49.980
 different jets to have several 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:52.550
 serious environment 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:52.550
 do not 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:03.040
 no good I'm not in the mood I've already gone 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:05.020
 that stage of life is as good as 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:07.539
 will show you 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:10.840
 because the room is where we are 

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:15.060
 it's true we put any song if 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:15.060
 it's good we saw them volume 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:33.220
 always speaks so so hard my lord 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:33.220
 this the chirivel are like that 

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:42.450
 oh my god is also well not 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:44.010
 see then I'm going to tell you a little something 

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:46.740
 that I learned this week true 

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:48.330
 it turns out that from that phone 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:50.880
 I can call my cousin who is 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:53.940
 there in the usa, I see it 

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:57.660
 she sees me and guess how much is worth how much 

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:59.760
 free free margin because it works with 

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:02.040
 ip telephony what does that mean that 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:03.990
 work with internet is true the test 

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:06.810
 that's very good because one no longer pays 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:10.190
 telephony no no not only internet the one of 

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:10.190
 the house always 

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:18.690
 there are many things we can do 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:21.390
 by means of home automation to apply the 

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:24.210
 new technologies to our homes to 

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:26.970
 our office to the house of the bride 

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:28.920
 because it does not make life much easier 

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:31.350
 to people if you are thinking 

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:33.600
 for example in applying a lot of technology 

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:35.610
 to his house counselors the first one and to 

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:37.560
 this is local 027 of the center 

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:39.450
 commercial monterrey guides you so that 

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:41.220
 always be informed and documented 

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:43.410
 about the things that you are going to put in your 

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:45.750
 home technological things do not forget
