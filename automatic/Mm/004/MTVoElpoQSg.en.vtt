00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.880 
on images when we click on the images
tab<00:03:33.330> you'll<00:03:33.600> see<00:03:33.780> that<00:03:33.930> for<00:03:34.140> parameters<00:03:34.740> and

under<00:03:35.130> image<00:03:35.430> size<00:03:35.610> we<00:03:35.880> set<00:03:36.060> it<00:03:36.180> to<00:03:36.210> 960<00:03:36.990> by<00:03:37.170> 360

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
under image size we set it to 960 by 360

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.550 
under image size we set it to 960 by 360
and<00:03:38.250> that's<00:03:39.060> the<00:03:39.240> reason<00:03:39.720> that<00:03:39.750> I<00:03:39.930> changed<00:03:40.410> the

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
and that's the reason that I changed the

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.260 
and that's the reason that I changed the
dimensions<00:03:41.100> of<00:03:41.190> that<00:03:41.220> rectangle<00:03:41.550> I<00:03:41.970> wanted<00:03:42.209> to

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
keep it the same size to ensure the

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.820 
keep it the same size to ensure the
least<00:03:45.150> amount<00:03:45.450> of<00:03:45.600> issues<00:03:45.810> when<00:03:46.320> rendering

00:06:24.569 --> 00:06:26.329 
we can see the photo slider and it's our
web<00:06:24.719> designer<00:06:25.020> and<00:06:25.259> it<00:06:25.500> transitions<00:06:26.099> through

00:06:26.329 --> 00:06:26.339 
web designer and it transitions through

00:06:26.339 --> 00:06:27.800 
web designer and it transitions through
the<00:06:26.460> photos<00:06:26.819> just<00:06:26.849> like<00:06:27.240> it<00:06:27.419> did<00:06:27.599> in<00:06:27.719> the

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:27.810 
the photos just like it did in the

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:30.439 
the photos just like it did in the
preview<00:06:28.229> so<00:06:28.949> that's<00:06:29.189> how<00:06:29.370> you<00:06:29.430> integrate<00:06:30.270> the

00:06:30.439 --> 00:06:30.449 
preview so that's how you integrate the

00:06:30.449 --> 00:06:33.409 
preview so that's how you integrate the
code<00:06:30.779> that's<00:06:31.050> necessary<00:06:31.770> to<00:06:32.759> display<00:06:33.270> the

00:06:33.409 --> 00:06:33.419 
code that's necessary to display the

00:06:33.419 --> 00:06:34.909 
code that's necessary to display the
photo<00:06:33.629> slider<00:06:33.930> now<00:06:34.110> we're<00:06:34.319> not<00:06:34.500> done<00:06:34.889> yet

00:06:34.909 --> 00:06:34.919 
photo slider now we're not done yet

00:06:34.919 --> 00:06:38.990 
photo slider now we're not done yet
that's<00:06:35.909> only<00:06:36.240> part<00:06:36.750> of<00:06:36.810> how<00:06:37.289> to<00:06:37.979> integrate<00:06:38.399> the

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:39.000 
that's only part of how to integrate the

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.180 
that's only part of how to integrate the
photo<00:06:39.240> slider<00:06:39.569> you've<00:06:40.259> gotten<00:06:40.649> to<00:06:40.800> face

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:41.190 
photo slider you've gotten to face

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:43.190 
photo slider you've gotten to face
to<00:06:41.490> where<00:06:41.790> you<00:06:41.910> have<00:06:42.150> the<00:06:42.330> proper<00:06:42.720> codes<00:06:42.960> and

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:43.200 
to where you have the proper codes and

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:45.590 
to where you have the proper codes and
therefore<00:06:43.530> to<00:06:43.680> display<00:06:44.130> but<00:06:44.940> there's<00:06:45.420> gonna

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:45.600 
therefore to display but there's gonna

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:48.620 
therefore to display but there's gonna
be<00:06:45.690> a<00:06:45.870> follow<00:06:46.230> up<00:06:46.350> tutorial<00:06:46.950> after<00:06:47.100> this<00:06:47.630> that

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:48.630 
be a follow up tutorial after this that

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:51.080 
be a follow up tutorial after this that
will<00:06:48.870> show<00:06:49.170> you<00:06:49.230> the<00:06:49.410> final<00:06:49.890> process<00:06:50.430> of

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:51.090 
will show you the final process of

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:53.390 
will show you the final process of
getting<00:06:51.480> everything<00:06:51.720> taken<00:06:52.260> care<00:06:52.440> of<00:06:52.470> so<00:06:53.130> make

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:53.400 
getting everything taken care of so make

I<00:06:57.750> just<00:06:57.990> wrote<00:06:58.200> to<00:06:58.860> make<00:06:59.040> sure<00:06:59.190> that<00:06:59.340> it<00:06:59.490> saves

00:06:59.750 --> 00:06:59.760 
I just wrote to make sure that it saves

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:01.010 
I just wrote to make sure that it saves
everything<00:07:00.180> and<00:07:00.360> if<00:07:00.420> you<00:07:00.450> wanted<00:07:00.810> so<00:07:00.990> you

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:01.020 
everything and if you wanted so you

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:03.860 
everything and if you wanted so you
could<00:07:01.260> regenerate<00:07:01.620> this<00:07:02.010> placeholder<00:07:02.340> if<00:07:02.870> you

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:03.870 
could regenerate this placeholder if you

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:04.520 
could regenerate this placeholder if you
want<00:07:04.110> to

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:04.530 
want to

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:06.380 
want to
I<00:07:04.560> might<00:07:04.980> regenerate<00:07:05.610> it<00:07:05.730> just<00:07:06.000> to<00:07:06.090> see<00:07:06.270> if

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:06.390 
I might regenerate it just to see if

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:09.080 
I might regenerate it just to see if
it'll<00:07:06.630> display<00:07:07.170> it<00:07:07.500> correctly<00:07:07.860> and<00:07:08.190> if<00:07:08.940> it

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:09.090 
it'll display it correctly and if it

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:11.060 
it'll display it correctly and if it
does<00:07:09.270> great<00:07:09.690> if<00:07:09.840> it<00:07:09.990> doesn't<00:07:10.380> I'll<00:07:10.740> probably

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:11.070 
does great if it doesn't I'll probably

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:13.310 
does great if it doesn't I'll probably
just<00:07:11.310> revert<00:07:11.670> back<00:07:11.850> to<00:07:12.090> the<00:07:12.210> way<00:07:12.360> it<00:07:12.480> was<00:07:12.660> yeah

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:13.320 
just revert back to the way it was yeah

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:15.230 
just revert back to the way it was yeah
see<00:07:13.560> it<00:07:13.650> doesn't<00:07:14.040> do<00:07:14.280> too<00:07:14.490> well<00:07:14.700> sometimes

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:15.240 
see it doesn't do too well sometimes

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:17.150 
see it doesn't do too well sometimes
