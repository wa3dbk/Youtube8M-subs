first<00:00:13.440> of<00:00:13.620> all<00:00:13.679> straight<00:00:14.040> talk<00:00:14.219> is<00:00:14.400> a<00:00:14.519> service

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
first of all straight talk is a service

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.290 
first of all straight talk is a service
provider<00:00:15.000> just<00:00:15.900> like<00:00:16.139> AT&amp;T<00:00:16.590> and<00:00:17.010> t-mobile<00:00:17.300> now

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
provider just like AT&amp;T and t-mobile now

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.150 
provider just like AT&amp;T and t-mobile now
the<00:00:18.720> reason<00:00:18.869> I<00:00:19.080> say<00:00:19.109> they're<00:00:19.439> just<00:00:19.740> like<00:00:19.859> AT&amp;T

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
the reason I say they're just like AT&amp;T

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.279 
the reason I say they're just like AT&amp;T
and<00:00:20.520> t-mobile<00:00:20.699> is<00:00:21.150> because<00:00:21.539> they<00:00:21.750> use<00:00:21.779> the

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
and t-mobile is because they use the

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.130 
and t-mobile is because they use the
same<00:00:22.560> towers<00:00:23.130> that<00:00:23.580> are<00:00:23.640> used<00:00:24.029> by<00:00:24.269> AT&amp;T<00:00:24.689> and

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
same towers that are used by AT&amp;T and

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.349 
same towers that are used by AT&amp;T and
t-mobile<00:00:25.320> so<00:00:26.160> you<00:00:26.220> get<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:26.670> same<00:00:26.970> type<00:00:27.330> of

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
t-mobile so you get the same type of

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.120 
t-mobile so you get the same type of
connectivity<00:00:28.050> and<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.680> same<00:00:28.890> type<00:00:29.099> of

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
connectivity and the same type of

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.370 
connectivity and the same type of
service<00:00:29.609> coverage<00:00:30.029> as<00:00:30.240> you<00:00:30.779> would<00:00:31.019> with

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
service coverage as you would with

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.729 
service coverage as you would with
companies<00:00:31.769> like<00:00:31.800> AT&amp;T<00:00:32.460> and<00:00:32.820> t-mobile<00:00:33.030> now<00:00:33.989> the

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
companies like AT&amp;T and t-mobile now the

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.229 
companies like AT&amp;T and t-mobile now the
reason<00:00:34.920> this<00:00:35.190> is<00:00:35.250> good<00:00:35.550> is<00:00:35.730> because<00:00:35.910> they<00:00:36.180> are

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
reason this is good is because they are

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.150 
reason this is good is because they are
sharing<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:36.750> service<00:00:37.140> and<00:00:37.350> you<00:00:37.829> get<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.129> same

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
sharing the service and you get the same

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.389 
sharing the service and you get the same
connectivity<00:00:38.790> as<00:00:39.210> you<00:00:39.840> would<00:00:40.050> with<00:00:40.230> them<00:00:40.469> but

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
connectivity as you would with them but

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.119 
connectivity as you would with them but

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
at fraction of the price now they have
