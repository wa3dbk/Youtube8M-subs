 very good how it talks to you about my painting 

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:08.300
 It's a great pleasure to be here with you and 

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:10.190
 today I bring you something interesting good that 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.930
 make me take the attention and call 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:12.800
 I thought maybe maybe I could 

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:14.960
 interest you too 

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:18.289
 and is that in the last days I've been 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.580
 reading this book of get rich in a 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:22.730
 click 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:25.460
 by the name it is a bit commercial 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:28.100
 not really the name get rich with 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:32.210
 a click as it is not too commercial 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:35.540
 no but but it is a book that despite the 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:38.300
 title is super good because it speaks a 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.910
 little of everything that is the market that 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:43.130
 unites both click bread as adwords as 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.840
 all the tools that have 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.430
 revolutionized the way of doing 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.460
 internet marketing 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:52.280
 then it's super interesting I'm 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:55.160
 reading and explain it and ending 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.649
 half more or less and really you 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:01.399
 I advise colors too that if you can 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:02.690
 they're going to find you and Marc Ostrovski is 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:05.900
 the author 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:09.590
 and good is a person Marc Ostrovski 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:13.310
 that he has bought or bought in his day 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:18.200
 the business.com domain that is 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:20.810
 negocios.com for 150 thousand dollars or more or 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:25.700
 minus 150 thousand 200 thousand dollars acquired 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:29.409
 this domain in the year 1997 and four 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:32.299
 years later or a few years later 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:36.740
 this domain sold this same domain 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:39.890
 for 7.5 million dollars then 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.810
 good is a guy who knows what he says 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.810
 it's good that you have a book as you see 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.970
 pretty pretty fat and how nice that 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.979
 basically it's very interesting because 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.509
 as you see is a person who does 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:51.860
 business that made a big business 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:54.070
 selling this domain for seven 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.440
 million and a half dollars 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:58.780
 and well, it really is very advisable 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.690
 read this kind of books because they put you 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.700
 the world renews energy and 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.380
 true that they teach you many things 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.930
 because here you can also find 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.590
 information about click for information 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:13.570
 about organic positioning 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.610
 about resources in a lot of things the 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:17.380
 I really recommend it highly 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.890
 I know if I imagine that the version existed 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:23.080
 also for the Anglo market and others and 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:26.020
 yes it can be good but I recommend 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:28.060
 enormously because as a follower I think 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:30.520
 that I must bring you the best and in this 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:34.330
 case then of this book of marc 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:36.400
 ostrovski is a good book about everything 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.260
 for people who are already better maybe 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.360
 If you are very advanced, it really has 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.790
 your time in this market may 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.800
 you already know perfectly how it works 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:48.130
 in google adwords how some work 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.540
 certain things but good you found 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.519
 advancing the book you will realize 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.170
 that if very interesting things 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:56.740
 small concepts that can serve you 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:58.420
 of a lot and that without a doubt reading the book 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:01.050
 come new ideas and we will try to 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:04.050
 implement the mothers to what it is about 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:06.270
 also something very curious is that in the 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:08.790
 back cover appear several 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:10.710
 comments not from people who have read a 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.650
 book and good if you are I do not know if it 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:16.410
 appreciates well enough but one 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:20.310
 from one of the comments below all 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:23.310
 is made by mike hill sein I do not know if 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.600
 you know him but michael sheen is one of 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.700
 the most influential people of the 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:29.370
 online marketing industry and the 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.080
 creator of great big products 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.360
 digital 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:36.210
 it's good that they've been 22 with a lot 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:38.610
 success on the internet then good you 

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:40.140
 I usually advise that you read it on 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:42.690
 specific comment of mike philipsen 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:45.060
 says internet is a mixture of art 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:46.710
 science and knowledge combined for 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.120
 the permanent search for treasure 

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:49.710
 hidden 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:53.040
 Marc has shown that it is possible 

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:54.780
 success again and again if 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.790
 they want to make money from home to 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:59.220
 complete or partial time make serve 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.330
 with one click is your good book this is a 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:03.570
 commentary 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:05.610
 supporting the author to marko strovs ti 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:08.640
 from part of ivory without president and ceo 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:09.959
 marketing dot com dotcom then 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:14.700
 We have a comment from stephen 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:17.190
 covey yang james smith et cetera no and 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:19.470
 well the truth is that it is really super 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.640
 well I recommend it highly and good 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.210
 the truth that I did not find by 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:26.100
 curiosity one day one afternoon waiting 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:28.290
 for my partner so I got into a 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:31.890
 bookstore and I went to the section of 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:33.660
 economy and I found this one that is then 

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:35.280
 super good as I already tell you I'm 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:37.470
 finishing it and 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:39.540
 I really advise you if you can 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:41.520
 approach a bookstore and ask 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:44.490
 through the forest that you do not read because it is 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:47.610
 very very good and good can you give a 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:49.440
 a complementary vision of what is already 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:52.260
 you have until today not 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:55.500
 about this west world market much 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:58.930
 people are surprised sometimes the other day 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:01.360
 it happened something very strange is that 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:04.990
 come home some people to the 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:07.270
 new office where I am now and said 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:10.030
 not me but if it's true that you can 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:12.400
 earn money online, or look 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:15.789
 to what extent society or still 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:18.789
 people are not cultured in 

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:20.889
 this sense that they do not yet believe themselves 

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:23.440
 that money can be made online 

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:27.880
 obviously the title of this book is a 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:29.830
 little excessive get rich in one click is 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:33.639
 the classic promise not of all 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:35.620
 we are fed up but specifically the book 

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:37.750
 beyond the title because it is very 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:39.699
 well but we all know that it is impossible 

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:41.560
 get rich in a click what yes 

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:44.289
 we know is that there are many people winning 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:47.650
 a lot of money and that really internet 

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:48.910
 it is already the substrate on which they begin 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:51.009
 to work most of the 

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:53.470
 companies today is saying a 

00:05:51.009 --> 00:05:56.530
 company that does not have a good 

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:58.630
 technology a good system or that its 

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:59.870
 way of working is not very linked 

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:05.540
 to the field 

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:08.360
 of the internet or let's say to the places 

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:11.300
 most visited digital and Facebook 

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:13.040
 twitter type and so on so do not have 

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:15.950
 presence there today with a 

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:19.520
 company whether it's a hairdresser a bar 

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:21.500
 a gym does not matter, it means 

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:24.680
 lose a lot of money not have a presence 

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:26.210
 there then good in the book the truth 

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:28.910
 I recommend you get rich click 

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:31.640
 of frames trotsky is super good and 

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:33.980
 good on the other hand then comments before 

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:36.680
 that detail not of that still much 

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:39.590
 People today wonder what I do 

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:41.840
 I record videos here in my house if 

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:43.730
 I earn money without organs and could he 

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:46.070
 win it if you could win money to 

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:48.950
 through the internet and well the truth is 

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:51.470
 yes the truth is that yes and now good 

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:52.900
 yes in the year 2012 you still do not go 

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:54.940
 believing 

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:57.699
 you just have to wait a few years 

00:06:54.940 --> 00:07:00.009
 to begin to see how still more the 

00:06:57.699 --> 00:07:02.530
 technology and new ways to earn 

00:07:00.009 --> 00:07:04.360
 money gets into our lives 

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:06.479
 because there will not be another new one but 

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:09.220
 you know we're about to 

00:07:06.479 --> 00:07:11.320
 experience a change we do not know what 

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:13.539
 exchange rate yet but I think that 

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:15.880
 in our next two years go to 

00:07:13.539 --> 00:07:17.440
 determine a bit the global approach of 

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:20.320
 how are we going to continue living in this 

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:22.810
 world and technology of course in 

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:24.460
 Internet has a lot to do in the 

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:26.270
 new plans for the future of 

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:29.150
 modern societies 

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:30.740
 so nothing a big hug I hope that 

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:32.740
 you liked this video is this 

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:35.900
 recommendation of get rich with a click 

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:37.820
 of trotsky frames and the truth that good 

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:40.280
 you can learn a lot from a person who 

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:42.590
 he made a transaction 

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:44.750
 maybe the biggest transaction more 

00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:47.720
 voluminous in the sale of a 

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:50.600
 domain that were 7.5 million 

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:52.580
 dollars so good you interested this 

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:54.830
 resource if you can get close to a 

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:57.260
 bookstore and hook this book because 

00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:59.360
