and as soon as that came out it came out

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.679 
and as soon as that came out it came out
in<00:01:47.189> quite<00:01:47.460> a<00:01:47.490> buggy<00:01:47.790> states<00:01:48.180> that<00:01:48.329> need<00:01:48.509> for

in quite a buggy states that need for

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.179 
in quite a buggy states that need for
least<00:01:48.810> some<00:01:48.960> updates<00:01:49.259> for<00:01:49.350> however<00:01:49.979> these

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
least some updates for however these

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:51.499 
least some updates for however these
didn't<00:01:50.520> come<00:01:50.549> under<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.060> title<00:01:51.329> update

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
didn't come under the title update

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.120 
didn't come under the title update
system<00:01:51.869> they<00:01:52.140> would<00:01:52.290> just<00:01:52.320> call<00:01:52.590> PS<00:01:52.890> free

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
system they would just call PS free

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.340 
system they would just call PS free
patches<00:01:53.579> one<00:01:53.790> point<00:01:54.060> zero<00:01:54.210> point<00:01:54.840> one<00:01:55.320> one

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
patches one point zero point one one

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.469

point<00:01:55.799> zero<00:01:55.860> point<00:01:56.189> two<00:01:56.219> etc<00:01:56.880> and<00:01:57.210> then<00:01:57.420> I

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
point zero point two etc and then I

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:58.760 
point zero point two etc and then I
believe<00:01:57.930> they<00:01:58.140> just<00:01:58.350> kept<00:01:58.469> calling<00:01:58.710> the

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
believe they just kept calling the

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.740 
believe they just kept calling the
patches<00:01:59.189> and<00:01:59.310> so<00:01:59.670> even<00:01:59.939> one<00:02:00.119> point<00:02:00.360> zero<00:02:00.420> point

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
patches and so even one point zero point

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.420 
patches and so even one point zero point
seven<00:02:00.869> or<00:02:01.049> something<00:02:01.170> and<00:02:01.500> then<00:02:01.860> now<00:02:02.070> because

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
seven or something and then now because

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.530 
seven or something and then now because
they're<00:02:02.610> pretty<00:02:02.820> much<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:03.119> equivalent<00:02:03.509> of

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
they're pretty much the equivalent of

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:04.969 
they're pretty much the equivalent of
the<00:02:03.719> 360<00:02:04.140> because<00:02:04.259> they<00:02:04.439> go<00:02:04.619> all<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:04.829> bugs

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
the 360 because they go all the bugs

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.859 
the 360 because they go all the bugs
fixed<00:02:05.340> now<00:02:05.909> it's<00:02:06.180> just<00:02:06.299> called<00:02:06.509> title<00:02:06.780> update

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869

again<00:02:26.220> we've<00:02:26.340> title<00:02:26.550> update<00:02:26.640> 16<00:02:27.180> and<00:02:27.360> then

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
again we've title update 16 and then

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.420 
again we've title update 16 and then
we've<00:02:28.020> told<00:02:28.170> update<00:02:28.410> 17<00:02:28.770> the<00:02:28.920> same<00:02:29.190> thing

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
we've told update 17 the same thing

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.790 
we've told update 17 the same thing
happened<00:02:29.460> however<00:02:30.030> this<00:02:30.840> is<00:02:31.080> where<00:02:31.380> it<00:02:31.530> gets

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
happened however this is where it gets

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.520 
happened however this is where it gets
again<00:02:32.430> more<00:02:32.790> complex<00:02:33.330> so<00:02:33.690> the<00:02:33.990> reason<00:02:34.380> for

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
again more complex so the reason for

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.980 
again more complex so the reason for
that<00:02:34.560> is<00:02:34.890> because<00:02:34.920> both<00:02:35.610> minecraft<00:02:36.180> xbox<00:02:36.720> one

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
that is because both minecraft xbox one

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.980 
that is because both minecraft xbox one
and<00:02:37.140> ps4<00:02:37.590> came<00:02:38.340> out<00:02:38.550> so<00:02:38.910> with<00:02:39.150> for<00:02:39.570> consoles

you<00:02:47.400> know<00:02:47.430> what<00:02:47.640> we'll<00:02:47.790> just<00:02:47.970> say<00:02:48.030> that

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
you know what we'll just say that

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.360 
you know what we'll just say that
happened<00:02:48.480> also<00:02:49.230> minecraft<00:02:49.709> ps3<00:02:49.980> got<00:02:50.280> an

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
happened also minecraft ps3 got an

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.550 
happened also minecraft ps3 got an
update<00:02:50.489> by<00:02:50.790> a<00:02:50.820> separate<00:02:51.390> update<00:02:51.780> which<00:02:52.170> some

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
update by a separate update which some

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.370 
update by a separate update which some
people<00:02:52.770> are<00:02:53.130> calling<00:02:53.489> title<00:02:54.150> update<00:02:54.270> 18<00:02:55.140> and

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
people are calling title update 18 and

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:56.840 
people are calling title update 18 and
then<00:02:55.440> calling<00:02:55.680> they'll<00:02:55.890> want<00:02:56.070> i'll<00:02:56.190> update<00:02:56.340> 19

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
then calling they'll want i'll update 19

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.520 
then calling they'll want i'll update 19
so<00:02:57.270> if<00:02:57.450> you're<00:02:57.600> following<00:02:57.720> that<00:02:57.989> logic<00:02:58.140> then

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
so if you're following that logic then

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.710 
so if you're following that logic then
tyler<00:02:58.739> big<00:02:58.920> 20<00:02:59.400> is<00:02:59.580> the<00:02:59.760> current<00:03:00.060> updates<00:03:00.420> so

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
tyler big 20 is the current updates so

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.240 
tyler big 20 is the current updates so
there's<00:03:01.350> also<00:03:01.470> gonna<00:03:01.590> be<00:03:01.650> more<00:03:01.830> updates<00:03:02.130> in

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
there's also gonna be more updates in

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.970 
there's also gonna be more updates in
the<00:03:02.340> meantime<00:03:02.520> so<00:03:03.060> and<00:03:03.270> then<00:03:03.780> title<00:03:04.230> update<00:03:04.320> 20

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
the meantime so and then title update 20

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.110 
the meantime so and then title update 20
will<00:03:05.160> take<00:03:05.370> some<00:03:05.550> time<00:03:05.580> because<00:03:05.850> it<00:03:06.030> was

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
will take some time because it was

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.850 
will take some time because it was
recently<00:03:06.420> announced<00:03:06.480> it<00:03:06.780> will<00:03:06.840> be<00:03:06.959> 1.6<00:03:07.470> from

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
recently announced it will be 1.6 from

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.770 
recently announced it will be 1.6 from
the<00:03:07.950> pc<00:03:08.370> and<00:03:08.520> that<00:03:09.000> means<00:03:09.270> there's<00:03:09.540> gonna<00:03:09.600> be

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
the pc and that means there's gonna be

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.390 
the pc and that means there's gonna be
more<00:03:10.020> updates<00:03:10.380> presumably<00:03:10.830> to<00:03:11.070> add<00:03:11.190> more

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
more updates presumably to add more

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.970 
more updates presumably to add more
texture<00:03:11.760> packs<00:03:11.940> to<00:03:12.090> ps3<00:03:12.390> or<00:03:12.810> ps4<00:03:13.020> and<00:03:13.560> it's

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
texture packs to ps3 or ps4 and it's

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.790 
texture packs to ps3 or ps4 and it's
gonna<00:03:14.160> be<00:03:14.250> a<00:03:14.459> little<00:03:14.820> bit<00:03:15.120> messy<00:03:16.050> as<00:03:16.290> far<00:03:16.650> as

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
gonna be a little bit messy as far as

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.710 
gonna be a little bit messy as far as
updates<00:03:17.310> a<00:03:17.430> concern<00:03:17.880> so<00:03:18.180> here's<00:03:18.450> what<00:03:18.690> i

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
updates a concern so here's what i

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.140 
updates a concern so here's what i
believe<00:03:19.200> based<00:03:19.560> on<00:03:19.799> what<00:03:19.980> we<00:03:20.100> know<00:03:20.280> so<00:03:20.310> far<00:03:20.580> the

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
believe based on what we know so far the

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.090 
believe based on what we know so far the
next<00:03:21.480> title<00:03:21.630> update<00:03:21.840> for<00:03:22.290> all<00:03:22.500> the<00:03:22.650> consoles

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
next title update for all the consoles

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.250 
next title update for all the consoles
the<00:03:23.310> big<00:03:23.489> 1.6<00:03:24.120> update<00:03:24.239> will<00:03:24.660> be<00:03:24.690> cooked<00:03:25.049> so

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
the big 1.6 update will be cooked so

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.170 
the big 1.6 update will be cooked so
basically<00:03:25.769> the<00:03:26.190> only<00:03:26.340> time<00:03:26.700> an<00:03:26.850> update<00:03:27.120> is

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
basically the only time an update is

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.699 
basically the only time an update is
called<00:03:27.360> a<00:03:27.390> title<00:03:27.660> update<00:03:27.750> is<00:03:28.049> when<00:03:28.320> it's<00:03:28.470> for

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
called a title update is when it's for

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:30.289 
called a title update is when it's for
all<00:03:28.860> the<00:03:29.040> platforms<00:03:29.250> that<00:03:29.640> exist<00:03:30.060> at<00:03:30.180> the<00:03:30.209> time

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
all the platforms that exist at the time

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:32.600 
all the platforms that exist at the time
or<00:03:30.720> the<00:03:30.959> very<00:03:31.230> least<00:03:31.410> for<00:03:31.680> when<00:03:31.799> it's<00:03:31.920> for<00:03:32.070> 360

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
or the very least for when it's for 360

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.850 
or the very least for when it's for 360
because<00:03:32.730> every<00:03:33.510> update<00:03:33.630> 360<00:03:34.260> has<00:03:34.440> been<00:03:34.680> called

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
because every update 360 has been called

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.170 
because every update 360 has been called
a<00:03:34.920> title<00:03:35.130> update<00:03:35.220> so<00:03:35.549> far<00:03:35.820> whether<00:03:36.000> it<00:03:36.090> be

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
a title update so far whether it be

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.240 
a title update so far whether it be
tight<00:03:36.330> update<00:03:36.570> 17<00:03:37.080> the<00:03:37.230> one<00:03:37.380> that<00:03:37.620> i<00:03:37.650> did<00:03:37.950> shave

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
tight update 17 the one that i did shave

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:39.979 
tight update 17 the one that i did shave
transfers<00:03:38.670> and<00:03:38.880> whatnot<00:03:39.120> or<00:03:39.390> whether<00:03:39.720> it<00:03:39.900> be

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
transfers and whatnot or whether it be

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:41.870 
transfers and whatnot or whether it be
talib<00:03:40.320> day<00:03:40.410> 14<00:03:40.860> which<00:03:41.040> brought<00:03:41.250> features<00:03:41.670> the

talib day 14 which brought features the

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.640 
talib day 14 which brought features the
one<00:03:42.090> point<00:03:42.329> free<00:03:42.540> update<00:03:42.900> which<00:03:43.140> everyone<00:03:43.560> it

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
one point free update which everyone it

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:44.870 
one point free update which everyone it
is<00:03:43.680> whenever<00:03:44.130> there's<00:03:44.430> an<00:03:44.489> update<00:03:44.579> for<00:03:44.760> xbox

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
is whenever there's an update for xbox

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.729 
is whenever there's an update for xbox
60<00:03:45.360> it<00:03:45.510> always<00:03:45.840> counts<00:03:46.230> as<00:03:46.320> a<00:03:46.350> title<00:03:46.590> update

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
60 it always counts as a title update

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:49.009 
60 it always counts as a title update
even<00:03:47.280> when<00:03:47.400> it's<00:03:47.519> a<00:03:47.579> bug<00:03:47.790> fix<00:03:48.030> whereas<00:03:48.660> when

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 
even when it's a bug fix whereas when

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:51.110 
even when it's a bug fix whereas when
there's<00:03:49.230> just<00:03:49.440> a<00:03:49.500> bug<00:03:49.680> fix<00:03:49.950> exclusively<00:03:50.940> to

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
there's just a bug fix exclusively to

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.670 
there's just a bug fix exclusively to
another<00:03:51.360> platform<00:03:51.570> or<00:03:51.959> in<00:03:52.019> this<00:03:52.140> case<00:03:52.200> p<00:03:52.560> it's

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
another platform or in this case p it's

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.380 
another platform or in this case p it's
free<00:03:52.920> it<00:03:53.370> doesn't<00:03:53.489> count<00:03:53.790> as<00:03:53.940> a<00:03:54.000> title<00:03:54.239> update

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
free it doesn't count as a title update

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.420 
free it doesn't count as a title update
so<00:03:54.720> it<00:03:54.870> had<00:03:55.019> like<00:03:55.200> seven<00:03:55.620> patches<00:03:56.040> for<00:03:56.280> like

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
so it had like seven patches for like

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.819 
so it had like seven patches for like
two<00:03:56.610> updates<00:03:56.910> for<00:03:56.970> the<00:03:57.060> 360<00:03:57.390> and<00:03:57.630> a<00:03:57.930> dub<00:03:58.470> system

00:03:58.819 --> 00:03:58.829 
two updates for the 360 and a dub system

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:01.340 
two updates for the 360 and a dub system
just<00:03:59.160> seems<00:03:59.459> to<00:03:59.610> refer<00:03:59.880> to<00:04:00.030> the<00:04:00.120> 360<00:04:00.570> or<00:04:00.840> all

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:01.350 
just seems to refer to the 360 or all

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:02.930 
just seems to refer to the 360 or all
console<00:04:01.709> only<00:04:01.829> updates<00:04:02.190> which<00:04:02.370> essentially

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
console only updates which essentially

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:04.580 
console only updates which essentially
mean<00:04:03.150> the<00:04:03.239> same<00:04:03.390> things<00:04:03.630> because<00:04:03.870> 360<00:04:04.350> hasn't

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
mean the same things because 360 hasn't

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.380 
mean the same things because 360 hasn't
hand<00:04:04.709> update<00:04:04.980> yet<00:04:05.130> so<00:04:05.340> i<00:04:05.370> think<00:04:05.730> the<00:04:06.090> next

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
hand update yet so i think the next

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.569 
hand update yet so i think the next
update<00:04:06.540> should<00:04:07.110> be<00:04:07.410> code<00:04:07.650> using<00:04:08.160> the<00:04:08.190> title

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:08.579 
update should be code using the title

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:11.000 
update should be code using the title
update<00:04:08.670> system<00:04:09.030> title<00:04:09.750> update<00:04:09.840> 18<00:04:10.470> which<00:04:10.769> i

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
update system title update 18 which i

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:12.830 
update system title update 18 which i
kinda<00:04:11.340> like<00:04:11.519> the<00:04:11.640> idea<00:04:11.670> and<00:04:12.090> honestly<00:04:12.630> i<00:04:12.690> think

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
kinda like the idea and honestly i think

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.780 
kinda like the idea and honestly i think
that<00:04:13.140> makes<00:04:13.320> the<00:04:13.470> most<00:04:13.590> sense<00:04:13.739> at<00:04:14.100> all<00:04:14.280> console

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
that makes the most sense at all console

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.130 
that makes the most sense at all console
update<00:04:15.090> is<00:04:15.180> the<00:04:15.269> title<00:04:15.480> update<00:04:15.570> otherwise

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:16.140 
update is the title update otherwise

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.229 
update is the title update otherwise
it's<00:04:16.470> just<00:04:16.560> an<00:04:16.859> update<00:04:17.010> that<00:04:17.370> makes<00:04:17.579> perfect

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
it's just an update that makes perfect

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:19.729 
it's just an update that makes perfect
sense<00:04:18.390> right<00:04:18.570> let<00:04:19.049> someone<00:04:19.260> stay<00:04:19.470> on<00:04:19.560> track

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
sense right let someone stay on track

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:21.349 
sense right let someone stay on track
but<00:04:20.160> you<00:04:20.220> know<00:04:20.340> not<00:04:20.579> everyone<00:04:20.880> sticking<00:04:21.120> to

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
but you know not everyone sticking to

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:22.880 
but you know not everyone sticking to
that<00:04:21.510> so<00:04:21.810> we'll<00:04:21.989> have<00:04:22.140> to<00:04:22.349> see<00:04:22.380> where<00:04:22.680> this

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:22.890 
that so we'll have to see where this

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:25.070 
that so we'll have to see where this
goes<00:04:22.950> do<00:04:23.910> we<00:04:24.000> just<00:04:24.030> call<00:04:24.419> these<00:04:24.570> updates<00:04:24.930> i'll

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
goes do we just call these updates i'll

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.180 
goes do we just call these updates i'll
update<00:04:25.229> 18<00:04:25.590> because<00:04:25.680> that's<00:04:25.860> what<00:04:26.010> most

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
update 18 because that's what most

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:27.350 
update 18 because that's what most
people<00:04:26.430> think<00:04:26.460> on

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
people think on

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.730 
people think on
see<00:04:27.479> I<00:04:27.509> think<00:04:27.689> the<00:04:27.960> system<00:04:28.139> that<00:04:28.500> will<00:04:28.560> work

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740 
see I think the system that will work

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:29.929 
see I think the system that will work
for<00:04:28.800> the<00:04:29.069> future<00:04:29.400> though<00:04:29.520> because<00:04:29.699> tile

00:04:29.929 --> 00:04:29.939 
for the future though because tile

00:04:29.939 --> 00:04:31.429 
for the future though because tile
updating<00:04:30.449> is<00:04:30.509> a<00:04:30.569> good<00:04:30.750> name<00:04:30.900> but<00:04:31.110> it's<00:04:31.229> still

00:04:31.429 --> 00:04:31.439 
updating is a good name but it's still

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:33.679 
updating is a good name but it's still
very<00:04:31.500> confusing<00:04:32.280> most<00:04:32.819> beloved<00:04:32.969> no<00:04:33.330> idea<00:04:33.569> how

00:04:33.679 --> 00:04:33.689 
very confusing most beloved no idea how

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:35.450 
very confusing most beloved no idea how
the<00:04:33.750> updates<00:04:34.020> work<00:04:34.169> I<00:04:34.349> think<00:04:34.740> the<00:04:34.889> next<00:04:35.159> update

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
the updates work I think the next update

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.249 
the updates work I think the next update
will<00:04:35.490> just<00:04:36.030> be<00:04:36.150> cool<00:04:36.360> at<00:04:36.599> some<00:04:36.840> point<00:04:37.080> you<00:04:37.169> know

00:04:37.249 --> 00:04:37.259 
will just be cool at some point you know

00:04:37.259 --> 00:04:38.420 
will just be cool at some point you know
in<00:04:37.319> the<00:04:37.349> future<00:04:37.500> close<00:04:37.860> to<00:04:38.009> where<00:04:38.129> they'll

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
in the future close to where they'll

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.159 
in the future close to where they'll
just<00:04:38.580> start<00:04:38.669> calling<00:04:39.030> at<00:04:39.090> the<00:04:39.180> 1.6<00:04:39.780> point<00:04:40.020> for

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:40.169 
just start calling at the 1.6 point for

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:42.020 
just start calling at the 1.6 point for
update<00:04:40.500> go<00:04:40.710> back<00:04:40.919> to<00:04:41.069> that<00:04:41.159> system<00:04:41.580> because

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030 
update go back to that system because

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:44.270 
update go back to that system because
the<00:04:42.150> five<00:04:42.479> consoles<00:04:43.199> are<00:04:43.500> you<00:04:43.680> know<00:04:43.800> the<00:04:43.919> psp2

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
the five consoles are you know the psp2

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:45.830 
the five consoles are you know the psp2
coming<00:04:44.460> out<00:04:44.520> soon<00:04:44.669> with<00:04:45.030> five<00:04:45.330> consoles

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 
coming out soon with five consoles

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.779 
coming out soon with five consoles
getting<00:04:46.169> an<00:04:46.289> update<00:04:46.439> system<00:04:46.830> naming<00:04:47.550> that

00:04:47.779 --> 00:04:47.789 
getting an update system naming that

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:49.339 
getting an update system naming that
works<00:04:48.060> across<00:04:48.240> all<00:04:48.449> of<00:04:48.509> them<00:04:48.750> it's<00:04:49.080> gonna<00:04:49.229> be

00:04:49.339 --> 00:04:49.349 
works across all of them it's gonna be

00:04:49.349 --> 00:04:51.140 
works across all of them it's gonna be
so<00:04:49.379> difficult<00:04:49.860> anyway<00:04:50.490> and<00:04:50.729> even<00:04:50.969> if<00:04:51.030> you

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
so difficult anyway and even if you

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:52.640 
so difficult anyway and even if you
explained<00:04:51.599> that<00:04:51.780> title<00:04:52.020> update<00:04:52.110> means<00:04:52.469> all

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
explained that title update means all

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:54.110 
explained that title update means all
consoles<00:04:53.069> and<00:04:53.430> it's<00:04:53.580> just<00:04:53.729> an<00:04:53.789> update<00:04:53.939> of

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
consoles and it's just an update of

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:55.850 
consoles and it's just an update of
why's<00:04:54.419> that<00:04:54.659> still<00:04:55.139> gets<00:04:55.289> confusing<00:04:55.620> some

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
why's that still gets confusing some

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.230 
why's that still gets confusing some
people<00:04:56.159> whereas<00:04:56.460> just<00:04:56.669> coming<00:04:56.849> at<00:04:56.939> one<00:04:57.090> point

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 
people whereas just coming at one point

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.119 
people whereas just coming at one point
six<00:04:57.449> points<00:04:57.750> for<00:04:57.960> that<00:04:58.289> lets<00:04:58.500> us<00:04:58.650> know<00:04:58.710> both

00:04:59.119 --> 00:04:59.129 
six points for that lets us know both

00:04:59.129 --> 00:05:00.800 
six points for that lets us know both
while<00:04:59.520> it's<00:04:59.639> going<00:04:59.699> to<00:04:59.879> be<00:05:00.060> and<00:05:00.270> while<00:05:00.659> it's

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:00.810 
while it's going to be and while it's

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:02.719 
while it's going to be and while it's
going<00:05:00.840> to<00:05:01.020> contain<00:05:01.289> from<00:05:01.560> PC<00:05:01.889> roughly<00:05:02.340> so

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:02.729 
going to contain from PC roughly so

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:04.490 
going to contain from PC roughly so
that's<00:05:03.060> what<00:05:03.240> I<00:05:03.270> think<00:05:03.599> i<00:05:03.750> think<00:05:04.020> the<00:05:04.229> update

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:04.500 
that's what I think i think the update

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:05.990 
that's what I think i think the update
should<00:05:04.710> be<00:05:04.800> cool<00:05:04.979> tile<00:05:05.129> update<00:05:05.370> 18<00:05:05.729> but

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 
should be cool tile update 18 but

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.999 
should be cool tile update 18 but
they'll<00:05:06.210> probably<00:05:06.240> switch<00:05:06.930> to<00:05:07.080> 1.6<00:05:07.560> point<00:05:07.770> for

00:05:07.999 --> 00:05:08.009 
they'll probably switch to 1.6 point for

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:10.309 
they'll probably switch to 1.6 point for
bina<00:05:08.879> as<00:05:09.029> i<00:05:09.120> said<00:05:09.360> like<00:05:09.539> if<00:05:09.659> people<00:05:09.930> think<00:05:10.080> its

00:05:10.309 --> 00:05:10.319 
bina as i said like if people think its

00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:12.230 
bina as i said like if people think its
