00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.170 
with him last night I was grinding until
like<00:01:16.560> 3:00<00:01:17.340> in<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.490> morning<00:01:19.790> so<00:01:20.790> I<00:01:20.820> could

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
like 3:00 in the morning so I could

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.350 
like 3:00 in the morning so I could
actually<00:01:21.299> get<00:01:21.689> him<00:01:21.900> up<00:01:22.049> to<00:01:22.200> 57<00:01:22.920> but<00:01:23.820> as<00:01:23.939> you<00:01:24.150> can

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
actually get him up to 57 but as you can

see I downed him right there and

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:34.850 
see I downed him right there and
basically<00:01:30.060> you<00:01:30.720> can<00:01:30.750> do<00:01:31.200> this<00:01:31.560> ah<00:01:33.290> by<00:01:34.290> yourself

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
right now I'm I actually forgot what I

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.249 
right now I'm I actually forgot what I
was<00:02:00.869> supposed<00:02:01.140> to<00:02:01.229> do<00:02:01.969> so<00:02:02.969> I<00:02:03.030> was<00:02:03.360> just<00:02:03.390> trying

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
was supposed to do so I was just trying

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.130 
was supposed to do so I was just trying
to<00:02:04.409> figure<00:02:04.590> out<00:02:04.770> what<00:02:04.890> I<00:02:04.920> was<00:02:05.009> supposed<00:02:05.280> to<00:02:05.369> do

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
to figure out what I was supposed to do

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
to figure out what I was supposed to do
but<00:02:08.140> as<00:02:08.380> you<00:02:09.039> can<00:02:09.190> probably<00:02:09.450> tell<00:02:10.950> ya<00:02:11.950> there's

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
but as you can probably tell ya there's

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.250 
but as you can probably tell ya there's
only<00:02:12.340> two<00:02:12.610> people<00:02:12.849> on<00:02:13.209> right<00:02:13.780> now<00:02:13.989> so<00:02:14.290> uh<00:02:14.880> I

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
only two people on right now so uh I

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.770 
only two people on right now so uh I
basically<00:02:17.260> did<00:02:17.560> it<00:02:17.680> myself<00:02:17.830> because<00:02:18.780> there

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
basically did it myself because there

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:25.290 
basically did it myself because there
was<00:02:19.930> no<00:02:20.110> guild<00:02:20.380> members<00:02:20.739> on<00:02:20.950> and<00:02:21.360> I<00:02:24.300> basically

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
was no guild members on and I basically

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.210 
was no guild members on and I basically
wanted<00:02:25.660> the<00:02:25.780> shattered<00:02:26.140> halls<00:02:26.319> key<00:02:26.620> that<00:02:26.950> day
