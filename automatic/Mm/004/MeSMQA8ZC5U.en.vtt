00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:19.289
 this car should be kept engine 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:21.240
 extremely powerful passat cc that is 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.730
 the extremely powerful car of the 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.710
 test-drive today's action engines for 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.050
 piloting it henrique oliveira is already here 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.449
 ready to walk on the new model of 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.510
 volkswagen new the new engine 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:36.059
 design of cc passat 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.640
 surely we should find a 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.379
 car with great pleasure of driving is a 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.149
 feature of volkswagen cars 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.140
 This car I believe will not be 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.140
 different 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.969
 the 300-horsepower v6 engine allied to a 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.840
 dual clutch gearbox and six gears 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:54.059
 so he has a German dna and has everything 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.980
 to be an extremely yummy car 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.859
 driving is volkswagen's bet for 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.670
 competing with a mercedes bmw and audi 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:05.309
 the other major German automakers and 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:07.020
 in this segment of luxury cars 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.710
 volkswagen bets on last year 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:13.229
 down and is the comfort coupe is a car 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.960
 that there is the aggressive look of a coupe 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.509
 with the comfort of a sedan is bet 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.189
 volkswagen if speak and aggressive motor eu 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.080
 I had the opportunity to bring the car 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:25.140
 driving and I already heard the noise of the 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.330
 engine came its turn is engine noise 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.729
 v6 is always something that excites 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.680
 who likes power and likes cars 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.630
 It is a differential of this car and 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.340
 I believe his noise is one of the 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.619
 the most sensational things he has 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:41.060
 This is the time to accelerate because the belt 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.060
 it's starting motors easa 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:51.420
 When will we test today is 2012 that 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.610
 has undergone the first restyling already 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.620
 been waiting a long time for what has not 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.890
 missing in this new version are lines 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:01.470
 modern and bold dash cc is 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.050
 a luxury sedan but if you prefer 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.420
 you can use the power of your v6 engine 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:09.630
 for a more sporty play 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.910
 the acronym stands for comfort cup 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.970
 the look of the car is quite aggressive 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:17.400
 he has ahead of normal pass and 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.830
 You have a feathered back where she 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.230
 has a very aggressive trim on 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.630
 towards the end of the car that quite 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.790
 cozy despite German sobriety 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:29.460
 present in volkswagens 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:32.400
 the 2012 version of ccc features headlights 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:34.700
 bi-xenon crosses of static curves that 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.740
 keeps lighting at adequate levels 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.840
 independent of vehicle movement 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:41.730
 Side Assist plus systems that alert you to 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.220
 driver in case there are cars in the 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.920
 blind spot and still makes interventions in the 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.260
 direction if necessary plant in the

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:08.190
 that can be 17 18 and up to 19 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.140
 inches depending on the version 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:13.880
 being that the latter has a system of 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.880
 tire pressure monitoring 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:28.579
 and accelerate randino passage underneath 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:31.760
 of this hood a 3.6-liter v6 engine with 

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:34.159
 direct injection of gasoline 300 horses 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.319
 power transmission 

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:39.560
 clutch with six gears and the brakes 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:41.989
 abs ebd and stability control with 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:44.239
 permanent full-time traction took the 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:47.000
 Electronic slider control and 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:48.939
 differential lock and dual etecs 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.709
 front and side curtain types 

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:54.019
 part of the vast menu of this 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:56.060
 car the car engine exactly what 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:58.879
 I expected exactly what people would 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.919
 waiting for a 1 300 horsepower engine 

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:02.480
 in this case he has a cost of this 

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:04.430
 car here it has running 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:07.129
 quite gentle because it is a six 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.810
 You can not even 

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:09.709
 car acceleration if you want to walk 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:12.139
 slowly 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:13.099
 he is a very soft car very soft 

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:14.629
 and you walk 

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:17.030
 if you want to walk faster you 

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:19.549
 you can choose to put it in sport mode 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:21.949
 where he will change the gears with a 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:24.830
 turn much higher you can select 

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:27.080
 manual gear shift where you can 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:29.030
 switch on the lever itself or on 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:31.550
 butterflies behind the wheel 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:34.400
 So this is a car that you can get. 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:36.710
 on a day-to-day basis privileging the 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.990
 comfort of you want to walk calm 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:41.330
 walk pretty relaxed and it's a car 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.259
 also that if you want a play 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.539
 stronger 

00:04:42.259 --> 00:04:46.849
 He will respond immediately to you. 

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:48.470
 the interior is almost the same as the 

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:50.680
 previous version with this action 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:53.270
 small more important details 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:55.599
 comfort is on all sides and 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:58.250
 leather multifunction steering wheel seats 

00:04:55.599 --> 00:05:00.409
 storage capacity in the 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:01.849
 according to the driver chrome details 

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:03.770
 at various levels 

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:06.469
 besides an excellent system of 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:08.389
 navigation then it is a car in all 

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:10.610
 the technological devices that these 

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:13.729
 modern cars have then we have 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:15.620
 here is a seat with electric adjustment of 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:18.949
 height and d 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:21.500
 today from the seat you have the option of three 

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:24.410
 memories where you can memorize all 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:26.240
 the settings of the car and three people 

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:27.889
 different and can use you do not lose 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:30.500
 time you simply select 

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:32.900
 memory that you have recorded and it will 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:35.060
 place all car settings in the 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:36.440
 As you left it last time. 

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:38.750
 that you walked then this is one thing 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:40.639
 which really facilitates quite a lot 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:43.190
 it has a proximity sensor when 

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:46.040
 You approach the car with the key in the 

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:47.630
 hand in his pocket he opens and closes a 

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:49.100
 car if you want so you do not 

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:50.930
 need to get the key 

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:52.669
 You will start the engine. 

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:53.539
 simply press the button to trigger the 

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:55.760
 motor 

00:05:53.539 --> 00:05:58.010
 he has the park assist which is the system of 

00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:00.229
 Volkswagen what book does he park for? 

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:03.020
 you the car you have a position of 

00:06:00.229 --> 00:06:05.210
 also very comfortable and very 

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:07.430
 good is not enough to be the 

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:10.430
 a sports car but you come close 

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:12.889
 of this you have the seats with sides 

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:13.850
 tall and grabbed quite safely well you 

00:06:12.889 --> 00:06:17.180
 in the curves 

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:18.919
 he is a middle bench and pulls it safely to 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:21.590
 driving position is easy to find 

00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:23.599
 because you have height adjustment of the 

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:25.880
 seat you have height adjustment of the 

00:06:23.599 --> 00:06:27.680
 steering wheel and also depth 

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:29.630
 Can you regulate both of us? 

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:32.360
 steering wheel movements is so much 

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:34.720
 easy for you to find the ideal position 

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:34.720
 to drive 

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:47.759
 walking in this car one of the things that 

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:49.919
 impresses the stability of the yen is 

00:06:47.759 --> 00:06:52.349
 endowing the attraction formed or is it 

00:06:49.919 --> 00:06:54.780
 has integral four-wheel drive and 

00:06:52.349 --> 00:06:56.940
 that makes him walk around the bend 

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:58.740
 looking like you're on the train track, huh? 

00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:00.629
 for those who like sportsmanship 

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:02.370
 who likes to walk stronger this is 

00:07:00.629 --> 00:07:05.520
 a good request is a differential of this 

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:07.740
 car, he can walk 

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:09.960
 on the floor it conveys enough safety 

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:10.919
 that the noise of the henrique engine is 

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:13.169
 approved 

00:07:10.919 --> 00:07:15.000
 I really liked and you can hear 

00:07:13.169 --> 00:07:18.360
 even with the closed glass you can 

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.550
 listen to a v6 engine right now and it's very 

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:22.560
 interesting you get into the curves have 

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:23.729
 full control of gear shifting the 

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:26.370
 marches manually 

00:07:23.729 --> 00:07:27.719
 Can you control the car you? 

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:29.699
 can see all systems 

00:07:27.719 --> 00:07:32.099
 electronic stability control 

00:07:29.699 --> 00:07:33.810
 operating traction control and this 

00:07:32.099 --> 00:07:35.460
 makes it much easier 

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:37.560
 along with four-by- four traction 

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:39.599
 integral is something that facilitates 

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:42.139
 enough makes a car very easy to 

00:07:39.599 --> 00:07:42.139
 to address 

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:52.330
 you are a volkswagen 

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:53.080
 people still refer to the car 

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:55.060
 popular 

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:57.190
 but I think this car is sophisticated 

00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:59.770
 Enough is enough for you, Mercedes. 

00:07:57.190 --> 00:08:03.420
 audi bmw and I think in the segment of 

00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:03.420
 give you a grade 8 and mail
