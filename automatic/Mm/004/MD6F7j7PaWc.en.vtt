00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.950
 efficient and grief auto mode 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.119
 over long distances as well 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.270
 satisfactory gun firing on 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:09.149

 firing and low easily controlled 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.840
 returns these advantages allow men 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.180
 effectively use assault 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.160
 rifle version 2010 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.819
 consider tactical and technical 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:29.670
 characteristics with and 2010 use 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:32.610
 Standard cartridge NATO caliber 762 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.380
 earth sleeves 51 millimeter it has 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.120
 good shop for 30 rounds 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:40.140
 enlarged store capacity 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:43.230
 is 45 rounds but with s 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:46.410
 2010 is a significant disadvantage 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.599
 damage hurray assault rifle and spot 2010 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.239
 only 35 maximum 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:54.660
 units per hit to distance in 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:56.760
 20 meters and a minimum of 20 units with 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.780
 increase the rate of rapid-fire 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.230
 this machine 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:03.080
 much better we have good 750 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.700
 shots per minute 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.120
 what for similar assault rifle 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.520
 is a huge plus 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:13.370
 reloading an empty magazine is 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:17.390
 3.3 seconds tactical reload 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:18.890
 the store is made in 2.8 seconds it 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:21.350
 very bad temporal indicators 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:24.200
 which cause significant damage 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:26.150
 Belgian automata as a result we 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.100
 we get quite unstable 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.720
 characteristics of the trunk that has 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:33.110
 several good pluses and some 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:35.210
 bad cons pros can be attributed 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:37.490
 good rate of fire and accuracy 

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:40.370
 firing and to the cons for a long time 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:42.260
 recharge and little damage what 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.420
 As for amenities, it is worth saying 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.820
 a few words about the aiming strip 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:50.540
 the sight of this machine is very convenient and 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:52.760
 reminds sight fn fal from black ops he 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:55.340
 does not close the review and allows convenient 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.410
 firing at targets this indicator 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.540
 allows you to abandon sighting 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:03.200
 gadgets basically what 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:05.600
 concerns returns then lead off 2010 and with that 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:08.350
 There are no problems as before. 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:11.360
 it is said it is very low and very easy 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:13.820
 controlled it allows without special 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:16.310
 problems firing at targets in the near 

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:18.169
 and middle distance as for 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:21.169
 long distances then there are 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:22.640
 problems due to low machine damage 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:24.860
 take back 2010 

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:26.300
 the fire for a long distance will lead 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:29.240
 much harder 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.500
 also an assault rifle with her 2010 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.380
 similar fanfare 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:35.750
 has two additional modes of fire it 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:38.390
 single and cut-off of 3 shots 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:40.430
 move on to the practical part of the assault 

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:42.830
 rifles from 2010 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:45.530
 and so what to install in belgian 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:47.840
 automatic with and 2010 first thing i 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:50.300
 I recommend to correct a minus from a distance 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:52.669
 drop damage increasing maximum damage 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.890
 a couple of tens of meters for this 

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:57.320
 you need a module muzzle brake 

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:59.300
 This upgrade increases the maximum. 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:01.610
 distance and at times increase your chances 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.800
 get out of the scrum winner significantly 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:06.919
 faster especially on medium and far 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:09.040
 distance second upgrade I recommend 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:10.570
 install the module handle 

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:12.820
 This module is not only very 

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:15.130
 effective but also one of the most common 

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:17.740
 used in strawberry guest 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:20.080
 the grip module will minimize and without 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:21.130
 in addition to low returns and also increase 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.530
 firing accuracy 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:25.870
 This will allow at times to bring aku on 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:28.990
 medium and long distances even 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:31.690
 despite a little lesson regarding 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:34.630
 Perkov then here I recommend very necessary 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:37.270
 perk focus since it is very effective 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:39.640
 will affect your shooting accuracy when 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:41.650
 your wounds the trunk will not shake me 

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:43.630
 throw up and you accordingly do not 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:44.200
 will lose your accuracy also by 

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:46.570
 installation 

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:48.460
 recommended quick draw perk 

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:50.950
 allow you to enter as quickly as possible 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:53.890
 in aiming mode especially it will be 

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:57.130
 useful at close range because 

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:57.790
 fire from the hip suck 2010 is not very 

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:01.000
 effectively 

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:03.220
 but also let's summarize from 2010 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.890
 has good performance and good 

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:08.860
 viruses which however can be resorted 

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:10.630
 I can call with read 10 one of 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:13.210
 medium trunks in class 

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:16.060
 however when shooting a murder from this 

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:17.680
 weapons i enjoy given 

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:19.300
 the trunk is not particularly can make 

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:22.090
 competition to their fellows 

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:23.680
 workouts a 12 or honey badger he 

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:25.180
 can lose melee over 

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:27.490
 efficient and fast harmless 

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:30.070
 a machine gun or a powerful shotgun 

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:32.260
 however high accuracy and low recoil 

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:35.020
 can play a lot for this weapon 

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:38.110
 it is in its own way a good trunk which 

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:38.830
 not everyone will like it however 

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:40.720
 to adapt 

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:45.130
 and be targeted for you it will 

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:48.670
 good choice and experience in general is the same c3010 

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:51.910
 accurate and powerful assault rifle if 

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:52.680
