lightsaber and I could kind of hear it

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.150 
lightsaber and I could kind of hear it
in<00:00:17.970> my<00:00:18.029> head<00:00:18.390> on<00:00:18.810> the<00:00:18.930> campus<00:00:19.350> of<00:00:19.439> USC<00:00:19.680> I<00:00:19.859> was<00:00:20.100> a

in my head on the campus of USC I was a
projectionist<00:00:20.520> and<00:00:21.060> when<00:00:21.270> you<00:00:21.420> turn<00:00:21.720> the

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
projectionist and when you turn the

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.320 
projectionist and when you turn the
projectors<00:00:22.350> on<00:00:22.500> they<00:00:22.680> harmed<00:00:23.220> I<00:00:23.430> thought<00:00:24.150> that

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
projectors on they harmed I thought that

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.689 
projectors on they harmed I thought that
was<00:00:24.449> kind<00:00:24.630> of<00:00:24.660> a<00:00:24.750> magical<00:00:25.380> musical<00:00:26.010> sound<00:00:26.340> and

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
was kind of a magical musical sound and

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.620 
was kind of a magical musical sound and
I<00:00:27.210> recorded<00:00:27.599> that<00:00:27.810> motor<00:00:28.320> hum<00:00:28.710> and<00:00:29.510> later<00:00:30.510> I

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
I recorded that motor hum and later I

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.590 
I recorded that motor hum and later I
added<00:00:31.230> a<00:00:31.410> buzzing<00:00:32.189> sound<00:00:32.219> from<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.180> back<00:00:33.390> of

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
added a buzzing sound from the back of

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.180 
added a buzzing sound from the back of
my<00:00:33.719> television<00:00:34.260> set<00:00:34.290> and<00:00:34.649> that<00:00:34.739> became<00:00:35.010> the

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
my television set and that became the

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:44.090 
my television set and that became the
basis<00:00:35.579> for<00:00:35.700> all<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:35.910> lightsabers<00:00:43.010> can<00:00:44.010> you

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100

play<00:00:44.340> those<00:00:44.520> isolated<00:00:45.180> sounds<00:00:45.510> like<00:00:45.629> the

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
play those isolated sounds like the

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.810 
play those isolated sounds like the
movie<00:00:45.989> projector<00:00:46.530> yeah<00:00:46.920> this<00:00:47.340> is<00:00:47.579> the

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
movie projector yeah this is the

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.590 
movie projector yeah this is the

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.660 

and<00:00:53.750> then<00:00:54.110> this<00:00:54.230> is<00:00:54.290> the<00:00:54.590> the<00:00:54.860> sound<00:00:55.190> of<00:00:55.460> the

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
and then this is the the sound of the

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.750 
and then this is the the sound of the
picture<00:00:56.150> tube<00:00:57.580> okay

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
picture tube okay

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:05.229 
picture tube okay
the<00:00:59.180> blend<00:00:59.570> of<00:00:59.810> those<00:00:59.960> two<00:01:00.020> is<00:01:02.980> is<00:01:03.980> the<00:01:04.729> basic

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:05.239 
the blend of those two is is the basic

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.359 
the blend of those two is is the basic
bed<00:01:05.840> that's<00:01:06.410> under<00:01:06.800> every<00:01:07.070> lightsaber

00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:09.369 
bed that's under every lightsaber

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:11.200 
bed that's under every lightsaber
question<00:01:10.369> really<00:01:10.460> becomes<00:01:10.790> how<00:01:10.970> do<00:01:11.030> you<00:01:11.150> make

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
question really becomes how do you make

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.030 
question really becomes how do you make
it<00:01:11.390> sound<00:01:11.660> like<00:01:11.840> it's<00:01:11.990> moving<00:01:12.320> well<00:01:12.770> that's<00:01:12.920> a

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
it sound like it's moving well that's a

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:20.400 
it sound like it's moving well that's a
different<00:01:13.400> issue<00:01:13.460> all<00:01:13.729> together<00:01:18.430> taking<00:01:19.430> the

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:20.410 
different issue all together taking the

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:23.080 
different issue all together taking the
steady-state<00:01:21.410> condition<00:01:22.130> of<00:01:22.250> the<00:01:22.400> sound<00:01:22.729> and

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
steady-state condition of the sound and

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.469 
steady-state condition of the sound and
then<00:01:24.080> playing<00:01:24.500> that<00:01:24.800> over<00:01:24.950> a<00:01:25.070> speaker<00:01:25.640> just

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
then playing that over a speaker just

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:28.090 
then playing that over a speaker just
like<00:01:26.869> we're<00:01:27.050> listening<00:01:27.350> in<00:01:27.410> this<00:01:27.560> room<00:01:27.860> and

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
like we're listening in this room and

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.910 
like we're listening in this room and
then<00:01:28.940> making<00:01:29.600> a<00:01:29.750> new<00:01:30.020> recording<00:01:30.560> of<00:01:30.680> it<00:01:30.800> with

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
then making a new recording of it with

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.280 
then making a new recording of it with
another<00:01:31.280> microphone<00:01:31.729> and<00:01:32.180> swinging<00:01:32.990> the

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:33.290 
another microphone and swinging the

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:34.580 
microphone around in front of the

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.180 
microphone around in front of the
speaker<00:01:34.700> produces<00:01:35.119> a<00:01:35.390> Doppler<00:01:35.869> effect
