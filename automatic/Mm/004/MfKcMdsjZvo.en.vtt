00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 hi everyone, bob 777 is welcome in 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:05.910
 thirty-ninth episode of my broken 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.200
 glory 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.019
 now I also say this sentence of 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.780
 night then I had recommended before 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.160
 just for starters we had recommended 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:14.940
 which player to take instead of 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.000
 fabregas 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.010
 here there have been many comments like 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.260
 I always thank you for this though 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.449
 there is a bigger tool you have me 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.820
 recommended in many 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.939
 ramires and have recommended but you etc. 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.700
 but now we are good to see two 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:34.710
 ramires cost about 15 20 thousand more 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.750
 faster, more bagato more things 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.390
 I prefer it because it is strong and 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.480
 own but tc costs practically one 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:45.570
 bad even less than ramires is 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.239
 an 82 of or the same that do not 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.950
 not even crap and so I don't know 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.289
 really who to buy ie I don't know if 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.910
 spend 20 thousand credits for a CD 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.840
 really worth it because it has so much 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.250
 fabregas 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.079
 so the question I ask myself is 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.420
 advising me to buy back between matisse 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.219
 and ramires and indifferent to me wins 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.379
 as more and more commented therefore if you 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.479
 think it is better to take them ramires 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.860
 even if it costs so much advised it is me 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.350
 I 'll take it here eventually 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.430
 obviously it will be more commented now 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.369
 we are going to see ours 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.840
 division iii then we have three points 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.880
 he played me a game 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.220
 ok so what else are we here to talk about 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.380
 let's go straight to the second one 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.130
 game for the first we take care of 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.869
 injured 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.240
 okay let's put campbell for this 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.009
 time and then let's see who will be 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.780
 our opponent, however, as always 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.369
 before doing I ask you to put me 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.229
 like this video to have others 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.250

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:42.479
 I don't know ten minutes I found 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.009
 finally an opponent no oh well you say 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.350
 minutes of work will be a step of six 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:53.570
 or seven 87 evaluation you can't 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:53.570

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:05.050

 sciuker shooter that i would like to say though i 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.970
 names of players them from the past cool

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:01.239
 by roberto carlos 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.800
 it seems that if you were like that but wait 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:06.250

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:08.350

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:25.090
 it's a connection look what often 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:27.940

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:15.590
 well but I trained from lost but come on 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:17.539
 oh well I ca n't do another game 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:20.419
