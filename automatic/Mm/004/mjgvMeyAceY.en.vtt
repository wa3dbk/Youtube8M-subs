00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.040
 bothered the guests 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:33.940
 what I do to save the world 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:37.480
 it's a hallucinate 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:41.160
 how to learn to play the lute and do 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:41.160

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:49.360
 the beauties of Florence can 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:54.090
 melt a heart but beware of 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:58.590
 of Rome and then you will have itching 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:02.750
 a juggler's song attracts ladies to 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:07.429
 heaps but when I start singing 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.429
 they throw me to the pylons 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.550
 for children 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.420
 for gentlemen 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.439
 I want to remember 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:29.629
 fearsome dux of venice a fierce man 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:34.310

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:39.770
 costantini and I beg you Byzantium should 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:43.740
 endure 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:46.700
 Konstantinos will rise if Istanbul is not 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.700
 it can heal 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:55.890
 it's still intact for singing money 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:58.890
 tuneless siles through the streets 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.890
 all right 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:08.159
 There was a man named yours 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:11.510
 that it was a libidinous rat so every 

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:14.510
 Once he was exhibited, he beat him 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.510
 substantial 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:23.230
 nobody understands my situation 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:28.319
 my life is not normal to sing for men 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:30.850
 impatient is a situation that swims me 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:34.600
 and sarkozy 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:35.819
 nothing while I rested said that the 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:39.260
 power 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:42.890
 while his fee was charged 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:45.050
 I sing in Italian and nobody defends what 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:51.490
 I live 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:51.490
 and it's impossible to live with that 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:57.280
 Christ 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:01.569
 how 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:04.770
 I invite those who curse and short twins 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:04.770
 peragÃ³n to nothing 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:13.640
 Caesar or Caesar was not a man of much 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:17.590
 old but he thought himself immortal 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:17.590
 until he ran into a serious 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:27.550
 I waste time and I can not believe it 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:31.290
 but you sitting there do not have 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:31.290
 nothing better to do 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:38.819
 to judge the character of a lady there 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:43.600
 that you look at your companies if you knew 

00:04:38.819 --> 00:04:47.170
 you want to appear with me it should dawn 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:48.849
 they said that the young Caesar could not be 

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:52.360
 kill 

00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:56.050
 so throw it in the air to see 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:05:00.249
 where his belief was going could not 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:03.550
 satiate your appetite of lovers I suspect 

00:05:00.249 --> 00:05:05.689
 that would do well with a trillo of the 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:08.659
 before 

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:11.929
 to judge the character of a lady there 

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:17.769
 that you look at your companies if you knew 

00:05:11.929 --> 00:05:17.769
 you want to appear with me it should dawn
