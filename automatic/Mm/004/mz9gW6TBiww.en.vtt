00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:20.220
 Flame improves your class or improves your 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.509

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.960
 they have problems playing black ops 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.480
 because you already know my channel is basically 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.440
 to help you 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.449
 better in your cantes in our plans 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.550
 but hey this is the penultimate episode 

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:51.010
 of this series the truth is that it has been 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:55.000
 a pretty good series helped them a lot 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:58.030
 to you and then it serves not for 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 to celebrate the last episodes of 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:04.020
 this series will bring us to be 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.020
 celebrating a series with another series 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.360
 celebrating a series with necessary then 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.730
 traverse in the chair in which you already 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.230
 had talked about the past video that was 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.610
 try that I'm going to choose a class that 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.110
 you leave me in the comments if 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.880
 I will try to bring you a good gameplay 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.440
 simply leaving a comment of 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.710
 any class that you use does not 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:23.570
 like it and I bring you a play and put your 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.470
 username and comment of the 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:28.370
 class that deposed 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:32.910
 and that they already know and well before 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:36.810
 continue with once we get to 12 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:40.270
 likes to post the last the last 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:43.880
 episode of this season 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:46.770
 this sea cmr 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:49.470
 Well, that would be the last episode 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.840
 s mart you will see that the trailer of the 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.590
 better way for you to say it and 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.030
 can get many casualties and streaks 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.870
 but well let's see what they had the 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.690
 luck 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:04.060
 and well let's see what the 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:07.060
 had accessories with chargers 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.880
 fast also brings it with dust 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:12.730
 and Latin culture with butt had three 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.020
 accessories is not weapon because I felt 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.540
 what 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.840
 I felt that I had to force to make three 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.120
 accessories 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.709
 I like the combination of it covers 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.959
 vehicular 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:25.430
 I told him suppose you want to look in 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:28.160
 a short cornerback 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:34.370
 how to return 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:37.580
 explain it is very easy to do that and 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:39.800
 with draws is also very practical 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.110
 with this form if sauron starts to 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:45.140
 shoot from flying positions of the 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:47.450
 imputed and to point as fast and good 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.980
 I felt part that was missing something and what 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.230
 what he lacked were the chargers 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.010
 radios makes a very good combination 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.920
 is 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:58.260
 these three accessories but of the 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.750
 advantages had something that I consider 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:04.480
 basic useful 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:07.959
 and special is hard line and ghost 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:10.900
 one advantage thresh hardness and the third 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:13.659
 advantage was of stress sambil good the 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.220
 reason is that this is how I bring them 

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:18.220
 the advantages is a perfect combination 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:20.650
 for almost any type of situation 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.840
 white stayed so no it is not a weapon 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.330
 quite difficult to control would say that 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.819
 it is one of the most difficult but good 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:30.260
 I could get a good gameplay and then 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:32.269
 this is how he brought 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.879
 and good friends, it would not be all for the 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:36.860
 today subscribe are new to give you 

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:37.810
 likes and what Lousteau and comment 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:41.050
 you want 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:43.300
 using in my second episode talking 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:45.459
 from soria second because I already have 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:49.120
 I have a class that I had left that 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:51.730
 time and remember that once you 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.920
 we reached 2 the exuberant history of 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:57.220
 this season that would be one of 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:59.709
 m &amp; r and well then that would be everything I am 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:03.060
 the king there was a greeting I will be watching 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:03.060
 in the next year
