chocolate<00:00:30.859> so<00:00:31.859> yeah<00:00:32.040> I<00:00:32.070> decided<00:00:32.520> to<00:00:32.700> go<00:00:32.820> with

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
chocolate so yeah I decided to go with

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.670 
chocolate so yeah I decided to go with
chocolate<00:00:33.480> I<00:00:33.660> was<00:00:33.840> kind<00:00:34.050> of<00:00:34.140> debating<00:00:34.500> between

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
chocolate I was kind of debating between

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.299 
chocolate I was kind of debating between
chocolate<00:00:35.579> and<00:00:35.790> dark<00:00:36.000> brown<00:00:36.480> I<00:00:37.160> felt<00:00:38.160> like

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
chocolate and dark brown I felt like

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.180 
chocolate and dark brown I felt like
maybe<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:39.059> dark<00:00:39.390> brown<00:00:39.719> has<00:00:40.559> some<00:00:40.950> red

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
maybe the dark brown has some red

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.459 
maybe the dark brown has some red
undertones<00:00:41.820> in<00:00:42.090> it<00:00:42.329> so<00:00:43.020> I<00:00:43.079> didn't<00:00:43.260> think<00:00:43.350> it

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
undertones in it so I didn't think it

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.049 
undertones in it so I didn't think it
would<00:00:43.590> look<00:00:43.710> pretty<00:00:44.010> too<00:00:44.219> good<00:00:44.520> I<00:00:44.760> kind<00:00:45.000> of

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
would look pretty too good I kind of

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.510 
would look pretty too good I kind of
wanted<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.360> chocolate<00:00:46.039> was<00:00:47.039> more<00:00:47.309> of<00:00:47.430> a

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
wanted the chocolate was more of a

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.670 
wanted the chocolate was more of a
lighter<00:00:47.760> brown<00:00:48.180> for<00:00:48.570> me<00:00:48.719> so<00:00:49.289> really<00:00:49.469> don't
