00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:15.639
 8 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.020
 yes i have thereby is a game that 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:24.619
 think of the week 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:28.080
 ajax and there 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.080
 was fall i did tell you about it 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.900
 in brussels starts with a needle 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.240
 this piece 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:37.840
 the 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.010
 and continue to build those behind what is trackbacken 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.420
 the market is waiting 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.420
 this shirt 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.350
 in the final 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.350
 warren buffett 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.790
 arriva is not liable the bank 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.440
 no caps fall on sticks let us know doorwerth but we go there 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.030
 of course have about one 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.330
 small topper of 2013 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.520
 I've been for years 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.439
 and of course the biggest groin of 2013, probably five of course 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.040
 yes you are to the exit according to me 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.920
 I am a few last year not many players who already play it 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.039
 6 to bring a little bit yes I think the two are dirty of it 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:25.860
 FC Twente 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.180
 akihito house and not the only one because we do notice that every time you really have to 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.160
 but one 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:36.050
 to be a rockstar developer who is no harm and everything explodes up 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.920
 Every server everyone starts to discuss what's on 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:39.700
 hand 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.550
 if they come as the new screens and as a new trainer would come true doctors 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.530
 just have a look at the end of last year in the singer with a huge 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.500
 one of the information evenings where never so much real it was its own 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.580
 record after record was broken nac where figures see he is probably not the 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:56.300
 only one 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.440
 and perhaps rightly so because what we have seen after having something 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.090
 reduced so far seen yes 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.859
 very much 

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:03.350
 ambitious things yes 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.360
 provided that also for the staff 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.880
 what a legally speaking is going to see something 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.600
 some people a bit on i think it looks very tight yes by far the best 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.779
 rockstar game so far as far as he is concerned 

00:02:13.779 --> 00:02:17.700
 and especially in terms of content it is a game world in our game world 

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:23.259
 with his photos evidence vt4 and san andreas became together yes you say that 

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:26.599
 not normally a lot of technology that games where already cut etc. 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:29.859
 and probably again just as full of short doing the exercises yes 

00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:33.399
 the three characters succeeded so yes indeed that is of course one of the 

00:02:33.399 --> 00:02:36.149
 most important innovations we have always true 

00:02:36.149 --> 00:02:38.299
 jawohl has had a church 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:42.139
 tammy vercetti content of shalit that want to see against alting 

00:02:42.139 --> 00:02:47.029
 san andreas nico bellic will now be the only thing a bit and he the 

00:02:47.029 --> 00:02:49.569
 people who have also faced serious violations 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:53.650
 not the most beloved pet main character but now that's three 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.249
 to choose from who it is that we really got out of my head for because 

00:02:58.249 --> 00:03:02.200
 a stolen pass so that will stand no one who will play in the knife yes 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.929
 he now looks up to you for a few thousand young people at school 

00:03:05.929 --> 00:03:10.039
 and the ones that are actually already inside but no one back in the circuit 

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:11.309
 is being pulled 

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:15.379
 Umicore is that you get a little more mature yes I am you have to be 

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:18.499
 who think of a little bit yes there can already say something not to 

00:03:18.499 --> 00:03:19.039
 long 

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:23.599
 because it has further treat links with the earlier games or or thinking 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:27.479
 or on a separate undoubtedly again the playful course or windows 

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:28.739
 santos that is right 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:30.389
 whatever they clear when the match 

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:33.289
 and david year or profession there will also be said 

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:37.049
 we do not just like in san andreas but it comes a lot but also from the 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:41.809
 whole town so really just 9 extended vanheer family 

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:43.559
 and 

00:03:43.559 --> 00:03:47.399
 the in the second set much more important and that does not go through the 

00:03:47.399 --> 00:03:49.349
 last month 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:51.059
 different during mission 

00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:54.729
 liemerse three can dance to split but yes that quite a bit they put on 

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:58.969
 a larger foods inc it is also true that the moment you are with 

00:03:58.969 --> 00:04:03.729
 because of the so many trainers 9 to the student other trainers do not play 

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:07.609
 but they will keep their own thing so it may be that you 

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:11.259
 For example, sitting in the car slicks took the church tower and when you come back to 

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:13.729
 then you are back in your own apartment but also during 

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:15.589
 missions you will feel 

00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:17.609
 at one time 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:21.290
 one that heads in red at the moment to the trainer with the push of a button 

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:23.879
 according to her and turn your head 

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:27.800
 close with or something like that sometimes the deen does the show for you too 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.259
 completely overhauled or conversation when I mention you look for it yourself 

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:33.729
 choose yes I am very curious how that will work out 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:37.199
 and we will of course go through a lot of club roda stays 

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:39.249
 agreements for fourteen years 

00:04:39.249 --> 00:04:40.009
 of time 

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:43.270
 but i really got down to it we think we are not like that anymore 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:44.320
 quickly things can go wrong 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.870
 what you can read you think let us know in the comments below 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:49.430
 in the four cards 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:53.050
 or was active in years last on the rest will follow jacob 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.069
 we even let us know people 

00:04:56.069 --> 00:04:57.879
 anp
