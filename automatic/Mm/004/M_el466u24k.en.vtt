00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
audio in and audio out so as I mentioned

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.670 
audio in and audio out so as I mentioned
earlier<00:01:19.400> it's<00:01:20.400> an<00:01:20.520> HDMI<00:01:21.090> out<00:01:21.330> so<00:01:22.229> Apple<00:01:22.560> was

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
earlier it's an HDMI out so Apple was

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.850 
earlier it's an HDMI out so Apple was
kind<00:01:22.950> enough<00:01:23.009> to<00:01:23.369> send<00:01:23.640> along<00:01:23.790> and<00:01:24.240> hdmi<00:01:24.990> to

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
kind enough to send along and hdmi to

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.340 
kind enough to send along and hdmi to
DVI<00:01:25.970> adapter<00:01:26.970> so<00:01:27.119> you<00:01:27.210> can<00:01:27.360> basically<00:01:27.509> plug

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350
