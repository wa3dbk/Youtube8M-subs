00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.399 
helix spline shape around the barrel so
to<00:01:41.100> model<00:01:41.250> a<00:01:41.549> helix<00:01:41.970> I<00:01:42.210> need<00:01:42.689> to<00:01:42.780> go<00:01:42.930> to<00:01:42.990> this

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
to model a helix I need to go to this

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.139 
to model a helix I need to go to this
create<00:01:43.740> tab<00:01:44.070> here<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:44.520> then<00:01:44.640> go<00:01:44.759> to<00:01:44.790> shapes

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
create tab here and then go to shapes

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.109 
create tab here and then go to shapes
and<00:01:46.020> then<00:01:46.200> go<00:01:46.290> to<00:01:46.350> helix<00:01:46.770> so<00:01:47.670> when<00:01:47.790> you<00:01:47.909> create

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
and then go to helix so when you create

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.270 
and then go to helix so when you create
the<00:01:48.210> helix<00:01:48.540> you're<00:01:49.140> gonna<00:01:49.259> click<00:01:49.740> and<00:01:49.799> drag

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
the helix you're gonna click and drag

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.530 
the helix you're gonna click and drag
and<00:01:50.549> it's<00:01:50.670> gonna<00:01:50.759> create<00:01:50.909> a<00:01:51.000> circle<00:01:51.329> and<00:01:51.450> then

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
and it's gonna create a circle and then

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.050 
and it's gonna create a circle and then
you<00:01:51.630> drag<00:01:51.869> up<00:01:52.140> and<00:01:52.430> that'll<00:01:53.430> create<00:01:53.579> the<00:01:53.729> helix

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
you drag up and that'll create the helix

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.170 
you drag up and that'll create the helix
so<00:01:54.899> if<00:01:55.200> you<00:01:55.259> click<00:01:55.439> one<00:01:55.470> more<00:01:55.649> time<00:01:55.770> it'll<00:01:56.340> give

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
so if you click one more time it'll give

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.380 
so if you click one more time it'll give
you<00:01:57.299> a<00:01:57.329> narrow<00:01:57.689> or<00:01:57.960> wider<00:01:58.380> topped<00:01:58.950> helix<00:01:59.670> so<00:02:00.360> I

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
you a narrow or wider topped helix so I

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.420 
you a narrow or wider topped helix so I
want<00:02:00.600> it<00:02:00.630> to<00:02:00.689> be<00:02:00.810> about<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.020> same<00:02:01.259> shape<00:02:01.430> so

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
want it to be about the same shape so

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.550 
want it to be about the same shape so
I'm<00:02:02.520> just<00:02:02.610> going<00:02:02.729> to<00:02:02.850> click<00:02:03.479> again<00:02:03.960> and<00:02:04.140> it's

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
I'm just going to click again and it's

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.970 
I'm just going to click again and it's
done

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:06.980 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:09.730 

so<00:02:07.130> now<00:02:07.280> I<00:02:07.820> want<00:02:08.690> to<00:02:08.720> drag<00:02:09.020> this<00:02:09.140> over<00:02:09.320> to<00:02:09.470> the

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740 
so now I want to drag this over to the

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.250 
so now I want to drag this over to the
barrel<00:02:10.010> and<00:02:10.160> fit<00:02:10.550> it<00:02:10.670> around<00:02:10.790> it<00:02:11.180> so<00:02:12.050> that's<00:02:12.200> a

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
barrel and fit it around it so that's a

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.250 
barrel and fit it around it so that's a
little<00:02:12.410> bit<00:02:12.560> too<00:02:12.680> big<00:02:12.890> and<00:02:13.990> I'm<00:02:14.990> going<00:02:15.110> to<00:02:15.170> go

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
little bit too big and I'm going to go

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.860 
little bit too big and I'm going to go
to<00:02:15.410> this<00:02:15.650> modify<00:02:16.040> tab<00:02:16.420> and<00:02:17.420> one<00:02:17.540> mess<00:02:17.690> with<00:02:17.810> the

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
to this modify tab and one mess with the

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.200 
to this modify tab and one mess with the
radius<00:02:18.140> a<00:02:18.230> bit<00:02:18.380> so<00:02:19.280> the<00:02:19.400> bottom<00:02:19.640> radius<00:02:19.910> is

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:20.210 
radius a bit so the bottom radius is

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:23.080 
radius a bit so the bottom radius is
going<00:02:20.960> to<00:02:21.050> be<00:02:21.110> 33<00:02:21.830> I'm<00:02:22.340> going<00:02:22.490> to<00:02:22.550> copy<00:02:22.730> it<00:02:22.940> over

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
going to be 33 I'm going to copy it over

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.650 
going to be 33 I'm going to copy it over
to<00:02:23.660> the<00:02:23.780> top<00:02:23.990> the<00:02:24.920> radius<00:02:25.220> too<00:02:25.430> and<00:02:26.390> it<00:02:26.510> should

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
to the top the radius too and it should

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.550 
to the top the radius too and it should
fit<00:02:26.780> around<00:02:26.900> it<00:02:27.050> pretty<00:02:27.260> well<00:02:29.350> now<00:02:30.350> I<00:02:30.380> want<00:02:30.440> to

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
fit around it pretty well now I want to

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.030 
fit around it pretty well now I want to
mess<00:02:30.680> with<00:02:30.710> the<00:02:31.100> amount<00:02:31.310> of<00:02:31.370> turns<00:02:33.010> you<00:02:34.010> can

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
mess with the amount of turns you can

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.250 
mess with the amount of turns you can
mess<00:02:34.520> with<00:02:34.550> it<00:02:34.760> right<00:02:34.880> here<00:02:35.120> I'm<00:02:35.810> gonna<00:02:36.020> do

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
mess with it right here I'm gonna do

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.770 
mess with it right here I'm gonna do
like<00:02:36.920> two<00:02:37.580> and<00:02:37.700> a<00:02:37.730> half<00:02:37.850> turns<00:02:38.060> that<00:02:38.540> seems

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
like two and a half turns that seems

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.420 
like two and a half turns that seems
good<00:02:38.930> enough<00:02:39.170> now<00:02:39.770> I'm<00:02:39.830> going<00:02:39.980> to<00:02:40.040> distort<00:02:40.340> the

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
good enough now I'm going to distort the

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.260 
good enough now I'm going to distort the
spline<00:02:41.180> later<00:02:42.490> so<00:02:43.490> now<00:02:43.580> I<00:02:43.640> want<00:02:43.820> to<00:02:43.850> get<00:02:44.000> this

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.270 
spline later so now I want to get this

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:47.170 
spline later so now I want to get this
chain<00:02:45.080> mesh<00:02:45.320> here<00:02:45.560> to<00:02:45.890> wrap<00:02:46.190> to<00:02:46.730> follow<00:02:46.970> the

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
chain mesh here to wrap to follow the

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.780 
chain mesh here to wrap to follow the
spline<00:02:47.450> exactly<00:02:47.960> and<00:02:48.220> I<00:02:49.220> know<00:02:49.340> I'm<00:02:49.490> only<00:02:49.610> using

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
spline exactly and I know I'm only using

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.210 
spline exactly and I know I'm only using
one<00:02:50.060> but<00:02:50.810> I'm<00:02:50.900> going<00:02:51.110> to<00:02:51.260> be<00:02:51.380> duplicating<00:02:52.100> it

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
one but I'm going to be duplicating it

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.280 
one but I'm going to be duplicating it
along<00:02:52.580> the<00:02:52.760> spline<00:02:52.970> using<00:02:53.870> the<00:02:53.960> path<00:02:54.110> deform

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
along the spline using the path deform

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.710 
along the spline using the path deform

right here under the world space

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.500 
right here under the world space
modifiers<00:03:06.170> so<00:03:06.860> click<00:03:07.040> path<00:03:07.280> deform<00:03:07.490> and<00:03:08.150> then

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
modifiers so click path deform and then

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:09.430 
modifiers so click path deform and then
it's<00:03:08.750> going<00:03:08.900> to<00:03:08.960> give<00:03:09.050> you<00:03:09.110> these<00:03:09.230> options

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
it's going to give you these options

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.760 
it's going to give you these options
here<00:03:09.770> so<00:03:10.130> I<00:03:10.160> wanted<00:03:10.370> to<00:03:10.430> follow<00:03:10.670> this<00:03:11.120> spline

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:11.770 
here so I wanted to follow this spline

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:14.650 
here so I wanted to follow this spline
so<00:03:12.770> this<00:03:13.070> I'm<00:03:13.580> gonna<00:03:13.730> pick<00:03:13.880> the<00:03:13.970> plot<00:03:14.240> the<00:03:14.450> path

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
so this I'm gonna pick the plot the path

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.530 
so this I'm gonna pick the plot the path
in<00:03:14.990> and<00:03:15.170> click<00:03:15.410> the<00:03:15.440> spline<00:03:15.770> and<00:03:16.360> then<00:03:17.360> it's

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
in and click the spline and then it's

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.930 
in and click the spline and then it's
gonna<00:03:17.660> move<00:03:17.990> and<00:03:18.470> stretch<00:03:18.800> and<00:03:18.980> stuff<00:03:19.220> so<00:03:19.820> I'm

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
gonna move and stretch and stuff so I'm

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.130 
gonna move and stretch and stuff so I'm
just<00:03:19.970> gonna<00:03:20.120> click<00:03:20.270> move<00:03:20.450> to<00:03:20.510> path<00:03:20.780> which<00:03:21.050> will

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
just gonna click move to path which will

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.800 
just gonna click move to path which will
kind<00:03:21.230> of<00:03:21.320> fix<00:03:21.530> it<00:03:21.680> and<00:03:21.830> the<00:03:22.790> scale<00:03:23.030> is<00:03:23.300> it's

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
kind of fix it and the scale is it's

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.150 
kind of fix it and the scale is it's
kind<00:03:24.020> of<00:03:24.050> like<00:03:24.170> a<00:03:24.230> bug<00:03:24.410> I<00:03:24.530> guess<00:03:24.709> am<00:03:24.980> i<00:03:25.040> really

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
kind of like a bug I guess am i really

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:30.310 
kind of like a bug I guess am i really
sure<00:03:25.340> I<00:03:25.370> just<00:03:25.610> scale<00:03:25.940> it<00:03:25.970> back<00:03:26.239> down<00:03:29.110> it<00:03:30.110> seems

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:30.320 
sure I just scale it back down it seems

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:33.040 
sure I just scale it back down it seems
good<00:03:30.500> enough<00:03:30.739> and<00:03:30.980> it's<00:03:31.790> still<00:03:31.910> facing<00:03:32.239> up<00:03:32.420> so

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:33.050 
good enough and it's still facing up so

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:35.800 
good enough and it's still facing up so
you<00:03:33.530> want<00:03:33.620> it<00:03:33.739> to<00:03:33.830> follow<00:03:34.220> the<00:03:34.489> path<00:03:34.940> so<00:03:35.570> I'm

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
you want it to follow the path so I'm

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:37.510 
you want it to follow the path so I'm
gonna<00:03:35.900> mess<00:03:36.140> I'm<00:03:36.530> gonna<00:03:36.650> go<00:03:36.800> to<00:03:36.890> the<00:03:36.980> X<00:03:37.130> and

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:37.520 
gonna mess I'm gonna go to the X and

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:40.120 
gonna mess I'm gonna go to the X and
that's<00:03:37.850> to<00:03:38.090> go<00:03:38.480> right<00:03:38.600> into<00:03:38.780> y<00:03:38.989> Y<00:03:39.739> seems<00:03:40.010> like

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130 
that's to go right into y Y seems like

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:41.320 
that's to go right into y Y seems like
it'll<00:03:40.310> work<00:03:40.340> and<00:03:40.700> I'm<00:03:40.910> gonna<00:03:41.000> move<00:03:41.120> it<00:03:41.239> around

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:41.330 
it'll work and I'm gonna move it around

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.750 
it'll work and I'm gonna move it around
the<00:03:41.510> y-axis<00:03:41.980> and<00:03:42.980> there<00:03:43.280> we<00:03:43.370> go<00:03:43.459> you<00:03:43.520> can<00:03:43.670> see

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
the y-axis and there we go you can see

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.970 
the y-axis and there we go you can see
it<00:03:43.940> kind<00:03:44.090> of<00:03:44.120> travels<00:03:44.660> up<00:03:44.780> there<00:03:44.959> and<00:03:45.500> that

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
it kind of travels up there and that

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.460 
it kind of travels up there and that
just<00:03:46.220> lets<00:03:46.340> you<00:03:46.430> know<00:03:46.459> that<00:03:46.580> it's<00:03:46.820> correct<00:03:47.470> so

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
just lets you know that it's correct so

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.170 
just lets you know that it's correct so
now<00:03:48.560> I<00:03:48.590> want<00:03:48.830> the<00:03:48.890> chain<00:03:49.130> to<00:03:49.310> be<00:03:49.459> going<00:03:49.880> all<00:03:50.090> the

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
now I want the chain to be going all the

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.810 
now I want the chain to be going all the
way<00:03:50.209> up<00:03:50.950> so<00:03:51.950> that<00:03:52.070> means<00:03:52.220> I<00:03:52.280> need<00:03:52.370> to<00:03:52.430> duplicate

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:52.820 
way up so that means I need to duplicate

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:56.320 
way up so that means I need to duplicate
it<00:03:52.940> so<00:03:53.680> if<00:03:54.680> I<00:03:55.100> drag<00:03:55.250> along<00:03:55.400> this<00:03:55.820> Y<00:03:55.970> axis<00:03:56.120> here

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:56.330 
it so if I drag along this Y axis here

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:58.090 
it so if I drag along this Y axis here
it's<00:03:56.720> gonna<00:03:56.840> be<00:03:56.930> moving<00:03:57.170> up<00:03:57.230> it<00:03:57.440> so<00:03:57.620> if<00:03:57.860> I<00:03:57.950> just

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:58.100 
it's gonna be moving up it so if I just

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:03.070 
it's gonna be moving up it so if I just
hold<00:03:58.280> shift<00:03:58.340> and<00:03:58.880> copy<00:03:59.090> and<00:03:59.770> drag<00:04:00.770> it'll<00:04:01.900> go<00:04:02.900> up

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:03.080 
hold shift and copy and drag it'll go up

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.630 
hold shift and copy and drag it'll go up
the<00:04:03.230> spline<00:04:03.470> no<00:04:03.770> matter<00:04:03.920> how<00:04:04.040> many<00:04:04.160> copies<00:04:04.520> you

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.640 
the spline no matter how many copies you

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.570 
the spline no matter how many copies you
put<00:04:04.940> so<00:04:05.120> I'm<00:04:05.180> gonna<00:04:05.300> do<00:04:05.450> about<00:04:05.810> 50<00:04:06.580> that's

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:07.580 
put so I'm gonna do about 50 that's

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:09.790 
put so I'm gonna do about 50 that's
that'll<00:04:08.030> be<00:04:08.120> probably<00:04:08.690> too<00:04:09.020> much<00:04:09.140> I'll<00:04:09.380> do<00:04:09.470> 40

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:09.800 
that'll be probably too much I'll do 40

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:14.380 
that'll be probably too much I'll do 40
and<00:04:10.300> it'll<00:04:11.300> travel<00:04:11.480> all<00:04:11.750> the<00:04:11.900> way<00:04:11.959> up<00:04:13.330> now<00:04:14.330> we

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:14.390 
and it'll travel all the way up now we

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:16.180 
and it'll travel all the way up now we
want<00:04:14.630> to<00:04:14.750> move<00:04:14.989> the<00:04:15.260> spline<00:04:15.560> around<00:04:15.680> so<00:04:16.040> that

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
want to move the spline around so that

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.520 
want to move the spline around so that
we<00:04:16.250> can<00:04:16.370> get<00:04:16.459> the<00:04:16.549> chains<00:04:16.820> to<00:04:17.269> kind<00:04:18.079> of<00:04:18.140> be

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530 
we can get the chains to kind of be

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:19.750 
we can get the chains to kind of be
closer<00:04:18.799> to<00:04:18.950> each<00:04:19.010> other<00:04:19.250> instead

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:19.760 
closer to each other instead

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.720 
closer to each other instead
being<00:04:19.970> completely<00:04:20.780> evenly<00:04:21.290> spaced<00:04:21.620> so<00:04:22.580> this

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:22.730 
being completely evenly spaced so this

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:25.090 
being completely evenly spaced so this
two<00:04:22.850> ways<00:04:23.000> to<00:04:23.240> move<00:04:23.330> the<00:04:23.480> spline<00:04:23.750> we<00:04:24.320> can<00:04:24.560> click

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.100 
two ways to move the spline we can click

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.540 
two ways to move the spline we can click
the<00:04:25.190> spline<00:04:25.430> and<00:04:25.670> then<00:04:25.850> use<00:04:26.720> the<00:04:26.900> FFD<00:04:27.350> modifier

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
the spline and then use the FFD modifier

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.220 
the spline and then use the FFD modifier
so<00:04:28.550> if<00:04:28.670> I<00:04:28.760> go<00:04:28.910> to<00:04:28.970> the<00:04:29.270> drop-down<00:04:29.540> list<00:04:29.870> and<00:04:30.080> hit

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:30.230 
so if I go to the drop-down list and hit

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:32.230 
so if I go to the drop-down list and hit
F<00:04:30.520> it'll<00:04:31.520> bring<00:04:31.610> me<00:04:31.700> down<00:04:31.820> to<00:04:31.910> here<00:04:32.030> I'm<00:04:32.150> gonna

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 
F it'll bring me down to here I'm gonna

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.590 
F it'll bring me down to here I'm gonna
use<00:04:32.330> FF<00:04:32.630> d<00:04:32.750> 4x4<00:04:33.260> and<00:04:34.100> then<00:04:34.280> now<00:04:34.610> if<00:04:34.820> I<00:04:34.940> hit<00:04:35.120> one<00:04:35.330> I

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:35.600 
use FF d 4x4 and then now if I hit one I

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.720 
use FF d 4x4 and then now if I hit one I
can<00:04:35.900> move<00:04:35.990> these<00:04:36.140> vertices<00:04:36.410> around<00:04:36.680> so<00:04:37.670> I'm

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:37.730 
can move these vertices around so I'm

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:39.070 
can move these vertices around so I'm
just<00:04:37.850> going<00:04:37.970> to<00:04:38.000> kind<00:04:38.150> of<00:04:38.210> bring<00:04:38.420> this<00:04:38.810> top

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080 
just going to kind of bring this top

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.370 
just going to kind of bring this top
part<00:04:39.290> end

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.510 

that's<00:04:44.380> okay<00:04:44.590> for<00:04:44.650> now<00:04:44.830> so<00:04:45.100> now<00:04:45.220> I'm<00:04:45.310> going<00:04:45.460> to

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520 
that's okay for now so now I'm going to

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.340 
that's okay for now so now I'm going to
convert<00:04:45.880> this<00:04:46.060> to<00:04:46.120> an<00:04:46.449> editable<00:04:46.540> spline<00:04:46.810> so

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:47.350 
convert this to an editable spline so

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:49.710 
convert this to an editable spline so
convert<00:04:47.860> to<00:04:48.729> and<00:04:49.060> then<00:04:49.180> convert<00:04:49.419> to<00:04:49.449> edible

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 
convert to and then convert to edible

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.600 
convert to and then convert to edible
spline<00:04:49.870> now<00:04:50.560> I<00:04:50.590> can<00:04:50.800> move<00:04:50.889> these<00:04:51.130> vertices

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:51.610 
spline now I can move these vertices

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:53.520 
spline now I can move these vertices
around<00:04:51.850> if<00:04:52.120> I<00:04:52.210> wanted<00:04:52.449> to<00:04:52.540> so<00:04:53.290> I'm<00:04:53.380> going<00:04:53.470> to

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:53.530 
around if I wanted to so I'm going to

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:55.620 
around if I wanted to so I'm going to
click<00:04:53.710> one<00:04:53.919> and<00:04:54.160> then<00:04:54.340> use<00:04:54.820> soft<00:04:55.180> selection

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:55.630 
click one and then use soft selection

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:57.960 
click one and then use soft selection
your<00:04:56.020> soft<00:04:56.290> solution<00:04:56.620> might<00:04:56.800> be<00:04:56.830> closed<00:04:57.490> so<00:04:57.880> if

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:57.970 
your soft solution might be closed so if

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:00.350 
your soft solution might be closed so if
you<00:04:58.090> open<00:04:58.449> it<00:04:58.690> and<00:04:58.810> then<00:04:59.680> have<00:04:59.830> it<00:04:59.949> turned<00:05:00.130> on

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 
you open it and then have it turned on

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.900 
you open it and then have it turned on
I'm<00:05:01.360> gonna<00:05:01.630> mess<00:05:02.440> with<00:05:02.620> the<00:05:02.770> fall-off<00:05:03.490> of<00:05:03.639> it

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:03.910 
I'm gonna mess with the fall-off of it

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:07.980 
I'm gonna mess with the fall-off of it
and<00:05:04.889> I<00:05:05.889> think<00:05:05.949> 15<00:05:06.340> is<00:05:06.400> good<00:05:06.720> so<00:05:07.720> I'm<00:05:07.810> going<00:05:07.930> to

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:07.990 
and I think 15 is good so I'm going to

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:13.150 
and I think 15 is good so I'm going to
start<00:05:08.169> moving<00:05:08.560> these<00:05:08.650> around

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:13.160 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.010 

okay<00:05:14.160> so<00:05:14.220> that's<00:05:14.400> kind<00:05:14.520> of<00:05:14.669> a<00:05:14.820> you<00:05:14.880> move<00:05:15.750> the

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.020 
okay so that's kind of a you move the

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:18.140 
okay so that's kind of a you move the
spine<00:05:16.320> around<00:05:16.590> to<00:05:16.830> get<00:05:16.980> the<00:05:17.100> mesh<00:05:17.790> to<00:05:17.940> follow

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:18.150 
spine around to get the mesh to follow

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:20.090 
spine around to get the mesh to follow
around<00:05:18.449> still<00:05:18.720> you<00:05:19.350> should<00:05:19.530> take<00:05:19.740> more<00:05:19.889> time

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:20.100 
around still you should take more time

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:22.790 
around still you should take more time
to<00:05:20.340> get<00:05:20.430> it<00:05:20.610> just<00:05:20.880> the<00:05:21.120> way<00:05:21.210> you<00:05:21.240> want<00:05:21.540> it<00:05:21.800> so

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:22.800 
to get it just the way you want it so

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.830 
to get it just the way you want it so
now<00:05:23.040> let's<00:05:23.250> move<00:05:23.400> on<00:05:23.550> to<00:05:23.669> the<00:05:23.760> next<00:05:23.850> part<00:05:24.090> for

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:24.840 
now let's move on to the next part for

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.000 
now let's move on to the next part for
this<00:05:24.930> setup<00:05:25.169> I'm<00:05:25.410> going<00:05:25.590> to<00:05:25.680> have<00:05:25.830> this

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.010 
this setup I'm going to have this

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:28.280 
this setup I'm going to have this
smaller<00:05:26.280> piece<00:05:26.580> follow<00:05:27.240> a<00:05:27.330> spline<00:05:27.720> along<00:05:28.050> this

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:28.290 
smaller piece follow a spline along this

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:30.800 
smaller piece follow a spline along this
bigger<00:05:28.530> meshes<00:05:28.979> curve<00:05:29.250> here<00:05:29.520> what<00:05:30.449> I<00:05:30.479> need<00:05:30.660> to

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:30.810 
bigger meshes curve here what I need to

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:34.400 
bigger meshes curve here what I need to
do<00:05:30.960> is<00:05:31.169> basically<00:05:32.070> steal<00:05:32.850> a<00:05:33.150> spline<00:05:33.510> from<00:05:34.320> the

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:34.410 
do is basically steal a spline from the

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:37.100 
do is basically steal a spline from the
edge<00:05:34.560> of<00:05:34.889> this<00:05:35.340> bigger<00:05:35.580> mesh<00:05:35.850> and<00:05:36.360> then<00:05:36.780> have

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:37.110 
edge of this bigger mesh and then have

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.290 
edge of this bigger mesh and then have
this<00:05:37.350> use<00:05:38.040> the<00:05:38.160> path<00:05:38.340> deform<00:05:38.550> modifier<00:05:38.820> and

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:39.300 
this use the path deform modifier and

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:42.379 
this use the path deform modifier and
then<00:05:39.419> follow<00:05:39.750> that<00:05:39.960> spline<00:05:41.030> so<00:05:42.030> what<00:05:42.180> I<00:05:42.210> first

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:42.389 
then follow that spline so what I first

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:44.390 
then follow that spline so what I first
need<00:05:42.630> to<00:05:42.660> do<00:05:42.870> is<00:05:43.139> select<00:05:43.710> that<00:05:43.979> edge<00:05:44.130> that<00:05:44.160> I

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:44.400 
need to do is select that edge that I

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.100 
need to do is select that edge that I
want<00:05:44.639> to<00:05:44.970> turn<00:05:45.090> into<00:05:45.270> a<00:05:45.360> splines<00:05:45.660> so<00:05:45.900> I'm<00:05:45.990> going

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:46.110 
want to turn into a splines so I'm going

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:47.480 
want to turn into a splines so I'm going
to<00:05:46.139> go<00:05:46.229> to<00:05:46.290> edible<00:05:46.560> poly<00:05:46.710> because<00:05:47.100> I<00:05:47.190> have<00:05:47.340> the

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:47.490 
to go to edible poly because I have the

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:49.460 
to go to edible poly because I have the
turbosmooth<00:05:47.910> modifier<00:05:47.970> turned<00:05:48.570> on<00:05:48.690> then<00:05:49.380> I

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:49.470 
turbosmooth modifier turned on then I

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:51.650 
turbosmooth modifier turned on then I
have<00:05:49.620> that<00:05:49.770> edge<00:05:49.889> already<00:05:50.280> selected<00:05:50.520> I<00:05:50.850> can

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:51.660 
have that edge already selected I can

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:53.120 
have that edge already selected I can
choose<00:05:51.990> whatever<00:05:52.200> edge<00:05:52.440> I<00:05:52.560> want<00:05:52.740> and<00:05:52.950> create<00:05:53.100> a

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:53.130 
choose whatever edge I want and create a

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:54.350 
choose whatever edge I want and create a
spline<00:05:53.250> from<00:05:53.460> that<00:05:53.610> but<00:05:53.880> I'm<00:05:54.000> going<00:05:54.090> to<00:05:54.210> choose

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:54.360 
spline from that but I'm going to choose

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.810 
spline from that but I'm going to choose
this<00:05:54.570> one<00:05:54.630> here<00:05:54.810> and<00:05:55.550> once<00:05:56.550> you<00:05:56.639> have<00:05:56.790> that

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:56.820 
this one here and once you have that

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:57.969 
this one here and once you have that
edge<00:05:57.000> selected<00:05:57.360> I'm<00:05:57.540> going<00:05:57.660> to<00:05:57.720> right<00:05:57.900> click

00:05:57.969 --> 00:05:57.979 
edge selected I'm going to right click

00:05:57.979 --> 00:06:00.860 
edge selected I'm going to right click
create<00:05:58.979> shape<00:05:59.250> now<00:05:59.940> you<00:06:00.000> get<00:06:00.210> to<00:06:00.389> shape<00:06:00.630> types

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:00.870 
create shape now you get to shape types

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:03.320 
create shape now you get to shape types
for<00:06:01.290> the<00:06:01.530> spline<00:06:01.919> there<00:06:02.639> is<00:06:02.820> smooth<00:06:03.090> and

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:03.330 
for the spline there is smooth and

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:04.640 
for the spline there is smooth and
there's<00:06:03.479> linear<00:06:03.690> smooth<00:06:04.080> it's<00:06:04.320> basically

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:04.650 
there's linear smooth it's basically

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:07.850 
there's linear smooth it's basically
it's<00:06:05.220> a<00:06:05.370> nice<00:06:05.520> smooth<00:06:05.850> spline<00:06:06.240> and<00:06:06.650> linear<00:06:07.650> is

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:07.860 
it's a nice smooth spline and linear is

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:10.070 
it's a nice smooth spline and linear is
gonna<00:06:08.130> be<00:06:08.310> very<00:06:08.940> stepped<00:06:09.539> it's<00:06:09.780> going<00:06:09.930> to<00:06:09.990> be

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:10.080 
gonna be very stepped it's going to be

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.840 
gonna be very stepped it's going to be
the<00:06:10.289> exact<00:06:10.530> same<00:06:10.560> shape<00:06:11.010> of<00:06:11.220> how<00:06:11.340> the<00:06:11.400> edges

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:11.850 
the exact same shape of how the edges

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:14.659 
the exact same shape of how the edges
now<00:06:12.030> so<00:06:12.990> I'm<00:06:13.080> gonna<00:06:13.169> go<00:06:13.320> for<00:06:13.440> smooth<00:06:13.680> and<00:06:13.949> then

00:06:14.659 --> 00:06:14.669 
now so I'm gonna go for smooth and then

00:06:14.669 --> 00:06:17.570 
now so I'm gonna go for smooth and then
to<00:06:14.970> select<00:06:15.150> the<00:06:15.330> spline<00:06:15.510> I<00:06:15.990> have<00:06:16.650> to<00:06:16.800> click

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:17.580 
to select the spline I have to click

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:19.700 
to select the spline I have to click
through<00:06:17.760> these<00:06:17.880> and<00:06:18.330> get<00:06:18.479> it<00:06:18.600> if<00:06:19.320> I<00:06:19.410> drag<00:06:19.620> it

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:19.710 
through these and get it if I drag it

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:22.310 
through these and get it if I drag it
out<00:06:19.830> there<00:06:20.039> it<00:06:20.130> is<00:06:20.570> so<00:06:21.570> now<00:06:21.600> I<00:06:21.720> want<00:06:21.990> this<00:06:22.080> shape

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:22.320 
out there it is so now I want this shape

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:23.930 
out there it is so now I want this shape
to<00:06:22.530> kind<00:06:22.860> of<00:06:22.919> sit<00:06:23.100> on<00:06:23.160> top<00:06:23.370> of<00:06:23.490> the<00:06:23.550> model<00:06:23.820> like

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:23.940 
to kind of sit on top of the model like

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:26.000 
to kind of sit on top of the model like
this<00:06:24.090> so<00:06:24.990> that<00:06:25.020> I<00:06:25.169> can<00:06:25.289> have<00:06:25.590> the<00:06:25.770> smaller

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:26.010 
this so that I can have the smaller

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:28.279 
this so that I can have the smaller
piece<00:06:26.250> follow<00:06:26.550> it<00:06:26.789> so<00:06:27.360> for<00:06:27.810> the<00:06:27.870> same<00:06:28.020> thing<00:06:28.200> as

00:06:28.279 --> 00:06:28.289 
piece follow it so for the same thing as

00:06:28.289 --> 00:06:29.900 
piece follow it so for the same thing as
a<00:06:28.320> chains<00:06:28.620> I'm<00:06:28.889> going<00:06:29.190> to<00:06:29.310> be<00:06:29.400> applying<00:06:29.610> the

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:29.910 
a chains I'm going to be applying the

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:32.120 
a chains I'm going to be applying the
path<00:06:30.120> deform<00:06:30.599> modifier<00:06:30.930> so<00:06:31.889> go<00:06:32.010> to<00:06:32.070> this

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:32.130 
path deform modifier so go to this

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:33.260 
path deform modifier so go to this
drop-down<00:06:32.340> list<00:06:32.639> and<00:06:32.729> then<00:06:32.820> go<00:06:32.970> to<00:06:33.060> path

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:33.270 
drop-down list and then go to path

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:36.230 
drop-down list and then go to path
deform<00:06:33.450> and<00:06:34.229> then<00:06:34.410> pick<00:06:34.770> the<00:06:35.010> path<00:06:35.190> and<00:06:35.550> it

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:36.240 
deform and then pick the path and it

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:41.029 
deform and then pick the path and it
should<00:06:36.479> be<00:06:37.130> right<00:06:38.130> there<00:06:39.740> I'm<00:06:40.740> going<00:06:40.860> to<00:06:40.919> move

00:06:41.029 --> 00:06:41.039 
should be right there I'm going to move

00:06:41.039 --> 00:06:43.190 
should be right there I'm going to move
to<00:06:41.099> path<00:06:41.370> because<00:06:41.760> it<00:06:42.360> always<00:06:42.630> messes<00:06:42.990> it<00:06:43.110> up

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:43.200 
to path because it always messes it up

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:49.279 
to path because it always messes it up
and<00:06:44.450> I'm<00:06:45.450> gonna<00:06:45.599> check<00:06:45.810> which<00:06:45.990> one<00:06:46.229> it<00:06:46.349> is<00:06:46.380> so<00:06:48.289> I

00:06:49.279 --> 00:06:49.289 
and I'm gonna check which one it is so I

00:06:49.289 --> 00:06:50.450 
and I'm gonna check which one it is so I
need<00:06:49.440> to<00:06:49.500> go<00:06:49.590> to<00:06:49.650> the<00:06:49.800> Y<00:06:49.889> then<00:06:50.250> I<00:06:50.280> need<00:06:50.430> to

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:50.460 
need to go to the Y then I need to

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:54.200 
need to go to the Y then I need to
rotate<00:06:50.760> it<00:06:51.120> by<00:06:51.630> 90<00:06:52.080> negative<00:06:53.039> 90<00:06:53.310> there<00:06:53.880> we<00:06:53.940> go

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:54.210 
rotate it by 90 negative 90 there we go

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:55.969 
rotate it by 90 negative 90 there we go
and<00:06:54.300> it's<00:06:54.780> too<00:06:54.900> big<00:06:55.080> so<00:06:55.410> I<00:06:55.440> need<00:06:55.620> to<00:06:55.710> scale<00:06:55.919> it

00:06:55.969 --> 00:06:55.979 
and it's too big so I need to scale it

00:06:55.979 --> 00:07:01.610 
and it's too big so I need to scale it
down<00:06:58.729> okay<00:06:59.760> so<00:07:00.270> again<00:07:00.750> it's<00:07:00.870> on<00:07:00.960> the<00:07:01.050> y-axis<00:07:01.169> so

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:01.620 
down okay so again it's on the y-axis so

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:04.339 
down okay so again it's on the y-axis so
I<00:07:01.680> can<00:07:01.830> hope<00:07:02.490> I<00:07:02.729> can<00:07:03.030> drag<00:07:03.150> it<00:07:03.330> up<00:07:03.840> and<00:07:04.050> down<00:07:04.139> the

00:07:04.339 --> 00:07:04.349 
I can hope I can drag it up and down the

00:07:04.349 --> 00:07:06.500 
I can hope I can drag it up and down the
whole<00:07:04.470> thing<00:07:04.889> so<00:07:05.820> now<00:07:05.910> what<00:07:06.030> I<00:07:06.060> want<00:07:06.210> to<00:07:06.240> do<00:07:06.360> is

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:06.510 
whole thing so now what I want to do is

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:10.850 
whole thing so now what I want to do is
I<00:07:06.599> wanted<00:07:06.810> to<00:07:06.960> hold<00:07:07.470> shift<00:07:07.590> and<00:07:08.039> copy<00:07:08.250> it<00:07:08.430> up<00:07:09.860> so

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:10.860 
I wanted to hold shift and copy it up so

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:14.779 
I wanted to hold shift and copy it up so
I'm<00:07:10.919> gonna<00:07:11.039> do<00:07:11.220> it<00:07:11.250> like<00:07:11.400> 10<00:07:11.849> times<00:07:12.120> 10<00:07:13.789> and

00:07:14.779 --> 00:07:14.789 
I'm gonna do it like 10 times 10 and

00:07:14.789 --> 00:07:17.089 
I'm gonna do it like 10 times 10 and
then<00:07:15.060> go<00:07:15.270> up<00:07:15.419> it<00:07:15.510> like<00:07:15.599> a<00:07:15.660> ramp<00:07:15.900> now<00:07:16.770> this<00:07:16.950> is<00:07:17.070> a

00:07:17.089 --> 00:07:17.099 
then go up it like a ramp now this is a

00:07:17.099 --> 00:07:18.529 
then go up it like a ramp now this is a
cool<00:07:17.280> technique<00:07:17.610> because<00:07:17.940> I<00:07:17.970> use<00:07:18.210> this<00:07:18.330> for

00:07:18.529 --> 00:07:18.539 
cool technique because I use this for

00:07:18.539 --> 00:07:20.750 
cool technique because I use this for
other<00:07:18.780> types<00:07:19.080> of<00:07:19.200> high<00:07:19.410> poly<00:07:19.650> modeling<00:07:20.099> like

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:20.760 
other types of high poly modeling like

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:22.850 
other types of high poly modeling like
say<00:07:21.000> if<00:07:21.060> this<00:07:21.210> is<00:07:21.270> a<00:07:21.390> ship<00:07:21.960> I<00:07:22.229> could<00:07:22.680> do<00:07:22.770> this

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:22.860 
say if this is a ship I could do this

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:24.500 
say if this is a ship I could do this
with<00:07:23.039> armor<00:07:23.340> plating<00:07:23.729> and<00:07:24.060> I<00:07:24.120> could<00:07:24.300> wrap<00:07:24.479> it

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:24.510 
with armor plating and I could wrap it

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:26.719 
with armor plating and I could wrap it
all<00:07:24.810> the<00:07:24.990> way<00:07:25.080> up<00:07:25.110> around<00:07:25.560> the<00:07:25.860> surface

00:07:26.719 --> 00:07:26.729 
all the way up around the surface

00:07:26.729 --> 00:07:28.010 
all the way up around the surface
you<00:07:26.879> need<00:07:26.999> to<00:07:27.089> be<00:07:27.180> careful<00:07:27.360> when<00:07:27.659> using<00:07:27.779> this

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:28.020 
you need to be careful when using this

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:30.140 
you need to be careful when using this
wine<00:07:28.259> because<00:07:28.830> if<00:07:28.979> you<00:07:29.069> move<00:07:29.249> it<00:07:29.430> everything

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:30.150 
wine because if you move it everything

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:32.179 
wine because if you move it everything
else<00:07:30.300> will<00:07:30.449> move<00:07:30.569> along<00:07:30.719> with<00:07:30.990> it<00:07:31.050> and<00:07:31.379> if<00:07:32.129> you

00:07:32.179 --> 00:07:32.189 
else will move along with it and if you

00:07:32.189 --> 00:07:33.649 
else will move along with it and if you
delete<00:07:32.460> it<00:07:32.490> all<00:07:32.909> that<00:07:33.180> path<00:07:33.389> deform

00:07:33.649 --> 00:07:33.659 
delete it all that path deform

00:07:33.659 --> 00:07:36.170 
delete it all that path deform
information<00:07:34.319> is<00:07:34.439> gone<00:07:34.620> it<00:07:35.580> basically<00:07:35.819> acts<00:07:36.029> as

00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:36.180 
information is gone it basically acts as

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:39.739 
information is gone it basically acts as
a<00:07:36.240> parent<00:07:36.629> to<00:07:36.900> these<00:07:37.080> others<00:07:37.939> so<00:07:38.939> I<00:07:39.300> don't

00:07:39.739 --> 00:07:39.749 
a parent to these others so I don't

00:07:39.749 --> 00:07:42.019 
a parent to these others so I don't
usually<00:07:39.919> delete<00:07:40.919> this<00:07:41.069> blind<00:07:41.339> but<00:07:41.729> if<00:07:41.939> you

00:07:42.019 --> 00:07:42.029 
usually delete this blind but if you

00:07:42.029 --> 00:07:43.369 
usually delete this blind but if you
needed<00:07:42.300> to<00:07:42.389> delete<00:07:42.689> this<00:07:42.809> blind<00:07:43.020> and<00:07:43.259> want

00:07:43.369 --> 00:07:43.379 
needed to delete this blind and want

00:07:43.379 --> 00:07:44.659 
needed to delete this blind and want
these<00:07:43.469> meshes<00:07:43.830> to<00:07:44.099> be<00:07:44.189> in<00:07:44.249> their<00:07:44.370> final

00:07:44.659 --> 00:07:44.669 
these meshes to be in their final

00:07:44.669 --> 00:07:47.869 
these meshes to be in their final
position<00:07:45.740> you<00:07:46.740> should<00:07:46.770> right-click<00:07:47.759> the

00:07:47.869 --> 00:07:47.879 
position you should right-click the

00:07:47.879 --> 00:07:49.399 
position you should right-click the
stack<00:07:48.120> the<00:07:48.539> top<00:07:48.749> of<00:07:48.870> the<00:07:48.930> stack<00:07:49.110> and<00:07:49.139> I<00:07:49.289> do

00:07:49.399 --> 00:07:49.409 
stack the top of the stack and I do

00:07:49.409 --> 00:07:51.079 
stack the top of the stack and I do
collapse<00:07:49.710> too<00:07:50.009> this<00:07:50.339> is<00:07:50.460> the<00:07:50.550> only<00:07:50.729> way<00:07:51.029> to

00:07:51.079 --> 00:07:51.089 
collapse too this is the only way to

00:07:51.089 --> 00:07:53.899 
collapse too this is the only way to
collapse<00:07:51.659> the<00:07:51.839> stack<00:07:52.460> you<00:07:53.460> can<00:07:53.610> see<00:07:53.729> there

00:07:53.899 --> 00:07:53.909 
collapse the stack you can see there

00:07:53.909 --> 00:07:55.850 
collapse the stack you can see there
that<00:07:54.120> it's<00:07:54.240> collapsed<00:07:54.719> if<00:07:54.960> I<00:07:55.439> were<00:07:55.559> to<00:07:55.710> go<00:07:55.830> back

00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:55.860 
that it's collapsed if I were to go back

00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:58.129 
that it's collapsed if I were to go back
and<00:07:56.430> then<00:07:56.580> right<00:07:56.999> click<00:07:57.029> convert<00:07:57.870> to<00:07:57.900> a<00:07:57.960> double

00:07:58.129 --> 00:07:58.139 
and then right click convert to a double

00:07:58.139 --> 00:07:59.929 
and then right click convert to a double
poly<00:07:58.319> it<00:07:58.949> will<00:07:59.069> only<00:07:59.219> close<00:07:59.490> what's

00:07:59.929 --> 00:07:59.939 
poly it will only close what's

00:07:59.939 --> 00:08:01.820 
poly it will only close what's
underneath<00:08:00.270> it<00:08:00.509> so<00:08:01.139> only<00:08:01.229> wait<00:08:01.439> to<00:08:01.529> get<00:08:01.649> rid<00:08:01.740> of

00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:01.830 
underneath it so only wait to get rid of

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:03.260 
underneath it so only wait to get rid of
that<00:08:01.949> is<00:08:02.129> to<00:08:02.279> right-click<00:08:02.430> and<00:08:02.759> do<00:08:02.939> collapse

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:03.270 
that is to right-click and do collapse

00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:06.619 
that is to right-click and do collapse
too<00:08:03.949> and<00:08:04.949> you<00:08:05.099> can<00:08:05.520> do<00:08:05.610> that<00:08:05.759> with<00:08:05.879> a<00:08:05.909> rest<00:08:06.149> or

00:08:06.619 --> 00:08:06.629 
too and you can do that with a rest or

00:08:06.629 --> 00:08:08.389 
too and you can do that with a rest or
you<00:08:06.749> can<00:08:06.870> attach<00:08:07.139> this<00:08:07.469> then<00:08:08.129> you<00:08:08.219> can<00:08:08.309> move

00:08:08.389 --> 00:08:08.399 
you can attach this then you can move

00:08:08.399 --> 00:08:10.159 
you can attach this then you can move
them<00:08:08.580> all<00:08:08.699> at<00:08:08.789> once<00:08:08.939> and<00:08:09.240> then<00:08:09.539> or<00:08:09.749> even<00:08:10.020> delete

00:08:10.159 --> 00:08:10.169 
them all at once and then or even delete

00:08:10.169 --> 00:08:12.170 
them all at once and then or even delete
