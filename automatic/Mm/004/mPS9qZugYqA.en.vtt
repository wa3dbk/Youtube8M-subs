from the plastic the plastic is very
uncomfortable<00:00:27.720> I<00:00:27.930> wish<00:00:28.890> this<00:00:29.039> with<00:00:29.279> focus<00:00:29.820> but

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:31.640 
uncomfortable I wish this with focus but

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.549 
uncomfortable I wish this with focus but
the<00:00:32.640> band<00:00:32.940> here<00:00:33.329> is<00:00:33.450> really<00:00:33.690> thin<00:00:34.079> and<00:00:34.110> cheap

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
the band here is really thin and cheap

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.069 
the band here is really thin and cheap
feeling<00:00:34.920> but<00:00:35.850> then<00:00:35.969> again<00:00:36.090> they<00:00:36.329> were<00:00:36.390> 10<00:00:36.690> 99

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079

out of Walgreens you know but there's
probably<00:00:40.800> fit<00:00:41.190> I<00:00:45.079> guess<00:00:46.079> around<00:00:46.739> you<00:00:47.700> know<00:00:47.850> not

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
probably fit I guess around you know not

00:00:48.780 --> 00:01:02.540 
probably fit I guess around you know not
on<00:00:49.020> top<00:00:49.410> of<00:00:49.440> your<00:00:49.649> head<00:00:49.950> but<00:00:50.399> like<00:00:52.070> sort<00:00:53.070> of

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.700 

here

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:15.920 

yeah<00:01:08.280> that's<00:01:09.030> how<00:01:09.150> they<00:01:09.270> fit<00:01:14.450> as<00:01:15.450> far<00:01:15.690> as<00:01:15.810> the

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
yeah that's how they fit as far as the

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.420 
yeah that's how they fit as far as the
quality<00:01:16.140> is<00:01:16.530> concerned<00:01:16.890> they're<00:01:17.190> not<00:01:17.310> all

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
quality is concerned they're not all

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.160 
quality is concerned they're not all
that<00:01:17.460> great<00:01:17.820> I<00:01:18.180> mean<00:01:18.270> they're<00:01:18.600> really<00:01:18.840> loud

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
that great I mean they're really loud

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.900 
that great I mean they're really loud
they're<00:01:19.530> like<00:01:19.680> really<00:01:19.890> loud<00:01:20.190> right<00:01:20.490> here<00:01:20.760> you

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:20.910 
they're like really loud right here you

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:22.490 
they're like really loud right here you
can<00:01:21.060> hear<00:01:21.390> everything<00:01:21.660> is<00:01:21.930> if<00:01:22.080> they<00:01:22.200> were<00:01:22.260> in

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
can hear everything is if they were in

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.040 
can hear everything is if they were in
your<00:01:22.650> ear<00:01:22.800> but<00:01:23.580> as<00:01:24.060> far<00:01:24.360> as<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.570> quality

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:25.050 
your ear but as far as the quality

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.330 
your ear but as far as the quality
there's<00:01:25.290> not<00:01:25.500> all<00:01:25.620> that<00:01:25.650> great<00:01:28.340> durability

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
there's not all that great durability

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.590 
there's not all that great durability
which<00:01:29.580> is<00:01:29.760> something<00:01:29.940> I'm<00:01:30.150> going<00:01:30.270> to<00:01:30.330> start

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
which is something I'm going to start

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.140 
which is something I'm going to start
judging<00:01:31.170> now<00:01:31.470> on<00:01:31.710> my<00:01:31.860> reviews<00:01:32.280> regularly

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
judging now on my reviews regularly

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.330 
judging now on my reviews regularly
seeing<00:01:33.930> as<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.290> Philips<00:01:34.619> headphones<00:01:35.040> I<00:01:35.160> had

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
seeing as the Philips headphones I had

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.190 
seeing as the Philips headphones I had
were<00:01:35.460> very<00:01:35.490> durable<00:01:36.020> either<00:01:37.020> they're<00:01:37.170> not

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
were very durable either they're not

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.680 
were very durable either they're not
durable<00:01:37.710> at<00:01:37.950> all<00:01:38.100> it's<00:01:38.550> just<00:01:38.790> a<00:01:38.910> cheap<00:01:39.150> plastic

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:39.690 
durable at all it's just a cheap plastic

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:41.210 
durable at all it's just a cheap plastic
which<00:01:40.050> is<00:01:40.259> probably<00:01:40.740> wrong<00:01:40.920> I'm<00:01:41.009> going<00:01:41.160> to

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
which is probably wrong I'm going to

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:48.550 
which is probably wrong I'm going to
give<00:01:41.399> these<00:01:41.520> to<00:01:41.790> my<00:01:41.910> friend<00:01:45.740> sorry<00:01:46.740> Logan

they've<00:03:14.360> been<00:03:14.690> looking<00:03:15.170> at<00:03:15.350> some<00:03:15.590> reviews<00:03:15.920> I

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.100 
they've been looking at some reviews I

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.900 
they've been looking at some reviews I
presume<00:03:16.460> and<00:03:17.890> people<00:03:18.890> are<00:03:19.040> mad<00:03:19.250> because<00:03:19.520> the

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
presume and people are mad because the

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:21.850 
presume and people are mad because the
sound<00:03:20.450> isn't<00:03:20.750> as<00:03:20.990> loud<00:03:21.260> as<00:03:21.470> they<00:03:21.590> would<00:03:21.710> like

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.860 
sound isn't as loud as they would like

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:23.650 
sound isn't as loud as they would like
it<00:03:22.010> to<00:03:22.100> be<00:03:22.130> because<00:03:22.580> they<00:03:22.700> enjoy<00:03:23.030> being<00:03:23.330> deaf

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
it to be because they enjoy being deaf

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.950 
it to be because they enjoy being deaf
so<00:03:24.560> they<00:03:24.830> included<00:03:25.700> I<00:03:25.910> forget<00:03:26.390> the<00:03:26.510> features

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:26.960

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
like that it's really complicated that's

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.400 
like that it's really complicated that's
why<00:03:32.630> I<00:03:32.660> was<00:03:32.840> tripping<00:03:33.170> over<00:03:33.230> words<00:03:34.270> it's<00:03:35.270> the

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
why I was tripping over words it's the

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:46.740 
why I was tripping over words it's the

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
it's just really uncomfortable and

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:51.610 
it's just really uncomfortable and
