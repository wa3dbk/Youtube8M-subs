00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.389 
moving head and what you have here is
pretty<00:00:39.210> much<00:00:39.420> a<00:00:39.750> quad<00:00:40.530> color<00:00:40.800> leds<00:00:41.219> you<00:00:41.309> have

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
pretty much a quad color leds you have

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.160 
pretty much a quad color leds you have
12<00:00:41.730> of<00:00:41.850> them<00:00:42.000> there<00:00:42.180> 10<00:00:42.360> wants<00:00:42.660> a<00:00:42.690> piece<00:00:42.930> so

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
12 of them there 10 wants a piece so

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.920 
12 of them there 10 wants a piece so
that's<00:00:43.649> red<00:00:43.890> green<00:00:44.250> blue<00:00:44.550> and<00:00:44.579> white<00:00:45.000> and<00:00:45.300> with

that's red green blue and white and with

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.330 
that's red green blue and white and with
that<00:00:46.110> you<00:00:46.170> can<00:00:46.289> do<00:00:46.469> all<00:00:46.500> your<00:00:46.770> color<00:00:46.980> mixing

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
that you can do all your color mixing

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.590 
that you can do all your color mixing
just<00:00:47.579> so<00:00:47.700> if<00:00:47.879> you're<00:00:48.030> controlling<00:00:48.390> through

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
just so if you're controlling through

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.500 
just so if you're controlling through
DMX<00:00:49.079> it<00:00:50.010> has<00:00:50.160> different<00:00:50.370> DMX<00:00:50.879> channel<00:00:51.270> modes

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
DMX it has different DMX channel modes

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.689 
DMX it has different DMX channel modes
so<00:00:51.930> if<00:00:52.020> you<00:00:52.110> want<00:00:52.260> to<00:00:52.350> use<00:00:52.500> it<00:00:52.710> in<00:00:52.949> a<00:00:53.190> basic<00:00:53.520> mode

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
so if you want to use it in a basic mode

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.639 
so if you want to use it in a basic mode
about<00:00:54.000> 10<00:00:54.210> channels<00:00:54.480> you<00:00:54.750> could<00:00:54.870> do<00:00:54.989> that<00:00:55.140> you

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
about 10 channels you could do that you

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.049 
about 10 channels you could do that you
still<00:00:55.890> get<00:00:55.980> some<00:00:56.129> awesome<00:00:56.489> program<00:00:56.730> of

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
still get some awesome program of

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.880 
still get some awesome program of
capabilities<00:00:57.690> out<00:00:57.840> of<00:00:57.960> it<00:00:58.079> of<00:00:58.440> course<00:00:58.739> full

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
capabilities out of it of course full

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.119 
capabilities out of it of course full
pan<00:00:59.129> and<00:00:59.340> tilt<00:00:59.660> extremely<00:01:00.660> fast<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.260> one<00:01:02.070> of

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
pan and tilt extremely fast and one of

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.529 
pan and tilt extremely fast and one of
the<00:01:02.219> great<00:01:02.430> things<00:01:02.460> about<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:03.000> vortex<00:01:03.390> when

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
the great things about the vortex when

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.299 
the great things about the vortex when
i'll<00:01:03.629> show<00:01:03.780> you<00:01:03.840> in<00:01:03.899> just<00:01:03.960> a<00:01:04.110> second<00:01:04.530> you<00:01:05.129> can

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
i'll show you in just a second you can

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.130 
i'll show you in just a second you can
actually<00:01:05.610> control<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.090> mirror<00:01:06.720> here<00:01:06.780> it<00:01:07.049> has

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
actually control the mirror here it has

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.750 
actually control the mirror here it has
an<00:01:07.290> infinite<00:01:07.590> rotation<00:01:08.250> in<00:01:08.340> either<00:01:08.490> direction

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
an infinite rotation in either direction

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.390 
an infinite rotation in either direction
and<00:01:09.299> what<00:01:09.930> that<00:01:10.080> does<00:01:10.290> is<00:01:10.350> this<00:01:11.010> special

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
and what that does is this special

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.250 
and what that does is this special
mirror<00:01:11.640> will<00:01:11.790> actually<00:01:12.150> open<00:01:12.299> up<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.750> beam<00:01:13.080> on

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
mirror will actually open up the beam on

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.660 
mirror will actually open up the beam on
this<00:01:13.439> so<00:01:13.619> if<00:01:13.710> you<00:01:13.799> could<00:01:13.920> see<00:01:14.100> this<00:01:14.280> on<00:01:14.430> camera

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
this so if you could see this on camera

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.270 
this so if you could see this on camera
it'll<00:01:15.540> open<00:01:15.689> from<00:01:16.259> a<00:01:16.350> 10<00:01:16.560> degree<00:01:16.710> all<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.220> way

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
it'll open from a 10 degree all the way

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.580 
it'll open from a 10 degree all the way
up<00:01:17.369> to<00:01:17.430> a<00:01:17.520> 44<00:01:18.030> degree<00:01:18.330> and<00:01:18.540> not<00:01:19.080> only<00:01:19.200> does<00:01:19.439> it

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
up to a 44 degree and not only does it

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.830 
up to a 44 degree and not only does it
rotate<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:20.280> zoom<00:01:20.340> but<00:01:21.299> as<00:01:21.390> it's<00:01:21.570> doing<00:01:21.689> that

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
rotate and zoom but as it's doing that

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.100 
rotate and zoom but as it's doing that
causes<00:01:22.439> for<00:01:22.560> a<00:01:22.619> crazy<00:01:23.130> effect<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:23.970> I'll<00:01:24.900> show

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
causes for a crazy effect and I'll show

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.630 
causes for a crazy effect and I'll show
you<00:01:25.140> real<00:01:25.350> quick<00:01:25.560> how<00:01:25.590> fast<00:01:26.070> that<00:01:26.250> mirror<00:01:26.520> can

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
you real quick how fast that mirror can

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.380 
you real quick how fast that mirror can
spin<00:01:27.560> so<00:01:28.560> absolutely<00:01:29.340> amazing<00:01:29.880> effect<00:01:30.210> I've

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
spin so absolutely amazing effect I've

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.760 
spin so absolutely amazing effect I've
never<00:01:30.540> seen<00:01:30.720> anything<00:01:30.960> like<00:01:31.110> it<00:01:31.259> I'm<00:01:31.560> real

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
never seen anything like it I'm real

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.440 
never seen anything like it I'm real
excited<00:01:31.920> and<00:01:32.400> I<00:01:32.520> was<00:01:32.729> happy<00:01:32.970> to<00:01:33.030> use<00:01:33.150> it<00:01:33.270> in<00:01:33.360> my

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
excited and I was happy to use it in my

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.840 
excited and I was happy to use it in my
program<00:01:33.900> but<00:01:34.439> that's<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.770> vortex<00:01:35.159> 1200<00:01:35.670> once

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
program but that's the vortex 1200 once
