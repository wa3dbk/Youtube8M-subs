 sub-20 there is not a possibility to talk to 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:14.380
 we want you to tell us why 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:16.270
 You were one of the team's figures and 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:18.550
 of the tournament 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:22.300
 the experience very good for me and for 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:24.580
 the whole group that was because it happened 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.710
 although we were focused on 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:28.119
 do things well and equal win every 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.460
 party and thank God Lord too 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:32.169
 another did not know that he could not play for the 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:35.470
 transgender group and had many 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:38.980
 Wanting to go competing there they asked 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:41.580
 to caesar he wanted to go because he wanted 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.840
 to play football and good was like that 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:46.690
 I demonstrated the conditions that I have and 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:49.630
 well, each match gave the best of 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:52.300
 me for the team and it went all in river 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:56.079
 you saw your participation in that cup as 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:57.579
 the previous preparation or ideal for them 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:00.640
 for this season I felt of the year 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:03.070
 way that is very very well very 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.630
 concentrated quiet that freedom 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.920
 it's already happened now I had one in a 

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:08.740
 preseason of 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.780
 100 just do not give the best for the club and 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:14.200
 for me personally and for me personally 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:16.780
 and it also relieves you in some way that 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.860
 arrive does not get reinforced above because of 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.899
 some way it also gives you more chance 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.539
 to have more continuity in the first 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:25.630
 team or the best of a 9 when there 

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:27.100
 a lot of competition but if it's for 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.990
 to do is so good, there's no need 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.759
 face it as it is and do the best 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.789
 to be able to play think a certain way 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:35.920
 that the whole rival world thinks well is 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:38.080
 juani casares is a game with a lot 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.119
 kind of style that you look for you like 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:43.149
 the fan and that always but good 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:45.369
 millionaire quarry that pisa generates you 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:48.130
 certain nervousness to say it of a 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:51.880
 way do not always run like I say 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:54.670
 what do I deal with everything so I avoid it 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:57.429
 so as not to be too nervous he is not 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:59.979
 very common and that everything goes well and 

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:01.509
 good always has always been that good 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:04.030
 I hope not everything comes into play to be 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:06.480
 Creative personals for the tournament 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:09.150
 initial approaching 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:10.920
 they are aiming to at least earn a 

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:12.990
 place within the substitutes or from 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.840
 entry to go to ownership not by 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.610
 now win between the concentrates and 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.040
 then fight the between the holders 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.960
 that I like I always like to be 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.220
 between eleven but good for now there 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.220
 than fight it between the 18
