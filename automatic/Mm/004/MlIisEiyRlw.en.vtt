from China the battery management system
is<00:02:59.330> from<00:02:59.840> Western<00:03:00.230> Australia<00:03:00.709> there<00:03:01.430> is<00:03:01.640> a

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
is from Western Australia there is a

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.330 
is from Western Australia there is a
small<00:03:03.140> things<00:03:03.530> I'm<00:03:03.680> trying<00:03:03.709> to<00:03:03.980> think<00:03:04.010> what<00:03:04.250> it

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
small things I'm trying to think what it

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.670 
small things I'm trying to think what it
was<00:03:04.459> but<00:03:04.610> I<00:03:04.730> can't<00:03:04.970> remember<00:03:05.180> I<00:03:05.360> from<00:03:05.900> Belgium

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
was but I can't remember I from Belgium

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.589 
was but I can't remember I from Belgium
Holland<00:03:07.040> is<00:03:07.459> part<00:03:08.090> of<00:03:08.209> the<00:03:08.330> battery

00:03:08.589 --> 00:03:08.599 
Holland is part of the battery

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:10.750 
Holland is part of the battery
management<00:03:08.780> system<00:03:09.349> so<00:03:09.980> it's<00:03:10.280> really<00:03:10.430> it's<00:03:10.640> a

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
management system so it's really it's a

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.020 
management system so it's really it's a
very<00:03:10.970> international<00:03:11.209> care<00:03:11.739> so<00:03:12.790> my<00:03:13.790> next

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
very international care so my next

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:15.820 
very international care so my next
question<00:03:14.120> was<00:03:14.480> about<00:03:14.660> being<00:03:15.380> part<00:03:15.590> of<00:03:15.709> a<00:03:15.799> team

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
question was about being part of a team

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:18.729 
question was about being part of a team
and<00:03:16.310> I<00:03:16.400> guess<00:03:16.870> yeah<00:03:17.870> that's<00:03:18.079> pretty<00:03:18.260> much<00:03:18.380> what

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:18.739 
and I guess yeah that's pretty much what

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:20.530 
and I guess yeah that's pretty much what
got<00:03:18.920> it<00:03:19.040> together<00:03:19.190> that's<00:03:19.760> absolutely<00:03:20.359> right

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
got it together that's absolutely right

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.819 
got it together that's absolutely right
and<00:03:20.870> we<00:03:21.410> had<00:03:21.590> a<00:03:22.840> electro<00:03:23.840> engineer<00:03:24.200> who<00:03:24.530> did

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:24.829 
and we had a electro engineer who did

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:27.520 
and we had a electro engineer who did

time at a dollar 44 a litre of petrol
will<00:04:47.580> pay<00:04:47.790> itself<00:04:48.120> back<00:04:48.240> yep<00:04:48.690> saving<00:04:49.170> you<00:04:49.470> know

will pay itself back yep saving you know

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:51.590 
will pay itself back yep saving you know
thousands<00:04:50.220> of<00:04:50.340> dollars<00:04:50.640> really<00:04:51.030> easily

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:51.600 
thousands of dollars really easily

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.210 
thousands of dollars really easily
overcoming<00:04:52.290> the<00:04:52.440> price<00:04:52.650> of<00:04:52.860> the<00:04:52.920> batteries

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 
overcoming the price of the batteries

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.520 
overcoming the price of the batteries
okay<00:04:53.700> so<00:04:53.780> that's<00:04:54.780> very<00:04:54.870> interesting<00:04:55.110> because

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:55.530 
okay so that's very interesting because

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:57.710 
okay so that's very interesting because
one<00:04:55.860> of<00:04:55.890> the<00:04:56.160> arguments<00:04:56.730> at<00:04:57.180> the<00:04:57.300> moment<00:04:57.600> is

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 
one of the arguments at the moment is

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.800 
one of the arguments at the moment is
that<00:04:57.750> the<00:04:58.650> payback<00:04:59.130> time<00:04:59.400> for<00:04:59.780> electric<00:05:00.780> cars

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:00.810 
that the payback time for electric cars

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:04.640 
that the payback time for electric cars
doesn't<00:05:01.680> figure<00:05:02.670> into<00:05:03.000> modern<00:05:03.810> economics<00:05:04.440> and

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:04.650 
doesn't figure into modern economics and

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:06.710 
doesn't figure into modern economics and
family<00:05:05.100> economics<00:05:05.940> but<00:05:06.180> what<00:05:06.390> you're<00:05:06.540> saying

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:06.720 
family economics but what you're saying

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.800 
family economics but what you're saying
is<00:05:06.930> if<00:05:07.140> you<00:05:07.260> keep<00:05:07.440> the<00:05:07.620> car<00:05:08.390> which<00:05:09.390> is<00:05:09.540> another

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:09.810 
is if you keep the car which is another

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.740 
is if you keep the car which is another
good<00:05:10.050> contribution<00:05:10.770> to<00:05:10.920> the<00:05:11.660> environment<00:05:12.660> as

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:12.750 
good contribution to the environment as

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:14.150 
good contribution to the environment as
I<00:05:12.870> think<00:05:13.110> that<00:05:13.230> it<00:05:13.350> will<00:05:13.500> pay<00:05:13.740> itself<00:05:14.040> back

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.160 
I think that it will pay itself back

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.070 
I think that it will pay itself back
because<00:05:14.790> I<00:05:14.940> think<00:05:15.000> what<00:05:15.360> people<00:05:15.510> forget<00:05:15.840> is

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 
because I think what people forget is

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.320 
because I think what people forget is
that<00:05:16.320> they're<00:05:17.010> looking<00:05:17.310> at<00:05:17.580> buying<00:05:17.760> a<00:05:17.970> really

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:18.330 
that they're looking at buying a really

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:22.790 
that they're looking at buying a really
nice<00:05:18.930> fancy<00:05:19.350> you<00:05:20.130> know<00:05:20.250> new<00:05:20.790> little<00:05:21.480> car<00:05:22.110> that

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:22.800 
nice fancy you know new little car that

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.980 
nice fancy you know new little car that
will<00:05:23.520> use<00:05:23.820> a<00:05:23.850> lot<00:05:24.030> less<00:05:24.060> petrol<00:05:24.570> and<00:05:24.690> think<00:05:24.840> our

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:24.990 
will use a lot less petrol and think our

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:27.170 
will use a lot less petrol and think our
hands<00:05:25.230> weren't<00:05:25.410> wonderful<00:05:25.950> but<00:05:26.130> yet<00:05:26.850> they're

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:27.180
