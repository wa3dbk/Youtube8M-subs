00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
down on to my bucket and I'm going to

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.039 
down on to my bucket and I'm going to
put<00:03:22.030> two<00:03:22.239> of<00:03:22.269> them<00:03:22.510> on<00:03:22.569> there<00:03:22.780> they<00:03:22.900> weigh

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:23.049 
put two of them on there they weigh

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:44.360 
put two of them on there they weigh

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.839 

so<00:03:45.370> you<00:03:45.459> can<00:03:45.609> see<00:03:45.760> my<00:03:46.319> Forks<00:03:47.319> are<00:03:47.760> holding<00:03:48.760> up

00:03:48.839 --> 00:03:48.849 
so you can see my Forks are holding up

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:50.789 
so you can see my Forks are holding up
about<00:03:49.090> a<00:03:49.150> hundred<00:03:49.299> pounds<00:03:49.989> which<00:03:50.439> is<00:03:50.590> pretty

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:50.799 
about a hundred pounds which is pretty

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:54.890 
about a hundred pounds which is pretty
good<00:03:51.689> so<00:03:52.689> now<00:03:52.810> I'm<00:03:52.930> going<00:03:53.079> to<00:03:53.170> move<00:03:53.980> them<00:03:54.219> over

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
good so now I'm going to move them over

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:02.530 
good so now I'm going to move them over
to<00:03:55.900> the<00:03:56.079> pumpkin<00:03:56.439> patch

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:07:43.230 

you

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:43.240 

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:47.140 

as<00:07:44.240> you<00:07:44.420> can<00:07:44.540> see<00:07:44.780> they<00:07:45.140> held<00:07:45.920> up<00:07:46.220> quite<00:07:46.490> a<00:07:47.000> bit

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:47.150 
as you can see they held up quite a bit

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:49.270 
as you can see they held up quite a bit
of<00:07:47.210> weight<00:07:47.330> there<00:07:47.660> made<00:07:47.960> it<00:07:48.080> easier<00:07:48.410> for<00:07:48.740> me<00:07:49.160> to

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:49.280 
of weight there made it easier for me to
