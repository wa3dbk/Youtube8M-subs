00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
pictures it the photos don't quite do it

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.580 
pictures it the photos don't quite do it
justice<00:00:47.070> it's<00:00:47.820> a<00:00:48.120> little<00:00:48.899> hard<00:00:49.110> to<00:00:49.230> see<00:00:49.440> but

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
justice it's a little hard to see but

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.779 
justice it's a little hard to see but
the<00:00:49.770> line<00:00:50.010> here<00:00:50.899> around<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.280> the<00:00:53.280> activator

this<00:00:54.390> bump-out<00:00:55.170> is<00:00:55.610> actually<00:00:56.610> kind<00:00:56.850> of

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
this bump-out is actually kind of

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.790 
this bump-out is actually kind of
rounded<00:00:57.510> at<00:00:58.199> this<00:00:58.559> this<00:00:59.399> joint<00:00:59.760> here<00:01:00.620> which<00:01:01.620> is

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
rounded at this this joint here which is

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.319 
rounded at this this joint here which is
nice<00:01:01.949> it's<00:01:02.219> rounded<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:02.699> same<00:01:02.910> way<00:01:03.059> as<00:01:03.210> the

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
nice it's rounded the same way as the

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.390 
nice it's rounded the same way as the
grooves<00:01:03.600> are<00:01:03.899> so<00:01:04.290> it's<00:01:04.439> a<00:01:04.530> lot<00:01:04.680> smoother<00:01:05.280> as

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
grooves are so it's a lot smoother as

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.280 
grooves are so it's a lot smoother as
opposed<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:05.939> boxy<00:01:06.420> look<00:01:06.659> that<00:01:06.869> you<00:01:06.960> see<00:01:07.170> in

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
opposed to the boxy look that you see in

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.810 
opposed to the boxy look that you see in
pictures<00:01:09.710> got<00:01:10.710> it<00:01:10.799> with<00:01:10.920> a<00:01:10.950> mid-grade<00:01:11.189> blade
