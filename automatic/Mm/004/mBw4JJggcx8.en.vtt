fine because the the stock one will come

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.890

actually<00:01:22.470> up<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:22.890> here<00:01:23.189> so<00:01:23.939> as<00:01:24.180> you<00:01:24.270> can<00:01:24.420> see<00:01:24.479> it

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
actually up to here so as you can see it

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.899 
actually up to here so as you can see it
will<00:01:25.020> interfere<00:01:25.259> with<00:01:25.770> anything<00:01:26.040> higher<00:01:26.880> than

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
will interfere with anything higher than

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.749 
will interfere with anything higher than
a<00:01:27.180> four<00:01:27.390> count<00:01:27.630> so<00:01:28.409> since<00:01:29.100> this<00:01:29.250> was<00:01:29.460> a<00:01:29.490> five

gulfstream<00:02:04.170> sights<00:02:04.439> which<00:02:04.649> is<00:02:04.799> one<00:02:04.950> of<00:02:05.009> the

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
gulfstream sights which is one of the

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.709 
gulfstream sights which is one of the
reasons<00:02:05.399> why<00:02:05.549> I<00:02:05.579> bought<00:02:05.820> it<00:02:05.850> over<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.299> partner

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
reasons why I bought it over the partner
