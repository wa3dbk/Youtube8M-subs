a decision to try to travel as light as
I<00:01:12.570> can<00:01:12.810> largely<00:01:13.140> I<00:01:13.500> travel<00:01:14.189> by<00:01:14.400> myself<00:01:14.880> I<00:01:15.689> find

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
I can largely I travel by myself I find

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.499 
I can largely I travel by myself I find
it's<00:01:16.380> easier<00:01:16.799> to<00:01:17.070> kind<00:01:17.310> of<00:01:17.400> work<00:01:17.520> alone<00:01:17.850> so<00:01:18.330> and

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
it's easier to kind of work alone so and

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.600 
it's easier to kind of work alone so and
I<00:01:18.570> think<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:18.930> kit<00:01:19.110> reflects<00:01:19.500> that<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:19.950> I've

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
I think the kit reflects that and I've

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.780 
I think the kit reflects that and I've
discovered<00:01:20.939> that<00:01:21.680> by<00:01:22.680> buying<00:01:23.070> buying<00:01:23.490> the

a<00:02:18.980> couple<00:02:19.519> of<00:02:19.640> extension<00:02:20.420> tubes<00:02:20.629> here<00:02:20.959> that<00:02:21.260> I

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
a couple of extension tubes here that I

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:22.569 
a couple of extension tubes here that I
use<00:02:21.530> actually<00:02:21.799> quite<00:02:22.189> frequently

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:22.579 
use actually quite frequently
