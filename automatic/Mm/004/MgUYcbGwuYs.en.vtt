00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:05.800 
loves it but I just feel like she

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.410 
loves it but I just feel like she
doesn't<00:02:06.100> have<00:02:06.220> the<00:02:06.310> same<00:02:06.490> elevation<00:02:06.970> from<00:02:07.240> the

doesn't have the same elevation from the
floor<00:02:07.630> and<00:02:07.780> I<00:02:07.840> have<00:02:07.930> a<00:02:07.990> look<00:02:08.140> at<00:02:08.229> her<00:02:08.380> heel

floor and I have a look at her heel
sometimes<00:02:09.759> when<00:02:10.119> she's<00:02:10.690> pivoting<00:02:12.780> so<00:02:13.780> that's

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960 
sometimes when she's pivoting so that's

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.250 
sometimes when she's pivoting so that's
the<00:02:14.080> throw<00:02:14.380> off<00:02:14.710> the<00:02:15.040> back<00:02:15.190> of<00:02:15.310> the<00:02:15.370> foot<00:02:16.260> just

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
the throw off the back of the foot just

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.440 
the throw off the back of the foot just
a<00:02:17.410> foot<00:02:17.680> work<00:02:17.920> was<00:02:18.160> not<00:02:18.340> as<00:02:18.490> precise<00:02:18.910> perhaps

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
a foot work was not as precise perhaps

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.940 
a foot work was not as precise perhaps
as<00:02:19.720> I<00:02:19.990> think<00:02:20.890> shown<00:02:21.820> by<00:02:22.060> nicely<00:02:22.510> Johnston<00:02:22.990> but

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
as I think shown by nicely Johnston but

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.590 
as I think shown by nicely Johnston but
she<00:02:24.220> does<00:02:24.370> have<00:02:24.580> high<00:02:24.730> degree<00:02:25.060> of<00:02:25.090> difficulty

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
she does have high degree of difficulty

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.420 
she does have high degree of difficulty
in<00:02:25.720> that<00:02:25.900> routine<00:02:26.260> and<00:02:26.530> she<00:02:26.620> will<00:02:26.800> be<00:02:26.950> rewarded

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
in that routine and she will be rewarded

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.590 
in that routine and she will be rewarded
