something just gorgeous
then<00:00:23.369> I<00:00:23.490> suggest<00:00:23.760> go<00:00:24.390> bold<00:00:24.800> use<00:00:25.800> bold<00:00:26.310> colors

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
then I suggest go bold use bold colors

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.960 
then I suggest go bold use bold colors
with<00:00:26.970> your<00:00:27.650> fabrics<00:00:28.650> don't<00:00:29.429> use<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.760> same

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
with your fabrics don't use the same

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.400 
with your fabrics don't use the same
colors<00:00:30.769> use<00:00:31.769> thicker<00:00:32.489> threads<00:00:32.969> like<00:00:33.930> brights

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
colors use thicker threads like brights

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.040 
colors use thicker threads like brights
use<00:00:35.190> shiny<00:00:35.520> threads<00:00:36.030> like<00:00:36.270> highlights<00:00:36.809> or

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
use shiny threads like highlights or

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.369 
use shiny threads like highlights or
rainbows<00:00:37.610> variegated<00:00:38.610> threads<00:00:39.059> use<00:00:39.989> threads

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
rainbows variegated threads use threads

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.290 
rainbows variegated threads use threads
like<00:00:40.739> metallics<00:00:41.399> that<00:00:41.550> are<00:00:41.820> going<00:00:41.969> to<00:00:42.059> shine

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
like metallics that are going to shine

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.760 
like metallics that are going to shine

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
nice Sheen to it and so I chose to use

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.840 
nice Sheen to it and so I chose to use
glitter<00:00:54.809> which<00:00:55.289> is<00:00:55.469> a<00:00:55.500> very<00:00:55.890> flat<00:00:56.250> shiny

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
glitter which is a very flat shiny

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.090 
glitter which is a very flat shiny
thread<00:00:57.510> now<00:00:57.870> you<00:00:57.930> can<00:00:58.230> put<00:00:58.440> a<00:00:58.469> lot<00:00:58.739> of<00:00:58.890> glitter

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
thread now you can put a lot of glitter

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.250 
thread now you can put a lot of glitter
on<00:00:59.250> and<00:00:59.699> it's<00:01:00.000> very<00:01:00.420> pretty<00:01:00.629> you<00:01:00.899> can<00:01:01.050> put<00:01:01.230> a

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
on and it's very pretty you can put a

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.900 
on and it's very pretty you can put a
little<00:01:01.649> bit<00:01:01.770> of<00:01:01.890> glitter<00:01:02.100> on<00:01:02.219> and<00:01:02.640> it's<00:01:02.789> still

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
little bit of glitter on and it's still

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.579 
little bit of glitter on and it's still
really<00:01:03.420> pretty<00:01:03.629> that's<00:01:04.019> what<00:01:04.260> I<00:01:04.290> like<00:01:04.559> about

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
really pretty that's what I like about

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.980 
really pretty that's what I like about
this<00:01:05.129> but<00:01:05.400> you<00:01:05.519> get<00:01:05.700> a<00:01:05.729> lot<00:01:06.030> of<00:01:06.210> shine<00:01:06.479> for<00:01:06.900> the

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
this but you get a lot of shine for the

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.140 
this but you get a lot of shine for the
amount<00:01:07.200> of<00:01:07.350> thread<00:01:07.590> that<00:01:07.710> you<00:01:07.860> put<00:01:08.070> in<00:01:08.280> so<00:01:08.700> when

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
amount of thread that you put in so when

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.960 
amount of thread that you put in so when
texturizing<00:01:09.780> this<00:01:10.200> I<00:01:10.500> put<00:01:11.159> this<00:01:11.369> on<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.729> top

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
texturizing this I put this on the top

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.080 
texturizing this I put this on the top
and<00:01:12.380> texturize<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.409> fabric<00:01:14.040> so<00:01:14.280> that<00:01:14.310> when<00:01:14.729> it

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
and texturize the fabric so that when it

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.109 
and texturize the fabric so that when it
texturized<00:01:15.780> it<00:01:16.049> pulled<00:01:16.350> up<00:01:16.680> so<00:01:17.490> did<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.880> flat

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
texturized it pulled up so did the flat

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.130 
texturized it pulled up so did the flat
thread<00:01:18.509> therefore<00:01:19.229> you<00:01:19.770> see<00:01:19.979> a<00:01:20.009> lot<00:01:20.369> of<00:01:20.400> shine

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
thread therefore you see a lot of shine

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.539 
thread therefore you see a lot of shine
but<00:01:22.140> it's<00:01:22.320> like<00:01:22.530> little<00:01:22.799> bits<00:01:23.100> of<00:01:23.250> shine

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
but it's like little bits of shine

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.820 
but it's like little bits of shine
because<00:01:23.970> it<00:01:24.180> catches<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.990> flat<00:01:25.259> thread<00:01:25.650> at

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
because it catches the flat thread at

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.070 
because it catches the flat thread at
different<00:01:26.280> intervals<00:01:26.520> and<00:01:27.119> almost<00:01:27.869> looks

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
different intervals and almost looks

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.899 
different intervals and almost looks
like<00:01:28.170> micro<00:01:28.710> beading<00:01:29.100> and<00:01:29.250> I<00:01:29.490> really<00:01:29.729> like

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
like micro beading and I really like

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.160 
like micro beading and I really like
that<00:01:29.939> effect<00:01:30.710> but<00:01:31.710> if<00:01:32.490> I<00:01:32.670> was<00:01:32.850> to<00:01:32.880> put<00:01:33.299> metallic

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
that effect but if I was to put metallic

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.100 
that effect but if I was to put metallic
into<00:01:34.470> something<00:01:34.799> like<00:01:34.920> this<00:01:35.189> and<00:01:36.060> it<00:01:36.750> probably

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
into something like this and it probably

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.200 
into something like this and it probably
be<00:01:37.320> overkill<00:01:37.890> and<00:01:38.130> it<00:01:38.579> probably<00:01:38.970> wouldn't

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
be overkill and it probably wouldn't

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.660 
be overkill and it probably wouldn't
look<00:01:39.329> good<00:01:39.390> so<00:01:40.049> this<00:01:40.740> one<00:01:41.070> I<00:01:41.100> wanted<00:01:41.549> the

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
look good so this one I wanted the

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.030 
look good so this one I wanted the
stitching<00:01:42.119> to<00:01:42.299> recede<00:01:42.720> I<00:01:43.079> didn't<00:01:43.770> want<00:01:43.920> the

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
stitching to recede I didn't want the

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.399 
stitching to recede I didn't want the
thread<00:01:44.310> to<00:01:44.490> show<00:01:44.570> so<00:01:45.570> going<00:01:45.810> with<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:46.200> fine

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
thread to show so going with the fine

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.639 
thread to show so going with the fine
thread<00:01:46.439> like<00:01:47.040> so<00:01:47.340> fine<00:01:47.700> this<00:01:48.390> in<00:01:48.840> a<00:01:49.079> color<00:01:49.350> that

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
thread like so fine this in a color that

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.950 
thread like so fine this in a color that
completely<00:01:50.310> disappears<00:01:50.970> right<00:01:51.299> onto<00:01:51.810> this

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
completely disappears right onto this

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.440 
completely disappears right onto this
fabric<00:01:52.590> so<00:01:52.860> now<00:01:53.159> when<00:01:53.340> I<00:01:53.369> do<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.759> stitching<00:01:54.240> it

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
fabric so now when I do the stitching it

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.870 
fabric so now when I do the stitching it
goes<00:01:54.780> away<00:01:54.990> but<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.560> texture<00:01:56.009> remains<00:01:56.399> it's

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
goes away but the texture remains it's

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.510 
goes away but the texture remains it's
also<00:01:57.119> a<00:01:57.360> bigger<00:01:57.719> stitch<00:01:58.320> because<00:01:58.829> I<00:01:59.070> did<00:01:59.340> one

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
also a bigger stitch because I did one

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.550 
also a bigger stitch because I did one
as<00:01:59.670> much<00:01:59.880> stitching<00:02:00.390> in<00:02:00.509> it<00:02:00.659> and<00:02:00.840> this<00:02:01.140> one<00:02:01.350> is

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
as much stitching in it and this one is

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.830 
as much stitching in it and this one is
great<00:02:01.740> for<00:02:02.250> those<00:02:02.369> who<00:02:02.729> are<00:02:03.090> not<00:02:03.420> so

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
great for those who are not so

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.350 
great for those who are not so
comfortable<00:02:04.170> with<00:02:04.710> their<00:02:04.950> stitching<00:02:05.490> or<00:02:05.670> just

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
comfortable with their stitching or just
