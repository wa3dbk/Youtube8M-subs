00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.720
 very good to all people here playing 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.090
 Canary Islands in a new video and this time 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.740
 I'm going to have a very special video like 

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:10.650
 you will be checking in the title I have 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.909
 I was able to prove the fifa 15 they brought it in 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.039
 exclusive la tenerife lan party 

00:00:11.909 --> 00:00:16.529
 European exclusive say because I already 

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:17.789
 they had taught in the e3 and well we could 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.859
 play what we are here present 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.259
 we could attend a talk 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.660
 producer of fifa 15 who was called 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:27.630
 sebastián enrique was Argentine by 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:31.230
 true and good a little more to say 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:34.290
 Now I'm going to comment on everything you said 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:37.470
 sebastián and everything I could prove that 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:40.980
 it was a demo a beta say of the fifa 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:43.020
 15 to 65% production 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:47.820
 and I 'm going to stop telling you and I'm going to 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:49.200
 start to hear me good first they started 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.360
 showing the trailer that we had already 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.870
 seen that they taught 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:57.330
 come on that they presented in the e3 also 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.030
 then he made a question and answer 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:02.820
 and apart from that he also started to say 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.550
 rolls and things of fifa 15 that I'm going to 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.530
 start explaining 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:09.680
 the first and the most important thing and what 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.570
 fascinated me was that fifa 15 is going to have 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.510
 wear in the field on the lawn 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:18.050
 Special to spend during the game 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:20.180
 the more inputs and more and more we do 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:20.810
 in the field more will wear out though 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.500
 good 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.580
 spent the minutes with the running and the 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.190
 throw and all that is going to go 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.870
 wearing it is going to be noticing the 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.480
 field will not be the same in the 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:34.760
 beginning and in the end and it's one of the 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.230
 things that surprised me the most 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.320
 reactions that are going to put them 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:41.420
 players are going to have more reactions 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.560
 according to the attitude of the player or whatever 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.410
 the player will react in a way 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.000
 or another what your colleagues do for 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:49.070
 example if a partner in the first in 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.140
 the first minutes they shoot and what 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.729
 fails for what they encourage and such but if the 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.260
 mate that keeps failing I keep 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:56.360
 failing since the reactions are going to 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.490
 be more 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.610
 more bad say they are going to take the 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.440
 bronca or not they will spend it 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.790
 started on the machine I mean because 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.200
 man if the controls tubes clear that 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.270
 it can happen but I mean in the 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.460
 machine that if the machine fails fails 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:14.410
 so player are not going to go or be 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:16.710
 they will spend less also saying 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:19.060
 that there is going to be a new engine in the 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:20.740
 new engine in the ball is going to have 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.320
 new movements on the ball will 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:26.890
 be improved in the players too 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:28.930
 are going to be modeled more really for 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:32.290
 that is when a player's ball 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:36.700
 bounce in a more real way this too what 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:39.280
 have also improved visual improvements of 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.380
 the stand will also put the pennant 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.480
 physical who will be able to give the ball in the 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.100
 corner pennant the player is 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.310
 properly they are going to also give 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:50.170
 can hit the pennant 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.300
 and they will not be able to cross it like 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.110
 they were doing recently in the previous 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:57.080
 games 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:59.510
 stringers the sticks when the ball 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:02.020
 in the stick the crossbar will shake 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.120
 also a bit let's say 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:07.210
 and the stands the stands have improved 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.610
 the stadiums of the big teams go 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:11.290
 to stand out from the rest they will have their 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.240
 own animations their own chants 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.400
 good of the songs we already knew 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.990
 but they were already in fifa 14 but this time 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.300
 they will have up their own 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:20.800
 animations your own movements by 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.900
 example to those in Manchester city when 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.960
 they turn their backs to jump the 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:30.040
 The liverpool bonbon with its super 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:33.650
 with their wine when they go out to the field that is 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:35.780
 bestial will also bring 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.970
 for example of the reactions that I get 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:40.189
 forgot to comment on the cheers to a player 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:43.519
 if you start shaving with the same 

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:45.260
 player then after a couple of 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:48.439
 tickets and oil on your face and it starts to 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:52.430
 push things so they are more real than 

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:55.340
 more a lot of things also to the in a 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:57.230
 round of questions and answers 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.030
 he commented on the licenses he 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:00.800
 commented that if the licenses were going to 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:03.260
 having the fifa was going to have the 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:06.530
 champions the uefa europe league I want 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:09.200
 say and the guy did not know how to answer 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:11.959
 He said he was not going to say anything but that in 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:13.310
 the gamescom were already going to talk about it and 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:16.760
 that there was going to be a good and a bad 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:18.199
 news and that left us a little bit 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.680
 wrong there saying to see what they are going to do 

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:23.259
 these crazy people are going to take some 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.090
 in some league or something but good if 

00:04:23.259 --> 00:04:27.250
 they say they are going to have a good 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.479
 news and good news is that it is 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:30.550
 Of course they will remove something and they will 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:32.500
 put something so good we will be 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.539
 attentive also said that they will have 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:37.110
 new game modes new modes 

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:38.940
 game with ultimate in 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:41.010
 and things so they have not said no what 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:42.150
 they could say at that moment but that we 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:43.500
 they said that there is going to be the 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:46.800
 game mode but they did not tell us which 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:49.080
 is also the light is going to notice in a 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.840
 change is going to be noticed if it's a fifa 15 a 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:53.850
 format if you put the lights on 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.460
 contrast of everything you will notice the 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:58.800
 amateurs are clearly going to notice 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:01.740
 and little else also say that you can 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.150
 try it a game with au consume I do not know 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.860
 if you will know that surely yes 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:08.400
 and I lost it over 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:11.340
 see what package I am, that is to say 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:13.610
 the game had a couple of bugs and I was 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:16.889
 65% production so that's what 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:19.650
 will surely improve because that already 

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:21.360
 well they see how we play and you see 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:23.430
 the failures we have and such and the 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:27.090
 failures that has game and apart too 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:30.120
 I was going to tell you that I forgot 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:32.460
 the menu the menu will be again with 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:35.729
 squares like that with the squares of 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:37.350
 those windows 8 types and also the menu 

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:39.720
 before starting the game when 

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:41.790
 you go to team management options 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:44.550
 party and all that that also change 

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:46.800
 that I saw him can not take a picture but 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:49.410
 it's going to be changed too and they're going 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:51.630
 to put also in squares start 

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:54.090
 party team direction options 

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:56.389
 leave all those things functions the 

00:05:54.090 --> 00:06:00.090
 command will be with large squares 

00:05:56.389 --> 00:06:02.280
 four squares so together that too 

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:04.050
 I saw it and well little more than say say 

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:06.060
 that in the game I had a lot of fun 

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:08.580
 playing with out consumer I will leave photos 

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:10.020

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:11.190

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:12.750
 Any questions you have because 

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:14.280

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:15.910
 you have some doubt I can not answer 

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:19.000
