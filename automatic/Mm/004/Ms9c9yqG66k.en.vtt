backs off stutter attention now we start
the<00:00:05.700> engine<00:00:05.819> we<00:00:06.359> switch<00:00:06.540> off<00:00:06.720> the<00:00:06.870> air

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
the engine we switch off the air

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:08.450 
the engine we switch off the air
conditioned<00:00:07.319> bags<00:00:07.529> to<00:00:07.710> have<00:00:07.830> enough<00:00:08.069> air<00:00:08.309> for

conditioned bags to have enough air for
-<00:00:08.639> starla<00:00:09.320> and<00:00:10.320> now<00:00:10.530> we<00:00:10.590> engage<00:00:11.309> the<00:00:11.550> engine

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
- starla and now we engage the engine

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.629 
- starla and now we engage the engine
starts<00:00:12.179> which<00:00:12.330> to<00:00:12.509> grant<00:00:13.070> this<00:00:14.070> moment<00:00:14.519> is

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
starts which to grant this moment is

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.970 
starts which to grant this moment is
that<00:00:14.820> we<00:00:15.000> have<00:00:15.089> opens<00:00:15.509> and<00:00:15.780> the<00:00:15.870> air<00:00:16.049> starts<00:00:16.770> to

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
that we have opens and the air starts to

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.439 
that we have opens and the air starts to
rotate<00:00:17.160> and<00:00:17.730> -<00:00:19.640> next<00:00:20.640> step<00:00:20.880> is<00:00:21.090> we're<00:00:21.300> gonna

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
rotate and - next step is we're gonna

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.840 
rotate and - next step is we're gonna
look<00:00:21.660> for<00:00:21.720> a<00:00:22.230> minimum<00:00:22.619> and<00:00:22.830> -<00:00:22.949> of<00:00:23.130> 25<00:00:23.640> percent

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
look for a minimum and - of 25 percent

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.450 
look for a minimum and - of 25 percent
today

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:28.460 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.569 

and<00:00:29.460> now<00:00:30.470> the<00:00:31.470> engine<00:00:31.770> start<00:00:32.040> which<00:00:32.220> is<00:00:32.250> in

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
and now the engine start which is in

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.180 
and now the engine start which is in
idle

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.500 

engine<00:00:35.880> start<00:00:36.120> lever<00:00:36.329> and<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:37.170> fuel<00:00:37.440> opens<00:00:38.510> we

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
engine start lever and the fuel opens we

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.440 
engine start lever and the fuel opens we
have<00:00:39.690> a<00:00:39.720> ignition<00:00:40.320> and<00:00:40.560> engine<00:00:41.370> exhaust<00:00:41.790> gas

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
have a ignition and engine exhaust gas

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.590 
have a ignition and engine exhaust gas
temperature<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.550> we<00:00:44.550> have<00:00:44.670> a<00:00:44.700> positive<00:00:44.970> and<00:00:45.360> -

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
temperature and we have a positive and -

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.210 
temperature and we have a positive and -
a<00:00:45.629> positive<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.320> warm<00:00:48.500> so<00:00:49.500> next<00:00:49.770> step<00:00:49.920> is<00:00:50.100> to

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:50.220 
a positive and warm so next step is to

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.119 
a positive and warm so next step is to
pull<00:00:50.430> for<00:00:50.700> Texas<00:00:51.660> setup<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.500> first<00:00:52.739> thing<00:00:52.949> is

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
pull for Texas setup the first thing is

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.100 
pull for Texas setup the first thing is
we<00:00:53.280> gonna<00:00:53.460> bring<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.390> generators<00:00:54.930> online

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
we gonna bring the generators online

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.930 
we gonna bring the generators online
