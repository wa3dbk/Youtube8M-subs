BMX<00:00:28.270> which<00:00:28.540> has<00:00:28.690> been<00:00:28.810> around<00:00:28.990> since<00:00:29.170> 1985<00:00:29.890> so

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:30.190 
BMX which has been around since 1985 so

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:31.650 
BMX which has been around since 1985 so
we<00:00:30.310> got<00:00:30.490> to<00:00:30.610> tap<00:00:30.820> into<00:00:31.090> some<00:00:31.390> of<00:00:31.510> their

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:31.660 
we got to tap into some of their

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:33.869 
we got to tap into some of their
manufacturing<00:00:32.529> relationships<00:00:33.370> that<00:00:33.670> are

00:00:33.869 --> 00:00:33.879 
manufacturing relationships that are

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:35.520 
manufacturing relationships that are
pretty<00:00:34.300> amazing<00:00:34.570> and<00:00:34.960> one<00:00:35.260> of<00:00:35.350> the<00:00:35.410> key

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:35.530 
pretty amazing and one of the key

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.110 
pretty amazing and one of the key
features<00:00:35.859> of<00:00:35.890> this<00:00:35.980> bike<00:00:36.219> is<00:00:36.429> its<00:00:36.640> tube<00:00:36.850> set

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:37.120 
features of this bike is its tube set

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.060 
features of this bike is its tube set
which<00:00:37.329> is<00:00:37.480> our<00:00:37.690> own<00:00:37.870> drawn<00:00:38.260> right<00:00:38.499> tube<00:00:38.800> set

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:39.070 
which is our own drawn right tube set

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:40.739 
which is our own drawn right tube set
with<00:00:39.280> the<00:00:39.370> drawn<00:00:39.609> right<00:00:39.850> tube<00:00:40.059> set<00:00:40.300> we<00:00:40.449> got<00:00:40.570> the

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:40.749 
with the drawn right tube set we got the

00:00:40.749 --> 00:00:42.869 
with the drawn right tube set we got the
custom<00:00:41.170> form<00:00:41.499> and<00:00:41.739> precisely<00:00:42.129> bought<00:00:42.579> each

00:00:42.869 --> 00:00:42.879 
custom form and precisely bought each

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:45.149 
custom form and precisely bought each
tube<00:00:43.210> of<00:00:43.390> the<00:00:43.510> bike<00:00:43.719> what<00:00:44.050> that<00:00:44.170> means<00:00:44.379> is<00:00:44.530> the

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:45.159 
tube of the bike what that means is the

00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:46.680 
tube of the bike what that means is the
tubing<00:00:45.460> can<00:00:45.519> be<00:00:45.579> thicker<00:00:45.909> where<00:00:46.210> the<00:00:46.329> welds

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:46.690 
tubing can be thicker where the welds

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:47.970 
tubing can be thicker where the welds
are<00:00:46.870> then<00:00:47.109> it<00:00:47.230> can<00:00:47.319> get<00:00:47.440> thinner<00:00:47.739> in<00:00:47.890> the

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:47.980 
are then it can get thinner in the

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:49.709 
are then it can get thinner in the
middle<00:00:48.219> of<00:00:48.280> the<00:00:48.339> tube<00:00:48.579> and<00:00:48.850> thicker<00:00:49.089> again<00:00:49.480> and

00:00:49.709 --> 00:00:49.719 
middle of the tube and thicker again and

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:51.599 
middle of the tube and thicker again and
with<00:00:50.170> each<00:00:50.319> size<00:00:50.559> bike<00:00:50.859> the<00:00:51.069> tubes<00:00:51.309> are

00:00:51.599 --> 00:00:51.609 
with each size bike the tubes are

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:54.090 
with each size bike the tubes are
different<00:00:51.999> sizes<00:00:52.210> so<00:00:53.109> we<00:00:53.140> got<00:00:53.409> to<00:00:53.559> do<00:00:53.710> that<00:00:53.829> on

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.100 
different sizes so we got to do that on

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.700 
different sizes so we got to do that on
a<00:00:54.129> you<00:00:54.550> know<00:00:54.640> our<00:00:54.789> 54<00:00:55.629> is<00:00:55.899> a<00:00:55.929> different<00:00:56.319> biting

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:56.710 
a you know our 54 is a different biting

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.069 
a you know our 54 is a different biting
position<00:00:57.249> than<00:00:57.429> our<00:00:57.519> 56<00:00:58.210> the<00:00:58.749> drawn<00:00:58.960> right

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:03.930 
tubing after we form it and but it we
heat<00:01:02.620> treat<00:01:02.920> it<00:01:03.069> and<00:01:03.249> then<00:01:03.519> it's<00:01:03.729> all
