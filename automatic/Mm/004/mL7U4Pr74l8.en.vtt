00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
going to split this up quickly into two

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.350 
going to split this up quickly into two
different<00:00:34.050> categories<00:00:35.010> here<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:35.730> serve<00:00:35.940> and

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
different categories here the serve and

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.020 
different categories here the serve and
your<00:00:36.809> volleys<00:00:37.230> serve<00:00:38.100> two<00:00:38.430> quick<00:00:38.640> things<00:00:38.790> on

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
your volleys serve two quick things on

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.530 
your volleys serve two quick things on
that<00:00:39.320> first<00:00:40.320> of<00:00:40.469> all<00:00:40.620> first<00:00:41.550> serve<00:00:41.760> percentage

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
that first of all first serve percentage

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.440 
that first of all first serve percentage
is<00:00:43.010> crucial<00:00:44.010> serving<00:00:44.730> and<00:00:44.879> volleying<00:00:44.969> on<00:00:45.300> your

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
is crucial serving and volleying on your

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.420 
is crucial serving and volleying on your
second<00:00:45.870> serve<00:00:46.050> is<00:00:46.379> just<00:00:46.950> going<00:00:47.070> to<00:00:47.129> make<00:00:47.280> your

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
second serve is just going to make your

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.180 
second serve is just going to make your
job<00:00:47.460> much<00:00:48.120> much<00:00:48.480> more<00:00:48.750> difficult<00:00:49.190> especially

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
job much much more difficult especially

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.220 
job much much more difficult especially
if<00:00:50.579> you<00:00:50.670> don't<00:00:50.820> have<00:00:50.940> a<00:00:50.969> ton<00:00:51.300> of<00:00:51.329> confidence<00:00:51.989> in

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
if you don't have a ton of confidence in

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.590 
if you don't have a ton of confidence in
your<00:00:52.379> second<00:00:52.800> serve<00:00:52.980> and<00:00:53.280> your<00:00:53.850> opponent<00:00:54.510> has

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
your second serve and your opponent has

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.110 
your second serve and your opponent has
a<00:00:54.629> decent<00:00:54.960> return<00:00:55.500> so<00:00:56.039> I<00:00:56.070> recommend<00:00:56.969> that<00:00:57.030> you

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
a decent return so I recommend that you

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.900 
a decent return so I recommend that you
really<00:00:57.510> work<00:00:57.690> hard<00:00:57.719> on<00:00:58.469> a<00:00:58.530> heavy<00:00:58.800> spin<00:00:59.340> serve

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
really work hard on a heavy spin serve

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.360 
really work hard on a heavy spin serve
to<00:01:00.270> use<00:01:00.629> for<00:01:01.440> both<00:01:01.590> your<00:01:01.800> first<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.309> your

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
to use for both your first and your

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.280 
to use for both your first and your
second<00:01:02.850> serves<00:01:03.059> when<00:01:03.719> you're<00:01:03.840> serving<00:01:04.199> in

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
second serves when you're serving in

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.170 
second serves when you're serving in
volume<00:01:04.589> you<00:01:05.010> know<00:01:05.100> it's<00:01:05.250> not<00:01:05.369> that<00:01:05.430> a<00:01:05.670> flat

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
volume you know it's not that a flat

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.800 
volume you know it's not that a flat
bomb<00:01:06.560> can't<00:01:07.560> be<00:01:07.710> effective<00:01:08.360> but<00:01:09.360> your

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
bomb can't be effective but your

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.810 
bomb can't be effective but your
percentages<00:01:10.590> are<00:01:10.770> going<00:01:10.890> to<00:01:10.950> go<00:01:11.070> way<00:01:11.340> down<00:01:11.640> on

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
percentages are going to go way down on

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.280 
percentages are going to go way down on
that<00:01:11.850> first<00:01:12.240> serve<00:01:12.479> which<00:01:12.720> means<00:01:12.930> you<00:01:13.049> have<00:01:13.170> to

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
that first serve which means you have to

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.140 
that first serve which means you have to
rely<00:01:13.560> on<00:01:13.590> your<00:01:13.799> second<00:01:14.310> number<00:01:14.700> one<00:01:14.880> and

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
rely on your second number one and

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.899 
rely on your second number one and
number<00:01:15.540> two<00:01:15.689> if<00:01:16.080> your<00:01:16.650> opponent<00:01:17.100> does<00:01:17.310> get<00:01:17.700> a

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
number two if your opponent does get a

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.630 
number two if your opponent does get a
read<00:01:18.570> on<00:01:18.840> that<00:01:18.869> flat<00:01:19.320> serve<00:01:19.619> then<00:01:20.369> you're<00:01:20.549> not

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
read on that flat serve then you're not

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:21.950 
read on that flat serve then you're not
going<00:01:20.790> to<00:01:20.880> be<00:01:20.970> able<00:01:21.119> to<00:01:21.360> make<00:01:21.509> your<00:01:21.659> way<00:01:21.720> in

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
going to be able to make your way in

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.170 
going to be able to make your way in
nearly<00:01:22.439> is<00:01:22.680> close<00:01:23.189> to<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.580> net<00:01:23.729> before<00:01:23.939> you

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
nearly is close to the net before you

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.030 
nearly is close to the net before you
get<00:01:24.330> your<00:01:24.450> first<00:01:24.630> volley<00:01:24.960> which<00:01:25.560> makes<00:01:25.799> things

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
get your first volley which makes things

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.530 
get your first volley which makes things
more<00:01:26.250> tricky<00:01:26.729> as<00:01:26.820> well<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:27.330> in<00:01:28.320> terms<00:01:28.619> of

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
more tricky as well and in terms of

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.760 
more tricky as well and in terms of
placements<00:01:30.540> or<00:01:30.659> trying<00:01:31.020> to<00:01:31.049> aim<00:01:31.259> your<00:01:31.500> serve

placements or trying to aim your serve
and<00:01:32.100> you<00:01:32.670> should<00:01:32.880> be<00:01:33.000> working<00:01:33.360> hard<00:01:33.780> if<00:01:33.869> you're

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020

anytime<00:02:26.730> you're<00:02:26.880> at<00:02:27.000> the<00:02:27.120> net<00:02:27.240> you<00:02:27.420> should<00:02:27.570> be

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
anytime you're at the net you should be

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.530 
anytime you're at the net you should be
following<00:02:28.260> the<00:02:28.740> ball<00:02:28.950> the<00:02:29.460> side<00:02:29.730> of<00:02:29.970> the<00:02:30.300> court

following the ball the side of the court

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.390 
following the ball the side of the court
that<00:02:30.660> the<00:02:30.750> ball<00:02:30.930> is<00:02:30.960> on<00:02:31.200> is<00:02:31.440> the<00:02:31.890> side<00:02:32.130> of<00:02:32.280> the

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
that the ball is on is the side of the

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.580 
that the ball is on is the side of the
center<00:02:32.760> that<00:02:32.790> you<00:02:33.090> should<00:02:33.420> be<00:02:33.540> on<00:02:33.690> so<00:02:34.380> when<00:02:34.530> you

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
center that you should be on so when you

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.200 
center that you should be on so when you
go<00:02:34.710> way<00:02:34.890> out<00:02:34.920> wide<00:02:35.250> it<00:02:35.580> means<00:02:35.820> that<00:02:35.970> you<00:02:36.060> have

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.210 
go way out wide it means that you have

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:38.690 
go way out wide it means that you have
much<00:02:36.540> greater<00:02:36.780> distance<00:02:37.350> to<00:02:37.410> travel<00:02:37.980> to<00:02:38.520> get

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
much greater distance to travel to get

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.270 
much greater distance to travel to get
to<00:02:38.910> the<00:02:39.060> right<00:02:39.240> spot<00:02:39.720> so<00:02:40.650> for<00:02:40.920> those<00:02:41.040> two

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
to the right spot so for those two

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.180 
to the right spot so for those two
reasons<00:02:42.110> really<00:02:43.110> you<00:02:43.230> should<00:02:43.440> be<00:02:43.530> hitting<00:02:43.950> at

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
reasons really you should be hitting at

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.180 
reasons really you should be hitting at
either<00:02:44.370> the<00:02:44.520> body<00:02:44.820> or<00:02:45.180> the<00:02:45.540> tee<00:02:45.870> most<00:02:46.590> often

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
either the body or the tee most often

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.800 
either the body or the tee most often
doesn't<00:02:47.640> mean<00:02:47.880> that<00:02:48.000> out<00:02:48.150> wide<00:02:48.330> can't<00:02:48.690> be

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
doesn't mean that out wide can't be

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:49.880 
doesn't mean that out wide can't be
effective<00:02:49.230> it<00:02:49.380> can<00:02:49.590> be

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
effective it can be

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.610 
effective it can be
but<00:02:50.730> these<00:02:51.540> two<00:02:51.810> serves<00:02:52.080> should<00:02:52.410> be<00:02:52.500> your

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
but these two serves should be your

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:53.750 
but these two serves should be your
bread<00:02:52.800> and<00:02:53.010> butter<00:02:53.190> for<00:02:53.430> serve-and-volley

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
bread and butter for serve-and-volley

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.120 
bread and butter for serve-and-volley
okay<00:02:54.660> so<00:02:54.750> that's<00:02:54.960> the<00:02:55.080> serve<00:02:55.290> number<00:02:55.890> two

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
okay so that's the serve number two

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.490 
okay so that's the serve number two
volleys<00:02:56.660> I'm<00:02:57.660> going<00:02:57.810> to<00:02:57.870> give<00:02:57.990> you<00:02:58.050> a<00:02:58.140> really

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
volleys I'm going to give you a really

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.630 
volleys I'm going to give you a really
simple<00:03:00.350> guideline<00:03:01.350> to<00:03:01.380> follow<00:03:01.530> here<00:03:02.160> Rasheed

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
simple guideline to follow here Rasheed

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.180 
simple guideline to follow here Rasheed
anytime<00:03:03.600> you<00:03:03.720> have<00:03:03.840> a<00:03:03.900> neutral<00:03:04.230> volley<00:03:04.800> or<00:03:05.070> a

anytime you have a neutral volley or a

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.290 
anytime you have a neutral volley or a
defensive<00:03:05.970> volley<00:03:06.180> and<00:03:06.780> that<00:03:07.590> means<00:03:08.300> maybe

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
defensive volley and that means maybe

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:10.970 
defensive volley and that means maybe
you're<00:03:09.510> making<00:03:09.600> contact<00:03:10.230> below<00:03:10.440> the<00:03:10.830> height

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
dipped it down at your feet so you're

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.980

singles<00:03:26.730> you<00:03:26.850> want<00:03:27.030> to<00:03:27.090> keep<00:03:27.300> the<00:03:27.480> ball<00:03:27.630> in

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
singles you want to keep the ball in

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.570 
singles you want to keep the ball in
front<00:03:28.230> of<00:03:28.410> you<00:03:28.790> so<00:03:29.790> let's<00:03:29.940> say<00:03:30.120> that's<00:03:30.360> a<00:03:31.580> maybe

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 
front of you so let's say that's a maybe

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:35.180 
front of you so let's say that's a maybe
the<00:03:32.910> ball<00:03:33.150> is<00:03:33.840> low<00:03:34.200> here<00:03:34.590> you<00:03:34.740> got<00:03:34.890> stretched

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
the ball is low here you got stretched

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.970 
the ball is low here you got stretched
out<00:03:35.400> wide<00:03:35.610> rather<00:03:36.540> than<00:03:36.840> go<00:03:36.990> across<00:03:37.290> Koretz

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.190 
out wide rather than go across Koretz
which<00:03:38.430> means<00:03:38.670> you<00:03:38.880> have<00:03:39.030> a<00:03:39.060> lot<00:03:39.450> of<00:03:39.750> distance

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
which means you have a lot of distance

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.130 
which means you have a lot of distance
