00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
strain it during that process once

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:10.880 
strain it during that process once
that's<00:01:09.810> done<00:01:09.960> it's<00:01:10.200> off<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.649> refrigerator

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
that's done it's off to the refrigerator

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.609 
that's done it's off to the refrigerator
to<00:01:11.399> cool<00:01:11.580> down<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:12.149> a<00:01:12.180> chilly<00:01:12.659> 40<00:01:13.229> degrees

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
to cool down to a chilly 40 degrees

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.100 
to cool down to a chilly 40 degrees
Fahrenheit<00:01:13.860> or<00:01:14.310> so<00:01:14.580> now<00:01:15.450> just<00:01:15.659> keep<00:01:15.750> in<00:01:15.930> mind

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
Fahrenheit or so now just keep in mind

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.600 
Fahrenheit or so now just keep in mind
the<00:01:16.229> cooler<00:01:16.560> your<00:01:16.740> ice<00:01:16.860> cream<00:01:17.130> base<00:01:17.159> the

the cooler your ice cream base the

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.590 
the cooler your ice cream base the
faster<00:01:18.090> it<00:01:18.240> will<00:01:18.330> whip<00:01:18.509> up<00:01:18.690> into<00:01:18.930> ice<00:01:19.049> cream

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
faster it will whip up into ice cream

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.570 
faster it will whip up into ice cream
all<00:01:21.439> right<00:01:21.619> so<00:01:21.770> while<00:01:21.920> that's<00:01:22.070> cooling<00:01:22.340> down

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
all right so while that's cooling down

like I have here pour some batter onto

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.289 
like I have here pour some batter onto
parchment<00:01:45.440> paper<00:01:45.560> or<00:01:45.680> a<00:01:45.830> Silpat<00:01:46.310> smooth<00:01:47.180> it

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:47.299 
parchment paper or a Silpat smooth it

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:49.570 
parchment paper or a Silpat smooth it
out<00:01:47.390> into<00:01:47.570> a<00:01:47.780> large<00:01:48.259> round<00:01:48.590> disc<00:01:48.950> just<00:01:49.369> think

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:49.580 
out into a large round disc just think

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:50.950 
out into a large round disc just think
of<00:01:49.729> a<00:01:49.820> waffle<00:01:50.030> cone<00:01:50.270> while<00:01:50.509> you're<00:01:50.630> doing<00:01:50.840> this

of a waffle cone while you're doing this

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.210 
of a waffle cone while you're doing this
so<00:01:51.140> you<00:01:51.170> have<00:01:51.259> some<00:01:51.590> sort<00:01:51.830> of<00:01:51.890> point<00:01:52.159> of

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
so you have some sort of point of

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.510 
so you have some sort of point of
reference<00:01:52.690> with<00:01:53.690> size<00:01:53.990> and<00:01:54.380> shape<00:01:54.679> once

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
reference with size and shape once

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.100
