00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:07.920
 or live as individuals we go to 

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.880
 teach a technique to get that 

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:11.639
 the horse is still 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.740
 this technique is called at least I the 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.930
 I call making the yen according to it's about 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.699
 of the horse extending its hands 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:20.940
 forward and take a stand 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:23.160
 open is how we always get it 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:24.480
 on his left side of agreement that is 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.450
 where we always have to prepare 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:33.050
 the horse in pricking put the saddle 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:34.700
 etcetera we put ourselves right next to him 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.469
 and this will have to be done with a lot 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.600
 patience for this horse I already have it 

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:40.640
 trained to do this because it 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.949
 try with the help of the hand and a 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:46.000
 little foot we throw it towards us 

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:48.610
 so that a little hand forward 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.590
 then we push towards there 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:52.300
 we will see how 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.970
 with the help of the foot it lengthens a bit the 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.860
 left hand and we are repeating 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:01:02.120
 If we do this, we can help you with a 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:04.820
 noise like this we see that on horseback 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:07.460
 to make this noise makes little progress 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.350
 arms now once you have done this 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.610
 we would give him a prize in this case this 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.960
 hair is trained what we want 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.970
 is to stay still without us 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.320
 next time we are what we are going to 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.330
 to do is we put the rope around here 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.729
 back in case I got a bit ahead in 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.430
 the footstep and we made it stay still 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:23.020
 in agreement 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.570
 if the horse stays still in this 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.070
 posture we will give him a prize then he 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.200
 you will recognize that you have done well if you 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:32.430
 move we try again and so everything 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.430
 the time we separated it 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.760
 and we see how the horse has maintained the 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:44.490
 position then we give a little bit of 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:47.820
 the prize and this can be very useful 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:50.040
 before we get on the horse 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.050
 a little understands and it will be easier for us 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.760
 climb the horse will understand that with this 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.900
 posture have to be still and up 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.900
 that we do not give the order 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:03.130
 he does not have to move in good agreement 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.750
 I hope you have felt this video and 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:08.790
 that you continue watching our videos of a 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.790
 Thank you very much and see you next time
