00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:10.400
 in the following video tutorial 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:14.119
 we will learn the nature of 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:18.789
 important subject accounts to be able 

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:21.430
 understand the accounting records let's see 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:24.730
 an account 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:28.660
 is the format in which the 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:32.650
 increases or decreases in accounts 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:35.739
 of the assets of the liabilities of the 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:39.040
 heritage of income and 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:40.720
 expenses or other accounts used in 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.350
 the record of transactions 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:47.050
 economic 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:51.540
 what are the elements of an account 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.540
 we have the name of the account 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:59.780
 we have the debit records the column 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:02.990
 of the debits and the column of the 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:05.650
 credits and in the end 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:11.190
 we will have 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:13.980
 if it is a debit balance or if it is a credit balance 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:16.350
 it is to note that the debit records 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:19.260
 they are also known by the name of 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.630
 charge or debit and records credits 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:24.180
 they are also known by the name of 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.550
 subscription or see 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.400
 by its shape this scheme is known 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:31.830
 also like the accounts 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:34.640
 let's see an example suppose we have 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.640
 the bank account 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:42.400
 In the debit , the 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:46.960
 increases in credit are going to show 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:50.350
 the decreases and it is already determined if 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:53.910
 the balance is a debit balance or if it is a 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.910
 credit balance 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:01.820
 now let's look at the concept of what a 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:05.570
 vito's record 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:08.450
 a vito record is a record that 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.899
 is done on the left side of a 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.899
 account 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:18.140
 a credit record 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:21.879
 is a record that is made on the side 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.879
 right of an account 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:27.760
 and the balance 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:31.310
 is the arithmetic result of subtracting 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:34.250
 debits and credits depending on the type 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:37.700
 of account if it is an asset account of 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:39.860
 liability of income or income 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:43.730
 expenses 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:46.310
 let's see what effect the 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:50.180
 debit and credit records in the 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:52.330
 accounts of assets and liabilities 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.670
 heritage 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:57.190
 when we say we do 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:00.460
 vito track of an account 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:03.450
 active we are saying that we are 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:05.459
 increasing said account 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:09.300
 when we say that we are making 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:12.209
 a credit record on the right side of the 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:15.520
 active we are saying that we are 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:19.830
 decreasing said account 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:23.110
 therefore the asset accounts 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:27.220
 normally they should give us on the side 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:29.920
 left you get the balance 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:33.070
 taking into account the sum of the 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.720
 debits and subtract the sum of the 

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:37.690
 credits 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:42.300
 let's see the effect of the debit registers 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:42.300
 and credit in the liabilities accounts 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:48.760
 when we say we do a 

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:51.299
 credit record to a passive account 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:55.599
 we are saying that we are increasing 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:58.510
 that account and when we make a record 

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:59.799
 debit to a liability account 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:03.700
 We are saying that we are 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:07.959
 decreasing said account therefore 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:09.230
 the liabilities accounts normally we 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:14.920
 dan 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:14.920
 the right side is to say credit balance 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.350
 let's see now 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.889
 what is the effect of the records 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:24.310
 debits and credits in the accounts of 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:26.710
 heritage 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:30.660
 make a credit record to an account 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:33.730
 of the estate is to increase said account 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:36.730
 and make a debit register to the 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:41.919
 equity accounts is decreasing 

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:44.380
 said account therefore the balance in 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:49.270
 the equity accounts normally 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:52.070
 they give us to the right side we can also 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:53.990
 say that 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:59.410
 the nature of the accounts of 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:59.410
 patrimony are nature credit
