00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
days if that still doesn't happen he'll

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.080

match two dice if that still doesn't

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:37.949 
match two dice if that still doesn't
happen<00:02:35.739> then<00:02:36.459> the<00:02:36.670> sushi<00:02:37.269> chef<00:02:37.300> will<00:02:37.750> score

never<00:02:40.450> I'm<00:02:40.989> not<00:02:41.200> sure<00:02:41.379> that<00:02:41.410> it<00:02:41.680> I<00:02:41.860> think<00:02:42.550> the

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
never I'm not sure that it I think the

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.699 
never I'm not sure that it I think the
probability<00:02:43.090> for<00:02:43.120> that<00:02:43.360> happening<00:02:43.750> is<00:02:43.959> really

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
probability for that happening is really

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:47.490 
probability for that happening is really
quite<00:02:44.950> low<00:02:45.190> once<00:02:45.940> this<00:02:46.060> happened<00:02:46.450> the<00:02:46.599> turn

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
quite low once this happened the turn

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.619 
quite low once this happened the turn
goes<00:02:47.769> to<00:02:48.040> the<00:02:48.159> next<00:02:48.519> player<00:02:48.790> and<00:02:49.060> we<00:02:49.420> keep

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:24.750 
one to just cut playing stealing see

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:26.240 
one to just cut playing stealing see
like<00:05:24.870> ceiling<00:05:25.290> and<00:05:25.470> I<00:05:25.530> never<00:05:25.710> really<00:05:26.040> got<00:05:26.220> to

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:26.250 
like ceiling and I never really got to

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:29.630 
like ceiling and I never really got to

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:31.130 
get any cards yeah I mean I you have to
wonder<00:05:29.790> it<00:05:29.970> was<00:05:30.090> the<00:05:30.210> gameplay<00:05:30.630> test<00:05:30.900> with

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:31.140 
wonder it was the gameplay test with

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:32.630 
wonder it was the gameplay test with
that<00:05:31.290> because<00:05:31.470> if<00:05:31.830> someone<00:05:32.100> gets<00:05:32.250> two<00:05:32.520> or

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:32.640 
that because if someone gets two or

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:34.340 
that because if someone gets two or
three<00:05:32.820> steals<00:05:33.090> they've<00:05:33.480> won<00:05:33.960> the<00:05:33.990> game

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:34.350 
three steals they've won the game

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:35.630 
three steals they've won the game
essentially<00:05:34.980> because<00:05:35.280> they're<00:05:35.430> just<00:05:35.490> going

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:35.640 
essentially because they're just going

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:37.430 
essentially because they're just going
to<00:05:35.730> steal<00:05:35.880> from<00:05:35.910> other<00:05:36.210> people<00:05:36.540> and<00:05:36.750> then

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:37.440 
to steal from other people and then

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:39.590 
to steal from other people and then
after<00:05:38.190> that<00:05:38.220> if<00:05:38.610> they<00:05:38.820> just<00:05:39.030> win<00:05:39.210> a<00:05:39.240> couple

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:39.600 
after that if they just win a couple

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.600 
after that if they just win a couple
other<00:05:39.720> ones<00:05:39.810> they've<00:05:40.200> won<00:05:40.410> the<00:05:40.530> game<00:05:40.710> so<00:05:41.070> it's

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:41.610 
other ones they've won the game so it's

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:43.550 
other ones they've won the game so it's
