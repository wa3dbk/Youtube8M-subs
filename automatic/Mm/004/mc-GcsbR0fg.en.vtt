a couple years now and I just can't part
away<00:00:10.740> from<00:00:11.160> it<00:00:11.309> so<00:00:11.519> I<00:00:11.550> just<00:00:12.240> decided<00:00:12.420> to<00:00:12.840> like

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
away from it so I just decided to like

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.589 
away from it so I just decided to like
revamp<00:00:13.920> it<00:00:14.130> and<00:00:14.309> I<00:00:14.460> added<00:00:14.670> some<00:00:14.849> triangles

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
revamp it and I added some triangles

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.200 
revamp it and I added some triangles
right<00:00:16.080> here<00:00:16.379> with<00:00:16.560> paint<00:00:16.890> and<00:00:17.070> it<00:00:17.670> really<00:00:17.910> like

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
right here with paint and it really like

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.359 
right here with paint and it really like
I<00:00:18.480> guess<00:00:19.170> like<00:00:19.199> it<00:00:19.529> makes<00:00:20.010> it<00:00:20.189> like<00:00:20.340> a

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
I guess like it makes it like a

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.640 
I guess like it makes it like a
different<00:00:20.850> shirt<00:00:21.119> in<00:00:21.390> a<00:00:21.420> way<00:00:21.630> so<00:00:22.410> yeah<00:00:22.619> I

your desired choice some stencils and

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.770 
your desired choice some stencils and
these<00:00:55.050> are<00:00:55.379> from<00:00:55.680> michaels<00:00:56.160> and<00:00:56.399> it<00:00:57.300> comes<00:00:57.510> in

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
these are from michaels and it comes in

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.369 
these are from michaels and it comes in
a<00:00:57.930> 3-pack<00:00:58.850> where<00:00:59.850> where<00:01:00.690> it's<00:01:00.840> this<00:01:01.109> one

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
a 3-pack where where it's this one

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.149 
a 3-pack where where it's this one
circles<00:01:02.190> and<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:03.059> alphabet<00:01:03.739> for<00:01:04.739> I<00:01:04.799> think

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
circles and the alphabet for I think

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:11.810 
circles and the alphabet for I think
like<00:01:05.309> 329<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.619> a<00:01:08.360> stencil<00:01:09.360> brush<00:01:09.659> or<00:01:10.049> as<00:01:10.820> long

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
like 329 and a stencil brush or as long

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.910 
like 329 and a stencil brush or as long
as<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.180> brush<00:01:12.450> is<00:01:12.720> dense<00:01:13.140> like<00:01:13.470> this<00:01:13.710> one

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
as the brush is dense like this one

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.100 
as the brush is dense like this one
right<00:01:14.070> here<00:01:14.130> because<00:01:14.970> you're<00:01:15.840> going<00:01:15.990> to<00:01:16.049> be

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
right here because you're going to be

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.020 
right here because you're going to be
doing<00:01:16.439> this<00:01:16.710> motion<00:01:17.250> you're<00:01:17.430> not<00:01:17.640> going<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:17.880> be

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
doing this motion you're not going to be

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.190 
doing this motion you're not going to be
doing<00:01:18.210> this<00:01:18.600> so<00:01:19.439> it<00:01:19.530> needs<00:01:19.710> to<00:01:19.890> be<00:01:20.040> super<00:01:20.520> dense

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
doing this so it needs to be super dense

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.310 
doing this so it needs to be super dense
and<00:01:22.430> place<00:01:23.430> your<00:01:23.790> t-shirt<00:01:24.360> on<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.900> cookie

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
sheet so it doesn't transfer on the back

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.450 
sheet so it doesn't transfer on the back
and<00:01:30.710> then<00:01:31.710> you're<00:01:31.860> going<00:01:31.979> to<00:01:32.040> grab<00:01:32.280> your

going to be grabbing your stencil tight

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.790 
going to be grabbing your stencil tight
and<00:02:19.450> you're<00:02:20.450> going<00:02:20.570> to<00:02:20.630> be<00:02:20.780> doing<00:02:20.959> this<00:02:21.110> motion

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
and you're going to be doing this motion

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:30.680 
and you're going to be doing this motion
you're<00:02:21.950> not<00:02:22.190> going<00:02:22.400> to<00:02:22.459> be<00:02:22.550> painting<00:02:23.269> it<00:02:23.630> on

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.680 

and<00:02:31.770> this<00:02:32.770> is<00:02:32.890> how<00:02:33.010> it<00:02:33.160> came<00:02:33.340> out<00:02:33.580> and<00:02:33.880> I<00:02:34.510> think

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
and this is how it came out and I think

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.170 
and this is how it came out and I think
you<00:02:34.780> came<00:02:34.930> up<00:02:35.080> pretty<00:02:35.230> good<00:02:35.500> and<00:02:35.760> after<00:02:36.760> make

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
you came up pretty good and after make

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.260 
you came up pretty good and after make
sure<00:02:37.209> to<00:02:37.450> remove<00:02:37.900> all<00:02:38.080> the<00:02:38.440> paint<00:02:39.000> that<00:02:40.000> was

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270
