00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:06.970
 hi guys, how are you? 

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:08.950
 welcome to point 5 x 1 talks to you 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:10.960
 fernando del moral la roba fernando 5 x 

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:12.910
 1 on twitter and I bring you a video on the 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:15.070
 that I'm going to show you maybe what is not 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:17.410
 is showing everyone what is the 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:18.910
 hidden perhaps hidden functions 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.939
 that they did not teach us in a first 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:23.560
 moment in the keynote of 8 years all the 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:25.089
 world is teaching what it has there are 28 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.009
 that we'll show that too but 

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:28.480
 we wanted to show you a little more 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:30.039
 forward since now it is showing 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.340
 everyone but this is different 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:34.420
 let's go for example to safari 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.460
 Safari is an application that has been 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.470
 updated quite among other things 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:41.080
 now allow us on our iphone or in 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:42.880
 our ipad display web pages in 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.680
 mobile format pass them to the format of 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.180
 desk for example to by 5 for 1 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.830
 point s is a page that when it detects 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.350
 that you get from a mobile phone activates a 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:51.550
 good mobile version if right now you 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.620
 you want to see a written version of 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.260
 this website you simply do a tap on the 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.720
 direction bar you slide down 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.430
 and that web site that would transform that one 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.230
 desktop version simply 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:03.640
 doing what I have told you is very easy 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.490
 true 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.530
 from safari let's continue down on 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:11.260
 Share button agree now 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:13.540
 you going to be able to change what 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.340
 are the social buttons so far 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.560
 you had a list of social buttons that 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.300
 He was immovable, now doing a 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.130
 tap for example also in this part 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.780
 you can order it to your liking in 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.940
 how you want to order it function either 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.830
 for aesthetics productivity also if you give 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.450
 to the plus button you also have here the 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:31.390
 different options to order it 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:34.180
 to your liking the button above is maybe 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:36.130
 more customizable you can modify your 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.660
 icons from here you can also do 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.539
 the order that you want simply 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:43.149
 moving from this part upwards or 

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:44.590
 down and you can even activate and 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:47.380
 deactivate the different buttons 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.840
 you give ok and they will appear there 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:52.869
 you see simply this you order you to your 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:55.990
 taste and ready and this also through 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:58.119
 safari and finally the safari when 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.800
 we close an agreement tab 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:01.539
 if we do not want to go to the file because 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.920
 it's more cumbersome and we want to open a 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:04.360
 new page imagine that I here 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.380
 I had many pages open but 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.960
 I want to open one that I have opened 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.140
 recently and that of closed then and 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.090
 we give the most 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.920
 we automatically get the ones that are 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.900
 have recently closed I would get 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.370
 and would access directly to it something that 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.410
 It is much more agile and faster than 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.620
 example search in the history is very 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.330
 well that's good now we go to the adjustments 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.580
 because one of the things that I have noticed 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.890
 in years 8 is that now the messages 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.690
 has a new configuration mode in 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.060
 the bottom part that is save 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.440
 messages now you can choose how much 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.360
 time you want your messages to be 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.430
 save inside the application you can 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.530
 keep them forever in a period of 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.120
 30 days or in a period of one year is 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.319
 also at least have that data and you can 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.299
 select what you want 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:48.359
 one of the things that has also improved 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:48.900
 much is looking for my iphone the theme of 

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:51.239
 security 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.889
 Apple does a lot of work and in May 7 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:54.599
 It was practically insurmountable 

00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:56.430
 now it will be a little further 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:58.170
 less will facilitate the fact of looking 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.510
 a device that has been turned off 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.159
 recently we are going to give you here 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.450
 search my iphone and you can activate a 

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:06.659
 new box they have called 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.340
 good last location what is going 

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:10.650
 to do this is by checking this box 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.000
 send the previous location to the 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.889
 device has been turned off by 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.629
 battery problems etc. something that 

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:17.069
 It is very good because when a 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:19.079
 device runs out of battery or it 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:20.969
 shutdown can not be found on the map 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:23.099
 by satellite with the option of funk my 

00:03:20.969 --> 00:03:25.319
 iphone so this option is very good 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:26.939
 we are not going to go of adjustments we are going to 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:28.409
 go now to the accessibility menu 

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:30.840
 because people who require 

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:33.150
 these of these characteristics then 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.590
 they have novelties in vision have added 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.199
 a new feature called 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:39.510
 gray is that what will allow us in 

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:41.969
 Any case is activating the grant to 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.739
 our operating system a with 

00:03:41.969 --> 00:03:45.510
 one a black and white tonality is 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:47.680
 say eliminate the colors and change them 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.719
 by whites and blacks 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.430
 so this I do not know if this will make 

00:03:49.719 --> 00:03:54.129
 increase a little bit the performance of 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.750
 battery or not but of course it is useful already 

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:56.829
 that we talk about drums we're going to go to 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.540
 use because one of the thanks that 

00:03:56.829 --> 00:04:00.400
 we can also appreciate in this is that 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.989
 now the subject of the battery is indicated and 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.530
 not only in time in use and waiting 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:06.549
 but in the applications and how much and 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:09.459
 how much battery these have spent 

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:11.859
 applications in a 24- hour period or 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:13.810
 of 7 days something that is very well then 

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:14.920
 to control and that after the 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.419
 time can I mean I'm going to eliminate 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.519
 this application that is what causes me 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:20.829
 the battery problems that's a 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:23.919
 puntazo and that already took a lot of paper in 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:26.470
 show it and maybe to go finishing 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:28.210
 guys I want to show you maybe a 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:29.440
 animation that is nothing productive I 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.940
 I would have preferred that in the center of 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.229
 control would have improved the 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.539
 tunnels that could have left 

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:36.130
 customize them but you can not look 

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:38.110
 this part of agreement this dark part 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:39.190
 which is shaded when you open the 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.620
 control center 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:43.660
 now if you tap on that center 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.310
 control in the brightness area there is like 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.750
 that lights the bulb you see 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:48.699
 they also light up like the lamps 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:50.610
 those of the brightness and it turns on what's 

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:53.140
 inside 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:54.850
 it's a chorra animation but it's a good 

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:57.640
 detail that I wanted to show you because 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:05:00.340
 it has also been logically modified and 

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:01.660
 put new in them 8 good guys and 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:03.430
 these are some of the functions 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.750
 hidden that there are in years other 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:06.850
 surely there are more and I have spent 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:08.290
 unnoticed and I repeat functions 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:10.150
 hidden because what they refer to 

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:11.470
 official characteristics very prontito 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:12.760
 you are going to watch a video who scored five 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:14.770
 for one that I'm going to do with her 

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:16.480
 agreement what happens is that as Martian 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:17.800
 and senna court and the friendly channels and 

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:19.330
 they have been showing the ones I did not want 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.160
 doing them so closely do not stop either 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.660
 bored always with the same videos 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.040
 so nothing guys I hope that I have 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:25.270
 liked the video you know you can give me a 

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:26.830
 like that you liked you can subscribe 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:27.960
 if you are not there to see more videos of 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:29.830
 years to be will come within a time 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:31.150
 I will talk about what happened to my 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:32.410
 jailbreak do not worry do not leave it 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:34.450
 in the comments that do not have a 

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:35.980
 next video this has been all we 

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:37.780
 we see inside a little while with the 5 x 1 

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:40.110
 Answer, I am fernando and we promise 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:40.110
 return
