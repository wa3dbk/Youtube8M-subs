this I need to find my receipt I am so

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.020 
this I need to find my receipt I am so
getting<00:01:43.680> a

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.470 

the<00:01:48.600> formula<00:01:49.110> itself<00:01:49.470> is<00:01:49.740> amazing<00:01:50.310> like<00:01:50.940> the

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:51.480 
the formula itself is amazing like the

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.040 
the formula itself is amazing like the
stain<00:01:51.870> it<00:01:52.470> lasts<00:01:53.280> for<00:01:53.580> hours<00:01:53.780> so<00:01:54.780> what<00:01:55.020> I

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:55.050 
stain it lasts for hours so what I

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.280 
stain it lasts for hours so what I
recommend<00:01:55.680> is<00:01:55.890> not<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.640> keep<00:01:57.090> reapplying<00:01:57.930> this

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
recommend is not to keep reapplying this

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.410 
recommend is not to keep reapplying this
over<00:01:58.650> and<00:01:58.830> over<00:01:58.920> maybe<00:01:59.400> do<00:01:59.700> that<00:01:59.880> like<00:02:00.090> twice

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
over and over maybe do that like twice

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.680 
over and over maybe do that like twice
two<00:02:00.840> times<00:02:00.870> max<00:02:01.700> because<00:02:02.700> it<00:02:02.910> will<00:02:03.180> build<00:02:03.420> up

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:03.690 
two times max because it will build up

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.320 
two times max because it will build up
and<00:02:03.930> it<00:02:04.470> will<00:02:04.680> have<00:02:04.979> become<00:02:05.400> a<00:02:05.430> full-on<00:02:05.790> red

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330 
and it will have become a full-on red

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.330 
and it will have become a full-on red
lip<00:02:06.780> by<00:02:07.050> the<00:02:07.110> time<00:02:07.350> you've<00:02:07.500> reapplied<00:02:08.070> it<00:02:08.190> like

life but this I heard is really good I
have<00:05:17.340> a<00:05:17.460> feeling<00:05:17.850> that<00:05:17.970> it's<00:05:18.120> a<00:05:18.240> little<00:05:18.570> bit

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:18.690 
have a feeling that it's a little bit

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:22.940 
have a feeling that it's a little bit
drier<00:05:18.960> than<00:05:19.410> this<00:05:19.740> hand<00:05:20.150> but<00:05:21.620> when<00:05:22.620> I<00:05:22.650> tasted

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:22.950 
drier than this hand but when I tasted

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:25.220 
drier than this hand but when I tasted
it<00:05:23.220> I<00:05:23.370> wasn't<00:05:23.580> bad<00:05:23.910> at<00:05:24.030> all<00:05:24.120> actually<00:05:24.390> it<00:05:24.930> I

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:25.230 
it I wasn't bad at all actually it I

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:28.970 
it I wasn't bad at all actually it I
think<00:05:25.860> if<00:05:26.240> you<00:05:27.240> have<00:05:27.540> dry<00:05:28.080> skin<00:05:28.110> it'll<00:05:28.890> be

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:28.980 
think if you have dry skin it'll be

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:30.560 
think if you have dry skin it'll be
great<00:05:29.190> for<00:05:29.370> summer<00:05:29.670> if<00:05:29.940> you<00:05:29.970> have<00:05:30.210> oily<00:05:30.540> skin

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:30.570 
great for summer if you have oily skin

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:33.020 
great for summer if you have oily skin
it'll<00:05:31.050> be<00:05:31.170> much<00:05:31.350> better<00:05:31.380> than<00:05:31.740> the<00:05:32.010> same<00:05:32.280> and<00:05:32.880> I

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:33.030 
it'll be much better than the same and I

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:35.300 
it'll be much better than the same and I
think<00:05:33.060> this<00:05:33.660> has<00:05:33.990> higher<00:05:34.320> coverage<00:05:34.920> than<00:05:35.280> the

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:35.310 
think this has higher coverage than the

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:37.250 
think this has higher coverage than the
same<00:05:35.820> professional<00:05:36.540> concealer<00:05:36.930> because

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:37.260 
same professional concealer because

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.310 
same professional concealer because
obviously<00:05:37.800> this<00:05:38.220> is<00:05:38.460> a<00:05:38.550> thicker<00:05:38.970> consistency

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:39.320 
obviously this is a thicker consistency

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:43.820 
obviously this is a thicker consistency
and<00:05:40.320> that<00:05:40.800> is<00:05:41.130> it<00:05:41.430> for<00:05:41.940> my<00:05:42.270> heart<00:05:42.960> can<00:05:43.530> I<00:05:43.590> just
