00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:21.770 
toggles appear per row so let's go ahead

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:23.530 
toggles appear per row so let's go ahead
and<00:03:22.070> change<00:03:22.430> it<00:03:22.640> right<00:03:22.670> now<00:03:22.880> it's<00:03:23.060> at<00:03:23.150> seven

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
and change it right now it's at seven

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.510 
and change it right now it's at seven
which<00:03:23.780> is<00:03:23.959> the<00:03:24.080> maximum<00:03:24.650> if<00:03:24.830> I<00:03:25.220> go<00:03:25.340> ahead<00:03:25.400> and

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:25.520 
which is the maximum if I go ahead and

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:28.180 
which is the maximum if I go ahead and
change<00:03:25.730> it<00:03:25.910> to<00:03:25.940> let's<00:03:26.420> say<00:03:26.630> five<00:03:27.290> when<00:03:28.070> we

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
change it to let's say five when we

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:31.060 
change it to let's say five when we
launched<00:03:28.459> oxxo<00:03:29.150> here<00:03:29.510> you<00:03:29.870> can<00:03:30.050> see<00:03:30.260> that<00:03:30.500> we

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:31.070 
launched oxxo here you can see that we

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:34.000 
launched oxxo here you can see that we
only<00:03:31.250> have<00:03:31.520> five<00:03:31.940> toggles<00:03:32.420> per<00:03:32.720> row<00:03:33.050> and<00:03:33.380> it

only have five toggles per row and it

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:35.710 
only have five toggles per row and it
kind<00:03:34.310> of<00:03:34.340> spaces<00:03:34.760> them<00:03:34.910> out<00:03:35.030> evenly<00:03:35.180> so<00:03:35.660> it

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720 
kind of spaces them out evenly so it

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.120 
kind of spaces them out evenly so it
doesn't<00:03:35.930> look<00:03:36.020> all<00:03:36.200> weird<00:03:36.560> or<00:03:36.709> anything<00:03:36.739> on
