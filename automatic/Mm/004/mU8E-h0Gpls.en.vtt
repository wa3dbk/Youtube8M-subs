 many are special 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:31.890

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.649
 The Frankish is what it is in rehabilitate what 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.929
 a tip that all families with rather the 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:40.170
 a food bank stays healthy 

00:00:36.929 --> 00:00:42.960
 and acted at the same time completely 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.899
 great special with a hammer the 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:49.649
 Newbies in happiness how to carp 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:52.620
 is imaginative is the best one is 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.510
 how calm the honor therefore exactly 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.089
 that would be very good 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.969
 and because that's something special 

00:00:57.089 --> 00:01:02.249
 to prepare carp had even the 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.229
 leave to campaign when he is once 

00:01:02.249 --> 00:01:08.039
 not chance that exactly thus 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.810
 more with tie than best with it 

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:12.869
 can decompose what is especially important 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:16.920
 offer does not have a coffee 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:19.829
 he goes on to tell her, of course 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:23.189
 The preparation is baked graph and 

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:26.159
 blue an all kinds of preparation 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:29.490
 yes, the count will do this in 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:33.990
 a war refined with vinegar 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:36.240
 and also with white wine and that belongs 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.280
 after onions root vegetables and important 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.479
 especially a sufficient portion 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.469
 salt and that is a typical 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:44.159
 preparation not necessarily for 

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:46.649
 Franconia 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.960
 But it already starts in francs, for example 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.850
 starting in the coburg country up to 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.100
 thuringia saxony except for itself 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.159
 Holstein is the carp blue the 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.840
 typical way of preparation and the 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.579
 connection with the great addiction and also 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.009
 the great taste has the intervention 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:04.439
 the meat that easily I think too 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:07.200
 reminisce freshly cooked potatoes and 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.710
 the great white wine courage give result 1 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.259
 1 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.600
 this is solid and it will be something very 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.490
 very fine is what we know very much 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.170
 is appreciated 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:18.090
 carp blue but often not as half 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.069
 to put power in the fight like it to 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.959
 The banks are the case, but often 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:24.870
 as a whole fish and will then for the 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:26.730
 Families previously often also portioned in 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.709
 germany a bigger fish for 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.510
 the whole family is enough we have now 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:32.790
 Here is one of the smaller fish of the 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.130
 Intervention is suitable for two people 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.200
 but still you can give it to me completely 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.550
 well also show how to get it off of now 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.600
 the kitchen would still prepare 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:45.810
 would portion for the individual 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:48.900
 enjoyment by just being here 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:51.390
 at the side line times with the knife 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:55.440
 make a small cut and would 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:56.550
 then cut the skin a bit then 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.980
 take off the skin 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.140
 the skin is with by some people 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.459
 eaten but many want them too 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.310
 not and that's why I would do that in the 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:07.590
 Just take a break now 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.110
 and play here 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.280
 Things are going well here 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.780
 remove it very well 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.510
 we have the beautiful here 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:18.690
 fish pond in front of us and that along 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.709
 so below what would I do then 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:26.940
 just up 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:31.890
 also pull off so well and now pull 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:35.130
 of football sports themselves 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:38.150
 half programs about 44 between 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:41.090
 Muscles talk up here on the left is oblique 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:44.040
 one after the other in these 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:47.820
 between the purple between 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:49.650
 this now and here also in st 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:53.190
 in the back of the tail are also in the area 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:56.220
 It was a bit of a stir up to here 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:59.010
 everywhere here where the innards are where 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:01.859
 the abdominal cavity tonner is the area 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.430
 there are no bones inside, only the ones are 

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:04.500
 rib 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:07.170
 we can start below 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.260
 therefore here the meat only from the 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.980
 Carefully release lips 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:14.140
 we'll see 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.250
 yes, actually goes very well in the 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:19.440
 everything was right 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:22.090
 that would be just fine here too 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:25.150
 I can already give it to the plate 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:29.070
 want is in these pieces here 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:34.240
 no bones here are this meat 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:36.699
 live free and good one for kids or 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.560
 for seniors in the rest meat like 

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:44.289
 she said now and there would always be 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:46.030
 only here starting at the spine 

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:49.120
 is easy to lift up 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:51.270
 So you can do that and then here 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:54.010
 just put it on the plate 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:55.150
 and just below the spine 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:59.760
 fold away down 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:05.410
 and again the plaster here again 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:07.780
 lifted the meat and would now for 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:12.400
 the second portion just here 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:15.280
 this spine and the tail here 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.860
 touch and all this time 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.000
 carefully peel off 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:21.160
 since it is also quite good times 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:25.660
 watch out now and put that here 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:26.830
 Just have it on the page now 

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:28.090
 here we still the left left 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:30.700
 body half rain 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:33.720
 and after many here too the skin 

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:36.880
 Just wanted to be careful here 

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:39.039
 is also starting from the part 

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:41.080
 about to do a little bit different and 

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:43.270
 I 'll have it on my skin right now 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:46.770
 Plates stay that you can here 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:51.280
 I take very good to materialize 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:52.320
 so just do not take any for here 

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:57.330
 scrap 

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:58.460
 love to eat here some eat the 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:00.840
 Also likes to go with you 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:03.150
 and sometimes a little bit of it 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:08.720
 but many prefer that is 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:08.720
 Just go here too 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:18.530
 the second culprit we finished immediately 

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:18.530
 Can we fish then? 

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:22.690
 it participates in the skin of something 

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:25.780
 the vegetables 

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:27.550
 that was not only very good 

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:30.360
 An enrichment of the lace is there 

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:33.490
 also on the taste and the onions 

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:35.890
 also the onions are here in many 

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:38.850
 eaten gladly and from my point of view 

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:43.150
 could also mandatory for earls to 

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:46.590
 sufficient onions and then 

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:50.050
 fresh potatoes boiled potatoes 

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:51.940
 some butter milk cream 

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:54.640
 Of course, one thing is very important too 

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:58.180
 Flemish white one the round all 

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:59.740
 eat and give a treat we 

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:02.820
 really for the highest holidays 

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:02.820
 is suitable
