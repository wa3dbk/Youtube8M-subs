00:00:05.979 --> 00:00:10.330
 victory of the season in his visit to 

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:12.339
 domicile in his first victory to 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:14.709
 address in your visit to the coliseum 

00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:16.390
 Alfonso Perez at the expense of a getafe who 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:18.880
 He dominated almost the entire match but 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:21.340
 in the end he lost three important points 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:24.160
 we are seeing the first options of 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:27.640
 match as it is in the great shot of 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:29.910
 barker that moya caught with a big 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.890
 stretched 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.780
 the getafe presented himself carrying the 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.330
 domain of the party to the raise once 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.280
 more waiting behind ceding all the 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:40.739
 space of the world knowing that they are 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.050
 strong in defense and can take advantage 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.720
 some against we are now seeing a 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.519
 good opportunity for papakouly diop 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:50.580
 that ended up clearing catching better 

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:52.620
 said Miguel Ángel Moyá from that 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:56.040
 interesting arrivals would come 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.840
 by getafe how is the ball 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.000
 from miguel torres looking for jaime camil 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.390
 although he was the owner to the detriment of 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.770
 diego castro and he looked gustavo munúa 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.770
 sending the ball to corner kick 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.049
 presented the getafe some novelty 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.909
 interesting in the eleven as the entrance 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.740
 of hawk and especially also that of 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.550
 paco alcácer who played his first game 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.250
 as a starter this campaign 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:24.920
 He was very participative throughout the 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.690
 encounter near the goal was in this 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:30.950
 occasion where you will see it in the 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:35.200
 repetition pape diop you finished 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.200
 stealing the wallet in the last breath 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.950
 It came to rest with the Lord and 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:43.550
 smoking a cigar larger than the 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.440
 new arrival for the getafe 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:50.160
 Valera was close to sticking his head in and 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:51.750
 after the good shipment of pedro léon in 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.640
 the second part remained the tonic 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.530
 of the encounter the getafe dominated 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.600
 absolutely the party with the lift 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.690
 locked in his own field of play 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:03.150
 munúa came into action were the best 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.990
 minutes of getafe and munúa avoided the 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.990
 goal of mehdi lacen 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.990
 another center to the area and now the one 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.580
 cabeceaba was Álvaro Vázquez who had 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.670
 entered the second part the ex of the 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:20.160
 espanyol replacing paco alcácer who 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:22.740
 did not have a single goal scoring option 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.290
 a good arrival now for lift in 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.940
 this shot of pedro rivers another of the 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.880
 men who entered the second part did 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:32.400
 almost a triple change at the same time rubén 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:35.010
 Garcia Michel and Pedro River entered to 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.790
 give freshness that offensive line by 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:41.580
 behind the big obafemi martins 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:45.660
 in the getafe they also entered colunga 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.800
 diego castro and alvaro and eye the goal of 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.190
 the 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:53.940
 lift michelle in the 86th minute hunted 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:56.160
 that bounce and I would sneak it over a 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.600
 advanced miguel angel moyá few 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.610
 they hoped that the lift could 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.310
 take the three points at the end what 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.560
 he did thanks to this gold element of 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.750
 protagonist of the michel party at the end 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.500
