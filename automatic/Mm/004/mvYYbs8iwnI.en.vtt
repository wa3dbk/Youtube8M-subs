00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:07.900
 and now with short arms it's 

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:12.210
 your anger that's right I left the 

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:14.260
 room of the salle gaveau where 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.380
 was producing a guy I had come 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:18.999
 see by affectionate curiosity because 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:21.329
 I am very sensitive to the talent of 

00:00:18.999 --> 00:00:24.669
 others and especially young people 

00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:28.869
 who are called gaspard proust and then 

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:32.200
 all of a sudden I'm 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:32.890
 struck shocked by the things he said 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.510
 he 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.430
 like me he made me think 15 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.570
 glimpses the first time the decision he 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:41.500
 made me think of my boyfriend stone 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:45.070
 desproges I do not mourn 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:49.090
 every day and all of a sudden he tells him 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.510
 from him in pump to projects all to 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.670
 relatives 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.710
 he pretends to jerk off at my place 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:56.079
 it was necessary to use maturation in the 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:58.390
 like I'm joking with desproges I like 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:00.970
 me all of a sudden I say thank you there and 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:06.630
 who we or what and then and then follow 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:10.149
 the and flexibility of 2-2-2 2nd 3rd 4th degree 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.929
 i feel thatvilly things that me 

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:12.429
 displease 

00:01:10.929 --> 00:01:14.999
 you get up in full show in 

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:19.179
 full show but very very very 

00:01:14.999 --> 00:01:22.179
 discreetly game it's a game sort I 

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:25.210
 could have a discomfort nothing but no 

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:27.340
 I tell myself I can not he he knew this 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.229
 day what you were you were 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.659
 gone bah he knew that I was gone 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:33.819
 because I think I've been told since 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:36.549
 the hall the woman of the producer 

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:39.009
 that's the internet side had seen me 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:41.139
 part you swing all on the internet 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:43.060
 that I had left the room if he does not know 

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:45.909
 not today he is aware yes oh 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.920
 there and it turns out that you ji had 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:48.900
 things that I disliked ipa he has 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.810
 talked about 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:54.510
 Michel Onfray who is a friend of mine 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:57.090
 this good short I was bad I'm bad I did not 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:59.610
 wrong and what complicates things this 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.310
 that I had come with a journalist 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:05.550
 who wants me good which is called macha 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.720
 series and who is critical to the world and that 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:10.140
 I did not understand she was doing a 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:13.140
 paper on him and his world paper 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.190
 on gaspard proust and I saw her 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.210
 take notes but I believe that 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:21.209
 I was I have to short I do not have and whose 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:23.520
 I left then we said that and then 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:25.920
 he made a pretty reserved paper for 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.320
 do not say bad on gaspard proust 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:32.360
 the producer of gaspard proust 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:36.750
 is called laurent ruquier I was invited 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:38.640
 in his upcoming show since that 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:43.620
 I have my no longer there I consented to 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:47.420
 come and so at first it was in my 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:50.010
 promotion plan when my promo plan 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.660
 drucker all a sunday and then 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.180
 why not street feet now 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.100
 recognized that I find rather amusing no 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:00.709
 he too I find so much he is 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:03.840
 too well nothing touched 10 but good so 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:05.730
 and he had one thing that I was 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.800
 often censored in my living from 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:11.100
 so-called political reasons etc 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:13.739
 but then it's really that I have 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:16.800
 censored by a producer who was 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:21.360
 annoyed that I leave the room his 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:23.250
 foal and and kim charged by resident 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.110
 because I have friends in the house they 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:28.350
 are going to phone me to tell me he 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:30.690
 thought that c - who had influenced the 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:33.239
 journalist death is not 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:36.420
 mascate where is it 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:39.130
 and therefore take the risk of canceling 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:43.510
 a guy like me 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:45.010
 at the moment of these box of 50 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:47.200
 years of career for a guy that my 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.880
 foot is taking a risk because I 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.260
 make the costs always the shots of 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.730
 heart like the ball shots 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.410
 yeah so that's what I am we know 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.120
 not mean to get up right 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:57.160
 show when we did not pay for it 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:03.190
 I wanted to go caressing but 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:04.720
 chabal one is free I would have done to the 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:06.430
 place of ruquier I would have kept 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.460
 the invitation I would like to invite gaspard 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:12.670
 proust and we would have explained 

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:14.920
 sweetly I do not know death, that's it 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:17.350
 and when rudy and says he's left 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.390
 no he dati the producers he is 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:21.370
 theater director and I attacked a 

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:24.630
 of his foals do not they left 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.630
