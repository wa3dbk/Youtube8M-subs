00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
lot of people just do the quartz

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.190 
lot of people just do the quartz
conversion<00:00:32.940> but<00:00:33.180> I<00:00:33.360> like<00:00:33.600> keeping<00:00:33.930> stuff

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
conversion but I like keeping stuff

clocks I've fixed a few not a lot like
not<00:00:43.950> automotive<00:00:44.489> clocks<00:00:44.789> but<00:00:45.059> wind-up<00:00:45.480> clocks

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
not automotive clocks but wind-up clocks

show it to you real quick if I can and
that's<00:01:06.840> it<00:01:07.200> this<00:01:07.710> that's<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.159> original<00:01:08.369> color

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
that's it this that's the original color

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.030 
that's it this that's the original color
it's<00:01:09.119> marina<00:01:09.450> blue<00:01:09.720> I<00:01:10.290> think<00:01:10.590> those<00:01:10.860> are<00:01:10.890> the

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
it's marina blue I think those are the

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:19.270 
it's marina blue I think those are the
original<00:01:12.350> hubcaps<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:14.189> all<00:01:15.920> but<00:01:16.920> anyway<00:01:18.229> -

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
original hubcaps and all but anyway -

original hubcaps and all but anyway -
Shh<00:01:20.280> I<00:01:20.759> wanted<00:01:21.150> to<00:01:21.240> show<00:01:21.390> you<00:01:21.420> just<00:01:21.630> right<00:01:21.900> now

Shh I wanted to show you just right now

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:28.249 
Shh I wanted to show you just right now
that<00:01:23.750> it<00:01:24.750> is<00:01:25.080> working<00:01:25.770> I<00:01:27.080> don't<00:01:28.080> know<00:01:28.140> if

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
that it is working I don't know if

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.249 
that it is working I don't know if
you're<00:01:28.350> going<00:01:28.439> to<00:01:28.500> be<00:01:28.650> to<00:01:28.829> pick<00:01:28.979> it<00:01:29.130> up<00:01:29.280> it<00:01:29.520> pops

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:30.259 
you're going to be to pick it up it pops

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:32.569 
you're going to be to pick it up it pops
every<00:01:31.259> once<00:01:31.470> a<00:01:31.560> while<00:01:31.590> that's<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.070> points

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
every once a while that's the points

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.450 
every once a while that's the points
opening<00:01:33.180> that<00:01:33.420> that<00:01:34.259> pulls<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.770> mainspring

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
opening that that pulls the mainspring

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:42.940 
opening that that pulls the mainspring
and<00:01:36.829> the<00:01:37.829> mainspring<00:01:40.310> works<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.700> mechanism

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
and the mainspring works the mechanism

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.280 
and the mainspring works the mechanism
the<00:01:43.950> gears<00:01:44.220> for<00:01:44.700> about<00:01:45.600> a<00:01:45.630> minute<00:01:45.960> and<00:01:46.020> a<00:01:46.110> half

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
the gears for about a minute and a half

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.020 
the gears for about a minute and a half
maybe<00:01:46.649> two<00:01:46.979> minutes<00:01:47.159> at<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.549> most<00:01:47.579> I<00:01:48.000> think

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
maybe two minutes at the most I think

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.710 
maybe two minutes at the most I think
somewhere<00:01:48.720> around<00:01:48.810> there<00:01:49.759> you<00:01:50.759> can<00:01:50.909> see<00:01:51.180> the

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
somewhere around there you can see the

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.899 
somewhere around there you can see the
the<00:01:52.110> second<00:01:52.500> hand<00:01:52.710> going<00:01:52.950> mine<00:01:53.640> had<00:01:53.880> been

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
the second hand going mine had been

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:59.120 
the second hand going mine had been
broken<00:01:54.479> off<00:01:54.600> before<00:01:55.409> I<00:01:55.439> bought<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:55.740> car<00:01:56.130> and<00:01:58.130> I

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
broken off before I bought the car and I

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.840 
broken off before I bought the car and I
just<00:01:59.579> took<00:01:59.939> a<00:02:00.060> paperclip<00:02:00.600> a<00:02:01.549> really<00:02:02.549> small

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
just took a paperclip a really small

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.760 
just took a paperclip a really small
paperclip<00:02:03.299> and<00:02:03.840> it<00:02:04.110> turned<00:02:04.320> out<00:02:04.439> to<00:02:04.590> be<00:02:04.680> about

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
paperclip and it turned out to be about

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.980 
paperclip and it turned out to be about
the<00:02:04.979> same<00:02:05.189> diameter<00:02:05.460> as<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.180> little<00:02:06.509> nub<00:02:06.780> lit

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
the same diameter as the little nub lit

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.880 
the same diameter as the little nub lit
this<00:02:07.560> left

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890

on<00:02:10.009> the<00:02:10.340> on<00:02:10.850> the<00:02:11.210> clock<00:02:11.540> you<00:02:12.760> see<00:02:13.760> the<00:02:13.880> little<00:02:14.090> I

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
on the on the clock you see the little I

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.030 
on the on the clock you see the little I
don't<00:02:14.750> know<00:02:14.840> if<00:02:14.960> it's<00:02:15.080> gonna<00:02:15.230> pick<00:02:15.500> it<00:02:15.530> up<00:02:15.680> it's

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
don't know if it's gonna pick it up it's

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.060 
car whatever I don't take my car to car
shows<00:02:31.970> and<00:02:32.960> if<00:02:33.080> you<00:02:33.170> take<00:02:33.380> your<00:02:33.530> car<00:02:33.740> to<00:02:33.770> car

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
shows and if you take your car to car

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:37.420 
shows and if you take your car to car
shows<00:02:34.720> they'll<00:02:35.720> count<00:02:36.020> off<00:02:36.350> from<00:02:37.220> what<00:02:37.400> I

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
shows they'll count off from what I

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:38.740 
shows they'll count off from what I
understand<00:02:37.940> if<00:02:38.090> you<00:02:38.209> have<00:02:38.360> a<00:02:38.390> course

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
understand if you have a course

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:44.890 
understand if you have a course
conversion<00:02:40.630> so<00:02:42.040> anyway<00:02:43.070> there<00:02:43.459> it<00:02:43.580> is<00:02:43.900> ticking

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
conversion so anyway there it is ticking

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.960 
conversion so anyway there it is ticking
and<00:02:45.260> then<00:02:45.410> I'm<00:02:45.500> going<00:02:45.740> to<00:02:45.770> stop<00:02:46.400> the<00:02:46.580> camera

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
and then I'm going to stop the camera

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.479 
and then I'm going to stop the camera
and<00:02:47.120> we<00:02:48.110> adjust<00:02:48.260> everything<00:02:48.830> and<00:02:49.220> show<00:02:49.430> you

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:49.489 
and we adjust everything and show you

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:50.770 
and we adjust everything and show you
the<00:02:49.670> points<00:02:50.030> I'm<00:02:50.120> also<00:02:50.270> going<00:02:50.450> to<00:02:50.510> show<00:02:50.720> you

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
the points I'm also going to show you

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.770 
the points I'm also going to show you
how<00:02:51.080> to<00:02:51.140> adjust<00:02:51.440> the<00:02:51.739> time<00:02:52.209> the<00:02:53.209> speed<00:02:53.510> of<00:02:53.690> the

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
how to adjust the time the speed of the

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.520 
how to adjust the time the speed of the
clock<00:02:54.190> there's<00:02:55.190> this<00:02:55.720> big<00:02:56.720> what<00:02:57.200> I<00:02:57.260> call<00:02:57.500> a

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
clock there's this big what I call a

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.290 
clock there's this big what I call a
myth<00:02:57.920> or<00:02:59.650> whatever<00:03:00.940> floating<00:03:01.940> around<00:03:02.030> the

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300 
myth or whatever floating around the

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.830 
myth or whatever floating around the
internet<00:03:02.330> about<00:03:03.050> just<00:03:03.650> taking<00:03:03.800> the<00:03:04.070> hands<00:03:04.610> and

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
internet about just taking the hands and

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.390 
internet about just taking the hands and
moving<00:03:05.840> them<00:03:06.020> either<00:03:06.230> fat<00:03:06.560> forward<00:03:07.280> or

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
moving them either fat forward or

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.400 
moving them either fat forward or
backward<00:03:07.940> to<00:03:08.209> adjust<00:03:08.720> the<00:03:08.840> time<00:03:09.080> but<00:03:09.320> that's

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
backward to adjust the time but that's

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:12.100 
backward to adjust the time but that's
not<00:03:09.620> going<00:03:09.770> to<00:03:09.830> cut<00:03:10.070> it<00:03:10.220> I<00:03:10.430> read<00:03:11.420> where<00:03:11.660> one<00:03:11.870> guy

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
not going to cut it I read where one guy

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:17.320 
not going to cut it I read where one guy
had<00:03:12.800> been<00:03:12.830> doing<00:03:13.250> that<00:03:13.370> a<00:03:13.400> year<00:03:15.160> if<00:03:16.160> his<00:03:16.910> clock

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:17.330 
had been doing that a year if his clock

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.810 
had been doing that a year if his clock
is<00:03:17.570> still<00:03:17.840> neither<00:03:18.590> too<00:03:18.769> fast<00:03:19.070> or<00:03:19.310> too<00:03:19.489> slow<00:03:19.519> I

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:19.820 
is still neither too fast or too slow I

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.060 
is still neither too fast or too slow I
don't<00:03:20.150> remember<00:03:20.390> which<00:03:20.720> but<00:03:21.709> I'm<00:03:21.830> going<00:03:22.010> to

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:22.070 
don't remember which but I'm going to

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:23.590 
don't remember which but I'm going to
show<00:03:22.250> you<00:03:22.340> the<00:03:22.430> proper<00:03:22.850> way<00:03:22.880> this<00:03:23.180> clock<00:03:23.390> is

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:23.600 
show you the proper way this clock is

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.770 
show you the proper way this clock is
pretty<00:03:23.870> accurate<00:03:24.290> now<00:03:24.830> because<00:03:25.250> I<00:03:25.780> adjusted

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
pretty accurate now because I adjusted

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:32.380 
pretty accurate now because I adjusted
the<00:03:27.670> fast<00:03:28.670> and<00:03:28.970> slow<00:03:30.610> lever<00:03:31.610> in<00:03:31.790> the<00:03:31.910> back<00:03:32.090> it's

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
the fast and slow lever in the back it's

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.100 
the fast and slow lever in the back it's
not<00:03:32.570> marked<00:03:32.989> and<00:03:33.850> I<00:03:34.850> only<00:03:35.269> knew<00:03:35.540> to<00:03:35.660> look<00:03:35.840> for

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:36.110 
not marked and I only knew to look for

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:38.380 
not marked and I only knew to look for
it<00:03:36.200> because<00:03:36.320> there<00:03:37.130> again<00:03:37.489> I<00:03:37.790> have<00:03:38.150> an<00:03:38.239> old

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
it because there again I have an old

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:40.900 
it because there again I have an old
pocket<00:03:38.870> watch<00:03:39.019> from<00:03:39.049> the<00:03:39.440> 30s<00:03:39.890> that<00:03:40.670> works

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
pocket watch from the 30s that works

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:44.530 
pocket watch from the 30s that works
like<00:03:41.180> that<00:03:41.239> and<00:03:42.610> but<00:03:43.610> anyway<00:03:43.910> I<00:03:43.940> just<00:03:44.269> have<00:03:44.420> to

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
like that and but anyway I just have to

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.530 
like that and but anyway I just have to
camera<00:03:44.930> and<00:03:44.989> readjust
