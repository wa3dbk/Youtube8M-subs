00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
and that is essentially I think how they

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.299 
and that is essentially I think how they
approach<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.930> 50th<00:00:37.350> anniversary<00:00:37.469> special

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
approach the 50th anniversary special

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:39.830 
approach the 50th anniversary special
they're<00:00:38.430> like<00:00:38.550> let's<00:00:38.760> throw<00:00:39.149> in<00:00:39.300> all<00:00:39.420> the

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
they're like let's throw in all the

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.380 
they're like let's throw in all the
references<00:00:40.160> which<00:00:41.160> is<00:00:41.370> really<00:00:41.610> great<00:00:41.940> it<00:00:42.210> was

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
references which is really great it was

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.080 
references which is really great it was
packed<00:00:42.780> full<00:00:42.960> of<00:00:43.170> whimsy<00:00:43.379> um<00:00:43.800> I<00:00:44.399> think<00:00:44.670> overall

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
packed full of whimsy um I think overall

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.450 
packed full of whimsy um I think overall
I<00:00:45.149> would<00:00:45.329> say<00:00:45.450> that<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.780> episode<00:00:46.079> was<00:00:46.260> good<00:00:46.680> it

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
I would say that the episode was good it

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.830 
I would say that the episode was good it
wasn't<00:00:47.640> great<00:00:47.989> but<00:00:48.989> it<00:00:49.140> was<00:00:49.230> good<00:00:49.440> um<00:00:50.420> so<00:00:51.420> there

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
wasn't great but it was good um so there

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.470 
wasn't great but it was good um so there
was<00:00:51.989> whimsy<00:00:52.620> everywhere<00:00:53.550> was<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.300> most

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
was whimsy everywhere was the most

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.900 
was whimsy everywhere was the most
whimsical<00:00:54.660> whims<00:00:55.140> that<00:00:55.530> ever<00:00:55.649> whims<00:00:55.910> do

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
whimsical whims that ever whims do

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.770 
whimsical whims that ever whims do
that's<00:00:57.870> enough<00:00:58.140> of<00:00:58.260> that<00:00:58.399> um<00:00:59.449> but<00:01:00.449> you<00:01:00.750> know

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
that's enough of that um but you know

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.349 
that's enough of that um but you know
what<00:01:00.960> I<00:01:01.020> like<00:01:01.170> with<00:01:01.230> my<00:01:01.500> whimsy<00:01:01.859> plot<00:01:02.670> and<00:01:03.000> I

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
what I like with my whimsy plot and I

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.600 
what I like with my whimsy plot and I
don't<00:01:03.420> mean<00:01:03.660> like<00:01:03.750> three<00:01:04.350> plots<00:01:04.650> running

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
don't mean like three plots running

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.850 
don't mean like three plots running
alongside<00:01:05.880> each<00:01:06.150> other<00:01:06.409> overlapping<00:01:07.409> in<00:01:07.680> ways

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
alongside each other overlapping in ways

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.190 
alongside each other overlapping in ways
that<00:01:07.890> don't<00:01:08.130> make<00:01:08.310> sense<00:01:08.580> which<00:01:09.030> I<00:01:09.330> feel<00:01:09.810> like

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
that don't make sense which I feel like

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.230 
that don't make sense which I feel like
that's<00:01:10.680> what<00:01:10.830> was<00:01:11.040> happening<00:01:11.070> in<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.549> 50th<00:01:12.030> I

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
that's what was happening in the 50th I

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.039 
that's what was happening in the 50th I
feel<00:01:13.229> like<00:01:13.350> there<00:01:13.470> was<00:01:13.560> this<00:01:13.970> epic<00:01:14.970> turmoil<00:01:15.750> of

feel like there was this epic turmoil of

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.010 
feel like there was this epic turmoil of

about<00:01:19.110> whether<00:01:19.350> or<00:01:19.470> not<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:19.770> blow<00:01:19.950> up

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070

by his decision and I think Paul McGann

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.810 
by his decision and I think Paul McGann
in<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.649> debt<00:02:04.860> in<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.189> night<00:02:05.430> of<00:02:05.579> the<00:02:05.670> doctor

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
in the debt in the night of the doctor

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.600 
in the debt in the night of the doctor
special<00:02:06.509> really<00:02:07.170> showed<00:02:07.530> that<00:02:07.560> and<00:02:08.069> and<00:02:08.459> it

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
special really showed that and and it

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:09.800 
special really showed that and and it
was<00:02:08.700> a<00:02:08.759> very<00:02:08.789> weighty<00:02:09.090> decision<00:02:09.569> that<00:02:09.660> he<00:02:09.780> made

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
was a very weighty decision that he made

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.250 
was a very weighty decision that he made
to<00:02:10.020> regenerate<00:02:10.950> to

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
to regenerate to

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.289 
to regenerate to
come<00:02:11.409> the<00:02:11.650> warrior<00:02:12.040> instead<00:02:12.730> of<00:02:12.760> the<00:02:12.939> doctor

00:02:13.289 --> 00:02:13.299 
come the warrior instead of the doctor

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:16.789 
come the warrior instead of the doctor
but<00:02:13.750> then<00:02:13.959> in<00:02:14.319> the<00:02:14.560> episode<00:02:14.950> he<00:02:15.250> was<00:02:15.459> very

00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:16.799 
but then in the episode he was very

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:19.229 
but then in the episode he was very
nonchalant<00:02:17.799> about<00:02:17.920> those<00:02:18.250> the<00:02:18.790> whole<00:02:18.970> thing

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
nonchalant about those the whole thing

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:22.170 
nonchalant about those the whole thing
like<00:02:19.450> he<00:02:20.079> was<00:02:20.319> making<00:02:20.799> references<00:02:21.640> to<00:02:21.700> cup<00:02:22.030> of

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
like he was making references to cup of

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.179 
like he was making references to cup of
soup<00:02:22.390> and<00:02:22.540> Sanchez<00:02:23.170> and<00:02:23.409> Dicky<00:02:23.709> bowties<00:02:24.159> and

00:02:24.179 --> 00:02:24.189 
soup and Sanchez and Dicky bowties and

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:29.460 
soup and Sanchez and Dicky bowties and
he<00:02:25.000> didn't<00:02:25.239> seem<00:02:25.480> so<00:02:26.290> concerned<00:02:26.829> about<00:02:28.470> what

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
he didn't seem so concerned about what

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.860 
he didn't seem so concerned about what
was<00:02:29.620> going<00:02:29.680> on<00:02:30.040> back<00:02:30.310> in<00:02:30.370> Gallifrey<00:02:31.030> and<00:02:31.360> it

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
was going on back in Gallifrey and it

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.690 
was going on back in Gallifrey and it
was<00:02:31.959> very<00:02:32.079> cool<00:02:32.379> seeing<00:02:32.680> bad<00:02:32.920> wolf<00:02:33.129> I<00:02:33.280> like<00:02:33.459> bad

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
wolf I'm glad they used Billie Piper in

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.710 
wolf I'm glad they used Billie Piper in
that<00:02:35.769> way<00:02:35.920> because<00:02:36.190> I<00:02:36.549> really<00:02:37.209> didn't<00:02:37.540> want

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
that way because I really didn't want

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.140 
that way because I really didn't want
just<00:02:38.260> another<00:02:38.470> excuse<00:02:38.980> for<00:02:39.010> ten<00:02:39.430> and<00:02:39.640> rose

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
just another excuse for ten and rose

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.330 
just another excuse for ten and rose
tyler<00:02:40.450> to<00:02:40.689> make<00:02:40.840> out<00:02:41.049> because<00:02:41.470> that's<00:02:42.010> being

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
tyler to make out because that's being

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.330 
tyler to make out because that's being
done<00:02:42.629> so<00:02:43.629> many<00:02:43.810> times<00:02:44.079> now<00:02:44.440> I<00:02:44.680> think<00:02:44.980> it's<00:02:45.220> just

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
done so many times now I think it's just

00:02:56.369 --> 00:02:56.379 
many different parallel universes it's

00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:59.759

was<00:03:01.989> great<00:03:02.370> but<00:03:03.370> again<00:03:03.609> she<00:03:03.639> kind<00:03:04.090> of<00:03:04.120> had<00:03:04.239> a

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:04.269 
was great but again she kind of had a

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:06.119 
was great but again she kind of had a
background<00:03:04.510> roll<00:03:04.989> it<00:03:05.409> was<00:03:05.530> mainly<00:03:05.709> about<00:03:06.010> the

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:06.129 
background roll it was mainly about the

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:07.410 
background roll it was mainly about the
doctors<00:03:06.459> and<00:03:06.639> that's<00:03:06.760> fine<00:03:06.970> because<00:03:07.120> it's<00:03:07.329> the

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
doctors and that's fine because it's the

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.349 
doctors and that's fine because it's the
50th<00:03:07.720> doctor<00:03:08.049> who<00:03:08.139> special<00:03:08.560> but<00:03:09.159> a<00:03:09.370> lot<00:03:10.150> of<00:03:10.180> it

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
didn't make sense I don't understand how

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.539 
didn't make sense I don't understand how
they<00:03:12.639> escaped<00:03:13.060> the<00:03:13.329> top<00:03:14.230> 11th<00:03:14.889> timeline<00:03:15.310> last

it<00:03:53.049> also<00:03:53.230> doesn't<00:03:53.620> make<00:03:54.010> a<00:03:54.040> lot<00:03:54.310> of<00:03:54.370> sense

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489 
it also doesn't make a lot of sense

00:03:54.489 --> 00:04:00.270 
it also doesn't make a lot of sense
because<00:03:57.510> 11<00:03:58.510> would<00:03:58.659> remember<00:03:58.930> and<00:03:59.379> eight<00:04:00.069> and

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
because 11 would remember and eight and

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.309 
because 11 would remember and eight and
a<00:04:00.340> half<00:04:00.370> would<00:04:01.000> definitely<00:04:01.720> remember<00:04:01.870> because

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:02.319 
a half would definitely remember because

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:04.530 
a half would definitely remember because
he<00:04:02.409> turns<00:04:02.650> into<00:04:02.799> nine<00:04:03.099> and<00:04:03.370> I<00:04:03.940> felt<00:04:04.299> like<00:04:04.419> the

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
he turns into nine and I felt like the

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:05.819 
he turns into nine and I felt like the
episode<00:04:04.840> was<00:04:04.989> definitely<00:04:05.409> written<00:04:05.680> to

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:05.829 
episode was definitely written to

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:07.649 
episode was definitely written to
involve<00:04:06.159> nine<00:04:06.459> because<00:04:06.699> bad<00:04:07.030> wolf<00:04:07.269> was<00:04:07.389> trying

00:04:07.649 --> 00:04:07.659 
involve nine because bad wolf was trying

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:10.439 
involve nine because bad wolf was trying
to<00:04:07.780> show<00:04:07.989> them<00:04:08.319> show<00:04:09.129> eight<00:04:09.760> and<00:04:09.879> a<00:04:09.909> half<00:04:09.940> what

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:10.449 
to show them show eight and a half what

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:12.899 
to show them show eight and a half what
he<00:04:10.569> would<00:04:10.690> become<00:04:11.049> if<00:04:11.349> he<00:04:12.220> made<00:04:12.430> that<00:04:12.609> decision

00:04:12.899 --> 00:04:12.909 
he would become if he made that decision

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:15.449 
he would become if he made that decision
and<00:04:13.269> to<00:04:13.659> me<00:04:13.840> it<00:04:14.169> seemed<00:04:14.620> like<00:04:14.799> 10<00:04:15.250> and<00:04:15.370> 11

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:15.459 
and to me it seemed like 10 and 11

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:17.250 
and to me it seemed like 10 and 11
weren't<00:04:15.909> actually<00:04:16.150> bad<00:04:16.570> things<00:04:16.930> that<00:04:17.109> turn

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260 
weren't actually bad things that turn

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:18.990 
weren't actually bad things that turn
into<00:04:17.289> whereas<00:04:17.889> if<00:04:18.010> nine<00:04:18.220> had<00:04:18.430> been<00:04:18.459> present<00:04:18.909> in

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
into whereas if nine had been present in

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000 
into whereas if nine had been present in
the<00:04:19.120> episode<00:04:19.419> he<00:04:19.930> had<00:04:20.139> that<00:04:20.320> very<00:04:20.560> dark

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.010 
the episode he had that very dark

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:23.820 
the episode he had that very dark
haunted<00:04:21.639> fresh<00:04:22.240> from<00:04:22.450> the<00:04:22.599> war<00:04:22.810> kind<00:04:23.380> of

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
haunted fresh from the war kind of

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.429 
haunted fresh from the war kind of

00:04:42.959 --> 00:04:42.969 
a lot of his anguish which he clearly

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:46.050 
a lot of his anguish which he clearly
had<00:04:43.240> from<00:04:43.419> the<00:04:43.539> events<00:04:43.900> of<00:04:44.020> the<00:04:45.000> Gallifrey<00:04:46.000> in

had from the events of the Gallifrey in

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:52.159 
had from the events of the Gallifrey in
time<00:04:46.300> war<00:04:46.509> but<00:04:46.780> I<00:04:48.150> just<00:04:49.150> feel<00:04:49.419> like<00:04:49.770> the

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:52.169 
time war but I just feel like the

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:54.719 
time war but I just feel like the
intensity<00:04:53.169> of<00:04:53.409> that<00:04:53.439> moment<00:04:53.800> fell<00:04:54.250> short<00:04:54.550> I

00:04:54.719 --> 00:04:54.729 
intensity of that moment fell short I

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:56.249 
intensity of that moment fell short I
like<00:04:55.210> the<00:04:55.360> idea<00:04:55.449> of<00:04:55.659> them<00:04:55.840> all<00:04:55.960> coming

00:04:56.249 --> 00:04:56.259 
like the idea of them all coming

00:04:56.259 --> 00:04:57.779 
like the idea of them all coming
together<00:04:56.379> to<00:04:56.650> press<00:04:56.830> the<00:04:56.949> button<00:04:57.190> and<00:04:57.340> I<00:04:57.610> feel

00:04:57.779 --> 00:04:57.789 
together to press the button and I feel

00:04:57.789 --> 00:04:58.709 
together to press the button and I feel
like<00:04:57.909> that<00:04:58.090> could<00:04:58.120> have<00:04:58.360> been<00:04:58.419> a<00:04:58.479> really

00:04:58.709 --> 00:04:58.719 
like that could have been a really

00:04:58.719 --> 00:05:00.990 
like that could have been a really
beautiful<00:04:58.960> ending<00:04:59.379> and<00:05:00.219> it<00:05:00.699> would<00:05:00.819> have<00:05:00.909> been

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.000 
beautiful ending and it would have been

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.999 
beautiful ending and it would have been
devastating<00:05:01.659> but<00:05:02.080> at<00:05:02.169> least<00:05:02.259> the<00:05:02.650> burden

00:05:02.999 --> 00:05:03.009 
devastating but at least the burden

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:04.890 
devastating but at least the burden
would<00:05:03.099> have<00:05:03.219> been<00:05:03.340> shared<00:05:03.669> but<00:05:04.330> instead<00:05:04.539> they

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:04.900 
would have been shared but instead they

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.980 
would have been shared but instead they
kind<00:05:05.259> of<00:05:05.349> just<00:05:05.409> messed<00:05:06.219> with<00:05:06.490> time<00:05:06.849> and<00:05:07.810> I<00:05:07.930> know

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:07.990 
kind of just messed with time and I know

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:09.300 
kind of just messed with time and I know
it's<00:05:08.199> Doctor<00:05:08.440> Who<00:05:08.560> and<00:05:08.740> I<00:05:08.830> know<00:05:08.889> you<00:05:09.039> can<00:05:09.190> mess

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.310 
it's Doctor Who and I know you can mess

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:11.070 
it's Doctor Who and I know you can mess
with<00:05:09.430> time<00:05:09.610> but<00:05:10.449> I'm<00:05:10.539> pretty<00:05:10.690> sure<00:05:10.810> there<00:05:11.020> are

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.080 
with time but I'm pretty sure there are

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:12.839 
with time but I'm pretty sure there are
fixed<00:05:11.319> points<00:05:11.590> I<00:05:11.680> mean<00:05:11.830> even<00:05:11.979> 10<00:05:12.340> said<00:05:12.639> we

00:05:12.839 --> 00:05:12.849 
fixed points I mean even 10 said we

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:13.950 
fixed points I mean even 10 said we
shouldn't<00:05:13.120> be<00:05:13.180> allowed<00:05:13.360> to<00:05:13.419> be<00:05:13.629> here<00:05:13.840> but

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:13.960 
shouldn't be allowed to be here but

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.050 
shouldn't be allowed to be here but
because<00:05:14.229> bad<00:05:14.440> wolf<00:05:14.710> says<00:05:14.949> so<00:05:15.219> we<00:05:15.759> can<00:05:15.909> do

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:16.060 
because bad wolf says so we can do

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:19.709 
because bad wolf says so we can do
whatever<00:05:16.300> we<00:05:16.479> want<00:05:16.629> I<00:05:17.789> just<00:05:18.789> don't<00:05:19.090> know<00:05:19.360> if

00:05:19.709 --> 00:05:19.719 
whatever we want I just don't know if

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:22.830 
whatever we want I just don't know if
I'm<00:05:20.469> cool<00:05:20.919> with<00:05:20.949> that<00:05:21.219> but<00:05:22.029> I<00:05:22.180> rewatched<00:05:22.509> it

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:22.840 
I'm cool with that but I rewatched it

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:24.749 
I'm cool with that but I rewatched it
and<00:05:23.020> I<00:05:23.439> feel<00:05:23.680> like<00:05:23.830> if<00:05:24.039> we<00:05:24.159> just<00:05:24.189> think<00:05:24.550> of<00:05:24.669> it

00:05:24.749 --> 00:05:24.759 
and I feel like if we just think of it

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:27.330 
and I feel like if we just think of it
as<00:05:24.939> separate<00:05:25.449> so<00:05:26.199> let's<00:05:26.560> put<00:05:26.740> it<00:05:26.860> in<00:05:27.009> its<00:05:27.159> own

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:27.340 
as separate so let's put it in its own

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:30.510 
as separate so let's put it in its own

Gallifrey lives just this once all of
Galilee<00:05:39.400> lives<00:05:40.409> we<00:05:41.409> can<00:05:41.589> just<00:05:41.770> pretend<00:05:41.889> that

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:42.250 
Galilee lives we can just pretend that

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:44.369 
Galilee lives we can just pretend that
it<00:05:42.339> was<00:05:42.370> a<00:05:42.490> really<00:05:42.759> good<00:05:43.029> fantastic<00:05:43.479> little

it was a really good fantastic little
moment<00:05:45.190> in<00:05:45.279> time<00:05:45.490> which<00:05:46.240> is<00:05:46.270> separate<00:05:46.900> from

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:46.960 
moment in time which is separate from

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.769 
moment in time which is separate from

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:52.690 
like the marvel universe where stuff

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:54.899 
like the marvel universe where stuff
happens<00:05:53.139> and<00:05:53.349> sometimes<00:05:53.979> cabs<00:05:54.400> and<00:05:54.520> America's

and<00:05:59.800> sometimes<00:06:00.400> he's<00:06:00.550> not<00:06:00.729> but<00:06:01.089> I'm<00:06:01.150> really

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:01.300 
and sometimes he's not but I'm really

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:02.909

not<00:06:01.479> going<00:06:01.659> to<00:06:01.750> go<00:06:01.870> on<00:06:01.990> a<00:06:02.050> codebook<00:06:02.409> spiel<00:06:02.710> but

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:02.919 
not going to go on a codebook spiel but

00:06:02.919 --> 00:06:04.260 
not going to go on a codebook spiel but
basically<00:06:03.219> yeah<00:06:03.400> that<00:06:03.789> happens<00:06:04.089> in<00:06:04.180> other

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:04.270 
basically yeah that happens in other

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:05.999 
basically yeah that happens in other
universes<00:06:04.810> and<00:06:04.990> it<00:06:05.379> doesn't<00:06:05.620> necessarily

00:06:05.999 --> 00:06:06.009 
universes and it doesn't necessarily

00:06:06.009 --> 00:06:08.670 
universes and it doesn't necessarily
affect<00:06:06.099> one<00:06:07.029> of<00:06:07.120> the<00:06:07.180> main<00:06:07.389> cannon<00:06:07.810> streams<00:06:08.139> so

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:08.680 
affect one of the main cannon streams so

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:11.820 
affect one of the main cannon streams so
let's<00:06:08.949> just<00:06:09.250> do<00:06:09.430> that<00:06:09.610> and<00:06:10.289> count<00:06:11.289> it<00:06:11.440> up<00:06:11.560> and

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:11.830 
let's just do that and count it up and

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:14.519 
let's just do that and count it up and
just<00:06:12.509> yay<00:06:13.509> embrace<00:06:14.050> the<00:06:14.080> wibbly-wobbly

00:06:14.519 --> 00:06:14.529 
just yay embrace the wibbly-wobbly

00:06:14.529 --> 00:06:17.100 
just yay embrace the wibbly-wobbly
timey-wimey<00:06:14.560> meanness<00:06:15.520> of<00:06:15.669> it<00:06:15.849> oh<00:06:16.020> the<00:06:17.020> other

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:17.110 
timey-wimey meanness of it oh the other

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:19.140 
timey-wimey meanness of it oh the other
thing<00:06:17.199> I<00:06:17.409> didn't<00:06:17.650> understand<00:06:18.069> which<00:06:18.550> was<00:06:18.759> when

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:19.150 
thing I didn't understand which was when

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:20.640 
thing I didn't understand which was when
the<00:06:19.270> doctors<00:06:19.569> all<00:06:19.750> came<00:06:19.960> together<00:06:20.169> at<00:06:20.469> the<00:06:20.620> end

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:20.650 
the doctors all came together at the end

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:23.100 
the doctors all came together at the end
and<00:06:21.039> they<00:06:21.789> were<00:06:22.000> standing<00:06:22.629> in<00:06:22.719> that<00:06:22.750> big

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:23.110 
and they were standing in that big

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:26.100 
and they were standing in that big
timeline<00:06:23.500> of<00:06:23.949> all<00:06:24.759> the<00:06:25.029> past<00:06:25.270> doctors<00:06:25.810> and<00:06:25.990> I

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:26.110 
timeline of all the past doctors and I

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:28.170 
timeline of all the past doctors and I
just<00:06:26.349> where<00:06:26.740> is<00:06:26.979> that<00:06:27.009> in<00:06:27.400> the<00:06:27.639> world<00:06:27.849> where

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:28.180 
just where is that in the world where

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:30.089 
just where is that in the world where
thought<00:06:28.419> in<00:06:28.599> the<00:06:28.690> universe<00:06:29.080> every<00:06:29.500> ness<00:06:29.650> it

00:06:30.089 --> 00:06:30.099 
thought in the universe every ness it

00:06:30.099 --> 00:06:32.699 
thought in the universe every ness it
was<00:06:30.219> just<00:06:30.400> a<00:06:30.539> visual<00:06:31.539> representation<00:06:32.020> of<00:06:32.500> all

00:06:32.699 --> 00:06:32.709 
was just a visual representation of all

00:06:32.709 --> 00:06:34.080 
was just a visual representation of all
previous<00:06:33.339> regeneration

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:34.090 
previous regeneration

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:36.720 
previous regeneration
but<00:06:34.330> I<00:06:34.419> we're<00:06:34.900> in<00:06:35.110> space<00:06:35.260> so<00:06:35.710> all<00:06:36.070> of<00:06:36.130> the<00:06:36.490> Time

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:36.730 
but I we're in space so all of the Time

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:38.189 
but I we're in space so all of the Time
Lords<00:06:37.150> do<00:06:37.330> all<00:06:37.600> of<00:06:37.630> the<00:06:37.840> doctors<00:06:38.020> just

00:06:38.189 --> 00:06:38.199

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:41.440 
standing there and going ah isn't space

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:44.219 
standing there and going ah isn't space
just<00:06:41.830> great<00:06:42.220> I<00:06:42.550> mean<00:06:43.180> I'm<00:06:43.330> sure<00:06:43.570> they're<00:06:43.930> doing

00:06:44.219 --> 00:06:44.229 
just great I mean I'm sure they're doing

00:06:44.229 --> 00:06:47.189 
just great I mean I'm sure they're doing
that<00:06:44.380> if<00:06:45.220> they<00:06:45.490> could<00:06:45.790> but<00:06:46.750> I<00:06:46.780> was<00:06:47.020> a<00:06:47.080> bit

00:06:47.189 --> 00:06:47.199 
that if they could but I was a bit

00:06:47.199 --> 00:06:49.590 
that if they could but I was a bit
random<00:06:47.380> and<00:06:48.160> I<00:06:48.550> didn't<00:06:48.820> know<00:06:48.880> call<00:06:49.270> me<00:06:49.300> I'll

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:49.600 
random and I didn't know call me I'll

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.080 
random and I didn't know call me I'll
dream<00:06:49.900> did<00:06:50.590> a<00:06:50.620> different<00:06:51.040> review<00:06:51.370> when<00:06:52.060> I

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:52.090 
dream did a different review when I

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:54.600 
dream did a different review when I
first<00:06:52.330> got<00:06:52.510> back<00:06:52.720> and<00:06:53.020> I<00:06:53.560> had<00:06:53.830> to<00:06:54.040> rewatch<00:06:54.550> it

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:54.610 
first got back and I had to rewatch it

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:57.140 
first got back and I had to rewatch it
and<00:06:54.850> think<00:06:55.000> about<00:06:55.060> it<00:06:55.210> for<00:06:55.270> a<00:06:55.449> bit<00:06:55.479> and

00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:57.150 
and think about it for a bit and

00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:03.860 
and think about it for a bit and
condense<00:06:58.150> my<00:06:58.330> thoughts<00:06:58.600> and<00:07:00.300> this<00:07:01.300> is<00:07:01.540> then

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:03.870 
condense my thoughts and this is then

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:11.110 
condense my thoughts and this is then
we're<00:07:04.870> done<00:07:04.990> by<00:07:05.700> turtles

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:11.120 

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:14.680 

I<00:07:11.620> really<00:07:12.620> loved<00:07:12.860> the<00:07:13.370> line<00:07:13.639> that<00:07:14.030> John<00:07:14.479> Hurt

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:14.690 
I really loved the line that John Hurt

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:18.969 
I really loved the line that John Hurt
had<00:07:15.020> about<00:07:15.639> how<00:07:17.110> heroes<00:07:18.110> are<00:07:18.260> forged<00:07:18.500> in<00:07:18.710> fire

00:07:18.969 --> 00:07:18.979 
had about how heroes are forged in fire

00:07:18.979 --> 00:07:26.250 
had about how heroes are forged in fire
and<00:07:19.010> it's<00:07:19.340> up<00:07:19.520> its<00:07:20.150> up<00:07:20.300> to<00:07:20.479> people<00:07:20.840> of<00:07:20.930> lesser

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:26.260 

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:33.880 

yeah<00:07:27.260> that<00:07:27.530> quote<00:07:27.860> oh<00:07:30.610> never<00:07:31.610> mind
