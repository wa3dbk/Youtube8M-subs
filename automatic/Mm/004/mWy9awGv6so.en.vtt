wheel<00:00:30.449> de<00:00:30.660> sisal<00:00:31.019> wheel<00:00:31.199> and<00:00:31.439> I'm<00:00:31.800> going<00:00:31.949> to

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
wheel de sisal wheel and I'm going to

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.370 
wheel de sisal wheel and I'm going to
use<00:00:32.189> some<00:00:32.460> black<00:00:32.489> cutting<00:00:33.239> compound<00:00:33.780> this<00:00:34.170> is

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
use some black cutting compound this is

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.020 
use some black cutting compound this is
fairly<00:00:34.620> aggressive<00:00:35.250> and<00:00:35.579> then<00:00:35.700> I'm<00:00:35.820> going<00:00:35.969> to

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
fairly aggressive and then I'm going to

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.119 
fairly aggressive and then I'm going to
move<00:00:36.149> to<00:00:36.210> a<00:00:36.480> tight<00:00:36.809> spiral<00:00:37.140> bound<00:00:37.530> and<00:00:37.829> then

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
move to a tight spiral bound and then

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.450 
move to a tight spiral bound and then
I'll<00:00:38.219> finish<00:00:38.399> over<00:00:38.850> here<00:00:39.090> so<00:00:40.219> before<00:00:41.219> I<00:00:41.280> get

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
I'll finish over here so before I get

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.619 
I'll finish over here so before I get
started<00:00:41.670> here<00:00:41.910> because<00:00:42.059> it<00:00:42.120> will<00:00:42.180> probably<00:00:42.360> be

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
started here because it will probably be

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.720 
started here because it will probably be
noisy<00:00:43.020> I<00:00:43.170> am<00:00:43.530> going<00:00:43.770> to<00:00:43.829> basically<00:00:44.309> there's

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
noisy I am going to basically there's

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.790 
noisy I am going to basically there's
two<00:00:44.789> methods<00:00:45.390> when<00:00:45.570> you<00:00:45.660> polish<00:00:45.899> you<00:00:46.559> can

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
two methods when you polish you can

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.830 
two methods when you polish you can
polish<00:00:47.039> with<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:48.059> wheel<00:00:48.270> so<00:00:48.510> as<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.719> wheel

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
polish with the wheel so as the wheel

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.200 
polish with the wheel so as the wheel
spinning<00:00:49.230> this<00:00:49.440> way<00:00:49.680> I<00:00:49.920> can<00:00:50.309> go<00:00:50.430> with<00:00:50.760> it<00:00:51.030> and

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
spinning this way I can go with it and

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.299 
spinning this way I can go with it and
that<00:00:51.449> that<00:00:51.780> way<00:00:51.989> is<00:00:52.020> going<00:00:52.320> to<00:00:52.410> be<00:00:52.590> a<00:00:52.800> little

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
that that way is going to be a little

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.250 
that that way is going to be a little
bit<00:00:53.430> of<00:00:53.489> a<00:00:53.579> smoother<00:00:53.940> finish<00:00:53.969> or<00:00:54.629> I<00:00:54.809> can<00:00:55.020> pull

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
bit of a smoother finish or I can pull

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.720 
bit of a smoother finish or I can pull
against<00:00:55.770> it<00:00:55.890> which<00:00:55.980> is<00:00:56.129> going<00:00:56.219> to<00:00:56.309> make<00:00:56.489> more

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
against it which is going to make more

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.849 
against it which is going to make more
of<00:00:56.789> a<00:00:56.879> cutting<00:00:57.270> effect<00:00:57.449> so<00:00:58.230> I'm<00:00:58.620> going<00:00:58.800> to

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
of a cutting effect so I'm going to

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.080 
of a cutting effect so I'm going to
start<00:00:59.070> with<00:00:59.190> this<00:00:59.309> wheel<00:00:59.520> because<00:00:59.699> I<00:00:59.760> want<00:01:00.000> to

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
start with this wheel because I want to

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.490 
start with this wheel because I want to
be<00:01:00.180> aggressive<00:01:00.390> I'm<00:01:00.780> going<00:01:00.960> to<00:01:01.020> actually

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
be aggressive I'm going to actually

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.860 
be aggressive I'm going to actually
start<00:01:01.920> by<00:01:02.489> cutting<00:01:02.820> and<00:01:03.149> then<00:01:03.539> I'm<00:01:03.629> going<00:01:03.809> to

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
start by cutting and then I'm going to

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.630 
start by cutting and then I'm going to
finish<00:01:04.199> by<00:01:04.379> by<00:01:05.040> going<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.430> other<00:01:05.460> direction

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
finish by by going the other direction

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.399 
finish by by going the other direction
so<00:01:06.119> it's<00:01:06.240> kind<00:01:06.450> of<00:01:06.540> using<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:06.900> wheel<00:01:07.049> for<00:01:07.260> two

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
so it's kind of using the wheel for two

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.600 
so it's kind of using the wheel for two
different<00:01:07.909> abrasive<00:01:08.909> reason<00:01:10.610> grits

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
different abrasive reason grits

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.460 
different abrasive reason grits
basically<00:01:12.270> so<00:01:12.479> I'll<00:01:12.990> go<00:01:13.110> ahead<00:01:13.140> and<00:01:13.320> turn<00:01:13.439> it

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
basically so I'll go ahead and turn it

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.969 
basically so I'll go ahead and turn it
on<00:01:13.619> here<00:01:14.210> and<00:01:15.210> I've<00:01:15.330> already<00:01:15.650> cleaned<00:01:16.650> it<00:01:16.830> with

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
on here and I've already cleaned it with

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.640 
on here and I've already cleaned it with
the<00:01:17.100> rake<00:01:17.310> here<00:01:17.340> so<00:01:18.000> it's<00:01:18.210> actually<00:01:18.500> ready<00:01:19.500> to

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
the rake here so it's actually ready to

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.680 
the rake here so it's actually ready to
go<00:01:19.860> I'm<00:01:20.400> just<00:01:20.580> going<00:01:20.729> to<00:01:20.759> put<00:01:20.939> a<00:01:20.970> little<00:01:21.150> bit

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:21.690 
go I'm just going to put a little bit

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:25.010 
go I'm just going to put a little bit
on<00:01:22.020> it<00:01:22.170> and<00:01:23.360> I'm<00:01:24.360> going<00:01:24.540> to<00:01:24.570> go<00:01:24.690> ahead<00:01:24.780> and

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
on it and I'm going to go ahead and

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.230 
on it and I'm going to go ahead and
start<00:01:25.320> again<00:01:26.040> I've<00:01:26.190> got<00:01:26.400> gloves

leading edge in it'll bind it up I've

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.400 
leading edge in it'll bind it up I've
got<00:01:35.640> my<00:01:35.790> buffer<00:01:36.210> bolted<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.900> floor<00:01:37.170> and

both<00:04:14.980> sides<00:04:16.380> again<00:04:17.380> I<00:04:17.410> don't<00:04:17.739> want<00:04:17.890> to<00:04:17.950> forget

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
both sides again I don't want to forget

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:23.610 
both sides again I don't want to forget
to<00:04:18.310> do<00:04:18.640> the<00:04:18.820> edges<00:04:19.270> here<00:04:21.900> never<00:04:22.900> ever<00:04:23.290> again

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
to do the edges here never ever again

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.800 
to do the edges here never ever again
put<00:04:23.920> the<00:04:24.040> trim<00:04:24.250> in<00:04:24.430> this<00:04:24.580> way<00:04:24.790> when<00:04:25.540> you<00:04:25.630> do

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
put the trim in this way when you do

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:27.990 
put the trim in this way when you do
have<00:04:25.960> to<00:04:26.020> do<00:04:26.200> corners<00:04:26.740> in<00:04:26.950> this<00:04:27.340> situation

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 
have to do corners in this situation

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.080 
have to do corners in this situation
just<00:04:28.320> do<00:04:29.320> the<00:04:29.470> inside<00:04:29.890> and<00:04:30.250> then<00:04:30.700> flip<00:04:30.940> around

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090 
just do the inside and then flip around

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:33.390 
just do the inside and then flip around
and<00:04:31.570> then<00:04:31.930> do<00:04:32.110> the<00:04:32.230> outside<00:04:32.710> so<00:04:33.100> I'm<00:04:33.190> basically

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 
and then do the outside so I'm basically

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.910 
and then do the outside so I'm basically
polishing<00:04:34.210> like<00:04:34.360> two<00:04:34.570> halves<00:04:34.810> but<00:04:35.380> this<00:04:35.740> is

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:35.920 
polishing like two halves but this is

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:40.740 
polishing like two halves but this is
not<00:04:36.070> a<00:04:36.100> polishing<00:04:37.170> video<00:04:38.170> so<00:04:38.470> again<00:04:39.750> cutting

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750 
not a polishing video so again cutting

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:43.980 
not a polishing video so again cutting
stroke<00:04:41.650> and<00:04:41.940> it's<00:04:42.940> pretty<00:04:43.420> good<00:04:43.600> so<00:04:43.810> what<00:04:43.900> I'm

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 
stroke and it's pretty good so what I'm

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:45.780 
stroke and it's pretty good so what I'm
going<00:04:44.110> to<00:04:44.140> do<00:04:44.260> now<00:04:44.410> is<00:04:44.590> go<00:04:44.770> into<00:04:44.950> a<00:04:45.100> finishing

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:45.790 
going to do now is go into a finishing

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:46.350 
going to do now is go into a finishing
stroke

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
stroke

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.030 
stroke
I<00:04:46.390> just<00:04:46.990> finished<00:04:47.260> every<00:04:47.860> wheel<00:04:48.070> like<00:04:48.310> this

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:50.040 
I just finished every wheel like this

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:53.040 
I just finished every wheel like this
this<00:04:51.040> way<00:04:51.280> I<00:04:51.610> get<00:04:52.090> the<00:04:52.240> cleanest<00:04:52.720> finish

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.050 
this way I get the cleanest finish

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:54.720 
this way I get the cleanest finish
possible<00:04:53.620> so<00:04:53.740> it's<00:04:53.890> like<00:04:54.040> doubling<00:04:54.430> up<00:04:54.580> the

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:54.730 
possible so it's like doubling up the

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:56.640 
possible so it's like doubling up the
effect<00:04:55.030> of<00:04:55.150> the<00:04:55.240> wheel<00:04:55.390> and<00:04:55.600> you<00:04:56.050> can<00:04:56.230> see<00:04:56.470> I've

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:56.650 
effect of the wheel and you can see I've

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:59.400 
effect of the wheel and you can see I've
got<00:04:56.800> a<00:04:56.860> pretty<00:04:57.550> good<00:04:57.880> I<00:04:57.910> mean<00:04:58.060> it<00:04:58.330> says<00:04:58.480> this<00:04:59.260> is

00:04:59.400 --> 00:04:59.410 
got a pretty good I mean it says this is

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:01.440 
got a pretty good I mean it says this is
probably<00:04:59.950> like<00:05:00.100> a<00:05:00.130> mirror<00:05:00.490> already<00:05:00.820> but<00:05:01.300> now

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:01.450 
probably like a mirror already but now

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:03.510 
probably like a mirror already but now
I'm<00:05:01.570> going<00:05:01.720> to<00:05:01.780> go<00:05:01.870> ahead<00:05:01.930> and<00:05:02.170> go<00:05:02.260> to<00:05:02.520> the

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520 
I'm going to go ahead and go to the

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.510 
I'm going to go ahead and go to the
finish<00:05:03.880> here<00:05:04.180> is<00:05:04.470> is<00:05:05.470> the<00:05:05.710> loose<00:05:05.890> wheel<00:05:06.190> and

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:06.520 
finish here is is the loose wheel and

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.880 
finish here is is the loose wheel and
I'm<00:05:07.360> going<00:05:07.570> to<00:05:07.600> use<00:05:07.780> the<00:05:07.930> green<00:05:08.140> compound<00:05:08.740> this

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:08.890 
I'm going to use the green compound this

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:10.830 
I'm going to use the green compound this
green<00:05:09.160> compound<00:05:09.640> is<00:05:09.760> just<00:05:09.970> for<00:05:10.150> stainless<00:05:10.600> so

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:10.840 
green compound is just for stainless so

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:12.420 
green compound is just for stainless so
I'll<00:05:11.260> go<00:05:11.440> ahead<00:05:11.470> and<00:05:11.770> I've<00:05:11.890> already<00:05:12.190> cleaned

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:12.430 
I'll go ahead and I've already cleaned

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:14.430 
I'll go ahead and I've already cleaned
this<00:05:12.610> wheel<00:05:12.910> up<00:05:13.120> I'm<00:05:13.720> just<00:05:13.780> going<00:05:14.110> to<00:05:14.140> go<00:05:14.290> ahead

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:14.440 
this wheel up I'm just going to go ahead

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.980 
this wheel up I'm just going to go ahead
and<00:05:14.590> load<00:05:14.740> it<00:05:14.890> up<00:05:15.010> with<00:05:15.070> some<00:05:15.280> compound<00:05:15.970> and<00:05:16.240> in

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:16.990 
and load it up with some compound and in

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:17.760 
and load it up with some compound and in
this<00:05:17.230> movement

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:17.770 
this movement

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:19.530 
this movement
I<00:05:17.800> do<00:05:17.890> not<00:05:18.130> cut<00:05:18.430> it<00:05:18.550> all<00:05:18.700> it's<00:05:18.970> strictly<00:05:19.420> a

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:19.540 
I do not cut it all it's strictly a

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:20.790 
I do not cut it all it's strictly a
finished<00:05:19.930> movement<00:05:20.260> so<00:05:20.350> the<00:05:20.470> wheel<00:05:20.650> is

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:20.800 
finished movement so the wheel is

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:21.570 
finished movement so the wheel is
spinning<00:05:20.830> this<00:05:21.220> way

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:21.580 
spinning this way

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:24.150 
spinning this way
I'm<00:05:21.730> only<00:05:22.060> going<00:05:22.270> to<00:05:22.360> go<00:05:22.480> this<00:05:22.630> way<00:05:23.160> also

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:24.160 
I'm only going to go this way also

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.280 
I'm only going to go this way also
remember<00:05:24.820> if<00:05:25.360> you<00:05:25.540> you<00:05:25.810> know<00:05:25.930> if<00:05:26.020> your<00:05:26.170> outside

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:26.290 
remember if you you know if your outside

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:28.230 
remember if you you know if your outside
edges<00:05:26.680> shown<00:05:27.100> you<00:05:27.760> want<00:05:27.910> to<00:05:27.970> go<00:05:28.060> ahead<00:05:28.120> and

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:28.240 
edges shown you want to go ahead and

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:45.219 
edges shown you want to go ahead and
polish<00:05:28.510> that<00:05:28.930> and<00:05:30.090> that<00:05:31.090> so

00:05:45.219 --> 00:05:45.229 

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:48.619 

so<00:05:46.229> now<00:05:46.770> you<00:05:46.830> can<00:05:47.099> kind<00:05:47.280> of<00:05:47.370> see<00:05:47.629> that's

00:05:48.619 --> 00:05:48.629 
so now you can kind of see that's

00:05:48.629 --> 00:05:53.689 
so now you can kind of see that's
basically<00:05:49.229> a<00:05:49.910> mere<00:05:50.910> finish<00:05:51.870> on<00:05:52.699> stainless

00:05:53.689 --> 00:05:53.699 
basically a mere finish on stainless

00:05:53.699 --> 00:05:57.350 
basically a mere finish on stainless
that<00:05:53.960> started<00:05:54.960> out<00:05:55.129> looking<00:05:56.129> like<00:05:56.159> this<00:05:56.360> so

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:57.360 
that started out looking like this so

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.670 
that started out looking like this so
hopefully<00:05:57.750> that's<00:05:57.930> a<00:05:58.259> showing<00:05:59.250> up<00:05:59.430> there<00:05:59.699> and

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:00.680 
hopefully that's a showing up there and

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:02.869 
hopefully that's a showing up there and
you<00:06:01.680> can<00:06:01.830> pretty<00:06:02.009> much<00:06:02.099> take<00:06:02.400> any<00:06:02.639> piece<00:06:02.849> of

00:06:02.869 --> 00:06:02.879 
you can pretty much take any piece of

00:06:02.879 --> 00:06:06.499 
you can pretty much take any piece of
stainless<00:06:04.159> bump<00:06:05.159> it<00:06:05.310> out<00:06:05.400> sand<00:06:05.879> it<00:06:06.000> out<00:06:06.090> file

00:06:06.499 --> 00:06:06.509 
stainless bump it out sand it out file

00:06:06.509 --> 00:06:09.050 
stainless bump it out sand it out file
it<00:06:06.720> out<00:06:06.840> and<00:06:07.080> do<00:06:07.620> everything<00:06:08.039> necessary<00:06:08.159> to

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:09.060 
it out and do everything necessary to

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:14.780 
it out and do everything necessary to
save<00:06:09.900> it<00:06:10.940> appreciate<00:06:11.940> watching<00:06:12.210> the<00:06:12.509> video
