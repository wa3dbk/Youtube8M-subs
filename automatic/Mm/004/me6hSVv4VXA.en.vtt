00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.269
 hello this is a technical review from 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.460
 laboratories he and you i'm mikhail 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.839
 lately the number of radar on 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.990
 the territory of Moscow and the Moscow region 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:21.960
 steadily growing and if in the summer of 2012 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.189
 their number was about 200 then the end 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.740
 this year their number will increase 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.970
 about twice and today we 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.380
 let 's talk about devices that 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.560
 will save a couple of thousand rubles 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.420
 this is a radar detector they are capable 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.860
 recognize different radar 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.870
 complexes and warn in advance 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.340
 driver's devices are made to fit 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.920
 technological features of work 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:44.040
 Russian traffic police radar and understand 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.320
 ranges x key kei hey capable 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.270
 recognize laser signals on a 360 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.039
 degrees in Russia use 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.510
 radar detectors are not prohibited but here 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.469
 European countries such restrictions 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.180
 devices exist 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.370
 so before you go to any 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.289
 country check their law and so 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.020
 it is possible and without rights to stay so everything 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.030
 devices have hiv g2 protection 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.000
 which warns the driver of the presence 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.950
 ahead of scanning devices and today 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.810
 on the test we have a model from the company supra 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:15.420
 dfs 66 in 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:18.479
 with protein supra dear with 77 place and 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:21.360
 model from cobra cobra ru 865 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.950
 arrow all three models are Russified and 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.720
 support voice announcement about 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.580
 approaching radar while 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.409
 shows the type of signal strength 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.540
 Accordingly, the signal is more confident than 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.270
 radar closer there is the possibility of adjustment 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.920
 display brightness but it will be convenient in 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.329
 certain time of day at night by day or 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.549
 in the evening can also be adjusted 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.560
 volume and mute sound 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.939
 supra-capable device alerts 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.000
 work in several modes 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.890
 this is the route city 1 and city 2 they change 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.290
 sensor sensitivity range 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.810
 the most sensitive city one misses 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.270
 a small part of the interference city 2 miss 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.219
 most of the interference and interesting to include 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.159
 city mode mode 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:02.189
 paranoid catches everything from radiation from cameras 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:04.670
 up to the sensor in the door in the device from the cobra 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.540
 such modes 2 city ​​and highway 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.489
 supra device 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.190
 This is a middle class radar detector 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.590
 able to recognize 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.630
 a large number of different radar in 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.880
 particulars with the most annoying shooter 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.590
 the cobra also refers to the radar detector 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.390
 premium and beyond ranges 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.930
 who understand supra she is capable 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.270
 recognize 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.100
 European radars are also given 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.230
 radar detector has a safe system 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.910
 android warn driver in advance about 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.530
 approaching vehicles 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.260
 emergency appointment that is 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:36.110
 road service or soon crossing 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.930
 railroad and so on yet he 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:41.660
 understands laser signals lt 2020 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.940
 ultralight pro laser pro leather 3 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.970
 by the way thanks to the spectrum system 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:49.310
 android given radar warns 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:52.000
 driver about the proximity of the radar class 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.560
 spectrum 1 and invisible to other devices 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.320
 how do these devices work we will check 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.780
 in practice , all three radar detectors 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.560
 city ​​mode set 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:05.360
 let's see how they cope with 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:07.190
 detection of the arrow with t and so we 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:10.670
 switched our radar detector to 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:13.610
 track mode and now worked 1 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:18.080
 radar detectors this model from supra 77 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:22.510
 st further triggered cobra show 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.510
 radiation mode 1 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.780
 so first found 77 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:42.240
 now worked almost simultaneously both 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:45.390
 devices this supra 66 is not a model from 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:48.600
 the company cabral all three devices 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:50.070
 worked on the arrow st-1 to the first of 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.230
 of these devices was a model from the company 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:54.620
 supra 77 st 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:57.810
 judging by the testimony of the device in the car 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:59.640
 it was 500 meters later in 100 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.600
 meters that is at a distance of 400 meters 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:04.290
 worked 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:07.730
 the other two devices are 66 from the company 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:09.690
 supra and radar detector from the company Cobra 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:11.970
 so we made sure that the data 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:13.410
 radar detectors understand a lot 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:15.990
 number of modern radar in 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:18.630
 particular arrow arrow st arrow with 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:20.880
 iq arrow m and will be indispensable 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:23.040
 road mates well forewarned 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.930
 so armed with you was the lab 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:27.620
 good luck on the roads and see you soon 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.620
 in our stores
