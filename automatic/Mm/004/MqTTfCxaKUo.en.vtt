can<00:00:19.529> fit<00:00:19.740> in<00:00:19.920> here<00:00:20.189> great<00:00:20.670> depends<00:00:21.000> on<00:00:21.090> exactly

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
can fit in here great depends on exactly

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.730 
can fit in here great depends on exactly
what<00:00:21.600> you're<00:00:21.750> carrying<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.230> size<00:00:22.470> of<00:00:22.619> the

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
what you're carrying the size of the

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.560 
what you're carrying the size of the
tool<00:00:22.949> how<00:00:23.250> many<00:00:23.460> units<00:00:23.760> did<00:00:23.910> you<00:00:24.090> have<00:00:24.240> and<00:00:24.420> so

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
tool how many units did you have and so

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.509 
tool how many units did you have and so
on<00:00:24.720> and<00:00:24.869> so<00:00:25.019> on<00:00:25.050> so<00:00:25.380> these<00:00:25.920> are<00:00:26.099> all<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.340> four

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
on and so on so these are all the four

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.370 
on and so on so these are all the four
versions<00:00:26.970> that<00:00:27.090> we<00:00:27.269> have<00:00:27.689> right<00:00:27.900> now<00:00:27.930> and<00:00:28.320> we

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
versions that we have right now and we

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.460 
versions that we have right now and we
will<00:00:28.560> have<00:00:28.710> more<00:00:29.010> in<00:00:29.640> later<00:00:29.760> stages<00:00:30.230> the<00:00:31.230> first

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
will have more in later stages the first

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.770 
will have more in later stages the first
unit<00:00:31.859> is<00:00:32.070> a<00:00:32.460> what<00:00:32.850> we<00:00:32.880> call<00:00:32.969> a<00:00:33.149> long<00:00:33.360> handle

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
unit is a what we call a long handle

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.510 
unit is a what we call a long handle
unit<00:00:34.079> so<00:00:34.260> this<00:00:34.440> would<00:00:34.649> be<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:34.860> one<00:00:34.980> it<00:00:35.160> will

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
unit so this would be the one it will

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.490 
unit so this would be the one it will
probably<00:00:35.700> take<00:00:35.969> and<00:00:36.239> carry<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:36.960> everything

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
probably take and carry the everything

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.760 
probably take and carry the everything
that<00:00:37.620> is<00:00:37.770> on<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.010> top<00:00:38.219> I<00:00:38.700> got<00:00:38.850> some<00:00:39.030> tools<00:00:39.329> here

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:39.770 
that is on the top I got some tools here

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.459 
that is on the top I got some tools here
it<00:00:40.770> has<00:00:41.010> an<00:00:41.280> organizer<00:00:41.850> top<00:00:42.210> so<00:00:42.960> here<00:00:43.230> and

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
it has an organizer top so here and

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.889 
it has an organizer top so here and
they're<00:00:43.800> all<00:00:43.829> fixed<00:00:44.700> dividers<00:00:45.300> you<00:00:45.329> would<00:00:45.690> put

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
they're all fixed dividers you would put

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.450 
they're all fixed dividers you would put
all<00:00:45.930> sorts<00:00:46.230> of<00:00:46.410> parts<00:00:46.649> and<00:00:46.920> hand<00:00:47.129> tools<00:00:49.460> the

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
all sorts of parts and hand tools the

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.660 
all sorts of parts and hand tools the
unit<00:00:50.730> itself<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.600> interior<00:00:52.020> will<00:00:52.260> have<00:00:52.670> some

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
unit itself the interior will have some

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.520 
unit itself the interior will have some
space<00:00:53.969> and<00:00:54.239> we'll<00:00:54.449> be<00:00:54.539> able<00:00:54.629> to<00:00:54.750> sell<00:00:55.020> like

our tool for example metal latches

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.799 
our tool for example metal latches
really<00:01:02.399> really<00:01:02.850> important<00:01:03.239> when<00:01:03.329> you<00:01:03.449> have<00:01:03.780> a

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
simple thing but we've never done it

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:21.350 
simple thing but we've never done it
before

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
before

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.210 
before
all<00:01:21.960> of<00:01:22.110> them<00:01:22.200> have<00:01:22.350> ball<00:01:22.590> bearing<00:01:22.890> slides

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
all of them have ball bearing slides

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.590 
all of them have ball bearing slides
they're<00:01:23.490> really<00:01:23.700> heavy-duty<00:01:24.000> and<00:01:24.479> they're

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
they're really heavy-duty and they're

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.570 
they're really heavy-duty and they're

handles<00:01:30.360> are<00:01:30.479> by<00:01:30.630> materials<00:01:31.170> so<00:01:31.320> there<00:01:31.470> is<00:01:31.590> a

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
handles are by materials so there is a

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.100 
handles are by materials so there is a
foam<00:01:32.430> grip<00:01:32.729> a<00:01:32.880> rubber<00:01:33.240> grip<00:01:33.479> on<00:01:33.659> top<00:01:33.810> of<00:01:33.960> it

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
foam grip a rubber grip on top of it

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.080 
foam grip a rubber grip on top of it
making<00:01:34.829> it<00:01:35.009> a<00:01:35.100> lot<00:01:35.220> more<00:01:35.400> convenient<00:01:35.729> when<00:01:35.970> you

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
making it a lot more convenient when you

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.600 
making it a lot more convenient when you
have<00:01:36.210> a<00:01:36.240> lot<00:01:36.420> of<00:01:36.450> great<00:01:36.780> inside<00:01:37.460> pretty<00:01:38.460> much

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
have a lot of great inside pretty much

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.429 
have a lot of great inside pretty much
the<00:01:38.729> most<00:01:38.880> basic<00:01:39.329> one<00:01:39.540> it<00:01:39.720> can<00:01:39.900> make<00:01:40.079> can<00:01:40.320> be<00:01:40.350> a

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
the most basic one it can make can be a

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:41.780 
the most basic one it can make can be a
replacement<00:01:40.680> for<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.070> regular<00:01:41.369> blow<00:01:41.549> mold

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
replacement for the regular blow mold
