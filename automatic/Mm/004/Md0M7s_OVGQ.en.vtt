the<00:01:23.700> edge<00:01:23.880> of<00:01:23.909> your<00:01:24.150> wrist<00:01:24.450> is<00:01:24.600> another<00:01:24.869> great

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
the edge of your wrist is another great

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.630 
the edge of your wrist is another great
cooling<00:01:25.439> spot<00:01:25.680> where<00:01:25.860> you<00:01:25.920> put<00:01:26.070> ice<00:01:26.220> as<00:01:26.430> well

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
cooling spot where you put ice as well

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.070 
cooling spot where you put ice as well
as<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:26.880> top<00:01:27.090> of<00:01:27.210> your<00:01:27.270> head<00:01:27.330> so<00:01:27.780> these<00:01:27.930> are

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
as the top of your head so these are

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.140 
as the top of your head so these are
some<00:01:28.110> of<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.350> areas<00:01:28.409> your<00:01:28.890> body<00:01:29.070> when<00:01:29.880> it's<00:01:30.030> a

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
some of the areas your body when it's a

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.690 
some of the areas your body when it's a
touching<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.290> ice<00:01:31.439> in<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.740> cold<00:01:31.979> it<00:01:32.369> does

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
touching the ice in the cold it does

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.120 
touching the ice in the cold it does
cool<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:33.540> bring<00:01:33.750> down<00:01:33.930> help<00:01:34.439> manage<00:01:34.829> any<00:01:35.009> way

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
cool and bring down help manage any way

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.679 
cool and bring down help manage any way
that<00:01:35.280> that<00:01:35.549> core<00:01:35.850> body<00:01:36.000> temperature<00:01:36.509> so<00:01:36.659> that

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
that that core body temperature so that

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.030 
that that core body temperature so that
was<00:01:36.869> a<00:01:36.900> clever<00:01:37.079> move<00:01:37.350> on<00:01:37.500> Rennie's<00:01:37.770> part

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
was a clever move on Rennie's part

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.880 
was a clever move on Rennie's part
dumping<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.790> ice<00:01:38.880> in<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.150> shorts<00:01:39.680> yeah<00:01:40.680> that

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
dumping the ice in the shorts yeah that

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.380 
dumping the ice in the shorts yeah that
is<00:01:41.009> using<00:01:41.310> a<00:01:41.400> beauty<00:01:41.640> yeah<00:01:41.880> you<00:01:41.939> have<00:01:42.150> to<00:01:42.270> have

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
is using a beauty yeah you have to have

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.149 
is using a beauty yeah you have to have
a<00:01:42.420> plan<00:01:42.630> on<00:01:42.930> how<00:01:42.960> to<00:01:43.079> cool<00:01:43.380> yourself<00:01:43.470> down<00:01:43.770> you

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
a plan on how to cool yourself down you

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.560 
a plan on how to cool yourself down you
know<00:01:44.250> smaller<00:01:44.549> athletes<00:01:45.000> probably<00:01:45.390> don't

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
know smaller athletes probably don't

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.120 
know smaller athletes probably don't
heat<00:01:45.780> up<00:01:45.810> quite<00:01:46.110> as<00:01:46.229> much<00:01:46.350> as<00:01:46.409> bigger<00:01:46.710> athletes

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
heat up quite as much as bigger athletes

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.069 
heat up quite as much as bigger athletes
but<00:01:47.310> you<00:01:47.880> definitely<00:01:48.090> have<00:01:48.360> to<00:01:48.390> make<00:01:48.689> sure<00:01:48.720> you

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
but you definitely have to make sure you

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.960 
but you definitely have to make sure you
cool<00:01:49.649> yourself<00:01:49.740> down<00:01:50.009> as<00:01:50.280> you<00:01:50.399> go<00:01:50.549> with<00:01:50.790> her

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
cool yourself down as you go with her

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.030 
cool yourself down as you go with her
it's<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.689> ice<00:01:51.869> but<00:01:52.170> yeah<00:01:52.350> I<00:01:52.380> got<00:01:52.560> Greg<00:01:52.860> is

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
it's the ice but yeah I got Greg is

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.080 
it's the ice but yeah I got Greg is
pointing<00:01:53.369> out<00:01:53.460> right<00:01:53.640> now<00:01:53.759> on<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:53.970> screen

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
pointing out right now on the screen

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.030 
pointing out right now on the screen
that<00:01:54.420> Frederick<00:01:55.170> family<00:01:55.470> does<00:01:55.770> look<00:01:55.920> like

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
that Frederick family does look like

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.350 
that Frederick family does look like
he's<00:01:56.219> tightening<00:01:56.520> up<00:01:56.700> a<00:01:56.790> little<00:01:56.969> bit<00:01:57.119> it<00:01:57.210> looks

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
he's tightening up a little bit it looks

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.209 
he's tightening up a little bit it looks
like<00:01:57.540> it's<00:01:57.750> trying<00:01:57.990> to<00:01:58.170> sufficiently<00:01:58.979> and

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
like it's trying to sufficiently and

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.980 
like it's trying to sufficiently and
he's<00:01:59.340> certainly<00:01:59.700> tying<00:02:00.240> up<00:02:00.450> a<00:02:00.570> little<00:02:00.780> bit<00:02:00.899> you

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
he's certainly tying up a little bit you

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.959 
he's certainly tying up a little bit you
can<00:02:01.110> see<00:02:01.170> that<00:02:01.500> his<00:02:01.619> stride<00:02:01.920> length<00:02:02.189> is<00:02:02.369> really

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
can see that his stride length is really

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.249 
can see that his stride length is really
short<00:02:03.180> and<00:02:03.329> I<00:02:03.450> think<00:02:03.659> he's<00:02:03.750> in<00:02:03.869> a<00:02:03.960> spot<00:02:04.229> of

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
short and I think he's in a spot of

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.740 
short and I think he's in a spot of
trouble<00:02:04.380> at<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:04.860> moment<00:02:05.219> Luke<00:02:05.759> Mackenzie

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
trouble at the moment Luke Mackenzie

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.590 
trouble at the moment Luke Mackenzie
was<00:02:06.900> nope<00:02:07.140> i'm<00:02:07.350> a<00:02:07.530> 34<00:02:08.130> seconds<00:02:08.640> down<00:02:08.789> of<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.090> 22

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
was nope i'm a 34 seconds down of the 22

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.960 
was nope i'm a 34 seconds down of the 22
mile<00:02:09.869> mark<00:02:10.140> so<00:02:10.289> with<00:02:10.440> four<00:02:10.649> miles<00:02:10.890> to<00:02:11.130> go<00:02:11.310> Luke

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
mile mark so with four miles to go Luke

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.700 
mile mark so with four miles to go Luke
McKenzie<00:02:12.450> still<00:02:12.690> hanging<00:02:13.050> in<00:02:13.140> there<00:02:13.200> and<00:02:13.560> as

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
McKenzie still hanging in there and as

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.040 
McKenzie still hanging in there and as
Freddy<00:02:13.980> comes<00:02:14.250> back<00:02:14.520> in<00:02:14.730> this<00:02:15.180> is<00:02:15.360> a<00:02:15.390> two-lane

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
Freddy comes back in this is a two-lane

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.990 
Freddy comes back in this is a two-lane
highway<00:02:16.590> like<00:02:16.800> two<00:02:17.040> lanes<00:02:17.250> either<00:02:17.520> way<00:02:17.790> out

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
highway like two lanes either way out

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.970 
highway like two lanes either way out
here<00:02:18.240> on<00:02:18.330> the<00:02:18.420> queen<00:02:18.660> kay<00:02:18.900> once<00:02:19.470> we<00:02:19.680> get<00:02:19.800> to<00:02:19.860> the

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
here on the queen kay once we get to the

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.710 
here on the queen kay once we get to the
top<00:02:20.220> of<00:02:20.250> this<00:02:20.460> hill<00:02:20.760> we've<00:02:21.150> got<00:02:21.330> a<00:02:21.360> little<00:02:21.600> bit

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
top of this hill we've got a little bit

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.630 
top of this hill we've got a little bit
of<00:02:21.840> a<00:02:21.930> downhill<00:02:22.140> section<00:02:22.680> to<00:02:22.800> McAuliffe<00:02:23.100> elbow

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
of a downhill section to McAuliffe elbow

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.400 
of a downhill section to McAuliffe elbow
but<00:02:23.880> after<00:02:24.150> McCullough<00:02:24.540> you're<00:02:25.140> going<00:02:25.260> to<00:02:25.320> go

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
but after McCullough you're going to go

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.470 
but after McCullough you're going to go
back<00:02:25.590> up<00:02:25.620> into<00:02:25.980> town<00:02:26.280> then<00:02:26.730> down<00:02:27.030> below<00:02:27.180> knee

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
back up into town then down below knee

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.320 
back up into town then down below knee
and<00:02:27.990> so<00:02:28.200> it's<00:02:28.500> a<00:02:28.709> really<00:02:29.130> grueling<00:02:29.610> last<00:02:30.030> two

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
and so it's a really grueling last two

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.090 
and so it's a really grueling last two
miles<00:02:30.600> of<00:02:30.900> this<00:02:31.050> course<00:02:31.320> you<00:02:31.470> got<00:02:31.620> up<00:02:31.740> and<00:02:31.920> down

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
miles of this course you got up and down

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:33.890 
miles of this course you got up and down
all<00:02:32.130> over<00:02:32.310> the<00:02:32.610> place<00:02:32.790> and<00:02:33.030> by<00:02:33.420> the<00:02:33.450> look<00:02:33.750> of<00:02:33.810> it

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
all over the place and by the look of it

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.960 
all over the place and by the look of it
right<00:02:34.080> now<00:02:34.260> I<00:02:34.320> think<00:02:34.440> Freddy<00:02:34.890> strike<00:02:35.400> has

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
right now I think Freddy strike has

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.850 
right now I think Freddy strike has
certainly<00:02:36.450> shortened<00:02:37.020> a<00:02:37.080> little<00:02:37.320> bit<00:02:37.500> he's

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
certainly shortened a little bit he's

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.670 
certainly shortened a little bit he's
got<00:02:38.040> enough<00:02:38.310> time<00:02:38.550> I<00:02:38.580> do<00:02:38.820> believe<00:02:39.270> but<00:02:39.510> he's

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
got enough time I do believe but he's

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.590 
got enough time I do believe but he's
134<00:02:40.680> seconds<00:02:41.130> in<00:02:41.489> front<00:02:41.730> of<00:02:41.880> Luke<00:02:42.060> McKenzie

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
134 seconds in front of Luke McKenzie

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.300 
134 seconds in front of Luke McKenzie
but<00:02:42.989> the<00:02:43.110> fastest<00:02:43.530> run<00:02:43.709> around<00:02:43.950> on<00:02:44.040> course

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
but the fastest run around on course

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.990 
but the fastest run around on course
right<00:02:44.520> now<00:02:44.730> is<00:02:45.530> mirinda<00:02:46.530> carfrae<00:02:47.000> absolutely

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
right now is mirinda carfrae absolutely
