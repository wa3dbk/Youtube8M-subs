00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
the tree looks almost untouched so check

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.310 
the tree looks almost untouched so check
this<00:00:42.120> out<00:00:42.300> cuz<00:00:42.450> I<00:00:42.540> don't<00:00:42.690> think<00:00:42.840> it's<00:00:42.930> been<00:00:43.050> fed

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
this out cuz I don't think it's been fed

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.510 
this out cuz I don't think it's been fed
on<00:00:43.469> it<00:00:43.649> this<00:00:44.070> could<00:00:44.309> be<00:00:44.489> exactly<00:00:45.360> what<00:00:45.809> I<00:00:45.840> need

got on this the birds have been on it
which<00:00:53.030> that's<00:00:54.030> what<00:00:54.329> drew<00:00:54.570> us<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:54.989> it<00:00:56.180> we've

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
which that's what drew us to it we've

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.790 
which that's what drew us to it we've
got<00:00:58.609> serious<00:00:59.609> bites<00:01:00.300> on<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.750> neck<00:01:01.020> and<00:01:01.289> head

got serious bites on the neck and head
but<00:01:02.760> audibly<00:01:03.149> obviously<00:01:03.809> not<00:01:04.019> enough<00:01:04.320> to<00:01:04.470> put

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
but audibly obviously not enough to put

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.100 
but audibly obviously not enough to put
it<00:01:04.769> down<00:01:04.920> right<00:01:04.979> away

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110 
it down right away

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.530 
it down right away
so<00:01:07.110> this<00:01:07.290> is<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.770> coolest<00:01:08.490> wolf<00:01:08.850> kill<00:01:09.180> I<00:01:09.420> have
