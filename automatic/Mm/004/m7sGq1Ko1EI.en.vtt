a short video on barefoot running today

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.450 
a short video on barefoot running today
so<00:00:09.030> I<00:00:09.059> thought<00:00:09.630> that<00:00:10.080> we<00:00:10.380> could<00:00:10.559> touch<00:00:10.769> on<00:00:11.040> the

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
so I thought that we could touch on the

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.509 
so I thought that we could touch on the
biggest<00:00:11.670> Pro<00:00:12.000> and<00:00:12.300> the<00:00:12.389> biggest<00:00:12.690> cons<00:00:12.929> of

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:13.519 
biggest Pro and the biggest cons of

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:17.000 
biggest Pro and the biggest cons of
barefoot<00:00:14.519> running<00:00:14.839> so<00:00:15.839> the<00:00:16.260> biggest<00:00:16.440> benefit

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
barefoot running so the biggest benefit

barefoot running so the biggest benefit
of<00:00:17.039> barefoot<00:00:17.340> running<00:00:17.520> otherwise<00:00:18.000> why<00:00:18.359> you

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779

strike and the force impact of that that

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.330 
strike and the force impact of that that
it<00:00:50.850> really<00:00:51.059> held<00:00:51.449> them<00:00:51.660> back<00:00:51.690> from<00:00:52.260> running<00:00:53.219> to

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
it really held them back from running to

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.529 
it really held them back from running to
their<00:00:53.460> true<00:00:53.640> potential<00:00:53.969> in<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.239> way<00:00:54.360> that

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
their true potential in the way that

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.319 
their true potential in the way that
they<00:00:54.629> wanted<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.110> so<00:00:55.980> barefoot<00:00:56.640> running<00:00:56.910> has<00:00:57.300> a

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
they wanted to so barefoot running has a

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.450 
they wanted to so barefoot running has a
completely<00:00:57.930> different<00:00:58.079> stride<00:00:59.070> which<00:00:59.340> is

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
completely different stride which is

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.889 
completely different stride which is
similar<00:00:59.820> to<00:00:59.850> a<00:01:00.469> chi<00:01:01.469> running<00:01:01.829> stride<00:01:02.899> except

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
similar to a chi running stride except

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.179 
similar to a chi running stride except
it's<00:01:04.110> a<00:01:04.199> form<00:01:04.500> that<00:01:04.559> you<00:01:04.680> can<00:01:04.860> acquire

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
it's a form that you can acquire

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.060 
it's a form that you can acquire
naturally<00:01:05.880> just<00:01:06.510> by<00:01:06.780> being<00:01:07.049> barefoot<00:01:07.590> your

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
naturally just by being barefoot your

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.820 
naturally just by being barefoot your
body<00:01:08.330> aligns<00:01:09.330> itself<00:01:09.659> and<00:01:10.049> it<00:01:10.140> finds<00:01:10.470> this

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
body aligns itself and it finds this

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.789 
body aligns itself and it finds this
form<00:01:11.330> naturally<00:01:12.330> and<00:01:13.200> of<00:01:13.320> course<00:01:13.560> there's<00:01:13.770> a

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
form naturally and of course there's a

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.380 
form naturally and of course there's a
couple<00:01:14.130> simple<00:01:14.310> pointers<00:01:14.880> that<00:01:14.909> kind<00:01:15.299> of

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
couple simple pointers that kind of

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.090 
couple simple pointers that kind of
eliminate<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:15.869> lot<00:01:16.170> of<00:01:16.350> pain<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:16.740> mistakes

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
eliminate a lot of pain and mistakes

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.160 
eliminate a lot of pain and mistakes
right<00:01:17.340> away<00:01:17.610> like<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.360> mid<00:01:18.570> foot<00:01:18.720> landing

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
right away like the mid foot landing

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.380 
right away like the mid foot landing
keeping<00:01:19.830> your<00:01:19.950> landing<00:01:20.369> straight<00:01:20.700> and<00:01:20.970> and

keeping your landing straight and and
vertical<00:01:22.310> and<00:01:23.310> then<00:01:23.400> also<00:01:23.610> shortening<00:01:24.479> your

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
vertical and then also shortening your

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.679 
vertical and then also shortening your
stride<00:01:25.020> and<00:01:25.770> you<00:01:25.920> find<00:01:26.159> this<00:01:26.310> natural<00:01:26.880> human

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
stride and you find this natural human

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.870 
stride and you find this natural human
running<00:01:28.080> form<00:01:28.409> and<00:01:28.799> it's<00:01:29.040> very<00:01:29.280> easy<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:29.610> find

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
running form and it's very easy to find

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.020 
running form and it's very easy to find
when<00:01:30.210> you're<00:01:30.509> barefoot<00:01:30.689> and<00:01:31.140> it<00:01:32.100> takes<00:01:32.820> care

going hand gliding you know there's

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.509 
going hand gliding you know there's
bound<00:03:08.160> to<00:03:08.250> be<00:03:08.340> a<00:03:08.700> higher<00:03:09.030> injury<00:03:09.660> rate<00:03:09.959> or<00:03:10.890> more

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
bound to be a higher injury rate or more

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:14.030 
bound to be a higher injury rate or more
injuries<00:03:12.090> because<00:03:12.450> more<00:03:12.780> people<00:03:13.170> are<00:03:13.530> doing

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
injuries because more people are doing

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.849 
injuries because more people are doing
and<00:03:14.340> it's<00:03:14.459> growing<00:03:14.670> in<00:03:14.910> trend<00:03:15.120> in<00:03:15.209> popularity

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:15.859 
and it's growing in trend in popularity

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:19.309 
and it's growing in trend in popularity
but<00:03:16.859> at<00:03:16.980> the<00:03:17.100> same<00:03:17.280> time<00:03:17.690> injuries<00:03:18.690> can<00:03:19.079> be

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:19.319 
but at the same time injuries can be

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:21.620 
but at the same time injuries can be
avoided<00:03:19.620> just<00:03:20.400> by<00:03:20.519> doing<00:03:20.819> a<00:03:20.910> little<00:03:21.239> bit<00:03:21.540> of

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
avoided just by doing a little bit of

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.920 
avoided just by doing a little bit of
research<00:03:22.019> before<00:03:22.350> you<00:03:22.829> go<00:03:23.040> out<00:03:23.250> and<00:03:24.000> the

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
research before you go out and the

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.050 
research before you go out and the
biggest<00:03:25.290> I<00:03:25.530> think<00:03:26.069> the<00:03:26.190> biggest<00:03:26.459> reason<00:03:26.670> that

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
biggest I think the biggest reason that

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.400 
biggest I think the biggest reason that
people<00:03:27.269> are<00:03:27.420> getting<00:03:27.690> injured<00:03:27.840> is<00:03:28.139> because

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
people are getting injured is because

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.229 
people are getting injured is because
you<00:03:28.650> with<00:03:29.160> shoes<00:03:29.549> and<00:03:29.579> things<00:03:30.060> like<00:03:30.180> that

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
you with shoes and things like that

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:33.319 
you with shoes and things like that
you've<00:03:30.569> really<00:03:31.230> lost<00:03:32.190> the<00:03:32.489> ability<00:03:32.910> to<00:03:32.940> get

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:33.329 
you've really lost the ability to get

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:36.410 
you've really lost the ability to get
that<00:03:34.049> ground<00:03:34.500> feedback<00:03:35.190> and<00:03:35.519> you're<00:03:35.849> not<00:03:36.000> used

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
that ground feedback and you're not used

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:37.970 
that ground feedback and you're not used
to<00:03:36.540> getting<00:03:36.720> it<00:03:37.019> and<00:03:37.170> adjusting<00:03:37.650> your<00:03:37.680> body

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980

really you really push yourself to do
