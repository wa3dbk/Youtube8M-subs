00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:13.889
 the loan and welcome to 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.650
 new conti the black ops gameplay is coming 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.750
 yes, as I have said, come today 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.300
 another black ops gameplay 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.300
 commentary and again it's about black 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.070
 ops 2 but today what something really 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.019
 has been confirmed and what you guys 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.929
 will most likely interest you 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.520
 like the edition in black ops 2 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.850
 So the prestige will look like 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.700
 edition the downloadable extremely tables 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.200
 and the hardened edition in the background 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.280
 Do you have a change? 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.379
 gameplay of mine 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.989
 it's a team deathmatch gameplay on 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.969
 the map radiation you see my now 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.160
 class is now my question 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.020
 I wanted it from now on 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.920
 always just my class such a dazzling 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.680
 incidentally mention 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.210
 or should I really list with what 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.390
 I played that is what I do 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:03.059
 now you do not watch in the gameplay 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.030
 the red- hot man is the called the farmer 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.189
 with the red camouflage as well I have 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.580
 take the muffler with me 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:14.509
 Secondary, the cz 75 was fully automatic 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:17.009
 So with the fully automatic upgrade 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:19.259
 I also had it as a box 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.390
 nimble pro ghost pro and hacker pro 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.040
 my equipment was the 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.650
 motion detector the shake 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.780
 grenades and the semtex map and man 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.880
 the killstreaks on the eight of 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.240
 blackbird on the new the chopper 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.850
 ghana and on the 11 the whole combo now 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.189
 but to the theme of the gameplay and that 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.579
 I have for you as I said the edition 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.750
 listed from black ops 2 today 

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:44.009
 First of all, of course, the normal one 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.600
 standard version already 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.040
 can preorder for the whole 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.659
 preorder so there's already 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.340
 an extra if you do not play the game 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.990
 right to the shop buys it but you 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:56.399
 already preordered gets the 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:59.460
 exclusive map newtown 2025 in addition so 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:01.680
 sober in 2025 just a little bit of new 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.530
 town from black ops 1 so a very 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:08.190
 cool thing this edition is available now 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:11.039
 currently for the pc for 54 eur 50 and 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.810
 for ps3 and xbox for 69 euro 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.530
 I only restrain myself today 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.840
 these three would be 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.280
 So now for pc ps3 and xbox since me 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.620
 no information about the Jewish 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.880
 found if I find something but 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.800
 I'll go over it again a video 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.390
 do separately but the extra 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.970
 characterizing that they know exactly 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.050
 know that it is about the Jewish yes 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.930
 then of course there are those 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.670
 Havellan and the prestige edition 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.950
 first to have edition the hardened 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.239
 edition is just a steelbook me 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.959
 Hope you know that a steelbook is 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:42.060
 So a metallic book or something 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:45.030
 metal case in such a simple way with 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.920
 black ops 2 design so the front is then 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.930
 what about multiple find what they are 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.519
 when zombie part on it actually looks 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.150
 very funny but does not bring 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:54.060
 much more 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:56.130
 it costs ten euros more than the ps3 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.630
 xbox version and I have not 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.550
 found out if so what we the pc 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.769
 give version I will not think that 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.450
 also a digital deluxe edition 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:05.790
 but will be more on that later 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.760
 yes, the Indian ones are there 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:11.130
 including, of course, newtown 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:13.860
 2025 next to black ops 2 in exclusive 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:16.230
 steelbook so really saturday as well 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.690
 still the map newtown zombies so one 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:21.239
 Zombie ethical of new dawn from black 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:24.239
 ops 1 then the soundtrack of black 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:26.459
 ops 2 made by jeff wall 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:28.350
 is also still limited 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:30.630
 challenge munich just like that 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:34.440
 Metallic coins where on the outside edge 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:36.209
 the codes neutron 2025 union zombies 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.549
 are imprinted so that you are the 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:40.769
 also in psn and xbox download there 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:42.720
 can also player card 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:44.880
 backgrounds a player card is know 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.140
 the people from black ops 1 still can 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.700
 I do not really explain that now 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.769
 is just what you see when 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:52.109
 someone is killed so if you 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:54.690
 kills someone and he then looks in the 

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:56.790
 then down your player card 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:59.280
 yes, there are also extra 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.810
 armory so guns camouflage me 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.730
 Hope they do what's cool out because 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.280
 so special is not synonymous for pc 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.840
 especially because they can do that too 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.970
 That's why I think I exist 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.840
 not even for the pc version of this 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.359
 hardened edition 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:15.180
 Also, there is the stealing avatar so 

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:17.970
 a klo avatar and a zombie costume for 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.350
 xbox live what is exactly i can 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.659
 I do not say that unfortunately no xbox 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:23.580
 that's for the ps3 instead 

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:25.470
 I'm not sure why 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.000
 nothing at all in the prestige edition 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.370
 for a total of 100 euros 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.200
 everything is the same except this one 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:33.450
 Chlorine water and the zombie costume for 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.580
 xbox live is in the prestige 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:39.360
 edition multiplayer and zombie themes 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:42.390
 for playstation3 so very cool for psn 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:44.460
 thing but why costs 100 euros more 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:47.280
 I can do that to you, there is not 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:49.110
 a mq 27 dragon fire drone with 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.340
 remote control so really such a 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:53.070
 drone from the trailer maybe 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:54.870
 I have to control myself in the 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:56.550
 there was a black ops 1 prestige edition 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:58.470
 at that time an abuser so one 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.240
 extension so it really is one 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:01.440
 cool thing was that it can fly 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:04.440
 make it a bit cooler then 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.910
 such a normal vehicle yes there 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.950
 but still the digital deluxe 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:09.900
 edition this namely only for the pc and 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:11.040
 currently for 70 euros at steam 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.870
 preorder 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:14.190
 what is going to happen there 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:17.880
 the same as in others 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:20.250
 so newtown zombies users 2025 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:23.070
 armory so exclusive multiplayer 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:25.740
 weapon skins then two player card 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:28.740
 backgrounds and black ops 2 soundtrack 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:30.990
 what makes it more expensive then what 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:32.880
 the replacement is for the ps3 xbox 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:34.890
 players get a steelbook and the 

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:37.470

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:56.400

 2 1 1 There is also a zombie there 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.820
 Mode of this game is the only one 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.710

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:03.270

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:04.260

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:06.330

 there is also armor action so there is 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:09.990
 there are also vehicle fights with 

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:11.700
 armor what is very cool it is 

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:13.470
 namely the only call of duty where did 

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:16.410
 it multipliers moderately to such 

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:18.870
 controlling vehicles is yes that was it 

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:20.430
