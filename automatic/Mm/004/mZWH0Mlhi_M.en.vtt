00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:34.790 
could take an hour before training they

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.520 
could take an hour before training they
can<00:00:34.820> like<00:00:35.239> a<00:00:35.750> cup<00:00:36.469> of<00:00:36.500> oatmeal<00:00:38.199> seven<00:00:39.199> ounces

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:03.620 
know you got energy ready to go your

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.370 
know you got energy ready to go your
body<00:01:03.859> rate<00:01:04.070> adjusted<00:01:04.640> the<00:01:05.239> food<00:01:05.479> and<00:01:05.780> it<00:01:06.229> will

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
body rate adjusted the food and it will

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.100 
body rate adjusted the food and it will
be<00:01:06.530> digestion<00:01:07.510> adjusting<00:01:08.510> the<00:01:08.630> food<00:01:08.810> while

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
be digestion adjusting the food while

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.260 
be digestion adjusting the food while
you're<00:01:09.229> training<00:01:09.500> ok<00:01:10.250> so<00:01:10.549> it<00:01:10.700> won't<00:01:10.880> be<00:01:11.000> using

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
you're training ok so it won't be using

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.749 
you're training ok so it won't be using
the<00:01:11.360> energy<00:01:11.750> to<00:01:11.869> adjust<00:01:12.200> the<00:01:12.290> food<00:01:12.640> but<00:01:13.640> it

00:01:13.749 --> 00:01:13.759 
the energy to adjust the food but it

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:18.340 
the energy to adjust the food but it
will<00:01:13.820> give<00:01:14.000> you<00:01:14.090> the<00:01:14.180> energy<00:01:14.360> to<00:01:16.270> lift<00:01:17.270> so<00:01:17.960> it's

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
will give you the energy to lift so it's

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.350 
will give you the energy to lift so it's
all<00:01:18.530> different<00:01:18.710> guys<00:01:19.100> figure<00:01:19.880> out<00:01:20.030> for

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
all different guys figure out for

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.350 
all different guys figure out for
yourself<00:01:20.890> and<00:01:21.890> by<00:01:22.189> trial<00:01:22.520> and<00:01:22.579> error<00:01:22.670> I<00:01:23.000> had<00:01:23.240> to

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
yourself and by trial and error I had to

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.630 
yourself and by trial and error I had to
do<00:01:23.509> it<00:01:23.659> everybody<00:01:24.469> that<00:01:24.740> you<00:01:24.890> know<00:01:24.950> really

do it everybody that you know really

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.219 
do it everybody that you know really
serious<00:01:25.969> into<00:01:26.149> fitness<00:01:26.390> and<00:01:26.780> once<00:01:27.049> you<00:01:27.170> get

serious into fitness and once you get
the<00:01:27.350> best<00:01:27.530> results<00:01:28.009> have<00:01:28.520> to<00:01:28.549> do<00:01:28.729> it's<00:01:28.909> trial

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
the best results have to do it's trial

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.679 
the best results have to do it's trial
and<00:01:29.329> error

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:29.689 
and error

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:32.550 
and error
it's<00:01:29.930> see<00:01:30.500> what<00:01:30.710> works<00:01:31.130> the<00:01:31.310> best<00:01:31.549> for<00:01:31.850> you<00:01:32.090> I

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
hours before going to train and you'll

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:41.020 
hours before going to train and you'll
be<00:01:38.570> fine<00:01:38.890> no<00:01:39.890> sometimes<00:01:40.520> you<00:01:40.579> need<00:01:40.729> three

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
be fine no sometimes you need three

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.480 
be fine no sometimes you need three
hours<00:01:41.390> sometimes<00:01:41.570> an<00:01:41.899> hour<00:01:42.109> is<00:01:42.380> fine<00:01:42.619> and<00:01:42.950> if

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
hours sometimes an hour is fine and if

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:44.950 
hours sometimes an hour is fine and if
for<00:01:43.609> example<00:01:43.640> if<00:01:43.939> you<00:01:44.000> do<00:01:44.149> a<00:01:44.180> shake<00:01:44.570> if<00:01:44.810> you<00:01:44.869> do

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
for example if you do a shake if you do

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.410 
for example if you do a shake if you do
two<00:01:45.740> scoops<00:01:45.979> of<00:01:46.130> protein<00:01:46.250> mixed<00:01:46.909> with<00:01:47.090> like

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
two scoops of protein mixed with like

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.859 
two scoops of protein mixed with like
dextrose<00:01:48.109> or<00:01:48.460> oatmeal<00:01:49.460> your<00:01:50.359> body<00:01:50.570> will<00:01:50.719> die

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869 
dextrose or oatmeal your body will die

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:53.319 
dextrose or oatmeal your body will die
just<00:01:51.140> have<00:01:51.350> much<00:01:51.770> faster<00:01:52.219> if<00:01:52.310> you<00:01:52.399> eat<00:01:52.609> a<00:01:52.820> solid

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:53.329 
just have much faster if you eat a solid

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:56.740 
just have much faster if you eat a solid
food<00:01:53.539> for<00:01:53.570> the<00:01:53.810> point<00:01:54.049> beef<00:01:54.259> chicken<00:01:54.979> or<00:01:55.850> any

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
food for the point beef chicken or any

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.990 
food for the point beef chicken or any
kinds<00:01:57.079> of<00:01:57.109> meats<00:01:57.380> and<00:01:57.649> then<00:01:57.890> like<00:01:58.250> brown<00:01:58.729> rice

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
kinds of meats and then like brown rice

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.109 
kinds of meats and then like brown rice
so<00:01:59.630> also<00:01:59.840> depends<00:02:00.170> on<00:02:00.229> quality<00:02:00.380> of<00:02:00.679> the<00:02:00.740> food

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:01.119 
so also depends on quality of the food

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:04.989 
so also depends on quality of the food
depends<00:02:02.119> on<00:02:02.240> the<00:02:02.390> person<00:02:02.840> you<00:02:02.990> are<00:02:03.759> how<00:02:04.759> fast

00:02:04.989 --> 00:02:04.999 
depends on the person you are how fast

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:06.669 
depends on the person you are how fast
