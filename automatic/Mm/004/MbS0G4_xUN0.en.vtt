00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:06.180
 to this exhibition that since they have no hand yes yes 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:08.309
 you were talking 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.019
 6 yes we were this week as long as I wanted to do a magic trick 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.230
 we were practicing rehearsing 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.909
 i do not know the work he did at home I do not know if it would be good 

00:00:19.909 --> 00:00:23.379
 but I'm not going to talk about jobs now although jajajajaja josé alfonso 

00:00:23.379 --> 00:00:25.449
 grau up to see it 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:29.260
 I'm not going to make it hard we're going to mix well well well the cards 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:33.179
 are affiliated with the closing cmic with the certainty of the letters of your pc 

00:00:33.179 --> 00:00:37.199
 and the mixes of two metro calves and I mixed them again now 

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:39.460
 let's catch we were going to do 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.410
 one more cut so that everything is well lost and sergio told me 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.440
 here I am capable 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.440
 to cut by the four aces of the deck 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:54.920
 yourself then it was like a skeleton the other day you still notice strings 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.600
 since then 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.980
 as you have to cut in half more or less control by half more or 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.640
 less well so I'm so sure it's going to come out now he takes it off so the 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.160
 goal to win 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.000
 is that they crave a water tank so much 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.170
 four hits 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.170
 as you see four cuts in different places American works many what 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:15.260
 more low 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:16.500
 opi 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.510
 and there are four cards on the table 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:22.490
 yes 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:23.790
 we are all 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.600
 the four letters above yes 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.160
 described the tube 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.160
 this trend moons this trend other this after their dispute is not true 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.049
 prices 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:38.049
 here we go 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:43.580
 sergio jaime goyena moment undertakes Ángela basabé 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.810

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.540
 on the other hand, canada 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.540
 other 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.470
 on the other side of the gate 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.850
 will be flooded 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.140
 to remove before the stir because 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.840
 but hit sergio it looked really good 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.229
 I see them that you worked well 

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:13.239
 percent 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:14.319
 but 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:18.769
 when you go a bit more practice reflecting what you can do with this 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:20.259
 way 

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:24.359
 the aces not because you already got it tupro for example the two yes we are going to try 

00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:27.089
 take out the two there we go 

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:29.139

00:02:29.139 --> 00:02:31.339

 jorge do 

00:02:56.109 --> 00:03:00.659
 as it happened something declared for example brazil here and there over here 

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:08.480
 if we go with Eduardo Galeano the truth ahead 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.739
 peña a cut here and another over there 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:14.739

00:03:20.469 --> 00:03:23.469
 trust of letters and boxes 

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:26.979

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:36.239
