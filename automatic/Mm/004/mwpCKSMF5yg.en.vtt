00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:44.699
 more 

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:49.219
 for example there is a marionette lesson I don't know if you love the exact southern family 

00:02:49.219 --> 00:02:50.549
 this is the marine version 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:53.309

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:56.790
 letter of a level let's say if there are two separate levels 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.229
 as in this case 

00:02:58.229 --> 00:03:02.139
 so there are the swtor dragons you are waiting for 

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:06.929

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:35.009
 here there are very high costs 

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:38.639

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:40.229
