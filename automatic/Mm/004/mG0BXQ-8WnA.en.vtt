this<00:00:14.339> is<00:00:14.490> a<00:00:14.519> little<00:00:14.849> piece<00:00:15.030> of<00:00:15.059> foam<00:00:15.540> a<00:00:15.929> pipe

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
this is a little piece of foam a pipe

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.529 
this is a little piece of foam a pipe
liner<00:00:16.590> you<00:00:16.890> can<00:00:17.070> see<00:00:17.279> that<00:00:17.490> it's<00:00:17.640> about<00:00:18.240> a<00:00:18.270> foot

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
liner you can see that it's about a foot

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.480 
liner you can see that it's about a foot
long<00:00:18.779> and<00:00:19.110> we're<00:00:19.710> going<00:00:19.830> to<00:00:19.890> use<00:00:20.070> this<00:00:20.279> as<00:00:20.460> a

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
long and we're going to use this as a

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.429 
long and we're going to use this as a
barrier<00:00:21.029> to<00:00:21.090> put<00:00:21.390> behind<00:00:21.539> the<00:00:21.869> ball<00:00:22.079> when<00:00:22.289> we

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
barrier to put behind the ball when we

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.620 
barrier to put behind the ball when we
chip<00:00:22.800> to<00:00:23.340> keep<00:00:23.550> you<00:00:23.669> from<00:00:23.820> scooping<00:00:24.360> the<00:00:24.450> ball

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
chip to keep you from scooping the ball

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.210 
chip to keep you from scooping the ball
and<00:00:24.900> that's<00:00:24.960> a<00:00:25.140> common<00:00:25.529> problem<00:00:25.680> I<00:00:26.009> see<00:00:26.189> with

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
and that's a common problem I see with

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.159 
and that's a common problem I see with
people<00:00:26.369> when<00:00:27.119> they<00:00:27.270> get<00:00:27.449> up<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:27.720> chip<00:00:27.960> that

00:00:28.159 --> 00:00:28.169 
people when they get up the chip that

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:29.420 
people when they get up the chip that
first<00:00:28.380> of<00:00:28.500> all<00:00:28.560> they<00:00:28.680> usually<00:00:28.829> have<00:00:29.160> it<00:00:29.189> too

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:29.430 
first of all they usually have it too

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:31.759 
first of all they usually have it too
far<00:00:29.610> forward<00:00:29.970> and<00:00:30.330> they<00:00:30.900> try<00:00:31.109> to<00:00:31.140> scoop<00:00:31.529> it<00:00:31.679> up

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
far forward and they try to scoop it up

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.619 
far forward and they try to scoop it up
in<00:00:31.920> the<00:00:32.009> air<00:00:32.189> and<00:00:32.550> then<00:00:32.910> they'll<00:00:33.089> usually<00:00:33.269> hit

00:00:33.619 --> 00:00:33.629 
in the air and then they'll usually hit

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:35.930 
in the air and then they'll usually hit
behind<00:00:34.019> it<00:00:34.170> or<00:00:34.290> scull<00:00:34.620> it<00:00:34.769> so<00:00:35.460> what<00:00:35.640> you<00:00:35.760> do

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
behind it or scull it so what you do

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.640 
behind it or scull it so what you do
with<00:00:36.089> this<00:00:36.300> is<00:00:36.629> you<00:00:36.750> just<00:00:36.930> simply<00:00:37.110> put<00:00:37.500> this

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:37.650 
with this is you just simply put this

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.299 
with this is you just simply put this
behind<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.610> ball<00:00:38.850> oh<00:00:39.269> maybe<00:00:40.050> about<00:00:40.190> six<00:00:41.190> to

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
behind the ball oh maybe about six to

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.430 
behind the ball oh maybe about six to
eight<00:00:41.339> inches<00:00:41.519> and<00:00:42.210> it<00:00:42.750> forms<00:00:43.079> a<00:00:43.199> little

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
eight inches and it forms a little

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.290 
eight inches and it forms a little
barrier<00:00:43.860> so<00:00:44.160> that<00:00:44.309> you<00:00:44.430> can<00:00:44.550> get<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.820> ball<00:00:45.030> off

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
barrier so that you can get the ball off

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.920 
barrier so that you can get the ball off
your<00:00:45.420> right<00:00:45.989> toe<00:00:46.580> lean<00:00:47.580> forward<00:00:48.269> and<00:00:48.479> then

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
your right toe lean forward and then

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.109 
your right toe lean forward and then
when<00:00:49.110> you<00:00:49.199> chip<00:00:49.530> your<00:00:49.799> little<00:00:50.100> club<00:00:50.699> should<00:00:50.940> go

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:51.119 
when you chip your little club should go

00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:55.700 
when you chip your little club should go
up<00:00:51.360> and<00:00:51.600> down<00:00:53.540> over<00:00:54.540> the<00:00:54.659> top<00:00:54.690> of<00:00:54.900> the<00:00:55.170> pipe<00:00:55.409> and

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
up and down over the top of the pipe and

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.859 
up and down over the top of the pipe and
then<00:00:56.430> as<00:00:56.610> you<00:00:56.790> come<00:00:57.000> forward<00:00:57.510> with<00:00:57.659> your

00:00:57.859 --> 00:00:57.869 
then as you come forward with your

00:00:57.869 --> 00:00:59.960 
then as you come forward with your
weight<00:00:58.049> left<00:00:58.350> you'll<00:00:59.159> hit<00:00:59.339> it<00:00:59.460> with<00:00:59.580> that<00:00:59.729> nice

00:00:59.960 --> 00:00:59.970

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
you're going to hit the pipe first so

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.520
