and I'm going to show you how to use
some<00:00:09.360> of<00:00:09.389> the<00:00:09.510> great<00:00:09.719> tools<00:00:09.990> that<00:00:10.170> you<00:00:10.380> see

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
some of the great tools that you see

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:16.020 
some of the great tools that you see
here<00:00:10.860> on<00:00:11.010> Bulldog<00:00:11.250> comm

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:16.030 

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:18.520 

this<00:00:17.030> is<00:00:17.210> the<00:00:17.300> ultimate<00:00:17.540> tip<00:00:17.870> tool<00:00:18.080> it's

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:18.530 
this is the ultimate tip tool it's

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:20.320 
this is the ultimate tip tool it's
probably<00:00:19.040> the<00:00:19.130> most<00:00:19.250> comprehensive<00:00:19.640> tool<00:00:20.119> out

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:20.330 
probably the most comprehensive tool out

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.870 
probably the most comprehensive tool out
there<00:00:20.570> because<00:00:20.840> it's<00:00:21.140> five<00:00:21.440> and<00:00:21.680> one<00:00:21.860> and<00:00:22.130> also

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:22.880 
there because it's five and one and also

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.890 
there because it's five and one and also
it's<00:00:23.420> in<00:00:23.540> this<00:00:23.690> tiny<00:00:24.050> little<00:00:24.380> package<00:00:25.810> one<00:00:26.810> of

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:26.900 
it's in this tiny little package one of

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.200 
it's in this tiny little package one of
the<00:00:26.960> first<00:00:27.200> things<00:00:27.529> that<00:00:27.650> this<00:00:27.920> tool<00:00:28.580> does<00:00:28.849> is

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:29.210 
the first things that this tool does is

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.960 
the first things that this tool does is
it<00:00:29.720> shapes<00:00:30.200> the<00:00:30.410> side<00:00:30.680> of<00:00:30.890> the<00:00:31.010> tip<00:00:31.220> and<00:00:31.520> can

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:31.970 
it shapes the side of the tip and can

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.710 
it shapes the side of the tip and can
remove<00:00:32.240> mushrooms<00:00:33.820> mushrooming<00:00:34.820> is<00:00:35.120> when<00:00:35.390> the

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:35.720 
remove mushrooms mushrooming is when the

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.870 
remove mushrooms mushrooming is when the
tip<00:00:35.960> comes<00:00:36.260> out<00:00:36.440> past<00:00:36.710> the<00:00:36.950> ferrule<00:00:37.310> from<00:00:37.700> a

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:37.880 
tip comes out past the ferrule from a

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.760 
tip comes out past the ferrule from a
lot<00:00:38.060> of<00:00:38.090> use<00:00:38.360> it<00:00:38.570> compresses<00:00:38.900> the<00:00:39.140> tip<00:00:39.350> and<00:00:39.590> it

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:39.770 
lot of use it compresses the tip and it

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.580 
lot of use it compresses the tip and it
starts<00:00:40.070> to<00:00:40.250> stick<00:00:40.460> out<00:00:40.640> on<00:00:40.790> the<00:00:40.910> sides<00:00:41.560> it<00:00:42.560> has

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:42.590 
starts to stick out on the sides it has

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.830 
starts to stick out on the sides it has
this<00:00:42.980> nice<00:00:43.220> little<00:00:43.280> Ridge<00:00:44.000> here<00:00:44.030> that<00:00:44.510> the<00:00:44.600> Q

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:44.840

is<00:01:07.550> that<00:01:07.790> it's<00:01:08.090> a<00:01:08.180> burnisher<00:01:08.740> these<00:01:09.740> two

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
is that it's a burnisher these two

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.280 
is that it's a burnisher these two
little<00:01:10.190> prongs<00:01:10.460> here<00:01:10.880> will<00:01:11.360> actually<00:01:11.810> fit<00:01:12.050> any

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
little prongs here will actually fit any

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.250 
little prongs here will actually fit any
size<00:01:12.710> Q<00:01:13.130> and<00:01:14.090> all<00:01:14.300> you<00:01:14.390> have<00:01:14.510> to<00:01:14.570> do<00:01:14.720> is<00:01:14.990> push

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:15.260 
size Q and all you have to do is push

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.040 
size Q and all you have to do is push
down<00:01:15.290> very<00:01:15.920> lightly<00:01:16.190> and<00:01:16.580> twist<00:01:17.330> the<00:01:17.480> Q<00:01:17.750> in<00:01:17.990> the

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:18.050 
down very lightly and twist the Q in the

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:20.980 
down very lightly and twist the Q in the
middle<00:01:19.120> this<00:01:20.120> is<00:01:20.240> going<00:01:20.390> to<00:01:20.450> burnish<00:01:20.810> the

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
middle this is going to burnish the

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.260 
middle this is going to burnish the
sides<00:01:21.200> of<00:01:21.350> the<00:01:21.440> tip<00:01:21.680> and<00:01:21.860> seal<00:01:22.190> it<00:01:22.400> so<00:01:22.970> that<00:01:23.180> you

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
sides of the tip and seal it so that you

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.870 
sides of the tip and seal it so that you
don't<00:01:23.450> have<00:01:23.600> any<00:01:23.840> pieces<00:01:24.740> that<00:01:24.950> stick<00:01:25.460> out<00:01:25.640> and

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
don't have any pieces that stick out and

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.360 
don't have any pieces that stick out and
it'll<00:01:26.420> keep<00:01:26.570> it<00:01:26.750> from<00:01:26.870> mushrooming<00:01:27.380> the<00:01:28.160> other

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:28.370 
it'll keep it from mushrooming the other

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:29.920 
it'll keep it from mushrooming the other
thing<00:01:28.610> I<00:01:28.700> like<00:01:28.850> about<00:01:28.880> this<00:01:29.210> tool<00:01:29.480> is<00:01:29.720> that<00:01:29.750> it

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930

thing I like about this tool is that it
has<00:01:30.170> this<00:01:30.350> pad<00:01:30.590> on<00:01:30.800> the<00:01:30.890> back<00:01:31.100> that<00:01:31.520> functions

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
has this pad on the back that functions

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.690 
has this pad on the back that functions
as<00:01:31.970> a<00:01:32.030> tip<00:01:32.270> tapper<00:01:32.860> all<00:01:33.860> you<00:01:34.010> have<00:01:34.130> to<00:01:34.250> do<00:01:34.430> is

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
as a tip tapper all you have to do is

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.370 
as a tip tapper all you have to do is
use<00:01:35.060> it<00:01:35.210> like<00:01:35.330> a<00:01:35.360> paddle<00:01:35.780> and<00:01:35.930> just<00:01:36.110> lightly

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
use it like a paddle and just lightly

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.040 
use it like a paddle and just lightly
tap<00:01:36.740> the<00:01:36.980> tip<00:01:37.190> and<00:01:38.060> this<00:01:38.300> will<00:01:38.450> create<00:01:38.630> pores

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:39.050 
tap the tip and this will create pores

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.170 
tap the tip and this will create pores
that<00:01:39.440> will<00:01:39.560> help<00:01:39.710> the<00:01:39.950> chalk<00:01:40.220> stay<00:01:40.610> in<00:01:40.820> the<00:01:40.970> tip

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180 
that will help the chalk stay in the tip

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:47.020 
that will help the chalk stay in the tip
and<00:01:41.390> reduce<00:01:41.930> miscues<00:01:45.370> once<00:01:46.370> you<00:01:46.520> do<00:01:46.610> that<00:01:46.790> it's

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
and reduce miscues once you do that it's

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.570 
and reduce miscues once you do that it's
ready<00:01:47.330> for<00:01:47.600> chalking<00:01:48.100> one<00:01:49.100> of<00:01:49.190> the<00:01:49.280> greatest

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:49.580 
ready for chalking one of the greatest

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.000 
ready for chalking one of the greatest
things<00:01:49.820> about<00:01:49.940> this<00:01:50.240> tool<00:01:50.510> is<00:01:50.780> that<00:01:51.260> not<00:01:51.800> only

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.010 
things about this tool is that not only

things about this tool is that not only
does<00:01:52.310> it<00:01:52.340> have<00:01:52.610> a<00:01:52.850> nickel-sized<00:01:53.530> shaper<00:01:54.530> it

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
does it have a nickel-sized shaper it

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.490 
does it have a nickel-sized shaper it
has<00:01:55.340> a<00:01:55.370> dime-sized<00:01:55.940> shaper<00:01:56.420> if<00:01:57.170> you<00:01:57.320> don't

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
has a dime-sized shaper if you don't

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:58.300 
has a dime-sized shaper if you don't
know<00:01:57.560> what<00:01:57.650> I'm<00:01:57.710> talking<00:01:58.040> about
