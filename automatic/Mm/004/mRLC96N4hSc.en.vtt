00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.210
 last week the thigh gave a 

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:09.580
 important step towards the evolution of the 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:12.190
 football in the short and long term through 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:15.190
 information unit training and 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:17.140
 coritiba innovation unify a great 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:18.910
 investment was made by the 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.070
 with the purchase of handsets and software 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:23.950
 which will facilitate the process of 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:26.080
 capture and analysis of game data and 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:28.540
 training involving all 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.590
 categories of the sub-11 thigh to 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:31.660
 professional 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:35.890
 technology today is a path without 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:38.500
 Back to pro football then it's a is a 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.330
 Great grass acquisition I think it will 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.940
 take an important step 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:46.090
 the department unifies, the objective is 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.560
 really unify the information and 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.430
 tool will be a facilitator in this 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.930
 process 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.150
 this is a platform that comes to us 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.310
 to help the day-to-day work of the people 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:56.920
 optimize the service of analysis of 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:57.640
 prospecting gold 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.920
 athletes 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.260
 the sport iscold analysis tool 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.670
 data is used by all teams 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.240
 first and second division of england 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.890
 and only by eight Brazilian teams 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.960
 during three working days of the 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.390
 Coritiba have been trained to 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:16.090
 exploit the maximum potential of 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.250
 tool like scott sport is very 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.920
 each club uses the software 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.840
 according to his philosophy of play is 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.460
 the opportunity outside the country 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.799
 and then I noticed that this is an area 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.400
 that they are way ahead of us 

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:29.200
 huh 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.330
 all clubs have a department with 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.000
 many people working with 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:36.280
 professionals for quite some time now. 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.320
 and here in Brazil they 've been crawling 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.060
 arriving and coritiba took a step towards 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.549
 ahead I did not get one for power 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:46.510
 work better everyday 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:49.270
 the concept already jattak is not with the culture 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:52.330
 the club in terms of what 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:55.180
 observation of both the main team 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.439
 as the categories of legal basis 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.439
 will create a channel of communication between 

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:01.930
 they define nÃ© concepts of analysis 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:04.509
 technical analysis tactical analysis 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:07.360
 individual data can be 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:09.939
 be crossed or that is the technical 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.510
 can analyze for example if the number of 

00:02:09.939 --> 00:02:14.060
 certain passes and 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.640
 offensive is influencing 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.150
 directly at the right junctions for the 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.069
 area 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.170
 and which player best performs this 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:23.480
 there are thousands of 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.519
 possibilities of comparison 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.439
 collective as individual 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:29.390
 all studies will be used to 

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:31.250
 improve training situations or 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.860
 games and improve performance 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.750
 of the athletes in that first 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.879
 contact was personal to understand the concept 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.430
 the use of the software, how will they 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:42.920
 to apply the question of analysis to 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.500
 they already do is not now translated to 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.900
 the software as this process 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.480
 assembly of analysis protocols and 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.970
 then, how are they going to visualize? 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.459
 this information to deliver the 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.530
 coaches own managers all 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:59.900
 employees have already begun to 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.639
 test and deploy the tool 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.920
 the first test was in the game against the 

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:05.750
 home at home for the cup of Brazil 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.700
 acquisition of such technologies is a 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:10.280
 important step towards the future of 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.290
 coritiba both short and long 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.840
 deadline is to take a step forward and 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.790
 work in a way to optimize time 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.790
 so we can work better 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:21.440
 each of our opponents and 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.359
 improve the way we play 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.519
 passing this to the condition of the 

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:28.160
 athletes for the management so that people 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:30.430
 can go along with the coritiba to raise flights 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.430
 larger
