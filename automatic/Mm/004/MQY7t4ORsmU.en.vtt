00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.290 
accident on pretty sure it was on one of
my<00:01:33.470> other<00:01:33.620> classes<00:01:34.040> and<00:01:34.520> I<00:01:34.820> just<00:01:34.970> went<00:01:35.090> really

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:35.300 
my other classes and I just went really

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:36.969 
my other classes and I just went really
good<00:01:35.540> with<00:01:35.690> in<00:01:35.810> this<00:01:35.960> game<00:01:36.229> compared<00:01:36.710> to<00:01:36.830> on<00:01:36.920> my

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:36.979 
good with in this game compared to on my

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:38.530 
good with in this game compared to on my
other<00:01:37.100> game<00:01:37.400> so<00:01:37.670> I<00:01:37.700> thought<00:01:37.909> I'd<00:01:38.090> may<00:01:38.240> as<00:01:38.390> well

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:38.540 
other game so I thought I'd may as well

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.030 
other game so I thought I'd may as well
just<00:01:38.659> record<00:01:39.020> this<00:01:39.140> for<00:01:39.290> you<00:01:39.380> guys<00:01:39.409> but<00:01:39.950> I
