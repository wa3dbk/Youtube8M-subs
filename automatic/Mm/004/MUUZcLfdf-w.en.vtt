00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:10.150
 hi universal girls team and how 

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:12.309
 life is to me it gives me perfect because 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:14.830
 they just brought me some presents today 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:16.750
 very beautiful for my guardians of 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.340
 shader blacks mine that is the one that we are 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.439
 drawing around when we are no longer giving away 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.480
 really a few days ago so 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:23.770
 those that were faster had 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.930
 good luck and I hope but I'm 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:28.180
 enjoying that you like the shader well 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:29.830
 let's see how it fits first 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.769
 titans this shader that the detail 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:34.120
 principal is more than anything yellow let's go 

00:00:32.769 --> 00:00:36.940
 to see what he has left to see if he gives 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:39.190
 this for loading and we'll see the set of 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:42.430
 black night as you are left you see almost 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:44.860
 everything is yellow with gray details and 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:46.360
 some other brown at least in the 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.640
 armor of the iron standard that is 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:53.699
 which usually use or at least the most 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:57.040
 or less more suitable scheider more in your 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:59.860
 splendor but I tell you the detail 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:02.260
 main is yellow totally beige 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.360
 a 6 is pretty cantoso but if it 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.370
 decorate the good with a good 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.740
 skirt and whatever it may be you can stay 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:10.420
 pretty good and talking about layers we're going 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:14.260
 to see what's left for the hunter 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:16.330
 we're going to see that it was red and now 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:18.550
 with the sei of the black I change the 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.830
 details from red to yellow you see what 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:24.070
 well is the little detail of the layer also 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:26.830
 it's yellow if we put a layer that 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:29.370
 have the lindens let's see how 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:31.440
 it is left and what is the detail 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:33.330
 but I'm telling you, you see, it's from casting it 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.070
 mainly elche de blas that 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.830
 you usually give it in events and 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.650
 they give it on occasional occasions not the 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:42.630
 first time we want this that idea and 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.960
 that we fall to be able to give to be able 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.210
 give it to the community as you see all the 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.420
 all the detail is as well as yellowish 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.460
 or the crimson 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.500
 and so the hunter is left, let's see 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.810
 what's left for the sorceress 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.370
 a children's playground bread I do not carry the best 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.280
 attire of the world to teach a 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:04.229
 detail because in the case of the armor 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.140
 of the iron standard 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:10.229
 the detail is minimal you see there in the 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:13.860
 chest is yellow if he was 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:15.210
 another type of shirt that is not the 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.540
 case 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:20.040
 I would like everything is suit 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.190
 it is yellow but in the case 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.260
 of the iron standard attire 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:28.680
 unfortunately it remains gray and in 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:31.260
 details let's say that shirt or that 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.810
 what to bring in the center of Sara 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.180
 same if we change west axis we have 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.490
 made even worse but good here what 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.750
 you see the detail of the three armors is 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.180
 yellow in the shader 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.400
 blacksmith if you are curious to see 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:48.300
