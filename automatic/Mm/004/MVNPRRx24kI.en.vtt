ophthalmology and I care in this episode
I<00:00:07.770> would<00:00:08.130> like<00:00:08.280> to<00:00:08.429> explain<00:00:08.760> corneal

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
I would like to explain corneal

epithelial<00:00:10.050> basement<00:00:10.830> membrane<00:00:11.370> dystrophy

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
epithelial basement membrane dystrophy

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.539 
epithelial basement membrane dystrophy
because<00:00:13.139> recently<00:00:13.410> we<00:00:13.740> had<00:00:14.070> a<00:00:14.099> question<00:00:14.340> on

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
because recently we had a question on

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.150 
because recently we had a question on
Facebook<00:00:14.990> wondering<00:00:15.990> for<00:00:16.500> more<00:00:16.650> information

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
Facebook wondering for more information

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.099 
Facebook wondering for more information
about<00:00:17.279> this<00:00:17.699> and<00:00:17.970> I<00:00:18.000> thought<00:00:18.720> it'd<00:00:18.840> be<00:00:18.869> a<00:00:18.930> great

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
about this and I thought it'd be a great

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.980 
about this and I thought it'd be a great
time<00:00:19.410> to<00:00:19.560> share<00:00:19.800> this<00:00:20.580> dystrophy<00:00:21.330> goes<00:00:21.720> by

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
time to share this dystrophy goes by

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.439 
time to share this dystrophy goes by
several<00:00:22.710> different<00:00:22.830> names<00:00:23.100> and<00:00:23.519> none<00:00:24.210> of<00:00:24.240> them

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
several different names and none of them

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.630 
several different names and none of them
are<00:00:24.510> very<00:00:24.900> easy<00:00:25.260> to<00:00:25.980> say<00:00:26.189> or<00:00:26.369> easy<00:00:26.519> to

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
are very easy to say or easy to

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.419 
are very easy to say or easy to
understand<00:00:27.150> but<00:00:27.390> one<00:00:27.869> is<00:00:28.109> map<00:00:28.980> dot

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
understand but one is map dot

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.359 
understand but one is map dot
fingerprint<00:00:30.269> dystrophy<00:00:30.990> some<00:00:31.980> people<00:00:32.219> may

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
fingerprint dystrophy some people may

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.720 
fingerprint dystrophy some people may
just<00:00:32.399> call<00:00:32.820> it<00:00:33.030> map<00:00:33.360> dot<00:00:33.690> dystrophy<00:00:34.320> or<00:00:34.610> like<00:00:35.610> I

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
just call it map dot dystrophy or like I

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.000 
just call it map dot dystrophy or like I
said<00:00:35.790> before<00:00:36.059> corneal<00:00:36.719> epithelial<00:00:37.469> basement

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
said before corneal epithelial basement

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.119 
said before corneal epithelial basement
membrane<00:00:38.520> dystrophy<00:00:39.120> and<00:00:39.410> so<00:00:40.410> and<00:00:40.710> to

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
membrane dystrophy and so and to

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.740 
membrane dystrophy and so and to
understand<00:00:41.670> what<00:00:41.790> this<00:00:41.879> is<00:00:42.090> remember<00:00:42.570> that

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
understand what this is remember that

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.080 
understand what this is remember that
the<00:00:43.140> cornea<00:00:43.559> is<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:44.100> clear<00:00:44.370> shield<00:00:44.700> that

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
the cornea is the clear shield that

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.630 
the cornea is the clear shield that
covers<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.480> front<00:00:45.719> of<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:45.989> eye<00:00:46.020> and<00:00:46.430> then<00:00:47.430> the

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
covers the front of the eye and then the

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.240 
covers the front of the eye and then the
surface<00:00:47.940> of<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.719> cornea<00:00:48.960> is<00:00:49.379> covered<00:00:50.070> by<00:00:50.190> the

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
surface of the cornea is covered by the

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.029 
surface of the cornea is covered by the
epithelium<00:00:51.030> so<00:00:51.719> this<00:00:51.960> is<00:00:52.110> basically<00:00:52.530> a<00:00:52.680> thin

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
epithelium so this is basically a thin

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.310 
epithelium so this is basically a thin
layer<00:00:53.250> of<00:00:53.489> cells<00:00:53.789> that<00:00:54.059> always<00:00:54.600> changes<00:00:55.050> over

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
layer of cells that always changes over

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.430 
layer of cells that always changes over
kind<00:00:55.620> of<00:00:55.680> like<00:00:55.890> our<00:00:56.070> skin<00:00:56.399> that<00:00:57.300> keeps<00:00:58.230> the

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
kind of like our skin that keeps the

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.340 
kind of like our skin that keeps the
surface<00:00:58.620> nice<00:00:59.280> and<00:00:59.550> smooth<00:00:59.879> and<00:01:00.090> clear<00:01:00.930> so<00:01:01.199> we

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
surface nice and smooth and clear so we

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.850 
surface nice and smooth and clear so we
can<00:01:01.530> see<00:01:01.940> these<00:01:02.940> cells<00:01:03.270> are<00:01:03.539> attached<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.650> the

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
can see these cells are attached to the

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.760 
can see these cells are attached to the
underlying<00:01:05.339> layers<00:01:05.700> by<00:01:06.510> their<00:01:06.930> basement

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
underlying layers by their basement

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.609 
underlying layers by their basement
membrane<00:01:08.310> which<00:01:09.119> is<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.720> bottom<00:01:10.140> layer<00:01:10.350> of

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
membrane which is the bottom layer of

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.359 
membrane which is the bottom layer of
the<00:01:10.860> epithelium<00:01:11.520> now<00:01:12.510> in<00:01:13.229> this<00:01:13.650> dystrophy

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
the epithelium now in this dystrophy

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.550 
the epithelium now in this dystrophy
that<00:01:14.549> basement<00:01:15.390> membrane<00:01:15.780> can<00:01:16.200> become

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
that basement membrane can become

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.030 
that basement membrane can become
thicker<00:01:17.340> and<00:01:17.759> we<00:01:18.330> can<00:01:18.540> see<00:01:18.780> this<00:01:18.990> with<00:01:19.439> white

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
thicker and we can see this with white

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.880 
thicker and we can see this with white
lines<00:01:20.430> or<00:01:20.850> spots<00:01:21.270> on<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:22.290> surface<00:01:22.650> of<00:01:22.770> the

lines or spots on the surface of the

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.160 
lines or spots on the surface of the
cornea<00:01:23.150> that's<00:01:24.150> how<00:01:24.330> it<00:01:24.479> gets<00:01:24.570> part<00:01:24.930> of<00:01:25.080> the

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
cornea that's how it gets part of the

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
name map dot fingerprint because these

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.770 
name map dot fingerprint because these
lines<00:01:28.350> can<00:01:28.799> have<00:01:29.460> an<00:01:29.670> irregular<00:01:30.270> shape<00:01:30.299> and

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
lines can have an irregular shape and

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.310 
lines can have an irregular shape and
look<00:01:31.049> a<00:01:31.170> little<00:01:31.320> bit<00:01:31.439> like<00:01:31.590> lines<00:01:32.369> on<00:01:32.610> a<00:01:32.640> map

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 
look a little bit like lines on a map

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.990 
look a little bit like lines on a map
where<00:01:34.320> they<00:01:34.470> could<00:01:34.680> look<00:01:34.799> like<00:01:34.860> dots<00:01:35.340> or<00:01:35.640> they

where they could look like dots or they

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.149 
where they could look like dots or they
could<00:01:36.240> look<00:01:36.450> like<00:01:36.509> fingerprints<00:01:37.290> where

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
could look like fingerprints where

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.780 
could look like fingerprints where
there's<00:01:38.520> many<00:01:38.850> lines<00:01:39.290> running<00:01:40.290> together<00:01:40.790> now
