00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
guess I can say it but he does kind of

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.350

remind<00:01:10.209> me<00:01:10.569> of<00:01:10.690> the<00:01:11.220> 1980s<00:01:12.220> Ninja<00:01:13.060> Turtles

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:13.360

remind me of the 1980s Ninja Turtles
cartoon<00:01:13.539> and<00:01:14.380> the<00:01:14.920> reason<00:01:15.160> why<00:01:15.280> I<00:01:15.310> say<00:01:15.520> that<00:01:15.550> is

00:01:15.839 --> 00:01:15.849 
cartoon and the reason why I say that is

00:01:15.849 --> 00:01:19.040 
cartoon and the reason why I say that is
because<00:01:16.000> well<00:01:16.720> when<00:01:17.380> he<00:01:17.590> came<00:01:17.800> out<00:01:18.009> as<00:01:18.220> the<00:01:18.250> toy

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:19.050

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
similar what you did with the afford in

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.390 
similar what you did with the afford in
Turtles<00:02:56.280> and<00:02:56.520> then<00:02:57.270> the<00:02:57.620> knee<00:02:58.620> movement<00:02:58.860> here

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
Turtles and then the knee movement here

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.150 
Turtles and then the knee movement here
and<00:02:59.840> then<00:03:00.840> that's<00:03:01.230> the<00:03:01.350> bottom<00:03:01.680> of<00:03:01.800> his<00:03:01.890> feet

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
and then that's the bottom of his feet

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.330 
and then that's the bottom of his feet
so<00:03:02.580> he's<00:03:03.090> all<00:03:03.300> around<00:03:03.450> nice

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
like I said due to the shell right here

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.520 
like I said due to the shell right here
it<00:03:09.240> can't<00:03:09.450> really<00:03:09.630> hinder<00:03:09.990> all<00:03:10.110> the<00:03:10.200> way<00:03:10.290> back

00:04:53.689 --> 00:04:53.699 
friends now it is time to the size

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:57.140 
friends now it is time to the size
comparison<00:04:54.270> with<00:04:54.660> metalhead<00:04:55.229> and<00:04:55.500> I<00:04:56.460> decided

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150 
comparison with metalhead and I decided

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.270 
comparison with metalhead and I decided
to<00:04:57.300> go<00:04:57.449> ahead<00:04:57.569> and<00:04:57.990> since<00:04:58.199> he<00:04:58.470> created<00:04:58.919> them<00:04:59.069> I

00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 
to go ahead and since he created them I

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:02.830 
to go ahead and since he created them I
added<00:04:59.580> Donatello<00:05:00.300> and<00:05:00.860> as<00:05:01.860> you<00:05:02.250> can<00:05:02.400> see

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:02.840 
added Donatello and as you can see

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.809 
added Donatello and as you can see
they're<00:05:03.840> both<00:05:04.110> he's<00:05:04.680> taller<00:05:05.039> than<00:05:05.190> metalhead

00:05:05.809 --> 00:05:05.819 
they're both he's taller than metalhead

00:05:05.819 --> 00:05:07.700 
they're both he's taller than metalhead
so<00:05:06.120> let's<00:05:06.539> just<00:05:06.690> do<00:05:06.810> a<00:05:06.840> little<00:05:06.900> back<00:05:07.259> to<00:05:07.289> back

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:07.710 
so let's just do a little back to back

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:11.330 
so let's just do a little back to back
so<00:05:08.699> yeah<00:05:08.849> he's<00:05:09.060> definitely<00:05:09.949> taller<00:05:10.949> than

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:11.340 
so yeah he's definitely taller than

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:14.450 
so yeah he's definitely taller than
metalhead<00:05:11.880> so<00:05:12.870> that<00:05:13.110> makes<00:05:13.319> metalhead<00:05:14.250> a

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:14.460 
metalhead so that makes metalhead a

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:18.879 
metalhead so that makes metalhead a
shrimp<00:05:15.650> no<00:05:16.650> not<00:05:16.889> really

00:05:18.879 --> 00:05:18.889 
shrimp no not really

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:23.270 
shrimp no not really
so<00:05:19.889> now<00:05:20.729> real<00:05:21.030> quickly<00:05:21.300> I<00:05:21.509> know<00:05:21.630> I'm<00:05:22.500> doing

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.280 
so now real quickly I know I'm doing

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.159 
so now real quickly I know I'm doing
size<00:05:23.520> comparison<00:05:24.150> but<00:05:24.270> mainly<00:05:24.630> you<00:05:24.870> get<00:05:25.050> the

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:25.169 
size comparison but mainly you get the

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:26.809 
size comparison but mainly you get the
gist<00:05:25.470> that<00:05:25.590> you<00:05:25.830> know<00:05:25.949> all<00:05:26.280> four<00:05:26.310> Ninja
