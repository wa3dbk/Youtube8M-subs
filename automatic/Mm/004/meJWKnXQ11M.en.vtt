00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
and then they turn go to the parking lot

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.020 
and then they turn go to the parking lot
of<00:00:28.920> the<00:00:29.160> game<00:00:29.660> where<00:00:30.660> like<00:00:30.689> all<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.170> cars<00:00:31.470> are

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:32.030 
of the game where like all the cars are

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:40.160 
of the game where like all the cars are
so<00:00:33.030> we<00:00:33.690> made<00:00:33.870> like<00:00:34.020> a<00:00:34.079> handle<00:00:35.540> so<00:00:36.950> there<00:00:39.170> the

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
so we made like a handle so there the

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.380 
so we made like a handle so there the
cars<00:00:42.050> go<00:00:43.050> straight<00:00:43.469> turn<00:00:44.280> it<00:00:44.489> back<00:00:44.910> to<00:00:44.940> start

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
cars go straight turn it back to start

00:00:45.390 --> 00:02:06.750 
cars go straight turn it back to start
finish<00:00:45.980> three<00:00:46.980> two<00:00:47.910> one

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:06.760 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.800 

and<00:02:07.760> then<00:02:07.910> solve<00:02:08.180> for<00:02:08.240> those<00:02:08.450> connects

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
and then solve for those connects

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.470 
and then solve for those connects
