it's putting out it said will appear to
put<00:00:55.830> out<00:00:55.920> more<00:00:56.160> than<00:00:56.550> if<00:00:56.670> it<00:00:56.760> was<00:00:56.850> actually

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
put out more than if it was actually

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
solar panel and I'm going to add some

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.700 
solar panel and I'm going to add some
more<00:01:02.370> all<00:01:02.550> along<00:01:02.820> this<00:01:03.030> this<00:01:03.900> structure<00:01:04.439> as<00:01:04.589> I

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
more all along this this structure as I

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.239 
more all along this this structure as I
go<00:01:05.000> but<00:01:06.000> I<00:01:06.659> keep<00:01:07.229> all<00:01:07.350> my<00:01:07.409> batteries<00:01:07.679> inside

00:01:08.239 --> 00:01:08.249 
go but I keep all my batteries inside

00:01:08.249 --> 00:01:10.849 
go but I keep all my batteries inside
this<00:01:08.399> tool<00:01:08.700> shed<00:01:08.999> here<00:01:09.329> because<00:01:10.200> when<00:01:10.740> the

00:01:10.849 --> 00:01:10.859 
this tool shed here because when the

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:12.709 
this tool shed here because when the
charging<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:11.399> discharging<00:01:11.490> will<00:01:12.210> be<00:01:12.359> off

00:01:12.709 --> 00:01:12.719 
charging and discharging will be off

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:16.429 
charging and discharging will be off
casting<00:01:13.710> some<00:01:14.280> noxious<00:01:14.670> gases<00:01:15.359> so<00:01:16.079> you<00:01:16.229> want

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
casting some noxious gases so you want

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:17.749 
casting some noxious gases so you want
to<00:01:16.499> have<00:01:16.619> them<00:01:16.740> away<00:01:16.950> from<00:01:17.009> where<00:01:17.280> you<00:01:17.369> live<00:01:17.549> in

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
to have them away from where you live in

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.709 
to have them away from where you live in
but<00:01:18.859> then<00:01:19.859> why<00:01:20.819> are<00:01:20.999> going<00:01:21.210> out<00:01:21.329> at<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.509> top<00:01:21.689> of

00:01:21.709 --> 00:01:21.719 
but then why are going out at the top of

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:24.709 
but then why are going out at the top of
the<00:01:21.929> tool<00:01:22.140> shed<00:01:22.409> there<00:01:23.299> that's<00:01:24.299> what's

00:01:24.709 --> 00:01:24.719 
the tool shed there that's what's

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:28.489 
the tool shed there that's what's
heading<00:01:25.020> into<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.469> house<00:01:25.679> and<00:01:27.229> you<00:01:28.229> know<00:01:28.350> if<00:01:28.439> I

00:01:28.489 --> 00:01:28.499 
heading into the house and you know if I

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:30.020 
heading into the house and you know if I
was<00:01:28.649> to<00:01:28.770> add<00:01:28.829> a<00:01:28.920> lot<00:01:29.100> more<00:01:29.159> like<00:01:29.490> that<00:01:29.670> probably

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
was to add a lot more like that probably

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.559 
was to add a lot more like that probably
use<00:01:30.149> heavier<00:01:30.569> gauge<00:01:30.869> wire<00:01:31.579> but<00:01:32.579> let's<00:01:32.789> go<00:01:32.909> into

00:01:33.559 --> 00:01:33.569 
use heavier gauge wire but let's go into

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:36.980 
use heavier gauge wire but let's go into
the<00:01:33.659> tool<00:01:33.840> shed<00:01:35.030> that<00:01:36.030> there's<00:01:36.299> a<00:01:36.450> light<00:01:36.749> bulb

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
the tool shed that there's a light bulb

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.709 
the tool shed that there's a light bulb
i<00:01:37.109> installed<00:01:37.560> it<00:01:37.799> is<00:01:38.369> pitch<00:01:38.969> black<00:01:38.999> and<00:01:39.659> we

00:01:39.709 --> 00:01:39.719 
i installed it is pitch black and we

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:41.749 
i installed it is pitch black and we
didn't<00:01:39.990> have<00:01:40.049> had<00:01:41.009> a<00:01:41.039> power<00:01:41.249> outage<00:01:41.399> I

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
didn't have had a power outage I

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.099 
didn't have had a power outage I
wouldn't<00:01:41.969> have<00:01:42.060> my<00:01:42.179> motion<00:01:42.539> sensor<00:01:42.840> light<00:01:42.990> out

00:01:43.099 --> 00:01:43.109 
wouldn't have my motion sensor light out

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:45.440 
wouldn't have my motion sensor light out
here<00:01:43.319> I<00:01:43.530> flick<00:01:44.460> this<00:01:44.639> on<00:01:44.880> it's<00:01:45.119> actually<00:01:45.359> got

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
here I flick this on it's actually got

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.260 
here I flick this on it's actually got
two<00:01:45.659> filaments<00:01:45.990> so<00:01:46.859> I<00:01:47.369> only<00:01:47.759> have<00:01:47.880> one<00:01:48.060> hooked

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
two filaments so I only have one hooked

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.149 
two filaments so I only have one hooked
up<00:01:48.479> if<00:01:48.689> I<00:01:48.780> needed<00:01:49.079> to<00:01:49.170> change<00:01:49.499> my<00:01:49.649> light<00:01:49.859> bulb<00:01:50.009> I

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
up if I needed to change my light bulb I

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.010 
up if I needed to change my light bulb I
could<00:01:50.310> just<00:01:50.459> switch<00:01:51.179> wires<00:01:51.450> to<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:51.840> other

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
could just switch wires to the other

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.739 
could just switch wires to the other
filament<00:01:52.499> but<00:01:53.429> as<00:01:53.609> that's<00:01:53.789> to<00:01:54.030> light<00:01:54.389> this<00:01:54.600> up

00:01:54.739 --> 00:01:54.749 
filament but as that's to light this up

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:57.529 
filament but as that's to light this up
so<00:01:55.079> I<00:01:55.350> can<00:01:56.009> see<00:01:56.429> what<00:01:56.520> I'm<00:01:56.609> doing<00:01:56.639> unlocking

00:01:57.529 --> 00:01:57.539 
so I can see what I'm doing unlocking

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:59.850 
so I can see what I'm doing unlocking
the<00:01:57.630> lock

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.969 

and<00:02:00.860> then<00:02:01.330> this<00:02:02.330> is<00:02:02.390> the<00:02:02.570> solar<00:02:02.900> setup<00:02:03.229> here's

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
and then this is the solar setup here's

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:07.480 
and then this is the solar setup here's
where<00:02:04.190> it<00:02:04.280> comes<00:02:04.549> in<00:02:04.820> from<00:02:05.810> the<00:02:06.770> solar<00:02:07.040> panel

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
where it comes in from the solar panel

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
where it comes in from the solar panel
the<00:02:07.700> electricity<00:02:08.420> and<00:02:08.679> it<00:02:09.679> goes<00:02:09.860> to<00:02:10.039> the

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:10.510 
the electricity and it goes to the

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:13.690 
the electricity and it goes to the
controller<00:02:11.510> here<00:02:11.840> charge<00:02:12.410> controller<00:02:12.860> so

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
controller here charge controller so

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.090 
controller here charge controller so
comes<00:02:14.060> in<00:02:14.240> from<00:02:14.420> the<00:02:14.510> solar<00:02:14.750> panel<00:02:15.170> goes<00:02:15.950> down

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
comes in from the solar panel goes down

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:24.790 
comes in from the solar panel goes down
to<00:02:16.250> the<00:02:16.340> battery<00:02:16.700> and<00:02:20.590> down<00:02:21.590> here<00:02:21.950> I<00:02:22.220> have<00:02:23.800> two

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800
