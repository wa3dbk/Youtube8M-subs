today's<00:00:01.260> lesson<00:00:01.740> is<00:00:01.829> going<00:00:02.010> to<00:00:02.070> deal<00:00:02.250> with<00:00:02.280> the

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:02.550 
today's lesson is going to deal with the

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:04.280 
today's lesson is going to deal with the
differences<00:00:02.939> between<00:00:03.179> prokaryotic<00:00:04.049> and

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.290 
differences between prokaryotic and

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.470 
differences between prokaryotic and
eukaryotic<00:00:04.410> cells<00:00:05.160> and<00:00:05.370> before<00:00:05.910> we<00:00:06.029> begin<00:00:06.299> we

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
eukaryotic cells and before we begin we

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.480 
eukaryotic cells and before we begin we
do<00:00:06.660> want<00:00:06.899> to<00:00:06.960> review<00:00:07.319> the<00:00:07.680> three<00:00:07.950> parts<00:00:08.250> of<00:00:08.429> the

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
do want to review the three parts of the

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.879 
do want to review the three parts of the
cell<00:00:08.730> theory<00:00:08.970> cell<00:00:09.900> theory<00:00:10.139> has<00:00:10.349> three<00:00:10.620> parts

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
cell theory cell theory has three parts

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.700 
cell theory cell theory has three parts
one<00:00:11.580> all<00:00:11.940> living<00:00:12.900> things<00:00:12.929> are<00:00:13.290> made<00:00:13.320> up<00:00:13.559> of

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
one all living things are made up of

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.269 
one all living things are made up of
cells<00:00:13.950> to<00:00:14.790> the<00:00:15.509> cell<00:00:15.929> is<00:00:16.289> the<00:00:16.590> basic<00:00:16.619> unit<00:00:16.949> of

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
cells to the cell is the basic unit of

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.720 
cells to the cell is the basic unit of
life<00:00:17.520> and<00:00:17.760> 3<00:00:18.660> all<00:00:18.930> cells<00:00:19.920> come<00:00:20.130> from<00:00:20.369> other

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
life and 3 all cells come from other

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.509 
life and 3 all cells come from other
cells<00:00:21.119> so<00:00:22.080> as<00:00:22.260> you<00:00:22.410> begin<00:00:22.529> today<00:00:22.920> we<00:00:23.250> want<00:00:23.460> to

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
cells so as you begin today we want to

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.120 
cells so as you begin today we want to
find<00:00:23.670> out<00:00:23.820> what<00:00:24.180> do<00:00:24.359> all<00:00:24.600> cells<00:00:25.439> have<00:00:25.800> in

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
find out what do all cells have in

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.240 
find out what do all cells have in
common<00:00:26.369> well<00:00:27.210> number<00:00:27.420> one<00:00:27.920> is<00:00:28.920> they're<00:00:29.099> going

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
common well number one is they're going

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.470 
common well number one is they're going
to<00:00:29.400> have<00:00:29.519> DNA<00:00:29.880> and<00:00:30.840> remember<00:00:31.500> DNA<00:00:32.279> is<00:00:32.610> the

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
to have DNA and remember DNA is the

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.270 
to have DNA and remember DNA is the
instructions<00:00:34.410> for<00:00:34.680> life<00:00:35.660> and<00:00:36.660> it's<00:00:37.110> in

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.280 
instructions for life and it's in

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.790 
instructions for life and it's in
exactly<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.550> instructions<00:00:39.180> for<00:00:39.480> making

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 
exactly the instructions for making

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.580 
exactly the instructions for making
proteins<00:00:41.570> proteins<00:00:42.570> are<00:00:42.719> vital<00:00:43.140> especially

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
proteins proteins are vital especially

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.729 
proteins proteins are vital especially
the<00:00:44.129> enzyme<00:00:44.640> version<00:00:45.149> of<00:00:45.329> proteins<00:00:45.870> the

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
the enzyme version of proteins the

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.500 
the enzyme version of proteins the
second<00:00:47.160> thing<00:00:47.370> that<00:00:47.399> all<00:00:47.730> cells<00:00:48.090> are<00:00:48.270> going<00:00:48.420> to

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
second thing that all cells are going to

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.729 
second thing that all cells are going to
have<00:00:48.780> is<00:00:49.500> a<00:00:49.559> cell<00:00:49.950> membrane<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:51.739> cell

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
have is a cell membrane the cell

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.709 
have is a cell membrane the cell
membrane<00:00:53.160> regulates<00:00:53.760> what<00:00:53.969> comes<00:00:54.270> in<00:00:54.570> and

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
membrane regulates what comes in and

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.950 
membrane regulates what comes in and
what<00:00:55.289> comes<00:00:55.469> out<00:00:55.710> of<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.399> cell<00:00:56.780> so<00:00:57.780> we're

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
what comes out of the cell so we're

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.869 
what comes out of the cell so we're
going<00:00:58.079> to<00:00:58.140> write<00:00:58.320> down<00:00:58.940> regulate<00:01:01.609> what<00:01:02.609> comes

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
going to write down regulate what comes

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.039 
going to write down regulate what comes
in<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:03.480> out<00:01:04.409> of<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.280> cell<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:06.450> third<00:01:06.750> thing

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
in and out of the cell the third thing

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.240 
in and out of the cell the third thing
is<00:01:07.110> going<00:01:07.439> to<00:01:07.530> be<00:01:07.710> ribosomes<00:01:10.100> ribosomes<00:01:11.100> are

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
is going to be ribosomes ribosomes are

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.219 
is going to be ribosomes ribosomes are
tiny<00:01:12.119> structures<00:01:12.659> you<00:01:12.810> remember<00:01:13.080> those<00:01:13.170> from

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
tiny structures you remember those from

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.820 
tiny structures you remember those from
chapter<00:01:13.710> 12<00:01:13.979> and<00:01:14.280> what<00:01:15.030> they<00:01:15.210> do<00:01:15.270> is<00:01:15.720> they<00:01:16.439> make

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
chapter 12 and what they do is they make

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.929 
chapter 12 and what they do is they make
the<00:01:17.400> proteins<00:01:19.340> every<00:01:20.340> cells<00:01:20.580> got<00:01:20.759> to<00:01:20.850> have

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
the proteins every cells got to have

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.280 
the proteins every cells got to have
proteins<00:01:21.360> they<00:01:21.450> got<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:21.720> have<00:01:21.810> their<00:01:21.930> enzymes

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
proteins they got to have their enzymes

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.499 
proteins they got to have their enzymes
to<00:01:22.560> control<00:01:22.860> their<00:01:23.040> chemistry<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:23.820> then<00:01:24.390> the

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
to control their chemistry and then the

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.539 
to control their chemistry and then the
fourth<00:01:24.780> thing<00:01:25.020> is<00:01:25.950> going<00:01:26.220> to<00:01:26.310> be<00:01:26.400> the

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
fourth thing is going to be the

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.560 
fourth thing is going to be the
cytoplasm<00:01:28.250> sometimes<00:01:29.250> you<00:01:29.400> just<00:01:29.430> see<00:01:30.420> it

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
cytoplasm sometimes you just see it

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.130 
cytoplasm sometimes you just see it
referred<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.170> as<00:01:31.380> fight<00:01:32.100> to<00:01:32.250> Saul<00:01:32.729> and<00:01:33.140> that's

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
referred to as fight to Saul and that's

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.660 
referred to as fight to Saul and that's
essentially<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.729> jelly<00:01:36.119> or<00:01:36.360> syrup<00:01:37.640> inside<00:01:38.640> a

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
essentially the jelly or syrup inside a

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.950 
essentially the jelly or syrup inside a
cell<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:40.820> that's<00:01:41.820> what<00:01:42.090> all<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.509> organelles

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
cell and that's what all the organelles

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.010 
cell and that's what all the organelles
are<00:01:43.170> going<00:01:43.320> to<00:01:43.380> be<00:01:43.439> floating<00:01:43.799> in<00:01:44.100> all<00:01:44.700> right

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
are going to be floating in all right

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.319 
are going to be floating in all right
cells<00:01:46.020> come<00:01:46.290> in<00:01:46.409> two<00:01:46.560> flavors<00:01:46.759> the<00:01:47.759> first<00:01:48.060> type

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
cells come in two flavors the first type

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.170 
cells come in two flavors the first type
is<00:01:48.540> called<00:01:48.780> a<00:01:48.960> prokaryotic<00:01:49.799> cell<00:01:49.920> in<00:01:50.490> a

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
is called a prokaryotic cell in a

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.960 
is called a prokaryotic cell in a
prokaryotic<00:01:51.630> cells<00:01:52.229> number<00:01:52.649> 1/4<00:01:53.610> actually

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
prokaryotic cells number 1/4 actually

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.910 
prokaryotic cells number 1/4 actually
there's<00:01:54.119> two<00:01:54.180> features<00:01:54.689> of<00:01:54.869> it<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.200> first<00:01:55.590> one

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
there's two features of it the first one

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.280 
there's two features of it the first one
being<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.159> most<00:01:56.340> important<00:01:57.290> prokaryotic

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
being the most important prokaryotic

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.959 
being the most important prokaryotic
cells<00:01:58.649> do<00:01:59.399> not<00:01:59.579> have<00:02:00.000> a<00:02:00.030> nucleus<00:02:00.390> and<00:02:01.969> they

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
cells do not have a nucleus and they

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.859 
cells do not have a nucleus and they
also<00:02:03.210> do<00:02:04.200> not<00:02:04.229> have<00:02:04.770> any<00:02:05.579> membrane<00:02:06.570> bound

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
also do not have any membrane bound

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.309 
also do not have any membrane bound
organelles<00:02:07.259> and<00:02:08.239> membrane<00:02:09.239> bound<00:02:09.420> means<00:02:09.840> that

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
organelles and membrane bound means that

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.619 
organelles and membrane bound means that
there's<00:02:10.500> a<00:02:10.590> membrane<00:02:11.400> that<00:02:11.670> goes<00:02:11.940> around<00:02:12.270> the

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
there's a membrane that goes around the

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:12.990 
there's a membrane that goes around the
or

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
or

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.200 
or
now<00:02:13.380> think<00:02:14.380> of<00:02:14.440> like<00:02:14.560> your<00:02:14.710> mitochondria<00:02:15.610> you

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210 
now think of like your mitochondria you

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:20.340 
now think of like your mitochondria you
nucleus<00:02:17.400> your<00:02:18.400> ers<00:02:19.150> although<00:02:19.810> those<00:02:20.020> have<00:02:20.320> a

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
nucleus your ers although those have a

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:23.070 
nucleus your ers although those have a
membrane<00:02:20.920> that<00:02:21.280> deals<00:02:21.490> with<00:02:21.640> them<00:02:21.820> okay<00:02:22.390> so

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
membrane that deals with them okay so

what<00:02:23.230> you<00:02:23.320> want<00:02:23.500> to<00:02:23.590> remember<00:02:23.770> and<00:02:24.160> this<00:02:24.280> is<00:02:24.460> a

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
what you want to remember and this is a

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:26.490 
what you want to remember and this is a
really<00:02:24.760> simple<00:02:24.880> way<00:02:25.090> to<00:02:25.120> remember<00:02:25.300> it<00:02:25.540> is<00:02:25.660> pro

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
really simple way to remember it is pro

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.730 
really simple way to remember it is pro
means<00:02:26.950> no<00:02:27.550> and<00:02:27.940> what<00:02:28.720> we<00:02:28.840> mean<00:02:29.020> by<00:02:29.080> no<00:02:29.290> is<00:02:30.660> no

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
means no and what we mean by no is no

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:39.060 
means no and what we mean by no is no
nucleus<00:02:33.810> and<00:02:35.010> no<00:02:36.270> organelles<00:02:37.500> no<00:02:38.500> membrane

nucleus and no organelles no membrane

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.630 
nucleus and no organelles no membrane
bound<00:02:39.250> organelles<00:02:40.830> so<00:02:41.830> let<00:02:42.040> me<00:02:42.100> get<00:02:42.250> caught<00:02:42.459> up

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
bound organelles so let me get caught up

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:51.630 
bound organelles so let me get caught up
here<00:02:43.260> no<00:02:44.260> membrane<00:02:44.680> bound<00:02:45.010> organelles<00:02:50.640> now

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
here no membrane bound organelles now

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.699 
here no membrane bound organelles now
anything<00:02:52.060> that<00:02:52.870> is<00:02:52.989> prokaryotic<00:02:54.360> is<00:02:55.500> known<00:02:56.500> as

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
anything that is prokaryotic is known as

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:01.610 
anything that is prokaryotic is known as
a<00:02:56.739> bacteria<00:02:58.170> so<00:02:59.170> prokaryotic<00:02:59.739> cells<00:03:00.300> equal

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
a bacteria so prokaryotic cells equal

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.180 
a bacteria so prokaryotic cells equal
bacteria<00:03:03.330> okay<00:03:04.709> pretty<00:03:05.709> simple<00:03:06.100> little

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
bacteria okay pretty simple little

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:07.820 
bacteria okay pretty simple little
concept<00:03:06.760> all<00:03:07.390> right

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
concept all right

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.650 
concept all right
eukaryotic<00:03:08.830> cells<00:03:09.250> are<00:03:09.520> just<00:03:10.360> the<00:03:10.540> opposite

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
eukaryotic cells are just the opposite

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:20.840 
eukaryotic cells are just the opposite
they<00:03:13.660> have<00:03:14.050> a<00:03:14.410> nucleus<00:03:14.920> and<00:03:19.230> they<00:03:20.230> have

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
they have a nucleus and they have

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:26.789 
they have a nucleus and they have
membrane<00:03:21.850> bound<00:03:22.060> organelles<00:03:22.420> like<00:03:25.650> in<00:03:26.650> the

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:26.799 
membrane bound organelles like in the

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:30.180 
membrane bound organelles like in the
mitochondria<00:03:28.380> if<00:03:29.380> you're<00:03:29.590> playing<00:03:29.920> you'll

mitochondria if you're playing you'll

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:31.920 
mitochondria if you're playing you'll
have<00:03:30.340> a<00:03:30.370> chloroplast<00:03:30.820> you<00:03:31.360> will<00:03:31.480> have<00:03:31.660> your

smooth and rough ers you'll have your

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.530 
smooth and rough ers you'll have your
Golgi<00:03:35.290> bodies<00:03:35.739> you'll<00:03:36.400> have<00:03:36.610> lysosomes<00:03:37.330> and

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
Golgi bodies you'll have lysosomes and

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.259 
Golgi bodies you'll have lysosomes and
vesicles<00:03:38.190> now<00:03:39.190> they<00:03:39.459> have<00:03:39.580> all<00:03:39.730> that<00:03:39.970> stuff

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:40.269 
vesicles now they have all that stuff

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:42.840 
vesicles now they have all that stuff
now<00:03:41.230> grey<00:03:41.470> wouldn't<00:03:41.739> remember<00:03:41.980> this<00:03:42.130> is<00:03:42.400> you

of biology as a prokaryotic Kingdom

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.679 
of biology as a prokaryotic Kingdom
there's<00:04:04.810> a<00:04:04.900> plant<00:04:05.319> kingdom<00:04:06.420> there's<00:04:07.420> an

00:04:07.679 --> 00:04:07.689 
there's a plant kingdom there's an

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:11.789 
there's a plant kingdom there's an
animal<00:04:08.200> kingdom<00:04:09.420> there's<00:04:10.420> a<00:04:10.510> fungus<00:04:11.260> kingdom

right when we were talking about earlier
about<00:05:01.720> cells<00:05:02.710> they're<00:05:03.310> very<00:05:03.669> small<00:05:04.090> and<00:05:04.389> you

00:05:04.439 --> 00:05:04.449 
about cells they're very small and you

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:07.409 
about cells they're very small and you
need<00:05:04.750> to<00:05:04.900> use<00:05:05.110> microscopes<00:05:05.860> to<00:05:06.340> see<00:05:06.550> them<00:05:06.789> and

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:07.419 
need to use microscopes to see them and

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:09.689 
need to use microscopes to see them and
there's<00:05:08.260> three<00:05:08.680> common<00:05:09.070> microscopes<00:05:09.610> that

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:12.190 
are used in science to look at cells the

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:16.740 
are used in science to look at cells the
first<00:05:12.430> one<00:05:12.729> is<00:05:13.260> the<00:05:14.260> compound<00:05:15.750> light

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:16.750 
first one is the compound light

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:20.779 
first one is the compound light
microscope<00:05:17.880> and<00:05:18.880> this<00:05:19.720> is<00:05:19.900> used<00:05:20.199> to<00:05:20.440> see

around<00:05:26.409> etc<00:05:27.150> but<00:05:28.150> it<00:05:28.270> does<00:05:28.449> have<00:05:28.659> limitations

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:30.330 
around etc but it does have limitations

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:36.510 
around etc but it does have limitations
it<00:05:31.330> can<00:05:31.630> only<00:05:31.780> magnify<00:05:33.570> the<00:05:34.570> maximum<00:05:35.520> right

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:36.520 
it can only magnify the maximum right

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:40.290 
it can only magnify the maximum right
around<00:05:36.909> a<00:05:37.240> thousand<00:05:37.930> times<00:05:38.490> okay<00:05:39.490> that's<00:05:40.030> this

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:40.300 
around a thousand times okay that's this

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:43.379 
around a thousand times okay that's this
biggest<00:05:40.750> limitation<00:05:41.440> is<00:05:41.590> it's<00:05:42.389> relatively

00:05:43.379 --> 00:05:43.389 
biggest limitation is it's relatively

00:05:43.389 --> 00:05:46.770 
biggest limitation is it's relatively
small<00:05:44.310> magnification<00:05:45.310> power<00:05:45.490> the<00:05:46.360> next<00:05:46.659> two

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:46.780 
small magnification power the next two

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:49.710 
small magnification power the next two
are<00:05:46.930> electron<00:05:47.349> microscopes<00:05:48.150> the<00:05:49.150> first<00:05:49.479> one

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:49.720 
are electron microscopes the first one

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:52.820 
are electron microscopes the first one
is<00:05:49.900> called<00:05:50.110> a<00:05:50.349> transmission<00:05:51.130> electron

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:52.830 
is called a transmission electron

00:05:52.830 --> 00:06:00.089 
is called a transmission electron
microscope<00:05:54.659> and<00:05:55.949> it<00:05:56.949> is<00:05:57.099> known<00:05:57.310> as<00:05:57.520> a<00:05:57.550> T<00:05:58.000> e<00:05:59.099> m4

short spell transmission okay and what

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:06.870 
short spell transmission okay and what
this<00:06:03.490> does<00:06:03.759> is<00:06:04.270> gives<00:06:05.169> you<00:06:05.880> two-dimensional

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:06.880 
this does is gives you two-dimensional

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.060 
this does is gives you two-dimensional
view

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:09.070

the<00:06:34.670> object<00:06:35.300> so<00:06:37.990> this<00:06:38.990> is<00:06:39.170> great<00:06:39.500> for<00:06:39.710> looking

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:39.860 
the object so this is great for looking

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:43.060 
the object so this is great for looking
at<00:06:40.190> the<00:06:40.430> outside<00:06:41.000> of<00:06:41.060> the<00:06:41.300> cell<00:06:41.630> you<00:06:42.590> see<00:06:42.800> this

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:43.070 
at the outside of the cell you see this

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:44.740 
at the outside of the cell you see this
often<00:06:43.310> used<00:06:43.670> to<00:06:43.850> look<00:06:44.030> at<00:06:44.120> the<00:06:44.210> outsides<00:06:44.600> of

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:44.750 
often used to look at the outsides of

hang set insects or a fly's wings okay

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:49.750 
hang set insects or a fly's wings okay
both<00:06:47.840> of<00:06:47.870> these<00:06:48.170> guys<00:06:48.440> they<00:06:49.190> can<00:06:49.370> magnify

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:49.760 
both of these guys they can magnify

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:52.860 
both of these guys they can magnify
things<00:06:50.680> hundreds<00:06:51.680> of<00:06:51.830> thousands<00:06:52.430> of<00:06:52.520> times

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:52.870 
things hundreds of thousands of times

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:56.440 
things hundreds of thousands of times
which<00:06:53.870> is<00:06:53.900> a<00:06:54.080> huge<00:06:54.590> benefit<00:06:55.190> they<00:06:55.880> also<00:06:56.120> the

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:56.450 
which is a huge benefit they also the

00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:58.810 
which is a huge benefit they also the
only<00:06:56.660> problem<00:06:57.080> is<00:06:57.320> is<00:06:57.530> that<00:06:58.040> electron

00:06:58.810 --> 00:06:58.820 
only problem is is that electron

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:01.000 
only problem is is that electron
microscopes<00:06:59.540> this<00:07:00.200> is<00:07:00.350> this<00:07:00.500> is<00:07:00.680> really<00:07:00.920> the

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:01.010 
microscopes this is this is really the

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:04.000 
microscopes this is this is really the
one<00:07:01.220> drawback<00:07:01.900> the<00:07:02.900> electron<00:07:03.290> microscopes

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:04.010 
one drawback the electron microscopes

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:06.130 
one drawback the electron microscopes
can<00:07:04.940> they're<00:07:05.450> going<00:07:05.630> to<00:07:05.690> be<00:07:05.780> used<00:07:05.990> on

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:06.140 
can they're going to be used on

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:10.390 
can they're going to be used on
nonliving<00:07:08.290> because<00:07:09.290> in<00:07:09.620> the<00:07:09.740> preparation

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:10.400 
nonliving because in the preparation

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:13.030 
nonliving because in the preparation
process<00:07:10.970> to<00:07:11.180> see<00:07:11.390> these<00:07:11.630> images<00:07:12.110> to<00:07:12.650> coated

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:13.040 
process to see these images to coated

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:15.820 
process to see these images to coated
with<00:07:13.190> a<00:07:13.220> metal<00:07:13.670> it<00:07:14.540> happens<00:07:14.870> in<00:07:14.990> a<00:07:15.080> vacuum<00:07:15.230> and

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:15.830 
with a metal it happens in a vacuum and

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:18.550 
with a metal it happens in a vacuum and
that<00:07:16.370> those<00:07:16.760> two<00:07:16.790> things<00:07:17.030> will<00:07:17.930> kill<00:07:18.290> the

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:18.560 
that those two things will kill the

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:21.460 
that those two things will kill the
object<00:07:19.130> but<00:07:19.580> you<00:07:19.640> do<00:07:20.060> get<00:07:20.270> very<00:07:20.330> very<00:07:21.260> good

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:21.470 
object but you do get very very good

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:23.890 
object but you do get very very good
pictures<00:07:22.250> of<00:07:22.460> them<00:07:22.610> so<00:07:22.880> that's<00:07:23.450> your<00:07:23.690> you<00:07:23.810> know

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:23.900 
pictures of them so that's your you know

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:26.080 
pictures of them so that's your you know
yes<00:07:24.140> you're<00:07:24.290> a<00:07:24.350> little<00:07:24.530> trade-off<00:07:24.800> alright<00:07:25.550> so

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:26.090 
yes you're a little trade-off alright so

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:29.170 
yes you're a little trade-off alright so
when<00:07:26.240> you<00:07:26.300> review<00:07:27.370> the<00:07:28.370> four<00:07:28.640> things<00:07:28.850> that<00:07:29.000> all

00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:29.180 
when you review the four things that all

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:33.870 
when you review the four things that all
cells<00:07:29.480> have<00:07:29.570> in<00:07:29.840> common<00:07:30.490> DNA<00:07:32.080> cell<00:07:33.080> membranes

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:33.880 
cells have in common DNA cell membranes

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:38.140 
cells have in common DNA cell membranes
ribosomes<00:07:34.880> the<00:07:35.570> cytoplasm<00:07:36.200> are<00:07:36.730> the<00:07:37.730> other

00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:38.150 
ribosomes the cytoplasm are the other

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:40.990 
ribosomes the cytoplasm are the other
thing<00:07:38.950> then<00:07:39.950> the<00:07:40.130> other<00:07:40.280> thing<00:07:40.400> we<00:07:40.520> want<00:07:40.730> over

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:41.000 
thing then the other thing we want over

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.970 
thing then the other thing we want over
was<00:07:41.210> the<00:07:41.450> difference<00:07:41.810> between<00:07:41.980> prokaryotes

00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:42.980 
was the difference between prokaryotes

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:46.990 
was the difference between prokaryotes
and<00:07:43.490> eukaryotes<00:07:45.430> prokaryotes<00:07:46.430> have<00:07:46.760> no

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:47.000 
and eukaryotes prokaryotes have no

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.150

just<00:07:49.910> remember<00:07:50.300> that<00:07:50.450> pro<00:07:50.780> means<00:07:51.050> no<00:07:51.350> no

00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:52.100 
just remember that pro means no no

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:54.159 
just remember that pro means no no
nucleus<00:07:52.580> and<00:07:52.760> no<00:07:52.850> organelles<00:07:53.390> and<00:07:53.930> we<00:07:54.020> know

00:07:54.159 --> 00:07:54.169 
nucleus and no organelles and we know

00:07:54.169 --> 00:07:58.060 
nucleus and no organelles and we know
those<00:07:54.260> better<00:07:54.560> is<00:07:54.770> bacteria<00:07:55.340> a<00:07:56.740> eukaryote<00:07:57.740> is

those better is bacteria a eukaryote is

00:07:58.070 --> 00:07:59.080 
those better is bacteria a eukaryote is
just<00:07:58.310> the<00:07:58.430> opposite

00:07:59.080 --> 00:07:59.090
