00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:10.699
 Hi, I 'm going to show you how you can 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:14.459
 makeup paint your nails hands 

00:00:10.699 --> 00:00:21.800
 precious what we need is a base 

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:27.650
 for colored nails 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:27.650
 and a pencil but with rubber and a pin 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:41.090
 I fit in the rubber band of the pencil 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:42.750
 and so we leave it now we put the 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:46.550
 base 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.550
 make it transparent 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.809
 and let it dry little 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:59.080
 in my life 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:05.040
 this and we paint the nail of the nails 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:05.040
 of the color that you want 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:10.060
 Seeing how it looks like this does not dry 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.560
 good 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:22.430
 because the color is not so pure so 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:26.330
 powerful 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:29.630
 and now we hold the pencil with rubber and 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:32.890
 we clean well with our finger and 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.890
 grabbing a nail polish 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.370
 and friends 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.479
 we will change 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.160
 and now 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:54.530
 we do this 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:56.940
 put the pin ContÃ­n 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:00.170
 t 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.170
 or like you 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.510
 and we do dots 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:16.440
 as I have left the unit 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:20.120
 you can do it with all I hope 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.120
 that you liked dancing
