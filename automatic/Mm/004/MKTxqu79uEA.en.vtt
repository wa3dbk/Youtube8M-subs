00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
then it becomes more snug I guess what

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.260 
then it becomes more snug I guess what

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
does it's just for the plane you know

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:06.889 
does it's just for the plane you know
that's<00:02:06.450> what<00:02:06.630> it<00:02:06.719> is

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899

this headset was only like 40 quid I

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.250 
this headset was only like 40 quid I
can't<00:02:18.410> believe<00:02:18.680> it<00:02:18.860> sometimes<00:02:19.100> it's<00:02:19.580> amazing

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
can't believe it sometimes it's amazing

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.260 
can't believe it sometimes it's amazing
anyway<00:02:21.260> that's<00:02:21.500> that's<00:02:22.400> if<00:02:22.640> you<00:02:22.730> want<00:02:22.760> it<00:02:22.970> into

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 
anyway that's that's if you want it into

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:26.320 
anyway that's that's if you want it into
like<00:02:23.569> a<00:02:23.600> big<00:02:24.080> stereo<00:02:24.920> speaker<00:02:25.250> I<00:02:25.280> think<00:02:25.580> or<00:02:25.910> for

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
like a big stereo speaker I think or for

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.449 
like a big stereo speaker I think or for
studio<00:02:26.660> work<00:02:26.900> and<00:02:27.470> then<00:02:27.860> you<00:02:27.920> just<00:02:28.100> plug<00:02:28.280> it<00:02:28.430> on

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
studio work and then you just plug it on

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:31.960 
studio work and then you just plug it on
the<00:02:28.580> end<00:02:28.700> of<00:02:28.870> this<00:02:29.870> one<00:02:30.310> so<00:02:31.310> you<00:02:31.610> know<00:02:31.730> it's

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
the end of this one so you know it's

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.180 
the end of this one so you know it's
that<00:02:32.180> simple<00:02:32.360> and<00:02:32.630> then<00:02:33.380> that's<00:02:33.800> the<00:02:33.860> cable

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
that simple and then that's the cable

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.100 
that simple and then that's the cable
which<00:02:34.280> comes<00:02:34.520> with<00:02:34.640> it<00:02:34.790> I<00:02:34.910> made<00:02:35.630> a<00:02:35.660> few

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
which comes with it I made a few

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:37.270 
which comes with it I made a few
modifications

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
modifications

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.240 
modifications
I<00:02:37.370> took<00:02:37.459> the<00:02:37.880> jam<00:02:38.150> box<00:02:38.300> cable<00:02:38.780> instead<00:02:39.260> because

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
I took the jam box cable instead because

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.860 
I took the jam box cable instead because
it's<00:02:40.400> more<00:02:40.730> untangled<00:02:41.630> and<00:02:41.840> it's<00:02:42.830> more<00:02:43.130> for

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
it's more untangled and it's more for

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.630 
it's more untangled and it's more for
portable<00:02:44.870> use<00:02:44.900> I<00:02:45.380> guess<00:02:45.650> but<00:02:46.010> this<00:02:46.190> is<00:02:46.370> this<00:02:46.580> is

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
portable use I guess but this is this is

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.370 
portable use I guess but this is this is
just<00:02:46.790> fine<00:02:47.150> I<00:02:47.180> can<00:02:47.480> still<00:02:47.720> plug<00:02:47.900> it<00:02:48.110> into<00:02:48.290> my

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
just fine I can still plug it into my

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.800 
just fine I can still plug it into my
laptop<00:02:48.560> this<00:02:48.920> one<00:02:49.130> and<00:02:49.370> then<00:02:50.060> still<00:02:50.420> use<00:02:50.600> the

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
laptop this one and then still use the

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.500 
laptop this one and then still use the
jam<00:02:51.140> box<00:02:51.380> as<00:02:52.250> well<00:02:52.550> for<00:02:52.880> listening<00:02:53.360> to<00:02:53.420> my

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
my laptop in the background I still

really good anyway let me just unfold
these<00:03:08.060> I'll<00:03:08.360> see<00:03:08.540> if<00:03:08.630> I<00:03:08.660> can<00:03:08.780> do<00:03:08.870> it<00:03:08.959> with<00:03:09.050> one

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.080 
these I'll see if I can do it with one

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:13.420 
these I'll see if I can do it with one
hand<00:03:09.260> oh<00:03:11.290> they<00:03:12.290> go<00:03:12.530> they're<00:03:12.769> very<00:03:13.130> tight

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
hand oh they go they're very tight

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.400

that's<00:03:13.760> the<00:03:13.910> only<00:03:14.120> thing<00:03:14.330> but<00:03:15.050> you<00:03:15.110> get<00:03:15.290> used

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
that's the only thing but you get used

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:17.500 
that's the only thing but you get used
to<00:03:15.530> it<00:03:15.620> exclusive<00:03:16.519> very<00:03:16.760> portable<00:03:17.030> I<00:03:17.299> guess

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
to it exclusive very portable I guess

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.360 
to it exclusive very portable I guess
what<00:03:18.410> I'll<00:03:18.500> do<00:03:18.680> is<00:03:18.799> I'll<00:03:18.920> play<00:03:19.070> some<00:03:19.250> music

what I'll do is I'll play some music

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:21.400 
what I'll do is I'll play some music

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
because they're so tight they sound like

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:22.960 
because they're so tight they sound like
someone's<00:03:21.890> wearing<00:03:22.280> them<00:03:22.400> on<00:03:22.519> the<00:03:22.640> head<00:03:22.820> for

someone's wearing them on the head for
example<00:03:23.090> and<00:03:24.100> or<00:03:25.100> or<00:03:25.459> it<00:03:25.670> can<00:03:25.820> video<00:03:26.750> of<00:03:26.870> my

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:27.049 
example and or or it can video of my

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:28.900 
example and or or it can video of my
laptop<00:03:27.260> but<00:03:27.620> it<00:03:27.680> depends<00:03:28.190> on<00:03:28.280> what<00:03:28.459> you<00:03:28.640> what

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:28.910

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:33.829 
I'll just plug them in and then you can

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:35.229 
I'll just plug them in and then you can
hear<00:03:34.010> them<00:03:34.100> in<00:03:34.250> the<00:03:34.489> background<00:03:34.519> that's<00:03:35.060> all

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
hear them in the background that's all

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:38.440 
hear them in the background that's all
and<00:03:36.220> yeah<00:03:37.220> I<00:03:37.250> guess<00:03:37.400> that's<00:03:37.700> a<00:03:38.090> simple<00:03:38.329> thing

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
and yeah I guess that's a simple thing

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:42.130 
and yeah I guess that's a simple thing
to<00:03:38.570> do<00:03:38.720> so<00:03:39.470> there<00:03:39.620> we<00:03:39.680> go<00:03:39.709> and<00:03:40.989> that's<00:03:41.989> what

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.140 
to do so there we go and that's what

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.199 
to do so there we go and that's what
they<00:03:42.230> look<00:03:42.410> like<00:03:42.470> so<00:03:43.100> let<00:03:43.549> me<00:03:43.640> show<00:03:43.940> you<00:03:43.970> that

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:44.209 
they look like so let me show you that

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:46.900 
they look like so let me show you that
there's<00:03:44.750> the<00:03:44.930> power<00:03:45.140> when<00:03:46.100> it<00:03:46.190> comes<00:03:46.400> on<00:03:46.640> and

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:46.910 
there's the power when it comes on and

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:49.360 
there's the power when it comes on and
then<00:03:47.030> if<00:03:47.150> I<00:03:47.239> turn<00:03:47.450> on<00:03:47.829> that's<00:03:48.829> all<00:03:49.040> it<00:03:49.160> does

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
then if I turn on that's all it does

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.180 
then if I turn on that's all it does
that's<00:03:49.850> just<00:03:50.239> a<00:03:50.360> tiny<00:03:50.650> on/off<00:03:51.650> switch<00:03:51.920> there

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190 
that's just a tiny on/off switch there

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.490 
that's just a tiny on/off switch there
that's<00:03:52.430> the<00:03:52.549> audio<00:03:52.820> jack<00:03:53.120> they<00:03:53.810> feel<00:03:53.989> really

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
that's the audio jack they feel really

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.890 
that's the audio jack they feel really
high-quality<00:03:54.680> actually<00:03:55.459> I<00:03:55.700> mean<00:03:56.150> there<00:03:56.660> was<00:03:56.840> a

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
high-quality actually I mean there was a

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:00.970 
high-quality actually I mean there was a
small<00:03:57.410> tiny<00:03:58.299> dent<00:03:59.299> which<00:03:59.630> you<00:03:59.750> can<00:03:59.930> barely<00:04:00.470> see

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 
small tiny dent which you can barely see

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.880 
small tiny dent which you can barely see
right<00:04:01.370> there<00:04:01.880> but<00:04:02.840> I<00:04:03.049> mean<00:04:03.140> that's<00:04:03.709> that

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:03.890 
right there but I mean that's that

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:06.190 
right there but I mean that's that
everything<00:04:04.820> I'm<00:04:04.970> hearing<00:04:05.329> eventually<00:04:05.870> gets<00:04:06.079> a

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:06.200 
everything I'm hearing eventually gets a

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.890 
everything I'm hearing eventually gets a
dent<00:04:06.500> or<00:04:06.680> scratch<00:04:06.739> on<00:04:07.340> it<00:04:07.459> as<00:04:07.850> many<00:04:08.660> people

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
dent or scratch on it as many people

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.620 
dent or scratch on it as many people
probably<00:04:09.410> know<00:04:09.609> so<00:04:10.609> yeah<00:04:10.790> they're<00:04:11.090> really

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:11.630 
probably know so yeah they're really

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:14.289 
probably know so yeah they're really
they<00:04:11.870> look<00:04:11.989> really<00:04:12.380> nice<00:04:12.910> and<00:04:13.910> then<00:04:14.030> the<00:04:14.150> noise

00:04:14.289 --> 00:04:14.299 
they look really nice and then the noise

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:16.409 
they look really nice and then the noise
canceling<00:04:14.930> wow<00:04:15.200> they<00:04:15.440> are<00:04:15.470> really<00:04:15.890> good<00:04:16.070> and

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:16.419 
canceling wow they are really good and

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:19.060 
canceling wow they are really good and
they<00:04:17.419> are<00:04:17.539> adjustable<00:04:17.930> obviously<00:04:18.530> as<00:04:18.680> usual

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
they are adjustable obviously as usual

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.219 
they are adjustable obviously as usual
but<00:04:19.729> you<00:04:20.000> know<00:04:20.090> if<00:04:20.180> you<00:04:20.299> got<00:04:20.419> a<00:04:20.479> pretty<00:04:21.049> big

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460 
any head but some people might complain

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.790 
any head but some people might complain
on<00:04:37.640> that<00:04:37.790> I<00:04:37.820> personally<00:04:38.720> wouldn't<00:04:39.050> really

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
on that I personally wouldn't really

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.310 
on that I personally wouldn't really
good<00:04:39.950> and<00:04:40.660> and<00:04:41.660> it's<00:04:42.020> also<00:04:42.170> really

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.320 
good and and it's also really

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.080 
good and and it's also really
comfortable<00:04:43.010> because<00:04:43.460> they're<00:04:43.820> kind<00:04:44.030> of

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090 
comfortable because they're kind of

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:46.180 
comfortable because they're kind of
tight<00:04:44.360> but<00:04:44.660> they're<00:04:45.020> so<00:04:45.290> comfortable<00:04:45.650> after<00:04:46.160> a

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 
tight but they're so comfortable after a

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:48.040 
tight but they're so comfortable after a
while<00:04:46.400> you<00:04:46.610> really<00:04:46.940> get<00:04:47.060> used<00:04:47.210> to<00:04:47.360> it<00:04:47.540> that's

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
while you really get used to it that's

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:49.450 
while you really get used to it that's
what<00:04:48.230> helps<00:04:48.470> with<00:04:48.530> noise<00:04:48.770> counseling<00:04:49.310> as<00:04:49.400> well

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:49.460 
what helps with noise counseling as well

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:52.510 
what helps with noise counseling as well
if<00:04:49.670> they're<00:04:49.850> really<00:04:50.210> tight<00:04:50.450> fit<00:04:50.690> so<00:04:50.980> all<00:04:51.980> I'm

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:08.270 
mic with this in the background so

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:11.320 
mic with this in the background so
that's<00:05:08.420> what<00:05:08.540> they<00:05:08.630> look<00:05:08.780> like<00:05:08.810> and<00:05:10.120> hang<00:05:11.120> like

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.260 
that's what they look like and hang like
this<00:05:11.510> I<00:05:11.660> guess<00:05:11.870> and<00:05:12.380> you<00:05:12.410> fold<00:05:12.950> them<00:05:13.040> up<00:05:13.270> for

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:14.270 
this I guess and you fold them up for

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:17.320 
this I guess and you fold them up for
traveling<00:05:15.200> and<00:05:15.890> also<00:05:16.280> don't<00:05:16.550> don't<00:05:17.060> do<00:05:17.270> that

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:17.330 
traveling and also don't don't do that

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:21.040 
traveling and also don't don't do that
be<00:05:17.960> bit<00:05:18.200> careful<00:05:18.590> with<00:05:18.680> them<00:05:18.890> these<00:05:20.050> treat

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.050 
be bit careful with them these treat

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.110 
be bit careful with them these treat
them<00:05:21.230> like<00:05:21.260> they<00:05:21.530> are<00:05:21.560> 200<00:05:22.460> pounds<00:05:22.850> that's<00:05:22.970> the

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:23.120 
them like they are 200 pounds that's the

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.240 
them like they are 200 pounds that's the
best<00:05:23.300> thing<00:05:23.480> to<00:05:23.510> say<00:05:23.810> but<00:05:24.110> they<00:05:24.320> are<00:05:24.620> only<00:05:24.800> 40

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:25.250 
best thing to say but they are only 40

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:26.620 
best thing to say but they are only 40
so<00:05:25.550> you<00:05:25.610> could<00:05:25.820> like<00:05:25.970> buy<00:05:26.150> another<00:05:26.390> pair

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:26.630 
so you could like buy another pair

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:29.110 
so you could like buy another pair
honestly<00:05:27.310> anyway<00:05:28.310> treat<00:05:28.700> the<00:05:28.790> treat<00:05:28.940> them

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:29.120

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.510 
honestly anyway treat the treat them
well<00:05:29.240> but<00:05:29.420> anyway<00:05:29.590> I'll<00:05:30.590> switch<00:05:30.890> over<00:05:31.040> to<00:05:31.250> me

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:31.520
