unboxing of the HG St basically the
Hitachi<00:00:10.559> travel<00:00:11.400> star<00:00:11.690> z7k<00:00:12.690> 500<00:00:13.290> this<00:00:13.740> one

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
Hitachi travel star z7k 500 this one

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.680 
Hitachi travel star z7k 500 this one
comes<00:00:14.580> at<00:00:15.199> 7,200<00:00:16.199> rpm<00:00:16.680> and<00:00:17.539> interesting<00:00:18.539> thing

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
comes at 7,200 rpm and interesting thing

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.599 
comes at 7,200 rpm and interesting thing
about<00:00:18.900> this<00:00:19.080> is<00:00:19.350> it's<00:00:19.560> single<00:00:19.980> platter<00:00:20.220> and

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
about this is it's single platter and

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.929 
about this is it's single platter and
also<00:00:21.390> sad<00:00:22.080> a<00:00:22.109> three<00:00:22.590> or<00:00:22.800> six<00:00:23.400> gigabits<00:00:23.820> per

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
also sad a three or six gigabits per

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.390 
also sad a three or six gigabits per
second<00:00:24.449> I<00:00:24.630> saw<00:00:25.080> this<00:00:25.289> as<00:00:25.470> a<00:00:25.500> shell<00:00:25.920> shock<00:00:26.160> on

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
second I saw this as a shell shock on

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.099 
second I saw this as a shell shock on
Newegg<00:00:26.730> one<00:00:26.910> day<00:00:27.060> and<00:00:27.210> I<00:00:27.269> thought<00:00:27.300> well<00:00:27.720> why

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
Newegg one day and I thought well why

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:28.400 
Newegg one day and I thought well why
not

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
not

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.460 
not
anyways<00:00:28.800> this<00:00:29.010> is<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.490> first<00:00:29.929> 7200<00:00:30.929> rpm

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
anyways this is the first 7200 rpm

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.130 
anyways this is the first 7200 rpm
magnetic<00:00:32.250> drive<00:00:32.489> that<00:00:32.910> is<00:00:33.180> that<00:00:33.660> comes<00:00:33.809> in<00:00:34.020> the

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
magnetic drive that is that comes in the

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.380 
magnetic drive that is that comes in the
form<00:00:34.350> factor<00:00:34.530> of<00:00:34.890> seven<00:00:35.280> millimeters<00:00:35.820> I<00:00:36.000> will

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
form factor of seven millimeters I will

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.350 
form factor of seven millimeters I will
show<00:00:36.660> you<00:00:36.719> how<00:00:37.469> thin<00:00:38.219> this<00:00:38.430> thing<00:00:38.670> really<00:00:38.940> is<00:00:39.149> I

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
show you how thin this thing really is I

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.060 
show you how thin this thing really is I
was<00:00:39.540> completely<00:00:40.079> amazed<00:00:40.500> I'll<00:00:40.800> show<00:00:41.040> some

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
was completely amazed I'll show some

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.639 
was completely amazed I'll show some
comparisons<00:00:42.030> later<00:00:42.270> in<00:00:42.540> addition<00:00:43.170> this<00:00:43.379> is

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
comparisons later in addition this is

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.799 
comparisons later in addition this is
the<00:00:44.010> first<00:00:44.370> six<00:00:44.760> gigabits<00:00:45.210> per<00:00:45.360> second

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
the first six gigabits per second

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.959 
the first six gigabits per second
interface<00:00:46.379> on<00:00:46.770> a<00:00:46.860> magnetic<00:00:47.280> drive<00:00:47.640> I<00:00:47.850> know

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
interface on a magnetic drive I know

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.700 
interface on a magnetic drive I know
some<00:00:48.329> of<00:00:48.360> you<00:00:48.510> may<00:00:48.660> be<00:00:48.690> saying<00:00:49.020> yeah<00:00:49.440> the

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
some of you may be saying yeah the

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.819 
some of you may be saying yeah the
Seagate<00:00:50.039> Momentis<00:00:50.610> XT<00:00:51.030> is<00:00:51.270> is<00:00:51.539> SATA<00:00:52.079> 6<00:00:52.379> but

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
Seagate Momentis XT is is SATA 6 but

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.520 
Seagate Momentis XT is is SATA 6 but
keep<00:00:53.190> in<00:00:53.340> mind<00:00:53.370> that<00:00:53.730> is<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.539> hybrid<00:00:54.899> drive<00:00:55.320> and

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
keep in mind that is a hybrid drive and

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.200 
keep in mind that is a hybrid drive and
this<00:00:55.620> one<00:00:55.770> is<00:00:55.890> not<00:00:56.039> this<00:00:56.309> one's<00:00:56.550> strictly

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
this one is not this one's strictly

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.090 
this one is not this one's strictly
magnetic<00:00:58.109> I<00:00:58.199> thought<00:00:58.469> this<00:00:58.620> would<00:00:58.829> be<00:00:58.890> an

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
magnetic I thought this would be an

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.680 
magnetic I thought this would be an
interesting<00:00:59.280> addition<00:01:00.120> to<00:01:00.149> my<00:01:00.329> macbook

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
interesting addition to my macbook

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.510 
interesting addition to my macbook
because<00:01:01.020> of<00:01:01.170> its<00:01:01.320> low<00:01:01.500> power<00:01:01.770> consumption<00:01:02.219> and

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
because of its low power consumption and

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.759 
because of its low power consumption and
its<00:01:02.789> stated<00:01:03.120> performance<00:01:03.960> we'll<00:01:04.350> find<00:01:04.589> out

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
its stated performance we'll find out

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.920 
its stated performance we'll find out
more<00:01:04.799> about<00:01:05.040> that<00:01:05.430> later<00:01:05.670> in<00:01:05.820> this<00:01:05.909> video<00:01:06.060> here

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
more about that later in this video here

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.990 
more about that later in this video here
you<00:01:06.960> can<00:01:07.200> see<00:01:07.409> just<00:01:07.619> how<00:01:07.950> thin<00:01:08.490> this<00:01:08.760> thing

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
you can see just how thin this thing

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.390 
you can see just how thin this thing
really<00:01:09.210> is<00:01:09.330> that<00:01:09.900> was<00:01:10.080> a<00:01:10.110> Samsung<00:01:10.619> 830<00:01:11.010> series

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
really is that was a Samsung 830 series

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.179 
really is that was a Samsung 830 series
SSD<00:01:11.939> and<00:01:12.150> this<00:01:12.299> is<00:01:12.510> a<00:01:12.540> Apple's<00:01:13.229> OAM<00:01:13.619> Drive<00:01:13.920> the

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
SSD and this is a Apple's OAM Drive the

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.580 
SSD and this is a Apple's OAM Drive the
OEM<00:01:14.520> drive<00:01:14.820> is<00:01:15.030> nine<00:01:15.270> point<00:01:15.630> five<00:01:15.780> millimeters

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
OEM drive is nine point five millimeters

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.530 
OEM drive is nine point five millimeters
in<00:01:16.830> don't<00:01:17.189> quote<00:01:17.340> me<00:01:17.490> on<00:01:17.520> that<00:01:17.610> I<00:01:17.939> may<00:01:18.240> be<00:01:18.299> wrong

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
in don't quote me on that I may be wrong

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.539 
in don't quote me on that I may be wrong
but<00:01:18.930> it<00:01:19.200> is<00:01:19.380> significantly<00:01:20.130> thinner

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
but it is significantly thinner

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.700 
but it is significantly thinner
I<00:01:20.640> know<00:01:20.759> 2.5<00:01:21.540> millimeters<00:01:22.110> isn't<00:01:22.470> too<00:01:22.560> much

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
I know 2.5 millimeters isn't too much

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.410 
I know 2.5 millimeters isn't too much
thinner<00:01:23.100> but<00:01:23.400> it<00:01:23.520> is<00:01:23.670> it<00:01:23.909> can<00:01:24.090> make<00:01:24.270> a<00:01:24.299> big

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
thinner but it is it can make a big

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.670 
thinner but it is it can make a big

isn't a very big deal to me I purchased
this<00:03:20.840> drive<00:03:21.139> because<00:03:21.440> it<00:03:21.620> was<00:03:21.799> cheap<00:03:22.069> and<00:03:22.280> the

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
this drive because it was cheap and the

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.360 
this drive because it was cheap and the

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.210 
promise that it is low power consumption
so<00:03:25.400> when<00:03:26.090> I'm<00:03:26.239> mobile<00:03:26.750> with<00:03:27.169> my<00:03:27.349> MacBook<00:03:27.739> Pro<00:03:27.980> I

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
so when I'm mobile with my MacBook Pro I

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.699 
so when I'm mobile with my MacBook Pro I
wanted<00:03:28.849> to<00:03:28.940> see<00:03:29.180> if<00:03:29.540> that<00:03:30.049> low<00:03:30.440> power

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:30.709 
wanted to see if that low power

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:32.680 
wanted to see if that low power
consumption<00:03:31.130> had<00:03:31.489> any<00:03:31.669> effect<00:03:32.060> on<00:03:32.180> my<00:03:32.329> battery

for<00:04:17.449> yourself<00:04:17.840> that<00:04:18.109> this<00:04:18.229> is<00:04:18.440> performing

00:04:18.999 --> 00:04:19.009 
for yourself that this is performing

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:24.169 
110 115 megabytes per second so if you

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:26.320

were looking for a solution that was

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.749 
were looking for a solution that was
fairly<00:04:26.810> fast<00:04:27.199> and<00:04:27.560> had<00:04:27.889> a<00:04:27.919> decent<00:04:28.280> amount<00:04:28.460> of

fairly fast and had a decent amount of

00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:30.369 
fairly fast and had a decent amount of
space<00:04:28.909> for<00:04:29.419> one<00:04:29.750> of<00:04:29.870> your<00:04:30.020> external

00:04:30.369 --> 00:04:30.379 
space for one of your external

00:04:30.379 --> 00:04:32.529 
space for one of your external
enclosures<00:04:31.190> I<00:04:31.430> think<00:04:31.729> this<00:04:31.879> might<00:04:32.060> take<00:04:32.419> the

00:04:32.529 --> 00:04:32.539 
enclosures I think this might take the

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:34.930 
enclosures I think this might take the
cake<00:04:32.569> one<00:04:33.020> thing<00:04:33.199> I<00:04:33.289> didn't<00:04:33.650> test<00:04:33.889> was<00:04:34.310> the

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:34.940 
cake one thing I didn't test was the

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:37.960 
cake one thing I didn't test was the
drives<00:04:35.240> throughput<00:04:35.780> the<00:04:36.139> Thunderbolt<00:04:37.039> I<00:04:37.639> may

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:37.970 
drives throughput the Thunderbolt I may

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:39.790 
drives throughput the Thunderbolt I may
test<00:04:38.240> that<00:04:38.449> but<00:04:38.659> it's<00:04:38.810> unlikely<00:04:39.319> as<00:04:39.530> this

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
test that but it's unlikely as this

that said I don't imagine that this

via Thunderbolt as USB 3 is a pretty
good<00:04:53.419> indication<00:04:54.139> of<00:04:54.409> how<00:04:54.500> this<00:04:54.650> drive<00:04:54.889> will

00:04:55.119 --> 00:04:55.129 
good indication of how this drive will

good indication of how this drive will
perform<00:04:55.430> on<00:04:55.909> that<00:04:56.300> platform

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:56.870 
perform on that platform

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:59.020 
perform on that platform
anyways<00:04:57.259> that<00:04:57.770> about<00:04:57.979> does<00:04:58.159> it<00:04:58.190> for<00:04:58.310> me<00:04:58.520> guys<00:04:58.759> I
