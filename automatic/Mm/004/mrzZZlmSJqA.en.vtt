00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 Hi there, this gameplay today 3 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.330
 weeks of projects decided to please us 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.259
 continuation in his famous series 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.019
 call of mini 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.139
 called dinah hunter this time we 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:15.089
 go on a real hunt for 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:17.180
 dinosaurs and since the main menu of the game 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.109
 is such a 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.420
 dynamic scene seeing 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.029
 camps in which there are various 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:27.029
 tents that are peculiar 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.080
 so say the menu items here are 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.029
 black market 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.759
 and the people on it you can buy 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.930
 various rare items a tavern where you 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:38.309
 you can hire all the characters in a hurry 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:41.190
 respectively your reserves are what you 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:44.850
 gathered up and then we have a section 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:48.230
 where you can pump your various 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:51.660
 skills for chat a place where you can 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:54.390
 make yourself a weapon here you need it 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.340
 craft they just buy it for you 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.960
 need to collect a certain 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:02.010
 the number of items after which you 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:04.790
 You can start to make it so but 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.439
 let's say I have one 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:10.320
 automatic and upgrade it 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:12.570
 we need to collect 9 such cops 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.909
 Naturally this all can be zadonatit for 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.150
 the crystals at the beginning of them are given a whole 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:21.090
 a thousand and in principle it seems likely 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:24.450
 many but still spend them once again 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:28.170
 I don't want to let them press them anyway 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:31.229
 still save the future further so 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.840
 go to the map section here on our 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.420
 The map will be such icons in 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.049
 for each mission we have 10 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.990
 assignments 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.939
 this let's kill the universe is finite 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:46.439
 dinosaurs hold on 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:49.350
 time to steal an egg and here's to fight 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:52.860
 giant dinosaur course section 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.990
 missions can be played but still the most 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.729
 great interest is still in 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.350
 this game 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:02.130
 cooperative mode and on it we are now 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.960
 right and see to start playing 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.700
 corporate mode naturally need 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.450
 Internet connection 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:13.010
 it happens fast enough waves 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:15.319
 faces two more partners here this time 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.540
 It seems to me I got ok if I 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:20.180
 now my eyes don't let me down 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.910
 it seemed that the level of one of 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.950
 dudes was pretty high we're in 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.360
 principle, we can and fill up this 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.030
 giant dinosaur 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.569
 and the essence of the corporate with an active game 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:34.430
 tom to defeat the giant dinosaur 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:37.250
 which now appears here he appeared 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.080
 and our goal is to destroy it and 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.239
 it is desirable to die on me 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.760
 but nevertheless if all the same I and 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:46.790
 I will die but my companions of all ski can 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:49.519
 his victory win counts and we 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:52.040
 let's divide accordingly yellow awards 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:54.170
 well for a certain share because all 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.390
 Equal to all equally here will not get 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:59.329
 you need to be careful of him he runs 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:01.549
 back and forth and trying to pull down like this 

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:04.220
 he does a lot of damage and 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:06.200
 need to be careful when i played up 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.390
 I came across this several times 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:12.530
 strong enough powerful companions 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:15.109
 who helped me cope with this 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:19.690
 gigantic dinosaurs i would get 

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:22.730
 thanks to them a lot of experience a lot of different 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:26.150
 objects and things with which I 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:28.010
 then he could crafts himself a weapon but like this 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.829
 here unfortunately I was nailed now 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:33.500
 there was only one of my partner, but I think with 

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:37.069
 this dinosaur he is now not alone 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:39.680
 cope and in the end they beat him 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:42.410
 and the mission will be completed you can leave 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.389
 arena either baptized you for 10 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:47.470
 crystals but in my opinion it is 

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:51.019
 cooperative mode will attract 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:54.620
 most people and therefore people will want 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:58.700
 play this game and hunt for 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:00.889
 There are such cool real dinosaurs here 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:03.260
 such a game accordingly 

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:05.799
 triniti interactive at present it 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.430
 three types of location green lawn 

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:09.030
 some avalanche 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:12.750
 lava more precisely 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:15.750
 terrain and glacial locations which I 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:17.100
 just had small dinosaurs of course 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:20.400
 easy to hold 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:23.040
 coins often fall out of them 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:25.800
 easier different plan if you 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:28.020
 like the game download if not then 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:32.180
 wait for my new releases and you 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:32.180
 sure to taste anything
