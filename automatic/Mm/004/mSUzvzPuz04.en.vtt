00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.630 
will settle in the future and I will
have<00:01:47.399> better<00:01:47.729> sounding<00:01:48.119> games<00:01:48.360> again<00:01:48.899> I<00:01:49.110> hope

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
have better sounding games again I hope

he<00:04:42.810> has<00:04:42.960> one<00:04:43.139> century<00:04:43.470> out<00:04:43.770> he<00:04:43.980> will<00:04:44.130> be<00:04:44.310> able

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
he has one century out he will be able

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.780 
he has one century out he will be able
to<00:04:44.610> block<00:04:44.940> off<00:04:45.210> and<00:04:45.449> hold<00:04:45.630> off<00:04:45.840> for<00:04:45.870> some<00:04:46.169> time

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:46.790 
to block off and hold off for some time

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:49.250 
to block off and hold off for some time
and<00:04:47.790> I<00:04:47.910> think<00:04:47.970> that<00:04:48.300> zealot<00:04:48.600> finally<00:04:49.080> just

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:49.260 
and I think that zealot finally just

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.320 
and I think that zealot finally just

immortals<00:05:44.040> in<00:05:44.130> the<00:05:44.220> field<00:05:44.490> those<00:05:44.729> stalkers

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:45.570 
immortals in the field those stalkers

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:46.909 
immortals in the field those stalkers
will<00:05:45.810> become<00:05:46.020> a<00:05:46.050> bit<00:05:46.229> of<00:05:46.260> a<00:05:46.350> liability<00:05:46.530> and

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:46.919 
will become a bit of a liability and

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:48.320 
will become a bit of a liability and
there<00:05:47.100> it<00:05:47.250> is<00:05:47.340> the<00:05:47.520> first<00:05:47.729> robotics<00:05:48.270> facility

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:48.330 
there it is the first robotics facility

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:50.990 
there it is the first robotics facility
coming<00:05:48.810> down<00:05:48.900> for<00:05:49.080> sock<00:05:49.550> in<00:05:50.550> cubic<00:05:50.850> hockey

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:51.000 
coming down for sock in cubic hockey

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.150 
coming down for sock in cubic hockey
instead<00:05:51.240> going<00:05:52.050> for<00:05:52.290> the<00:05:52.350> fast<00:05:52.500> expansion<00:05:52.949> so

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:53.160 
instead going for the fast expansion so

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:54.530 
instead going for the fast expansion so
we<00:05:53.220> are<00:05:53.400> seeing<00:05:53.639> some<00:05:53.820> divergence<00:05:54.270> and<00:05:54.419> some

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:54.540 
we are seeing some divergence and some

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:56.210 
we are seeing some divergence and some
early<00:05:54.780> aggression<00:05:55.050> so<00:05:55.290> we<00:05:55.410> will<00:05:55.560> not<00:05:55.740> have<00:05:56.010> a

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:56.220 
early aggression so we will not have a

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:59.990 
early aggression so we will not have a
painful<00:05:56.940> mirror<00:05:57.240> match<00:05:57.449> it<00:05:57.750> seems<00:05:58.729> full<00:05:59.729> only

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:00.000 
painful mirror match it seems full only

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.490 
painful mirror match it seems full only
for<00:06:00.270> stalkers<00:06:00.600> oh<00:06:01.020> and<00:06:01.500> these<00:06:02.130> stalkers<00:06:02.430> here

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:03.500 
for stalkers oh and these stalkers here

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:05.230 
for stalkers oh and these stalkers here
God<00:06:03.800> captured<00:06:04.310> so<00:06:04.430> those<00:06:04.580> went<00:06:04.790> down<00:06:04.940> as<00:06:05.060> well

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:05.240 
God captured so those went down as well

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.030 
God captured so those went down as well
so<00:06:05.330> I<00:06:05.390> think<00:06:05.480> in<00:06:05.900> fact<00:06:06.110> sock<00:06:06.440> is<00:06:06.650> actually

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:07.040 
so I think in fact sock is actually

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:09.250 
so I think in fact sock is actually
behind<00:06:07.160> he<00:06:07.640> has<00:06:07.670> lost<00:06:08.030> more<00:06:08.390> resources<00:06:08.990> in

behind he has lost more resources in

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:10.930 
behind he has lost more resources in
