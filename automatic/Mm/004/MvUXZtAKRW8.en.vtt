00:04:31.249 --> 00:04:31.259 
youtube and Jay went pretty good I want

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:32.450 
youtube and Jay went pretty good I want
to<00:04:31.320> make<00:04:31.410> a<00:04:31.440> separate<00:04:31.740> video<00:04:31.889> talking<00:04:32.190> about

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:35.750 
that but anyway so this really helped to

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:38.420 
that but anyway so this really helped to
make<00:04:36.750> those<00:04:36.930> acrylic<00:04:37.350> nails<00:04:37.530> as<00:04:37.740> good<00:04:37.949> as<00:04:38.190> I

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 
could so what comes with five different

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:47.080 
could so what comes with five different
pieces<00:04:43.740> so<00:04:44.520> this<00:04:44.789> is<00:04:44.820> one<00:04:45.090> of<00:04:45.120> them<00:04:45.330> is<00:04:45.960> another

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.090 
pieces so this is one of them is another

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:51.200 
pieces so this is one of them is another
there's<00:04:48.090> this<00:04:48.389> one<00:04:48.660> and<00:04:49.080> this<00:04:50.039> one<00:04:50.100> and<00:04:50.490> the

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.210 
there's this one and this one and the

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.140 
there's this one and this one and the
one<00:04:51.360> on<00:04:51.389> the<00:04:52.370> thing<00:04:53.370> at<00:04:53.490> the<00:04:53.580> moment<00:04:53.610> and<00:04:54.030> if

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.150

dentists Albert so this is really good
and<00:05:06.720> full<00:05:07.199> battery<00:05:07.560> operated<00:05:07.889> it<00:05:08.130> actually

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:08.490 
and full battery operated it actually

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:10.400 
and full battery operated it actually
does<00:05:08.669> have<00:05:08.880> a<00:05:08.910> fair<00:05:09.120> amount<00:05:09.150> of<00:05:09.449> power<00:05:09.660> like<00:05:10.110> I

was<00:05:11.190> worried<00:05:11.520> that<00:05:11.820> because<00:05:12.000> it's<00:05:12.210> battery

00:05:12.499 --> 00:05:12.509 
was worried that because it's battery

00:05:12.509 --> 00:05:14.210 
was worried that because it's battery
operated<00:05:12.539> it<00:05:13.080> would<00:05:13.199> be<00:05:13.289> really<00:05:13.440> slow<00:05:13.860> and<00:05:14.130> I

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:14.220 
operated it would be really slow and I

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:17.060 
operated it would be really slow and I
