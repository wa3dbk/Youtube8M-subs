00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
is here it is right here but and we'll

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.730 
is here it is right here but and we'll
take<00:01:33.119> snowballs<00:01:33.750> i'll<00:01:33.990> rename<00:01:34.259> these<00:01:34.470> later

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.740 
also but I know these won't be renamed
because<00:01:37.799> he's<00:01:37.890> won't<00:01:38.070> actually<00:01:38.220> be<00:01:38.540> able<00:01:39.540> to

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
because he's won't actually be able to

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.630 
because he's won't actually be able to
get<00:01:39.990> I<00:01:40.020> guess<00:01:40.680> cuz<00:01:40.890> they<00:01:40.979> did<00:01:41.100> your<00:01:41.340> shot

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
get I guess cuz they did your shot

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.940 
get I guess cuz they did your shot
directly<00:01:42.329> from<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.600> pistol<00:01:43.200> he<00:01:43.590> can't<00:01:43.799> zoom

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
directly from the pistol he can't zoom

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.270 
directly from the pistol he can't zoom
in<00:01:44.070> with<00:01:44.189> this

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
in with this

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.170 
in with this
turn<00:01:47.280> that<00:01:47.369> off<00:01:47.509> so<00:01:48.509> I<00:01:48.539> can<00:01:49.070> damn<00:01:50.070> jet<00:01:50.369> as<00:01:51.119> a

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
turn that off so I can damn jet as a

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.240 
turn that off so I can damn jet as a
fair<00:01:51.659> amount<00:01:51.719> of<00:01:51.869> recoil<00:01:52.020> but<00:01:52.439> it<00:01:52.530> says<00:01:53.009> a

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
fair amount of recoil but it says a

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.700 
fair amount of recoil but it says a
handcraft<00:01:53.789> digital<00:01:54.299> back<00:01:55.170> and<00:01:55.289> reload<00:01:55.500> it

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
handcraft digital back and reload it

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.249 
handcraft digital back and reload it
pressing<00:01:56.579> Q<00:01:57.649> they<00:01:58.649> can<00:01:58.799> drop<00:01:58.950> their<00:01:59.009> velocity

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:00.259 
pressing Q they can drop their velocity

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:03.020 
pressing Q they can drop their velocity
but<00:02:01.259> this<00:02:01.320> is<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:01.710> only<00:02:01.829> nice<00:02:02.670> little

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:48.770 
if i go here take a couple steps of

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.220 
if i go here take a couple steps of
clicks<00:02:49.070> it's<00:02:49.250> me<00:02:49.400> mostly<00:02:49.760> used<00:02:50.030> and<00:02:50.240> then<00:02:50.870> what

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
clicks it's me mostly used and then what

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.200

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:53.210 
was in other wards and then i think it

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:55.510 
was in other wards and then i think it
took<00:02:53.360> seeds<00:02:53.750> so<00:02:54.680> if<00:02:54.830> I<00:02:54.890> reload<00:02:55.100> to<00:02:55.280> flint

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:55.520

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.180 
yet how it's going to work but they're

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:43.730 
yet how it's going to work but they're
going<00:04:42.300> to<00:04:42.360> be<00:04:42.480> at<00:04:42.600> least<00:04:42.630> four<00:04:43.290> main<00:04:43.470> factions

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:21.360 
things that aren't actually being used

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.230 
things that aren't actually being used
so<00:05:21.900> I<00:05:22.250> just<00:05:23.250> basically<00:05:23.520> things<00:05:23.759> I'm<00:05:24.000> a<00:05:24.030> little

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240 
so I just basically things I'm a little

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.020 
so I just basically things I'm a little
too<00:05:24.300> much<00:05:24.449> you're<00:05:24.659> dealing<00:05:25.289> with<00:05:25.319> you<00:05:26.000> but<00:05:27.000> I

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:27.030 
too much you're dealing with you but I

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:28.460 
too much you're dealing with you but I
also<00:05:27.240> have<00:05:27.389> to<00:05:27.419> sign<00:05:27.659> a<00:05:27.690> bit<00:05:27.900> like<00:05:28.020> dive<00:05:28.229> I

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:28.470 
also have to sign a bit like dive I

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:29.450 
also have to sign a bit like dive I
don't<00:05:28.620> think<00:05:28.650> there<00:05:28.830> will<00:05:28.889> be<00:05:28.949> any<00:05:29.159> dives

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:29.460 
don't think there will be any dives

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:33.770 
don't think there will be any dives
since<00:05:30.060> the<00:05:30.240> factors<00:05:30.750> are<00:05:31.159> currently<00:05:32.159> no<00:05:33.150> it's

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:33.780 
since the factors are currently no it's

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:35.629 
since the factors are currently no it's
a<00:05:33.840> big<00:05:33.960> wasteland<00:05:34.409> there's<00:05:34.560> no<00:05:34.680> flowers<00:05:35.460> get

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:35.639 
a big wasteland there's no flowers get

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:39.020 
a big wasteland there's no flowers get
back<00:05:35.819> so<00:05:36.389> I'll<00:05:37.080> do<00:05:37.199> that<00:05:37.729> so<00:05:38.729> I<00:05:38.759> hope<00:05:38.849> you<00:05:38.970> guys

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:39.030

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:43.680 
in quite a while I think it will be a

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.760 
in quite a while I think it will be a
good<00:05:44.099> idea<00:05:44.220> i'll<00:05:45.150> put<00:05:45.360> up<00:05:45.449> a<00:05:45.690> it<00:05:46.229> is<00:05:46.409> currently

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:46.770 
good idea i'll put up a it is currently

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:48.290 
good idea i'll put up a it is currently
a<00:05:46.830> little<00:05:47.130> hamachi<00:05:47.370> survive<00:05:47.819> right<00:05:47.970> was<00:05:48.030> like

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:48.300 
a little hamachi survive right was like

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:50.689 
a little hamachi survive right was like
a<00:05:48.330> couple<00:05:48.659> slots<00:05:48.870> and<00:05:49.020> whatnot<00:05:49.289> but<00:05:49.979> if<00:05:50.250> you

00:05:50.689 --> 00:05:50.699 
a couple slots and whatnot but if you

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:52.129 
a couple slots and whatnot but if you
want<00:05:50.880> to<00:05:50.940> help<00:05:51.030> support<00:05:51.240> this<00:05:51.569> project<00:05:51.810> and

whatnot<00:05:52.530> it's<00:05:52.740> only<00:05:53.159> being<00:05:53.280> developed<00:05:53.490> by<00:05:53.669> me

00:05:53.809 --> 00:05:53.819 
whatnot it's only being developed by me

00:05:53.819 --> 00:05:54.860 
whatnot it's only being developed by me
but<00:05:53.970> I<00:05:54.030> could<00:05:54.120> probably<00:05:54.150> a<00:05:54.449> couple<00:05:54.569> friends

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:54.870
