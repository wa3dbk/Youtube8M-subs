of the bag with my hint that the speaker

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.280 
of the bag with my hint that the speaker
on<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:43.890> right<00:01:44.130> would<00:01:44.310> be<00:01:44.430> my<00:01:44.579> choice<00:01:44.820> okay<00:01:45.290> how

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
on the right would be my choice okay how

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.889 
on the right would be my choice okay how
is<00:01:46.350> it<00:01:46.560> doing<00:01:46.680> so<00:01:46.920> far<00:01:47.070> in<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.250> polling<00:01:47.610> I

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:47.899 
is it doing so far in the polling I

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:51.649 
is it doing so far in the polling I
haven't<00:01:48.899> counted<00:01:49.079> it<00:01:49.759> the<00:01:50.759> one<00:01:50.970> thing<00:01:51.210> is<00:01:51.420> that

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
haven't counted it the one thing is that

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.460 
haven't counted it the one thing is that
a<00:01:51.810> lot<00:01:52.049> of<00:01:52.079> the<00:01:52.590> attendees<00:01:53.250> are<00:01:53.579> not<00:01:53.759> into

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
a lot of the attendees are not into

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.770 
a lot of the attendees are not into
modern<00:01:55.470> decor<00:01:55.619> so<00:01:56.280> that<00:01:57.000> will<00:01:57.180> probably<00:01:57.329> weigh

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
modern decor so that will probably weigh

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.530 
modern decor so that will probably weigh
on<00:01:58.049> our<00:01:58.759> judgement<00:01:59.759> of<00:01:59.820> which<00:01:59.969> way<00:02:00.180> we<00:02:00.329> want<00:02:00.509> to

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.509 
that's Korea yeah mmm no so this is the
standoff<00:02:16.480> this<00:02:17.140> yes<00:02:17.409> standoff<00:02:17.980> version<00:02:18.430> on

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:18.519 
standoff this yes standoff version on

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:20.520 
standoff this yes standoff version on
the<00:02:18.640> right<00:02:18.670> yes<00:02:19.269> and<00:02:19.540> the<00:02:19.780> sculpted<00:02:20.290> based

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
the right yes and the sculpted based

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.420 
the right yes and the sculpted based
version<00:02:21.129> on<00:02:21.519> the<00:02:21.609> left<00:02:22.409> so<00:02:23.409> the<00:02:23.500> technology<00:02:24.159> is

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
version on the left so the technology is

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.849 
version on the left so the technology is
very<00:02:24.670> similar<00:02:25.150> to<00:02:25.389> the<00:02:25.510> preceding<00:02:26.349> speaker<00:02:26.709> oh

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:26.859 
very similar to the preceding speaker oh

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:29.039 
very similar to the preceding speaker oh
it<00:02:27.189> think<00:02:27.489> of<00:02:27.609> it<00:02:27.730> more<00:02:27.939> as<00:02:28.000> a<00:02:28.239> little<00:02:28.780> brother

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:29.049 
it think of it more as a little brother

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:32.099 
it think of it more as a little brother
to<00:02:29.230> the<00:02:29.590> 1.7<00:02:30.280> it's<00:02:30.639> all<00:02:30.790> closet<00:02:31.389> ribbon<00:02:31.750> design

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:32.109 
to the 1.7 it's all closet ribbon design

00:02:32.109 --> 00:02:35.610 
to the 1.7 it's all closet ribbon design
and<00:02:32.829> the<00:02:33.159> similar<00:02:33.670> design<00:02:34.599> philosophy<00:02:35.379> that

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
and the similar design philosophy that

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.729 
and the similar design philosophy that
we<00:02:35.799> used<00:02:36.040> in<00:02:36.629> 1.7<00:02:37.629> mm-hmm<00:02:38.109> but<00:02:38.469> it<00:02:38.620> obviously

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739 
we used in 1.7 mm-hmm but it obviously

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:42.500 
we used in 1.7 mm-hmm but it obviously
has<00:02:39.159> appeal<00:02:39.670> for<00:02:40.680> people<00:02:41.680> with<00:02:41.769> smaller<00:02:42.040> rooms

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
has appeal for people with smaller rooms

00:02:42.510 --> 00:03:59.230 
has appeal for people with smaller rooms
where<00:02:43.510> the<00:02:43.659> 1.7<00:02:44.349> might<00:02:44.530> be<00:02:44.680> too<00:02:44.859> large

00:03:59.230 --> 00:03:59.240 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:24.430 

Oh

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.270 

so<00:04:25.440> be<00:04:25.620> what<00:04:25.830> do<00:04:25.890> you<00:04:25.950> think

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
so be what do you think

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.510 
so be what do you think
I<00:04:26.400> think<00:04:26.940> they<00:04:27.030> sound<00:04:27.270> like<00:04:28.130> the<00:04:29.130> larger

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
I think they sound like the larger

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.150 
I think they sound like the larger
Maggie's<00:04:29.910> but<00:04:30.090> in<00:04:30.180> a<00:04:30.210> smaller<00:04:30.420> package<00:04:30.630> I

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:31.160 
Maggie's but in a smaller package I

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:32.480 
Maggie's but in a smaller package I
really<00:04:32.160> do

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
really do

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:34.250 
really do
they<00:04:32.700> have<00:04:32.910> that<00:04:33.030> we<00:04:33.240> could<00:04:33.390> call<00:04:33.630> it<00:04:33.780> made<00:04:34.080> in

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:34.260 
they have that we could call it made in

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.650 
they have that we could call it made in
America<00:04:34.860> sold<00:04:35.280> in<00:04:35.490> China<00:04:35.820> for<00:04:36.210> middle-income
