00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
test the game gives you a Madden IQ and

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.420 
test the game gives you a Madden IQ and
adjust<00:01:36.990> its<00:01:37.170> difficulty<00:01:37.710> of<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:37.979> game<00:01:38.009> based

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
adjust its difficulty of the game based

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.640 
adjust its difficulty of the game based
on<00:01:38.579> how<00:01:38.729> you<00:01:38.790> did<00:01:39.030> on<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.270> four<00:01:39.450> tests<00:01:39.900> the

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
on how you did on the four tests the

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.679 
on how you did on the four tests the
first<00:01:40.890> time<00:01:41.100> I<00:01:41.130> took<00:01:41.310> this<00:01:41.670> test<00:01:41.970> I<00:01:42.240> felt<00:01:42.540> that

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
first time I took this test I felt that

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.120 
first time I took this test I felt that
the<00:01:42.869> offensive<00:01:43.259> drills<00:01:43.439> are<00:01:43.590> much<00:01:43.740> easier

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
the offensive drills are much easier

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.429 
the offensive drills are much easier
than<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.460> defense<00:01:44.899> never<00:01:45.899> played<00:01:46.110> Madden<00:01:46.409> on

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
than the defense never played Madden on

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.380 
than the defense never played Madden on
the<00:01:46.560> ps3<00:01:46.829> prior<00:01:47.280> to<00:01:47.430> this<00:01:47.549> and<00:01:47.850> I<00:01:47.970> did<00:01:48.180> fairly

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
the ps3 prior to this and I did fairly

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.819 
the ps3 prior to this and I did fairly
well<00:01:48.540> on<00:01:48.689> both<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.079> running<00:01:49.350> and<00:01:49.470> passing

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
well on both the running and passing

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.859 
well on both the running and passing
drills<00:01:50.040> on<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.790> other<00:01:50.909> hand<00:01:51.149> stopping<00:01:51.659> the

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
drills on the other hand stopping the

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.510 
drills on the other hand stopping the
computer<00:01:52.200> from<00:01:52.380> making<00:01:52.619> passes<00:01:53.070> and<00:01:53.250> running

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
computer from making passes and running

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.560 
computer from making passes and running
into<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.759> end<00:01:53.880> zone<00:01:53.970> is<00:01:54.180> a<00:01:54.210> much<00:01:54.390> more

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
into the end zone is a much more

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.810 
into the end zone is a much more
difficult<00:01:54.780> test<00:01:55.229> thus<00:01:56.130> I<00:01:56.340> had<00:01:56.520> a<00:01:56.549> pretty

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
difficult test thus I had a pretty

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.359 
difficult test thus I had a pretty
lopsided<00:01:57.110> Madden<00:01:58.110> IQ<00:01:58.469> in<00:01:58.560> my<00:01:58.680> offense<00:01:59.130> being

now<00:04:27.740> what<00:04:27.889> I<00:04:27.920> mean<00:04:28.130> here<00:04:28.400> is<00:04:28.610> that<00:04:29.030> you<00:04:29.389> can

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510 
now what I mean here is that you can

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:31.090 
now what I mean here is that you can
pretty<00:04:29.600> much<00:04:29.720> cancel<00:04:30.139> move<00:04:30.530> so<00:04:30.770> just<00:04:30.800> halfway

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:31.100 
pretty much cancel move so just halfway

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.960 
pretty much cancel move so just halfway
through<00:04:31.430> a<00:04:31.490> spin

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:31.970 
through a spin

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:33.370 
through a spin
you<00:04:32.060> can<00:04:32.270> Juke<00:04:32.510> because<00:04:32.840> although<00:04:33.200> the

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:33.380 
you can Juke because although the

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.440 
you can Juke because although the
animation<00:04:33.889> might<00:04:34.070> not<00:04:34.250> be<00:04:34.400> done<00:04:34.669> it<00:04:35.180> doesn't

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:35.450 
animation might not be done it doesn't

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:36.700 
animation might not be done it doesn't
really<00:04:35.570> matter<00:04:35.780> because<00:04:35.960> the<00:04:36.200> controls<00:04:36.590> are

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710 
really matter because the controls are

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.050 
really matter because the controls are
pretty<00:04:36.740> much<00:04:36.980> unlocked<00:04:37.430> again<00:04:37.700> just<00:04:37.970> like

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.060 
pretty much unlocked again just like

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:41.140 
pretty much unlocked again just like
they<00:04:38.210> would<00:04:38.330> be<00:04:38.450> in<00:04:38.540> a<00:04:38.630> fighting<00:04:38.960> game<00:04:40.150> this

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150 
they would be in a fighting game this

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.000
