00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:03.510 
got rid of most of it and I think about

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:05.840 
got rid of most of it and I think about
the<00:05:03.660> Grecian<00:05:03.960> engines<00:05:04.320> is<00:05:04.560> that<00:05:05.490> you<00:05:05.610> see

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:05.850 
the Grecian engines is that you see

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:07.400 
the Grecian engines is that you see
where<00:05:06.030> any<00:05:06.300> leaks<00:05:06.540> or<00:05:06.810> when<00:05:07.080> it<00:05:07.169> leaves<00:05:07.290> from

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:07.410 
where any leaks or when it leaves from

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:10.370 
where any leaks or when it leaves from
from<00:05:08.000> well<00:05:09.000> it<00:05:09.389> seems<00:05:09.630> as<00:05:09.720> though<00:05:09.780> that<00:05:10.110> I<00:05:10.169> need

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:10.380 
from well it seems as though that I need

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:25.439 
from well it seems as though that I need
a<00:05:10.410> new<00:05:10.620> valve<00:05:11.250> gasket

00:05:25.439 --> 00:05:25.449

you can see all this is wet that's a oil

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:34.619 
you can see all this is wet that's a oil

00:05:36.689 --> 00:05:36.699 
thing of cleaning engines you get to see

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:39.719 
thing of cleaning engines you get to see
what<00:05:36.819> the<00:05:36.879> leads<00:05:37.059> are<00:05:37.150> coming<00:05:37.210> from<00:05:37.539> you<00:05:38.729> get
