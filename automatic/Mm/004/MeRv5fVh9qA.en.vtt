 The name of the baby 6000 was formed 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:19.270
 with a trip that is we felt like 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.610
 this feelings at every step we take 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:23.140
 the next the music in life in 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:25.710
 everything then do so from 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:28.650
 seeds 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.449
 and the genre that we play we play 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.800
 because we want to reach people like 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:36.520
 us of the age 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:38.260
 with the same tastes and purposes of the 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:42.280
 band itself was born more or less out there 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:43.540
 of 2010 we started david and me and little 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.670
 a little bit was integrating member 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:48.350
 first it was this forest 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.500
 and the last one to enter the band to play 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:54.199
 and the good for that there was a chemistry 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.090
 pretty father and they started dating 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:59.480
 songs 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:01.850
 then we focused on what we felt 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:04.309
 what we wanted to say to the people and what 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:07.010
 we captured in a song that was not for 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:09.680
 that the desire to continue playing and follow 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.270
 writing things good the wave 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.550
 that we bring in music is a 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.470
 cool wave with good vibes and then 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:17.660
 we always try to capture what we are going 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.660
 living day by day we try to make this 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:23.250
 be an original project and then 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:26.460
 soon we will be pulling out 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:29.490
