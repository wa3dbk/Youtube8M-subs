chickens running around and took a

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.600 
chickens running around and took a
little<00:01:40.900> research<00:01:41.590> to<00:01:41.650> find<00:01:42.070> out<00:01:42.190> it<00:01:42.340> didn't

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
little research to find out it didn't

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.730 
little research to find out it didn't
mean<00:01:42.730> much<00:01:42.810> actually<00:01:43.810> the<00:01:44.230> chickens<00:01:44.620> were

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
mean much actually the chickens were

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.340 
mean much actually the chickens were
still<00:01:45.010> in<00:01:45.220> big<00:01:45.400> huge<00:01:45.640> houses<00:01:45.970> and<00:01:46.630> industrial

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
factory farms so I didn't think it was

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.000 
factory farms so I didn't think it was
anything<00:01:51.550> more<00:01:51.820> than<00:01:51.880> just<00:01:52.030> good<00:01:52.360> marketing

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.620 
finally I realized that that one had
already<00:02:38.200> been<00:02:38.680> hijacked<00:02:39.250> as<00:02:39.459> well<00:02:39.760> the

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
already been hijacked as well the

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:43.140 
already been hijacked as well the
problem<00:02:41.170> with<00:02:41.320> the<00:02:41.440> term<00:02:41.620> free-range<00:02:42.190> is<00:02:42.730> that

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
problem with the term free-range is that

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.020 
problem with the term free-range is that
in<00:02:43.420> one's<00:02:44.290> mind<00:02:44.650> making<00:02:45.370> sense<00:02:45.640> of<00:02:45.790> it<00:02:45.910> it's

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
in one's mind making sense of it it's

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:47.490 
in one's mind making sense of it it's
you<00:02:46.120> know<00:02:46.239> freedom<00:02:46.570> this<00:02:46.900> is<00:02:47.019> a<00:02:47.050> very<00:02:47.290> American

you know freedom this is a very American

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.740 
you know freedom this is a very American
ideal<00:02:48.100> so<00:02:48.730> we<00:02:48.880> apply<00:02:49.120> that<00:02:49.150> to<00:02:49.330> a<00:02:49.420> chicken

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
ideal so we apply that to a chicken

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.600 
ideal so we apply that to a chicken
we're<00:02:49.959> like<00:02:50.080> wow<00:02:50.260> this<00:02:50.530> chicken<00:02:50.890> is<00:02:51.010> free<00:02:51.370> to

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
range well it's free to range within a

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.590 
range well it's free to range within a

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:53.520 
in this country so you can have

and<00:04:03.540> I<00:04:03.690> think<00:04:03.930> that<00:04:04.080> that's<00:04:04.230> where<00:04:04.470> pastured

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.070 
and I think that that's where pastured

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:07.870 
and I think that that's where pastured
poultry<00:04:05.310> now<00:04:05.760> is<00:04:06.270> becoming<00:04:07.140> something

distinctive and recognized

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:12.509 
distinctive and recognized
I<00:04:10.379> love<00:04:11.379> that<00:04:11.590> term<00:04:11.860> because<00:04:12.099> they<00:04:12.190> think<00:04:12.340> it

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:12.519 
I love that term because they think it

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:14.250 
I love that term because they think it
really<00:04:12.940> when<00:04:13.209> you<00:04:13.300> sink<00:04:13.629> pastured<00:04:14.140> you

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
really when you sink pastured you

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.050 
really when you sink pastured you
immediately<00:04:14.739> think<00:04:14.980> of<00:04:15.160> it<00:04:15.280> feel<00:04:15.519> so<00:04:15.910> it

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
immediately think of it feel so it

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.469 
immediately think of it feel so it
really<00:04:16.680> explains<00:04:17.680> very<00:04:18.190> clearly<00:04:18.310> in<00:04:18.970> one<00:04:19.180> word

00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:19.479 
really explains very clearly in one word

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:21.870 
really explains very clearly in one word
that<00:04:19.810> the<00:04:20.049> animals<00:04:20.530> are<00:04:20.739> outside<00:04:21.220> running

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880 
that the animals are outside running

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.140 
that the animals are outside running
around<00:04:22.030> and<00:04:23.010> pasture<00:04:24.010> meaning<00:04:24.310> grass<00:04:24.580> meaning

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 
around and pasture meaning grass meaning

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.230 
around and pasture meaning grass meaning
bugs<00:04:25.360> meaning<00:04:25.870> sunshine<00:04:26.590> so<00:04:27.040> I<00:04:27.370> think<00:04:27.850> it's<00:04:28.150> a

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:28.240 
bugs meaning sunshine so I think it's a

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.659 
bugs meaning sunshine so I think it's a
really<00:04:28.540> good<00:04:28.720> defined<00:04:29.169> term<00:04:29.740> for<00:04:30.250> what<00:04:30.460> small

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:30.669 
really good defined term for what small

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:32.969 
really good defined term for what small
farmers<00:04:31.060> are<00:04:31.210> doing<00:04:31.240> so<00:04:31.900> we<00:04:31.990> go<00:04:32.110> cage-free<00:04:32.440> we

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:32.979 
farmers are doing so we go cage-free we

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:35.310 
farmers are doing so we go cage-free we
go<00:04:33.130> free-range<00:04:33.760> now<00:04:34.330> we're<00:04:34.510> going<00:04:34.630> to<00:04:34.720> pasture

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 
go free-range now we're going to pasture

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:38.189 
go free-range now we're going to pasture
raised<00:04:35.620> and<00:04:36.090> soon<00:04:37.090> we<00:04:37.300> will<00:04:37.419> go<00:04:37.600> beyond<00:04:37.960> that

00:04:38.189 --> 00:04:38.199 
raised and soon we will go beyond that

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:41.240 
raised and soon we will go beyond that
to<00:04:38.440> keep<00:04:38.860> trying<00:04:39.100> to<00:04:39.220> define<00:04:39.580> these<00:04:39.820> terms<00:04:40.180> for

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
to keep trying to define these terms for

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.590 
to keep trying to define these terms for
understanding<00:04:42.250> and<00:04:42.370> transparency<00:04:43.030> so<00:04:43.389> that

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:43.600 
understanding and transparency so that

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.920 
understanding and transparency so that
customers<00:04:44.169> can<00:04:44.940> better<00:04:45.940> support<00:04:46.210> the<00:04:46.540> type<00:04:46.720> of

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:46.930 
customers can better support the type of

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:48.810 
customers can better support the type of
food<00:04:47.110> production<00:04:47.410> models<00:04:47.950> that<00:04:48.160> they<00:04:48.310> they

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:48.820 
food production models that they they

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:50.190
