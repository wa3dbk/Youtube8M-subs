00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.040
 another video 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.230
 today it's about the rio in ear 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.510
 headphones from the brand now day 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.280
 thank you first of all a pop star 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.990
 point this test report here 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.500
 have enabled and then we catch 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.500
 directly to 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.840
 in scope of delivery is only once 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.670
 a hard shell case in which also the 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.230
 headphones are in it is that ever 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.460
 nicely done here with the new tech 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.900
 lettering and here on the 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.300
 zipper also with the now 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.989
 tech logo and we just look there 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:39.719
 purely as we have here now first 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.000
 the rio headphones here in the color white 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.350
 However, there are also in black and 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.360
 in red here you see for example the 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.340
 red variant and what I'm very cool 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.379
 find in the respective colors are then 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.390
 stop the cables too, then we have them here 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.820
 above still a small clip to 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.070
 attach the cable to the clothing 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.340
 and we have a few more here 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.230
 attachments in a very small size 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.809
 then we have more 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.280
 essays in packaging that is 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.650
 two more in each other 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.490
 sizes so there should be something for everyone 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.110
 to be there 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.390
 and last but not least we have here 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.240
 a short user guide in 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.710
 several languages from the design ago 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.780
 I like the headphones before 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.000
 really good they look very high quality 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.770
 and elegant though the black one 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.110
 or the red version yet 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.790
 something appealing by the fact that 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.979
 the colors are a bit stronger 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.869
 everything here in the area of ​​the cable that is 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.400
 but a matter of taste overall, I think 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.350
 the design is good in any case 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.930
 the materials used are 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.759
 aluminum and plastic the whole is 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.229
 very well made and feels too 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.820
 there high quality 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.140
 here forward, we have again the now 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.509
 techno on such a small one 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.640
 metal tiles and here have one 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.530
 red accent ran everything looks very 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.570
 We can get out of here right now 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.880
 just replace the silicone pillow 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.670
 for our size then just a fitting 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.140
 so that the whole thing sits well and 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.149
 here on the cable we have again 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.310
 a small metal emblem with the rio 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.409
 lettering the cable is a 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.299
 Ribbon cable that has the advantage that 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.469
 it is not so easily dunked so 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.030
 even if you just like that in the 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.679
 bag has it 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.510
 it's not a great deal to be in debt 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.370
 it always gets apart very easily 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.410
 the only thing that happens or often 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.600
 it happens that it just happens 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.800
 bit twisted here that annoys though 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.120
 a bit is still 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.160
 much better than the one 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.080
 headphones before using every time 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.330
 then we have to be able to disassociate 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.100
 here is a remote control with only 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.500
 a single button probably has 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.680
 the background that the whole ios and 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.450
 android or blackberry etc 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.340
 to be compatible with that is otherwise 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.440
 usually not with the three keys 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.600
 completely the case therefore just one 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.230
 So music play break and calls 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.730
 accept 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.160
 on the back we still have here 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.630
 a small microphone and that sounds 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.070
 really decent so you can stay here 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.820
 In any case, really good with 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.010
 to phone 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:55.680
 The cable has a length of 1 meter 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.760
 Thirty is definitely enough and 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.160
 here we have one now 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.569
 golden plug for better 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.100
 should ensure transmission 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:03.660
 of course, the most important is still the 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.340
 sounded and that is really good 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.080
 many compare that he always likes 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.970
 with standard headphones like for example 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.160
 the apple io ports and there i can 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.239
 really just say the knowtech rio are 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.040
 better by a long way 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:15.750
 they just sound very good 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.420
 good on the water too , that's real 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.519
 decent and for a price of 54 99 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.140
 Can not really complain about that 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:24.840
 is just great what you get here 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.640
 good quality sound good 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.739
 quality from the processing ago 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.660
 chic design and the overall package 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:32.340
 just right because I can here so 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.410
 A recommendation to pronounce the nuthe 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.420
 creo are really beautiful in ear 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:38.160
 headphones and my meantime too 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.079
 Favorite headphones on the go then 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.760
