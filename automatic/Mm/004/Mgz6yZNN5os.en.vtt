00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
care products now here's a little quirk

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.620 
care products now here's a little quirk
with<00:01:22.380> that<00:01:22.590> you're<00:01:23.430> going<00:01:23.549> to<00:01:23.610> load<00:01:23.820> your<00:01:24.030> 34

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
with that you're going to load your 34

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.190 
with that you're going to load your 34
Toro<00:01:24.869> QRS<00:01:25.799> but<00:01:26.400> you<00:01:26.549> have<00:01:26.790> to<00:01:27.030> buy<00:01:27.689> three

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
Toro QRS but you have to buy three

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.289 
Toro QRS but you have to buy three
products<00:01:28.770> because<00:01:29.100> that<00:01:29.310> QR<00:01:29.610> works<00:01:30.030> with<00:01:30.270> a

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
products because that QR works with a

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.390 
products because that QR works with a
one<00:01:30.570> on<00:01:30.689> one<00:01:30.720> ratio<00:01:31.110> so<00:01:31.920> you<00:01:31.979> have<00:01:32.189> to<00:01:32.280> buy

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
one on one ratio so you have to buy

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.649 
one on one ratio so you have to buy
three<00:01:32.960> products<00:01:34.310> to<00:01:35.310> go<00:01:35.430> with<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.640> three<00:01:35.850> QRS

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
three products to go with the three QRS

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.350 
three products to go with the three QRS
and<00:01:36.810> your<00:01:37.560> products<00:01:38.009> after<00:01:38.189> your<00:01:38.700> discounts

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
and your products after your discounts

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.440 
and your products after your discounts
have<00:01:40.229> to<00:01:40.439> total<00:01:40.829> at<00:01:40.979> least<00:01:41.310> fifteen<00:01:42.000> dollars

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
have to total at least fifteen dollars

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.080 
have to total at least fifteen dollars
the<00:01:42.689> amount<00:01:42.930> of<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.350> three<00:01:43.740> QRS<00:01:44.430> so<00:01:44.909> that's

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
the amount of the three QRS so that's

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.550 
the amount of the three QRS so that's
one<00:01:45.270> of<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.450> little<00:01:45.540> quirks<00:01:45.930> with<00:01:46.140> this<00:01:46.350> one

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
one of the little quirks with this one
