00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
going to do neither but it's an

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.500 
going to do neither but it's an
interesting<00:00:28.199> question<00:00:28.529> because<00:00:29.000> most<00:00:30.000> people

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
interesting question because most people

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.889

would say oh dairy of course because the

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.500 
would say oh dairy of course because the

know what's gonna happen to them that's

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.539 
know what's gonna happen to them that's
just<00:01:41.950> the<00:01:42.950> worst<00:01:43.280> so<00:01:44.000> if<00:01:44.390> I<00:01:44.509> had<00:01:44.869> to<00:01:45.140> choose

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:45.549 
just the worst so if I had to choose

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:48.460 
just the worst so if I had to choose
which<00:01:46.549> is<00:01:46.700> kind<00:01:47.509> of<00:01:47.539> a<00:01:47.659> silly<00:01:47.869> game<00:01:48.110> because

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
which is kind of a silly game because

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.320 
which is kind of a silly game because
these<00:01:48.590> are<00:01:48.710> hypothetical<00:01:49.000> questions<00:01:50.000> which

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.330 
these are hypothetical questions which

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:55.260 
these are hypothetical questions which
we're<00:01:51.110> never<00:01:51.259> going<00:01:51.440> to<00:01:51.500> be<00:01:51.619> faced<00:01:51.890> with

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.370 

someone<00:01:56.270> asked<00:01:56.450> so<00:01:56.750> I<00:01:56.780> thought<00:01:57.020> it<00:01:57.140> was<00:01:57.229> an

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
someone asked so I thought it was an

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.529 
someone asked so I thought it was an
interesting<00:01:57.619> topic<00:01:58.039> of<00:01:58.399> conversation<00:01:59.240> but

00:01:59.529 --> 00:01:59.539 
interesting topic of conversation but

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:05.380 
interesting topic of conversation but
every<00:01:59.869> single<00:02:00.050> time<00:02:00.200> I<00:02:00.619> would<00:02:00.679> choose<00:02:02.950> Terry

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
every single time I would choose Terry

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.100 
every single time I would choose Terry
it's<00:02:05.810> a<00:02:06.020> hypothetical<00:02:06.590> question<00:02:07.220> but<00:02:08.110> there's

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
it's a hypothetical question but there's

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:10.389 
it's a hypothetical question but there's
probably<00:02:09.259> people<00:02:09.560> watching<00:02:10.100> this<00:02:10.220> or

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
probably people watching this or

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:13.090 
probably people watching this or
