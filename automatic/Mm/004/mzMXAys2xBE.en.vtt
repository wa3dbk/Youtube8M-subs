been times where it's like awkward on

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:31.930

how<00:03:29.389> I<00:03:29.419> explain<00:03:29.870> like<00:03:30.319> what<00:03:30.620> YouTube<00:03:31.069> is<00:03:31.310> if

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
how I explain like what YouTube is if

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:33.789

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:33.799 
that makes sense but I feel like the

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:36.159 
that makes sense but I feel like the
older<00:03:34.069> generation<00:03:34.819> just<00:03:35.000> in<00:03:35.180> general<00:03:35.419> doesn't

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:36.169 
older generation just in general doesn't

00:03:36.169 --> 00:03:39.550 
older generation just in general doesn't
really<00:03:36.730> understand<00:03:37.730> how<00:03:38.030> it<00:03:38.209> works<00:03:38.260> like<00:03:39.260> they

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
really understand how it works like they

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060 
and it's it's kind of makes it it makes

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.390 
and it's it's kind of makes it it makes
it<00:05:03.240> situation<00:05:03.660> a<00:05:03.810> little<00:05:03.900> bit<00:05:04.080> more<00:05:04.260> weird<00:05:05.220> or

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400
