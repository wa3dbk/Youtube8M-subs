main<00:02:56.209> deck<00:02:56.480> I<00:02:56.630> don't<00:02:56.780> have<00:02:56.900> any<00:02:57.080> much<00:02:57.290> like

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
main deck I don't have any much like

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.130 
main deck I don't have any much like
decent<00:02:58.310> cells<00:02:58.700> and<00:02:58.849> traps<00:02:59.030> and<00:02:59.239> yet<00:02:59.780> just

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
decent cells and traps and yet just

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:01.240 
decent cells and traps and yet just
because<00:03:00.260> it's<00:03:00.620> not<00:03:00.769> even<00:03:00.980> close<00:03:01.069> to<00:03:01.130> being

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
because it's not even close to being

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.809 
because it's not even close to being
