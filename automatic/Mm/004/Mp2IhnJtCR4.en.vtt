00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:06.629
 ambon 46 gives some news without reading some 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:10.069
 thing to look at you then me 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.069
 I'll say what I think beauty 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.370
 it was not 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:31.160
 if you are the type of player who always 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.029
 wanted a new open for business on the 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.860
 sims 3 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:36.260
 but unfortunately I never wish 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.960
 realized maybe things might be a 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.280
 little different on the sims 4 yet 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.010
 does not necessarily mean that 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.970
 we will have an expansion of the type on the fourth 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.980
 generation 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:49.040
 a scene asked via twitter to 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:51.379
 producer nardoni grass about ideas for 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.370
 an expansion like the sims 2 open for 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:54.860
 Business 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.050
 in response he said this is a theme that 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.970
 I would be excited to work all 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:02.030
 aspects of it that we do not add 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:03.559
 3g models in your grain microblogging 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.080
 nardoni also talked a little about 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:08.810
 these 4 which is in a period of 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.150
 review of changes where it is decided that 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:14.030
 still be added and improved on 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.830
 remaining development time 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.570
 I'm a producer so I make a 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.550
 bit of everything at the moment I'm 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.920
 mainly involved in the management of a 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.810
 process called change review where 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.700
 we evaluate how to use our time 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.920
 remaining development between 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.560
 to finish what we need to find 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.210
 adjust to polish for there the content 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.080
 it is an experience we want for the 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.080
 release date of 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:41.480
 good people but then this is news 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.310
 Very fast, they sent me this here. 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:45.230
 via twitter it was Natalia 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.510
 Thank you Natalia for sending me this 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:52.370

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:54.440
 to organize I to make sculptured as 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:56.720
 My friend says, I did not 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:59.090
 sculptures about these things nor about 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:02.210
 news have not sought much but she 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:04.370
 saw it sent and I thought it was cool 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.680
 that I'm bringing the second video 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:10.970
 Today I think it's cool of you to know. 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:13.760
 maybe we'll be on the 1st of this month 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:20.780
 four open for business 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:23.900
 This is going to be so good, I do not know. 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:26.319
 but my cousin, I do not like it very much 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:30.050
 open for business 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:32.840
 It's not like you have your own loje. 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:35.130

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:38.430

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:42.030

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.600
 Nice I think it's one of the four 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.700
 open for business I think it was the 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.460
 extreme stupidity they have not done 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.980
 so it made me just think but it's a matter of 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:13.260
 opinion that your vision but I will stay 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:18.000

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:25.470

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:30.840

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:32.880
