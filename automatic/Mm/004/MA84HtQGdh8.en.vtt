00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.440
 hello and welcome to 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.290
 second part of making million coin me 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:10.070
 I'm 96 together and every episode 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.179
 have made really good profit again 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:13.500
 yes of course you have to also point 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.910
 I may not be too in recent times 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.260
 you will still get much more active 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.660
 made like that, we will soon 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.800
 see 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.900
 I promise you in the near future 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.539
 will run the entire structured 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.949
 then the videos are also exciting what 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.090
 we made a good profit today so 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.199
 it is worthwhile in any case anyway 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.679
 stay tuned 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.430
 Here we see a few 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:33.719
 I have always been smaller 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.300
 I sold because this time bender 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:39.200
 bought for 4000 59 sold in the 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.790
 shadow attribute in conc. by immediate purchase 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:44.520
 easily get it for 5000 times 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:48.480
 sold and then still so small 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:52.559
 The gift that we will make from the gift 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:55.350
 yes, we also see a whole here 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.190
 So, gold is not given as a gift 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.260
 but one 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.329
 but children are given once 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.739
 even a whole that would be over yet 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.710
 I'll see the games in the first one 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.500
 400 then adjusted 350 if ina 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.049
 to repel one another 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:15.960
 but you will see that here too 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:18.000
 have come first and yes again and again 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.689
 even bigger day put a thousand times 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.820
 once exactly 1000 times even better 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.790
 but then I will still make sense here 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.040
 once again a gift since gold the 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.670
 best player here the wolfsburger 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:36.780
 shepherd yes i'll hear from others in 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.720
 followed but so did for it 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.060
 we were not enough 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:45.140
 in pack form this gift had 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.369
 but have a comment but 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.899
 i would definitely go 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.700
 friends that would be the case with me 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:54.420
 I do not think so here you see 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.430
 already the munich around 18,000 lies 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.350
 because of me five fighters at 15:11 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.600
 have brought all the cards just because 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.899
 that went down this way 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.890
 funny look yes there just had to 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.960
 flat I think they have the same 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.399
 made mostly I'm still with 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.959
 tried a method and his 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.560
 Prospectus method easy with her two 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:16.380
 times this 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.270
 opened goldbeck and then the whole 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.890
 everything strangers have a lot of players and 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.530
 the whole garbage nobody wants 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.750
 actually offered and some against 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.959
 some things that would not be the same to me 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.970
 still see yes the tactics have been 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:32.730
 yes, really well paid always 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.290
 but we have in the coat of arms that I have 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.930
 itself activates what nikolaus looks 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.890
 but we had time then quite 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.380
 repel a lot 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.810
 but with this tactic a bit 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:46.080
 but I did not do that in the win 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:48.090
 area where it will be worth a lot 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.370
 of course, then from what 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.959
 one withdraws 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.970
 we did not force anything special 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.640
 louder standard kramer old 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:03:01.200
 still a bit profit 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:03.599
 yes still pack as you see there was 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.950
 Of course it is not great though 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:06.599
 of course times such a team finds 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.519
 drinhaus then has the pack of course 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:09.750
 is paid equal to both 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:13.019
 Here, unfortunately, not the case 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:17.190
 yes even more just as I said a little 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:20.450
 profit remains yes if you see you still 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:24.540
 Soon even further everything from park 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:25.620
 you just have to leave residues 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.940
 maybe we can be nice too 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.769
 At the moment we drive anyway 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.519
 Here you see a premium gold worth and 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:35.489
 that as a gift that's crazy 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:37.890
 yes my best right gift so far 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:39.299
 manier his eleven dueling card as well 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:41.760
 as we also have a lot in the club 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:43.319
 and then a guard camps part and 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.590
 you see it then already I have 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:49.079
 everything from the prospectus sells a lot 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:55.380
 and donated that from the other 

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:57.480
 gold yes, too much profit was not 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.799
 from the prospectus already has 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.069
 announced a bit like if there 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:03.630
 still the tak the first time not even 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:06.389
 The market always wants to wait completely 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:08.730
 is crowded with large objects 

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:12.329
 I want to be cool 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:14.160
 but well now the 54,000 that is 

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:15.090
 because we just the whole cellar 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.489
 met some 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:19.859
 the five claimants pulled a user 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:23.909
 have and the 15 16 with the pulled 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:24.620
 11CLM cards and yes I did not because 

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:26.510
 more dangerous 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:29.000
 I bought the 4000 each 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:31.160
 bought unknown civilian for 2200 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.990
 then sell the couple here 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.600
 play and that's us 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:37.790
 again at the end of the episode 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:39.229
 we have around 30,000 in this episode 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:42.040
 made a profit that's one 

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:44.780
 break down so that I have so little 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:46.190
 I've invested this for this time 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:47.270
 in the year 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:48.830
 I'm looking forward to the next time 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:51.080
 then structured a bit 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:55.600
 until then, go clean yours 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:55.600
 with each other 96 and ciao
