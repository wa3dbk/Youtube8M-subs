00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
during a boot up we see that the

dub<00:02:16.160> for<00:02:16.370> that<00:02:16.489> matter<00:02:16.670> this<00:02:17.480> is<00:02:17.630> probably

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
dub for that matter this is probably

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.600 
dub for that matter this is probably
because<00:02:18.319> the<00:02:18.470> iPhone<00:02:18.830> is<00:02:18.950> now<00:02:19.069> loaded<00:02:19.459> with

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
because the iPhone is now loaded with

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.479 
because the iPhone is now loaded with
many<00:02:20.510> applications<00:02:21.349> contacts<00:02:21.920> in<00:02:22.099> music

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
many applications contacts in music

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:24.040 
many applications contacts in music
whereas<00:02:22.819> the<00:02:22.970> BlackBerry<00:02:23.450> is<00:02:23.510> still<00:02:23.840> yet<00:02:24.019> to

whereas the BlackBerry is still yet to

whereas the BlackBerry is still yet to
be<00:02:24.290> loaded<00:02:24.620> with<00:02:24.650> it<00:02:24.920> so<00:02:25.670> there<00:02:25.819> are<00:02:26.000> factors

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569 
be loaded with it so there are factors

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:30.790 
be loaded with it so there are factors
that<00:02:26.720> may<00:02:27.459> change<00:02:28.459> this<00:02:28.730> obviously<00:02:29.599> please<00:02:30.050> be
