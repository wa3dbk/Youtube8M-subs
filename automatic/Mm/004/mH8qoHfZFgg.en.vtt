pretty<00:03:27.340> much<00:03:27.430> I<00:03:27.700> did<00:03:27.850> three<00:03:28.420> sets<00:03:28.570> of<00:03:28.720> eight

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
pretty much I did three sets of eight

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:32.660 
pretty much I did three sets of eight
for<00:03:30.130> pull-ups<00:03:30.520> for<00:03:31.030> a<00:03:31.060> start<00:03:31.330> was<00:03:31.570> 45<00:03:31.989> pounds

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
for pull-ups for a start was 45 pounds

for pull-ups for a start was 45 pounds
and<00:03:33.670> I<00:03:33.760> did<00:03:33.910> that<00:03:34.120> roughly<00:03:35.110> pretty<00:03:35.350> quickly<00:03:35.590> I

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
and I did that roughly pretty quickly I

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.550 
and I did that roughly pretty quickly I
think<00:03:36.370> I<00:03:36.430> did<00:03:36.610> that<00:03:36.760> in<00:03:36.880> like<00:03:36.910> 8<00:03:37.150> minutes<00:03:37.360> for<00:03:37.810> 3

think I did that in like 8 minutes for 3

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.910 
think I did that in like 8 minutes for 3
sets<00:03:38.860> and<00:03:39.190> then<00:03:39.459> I<00:03:39.489> went<00:03:39.790> straight<00:03:39.850> to<00:03:40.120> doing<00:03:40.390> a

where<00:06:05.509> you<00:06:05.569> put<00:06:05.810> your<00:06:06.139> elbow<00:06:06.500> right<00:06:06.860> in<00:06:07.849> your

00:06:07.959 --> 00:06:07.969 
where you put your elbow right in your

00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:13.029 
where you put your elbow right in your

it<00:06:13.159> hits<00:06:13.310> the<00:06:13.460> peak<00:06:13.669> but<00:06:14.000> I<00:06:14.300> think<00:06:14.689> it's<00:06:15.529> all

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:15.680 
it hits the peak but I think it's all

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:17.559 
it hits the peak but I think it's all
genetics<00:06:16.219> just<00:06:16.490> like<00:06:16.639> those<00:06:16.819> calves<00:06:17.149> or

00:06:17.559 --> 00:06:17.569 
genetics just like those calves or

00:06:17.569 --> 00:06:20.260 
genetics just like those calves or
genetics<00:06:18.080> just<00:06:18.979> like<00:06:19.129> the<00:06:19.250> bicep<00:06:19.699> peak<00:06:19.939> in<00:06:20.149> my

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:20.270 
genetics just like the bicep peak in my

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:22.600 
genetics just like the bicep peak in my
opinion<00:06:20.569> is<00:06:20.689> all<00:06:20.810> genetics<00:06:21.259> but<00:06:21.469> I<00:06:21.740> like<00:06:22.430> to<00:06:22.520> do

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:22.610 
opinion is all genetics but I like to do
