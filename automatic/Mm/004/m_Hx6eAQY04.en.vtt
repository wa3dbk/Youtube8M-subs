hey guys mike here and today are going
to<00:00:02.159> see<00:00:02.340> which<00:00:02.550> one<00:00:02.700> of<00:00:02.730> these<00:00:03.000> two<00:00:03.060> tablets

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480 
to see which one of these two tablets

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.869 
to see which one of these two tablets
the<00:00:03.870> apple<00:00:04.230> ipad<00:00:04.410> mini<00:00:04.890> and<00:00:05.100> the<00:00:05.460> google<00:00:05.730> nexus

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
the apple ipad mini and the google nexus

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:08.810 
the apple ipad mini and the google nexus
7<00:00:06.509> is<00:00:06.660> the<00:00:06.960> fastest<00:00:07.470> will<00:00:08.130> find<00:00:08.370> out<00:00:08.519> which<00:00:08.790> one

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
7 is the fastest will find out which one

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.970 
7 is the fastest will find out which one
boots<00:00:09.210> first<00:00:09.480> which<00:00:09.900> one<00:00:10.110> is<00:00:10.260> snappier<00:00:10.710> while

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
boots first which one is snappier while

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.129 
boots first which one is snappier while
dealing<00:00:11.219> with<00:00:11.490> everyday<00:00:11.790> apps<00:00:12.179> and<00:00:12.480> which<00:00:12.929> one

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
dealing with everyday apps and which one

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.140 
dealing with everyday apps and which one
gets<00:00:13.320> higher<00:00:13.590> scores<00:00:13.980> in<00:00:14.160> benchmarks<00:00:14.759> so

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
gets higher scores in benchmarks so

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.359 
gets higher scores in benchmarks so
let's<00:00:15.330> get<00:00:15.450> going<00:00:15.590> we're<00:00:16.590> going<00:00:16.770> to<00:00:16.859> start<00:00:17.160> by

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
let's get going we're going to start by

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:18.920 
let's get going we're going to start by
finding<00:00:17.609> out<00:00:17.910> which<00:00:18.150> one<00:00:18.300> of<00:00:18.330> the<00:00:18.539> two<00:00:18.570> is

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
finding out which one of the two is

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:51.030 
finding out which one of the two is
going<00:00:19.199> to<00:00:19.289> boot<00:00:19.470> up<00:00:19.500> first

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:51.040 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.799 

now<00:00:52.040> we'll<00:00:52.430> have<00:00:52.460> some<00:00:52.820> browser<00:00:53.120> speed<00:00:53.510> test

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:53.809 
now we'll have some browser speed test

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:55.510 
now we'll have some browser speed test
we'll<00:00:54.260> see<00:00:54.410> which<00:00:54.559> one<00:00:54.739> open<00:00:55.100> the<00:00:55.250> site<00:00:55.489> faster

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:55.520 
we'll see which one open the site faster

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.790 
we'll see which one open the site faster
and<00:00:56.180> how<00:00:56.420> easy<00:00:56.629> and<00:00:56.960> smooth<00:00:57.260> it<00:00:57.500> is<00:00:57.650> to

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
and how easy and smooth it is to

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:09.040 
and how easy and smooth it is to
navigate<00:00:57.949> on<00:00:58.460> those<00:00:58.640> websites<00:00:58.850> in<00:00:59.420> both<00:00:59.660> cases

in the next part of this clip we'll see
how<00:01:54.579> long<00:01:54.789> it<00:01:55.000> takes<00:01:55.030> for<00:01:55.359> the<00:01:55.450> two<00:01:55.600> tablets<00:01:55.869> to

00:01:56.279 --> 00:01:56.289 
how long it takes for the two tablets to

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:12.720 
how long it takes for the two tablets to
open<00:01:56.619> the<00:01:56.740> same<00:01:56.950> YouTube<00:01:57.429> video<00:02:11.519> next<00:02:12.519> we'll

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
open the same YouTube video next we'll

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.520 
open the same YouTube video next we'll
launch<00:02:12.910> again<00:02:13.299> in<00:02:13.569> our<00:02:13.750> case<00:02:14.019> Angry<00:02:14.500> Birds

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
launch again in our case Angry Birds

launch again in our case Angry Birds
just<00:02:15.280> to<00:02:15.400> see<00:02:15.610> which<00:02:15.790> one<00:02:15.940> manages<00:02:16.420> to<00:02:16.599> load<00:02:16.780> it

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
just to see which one manages to load it

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:23.400

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
first as we get towards the end we also

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:37.979 
first as we get towards the end we also
have<00:02:23.709> some<00:02:23.950> benchmarks<00:02:24.519> for<00:02:24.549> you<00:02:34.470> and<00:02:36.989> that

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 
have some benchmarks for you and that

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:39.690 
have some benchmarks for you and that
pretty<00:02:38.230> much<00:02:38.379> wraps<00:02:38.709> up<00:02:38.950> this<00:02:39.160> very<00:02:39.430> short

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 
clip I'm going to let you draw the

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:43.710 
clip I'm going to let you draw the
conclusions<00:02:42.400> yourself<00:02:42.879> and<00:02:43.150> I'm<00:02:43.299> just<00:02:43.480> going

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
to be snappier in most scenarios the

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.400 
to be snappier in most scenarios the
iPad<00:02:48.640> Mini<00:02:48.879> is<00:02:48.970> not<00:02:49.269> a<00:02:49.299> lagger<00:02:49.690> either<00:02:50.049> and

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
iPad Mini is not a lagger either and

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.500 
iPad Mini is not a lagger either and
during<00:02:50.739> everyday<00:02:51.040> use<00:02:51.370> you're<00:02:51.910> mostly<00:02:52.239> going

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
during everyday use you're mostly going

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:53.910 
during everyday use you're mostly going
to<00:02:52.630> be<00:02:52.780> satisfied<00:02:53.349> with<00:02:53.530> the<00:02:53.680> overall

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
to be satisfied with the overall

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.000 
to be satisfied with the overall
performances<00:02:54.730> each<00:02:54.910> of<00:02:55.180> them<00:02:55.359> offers<00:02:56.010> alright

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
performances each of them offers alright

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.680 
performances each of them offers alright
and<00:02:57.250> that's<00:02:57.340> about<00:02:57.489> it<00:02:57.639> for<00:02:57.819> now<00:02:58.000> let<00:02:58.420> me<00:02:58.540> know
