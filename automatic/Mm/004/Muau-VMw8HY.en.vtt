00:00:31.477 --> 00:00:33.108
Whoa! Excuse me.

00:00:33.232 --> 00:00:34.626
I don't think that was you.

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:39.858
Oh, my whole family.

00:00:39.894 --> 00:00:41.973
See? He still hugs his parents.

00:00:42.775 --> 00:00:44.170
- Ellie!
- Manny!

00:00:44.311 --> 00:00:45.124
Hold me!

00:00:45.213 --> 00:00:47.091
When the world falls apart...

00:00:47.735 --> 00:00:51.764
No matter how long it takes.
I will find you!

00:00:52.757 --> 00:00:54.481
...history's greatest heroes...

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:55.877
Granny? You're alive!

00:00:55.877 --> 00:00:58.738
Hey, Sid! This is my first bath in decades.

00:00:59.803 --> 00:01:01.374
I don't wanna see that.

00:01:01.514 --> 00:01:03.123
...will keep it together.

00:01:03.184 --> 00:01:06.849
My mother once told me that bad
news was just good news in disguise.

00:01:06.926 --> 00:01:09.397
Was this before he abandon you?
- Yes, it was.

00:01:13.571 --> 00:01:16.781
I'll push him overboard.
You guys say it was an accident.

00:01:16.938 --> 00:01:17.661
I'm in.

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:20.697
This summer...

00:01:20.802 --> 00:01:22.064
Battle stations!

00:01:22.197 --> 00:01:26.230
Surrender your ship or face my fury.

00:01:26.291 --> 00:01:28.313
Two words: anger management.

00:01:28.957 --> 00:01:30.353
...the end of the world...

00:01:30.489 --> 00:01:32.639
We're all gonna survive this.

00:01:33.736 --> 00:01:34.933
Okay, maybe they won't.

00:01:35.064 --> 00:01:37.596
...is just the tip of the iceberg.

00:01:37.596 --> 00:01:41.403
Hey, little fellows.
How about you and us against the pirates?

00:01:42.062 --> 00:01:43.518
You got no idea what I'm saying, do you?

00:01:43.518 --> 00:01:44.432
May I try?

00:01:51.496 --> 00:01:52.469
That they got?

00:01:53.687 --> 00:01:55.753
Everyone, please. Don't panic.

00:01:55.763 --> 00:01:56.459
Fire!

00:01:58.975 --> 00:02:01.083
No one's gonna stop me from
getting back to my family.

00:02:01.083 --> 00:02:03.811
Come on ocean!
Is that the best you can do?

00:02:08.583 --> 00:02:09.940
Holy crab!

00:02:12.171 --> 00:02:13.900
You're pretty soft for a saber.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.377
Excuse me, I happen to be
a remorseless assassin.

00:02:17.919 --> 00:02:19.926
Hey, I made you another coral necklace.

00:02:20.091 --> 00:02:21.498
He keeps losing them.
