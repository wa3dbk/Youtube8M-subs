in<00:03:12.830> things<00:03:13.640> like<00:03:13.730> that<00:03:14.000> found<00:03:14.750> objects<00:03:15.519> you

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:16.519 
in things like that found objects you

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:18.280 
in things like that found objects you
know<00:03:16.640> you<00:03:16.700> could<00:03:17.180> use<00:03:17.420> to<00:03:17.660> kind<00:03:17.900> of<00:03:18.019> give<00:03:18.170> this

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
know you could use to kind of give this

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:23.880 
know you could use to kind of give this
more<00:03:18.620> 3d<00:03:19.239> kind<00:03:20.239> of<00:03:20.329> look<00:03:20.600> maybe<00:03:21.079> bolt<00:03:21.709> it<00:03:21.890> down

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890 
more 3d kind of look maybe bolt it down

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.370 
more 3d kind of look maybe bolt it down
would<00:03:24.890> be<00:03:24.950> cooler<00:03:25.450> didn't<00:03:26.450> do<00:03:26.510> that<00:03:26.660> just<00:03:27.230> got

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
would be cooler didn't do that just got

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.110 
would be cooler didn't do that just got
some<00:03:27.530> circles<00:03:27.920> just<00:03:28.489> like<00:03:28.610> it<00:03:28.820> said<00:03:29.000> in<00:03:29.030> the

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
some circles just like it said in the

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.569 
some circles just like it said in the
paper<00:03:29.180> craft<00:03:29.660> thing<00:03:29.959> this<00:03:30.680> is<00:03:30.860> exactly<00:03:31.040> the

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:31.579 
paper craft thing this is exactly the

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:35.380 
paper craft thing this is exactly the
file<00:03:31.790> that<00:03:32.000> I<00:03:32.030> used<00:03:33.010> on<00:03:34.010> the<00:03:34.790> back<00:03:35.000> for<00:03:35.299> the

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
file that I used on the back for the

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:38.380 
file that I used on the back for the
neck<00:03:35.630> I<00:03:36.049> bolted<00:03:36.920> everything<00:03:37.489> in<00:03:37.730> and<00:03:38.239> then

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
neck I bolted everything in and then

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:40.840 
neck I bolted everything in and then
figured<00:03:38.900> out<00:03:39.049> that<00:03:39.320> the<00:03:39.620> neck<00:03:39.920> hole<00:03:40.130> was<00:03:40.459> too

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
figured out that the neck hole was too

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:44.349 
figured out that the neck hole was too
small<00:03:41.090> for<00:03:41.329> my<00:03:41.450> head<00:03:42.040> so<00:03:43.040> I<00:03:43.370> cut<00:03:43.880> this<00:03:44.090> back

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:44.359 
small for my head so I cut this back

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:48.009 
small for my head so I cut this back
thin<00:03:44.720> off<00:03:44.900> it<00:03:45.200> now<00:03:45.350> flexes<00:03:46.329> I'm<00:03:47.329> going<00:03:47.660> to<00:03:47.720> take

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:48.019 
thin off it now flexes I'm going to take

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:51.509 
thin off it now flexes I'm going to take
some<00:03:48.230> hinges<00:03:49.130> or<00:03:50.120> not<00:03:50.299> hinges<00:03:50.660> but<00:03:50.840> clasps

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:51.519 
some hinges or not hinges but clasps

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:53.979 
some hinges or not hinges but clasps
probably<00:03:52.519> from<00:03:52.609> like<00:03:52.790> a<00:03:52.850> toolbox<00:03:53.390> kind<00:03:53.900> of

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:53.989 
probably from like a toolbox kind of

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:58.330 
probably from like a toolbox kind of
thing<00:03:54.200> a<00:03:54.230> little<00:03:54.709> latch<00:03:55.359> and<00:03:57.130> that<00:03:58.130> will<00:03:58.220> be

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
thing a little latch and that will be

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.660 
thing a little latch and that will be
used<00:03:58.549> to<00:03:58.820> close<00:03:59.209> this<00:03:59.420> off<00:03:59.660> on<00:04:00.410> the<00:04:00.620> inside<00:04:01.130> I

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:01.670 
used to close this off on the inside I

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:03.400 
used to close this off on the inside I
don't<00:04:02.209> know<00:04:02.299> if<00:04:02.390> you<00:04:02.480> can<00:04:02.600> see<00:04:02.840> this<00:04:02.959> probably

don't know if you can see this probably

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:07.569 
don't know if you can see this probably
can't<00:04:03.920> because<00:04:04.280> the<00:04:04.400> lighting<00:04:05.380> there<00:04:06.380> is<00:04:06.769> the

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:07.579 
can't because the lighting there is the

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:11.979 
can't because the lighting there is the
top<00:04:07.790> of<00:04:07.820> a<00:04:08.030> hoodie<00:04:08.709> one<00:04:09.709> of<00:04:09.799> these<00:04:10.660> cut<00:04:11.660> and

glued in just with some spray adhesive

00:04:15.669 --> 00:04:20.050 
glued in just with some spray adhesive
it<00:04:16.669> seems<00:04:17.239> to<00:04:17.299> be<00:04:17.419> holding<00:04:17.570> really<00:04:18.200> well

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.060 
it seems to be holding really well

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.800

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:42.440 
protects from the bolts I cut the ends

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.500 
protects from the bolts I cut the ends
of<00:04:42.530> the<00:04:42.650> bolts<00:04:43.040> off<00:04:43.250> after<00:04:43.820> I<00:04:43.880> put<00:04:44.090> nuts<00:04:44.300> on

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:44.510

them super glued the nut on and then

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:51.090 
them super glued the nut on and then
ground<00:04:49.250> used<00:04:49.550> to<00:04:49.639> dremel<00:04:50.000> would<00:04:50.120> grind<00:04:50.360> down

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:51.100 
ground used to dremel would grind down

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:54.550 
ground used to dremel would grind down
the<00:04:52.120> the<00:04:53.120> rest<00:04:53.330> of<00:04:53.479> the<00:04:53.540> screw<00:04:53.840> so<00:04:54.169> it<00:04:54.229> wasn't

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:54.560 
the the rest of the screw so it wasn't

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.129 
the the rest of the screw so it wasn't
stabbed<00:04:54.889> me<00:04:55.130> in<00:04:55.220> the<00:04:55.250> head<00:04:55.490> but<00:04:56.150> uh<00:04:56.180> as<00:04:56.750> you<00:04:56.960> can

00:04:57.129 --> 00:04:57.139 
stabbed me in the head but uh as you can

00:04:57.139 --> 00:05:00.510 
stabbed me in the head but uh as you can
see<00:04:57.320> it<00:04:57.470> looks<00:04:57.620> a<00:04:57.830> little<00:04:58.810> tricky<00:04:59.810> to<00:04:59.930> get<00:05:00.139> on

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:00.520 
see it looks a little tricky to get on

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.370 
see it looks a little tricky to get on
you<00:05:01.520> going<00:05:01.790> to<00:05:01.850> kind<00:05:02.000> of<00:05:02.229> give<00:05:03.229> it<00:05:03.260> a<00:05:03.350> little

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:03.380 
you going to kind of give it a little

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:08.770 
you going to kind of give it a little
tug<00:05:04.300> but<00:05:05.300> it<00:05:06.020> is<00:05:06.260> completely<00:05:07.190> wearable<00:05:07.520> I<00:05:08.180> can

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:08.780 
tug but it is completely wearable I can

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:16.000 
tug but it is completely wearable I can
