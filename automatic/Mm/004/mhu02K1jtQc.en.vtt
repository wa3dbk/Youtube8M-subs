I'm<00:00:06.779> going<00:00:06.930> to<00:00:06.990> show<00:00:07.170> you<00:00:07.200> a<00:00:07.350> little

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
I'm going to show you a little

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.900 
I'm going to show you a little
demonstration<00:00:07.799> of<00:00:08.670> four<00:00:09.269> card<00:00:09.630> monte<00:00:10.910> it's

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
demonstration of four card monte it's

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.060 
demonstration of four card monte it's
similar<00:00:12.240> to<00:00:12.360> three-card<00:00:12.929> Monte<00:00:13.320> except<00:00:13.920> it

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
similar to three-card Monte except it

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.330 
similar to three-card Monte except it
uses<00:00:14.250> four<00:00:15.179> cards

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
uses four cards

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.660 
uses four cards
the<00:00:17.730> concept<00:00:18.270> is<00:00:18.420> the<00:00:18.570> same<00:00:19.190> that<00:00:20.190> uses

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
the concept is the same that uses

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.429 
the concept is the same that uses
several<00:00:21.300> alike<00:00:22.260> cards<00:00:22.800> in<00:00:23.270> this<00:00:24.270> case<00:00:24.540> the

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
several alike cards in this case the

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.359 
several alike cards in this case the
twos<00:00:25.820> then<00:00:26.820> one<00:00:27.410> indifferent<00:00:28.410> card<00:00:28.650> which<00:00:29.189> is

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
twos then one indifferent card which is

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.510 
twos then one indifferent card which is
the<00:00:29.490> king<00:00:29.869> that's<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:31.140> card<00:00:31.439> you<00:00:32.220> need<00:00:32.430> to

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
the king that's the card you need to

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.780 
the king that's the card you need to
follow<00:00:33.559> I'm<00:00:34.559> going<00:00:34.710> to<00:00:34.770> mix<00:00:34.949> them<00:00:35.100> up<00:00:35.220> just<00:00:35.610> a

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
follow I'm going to mix them up just a

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.180 
follow I'm going to mix them up just a
little<00:00:35.820> bit<00:00:36.090> and<00:00:36.449> do<00:00:36.870> something<00:00:37.290> unusual<00:00:37.530> and

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
little bit and do something unusual and

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.850 
little bit and do something unusual and
show<00:00:38.970> you<00:00:39.030> all<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.750> cards<00:00:40.199> face-up

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
show you all the cards face-up

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.160 
show you all the cards face-up
so<00:00:41.160> you<00:00:41.250> can<00:00:41.460> clearly<00:00:41.790> see<00:00:41.970> where<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:42.900> king<00:00:43.140> is

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
so you can clearly see where the king is

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.790 
so you can clearly see where the king is
and<00:00:43.800> in<00:00:44.400> this<00:00:44.550> case<00:00:44.879> it's<00:00:45.410> second<00:00:46.410> from<00:00:46.769> the

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
and in this case it's second from the

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.350 
and in this case it's second from the
top<00:00:47.660> if<00:00:48.660> I<00:00:48.780> turn<00:00:49.019> the<00:00:49.170> pack<00:00:49.410> over<00:00:49.910> that<00:00:50.910> should

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
top if I turn the pack over that should

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.510 
top if I turn the pack over that should
position<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:52.140> king<00:00:52.440> second<00:00:53.190> from<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.399> bottom

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
position the king second from the bottom

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.160 
position the king second from the bottom
and<00:00:54.149> if<00:00:55.140> I<00:00:55.290> reverse<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:56.040> order<00:00:56.840> that<00:00:57.840> should

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
and if I reverse the order that should

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.979 
and if I reverse the order that should
bring<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.469> king<00:00:58.820> second<00:00:59.820> from<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.059> top<00:01:00.390> here

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
bring the king second from the top here

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.469 
bring the king second from the top here
but<00:01:01.800> actually<00:01:02.039> that's<00:01:02.879> a<00:01:03.120> two<00:01:03.420> in<00:01:04.100> reality<00:01:05.479> the

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
but actually that's a two in reality the

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.230 
but actually that's a two in reality the
king<00:01:06.720> is<00:01:06.899> on<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.140> bottom<00:01:07.729> now<00:01:08.729> if<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:08.970> Kings

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
king is on the bottom now if the Kings

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.660 
king is on the bottom now if the Kings
on<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.570> bottom<00:01:09.930> and<00:01:10.140> I<00:01:10.770> reverse<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.490> order

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
on the bottom and I reverse the order

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.359 
on the bottom and I reverse the order
again<00:01:12.149> that<00:01:13.020> should<00:01:13.410> bring<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.800> king<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.340> the

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
again that should bring the king to the

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.870 
again that should bring the king to the
top<00:01:14.899> but

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
top but

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.750 
top but
second<00:01:17.880> from<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.090> top<00:01:18.180> I<00:01:19.549> tell<00:01:20.549> you<00:01:20.610> what

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:20.760 
second from the top I tell you what

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.500 
second from the top I tell you what
let's<00:01:21.570> eliminate<00:01:21.780> one<00:01:22.440> of<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.619> cards<00:01:23.040> and

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:23.510 
let's eliminate one of the cards and

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:28.280 
let's eliminate one of the cards and
we'll<00:01:24.510> mix<00:01:24.720> up<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.470> remaining<00:01:25.830> three<00:01:27.290> and

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
we'll mix up the remaining three and

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.310 
we'll mix up the remaining three and
we'll<00:01:28.440> see<00:01:28.619> where<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.890> king<00:01:29.130> is<00:01:29.960> it's<00:01:30.960> not<00:01:31.170> on

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
we'll see where the king is it's not on

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.290 
we'll see where the king is it's not on
the<00:01:31.440> top<00:01:33.170> it's<00:01:34.170> not<00:01:34.350> on<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.619> bottom<00:01:34.860> and

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:35.300 
the top it's not on the bottom and

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.960 
the top it's not on the bottom and
that's<00:01:36.300> not<00:01:36.540> there<00:01:36.869> either<00:01:37.729> you're<00:01:38.729> probably

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
that's not there either you're probably

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.260 
that's not there either you're probably
thinking<00:01:39.270> this<00:01:39.600> is<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:39.990> king<00:01:40.369> no<00:01:41.369> that's<00:01:41.940> the

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270
