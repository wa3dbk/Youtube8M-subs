00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
game is you can see where this red

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.279 
game is you can see where this red
circle<00:00:14.519> and<00:00:14.849> we're<00:00:14.940> rotating<00:00:15.210> around<00:00:15.990> this

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
circle and we're rotating around this

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.890 
circle and we're rotating around this
light<00:00:16.470> grey<00:00:16.830> circle<00:00:17.699> thing<00:00:18.119> and<00:00:18.539> we<00:00:18.630> have<00:00:18.779> to

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
light grey circle thing and we have to

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.200 
light grey circle thing and we have to
tap<00:00:19.289> to<00:00:19.529> try<00:00:19.800> to<00:00:19.859> jump<00:00:20.340> to<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:20.609> other<00:00:20.699> circle

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
tap to try to jump to the other circle

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.300 
tap to try to jump to the other circle
as<00:00:21.300> you<00:00:21.420> can<00:00:21.570> see<00:00:21.869> there<00:00:22.140> and<00:00:22.380> that's<00:00:23.070> that's

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
as you can see there and that's that's

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.670 
as you can see there and that's that's
what<00:00:23.519> we<00:00:23.640> do<00:00:23.850> and<00:00:24.060> it<00:00:24.300> looks<00:00:24.449> really<00:00:24.510> easy<00:00:24.720> but

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
what we do and it looks really easy but

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.040 
what we do and it looks really easy but
I<00:00:25.920> assure<00:00:26.400> you<00:00:26.430> it<00:00:26.789> is<00:00:26.970> not<00:00:27.000> that<00:00:27.570> easy

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
I assure you it is not that easy

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.169 
I assure you it is not that easy
especially<00:00:28.830> when<00:00:29.189> you<00:00:29.340> land<00:00:29.580> on<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:29.820> smaller

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
especially when you land on the smaller

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:31.970 
especially when you land on the smaller
circles<00:00:30.660> because<00:00:30.779> you<00:00:30.929> can<00:00:31.019> see<00:00:31.199> on<00:00:31.320> my<00:00:31.349> my

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
circles because you can see on my my

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.010 
circles because you can see on my my
balls<00:00:32.250> on<00:00:32.520> this<00:00:32.700> small<00:00:32.940> circle<00:00:33.420> it<00:00:33.510> spins<00:00:33.840> a

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
balls on this small circle it spins a

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.900 
balls on this small circle it spins a
lot<00:00:34.260> faster<00:00:34.559> than<00:00:35.219> when<00:00:35.370> it's<00:00:35.489> on<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.730> big

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
lot faster than when it's on the big

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.119 
lot faster than when it's on the big
circles<00:00:36.329> so<00:00:36.690> it's<00:00:36.809> a<00:00:36.870> lot<00:00:37.050> harder<00:00:37.260> to<00:00:37.559> tie<00:00:37.829> what

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
circles so it's a lot harder to tie what

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.030 
circles so it's a lot harder to tie what
what<00:00:38.760> we're<00:00:39.420> gonna<00:00:39.510> try<00:00:39.840> to<00:00:40.469> get<00:00:40.590> a<00:00:40.649> new<00:00:40.860> high

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
what we're gonna try to get a new high

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.220 
what we're gonna try to get a new high
score<00:00:41.430> here<00:00:41.820> and<00:00:42.210> I<00:00:42.300> think<00:00:42.600> that<00:00:42.750> my<00:00:42.870> current

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
score here and I think that my current

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.979 
score here and I think that my current
high<00:00:43.320> score<00:00:43.350> is<00:00:43.950> seven<00:00:44.670> I<00:00:44.879> think<00:00:45.660> that's<00:00:45.840> what

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
high score is seven I think that's what

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.900 
high score is seven I think that's what
it<00:00:46.079> was<00:00:46.110> what<00:00:46.800> I<00:00:46.980> want<00:00:47.219> to<00:00:47.280> try<00:00:47.489> to<00:00:47.520> beat<00:00:47.879> that

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
it was what I want to try to beat that

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.029 
it was what I want to try to beat that
and<00:00:48.899> you<00:00:48.989> can<00:00:49.140> see<00:00:49.379> it<00:00:49.559> gets<00:00:49.710> more<00:00:49.980> difficult

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
and you can see it gets more difficult

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.330 
and you can see it gets more difficult
and<00:00:50.670> they<00:00:50.760> start<00:00:51.149> to<00:00:51.329> to<00:00:51.899> change<00:00:52.320> places<00:00:52.920> and

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
and they start to to change places and

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.160 
and they start to to change places and
move<00:00:53.520> and<00:00:54.000> this<00:00:54.120> is<00:00:54.300> a<00:00:54.329> pretty<00:00:54.570> small<00:00:54.690> circle

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
move and this is a pretty small circle

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.420 
move and this is a pretty small circle
so<00:00:55.230> you<00:00:55.289> can<00:00:55.410> see<00:00:55.530> my<00:00:55.649> circles<00:00:56.010> moving<00:00:56.280> pretty

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
so you can see my circles moving pretty

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.080 
so you can see my circles moving pretty
fast<00:00:57.120> which<00:00:58.050> is<00:00:58.079> not<00:00:58.410> good<00:00:58.680> for<00:00:58.949> us<00:00:59.340> I'm<00:00:59.910> gonna

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
have to jump that was really bad it's so

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.390 
have to jump that was really bad it's so
frustrating<00:01:28.200> when<00:01:28.650> you<00:01:28.770> have<00:01:28.860> to<00:01:28.950> jump<00:01:29.159> the

frustrating when you have to jump the

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.910 
frustrating when you have to jump the
little<00:01:29.549> ones<00:01:29.880> because<00:01:30.659> they're<00:01:30.990> so<00:01:31.229> small<00:01:31.619> and

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
little ones because they're so small and

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.830 
little ones because they're so small and
then<00:01:32.280> once<00:01:32.549> you<00:01:32.670> get<00:01:32.880> to<00:01:32.909> them<00:01:33.150> you're<00:01:33.450> your

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
then once you get to them you're your

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.719 
then once you get to them you're your
thing<00:01:34.200> rotates<00:01:34.380> so<00:01:34.799> fast<00:01:35.070> around<00:01:35.280> them<00:01:35.549> that

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
thing rotates so fast around them that

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.630 
thing rotates so fast around them that
it's<00:01:35.850> difficult<00:01:36.390> little<00:01:37.350> ones<00:01:37.530> I<00:01:37.650> or<00:01:38.280> what

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
it's difficult little ones I or what

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.460 
it's difficult little ones I or what
make<00:01:38.850> this<00:01:39.000> game<00:01:39.240> hard<00:01:39.509> if<00:01:39.659> this<00:01:39.930> game<00:01:40.140> was<00:01:40.290> all

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
make this game hard if this game was all
