a 1 3 and 5 on a d minor 1 3 5 e F&amp;A 1 2
3<00:02:35.630> 4<00:02:35.989> 5<00:02:36.350> D<00:02:37.310> F<00:02:37.610> a<00:02:38.120> 1<00:02:38.480> 3<00:02:38.900> 5<00:02:39.380> just<00:02:40.160> play<00:02:40.340> it<00:02:40.400> in<00:02:40.519> a

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
3 4 5 D F a 1 3 5 just play it in a

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:46.199 
3 4 5 D F a 1 3 5 just play it in a
higher<00:02:40.760> register<00:02:41.330> that's<00:02:41.480> all

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:49.210 

so<00:02:47.209> if<00:02:47.270> that's<00:02:47.450> a<00:02:47.569> d-minor<00:02:48.050> then<00:02:48.800> this<00:02:48.950> is<00:02:49.099> an

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
so if that's a d-minor then this is an

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:54.040 
so if that's a d-minor then this is an

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 
e-minor then this is an F but then this

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.839 
e-minor then this is an F but then this
is<00:02:54.110> a<00:02:54.260> GUI<00:02:54.709> and<00:02:55.670> this<00:02:55.910> is<00:02:56.060> an<00:02:56.180> a<00:02:56.269> minor<00:02:57.849> which

00:02:58.839 --> 00:02:58.849

is a GUI and this is an a minor which

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:10.620 
fret third string but I'm going to
switch<00:05:09.700> fingers<00:05:09.910> because<00:05:10.270> it's<00:05:10.419> more

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:10.630 
switch fingers because it's more

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:12.210 
switch fingers because it's more
convenient<00:05:11.050> and<00:05:11.350> it's<00:05:11.590> an<00:05:11.710> easier<00:05:12.070> way<00:05:12.190> to

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:12.220 
convenient and it's an easier way to

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:14.850 
convenient and it's an easier way to
change<00:05:12.669> I<00:05:12.940> don't<00:05:13.720> know<00:05:13.990> whether<00:05:14.169> the<00:05:14.380> edge<00:05:14.530> did

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:14.860 
change I don't know whether the edge did

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.380 
change I don't know whether the edge did
it<00:05:14.950> that<00:05:15.100> way<00:05:15.250> I'm<00:05:15.370> just<00:05:15.400> making<00:05:15.910> it<00:05:16.030> easier

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:16.390 
it that way I'm just making it easier

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:19.320 
it that way I'm just making it easier
for<00:05:16.570> myself<00:05:16.720> and<00:05:17.140> being<00:05:17.620> practical<00:05:18.310> so<00:05:18.910> what<00:05:19.300> I

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:19.330

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:48.600 
so I'm going to it's going to go

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:51.470 
so I'm going to it's going to go
and<00:05:48.780> the<00:05:49.320> picking<00:05:49.950> sequence<00:05:50.310> is<00:05:50.520> third<00:05:51.090> string

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:51.480 
and the picking sequence is third string

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:52.940 
and the picking sequence is third string
second<00:05:51.930> string<00:05:51.960> first<00:05:52.440> string<00:05:52.740> and<00:05:52.800> then

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:52.950 
second string first string and then

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:56.380 
second string first string and then
second<00:05:53.460> string<00:05:53.730> so<00:05:54.180> down<00:05:54.420> down<00:05:54.750> down<00:05:55.170> out

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:56.390 
second string so down down down out

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:58.960 
second string so down down down out
then<00:05:57.380> it<00:05:57.470> goes<00:05:57.590> to<00:05:57.620> the<00:05:57.860> D<00:05:58.010> major<00:05:58.220> by<00:05:58.490> taking<00:05:58.850> my

00:05:58.960 --> 00:05:58.970 
then it goes to the D major by taking my

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:01.749 
then it goes to the D major by taking my
pinkie<00:05:59.300> off<00:05:59.420> down<00:05:59.780> down<00:06:00.200> down<00:06:00.680> up

00:06:01.749 --> 00:06:01.759 
pinkie off down down down up

00:06:01.759 --> 00:06:03.760 
pinkie off down down down up
and<00:06:02.059> then<00:06:02.419> it<00:06:02.509> goes<00:06:02.689> to<00:06:02.719> an<00:06:03.080> odd<00:06:03.259> form<00:06:03.559> of

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:03.770 
and then it goes to an odd form of

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:07.089 
and then it goes to an odd form of
g-major<00:06:03.979> open<00:06:04.789> open<00:06:05.330> third<00:06:05.539> string<00:06:05.889> and<00:06:06.889> then

00:06:07.089 --> 00:06:07.099 
g-major open open third string and then

00:06:07.099 --> 00:06:09.070 
g-major open open third string and then
fretted<00:06:07.669> with<00:06:07.849> my<00:06:08.240> third<00:06:08.509> finger<00:06:08.779> because

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:09.080 
fretted with my third finger because

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:10.480 
fretted with my third finger because
that's<00:06:09.259> the<00:06:09.349> easiest<00:06:09.650> way<00:06:09.830> to<00:06:09.860> go<00:06:10.069> from<00:06:10.219> the<00:06:10.339> D

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:10.490 
that's the easiest way to go from the D

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:12.279 
that's the easiest way to go from the D
to<00:06:10.550> the<00:06:10.759> G<00:06:10.969> because<00:06:11.389> that's<00:06:11.569> really<00:06:11.900> based<00:06:12.110> on

00:06:12.279 --> 00:06:12.289 
to the G because that's really based on

00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:15.249 
to the G because that's really based on
a<00:06:12.349> G<00:06:12.650> so<00:06:13.279> my<00:06:13.520> third<00:06:13.789> finger<00:06:14.029> is<00:06:14.270> fretted<00:06:14.900> at<00:06:15.139> the

00:06:15.249 --> 00:06:15.259 
a G so my third finger is fretted at the

00:06:15.259 --> 00:06:17.709 
a G so my third finger is fretted at the
third<00:06:15.529> fret<00:06:15.830> second<00:06:16.699> string<00:06:16.729> and<00:06:17.089> then<00:06:17.180> open<00:06:17.509> E

00:06:17.709 --> 00:06:17.719 
third fret second string and then open E

00:06:17.719 --> 00:06:19.899 
third fret second string and then open E
so<00:06:18.259> all<00:06:18.409> together<00:06:18.589> now<00:06:18.979> this<00:06:19.189> is<00:06:19.370> what<00:06:19.520> happens

00:06:19.899 --> 00:06:19.909 
so all together now this is what happens

00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:27.370 
so all together now this is what happens
from<00:06:20.089> the<00:06:20.240> B<00:06:20.389> minor

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:27.380 

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:37.899 

do<00:06:28.220> that<00:06:28.400> again<00:06:28.700> 1<00:06:29.240> 2<00:06:29.960> 3<00:06:30.430> 4

00:06:37.899 --> 00:06:37.909 

00:06:37.909 --> 00:06:39.850 

and<00:06:38.360> when<00:06:38.509> the<00:06:38.629> song<00:06:38.839> really<00:06:39.110> kicks<00:06:39.439> in<00:06:39.679> you

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:39.860 
and when the song really kicks in you

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:41.739 
and when the song really kicks in you
know<00:06:39.949> then<00:06:40.219> the<00:06:40.909> edge<00:06:41.029> kicks<00:06:41.389> on<00:06:41.569> is

00:06:41.739 --> 00:06:41.749 
know then the edge kicks on is

00:06:41.749 --> 00:06:43.779 
know then the edge kicks on is
distortion<00:06:42.379> and<00:06:42.559> he<00:06:42.800> plays<00:06:43.039> the<00:06:43.069> chords<00:06:43.490> in

00:06:43.779 --> 00:06:43.789 
distortion and he plays the chords in

00:06:43.789 --> 00:06:46.899 
distortion and he plays the chords in
bar<00:06:44.749> form<00:06:45.110> based<00:06:45.529> on<00:06:45.830> what<00:06:46.309> he<00:06:46.399> just<00:06:46.610> did<00:06:46.759> in

00:06:46.899 --> 00:06:46.909 
bar form based on what he just did in

00:06:46.909 --> 00:06:50.769 
bar form based on what he just did in
the<00:06:47.029> era<00:06:47.119> ped<00:06:47.330> you<00:06:47.509> a<00:06:47.539> B<00:06:47.809> minor<00:06:48.050> a<00:06:49.509> teenager<00:06:50.509> in

00:06:50.769 --> 00:06:50.779 
the era ped you a B minor a teenager in

00:06:50.779 --> 00:06:53.830 
the era ped you a B minor a teenager in
the<00:06:50.869> teenager

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:53.840

you

00:06:59.050 --> 00:06:59.060 

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:04.370 

isn't<00:07:00.060> that<00:07:00.120> cool<00:07:00.600> so<00:07:01.380> the<00:07:02.190> edges<00:07:02.670> using<00:07:03.380> the

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:04.380 
isn't that cool so the edges using the

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:09.830 
isn't that cool so the edges using the
triads<00:07:05.130> as<00:07:05.460> an<00:07:06.390> intro<00:07:06.960> and<00:07:07.730> picking<00:07:08.730> it<00:07:08.850> eric

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:09.840 
triads as an intro and picking it eric

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:13.640 
triads as an intro and picking it eric
clapton<00:07:10.380> used<00:07:10.890> two<00:07:11.100> triads<00:07:11.720> as<00:07:12.720> a<00:07:12.780> solo<00:07:13.320> to

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:13.650 
clapton used two triads as a solo to

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:16.460 
clapton used two triads as a solo to
create<00:07:13.920> a<00:07:13.980> big<00:07:14.190> fat<00:07:14.690> sounding<00:07:15.690> ringing<00:07:16.110> solo
