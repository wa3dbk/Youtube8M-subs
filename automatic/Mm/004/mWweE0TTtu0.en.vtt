00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.299
 but 52 points 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:30.320
 52 points still scored firewood there and 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:36.660
 He comes to the table in O'Sullivan 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:39.800
 reception turn to take some very not 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:43.649
 I know serious ronnie 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:46.739
 rarely rarely smiles steve davis tony 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.960
 dredge even henry at all seems to me 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:53.670
 more often than ronnie anyone can be 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:57.629
 I really don't know 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:00.539
 how to say charge before after championship 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:03.049
 the world has not gone still fresh first 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:07.580
 of memories 

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:07.580
 this seems to me to be present 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:15.150
 level sullivanu because well, again 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:19.460
 for him this is not the first such 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:22.140
 show competitions and that's it 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:25.290
 Who missed the whole past season 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:28.590
 played a lot of these and in the legends snooker and 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.400
 un show matches with jimmy white he 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:36.000
 whole line 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:37.979
 exhibition matches he spent maybe 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.780
 actually it affects more that's 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:44.850
 here is a recent championship appearance 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:47.820
 of the world how everything turned out now 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:53.189
 level sullivan he opened now 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:55.950
 position of applause from the audience 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:02:07.789
 certainly for such a blow 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:07.789
 and another ball my game I stack 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.080
 your 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.010
 use 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.280
 Wait 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:53.070
 Well, 14 points from the country ronnie 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:03:00.140
 o'Sullivan and well he goes to the ending 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:03:03.330
 where almost all the colored balls except black 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:06.930
 located on its marks steven 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:08.820
 Hendry so in one point I'm looking 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.370
 didn't even understand he looks at the table or 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:13.590
 just seems to me watching watching 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.750
 precisely on those as O'Sullivan 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.550
 protects the table and and recognize them 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.130
 can really turn out first 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:24.030
 1 mother doubles match without replay 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:30.750
 black and yes victory net doubles 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:32.190
 REP match for the black box and need 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:36.330
 also play now six points 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:43.560
 advantage and could and northern ireland 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:47.130
 and black gives victory to steve davis 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:51.320
 sullivan wins steven hendry 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:51.320
 it does not drive and the score becomes 5
