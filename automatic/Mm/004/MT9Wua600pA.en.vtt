this<00:00:12.519> video<00:00:12.790> is<00:00:12.970> the<00:00:13.390> digital<00:00:13.809> sketching

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:14.380 
this video is the digital sketching

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:17.819 
this video is the digital sketching
portion<00:00:14.890> of<00:00:15.519> the<00:00:16.119> entire<00:00:16.449> process<00:00:16.749> I<00:00:17.230> didn't

00:00:17.819 --> 00:00:17.829 
portion of the entire process I didn't

00:00:17.829 --> 00:00:20.429 
portion of the entire process I didn't
record<00:00:18.159> the<00:00:18.400> entire<00:00:18.789> name<00:00:19.539> which<00:00:20.079> took<00:00:20.289> about

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:20.439 
record the entire name which took about

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:23.729 
record the entire name which took about
five<00:00:20.769> hours<00:00:21.089> but<00:00:22.089> you'll<00:00:22.599> see<00:00:22.869> a<00:00:22.900> good<00:00:23.499> chunk

00:00:23.729 --> 00:00:23.739 
five hours but you'll see a good chunk

00:00:23.739 --> 00:00:28.589 
five hours but you'll see a good chunk
of<00:00:23.829> it<00:00:25.409> this<00:00:26.409> is<00:00:26.470> being<00:00:27.399> recorded<00:00:27.550> about<00:00:28.149> ten

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:28.599 
of it this is being recorded about ten

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:30.929 
of it this is being recorded about ten
times<00:00:28.839> speed<00:00:29.319> which<00:00:29.619> is<00:00:29.800> how<00:00:29.979> fast<00:00:30.489> I'd<00:00:30.729> like

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:30.939 
times speed which is how fast I'd like

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:34.040 
times speed which is how fast I'd like
to<00:00:31.060> draw<00:00:31.569> but<00:00:32.500> do<00:00:33.129> what<00:00:33.250> we<00:00:33.340> can

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
to draw but do what we can

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.660 
to draw but do what we can
the<00:00:35.050> main<00:00:35.199> reason<00:00:35.500> that<00:00:35.530> I<00:00:35.859> do<00:00:35.980> digital

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:36.670 
the main reason that I do digital

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.240 
the main reason that I do digital
sketching<00:00:37.120> it's<00:00:37.750> in<00:00:38.019> Photoshop<00:00:38.530> and<00:00:38.859> it's<00:00:39.129> on

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:39.250 
sketching it's in Photoshop and it's on

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.209 
sketching it's in Photoshop and it's on
a<00:00:39.280> Cintiq<00:00:39.640> tablet<00:00:40.140> is<00:00:41.140> so<00:00:41.410> that<00:00:41.590> I<00:00:41.620> can

00:00:42.209 --> 00:00:42.219 
a Cintiq tablet is so that I can

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:45.779 
a Cintiq tablet is so that I can
rearrange<00:00:43.059> the<00:00:43.600> composition<00:00:44.489> each<00:00:45.489> of<00:00:45.730> the

00:00:45.779 --> 00:00:45.789 
rearrange the composition each of the

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:49.319 
rearrange the composition each of the
figures<00:00:45.969> individually<00:00:46.870> or<00:00:47.109> as<00:00:47.739> groups<00:00:48.489> so

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:49.329 
figures individually or as groups so

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:51.419 
figures individually or as groups so
what<00:00:49.449> you'll<00:00:49.600> see<00:00:49.629> here<00:00:50.079> is<00:00:50.140> I<00:00:50.320> have<00:00:50.350> five<00:00:50.859> main

00:00:51.419 --> 00:00:51.429 
what you'll see here is I have five main

00:00:51.429 --> 00:00:55.560 
what you'll see here is I have five main
groups<00:00:52.320> with<00:00:53.320> a<00:00:53.350> separate<00:00:53.859> layer<00:00:54.070> for<00:00:54.570> both

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:55.570 
groups with a separate layer for both

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.380 
groups with a separate layer for both
the<00:00:55.809> Cape<00:00:56.079> the<00:00:57.070> main<00:00:57.249> figure<00:00:57.550> of<00:00:57.640> Superman<00:00:58.089> and

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:58.390 
the Cape the main figure of Superman and

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.319 
the Cape the main figure of Superman and
then<00:00:58.839> his<00:00:59.109> his<00:00:59.920> nemesis<00:01:00.489> in<00:01:00.789> the<00:01:00.879> foreground

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:01.329 
then his his nemesis in the foreground

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:03.860 
then his his nemesis in the foreground
which<00:01:01.600> I<00:01:01.899> don't<00:01:02.350> get<00:01:02.469> to<00:01:02.559> draw<00:01:02.739> on<00:01:02.920> this<00:01:03.039> video

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
which I don't get to draw on this video

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.560 
which I don't get to draw on this video
the<00:01:04.870> main<00:01:05.050> reason<00:01:05.380> that<00:01:05.410> I<00:01:05.530> do<00:01:05.620> this<00:01:05.980> is<00:01:06.970> it

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:07.570 
the main reason that I do this is it

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.870 
the main reason that I do this is it
makes<00:01:07.810> it<00:01:07.930> very<00:01:08.050> easy<00:01:08.170> to<00:01:08.710> scale<00:01:09.550> things

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
makes it very easy to scale things

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.110 
makes it very easy to scale things
rotate<00:01:10.570> them<00:01:10.810> and<00:01:11.050> just<00:01:11.980> fit<00:01:12.400> everything<00:01:12.580> in

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:13.120 
rotate them and just fit everything in

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.880 
rotate them and just fit everything in
with<00:01:13.570> a<00:01:13.630> composition<00:01:14.170> that<00:01:14.530> is<00:01:14.590> this

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890 
with a composition that is this

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.980 
with a composition that is this
complicated<00:01:17.640> you'll<00:01:18.640> see<00:01:18.850> as<00:01:18.970> I<00:01:19.150> kind<00:01:19.660> of<00:01:19.780> move

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
complicated you'll see as I kind of move

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.380 
complicated you'll see as I kind of move
things<00:01:20.170> around<00:01:20.380> draw<00:01:21.130> things<00:01:21.430> as<00:01:21.760> I<00:01:21.970> get<00:01:22.270> to

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 
things around draw things as I get to

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.920 
things around draw things as I get to
them<00:01:22.860> I'm<00:01:23.860> zooming<00:01:24.220> in<00:01:24.340> and<00:01:24.490> out<00:01:24.720> just<00:01:25.720> to<00:01:25.810> get

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:25.930 
them I'm zooming in and out just to get

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:27.780 
them I'm zooming in and out just to get
a<00:01:25.960> better<00:01:26.170> better<00:01:26.770> idea<00:01:27.160> of<00:01:27.250> where<00:01:27.460> I<00:01:27.490> am

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:27.790 
a better better idea of where I am

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:30.080 
a better better idea of where I am
sometimes<00:01:28.360> I'll<00:01:28.510> rotate<00:01:28.960> the<00:01:29.620> entire

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
sometimes I'll rotate the entire

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.730 
sometimes I'll rotate the entire
composition<00:01:31.090> just<00:01:31.960> to<00:01:32.020> get<00:01:32.110> a<00:01:32.140> better<00:01:32.320> angle

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
composition just to get a better angle

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.400 
composition just to get a better angle
on<00:01:32.920> things<00:01:33.570> you<00:01:34.570> may<00:01:34.720> also<00:01:34.870> notice<00:01:35.200> that<00:01:35.260> I

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:35.410 
on things you may also notice that I

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:37.650 
on things you may also notice that I
color<00:01:35.770> code<00:01:36.070> each<00:01:36.340> of<00:01:36.520> the<00:01:36.640> layers<00:01:36.880> which

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:37.660 
color code each of the layers which

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.180 
color code each of the layers which
makes<00:01:37.930> things<00:01:38.140> easier<00:01:38.560> to<00:01:38.710> distinguish

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:39.190 
makes things easier to distinguish

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.000 
makes things easier to distinguish
between<00:01:39.400> one<00:01:39.850> layer<00:01:40.060> another<00:01:40.740> now<00:01:41.740> the<00:01:41.800> way<00:01:41.980> I

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:42.010 
between one layer another now the way I

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:44.040 
between one layer another now the way I
do<00:01:42.160> that<00:01:42.460> now<00:01:43.180> is<00:01:43.390> a<00:01:43.420> little<00:01:43.630> bit<00:01:43.720> different

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:44.050 
do that now is a little bit different

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:46.020 
do that now is a little bit different
than<00:01:44.140> the<00:01:44.230> way<00:01:44.320> I<00:01:44.350> did<00:01:44.530> it<00:01:44.650> back<00:01:44.830> then<00:01:44.860> now<00:01:45.850> what

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
than the way I did it back then now what

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.460 
than the way I did it back then now what
I<00:01:46.060> do<00:01:46.180> is<00:01:46.480> I<00:01:46.690> double<00:01:47.470> click<00:01:47.650> on<00:01:47.800> the<00:01:47.950> layer<00:01:48.190> and

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
I do is I double click on the layer and

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.590 
I do is I double click on the layer and
set<00:01:50.470> the<00:01:50.620> layer<00:01:50.800> properties<00:01:51.370> to<00:01:51.760> color

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
set the layer properties to color

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.230 
set the layer properties to color
overlay<00:01:53.200> and<00:01:54.100> what<00:01:54.520> that<00:01:54.670> does<00:01:54.790> is<00:01:54.970> it<00:01:55.090> covers

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
overlay and what that does is it covers

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.020 
overlay and what that does is it covers
the<00:01:55.450> entire<00:01:55.780> layer<00:01:56.110> in<00:01:56.980> a<00:01:57.340> single<00:01:57.730> color<00:01:57.940> of

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
the entire layer in a single color of

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.300 
the entire layer in a single color of
your<00:01:58.270> choosing<00:01:58.510> here<00:01:59.380> you<00:01:59.530> know<00:01:59.650> using<00:02:00.070> red

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
your choosing here you know using red

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.290 
your choosing here you know using red
blue<00:02:00.670> green<00:02:01.360> and<00:02:01.480> yellow<00:02:01.780> and<00:02:03.030> then<00:02:04.030> you<00:02:04.120> can

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:04.300 
blue green and yellow and then you can

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.009 
blue green and yellow and then you can
move<00:02:04.810> the<00:02:05.050> opacity<00:02:05.500> down<00:02:06.190> a<00:02:06.730> bit<00:02:07.060> which<00:02:07.690> allows

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:08.019 
move the opacity down a bit which allows

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:11.340 
move the opacity down a bit which allows
you<00:02:08.229> to<00:02:08.259> see<00:02:08.590> the<00:02:09.130> sketching<00:02:09.880> like<00:02:10.750> the<00:02:10.899> marks

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
you to see the sketching like the marks

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:13.380 
you to see the sketching like the marks
underneath<00:02:11.710> with<00:02:12.700> just<00:02:12.910> a<00:02:12.970> little<00:02:13.090> bit<00:02:13.210> of

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
underneath with just a little bit of

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:14.110 
underneath with just a little bit of
tone<00:02:13.630> on<00:02:13.810> top

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
tone on top

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.790 
tone on top
so<00:02:14.480> they<00:02:14.569> look<00:02:14.750> different<00:02:15.110> than<00:02:15.260> Marx<00:02:15.680> in

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
so they look different than Marx in

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.240 
so they look different than Marx in
another<00:02:16.040> layer<00:02:16.580> I<00:02:17.260> only<00:02:18.260> draw<00:02:18.560> in<00:02:18.800> black<00:02:19.010> and

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
another layer I only draw in black and

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.479 
another layer I only draw in black and
white<00:02:19.400> so<00:02:19.459> this<00:02:19.880> helps<00:02:20.180> distinguish<00:02:20.660> the<00:02:21.489> you

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
white so this helps distinguish the you

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:31.559 
white so this helps distinguish the you
know<00:02:22.580> the<00:02:23.120> figures<00:02:23.450> from<00:02:23.630> another<00:02:23.930> one

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:31.569 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:37.290 

you

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.530 

I<00:02:38.490> hear<00:02:39.490> what<00:02:39.640> you<00:02:39.760> can<00:02:39.910> see<00:02:40.090> is<00:02:40.240> I<00:02:40.390> actually

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
I hear what you can see is I actually

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.080 
I hear what you can see is I actually
wrote<00:02:41.050> in<00:02:41.400> the<00:02:42.400> name<00:02:42.610> of<00:02:42.790> one<00:02:42.910> of<00:02:43.000> the

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
wrote in the name of one of the

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.870 
wrote in the name of one of the
characters<00:02:43.300> just<00:02:44.050> as<00:02:44.200> a<00:02:44.230> placeholder<00:02:44.770> so<00:02:45.310> I

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
characters just as a placeholder so I

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.200 
characters just as a placeholder so I
could<00:02:46.270> remember<00:02:46.780> what<00:02:47.170> exactly<00:02:47.620> goes<00:02:47.800> there

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.210 
could remember what exactly goes there

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.610 
could remember what exactly goes there
when<00:02:49.210> when<00:02:49.480> dealing<00:02:49.630> with<00:02:49.840> this<00:02:49.930> many<00:02:50.170> figures

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
when when dealing with this many figures

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.370 
when when dealing with this many figures
and<00:02:51.370> I'm<00:02:51.730> trying<00:02:52.000> to<00:02:52.030> go<00:02:52.180> for<00:02:52.450> a<00:02:52.540> specific

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
story with you know quite a I think it

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.860 
story with you know quite a I think it
went<00:02:57.550> over<00:02:57.670> the<00:02:57.880> course<00:02:58.120> of<00:02:58.210> 18<00:02:58.420> issues

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
went over the course of 18 issues

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.260 
went over the course of 18 issues
there's<00:02:59.410> just<00:02:59.560> a<00:02:59.620> lot<00:02:59.740> of<00:02:59.890> luck<00:03:00.250> to<00:03:00.850> keep<00:03:01.000> track

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:01.270 
there's just a lot of luck to keep track

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.120 
there's just a lot of luck to keep track
of<00:03:01.510> as<00:03:01.720> you're<00:03:02.050> going<00:03:02.170> along<00:03:02.410> it's<00:03:02.800> easy<00:03:02.980> to

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
of as you're going along it's easy to

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.640 
of as you're going along it's easy to
forget<00:03:03.400> things<00:03:03.580> I<00:03:03.880> also<00:03:04.450> wasn't<00:03:04.720> particularly

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
forget things I also wasn't particularly

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.350 
forget things I also wasn't particularly
familiar<00:03:05.860> with<00:03:06.190> the<00:03:06.400> characters<00:03:06.850> and<00:03:06.880> this<00:03:07.240> is

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
familiar with the characters and this is

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.110 
familiar with the characters and this is
the<00:03:07.480> first<00:03:07.660> time<00:03:07.810> I<00:03:07.840> read<00:03:08.710> the<00:03:08.950> new<00:03:09.760> take<00:03:10.000> on

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
the first time I read the new take on

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.160 
the first time I read the new take on
Superman<00:03:12.030> it<00:03:13.030> just<00:03:13.240> kind<00:03:13.390> of<00:03:13.420> helps<00:03:13.660> you<00:03:14.080> know

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
Superman it just kind of helps you know

Superman it just kind of helps you know
keep<00:03:14.590> things<00:03:14.740> organized<00:03:16.470> you<00:03:17.470> know<00:03:17.500> as<00:03:17.680> you

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:17.770 
keep things organized you know as you

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:19.350 
keep things organized you know as you
can<00:03:17.800> see<00:03:18.040> I<00:03:18.070> keep<00:03:18.310> redrawing<00:03:18.820> a<00:03:19.060> lot<00:03:19.240> of

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.360 
can see I keep redrawing a lot of

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.890 
can see I keep redrawing a lot of
figures

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
figures

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.220 
figures
it's<00:03:20.230> just<00:03:20.470> what<00:03:20.620> what<00:03:21.010> happens<00:03:22.200> you<00:03:23.200> know

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
it's just what what happens you know

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.050 
it's just what what happens you know
anytime<00:03:23.680> the<00:03:23.830> figures<00:03:24.340> have<00:03:24.550> to<00:03:24.670> actually

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
anytime the figures have to actually

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.510 
anytime the figures have to actually
interact<00:03:25.650> you<00:03:26.650> know<00:03:26.680> it's<00:03:26.890> easy<00:03:27.040> when<00:03:27.280> they're

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:27.520 
interact you know it's easy when they're

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.330 
interact you know it's easy when they're
all<00:03:28.510> just<00:03:28.840> kind<00:03:29.020> of<00:03:29.050> floating<00:03:29.410> there<00:03:29.620> or<00:03:29.920> you

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
all just kind of floating there or you

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:31.680 
all just kind of floating there or you
know<00:03:30.490> they're<00:03:30.640> all<00:03:30.760> heading<00:03:31.120> towards<00:03:31.420> the

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
know they're all heading towards the

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.200 
know they're all heading towards the
viewer<00:03:32.170> and<00:03:32.530> doing<00:03:32.800> their<00:03:32.920> own<00:03:32.950> thing<00:03:33.370> but

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:34.210 
viewer and doing their own thing but

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:35.790

when<00:03:34.480> figures<00:03:34.870> in<00:03:35.170> Iraq<00:03:35.470> and<00:03:35.710> actually

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:35.800 
when figures in Iraq and actually

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.710 
when figures in Iraq and actually
actually<00:03:36.460> touch<00:03:36.730> each<00:03:36.760> other<00:03:37.150> as<00:03:37.390> in<00:03:37.600> this

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
actually touch each other as in this

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.530 
actually touch each other as in this
case<00:03:38.370> you<00:03:39.370> you<00:03:39.670> often<00:03:39.970> have<00:03:40.120> to<00:03:40.150> end<00:03:40.450> up

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
case you you often have to end up

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.360 
case you you often have to end up
redrawing<00:03:41.080> things<00:03:41.410> over<00:03:41.980> and<00:03:42.100> over<00:03:42.280> again

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
redrawing things over and over again

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.120 
redrawing things over and over again
just<00:03:42.850> to<00:03:42.940> get<00:03:43.060> the<00:03:43.150> right<00:03:43.300> feel<00:03:43.540> for<00:03:43.810> it<00:03:44.130> you

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130 
just to get the right feel for it you

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:46.710 
just to get the right feel for it you
know<00:03:45.220> that<00:03:45.370> that's<00:03:45.640> almost<00:03:45.910> the<00:03:46.360> the<00:03:46.540> biggest

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
know that that's almost the the biggest

challenge in in comics in general at
least<00:03:50.800> I<00:03:50.920> find<00:03:51.959> you<00:03:52.959> know<00:03:53.050> these<00:03:53.830> massive

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.670 
least I find you know these massive
montages<00:03:55.030> are<00:03:55.570> actually<00:03:55.930> easier<00:03:56.350> than<00:03:56.530> most

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
montages are actually easier than most

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.830 
montages are actually easier than most
things<00:03:57.010> because<00:03:57.459> everybody<00:03:58.270> can<00:03:58.510> kind<00:03:58.690> of

float in their own space and you don't

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:03.479 
float in their own space and you don't
have<00:04:01.330> to<00:04:01.480> worry<00:04:01.690> about<00:04:01.840> everyone<00:04:02.590> you<00:04:02.830> know

on<00:04:26.940> the<00:04:27.150> right<00:04:27.330> you<00:04:27.510> can<00:04:27.660> see<00:04:27.840> where<00:04:27.990> I

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 
on the right you can see where I

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.770 
on the right you can see where I
actually<00:04:28.640> listed<00:04:29.640> all<00:04:29.850> the<00:04:29.880> characters<00:04:30.570> that

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
actually listed all the characters that

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.650 
actually listed all the characters that
I<00:04:30.810> had<00:04:31.050> had<00:04:31.650> to<00:04:31.740> draw<00:04:31.980> and<00:04:32.280> I<00:04:32.790> literally<00:04:33.480> just

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
I had had to draw and I literally just

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:35.930 
I had had to draw and I literally just
checked<00:04:34.380> them<00:04:34.500> off<00:04:34.680> as<00:04:34.890> I<00:04:35.040> drew<00:04:35.250> each<00:04:35.430> one<00:04:35.700> just

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
checked them off as I drew each one just

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:37.970 
checked them off as I drew each one just
so<00:04:36.060> I<00:04:36.120> could<00:04:36.300> get<00:04:36.420> everyone<00:04:36.900> that<00:04:37.110> I<00:04:37.140> had<00:04:37.740> meant

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:37.980 
so I could get everyone that I had meant

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:40.640 
so I could get everyone that I had meant
to<00:04:38.070> from<00:04:38.730> the<00:04:38.850> beginning<00:04:38.940> right<00:04:39.440> here<00:04:40.440> you<00:04:40.530> can

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 
to from the beginning right here you can

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:42.710 
to from the beginning right here you can
see<00:04:40.800> I'm<00:04:40.890> just<00:04:40.950> kind<00:04:41.130> of<00:04:41.280> redrawing<00:04:42.090> the<00:04:42.360> angle

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 
see I'm just kind of redrawing the angle

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.160 
see I'm just kind of redrawing the angle
of<00:04:42.840> Superman's<00:04:43.460> head<00:04:44.460> as<00:04:44.760> he<00:04:45.210> is<00:04:45.450> pummeled<00:04:45.960> by

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:46.170 
of Superman's head as he is pummeled by

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:50.600

super doomsday you know I always have to

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.400 
super doomsday you know I always have to
do<00:04:50.700> this<00:04:50.850> because<00:04:51.030> I'm<00:04:51.240> never<00:04:51.510> quite<00:04:51.810> happy

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:52.410

do this because I'm never quite happy
with<00:04:52.620> the<00:04:52.950> the<00:04:53.940> first<00:04:54.090> take

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:56.720 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:59.540 

that's<00:04:57.720> as<00:04:57.870> much<00:04:58.050> as<00:04:58.199> I<00:04:58.290> recorded<00:04:58.710> the<00:04:59.130> actual

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550 
that's as much as I recorded the actual

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:01.610 
that's as much as I recorded the actual
drawing<00:04:59.790> process<00:05:00.150> but<00:05:00.660> here<00:05:00.960> are<00:05:01.050> the<00:05:01.080> stages
