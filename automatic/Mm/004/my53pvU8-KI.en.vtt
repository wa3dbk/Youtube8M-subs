00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
times before so I want to put it in here

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.360 
times before so I want to put it in here
it's<00:00:33.899> not<00:00:34.290> all<00:00:34.440> that<00:00:34.590> interesting<00:00:35.219> and

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
it's not all that interesting and

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.850 
it's not all that interesting and
honestly<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.780> flight<00:00:37.020> is<00:00:37.260> entirely

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
honestly the flight is entirely

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.440 
honestly the flight is entirely
pointless<00:00:38.129> it's<00:00:38.610> a<00:00:38.730> three<00:00:38.940> minute<00:00:38.969> flight

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
pointless it's a three minute flight

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.130 
pointless it's a three minute flight
from<00:00:39.960> dark<00:00:40.770> shore<00:00:41.070> to<00:00:41.309> Darnassus<00:00:42.030> as<00:00:42.719> opposed

from dark shore to Darnassus as opposed

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.380 
from dark shore to Darnassus as opposed
to<00:00:43.379> just<00:00:43.980> going<00:00:44.219> to<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.610> little<00:00:44.850> hub<00:00:45.180> area

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
instant but some of you might want to

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.740 
instant but some of you might want to
