00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
down to different plays and they try to

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:25.790 
down to different plays and they try to
go<00:02:23.610> deep<00:02:23.819> on<00:02:23.970> us<00:02:24.150> and<00:02:24.569> we<00:02:25.020> just<00:02:25.230> adjusted<00:02:25.650> to<00:02:25.770> it

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.110 

Kevin<00:02:31.080> what<00:02:31.230> would<00:02:31.410> you<00:02:31.760> say<00:02:32.760> it<00:02:32.849> was<00:02:32.940> the

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
Kevin what would you say it was the

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.430 
Kevin what would you say it was the
biggest<00:02:33.239> problem<00:02:33.540> effectively<00:02:34.140> in<00:02:34.379> the

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
biggest problem effectively in the

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.380 
biggest problem effectively in the
second<00:02:34.800> half<00:02:34.950> was<00:02:35.190> it<00:02:35.370> being<00:02:36.030> at<00:02:36.180> a<00:02:36.209> sink<00:02:36.569> was<00:02:36.870> a

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
second half was it being at a sink was a

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.200 
second half was it being at a sink was a
execution<00:02:39.390> problems<00:02:39.720> what<00:02:40.260> were<00:02:40.440> the

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:41.210 
execution problems what were the

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:42.340 
execution problems what were the
things<00:02:41.450> are<00:02:41.570> kind<00:02:41.630> of<00:02:41.750> kept<00:02:41.870> you<00:02:41.960> guys<00:02:42.080> in

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
things are kind of kept you guys in

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.860 
things are kind of kept you guys in
check<00:02:42.560> I<00:02:42.890> mean<00:02:43.250> overall<00:02:43.550> I<00:02:43.940> think<00:02:44.150> offensively

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
check I mean overall I think offensively

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.320 
check I mean overall I think offensively
we<00:02:45.110> came<00:02:45.290> out<00:02:45.500> flat<00:02:46.220> I<00:02:46.550> think<00:02:46.880> in<00:02:46.970> the<00:02:47.060> second

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
we came out flat I think in the second

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.800 
we came out flat I think in the second
half<00:02:47.480> and<00:02:47.780> execution<00:02:48.680> we<00:02:48.890> had<00:02:49.010> some<00:02:49.250> a<00:02:49.810> bunch

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.180 

Kevin<00:03:21.450> on<00:03:21.569> offense<00:03:22.380> this<00:03:22.530> year<00:03:22.590> one<00:03:23.040> of<00:03:23.130> the

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
Kevin on offense this year one of the

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:24.350 
Kevin on offense this year one of the
strengths<00:03:23.580> of<00:03:23.640> the<00:03:23.730> team<00:03:23.940> has<00:03:24.090> been<00:03:24.270> the

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
strengths of the team has been the

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.410 
strengths of the team has been the
blocking<00:03:24.750> on<00:03:24.870> the<00:03:25.020> perimeter<00:03:26.090> what<00:03:27.090> seemed<00:03:27.390> to

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
blocking on the perimeter what seemed to

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.020 
blocking on the perimeter what seemed to
be<00:03:27.569> the<00:03:27.660> problem<00:03:27.870> out<00:03:28.140> there<00:03:28.170> today<00:03:28.440> I<00:03:28.850> mean<00:03:29.850> we

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
be the problem out there today I mean we

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.460 
be the problem out there today I mean we
missed<00:03:30.240> a<00:03:30.330> couple<00:03:30.510> of<00:03:30.720> Laughlin<00:03:31.080> perimeter

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
missed a couple of Laughlin perimeter

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:32.660 
missed a couple of Laughlin perimeter
but<00:03:31.650> a<00:03:31.680> bunch<00:03:31.920> of<00:03:32.040> times<00:03:32.100> we<00:03:32.340> didn't<00:03:32.490> get<00:03:32.550> to

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
but a bunch of times we didn't get to

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:33.800 
but a bunch of times we didn't get to
but<00:03:32.819> I<00:03:32.850> didn't<00:03:33.090> get<00:03:33.150> the<00:03:33.270> ball<00:03:33.420> that<00:03:33.540> down<00:03:33.720> the

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
but I didn't get the ball that down the

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.260 
but I didn't get the ball that down the
perimeter<00:03:33.959> like<00:03:34.290> i<00:03:34.410> said<00:03:34.670> in<00:03:35.670> the<00:03:35.730> option<00:03:36.150> guy

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:36.270 
perimeter like i said in the option guy

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:38.350 
perimeter like i said in the option guy
so<00:03:36.510> I<00:03:36.540> mean<00:03:36.840> it's<00:03:37.380> got<00:03:37.500> to<00:03:37.590> do<00:03:37.650> a<00:03:37.680> better<00:03:37.740> job

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:38.360 
so I mean it's got to do a better job

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:44.350 
so I mean it's got to do a better job
