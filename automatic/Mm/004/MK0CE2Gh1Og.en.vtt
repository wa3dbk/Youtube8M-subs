00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:20.670
 if you look at such a product as one 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:24.210
 car design is allowed then you go one 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.140
 very deep emotional attachment to one 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.390
 object 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:32.130
 the key point is that you 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:35.370
 very very much working on it 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.890
 to give cars a soul when they are 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:42.149
 View golf has one of this vehicle 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:45.000
 I have a great team that character 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.510
 work on this vehicle projects 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.590
 may and tries again and again 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:54.480
 personalities in these products 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.510
 to develop into it I believe that the 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:02.640
 people also feel that 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:05.159
 Lotto has a lot with the first golf 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.770
 simple physiognomy create one 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.560
 hit, so to speak, quite simply 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:14.070
 is described face a bar with 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.100
 two headlights at the bottom 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.229
 slightly cut are in the middle 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:21.330
 centered that volkswagen logo has one 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.850
 recognized what a quality they 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.340
 identity has and has over four 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.750
 decades from evolved from evolution 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.850
 you technically have that, of course 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.400
 incredible steps but lives 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.040
 if you look at the first golf and the 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.350
 seventh one immediately recognizes the formal 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.170
 kin the iconic reason 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.200
 Graphics has remained in principle it works 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.570
 but also the expression of 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:48.270
 dynamic that the vehicle was born so 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:51.119
 looks like it is for the movement 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:54.720
 designed alone at the position 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:57.390
 the A-pillar like the windshield 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:00.600
 can almost stand on the vehicle body 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.830
 this dynamization of the form very much 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:06.100
 nice to measure in degrees 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:08.160
 So from standing at the golf 1 to the golf 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.720
 here before lying and at 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.820
 Prosieben extremely sleek and fast 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.400
 can one recognize the automobile design 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:18.700
 has undergone significant stages 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.900
 The back of the choir is also high 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.450
 iconic quality 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:25.180
 the cornerstone already a first 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:28.050
 Generation laid in the direction of wide 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:32.350
 emphasize one can then recognize about the 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:34.990
 years like the position of the c pillar in 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:37.090
 the side wall is also designed 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:39.310
 then there was a dynamic 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.690
 time was there space is very important then 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.290
 but a bit more upright 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.750
 become 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.600
 very much in the newest generation 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.950
 very fast very fast 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:51.400
 flush, especially smooth 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:54.880
 remarkable about the new golf is the 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:57.580
 flat out the front fenders like 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.740
 the face is deep there, it demands that 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:02.140
 New golf is still a dynamic life 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:04.780
 We did not live in the car 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:08.290
 also closer to a formal language 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:10.930
 which has an emotional quality too 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.700
 many, of course, about the future of 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:17.200
 golfs do not betray 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:19.950
 The golf will probably be in the next one 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:24.280
 generation again more dynamic 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:26.080
 develop even sportier on the wheels 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:30.459
 if I promise to 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:31.630
 Quality of the sheet would be called then it must 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:34.920
 be there 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.920
 but we are vw
