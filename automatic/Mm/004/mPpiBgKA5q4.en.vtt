00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:04.520
 gentlemen 

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:14.210
 a lot 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:15.770
 she was free and I am 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:17.240
 production manager within 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:19.520
 AIDS solidarity association 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:22.340
 it consists in gathering the means 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.140
 human financial techniques to make 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.119
 so that an event that we decided 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.730
 could see the light of day 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:30.080
 exist so it's been going since found the place 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:35.200
 of the realization of the events 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:35.200
 recruit teams develop gus g 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.750
 I had attended the antenna festival 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:57.519
 festival in 2000 so it was the 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.320
 second year the second edition of 

00:00:57.519 --> 00:00:59.920
 festival I found it was a very 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.659
 beautiful event 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.720
 the link between both the side 

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:06.580
 international southern country since that's 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.930
 one of the AIDS solidarity creeds of 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.000
 also defend access to the sick 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.960
 affected by hiv in southern countries 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.299
 and music 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.369
 these two aspects seduce me and well 

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:17.820
 and that's why I applied to 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:17.820
 within associations 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.290
 in the timetable during the festival 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.360
 it's very hard to say because we're doing 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.979
 of production during the three days 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.450
 operating for real we are there 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.360
 to solve the problems ie 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.280
 what we did not think about upstream 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.780
 example we realize that there is more 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.030
 of 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.080
 phil dinars of expectations at a place on 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.880
 is there to try to find the 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.900
 solutions for that so that people 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.900
 come back faster for example 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.240
 on this job there often and I 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.780
 think that's still the case 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.120
 today 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.520
 it is necessary to accept to begin 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:01.470
 bottom of the scale in fact we learn what 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.140
 job there on the job make it what we 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.870
 says m in culture I have a sense of 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.130
 relational that stuff and that's 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.080
 the job that also requires a lot 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.490
 investments mean a lot 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.500
 a lot of human investment 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:15.540
 of energy that I like the most in the 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.430
 production manager position is 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.540
 the diversity of contacts at once 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.890
 when we are on the ground of 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.760
 human resources and in particular a 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.820
 AIDS solidarity 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:26.310
 we are connected with volunteers 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:29.250
 also a link with all 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.650
 technical providers see with the 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.150
 media to ease the rude reprieve 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.459
 one of the great riches of these 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.410
 functions there is to be there at the origin 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:40.160
 of the project is to be able to see his 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.810
 culmination on city 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.370
 go until until term 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.410
 project since we usually go up to 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.510
 until dismantling and storage 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.160
 of the last truck what is not 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:52.510
 always very funny even if it's done 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.510
 part of resignation 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.959
