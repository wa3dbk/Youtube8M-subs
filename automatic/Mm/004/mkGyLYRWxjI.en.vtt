okay<00:00:02.100> if<00:00:02.280> you<00:00:02.399> watch<00:00:02.610> my<00:00:02.639> last<00:00:03.149> video<00:00:03.419> then<00:00:04.080> you

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:04.859 
okay if you watch my last video then you

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:06.230 
okay if you watch my last video then you
would<00:00:05.009> have<00:00:05.040> discovered<00:00:05.490> this<00:00:05.759> way<00:00:05.940> of

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
would have discovered this way of

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.059 
would have discovered this way of
finding<00:00:06.600> the<00:00:06.839> 12<00:00:07.140> points<00:00:07.560> that<00:00:07.680> would<00:00:07.830> enable

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
finding the 12 points that would enable

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.820 
finding the 12 points that would enable
you<00:00:08.370> to<00:00:08.429> draw<00:00:08.760> a<00:00:08.940> perfect<00:00:09.179> circle<00:00:09.389> within<00:00:10.349> a

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
you to draw a perfect circle within a

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.280 
you to draw a perfect circle within a
square<00:00:11.400> without<00:00:11.880> using<00:00:12.269> the<00:00:12.870> help<00:00:13.080> of<00:00:13.200> a

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
square without using the help of a

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.049 
square without using the help of a
compass<00:00:13.650> all<00:00:13.860> I<00:00:13.920> need<00:00:14.190> to<00:00:14.219> do<00:00:14.400> is<00:00:14.580> just<00:00:14.610> crossed

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
compass all I need to do is just crossed

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:16.519 
compass all I need to do is just crossed
a<00:00:15.179> bunch<00:00:15.389> of<00:00:15.450> lines<00:00:15.660> and<00:00:15.960> you<00:00:15.990> will<00:00:16.199> be<00:00:16.320> able<00:00:16.379> to

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
a bunch of lines and you will be able to

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.980 
a bunch of lines and you will be able to
find<00:00:16.710> the<00:00:16.830> twelve<00:00:17.070> point<00:00:17.369> but<00:00:18.119> this<00:00:18.359> is<00:00:18.750> really

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
find the twelve point but this is really

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.310 
find the twelve point but this is really
the<00:00:19.230> reason<00:00:19.410> why<00:00:19.740> we<00:00:19.949> do<00:00:20.070> this<00:00:20.270> now<00:00:21.320> imagine

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
the reason why we do this now imagine

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.769 
the reason why we do this now imagine
this<00:00:22.410> if<00:00:22.859> you<00:00:23.039> have<00:00:26.180> pop<00:00:27.180> chicks<00:00:27.480> that<00:00:27.660> you

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
this if you have pop chicks that you

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.500 
this if you have pop chicks that you
have<00:00:27.960> created<00:00:28.140> in<00:00:28.590> perspective<00:00:29.160> now<00:00:29.760> what<00:00:30.359> are

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
have created in perspective now what are

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.209 
have created in perspective now what are
not<00:00:30.689> this<00:00:30.929> is<00:00:31.080> a<00:00:31.109> perfect<00:00:31.560> square<00:00:31.650> knot<00:00:32.009> that's

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
not this is a perfect square knot that's

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.400 
not this is a perfect square knot that's
actually<00:00:32.850> is<00:00:33.000> really<00:00:33.540> relevant<00:00:33.809> but<00:00:34.140> what<00:00:34.320> is

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
actually is really relevant but what is

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.170 
actually is really relevant but what is
relevant<00:00:34.829> is<00:00:34.890> is<00:00:35.040> it<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.340> fact<00:00:35.460> that<00:00:35.579> these

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
relevant is is it the fact that these

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.209 
relevant is is it the fact that these
planes<00:00:36.570> are<00:00:36.719> not<00:00:36.899> really<00:00:37.170> facing<00:00:37.380> us<00:00:37.680> they<00:00:38.190> are

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
planes are not really facing us they are

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.280 
planes are not really facing us they are
sort<00:00:38.820> of<00:00:38.850> turn<00:00:39.090> on<00:00:39.239> an<00:00:39.390> angle<00:00:39.750> so<00:00:39.930> we<00:00:40.079> really

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
sort of turn on an angle so we really

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.549 
sort of turn on an angle so we really
cannot<00:00:40.739> really<00:00:41.340> use<00:00:41.460> a<00:00:41.670> compass<00:00:42.090> within<00:00:42.780> this

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
cannot really use a compass within this

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.610 
cannot really use a compass within this
plane<00:00:44.219> that<00:00:44.460> is<00:00:44.610> in<00:00:44.850> perspective<00:00:45.600> to<00:00:45.960> us<00:00:46.110> so

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
plane that is in perspective to us so

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.610 
plane that is in perspective to us so
but<00:00:46.860> what<00:00:47.039> we<00:00:47.160> could<00:00:47.430> still<00:00:47.670> do<00:00:47.879> is<00:00:48.469> let's<00:00:49.469> say

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
but what we could still do is let's say

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.220 
but what we could still do is let's say
if<00:00:49.950> I<00:00:50.070> wanted<00:00:50.399> to<00:00:50.579> make<00:00:51.149> a<00:00:51.210> cylinder<00:00:51.719> out<00:00:52.020> of

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
if I wanted to make a cylinder out of

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.110 
if I wanted to make a cylinder out of
this<00:00:52.350> object<00:00:52.620> as<00:00:53.160> far<00:00:53.430> this<00:00:53.579> object<00:00:54.000> right

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
this object as far this object right

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.380 
this object as far this object right
here<00:00:54.149> now<00:00:55.020> a<00:00:55.289> cylinder<00:00:55.890> basically<00:00:56.399> is<00:00:56.579> it's

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
here now a cylinder basically is it's

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.529 
here now a cylinder basically is it's
just<00:00:58.280> almost<00:00:59.280> like<00:00:59.460> a<00:00:59.550> box<00:00:59.789> but<00:01:00.120> then<00:01:00.270> with<00:01:00.510> the

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
just almost like a box but then with the

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.650 
just almost like a box but then with the
two<00:01:01.170> ends<00:01:01.379> being<00:01:01.680> elliptical<00:01:02.370> shape<00:01:02.550> so<00:01:03.180> let's

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
two ends being elliptical shape so let's

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:04.910 
two ends being elliptical shape so let's
say<00:01:03.840> if<00:01:04.019> you<00:01:04.049> would<00:01:04.320> have<00:01:04.409> converted<00:01:04.739> this

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
say if you would have converted this

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.250 
say if you would have converted this
into<00:01:04.979> an<00:01:05.580> elliptical<00:01:05.790> shape<00:01:06.240> SOS<00:01:06.900> this<00:01:07.020> right

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
into an elliptical shape SOS this right

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.770 
into an elliptical shape SOS this right
here<00:01:07.439> maybe<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.369> top<00:01:08.580> and<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.420> bottom<00:01:09.450> of

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
here maybe the top and the bottom of

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.460 
here maybe the top and the bottom of
this<00:01:09.900> one<00:01:11.090> this<00:01:12.090> is<00:01:12.150> how<00:01:12.390> we<00:01:12.450> can<00:01:12.570> do<00:01:12.689> that<00:01:12.810> by

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
this one this is how we can do that by

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.200 
this one this is how we can do that by
crossing<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:14.100> die<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.549> I<00:01:14.580> was<00:01:14.700> finding<00:01:14.970> the

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
crossing the die and I was finding the

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.410 
crossing the die and I was finding the
first<00:01:15.450> that<00:01:15.720> 18<00:01:16.290> I'm<00:01:16.650> sorry<00:01:16.830> 216<00:01:17.310> small<00:01:18.000> units

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
first that 18 I'm sorry 216 small units

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.679 
first that 18 I'm sorry 216 small units
as<00:01:18.930> far<00:01:19.170> as<00:01:19.259> here<00:01:19.590> here<00:01:20.400> and<00:01:20.610> here<00:01:20.700> and<00:01:21.119> from

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
as far as here here and here and from

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:27.460 
as far as here here and here and from
there<00:01:23.119> by<00:01:24.119> crossing<00:01:24.390> those<00:01:24.720> eight<00:01:25.049> lines<00:01:26.240> and

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
there by crossing those eight lines and

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.130 
there by crossing those eight lines and
finding<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.590> 12<00:01:28.860> point<00:01:29.189> here<00:01:30.000> here<00:01:30.630> here<00:01:31.110> and

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
finding the 12 point here here here and

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.219 
finding the 12 point here here here and
here<00:01:31.409> so<00:01:32.159> now<00:01:32.369> if<00:01:32.729> I<00:01:32.970> wish<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.390> I<00:01:33.420> can<00:01:33.869> follow

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
here so now if I wish to I can follow

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.609 
here so now if I wish to I can follow
these<00:01:34.560> 12<00:01:34.890> points<00:01:35.280> by<00:01:35.880> easily<00:01:36.360> to<00:01:36.570> form<00:01:36.930> in<00:01:37.470> a

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
these 12 points by easily to form in a

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.440 
these 12 points by easily to form in a
little<00:01:37.890> bit<00:01:38.040> and<00:01:38.340> elliptical<00:01:39.000> shape<00:01:39.180> that<00:01:39.329> is

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
little bit and elliptical shape that is

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.630 
little bit and elliptical shape that is
actually<00:01:39.930> working<00:01:40.770> in<00:01:41.070> conjunction<00:01:41.280> with

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
actually working in conjunction with

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.310 
actually working in conjunction with
round<00:01:42.060> with<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.329> perspective<00:01:42.899> that<00:01:42.930> it

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
round with the perspective that it

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.050 
round with the perspective that it
actually<00:01:43.500> is<00:01:43.860> in<00:01:44.009> because<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.520> box<00:01:44.729> itself

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
actually is in because the box itself

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.990 
actually is in because the box itself
the<00:01:45.329> box<00:01:45.570> is<00:01:45.750> in<00:01:45.899> proper<00:01:46.619> perspective<00:01:46.860> so<00:01:47.790> what

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
the box is in proper perspective so what

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.359 
the box is in proper perspective so what
you<00:01:48.149> develop<00:01:48.600> out<00:01:48.720> of<00:01:48.750> that<00:01:49.020> in<00:01:49.590> regards<00:01:49.799> to<00:01:50.220> or

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
you develop out of that in regards to or

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:51.740 
you develop out of that in regards to or
to<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.549> 12<00:01:50.850> points<00:01:51.210> that<00:01:51.299> you<00:01:51.329> are<00:01:51.450> used<00:01:51.630> to

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
to the 12 points that you are used to

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.110 
to the 12 points that you are used to
discover<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.350> shirt

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:53.120 
discover the shirt

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.690 
discover the shirt
the<00:01:53.350> elliptical<00:01:54.350> shape<00:01:54.530> with<00:01:54.710> they<00:01:55.490> are

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
the elliptical shape with they are

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.790 
the elliptical shape with they are
actually<00:01:56.210> in<00:01:56.360> perspective<00:01:56.870> as<00:01:56.960> well<00:01:57.140> too<00:01:57.320> so

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:57.800 
actually in perspective as well too so

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.790 
actually in perspective as well too so
so<00:01:58.520> now<00:01:59.000> i<00:01:59.030> have<00:01:59.180> an<00:01:59.420> elliptical<00:01:59.840> shape<00:01:59.990> as<00:02:00.470> far

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:00.800 
so now i have an elliptical shape as far

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.150 
so now i have an elliptical shape as far
as<00:02:00.890> here<00:02:01.360> here<00:02:02.360> and<00:02:02.570> here<00:02:02.990> so<00:02:03.680> all<00:02:03.860> i<00:02:03.950> need<00:02:04.010> to

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:04.160 
as here here and here so all i need to

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.010 
as here here and here so all i need to
do<00:02:04.340> is<00:02:04.550> just<00:02:04.580> to<00:02:05.000> draw<00:02:05.240> around<00:02:05.360> those<00:02:05.690> 12

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
do is just to draw around those 12

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.290 
do is just to draw around those 12
points<00:02:06.470> here<00:02:06.920> here<00:02:07.310> here<00:02:07.670> and<00:02:07.700> here<00:02:08.000> and

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
points here here here and here and

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.020 
points here here here and here and
connect<00:02:09.140> them<00:02:09.260> at<00:02:09.440> the<00:02:09.530> reason<00:02:09.830> why<00:02:10.070> we<00:02:10.729> have

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
connect them at the reason why we have

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.210 
connect them at the reason why we have
learned<00:02:11.330> how<00:02:11.540> to<00:02:11.600> use<00:02:11.870> this<00:02:12.650> method<00:02:12.920> of

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
learned how to use this method of

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.400 
learned how to use this method of
creating<00:02:13.460> finding<00:02:14.120> the<00:02:14.210> twelve<00:02:14.450> point<00:02:14.720> basis

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
creating finding the twelve point basis

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.490 
creating finding the twelve point basis
so<00:02:15.890> that<00:02:15.920> we<00:02:16.190> can<00:02:16.370> turn<00:02:17.090> rectangular<00:02:17.930> object

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
so that we can turn rectangular object

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
so that we can turn rectangular object
three-dimensional<00:02:19.250> objects<00:02:19.640> into<00:02:19.910> cylinders
