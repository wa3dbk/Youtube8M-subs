now<00:00:01.560> we're<00:00:01.709> gonna<00:00:01.800> go<00:00:02.010> through<00:00:02.280> the<00:00:02.399> steps

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:02.639 
now we're gonna go through the steps

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.970 
now we're gonna go through the steps
involved<00:00:03.179> printing<00:00:03.870> our<00:00:04.350> block<00:00:06.710> making<00:00:07.710> sure

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
involved printing our block making sure

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.270 
involved printing our block making sure
that<00:00:08.189> we<00:00:08.309> move<00:00:08.490> away<00:00:08.670> from<00:00:08.849> the<00:00:09.150> slab<00:00:10.070> we<00:00:11.070> don't

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
that we move away from the slab we don't

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.759 
that we move away from the slab we don't
want<00:00:11.460> any<00:00:11.639> extra<00:00:11.910> ink<00:00:12.120> on<00:00:12.300> our<00:00:12.330> paper<00:00:12.650> what<00:00:13.650> we

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
want any extra ink on our paper what we

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.340 
want any extra ink on our paper what we
need<00:00:13.920> to<00:00:14.040> do<00:00:14.219> is<00:00:14.490> line<00:00:14.940> our<00:00:15.179> paper<00:00:15.389> up<00:00:15.660> to<00:00:15.870> to

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
need to do is line our paper up to to

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.529 
need to do is line our paper up to to
the<00:00:16.470> block<00:00:17.029> and<00:00:18.029> this<00:00:18.270> is<00:00:18.390> relatively<00:00:19.140> easy

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:20.539 
the block and this is relatively easy

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:23.900 
the block and this is relatively easy
placing<00:00:21.539> one<00:00:21.689> edge<00:00:21.900> we<00:00:22.859> can<00:00:22.890> we<00:00:23.400> can<00:00:23.550> say<00:00:23.699> that

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
placing one edge we can we can say that

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.550 
placing one edge we can we can say that
this<00:00:24.029> is<00:00:24.090> about<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.480> halfway<00:00:24.779> point<00:00:24.990> here

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
this is about the halfway point here

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.519 
this is about the halfway point here
again<00:00:26.010> the<00:00:26.640> smooth<00:00:26.970> side<00:00:27.570> is<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.289> side<00:00:28.500> that

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
again the smooth side is the side that

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.690 
again the smooth side is the side that
we<00:00:28.740> want<00:00:29.010> to<00:00:29.070> print<00:00:29.340> on<00:00:31.070> so<00:00:32.070> there's<00:00:32.279> a<00:00:32.340> halfway

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
we want to print on so there's a halfway

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.240 
we want to print on so there's a halfway
point<00:00:32.730> and<00:00:33.210> here's<00:00:34.170> a<00:00:34.230> halfway<00:00:34.680> point<00:00:35.010> and

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
point and here's a halfway point and

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.160 
point and here's a halfway point and
I've<00:00:35.399> made<00:00:35.790> these<00:00:36.059> references<00:00:36.780> and<00:00:39.170> just

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
I've made these references and just

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.569 
I've made these references and just
gently<00:00:40.440> set<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:40.980> paper<00:00:41.190> down<00:00:43.190> once<00:00:44.190> I've<00:00:44.399> set

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
gently set the paper down once I've set

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.350 
gently set the paper down once I've set
the<00:00:44.700> paper<00:00:44.879> down<00:00:45.180> on<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.629> block<00:00:46.079> I<00:00:47.059> never<00:00:48.059> want

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
the paper down on the block I never want

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.319 
the paper down on the block I never want
to<00:00:48.420> let<00:00:48.539> go<00:00:48.860> so<00:00:49.860> I<00:00:49.890> always<00:00:50.280> want<00:00:50.579> to<00:00:50.670> have<00:00:50.820> one

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
to let go so I always want to have one

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.560 
to let go so I always want to have one
hand<00:00:51.600> on<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.350> surface<00:00:52.829> at<00:00:53.070> all<00:00:53.129> times<00:00:53.640> because

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
hand on the surface at all times because

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.549 
hand on the surface at all times because
we<00:00:54.780> don't<00:00:55.050> want<00:00:55.320> this<00:00:55.559> to<00:00:55.620> move<00:00:56.899> then<00:00:57.899> taking<00:00:58.350> a

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
we don't want this to move then taking a

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:04.219 
we don't want this to move then taking a
wooden<00:00:59.219> spoon<00:01:01.399> working<00:01:02.510> much<00:01:03.510> like<00:01:03.840> we<00:01:04.019> did

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
wooden spoon working much like we did

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.660 
wooden spoon working much like we did
with<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.530> brayer<00:01:04.799> across<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.489> surface

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
with the brayer across the surface

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.640 
with the brayer across the surface
starting<00:01:06.330> in<00:01:06.450> one<00:01:06.630> corner<00:01:06.900> working<00:01:07.470> our<00:01:07.619> way

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
starting in one corner working our way

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.250 
starting in one corner working our way
around<00:01:08.159> and<00:01:08.549> rubbing<00:01:09.360> over<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.659> surface<00:01:10.080> of

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
around and rubbing over the surface of

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:18.550 
around and rubbing over the surface of
the<00:01:10.350> paper<00:01:11.990> applying<00:01:13.310> equal<00:01:14.310> pressure<00:01:14.610> and

surface of the paper but enough that you
can<00:01:24.689> actually<00:01:24.840> see<00:01:25.520> the<00:01:26.520> ink<00:01:26.729> coming<00:01:27.119> off<00:01:27.270> the

can actually see the ink coming off the

can actually see the ink coming off the
block<00:01:27.720> through<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.890> paper<00:01:29.100> itself<00:01:30.710> and<00:01:31.710> again

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
block through the paper itself and again

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.460 
block through the paper itself and again
I'm<00:01:32.520> working<00:01:32.729> left<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.329> right<00:01:35.810> making<00:01:36.810> sure<00:01:37.079> I

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
I'm working left to right making sure I

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.539 
I'm working left to right making sure I
go<00:01:38.100> over<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.610> entire<00:01:38.759> surface<00:01:39.390> and<00:01:40.549> never

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
go over the entire surface and never

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:47.780 
go over the entire surface and never
letting<00:01:41.970> go<00:01:45.680> applying<00:01:46.680> equal<00:01:46.920> pressure<00:01:47.369> the

letting go applying equal pressure the

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.640 
letting go applying equal pressure the
best<00:01:48.000> I<00:01:48.180> can

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:52.650 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:58.010 

you<00:01:53.650> may<00:01:53.860> also<00:01:54.190> want<00:01:54.610> to<00:01:54.790> go<00:01:54.940> to<00:01:55.000> the<00:01:55.240> edges<00:01:55.659> and

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
you may also want to go to the edges and

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:05.340 
you may also want to go to the edges and
define<00:01:59.020> those<00:01:59.290> edges<00:02:01.260> so<00:02:02.260> you<00:02:02.350> can<00:02:02.590> see<00:02:04.350> the

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
define those edges so you can see the

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.680 
define those edges so you can see the
entire<00:02:05.650> wood<00:02:06.250> block<00:02:06.550> and<00:02:07.500> then<00:02:08.500> continue

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
entire wood block and then continue

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:22.110 
entire wood block and then continue
across<00:02:10.690> the<00:02:10.990> surface<00:02:20.400> if<00:02:21.400> your<00:02:21.670> arm<00:02:21.850> is

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
across the surface if your arm is

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:35.300 
across the surface if your arm is
getting<00:02:22.300> tired<00:02:23.100> you're<00:02:24.100> doing<00:02:24.400> this<00:02:24.550> right

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.250 

I'm<00:02:36.310> almost<00:02:36.600> through<00:02:37.600> with<00:02:37.690> the<00:02:38.020> whole

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
I'm almost through with the whole

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.960 
I'm almost through with the whole
surface<00:02:38.950> I<00:02:39.450> essentially<00:02:40.450> never<00:02:40.660> let<00:02:40.960> go<00:02:41.970> and

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
surface I essentially never let go and

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.210 
surface I essentially never let go and
I've<00:02:43.150> always<00:02:43.750> kept<00:02:44.050> the<00:02:44.230> spoon<00:02:44.500> moving<00:02:44.980> across

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
I've always kept the spoon moving across

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.420 
I've always kept the spoon moving across
the<00:02:45.340> surface<00:02:45.790> of<00:02:46.090> the<00:02:46.180> paper<00:02:46.390> I<00:02:47.040> can<00:02:48.040> actually

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
the surface of the paper I can actually

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:56.790 
the surface of the paper I can actually
see<00:02:48.730> my<00:02:49.240> image<00:02:50.400> as<00:02:51.400> well<00:02:54.570> so<00:02:55.570> once<00:02:56.230> I<00:02:56.410> have<00:02:56.620> the

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
see my image as well so once I have the

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.120 
see my image as well so once I have the
whole<00:02:56.980> thing<00:02:57.010> printed<00:02:58.380> what<00:02:59.380> I<00:02:59.470> like<00:02:59.620> to<00:02:59.740> do<00:02:59.890> is

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
whole thing printed what I like to do is

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:05.970 
whole thing printed what I like to do is
go<00:03:00.310> ahead<00:03:00.430> and<00:03:01.590> rotate<00:03:02.590> it<00:03:02.800> and<00:03:03.600> then<00:03:04.980> double

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
go ahead and rotate it and then double

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.090 
go ahead and rotate it and then double
back<00:03:06.780> by<00:03:07.780> going<00:03:08.110> all<00:03:08.350> the<00:03:08.470> way<00:03:08.500> over<00:03:08.590> the<00:03:08.920> whole

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
back by going all the way over the whole

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.700 
back by going all the way over the whole
surface<00:03:09.580> a<00:03:09.940> little<00:03:10.750> bit<00:03:10.840> faster<00:03:11.290> than<00:03:11.470> I<00:03:11.560> did

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:11.710 
surface a little bit faster than I did

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:17.370

so now we're ready to remove the paper
very<00:03:39.069> carefully<00:03:40.769> lifting<00:03:41.769> the<00:03:41.890> paper

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
drag it across the surface we then lift

00:03:53.200 --> 00:04:04.890 
drag it across the surface we then lift
it<00:03:53.349> off<00:03:53.500> and<00:03:59.099> here<00:04:00.099> we<00:04:00.220> have<00:04:00.370> our<00:04:00.549> proof<00:04:03.870> we<00:04:04.870> can

see the surface of the woods we can see

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:09.420 
see the surface of the woods we can see
those<00:04:07.389> curvy<00:04:07.810> linear<00:04:08.109> lines<00:04:08.440> we<00:04:08.829> can<00:04:08.980> also<00:04:09.129> see

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
those curvy linear lines we can also see
