00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
that the hair is very loose until it

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.000 
that the hair is very loose until it
gets<00:00:35.790> to<00:00:36.059> a<00:00:36.090> certain<00:00:36.360> point<00:00:36.899> in<00:00:37.469> which<00:00:37.649> the

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
gets to a certain point in which the

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.410 
gets to a certain point in which the
dreadlock<00:00:38.690> has<00:00:39.690> formed<00:00:40.230> so<00:00:40.469> and<00:00:41.210> people<00:00:42.210> ask

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
dreadlock has formed so and people ask

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.889 
dreadlock has formed so and people ask
do<00:00:42.989> I<00:00:43.050> twist<00:00:43.530> them<00:00:43.800> no<00:00:44.670> I<00:00:44.940> don't<00:00:45.270> twist<00:00:45.600> them

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
do I twist them no I don't twist them

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.110 
do I twist them no I don't twist them
and<00:00:46.110> in<00:00:46.379> fact<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.920> only<00:00:47.250> thing<00:00:47.489> I<00:00:47.640> do<00:00:47.700> is

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
and in fact the only thing I do is

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.920 
and in fact the only thing I do is
separate<00:00:48.899> them<00:00:49.170> which<00:00:49.980> I<00:00:50.309> can<00:00:50.670> probably<00:00:51.510> find

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
separate them which I can probably find

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.760 
separate them which I can probably find
one<00:00:52.140> to<00:00:52.440> demonstrate<00:00:53.160> to<00:00:53.399> you<00:00:53.430> now<00:00:54.410> there<00:00:55.410> we

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
one to demonstrate to you now there we

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:56.180 
one to demonstrate to you now there we
go

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
go

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.819 
go
so<00:00:56.510> sometimes<00:00:57.510> you<00:00:57.690> just<00:00:57.930> simply<00:00:58.379> pull<00:00:58.680> them

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
so sometimes you just simply pull them

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.939 
so sometimes you just simply pull them
apart<00:00:59.010> so<00:00:59.989> it<00:01:00.989> started<00:01:01.980> with<00:01:02.370> an<00:01:02.670> afro<00:01:03.300> an<00:01:04.110> afro

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
apart so it started with an afro an afro

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.080 
apart so it started with an afro an afro
that<00:01:05.729> I<00:01:05.760> let<00:01:06.150> grow<00:01:06.479> out<00:01:06.689> to<00:01:07.140> be<00:01:07.350> as<00:01:08.310> big<00:01:08.820> as<00:01:08.939> it

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
that I let grow out to be as big as it

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.230 
that I let grow out to be as big as it
wanted<00:01:09.450> to<00:01:09.600> be<00:01:10.040> like<00:01:11.040> Macy<00:01:11.340> Gray's<00:01:11.790> hair

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
wanted to be like Macy Gray's hair

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.560 
wanted to be like Macy Gray's hair
remember<00:01:12.900> her<00:01:13.080> so<00:01:13.799> it<00:01:14.189> started<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:14.700> separate

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
remember her so it started to separate

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.350 
remember her so it started to separate
off<00:01:15.840> and<00:01:16.170> all<00:01:16.439> I<00:01:16.470> simply<00:01:17.220> did<00:01:17.460> was<00:01:17.700> kind<00:01:18.210> of

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
off and all I simply did was kind of

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.590 
off and all I simply did was kind of
separated<00:01:19.290> so<00:01:19.979> they<00:01:20.150> dreadlock<00:01:21.150> where<00:01:21.420> it

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
separated so they dreadlock where it

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.420 
separated so they dreadlock where it
needed<00:01:21.869> to<00:01:22.049> be<00:01:22.200> that<00:01:22.770> was<00:01:22.950> it<00:01:23.130> and<00:01:23.840> so<00:01:25.250> I<00:01:26.250> have

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
needed to be that was it and so I have

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.030 
needed to be that was it and so I have
all<00:01:26.939> different<00:01:27.210> sizes<00:01:27.600> you<00:01:28.259> can<00:01:28.290> see<00:01:28.680> I've<00:01:28.829> got

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
around the same time so like I say the

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.690 
around the same time so like I say the
afro<00:01:57.780> grew<00:01:58.049> out<00:01:58.369> its<00:01:59.369> separated<00:02:00.210> off<00:02:00.390> I

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
afro grew out its separated off I

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:07.280 
afro grew out its separated off I
separated<00:02:02.700> it<00:02:02.969> I<00:02:03.149> never<00:02:03.530> ever<00:02:04.530> ever<00:02:06.290> twisted

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
separated it I never ever ever twisted

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.669 
separated it I never ever ever twisted
it<00:02:07.439> that's<00:02:08.399> why<00:02:08.759> they<00:02:09.090> don't<00:02:09.390> look<00:02:09.780> twisted

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
it that's why they don't look twisted

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:11.350 
it that's why they don't look twisted
it's<00:02:10.860> an

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
it's an

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.760 
it's an
that<00:02:11.960> doesn't<00:02:12.580> go<00:02:13.580> away<00:02:13.730> basically<00:02:14.710> so<00:02:15.710> you

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
that doesn't go away basically so you

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.790 
that doesn't go away basically so you
can<00:02:16.100> see<00:02:16.400> the<00:02:16.670> roots<00:02:17.000> aren't<00:02:17.540> twisted<00:02:17.990> up<00:02:18.470> so

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
can see the roots aren't twisted up so

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.780 
can see the roots aren't twisted up so
it<00:02:19.250> takes<00:02:19.640> no<00:02:20.330> maintenance<00:02:21.320> to<00:02:22.250> keep<00:02:22.280> this

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
it takes no maintenance to keep this

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.160 
it takes no maintenance to keep this
going<00:02:23.150> all<00:02:23.510> I<00:02:24.170> do<00:02:24.440> is<00:02:24.830> shampoo<00:02:25.160> and<00:02:26.170> separate

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
going all I do is shampoo and separate

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.190 
going all I do is shampoo and separate
after<00:02:28.100> I<00:02:28.430> shampoo<00:02:28.730> because<00:02:29.150> shampooing<00:02:29.390> does

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
after I shampoo because shampooing does

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.540 
after I shampoo because shampooing does
seem<00:02:30.470> to<00:02:30.680> make<00:02:30.860> it<00:02:31.100> all<00:02:31.250> nod<00:02:31.670> up<00:02:31.910> so<00:02:33.190> that<00:02:34.190> is

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
seem to make it all nod up so that is

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.450 
seem to make it all nod up so that is

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:37.460 
that's it people can't believe there

spending time it is simply not in the
hair<00:03:41.600> that<00:03:42.260> you<00:03:42.440> don't<00:03:42.739> come<00:03:43.250> out<00:03:43.670> and<00:03:44.570> when<00:03:45.260> I

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
hair that you don't come out and when I

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.850 
hair that you don't come out and when I
sleep<00:03:45.739> I<00:03:46.040> do<00:03:46.310> pull<00:03:46.880> it<00:03:47.000> like<00:03:47.630> this<00:03:48.020> and<00:03:48.470> then

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:48.860 
sleep I do pull it like this and then

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.800 
sleep I do pull it like this and then
lay<00:03:49.100> down<00:03:49.130> because<00:03:49.930> it<00:03:50.930> hurts<00:03:51.380> to<00:03:51.770> lay<00:03:51.950> on<00:03:52.190> them

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
lay down because it hurts to lay on them

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:57.010 
lay down because it hurts to lay on them
because<00:03:53.810> I<00:03:54.110> really<00:03:54.440> don't<00:03:54.620> pay<00:03:54.860> so<00:03:55.520> if<00:03:55.970> you<00:03:56.840> lay

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:57.020 
because I really don't pay so if you lay

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:59.350 
because I really don't pay so if you lay
on<00:03:57.050> them<00:03:57.380> for<00:03:57.650> several<00:03:58.130> hours<00:03:58.280> you<00:03:58.730> will<00:03:58.940> feel

00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360 
on them for several hours you will feel

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:04.690 
on them for several hours you will feel
it<00:03:59.540> so<00:04:00.410> I<00:04:00.770> am<00:04:01.160> I<00:04:02.440> recommend<00:04:03.440> that<00:04:04.100> you<00:04:04.160> don't

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:04.700 
it so I am I recommend that you don't

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.570 
it so I am I recommend that you don't
separate<00:04:05.510> to<00:04:05.810> the<00:04:05.930> point<00:04:06.260> where<00:04:06.470> you<00:04:07.340> don't

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:07.580 
separate to the point where you don't

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:09.640 
separate to the point where you don't
have<00:04:07.850> a<00:04:07.910> really<00:04:08.540> thick<00:04:08.900> base<00:04:09.200> you<00:04:09.440> can<00:04:09.620> see

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650 
have a really thick base you can see

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.520 
have a really thick base you can see
this<00:04:10.070> is<00:04:10.250> probably<00:04:10.540> about<00:04:11.540> the<00:04:11.720> size<00:04:12.170> of<00:04:12.380> my

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:12.530 
this is probably about the size of my

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:16.509 
this is probably about the size of my
err<00:04:12.769> circumference<00:04:13.730> of<00:04:13.910> a<00:04:14.060> quarter<00:04:14.480> so<00:04:15.519> just

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:16.519 
err circumference of a quarter so just

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:21.199 
err circumference of a quarter so just
make<00:04:17.090> sure<00:04:17.120> that<00:04:17.419> your<00:04:18.130> roots<00:04:19.130> are<00:04:19.549> quite

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
make sure that your roots are quite

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:24.760 
make sure that your roots are quite
big<00:04:21.590> so<00:04:22.590> that<00:04:22.830> when<00:04:23.039> your<00:04:23.280> hair<00:04:23.550> gets<00:04:23.820> long

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 
big so that when your hair gets long

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:27.950 
big so that when your hair gets long
after<00:04:25.770> 11<00:04:26.250> years<00:04:26.280> it<00:04:26.820> won't<00:04:27.030> break<00:04:27.690> off

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
after 11 years it won't break off

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.590 
after 11 years it won't break off
because<00:04:28.500> it's<00:04:28.889> thin<00:04:29.280> at<00:04:29.580> the<00:04:29.729> root<00:04:29.940> I've<00:04:30.270> had

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 
because it's thin at the root I've had

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.129 
because it's thin at the root I've had
that<00:04:30.780> happen<00:04:31.020> to<00:04:31.259> a<00:04:31.470> few<00:04:31.800> of<00:04:31.919> them<00:04:32.070> and<00:04:33.139> you
