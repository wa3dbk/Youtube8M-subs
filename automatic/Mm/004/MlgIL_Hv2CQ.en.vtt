00:01:18.779 --> 00:01:18.789 
essentially if we could sort of see the

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:21.930 
essentially if we could sort of see the
mark<00:01:19.119> in<00:01:19.240> there<00:01:19.420> on<00:01:19.539> the<00:01:19.630> blade<00:01:20.610> it<00:01:21.610> is

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
mentioned about the ergonomics the

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.479 
mentioned about the ergonomics the
handle<00:03:34.760> it's<00:03:35.480> exactly<00:03:36.049> the<00:03:36.230> same<00:03:36.500> as<00:03:36.769> a<00:03:37.250> non

flipper X m18 same feels same everything

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.569 
flipper X m18 same feels same everything
I'll<00:03:42.290> say<00:03:42.650> that<00:03:42.859> the<00:03:42.919> fixed<00:03:43.159> blade<00:03:43.250> is<00:03:43.549> a

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:43.579 
I'll say that the fixed blade is a

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:45.819 
I'll say that the fixed blade is a
little<00:03:43.729> bit<00:03:44.150> thinner<00:03:44.479> overall<00:03:45.169> you<00:03:45.530> know<00:03:45.650> in

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:45.829 
little bit thinner overall you know in

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:47.979 
little bit thinner overall you know in
grip<00:03:46.099> and<00:03:46.280> performance<00:03:46.790> if<00:03:47.090> you<00:03:47.269> take<00:03:47.659> off<00:03:47.840> the

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:47.989 
grip and performance if you take off the

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:51.009 
grip and performance if you take off the
clip<00:03:48.260> as<00:03:48.440> I<00:03:48.680> did<00:03:48.859> on<00:03:49.069> this<00:03:49.370> guy<00:03:49.579> I<00:03:50.359> think<00:03:50.900> it's

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:51.019 
clip as I did on this guy I think it's

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:53.080 
clip as I did on this guy I think it's
just<00:03:51.199> a<00:03:51.379> great<00:03:51.829> feeling<00:03:52.069> it<00:03:52.699> is<00:03:52.849> so

same<00:04:05.180> as<00:04:05.359> on<00:04:05.509> the<00:04:05.659> flash<00:04:05.900> points<00:04:06.349> the<00:04:06.500> flush

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:06.709 
same as on the flash points the flush

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:08.439 
same as on the flash points the flush
point<00:04:06.979> is<00:04:07.129> also<00:04:07.310> a<00:04:07.430> fixed<00:04:07.699> blade<00:04:07.970> Hinderer

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:08.449 
point is also a fixed blade Hinderer

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:10.149 
point is also a fixed blade Hinderer
maybe<00:04:08.750> you<00:04:08.870> guys<00:04:08.989> have<00:04:09.169> seen<00:04:09.349> those<00:04:09.560> it's<00:04:10.040> a

00:04:10.149 --> 00:04:10.159 
maybe you guys have seen those it's a

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:11.409 
maybe you guys have seen those it's a
little<00:04:10.400> bit<00:04:10.489> smaller<00:04:10.849> about<00:04:11.060> two<00:04:11.239> and

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:11.419 
little bit smaller about two and

00:04:11.419 --> 00:04:13.539 
little bit smaller about two and
three-quarter<00:04:11.900> inches<00:04:12.229> versus<00:04:12.799> this<00:04:13.220> guy<00:04:13.400> at

00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:13.549 
three-quarter inches versus this guy at

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:17.199 
three-quarter inches versus this guy at
3.5<00:04:14.209> inches<00:04:14.709> so<00:04:15.709> you<00:04:16.310> know<00:04:16.400> it<00:04:16.669> is<00:04:16.820> going<00:04:17.000> to<00:04:17.090> be

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:17.209 
3.5 inches so you know it is going to be

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:18.729 
3.5 inches so you know it is going to be
a<00:04:17.239> little<00:04:17.539> bit<00:04:17.690> smaller<00:04:18.019> of<00:04:18.169> a<00:04:18.349> fixed<00:04:18.590> blade

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:18.739 
a little bit smaller of a fixed blade

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:21.729 
a little bit smaller of a fixed blade

very cool overall you notice the screws
or<00:04:55.500> the<00:04:55.740> pivots<00:04:56.190> that<00:04:56.370> he<00:04:56.460> uses<00:04:56.640> to<00:04:57.020> bind<00:04:58.020> it

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:58.260 
or the pivots that he uses to bind it

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.530 
or the pivots that he uses to bind it
are<00:04:58.440> the<00:04:58.860> same<00:04:59.130> ones<00:04:59.400> that<00:04:59.610> he<00:05:00.000> uses<00:05:00.360> is<00:05:00.510> the

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:04.410 
pivot screw over on the regular XM 18 so

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:06.410 
pivot screw over on the regular XM 18 so
that<00:05:04.890> is<00:05:05.130> very<00:05:05.490> cool<00:05:05.820> but<00:05:06.030> three<00:05:06.270> of<00:05:06.330> those

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:06.420

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520 
guys there you will need the Hinderer

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.150 
guys there you will need the Hinderer
tool<00:05:08.760> if<00:05:09.000> you<00:05:09.240> should<00:05:09.630> ever<00:05:10.140> need<00:05:10.350> to<00:05:10.860> take<00:05:10.980> off

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:11.160 
tool if you should ever need to take off

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.650 
tool if you should ever need to take off
the<00:05:11.310> scales<00:05:11.550> maybe<00:05:11.940> to<00:05:12.090> replace<00:05:12.420> them<00:05:12.570> a

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:12.660 
the scales maybe to replace them a

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:15.140 
the scales maybe to replace them a
different<00:05:12.810> color<00:05:13.230> but<00:05:13.800> aside<00:05:14.460> from<00:05:14.520> that<00:05:14.670> you

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:15.150 
different color but aside from that you

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:16.550 
different color but aside from that you
really<00:05:15.510> won't<00:05:15.660> have<00:05:15.810> to<00:05:15.960> do<00:05:16.080> any<00:05:16.260> type<00:05:16.530> of

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.560 
really won't have to do any type of

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.530 
really won't have to do any type of
tweaking<00:05:16.890> that<00:05:17.370> being<00:05:17.610> a<00:05:17.730> fixed<00:05:18.000> blade<00:05:18.150> okay

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:18.540 
tweaking that being a fixed blade okay

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:21.020 
tweaking that being a fixed blade okay
so<00:05:19.260> anyway<00:05:19.920> you<00:05:20.220> know<00:05:20.310> kind<00:05:20.640> of<00:05:20.700> a<00:05:20.760> short
