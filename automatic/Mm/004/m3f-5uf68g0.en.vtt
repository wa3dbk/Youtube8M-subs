few guys here and i'm off to go pick up
my<00:02:39.580> teammates<00:02:41.670> there's<00:02:42.670> two<00:02:43.000> guys<00:02:43.239> over<00:02:43.630> here

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
my teammates there's two guys over here

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.770 
my teammates there's two guys over here
so<00:02:44.260> first<00:02:44.680> one<00:02:45.060> guess<00:02:46.060> is<00:02:46.239> that's<00:02:46.360> trying<00:02:46.720> to

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
so first one guess is that's trying to

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.289 
so first one guess is that's trying to
hit<00:02:47.049> second<00:02:47.650> one<00:02:47.799> gets<00:02:48.100> his<00:02:48.250> up<00:02:48.370> to<00:02:48.549> 21<00:02:49.060> tickets

00:02:49.289 --> 00:02:49.299 
hit second one gets his up to 21 tickets
