00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.490 
perfectly with this then of course we're
using<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.430> driver<00:01:41.700> so<00:01:41.939> we<00:01:42.030> have<00:01:42.150> a<00:01:42.180> lean

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
using the driver so we have a lean

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.929 
using the driver so we have a lean
functionality<00:01:43.500> in<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:44.040> game<00:01:44.220> that<00:01:44.490> were<00:01:44.640> used

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
functionality in the game that were used

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.060 
functionality in the game that were used
to<00:01:45.000> gyros<00:01:45.390> and<00:01:45.570> lean<00:01:45.689> which<00:01:46.560> is<00:01:46.680> really<00:01:46.979> really

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
to gyros and lean which is really really

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.520 
to gyros and lean which is really really
cool<00:01:47.310> and<00:01:47.820> then<00:01:48.630> in<00:01:48.780> general<00:01:49.140> we're<00:01:49.259> trying<00:01:49.439> to

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
cool and then in general we're trying to

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.130 
cool and then in general we're trying to
use<00:01:49.680> everything<00:01:50.070> we<00:01:50.340> we<00:01:50.939> have<00:01:51.240> from<00:01:52.049> a

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
use everything we we have from a

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.109 
use everything we we have from a
hardware<00:01:52.380> perspective<00:01:52.590> kind<00:01:53.520> of<00:01:53.640> vehicles

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
hardware perspective kind of vehicles

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.179 
hardware perspective kind of vehicles
can<00:01:54.390> we<00:01:54.509> expect<00:01:54.780> to<00:01:54.960> see<00:01:55.140> get<00:01:55.680> a<00:01:55.710> run<00:01:55.920> out<00:01:56.070> in

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
can we expect to see get a run out in

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.399 
can we expect to see get a run out in
