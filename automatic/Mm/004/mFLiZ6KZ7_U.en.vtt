Internet Explorer we'll go ahead and

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.529 
Internet Explorer we'll go ahead and
expand<00:00:37.539> volumes<00:00:37.899> here<00:00:38.079> and<00:00:38.370> I<00:00:39.370> am<00:00:39.699> going<00:00:40.120> to

00:00:40.529 --> 00:00:40.539 
expand volumes here and I am going to

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:45.060 
expand volumes here and I am going to
create<00:00:41.140> a<00:00:41.530> volume<00:00:41.800> and<00:00:43.499> here<00:00:44.499> we're<00:00:44.769> going<00:00:44.949> to

create a volume and here we're going to

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.819 
create a volume and here we're going to
choose<00:00:45.909> any<00:00:46.210> volume<00:00:46.510> size<00:00:46.839> and<00:00:47.260> in<00:00:47.409> this<00:00:47.589> case

choose any volume size and in this case

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:51.119 
choose any volume size and in this case
maybe<00:00:48.100> I'll<00:00:48.309> choose<00:00:48.609> 50<00:00:49.449> gigs<00:00:49.749> and<00:00:50.050> we'll<00:00:50.890> go

00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:51.129 
maybe I'll choose 50 gigs and we'll go

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:55.799

or click continue and we can go ahead
and<00:03:56.960> create<00:03:57.740> now<00:04:03.100> so<00:04:04.100> next<00:04:04.280> we're<00:04:04.580> going<00:04:04.730> to

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:04.850 
and create now so next we're going to

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:07.120 
and create now so next we're going to
have<00:04:05.060> the<00:04:05.690> wizard<00:04:06.230> is<00:04:06.350> going<00:04:06.590> to<00:04:06.710> bring<00:04:06.950> us<00:04:07.100> to

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:07.130 
have the wizard is going to bring us to

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:09.240 
have the wizard is going to bring us to
several<00:04:07.760> options<00:04:08.120> that<00:04:08.300> are<00:04:08.420> fairly<00:04:08.720> common

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
several options that are fairly common

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.190 
several options that are fairly common
that<00:04:10.250> we<00:04:10.760> would<00:04:10.970> perform<00:04:11.180> after<00:04:11.570> we<00:04:11.840> create<00:04:12.170> a

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200 
that we would perform after we create a

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.710 
that we would perform after we create a
volume<00:04:12.410> so<00:04:13.100> map<00:04:13.520> this<00:04:13.760> volume<00:04:14.090> to<00:04:14.270> this<00:04:14.450> server

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 
volume so map this volume to this server

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.990 
volume so map this volume to this server
so<00:04:15.050> this<00:04:15.230> is<00:04:15.440> the<00:04:15.620> the<00:04:15.980> server<00:04:16.280> or<00:04:16.609> the<00:04:16.640> server

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000 
so this is the the server or the server

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.539 
so this is the the server or the server
cluster<00:04:17.540> that<00:04:18.079> we<00:04:18.350> can<00:04:18.530> map<00:04:18.739> it<00:04:18.890> to<00:04:19.040> we<00:04:19.190> can<00:04:19.370> map

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 
cluster that we can map it to we can map

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:21.400 
cluster that we can map it to we can map
it<00:04:19.700> to<00:04:19.730> a<00:04:19.850> different<00:04:20.180> server<00:04:20.540> we<00:04:21.019> can<00:04:21.230> map<00:04:21.380> a

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410 
it to a different server we can map a

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:23.710 
it to a different server we can map a
different<00:04:21.890> volume<00:04:22.040> to<00:04:22.400> the<00:04:22.490> server<00:04:22.760> and<00:04:23.000> on

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 
different volume to the server and on

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.750 
different volume to the server and on
and<00:04:23.930> on<00:04:24.050> so<00:04:24.380> we'll<00:04:24.530> go<00:04:24.680> ahead<00:04:24.800> and<00:04:24.980> map<00:04:25.580> this

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:25.760 
and on so we'll go ahead and map this

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.450 
and on so we'll go ahead and map this
volume<00:04:26.150> to<00:04:26.300> the<00:04:26.420> server<00:04:26.750> we'll<00:04:27.740> click<00:04:28.040> create

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460 
volume to the server we'll click create

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:34.330 
volume to the server we'll click create
now<00:04:30.070> and<00:04:32.050> that<00:04:33.050> is<00:04:33.200> the<00:04:33.350> last<00:04:33.560> item<00:04:33.860> that<00:04:34.160> we

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
now and that is the last item that we

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.550 
now and that is the last item that we
are<00:04:34.520> going<00:04:34.910> to<00:04:35.120> perform<00:04:35.450> so<00:04:35.990> we<00:04:36.110> can<00:04:36.260> go<00:04:36.440> ahead

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560 
are going to perform so we can go ahead

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:40.660 
are going to perform so we can go ahead
and<00:04:36.980> click<00:04:37.430> close<00:04:38.830> so<00:04:39.830> from<00:04:40.190> here<00:04:40.430> if<00:04:40.640> you

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:40.670 
and click close so from here if you

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:42.490 
and click close so from here if you
would<00:04:40.940> like<00:04:41.090> to<00:04:41.120> practice<00:04:41.450> you<00:04:41.900> can<00:04:42.140> go<00:04:42.380> ahead

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:42.500 
would like to practice you can go ahead

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:46.330 
would like to practice you can go ahead
