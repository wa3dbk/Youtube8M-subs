generic cooktop we are Mike and this is
a<00:00:17.460> very<00:00:17.910> unique<00:00:18.090> cooktop<00:00:18.779> in<00:00:19.020> that<00:00:19.170> it's

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
a very unique cooktop in that it's

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.019 
a very unique cooktop in that it's
induction<00:00:19.920> that's<00:00:20.100> a<00:00:20.220> relatively<00:00:20.699> new

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
induction that's a relatively new

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.689 
induction that's a relatively new
technology<00:00:21.619> uses<00:00:22.619> a<00:00:22.650> magnetic<00:00:23.070> generator

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
technology uses a magnetic generator

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:24.800 
technology uses a magnetic generator
where<00:00:23.970> that<00:00:24.119> actually<00:00:24.449> goes<00:00:24.600> directly

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
where that actually goes directly

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.470 
where that actually goes directly
through<00:00:25.170> the<00:00:25.650> glass<00:00:25.890> to<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:26.849> ferrous<00:00:27.300> iron

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
through the glass to the ferrous iron

you<00:01:11.970> know<00:01:12.090> is<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.420> innovator<00:01:12.840> of<00:01:12.960> downdraft

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
you know is the innovator of downdraft

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.270 
you know is the innovator of downdraft
up<00:01:14.640> up<00:01:14.850> them<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:15.600> they<00:01:16.320> came<00:01:16.590> out<00:01:16.650> with<00:01:16.799> a<00:01:17.009> new

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
up up them and they came out with a new

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.690 
up up them and they came out with a new
one<00:01:17.520> that<00:01:17.729> actually<00:01:18.740> rises<00:01:19.740> five<00:01:20.220> inches

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
one that actually rises five inches

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.580 
one that actually rises five inches
higher<00:01:20.970> than<00:01:21.000> what<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.600> previous<00:01:21.810> ones<00:01:22.290> did

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
higher than what the previous ones did

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.010 
higher than what the previous ones did
and<00:01:22.830> take<00:01:23.159> a<00:01:23.189> look<00:01:23.460> at<00:01:23.580> how<00:01:23.729> it<00:01:23.909> draws<00:01:24.240> the

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
and take a look at how it draws the

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.190 
and take a look at how it draws the
smoke<00:01:25.259> right<00:01:25.860> into<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.490> downdraft<00:01:27.150> vent<00:01:27.600> well

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
smoke right into the downdraft vent well

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.690 
smoke right into the downdraft vent well
that's<00:01:28.380> working<00:01:28.650> really<00:01:28.950> well<00:01:29.070> you<00:01:29.310> can<00:01:29.340> see

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
that's working really well you can see

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.370 
that's working really well you can see
see<00:01:29.909> all<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.150> smoke<00:01:30.420> grease<00:01:30.720> and<00:01:30.930> odors<00:01:31.229> go

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
see all the smoke grease and odors go

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.289 
see all the smoke grease and odors go
right<00:01:31.619> into<00:01:31.799> that<00:01:32.040> pop-up<00:01:32.280> event<00:01:32.820> but<00:01:33.270> you

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
right into that pop-up event but you

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.940 
right into that pop-up event but you
know<00:01:33.479> what's<00:01:33.659> really<00:01:33.960> unique<00:01:34.079> too<00:01:34.470> is<00:01:34.710> that

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
know what's really unique too is that

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.240 
know what's really unique too is that
even<00:01:35.610> if<00:01:35.729> you<00:01:35.909> cannot<00:01:36.210> vent<00:01:36.920> outside<00:01:37.920> either

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
even if you cannot vent outside either

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.710 
even if you cannot vent outside either
through<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.700> concrete<00:01:39.240> or<00:01:39.450> through<00:01:39.689> a

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
through the concrete or through a

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.490 
through the concrete or through a
subfloor<00:01:40.590> they<00:01:41.400> make<00:01:41.610> a<00:01:41.880> non<00:01:42.240> vented<00:01:42.930> option

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
subfloor they make a non vented option

you don't have to go outside with event
exactly<00:02:05.700> that's<00:02:05.850> amazing<00:02:06.420> take<00:02:06.750> a<00:02:06.780> look<00:02:06.990> how

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
exactly that's amazing take a look how

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.919 
exactly that's amazing take a look how
that<00:02:07.170> pot<00:02:07.590> of<00:02:07.770> water<00:02:08.009> is<00:02:08.280> boiling<00:02:08.580> is<00:02:08.940> so<00:02:09.420> even

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
that pot of water is boiling is so even

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.440 
that pot of water is boiling is so even
and<00:02:10.379> as<00:02:10.590> we<00:02:10.770> put<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.129> paw<00:02:11.340> stance

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
and as we put the paw stance

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.140 
and as we put the paw stance
it<00:02:12.780> just<00:02:13.109> maintains<00:02:13.349> that<00:02:14.099> boiling<00:02:14.430> level<00:02:15.030> and

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
it just maintains that boiling level and

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.599 
it just maintains that boiling level and
does<00:02:15.329> such<00:02:15.780> an<00:02:15.959> excellent<00:02:16.530> job<00:02:16.799> boy<00:02:17.370> it<00:02:17.549> sure

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
the pasta in that boil will actually go

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.509 
the pasta in that boil will actually go
down<00:02:24.390> to<00:02:24.540> zero<00:02:24.900> this<00:02:25.739> one<00:02:25.950> actually<00:02:26.099> has<00:02:26.400> an

down to zero this one actually has an

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:28.429 
down to zero this one actually has an
optional<00:02:26.969> boost<00:02:27.239> as<00:02:27.510> well<00:02:27.540> if<00:02:27.930> you<00:02:28.049> put<00:02:28.260> the
