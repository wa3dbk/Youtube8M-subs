00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
they can sharpen it in the field on our

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:43.890 
they can sharpen it in the field on our
rock<00:03:42.550> or<00:03:42.819> something<00:03:42.940> and<00:03:43.209> it<00:03:43.300> makes<00:03:43.450> it<00:03:43.540> easier

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
rock or something and it makes it easier

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.750 
rock or something and it makes it easier
but<00:03:44.050> I<00:03:44.410> mean<00:03:44.709> how<00:03:44.920> often<00:03:45.130> is<00:03:45.370> that<00:03:45.400> going<00:03:45.670> to

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
but I mean how often is that going to

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:54.259 
but I mean how often is that going to
happen<00:03:45.790> really<00:03:47.970> it<00:03:48.970> is<00:03:50.130> very<00:03:51.130> nicely<00:03:51.489> centered

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:59.759

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:10.989 
kind of underwhelming and honestly

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:13.860 
kind of underwhelming and honestly
it'sit's<00:04:11.620> not<00:04:11.890> that<00:04:11.950> great<00:04:12.660> just<00:04:13.660> just

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870
