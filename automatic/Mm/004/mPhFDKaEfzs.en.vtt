 modern in the gap the red wings while the 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.980
 true thief is a derivative of the m 14 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.470
 slightly modified with the cards of 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.630
 recovery of clear first round for the 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.269
 red wings that he lost starts first 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.210
 minute at no cost sacrificed by tapping 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.890
 red human and using witchcraft 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.070

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.360
 battlefield the turbo start of the 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.219
 red the queen's very difficult to 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.350
 manage a thief danger in turn 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.120
 of civilians you will put red double ground 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.620
 green on the battlefield but that 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.410
 enters the game tapped second round 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.030
 for the queen's stage 2 to summon 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.920
 boosted the ambush goblin that 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.020
 will give speed and more to all 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.789
 creatures trimming 8 damage to the crane 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.609
 the agro that drops to 12 life points with 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:02.160
 otherwise the queens heir 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.300
 second round for the crown promises 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.760
 land a forest 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.189
 now available for combinations 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.710
 of colors that use decidents 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:15.439
 pass third round then for the king the 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:18.990
 queen who puts k2 back to earth 

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:20.970
 fielding the war pilot 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.189
 goblin at 22 with the right to war anymore 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.979
 note 0 when it attacks all the others 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:29.880
 creatures attack her with her four 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:32.700
 11 creatures said a shock the goblin 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:38.790
 lurking 3 damage to the sour thief who goes 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:42.240
 at 20 life points now is also the time 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.909
 the thief 's third round failed 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.960
 to educate a creature so far 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:47.670
 evidently a bad hand that maybe 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.990
 he had to cancel races but that for 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.490
 inexperience 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:55.950
 these tests also serve this is 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:59.090
 succeeded in 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:02.729
 in taking we say a hand 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:04.469
 just as fast as those of the goal 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:07.289
 corner makes a call simply 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:09.899
 on the goblin war data pillar for 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:12.420
 avoid his war cry but then the 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:15.239
 the queen's fourth turn is trim 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:18.260
 to 33 damage of the saying that the goblins a 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:27.269
 wall that attack him inexorably 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:29.310
 trembling available for the lip up 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:31.349
 fourth round puts a wild land 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.760
 in evolution this is an arrow band 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:33.989
 who sacrificed herself to look for one 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:38.400
 basic land makes it come into play 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:40.590
 tapped passes still puts creatures in 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:44.819
 zero cost drops another minute and 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:47.160
 attack with three goblins to make one 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:50.430
 shocks are goblins taking then 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:52.470
 only two damages we are 4 advents stage 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.900
 red mana to discharge from the Vatican 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.370
 ii damage to the direct opponent by tapping 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.430
 another but our new download 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:02.209
 galvanica and red wings take home the 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.209
 second round
