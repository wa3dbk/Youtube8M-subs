them they start out in a factory like
this<00:00:16.049> one<00:00:16.350> the<00:00:17.010> first<00:00:17.250> ingredient<00:00:17.910> is<00:00:18.090> the

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
this one the first ingredient is the

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:18.950 
this one the first ingredient is the
yeast

yeast

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.260 
yeast
this<00:00:19.439> helps<00:00:19.830> the<00:00:19.980> dough<00:00:20.160> to<00:00:20.220> rise<00:00:20.369> and<00:00:21.060> gives

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
this helps the dough to rise and gives

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.140 
this helps the dough to rise and gives
the<00:00:21.480> ring<00:00:21.750> its<00:00:22.020> light<00:00:22.320> fluffy<00:00:22.680> texture<00:00:23.369> the

the ring its light fluffy texture the
yeast<00:00:24.420> works<00:00:24.660> faster<00:00:25.350> if<00:00:25.500> conditions<00:00:26.039> are

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
yeast works faster if conditions are

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.279 
yeast works faster if conditions are
warm<00:00:26.460> but<00:00:26.910> if<00:00:27.000> it's<00:00:27.119> too<00:00:27.449> warm<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:28.050> yeast

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
warm but if it's too warm the yeast

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.580 
warm but if it's too warm the yeast
cells<00:00:28.680> will<00:00:28.980> die<00:00:29.279> so<00:00:30.000> on<00:00:30.179> hot<00:00:30.449> days<00:00:30.720> ice<00:00:31.109> is
