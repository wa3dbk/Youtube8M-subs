 cook the dog but it turned out that 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:11.769
 catch a stray dog ​​is not so 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:14.140
 just especially considering that games 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:17.260

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:19.060
 it dawned quickly and inexpensively get ready 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:28.240

 by death my sensei 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:34.240
 taught me the recipe for the most slaughter in 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:37.030

 in fact the recipe for this is as very 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:56.009
 simple sometimes I wonder why we 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:58.509
 sensei hid from me until death 

00:04:56.009 --> 00:05:00.310

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:25.360
