00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 
gonna look quite chunky it's going to

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.510 
gonna look quite chunky it's going to
look<00:03:34.980> lead<00:03:35.340> it<00:03:35.580> into<00:03:35.880> the<00:03:36.120> milk<00:03:36.510> and<00:03:36.810> the<00:03:37.290> egg

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:37.520 
look lead it into the milk and the egg

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:59.240 
look lead it into the milk and the egg
you<00:03:38.520> don't<00:03:38.700> have<00:03:38.880> eggs<00:03:40.760> because<00:03:42.050> it's<00:03:58.010> so<00:03:59.010> what

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
you don't have eggs because it's so what

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.850 
you don't have eggs because it's so what
it's<00:03:59.400> about<00:03:59.490> to<00:03:59.850> that<00:04:00.090> consistency<00:04:00.860> you're

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860 
it's about to that consistency you're

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:05.360 
it's about to that consistency you're
pretty<00:04:02.190> much<00:04:02.400> good<00:04:02.730> to<00:04:02.760> go<00:04:02.970> for<00:04:03.360> dipping<00:04:04.370> so

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
pretty much good to go for dipping so

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.310 
pretty much good to go for dipping so
basically<00:04:05.880> you'll<00:04:06.120> take<00:04:06.390> your<00:04:06.780> bread<00:04:07.050> and

grocery store or Walmart you can get a
sunbeam<00:04:18.299> and<00:04:18.600> they<00:04:18.660> have<00:04:18.840> it<00:04:18.989> in<00:04:19.109> giant<00:04:19.739> John

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 
it works just as well so the first thing

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.640 
it works just as well so the first thing
you<00:04:23.220> want<00:04:23.400> to<00:04:23.460> do<00:04:23.640> is<00:04:24.090> you'll<00:04:24.720> take<00:04:25.050> your<00:04:25.470> going

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
you want to do is you'll take your going

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.820 
you want to do is you'll take your going
to<00:04:25.710> dip<00:04:25.950> both<00:04:26.220> sides<00:04:26.580> of<00:04:27.000> your<00:04:27.180> brain<00:04:27.330> okay<00:04:28.200> so

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
to dip both sides of your brain okay so

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:31.100 
to dip both sides of your brain okay so
basically<00:04:29.340> all<00:04:29.760> you<00:04:29.910> do<00:04:30.060> is<00:04:30.240> just<00:04:30.480> take<00:04:30.780> the

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
basically all you do is just take the

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:36.140 
basically all you do is just take the
corner<00:04:31.470> in<00:04:31.770> dip<00:04:32.580> it<00:04:32.790> on<00:04:32.940> one<00:04:33.180> side<00:04:35.000> flip<00:04:36.000> it

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 
corner in dip it on one side flip it

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:40.190 
corner in dip it on one side flip it
over

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:40.200 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:05:18.320 

and<00:04:40.560> then<00:04:40.920> just<00:04:41.370> basically<00:05:16.970> you<00:05:17.970> don't<00:05:18.180> have

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:18.330 
and then just basically you don't have

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:22.730 
and then just basically you don't have
like<00:05:19.130> loose<00:05:20.130> egg<00:05:20.550> in<00:05:21.000> it<00:05:21.180> so<00:05:21.900> mainly<00:05:22.350> the<00:05:22.500> thing

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:22.740 
like loose egg in it so mainly the thing

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:24.260 
like loose egg in it so mainly the thing
I<00:05:22.890> like<00:05:23.100> to<00:05:23.280> kind<00:05:23.490> of<00:05:23.550> do<00:05:23.670> with<00:05:23.790> my<00:05:23.940> spatula

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:24.270 
I like to kind of do with my spatula

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:27.110 
I like to kind of do with my spatula
since<00:05:24.780> it's<00:05:24.930> about<00:05:25.170> the<00:05:25.350> same<00:05:25.590> size<00:05:25.820> it's<00:05:26.820> kind

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:27.120 
since it's about the same size it's kind

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.690 
since it's about the same size it's kind
of<00:05:27.240> pressed<00:05:27.540> down<00:05:27.810> the<00:05:27.840> center<00:05:28.500> and<00:05:29.070> this<00:05:29.340> just

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:29.700 
of pressed down the center and this just

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:32.300 
of pressed down the center and this just
richer's<00:05:30.360> that<00:05:30.780> any<00:05:31.020> egg<00:05:31.320> product<00:05:31.920> that's<00:05:32.130> in

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:32.310 
richer's that any egg product that's in

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:34.460 
richer's that any egg product that's in
there<00:05:32.520> is<00:05:32.550> getting<00:05:33.060> cooked<00:05:33.390> fully<00:05:33.690> because

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:34.470 
there is getting cooked fully because

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:43.460 
there is getting cooked fully because
you<00:05:34.620> definitely<00:05:35.100> don't<00:05:41.870> it<00:05:42.870> doesn't<00:05:43.260> take

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:43.470 
you definitely don't it doesn't take

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:49.310 
you definitely don't it doesn't take
very<00:05:43.770> long<00:05:44.480> it's<00:05:45.480> a<00:05:47.450> ton<00:05:48.450> of<00:05:48.480> stuff<00:05:48.930> and<00:05:49.230> I

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:49.320 
very long it's a ton of stuff and I

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:53.960 
very long it's a ton of stuff and I
never<00:05:49.500> measure<00:05:49.890> stuff<00:05:50.400> I'd<00:05:50.910> say<00:05:51.450> about<00:05:52.970> two

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:53.970 
never measure stuff I'd say about two

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:57.350 
never measure stuff I'd say about two
minutes<00:05:54.270> on<00:05:54.570> each<00:05:54.780> side

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:57.360 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:59.869 

you<00:05:57.539> just<00:05:57.780> dropped<00:05:58.080> it<00:05:58.289> it's<00:05:58.770> most<00:05:59.400> probably

00:05:59.869 --> 00:05:59.879 
you just dropped it it's most probably

00:05:59.879 --> 00:06:03.969 
you just dropped it it's most probably
likely<00:06:00.659> where<00:06:01.050> I<00:06:01.080> need<00:06:01.229> to<00:06:01.409> be<00:06:02.310> flipped<00:06:02.610> over

00:06:03.969 --> 00:06:03.979 
likely where I need to be flipped over

00:06:03.979 --> 00:06:06.649 
likely where I need to be flipped over
let's<00:06:04.979> just<00:06:05.189> see<00:06:05.370> you're<00:06:05.490> like<00:06:05.580> so<00:06:06.419> like<00:06:06.539> I

00:06:06.649 --> 00:06:06.659 
let's just see you're like so like I

00:06:06.659 --> 00:06:08.510 
let's just see you're like so like I
said<00:06:06.719> you<00:06:06.930> don't<00:06:07.050> have<00:06:07.199> to<00:06:07.469> swish<00:06:08.039> the<00:06:08.250> toast

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:08.520 
said you don't have to swish the toast

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:13.129 
said you don't have to swish the toast
down<00:06:10.699> but<00:06:11.699> in<00:06:12.060> to<00:06:12.330> ensure<00:06:12.509> that<00:06:12.840> the<00:06:12.960> egg<00:06:13.110> is

00:06:13.129 --> 00:06:13.139 
down but in to ensure that the egg is

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:15.679 
down but in to ensure that the egg is
fully<00:06:13.500> cooked<00:06:13.740> I<00:06:14.009> like<00:06:14.370> it<00:06:14.639> that's<00:06:15.120> offset<00:06:15.539> the

00:06:15.679 --> 00:06:15.689 
fully cooked I like it that's offset the

00:06:15.689 --> 00:06:17.119 
fully cooked I like it that's offset the
purpose<00:06:16.020> of<00:06:16.169> getting<00:06:16.259> the<00:06:16.530> thicker<00:06:16.770> toast

00:06:17.119 --> 00:06:17.129 
purpose of getting the thicker toast

00:06:17.129 --> 00:06:18.379 
purpose of getting the thicker toast
because<00:06:17.490> if<00:06:17.610> you<00:06:17.699> did<00:06:17.879> this<00:06:17.969> one<00:06:18.150> with<00:06:18.270> a

00:06:18.379 --> 00:06:18.389 
because if you did this one with a

00:06:18.389 --> 00:06:20.240 
because if you did this one with a
regular<00:06:18.569> style<00:06:19.050> for<00:06:19.349> it<00:06:19.469> by<00:06:19.889> the<00:06:19.949> time<00:06:20.219> you

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:20.250 
regular style for it by the time you

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:21.950 
regular style for it by the time you
squeeze<00:06:20.610> it<00:06:20.879> down<00:06:21.030> it<00:06:21.300> feels<00:06:21.419> like<00:06:21.599> a<00:06:21.629> flat

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:21.960 
squeeze it down it feels like a flat

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:28.550 
squeeze it down it feels like a flat
mess<00:06:22.370> so<00:06:25.520> let's<00:06:26.520> go<00:06:26.669> ahead<00:06:26.789> and<00:06:27.120> flip<00:06:27.360> them<00:06:27.689> and

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:28.560 
mess so let's go ahead and flip them and

00:06:28.560 --> 00:07:21.680 
mess so let's go ahead and flip them and
you'll<00:06:28.740> start<00:06:28.979> smelling

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:21.690 

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:25.140 

wouldn't<00:07:22.690> make<00:07:22.780> sure<00:07:22.960> there's
