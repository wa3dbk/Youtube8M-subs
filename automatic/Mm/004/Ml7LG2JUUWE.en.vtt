00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
and as I've said before the speed is

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.850 
and as I've said before the speed is
controlled<00:03:36.370> via<00:03:36.489> potentiometer<00:03:37.330> so<00:03:38.050> i'll<00:03:38.410> go

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:38.860 
controlled via potentiometer so i'll go

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:44.570 
controlled via potentiometer so i'll go
ahead<00:03:38.920> and<00:03:39.340> show<00:03:39.520> you<00:03:39.910> the<00:03:40.720> demonstration

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:29.770 
down or speeds up the LEDs so a little

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:32.130 
down or speeds up the LEDs so a little
bit<00:05:29.920> about<00:05:30.100> that<00:05:30.480> what<00:05:31.480> you<00:05:31.570> have<00:05:31.720> here<00:05:31.900> is<00:05:31.930> the

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:32.140 
bit about that what you have here is the

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:35.490 
bit about that what you have here is the
green<00:05:32.440> high<00:05:32.680> side<00:05:33.090> LED<00:05:34.090> and<00:05:34.360> the<00:05:34.720> red<00:05:34.990> low<00:05:35.260> side

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:35.500 
green high side LED and the red low side

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.730 
green high side LED and the red low side
fits<00:05:35.860> and<00:05:36.730> all<00:05:37.120> that's<00:05:37.240> doing<00:05:37.450> is<00:05:37.930> simulating

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:38.740 
fits and all that's doing is simulating

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:41.520 
fits and all that's doing is simulating
the<00:05:39.010> way<00:05:39.940> that<00:05:40.270> you<00:05:40.540> would<00:05:40.750> turn<00:05:41.020> the<00:05:41.170> feds<00:05:41.380> on

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:41.530 
the way that you would turn the feds on

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:43.470 
the way that you would turn the feds on
and<00:05:41.710> off<00:05:41.800> to<00:05:42.100> calm<00:05:42.430> you<00:05:42.520> take<00:05:42.700> the<00:05:42.880> motor<00:05:43.060> so

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:43.480 
and off to calm you take the motor so

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:46.830 
and off to calm you take the motor so
turn<00:05:44.290> high<00:05:44.500> side<00:05:44.710> green<00:05:44.950> on<00:05:45.160> other<00:05:45.460> side<00:05:45.840> red

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:46.840 
turn high side green on other side red

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:48.720 
turn high side green on other side red
and<00:05:47.200> then<00:05:47.620> you<00:05:47.740> should<00:05:47.920> just<00:05:47.950> step<00:05:48.340> through<00:05:48.400> in

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:48.730 
and then you should just step through in

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:52.460 
and then you should just step through in
that<00:05:48.880> order<00:05:49.150> and<00:05:49.800> then<00:05:50.800> the<00:05:50.830> control<00:05:51.340> itself

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:52.470 
that order and then the control itself

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:56.820 
that order and then the control itself
is<00:05:53.470> via<00:05:53.800> this<00:05:54.010> potentiometer<00:05:55.290> so<00:05:56.290> as<00:05:56.440> I<00:05:56.560> turn

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:56.830 
is via this potentiometer so as I turn

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:00.810 
is via this potentiometer so as I turn
it<00:05:56.980> to<00:05:57.790> the<00:05:57.820> right<00:05:57.940> it<00:05:58.330> slows<00:05:58.600> it<00:05:58.630> down<00:05:58.810> as<00:05:59.820> I

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:00.820 
it to the right it slows it down as I

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:06.890 
it to the right it slows it down as I
turn<00:06:01.000> to<00:06:01.210> the<00:06:01.300> left<00:06:01.650> they<00:06:02.650> speed<00:06:02.920> up<00:06:05.070> okay<00:06:06.070> now

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:06.900 
turn to the left they speed up okay now

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:13.340 
turn to the left they speed up okay now
flip<00:06:07.900> these<00:06:08.170> switches<00:06:08.880> flip<00:06:09.880> and<00:06:10.180> flip<00:06:12.060> and

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:13.350 
flip these switches flip and flip and

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:16.110 
flip these switches flip and flip and
the<00:06:14.350> motor<00:06:14.590> starts<00:06:15.040> going<00:06:15.340> in<00:06:15.490> the<00:06:15.580> opposite

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:16.120 
the motor starts going in the opposite

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:25.020 
the motor starts going in the opposite
direction<00:06:18.060> slows<00:06:19.060> down<00:06:21.420> speeds<00:06:22.420> up<00:06:23.970> let<00:06:24.970> me

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:25.030 
direction slows down speeds up let me

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:26.550 
direction slows down speeds up let me
turn<00:06:25.210> the<00:06:25.360> light<00:06:25.510> on<00:06:25.540> so<00:06:25.960> I<00:06:26.020> can<00:06:26.080> show<00:06:26.500> you

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:26.560 
turn the light on so I can show you

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:31.400 
turn the light on so I can show you
exactly<00:06:26.800> what<00:06:27.310> I'm<00:06:27.460> doing

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:31.410 

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:36.900 

alright<00:06:32.460> so<00:06:33.460> there's<00:06:34.120> LED<00:06:35.070> blinking<00:06:36.070> this

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:36.910 
alright so there's LED blinking this

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:41.030 
alright so there's LED blinking this
potentiometer<00:06:37.390> is<00:06:38.490> what<00:06:39.490> I've<00:06:39.610> been<00:06:39.640> turning

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:41.040 
potentiometer is what I've been turning

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:51.980 
potentiometer is what I've been turning
clockwise<00:06:43.440> to<00:06:44.440> slow<00:06:44.800> them<00:06:45.010> down<00:06:48.210> and

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:51.990 

00:06:51.990 --> 00:07:02.370 

counterclockwise<00:06:54.330> to<00:06:55.330> speed<00:06:55.660> them<00:06:55.810> up<00:07:01.380> and

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:02.380 
counterclockwise to speed them up and

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:03.960 
counterclockwise to speed them up and
then<00:07:02.500> all<00:07:02.650> you<00:07:02.770> do<00:07:02.890> is<00:07:02.950> flip<00:07:03.220> the<00:07:03.370> clock<00:07:03.700> switch

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:03.970 
then all you do is flip the clock switch

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:16.190 
then all you do is flip the clock switch
and<00:07:06.390> this<00:07:07.440> back<00:07:08.440> over<00:07:12.030> and<00:07:13.290> now<00:07:14.290> they're

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:16.200 
and this back over and now they're

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:21.270 
and this back over and now they're
running<00:07:17.200> directions<00:07:18.060> flip<00:07:19.060> out<00:07:20.010> look<00:07:21.010> that

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:21.280 
running directions flip out look that

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:30.180 
running directions flip out look that
and<00:07:21.870> we'll<00:07:22.870> get<00:07:23.080> them<00:07:23.340> changed<00:07:24.340> up<00:07:24.760> again

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:30.190 

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:34.490 

so<00:07:30.850> that's<00:07:31.660> it<00:07:31.870> i<00:07:32.370> hope<00:07:33.370> this<00:07:33.940> breadboard

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:34.500 
so that's it i hope this breadboard

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:39.950 
so that's it i hope this breadboard
