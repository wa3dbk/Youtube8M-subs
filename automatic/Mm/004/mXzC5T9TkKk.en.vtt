all<00:00:00.539> right<00:00:00.659> so<00:00:00.900> I<00:00:00.930> thought<00:00:01.199> I'd<00:00:01.350> do<00:00:01.500> a<00:00:01.530> video<00:00:01.800> on

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:01.949 
all right so I thought I'd do a video on

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:03.770 
all right so I thought I'd do a video on
my<00:00:02.129> new<00:00:02.340> siren<00:00:02.580> that<00:00:02.790> I<00:00:02.850> got<00:00:03.120> I<00:00:03.330> got<00:00:03.600> this

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:03.780 
my new siren that I got I got this

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.530 
my new siren that I got I got this
actually<00:00:04.200> before<00:00:04.560> I<00:00:04.589> got<00:00:04.770> the<00:00:04.950> Thunderbolt

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:05.540 
actually before I got the Thunderbolt

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:07.880 
actually before I got the Thunderbolt
but<00:00:06.540> I<00:00:06.569> was<00:00:06.810> doing<00:00:07.049> some<00:00:07.200> restoration<00:00:07.319> on<00:00:07.859> this

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
but I was doing some restoration on this

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.150 
but I was doing some restoration on this
as<00:00:08.220> you<00:00:08.250> can<00:00:08.370> see<00:00:09.620> before<00:00:10.620> I<00:00:10.679> decided<00:00:10.950> to<00:00:11.040> make

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
as you can see before I decided to make

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.150 
as you can see before I decided to make
a<00:00:11.190> video<00:00:11.400> anyway<00:00:11.759> this<00:00:12.540> is<00:00:12.900> an<00:00:13.139> Edward<00:00:13.620> siren

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
a video anyway this is an Edward siren

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.700 
a video anyway this is an Edward siren
bottle<00:00:14.700> basically<00:00:15.330> a<00:00:15.360> model<00:00:15.780> a<00:00:15.870> knockoff<00:00:16.350> the

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
bottle basically a model a knockoff the

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.230 
bottle basically a model a knockoff the
model<00:00:17.580> is<00:00:17.730> 315<00:00:18.650> you<00:00:19.650> can<00:00:19.800> see<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.070> little<00:00:20.310> tag

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
model is 315 you can see the little tag

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.189 
model is 315 you can see the little tag
here<00:00:22.730> when<00:00:23.730> I<00:00:23.760> got<00:00:24.000> this<00:00:24.240> the<00:00:24.570> motor<00:00:24.779> did<00:00:25.050> not

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
here when I got this the motor did not

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.980 
here when I got this the motor did not
really<00:00:25.470> turn<00:00:25.820> and<00:00:26.820> it's<00:00:26.939> pretty<00:00:27.090> rusted<00:00:27.570> and<00:00:27.720> I

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
really turn and it's pretty rusted and I

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.230 
really turn and it's pretty rusted and I
just<00:00:28.500> didn't<00:00:28.680> look<00:00:28.769> pretty<00:00:28.949> in<00:00:29.160> it<00:00:29.279> it<00:00:30.029> uh<00:00:30.060> it

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
just didn't look pretty in it it uh it

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.680 
just didn't look pretty in it it uh it
just<00:00:30.960> it<00:00:31.529> was<00:00:31.710> a<00:00:31.740> bad<00:00:31.980> deal<00:00:32.489> but<00:00:33.329> it<00:00:33.420> was<00:00:33.510> only

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
just it was a bad deal but it was only

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.500 
just it was a bad deal but it was only
$30<00:00:34.380> so<00:00:34.620> I<00:00:34.649> thought<00:00:34.920> oh<00:00:35.130> why<00:00:35.309> not

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
$30 so I thought oh why not

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.720 
$30 so I thought oh why not
anyway<00:00:37.230> it's<00:00:37.710> a<00:00:37.980> lot<00:00:38.160> bigger<00:00:38.399> than<00:00:38.489> I<00:00:38.700> thought

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
anyway it's a lot bigger than I thought

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.310 
anyway it's a lot bigger than I thought
it<00:00:39.059> was<00:00:39.180> nobody<00:00:39.600> ever<00:00:39.750> told<00:00:39.899> me<00:00:40.020> these<00:00:40.200> are

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
it was nobody ever told me these are

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.590 
it was nobody ever told me these are
this<00:00:40.469> big<00:00:40.850> it<00:00:41.850> is<00:00:41.969> about<00:00:42.180> a<00:00:42.239> foot<00:00:43.170> tall

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:44.600 
this big it is about a foot tall

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.209 
this big it is about a foot tall
surprisingly<00:00:45.600> I<00:00:45.930> thought<00:00:46.829> it<00:00:46.890> would<00:00:47.010> just<00:00:47.129> be

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
surprisingly I thought it would just be

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.319 
surprisingly I thought it would just be
a<00:00:47.250> little<00:00:47.489> bit<00:00:47.579> smaller<00:00:47.850> than<00:00:47.969> that<00:00:48.090> I<00:00:48.120> don't

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
a little bit smaller than that I don't

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:54.639 
a little bit smaller than that I don't
know<00:00:48.420> why<00:00:49.039> anyway<00:00:50.039> I<00:00:50.870> had<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:51.899> do<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.649> new<00:00:52.890> motor

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:54.649 
know why anyway I had to do a new motor

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:59.720 
know why anyway I had to do a new motor
the<00:00:55.649> old<00:00:55.800> one<00:00:56.010> was<00:00:56.219> completely<00:00:56.730> shorted<00:00:58.699> so<00:00:59.699> I

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
the old one was completely shorted so I

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.139 
the old one was completely shorted so I
got<00:01:00.239> a<00:01:00.270> new<00:01:00.510> motor<00:01:00.840> and<00:01:01.289> before<00:01:02.129> it's<00:01:02.760> been<00:01:02.969> way

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
got a new motor and before it's been way

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.450 
got a new motor and before it's been way
too<00:01:03.180> fast<00:01:03.539> it<00:01:03.809> actually<00:01:04.080> spun<00:01:04.409> at<00:01:04.799> a<00:01:07.460> 19,500

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
too fast it actually spun at a 19,500

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.800 
too fast it actually spun at a 19,500
rpm<00:01:08.880> way<00:01:09.330> way<00:01:09.630> way<00:01:09.810> too<00:01:09.869> fast<00:01:10.020> its<00:01:10.470> end<00:01:10.650> like<00:01:10.799> a

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
rpm way way way too fast its end like a

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.330 
rpm way way way too fast its end like a
2001<00:01:12.810> on<00:01:12.960> steroids<00:01:13.470> I'll<00:01:13.590> have<00:01:13.710> to<00:01:13.860> post<00:01:14.189> a

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
2001 on steroids I'll have to post a

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.940 
2001 on steroids I'll have to post a
video<00:01:14.430> of<00:01:14.610> that<00:01:14.729> I<00:01:14.760> did<00:01:15.060> get<00:01:15.180> a<00:01:15.240> video<00:01:15.509> of<00:01:15.600> it<00:01:15.950> so

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
video of that I did get a video of it so

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.410 
video of that I did get a video of it so
I<00:01:16.979> put<00:01:17.040> a<00:01:17.220> dimmer<00:01:17.460> switch<00:01:17.549> in<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:17.939> back<00:01:18.119> and

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
I put a dimmer switch in the back and

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.789 
I put a dimmer switch in the back and
that<00:01:18.479> seems<00:01:18.990> to<00:01:19.080> work<00:01:19.170> instead<00:01:19.650> of<00:01:19.740> a

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
that seems to work instead of a

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.130 
that seems to work instead of a
transformer<00:01:20.400> just<00:01:20.430> seemed<00:01:20.820> a<00:01:20.939> cheaper<00:01:21.330> easier

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
transformer just seemed a cheaper easier

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.780 
transformer just seemed a cheaper easier
solution<00:01:23.119> fits<00:01:24.119> in<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:25.009> fits<00:01:26.009> in<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.310> housing

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
solution fits in the fits in the housing

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.810 
solution fits in the fits in the housing
back<00:01:27.000> there<00:01:27.710> but<00:01:28.710> anyway<00:01:28.979> yeah<00:01:29.220> I<00:01:29.250> took<00:01:29.400> it<00:01:29.549> and

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
back there but anyway yeah I took it and

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.539 
back there but anyway yeah I took it and
sent<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.630> motor<00:01:30.840> to<00:01:31.079> Jeb<00:01:31.350> thank<00:01:32.310> you<00:01:32.400> very

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
sent the motor to Jeb thank you very

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.120 
sent the motor to Jeb thank you very
much<00:01:32.729> for<00:01:32.970> giving<00:01:33.180> it<00:01:33.360> a<00:01:33.420> test<00:01:33.659> and<00:01:33.990> it<00:01:34.950> does

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
much for giving it a test and it does

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.670 
much for giving it a test and it does
not<00:01:35.280> work<00:01:35.460> unfortunately<00:01:36.240> so<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:37.350> new<00:01:37.470> motor

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
not work unfortunately so the new motor

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.440 
not work unfortunately so the new motor
seems<00:01:38.130> to<00:01:38.310> be<00:01:38.579> doing<00:01:38.729> ok<00:01:39.060> with<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.270> dimmer

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
seems to be doing ok with the dimmer

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.760 
seems to be doing ok with the dimmer
switch<00:01:39.890> gave<00:01:40.890> it<00:01:41.070> a<00:01:41.220> coat<00:01:41.460> of<00:01:41.670> paint<00:01:42.270> and

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
switch gave it a coat of paint and

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.700 
switch gave it a coat of paint and
primer<00:01:44.659> you<00:01:45.659> can<00:01:45.689> see<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.110> chopper<00:01:46.320> in<00:01:46.530> there

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
primer you can see the chopper in there

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.840 
primer you can see the chopper in there
this<00:01:46.979> is<00:01:47.210> six<00:01:48.210> ports<00:01:49.130> we<00:01:50.130> had<00:01:50.310> a<00:01:50.340> good<00:01:50.610> time

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
this is six ports we had a good time

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.069 
this is six ports we had a good time
trying<00:01:51.210> to<00:01:51.240> figure<00:01:51.420> out<00:01:51.540> how<00:01:51.689> to<00:01:51.750> get<00:01:51.960> this

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
trying to figure out how to get this

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.950 
trying to figure out how to get this
thing<00:01:52.290> pieces<00:01:53.220> because<00:01:54.060> it<00:01:54.210> basically<00:01:54.689> was<00:01:54.930> a

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
thing pieces because it basically was a

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.420 
thing pieces because it basically was a
crap<00:01:55.560> siren<00:01:56.040> anyway<00:01:57.560> let's<00:01:58.560> give<00:01:58.740> it<00:01:58.770> a<00:01:58.920> test<00:01:59.100> I

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
crap siren anyway let's give it a test I

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.249 
crap siren anyway let's give it a test I
think<00:01:59.880> that's<00:02:00.090> all<00:02:00.270> I<00:02:00.299> have<00:02:00.540> to<00:02:00.659> talk<00:02:00.810> about<00:02:00.840> it

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
think that's all I have to talk about it

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:06.499 
think that's all I have to talk about it
just<00:02:03.890> kind<00:02:04.890> of<00:02:04.920> thing<00:02:05.159> put<00:02:05.909> on<00:02:06.000> a<00:02:06.030> shelf<00:02:06.299> and

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
just kind of thing put on a shelf and

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.169 
just kind of thing put on a shelf and
look<00:02:06.659> at<00:02:06.840> kind<00:02:07.200> of<00:02:07.259> alright<00:02:08.220> let's<00:02:08.789> give<00:02:08.970> it<00:02:09.030> a

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
look at kind of alright let's give it a

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:22.890 
look at kind of alright let's give it a
test<00:02:09.360> here

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:35.130 

I<00:02:32.700> thought<00:02:33.700> I'd<00:02:33.760> make<00:02:33.879> a<00:02:33.909> video<00:02:34.480> of<00:02:34.659> my<00:02:34.780> newest

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
I thought I'd make a video of my newest

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.970 
I thought I'd make a video of my newest
device<00:02:35.470> for<00:02:35.709> sirens<00:02:36.159> and<00:02:36.459> lights<00:02:36.489> and<00:02:37.209> such<00:02:37.450> I

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
device for sirens and lights and such I

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.220 
device for sirens and lights and such I
call<00:02:38.980> it<00:02:39.099> the<00:02:39.220> T<00:02:39.430> intercept<00:02:39.970> basically<00:02:40.810> it

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
call it the T intercept basically it

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.490 
call it the T intercept basically it
just<00:02:41.609> intercepts<00:02:42.609> the<00:02:42.790> cord<00:02:43.060> from<00:02:43.780> your

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
just intercepts the cord from your

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.280 
just intercepts the cord from your
standard<00:02:44.859> wall<00:02:45.010> power<00:02:45.280> going<00:02:46.000> out<00:02:46.180> to<00:02:47.019> your

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
standard wall power going out to your

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:48.720 
standard wall power going out to your
object<00:02:47.829> that<00:02:47.920> you're<00:02:48.069> running<00:02:48.310> right<00:02:48.519> now<00:02:48.670> I

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
object that you're running right now I

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.509 
object that you're running right now I
have<00:02:49.000> a<00:02:49.030> siren<00:02:49.629> attached<00:02:49.900> to<00:02:50.140> it<00:02:50.230> and

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 
have a siren attached to it and

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:54.479 
have a siren attached to it and
basically<00:02:51.519> this<00:02:52.329> is<00:02:52.659> an<00:02:53.109> intercept<00:02:53.560> and<00:02:53.799> this

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
basically this is an intercept and this

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:57.300 
basically this is an intercept and this
cord<00:02:54.819> goes<00:02:55.150> down<00:02:55.389> to<00:02:55.720> this<00:02:55.930> timer<00:02:56.310> which

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
cord goes down to this timer which

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:02.910 
cord goes down to this timer which
allows<00:02:57.730> me<00:02:58.030> to<00:02:59.700> basically<00:03:01.109> make<00:03:02.109> it<00:03:02.139> time

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
allows me to basically make it time

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.520 
allows me to basically make it time
didn't<00:03:03.220> have<00:03:03.340> the<00:03:03.579> little<00:03:03.819> ax<00:03:04.079> that<00:03:05.079> can<00:03:05.319> wheel

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
didn't have the little ax that can wheel

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:10.110 
didn't have the little ax that can wheel
