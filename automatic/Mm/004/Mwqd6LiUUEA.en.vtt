00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.330
 I took my vueling barcelona- donosti the 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:12.190
 Monday afternoon I had a dinner but 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:14.410
 Tuesday is closing day many places 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:16.450
 and I wanted to take the opportunity to visit some 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:18.070
 the list of recommended sites was 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:20.080
 endless and it has been very difficult 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.000
 making the selection seems impossible 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.160
 hilda to compare one with a chinstrap 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.230
 so I think of this ranking as 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.930
 Sites that are worth approaching 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.489
 I started the tour of Hidalgo 56 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.559
 They have a great variety of skewers 

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:34.690
 hot and cold I asked for the most 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:36.100
 requested and they put me a volcano is 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.019
 a good dose of an excellent 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.929
 burger blood sausage with a spicy point 

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:42.579
 so fried defatted and mixed with raisins 

00:00:40.929 --> 00:00:44.320
 As you can see, they make a little mountain 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:46.149
 crown with an egg yolk so 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.129
 when you break it, it looks like lava 

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:50.800
 of a volcano with the southpaw you know the 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:52.719

 I went to the echeverria brewery 

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:56.679
 so in the old part of the city ​​it's worth 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.569
 worthwhile for their originality they have a 

00:00:56.679 --> 00:01:00.039
 wide offer of beers the owner 

00:00:58.569 --> 00:01:02.679

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.620
 with the purito they were 370 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.630
 the next day after a brief 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.340

 great variety there is so much that it is difficult 

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:24.700

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:26.200
 to rate all donosti bars 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:28.120
 taking into account the great variety of 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.380
 offer that there is in all there I asked for a 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.180
 skewer that consisted of a couple of 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:33.070

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:06.170
 san telmo but the tuesday land so 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:08.240
 I have been wanting to try their 

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:10.190
 ear as it seems the team of 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.620
 bordaberry was in his day at the 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:14.690
 spoon there and I liked that you keep on 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:16.190
 done they announce it in the entrance there is no 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:18.290
 cold skewers so the bar is 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:19.640
 clean but there's a lot to choose from there 

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:21.980
 They recommended the beef cheek 

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:24.200
 to red wine serve in its sauce and with 

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:25.970
 mashed potatoes the meat was falling apart with 

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:28.240
 touching it were four euros with the 

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:28.240
 zurdito 

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:44.590
 The Donostia wine cellar is a classic but 

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:46.480
 the place is renovated with very good 

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:49.630
 taste although it has changed owners 

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:51.580

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:53.500
 preserves and pickles 

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:55.390
 characterized his kitchen one of my 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:57.100
 weaknesses are the gildas you know the 

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:58.660

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:00.580

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:05.010
 exceptional with the zurito pay 270 

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:17.070
 and finally I went to another historical 

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:18.750
 from the city ​​the bar antonio is 

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:20.820
 away from the old town but worth the 

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:22.440
 shame has tables on the terrace a bar 

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:24.210
 interior and a small dining room in the 

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:26.160
 basement I stayed at the bar and 

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:28.080
 I asked what they asked for most and not 

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:30.360
 had no doubt the anchovy of 

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:32.550
 huge Cantabrian on a slice of 

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:35.280
 bread and accompanied by roasted green pepper 

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:37.580
 and very rich chilli with the purito 350 

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:37.580
 euros 

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:56.280
 and here you have the ranking the week that 

00:06:53.729 --> 00:06:59.210

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:59.210
