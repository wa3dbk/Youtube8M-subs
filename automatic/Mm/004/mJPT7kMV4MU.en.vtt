00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:08.180 
at some level I guess we are because

these<00:00:08.360> kids<00:00:08.630> do<00:00:09.080> change<00:00:09.410> their<00:00:09.650> behavior<00:00:10.190> but

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:10.550 
these kids do change their behavior but

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:12.070 
these kids do change their behavior but
in<00:00:10.730> order<00:00:10.940> to<00:00:10.970> change<00:00:11.180> their<00:00:11.420> behavior<00:00:11.900> they

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:12.080 
in order to change their behavior they

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:13.660 
in order to change their behavior they
change<00:00:12.380> the<00:00:12.620> way<00:00:12.710> they<00:00:12.890> think<00:00:13.130> and<00:00:13.280> they<00:00:13.370> feel

change the way they think and they feel

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:15.130 
change the way they think and they feel
therefore<00:00:14.030> they<00:00:14.300> change<00:00:14.570> the<00:00:14.750> way<00:00:14.840> that<00:00:14.990> they

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:15.140

very<00:00:22.700> often<00:00:22.880> our<00:00:23.180> kids<00:00:23.600> have<00:00:23.869> had<00:00:24.640> negative

usually<00:00:42.890> think<00:00:43.010> of<00:00:43.160> the<00:00:43.220> program<00:00:43.550> as<00:00:43.700> the

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390 
usually think of the program as the

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.290 
usually think of the program as the
first<00:00:44.630> half<00:00:44.930> of<00:00:45.110> it<00:00:45.290> as<00:00:45.940> learning<00:00:46.940> how<00:00:47.270> to

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.300 
first half of it as learning how to

first half of it as learning how to
behave<00:00:47.660> learning<00:00:48.410> learning<00:00:49.100> what's

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:49.360 
behave learning learning what's

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.500 
behave learning learning what's
appropriate<00:00:50.360> to<00:00:50.600> do<00:00:51.370> but<00:00:52.370> but<00:00:52.850> it<00:00:53.180> usually

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
appropriate to do but but it usually

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.990 
appropriate to do but but it usually
takes<00:00:53.750> a<00:00:54.079> second<00:00:55.070> year<00:00:55.219> before<00:00:55.579> a<00:00:55.610> student
