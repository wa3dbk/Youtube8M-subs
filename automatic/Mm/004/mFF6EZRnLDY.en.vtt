00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
and iphone sdk development on what we're

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.259 
and iphone sdk development on what we're
going<00:00:07.140> to<00:00:07.230> be<00:00:07.259> doing<00:00:07.410> is<00:00:07.770> disgusting<00:00:08.610> a<00:00:08.820> random

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
going to be doing is disgusting a random

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.919 
going to be doing is disgusting a random
generator<00:00:10.730> it's<00:00:11.730> called<00:00:11.910> arc<00:00:12.150> for<00:00:12.389> random<00:00:12.719> and

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
generator it's called arc for random and

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.169 
generator it's called arc for random and
what<00:00:13.019> it<00:00:13.139> does<00:00:13.259> is<00:00:13.320> it<00:00:13.620> takes<00:00:14.280> a<00:00:14.549> random<00:00:14.880> number

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
what it does is it takes a random number

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.630 
what it does is it takes a random number
between<00:00:15.330> what<00:00:15.960> you<00:00:16.109> give<00:00:16.289> it<00:00:16.440> so<00:00:16.949> i'll<00:00:17.220> explain

an int whatever so int random number now
we're<00:00:45.000> going<00:00:45.090> to<00:00:45.149> make<00:00:45.329> an<00:00:45.420> IV<00:00:45.719> action<00:00:47.149> call

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
we're going to make an IV action call

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:57.380 
we're going to make an IV action call
choose<00:00:48.750> number<00:00:53.090> okay<00:00:54.920> now<00:00:56.059> go<00:00:57.059> into<00:00:57.239> your

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
choose number okay now go into your

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.590 
choose number okay now go into your
bottom<00:00:57.539> file<00:00:57.989> and<00:00:58.609> I've<00:00:59.609> action<00:01:01.160> hughes

bottom file and I've action hughes

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.560 
bottom file and I've action hughes
number<00:01:04.250> okay<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.460> here's<00:01:05.939> what<00:01:06.210> you<00:01:06.390> need<00:01:06.540> to

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
number okay and here's what you need to

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.640 
number okay and here's what you need to
learn<00:01:07.220> what<00:01:08.220> we're<00:01:08.369> going<00:01:08.460> to<00:01:08.580> do<00:01:08.790> is<00:01:09.409> make<00:01:10.409> it

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
learn what we're going to do is make it

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.060 
learn what we're going to do is make it
pick<00:01:11.010> a<00:01:11.220> random<00:01:11.490> number<00:01:12.000> from<00:01:12.619> one<00:01:13.619> to<00:01:13.650> ten<00:01:14.070> and

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
pick a random number from one to ten and

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.320 
pick a random number from one to ten and
then<00:01:17.070> we're<00:01:17.580> not<00:01:17.880> going<00:01:18.030> to<00:01:18.119> have<00:01:18.210> it

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
then we're not going to have it

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.020 
then we're not going to have it
displayed<00:01:18.830> so<00:01:19.830> why<00:01:20.369> this<00:01:20.430> is<00:01:20.790> really

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
displayed so why this is really

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.420 
displayed so why this is really
important<00:01:21.630> is<00:01:21.810> because<00:01:22.290> it<00:01:22.710> takes<00:01:22.920> a<00:01:23.100> number

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
important is because it takes a number

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.730 
important is because it takes a number
and<00:01:23.640> you<00:01:24.420> can<00:01:24.450> tell<00:01:24.750> to<00:01:24.930> pick<00:01:25.350> whatever<00:01:25.560> you

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
and you can tell to pick whatever you

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.319 
and you can tell to pick whatever you
can<00:01:25.890> have<00:01:26.310> it<00:01:26.460> pick<00:01:26.610> from<00:01:26.759> like<00:01:26.939> 12<00:01:27.650> 101<00:01:29.329> 2052

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
can have it pick from like 12 101 2052

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.710 
can have it pick from like 12 101 2052
20<00:01:31.229> 20<00:01:31.799> to<00:01:31.890> 50<00:01:32.220> whatever<00:01:32.430> you<00:01:32.700> want<00:01:32.909> and<00:01:33.090> why

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
20 20 to 50 whatever you want and why

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.679 
20 20 to 50 whatever you want and why
this<00:01:33.780> is<00:01:34.079> important<00:01:34.590> is<00:01:34.790> for<00:01:35.790> doing<00:01:36.390> random

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
this is important is for doing random

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.179 
this is important is for doing random
stuff<00:01:36.720> like<00:01:37.369> let's<00:01:38.369> say<00:01:38.520> you<00:01:38.909> have<00:01:39.770> like<00:01:40.770> your

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
stuff like let's say you have like your

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.130 
stuff like let's say you have like your
a<00:01:41.400> game<00:01:41.700> where<00:01:42.000> you're<00:01:42.090> moving<00:01:42.299> and<00:01:42.750> you're

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
a game where you're moving and you're

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.319 
a game where you're moving and you're
dodging<00:01:43.350> stuff<00:01:43.950> falling<00:01:44.280> from<00:01:44.340> this<00:01:44.939> screen

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
dodging stuff falling from this screen

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.319 
dodging stuff falling from this screen
you<00:01:45.450> have<00:01:46.380> to<00:01:46.619> do<00:01:46.740> an<00:01:46.890> arc<00:01:47.070> for<00:01:47.280> andum<00:01:47.640> to

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
you have to do an arc for andum to

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.060 
you have to do an arc for andum to
determine<00:01:48.869> where<00:01:49.140> it's<00:01:49.380> going<00:01:49.530> to<00:01:49.590> fall<00:01:49.829> in

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
determine where it's going to fall in

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.600 
determine where it's going to fall in
your<00:01:50.220> x<00:01:50.399> value<00:01:50.960> so<00:01:51.960> now<00:01:52.409> go<00:01:53.060> we<00:01:54.060> called<00:01:54.329> it<00:01:54.509> on

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
your x value so now go we called it on

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.539 
your x value so now go we called it on
we<00:01:56.610> called<00:01:56.880> our<00:01:57.090> into<00:01:57.540> random<00:01:57.840> number<00:01:58.140> so<00:01:59.070> go

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
we called our into random number so go

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:04.710 
we called our into random number so go
random<00:02:00.210> number

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.280 

equals<00:02:06.070> here's<00:02:07.070> what's<00:02:07.280> called<00:02:07.490> arc<00:02:07.790> AR<00:02:08.750> see

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:09.290 
equals here's what's called arc AR see

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:13.030 
equals here's what's called arc AR see
for<00:02:10.100> random<00:02:10.580> to<00:02:11.510> practice<00:02:11.960> of<00:02:12.170> parentheses<00:02:12.800> it

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
for random to practice of parentheses it

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.200 
for random to practice of parentheses it
should<00:02:13.550> fill<00:02:14.240> that<00:02:14.360> in<00:02:14.420> for<00:02:14.510> you<00:02:14.690> and<00:02:14.990> now

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210 
should fill that in for you and now

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:19.830 
should fill that in for you and now
percentage<00:02:17.210> shine<00:02:17.420> which<00:02:17.630> is<00:02:17.780> shift<00:02:18.050> 5<00:02:18.350> and

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
percentage shine which is shift 5 and

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.130 
percentage shine which is shift 5 and
since<00:02:20.840> we're<00:02:20.990> doing<00:02:21.200> 10<00:02:21.470> 10<00:02:22.510> now<00:02:23.510> the<00:02:23.900> thing

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
since we're doing 10 10 now the thing

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.050 
since we're doing 10 10 now the thing
about<00:02:24.170> this<00:02:24.590> is<00:02:24.650> it<00:02:25.070> doesn't<00:02:25.130> go<00:02:25.520> from<00:02:25.730> one<00:02:25.910> to

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
about this is it doesn't go from one to

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.450 
about this is it doesn't go from one to
ten<00:02:26.270> actually<00:02:26.600> goes<00:02:26.690> from<00:02:26.840> 0<00:02:27.200> to<00:02:27.290> 9<00:02:27.620> so<00:02:28.310> we're

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:28.460 
ten actually goes from 0 to 9 so we're

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.790 
ten actually goes from 0 to 9 so we're
going<00:02:28.550> to<00:02:28.640> do<00:02:29.270> plus<00:02:29.660> 1<00:02:29.930> to<00:02:30.140> make<00:02:30.260> it<00:02:30.410> 1<00:02:30.620> through

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 
going to do plus 1 to make it 1 through

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.070 
going to do plus 1 to make it 1 through
10<00:02:30.980> why<00:02:31.760> this<00:02:31.820> works<00:02:32.240> is<00:02:32.450> because<00:02:32.510> it<00:02:32.780> picks<00:02:32.960> a

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
10 why this works is because it picks a

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.699 
10 why this works is because it picks a
number<00:02:33.320> from<00:02:33.470> 0<00:02:33.740> to<00:02:33.860> 9<00:02:34.010> then<00:02:34.550> adds<00:02:34.790> one<00:02:35.230> so<00:02:36.230> cup

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
number from 0 to 9 then adds one so cup

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:39.040 
number from 0 to 9 then adds one so cup
comes<00:02:37.040> one<00:02:37.340> to<00:02:37.459> 10<00:02:37.670> so<00:02:37.970> pick<00:02:38.480> 0<00:02:38.750> it<00:02:38.990> will

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 
comes one to 10 so pick 0 it will

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:40.750 
comes one to 10 so pick 0 it will
actually<00:02:39.230> be<00:02:39.470> one<00:02:39.680> and<00:02:39.980> if<00:02:40.040> it<00:02:40.130> picks<00:02:40.220> 9<00:02:40.520> it

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
actually be one and if it picks 9 it

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.320 
actually be one and if it picks 9 it
will<00:02:40.850> actually<00:02:40.970> be<00:02:41.209> 10<00:02:41.830> so<00:02:42.830> now<00:02:43.550> it's<00:02:43.790> 12<00:02:43.850> 10

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
will actually be 10 so now it's 12 10

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:50.890 
will actually be 10 so now it's 12 10
and<00:02:45.820> now<00:02:46.820> we're<00:02:47.150> going<00:02:47.270> to<00:02:47.330> make<00:02:47.690> it<00:02:48.430> and<00:02:49.900> now

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
and now we're going to make it and now

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.000 
and now we're going to make it and now
we're<00:02:51.050> going<00:02:51.140> to<00:02:51.200> go<00:02:51.440> in<00:02:51.800> and<00:02:51.920> a<00:02:52.010> slog<00:02:53.620> so<00:02:54.620> NS

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
we're going to go in and a slog so NS

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.320 
we're going to go in and a slog so NS
log<00:02:56.170> if<00:02:57.170> you<00:02:57.260> don't<00:02:57.440> know<00:02:57.530> it<00:02:57.620> NS<00:02:57.890> log<00:02:58.100> is<00:02:58.340> it's

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
log if you don't know it NS log is it's

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:04.090 
log if you don't know it NS log is it's
basically<00:02:59.600> like<00:03:00.170> a<00:03:00.350> command<00:03:00.980> prompt<00:03:03.100> it's

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
basically like a command prompt it's

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.070 
basically like a command prompt it's
kind<00:03:04.310> of<00:03:04.400> like<00:03:04.459> terminal<00:03:04.940> I<00:03:05.000> guess<00:03:05.209> and<00:03:05.480> it

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
kind of like terminal I guess and it

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.690 
kind of like terminal I guess and it
just<00:03:06.290> tells<00:03:06.470> you<00:03:06.560> different<00:03:06.830> stuff<00:03:07.010> so<00:03:07.580> we're

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
just tells you different stuff so we're

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.620 
just tells you different stuff so we're
going<00:03:07.820> to<00:03:07.880> have<00:03:08.000> NS<00:03:08.360> log<00:03:09.160> at<00:03:10.160> sign<00:03:10.630> quotation

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
going to have NS log at sign quotation

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.400 
going to have NS log at sign quotation
marks<00:03:12.010> percent<00:03:13.010> I<00:03:13.220> and<00:03:14.209> quotation<00:03:15.170> marks

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
marks percent I and quotation marks

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:19.750 
marks percent I and quotation marks
comma<00:03:16.340> and<00:03:17.110> random<00:03:18.110> number<00:03:18.620> now<00:03:19.340> if<00:03:19.430> this<00:03:19.519> does

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
comma and random number now if this does

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.440 
comma and random number now if this does
is<00:03:20.000> it<00:03:20.180> takes<00:03:21.070> percent<00:03:22.070> I<00:03:22.250> we<00:03:22.760> substitute<00:03:23.269> for

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
is it takes percent I we substitute for

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.150 
is it takes percent I we substitute for
random<00:03:23.750> number<00:03:24.019> so<00:03:24.470> it's<00:03:24.590> going<00:03:24.709> to<00:03:24.769> show<00:03:24.980> us

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
random number so it's going to show us

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.949 
random number so it's going to show us
what<00:03:25.640> random<00:03:26.060> number<00:03:26.330> value<00:03:26.660> is<00:03:27.220> so<00:03:28.220> n<00:03:28.400> that

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 
what random number value is so n that

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:33.580 
what random number value is so n that
and<00:03:29.980> now<00:03:30.980> go<00:03:31.519> into<00:03:31.700> your<00:03:31.850> resources<00:03:32.410> into<00:03:33.410> your

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
and now go into your resources into your

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:46.570 
and now go into your resources into your
view

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:46.580 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:54.770 

okay<00:03:47.420> now<00:03:47.870> add<00:03:48.200> a<00:03:48.260> button

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:59.630 

call<00:03:55.440> it<00:03:55.560> random<00:03:57.560> attach<00:03:58.560> it<00:03:58.770> to<00:03:58.800> choose

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
call it random attach it to choose

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:04.730 
call it random attach it to choose
number<00:03:59.900> save<00:04:00.900> quit<00:04:01.380> and<00:04:02.030> build<00:04:03.030> and<00:04:03.150> run<00:04:03.740> we

number save quit and build and run we

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:10.340 
number save quit and build and run we
shouldn't<00:04:05.069> get<00:04:05.190> any<00:04:05.400> errors<00:04:08.300> okay<00:04:09.300> good<00:04:09.540> now

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:10.350 
shouldn't get any errors okay good now

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:14.720 
shouldn't get any errors okay good now
open<00:04:10.800> and<00:04:11.340> a<00:04:11.700> slog<00:04:12.000> and<00:04:12.330> NS<00:04:12.569> log<00:04:12.780> is<00:04:13.220> right<00:04:14.220> here

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
open and a slog and NS log is right here

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:20.509 
open and a slog and NS log is right here
this<00:04:15.330> um<00:04:15.750> it<00:04:16.530> says<00:04:17.519> gdb<00:04:18.150> on<00:04:18.329> it<00:04:18.510> click<00:04:19.380> it<00:04:19.519> it

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
this um it says gdb on it click it it

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:24.680 
this um it says gdb on it click it it
will<00:04:20.579> open<00:04:20.790> this<00:04:21.560> little<00:04:22.560> blog<00:04:23.010> thing<00:04:23.310> and<00:04:23.690> now

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
will open this little blog thing and now

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:27.610 
will open this little blog thing and now
when<00:04:24.840> you<00:04:24.900> press<00:04:25.080> random<00:04:25.520> you'll<00:04:26.520> see<00:04:26.820> it's

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620 
when you press random you'll see it's

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.130 
when you press random you'll see it's
for<00:04:28.620> and<00:04:28.890> if<00:04:29.669> we<00:04:30.060> keep<00:04:30.210> pressing<00:04:30.630> it<00:04:30.690> will<00:04:30.870> go

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:31.140 
for and if we keep pressing it will go

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:35.409 
for and if we keep pressing it will go
different<00:04:31.620> numbers<00:04:32.100> from<00:04:32.460> one<00:04:32.790> to<00:04:32.820> ten<00:04:33.860> and

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:35.419 
different numbers from one to ten and

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:41.320 
different numbers from one to ten and
that<00:04:36.419> is<00:04:37.310> how<00:04:39.140> you<00:04:40.140> do<00:04:40.290> a<00:04:40.320> random<00:04:40.710> number<00:04:40.980> I

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.330 
that is how you do a random number I

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.600 
that is how you do a random number I
can't<00:04:42.330> even<00:04:42.750> begin<00:04:43.470> to<00:04:43.650> say<00:04:43.800> how<00:04:43.950> important

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
can't even begin to say how important

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.830 
can't even begin to say how important
arc<00:04:44.790> for<00:04:45.030> random<00:04:45.330> is<00:04:45.510> um<00:04:45.720> I<00:04:46.669> use<00:04:47.669> it<00:04:47.850> a<00:04:48.000> lot<00:04:48.300> and

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
arc for random is um I use it a lot and

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.590 
arc for random is um I use it a lot and
it's<00:04:49.650> just<00:04:49.800> really<00:04:49.860> important<00:04:50.430> to<00:04:50.520> know<00:04:50.669> so

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:51.600 
it's just really important to know so

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.159 
it's just really important to know so
