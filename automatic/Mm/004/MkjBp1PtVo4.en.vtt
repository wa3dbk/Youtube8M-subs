which<00:01:13.700> is<00:01:13.940> iron<00:01:14.659> now<00:01:15.140> to<00:01:15.200> craft<00:01:15.500> one<00:01:15.650> of<00:01:15.740> these

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
which is iron now to craft one of these

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.859 
which is iron now to craft one of these
things<00:01:16.100> you<00:01:16.520> need<00:01:16.670> to<00:01:16.700> simply<00:01:17.090> put<00:01:17.270> two<00:01:17.450> ingots

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
things you need to simply put two ingots

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:19.810 
things you need to simply put two ingots
inside<00:01:18.350> the<00:01:18.530> crafting<00:01:18.920> bench<00:01:19.100> or<00:01:19.490> the

when<00:01:38.719> the<00:01:38.840> update<00:01:39.109> is<00:01:39.289> available<00:01:39.729> another

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
when the update is available another

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:42.340 
when the update is available another
reason<00:01:41.030> why<00:01:41.119> this<00:01:41.179> is<00:01:41.420> called<00:01:41.600> light<00:01:41.869> and<00:01:42.170> this

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
reason why this is called light and this

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.380 
reason why this is called light and this
one<00:01:42.500> is<00:01:42.679> called<00:01:42.950> heavy<00:01:43.219> is<00:01:43.520> because<00:01:44.119> it<00:01:44.359> is

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
one is called heavy is because it is

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.389 
one is called heavy is because it is
exactly<00:01:45.079> as<00:01:45.289> it<00:01:45.469> is<00:01:45.560> explained<00:01:46.039> so<00:01:46.219> another

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
for size time set night it is a little

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:51.310 
for size time set night it is a little
bit<00:01:49.100> easier<00:01:49.249> to<00:01:49.490> explain<00:01:49.999> how<00:01:50.630> this<00:01:50.810> works<00:01:51.079> in

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
bit easier to explain how this works in

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.649 
bit easier to explain how this works in
nighttime<00:01:51.890> now<00:01:52.850> i'm<00:01:53.119> just<00:01:53.210> going<00:01:53.390> to<00:01:53.420> grab<00:01:53.570> a

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 
nighttime now i'm just going to grab a

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:54.969 
nighttime now i'm just going to grab a
whole<00:01:53.929> bunch<00:01:54.109> of<00:01:54.229> blocks<00:01:54.439> here<00:01:54.740> i'm<00:01:54.859> gonna

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
whole bunch of blocks here i'm gonna

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:59.739 
whole bunch of blocks here i'm gonna
grab<00:01:55.100> 64<00:01:55.869> 64<00:01:56.869> and<00:01:57.560> 64<00:01:58.299> the<00:01:59.299> cool<00:01:59.479> thing<00:01:59.509> while

00:01:59.739 --> 00:01:59.749 
grab 64 64 and 64 the cool thing while

00:01:59.749 --> 00:02:01.929 
grab 64 64 and 64 the cool thing while
this<00:01:59.899> is<00:02:00.140> if<00:02:00.979> it's<00:02:01.159> linked<00:02:01.369> at<00:02:01.429> the<00:02:01.520> redstone

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:01.939 
this is if it's linked at the redstone

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:03.819 
this is if it's linked at the redstone
whether<00:02:02.179> it<00:02:02.270> be<00:02:02.390> a<00:02:02.420> redstone<00:02:02.810> torch<00:02:02.929> redstone

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:03.829 
whether it be a redstone torch redstone

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:05.469 
whether it be a redstone torch redstone
torch<00:02:04.130> it<00:02:04.310> can<00:02:04.429> be<00:02:04.520> absolutely<00:02:04.670> anything<00:02:05.210> if

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
torch it can be absolutely anything if

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:07.809 
torch it can be absolutely anything if
I'm<00:02:05.630> to<00:02:05.749> throw<00:02:05.990> say<00:02:06.380> one<00:02:06.679> it<00:02:07.159> will<00:02:07.399> light<00:02:07.609> up

00:02:07.809 --> 00:02:07.819 
I'm to throw say one it will light up

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:10.090 
I'm to throw say one it will light up
one<00:02:08.030> rep<00:02:08.270> one<00:02:08.539> redstone<00:02:08.780> signal<00:02:09.200> signal<00:02:09.950> on

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.100 
one rep one redstone signal signal on

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.760 
one rep one redstone signal signal on
both<00:02:10.340> types<00:02:10.670> so<00:02:10.940> if<00:02:11.030> I<00:02:11.150> go<00:02:11.180> to<00:02:11.360> Q<00:02:11.900> again<00:02:12.020> you<00:02:12.560> can

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
both types so if I go to Q again you can

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.950 
both types so if I go to Q again you can
see<00:02:12.800> that<00:02:13.010> they<00:02:13.190> are<00:02:13.220> lit<00:02:13.670> up<00:02:13.850> by<00:02:14.030> both<00:02:14.300> well

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:14.960 
see that they are lit up by both well

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.480 
see that they are lit up by both well
the<00:02:15.260> cool<00:02:15.410> thing<00:02:15.470> about<00:02:15.710> the<00:02:15.980> actual<00:02:16.220> light

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
the cool thing about the actual light

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.910 
the cool thing about the actual light
one<00:02:16.730> which<00:02:17.000> is<00:02:17.180> the<00:02:17.360> gold<00:02:17.870> one<00:02:18.080> is<00:02:18.260> this<00:02:18.770> will

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
one which is the gold one is this will

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.250 
one which is the gold one is this will
light<00:02:19.100> up<00:02:19.280> every<00:02:19.460> single<00:02:20.060> four<00:02:20.510> block<00:02:20.810> so<00:02:21.080> if<00:02:21.170> I

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
light up every single four block so if I

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.199 
light up every single four block so if I
perform<00:02:21.470> more<00:02:21.860> on<00:02:21.980> there<00:02:22.190> you<00:02:22.640> can<00:02:22.790> see<00:02:22.819> it

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
perform more on there you can see it

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:26.140 
perform more on there you can see it
light<00:02:23.629> up<00:02:23.659> when<00:02:24.260> was<00:02:24.470> it<00:02:24.500> I<00:02:24.860> think<00:02:25.549> it<00:02:25.640> is<00:02:25.760> let's

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
light up when was it I think it is let's

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.150 
light up when was it I think it is let's
just<00:02:26.330> try<00:02:26.450> it<00:02:26.480> one<00:02:26.690> two<00:02:26.870> three<00:02:27.080> four

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
just try it one two three four

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.950 
just try it one two three four
as<00:02:28.220> you<00:02:28.310> can<00:02:28.430> see<00:02:28.610> it<00:02:28.730> lights<00:02:28.910> up<00:02:29.090> there<00:02:29.360> but

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:29.960 
as you can see it lights up there but

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:30.910 
as you can see it lights up there but
these<00:02:30.080> are<00:02:30.200> combinate<00:02:30.560> these<00:02:30.680> are<00:02:30.830> like

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
these are combinate these are like

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.100 
these are combinate these are like
combining<00:02:31.460> together<00:02:31.820> you<00:02:32.600> see<00:02:32.810> for<00:02:33.020> example

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
combining together you see for example

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.760 
combining together you see for example
if<00:02:33.620> I'm<00:02:33.770> to<00:02:33.890> just<00:02:34.100> do<00:02:34.930> one<00:02:35.930> of<00:02:35.960> them<00:02:36.170> there<00:02:36.530> and

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
if I'm to just do one of them there and

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:39.240 
if I'm to just do one of them there and
then<00:02:37.280> if<00:02:37.430> I<00:02:37.520> grab<00:02:37.730> say<00:02:38.030> one<00:02:38.300> two<00:02:38.330> three<00:02:38.810> four

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
then if I grab say one two three four

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.040 
then if I grab say one two three four
1234<00:02:40.390> to<00:02:41.390> try<00:02:41.600> this<00:02:41.660> and<00:02:42.590> then<00:02:42.710> we<00:02:42.830> go<00:02:43.040> like

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050 
1234 to try this and then we go like

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:47.740 
1234 to try this and then we go like
this<00:02:45.160> but<00:02:46.160> we<00:02:46.340> missed<00:02:46.580> it<00:02:46.790> how<00:02:47.300> we<00:02:47.360> failed

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
this but we missed it how we failed

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.230 
this but we missed it how we failed
again<00:02:47.990> this<00:02:48.770> is<00:02:48.950> hard<00:02:49.160> you<00:02:49.340> see<00:02:49.490> you<00:02:49.550> guys<00:02:49.700> we

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:50.240 
again this is hard you see you guys we

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.420 
again this is hard you see you guys we
put<00:02:50.390> one<00:02:50.540> of<00:02:50.660> them<00:02:50.720> on<00:02:50.780> there<00:02:51.170> I<00:02:51.350> mean<00:02:51.920> we<00:02:52.190> throw

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
put one of them on there I mean we throw

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.000 
put one of them on there I mean we throw
this<00:02:52.610> out<00:02:52.790> and<00:02:53.060> put<00:02:53.180> four<00:02:53.660> on<00:02:53.690> there<00:02:54.080> it<00:02:54.770> will

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
this out and put four on there it will

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.400 
this out and put four on there it will
go<00:02:55.190> to<00:02:55.220> the<00:02:55.490> second<00:02:55.910> signal<00:02:56.330> now<00:02:56.780> this<00:02:56.990> goes<00:02:57.200> up

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
go to the second signal now this goes up

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.560 
go to the second signal now this goes up
every<00:02:57.740> single<00:02:58.070> four<00:02:58.490> blocks<00:02:58.820> which<00:02:59.210> is<00:02:59.360> really

00:02:59.560 --> 00:02:59.570 
every single four blocks which is really

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:01.360 
every single four blocks which is really
really<00:02:59.750> useful<00:03:00.020> so<00:03:00.500> again<00:03:00.830> in<00:03:01.010> each<00:03:01.130> grab

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
really useful so again in each grab

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.330 
really useful so again in each grab
another<00:03:01.970> four<00:03:02.270> blocks<00:03:02.570> if<00:03:02.780> it<00:03:02.870> works<00:03:03.190> as<00:03:04.190> you

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
another four blocks if it works as you

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:05.920 
another four blocks if it works as you
can<00:03:04.460> see<00:03:04.640> that<00:03:04.670> it's<00:03:04.970> gone<00:03:05.120> up<00:03:05.180> for<00:03:05.540> but<00:03:05.810> the

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
can see that it's gone up for but the

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.360 
can see that it's gone up for but the
combined<00:03:06.530> together<00:03:06.680> so<00:03:07.040> need<00:03:07.190> to<00:03:07.280> get

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
combined together so need to get

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:12.540 
combined together so need to get
different<00:03:07.520> types<00:03:07.880> of<00:03:08.090> an<00:03:08.710> blocks<00:03:09.710> 1234<00:03:10.690> 1234

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.550 
different types of an blocks 1234 1234

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:15.370 
different types of an blocks 1234 1234
1234<00:03:13.550> let's<00:03:14.300> see<00:03:14.390> if<00:03:14.450> this<00:03:14.540> works<00:03:14.750> again<00:03:15.170> so

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
1234 let's see if this works again so

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:16.540 
1234 let's see if this works again so
we've<00:03:15.530> got<00:03:15.710> I<00:03:15.740> don't<00:03:15.920> want<00:03:16.040> to<00:03:16.100> grab<00:03:16.310> any<00:03:16.490> of

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:16.550 
we've got I don't want to grab any of

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:20.500 
we've got I don't want to grab any of
them<00:03:16.670> let's<00:03:17.600> just<00:03:17.630> do<00:03:17.870> this<00:03:19.210> well<00:03:20.210> I<00:03:20.240> think

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
them let's just do this well I think

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.060 
them let's just do this well I think
it's<00:03:20.750> on<00:03:20.840> it<00:03:20.960> yes<00:03:21.080> it<00:03:21.230> is<00:03:21.350> it's<00:03:21.530> gone<00:03:21.680> up<00:03:21.710> again

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:22.070 
it's on it yes it is it's gone up again

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:24.370 
it's on it yes it is it's gone up again
no<00:03:22.190> it<00:03:22.310> hasn't<00:03:22.640> we've<00:03:22.730> missed<00:03:22.970> darn<00:03:23.660> it<00:03:23.780> one

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 
no it hasn't we've missed darn it one

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.650 
no it hasn't we've missed darn it one
two<00:03:24.530> three<00:03:24.770> four<00:03:25.010> I<00:03:25.310> think<00:03:26.150> we<00:03:26.210> missed<00:03:26.360> it<00:03:26.570> now

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
two three four I think we missed it now

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.950 
two three four I think we missed it now
we've<00:03:26.810> made<00:03:26.990> it<00:03:27.200> one<00:03:28.100> two<00:03:28.280> three<00:03:28.490> four<00:03:28.780> we<00:03:29.780> want

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:29.960 
we've made it one two three four we want

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
to this one and we need to grab some

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.280 
to this one and we need to grab some
more<00:03:31.490> sets<00:03:31.790> just<00:03:31.940> grab<00:03:32.150> one<00:03:32.390> two<00:03:32.600> three<00:03:32.930> four

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
more sets just grab one two three four

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:36.310 
more sets just grab one two three four
of<00:03:33.590> them<00:03:33.620> one<00:03:33.880> two<00:03:34.880> three<00:03:35.090> four<00:03:35.360> as<00:03:35.990> you<00:03:36.200> can

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:36.320 
of them one two three four as you can

of them one two three four as you can
see<00:03:36.560> we<00:03:36.860> finally<00:03:37.250> got<00:03:37.400> to<00:03:37.550> the<00:03:37.580> redstone<00:03:38.090> torch

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
see we finally got to the redstone torch

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:40.900 
see we finally got to the redstone torch
which<00:03:38.690> is<00:03:38.959> pretty<00:03:39.290> cool<00:03:39.590> and<00:03:39.980> obviously<00:03:40.520> this

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
which is pretty cool and obviously this

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:42.070 
which is pretty cool and obviously this
signal<00:03:41.330> you're<00:03:41.570> gonna<00:03:41.690> have<00:03:41.870> to<00:03:41.990> have

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.080 
signal you're gonna have to have

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.480 
signal you're gonna have to have
different<00:03:42.440> types<00:03:42.560> of<00:03:42.770> things<00:03:43.040> and<00:03:43.280> in<00:03:43.370> the

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:43.490 
different types of things and in the

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:45.130 
different types of things and in the
image<00:03:43.700> voice<00:03:44.000> use<00:03:44.209> through<00:03:44.570> a<00:03:44.600> lot<00:03:44.810> of<00:03:44.930> things

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
image voice use through a lot of things

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.410 
image voice use through a lot of things
on<00:03:45.380> theirs<00:03:45.590> but<00:03:46.520> it<00:03:46.700> looks<00:03:46.880> really<00:03:47.209> really

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.420 
on theirs but it looks really really

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.480 
on theirs but it looks really really
cool<00:03:47.450> but<00:03:47.900> did<00:03:48.500> a<00:03:48.530> difference<00:03:48.980> between<00:03:49.340> this

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:49.490 
cool but did a difference between this

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:52.570 
cool but did a difference between this
one<00:03:49.730> and<00:03:49.790> this<00:03:50.420> one<00:03:50.480> is<00:03:50.930> you<00:03:51.590> need<00:03:51.830> to<00:03:52.010> have<00:03:52.250> a

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:52.580 
one and this one is you need to have a

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:55.090 
one and this one is you need to have a
lot<00:03:52.970> of<00:03:53.000> blocks<00:03:53.450> on<00:03:53.720> this<00:03:54.050> pressure<00:03:54.560> plate<00:03:54.920> so

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:55.100 
lot of blocks on this pressure plate so

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:56.290 
lot of blocks on this pressure plate so
this<00:03:55.220> isn't<00:03:55.459> really<00:03:55.490> something<00:03:55.790> you<00:03:56.030> want<00:03:56.240> to

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:56.300 
this isn't really something you want to

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:58.990 
this isn't really something you want to
be<00:03:56.360> using<00:03:56.600> for<00:03:57.080> a<00:03:57.680> trap<00:03:58.010> or<00:03:58.160> anything<00:03:58.550> so<00:03:58.730> I'm

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
be using for a trap or anything so I'm

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.580 
be using for a trap or anything so I'm
just<00:03:59.239> going<00:03:59.360> to<00:03:59.420> literally<00:03:59.660> grab<00:03:59.870> stacks<00:04:00.380> and

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
just going to literally grab stacks and

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:02.500 
just going to literally grab stacks and
stacks<00:04:00.650> of<00:04:01.070> these<00:04:01.250> in<00:04:01.459> place<00:04:01.580> on<00:04:01.910> top<00:04:02.180> of<00:04:02.330> there

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
stacks of these in place on top of there

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:06.699 
stacks of these in place on top of there
I<00:04:02.720> do<00:04:03.260> believe<00:04:03.650> it<00:04:04.160> is<00:04:04.220> exactly<00:04:05.030> every<00:04:05.810> 43rd

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:06.709 
I do believe it is exactly every 43rd

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:09.400 
I do believe it is exactly every 43rd
I'm<00:04:07.070> pretty<00:04:07.820> sure<00:04:08.090> it<00:04:08.270> is<00:04:08.420> I<00:04:08.660> will<00:04:09.260> have<00:04:09.320> a<00:04:09.380> link

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:09.410 
I'm pretty sure it is I will have a link

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:10.990 
I'm pretty sure it is I will have a link

to check it out as well but I'm just
gonna<00:04:12.020> get<00:04:12.140> stacks<00:04:12.440> and<00:04:12.650> stacks<00:04:12.709> of<00:04:13.040> this<00:04:13.190> and

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 
gonna get stacks and stacks of this and

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.190 
gonna get stacks and stacks of this and
see<00:04:13.580> how<00:04:13.700> many<00:04:13.760> it<00:04:13.940> does<00:04:14.090> take<00:04:14.300> you<00:04:14.810> can<00:04:14.989> see

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:15.200 
see how many it does take you can see

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.590 
see how many it does take you can see
how<00:04:15.320> many<00:04:15.350> we<00:04:15.560> are<00:04:15.770> doing<00:04:16.270> let's<00:04:17.270> just<00:04:17.419> grab

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:17.600

one we are just about on the second one
we're<00:04:22.220> gonna<00:04:22.310> be<00:04:22.490> here<00:04:22.700> a<00:04:22.730> very<00:04:23.210> very<00:04:23.540> long

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.750 
we're gonna be here a very very long

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:25.659 
we're gonna be here a very very long
time<00:04:23.810> you<00:04:24.380> can<00:04:24.530> grab<00:04:24.680> stacks<00:04:25.040> and<00:04:25.250> stacks<00:04:25.310> of

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:25.669 
time you can grab stacks and stacks of

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:27.460 
time you can grab stacks and stacks of
different<00:04:26.060> types<00:04:26.270> as<00:04:26.510> well<00:04:26.540> so<00:04:26.900> I<00:04:27.110> want<00:04:27.410> to

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470 
different types as well so I want to

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.170 
different types as well so I want to
generally<00:04:27.860> see<00:04:28.100> how<00:04:28.340> long<00:04:28.520> it<00:04:28.669> takes<00:04:28.700> for<00:04:29.060> me

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
generally see how long it takes for me

generally see how long it takes for me
to<00:04:29.210> like<00:04:29.480> this<00:04:29.660> off<00:04:29.870> and<00:04:30.730> we<00:04:31.730> go<00:04:32.020> there<00:04:33.020> we<00:04:33.050> go

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
to like this off and we go there we go

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:37.870 
to like this off and we go there we go
there<00:04:33.700> we<00:04:34.700> go<00:04:34.900> any<00:04:35.900> closer<00:04:36.140> we<00:04:36.919> are<00:04:37.039> now<00:04:37.190> on<00:04:37.430> the

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:37.880 
there we go any closer we are now on the

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.760 
there we go any closer we are now on the
third<00:04:38.180> one<00:04:38.450> it's<00:04:38.690> gone<00:04:38.900> off<00:04:39.140> on<00:04:39.169> this<00:04:39.560> one's

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:39.770 
third one it's gone off on this one's

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:41.290 
third one it's gone off on this one's
gone<00:04:39.950> off<00:04:40.100> we're<00:04:40.340> getting<00:04:40.610> closer<00:04:40.880> there<00:04:41.210> is

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300 
gone off we're getting closer there is

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.800 
gone off we're getting closer there is
low

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:41.810 
low

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:43.180 
low
and<00:04:42.020> loads<00:04:42.169> of<00:04:42.320> blocks<00:04:42.560> that<00:04:42.740> we<00:04:42.860> need<00:04:43.040> for

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:43.190 
and loads of blocks that we need for

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:45.700 
and loads of blocks that we need for
this<00:04:43.310> one<00:04:43.480> lots<00:04:44.480> and<00:04:44.780> lots<00:04:45.020> of<00:04:45.320> different

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:45.710 
this one lots and lots of different

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:49.270 
this one lots and lots of different
blocks<00:04:46.090> let's<00:04:47.090> just<00:04:47.240> keep<00:04:47.389> going<00:04:48.280> hopefully

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 
blocks let's just keep going hopefully

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.670 
blocks let's just keep going hopefully
it<00:04:49.340> doesn't<00:04:49.490> crash<00:04:49.760> my<00:04:49.970> game<00:04:50.320> not<00:04:51.320> a<00:04:51.350> blocks

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 
it doesn't crash my game not a blocks

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.800 
it doesn't crash my game not a blocks
that<00:04:51.830> we<00:04:51.950> are<00:04:52.070> using<00:04:52.280> we<00:04:53.060> are<00:04:53.210> still<00:04:53.660> on<00:04:53.690> a

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:53.810 
that we are using we are still on a

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:55.900 
that we are using we are still on a
third<00:04:54.080> one<00:04:54.200> for<00:04:54.380> example<00:04:54.860> you<00:04:55.370> can<00:04:55.520> i'm<00:04:55.700> just

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:55.910 
third one for example you can i'm just

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:57.400 
third one for example you can i'm just
going<00:04:56.030> to<00:04:56.060> break<00:04:56.300> this<00:04:56.510> because<00:04:56.990> we're<00:04:57.290> going

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:57.410 
going to break this because we're going

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:58.990 
going to break this because we're going
to<00:04:57.470> be<00:04:57.560> there<00:04:57.740> a<00:04:57.770> very<00:04:58.160> very<00:04:58.400> long<00:04:58.610> time<00:04:58.669> in

00:04:58.990 --> 00:04:59.000 
to be there a very very long time in

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.879 
to be there a very very long time in
fact<00:04:59.030> i'm<00:04:59.630> gonna<00:04:59.810> grab<00:04:59.930> some<00:05:00.230> redstone<00:05:00.440> real

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:43.910 
this I'm sure you guys get how it works

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:47.230 
this I'm sure you guys get how it works
anyway<00:05:45.700> yeah<00:05:46.700> it's<00:05:46.880> not<00:05:47.000> going<00:05:47.090> to<00:05:47.180> work

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:47.240 
anyway yeah it's not going to work

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:48.969 
anyway yeah it's not going to work
because<00:05:47.300> we<00:05:47.630> broke<00:05:47.750> it<00:05:48.020> but<00:05:48.380> guys<00:05:48.530> you<00:05:48.560> see<00:05:48.860> how

00:05:48.969 --> 00:05:48.979 
because we broke it but guys you see how

00:05:48.979 --> 00:05:50.770 
because we broke it but guys you see how
it<00:05:49.130> works<00:05:49.340> you<00:05:49.580> can<00:05:49.729> see<00:05:50.000> that<00:05:50.210> the<00:05:50.419> absolute

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:50.780 
it works you can see that the absolute

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:52.779 
it works you can see that the absolute
complete<00:05:50.930> difference<00:05:51.800> the<00:05:52.400> set<00:05:52.610> at<00:05:52.700> the

00:05:52.779 --> 00:05:52.789 
complete difference the set at the

00:05:52.789 --> 00:05:54.760 
complete difference the set at the
daytime<00:05:53.180> just<00:05:53.810> to<00:05:53.900> complete<00:05:54.200> this<00:05:54.440> and<00:05:54.680> then

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:54.770 
daytime just to complete this and then

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:56.020 
daytime just to complete this and then
the<00:05:54.830> ground<00:05:55.010> looking<00:05:55.310> the<00:05:55.430> items<00:05:55.760> that<00:05:55.940> we

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:56.030 
the ground looking the items that we

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:58.600 
the ground looking the items that we
grabbed<00:05:56.240> we<00:05:56.479> grabbed<00:05:56.840> will<00:05:57.770> that's<00:05:58.220> how<00:05:58.370> many

00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:58.610 
grabbed we grabbed will that's how many

00:05:58.610 --> 00:05:59.980 
grabbed we grabbed will that's how many
so<00:05:58.820> you<00:05:59.180> can<00:05:59.330> see<00:05:59.450> the<00:05:59.539> difference<00:05:59.840> between

00:05:59.980 --> 00:05:59.990 
so you can see the difference between

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:02.380 
so you can see the difference between
this<00:06:00.440> and<00:06:00.500> this<00:06:01.220> this<00:06:01.550> is<00:06:01.669> the<00:06:01.789> light<00:06:01.940> one<00:06:02.120> this

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:02.390 
this and this this is the light one this

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:04.150 
this and this this is the light one this
is<00:06:02.510> the<00:06:02.600> heavy<00:06:02.780> one<00:06:03.050> I<00:06:03.260> suggest<00:06:03.830> using<00:06:03.950> this

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:04.160 
is the heavy one I suggest using this

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:05.980 
is the heavy one I suggest using this
whether<00:06:04.430> it<00:06:04.580> be<00:06:04.729> just<00:06:04.940> for<00:06:05.210> a<00:06:05.240> mess<00:06:05.810> around

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:05.990 
whether it be just for a mess around

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:07.450 
whether it be just for a mess around
type<00:06:06.350> of<00:06:06.470> thing<00:06:06.620> but<00:06:06.800> this<00:06:06.950> could<00:06:07.130> be<00:06:07.190> used<00:06:07.370> for

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:07.460 
type of thing but this could be used for

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:09.340 
type of thing but this could be used for
like<00:06:07.789> a<00:06:07.820> trap<00:06:08.120> door<00:06:08.360> it<00:06:08.690> could<00:06:08.840> be<00:06:08.930> used<00:06:09.110> like<00:06:09.320> a

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:09.350

like a trap door it could be used like a
secret<00:06:09.890> room<00:06:10.070> and<00:06:10.460> this<00:06:11.360> one<00:06:11.600> requires<00:06:11.900> a<00:06:12.260> lot
