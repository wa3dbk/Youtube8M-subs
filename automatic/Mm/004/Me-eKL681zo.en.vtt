00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:10.679
 so would welcome back and I 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.599
 would like to join me a bit today 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.490
 deal with the topic 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.379
 what can i do at work or in the office 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.570
 eat in between meals that is 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.310
 everything goes already the theme snacks yes 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.990
 and of course that is very important to me 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.869
 important that things are the one 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.880
 really very fast food fight 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.320
 because of course if you can 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.359
 now has a job if you do not have a big one 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.880
 Break has yes or just like that 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.980
 in between times something to eat 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.780
 yes just have time has no time is 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.100
 also easy for the school, of course 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.450
 no time has come to 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.980
 put ten minutes in peace 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.649
 to polish off any large meal 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.480
 that's why I mean top 3 times 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:50.690
 the snacks yes you definitely 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:54.270
 loose within a maximum of 30 seconds 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:56.010
 yes, yes, and of course 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.370
 help accordingly 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.140
 so to realize your goals so on 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.229
 number one is clearly the fastest 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.119
 possibility of course we shakes now 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.140
 of course the shakes designed their 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.390
 by your cause and of course depends 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.710
 From what you have as the check 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.560
 yes, the simplest variant is 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:16.049
 just protein shakes so buy yourself 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.049
 some powder and here of course completely 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.970
 clearly the big advantage and one of the 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.220
 few things where you really say 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.720
 can ok here we have supplement on 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.750
 every case a very very good purpose 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.610
 and fulfill a very good sense 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.860
 namely fact that you can find them everywhere 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.079
 can take along very fast and yes 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.610
 can quickly displace the 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.259
 simple variant as I said why the 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.600
 protein shake just a lot depending on that 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.610
 Powder you need a lot of white you need 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.710
 into the shake and then has 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.240
 you can do that within 20 seconds too 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.579
 if it's half a liter 30 seconds 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.090
 Of course, you can suppress that 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.869
 accordingly with other nutrients 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.430
 spice it up like for example when 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.040
 carbohydrates are needed 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:59.189
 for example oatmeal or rice flakes 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.320
 if you need healthy fat 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:05.070
 you can dump any oils pure 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:10.890
 Or los moss or almonds must et 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:13.270
 Cetera as a second must have nuts 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.910
 are not all that good 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.320
 protein and carbohydrates suppliers 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.090
 but of course us, the 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.500
 most important for the next four years 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:24.060
 heaps of healthy fat you have through 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:28.230
 Nuts can be peanuts with a few nuts 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:30.970
 eat macadamia nuts or walnuts 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.680
 the big advantage over to send 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.150
 of course she is still small she can 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.800
 take it everywhere Hans can do it 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.170
 example of the pants pocket have one 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.730
 handful nuts and is even 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.790
 even faster swallows yes , too 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.640
 no one is so with everywhere and also 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:50.310
 real quick 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:53.020
 otherwise as number three fruit for me 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.700
 Fruit is naturally so you have one 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:57.610
 Of course, not the complete one 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.200
 macro nutrient needs from the cover 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.420
 that means it goes here of course 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.910
 Of course, to vitamins very clearly and 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.830
 Of course you can also use carbohydrates 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.970
 Of course it can be that everywhere 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:10.300
 not so and not so fast 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:13.720
 of course at the check or at the 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:15.040
 peanuts but as between lay first 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:19.540
 in between, yes, it is also very 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:21.730
 Quick with the fruit and then you should too 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.200
 good last yes yes the classic now 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:27.730
 Of course, for people who attend school 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:28.900
 go break bread so many questions 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.970
 always so yes i go to school what you guys 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.340
 eat in between quite normal 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.630
 break bread you have carbohydrates one 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:38.200
 of course, no bread has to be taken now 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:40.990
 can also take wholegrain bread and then 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.640
 You can also paint with something 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:44.290
 no idea with butter butter is also 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.680
 quite healthy even today not afraid to 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.270
 to have 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:49.240
 and of course you can get the protein 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:51.010
 different coverings take as to 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:52.390
 example of course turkey breast plaque or 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.130
 Chicken breasts and so on 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:58.510
 Classic salami really a bit 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:59.890
 Of course, fat is enough depending on what 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:02.530
 one would like to have in which phase one 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:04.450
 Although something like four tips to tell the 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.890
 best tips yes so much better 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:07.720
 you do not get it easy 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:09.730
 in between at work or in the 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.709
 school very quickly expensive 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:13.900
 can still hold nutrition plan yes 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:15.220
 and what does not trouble you 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.359
 because he says yes I can now 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.830
 not somehow or I can now 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:19.330
 not somehow in school or on 

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:23.229
 work because somehow much stress 

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:25.120
 is there to unpack the box then start 

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:25.970
 so enjoyable for ten minutes in front of me 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.220
 to eat 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:31.310
 and the said things are really going 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:33.200
 quite fast, yes, quite so 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:35.180
 classic yes yes I have to say it all 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:36.620
 great if stairs two minutes in the thing 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:39.050
 on the way down with it 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.700
 finished accordingly you have now 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.290
 no longer the excuse that you say 

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:44.450
 I do not know now or I can 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:46.160
 can not hold because in school 

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:47.540
 or at work now has to 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.670
 already through work and I have none 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:51.920
 It was time to eat in between 

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:54.290
 Pronounce that is a perfect possible 

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:55.520
 which can solve completely and I hope so 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:57.080
 could you in that regard 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.780
 a little further help you a few 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.590
 new ideas still give a whole thing 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.970
 I just remember 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:04.160
 I 'm not aware of it now 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:05.540
 You have to eat so many nuts 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.310
 or would have to eat so many fruits 

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:12.080
 or you have to be in the chic so much 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:14.900
 powder so much oatmeal or so much 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.770
 Tipping in oil purely because the whole thing through very 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:17.510
 individually 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:19.400
 I have already made a video 

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:21.620
 if it does not know you are looking for 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:24.500
 I can eat this sixpack and have it there 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:26.180
 I explained it why all right 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:27.680
 individual and why not say 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:28.880
 can you have to eat so and so much now 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:33.460
 and eat so much 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:33.460
 okay that's it of me please not
