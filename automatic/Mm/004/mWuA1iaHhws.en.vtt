00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:07.410
 very short summary of a second 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.929
 Yesterday at the beta it has again 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.580
 a lot of fun I am now such a 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.040
 a little bit more detail 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.529
 I have to really fascinate myself 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:20.430
 the bar 

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:22.260
 he is really cool and cool 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.449
 still the favorite one 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.990
 Great, I have only a few yesterday 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.460
 hours played in kreuzritter 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.040
 again today to try today 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.760
 at least to bring 70 what you 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:38.250
 Remember the Crusader is absolutely okay 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:40.680
 So there has some skills are just 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.300
 completely ok and you can tell now even if 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.590
 it goes into fine-tuning now or so 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.149
 if you are a bit deeper now 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.640
 get in that's really one more 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.940
 beta is and you are too careful here 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.140
 it must be a beta here 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.480
 The game is not amazing 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.789
 crashed so hardly grow few 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:00.719
 small but I think from looked 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:03.390
 but to fix myself fast, I am something 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.589
 still a lot of work for me 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.330
 blizzard I think that's it 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.939
 balancing and fine tuning 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.890
 yes because there are many things that are 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.040
 no longer lenz for example in 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.060
 skill that is verbuggt when 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.689
 crusader with whom you can do everything when 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.650
 shadow 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:21.659
 Then there are combinations with cool down 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.970
 reduction that I believe are too blatant 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.009
 there are fixe on some levent eris the 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:30.869
 too violent are just an example 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:34.020
 there is a belt of interpane therefore 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.430
 An important thing is to buy a minute 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.729
 So extended which means you can to 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.380
 always have and thereby get power 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.200
 you actually do no harm more than 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:47.490
 bap and it actually invulnerable and 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:49.229
 yes so things but you have to with the whole 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.740
 really enjoy with caution for it 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:55.079
 a beta is not a finished game 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.719
 Some people forget that one is yes 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:59.250
 also often inclined when the game 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.869
 already so worked great then 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.880
 so yes it will be then 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.579
 that certainly is not the case 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.409
 the beta is just there and that 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:09.899
 you realize that you hold such things 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:13.310
 now tried out and finds out 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:15.890
 and not exactly what 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:18.560
 diablo 3 louis was that only the 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.840
 could play first eight and thereby 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.430
 then completely removed balance staff 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.560
 not mature at all 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.930
 in the display I think blizzard yemen 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.720
 prevent and I see that too 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:32.120
 I am absolutely great and I think so 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:35.000
 we all have to patience a bit 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:37.880
 also have with the items and what is there 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.819
 I will show you shortly 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.470
 I hope the servers are 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:43.640
 partly a bit overloaded though 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.799
 Not so many people are 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:50.630
 but play the people who have the key 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:52.250
 they play a lot and in general I have to 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.170
 really say that makes a lot of fun 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.549
 and I was just a bit yesterday 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.430
 come up with some ideas 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:03:00.200
 There is much more depth in the game 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.120
 just by not having it anymore 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.730
 only three important offensives always exist 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.230
 but six yes we have here today 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.769
 yesterday bit uncut crushing 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:11.239
 just splash damage and combination cool 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:12.620
 down reduction so you can get a lot 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:14.810
 things make you see my beard too 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:17.450
 is now much better again 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:21.350
 11 million erp and that although I 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:24.170
 I got a stone from Jordan in there 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:26.630
 Really cool items I found posting 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.519
 I link in the video below one 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:31.040
 Compilation of a kirst has it 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:32.840
 someone screenshot very nice shows up 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.980
 here for a moment it's really cool 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.380
 today I will be a little bit more 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:41.540
 Find out what else you can do 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:43.280
 on construction and the crusader continue to play 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.139
 and now I would like to continue 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.760
 is consistent was also yesterday with Maria 

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:47.090
 You can look at Ari up 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.340
 de 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.410
 it's really been a supercars 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.329
 for me also a bit more profound 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:54.560
 gone into more detail than I did 

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:58.190
 so now if that's what you do 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.440
 interested listen or see him 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:05.269
 on 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:09.139
 and yes that could be me too 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:10.850
 will see today stream tv shows on 420 

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:15.170
 that some have asked at youtube 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:16.820
 again my stream url s and tomorrow 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:18.970
 there's the next summary power 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.970
 Well
