so<00:00:00.179> just<00:00:00.390> remember<00:00:00.570> here<00:00:01.020> that<00:00:01.890> there's

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.250 
so just remember here that there's

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.400 
so just remember here that there's
inactive<00:00:02.970> rains<00:00:03.210> and<00:00:03.480> active<00:00:03.870> rains<00:00:04.110> so<00:00:04.259> like

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 
inactive rains and active rains so like

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.490 
inactive rains and active rains so like
for<00:00:04.560> example<00:00:04.650> here<00:00:05.160> if<00:00:05.670> I<00:00:05.850> want<00:00:06.150> to<00:00:06.240> use<00:00:06.600> the

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
for example here if I want to use the

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.830 
for example here if I want to use the
indirect<00:00:08.010> rain<00:00:08.250> I'm<00:00:08.670> doing<00:00:09.420> I'm<00:00:09.599> doing

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
indirect rain I'm doing I'm doing

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.160 
indirect rain I'm doing I'm doing
something<00:00:10.110> active<00:00:10.590> in<00:00:10.740> my<00:00:10.889> seat<00:00:11.190> okay<00:00:12.150> as<00:00:12.360> I'm

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
something active in my seat okay as I'm

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.790 
something active in my seat okay as I'm
turning<00:00:13.410> what<00:00:13.799> my<00:00:14.730> right<00:00:15.000> leg<00:00:15.299> is<00:00:15.630> pushing<00:00:16.590> as

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
turning what my right leg is pushing as

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.000 
turning what my right leg is pushing as
I'm<00:00:16.980> bending<00:00:17.520> so<00:00:18.210> that's<00:00:18.390> an<00:00:18.539> active<00:00:19.080> rain<00:00:19.439> and

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
I'm bending so that's an active rain and

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.939 
I'm bending so that's an active rain and
I'm<00:00:20.660> leading<00:00:21.660> here<00:00:21.900> and<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.230> outside<00:00:22.410> of<00:00:22.830> my

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
I'm leading here and the outside of my

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.120 
I'm leading here and the outside of my
body<00:00:23.189> is<00:00:23.400> active<00:00:24.000> but<00:00:24.810> if<00:00:24.900> I'm<00:00:25.050> trotting<00:00:25.380> and<00:00:25.859> I

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
body is active but if I'm trotting and I

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.519 
body is active but if I'm trotting and I
want<00:00:26.430> to<00:00:26.609> just<00:00:27.269> slow<00:00:27.570> down<00:00:27.840> and<00:00:28.170> use<00:00:28.289> that

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
want to just slow down and use that

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.450 
want to just slow down and use that
bending<00:00:28.920> I<00:00:29.070> take<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.519> molecules<00:00:30.240> out<00:00:30.859> so<00:00:31.859> it's

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
bending I take the molecules out so it's

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.380 
bending I take the molecules out so it's
an<00:00:32.669> inactive<00:00:33.210> ring<00:00:34.130> so<00:00:35.130> basically<00:00:36.000> got<00:00:36.149> two

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
an inactive ring so basically got two

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.459 
an inactive ring so basically got two
active<00:00:36.750> reins<00:00:36.930> we're<00:00:37.050> going<00:00:37.170> to<00:00:37.230> work<00:00:37.320> on

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
active reins we're going to work on

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.590 
active reins we're going to work on
right<00:00:37.620> now<00:00:37.770> and<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.550> indirect<00:00:38.910> rain<00:00:39.149> and<00:00:39.360> a

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
right now and the indirect rain and a

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.260 
right now and the indirect rain and a
direct<00:00:39.960> rain<00:00:40.140> and<00:00:40.410> in<00:00:40.530> indirect<00:00:41.280> rain<00:00:41.489> the

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
direct rain and in indirect rain the

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.420 
direct rain and in indirect rain the
neck<00:00:42.540> bends<00:00:42.870> a<00:00:43.050> lot<00:00:43.230> and<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.620> hindquarters

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
neck bends a lot and the hindquarters

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.600 
neck bends a lot and the hindquarters
move<00:00:44.670> a<00:00:44.940> direct<00:00:45.480> rain<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:46.680> next<00:00:47.039> day<00:00:47.190> straight

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
move a direct rain the next day straight

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.479 
move a direct rain the next day straight
so<00:00:48.420> does<00:00:48.600> our<00:00:48.690> elbow<00:00:48.989> look<00:00:49.230> watch<00:00:49.440> if<00:00:50.129> I<00:00:50.219> bend

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
so does our elbow look watch if I bend

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.569 
so does our elbow look watch if I bend
my<00:00:50.550> elbow<00:00:50.969> she'll<00:00:51.719> bend<00:00:51.899> her<00:00:52.050> neck<00:00:52.430> if<00:00:53.430> I

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
my elbow she'll bend her neck if I

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.310 
my elbow she'll bend her neck if I
straighten<00:00:54.000> my<00:00:54.030> elbow<00:00:54.449> she'll<00:00:55.110> straighten

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
straighten my elbow she'll straighten

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.709 
straighten my elbow she'll straighten
her<00:00:55.559> neck<00:00:55.739> and<00:00:56.010> so<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.610> direct<00:00:56.969> rain<00:00:57.270> leads

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
her neck and so the direct rain leads

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.910 
her neck and so the direct rain leads
the<00:00:57.989> front<00:00:58.320> okay<00:00:59.309> the<00:01:00.030> indirect<00:01:00.570> rain<00:01:01.050> moves

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
the front okay the indirect rain moves

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.920 
the front okay the indirect rain moves
the<00:01:02.280> hindquarters<00:01:02.820> I<00:01:03.000> want<00:01:03.600> you<00:01:03.690> to<00:01:03.780> think

the hindquarters I want you to think

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.859 
the hindquarters I want you to think
about<00:01:04.309> someone<00:01:05.309> going<00:01:06.000> across<00:01:06.299> about<00:01:06.510> two
