00:00:08.209 --> 00:00:09.619
 hi in the picture 

00:00:09.619 --> 00:00:11.829
 I'm not like that 

00:00:11.829 --> 00:00:12.919
 Yes 

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:15.919
 I think so 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.530
 because hagen wrote this book when it was inspired by a journey 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.130
 in the granada 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:41.240
 and now the party wants bigger too 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:42.570
 and the vendÃ©e 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.890
 competitor of africa transfer of children 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:47.460
 it's a book 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.280
 that is about six children 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.940
 your children spend the night together 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.870
 and as often happens, for example, the fairy tales of a thousand and 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:58.420
 a night on sera saturday 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.420
 spend night together tell stories ned 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.850
 everyone got a drum at the end of the morning 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.090
 m goes 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.090
 the proportion is beyond most of the brakes 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.060
 what do you think of the drama 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.870
 this week is quite a week 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:32.360
 to make a role out of vliet 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.260
 and then also with our house rules 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.280
 French There is a plan to become an American within one year 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.270
 you know shell does a good job 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.780
 these are 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.840
 the group comes to sit on the stairs the chance her is standing next to me and it is 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.610
 a combination of reading and telling with the plates and the book 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.400
 and the children talk about the story and that can be seen on the pictures 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.880
 the intention is for the book to be introduced in this way and for them 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.300
 because there also going to read in class and then reading the book on that 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.049
 way 

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:09.869
 the 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.709
 easier it is 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:13.919
 not an easy corner for the children 

00:02:13.919 --> 00:02:16.459
 and through the knitted introduction 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:19.509
 so this one 

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:22.509
 true 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:31.729

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:34.729

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:46.019
 to touch 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:51.620
 liander two girls were working on this I had to have a spokeswoman 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.229
