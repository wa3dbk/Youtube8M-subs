h and seven tutorial is about finding
and<00:00:12.960> using<00:00:12.990> maps<00:00:13.469> in<00:00:13.710> for<00:00:13.889> arriving<00:00:14.340> at<00:00:14.460> mode

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:14.780 
and using maps in for arriving at mode

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.420 
and using maps in for arriving at mode
this<00:00:15.780> is<00:00:15.809> important<00:00:16.470> because<00:00:16.590> finding<00:00:17.340> the

two<00:00:51.570> ways<00:00:51.809> of<00:00:51.989> accessing<00:00:52.350> different<00:00:52.860> maps<00:00:53.070> at

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
two ways of accessing different maps at

two ways of accessing different maps at
your<00:00:53.610> current<00:00:53.969> map<00:00:54.149> screen<00:00:54.829> the<00:00:55.829> easiest<00:00:56.219> way

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
your current map screen the easiest way

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.080 
your current map screen the easiest way
is<00:00:56.879> to<00:00:56.940> simply<00:00:57.629> use<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:58.140> up<00:00:58.379> and<00:00:58.739> down

is to simply use the up and down

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.819 
is to simply use the up and down
detailed<00:01:00.090> map<00:01:00.329> buttons<00:01:01.109> that<00:01:01.320> you<00:01:01.410> can<00:01:01.530> see<00:01:01.710> on
