00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:08.300
 In this lesson we will look at how 

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:10.060
 load the texture into the material and 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:14.570
 tune and 

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:19.419
 the first section is diffuse color if 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:19.419
 we can set any color to our material 

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:24.289
 near there is a square in which 

00:00:22.909 --> 00:00:26.899
 texture is loaded 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:29.960
 when we immerse the texture color 

00:00:26.899 --> 00:00:33.980
 automatically turns off click on 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:36.859
 square go to the maps section and here 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:43.789
 we click the bitmap tab 

00:00:36.859 --> 00:00:51.800
 and choose any texture which we 

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:54.800
 like let's say it will be tile when 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:57.800
 we loaded the texture we need our 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.839
 texture light up to see it in our 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.960
 the stage 

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:04.870
 click it on this icon 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:08.960
 further consider the settings of our textures 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:11.410
 here we have offside we can 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:16.810
 move our texture 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:20.510
 here we can set the styling size 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:26.870
 make it quite small by default 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:29.860
 worth 1 it can also reflect on 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:35.060
 horizontals and verticals and we can 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:37.040
 turn as we want with this need to be 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:42.380
 careful because our texture 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:46.610
 can also distort our texture 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:53.750
 blur it will be visible on the slot 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:56.000
 materials default is 1 in 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.330
 the next parameters we can change 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.070
 texture stain parameter 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.409
 open the tab and select any 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:06.609
 texture 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:08.690
 edges we will like also we can 

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:11.780
 trim our texture 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:16.629
 set and play and click view image 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:27.860
 here we can trim our texture 

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:30.769
 as we need further parameters 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:34.280
 practically unclaimed go in 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:35.239
 next tab is the output tab in 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.540
 this parameter 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:40.760
 sometimes the output flag is required 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.700
 reverse the texture 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:46.310
 color is mainly used when 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:49.220
 black and white textures also consider 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.120
 rzhb level parameter here we can 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.959
 lighten up 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:56.329
 or darken our texture to exit 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:59.750
 from texture settings 

00:02:56.329 --> 00:03:04.760
 we press the pictogram hunger in parents 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:06.880
 and go out to the main stuff in this 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.880
 lesson we reviewed the settings 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.880
 textures
