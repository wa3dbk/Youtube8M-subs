 I'm Marai Giulia, 

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:14.800
 during dance therapy we work with leaves, it's a very beautiful thing. 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:23.300
 We try to represent these leaves with the movements of the hands, feet, body ... of the whole body. 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 These leaves hide a secret, they come from a magical tree that has lost all its leaves. 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.900
 We work all the time with these leaves 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:48.500
 because our task is to find this tree again. 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.000
 At the beginning of the dance therapy we introduced ourselves to these leaves. 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.300
 It is very nice to do dance therapy
