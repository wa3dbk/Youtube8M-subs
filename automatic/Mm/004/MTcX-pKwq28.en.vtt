our brain waves what a brain waves

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.530 
our brain waves what a brain waves
newest<00:00:10.530> iems<00:00:11.190> and<00:00:11.580> it<00:00:11.670> features<00:00:12.030> a<00:00:12.059> tool

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
newest iems and it features a tool

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.530 
newest iems and it features a tool
dynamic<00:00:13.259> driver<00:00:13.559> basing<00:00:14.549> this<00:00:15.179> it<00:00:15.360> has<00:00:15.480> a

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
dynamic driver basing this it has a

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.870 
dynamic driver basing this it has a
really<00:00:15.870> large<00:00:16.199> on<00:00:16.590> driver<00:00:17.039> housing<00:00:17.640> and

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
really large on driver housing and

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.760 
really large on driver housing and
that's<00:00:18.240> because<00:00:18.570> that's<00:00:19.020> two<00:00:19.320> dynamic

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
that's because that's two dynamic

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.590 
that's because that's two dynamic
drivers<00:00:20.130> in<00:00:20.250> there<00:00:20.369> which<00:00:20.520> mixes<00:00:21.449> up<00:00:21.570> the

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
drivers in there which mixes up the

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.529 
drivers in there which mixes up the
sound<00:00:21.869> produced<00:00:22.109> some<00:00:22.650> sonic<00:00:23.250> down<00:00:23.430> to<00:00:23.670> it<00:00:23.789> so

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
sound produced some sonic down to it so

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.570 
sound produced some sonic down to it so
here<00:00:24.900> it<00:00:24.990> is<00:00:25.080> I<00:00:25.320> wish<00:00:25.439> to<00:00:25.650> thank<00:00:25.680> runways<00:00:26.220> for

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
here it is I wish to thank runways for

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.519 
here it is I wish to thank runways for
providing<00:00:27.029> you<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:27.269> sample<00:00:27.599> and<00:00:28.289> let's<00:00:28.439> get

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
providing you the sample and let's get

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.389 
providing you the sample and let's get
started<00:00:28.970> so<00:00:30.170> we<00:00:31.170> see<00:00:31.349> a<00:00:31.380> clear<00:00:31.679> case<00:00:31.920> book<00:00:32.250> so

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
started so we see a clear case book so

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.790 
started so we see a clear case book so
you<00:00:32.430> see<00:00:32.669> right<00:00:32.820> through<00:00:33.030> it<00:00:33.090> and<00:00:33.390> it<00:00:34.350> opens

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
you see right through it and it opens

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.330 
you see right through it and it opens
from<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:35.010> sides<00:00:35.340> from<00:00:35.730> what<00:00:35.940> i<00:00:36.000> see<00:00:36.270> so<00:00:37.340> let's

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
from the sides from what i see so let's

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:46.970

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
top poppies two days out ok so here is

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.780 
top poppies two days out ok so here is
it<00:01:28.110> as<00:01:28.290> you<00:01:28.439> probably<00:01:28.740> see<00:01:29.159> looks<00:01:29.520> like<00:01:29.670> the

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
it as you probably see looks like the

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.840 
it as you probably see looks like the
wires<00:01:30.000> are<00:01:30.360> on<00:01:30.689> memory<00:01:31.530> foam<00:01:31.829> life<00:01:32.100> or<00:01:32.340> for<00:01:32.729> the

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
wires are on memory foam life or for the

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.450 
wires are on memory foam life or for the
most<00:01:33.000> part<00:01:33.240> order<00:01:33.829> and<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:35.070> ball<00:01:35.250> so<00:01:35.430> you

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
most part order and the ball so you

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.060 
most part order and the ball so you
moved<00:01:35.759> into<00:01:35.909> your<00:01:36.030> ears<00:01:36.530> need<00:01:37.530> for<00:01:37.740> cable

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
moved into your ears need for cable

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.429 
moved into your ears need for cable
guides<00:01:40.009> opening<00:01:41.009> it<00:01:41.100> up<00:01:41.189> we<00:01:42.000> have<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.659> artery

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
guides opening it up we have the artery

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.210 
guides opening it up we have the artery
stumped<00:01:43.799> inside<00:01:45.049> it<00:01:46.049> seems<00:01:46.439> like<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:47.009> only

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
stumped inside it seems like the only

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.510 
stumped inside it seems like the only
dumb<00:01:48.210> memory<00:01:48.960> foam<00:01:49.200> is<00:01:49.229> only<00:01:49.590> up<00:01:49.920> to<00:01:50.070> this<00:01:50.220> part

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
dumb memory foam is only up to this part

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.090 
dumb memory foam is only up to this part
past<00:01:50.820> this<00:01:50.939> part<00:01:51.149> is<00:01:51.390> greatly<00:01:51.600> wire<00:01:51.930> over<00:01:52.829> here

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
past this part is greatly wire over here

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.550 
past this part is greatly wire over here
is<00:01:53.250> what's<00:01:53.520> moldable<00:01:54.119> for<00:01:54.869> both<00:01:55.110> of<00:01:55.290> them<00:01:55.409> to

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
is what's moldable for both of them to

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.090 
is what's moldable for both of them to
and<00:01:56.990> the<00:01:57.990> most<00:01:58.200> part<00:01:58.380> this<00:01:58.439> is<00:01:58.500> a<00:01:58.619> really<00:01:58.979> nice

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
and the most part this is a really nice

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.740 
and the most part this is a really nice
wire<00:01:59.340> actually<00:01:59.790> from<00:02:00.000> what<00:02:00.030> i<00:02:00.149> can<00:02:00.240> tell<00:02:00.360> but

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
wire actually from what i can tell but

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.160 
wire actually from what i can tell but
you<00:02:00.930> know<00:02:01.049> my<00:02:01.320> review<00:02:01.649> will<00:02:01.890> have<00:02:02.070> more<00:02:02.310> of<00:02:02.399> it

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
you know my review will have more of it

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.920 
you know my review will have more of it
