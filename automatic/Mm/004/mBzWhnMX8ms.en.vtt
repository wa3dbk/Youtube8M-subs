 Let me tell you these few words, on which time has no hold, 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
 Let me spare you the lie 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 Let me water thirsty your roots 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000

 Let me spare you the lie Let me water thirsty your roots 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
 Your strokes, straw-colored, I have winnowed them and like blades of faded grass, 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
 in the sky, scattered In doing so, my love flew away 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000

 We built ice palaces, and we set fire to them 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 We built chimeras on sand, everything evaporated 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
 I trusted you when you told me that you preferred me to your sisters 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
 But you and the lie, you are made of the same strain 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
 I trusted you when you told me that you preferred me to your sisters 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
 your sisters to you are lies, all forged in the same mold. 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
 But you and the lie, you are made of the same strain 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000
 I leave you in memory the memory of our once shared love 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
 Know, young girl, that it is with tears of blood that I wrote it 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000
 Nothing will be like before now. I'm afraid that the day you come back, I'm not here 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000
 My rancor is terribly terrible darkness; there is no more room for you in my heart 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000
 Know, young girl, that it is with tears of blood that I wrote it 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000
 My rancor is terribly terrible darkness; there is no more room for you in my heart 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000
 Sometimes I want to burst into tears But I swallow them by virile pride 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000
 These tears of which you are the cause, believe me, have made me what I am, a healer 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000
 I wish you to give birth to a offspring that you will lose in the lie 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000
 May your heart be full of hatred and life be bitter to you 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
 These tears of which you are the cause, believe me, have made me what I am, a healer 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000
 These tears of which you are the cause, believe me, have made me what I am, a healer 

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000
 I fled Charybdis and fell into Scylla, But I gained experience, wisdom! 

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000
 I learned fear and I became hardened! So, eviscerate yourself, I do not care! 

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000
 I fled Charybdis and fell into Scylla, But I gained experience, wisdom!
