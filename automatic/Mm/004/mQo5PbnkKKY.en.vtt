00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.940
 welcome to olive's office we are going to 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:21.490
 talk about cats statistically the 

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:23.680
 second in importance after the pet 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:24.670
 dog sometimes sometimes silty 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.800
 indifferent 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:29.619
 the cat is adopted more and more as 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.900
 companion animal its small size what 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:34.630
 economic care and cleanliness 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:37.240
 make the cat an animal that adapts 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:38.920
 perfectly to life with the human being 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:42.250
 calculates that the urban centers of the 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:44.649
 argentina there are 1 to 2 cats every 4 dogs 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:47.469
 but this trend in recent years 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:49.780
 is changing in favor of cats which 

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:52.180
 is the story of this friendship thanks to 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.699
 DNA studies it is known that the origin 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:57.309
 of our friend is the wild cat or 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:59.410
 felis silvestris while the 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:02.079
 big cats like lions and 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:04.239
 tigers lived towards the center of africa 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:06.550
 the little wild cats that were 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:09.070
 scattered across the south and north of that 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:11.380
 continent for the east of europe and for 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.420
 everything towards today we know that our 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.060
 company cat descends from the cat 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.159
 wild that ten thousand years ago lived in 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.619
 Asian mesopotamia 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:22.270
 this fertile region called the cradle of the 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:25.240
 humanity registered the first 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:27.880
 civilized settlements that based their 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:30.100
 food in agriculture when the 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:33.189
 human learned to grow cereals 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:35.920
 he was forced to settle in the place 

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:38.590
 and accumulate food for the bad 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.840
 times these cereals plus garbage 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.619
 proper to all human settlement 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:46.659
 prompted the arrival of a visitor 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.549
 unwanted rodents and went with them 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:50.200
 that the first wild cats were 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:52.629
 they approached the villages 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.030
 that's how the cat got used to 

00:01:52.629 --> 00:01:57.399
 human to the point that three thousand years 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.950
 then in ancient Egypt they were already 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:01.500
 he worshiped as gods his independence of 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.209
 character and his nocturnal habits 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.579
 they made cats always a 

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:09.250
 mystery maybe that's why in the age 

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:11.709
 media was associated with witchcraft and 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.260
 They were persecuted throughout Europe 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:16.870
 this was until the 18th century when the 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.390
 proliferation of rats triggered one of 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.430
 the greatest epidemics of mankind the 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.710
 black plague and it was when the cats 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.170
 new ones were accepted 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:28.690
 inside the home and here we have them today 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:31.480
 day some more cuddly others more 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.970
 elusive but always living near 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:37.560
 us as good friends until the 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.560
 next office upstairs
