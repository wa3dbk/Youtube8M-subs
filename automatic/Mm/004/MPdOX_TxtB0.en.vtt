container oh yeah I think so but uh just
more<00:00:46.030> importantly<00:00:46.510> I<00:00:46.569> just<00:00:46.929> had<00:00:47.050> to<00:00:47.199> get<00:00:47.589> some

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:47.800 
more importantly I just had to get some

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.479 
more importantly I just had to get some
rest<00:00:48.010> so<00:00:48.309> that<00:00:48.579> helped<00:00:49.179> a<00:00:49.269> lot<00:00:49.300> but<00:00:50.370> you<00:00:51.370> know

00:00:52.929 --> 00:00:54.750 
hopefully it won't be a problem this
season<00:00:53.170> hopefully<00:00:53.620> I<00:00:53.829> could<00:00:54.039> keep<00:00:54.429> my<00:00:54.489> weight
