well<00:00:00.840> these<00:00:00.960> are<00:00:01.140> the<00:00:01.199> red<00:00:01.350> currents<00:00:01.709> that<00:00:01.920> I

00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:01.979 
well these are the red currents that I

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.030 
well these are the red currents that I
picked<00:00:02.250> this<00:00:02.639> morning<00:00:03.030> and<00:00:03.770> the<00:00:04.770> good<00:00:04.920> thing

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
picked this morning and the good thing

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.590 
picked this morning and the good thing
about<00:00:05.100> red<00:00:05.430> currants<00:00:05.759> is<00:00:05.910> that<00:00:06.089> the<00:00:06.240> packed

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
about red currants is that the packed

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.110 
about red currants is that the packed
full<00:00:06.899> of<00:00:07.200> pectin<00:00:07.740> so<00:00:08.340> preserves<00:00:08.790> that<00:00:09.000> are

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
full of pectin so preserves that are

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.450 
full of pectin so preserves that are
made<00:00:09.269> from<00:00:09.450> them<00:00:09.660> set<00:00:10.019> well<00:00:10.320> and<00:00:10.590> in<00:00:11.309> this

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
made from them set well and in this

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.120 
made from them set well and in this
instance<00:00:11.700> what<00:00:12.599> we're<00:00:12.750> going<00:00:12.900> to<00:00:12.929> do<00:00:13.139> is<00:00:13.650> make

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
instance what we're going to do is make

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.390 
instance what we're going to do is make
a<00:00:14.400> red<00:00:14.730> currant<00:00:15.000> jelly<00:00:15.470> so<00:00:16.470> into<00:00:16.770> a<00:00:16.800> charm<00:00:17.130> pan

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
a red currant jelly so into a charm pan

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.650 
a red currant jelly so into a charm pan
put<00:00:18.000> your<00:00:18.630> red<00:00:18.750> currants<00:00:19.230> and<00:00:19.460> then<00:00:20.460> add<00:00:21.270> a

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
put your red currants and then add a

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.730 
put your red currants and then add a
little<00:00:22.080> bit<00:00:22.439> of<00:00:23.160> water<00:00:23.369> just<00:00:24.000> to<00:00:24.119> make<00:00:24.300> sure

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:24.740 
little bit of water just to make sure

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.609 
little bit of water just to make sure
that<00:00:26.060> it's<00:00:27.060> not<00:00:27.210> going<00:00:27.390> to<00:00:27.449> catch<00:00:27.630> on<00:00:27.900> now<00:00:28.560> you

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
that it's not going to catch on now you

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.410 
that it's not going to catch on now you
don't<00:00:28.800> need<00:00:28.890> to<00:00:29.010> measure<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.789> weights<00:00:30.000> at<00:00:30.359> the

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
don't need to measure the weights at the

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.959 
don't need to measure the weights at the
moment<00:00:30.929> because<00:00:31.650> I'm<00:00:32.399> going<00:00:32.579> to<00:00:32.640> be<00:00:32.759> working

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
moment because I'm going to be working

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.810 
moment because I'm going to be working
on<00:00:33.390> liquids<00:00:33.930> which<00:00:34.620> will<00:00:34.829> extract<00:00:35.280> from<00:00:35.579> this

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
on liquids which will extract from this

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.060 
on liquids which will extract from this
and<00:00:36.059> that<00:00:36.960> comes<00:00:37.260> later<00:00:37.530> on<00:00:37.620> in<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:37.890> process

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
and that comes later on in the process

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.360 
and that comes later on in the process
but<00:00:38.790> once<00:00:39.390> you've<00:00:39.570> added<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:40.290> water<00:00:40.500> in<00:00:40.890> it

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
but once you've added the water in it

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.959 
but once you've added the water in it
you<00:00:41.520> just<00:00:41.700> need<00:00:42.059> to<00:00:42.870> apply<00:00:42.960> heat<00:00:43.469> and<00:00:43.969> bring

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
you just need to apply heat and bring

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.479 
you just need to apply heat and bring
this<00:00:45.090> up<00:00:45.239> to<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.450> boil<00:00:45.890> once<00:00:46.890> it's<00:00:47.070> come<00:00:47.250> up<00:00:47.340> to

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
this up to the boil once it's come up to

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.130 
this up to the boil once it's come up to
the<00:00:47.579> boil<00:00:48.170> leave<00:00:49.170> it<00:00:49.350> to<00:00:49.590> simmer<00:00:50.039> until<00:00:51.140> all

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
the boil leave it to simmer until all

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.740 
the boil leave it to simmer until all
the<00:00:52.500> fruit<00:00:52.770> is<00:00:52.920> broken<00:00:53.219> up<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:54.300> juices

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
the fruit is broken up and the juices

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.580 
the fruit is broken up and the juices
have<00:00:56.480> circulated<00:00:57.480> around<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:57.989> percolated

have circulated around and percolated

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.010 
have circulated around and percolated
through<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.949> entire<00:00:59.340> mix<00:00:59.870> after<00:01:00.870> you've

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
through the entire mix after you've

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.779 
through the entire mix after you've
submit<00:01:01.320> it<00:01:01.410> for<00:01:01.440> about<00:01:01.649> an<00:01:01.890> hour<00:01:02.039> and<00:01:02.340> it's

submit it for about an hour and it's

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.780 
submit it for about an hour and it's
nicely<00:01:03.059> Pulp<00:01:03.570> top<00:01:03.809> then<00:01:04.500> is<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.799> time<00:01:05.040> to<00:01:05.610> put

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
nicely Pulp top then is the time to put

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.560 
nicely Pulp top then is the time to put
it<00:01:05.880> through<00:01:06.630> a<00:01:06.689> jelly<00:01:06.960> bag<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.439> strain<00:01:07.680> it

after its strain for a few hours you

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.670 
after its strain for a few hours you
need<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:14.790> measure<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.210> liquid<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:15.689> put<00:01:16.380> it<00:01:16.530> in

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
need to measure the liquid and put it in

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.830 
need to measure the liquid and put it in
the<00:01:16.770> jump<00:01:17.009> and<00:01:20.060> when<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.150> liquids<00:01:21.450> come<00:01:21.600> up<00:01:21.720> to

the jump and when the liquids come up to

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.370 
the jump and when the liquids come up to
the<00:01:21.930> boil<00:01:22.140> add<00:01:22.770> in<00:01:23.009> one<00:01:23.340> kilo<00:01:23.820> of<00:01:23.850> sugar<00:01:24.380> for

every liter of liquid once it's come
back<00:01:28.619> up<00:01:28.770> to<00:01:28.799> the<00:01:28.979> boil<00:01:29.189> you<00:01:29.820> then<00:01:29.970> need<00:01:30.180> to

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
back up to the boil you then need to

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.870 
back up to the boil you then need to
check<00:01:30.570> for<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.259> setting<00:01:31.590> point<00:01:31.770> you<00:01:32.729> get<00:01:32.850> a

check for the setting point you get a

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.700 
check for the setting point you get a
dollop<00:01:33.210> of<00:01:33.240> it<00:01:33.689> put<00:01:34.470> on<00:01:34.619> a<00:01:34.650> saucer<00:01:35.250> and<00:01:35.689> then
