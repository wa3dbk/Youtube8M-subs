00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:28.800
 namely the so-called general-purpose weapon 

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:30.689
 the akg c1000 it in this case peoples 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:36.030
 tell us something why this is yours 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:37.530
 general purpose weapon should be c1000 smk four 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.110
 actually, even because it's the fourth 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.370
 reprint is before that the 1000th 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.850
 one knows maybe one is silver 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.309
 nickel 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:48.510
 now slightly adjusted in black 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.589
 the other series from akg the capsule 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.219
 has remained the same sound 

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:52.170
 stayed the same 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.350
 the really interesting is located 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.089
 why always these often under the hood 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.290
 because we now have two double 

00:00:57.089 --> 00:00:59.970
 aaa batteries in here for 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.830
 voltage supply no longer like 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:04.949
 formerly nine volt blog.de adopted 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:06.509
 this very quickly empty are exactly this 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.820
 not so often that means I am 

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:10.409
 can the microphone with the two double 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.960
 Workers or still 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.579
 Of course, still with the phantom farmer 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:17.369
 wonderful and it is from the field of use 

00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:19.079
 he is very versatile yes so there is 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.729
 I do not believe anything the people then 

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:23.130
 have not tried to lose weight 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.409
 It is suitable for speakers as a song 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.570
 Microphone for every kind of instrument 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.820
 because it is so versatile 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.100
 which is characteristic but you 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.740
 of directional characteristics I have 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.000
 usually in theirs and there is one 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.100
 essay for the capsule where I have a great 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.729
 closer with wars can further tower 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.409
 is there still the c1000 when vgh yes 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.670
 even the case was that I was such a 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.409
 to raise awareness of presence 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.090
 example for language or if i use it 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.229
 want to lose weight or after haid 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:57.180
 which then raises slightly 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:58.680
 what should the cost 29 euro 219 euro there 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:04.979
 We are really about the acts in the 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:06.720

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.560
