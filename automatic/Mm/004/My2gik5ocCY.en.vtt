00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
putting fuel in it but we expect our

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.550 
putting fuel in it but we expect our

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
bodies to do more than that and not fuel

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.380 
bodies to do more than that and not fuel
it<00:02:43.710> I<00:02:43.860> know<00:02:44.310> there<00:02:44.700> was<00:02:44.730> some<00:02:44.880> girls<00:02:45.270> that

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
it I know there was some girls that

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.420 
it I know there was some girls that
weren't<00:02:45.690> any<00:02:45.900> at<00:02:46.140> all<00:02:46.320> through<00:02:46.950> the<00:02:47.040> process

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
weren't any at all through the process

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:48.710 
weren't any at all through the process
because<00:02:47.610> it<00:02:47.820> does<00:02:47.910> give<00:02:48.120> you<00:02:48.180> quite<00:02:48.390> a<00:02:48.450> bit<00:02:48.630> of

because it does give you quite a bit of

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.860 
because it does give you quite a bit of
energy<00:02:49.140> but<00:02:49.880> that<00:02:50.880> just<00:02:50.910> encourages<00:02:51.570> them<00:02:51.720> not

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
energy but that just encourages them not

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.440 
energy but that just encourages them not
to<00:02:51.959> eat<00:02:52.110> at<00:02:52.200> all<00:02:52.350> and<00:02:52.620> it<00:02:52.980> is<00:02:53.130> encouraging<00:02:53.520> 32nd
