00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:09.610
 ace 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:46.170
 Monday the counselor 19 of this month in the same program I liked a lot 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:50.690
 and there is a conscience because I felt that the people of the church have the 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.179
 chimney we gave the municipality of Lugo the facts 

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:58.129
 and I wanted to share that condition that understands them that has important the 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:00:59.250
 gospel 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.530
 and maybe apply for 0 the counselor because I love working with youth 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.130
 and I was attracted to the idea because when they resisted participating with him 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.470
 present in irán sale of music of santa lucía 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.710
 I attended the report for four years 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.030
 I liked it so much that I wanted to join them in these guys have a year and a half 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.840
 In Myself 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.840
 and then they say that these activities for youth 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:25.110
 because I had a gospel scoop, I think that's what more than the 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.250
 big difference 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.480
 while the fourth is a very enriching experience 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.940
 that's why the whole week out of the world 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.980
 and for a week they have the opportunity to live in misery and that 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.460
 great 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.380
 who thinks that energy should be fun press 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.360
 there is a differentiating element 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.620
 it's a short period of time to escape from reality 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.490
 something like a criminal 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.659
 you also have the opportunity to focus on spiritual things and 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.659
 hardly credible private 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:03.500
 téllez kuenzler young people from different places with common interests and has 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.130
 sense within the group 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.229
 this happens 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:10.479
 here in the opportunity to share what they have in common with us guys 

00:02:11.169 --> 00:02:15.899
 they are all young people are trying to appear to be more accurate are people 

00:02:15.899 --> 00:02:19.259
 who want to make good decisions that who so good 

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:22.239
 despite the challenges that may arise 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:25.980
 It can be a challenge when you have a place where you are the only one 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.289
 church member schools 

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:32.549
 but then I've decided this little piece of heaven where there are guys like you 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:34.549
 if they want to serve is imminent 

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:36.419
 they want to be better people 

00:02:36.419 --> 00:02:40.809
 this will bring a major change in our lives that you see resting from 

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:43.269
 life in the lives of others 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:47.449
 use within the gospel is that of many young people come sharing with 

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:48.790
 people of the same age 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.450
 that they think my principles and this in having fun together they present these 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:54.619
 people have 

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:56.900
 finally carlos with each other 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.609
 the defenses parts 

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:01.619
 many of our ancestors 

00:03:01.619 --> 00:03:04.229
 for young women who have a lot in me 

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:06.150
 - I feel that other guys 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.649
 although the principles that they 

00:03:08.649 --> 00:03:13.139
 I think you can strengthen two a lot and it can help you feel is a 

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:18.139
 big party they can church because it is and understand that no 

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:19.939
 They are closed 

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:21.789
 and that's something fantastic 

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:25.609
 award twice in this situation of death 

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:28.609
 nothing help 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:32.950
 the best part of that moment is not had and is that the progress of the 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.069
 Girls 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:40.729
 the first week of the month and if it spans the world is aware of 

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:41.219
 that 

00:03:41.219 --> 00:03:46.229
 we just have interests that's something that impressed me so much 

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.529
 not
