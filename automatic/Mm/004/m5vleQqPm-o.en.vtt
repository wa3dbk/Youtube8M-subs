00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.559
 hello and welcome to bathrooms and where you 

00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:17.199
 we teach creative and economic ways 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:19.269
 to decorate organize and update your 

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:21.099
 bathroom so that your visit is one more 

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:22.929
 pleasant I am a martine called 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:24.849
 interior decorator and today I'm going to 

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:27.160
 share with you a super project 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:29.289
 simple to create a decorative niche 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.810
 in your bathroom instead of a medicine cabinet 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:33.250
 old-fashioned on the wall 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.350
 then you ask him to move the cabinet 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.969
 medicine or medicine cabinet on the wall and 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.219
 turn into a gap that we leave behind 

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:41.920
 in a decorative niche sounds complicated 

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:43.989
 but I promise you it is not 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.570
 we start by removing the screws that 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:49.239
 they hold the cabinet to the wall so 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:51.820
 easy is removed then we proceed to 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:54.519
 measure the width the height and the 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.409
 depth of the hole with the measurements in 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:58.239
 hand now we proceed to create a box 

00:00:56.409 --> 00:01:00.909
 of wood that we will then insert 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:03.000
 inside the recess to coat this 

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:04.629
 opening you can visualize 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.820
 basically what we are going to do is 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:09.520
 build in wood this back 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.720
 the medicine cabinet that is now plastic when 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.939
 we put it in its place 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.890
 without the shelves that you see here obvious we're going 

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:17.390
 to have a very beautiful focal point in the 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.310
 bathroom and modern well 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.260
 in the same improvement store for the 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.750
 home you can make straight cuts in 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:26.090
 the wood but an easy one with a 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.640
 hand saw and a jigsaw we make 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.710
 the cuts at home now we form a 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.270
 square with 1 x 4 wood that 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.759
 we screw the pieces by 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.619
 sides remember that the screws do not 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:38.750
 they will see because the box is going to go 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:41.060
 inside the wall but good advice 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.460
 not to split the wood is basically 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.560
 use a drill first to live hollow 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.720
 and in this way the screw goes in a lot 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:51.009
 easier and of course I'm using 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.009
 wood screws 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.390
 then we fix the back sheet 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.280
 adjusting fine nails we already have ready 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.830
 our wooden box and how can you see 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.260
 is the same width as the measurements on 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:08.450
 interior frame of the medicine cabinet now what 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:11.450
 I need to do is a decorative border 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:13.610
 around as we have here in the box 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.720
 plastic and for that I'm going to use this 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.970
 molding 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.920
 I made the 45-degree cuts in the 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.600
 corners to make it look prettier and 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.760
 for that we want to use that kind of 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:26.670
 tool that the truth that facilitates 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.590
 all kinds of cutting we already have the box 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:31.260
 wood and now you can paint it or 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.150
 dye to your liking I chose the white color 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.120
 to coordinate with the dresser and the 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.920
 mirror frame in the bathroom and all 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.930
 dry and unlike normal paint 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.570
 I always like to use an aerosol like 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:45.750
 this because it gives me a more finished 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:47.460
 parejito let's go to the bathroom we fix the box 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.650
 inside the hole to make sure that 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:51.810
 come in well do not worry about the 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:55.080
 separation that we see here between the box 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:57.959
 and the wall because that's why we have the 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:01.050
 molding that we cut earlier is going to 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:03.730
 put here and in this way we have a 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:05.860
 fine pretty completion 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:08.010
 Now we proceed to install the molding 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.930
 using double-sided adhesive tape 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.819
 fill the corners with putty and 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:16.060
 we went to install our niche 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:18.180
 framed in the beautiful beautiful beautiful 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:21.580
 I love it, I love it, I love it 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:23.100
 the moment where all the work and already 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:26.070
 can appreciate 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:27.900
 what change we use in our favor the 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:30.450
 space that occupied a first-aid kit 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.460
 old-fashioned on the wall and we now create a 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.500
 Decorative and modern niche that 

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:36.830
 It complements the style of the 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.830
 bathroom 

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:41.960
 so do not be scared when you see that 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.940
 hole in the wall because with creativity 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:46.370
 and little money you can create a point 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.900
 beautiful focal in your bathroom so that also 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.900
 look for super sic 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:53.210
 I am a loved martyr and if I did I know 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.570
 that you can also do it until the 

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:55.570
 next
