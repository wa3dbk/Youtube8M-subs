00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:17.039
 Hello dear site visitors 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.650
 the port of good compositions. viewer roles 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.529
 of our video channel my name is maria 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.390
 today I want to show and tell you 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.570
 what better to do in case 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.760
 You are experiencing problems viewing 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.270
 video on portable game consoles 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.500
 running the operating system 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:37.500
 android 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:41.399
 the fact is that in most consoles in 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.120
 As an example, the memory is preset 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.079
 any 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.510
 video file and if you run it it 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:57.420
 great going 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:01:00.469
 everything works shows the sound is there but how 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.850
 only you download yourself 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:08.180
 any video and try it 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.180
 run then may face 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:14.909
 incorrect playback for example 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:20.180
 the lack of sound here like now or in 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:25.140
 any hiss and others 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:26.700
 unpleasant things that i am in this case 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.090
 I advise because the operating system 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.500
 android is open then you just 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.409
 can use another 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:40.009
 player as another player i 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:44.790
 I recommend mx player for android 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:51.509
 I downloaded it and not from the market, so in 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:53.189
 application settings should be 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.270
 checkbox to allow installation of applications 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:58.579
 not derived from the market 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.530
 I saved it to the root directory 

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:04.110
 memory console 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:06.060
 that is, if the built-in memory looks like 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:11.020
 that's the way here are the various folders 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:16.360
 then my file is just where 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:17.670
 folders end just in root 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.220
 directory to install 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:26.680
 need to use the application up 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:29.980
 installer choose built-in flash memory 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:33.960
 and here he is mx player with him I downloaded 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.960
 as well as boats 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:48.250
 installation takes minutes and 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:50.460
 here the codec is also installed ready 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:54.940
 now not for long 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:57.400
 go to the homepage for 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:01.120
 so that the player icon appears in the list 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.250
 applications now when we find see 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:07.480
 mx player 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:09.330
 run it video not found need 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:13.510
 update list 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:18.310
 I saw where people do not need where 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:21.550
 search your files application see all 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:25.870
 files that are on the map and 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:28.050
 on the console's internal memory right away 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:34.180
 Let's go to the video that caused 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:37.650
 us a backlash at startup like 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:41.080
 see and hear no noticeable 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:45.959
 changes did not happen just vmx player 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:48.880
 there are settings 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:52.150
 which can include software 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:54.730
 the decanter and then immediately appears 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:57.970
 sound in a regular video player to achieve 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:03.340
 the appearance of sound most likely you have not 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:05.670
 get mx player most omnivorous 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.080
 that is why i tell you him and 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:10.209
 recommended 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:12.640
 he has a great job with his functions 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:16.290

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.290
 popular video formats 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:27.840
