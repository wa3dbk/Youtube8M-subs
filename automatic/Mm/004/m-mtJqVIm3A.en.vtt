00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
radical sloping roofline you don't get a

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.859 
radical sloping roofline you don't get a

really<00:02:21.860> love<00:02:22.579> the<00:02:22.730> way<00:02:22.880> it<00:02:23.000> drives<00:02:23.239> we<00:02:23.510> think

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
really love the way it drives we think

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.140 
really love the way it drives we think
the<00:02:23.900> interior<00:02:24.200> is<00:02:24.440> a<00:02:24.470> little<00:02:24.920> bit<00:02:25.040> plain<00:02:25.370> you

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
the interior is a little bit plain you

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.050 
the interior is a little bit plain you
can<00:02:26.180> see<00:02:26.569> where<00:02:26.810> they<00:02:27.019> had<00:02:27.650> to<00:02:27.980> make<00:02:28.579> some<00:02:28.790> cost

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
can see where they had to make some cost

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.819 
can see where they had to make some cost
savings<00:02:29.180> to<00:02:29.660> get<00:02:29.870> that<00:02:30.079> price<00:02:30.319> point<00:02:30.349> under

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:30.829 
savings to get that price point under

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:33.130 
savings to get that price point under
$30,000<00:02:31.700> so<00:02:32.269> the<00:02:32.360> vehicle<00:02:32.690> we're<00:02:32.810> driving

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
$30,000 so the vehicle we're driving

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.009 
$30,000 so the vehicle we're driving
today<00:02:33.260> is<00:02:33.410> it's<00:02:34.130> kind<00:02:34.340> of<00:02:34.370> an<00:02:34.489> entry<00:02:34.910> level<00:02:35.180> 2

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:36.019

some of the bells and whistles I like

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:44.380 
some of the bells and whistles I like
the<00:02:41.390> dual<00:02:41.599> climate<00:02:42.140> zone<00:02:43.040> we<00:02:43.940> also<00:02:44.090> don't<00:02:44.360> have

paddle shifters which would have been

paddle shifters which would have been
very<00:02:46.549> nice

a3 you don't have that issue you could

a3 you don't have that issue you could
see<00:03:21.080> it's<00:03:21.200> got<00:03:21.350> the<00:03:21.500> slightly<00:03:21.770> higher

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:21.890 
see it's got the slightly higher

at the overall size of this a3 it's

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:30.730 
at the overall size of this a3 it's
pretty<00:03:27.830> much<00:03:27.980> the<00:03:28.130> same<00:03:28.340> of<00:03:28.640> the<00:03:29.060> original<00:03:29.900> a4

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:30.740 
pretty much the same of the original a4

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:32.470 
pretty much the same of the original a4
back<00:03:30.980> in<00:03:31.190> the<00:03:31.280> mid-90s<00:03:31.940> it<00:03:32.090> shows<00:03:32.240> you<00:03:32.360> how

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
back in the mid-90s it shows you how

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.080 
back in the mid-90s it shows you how
much<00:03:32.630> the<00:03:32.810> a4<00:03:33.230> has<00:03:33.440> grown<00:03:33.740> this<00:03:34.340> is<00:03:34.400> really<00:03:34.970> in

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
much the a4 has grown this is really in

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.140 
much the a4 has grown this is really in
my<00:03:35.240> opinion<00:03:35.410> where<00:03:36.410> a<00:03:36.620> compact<00:03:37.370> luxury<00:03:37.580> sedan

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
my opinion where a compact luxury sedan

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.540 
my opinion where a compact luxury sedan
should<00:03:38.780> be<00:03:38.930> and<00:03:39.380> the<00:03:40.070> other<00:03:40.160> thing<00:03:40.250> I<00:03:40.310> want<00:03:40.460> you

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:40.550 
should be and the other thing I want you

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:43.120 
should be and the other thing I want you
to<00:03:40.640> look<00:03:40.790> at<00:03:40.970> is<00:03:41.210> this<00:03:41.480> this<00:03:42.080> rear<00:03:42.560> windshield

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
to look at is this this rear windshield

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:46.900 
to look at is this this rear windshield
angle<00:03:44.060> if<00:03:44.720> I<00:03:44.930> had<00:03:45.200> an<00:03:45.530> Audi<00:03:45.830> TT<00:03:46.010> which<00:03:46.580> is<00:03:46.730> one

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:46.910 
angle if I had an Audi TT which is one

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:49.600 
angle if I had an Audi TT which is one
of<00:03:47.000> their<00:03:47.120> most<00:03:47.330> sporty<00:03:48.110> vehicles<00:03:48.590> and<00:03:48.770> an<00:03:49.400> a4

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:49.610 
of their most sporty vehicles and an a4

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:52.390 
of their most sporty vehicles and an a4
roof<00:03:50.090> line<00:03:50.330> the<00:03:50.870> angle<00:03:51.080> of<00:03:51.590> this<00:03:51.800> a3<00:03:52.250> is

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
roof line the angle of this a3 is

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.070 
roof line the angle of this a3 is
somewhere<00:03:52.790> in<00:03:52.940> between<00:03:53.090> so<00:03:53.570> they<00:03:53.870> really

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:54.080 
somewhere in between so they really

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.840 
somewhere in between so they really
wanted<00:03:54.290> to<00:03:54.410> distinguish<00:03:54.950> it<00:03:55.100> from<00:03:55.130> the<00:03:55.340> a4<00:03:55.700> by

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:55.850 
wanted to distinguish it from the a4 by

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:57.970 
wanted to distinguish it from the a4 by
making<00:03:56.150> it<00:03:56.300> look<00:03:56.330> a<00:03:56.630> little<00:03:56.810> sporty<00:03:57.350> er<00:03:57.380> and<00:03:57.620> I

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
making it look a little sporty er and I

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:58.960 
making it look a little sporty er and I
think<00:03:58.160> it<00:03:58.220> really<00:03:58.430> works

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:58.970 
think it really works

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:01.480 
think it really works
but<00:03:59.420> that<00:03:59.960> sportiness<00:04:00.440> really<00:04:01.100> comes<00:04:01.340> out

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:01.490 
but that sportiness really comes out

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:03.820 
but that sportiness really comes out
when<00:04:02.120> you're<00:04:02.300> behind<00:04:02.510> the<00:04:02.780> wheel<00:04:02.870> this<00:04:03.560> car

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:03.830 
when you're behind the wheel this car

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:06.250 
when you're behind the wheel this car
really<00:04:04.250> handles<00:04:04.340> well<00:04:04.940> and<00:04:05.270> the<00:04:05.870> reason<00:04:06.020> it

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
really handles well and the reason it

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:07.480 
really handles well and the reason it
does<00:04:06.410> that<00:04:06.440> is<00:04:06.590> because<00:04:06.890> of<00:04:07.010> that<00:04:07.100> shorter

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:07.490 
does that is because of that shorter

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:09.790 
does that is because of that shorter
wheelbase<00:04:07.700> the<00:04:08.420> Quattro<00:04:09.020> everything<00:04:09.710> just

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:09.800 
wheelbase the Quattro everything just

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.130 
wheelbase the Quattro everything just
seems<00:04:10.040> to<00:04:10.100> work<00:04:10.400> seamlessly<00:04:10.910> and<00:04:11.540> I<00:04:11.960> think

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:12.140 
seems to work seamlessly and I think

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:14.140
