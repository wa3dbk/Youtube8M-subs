it's gonna let you get kind of frisky

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.349 
it's gonna let you get kind of frisky
and<00:00:28.769> play<00:00:28.920> around<00:00:29.160> with<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.400> numbers<00:00:29.519> and<00:00:30.000> not

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
and play around with the numbers and not

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:31.970 
and play around with the numbers and not
have<00:00:30.449> to<00:00:30.570> worry<00:00:30.660> about<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:30.840> temperature<00:00:31.289> but

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
have to worry about the temperature but

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.680 
have to worry about the temperature but
it's<00:00:32.130> also<00:00:32.369> not<00:00:32.669> gonna<00:00:32.790> set<00:00:33.059> you<00:00:33.180> back<00:00:33.210> over<00:00:33.570> a

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
it's also not gonna set you back over a

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.630 
it's also not gonna set you back over a
hundred<00:00:33.750> dollars<00:00:34.290> very<00:00:34.950> affordable<00:00:35.430> very

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
hundred dollars very affordable very

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.190 
hundred dollars very affordable very
easy<00:00:35.760> to<00:00:36.000> install<00:00:36.149> and<00:00:36.450> a<00:00:36.540> very<00:00:36.750> simple<00:00:37.079> design

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
easy to install and a very simple design

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.319 
easy to install and a very simple design
so<00:00:37.559> let's<00:00:37.950> talk<00:00:38.100> about<00:00:38.160> that<00:00:38.460> design<00:00:38.730> first

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
so let's talk about that design first

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:40.940 
so let's talk about that design first
thing<00:00:39.510> you'll<00:00:39.719> notice<00:00:39.899> is<00:00:40.050> that<00:00:40.260> it<00:00:40.440> is<00:00:40.590> a

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
thing you'll notice is that it is a

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.340 
thing you'll notice is that it is a
aluminum<00:00:41.879> thin<00:00:42.329> design<00:00:42.510> so<00:00:42.960> it's<00:00:43.079> basically

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
aluminum thin design so it's basically

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.560 
aluminum thin design so it's basically
got<00:00:43.559> a<00:00:43.770> 100%<00:00:44.489> full<00:00:44.760> copper<00:00:45.180> plate<00:00:45.360> on<00:00:45.480> the

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
got a 100% full copper plate on the

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.920 
got a 100% full copper plate on the
bottom<00:00:45.870> as<00:00:45.989> you<00:00:46.170> see<00:00:46.410> it<00:00:46.649> is<00:00:47.219> very<00:00:47.579> very<00:00:48.539> smooth

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
bottom as you see it is very very smooth

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.200 
bottom as you see it is very very smooth
does<00:00:49.530> not<00:00:49.710> require<00:00:50.070> any<00:00:50.280> type<00:00:50.460> of<00:00:50.520> lapping<00:00:51.059> it

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
does not require any type of lapping it

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.630 
does not require any type of lapping it
has<00:00:51.570> five<00:00:51.930> heat<00:00:52.289> pipes<00:00:52.530> in<00:00:52.770> total<00:00:53.340> so<00:00:53.430> you<00:00:53.489> have

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
has five heat pipes in total so you have

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.630 
has five heat pipes in total so you have
one<00:00:53.879> two<00:00:54.360> three<00:00:54.390> four<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.469> then<00:00:55.590> five<00:00:55.640> and

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
one two three four and then five and

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.770 
one two three four and then five and
then<00:00:57.090> it<00:00:57.149> has<00:00:57.270> aluminum<00:00:57.870> fins<00:00:58.399> which<00:00:59.399> are<00:00:59.780> very

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
then it has aluminum fins which are very

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.139 
then it has aluminum fins which are very
nice<00:01:00.989> very<00:01:01.170> useful<00:01:01.680> and<00:01:01.949> you<00:01:02.280> have<00:01:02.460> two

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
nice very useful and you have two

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.600 
nice very useful and you have two
ninety-two<00:01:03.750> millimeter<00:01:04.260> fans<00:01:04.619> now<00:01:04.890> fans<00:01:05.430> are

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
ninety-two millimeter fans now fans are

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:06.980 
ninety-two millimeter fans now fans are
very<00:01:05.640> important<00:01:06.240> in<00:01:06.299> CPU<00:01:06.600> cooler<00:01:06.900> to

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
very important in CPU cooler to

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.390 
very important in CPU cooler to
determine<00:01:07.229> a<00:01:07.260> lot<00:01:07.380> of<00:01:07.439> things<00:01:07.740> your<00:01:07.920> airflow

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
determine a lot of things your airflow

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.460 
determine a lot of things your airflow
how<00:01:08.939> noisy<00:01:09.450> it's<00:01:09.570> gonna<00:01:09.659> be<00:01:09.869> and<00:01:09.990> how<00:01:10.080> good<00:01:10.350> it

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
how noisy it's gonna be and how good it

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.740 
how noisy it's gonna be and how good it
will<00:01:10.560> be<00:01:10.619> a<00:01:10.740> cooling<00:01:11.369> so<00:01:11.549> with<00:01:11.729> five<00:01:11.970> heat

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
will be a cooling so with five heat

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.230 
will be a cooling so with five heat
pipes<00:01:12.990> a<00:01:13.320> copper<00:01:13.770> plate<00:01:13.950> aluminum<00:01:14.700> fins<00:01:14.970> and

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
pipes a copper plate aluminum fins and

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.899 
pipes a copper plate aluminum fins and
these<00:01:15.990> nine<00:01:16.259> 82<00:01:16.470> millimeter<00:01:16.830> fans<00:01:17.009> at<00:01:17.159> 1800

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
these nine 82 millimeter fans at 1800

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.910 
these nine 82 millimeter fans at 1800
rpm<00:01:18.030> you're<00:01:18.570> actually<00:01:18.930> moving<00:01:19.049> forty<00:01:19.650> three

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
rpm you're actually moving forty three

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.730 
rpm you're actually moving forty three
point<00:01:20.159> eight<00:01:20.430> CFM<00:01:21.030> of<00:01:21.210> air<00:01:21.780> through<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.439> fins

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
point eight CFM of air through the fins

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.649 
point eight CFM of air through the fins
and<00:01:22.979> that's<00:01:23.460> gonna<00:01:23.580> actually<00:01:23.729> give<00:01:24.000> you<00:01:24.090> 19

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
and that's gonna actually give you 19

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.690 
and that's gonna actually give you 19
decibels<00:01:25.229> of<00:01:25.380> sound<00:01:25.439> so<00:01:25.770> that's<00:01:25.950> a<00:01:26.159> good

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
decibels of sound so that's a good

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.830 
decibels of sound so that's a good
balance<00:01:26.909> between<00:01:27.290> airflow<00:01:28.290> and<00:01:29.090> loudness<00:01:30.090> or

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
balance between airflow and loudness or

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.020 
balance between airflow and loudness or
how<00:01:31.530> many<00:01:31.680> decibels<00:01:32.009> you<00:01:32.189> have<00:01:32.430> so<00:01:32.670> it's<00:01:32.820> gonna

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
how many decibels you have so it's gonna

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.480 
how many decibels you have so it's gonna
be<00:01:33.180> fairly<00:01:33.450> quiet<00:01:33.840> your<00:01:34.200> product<00:01:35.009> your<00:01:35.220> video

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
be fairly quiet your product your video

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:36.710 
be fairly quiet your product your video
cars<00:01:35.700> probably<00:01:36.000> gonna<00:01:36.090> be<00:01:36.180> louder<00:01:36.360> than<00:01:36.479> this

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
cars probably gonna be louder than this

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.990 
cars probably gonna be louder than this
or<00:01:36.840> your<00:01:36.960> case<00:01:37.140> fans<00:01:37.380> but<00:01:37.680> it<00:01:38.220> does<00:01:38.640> give<00:01:38.850> you

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
or your case fans but it does give you

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.870 
or your case fans but it does give you
you<00:01:39.750> know<00:01:39.780> almost<00:01:40.200> 50<00:01:40.560> CFM<00:01:41.250> of<00:01:41.369> airflow<00:01:41.700> which

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
you know almost 50 CFM of airflow which

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.520 
you know almost 50 CFM of airflow which
is<00:01:42.000> really<00:01:42.450> really<00:01:42.750> good

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
is really really good

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.800 
is really really good
now<00:01:43.950> these<00:01:44.399> fans<00:01:44.670> are<00:01:44.790> rated<00:01:45.000> at<00:01:45.060> 70,000<00:01:45.689> hours

which<00:01:46.259> if<00:01:46.500> you<00:01:46.590> do<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:46.799> math<00:01:46.950> I<00:01:47.100> believe<00:01:47.340> is

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
which if you do the math I believe is

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.060 
which if you do the math I believe is
like<00:01:47.670> just<00:01:48.060> over<00:01:48.299> 2900<00:01:48.960> days<00:01:49.140> just<00:01:49.920> about

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
like just over 2900 days just about

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.670 
like just over 2900 days just about
eight<00:01:50.310> years<00:01:50.640> so<00:01:51.509> really<00:01:52.079> really<00:01:52.320> good<00:01:52.500> and

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
eight years so really really good and

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.859 
eight years so really really good and
that's<00:01:53.640> basically<00:01:54.060> it<00:01:54.270> there's<00:01:54.450> not<00:01:54.600> really

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
that's basically it there's not really

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.660 
that's basically it there's not really
too<00:01:55.020> much<00:01:55.049> more<00:01:55.409> to<00:01:55.500> this<00:01:55.619> it<00:01:56.280> doesn't<00:01:56.579> have

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
too much more to this it doesn't have

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.069 
too much more to this it doesn't have
any<00:01:56.820> pulse<00:01:57.240> width<00:01:57.390> modulation<00:01:57.810> you're<00:01:57.990> gonna

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
any pulse width modulation you're gonna

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.749 
any pulse width modulation you're gonna
plug<00:01:58.350> this<00:01:58.469> in<00:01:58.680> with<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:59.009> connector<00:01:59.610> and

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
plug this in with the connector and

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.639 
plug this in with the connector and
you're<00:02:00.180> good<00:02:00.360> to<00:02:00.509> go<00:02:00.540> the<00:02:01.170> bag<00:02:01.380> you're<00:02:01.560> gonna

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
you're good to go the bag you're gonna

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.709 
you're good to go the bag you're gonna
find<00:02:01.890> plates<00:02:02.219> of<00:02:02.369> brackets<00:02:02.759> for<00:02:03.240> every<00:02:03.570> type

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
find plates of brackets for every type

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.649 
find plates of brackets for every type
of<00:02:03.750> CP<00:02:04.110> you<00:02:04.200> can<00:02:04.350> think<00:02:04.560> of<00:02:04.740> so<00:02:05.189> your<00:02:05.399> AMD<00:02:05.820> chip

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
of CP you can think of so your AMD chip

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.410 
of CP you can think of so your AMD chip
sets<00:02:06.899> or<00:02:07.170> Andy<00:02:07.530> chips<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:07.950> a.m.<00:02:08.280> 2<00:02:08.640> a.m.<00:02:08.940> 2

11:55 1156 and 1366 and you already have
some<00:02:18.000> thermal<00:02:18.870> grease<00:02:19.260> included<00:02:20.010> in<00:02:20.159> the<00:02:20.280> bag

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:20.519 
some thermal grease included in the bag

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:23.690 
some thermal grease included in the bag
and<00:02:21.049> from<00:02:22.049> what<00:02:22.230> I<00:02:22.260> hear<00:02:22.620> this<00:02:23.040> Coolermaster

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
and from what I hear this Coolermaster

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.819 
and from what I hear this Coolermaster
thermal<00:02:23.970> grease<00:02:24.090> is<00:02:24.269> actually<00:02:24.840> really<00:02:25.200> really

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:25.829 
thermal grease is actually really really

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:26.750 
thermal grease is actually really really
good<00:02:26.040> so<00:02:26.129> you<00:02:26.159> don't<00:02:26.220> have<00:02:26.400> to<00:02:26.459> worry<00:02:26.640> about

cool you're gonna see like a 20 or 30

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.259 
cool you're gonna see like a 20 or 30
degree<00:02:49.920> drop<00:02:50.129> in<00:02:50.310> temperatures<00:02:50.730> just<00:02:51.120> by

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
degree drop in temperatures just by

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:53.000 
degree drop in temperatures just by
switching<00:02:51.629> to<00:02:51.659> this<00:02:51.870> and<00:02:52.109> it's<00:02:52.620> not<00:02:52.739> enough

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
switching to this and it's not enough

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.259 
switching to this and it's not enough
that<00:02:53.220> it's<00:02:53.310> just<00:02:53.430> gonna<00:02:53.549> be<00:02:53.730> cooler<00:02:54.000> you<00:02:54.239> can

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
that it's just gonna be cooler you can

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:56.089 
that it's just gonna be cooler you can
feel<00:02:54.629> better<00:02:54.810> about<00:02:54.959> it<00:02:55.170> it's<00:02:55.739> also<00:02:55.920> gonna

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
give you the ability to overclock if you

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:58.190 
give you the ability to overclock if you
want<00:02:57.599> to<00:02:57.659> get<00:02:57.750> a<00:02:57.780> little<00:02:57.900> bit<00:02:58.079> more

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
want to get a little bit more

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.140 
want to get a little bit more
performance<00:02:58.709> but<00:02:58.889> not<00:02:59.310> spend<00:02:59.609> a<00:02:59.670> ton<00:02:59.819> of<00:02:59.879> money

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
performance but not spend a ton of money
