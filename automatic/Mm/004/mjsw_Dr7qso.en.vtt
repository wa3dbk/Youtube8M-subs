00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.800
 Hi, Jorge talks about learning to 

00:00:01.869 --> 00:00:08.000
 drive well 

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:10.730
 let's start a series of videos in 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.850
 which I will tell you the dangers 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:16.340
 when driving my goal is to show them 

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:18.080
 100 dangers while driving but for that 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.779
 I need your collaboration in milestone that I 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.789
 tell you by what dangers avoid 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:24.259
 which dangerous happened or that this 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:26.530
 happens that it can be a danger to 

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:29.610
 drive good 

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:32.470
 let's start with the first let's say 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:35.140
 that are number one or one of the 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.460
 most recurring hazards in which 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:40.330
 We are all drivers very 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:41.820
 exposed and carmen and it is the cell phone the 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:45.550
 cell phone while we drive 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:48.190
 it's definitely something very much of 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:50.830
 very much risk something very dangerous then 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.270
 I would suggest looking into a system 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:55.150
 that you can talk on cell phone 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:58.330
 while they are driving, let's say 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:01:03.570
 can be a device like this in the 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:03.570
 which I can put my cell phone to demonstrate 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:13.259
 here this device allows me to place 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:15.780
 the cell phone and adjust it apart from what 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:18.390
 I will always have in sight what I can 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.899
 connect with a cable from my radio and 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:24.970
 connect it to the cell phone if I could already 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:29.110
 perfectly with this device 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:31.420
 with this cable to talk by cellphone to 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:34.180
 through the speakers then it's a 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.460
 form let's say to have the cell phone to the 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.740
 hand and be able to talk on cell phone then 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.090
 the number one danger one of the 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.720
 most recurrent hazards in which 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.550
 we're 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.380
 let's say reaching all the drivers 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.900
 it's the cell phone 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.900
 remember look for your system be hands 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:54.620
 free to bluetooth whatever hearing aids 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:57.050
 but always have a device for 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.640
 talk by cell phone at hand and they will avoid 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.530
 risks and will suddenly avoid some 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.140
 component see you in the next in 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:06.190
 learn to drive 100 hazards to 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.190
 drive until later
