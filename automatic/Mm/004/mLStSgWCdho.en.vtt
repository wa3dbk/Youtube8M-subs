hi welcome to simply scuba comm in
today's<00:00:06.609> session<00:00:06.970> we're<00:00:07.120> gonna<00:00:07.210> be<00:00:07.300> looking

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:07.420 
today's session we're gonna be looking

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:11.610 
today's session we're gonna be looking
at<00:00:07.599> Oceanics<00:00:08.200> Alfa<00:00:08.950> 8c<00:00:09.160> DX<00:00:09.849> v<00:00:10.240> regulator<00:00:10.929> this

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:11.620 
at Oceanics Alfa 8c DX v regulator this

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:13.799 
at Oceanics Alfa 8c DX v regulator this
is<00:00:11.769> a<00:00:11.799> real<00:00:12.070> workhorse<00:00:12.370> of<00:00:12.879> the<00:00:12.999> oceanic<00:00:13.360> range

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:13.809 
is a real workhorse of the oceanic range

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:17.160 
is a real workhorse of the oceanic range
a<00:00:14.230> balanced<00:00:15.070> diaphragm<00:00:15.610> first<00:00:15.910> stage<00:00:16.209> coupled

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:17.170 
a balanced diaphragm first stage coupled

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:20.010 
a balanced diaphragm first stage coupled
with<00:00:17.380> a<00:00:18.039> standard<00:00:18.580> downstream<00:00:19.210> second<00:00:19.750> stage

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:20.020 
with a standard downstream second stage

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.720 
with a standard downstream second stage
a<00:00:20.410> really<00:00:21.220> good<00:00:21.550> entry<00:00:22.300> level<00:00:22.330> regulator

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
a really good entry level regulator

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.490 
a really good entry level regulator
let's<00:00:24.730> take<00:00:24.910> a<00:00:24.940> closer<00:00:25.300> look<00:00:25.480> then<00:00:25.900> at<00:00:26.080> the<00:00:26.290> c

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:26.500 
let's take a closer look then at the c

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.280 
let's take a closer look then at the c
DX<00:00:26.710> v<00:00:27.010> first<00:00:27.400> stage<00:00:27.730> it's<00:00:28.540> a<00:00:28.720> balanced

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:29.290 
DX v first stage it's a balanced

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:32.429 
DX v first stage it's a balanced
diaphragm<00:00:30.040> regulator<00:00:30.550> which<00:00:31.540> has<00:00:31.810> two

00:00:32.429 --> 00:00:32.439 
diaphragm regulator which has two

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:36.270 
diaphragm regulator which has two
high-pressure<00:00:33.129> ports<00:00:33.730> and<00:00:34.109> four<00:00:35.280> low

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:36.280 
high-pressure ports and four low

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.239 
high-pressure ports and four low
pressure<00:00:36.609> ports<00:00:37.149> this<00:00:37.989> means<00:00:38.260> it's<00:00:38.440> good<00:00:38.769> for

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:39.249 
pressure ports this means it's good for

00:00:39.249 --> 00:00:41.310 
pressure ports this means it's good for
cold<00:00:39.519> water<00:00:39.699> diving<00:00:40.179> where<00:00:40.899> you<00:00:41.019> need<00:00:41.199> the

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:41.320 
cold water diving where you need the

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.029 
cold water diving where you need the
extra<00:00:41.559> hose<00:00:41.949> for<00:00:42.879> your<00:00:43.089> dry<00:00:43.359> suit<00:00:43.769> the<00:00:44.769> actual

00:00:45.029 --> 00:00:45.039 
extra hose for your dry suit the actual

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:48.959 
extra hose for your dry suit the actual
first<00:00:45.280> stage<00:00:45.489> itself<00:00:45.909> is<00:00:46.329> a<00:00:46.390> diaphragm<00:00:47.850> so<00:00:48.850> you

00:00:48.959 --> 00:00:48.969 
first stage itself is a diaphragm so you

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:50.340 
first stage itself is a diaphragm so you
can<00:00:49.120> see<00:00:49.300> here<00:00:49.539> at<00:00:49.690> the<00:00:49.749> bottom<00:00:49.899> this<00:00:50.109> is<00:00:50.170> the

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:50.350 
can see here at the bottom this is the

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.200 
can see here at the bottom this is the
diaphragm<00:00:50.679> section<00:00:51.280> means<00:00:51.879> that<00:00:52.030> if<00:00:52.089> you're

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.210 
diaphragm section means that if you're

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.299 
diaphragm section means that if you're
diving<00:00:52.449> in<00:00:52.719> very<00:00:52.929> dirty<00:00:53.199> or<00:00:53.440> murky<00:00:53.920> waters

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:54.309 
diving in very dirty or murky waters

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:56.160 
diving in very dirty or murky waters
this<00:00:54.760> is<00:00:54.940> a<00:00:54.969> good<00:00:55.269> first<00:00:55.510> stage<00:00:55.809> because<00:00:56.079> it

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170 
this is a good first stage because it

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:57.809 
this is a good first stage because it
keeps<00:00:56.289> the<00:00:56.469> water<00:00:56.620> actually<00:00:57.129> out<00:00:57.370> of<00:00:57.640> the

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:57.819 
keeps the water actually out of the

00:00:57.819 --> 00:00:59.549 
keeps the water actually out of the
workings<00:00:58.300> of<00:00:58.420> the<00:00:58.870> first<00:00:59.109> stage<00:00:59.350> of<00:00:59.379> the

00:00:59.549 --> 00:00:59.559 
workings of the first stage of the

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:03.059 
workings of the first stage of the
regulator<00:01:00.629> this<00:01:01.629> particular<00:01:01.989> version<00:01:02.589> is<00:01:02.710> the

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:03.069 
regulator this particular version is the

00:01:03.069 --> 00:01:06.480 
regulator this particular version is the
din<00:01:03.280> it<00:01:03.819> comes<00:01:04.150> in<00:01:04.449> a<00:01:04.659> din<00:01:04.839> 300<00:01:05.470> bar<00:01:05.650> which<00:01:06.310> is

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490 
din it comes in a din 300 bar which is

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.010 
din it comes in a din 300 bar which is
this<00:01:06.610> particular<00:01:06.790> version<00:01:07.240> or<00:01:07.540> you<00:01:07.689> can<00:01:07.869> get

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.020 
this particular version or you can get

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.459 
this particular version or you can get
the<00:01:08.140> two<00:01:08.320> three<00:01:08.560> to<00:01:08.829> a<00:01:09.070> clamp<00:01:09.909> version<00:01:10.450> it's<00:01:11.290> a

00:01:11.459 --> 00:01:11.469 
the two three to a clamp version it's a

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:15.450 
the two three to a clamp version it's a
very<00:01:11.829> well<00:01:12.219> made<00:01:12.270> brass<00:01:13.270> first<00:01:13.659> stage<00:01:14.460> so

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:15.460 
very well made brass first stage so

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.999 
very well made brass first stage so
let's<00:01:15.700> take<00:01:15.880> a<00:01:15.909> closer<00:01:16.299> look<00:01:16.509> at<00:01:16.930> the<00:01:17.290> oceanic

00:01:17.999 --> 00:01:18.009 
let's take a closer look at the oceanic

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:21.719 
let's take a closer look at the oceanic
alpha<00:01:18.520> eight<00:01:18.729> second<00:01:19.719> stage<00:01:20.340> it's<00:01:21.340> a<00:01:21.490> nice

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:21.729 
alpha eight second stage it's a nice

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:26.670 
alpha eight second stage it's a nice
lightweight<00:01:23.340> plastic<00:01:24.340> second<00:01:24.789> stage<00:01:25.469> with<00:01:26.469> a

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:26.680 
lightweight plastic second stage with a

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.289 
lightweight plastic second stage with a
hose<00:01:27.039> comes<00:01:27.939> in<00:01:28.289> to<00:01:29.289> the<00:01:29.409> second<00:01:29.829> stage

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
hose comes in to the second stage

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.550 
hose comes in to the second stage
operates<00:01:31.299> a<00:01:31.450> standard<00:01:31.810> downstream<00:01:32.530> valve

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
operates a standard downstream valve

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.010 
operates a standard downstream valve
which<00:01:33.460> is<00:01:33.609> just<00:01:33.850> basically<00:01:34.000> and<00:01:34.479> leave<00:01:34.750> up

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
which is just basically and leave up

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.020 
which is just basically and leave up
that<00:01:35.439> when<00:01:35.619> you<00:01:35.770> breathe<00:01:36.009> in<00:01:36.039> sucks<00:01:36.880> the

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
that when you breathe in sucks the

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.080 
that when you breathe in sucks the
diaphragm<00:01:37.570> in<00:01:37.780> and<00:01:37.960> supplies<00:01:38.890> the<00:01:39.189> air<00:01:39.310> to<00:01:39.939> the

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
diaphragm in and supplies the air to the
