00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:08.189
 I'm going to show you a twist 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:12.440
 I must have got the hair a bit wet and wet 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.440
 then we go a ponytail of gold 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.970
 on 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:48.710
 well a ponytail that stands 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:52.760
 derek in two pick that club that 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:55.030
 Brush your injustice and then understood to 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.030
 to turn 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:09.760
 the other and this scenario 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:17.479
 I turn them all to the same 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:19.880
 coaching all we praise left 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:22.190
 now I have twisted between two 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:25.810
 which I am going in the opposite direction 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.810
 clockwise 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:41.540
 in the meantime the other side is turning 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:46.810
 learned a bit and now you have a twister 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.810
 tail that secures itself with an elastic band 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:00.020
 actually this is also a whole haircut like 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.810
 you by a blog hop that you no 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:05.830
 original street 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:10.120
 this time I was going to turn a club 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:14.380
 just turn around loosely 

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:14.380
 grab a pair of sliders 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.940
 and it is stuck 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:30.980
 two toys and if you like post before 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:33.550
 the firmness to this comes quite another 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.550
 slide pin 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:50.340
 we take the hook now and I put it there 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:54.050
 above and so you have very simple and 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.050
 very quickly a twister with
