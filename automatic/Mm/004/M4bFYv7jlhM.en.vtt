00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.540
 at the awards ceremony the arbitrators already in the 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:08.099
 viewfinder you ca n't have another kick 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.250
 in Italy except this short 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:13.320
 the one of the velini the best the match 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.820
 they have seen it so it is difficult for me 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.699
 to judge 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.710
 then certainly they are so unpleasant yes 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.570
 part I hope these are 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.300
 teaching of what one should not 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.609
 do for a future if they do 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.090
 at the beginning then we understand that we must 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.090
 to change 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:34.140
 as a last thing I wanted to ask if 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:37.430
 an idea has been made 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:41.579
 now that there have been the first sentences 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:43.620
 of this umpteenth scandal of the 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.440
 let's love it as you wish 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.200
 wager if we are already at one point 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:55.020
 which you can say something or if you prefer 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:59.670
 I don't know how to wait for the end of it all 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:01.680
 so far I do not understand not without part that 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.140
 I haven't read the papers so I can't 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.840
 talk about what I thought though 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:12.510
 if you want to eradicate if you want 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:15.170
 eliminate this thing you need to be more 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.170
 I decided 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:21.850
 Please have a curiosity about suspensions 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.009
 of coaches 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:29.020
 there is a disqualified player for either 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:31.880
 a day both for a year does not play 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:34.390
 a disqualified coach can train 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:40.460
 but not going to the bench doesn't look like it 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:43.039
 a little strange thing that is if there is any 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:46.549
 one also the disqualified player if 

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:49.039
 at least in words then the speech if that 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:55.840
 there is a long time disqualification I think 

00:01:49.039 --> 00:02:03.490
 that you shouldn't train that 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:03.490
 so long but you 've got three months
