00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
might try something cheesy here maybe a

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.020 
might try something cheesy here maybe a
cannon<00:00:52.140> rush<00:00:52.350> you<00:00:52.829> know<00:00:52.949> what<00:00:53.129> cannon<00:00:53.610> rushing

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
cannon rush you know what cannon rushing

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.319 
cannon rush you know what cannon rushing
is<00:00:54.180> probably<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.289> most<00:00:55.559> abused<00:00:56.460> cheese<00:00:56.910> you

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
is probably the most abused cheese you

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.330 
is probably the most abused cheese you
probably<00:00:57.600> introduce<00:00:58.109> our<00:00:58.379> our<00:00:58.800> people<00:00:59.010> here<00:00:59.309> I

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
probably introduce our our people here I

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.709 
probably introduce our our people here I
think<00:00:59.579> one<00:00:59.699> of<00:00:59.789> those<00:00:59.940> rare<00:01:00.239> yeah<00:01:00.449> who's<00:01:00.629> the

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
think one of those rare yeah who's the

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.290 
think one of those rare yeah who's the
other<00:01:00.840> guy<00:01:01.079> Raven<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:01.739> stick<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:02.820> move<00:01:02.969> stick

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
other guy Raven and stick and move stick

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.340 
other guy Raven and stick and move stick
and<00:01:03.539> move<00:01:03.750> and<00:01:04.379> he<00:01:04.500> got<00:01:04.619> his<00:01:04.860> entire<00:01:05.309> SCV<00:01:06.350> would

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
and move and he got his entire SCV would

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.929 
and move and he got his entire SCV would
you<00:01:07.470> count<00:01:07.799> off<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.070> line<00:01:08.400> yeah<00:01:08.700> that's

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
you count off the line yeah that's

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.130 
you count off the line yeah that's
probably<00:01:09.060> not<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.360> smartest<00:01:09.570> thing<00:01:09.960> to<00:01:09.990> do

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
probably not the smartest thing to do

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.469 
probably not the smartest thing to do
but<00:01:10.320> he<00:01:10.470> will<00:01:10.650> get<00:01:10.799> rid<00:01:10.950> of<00:01:11.010> this<00:01:12.229> um<00:01:14.450> did<00:01:15.450> that
