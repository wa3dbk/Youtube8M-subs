00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
exactly what to do with their lead in

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.689 
exactly what to do with their lead in
the<00:00:57.390> mid<00:00:57.600> game<00:00:57.840> and<00:00:58.079> gambit<00:00:58.920> just<00:00:59.340> fell

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
the mid game and gambit just fell

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.099 
the mid game and gambit just fell
completely<00:00:59.730> apart<00:01:00.300> and<00:01:00.660> it<00:01:00.719> found<00:01:00.899> their

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
completely apart and it found their

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.990 
completely apart and it found their
skirmishes<00:01:01.680> where<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:01.890> skirmishes<00:01:02.640> or<00:01:02.879> they

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
skirmishes where the skirmishes or they

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.850 
skirmishes where the skirmishes or they
shouldn't<00:01:03.300> well<00:01:03.690> I<00:01:03.840> mean<00:01:04.019> if<00:01:04.170> you<00:01:04.320> do<00:01:04.589> have

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
shouldn't well I mean if you do have

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.190 
shouldn't well I mean if you do have
that<00:01:04.890> teleport<00:01:05.820> coming<00:01:06.270> in<00:01:06.420> on<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.570> Diana<00:01:07.020> it

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
that teleport coming in on the Diana it

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.340 
that teleport coming in on the Diana it
just<00:01:07.409> depends<00:01:07.830> on<00:01:07.950> whether<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.310> team

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
just depends on whether the team

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.480 
just depends on whether the team
overextends<00:01:10.350> so<00:01:10.500> you<00:01:10.590> can<00:01:10.770> actually<00:01:10.950> pick<00:01:11.460> up

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
overextends so you can actually pick up

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.330 
overextends so you can actually pick up
those<00:01:11.790> kills<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:12.570> I<00:01:13.229> think<00:01:13.830> that's<00:01:13.979> exactly

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
those kills and I think that's exactly

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.320 
those kills and I think that's exactly
what<00:01:14.490> we<00:01:14.610> saw<00:01:14.760> but<00:01:14.970> it's<00:01:15.420> I<00:01:15.740> think<00:01:16.740> against<00:01:17.189> a

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.330 
what we saw but it's I think against a

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.510 
what we saw but it's I think against a
really<00:01:18.330> top<00:01:18.570> tier<00:01:18.869> team<00:01:19.110> that's<00:01:19.409> not<00:01:19.680> really

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
really top tier team that's not really

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.130 
really top tier team that's not really
going<00:01:20.759> to<00:01:20.850> happen<00:01:21.090> quite<00:01:21.509> so<00:01:21.720> much<00:01:21.900> and<00:01:22.110> I

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
going to happen quite so much and I

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.630 
going to happen quite so much and I
think<00:01:22.350> it<00:01:22.409> was<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.680> really<00:01:22.920> heavy<00:01:23.070> skirmish

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
think it was the really heavy skirmish

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.370 
think it was the really heavy skirmish
style<00:01:23.970> of<00:01:24.240> this<00:01:24.390> game<00:01:24.630> that<00:01:24.810> allowed<00:01:25.080> it<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.259> be

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
style of this game that allowed it to be

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.630 
style of this game that allowed it to be
more<00:01:25.530> successful<00:01:25.740> yeah<00:01:26.100> and<00:01:26.250> something<00:01:26.430> that

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
more successful yeah and something that

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.490 
more successful yeah and something that
worked<00:01:26.850> into<00:01:27.150> favor<00:01:27.450> of<00:01:27.780> world<00:01:28.049> elite<00:01:28.229> is<00:01:28.409> the

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
worked into favor of world elite is the

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.800 
worked into favor of world elite is the
fact<00:01:28.680> that<00:01:28.740> they<00:01:28.890> had<00:01:29.040> three<00:01:29.490> Global's<00:01:30.030> to

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
fact that they had three Global's to

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.630 
fact that they had three Global's to
teleport<00:01:31.259> Senor<00:01:31.560> solo<00:01:31.680> lanes<00:01:32.009> as<00:01:32.189> well<00:01:32.310> as<00:01:32.430> Rex

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
teleport Senor solo lanes as well as Rex

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.219 
teleport Senor solo lanes as well as Rex
I<00:01:32.790> with<00:01:32.909> that<00:01:33.060> void<00:01:33.240> rush<00:01:33.509> so<00:01:33.930> there<00:01:34.079> was<00:01:34.200> a

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
I with that void rush so there was a

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.210 
I with that void rush so there was a
number<00:01:34.470> of<00:01:34.619> teleports<00:01:35.040> that<00:01:35.159> were

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
number of teleports that were

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
teleports that were good simply because

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.490 
teleports that were good simply because
of<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:38.939> fact<00:01:39.090> will<00:01:39.270> delete<00:01:39.659> had<00:01:39.900> more<00:01:40.200> tools

of the fact will delete had more tools

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.590 
of the fact will delete had more tools
at<00:01:40.710> their<00:01:40.799> advantage<00:01:41.280> if<00:01:41.700> you<00:01:41.850> can<00:01:42.030> fling<00:01:42.390> more

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
going to come out ahead and that's

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.760 
going to come out ahead and that's
basically<00:01:47.939> what<00:01:48.329> happened<00:01:48.659> gallica<00:01:49.439> bullied

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
basically what happened gallica bullied

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.350 
basically what happened gallica bullied
around<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.130> map<00:01:50.310> there<00:01:50.670> was<00:01:50.820> mistakes<00:01:51.210> on

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
around the map there was mistakes on

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.230 
around the map there was mistakes on
both<00:01:51.390> sides<00:01:51.930> of<00:01:52.250> the<00:01:53.250> rift<00:01:53.430> which<00:01:53.909> you<00:01:54.030> can't

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
both sides of the rift which you can't

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.050 
both sides of the rift which you can't
deny<00:01:54.450> but<00:01:55.320> once<00:01:56.219> will<00:01:56.430> delete<00:01:56.610> got<00:01:56.759> a<00:01:56.790> hit<00:01:56.969> they

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
deny but once will delete got a hit they

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.819 
deny but once will delete got a hit they
did<00:01:57.299> play<00:01:57.420> graceful<00:01:57.719> you<00:01:57.930> that's<00:01:58.110> a<00:01:58.170> 15-minute

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
did play graceful you that's a 15-minute

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.859 
did play graceful you that's a 15-minute
win<00:01:59.009> it's<00:01:59.579> relatively<00:02:00.210> quick<00:02:00.540> if<00:02:00.719> you

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
win it's relatively quick if you

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.420 
win it's relatively quick if you
actually<00:02:01.049> look<00:02:01.229> at<00:02:01.439> the<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.829> big<00:02:02.009> picture<00:02:02.219> of

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
actually look at the the big picture of

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.370 
actually look at the the big picture of
the<00:02:02.520> day<00:02:02.670> so<00:02:03.149> I<00:02:03.180> think<00:02:03.450> credits<00:02:04.020> a<00:02:04.079> world<00:02:04.229> elite

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
the day so I think credits a world elite

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.990 
the day so I think credits a world elite
I<00:02:04.560> mean<00:02:04.710> I<00:02:04.799> think<00:02:04.829> if<00:02:05.100> we're<00:02:05.310> talking<00:02:05.670> about

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
I mean I think if we're talking about

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.300 
I mean I think if we're talking about
who<00:02:06.090> can<00:02:06.119> flame<00:02:06.479> more<00:02:06.689> than

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
who can flame more than

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.080 
who can flame more than
shows<00:02:07.640> how<00:02:08.050> stone<00:02:09.050> age<00:02:09.289> perhaps<00:02:09.590> EK<00:02:10.069> was<00:02:10.340> but

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
shows how stone age perhaps EK was but

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.960 
shows how stone age perhaps EK was but
um<00:02:11.270> i<00:02:11.480> think<00:02:11.599> one<00:02:11.989> of<00:02:12.020> the<00:02:12.170> most<00:02:12.970> disappointing

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
um i think one of the most disappointing

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:15.460 
um i think one of the most disappointing
things<00:02:14.209> is<00:02:14.330> the<00:02:14.420> fact<00:02:14.630> that<00:02:14.690> they<00:02:14.840> did<00:02:15.170> put

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
things is the fact that they did put

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.559 
things is the fact that they did put
cabbage<00:02:15.770> art<00:02:16.069> on<00:02:16.160> the<00:02:16.250> morgue<00:02:16.430> on<00:02:16.580> top<00:02:16.940> and<00:02:17.239> you

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:17.569 
cabbage art on the morgue on top and you

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:19.540 
cabbage art on the morgue on top and you
saw<00:02:17.900> that<00:02:17.930> even<00:02:18.410> though<00:02:18.530> he<00:02:18.739> had<00:02:18.980> a<00:02:19.010> good<00:02:19.280> lead

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
saw that even though he had a good lead

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.610 
saw that even though he had a good lead
in<00:02:19.700> the<00:02:19.819> beginning<00:02:20.330> you're<00:02:20.989> not<00:02:21.230> able<00:02:21.410> to

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
in the beginning you're not able to

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.320 
in the beginning you're not able to
punish<00:02:21.860> a<00:02:21.950> look<00:02:22.130> and<00:02:22.280> look<00:02:22.489> and<00:02:22.640> look<00:02:22.700> really

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330

the<00:04:38.300> bands<00:04:38.540> that<00:04:38.810> GE<00:04:39.250> levied<00:04:40.250> at<00:04:40.370> them<00:04:40.640> in<00:04:40.850> that

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060 
the bands that GE levied at them in that

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.090 
the bands that GE levied at them in that
game<00:04:41.450> that<00:04:41.690> could<00:04:41.960> be<00:04:42.110> a<00:04:42.140> roadmap<00:04:42.590> for<00:04:42.620> success

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:43.100 
game that could be a roadmap for success

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:45.370 
game that could be a roadmap for success
for<00:04:43.310> other<00:04:43.430> teams<00:04:43.790> but<00:04:44.360> I<00:04:44.600> mean<00:04:44.750> if<00:04:45.110> I<00:04:45.200> have<00:04:45.290> to

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:45.380 
for other teams but I mean if I have to

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:47.080 
for other teams but I mean if I have to
look<00:04:45.500> at<00:04:45.620> it<00:04:45.740> early<00:04:46.220> on<00:04:46.250> in<00:04:46.550> this<00:04:46.670> one<00:04:46.880> to<00:04:47.000> be

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.090 
look at it early on in this one to be

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:48.820 
look at it early on in this one to be
it's<00:04:47.240> looking<00:04:47.540> more<00:04:47.690> and<00:04:47.750> more<00:04:47.870> like<00:04:48.140> a<00:04:48.170> GE<00:04:48.440> TS

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830 
it's looking more and more like a GE TS

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:50.890 
it's looking more and more like a GE TS
