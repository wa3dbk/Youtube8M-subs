women have those false fingernails that
they<00:01:07.500> wear<00:01:07.740> this<00:01:08.549> is<00:01:08.790> a<00:01:08.990> fast<00:01:09.990> fingernail<00:01:10.619> for

they wear this is a fast fingernail for
the<00:01:11.130> tooth<00:01:11.369> that's<00:01:11.969> custom-made<00:01:12.659> to<00:01:13.020> fit<00:01:13.049> over

00:01:13.249 --> 00:01:13.259 
the tooth that's custom-made to fit over

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:15.740 
the tooth that's custom-made to fit over
the<00:01:14.130> existing<00:01:14.429> tooth<00:01:14.909> and<00:01:15.149> it's<00:01:15.270> glued<00:01:15.570> or

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
the existing tooth and it's glued or

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.760 
the existing tooth and it's glued or
bonded<00:01:16.170> to<00:01:16.289> the<00:01:16.409> tooth<00:01:18.140> veneer<00:01:19.140> of<00:01:19.170> the

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.239 
bonded to the tooth veneer of the
Lumineers<00:01:20.490> I<00:01:20.759> think<00:01:21.479> work<00:01:22.469> in<00:01:22.710> certain<00:01:23.070> cases

00:01:23.239 --> 00:01:23.249 
Lumineers I think work in certain cases

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:25.669 
Lumineers I think work in certain cases
but<00:01:23.759> they<00:01:24.179> do<00:01:24.240> have<00:01:24.570> thickness<00:01:25.109> to<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.439> tooth

00:01:25.669 --> 00:01:25.679 
but they do have thickness to the tooth

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:29.510 
but they do have thickness to the tooth
if<00:01:25.890> you're<00:01:26.189> not<00:01:26.780> reducing<00:01:27.780> any<00:01:28.280> enamel<00:01:29.280> right

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
if you're not reducing any enamel right

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.200 
if you're not reducing any enamel right
so<00:01:30.210> if<00:01:30.420> you<00:01:30.630> are<00:01:30.749> trying<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:31.579> build<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:32.909> tooth

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
so if you are trying to build the tooth

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.649 
so if you are trying to build the tooth
that's<00:01:33.509> 24<00:01:34.409> in<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:35.280> you're<00:01:36.060> trying<00:01:36.299> to<00:01:36.420> build

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
that's 24 in and you're trying to build

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.779 
that's 24 in and you're trying to build
it<00:01:36.840> out<00:01:36.990> to<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.469> other<00:01:37.590> teeth<00:01:37.979> that<00:01:38.310> works

00:01:38.779 --> 00:01:38.789 
it out to the other teeth that works

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:41.359 
it out to the other teeth that works
fine<00:01:39.090> but<00:01:39.479> if<00:01:40.200> you're<00:01:40.380> doing<00:01:40.740> a<00:01:40.890> series<00:01:41.340> of

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
fine but if you're doing a series of

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.239 
fine but if you're doing a series of
veneers<00:01:42.030> and<00:01:42.479> you're<00:01:43.109> adding<00:01:43.619> Lumineers<00:01:44.159> and

00:01:44.239 --> 00:01:44.249 
veneers and you're adding Lumineers and

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:46.429 
veneers and you're adding Lumineers and
you're<00:01:44.520> not<00:01:44.609> really<00:01:44.880> reducing<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:46.229> thickness

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
you're not really reducing the thickness

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:51.830 
you're not really reducing the thickness
of<00:01:46.859> the<00:01:47.009> T<00:01:48.109> the<00:01:49.219> Lumineers<00:01:50.219> all<00:01:50.490> look<00:01:50.999> matched

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
of the T the Lumineers all look matched

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.160 
of the T the Lumineers all look matched
but<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.560> teeth<00:01:53.130> will<00:01:53.460> be<00:01:53.639> much<00:01:54.359> thicker<00:01:54.749> and

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
but the teeth will be much thicker and

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.800 
but the teeth will be much thicker and
you're<00:01:56.039> going<00:01:56.219> to<00:01:56.280> push<00:01:56.520> out<00:01:56.789> the<00:01:57.270> patient's

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
you're going to push out the patient's

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.279 
you're going to push out the patient's
lip<00:01:58.049> and<00:01:59.009> see<00:01:59.189> also<00:01:59.729> would<00:02:00.149> you<00:02:00.179> see<00:02:00.420> I<00:02:00.630> William

Tyndale<00:02:01.679> would<00:02:01.859> use<00:02:02.069> Lumineers<00:02:02.579> and<00:02:03.030> very

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
Tyndale would use Lumineers and very

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.620 
Tyndale would use Lumineers and very

teeth<00:02:39.290> or<00:02:39.470> one<00:02:39.650> color<00:02:39.980> where<00:02:40.370> our<00:02:40.580> teeth<00:02:40.850> are

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
teeth or one color where our teeth are

teeth or one color where our teeth are
multiple<00:02:41.540> colors<00:02:41.960> and<00:02:42.490> individual<00:02:43.490> piece

multiple colors and individual piece

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:47.260 
multiple colors and individual piece
don't<00:02:45.160> actually<00:02:46.160> match<00:02:46.340> some<00:02:46.760> teeth<00:02:47.000> or<00:02:47.240> a

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270 
don't actually match some teeth or a

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:49.960 
don't actually match some teeth or a
shade<00:02:47.600> darker<00:02:47.630> than<00:02:48.230> others<00:02:48.680> in<00:02:48.860> the<00:02:48.950> mouth<00:02:49.130> so

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
shade darker than others in the mouth so

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.540 
shade darker than others in the mouth so
the<00:02:50.720> problem<00:02:51.020> is<00:02:51.350> if<00:02:51.650> you<00:02:51.770> get<00:02:51.950> a<00:02:51.980> series<00:02:52.520> of

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
the problem is if you get a series of

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:57.570 
the problem is if you get a series of
Lumineers<00:02:53.890> if<00:02:54.890> they're<00:02:55.220> not<00:02:56.530> absolutely

Lumineers if they're not absolutely

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:00.160 
Lumineers if they're not absolutely
exquisitely<00:02:58.580> done<00:02:58.910> they<00:02:59.180> tend<00:02:59.630> to<00:02:59.780> look<00:02:59.900> like

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
exquisitely done they tend to look like

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.280 
exquisitely done they tend to look like
Chiclets<00:03:00.680> and<00:03:00.860> some<00:03:01.130> patients<00:03:02.290> the

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
Chiclets and some patients the

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.270 
Chiclets and some patients the
alternative<00:03:03.320> is<00:03:04.310> your<00:03:04.610> natural<00:03:05.800> plug<00:03:06.800> veneer

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
alternative is your natural plug veneer

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.910 
alternative is your natural plug veneer
which<00:03:07.970> is<00:03:08.270> press<00:03:08.690> porcelain<00:03:09.350> where<00:03:09.590> you<00:03:09.710> have

which is press porcelain where you have

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.300 
which is press porcelain where you have

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
a natural tooth so in most aesthetic

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:33.900 
a natural tooth so in most aesthetic
cases<00:03:29.150> I<00:03:29.360> like<00:03:29.630> to<00:03:29.840> do<00:03:30.100> that<00:03:31.100> prep<00:03:31.610> type<00:03:31.970> left

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910

annear<00:03:38.020> okay<00:03:39.020> so<00:03:39.800> basically<00:03:40.040> what<00:03:40.460> you're

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:40.490 
annear okay so basically what you're

annear okay so basically what you're
saying<00:03:40.670> is<00:03:41.090> that<00:03:41.300> the<00:03:41.480> cows<00:03:41.780> the<00:03:42.140> Lumia<00:03:42.680> is<00:03:43.960> so

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:44.960 
saying is that the cows the Lumia is so

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.690 
saying is that the cows the Lumia is so
thin<00:03:45.260> that<00:03:45.290> it<00:03:45.590> can<00:03:45.860> be<00:03:45.980> put<00:03:46.160> on<00:03:46.430> on<00:03:46.580> the

existing tools without grinding it down

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:50.350 
existing tools without grinding it down
it<00:03:48.830> has<00:03:49.010> here<00:03:49.340> and<00:03:49.430> there<00:03:49.550> some<00:03:49.760> advantages

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360 
it has here and there some advantages

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.770 
it has here and there some advantages
but<00:03:50.840> at<00:03:51.020> the<00:03:51.140> same<00:03:51.410> token<00:03:51.940> you<00:03:52.940> won't<00:03:53.510> get<00:03:53.750> a

but at the same token you won't get a

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.220 
but at the same token you won't get a
real<00:03:54.200> shade<00:03:54.860> color<00:03:55.340> in<00:03:56.090> shape<00:03:56.540> you<00:03:56.960> actually

um yes most papers you'll get an

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.310 
um yes most papers you'll get an
improvement<00:04:18.920> but<00:04:19.370> probably<00:04:20.209> it's<00:04:20.900> kind<00:04:21.230> of

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:21.320 
improvement but probably it's kind of

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.270 
improvement but probably it's kind of
straw<00:04:21.590> for<00:04:22.130> us<00:04:22.610> I'm<00:04:22.970> sorry<00:04:23.270> for

straw for us I'm sorry for

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:29.720 
straw for us I'm sorry for
of<00:04:24.670> ideal<00:04:26.430> expectations<00:04:27.630> got<00:04:28.630> it<00:04:28.780> got<00:04:29.590> it

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:29.730 
of ideal expectations got it got it

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:32.070 
of ideal expectations got it got it
instead<00:04:30.730> of<00:04:30.760> big<00:04:30.970> price<00:04:31.270> difference<00:04:31.600> in<00:04:31.960> those

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
instead of big price difference in those

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.070 
instead of big price difference in those
two<00:04:32.139> but<00:04:32.860> why<00:04:33.040> people<00:04:33.460> you<00:04:34.270> know<00:04:34.450> though<00:04:34.690> it's

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.080 
two but why people you know though it's

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.159 
two but why people you know though it's
one<00:04:35.290> or<00:04:35.500> the<00:04:35.530> other<00:04:35.620> one<00:04:36.810> no<00:04:37.810> there<00:04:38.050> really

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:38.169 
one or the other one no there really

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:40.170 
one or the other one no there really
isn't<00:04:38.680> a<00:04:38.710> big<00:04:38.740> price<00:04:39.130> difference<00:04:39.460> I<00:04:39.790> think<00:04:40.060> the

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:40.180 
isn't a big price difference I think the

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:41.850 
isn't a big price difference I think the
reason<00:04:40.360> people<00:04:40.750> do<00:04:41.080> one<00:04:41.290> more<00:04:41.470> than<00:04:41.710> the<00:04:41.740> other

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
reason people do one more than the other

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.580
