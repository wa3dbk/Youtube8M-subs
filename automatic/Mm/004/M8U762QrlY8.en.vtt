demo of Google Goggles for the iPhone
and<00:00:06.180> iPod<00:00:06.420> Touch<00:00:06.899> I<00:00:07.170> believe<00:00:07.799> it<00:00:07.919> works<00:00:08.010> on<00:00:08.220> the

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
and iPod Touch I believe it works on the

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.549 
and iPod Touch I believe it works on the
touch<00:00:08.550> I<00:00:08.880> cannot<00:00:09.599> confirm<00:00:09.809> that<00:00:10.170> but<00:00:10.320> I<00:00:10.410> don't

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
touch I cannot confirm that but I don't

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:11.089 
touch I cannot confirm that but I don't
see<00:00:10.679> why<00:00:10.830> not

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
see why not

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:12.709 
see why not
since<00:00:11.429> the<00:00:11.610> newest<00:00:11.910> model<00:00:12.210> has<00:00:12.330> a<00:00:12.360> built-in

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
since the newest model has a built-in

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.690 
since the newest model has a built-in
camera<00:00:12.900> which<00:00:13.170> is<00:00:13.290> nice<00:00:13.440> so<00:00:14.250> anyway<00:00:14.519> what

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
camera which is nice so anyway what

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.880 
camera which is nice so anyway what
Google<00:00:15.000> Goggles<00:00:15.480> is<00:00:15.839> first<00:00:16.230> of<00:00:16.350> all<00:00:16.440> besides<00:00:16.800> a

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
Google Goggles is first of all besides a

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.460 
Google Goggles is first of all besides a
mouthful<00:00:17.279> is<00:00:17.580> it's<00:00:18.570> built<00:00:18.810> into<00:00:19.080> the<00:00:19.170> Google

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
mouthful is it's built into the Google

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.410 
mouthful is it's built into the Google
mobile<00:00:19.590> app<00:00:19.890> for<00:00:20.070> iPhone<00:00:20.460> and<00:00:20.580> iPod<00:00:20.820> Touch<00:00:21.090> and

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
mobile app for iPhone and iPod Touch and

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.269 
mobile app for iPhone and iPod Touch and
essentially<00:00:22.289> what<00:00:22.439> it<00:00:22.500> does<00:00:22.529> is<00:00:22.680> it<00:00:23.070> allows

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
essentially what it does is it allows

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:24.710 
essentially what it does is it allows
you<00:00:23.340> to<00:00:23.519> take<00:00:23.670> pictures<00:00:23.699> of<00:00:24.060> objects<00:00:24.600> in

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
you to take pictures of objects in

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.410 
you to take pictures of objects in
architecture<00:00:25.350> and<00:00:25.529> I<00:00:26.250> believe<00:00:26.670> people<00:00:27.029> I

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
architecture and I believe people I

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:28.400 
architecture and I believe people I
don't<00:00:27.570> know<00:00:27.660> if<00:00:27.720> they<00:00:27.810> have<00:00:27.930> that<00:00:27.960> unlocked

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
don't know if they have that unlocked

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.349 
don't know if they have that unlocked
yet<00:00:28.710> due<00:00:28.920> to<00:00:29.039> privacy<00:00:29.220> concerns<00:00:29.849> for<00:00:30.060> obvious

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
yet due to privacy concerns for obvious

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.840 
yet due to privacy concerns for obvious
reasons<00:00:30.720> but<00:00:31.560> basically<00:00:32.040> what<00:00:32.250> it<00:00:32.340> does<00:00:32.369> is<00:00:32.640> it

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
reasons but basically what it does is it

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.030 
reasons but basically what it does is it
allows<00:00:32.880> you<00:00:33.390> to<00:00:33.420> capture<00:00:33.630> images<00:00:34.170> and<00:00:34.440> then<00:00:34.890> it

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
allows you to capture images and then it

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.590 
allows you to capture images and then it
fetches<00:00:35.280> that<00:00:35.550> information<00:00:36.030> from<00:00:36.239> Google

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
fetches that information from Google

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.930 
fetches that information from Google

doesn't really make sense unless there's
a<00:01:43.500> pumpkin<00:01:43.860> in<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.009> water<00:01:44.220> which<00:01:44.909> we<00:01:45.090> wouldn't

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
a pumpkin in the water which we wouldn't

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:52.280 
a pumpkin in the water which we wouldn't
really<00:01:45.659> make<00:01:45.899> sense<00:01:46.250> what's<00:01:47.250> this<00:01:50.090> okay<00:01:51.290> this

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
really make sense what's this okay this

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.109 
really make sense what's this okay this
is<00:01:52.409> a<00:01:52.439> pretty<00:01:52.710> bad<00:01:52.890> demos<00:01:53.280> you<00:01:53.670> can<00:01:53.820> see<00:01:53.970> it's

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
is a pretty bad demos you can see it's

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.760 
is a pretty bad demos you can see it's
far<00:01:54.329> from<00:01:54.540> perfect<00:01:54.750> but<00:01:54.960> it's<00:01:55.229> certainly<00:01:55.500> fun

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
far from perfect but it's certainly fun

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.230 
far from perfect but it's certainly fun
now<00:01:56.670> let's<00:01:56.909> take<00:01:57.119> a<00:01:57.149> picture<00:01:57.450> of<00:01:57.840> this<00:01:59.060> this<00:02:00.060> is

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
now let's take a picture of this this is

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.999 
now let's take a picture of this this is
a<00:02:00.270> little<00:02:00.540> harder<00:02:00.840> I<00:02:03.350> know<00:02:04.350> I'm<00:02:04.530> off<00:02:04.680> camera

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
a little harder I know I'm off camera

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:05.990 
a little harder I know I'm off camera
right<00:02:05.130> now<00:02:05.159> but<00:02:05.369> there<00:02:05.490> it<00:02:05.579> is<00:02:05.640> there's<00:02:05.939> the

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
right now but there it is there's the

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.869 
right now but there it is there's the
pumpkin<00:02:06.360> with<00:02:06.509> a<00:02:06.570> hat<00:02:07.099> and<00:02:09.349> no<00:02:10.580> that's<00:02:11.580> pretty

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
pumpkin with a hat and no that's pretty

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:14.120 
pumpkin with a hat and no that's pretty
bad<00:02:12.410> okay

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
bad okay

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:15.800 
bad okay
let's<00:02:14.250> give<00:02:14.430> Google<00:02:14.730> Goggles<00:02:14.910> a<00:02:15.210> better<00:02:15.450> and

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
let's give Google Goggles a better and

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.990 
let's give Google Goggles a better and
easier<00:02:16.050> example<00:02:16.410> and<00:02:17.130> take<00:02:17.430> a<00:02:17.460> picture<00:02:17.790> of<00:02:17.910> a

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
easier example and take a picture of a

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.610 
easier example and take a picture of a
more<00:02:18.150> iconic<00:02:18.570> object<00:02:19.080> and<00:02:19.230> that<00:02:19.260> is<00:02:19.500> the

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
more iconic object and that is the

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.120 
more iconic object and that is the
fifth-generation<00:02:19.950> iPod<00:02:21.860> so<00:02:22.860> let's<00:02:22.980> take<00:02:23.100> a

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
fifth-generation iPod so let's take a

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.350 
fifth-generation iPod so let's take a
picture<00:02:23.370> of<00:02:23.550> that<00:02:24.800> this<00:02:25.800> should<00:02:26.100> work<00:02:26.340> and<00:02:26.610> if

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
picture of that this should work and if

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.460 
picture of that this should work and if
it<00:02:27.420> doesn't<00:02:27.480> I<00:02:27.900> will<00:02:27.960> be<00:02:28.140> amazed<00:02:29.780> and<00:02:30.780> I'm

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
it doesn't I will be amazed and I'm

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.390 
it doesn't I will be amazed and I'm
amazed<00:02:32.900> it<00:02:33.900> took<00:02:34.080> a<00:02:34.110> picture<00:02:34.380> of<00:02:34.530> an<00:02:34.920> old<00:02:35.130> phone

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
amazed it took a picture of an old phone

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:41.120 
amazed it took a picture of an old phone
of<00:02:36.390> some<00:02:36.690> sorts<00:02:39.020> well<00:02:40.020> it<00:02:40.380> almost<00:02:40.620> goddamn

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
of some sorts well it almost goddamn

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:42.560 
of some sorts well it almost goddamn
took<00:02:41.370> a<00:02:41.400> picture<00:02:41.730> of<00:02:41.820> a<00:02:41.880> MacBook

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
took a picture of a MacBook

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.920 
took a picture of a MacBook
that's<00:02:42.840> an<00:02:42.960> Apple<00:02:43.200> product<00:02:43.760> but<00:02:44.760> obviously<00:02:45.660> it

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
that's an Apple product but obviously it

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.020 
that's an Apple product but obviously it
doesn't<00:02:46.170> technically<00:02:46.710> know<00:02:47.040> that<00:02:47.340> it<00:02:47.610> should

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
doesn't technically know that it should

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.150 
doesn't technically know that it should
have<00:02:48.150> came<00:02:48.360> up<00:02:48.480> with<00:02:48.630> iPods<00:02:49.110> so<00:02:49.860> let's<00:02:50.010> try

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
have came up with iPods so let's try

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.040 
have came up with iPods so let's try
that<00:02:50.280> one<00:02:50.400> more<00:02:50.430> time<00:02:50.730> this<00:02:51.450> is<00:02:51.510> certainly<00:02:51.930> a

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
that one more time this is certainly a

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.440 
that one more time this is certainly a
demo<00:02:52.410> fail<00:02:52.730> but<00:02:53.730> that's<00:02:53.940> why<00:02:54.060> I'm<00:02:54.180> doing<00:02:54.300> this

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
demo fail but that's why I'm doing this

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:55.730 
demo fail but that's why I'm doing this
video<00:02:54.600> because<00:02:54.870> it's<00:02:55.080> kind<00:02:55.260> of<00:02:55.320> fun<00:02:55.560> though

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:55.740 
video because it's kind of fun though

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:00.830 
video because it's kind of fun though
experience<00:02:56.310> real<00:02:56.520> time<00:02:58.970> and<00:02:59.970> now<00:03:00.240> it<00:03:00.510> came<00:03:00.690> up

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
experience real time and now it came up

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.650 
experience real time and now it came up
with<00:03:00.870> a<00:03:00.990> cat<00:03:01.760> the<00:03:02.760> hell's<00:03:02.970> up<00:03:03.150> with<00:03:03.210> that<00:03:03.330> that

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
with a cat the hell's up with that that

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.760 
with a cat the hell's up with that that
does<00:03:03.780> not<00:03:04.080> look<00:03:04.440> like<00:03:04.470> an<00:03:04.710> iPod<00:03:06.200> and<00:03:07.200> it<00:03:07.620> came

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
does not look like an iPod and it came

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:09.470 
does not look like an iPod and it came
up<00:03:07.890> with<00:03:07.920> a<00:03:08.040> dog<00:03:08.220> as<00:03:08.400> well<00:03:08.430> as<00:03:09.120> you<00:03:09.330> can<00:03:09.420> see

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
up with a dog as well as you can see

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.690 
up with a dog as well as you can see
Google<00:03:09.810> Goggles<00:03:10.140> is<00:03:10.590> mostly<00:03:11.010> a<00:03:11.100> fail<00:03:11.430> at<00:03:11.610> this

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
Google Goggles is mostly a fail at this

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.520 
Google Goggles is mostly a fail at this
point<00:03:11.970> I<00:03:12.150> believe<00:03:12.210> it's<00:03:12.600> better<00:03:12.810> for<00:03:13.080> actual

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
point I believe it's better for actual

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.430 
point I believe it's better for actual
products<00:03:14.070> such<00:03:14.610> as<00:03:14.640> the<00:03:14.850> 4-hour<00:03:15.150> workweek<00:03:15.510> for

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
products such as the 4-hour workweek for

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.110 
products such as the 4-hour workweek for
example<00:03:16.800> let's<00:03:17.100> take<00:03:17.160> a<00:03:17.280> second<00:03:17.760> picture<00:03:18.030> of

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
example let's take a second picture of

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:26.030 
example let's take a second picture of
it<00:03:18.270> and<00:03:18.420> see<00:03:18.600> if<00:03:18.660> it<00:03:18.720> does<00:03:18.840> a<00:03:18.870> nice<00:03:19.080> job<00:03:24.260> and<00:03:25.260> yes

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
it and see if it does a nice job and yes

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.250 
it and see if it does a nice job and yes
it<00:03:26.250> worked<00:03:26.430> perfectly<00:03:26.850> again<00:03:27.240> so<00:03:27.900> as<00:03:28.050> you<00:03:28.170> can

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
it worked perfectly again so as you can

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.130 
it worked perfectly again so as you can

anyway<00:03:31.440> works<00:03:31.740> a<00:03:31.920> lot<00:03:32.100> better<00:03:32.370> when<00:03:32.640> taking

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
anyway works a lot better when taking

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.750 
anyway works a lot better when taking
pictures<00:03:33.870> of<00:03:33.990> actual<00:03:34.350> products<00:03:34.800> you<00:03:35.670> know

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
pictures of actual products you know

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.360 
pictures of actual products you know
such<00:03:35.940> as<00:03:36.060> books<00:03:36.320> but<00:03:37.320> not<00:03:37.590> products<00:03:38.190> without

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:40.770 
recognizable artwork such as the iPod

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:42.920 
recognizable artwork such as the iPod
that<00:03:41.130> certainly<00:03:41.970> did<00:03:42.180> not<00:03:42.210> work<00:03:42.510> too<00:03:42.750> well

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
that certainly did not work too well

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.380 
that certainly did not work too well
actually<00:03:43.740> let's<00:03:44.070> for<00:03:44.640> the<00:03:44.700> fun<00:03:44.880> of<00:03:45.030> it<00:03:45.090> take<00:03:45.360> a

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
actually let's for the fun of it take a

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.010 
actually let's for the fun of it take a
picture<00:03:45.750> of<00:03:45.780> my<00:03:46.020> Apple<00:03:46.380> keyboard<00:03:47.660> this<00:03:48.660> should

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:49.020 
picture of my Apple keyboard this should

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.590 
picture of my Apple keyboard this should
not<00:03:49.230> work<00:03:49.530> because<00:03:50.459> it's<00:03:50.760> just<00:03:50.910> a<00:03:51.030> keyboard

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
not work because it's just a keyboard

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.690 
not work because it's just a keyboard
I<00:03:51.630> mean<00:03:52.410> maybe<00:03:52.860> it'll<00:03:53.040> find<00:03:53.250> out<00:03:53.340> like<00:03:53.459> okay

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
I mean maybe it'll find out like okay
