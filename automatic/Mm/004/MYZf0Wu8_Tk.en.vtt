dollars<00:02:37.200> and<00:02:37.590> fifty<00:02:37.680> cents<00:02:38.100> I<00:02:42.260> tried<00:02:43.260> it<00:02:43.440> on

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
dollars and fifty cents I tried it on

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:54.490 
dollars and fifty cents I tried it on
the<00:02:43.680> lg<00:02:44.040> optimus<00:02:45.410> even<00:02:46.410> with<00:02:46.560> a<00:02:46.590> case
