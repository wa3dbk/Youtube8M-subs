okay<00:00:01.890> so<00:00:02.250> that's<00:00:02.370> the<00:00:02.550> display<00:00:03.149> of<00:00:03.510> my<00:00:03.780> tiara

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
okay so that's the display of my tiara

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.680 
okay so that's the display of my tiara
the<00:00:04.830> digital<00:00:05.130> readout<00:00:05.569> connected<00:00:06.569> by<00:00:06.660> a

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
the digital readout connected by a

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.560 
the digital readout connected by a
fairly<00:00:06.990> sturdy<00:00:07.200> arm<00:00:08.120> stuck<00:00:09.120> on<00:00:09.240> the<00:00:09.330> side<00:00:09.540> of

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
fairly sturdy arm stuck on the side of

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.959 
fairly sturdy arm stuck on the side of
my<00:00:09.780> Super<00:00:10.110> seven<00:00:10.290> that's<00:00:11.250> the<00:00:11.490> the<00:00:11.759> three

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
my Super seven that's the the three

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.430 
my Super seven that's the the three
phase<00:00:12.210> controller<00:00:12.690> that<00:00:12.900> I've<00:00:12.990> gots<00:00:13.200> which

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
phase controller that I've gots which

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.379 
phase controller that I've gots which
gives<00:00:13.679> me<00:00:13.769> infinitely<00:00:14.130> variable<00:00:14.549> speeds<00:00:15.000> and

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
gives me infinitely variable speeds and

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.070 
gives me infinitely variable speeds and
jaw<00:00:16.139> control<00:00:17.210> speed<00:00:18.210> control<00:00:18.510> is<00:00:18.539> always<00:00:18.840> down

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
jaw control speed control is always down

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.650 
jaw control speed control is always down
here<00:00:19.279> it's<00:00:20.279> just<00:00:20.310> kind<00:00:20.430> of<00:00:20.640> showing<00:00:20.760> 0%<00:00:21.480> at<00:00:21.600> the

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
here it's just kind of showing 0% at the

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.439 
here it's just kind of showing 0% at the
moment<00:00:21.960> if<00:00:22.650> I<00:00:23.330> press<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.359> jog<00:00:26.060> bring<00:00:27.060> it<00:00:27.180> five

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
moment if I press the jog bring it five

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:33.520 
moment if I press the jog bring it five
Hertz<00:00:28.730> and<00:00:29.730> every<00:00:29.970> time<00:00:30.179> I<00:00:30.300> hit<00:00:30.510> that<00:00:30.890> button

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
Hertz and every time I hit that button

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.930 
Hertz and every time I hit that button
get<00:00:34.530> a<00:00:34.559> nice<00:00:34.800> slow<00:00:35.219> speed<00:00:35.610> but<00:00:35.760> I<00:00:35.910> talk

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:37.940 
get a nice slow speed but I talk

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.580 
get a nice slow speed but I talk
that's<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.059> bracket<00:00:39.450> that<00:00:39.629> I<00:00:39.660> did<00:00:39.989> lunchtime

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
that's the bracket that I did lunchtime

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.979 
that's the bracket that I did lunchtime
yesterday<00:00:40.770> which<00:00:41.219> connects<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:42.780> read

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
head back not easy to see but down there

as<00:01:06.270> you<00:01:06.420> can<00:01:06.540> appreciate<00:01:06.710> I've<00:01:07.710> got<00:01:07.979> a<00:01:08.340> readout

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
as you can appreciate I've got a readout

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.980 
as you can appreciate I've got a readout
on<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.600> display<00:01:10.110> there<00:01:10.520> accurate<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:11.869> half<00:01:12.869> a

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
on the display there accurate to half a

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.580 
on the display there accurate to half a
micron<00:01:13.350> it<00:01:13.890> is<00:01:14.900> ridiculous<00:01:15.900> for<00:01:16.350> a<00:01:16.380> machine

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
micron it is ridiculous for a machine

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.929 
micron it is ridiculous for a machine
that's<00:01:17.009> 42<00:01:17.400> years<00:01:17.820> old<00:01:17.939> and<00:01:19.549> likewise<00:01:20.549> if<00:01:20.790> I

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
that's 42 years old and likewise if I

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.340 
that's 42 years old and likewise if I
swap<00:01:21.720> hands<00:01:22.549> twiddle<00:01:23.549> my<00:01:23.759> cross<00:01:24.000> slide<00:01:24.350> again

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
swap hands twiddle my cross slide again

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.340 
swap hands twiddle my cross slide again
I've<00:01:25.680> got<00:01:26.119> 1/2<00:01:27.119> micron<00:01:27.659> resolution<00:01:28.490> which<00:01:29.490> is

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
I've got 1/2 micron resolution which is

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.789 
I've got 1/2 micron resolution which is
excellent<00:01:31.350> means<00:01:31.770> I<00:01:31.890> don't<00:01:32.040> have<00:01:32.250> to<00:01:33.799> measure

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
excellent means I don't have to measure

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.469 
excellent means I don't have to measure
too<00:01:35.430> many<00:01:35.610> things<00:01:35.759> I<00:01:35.850> still<00:01:35.970> hopefully<00:01:36.329> have

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
too many things I still hopefully have

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.170 
too many things I still hopefully have
to<00:01:36.630> measure<00:01:36.810> things<00:01:36.990> reckon<00:01:37.409> I<00:01:37.619> can<00:01:38.159> bring<00:01:38.549> the

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
to measure things reckon I can bring the

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.710 
to measure things reckon I can bring the
the<00:01:39.689> cutter<00:01:39.960> to<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.829> surface<00:01:41.360> measure<00:01:42.360> with

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
the cutter to the surface measure with

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.819 
the cutter to the surface measure with
my<00:01:42.990> calipers<00:01:43.710> and<00:01:44.460> then<00:01:44.640> actually<00:01:44.939> dial<00:01:45.240> in

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:45.829 
my calipers and then actually dial in

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:49.010 
my calipers and then actually dial in
what<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:47.130> diameter<00:01:47.790> is<00:01:47.970> and<00:01:48.299> then<00:01:48.630> use<00:01:48.810> as<00:01:48.990> a

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
what the diameter is and then use as a

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.980 
what the diameter is and then use as a
starting<00:01:49.500> point<00:01:49.710> which<00:01:50.070> is<00:01:50.280> a<00:01:50.820> massive<00:01:51.750> time

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
starting point which is a massive time

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.740 
starting point which is a massive time
saver<00:01:52.020> because<00:01:52.409> I've<00:01:52.829> got<00:01:53.490> a<00:01:53.790> known<00:01:54.240> doubt<00:01:54.509> it

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
saver because I've got a known doubt it
