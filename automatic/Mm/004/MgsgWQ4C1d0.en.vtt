I<00:00:23.990> stand<00:00:24.990> in<00:00:25.170> the<00:00:25.290> difference<00:00:25.620> in<00:00:25.740> making<00:00:25.830> just

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
I stand in the difference in making just

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.510 
I stand in the difference in making just
absolutely<00:00:26.730> incredible<00:00:26.880> it<00:00:27.720> was<00:00:28.110> an

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:28.520 
absolutely incredible it was an

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.000 
absolutely incredible it was an
absolutely<00:00:29.520> massive<00:00:30.180> difference<00:00:30.780> today<00:00:31.260> it's

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:32.010 
absolutely massive difference today it's

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:34.100 
absolutely massive difference today it's
it's<00:00:32.550> a<00:00:32.640> bit<00:00:32.790> of<00:00:32.880> a<00:00:32.970> no-brainer<00:00:33.420> really<00:00:33.690> you

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
it's a bit of a no-brainer really you

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.350 
it's a bit of a no-brainer really you
know<00:00:34.230> if<00:00:34.350> I'd<00:00:34.500> been<00:00:34.710> snow<00:00:35.160> and<00:00:35.370> icy<00:00:35.460> and<00:00:35.790> you

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
know if I'd been snow and icy and you

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.280 
know if I'd been snow and icy and you
wouldn't<00:00:36.510> be<00:00:36.570> going<00:00:36.660> anywhere<00:00:36.840> on<00:00:37.200> the

familiar with winter tires I haven't
tried<00:00:43.379> them<00:00:43.680> on<00:00:45.050> we're<00:00:46.050> in<00:00:46.440> snowy<00:00:46.800> weather

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
tried them on we're in snowy weather

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.979 
tried them on we're in snowy weather
before<00:00:47.220> them<00:00:47.550> but<00:00:48.360> it<00:00:48.480> is<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.660> first<00:00:48.840> time

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
before them but it is the first time

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.390 
before them but it is the first time
I've<00:00:49.110> tried<00:00:49.140> him<00:00:49.440> in<00:00:49.500> a<00:00:49.559> variety<00:00:49.739> conditions

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:50.400 
I've tried him in a variety conditions

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.660 
I've tried him in a variety conditions
and<00:00:50.700> also<00:00:50.910> in<00:00:51.680> sort<00:00:52.680> of<00:00:52.710> moderate

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
and also in sort of moderate

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:54.979 
and also in sort of moderate
temperatures<00:00:54.090> rather<00:00:54.330> than<00:00:54.510> very<00:00:54.750> cold

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
temperatures rather than very cold

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.250 
temperatures rather than very cold
temperatures<00:00:55.579> it<00:00:56.579> was<00:00:56.730> a<00:00:56.760> surprise<00:00:56.910> in<00:00:57.329> the

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
temperatures it was a surprise in the

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.700 
temperatures it was a surprise in the
actual<00:00:58.920> difference<00:01:00.110> between<00:01:01.110> the<00:01:01.440> winter

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
actual difference between the winter

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.219 
actual difference between the winter
tyres<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.070> scimitars<00:01:02.430> I<00:01:03.180> had<00:01:03.600> an<00:01:03.899> expectation

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
tyres the scimitars I had an expectation

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.200 
tyres the scimitars I had an expectation
obviously<00:01:04.860> there<00:01:04.979> would<00:01:05.100> be<00:01:05.160> an<00:01:05.970> improvement

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
obviously there would be an improvement

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.940 
obviously there would be an improvement
in<00:01:06.390> a<00:01:06.450> minute<00:01:06.660> eyes<00:01:06.810> but<00:01:07.050> not<00:01:07.320> not<00:01:07.590> quite<00:01:07.830> as

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
in a minute eyes but not not quite as

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.370 
in a minute eyes but not not quite as
marketed<00:01:08.520> work<00:01:08.700> I<00:01:09.000> think<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.509> particularly

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
marketed work I think the particularly

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.260 
marketed work I think the particularly
the<00:01:10.830> ice<00:01:10.979> hill<00:01:11.360> in<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.540> eris<00:01:13.130> it<00:01:14.149> in<00:01:15.149> the

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
the ice hill in the eris it in the

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.420 
the ice hill in the eris it in the
winter<00:01:15.420> tire<00:01:15.660> car<00:01:15.990> it<00:01:16.440> didn't<00:01:16.800> feel<00:01:16.920> like<00:01:16.979> I

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
winter tire car it didn't feel like I

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.030 
winter tire car it didn't feel like I
stool<00:01:18.210> it<00:01:18.479> felt

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.040 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:34.160 

certainly<00:01:23.040> not<00:01:31.640> winter<00:01:32.640> tires<00:01:32.850> are<00:01:33.170> certainly

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
certainly not winter tires are certainly

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.180 
certainly not winter tires are certainly
been<00:01:34.320> an<00:01:34.410> issue<00:01:34.530> in<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.800> last<00:01:34.980> two<00:01:35.160> years

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:35.190 
been an issue in the last two years

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.510 
been an issue in the last two years
people<00:01:35.610> have<00:01:35.760> realized<00:01:36.480> that<00:01:37.130> no<00:01:38.130> longer<00:01:38.280> can

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
people have realized that no longer can

people have realized that no longer can
we<00:01:38.730> we<00:01:39.270> survive<00:01:39.600> without<00:01:39.750> actually<00:01:40.170> thinking

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:40.440 
we we survive without actually thinking

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.890 
we we survive without actually thinking
about<00:01:40.500> how<00:01:40.770> we<00:01:40.830> get<00:01:41.040> around<00:01:41.130> and<00:01:41.610> I've<00:01:42.360> driven

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:42.900 
about how we get around and I've driven

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.480 
about how we get around and I've driven
winter<00:01:43.200> tires<00:01:43.410> and<00:01:43.650> various<00:01:43.920> tests<00:01:44.310> in<00:01:44.400> the

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
winter tires and various tests in the

winter tires and various tests in the
past<00:01:44.730> there<00:01:45.060> I<00:01:45.240> do<00:01:45.300> a<00:01:45.420> lot<00:01:45.480> of<00:01:45.540> skiing<00:01:45.870> so<00:01:46.130> I'm

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
past there I do a lot of skiing so I'm

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.920 
past there I do a lot of skiing so I'm
aware<00:01:47.400> of<00:01:47.460> how<00:01:47.700> they<00:01:47.850> work<00:01:48.060> but<00:01:48.090> what<00:01:48.600> we<00:01:48.750> did

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
aware of how they work but what we did

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.870 
aware of how they work but what we did
here<00:01:49.050> today<00:01:49.200> where<00:01:49.620> we<00:01:49.860> drove<00:01:50.340> them<00:01:50.580> back<00:01:50.610> to

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
here today where we drove them back to

you<00:02:23.910> could<00:02:24.090> drive<00:02:24.239> the<00:02:24.390> winter<00:02:24.660> tire<00:02:24.900> and<00:02:25.310> on

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
you could drive the winter tire and on

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.040 
you could drive the winter tire and on
the<00:02:26.790> road<00:02:26.910> partially<00:02:27.480> well<00:02:27.630> you<00:02:27.840> know<00:02:27.930> there's

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
the road partially well you know there's

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.260 
the road partially well you know there's
grip<00:02:28.770> there<00:02:28.980> okay<00:02:29.370> whatever<00:02:29.850> you<00:02:29.910> push<00:02:30.120> it<00:02:30.239> a

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
grip there okay whatever you push it a

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:31.880 
grip there okay whatever you push it a
little<00:02:30.330> bit<00:02:30.540> harder<00:02:30.840> than<00:02:30.870> it<00:02:31.200> gives<00:02:31.620> up<00:02:31.800> its

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
little bit harder than it gives up its

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.770 
little bit harder than it gives up its
grip<00:02:32.100> a<00:02:32.130> little<00:02:32.310> bit<00:02:32.550> around<00:02:32.820> here<00:02:33.030> but<00:02:33.239> you

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
grip a little bit around here but you

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.300 
grip a little bit around here but you
know<00:02:33.900> nothing<00:02:34.110> nothing<00:02:34.620> to<00:02:34.739> worry<00:02:34.950> about<00:02:35.040> in

which<00:02:44.130> size<00:02:44.430> is<00:02:44.610> an<00:02:44.730> interesting<00:02:44.970> one<00:02:45.239> because

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
which size is an interesting one because

which size is an interesting one because
I<00:02:45.690> random<00:02:46.290> last<00:02:46.680> year<00:02:46.860> on<00:02:46.950> my<00:02:47.070> golfing

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
I random last year on my golfing

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.690 
I random last year on my golfing
long-termer<00:02:48.560> and<00:02:49.560> I<00:02:49.650> jumped<00:02:50.310> in<00:02:50.370> from<00:02:50.610> the

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
long-termer and I jumped in from the

long-termer and I jumped in from the
type<00:02:50.970> it<00:02:51.180> in<00:02:51.300> center<00:02:51.660> and<00:02:51.900> didn't<00:02:52.170> notice<00:02:52.320> a

type it in center and didn't notice a

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
peach Matt difference at first so for a

peach Matt difference at first so for a
few<00:02:55.890> months<00:02:56.010> it<00:02:56.220> was<00:02:56.280> just<00:02:56.519> like<00:02:56.820> normal<00:02:57.030> then

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
few months it was just like normal then

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.479 
few months it was just like normal then
the<00:02:57.870> snow<00:02:58.080> came<00:02:58.350> and<00:02:58.590> they<00:02:58.709> started<00:02:59.130> making<00:02:59.280> a

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
the snow came and they started making a

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:00.920 
the snow came and they started making a
huge<00:02:59.700> difference<00:02:59.910> and<00:03:00.209> that's<00:03:00.360> who<00:03:00.510> I<00:03:00.600> kind<00:03:00.870> of

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
huge difference and that's who I kind of

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.030 
huge difference and that's who I kind of
understood<00:03:01.860> the<00:03:02.730> benefits<00:03:02.850> of<00:03:03.209> winter<00:03:03.510> tires

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
understood the benefits of winter tires

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.740 
understood the benefits of winter tires
it's<00:03:05.040> similar<00:03:05.310> to<00:03:05.459> today<00:03:05.940> we<00:03:06.150> went<00:03:06.269> that<00:03:06.480> first

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
it's similar to today we went that first

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.070 
it's similar to today we went that first
on<00:03:06.930> the<00:03:07.050> track<00:03:07.320> for<00:03:07.739> the<00:03:07.800> handling<00:03:08.700> course<00:03:09.080> in

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
on the track for the handling course in

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.360 
on the track for the handling course in
the<00:03:10.290> band's<00:03:10.739> over<00:03:11.010> there<00:03:11.310> I<00:03:13.010> went<00:03:14.010> out<00:03:14.190> a<00:03:14.220> win

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
the band's over there I went out a win

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:15.770 
the band's over there I went out a win
tonight<00:03:14.489> first<00:03:14.910> and<00:03:15.150> then<00:03:15.239> the<00:03:15.269> normal<00:03:15.570> tires

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
tonight first and then the normal tires

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:16.910 
tonight first and then the normal tires
and<00:03:16.019> again<00:03:16.200> there<00:03:16.290> wasn't<00:03:16.410> a<00:03:16.560> huge<00:03:16.709> difference

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
and again there wasn't a huge difference

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.470 
and again there wasn't a huge difference
the<00:03:17.280> normal<00:03:17.550> tires<00:03:17.730> have<00:03:17.910> passed<00:03:18.090> a<00:03:18.330> bit

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
the normal tires have passed a bit

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.870 
the normal tires have passed a bit
sharper<00:03:18.900> but<00:03:19.050> it<00:03:19.290> wasn't<00:03:19.680> major<00:03:19.890> but<00:03:20.580> went<00:03:20.730> out

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
sharper but it wasn't major but went out

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.199 
sharper but it wasn't major but went out
in<00:03:21.000> the<00:03:21.030> big<00:03:21.540> ski<00:03:22.019> slope<00:03:22.320> think<00:03:22.850> we<00:03:23.850> went<00:03:24.030> down

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
in the big ski slope think we went down

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:26.860 
in the big ski slope think we went down
there<00:03:24.390> with<00:03:24.769> cold<00:03:25.769> weather<00:03:25.950> ties<00:03:26.190> for

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
there with cold weather ties for

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.500 
there with cold weather ties for
and<00:03:27.110> cast<00:03:27.890> stopped<00:03:28.220> him<00:03:28.459> he<00:03:28.670> was<00:03:28.909> fine<00:03:29.090> and

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
and cast stopped him he was fine and

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.390 
and cast stopped him he was fine and
then<00:03:29.569> went<00:03:29.959> out<00:03:30.080> on<00:03:30.260> the<00:03:30.319> normal<00:03:30.709> ties<00:03:30.920> and<00:03:31.220> we

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
then went out on the normal ties and we

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.789 
then went out on the normal ties and we
just<00:03:31.640> thought<00:03:32.200> straight<00:03:33.200> down<00:03:33.379> to<00:03:33.500> the<00:03:33.620> bomb

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:33.799 
just thought straight down to the bomb

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:35.470 
just thought straight down to the bomb
and<00:03:34.040> that's<00:03:34.340> when<00:03:34.610> I<00:03:34.640> really<00:03:35.000> understood<00:03:35.360> the

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
and that's when I really understood the

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.750 
and that's when I really understood the
difference<00:03:35.629> that<00:03:35.900> with<00:03:36.200> ties<00:03:36.470> me<00:03:36.739> it<00:03:37.340> was<00:03:37.519> them

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
difference that with ties me it was them

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.820 
difference that with ties me it was them
and<00:03:38.629> stand<00:03:38.959> in<00:03:39.140> the<00:03:39.260> difference<00:03:39.590> in<00:03:39.709> making

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:39.830 
and stand in the difference in making

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:48.490 
and stand in the difference in making
just<00:03:40.190> absolutely<00:03:40.700> incredible

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.000 

I've<00:03:49.340> experienced<00:03:49.910> winter<00:03:50.120> tires<00:03:50.300> before<00:03:50.540> and

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
I've experienced winter tires before and

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.910 
I've experienced winter tires before and
both<00:03:52.010> on<00:03:52.400> my<00:03:52.730> own<00:03:52.880> car<00:03:53.180> and<00:03:53.350> we've<00:03:54.350> been<00:03:54.770> to

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920 
both on my own car and we've been to

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.380 
both on my own car and we've been to
lots<00:03:55.130> of<00:03:55.250> presentations<00:03:55.790> about<00:03:55.910> them<00:03:56.210> and

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:56.390 
lots of presentations about them and

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:59.800 
lots of presentations about them and
seeing<00:03:57.350> in<00:03:58.310> the<00:03:58.640> theory<00:03:58.910> behind<00:03:59.150> why<00:03:59.450> they

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
seeing in the theory behind why they

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.140 
seeing in the theory behind why they
make<00:03:59.990> a<00:04:00.020> difference<00:04:00.470> and<00:04:00.650> they<00:04:01.010> in<00:04:01.550> theory<00:04:02.030> do

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
make a difference and they in theory do

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:03.760 
make a difference and they in theory do
make<00:04:02.330> a<00:04:02.360> difference<00:04:02.450> but<00:04:02.990> having<00:04:03.440> a<00:04:03.500> chance<00:04:03.680> to

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:03.770 
make a difference but having a chance to

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:07.090 
make a difference but having a chance to
to<00:04:04.550> test<00:04:04.760> them<00:04:04.940> here<00:04:05.180> proves<00:04:05.660> all<00:04:06.410> the<00:04:06.709> theory

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:07.100 
to test them here proves all the theory

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:08.470 
to test them here proves all the theory
that<00:04:07.130> we've<00:04:07.370> already<00:04:07.550> been<00:04:07.760> told<00:04:08.060> which<00:04:08.330> is

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480 
that we've already been told which is

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.150 
that we've already been told which is
that<00:04:08.600> they<00:04:08.720> reduce<00:04:09.020> braking<00:04:09.440> distances<00:04:09.980> and

our<00:05:19.430> view<00:05:19.820> of<00:05:20.050> winter<00:05:21.050> tires<00:05:21.290> is<00:05:21.620> that<00:05:22.610> it's

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:22.940 
our view of winter tires is that it's

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:25.830 
our view of winter tires is that it's
it's<00:05:23.510> a<00:05:23.630> bit<00:05:23.780> of<00:05:23.870> a<00:05:23.930> no-brainer<00:05:24.140> really<00:05:24.680> the

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:25.840 
it's a bit of a no-brainer really the

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:29.350 
it's a bit of a no-brainer really the
there<00:05:26.840> isn't<00:05:27.170> a<00:05:27.520> greater<00:05:28.520> cost<00:05:28.940> involved

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 
there isn't a greater cost involved

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:33.070 
there isn't a greater cost involved
because<00:05:29.840> you'll<00:05:30.500> simply<00:05:30.890> have<00:05:31.660> two<00:05:32.660> sets<00:05:32.930> of

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:33.080 
because you'll simply have two sets of

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.350 
because you'll simply have two sets of
tires<00:05:33.350> which<00:05:33.650> are<00:05:33.830> using<00:05:34.190> for<00:05:34.490> more<00:05:35.090> or<00:05:35.210> less

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:35.360 
tires which are using for more or less

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.840

half<00:05:35.630> a<00:05:35.810> year<00:05:36.020> each<00:05:36.440> so<00:05:37.310> you're<00:05:37.460> not<00:05:37.550> spending

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:37.850 
half a year each so you're not spending

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:40.450 
half a year each so you're not spending
any<00:05:38.180> more<00:05:38.450> on<00:05:38.660> tires<00:05:38.960> you<00:05:39.620> just<00:05:39.860> have<00:05:40.010> two<00:05:40.250> sets

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:40.460 
any more on tires you just have two sets

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:43.090 
any more on tires you just have two sets
of<00:05:40.610> tires<00:05:40.880> which<00:05:41.150> will<00:05:41.360> last<00:05:41.860> twice<00:05:42.860> as<00:05:42.890> long

of tires which will last twice as long
the<00:05:44.090> the<00:05:44.600> only<00:05:44.840> cost<00:05:45.140> consideration<00:05:45.950> is

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:46.130 
the the only cost consideration is

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:48.790 
the the only cost consideration is

replacing the tires and you have the

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:54.610 
replacing the tires and you have the

00:05:58.990 --> 00:05:59.000 
the tires on and then you can store them

huge difference in costs it's just that

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:07.390 
huge difference in costs it's just that
