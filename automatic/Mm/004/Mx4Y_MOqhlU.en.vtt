00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:14.080 
spent about five minutes trading I know
it's<00:02:13.610> not<00:02:13.730> great

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
it's not great

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.330 
it's not great
the<00:02:14.150> time<00:02:14.450> but<00:02:14.660> I<00:02:14.900> thought<00:02:15.260> I<00:02:15.530> want<00:02:16.099> to<00:02:16.160> test

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
the time but I thought I want to test

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.220 
the time but I thought I want to test
myself<00:02:16.489> so<00:02:17.060> the<00:02:17.150> first<00:02:17.300> player<00:02:17.540> is<00:02:17.720> Richie<00:02:18.019> a

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
myself so the first player is Richie a

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.160 
myself so the first player is Richie a
left<00:02:18.620> wing<00:02:18.860> for<00:02:19.160> swindon<00:02:19.760> oblivious<00:02:20.420> I<00:02:20.629> picked

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
left wing for swindon oblivious I picked

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.530 
left wing for swindon oblivious I picked
this<00:02:21.319> one<00:02:21.470> up<00:02:21.530> for<00:02:21.739> 19<00:02:22.280> k<00:02:22.519> and<00:02:22.730> the<00:02:23.150> chip<00:02:23.360> stock

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
this one up for 19 k and the chip stock

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.470 
this one up for 19 k and the chip stock
market<00:02:23.930> was<00:02:24.080> currently<00:02:24.650> at<00:02:24.830> the<00:02:24.950> time<00:02:25.160> 50k<00:02:25.819> so

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
market was currently at the time 50k so

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.330 
market was currently at the time 50k so
I<00:02:26.840> wanted<00:02:27.410> to<00:02:27.500> stick<00:02:27.739> mine<00:02:27.890> up<00:02:28.040> for<00:02:28.190> a<00:02:28.220> round

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
I wanted to stick mine up for a round

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.229 
I wanted to stick mine up for a round
but<00:02:28.550> 35<00:02:29.420> k<00:02:29.660> well<00:02:30.170> lower<00:02:30.410> so<00:02:31.160> there<00:02:31.790> isn't<00:02:32.120> too

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
but 35 k well lower so there isn't too

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:33.910 
but 35 k well lower so there isn't too
much<00:02:32.269> of<00:02:32.420> a<00:02:32.599> risk<00:02:32.750> in<00:02:32.989> the<00:02:33.110> end<00:02:33.230> I<00:02:33.349> decided<00:02:33.500> to

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
much of a risk in the end I decided to

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.199 
much of a risk in the end I decided to
go<00:02:34.010> for<00:02:34.190> 30k<00:02:34.640> just<00:02:35.390> so<00:02:35.480> it's<00:02:35.629> old<00:02:35.840> and<00:02:37.209> usually

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
go for 30k just so it's old and usually

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:40.449 
go for 30k just so it's old and usually
because<00:02:38.900> bronzers<00:02:39.410> fluctuate<00:02:39.950> the<00:02:40.040> market<00:02:40.310> so

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
because bronzers fluctuate the market so

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:42.699 
because bronzers fluctuate the market so
much<00:02:40.670> I<00:02:40.940> actually<00:02:41.540> usually<00:02:41.900> see<00:02:42.260> this<00:02:42.440> guy<00:02:42.560> go

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
much I actually usually see this guy go

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:45.809 
much I actually usually see this guy go
for<00:02:42.950> 20k<00:02:43.250> so<00:02:43.670> 19k<00:02:44.569> pay<00:02:44.780> for<00:02:45.049> hopefully<00:02:45.590> I<00:02:45.620> can

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:45.819 
for 20k so 19k pay for hopefully I can
