00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:44.620 
at least like the main poster I don't
know<00:00:43.340> if<00:00:43.430> this<00:00:43.550> was<00:00:43.670> actually<00:00:43.880> like<00:00:44.210> on<00:00:44.420> the

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:44.630 
know if this was actually like on the

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:48.430 
know if this was actually like on the
box<00:00:44.840> I<00:00:45.230> can't<00:00:45.500> remember<00:00:45.710> but<00:00:46.329> anyway<00:00:47.329> and<00:00:47.630> I

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.440 
box I can't remember but anyway and I

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.979 
box I can't remember but anyway and I
kind<00:00:48.950> of<00:00:49.010> lucked<00:00:49.190> out<00:00:49.340> because<00:00:49.960> sheamus<00:00:50.960> said

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989 
kind of lucked out because sheamus said

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:53.139 
kind of lucked out because sheamus said
that<00:00:51.410> he<00:00:51.710> probably<00:00:52.010> would<00:00:52.309> be<00:00:52.430> a<00:00:52.460> knight<00:00:52.910> or<00:00:52.940> a

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:53.149 
that he probably would be a knight or a

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:56.049 
that he probably would be a knight or a
melee<00:00:53.510> class<00:00:53.780> when<00:00:54.260> he<00:00:54.440> played<00:00:54.710> the<00:00:54.739> game<00:00:55.059> so

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:56.059 
melee class when he played the game so

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:58.330 
melee class when he played the game so
you<00:00:56.750> know<00:00:56.899> that's<00:00:57.140> basically<00:00:57.829> who's<00:00:58.070> on<00:00:58.219> the

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.340

you know that's basically who's on the
cover<00:00:58.460> so<00:00:59.260> that's<00:01:00.260> what<00:01:00.440> I<00:01:00.469> went<00:01:00.680> ahead<00:01:00.739> and

one<00:03:11.319> layer<00:03:11.739> and<00:03:11.980> then<00:03:12.370> went<00:03:12.579> over<00:03:12.790> it<00:03:12.910> and<00:03:13.060> like

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
one layer and then went over it and like

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.210 
one layer and then went over it and like
added<00:03:13.630> highlights<00:03:13.810> and<00:03:14.470> lowlights<00:03:14.650> and

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
added highlights and lowlights and

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.520 
added highlights and lowlights and
things<00:03:15.400> like<00:03:15.519> that<00:03:15.579> to<00:03:16.090> try<00:03:16.690> to<00:03:16.750> give<00:03:17.319> it<00:03:17.410> more

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
things like that to try to give it more

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.690 
things like that to try to give it more
depth<00:03:18.390> and<00:03:20.040> that<00:03:21.040> seems<00:03:21.250> to<00:03:21.280> work<00:03:21.459> out<00:03:21.549> really

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
depth and that seems to work out really

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.910 
depth and that seems to work out really
well<00:03:22.170> considering<00:03:23.170> how<00:03:23.349> quickly<00:03:23.590> i<00:03:23.739> was

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
well considering how quickly i was

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.020 
well considering how quickly i was
trying<00:03:24.099> to<00:03:24.130> get<00:03:24.220> it<00:03:24.340> all<00:03:24.459> done<00:03:24.640> and<00:03:24.819> everything

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:35.769 
the video in progress trying to think of

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:39.120 
the video in progress trying to think of
things<00:03:35.799> to<00:03:36.220> mention<00:03:36.459> i<00:03:37.440> believe<00:03:38.440> that<00:03:38.799> i<00:03:38.829> ended

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130 
things to mention i believe that i ended

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.030 
things to mention i believe that i ended
up<00:03:39.370> going<00:03:39.970> to<00:03:40.000> a<00:03:40.180> very<00:03:40.359> top<00:03:40.959> layer<00:03:41.290> eventually

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
up going to a very top layer eventually

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.259 
up going to a very top layer eventually
like<00:03:42.220> one<00:03:42.430> above<00:03:42.700> everything<00:03:43.120> and<00:03:45.269> adding

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:46.269 
like one above everything and adding

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:47.849 
like one above everything and adding
some<00:03:46.600> little<00:03:46.840> like<00:03:47.109> corrections<00:03:47.680> and

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:47.859 
some little like corrections and

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:49.470 
some little like corrections and
touching<00:03:48.250> up<00:03:48.370> the<00:03:48.400> painting<00:03:48.880> from<00:03:49.120> like<00:03:49.299> the

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
touching up the painting from like the

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.110 
touching up the painting from like the
very<00:03:49.630> top<00:03:49.989> so<00:03:50.920> i<00:03:51.220> didn't<00:03:51.519> have<00:03:51.579> to<00:03:51.670> like<00:03:51.910> work

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
very top so i didn't have to like work

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.910 
very top so i didn't have to like work
on<00:03:52.269> multiple<00:03:52.420> layers<00:03:52.840> or<00:03:53.049> anything<00:03:53.319> like<00:03:53.350> that

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.379 

also<00:03:56.920> i<00:03:57.130> think<00:03:57.190> the<00:03:57.430> armor<00:03:57.730> only<00:03:57.970> has<00:03:58.180> like<00:03:58.359> a

00:03:58.379 --> 00:03:58.389 
also i think the armor only has like a

00:03:58.389 --> 00:04:01.259 
also i think the armor only has like a
hint<00:03:58.690> of<00:03:58.959> greenish<00:03:59.590> turquoise<00:04:00.280> in<00:04:00.730> it<00:04:01.030> it's

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:01.269 
hint of greenish turquoise in it it's

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:03.150 
hint of greenish turquoise in it it's
kind<00:04:01.480> of<00:04:01.510> like<00:04:01.630> aged<00:04:01.870> brass<00:04:02.200> but<00:04:02.680> I<00:04:02.829> sort<00:04:03.130> of

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.160 
kind of like aged brass but I sort of

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:04.410 
kind of like aged brass but I sort of
went<00:04:03.280> a<00:04:03.400> little<00:04:03.519> overboard<00:04:03.819> which<00:04:04.150> is<00:04:04.269> like

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420 
went a little overboard which is like

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.020 
went a little overboard which is like
green<00:04:04.720> I<00:04:05.220> don't<00:04:06.220> mind<00:04:06.430> it<00:04:06.609> that<00:04:06.730> I<00:04:06.790> think<00:04:06.970> it

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
green I don't mind it that I think it

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.030 
green I don't mind it that I think it
looks<00:04:07.180> okay<00:04:07.269> in<00:04:07.780> the<00:04:07.930> finished<00:04:08.260> card<00:04:08.470> because

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
looks okay in the finished card because

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.259 
looks okay in the finished card because
the<00:04:10.139> background<00:04:11.139> is<00:04:11.889> primarily<00:04:11.980> read<00:04:12.849> in<00:04:13.150> the

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:13.269 
the background is primarily read in the

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:14.849 
the background is primarily read in the
finished<00:04:13.540> card<00:04:13.720> and<00:04:14.079> green<00:04:14.440> looks<00:04:14.650> really

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:14.859 
finished card and green looks really

00:04:14.859 --> 00:04:16.800 
finished card and green looks really
good<00:04:15.040> next<00:04:15.310> to<00:04:15.430> read<00:04:15.639> but<00:04:16.269> you<00:04:16.419> need<00:04:16.570> to<00:04:16.690> add

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
good next to read but you need to add

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:18.509 
good next to read but you need to add
like<00:04:17.049> some<00:04:17.289> other<00:04:17.440> colors<00:04:17.769> and<00:04:18.010> like<00:04:18.250> browns

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519 
like some other colors and like browns

Sheamus in this one just because like

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:13.350 
Sheamus in this one just because like
the<00:06:12.099> character's<00:06:12.519> head<00:06:12.549> is<00:06:12.909> covered<00:06:13.089> with<00:06:13.239> a
