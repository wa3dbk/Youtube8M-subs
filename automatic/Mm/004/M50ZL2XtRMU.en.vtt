Phoenix<00:02:20.760> and<00:02:21.030> I<00:02:21.569> made<00:02:22.230> a<00:02:22.260> summoning<00:02:22.650> through

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
Phoenix and I made a summoning through

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:23.960 
Phoenix and I made a summoning through
it<00:02:22.950> because<00:02:23.010> there's<00:02:23.280> a<00:02:23.340> lot<00:02:23.550> of<00:02:23.580> summoning

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
it because there's a lot of summoning

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.910 
it because there's a lot of summoning
tanks<00:02:24.300> and<00:02:24.450> stuff<00:02:24.510> but<00:02:24.959> not<00:02:25.140> that<00:02:25.379> many<00:02:25.500> peers

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
tanks and stuff but not that many peers

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.670 
tanks and stuff but not that many peers
and<00:02:26.190> I<00:02:26.610> just<00:02:26.849> think<00:02:27.030> that's<00:02:27.180> pretty<00:02:27.450> cool<00:02:27.720> to

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
and I just think that's pretty cool to

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.040 
and I just think that's pretty cool to
be<00:02:28.709> original<00:02:29.010> and<00:02:29.459> I<00:02:29.580> guess<00:02:29.819> and<00:02:30.120> I<00:02:30.569> get<00:02:30.810> that

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
be original and I guess and I get that

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.190 
be original and I guess and I get that
my<00:02:31.410> like<00:02:31.950> stats<00:02:32.340> will<00:02:32.730> go<00:02:32.940> up<00:02:33.180> because<00:02:33.750> the

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
my like stats will go up because the

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.229 
my like stats will go up because the
summoning<00:02:34.650> monsters<00:02:35.190> I<00:02:35.430> already<00:02:35.670> got<00:02:35.910> me<00:02:36.060> some

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
summoning monsters I already got me some

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:37.190 
summoning monsters I already got me some
new<00:02:36.269> york<00:02:36.480> speaks<00:02:36.690> I'll<00:02:36.900> just<00:02:37.019> mess<00:02:37.170> around

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
new york speaks I'll just mess around

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.710 
new york speaks I'll just mess around
with<00:02:37.560> them<00:02:37.680> but<00:02:38.250> they<00:02:38.580> won't<00:02:39.000> go<00:02:39.150> up<00:02:39.360> to<00:02:39.599> the

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
with them but they won't go up to the

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.900 
with them but they won't go up to the
point<00:02:39.930> and<00:02:40.230> I<00:02:40.470> think<00:02:40.500> the<00:02:40.830> stat<00:02:41.069> which<00:02:41.580> I<00:02:41.760> will

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
point and I think the stat which I will

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.059 
point and I think the stat which I will
get<00:02:42.090> up<00:02:42.299> will<00:02:42.540> probably<00:02:42.870> be<00:02:43.049> defense<00:02:43.530> or<00:02:43.709> magic

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
get up will probably be defense or magic

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:45.920 
get up will probably be defense or magic
but<00:02:44.580> they<00:02:44.700> won't<00:02:44.879> go<00:02:45.030> up<00:02:45.150> to<00:02:45.299> the<00:02:45.420> point<00:02:45.630> where

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
but they won't go up to the point where

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.350 
but they won't go up to the point where
they're<00:02:46.080> like<00:02:46.260> 99<00:02:46.860> they<00:02:47.519> won't<00:02:47.730> like<00:02:47.970> they

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
they're like 99 they won't like they

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.229 
they're like 99 they won't like they
might<00:02:48.799> go<00:02:49.799> up<00:02:49.980> and<00:02:50.190> they'll<00:02:50.310> probably<00:02:50.489> end<00:02:50.910> up

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
might go up and they'll probably end up

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:55.220 
might go up and they'll probably end up
at<00:02:51.390> like<00:02:51.510> around<00:02:52.380> 20<00:02:52.890> ish<00:02:53.269> but<00:02:54.269> after<00:02:54.569> a<00:02:54.959> lot<00:02:55.170> of
