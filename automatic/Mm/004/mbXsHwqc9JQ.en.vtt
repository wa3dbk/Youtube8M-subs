00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 and approach to the natural sciences 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:07.770
 of elementary school research 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:10.290
 field since its inception man has 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.780
 progressed in the cultural and 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.690
 technological however biologically 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.940
 has evolved relatively little 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.100
 its biological development continues 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.140
 depending on natural processes that 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.900
 originated and evolved in the 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.630
 context of ecological systems in the 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.630
 present oxygen and feed us 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.540
 protein carbohydrates and fats still 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.030
 being a need the ecosystem has 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.550
 been recognized since then as a 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.340
 fundamental unit of organization in 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.579
 ecology and a structural unit of the 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:47.340
 biosphere is like jose manuel more and 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:50.280
 angelina martínez and richard introduce 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:53.100
 his treatise on ecosystems in the 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.719
 next report we will analyze one of 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.629
 the situations that afflict the 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.030
 humanity at a global level is a subject of 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.340
 international interest 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.920
 and organizations concerned 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:06.860
 worldwide, drawing the attention of 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.020
 countries of the first world the subject to which 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:12.830
 we are referring to pollution 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:15.530
 environmental as well as its direct effects 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:18.649
 about ecosystems we will also do 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:21.830
 emphasis on functional proposals for 

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:24.530
 education awareness and better 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:27.190
 garbage control all this in the 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:30.520
 context of the village community 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:33.050
 c-25 of a tabasco ring the town 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.229
 c-25 is located in the 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:39.950
 cardenas coatzacoalcos road 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:42.850
 kilometer 80 and 5.5 belonging to the plan 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:47.090
 chontalpa and has a population 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:49.100
 approximately 2,500 inhabitants is a 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:52.250
 rural community that has the 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:55.159
 basic services such as electricity and water 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:57.619
 most of the drinking and health services 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:02:00.500
 of families have their dumpster in 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:03.409
 the courtyards of their houses in other cases 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.610
 the garbage is deposited in a plot of land 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:07.370
 wasteland 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.590
 of drainage or commonly called drink 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:11.900
 which is on the side of the 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.780
 community and very close to housing 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:17.510
 but it's not very common just some 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:20.030
 families do this this causes it to 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.730
 deteriorate and contaminate systems 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:25.280
 sewers causing accumulation 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:28.730
 of waste and garbage that clog the 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:31.190
 water passage causing flooding in 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:34.160
 rain times becoming too 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:36.890
 in a cause of infections for 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.680
 people who live near this the 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:42.440
 ecosystem of which we speak is the savannah 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:45.440
 and the animals may be affected 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:49.100
 for the reasons that we already mentioned such is 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:51.650
 the case of the armadillo and its own iguanas 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:54.320
 of these ecosystems and they are found 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.120
 endangered species like the 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.400
 dogs that can die for 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:01.489
 poisoning when consuming some poison 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.770
 expensive or waste toxin the 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:06.350
 community does not have a dumpster 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:09.190
 formally established but with a 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:12.250
 vacant lot that is not very big 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:15.010
 there is no garbage classification and 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:18.190
 sometimes some people of scarce 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:20.410
 resources look for reusable things in 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.840
 said dump the inhabitants of this 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:26.200
 community if they are affected by 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:28.810
 causes already mentioned and currently not 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:31.810
 measures have been taken to stop said 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:34.630
 pollution this is due to a scarce 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:37.210
 ecological culture or low education about 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:40.150
 environmental care the people of the 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:42.880
 community is used to burning garbage 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:46.480
 without first separating it burning at the same time 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:48.760
 blue plastic liquid batteries and 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.380
 organic matter and although the community 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.150
 It is small and rural 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:54.760
 we can say that it affects the environment 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:57.210
 environment because when you burn it 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:59.680
 create toxins that damage oxygen 

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:02.650
 causing changes in the air that 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.930
 we breathe and the atmosphere damaging the 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:07.450
 ozone layer that is the gas layer 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:10.030
 responsible for protecting our planet 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:11.380
 of the direct effects of lightning 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:13.930
 ultraviolet 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:16.780
 of the sun and that are causing damage to 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:19.180
 health and ecosystems first of all 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:22.450
 this scenario the first thing to do 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:24.790
 is to ask ourselves what our 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:26.890
 proposals to improve all this 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:29.320
 situation in response to this 

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:31.180
 we will mention some elements that 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.940
 can help contribute the 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:36.220
 improvement of the environment first of all 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:38.890
 campaigns should be carried out 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:40.630
 awareness in the community where 

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:43.210
 explain the effects that the 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:45.900
 pollution causes the environment 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:48.460
 as well as the damage to health 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:51.040
 also raise awareness about the damages that 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:53.440
 are caused by burning the garbage should 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:55.600
 carry out educational campaigns to 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:58.360
 teach people the importance of 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:01.240
 classify garbage and especially the 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:04.540
 importance of recycling should be placed 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:07.000
 posters paint fences and make spots 

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:09.540
 in the local sound or where it's done 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.030
 emphasis on the care of the environment 

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:14.370
 the local delegation must carry out 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:16.320
 agreements with companies in charge of 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:18.360
 care of the environment and place 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:21.180
 garbage containers in areas 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:24.000
 specials and garbage cans in the 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:26.730
 streets the local delegation together 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.370
 with the municipality they must designate a place 

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:31.680
 special as a public dumpster and 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:34.470
 particular way must be shared 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:36.960
 brochures and triptychs to the inhabitants of 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:40.320
 the commune easy to spot this problem 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:42.990
 anywhere and whenever we are 

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:46.050
 witnesses to this we also mention it 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:49.050
 and most of the time we look for a 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:50.760
 responsible but the reality is that every 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:53.340
 one of us have the 

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:55.490
 responsibility to care for and maintain 

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:58.560
 optimal conditions our ecosystems 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:06:01.110
 since from them emanates the oxygen that 

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:04.710
 we breathe and each of the parts that 

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:08.030
 make them up are vitally important 'for 

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:12.520
 maintain a better quality of life
