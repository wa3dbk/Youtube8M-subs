00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:15.860
 found today for a watch 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:18.949
 for a new video on one on the 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:23.119
 edition namely suri potter which is a 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:24.470
 room catry known today I 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:27.320
 would you like to see this video too 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:29.449
 this video has the physical and 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.189
 the healthy as community vassal and 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:35.420
 other community scenes so 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:37.969
 possible firstly the author jk 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.379
 Rowling imagined a scathing of the 

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:41.510
 delay of a train for a trip from 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:43.430
 master of hands jespere are worth between this 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.109
 which seems a little weird because seen 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.350
 that the saga was very well known a lot of 

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:47.350
 success 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.760
 the first thing to know is that 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.710
 the author jk rowling imagine describe the 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.270
 holy grail fantasy of the delay of a 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.730
 train for a trip of at least 7 from 

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:09.910
 manchester in london which is a little 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:12.540
 weird because pascal gets worse 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:14.860
 experienced a great success secondly 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.110
 the books had been sold in June 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.240
 2011 to more than 450 million 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.510
 of copies and translated into almost 70 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.510
 languages 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:27.070
 we thought the third thing to know if 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:29.170
 that evanna lynch which is related to good 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.780
 was just an end of harry potter and 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:35.619
 his favorite character of the moons by 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:37.240
 fourth chance a space dedicated to 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:39.850
 harry potter was offered to universal 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.530
 island of adventure in florida 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.490
 and this is where it should be noted that this 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.290
 that it's one of the biggest 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.479

 a thing that refuses to refuse them 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:59.460
 it's a bit silly of him because 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:02.410
 the book as a very great success 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:05.020

 preventing the necklace boyne to his gesture 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:04.739
 it's a disease that prevents a little 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:07.290
 to do the gestures quickly 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:09.739
