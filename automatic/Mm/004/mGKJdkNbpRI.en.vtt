00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.429
 Thus 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:26.550
 Hello, how about youtube friends? 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.650
 welcome to another edition of this his 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.509
 techno project channel your friend talks to you 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.760
 david towers and this time delivered 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:37.680
 a play station emulator a called 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:40.080
 ps x ps x 1 point 13 that will help us 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.620
 to emulate and play games 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:46.410
 playstation one on our pc because of 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.299
 that this program does not ask for many 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.070
 system requirements and it is very 

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:52.680
 light because I believe that in most 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.420
 current computers may run 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.920
 without any problem the first thing that 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.530
 we have to do is go to our 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:02.250
 browser in the description I will leave you 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:05.190
