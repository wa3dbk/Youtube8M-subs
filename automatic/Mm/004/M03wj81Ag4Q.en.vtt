00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
the working man number one here we go

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.840 
the working man number one here we go
they<00:01:42.119> just<00:01:42.150> take<00:01:43.049> it<00:01:43.259> and<00:01:43.439> put<00:01:44.340> it<00:01:44.460> inside<00:01:44.610> the

they just take it and put it inside the

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.690 
they just take it and put it inside the
stage<00:01:45.270> and<00:01:45.630> now<00:01:46.409> I<00:01:46.619> can<00:01:46.950> add<00:01:47.130> all<00:01:47.490> the

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
stage and now I can add all the

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.050 
stage and now I can add all the
keyframes<00:01:47.909> I<00:01:48.390> want<00:01:48.600> pressing<00:01:49.320> f5<00:01:49.710> and<00:01:50.070> here<00:01:51.030> I

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
keyframes I want pressing f5 and here I

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.999 
keyframes I want pressing f5 and here I
go<00:01:51.299> I<00:01:51.890> have<00:01:52.890> a<00:01:52.950> whole<00:01:53.460> work<00:01:53.700> cycle<00:01:54.229> in<00:01:55.229> only<00:01:55.680> one

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
go I have a whole work cycle in only one

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.850 
go I have a whole work cycle in only one
level<00:01:56.369> and<00:01:56.759> only<00:01:57.119> one<00:01:57.329> keyframe<00:01:57.780> if<00:01:58.469> I<00:01:58.710> go

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
level and only one keyframe if I go

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.060 
level and only one keyframe if I go
inside<00:01:59.070> my<00:01:59.579> symbol<00:02:00.030> for<00:02:00.350> the<00:02:01.350> symbols<00:02:01.799> to<00:02:01.920> know

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
inside my symbol for the symbols to know

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.980 
inside my symbol for the symbols to know
more<00:02:02.399> about<00:02:02.430> symbol<00:02:03.030> just<00:02:03.240> look<00:02:03.450> at<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:03.750> past

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
more about symbol just look at the past

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.419 
more about symbol just look at the past
tutorials<00:02:04.590> and<00:02:06.200> once<00:02:07.200> flash<00:02:07.649> goes<00:02:08.069> and

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
tutorials and once flash goes and

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.330 
tutorials and once flash goes and
calculate<00:02:09.420> all<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:09.959> frames<00:02:10.259> when<00:02:10.739> he<00:02:10.830> arrives

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
calculate all the frames when he arrives

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.120 
calculate all the frames when he arrives
to<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:11.940> last<00:02:12.150> one<00:02:12.420> he<00:02:12.690> could

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
to the last one he could

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.480 
to the last one he could
to<00:02:13.250> the<00:02:13.340> first<00:02:13.610> one<00:02:13.700> so<00:02:14.510> it's<00:02:14.750> a<00:02:14.870> loop<00:02:15.490> it's

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
to the first one so it's a loop it's

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:20.350 
to the first one so it's a loop it's
very<00:02:16.700> useful<00:02:17.210> because<00:02:17.360> you<00:02:18.280> know<00:02:19.280> I<00:02:19.490> have<00:02:20.150> this

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
very useful because you know I have this

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.680 
very useful because you know I have this
so<00:02:21.260> I<00:02:21.290> can<00:02:21.620> decide<00:02:21.980> to<00:02:22.340> let<00:02:22.520> my<00:02:22.790> men<00:02:23.180> and<00:02:23.450> walk

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
so I can decide to let my men and walk

on his place all over the time or I can

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.290 
on his place all over the time or I can
choose<00:02:27.110> to<00:02:27.380> move<00:02:27.530> my<00:02:27.830> knot<00:02:28.280> from<00:02:28.580> right<00:02:29.270> to

here and show so see this and you don't
understand<00:02:56.390> that<00:02:56.570> just<00:02:56.810> look<00:02:57.050> at<00:02:57.200> the<00:02:57.290> past

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
understand that just look at the past

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.090 
understand that just look at the past
tutorials<00:02:58.010> as<00:02:58.310> any<00:02:59.180> symbol<00:02:59.840> I<00:03:00.020> can<00:03:00.530> you<00:03:00.920> know

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
tutorials as any symbol I can you know

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:05.170 
tutorials as any symbol I can you know
stretch<00:03:01.730> and<00:03:02.180> move<00:03:02.390> them<00:03:03.550> and<00:03:04.550> do<00:03:04.700> like<00:03:04.940> this

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
stretch and move them and do like this

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:10.210 
stretch and move them and do like this
or<00:03:05.540> maybe<00:03:06.110> no<00:03:06.860> change<00:03:07.340> color<00:03:08.200> maybe<00:03:09.200> he<00:03:09.890> is

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
or maybe no change color maybe he is

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.210 
or maybe no change color maybe he is
going<00:03:10.700> in<00:03:10.850> a<00:03:10.970> radioactive<00:03:11.720> area<00:03:12.200> and<00:03:13.010> he's

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
going in a radioactive area and he's

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.180 
going in a radioactive area and he's
going<00:03:13.760> all<00:03:14.150> green<00:03:14.510> I<00:03:14.780> can<00:03:15.710> put<00:03:15.920> other

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
going all green I can put other

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:19.270 
going all green I can put other
keyframes<00:03:17.000> may<00:03:17.210> be<00:03:17.270> here<00:03:17.660> at<00:03:17.840> six<00:03:18.170> and<00:03:18.470> for<00:03:19.100> one

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
keyframes may be here at six and for one

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.080 
keyframes may be here at six and for one
reason<00:03:19.310> he<00:03:19.850> will<00:03:20.000> go<00:03:20.150> down<00:03:21.070> it's<00:03:22.070> totally<00:03:22.640> ok

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
reason he will go down it's totally ok

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.950 
reason he will go down it's totally ok
very<00:03:23.930> important<00:03:24.530> and<00:03:24.770> do<00:03:25.070> not<00:03:25.280> move<00:03:25.960> these

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:26.960 
very important and do not move these

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:30.490 
very important and do not move these
keyframes<00:03:27.260> because<00:03:28.040> if<00:03:28.580> you<00:03:28.760> have<00:03:29.500> animated

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
keyframes because if you have animated

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.400 
keyframes because if you have animated
symbol<00:03:31.160> because<00:03:31.550> flash<00:03:31.940> will<00:03:32.750> go<00:03:33.020> little

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
symbol because flash will go little

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:35.440 
symbol because flash will go little
crazy<00:03:33.800> because<00:03:34.100> you<00:03:34.490> don't<00:03:34.700> know<00:03:34.850> which<00:03:35.180> one

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
crazy because you don't know which one

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.190 
crazy because you don't know which one
he<00:03:35.630> has<00:03:35.810> to<00:03:35.840> calculate<00:03:36.590> so<00:03:37.400> if<00:03:37.970> I<00:03:38.390> show<00:03:38.960> you

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
he has to calculate so if I show you

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.600 
he has to calculate so if I show you
let's<00:03:39.980> see<00:03:40.190> I<00:03:40.400> put<00:03:41.270> off<00:03:41.510> this<00:03:41.780> and<00:03:42.110> this<00:03:42.370> and<00:03:43.370> I

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 
let's see I put off this and this and I

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.490 
let's see I put off this and this and I
put<00:03:43.820> a<00:03:43.850> new<00:03:44.030> keyframe<00:03:44.450> over<00:03:44.810> here<00:03:45.080> and<00:03:45.380> a

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
put a new keyframe over here and a

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.190 
put a new keyframe over here and a
movement<00:03:45.950> here<00:03:46.280> it's<00:03:46.580> okay<00:03:47.030> so<00:03:47.510> everything<00:03:48.050> is

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200 
movement here it's okay so everything is

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:54.310 
movement here it's okay so everything is
fine<00:03:48.310> but<00:03:49.310> if<00:03:50.180> I<00:03:50.570> just<00:03:50.870> move<00:03:51.530> my<00:03:51.560> keyframe<00:03:53.320> you

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:54.320 
fine but if I just move my keyframe you

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:58.480 
fine but if I just move my keyframe you
see<00:03:54.590> that<00:03:56.140> the<00:03:57.140> legs<00:03:57.320> are<00:03:57.590> not<00:03:57.800> right<00:03:58.130> because

00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:58.490 
see that the legs are not right because

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:03.310 
see that the legs are not right because
he<00:03:59.180> don't<00:03:59.390> know<00:04:00.340> how<00:04:01.340> to<00:04:01.400> calculate<00:04:01.790> so<00:04:02.420> just

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:03.320 
he don't know how to calculate so just

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:06.760 
he don't know how to calculate so just
delayed<00:04:03.800> the<00:04:04.010> frames<00:04:04.310> shift<00:04:05.030> the<00:04:05.300> f6<00:04:05.840> and<00:04:06.170> just

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:06.770 
delayed the frames shift the f6 and just

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:10.270 
delayed the frames shift the f6 and just
put<00:04:06.980> it<00:04:07.100> clear<00:04:07.550> and<00:04:07.700> new<00:04:07.970> and<00:04:08.330> fresh<00:04:09.280> exactly

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 
put it clear and new and fresh exactly

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.170 
put it clear and new and fresh exactly
where<00:04:10.670> you<00:04:10.820> need<00:04:10.850> it<00:04:11.030> I<00:04:12.040> can<00:04:13.040> do<00:04:13.790> another

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:14.180 
where you need it I can do another

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.840 
where you need it I can do another
animation<00:04:14.660> inside<00:04:15.080> animation<00:04:15.740> why<00:04:15.920> not<00:04:16.190> so

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:16.850 
animation inside animation why not so

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:19.630 
animation inside animation why not so
again<00:04:17.840> I<00:04:17.870> will<00:04:18.230> remove<00:04:18.590> the<00:04:18.770> tween<00:04:19.010> I<00:04:19.250> will

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:19.640 
again I will remove the tween I will

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:22.090 
again I will remove the tween I will
remove<00:04:20.000> this<00:04:20.270> key<00:04:20.540> frame<00:04:20.840> shift<00:04:21.350> f6

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:22.100 
remove this key frame shift f6

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:25.159 
remove this key frame shift f6
I<00:04:22.250> will<00:04:22.610> take<00:04:22.850> my<00:04:22.880> guy<00:04:23.300> put<00:04:23.930> it<00:04:24.050> here

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:25.169 
I will take my guy put it here

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:29.540 
I will take my guy put it here
and<00:04:25.789> maybe<00:04:26.789> I<00:04:26.939> want<00:04:27.270> him<00:04:27.569> to<00:04:27.780> blink<00:04:28.020> his<00:04:28.550> eyes

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 
and maybe I want him to blink his eyes

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.230 
and maybe I want him to blink his eyes
once<00:04:30.210> in<00:04:30.419> a<00:04:30.509> while<00:04:30.689> right<00:04:31.110> not<00:04:31.349> so

00:04:35.059 --> 00:04:35.069 
double-click I will go inside my symbol

00:04:35.069 --> 00:04:40.959 
double-click I will go inside my symbol
the<00:04:35.610> walking<00:04:36.060> man<00:04:36.240> I<00:04:36.539> go<00:04:37.379> inside<00:04:37.830> the<00:04:38.129> head<00:04:38.490> and

00:04:40.959 --> 00:04:40.969 

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:44.929 

here<00:04:41.969> I<00:04:42.270> have<00:04:42.479> my<00:04:42.509> drawing<00:04:43.020> I<00:04:43.409> can<00:04:44.069> put<00:04:44.550> some

00:04:44.929 --> 00:04:44.939 
here I have my drawing I can put some

00:04:44.939 --> 00:04:46.790 
here I have my drawing I can put some
frames<00:04:45.270> not<00:04:45.599> that<00:04:45.930> much<00:04:46.199> because<00:04:46.469> it's<00:04:46.770> not

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 
frames not that much because it's not

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.159 
frames not that much because it's not
the<00:04:47.069> long<00:04:47.250> animation<00:04:47.849> so<00:04:48.090> don't<00:04:48.449> put<00:04:48.659> it<00:04:48.780> here

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:49.169 
the long animation so don't put it here

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:54.230 
the long animation so don't put it here
just<00:04:49.639> you<00:04:50.639> know<00:04:50.669> how<00:04:51.599> much<00:04:51.810> it<00:04:51.990> it's<00:04:52.969> 19<00:04:53.969> frame

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240 
just you know how much it it's 19 frame

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.559 
just you know how much it it's 19 frame
so<00:04:54.650> we<00:04:55.650> have<00:04:55.830> to<00:04:56.009> stay<00:04:56.219> inside<00:04:56.789> the<00:04:56.969> 19<00:04:57.330> frames

00:04:57.559 --> 00:04:57.569 
so we have to stay inside the 19 frames

00:04:57.569 --> 00:05:02.149 
so we have to stay inside the 19 frames
I<00:04:57.840> can<00:04:57.870> see<00:04:58.400> tell<00:04:59.400> this<00:04:59.879> is<00:05:00.090> okay<00:05:00.419> so<00:05:01.289> at<00:05:01.710> frame

00:05:02.149 --> 00:05:02.159 
I can see tell this is okay so at frame

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:07.760 
I can see tell this is okay so at frame

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770 
is thick f5 and a new keyframe at 6 and

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:11.839 
is thick f5 and a new keyframe at 6 and
a<00:05:07.800> frame<00:05:08.190> at<00:05:08.610> 5<00:05:10.050> okay<00:05:10.710> when<00:05:11.159> I'm<00:05:11.310> here<00:05:11.639> I
