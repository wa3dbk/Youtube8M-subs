was<00:00:40.350> actually<00:00:40.860> not<00:00:41.340> because<00:00:41.610> of<00:00:41.640> its

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
was actually not because of its

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.690 
was actually not because of its
practicality<00:00:42.620> or<00:00:43.620> anything<00:00:43.890> like<00:00:44.190> that<00:00:44.219> it

about<00:01:50.759> four<00:01:51.210> years<00:01:51.409> I<00:01:52.409> was<00:01:53.250> completely

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
about four years I was completely

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.730 
about four years I was completely
obsessed<00:01:54.119> with<00:01:54.390> finding<00:01:54.659> a<00:01:54.840> gray<00:01:55.020> handbag<00:01:55.500> and

obsessed with finding a gray handbag and

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.340 
obsessed with finding a gray handbag and
I<00:01:55.979> never<00:01:56.219> found<00:01:56.520> one<00:01:56.700> that<00:01:56.880> I<00:01:56.969> loved<00:01:57.210> and<00:01:57.509> from

I never found one that I loved and from
the<00:01:58.439> moment<00:01:58.829> I<00:01:58.950> saw<00:01:59.159> this<00:01:59.310> handbag<00:01:59.790> I<00:02:00.060> just

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
perfect gray color it's just light

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.270 
perfect gray color it's just light
enough<00:02:06.149> but<00:02:06.630> just<00:02:06.960> dark<00:02:07.259> enough

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
enough but just dark enough

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.050 
enough but just dark enough
it's<00:02:08.420> just<00:02:09.420> a<00:02:09.539> gorgeous<00:02:09.959> true<00:02:10.860> gray<00:02:11.459> just<00:02:11.910> I

it's just a gorgeous true gray just I

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.809 
it's just a gorgeous true gray just I
guess<00:02:12.240> a<00:02:12.270> stone<00:02:12.750> gray<00:02:13.140> you<00:02:13.200> could<00:02:13.500> call<00:02:13.709> it<00:02:13.890> and

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
guess a stone gray you could call it and

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:16.640 
guess a stone gray you could call it and
then<00:02:14.970> it<00:02:15.090> has<00:02:15.240> the<00:02:15.450> gunmetal<00:02:16.050> I<00:02:16.380> don't<00:02:16.590> know

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
then it has the gunmetal I don't know

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.250 
then it has the gunmetal I don't know
what<00:02:16.800> the<00:02:16.950> name<00:02:17.310> of<00:02:17.340> the<00:02:17.580> actual<00:02:18.080> hardware<00:02:19.080> is

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
what the name of the actual hardware is

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.559 
what the name of the actual hardware is
on<00:02:19.440> this<00:02:19.620> but<00:02:20.340> first<00:02:20.610> of<00:02:20.760> all<00:02:20.880> obviously<00:02:21.060> is

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
on this but first of all obviously is

you would have probably chosen the

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.170 
you would have probably chosen the
classic<00:02:29.989> Chanel<00:02:30.989> double<00:02:31.319> flap<00:02:31.590> but<00:02:32.459> I<00:02:32.730> have<00:02:33.000> to

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
classic Chanel double flap but I have to

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.199 
classic Chanel double flap but I have to
admit<00:02:33.239> that<00:02:33.510> I<00:02:33.989> actually<00:02:34.350> prefer<00:02:34.830> this<00:02:35.280> style

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
admit that I actually prefer this style

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.750 
admit that I actually prefer this style
now<00:02:36.870> I<00:02:36.900> was<00:02:37.319> never<00:02:37.590> kind<00:02:37.890> of<00:02:37.950> a<00:02:38.040> massive<00:02:38.520> fan

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
now I was never kind of a massive fan

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.140 
now I was never kind of a massive fan
and<00:02:39.120> I<00:02:39.989> have<00:02:40.440> to<00:02:40.560> admit<00:02:40.769> that<00:02:40.830> my<00:02:41.430> style<00:02:41.850> isn't

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
and I have to admit that my style isn't

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.610 
and I have to admit that my style isn't
that<00:02:42.600> kind<00:02:42.900> of<00:02:42.930> rocker

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
that kind of rocker

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.770 
that kind of rocker
esque<00:02:43.830> I'm<00:02:44.160> not<00:02:44.400> actually<00:02:44.610> that<00:02:45.120> cool<00:02:45.450> when

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
esque I'm not actually that cool when

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.630 
esque I'm not actually that cool when
you<00:02:45.900> come<00:02:46.110> to<00:02:46.230> think<00:02:46.380> of<00:02:46.530> it<00:02:46.650> I<00:02:46.860> try<00:02:47.160> to<00:02:47.190> be<00:02:47.370> I

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
you come to think of it I try to be I

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.880 
you come to think of it I try to be I
try<00:02:48.060> to<00:02:48.120> pretend<00:02:48.570> that<00:02:48.690> I'm<00:02:49.050> just<00:02:49.560> the<00:02:49.680> coolest

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
try to pretend that I'm just the coolest

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.540 
try to pretend that I'm just the coolest
girl<00:02:50.250> around<00:02:50.519> and<00:02:50.970> that<00:02:51.720> is<00:02:51.930> why<00:02:52.170> I<00:02:52.620> chose<00:02:53.310> this

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
girl around and that is why I chose this

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.570 
girl around and that is why I chose this
bag<00:02:53.880> this<00:02:54.030> is<00:02:54.090> just<00:02:54.690> by<00:02:54.870> far<00:02:55.200> the<00:02:55.709> coolest<00:02:56.040> bag

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
bag this is just by far the coolest bag

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.110 
bag this is just by far the coolest bag
I<00:02:56.910> reckon<00:02:57.480> that<00:02:58.019> Chanel<00:02:58.769> have<00:02:59.190> in<00:02:59.940> their

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
I reckon that Chanel have in their

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.850 
I reckon that Chanel have in their
collections<00:03:00.660> I<00:03:00.930> think<00:03:01.380> that<00:03:01.530> they're<00:03:01.680> just

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
collections I think that they're just

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.490 
collections I think that they're just
really<00:03:02.250> really<00:03:02.940> cool<00:03:03.209> they're<00:03:03.510> really<00:03:03.900> just

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
really really cool they're really just

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.670 
really really cool they're really just
there<00:03:05.220> I<00:03:05.459> think<00:03:05.519> that<00:03:05.910> quite<00:03:06.120> understated

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
there I think that quite understated

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.140 
there I think that quite understated
they're<00:03:07.680> not<00:03:07.860> kind<00:03:08.100> of<00:03:08.130> in-your-face<00:03:08.340> at<00:03:08.940> all

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
they're not kind of in-your-face at all

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.900 
they're not kind of in-your-face at all
and<00:03:09.530> but<00:03:10.530> you<00:03:10.650> know<00:03:10.830> what<00:03:11.069> it<00:03:11.190> is<00:03:11.280> when<00:03:11.550> you<00:03:11.670> see

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
and but you know what it is when you see

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.120 
and but you know what it is when you see
it<00:03:12.060> if<00:03:12.239> you<00:03:12.480> see<00:03:12.630> what<00:03:12.750> I<00:03:12.810> mean<00:03:12.959> the<00:03:13.260> strap<00:03:13.860> can

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
it if you see what I mean the strap can

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.030 
it if you see what I mean the strap can
go<00:03:14.310> double<00:03:14.880> or<00:03:15.060> it<00:03:15.510> can<00:03:15.660> go<00:03:15.810> long<00:03:16.110> I<00:03:16.380> wear<00:03:16.860> mine
