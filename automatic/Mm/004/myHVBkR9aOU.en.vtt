bought probably eight or ten inch I know
what<00:00:19.020> I'm<00:00:19.109> going<00:00:19.230> to<00:00:19.260> do<00:00:19.350> is<00:00:19.500> make<00:00:19.770> a<00:00:19.800> ring<00:00:20.160> that

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
what I'm going to do is make a ring that

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.609 
what I'm going to do is make a ring that
will<00:00:21.300> go<00:00:21.480> around<00:00:21.630> this<00:00:22.080> pot<00:00:24.260> for<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.320> rocket

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
will go around this pot for the rocket

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.700 
will go around this pot for the rocket
stove<00:00:25.910> and<00:00:26.910> what<00:00:27.119> I'm<00:00:27.300> finding<00:00:28.230> out<00:00:28.470> is

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
stove and what I'm finding out is

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.600 
stove and what I'm finding out is
without<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.429> ring<00:00:30.769> it's<00:00:31.769> just<00:00:32.430> about

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
without the ring it's just about

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.270 
without the ring it's just about
impossible<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.390> boil<00:00:33.780> water<00:00:34.280> without

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
impossible the boil water without

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.910 
impossible the boil water without
focusing<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.480> heat<00:00:36.719> up<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.230> sides<00:00:37.500> of<00:00:37.829> the

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
focusing the heat up the sides of the

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.819 
focusing the heat up the sides of the
pot<00:00:38.129> so<00:00:39.020> I'm<00:00:40.020> going<00:00:40.170> to<00:00:40.230> show<00:00:40.379> you<00:00:40.410> how<00:00:40.590> to<00:00:40.680> make

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
pot so I'm going to show you how to make

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.720 
pot so I'm going to show you how to make
a<00:00:40.860> ring<00:00:41.219> real<00:00:41.489> quick<00:00:42.469> and<00:00:43.469> then<00:00:43.649> I'm<00:00:44.489> going<00:00:44.700> to

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
a ring real quick and then I'm going to

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.310 
a ring real quick and then I'm going to
see<00:00:44.850> how<00:00:44.969> long<00:00:45.149> would<00:00:45.270> it<00:00:45.329> take<00:00:45.420> to<00:00:45.600> boil<00:00:45.960> one

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
see how long would it take to boil one

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:52.720 
see how long would it take to boil one
full<00:00:46.620> gallon<00:00:47.070> of<00:00:47.460> water<00:00:50.149> okay<00:00:51.289> what<00:00:52.289> I<00:00:52.320> did<00:00:52.410> was
