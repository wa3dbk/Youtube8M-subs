 a new clash of a clear reschke plan 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:22.000
 Let's play here today on Wednesday and 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.759

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:28.149
 session of doom I do it like you 

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:29.919
 because we are currently in one 

00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:32.050
 small war in a small war my 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:33.610
 man also the smallest small war or 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.860
 better said yes it is the smallest 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:38.680
 small war I ever fought with 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.360
 we are currently the ten against 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.820
 ten, I think five to five in the 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:45.760
 We have made the smallest 13 interventions 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.780
 15 opponents against 20 on us 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.030
 have 13 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.489
 I now have another attack left 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.620
 At the moment, I am still in troupe 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:57.070
 they are fast 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:59.200
 beautiful bow was 1 and 2 packers 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.270
 and I already had an intervention 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:04.479
 made exactly and that was the one here 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:06.670
 I'll show you 69 percent now 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:08.320
 I was here with exactly 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.299
 actually in all the same troops only 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.159
 that I had no lackeys with me 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:13.990
 I'll let it all in now 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:15.609
 Run a little faster than in the beginning 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.429
 I really only have the outer ones 

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:19.899
 completely exterior building because of and now 

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:21.880
 I think it's exciting up here 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:25.359
 up here I hope I have the 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:27.939
 At the moment you will see the moment you are seated 

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:29.920
 We destroyed everything the clammy book below 

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:32.619
 the air just no that the 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.479
 glamor tecklenburg here and there 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:36.639
 now we have to look exactly me 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:38.829
 have used wonderful here and that 

00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:40.869
 dream picture a bit slower and slower 

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:43.209
 here, of course, with all my drums 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:45.340
 rheins whether clay was or what does that mean 

00:01:43.209 --> 00:01:47.229
 problem was in the glamor kicker and 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.719
 my point protect queen has 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:52.450
 now, of course, especially here on the whole 

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:55.060
 time the beautiful pack attacked 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.679
 that took a lot of time in 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.779
 In the meantime, my dad is king 

00:01:56.679 --> 00:02:00.909
 been here almost in the middle 

00:01:58.779 --> 00:02:05.079
 but instead of running to the wheel 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:07.240
 he prefers to go outside but then 

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:09.420
 thank god with the vut clean and the 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.530
 bowmen cancel every wheel 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.420
 taken away and now of course the 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.880
 opposing 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.620
 Protecting queen and a king of the above 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.900
 opponents already do not banks will be here 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.190
 from my own orbit king features 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.140
 that is very clear 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.640
 but of course it will be clear here 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.800
 Burg did not attack here and again 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.330
 tried something to travel by bus 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.860
 maybe a little bit hurt too 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.850
 were somehow come in 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:34.200
 but there was unfortunately the quasi 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.850
 troop strength of my troop too weak 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.989
 unfortunately, here are the attacks 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.630
 surrounded by the enemy 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:41.849
 archer queen but that irritates that 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.680
 good she does not have my bowmen 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:45.150
 queen intervened I called my 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.840
 now also beautiful painters here 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.790
 pick up 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.910
 but that was already the case 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:53.280
 end here exactly the opponent 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.489
 archer queen has mine then 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:58.170
 pretty much the rest 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:59.819
 63% two stones I'm satisfied with that 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.140
 I'm curious what we will next 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:04.160
 attack 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:07.260
 Of course, two stalls are here again 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.549
 must now shows time I will 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.100
 probably not work in now 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:12.299
 the recording I always have the intervention 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.799
 also on my cellphone 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:16.769
 Mobile phones are still a bit lighter 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:19.170
 as s.PC then there s.pc of course 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:22.200
 only one hand to possibility has here 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:24.989
 still something to travel and I would 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:28.049
 times before I say again yet 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:30.390
 a little new arrival we tear in here 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:32.700
 we fight against the tear here 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:35.430
 opponents and then we should one 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:39.480
 act strategically meaningful while the 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:41.640
 of course here at the village where 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.920
 First of all, this is called our building 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.780
 blow away and then we are all 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.910
 happy i hope the cannon die 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.269
 matte sda ​​nothing may not come 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.609
 down 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:52.680
 I have to look, maybe we can 

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:55.470
 as many buildings outside as possible 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:57.600
 without us first of the 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:00.930
 guns are attacked clearly whether the 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:03.959
 comes out should just be ok 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:06.660
 martinek hamburg are now attacking 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:10.410
 first to the Klamm castle clam castle 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:13.380
 If you die, you will die small labels 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:14.760
 so do the gorge warriors are there and we 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.459
 have a bowman notice and 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:22.010
 a few train king here both in the 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:22.010
 middle installation we quickly the side 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:25.220
 to get to know 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:34.500
 max somehow little sense when I enter 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:36.600
 strong it makes me feel so and now 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.140
 now my love will be crisp 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.660
 friends 

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:40.950
 now I have to decide or above 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:44.040
 or below 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:46.470
 the decision that falls to me now and 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:48.180
 we go in below if ours 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:54.120
 beautiful sound castle are there 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:56.100
 beautiful seat straight balloons yes 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:58.350
 we have beautiful balloons the 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:01.130
 But now, where do they go? 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:05.450
 where are you going? 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:09.780
 ok concentration it is not much yet 

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:12.750
 gone bad we have 39 39 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:14.700
 percent my friends we can here 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:16.800
 do something else yes we can do something else 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:18.450
 I do of course hope meaningful 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.680
 how come closer and closer in the middle though 

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:21.870
 the wheel or I have to admit 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:24.960
 etter on peu is really well chosen 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:26.700
 he is well set and set well 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.130
 Now it will be exciting to create 

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:30.600
 here yes 50 53 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:32.490
 my dear friends we have it 

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.210
 sadly no star managed two 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:36.510
 stars 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:37.320
 we have to look profitable now 

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:38.970
 not anymore 

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:40.290
 but if you look at the construction 

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:42.120
 watch if I went in the top 

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:44.100
 Of course, the walls would be in the way 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:45.870
 and maybe it would have been 

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:49.190
 I do not think so 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:52.620
 packers just died a percent 59 

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:54.630
 yes, two stars would of course be unique 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:57.420
 I would have been better then 

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:59.430
 but probably make expensive groups 

00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:00.990
 I just had to and just had to 

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:03.060
 not the time 14 stars we have 

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:05.220
 the opponents are currently 20 

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:08.700
 Attack more we have now 

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:10.860
 still currently from walding king and the 

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:13.260
 music going on otherwise we think so 

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:15.180
 every attacked just then, of course 

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.480
 of the six others left 

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:16.920
 are 

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:18.540
 they still have the two too 

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:20.250
 maybe one of the attacks creates 

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:22.590
 where two stars in both 

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:24.960
 then landlord I'm curious 

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:25.770
 what is still there today and me completely 

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:27.420
 in any case already 

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:28.480
 say I 've kept on fighting 

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:30.910
