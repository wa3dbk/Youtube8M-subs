00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.659

00:00:24.659 --> 00:00:27.239
 cradles deputy dry grass and yes 

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:29.609
 the poor will be cast 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.609
 visually 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.080
 small breakfast 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:39.860
 we are ready 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:41.010
 nomination 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.010
 acts 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.820
 this is our dog named fight old 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.660
 the hospital only last year 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:51.710
 there were 65 points 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.660
 since from rise to 12 years 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:54.479
 his life 

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:57.479
 will not tell even the owner 0 narrow field 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.230
 our whole team or as they call here 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.230
 artek after the fight if there is 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.140
 secondly this time 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.140
 no if this feeling 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.280
 not 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:20.390
 while it will be 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.610
 for good slack 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.610
 after getting my hands 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.460
 and this should happen 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.500
 The first hare caught today was 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:33.520
 noise 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.970
 that is, the site raised a hunter in it hit 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.470
 soles shot relatively 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.500
 accidentally without a dog 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.560
 the shot was the books of the building therefore 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.560
 rush is not very aesthetic 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.180
 books 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.860
 also organized under threat for this 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.110
 consider the picture 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.400
 here you will see how hunters move from 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.390
 Abakan dog find will contact yo and 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.560
 raises a hare draw May which 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:00.710
 called races 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.340
 the dog moves will respond to 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.590
 decent distance sometimes per kilometer 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.950
 the hare running away confuses the trail to do so 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.910
 called discounts however there is one 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.300
 the hare feature avoids circles or 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.380
 in a spiral and usually go person 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.209
 my daughter 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:16.450
 so the hunters the easiest way to wait for him 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.450
 standing still 

00:02:22.189 --> 00:02:24.689
 it is true that the hunters will try 

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:25.509
 under the year 

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:27.669
 but there is a danger of shooting 

00:02:27.669 --> 00:02:30.099
 a hare can get into a neighbor so 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:33.099
 I do only experienced hunters 

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:37.039
 all 

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:39.759
 so collapse 

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:42.119
 This site has been produced for a year. 

00:02:42.119 --> 00:02:44.339
 he went to the second round and went to me 

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:47.099
 he knows 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:50.329
 for 1 st 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:55.290
 Well, firstly it will be difficult in Lviv 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.569
 remember to pay off 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:02.999
 to the front that's why I tell the truth this is 

00:03:02.999 --> 00:03:03.969
 proved 

00:03:03.969 --> 00:03:08.309
 Here it is again importantly fired 

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:09.509
 the hunter must win 

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:11.659
 security availability r out 

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:12.609
 his comrades 

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:14.579
 as well as for the dog 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:16.169
 you can’t shoot they’re only 

00:03:16.169 --> 00:03:18.489
 mosher and lost his job we will go 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:20.669
 further search for the hare sometimes attack 

00:03:20.669 --> 00:03:22.699
 have to go many miles 

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:26.159
 technology allows us to speed up the process 

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:28.260
 what friends walk under 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.779
 popular music 

00:03:30.779 --> 00:03:33.779
 br 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:39.459
 at 

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:51.549
 smartly started working 

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:53.899
 the dog clearly showed up years 

00:03:53.899 --> 00:03:55.869
 characteristic tail swing 

00:03:55.869 --> 00:03:56.949
 quiet 

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:57.900
 time delay 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.699
 they say they live here 

00:03:59.699 --> 00:04:02.819
 it means soon we will rise we will wait 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:10.429
 so it is for it raised 

00:04:10.429 --> 00:04:13.429
 gone year 

00:04:28.349 --> 00:04:29.919
 Obama 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:32.430
 in Tyumen Sergey 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:33.940
 the hare came out 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.809
 not by yourself 

00:04:35.809 --> 00:04:37.419
 about 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:39.559
 Yes 

00:04:39.559 --> 00:04:41.050
 here's a hare 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.960
 whom honestly took from under the dog 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.349
 the hare is good 

00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:47.139
 last year 

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:49.509
 however, we have no time to celebrate 

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:52.509
 and you will still have a long job 

00:04:53.059 --> 00:04:56.289
 a musical pause again the search for their hare 

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:01.789
 So 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.360
 tons 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:16.749
 Here is a wonderful example 

00:05:16.749 --> 00:05:18.399
 when we managed to take two at once 

00:05:18.399 --> 00:05:21.419
 hares one car one noise Andrew 

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:23.279
 trial correctly don't tie tons of sizo 

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:25.399
 not wearing prada soul news and its 

00:05:25.399 --> 00:05:27.909

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:29.800
 what did I manage to take 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.800
 again lucky what to do 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:35.790
 it remains only to say thank you to this 

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:36.749
