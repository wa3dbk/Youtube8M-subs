the<00:00:39.120> stock<00:00:39.360> zo6<00:00:39.930> system<00:00:40.379> does<00:00:40.590> we've

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
the stock zo6 system does we've

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.209 
the stock zo6 system does we've
incorporated<00:00:41.489> an<00:00:41.940> x-pipe<00:00:42.510> in<00:00:42.809> it<00:00:43.530> for<00:00:43.980> more

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
incorporated an x-pipe in it for more

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.350 
incorporated an x-pipe in it for more
torque<00:00:44.579> and<00:00:44.789> more<00:00:44.969> power<00:00:45.649> as<00:00:46.649> I<00:00:46.890> said<00:00:47.129> that<00:00:47.360> we

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
torque and more power as I said that we

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.479 
torque and more power as I said that we
get<00:00:48.719> rid<00:00:48.870> of<00:00:48.989> some<00:00:49.170> weight<00:00:49.379> it's<00:00:49.680> got<00:00:49.890> a<00:00:49.950> really

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:52.489 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:56.330 

really<00:00:53.489> good<00:00:53.670> sound<00:00:54.559> to<00:00:55.559> it<00:00:55.680> it<00:00:55.829> sounds<00:00:56.010> very

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
really good sound to it it sounds very

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.340 
really good sound to it it sounds very
much<00:00:56.640> like<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:57.210> Heritage<00:00:57.660> it<00:00:57.809> comes<00:00:58.050> from

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
much like the Heritage it comes from

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.689 
much like the Heritage it comes from
which<00:00:58.590> is<00:00:58.620> from<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.640> a<00:00:59.910> LMS<00:01:00.390> gt2<00:01:01.699> Corvette

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
which is from the a LMS gt2 Corvette

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.359 
which is from the a LMS gt2 Corvette
Racing<00:01:02.940> program<00:01:03.719> which<00:01:03.989> we've<00:01:04.229> done<00:01:05.129> some

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
Racing program which we've done some

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.429 
Racing program which we've done some
engineering<00:01:05.820> work<00:01:06.060> for<00:01:06.420> they<00:01:06.810> do<00:01:06.869> not<00:01:07.170> use

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
engineering work for they do not use

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.770 
engineering work for they do not use
this<00:01:07.740> system<00:01:08.130> this<00:01:08.250> is<00:01:08.460> applicable<00:01:08.850> to<00:01:09.299> the

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
this system this is applicable to the

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.609 
this system this is applicable to the
street<00:01:10.080> performance<00:01:11.240> and<00:01:12.240> so<00:01:12.750> we're<00:01:12.990> this<00:01:13.470> is

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
street performance and so we're this is

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.950 
street performance and so we're this is
an<00:01:13.740> RD<00:01:14.189> we're<00:01:14.760> not<00:01:14.909> done<00:01:15.180> with<00:01:15.330> it<00:01:15.509> yet<00:01:15.689> we're

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
an RD we're not done with it yet we're

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.140 
an RD we're not done with it yet we're
still<00:01:16.080> tuning<00:01:16.619> on<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.250> sound<00:01:17.490> quality<00:01:18.000> to

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
still tuning on the the sound quality to

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.609 
still tuning on the the sound quality to
get<00:01:18.270> rid<00:01:18.479> of<00:01:19.340> the<00:01:20.840> we've<00:01:21.840> greatly<00:01:22.259> minimized

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
get rid of the we've greatly minimized

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.170 
get rid of the we've greatly minimized
the<00:01:22.830> drone<00:01:23.100> of<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.430> exhaust<00:01:23.700> system<00:01:23.820> at

the drone of the exhaust system at

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.880 
the drone of the exhaust system at
cruising<00:01:24.570> speeds<00:01:24.900> we<00:01:25.110> still<00:01:25.320> have<00:01:25.470> some<00:01:25.710> work

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
cruising speeds we still have some work

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.560 
cruising speeds we still have some work
to<00:01:25.920> do<00:01:26.189> but<00:01:26.430> we<00:01:26.520> wanted<00:01:26.759> to<00:01:26.820> introduce<00:01:27.090> it<00:01:27.450> out

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
to do but we wanted to introduce it out

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.859 
to do but we wanted to introduce it out
here<00:01:27.979> it's<00:01:28.979> a<00:01:29.130> modular<00:01:29.369> system<00:01:29.880> that<00:01:30.329> plugs

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
here it's a modular system that plugs

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.660 
here it's a modular system that plugs
into<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.350> intermediate<00:01:32.340> stock<00:01:33.119> pipe<00:01:33.479> or<00:01:34.670> or

into the intermediate stock pipe or or

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.950 
into the intermediate stock pipe or or
you<00:01:36.030> can<00:01:36.470> utilize<00:01:37.470> our<00:01:37.920> x-pipe<00:01:38.549> assembly<00:01:39.360> when

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
you can utilize our x-pipe assembly when

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.440 
you can utilize our x-pipe assembly when
it<00:01:40.110> gets<00:01:40.530> in<00:01:40.650> its<00:01:40.799> finished<00:01:41.159> form<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:41.729> it's

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
it gets in its finished form and it's

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.060 
it gets in its finished form and it's
made<00:01:42.630> out<00:01:42.659> of<00:01:43.220> good<00:01:44.220> high-quality
