think it's a little bit small it could

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:06.289 
think it's a little bit small it could
be<00:03:04.200> a<00:03:04.230> little<00:03:04.440> bit<00:03:04.680> wider<00:03:04.980> and<00:03:05.310> it<00:03:05.519> gives<00:03:06.120> you<00:03:06.239> a

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 
be a little bit wider and it gives you a

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:08.390

00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:44.299 
very safe secure because of the of the

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:51.979 
very safe secure because of the of the
big<00:03:46.819> things<00:03:47.819> here<00:03:48.470> and<00:03:50.239> so<00:03:51.239> it's<00:03:51.419> it's<00:03:51.690> very

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
safe here at this point now coming to

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.280 
safe here at this point now coming to
the<00:03:55.410> most<00:03:55.949> important<00:03:56.819> part<00:03:57.209> that's<00:03:57.780> the<00:03:58.049> part

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
the most important part that's the part

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.030 
the most important part that's the part
where<00:03:58.500> the<00:03:58.590> camera<00:03:59.010> is<00:03:59.129> in<00:03:59.400> and<00:03:59.669> we<00:03:59.699> have<00:04:00.510> here

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 
where the camera is in and we have here

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:07.189 
where the camera is in and we have here
two<00:04:02.040> of<00:04:02.459> these<00:04:04.160> snappers<00:04:05.160> and<00:04:05.730> the<00:04:06.660> reason<00:04:06.840> is

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:07.199 
two of these snappers and the reason is

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:10.240 
two of these snappers and the reason is
very<00:04:07.290> simple<00:04:07.560> because<00:04:08.069> if<00:04:08.430> you<00:04:08.579> open<00:04:09.209> the

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250 
very simple because if you open the

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:13.369 
very simple because if you open the
compartment<00:04:11.250> where<00:04:11.699> the<00:04:11.790> camera<00:04:12.209> is<00:04:12.329> in<00:04:12.629> the

00:04:13.369 --> 00:04:13.379 
compartment where the camera is in the

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:16.779 
compartment where the camera is in the
zipper<00:04:13.769> stops<00:04:14.280> here<00:04:14.910> and<00:04:15.090> so<00:04:15.780> it<00:04:16.229> couldn't

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:16.789 
zipper stops here and so it couldn't

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:20.000 
zipper stops here and so it couldn't
accidentally<00:04:17.789> open<00:04:18.269> completely<00:04:18.720> and<00:04:19.380> all<00:04:19.829> the

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
accidentally open completely and all the

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:23.540 
accidentally open completely and all the
stuff<00:04:20.340> will<00:04:20.669> fall<00:04:21.000> out<00:04:21.030> so<00:04:21.930> the<00:04:22.890> zipper<00:04:23.250> stop

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
stuff will fall out so the zipper stop

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.629 
stuff will fall out so the zipper stop
here<00:04:24.000> you<00:04:24.479> open<00:04:24.930> and<00:04:25.110> here<00:04:25.590> is<00:04:25.680> a<00:04:25.710> camera

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:26.639 
here you open and here is a camera

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:28.939 
here you open and here is a camera
you<00:04:26.729> can<00:04:26.939> move<00:04:27.150> the<00:04:27.389> camera<00:04:27.659> out<00:04:27.990> and<00:04:28.289> if

00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:28.949 
you can move the camera out and if

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:31.390 
you can move the camera out and if
you're<00:04:29.189> on<00:04:29.759> you<00:04:29.909> on<00:04:30.180> your<00:04:30.330> way<00:04:30.509> with<00:04:30.539> two

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
you're on you on your way with two

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.939 
you're on you on your way with two
persons<00:04:32.400> you<00:04:32.999> can<00:04:33.300> let<00:04:33.569> the<00:04:33.870> backpack<00:04:34.469> on<00:04:34.740> your

00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:34.949 
persons you can let the backpack on your

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:38.119 
persons you can let the backpack on your
shoulder<00:04:35.460> and<00:04:35.689> the<00:04:36.689> second<00:04:37.139> person<00:04:37.349> open<00:04:37.979> the

00:04:38.119 --> 00:04:38.129 
shoulder and the second person open the

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:40.489 
shoulder and the second person open the
zipper<00:04:38.400> and<00:04:38.639> there<00:04:39.479> couldn't<00:04:39.749> be<00:04:39.900> the<00:04:40.229> problem

00:04:40.489 --> 00:04:40.499 
zipper and there couldn't be the problem

00:04:40.499 --> 00:04:43.279 
zipper and there couldn't be the problem
that<00:04:40.860> everything<00:04:41.819> opens<00:04:42.180> up<00:04:42.419> and<00:04:42.749> everything

00:04:43.279 --> 00:04:43.289 
that everything opens up and everything

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:45.619 
that everything opens up and everything
will<00:04:43.499> fall<00:04:43.800> out<00:04:43.860> so<00:04:44.279> I<00:04:44.460> think<00:04:44.729> that's<00:04:44.999> a<00:04:45.210> really

00:04:45.619 --> 00:04:45.629 
will fall out so I think that's a really

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:49.700 
will fall out so I think that's a really
good<00:04:45.870> idea<00:04:46.550> for<00:04:47.550> a<00:04:47.610> safe<00:04:47.999> backpack<00:04:48.419> if<00:04:49.050> you

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
good idea for a safe backpack if you

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:54.260 
good idea for a safe backpack if you
open<00:04:49.919> up<00:04:50.249> the<00:04:50.550> two<00:04:51.889> straps<00:04:52.889> here<00:04:53.310> then<00:04:54.120> you<00:04:54.240> can

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270 
open up the two straps here then you can

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:57.830 
open up the two straps here then you can
open<00:04:54.840> up<00:04:55.020> the<00:04:55.819> compartment<00:04:56.819> where<00:04:57.360> the<00:04:57.449> camera

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 
open up the compartment where the camera

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.950 
open up the compartment where the camera
is<00:04:57.930> in<00:04:58.169> completely<00:04:58.770> you<00:04:59.729> have<00:04:59.909> lots<00:05:00.300> of<00:05:00.509> space

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 
is in completely you have lots of space

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.939 
is in completely you have lots of space

this one here is for a device like an

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:34.579

is enough space enough possibilities to

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:47.209 
is enough space enough possibilities to
make<00:05:43.710> the<00:05:44.099> backpack<00:05:45.029> up<00:05:45.779> to<00:05:46.080> your<00:05:46.259> needs<00:05:46.500> you

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:49.800 
can put a second camera in a second body

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:53.209 
can put a second camera in a second body
of<00:05:50.099> the<00:05:50.250> camera<00:05:50.490> you<00:05:50.729> can<00:05:50.939> put<00:05:51.270> in<00:05:51.469> and<00:05:52.469> so<00:05:53.189> I
