00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.140 
they look very abstract and funky but
this<00:02:25.970> one<00:02:26.300> since<00:02:26.570> there's<00:02:26.810> more<00:02:26.900> detail<00:02:27.710> I

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
this one since there's more detail I

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.210 
this one since there's more detail I
think<00:02:29.150> it<00:02:29.300> has<00:02:29.480> call<00:02:29.900> more<00:02:30.260> the<00:02:30.440> attention<00:02:31.040> of

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
think it has call more the attention of

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.910 
think it has call more the attention of
people<00:02:32.180> like<00:02:32.570> for<00:02:32.780> example<00:02:33.170> when<00:02:33.320> I<00:02:33.350> go<00:02:33.470> to<00:02:33.650> the

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
people like for example when I go to the

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.520 
people like for example when I go to the
supermarket<00:02:34.070> anywhere<00:02:35.060> I<00:02:35.090> go<00:02:35.360> in<00:02:36.080> the<00:02:36.320> last

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
supermarket anywhere I go in the last

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.290 
supermarket anywhere I go in the last
couple<00:02:37.070> days<00:02:37.280> a<00:02:37.340> lot<00:02:37.670> of<00:02:37.730> people<00:02:38.090> have<00:02:38.180> been

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
couple days a lot of people have been

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:39.910 
couple days a lot of people have been
asking<00:02:38.660> me<00:02:38.810> if<00:02:39.020> they<00:02:39.170> can<00:02:39.350> look<00:02:39.530> at<00:02:39.740> my<00:02:39.890> hand

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
asking me if they can look at my hand

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.700 
asking me if they can look at my hand
and<00:02:40.430> it<00:02:41.390> that's<00:02:41.840> when<00:02:42.020> you<00:02:42.140> know<00:02:42.260> that<00:02:42.410> you<00:02:42.530> did

go around the cuticle and you make kind

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:15.820 
go around the cuticle and you make kind
of<00:04:13.820> like<00:04:13.880> a<00:04:13.970> round<00:04:14.330> movement<00:04:14.840> with<00:04:15.050> my<00:04:15.260> pinky<00:04:15.800> I

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:15.830
