is going on with these engines for next
year<00:00:29.880> well<00:00:30.810> firstly<00:00:31.140> I<00:00:31.260> think<00:00:31.470> we<00:00:31.560> have<00:00:31.590> to

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
year well firstly I think we have to

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.860 
year well firstly I think we have to
call<00:00:32.040> and<00:00:32.219> powertrains<00:00:32.730> because<00:00:33.270> they<00:00:33.510> are

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
call and powertrains because they are

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.620 
call and powertrains because they are
much<00:00:34.050> more<00:00:34.230> manjinder<00:00:34.829> going<00:00:35.280> from<00:00:35.460> a<00:00:35.630> 2.4

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630

year<00:00:43.710> we've<00:00:43.860> had<00:00:43.890> purrs<00:00:44.340> next<00:00:45.149> year<00:00:45.300> we're

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
year we've had purrs next year we're

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.090 
year we've had purrs next year we're
calling<00:00:45.660> it<00:00:45.750> as<00:00:46.020> its<00:00:46.350> energy<00:00:46.800> recovery

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
calling it as its energy recovery

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.190 
calling it as its energy recovery
because<00:00:47.520> it's<00:00:47.700> more<00:00:47.940> than<00:00:48.180> just<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.570> kinetic

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
because it's more than just the kinetic

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.799 
because it's more than just the kinetic
which<00:00:49.379> is<00:00:49.559> what<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.160> K<00:00:50.430> is<00:00:50.640> in<00:00:50.879> pairs<00:00:51.239> we<00:00:51.660> have

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
which is what the K is in pairs we have

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.200 
which is what the K is in pairs we have
10<00:00:52.500> times<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:53.010> energy<00:00:53.129> storage<00:00:53.789> and<00:00:54.000> twice

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
horsepower of electric power that we can

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.619 
horsepower of electric power that we can
add<00:00:58.469> to<00:00:58.710> our<00:00:58.890> engine<00:00:59.309> and<00:00:59.820> we<00:01:00.030> can<00:01:00.210> do<00:01:00.329> it<00:01:00.480> for

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
add to our engine and we can do it for

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.439 
add to our engine and we can do it for
around<00:01:00.719> 33<00:01:01.410> seconds<00:01:01.859> as<00:01:02.699> if<00:01:02.879> that<00:01:03.090> wasn't<00:01:03.270> bad

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.600 
of car the front wing is going to be 75
million<00:01:16.259> arrow<00:01:16.409> upper<00:01:16.740> side<00:01:16.979> that<00:01:17.490> will

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
million arrow upper side that will

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.010 
million arrow upper side that will
change<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:17.909> airflow<00:01:18.299> around<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.689> front<00:01:18.930> of

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
change the airflow around the front of

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.050 
change the airflow around the front of
the<00:01:19.110> car<00:01:19.320> but<00:01:19.590> as<00:01:19.770> you<00:01:19.860> go<00:01:20.009> down<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.220> car<00:01:20.549> has<00:01:21.030> a

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
the car but as you go down the car has a

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.940 
the car but as you go down the car has a
massive<00:01:21.270> effect<00:01:21.479> on<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:21.869> diffuser<00:01:22.259> and<00:01:22.470> and

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
massive effect on the diffuser and and

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.859 
massive effect on the diffuser and and
everything<00:01:23.159> behind<00:01:23.369> it<00:01:23.640> so<00:01:24.060> that<00:01:24.299> combined

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
everything behind it so that combined

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.120 
everything behind it so that combined
with<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:25.049> lower<00:01:25.229> chassis<00:01:25.500> at<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.740> front<00:01:25.979> is

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
with the lower chassis at the front is

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.640 
with the lower chassis at the front is
the<00:01:26.220> first<00:01:26.400> change<00:01:26.670> of<00:01:26.850> a<00:01:26.909> premier<00:01:27.240> season<00:01:27.659> so

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
the first change of a premier season so

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.469 
the first change of a premier season so
let's<00:01:28.799> move<00:01:28.920> on<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.280> nose<00:01:29.430> obviously<00:01:30.000> now

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
let's move on to the nose obviously now

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.359 
let's move on to the nose obviously now
you<00:01:30.540> have<00:01:30.900> a<00:01:30.930> certain<00:01:31.200> chassis<00:01:31.619> height<00:01:31.829> which

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
you have a certain chassis height which

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.810 
you have a certain chassis height which
is<00:01:32.400> dictated<00:01:33.240> by<00:01:33.240> regulation<00:01:33.869> 625<00:01:34.680> mill<00:01:34.890> that

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
is dictated by regulation 625 mill that

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.850 
is dictated by regulation 625 mill that
chasm<00:01:36.180> lights<00:01:36.329> coming<00:01:36.570> down<00:01:36.659> by<00:01:37.020> 75<00:01:37.590> milk

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
chasm lights coming down by 75 milk

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.350 
chasm lights coming down by 75 milk
that's<00:01:38.250> going<00:01:38.369> to<00:01:38.460> push<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.729> front<00:01:38.939> nose<00:01:39.090> tip

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
that's going to push the front nose tip

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.910 
that's going to push the front nose tip
down<00:01:39.509> as<00:01:39.659> well<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:40.049> whole<00:01:40.170> idea<00:01:40.380> was<00:01:40.740> to

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
down as well the whole idea was to

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.770 
down as well the whole idea was to
improve<00:01:41.220> launching<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:41.850> safety<00:01:42.420> from<00:01:42.630> the

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
improve launching and safety from the

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.530 
improve launching and safety from the
chassis<00:01:43.369> a<00:01:44.369> lot<00:01:44.790> has<00:01:44.880> been<00:01:44.909> said<00:01:45.060> about<00:01:45.270> the

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
chassis a lot has been said about the

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:46.160 
chassis a lot has been said about the
changes<00:01:45.899> to<00:01:46.020> the

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
changes to the

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.870 
changes to the
exhausts<00:01:46.770> I<00:01:46.920> suppose<00:01:47.250> it's<00:01:47.430> a<00:01:47.490> huge<00:01:47.729> relief

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
exhausts I suppose it's a huge relief

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.120 
exhausts I suppose it's a huge relief
for<00:01:48.150> the<00:01:48.330> teams<00:01:48.570> that<00:01:48.750> calendar<00:01:49.619> is<00:01:49.830> no<00:01:49.950> longer

for the teams that calendar is no longer
a<00:01:50.220> problem<00:01:50.400> well<00:01:50.850> it's<00:01:51.180> going<00:01:51.540> to<00:01:51.630> be<00:01:51.720> gone

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
a problem well it's going to be gone

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.570 
a problem well it's going to be gone
completely<00:01:52.080> because<00:01:52.650> the<00:01:53.070> exhaust<00:01:53.400> exits
