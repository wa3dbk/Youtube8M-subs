00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:03.020
 or 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:18.840
 to make this recipe we will need a 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:23.050
 whole chicken clean a pot of beer 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:25.480

 salt and pepper 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:37.040
 we peel the onion and we break it to 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.040
 slices 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:44.180
 ah 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:48.010
 we wash the potatoes and leaving the skin 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.010
 we split them in half 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:55.680
 Both potatoes and onions 

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:55.680
 we will reserve to later use them 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:03.710

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.710
 inside and outside 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.970
 Y 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.890
 this chicken weighs about a kilo 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.530
 and a half depending on the weight varies 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.960
 baking time the measure that I use 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.090
 is one work for each kilo of chicken per 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.890
 so much we will have it in an hour and 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.890
 average approximately in the oven 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.259
 Y 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.960
 Y 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.690
 we introduce the sprig of thyme if in 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.460
 house you do not have thyme on branch 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:43.540
 you can put thyme leaves other 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.540
 that come by boat 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.549
 Y 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:54.930
 We reserve half a glass of beer 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.460
 the rest of the pot on a tray and you 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.850
 we sit the chicken on top 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.549
 Y 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.040
 we throw the wings back as if 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:08.000
 I was sunbathing and we crossed him 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.000
 the thighs 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.550
 Y 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:18.650

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:21.610
 potatoes the glass of beer that we have 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.860

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.910
 he covers the hole above with some 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.910
 potatoes so steam does not come out 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:40.230
 We preheat the oven to 200 degrees and 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.230
 we have about an hour and a half 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.830
