steering<00:00:15.350> wheel<00:00:15.500> and<00:00:17.740> steering<00:00:18.740> wheel<00:00:18.920> is

00:00:19.089 --> 00:00:19.099 
steering wheel and steering wheel is

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:22.450 
steering wheel and steering wheel is
pulled<00:00:19.369> onto<00:00:19.550> a<00:00:19.699> taper<00:00:20.240> so<00:00:21.170> and<00:00:21.529> to<00:00:22.130> get<00:00:22.279> yours

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:22.460 
pulled onto a taper so and to get yours

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.900 
pulled onto a taper so and to get yours
to<00:00:22.910> get<00:00:23.029> it<00:00:23.119> off<00:00:23.410> you<00:00:24.410> can<00:00:24.589> you<00:00:25.400> can<00:00:25.580> hit<00:00:25.730> the

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:25.910 
to get it off you can you can hit the

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:28.900 
to get it off you can you can hit the
center<00:00:26.300> of<00:00:26.390> the<00:00:26.539> shaft<00:00:27.080> with<00:00:28.039> a<00:00:28.070> punch<00:00:28.669> and<00:00:28.880> a

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:28.910 
center of the shaft with a punch and a

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.230 
center of the shaft with a punch and a
hammer<00:00:28.939> but<00:00:29.599> wind<00:00:29.990> the<00:00:30.199> nut<00:00:30.789> and<00:00:31.789> so<00:00:31.999> that<00:00:32.150> the

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:32.240 
hammer but wind the nut and so that the

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:36.250 
hammer but wind the nut and so that the
thread<00:00:32.710> the<00:00:33.710> shaft<00:00:34.010> is<00:00:34.220> just<00:00:34.610> inside<00:00:35.210> the<00:00:35.449> nut

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.260 
thread the shaft is just inside the nut

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.139 
thread the shaft is just inside the nut
so<00:00:36.860> it<00:00:36.980> doesn't<00:00:37.250> muffin<00:00:37.699> when<00:00:38.539> you<00:00:38.629> can<00:00:38.809> see

00:00:40.139 --> 00:00:40.149 
so it doesn't muffin when you can see

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:45.490 
so it doesn't muffin when you can see
done<00:00:41.149> here's<00:00:41.600> one<00:00:41.750> I<00:00:41.780> prepared<00:00:41.870> earlier<00:00:44.500> you

up<00:01:05.470> around<00:01:06.470> the<00:01:06.590> top<00:01:06.770> of<00:01:06.830> the<00:01:06.890> shaft<00:01:07.130> it's<00:01:08.090> got

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
up around the top of the shaft it's got

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:09.700 
up around the top of the shaft it's got
a<00:01:08.240> little<00:01:08.360> locating<00:01:08.990> down<00:01:09.230> there

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
a little locating down there

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:11.980 
a little locating down there
it's<00:01:10.580> slides<00:01:10.910> into<00:01:11.090> a<00:01:11.210> groove<00:01:11.450> in<00:01:11.600> the<00:01:11.660> top<00:01:11.840> of

right next job I lean it forward but you
can<00:02:06.610> see<00:02:06.759> this<00:02:06.909> shape<00:02:07.420> in<00:02:08.410> the<00:02:08.500> bulkhead

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
can see this shape in the bulkhead

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.449 
can see this shape in the bulkhead
that's<00:02:10.030> for<00:02:10.239> this<00:02:10.330> mill<00:02:10.599> strap<00:02:11.069> let's<00:02:12.069> weld<00:02:12.310> it

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
that's for this mill strap let's weld it

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:14.250 
that's for this mill strap let's weld it
onto<00:02:12.580> the<00:02:12.760> shaft<00:02:12.970> to<00:02:13.180> go<00:02:13.330> through<00:02:13.599> it<00:02:14.050> goes

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
onto the shaft to go through it goes

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.050 
onto the shaft to go through it goes
through<00:02:14.530> that<00:02:14.680> way<00:02:14.860> if<00:02:15.640> I<00:02:15.700> lean<00:02:15.910> it<00:02:16.030> forward

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
through that way if I lean it forward
