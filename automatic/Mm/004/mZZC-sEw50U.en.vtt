00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:15.600
 last Friday took place in the 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.279
 natural medical center and a 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.470
 lecture by doctor miguel martin 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.870
 almond trees who talked about the properties 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.630
 of racing a mushroom with multiple 

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:27.090
 properties for the human organism 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.609
 racing not only acts on the 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.189
 defenses but it has effects on the 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.440
 cardio circulatory system lowers the 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.680
 Cholesterol regulates blood pressure 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.989
 provides the essential nutrients for the 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.120
 cellular metabolism and it has effects 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.550
 toning and relaxing on the 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.470
 nervous system and it is a fungus that has 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.329
 worked in the eastern countries on 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.649
 all japanese japan for more than three 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.930
 thousand years and record that you are 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.820
 using and before they were used then 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.070
 because it is exclusive is because it is a 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.260
 fungus that is very difficult to germinate 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.909
 very environmental conditions 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.040
 concrete in a very trunk type 

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:04.350
 concrete then it will be very difficult and 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.670
 the well-off people had 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.850
 many cares that were looking for this 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.960
 because because it was associated with longevity 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.820
 then these eastern countries like 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.830
 He has a lot of tradition with working with 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.200
 the use of racing there are many studies 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.030
 scientists who are talking in the 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.060
 traditional effects that has always been 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.920
 thought that he had then we already know 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:25.350
 thanks these scientific studies the 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.790
 chemical composition of racing and that 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.300
 composition 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.490
 is giving us an 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.910
 justifying an action in our 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.190
 organism 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:37.410
 for example, fundamental for 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.210
 defenses is riis and is a stimulant of the 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:41.220
 immune system of the lymphocytes t 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.750
 then it goes very well for children 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.540
 when they are received very frequently 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:49.250
 after the conference there was a difference 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.250
 tasting this product 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.650
 I am Miguel Almendros almendros doctor 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:55.660
 natural already work in medical center 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:57.640
 natural since we do natural medicine 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:00.250
 homeopathy acupuncture physiotherapy 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:03.160
 rehabilitation and therefore by profession 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.960
 as for passion because I already say very overturned 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.420
 in preventive medicine and medicine 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.130
 preventive by natural methods this 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.540
 late we have a meeting of friends 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.650
 I always like to say that it is a 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:13.030
 Friends meeting because in the end 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.280
 we ended up being all the friends and 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:19.270
 chatting and I was going to talk about the face and 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.950
 the race is a mushroom is a fungus and is a 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.020
 fungus that has been worked in the countries 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.400
 orientals especially japanese japan from 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.410
 more than three thousand years ago and perseverance 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.150
 that is being used and previously 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.239
 used because it is exclusive is 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.050
 because it is a fungus that is very difficult 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:34.180
 germination under conditions 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:36.489
 very specific environmental issues in a 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.680
 very specific trunk type then it was 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:40.090
 very difficult and the people 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.860
 well-off they were very careful 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.260
 they were looking for this because they were 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.550
 associated with longevity then these 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.470
 Eastern countries as it has a lot 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:49.510
 tradition with working with the use of 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.790
 racing there are many scientific studies 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.350
 who are talking about the effects 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.710
 traditional that has always been thought 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:58.080
 I had then we already know 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:00.540
 thanks to scientific studies the 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:04.250
 chemical composition of racing and that 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:07.320
 composition is bringing us because we 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.100
 is justifying us an action in 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.350
 Our organism 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.690
 for example, fundamental for 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:14.400
 DEFENSES laughter is a stimulant 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.380
 immune system of the lymphocytes t 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.940
 then it goes very well for children 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:20.400
 when they are received very frequently 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.260
 in the form of gray extract and also 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.300
 you have cardiovascular effects is 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.690
 cardiotonic reduce tension 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:30.570
 low blood cholesterol slightly 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:33.180
 is anticoagulant has a little bit of 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:36.090
 effect of aspirin then that in 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:38.610
 set has a prevention effect 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:41.460
 of stroke has a 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:43.320
 Heart protection effect other 

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:45.150
 great defect of the racing that we're going to see 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.430
 is that it is depurative is a plant 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.620
 eminently depurative why because 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:52.170
 is rich in antioxidants has a 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.540
 very high antioxidant potential and then 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:57.330
 in its composition has germanium that the 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.940
 Germanium is one of the kings of the 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.580
 antioxidant minerals 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:03.050
 stimulates liver functions 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:05.150
 regenerate the liver with which this 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:06.770
 complements the entire depurative function and 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:09.800
 another very important element in the 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:12.290
 racing is the tones system 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:13.580
 nervous is an adaptogen that is to say help 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:15.500
 the nervous system adapts to the 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:17.269
 stress situation and stimulates it when 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:20.030
 is hypotonic in situations of 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:23.570
 anxiety in situations of nervousness 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:25.250
 normalizes it tends to normalize then 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:28.100
 has guanine has adenosine that are 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:30.200
 chemical principles that act in this 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:32.180
 level also for children other than 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:34.040
 therapeutic effect it has on the 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:36.530
 defenses is a very rich source of 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:38.540
 nutrients is has virtually all 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:41.150
 the b vitamins is fundamentally the 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:44.420
 vitamin to vitamin b9 acid 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:47.060
 pantothenic that has iron has has 

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:48.170
 copper also has calcium then 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.820
 It is also an element to have in 

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:52.930
 account when making a contribution 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.930
 inductive infantile
