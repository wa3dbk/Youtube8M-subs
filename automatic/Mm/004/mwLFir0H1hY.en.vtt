00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:42.620 
this book that book is I think that is

this book that book is I think that is
as<00:01:43.620> you<00:01:43.830> can<00:01:43.860> see<00:01:45.530> disappear<00:01:47.030> very<00:01:48.030> slowly

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
as you can see disappear very slowly

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.890 
as you can see disappear very slowly
because<00:01:49.770> there's<00:01:50.520> not<00:01:50.730> there's<00:01:51.210> no<00:01:51.330> would<00:01:51.600> be

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:51.900 
because there's not there's no would be

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:52.460 
because there's not there's no would be
certain

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
certain

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.420 
certain
so<00:01:52.950> we<00:01:53.160> spawning<00:01:53.490> some<00:01:53.820> wood<00:01:54.030> here<00:01:54.740> wood<00:01:55.740> will

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
so we spawning some wood here wood will

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.050 
so we spawning some wood here wood will
try<00:01:56.700> with<00:01:56.850> normally<00:01:57.240> would<00:01:57.420> and<00:01:57.660> and<00:01:59.060> refined

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
try with normally would and and refined

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:06.680 
try with normally would and and refined
wood<00:02:02.660> so<00:02:03.860> we'll<00:02:04.860> start<00:02:05.610> off<00:02:05.820> with<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:06.330> normal

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:06.690 
wood so we'll start off with the normal

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:22.370 
wood so we'll start off with the normal
wood<00:02:14.960> let's<00:02:15.960> go<00:02:16.170> back<00:02:16.410> and<00:02:16.590> get<00:02:16.770> more<00:02:21.350> okay

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
wood let's go back and get more okay

there's actually something else I heard
that<00:03:48.550> if<00:03:49.510> you<00:03:49.750> shear<00:03:50.940> spiderwebs<00:03:51.940> and<00:03:54.120> you<00:03:55.120> get

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:55.420 
that if you shear spiderwebs and you get

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.200 
that if you shear spiderwebs and you get
back<00:03:55.630> string<00:03:56.050> so<00:03:56.550> Latroy<00:03:57.550> that<00:03:57.730> you<00:03:57.910> can

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:58.210 
back string so Latroy that you can

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:59.820 
back string so Latroy that you can
actually<00:03:58.360> get<00:03:58.570> back<00:03:58.840> string<00:03:59.140> we'll<00:03:59.590> try<00:03:59.770> it

00:03:59.820 --> 00:03:59.830 
actually get back string we'll try it

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:20.190 
actually get back string we'll try it
without<00:03:59.920> it<00:04:00.370> just<00:04:00.640> to<00:04:01.000> see<00:04:01.920> how<00:04:02.920> it's<00:04:03.130> done<00:04:19.140> yes

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:20.200 
without it just to see how it's done yes

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:24.900 
without it just to see how it's done yes
okay<00:04:20.860> so<00:04:21.100> no<00:04:21.820> string<00:04:23.250> string<00:04:24.250> from<00:04:24.550> the<00:04:24.610> shears

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:24.910 
okay so no string string from the shears

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:27.090 
okay so no string string from the shears
so<00:04:25.360> it<00:04:25.420> does<00:04:25.570> actually<00:04:25.720> work<00:04:25.870> and<00:04:26.410> it's

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.100 
so it does actually work and it's

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.370 
so it does actually work and it's
getting<00:04:27.340> there<00:04:27.520> and<00:04:27.930> there's<00:04:28.930> the<00:04:29.110> naked

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:29.380 
getting there and there's the naked

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:32.540 
getting there and there's the naked
chief<00:04:29.590> I<00:04:29.830> wonder<00:04:30.400> do<00:04:30.610> they<00:04:30.790> grow<00:04:31.120> back<00:04:31.330> to<00:04:31.510> wool
