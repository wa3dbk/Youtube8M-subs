00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.029
 It doesn't talk about it but it is also a bag pair example if you have occupation 

00:00:04.029 --> 00:00:06.610
 wants to make both Dutch people liveable 

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:12.070
 Dutchmen are occupied by the Germans and indeed the World War II 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:16.090
 it is not comparable to what is happening now in bus line axes like you 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:19.070
 that i mean is if you make me punch out and 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.529
 I think they have it in themselves, we can partly take a pair 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:27.359
 if you don't want to be pushed in the corner like most people 

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:31.519
 that your points in the corner the hidden pressure in the corner of the Kurds of it 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:35.110
 are all anti-Semites and live then you do not have to go over the pole or 

00:00:35.109 --> 00:00:39.079
 start just as well as the Jews must keep their mouth shut as well 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:40.650
 is about this conflict 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:42.140
 only Jews have what that f 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:43.899
 a little more right to speak 

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:47.739
 but they were the victims of the second, but then you can 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:49.280
 it doesn't use that argument 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.340
 the only thing i want to say is i would say dont talk about it 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:54.660
 I would have searched 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.090
 I already make a lot of strength that I don't but I prefer not to talk about that way 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:00.200
 so we are now talking about that is not 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.500
 that's not gonna help 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.910
 ok later than the situation proposal as it is kind of at the same time with which 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:08.950
 disorder event is therefore happy to say 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.760
 so the last as is now is the following 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.080
 namely from 9 48 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.329
 have you been an artist yourself? 

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:19.280
 Palestinian and the population in that area 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.680
 yet there is a forty-eight if you stand by the hangover 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.210
 then you see that now in 2009 and you actually see that there is nothing else 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:29.289
 dong a number 

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:33.289
 Reserves us together to go exactly the areas said ps actually nothing 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:37.179
 unlike a reserve it does not exist a Palestinian state from day to day 

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:41.640
 Day there are areas that are closed off that are dependent on occupation 

00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:45.509
 And this is also accompanied by thought it was very important that you do not 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.899
 occupation can be sustained with violence the violence is not per 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.739
 definition alone but did not win something against my will of course 

00:01:51.739 --> 00:01:55.369
 also no, but i thought i would let people hear about this 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:58.889
 occupation has been giving all this time it is also a nonsense argument to troops 

00:01:58.889 --> 00:01:59.560
 are not 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.040
 because of that touches too great power is just looking back on for that 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.790
 he was out of order 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:06.090
 I agree with you 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.979
 only that set will skip the tunnel and I have a lot of minutes 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:10.820
 I still understand 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.820
 we really have to tell that story alone 

00:02:16.249 --> 00:02:19.359
 you also say in your ass I park class under par and I mind 

00:02:19.359 --> 00:02:22.710
 complicated to reverse we know each other bit the you can however 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.759
 the nice boy but we also have a contract 

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:28.889
 then you also know columns come into contact with 

00:02:28.889 --> 00:02:30.499
 confused one 

00:02:30.499 --> 00:02:34.269
 and not because you don't know if he's with friends or with people like me 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:36.629
 that this is a task 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:39.849
 but also more than but especially what a business atmosphere so still can for it 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:41.350
 audience and viewers 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.369
 to state where it also what 

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:45.670
 in those in the columns 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.110
 explicitly refer to the second world war 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.450
 I also participate but also do not take the second by j you write great 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.079
 dotan is after 

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:55.399
 and drops 

00:02:55.399 --> 00:02:58.769
 the state cannot go ahead with that and stand where they want the 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:02.279
 return match are dead because I have you so maybe it's my that I'm coming 

00:03:02.279 --> 00:03:03.590
 don't understand well 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.189
 but if you appear to be dead in the bowl then you mean 

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:07.839
 once the people there 

00:03:07.839 --> 00:03:11.689
 in that country or you just think there is a large area how do they all come together 

00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:13.500
 and that is also the transfer talk 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:14.749
 in a city successor 

00:03:14.749 --> 00:03:15.809
 so the best 

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:18.629
 another example i'm not going to have that example we talked to every day 

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:19.959
 for example americans 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:23.069
 the americans actually had the Indians barred a little on the bar 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:27.440
 we have at least had the respect for fellow human beings and as equal citizens 

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:28.499
 to include 

00:03:28.499 --> 00:03:32.659
 And that is respect is the percentage recorded if you go for it 

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:37.049
 l'orÃ©al important I have I launched to china september they are reported 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:40.379
 almost every country is where the entire country has a dreaded yes 

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:43.900
 but at least they can vote will participate in processes 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.450
 they can themselves derive from another american album but now what happens 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.400
 and posthuma 6 definitely not the case we could talk about 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.510
 and two-state solution and is evenly confronted with it 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.639
 with six million refugees outpost and its limits 

00:04:00.179 --> 00:04:03.299
 if we are more realistic and we really want one and a message from 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:06.180
 We must talk about the solution 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.079
 as an important and critical 

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:11.560
 point I have people don't talk about the solution because they assume it 

00:04:11.559 --> 00:04:15.290
 year is only violence there you find it crazy that all is violence like you 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:18.720
 offers people no perspective if you do not offer people hope that does justice 

00:04:18.719 --> 00:04:23.080
 and 10 things they are confronted with 8 as I am with him 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.699
 I say it again I agree with you for a very large part I find dissolving 

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:28.540
 from a country 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:32.389
 not a good solution but that they are not there in violence solution 

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:36.050
 because you are just going to let it go together and not make it right away 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:38.110
 man 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.800
 I imagine a walk with a person in a demonstration with jam 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.099
 after a short and right thought yes 

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:47.099
 and not especially with you of pontifical morocco 

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:52.129
 Then this is the risk that they are behind but Hamas Hamas Jews on the gas on it 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:56.280
 that is not something that is commissioned by muslims that is that by it 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:00.000
 The Rotterdam team the supporters came up with and that is a profit response to anp in 

00:04:59.999 --> 00:05:03.059
 chili supporters has nothing to do with muslims march take muslims 

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:07.870
 at the demonstration munich no people are talking about being assimilated 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.870
 his going very well is taking a position is not yet out of the football world 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:16.130
 Did you join me then I went there he says the houses that feedback this 

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:17.060
 has nothing to do with it 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:18.020
 this of course 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:19.439
 I absolutely don't think so 

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:22.759
 I am a democrat and walking maps solutions postiena 

00:05:23.749 --> 00:05:27.759
 though it was not even a ridiculous comment that too 

00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:29.670
 the snot noses rotterdam but that makes 

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:32.740
 does not make it any less nice and vulnerable for a number of people 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:35.740
 the one in front is talking tos 

00:05:36.569 --> 00:05:40.409
 I want I would like it was good for the next we should have been nice there 

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:44.229
 not be murdered at that time, we should not like this either 

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:48.080
 main use of says of the discussion is thereby on the 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:51.529
 decision does not always go with that but it went to me in November I pick it up 

00:05:51.529 --> 00:05:52.740
 goes to me personally 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:56.069
 after peak I think it's complicated I have to help 

00:05:56.819 --> 00:05:59.819
 pom but then don't go but that is not for me 

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:04.460
 we hope we get a few questions from kate 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:07.460
 too happy to hook up place for that also means this 

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:18.750
 my second home country that is possible in the netherlands we will soon be in the picture as 

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:23.539
 that in a flat that is that you are single again yes this window lee how the 

00:06:23.539 --> 00:06:27.789
 club how strong the corput versus owning it must be one and state 

00:06:27.789 --> 00:06:28.939
 become a solution 

00:06:28.939 --> 00:06:31.339
 people still have to live together 

00:06:31.339 --> 00:06:34.729
 no, I don't believe it at all, I think that's the camp 

00:06:34.729 --> 00:06:37.830
 daphne and certainly after all the misery that will make each other come true 

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:42.639
 I think the nuisance caused by the Jewish state is simply necessary 

00:06:42.639 --> 00:06:44.659
 and all of this time 

00:06:44.659 --> 00:06:47.050
 I regret the dispute is that it 

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:49.479
 that already with many countries are this way 

00:06:49.479 --> 00:06:51.790
 the effect is greater 

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:56.150
 with nac columbia degree of long this point it is too late in that regard 

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:59.820
 This would be that just not all power has the ad all there are all sorts 

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:03.330
 rotgeintje removed that shrinkage every country has removed 

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:07.080
 For us, a little water that already has a teaser is necessary that it is there 

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:08.440
 is that must be 

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:11.440
 only the Palestinians must also have helped Holland work there 

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:12.380
 completely for that 

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:13.240
 and 

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:17.099
 what is happening now see the box for that type of settlement in the second 

00:07:17.099 --> 00:07:20.960
 criminal circuit it is now there is great now that terrible things are going to do 

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:22.509
 against abbas and next week 

00:07:22.509 --> 00:07:23.289
 the three men 

00:07:23.289 --> 00:07:26.479
 ham deductible insures back and I think it's all rig and I like it 

00:07:26.479 --> 00:07:28.430
 all sadness 

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:33.240
 unfortunately just a little later but we ourselves still go many other Frenchman 

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:34.550
 good 

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:35.629
 the farmer say hello
