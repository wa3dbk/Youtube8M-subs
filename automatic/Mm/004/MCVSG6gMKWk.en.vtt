00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.280 
run stop there are other runs out there
this<00:01:11.970> one's<00:01:12.180> even<00:01:12.479> though<00:01:12.659> Venus<00:01:12.810> runs<00:01:13.110> better

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
this one's even though Venus runs better

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.840 
this one's even though Venus runs better
than<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.619> Mars<00:01:13.799> run<00:01:14.100> for<00:01:14.580> those<00:01:14.700> that<00:01:14.790> are

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
than the Mars run for those that are

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.190 
than the Mars run for those that are
high<00:01:15.000> enough<00:01:15.150> to<00:01:15.390> actually<00:01:15.509> kill<00:01:15.810> that<00:01:15.960> at<00:01:16.110> a

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
high enough to actually kill that at a

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.800 
high enough to actually kill that at a
quick<00:01:16.409> fashion<00:01:16.680> so<00:01:17.490> what<00:01:18.090> is<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.360> best<00:01:18.540> way<00:01:18.659> to
