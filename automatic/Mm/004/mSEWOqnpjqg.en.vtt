00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
and what really is quite genius I mean

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.630 
and what really is quite genius I mean
actually<00:02:50.170> the<00:02:50.290> genius<00:02:50.709> design<00:02:51.069> in<00:02:51.250> Canada

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
actually the genius design in Canada

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.620 
actually the genius design in Canada
these<00:02:51.760> guys<00:02:51.970> really<00:02:52.209> went<00:02:52.540> into<00:02:52.660> it<00:02:52.900> was<00:02:53.140> a

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
these guys really went into it was a

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.570 
these guys really went into it was a
reversible<00:02:55.630> handlebar<00:02:56.319> so<00:02:57.220> for<00:02:57.489> your

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
reversible handlebar so for your

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.250 
reversible handlebar so for your
competitive<00:02:58.090> road<00:02:58.239> cyclists<00:02:58.750> or<00:02:58.900> very

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
competitive road cyclists or very

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.080 
competitive road cyclists or very
flexible<00:02:59.769> triathlete<00:03:00.310> you'll<00:03:00.489> be<00:03:00.610> riding<00:03:00.970> at

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
flexible triathlete you'll be riding at

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.539 
flexible triathlete you'll be riding at
the<00:03:01.180> bottom<00:03:01.510> facing<00:03:01.840> downwards<00:03:02.440> if<00:03:03.310> you<00:03:03.459> were

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:03.549 
the bottom facing downwards if you were

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:05.160 
the bottom facing downwards if you were
being<00:03:03.730> longer<00:03:03.940> distances<00:03:04.540> and<00:03:04.690> maybe<00:03:04.870> won<00:03:05.140> a

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
being longer distances and maybe won a

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.050 
being longer distances and maybe won a
different<00:03:05.560> position<00:03:05.680> you<00:03:06.549> could<00:03:06.700> face<00:03:06.880> the

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
different position you could face the

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.770 
different position you could face the
interval<00:03:07.450> up<00:03:07.690> the<00:03:08.590> differential<00:03:09.190> is<00:03:09.340> 10

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
interval up the differential is 10

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.199 
interval up the differential is 10
centimeters<00:03:10.780> so<00:03:11.680> that<00:03:11.860> gives<00:03:12.070> you<00:03:12.220> more<00:03:13.000> than

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
centimeters so that gives you more than

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:15.660 
centimeters so that gives you more than
enough<00:03:13.480> to<00:03:13.870> get<00:03:14.019> exactly<00:03:14.440> 2<00:03:14.620> we<00:03:14.739> want<00:03:15.280> to<00:03:15.340> go<00:03:15.459> so

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
enough to get exactly 2 we want to go so

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.280 
enough to get exactly 2 we want to go so
you<00:03:15.730> can<00:03:15.970> go<00:03:16.090> four<00:03:16.390> and<00:03:16.540> a<00:03:16.630> half<00:03:16.660> to<00:03:16.900> six<00:03:17.140> or

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
you can go four and a half to six or

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.360 
you can go four and a half to six or
nine<00:03:17.440> and<00:03:17.950> you<00:03:18.130> can<00:03:18.280> go<00:03:18.430> up<00:03:18.820> and<00:03:19.000> down<00:03:19.120> by<00:03:19.450> 10

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
nine and you can go up and down by 10

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.940 
nine and you can go up and down by 10
the<00:03:21.370> module<00:03:21.700> comes<00:03:21.940> with<00:03:22.299> two<00:03:22.660> sets<00:03:23.049> of<00:03:23.290> arrow

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
the module comes with two sets of arrow

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.280 
the module comes with two sets of arrow
extensions<00:03:24.760> that<00:03:25.420> show<00:03:25.660> a<00:03:25.690> different<00:03:26.079> thing

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
extensions that show a different thing

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:33.900 
extensions that show a different thing
and<00:03:26.560> the<00:03:27.130> way<00:03:27.250> they<00:03:27.430> integrate<00:03:27.850> into<00:03:32.910> the

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
and the way they integrate into the

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.840 
and the way they integrate into the
leavers<00:03:34.480> allows<00:03:35.109> you<00:03:35.410> to<00:03:35.680> adjust<00:03:35.859> the<00:03:36.220> toe<00:03:36.609> to

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
leavers allows you to adjust the toe to

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.690 
leavers allows you to adjust the toe to
the<00:03:36.910> bar<00:03:37.150> to<00:03:37.810> get<00:03:37.900> a<00:03:37.959> perfect<00:03:38.470> in<00:03:38.859> position<00:03:39.489> and

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
the bar to get a perfect in position and

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.640 
the bar to get a perfect in position and
then<00:03:40.450> by<00:03:40.600> using<00:03:40.630> the<00:03:41.109> two<00:03:41.290> different

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
then by using the two different

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.979 
then by using the two different
varieties<00:03:42.090> you<00:03:43.090> can<00:03:43.120> add<00:03:43.390> a<00:03:43.420> different<00:03:43.750> hand

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989 
varieties you can add a different hand

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:48.270 
varieties you can add a different hand
high<00:03:44.260> position<00:03:46.019> so<00:03:47.019> fully<00:03:47.560> integrated<00:03:48.160> and

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
high position so fully integrated and

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.910

completely adjustable not only does the

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.590 
completely adjustable not only does the
all<00:03:51.190> gone<00:03:51.430> and<00:03:51.670> now<00:03:51.880> the<00:03:51.940> rider<00:03:52.299> to<00:03:52.480> get

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:52.600 
all gone and now the rider to get

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.840 
all gone and now the rider to get
exactly<00:03:52.989> where<00:03:53.290> he<00:03:53.440> needs<00:03:53.620> to<00:03:53.799> be<00:03:54.010> but<00:03:54.549> it<00:03:54.670> also

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:54.850 
exactly where he needs to be but it also

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:56.309 
exactly where he needs to be but it also
hides<00:03:55.329> all<00:03:55.750> of<00:03:55.780> the

hides all of the

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:58.770 
hides all of the
from<00:03:56.680> the<00:03:56.799> wind<00:03:57.010> so<00:03:57.579> once<00:03:57.760> again<00:03:57.909> the<00:03:58.239> brake

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780 
from the wind so once again the brake

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.550 
from the wind so once again the brake
caliper<00:03:59.700> is<00:04:00.700> integrated<00:04:01.389> with<00:04:01.629> the<00:04:01.870> frameset

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
caliper is integrated with the frameset

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.209 
caliper is integrated with the frameset
and<00:04:03.359> it's<00:04:04.359> hidden<00:04:04.719> from<00:04:04.870> the<00:04:05.170> wind<00:04:05.379> it's

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:06.219 
and it's hidden from the wind it's

00:04:06.219 --> 00:04:08.099 
and it's hidden from the wind it's
completely<00:04:06.849> part<00:04:07.120> of<00:04:07.209> the<00:04:07.269> design<00:04:07.540> and<00:04:07.870> that

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:08.109 
completely part of the design and that

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:10.890 
completely part of the design and that
is<00:04:08.230> the<00:04:08.620> front<00:04:09.310> brake<00:04:09.760> is<00:04:09.999> behind<00:04:10.420> the<00:04:10.629> fault

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
is the front brake is behind the fault

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.750 
is the front brake is behind the fault
and<00:04:11.109> the<00:04:11.829> rear<00:04:12.670> brake<00:04:13.120> is<00:04:13.769> under<00:04:14.769> that<00:04:15.310> change

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760 
and the rear brake is under that change

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:21.089 
and the rear brake is under that change
this<00:04:18.930> getting<00:04:19.930> into<00:04:20.109> the<00:04:20.199> seat<00:04:20.500> post<00:04:20.769> in<00:04:20.979> this

00:04:21.089 --> 00:04:21.099 
this getting into the seat post in this

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:22.950 
this getting into the seat post in this
is<00:04:21.250> very<00:04:21.430> impressive<00:04:21.849> too<00:04:22.090> and<00:04:22.630> once<00:04:22.810> again

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
is very impressive too and once again

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.680 
is very impressive too and once again
ideal<00:04:23.620> for<00:04:23.979> not<00:04:24.160> only<00:04:24.520> beat<00:04:24.729> Rafi<00:04:25.270> but<00:04:25.449> also

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
ideal for not only beat Rafi but also

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:28.230 
ideal for not only beat Rafi but also
the<00:04:25.960> competitive<00:04:26.470> road<00:04:26.650> cyclists<00:04:27.160> you've<00:04:27.910> got
