have<00:01:16.500> a<00:01:17.240> we<00:01:18.240> have<00:01:18.360> electronics<00:01:19.020> this<00:01:19.200> time<00:01:19.409> we

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
have a we have electronics this time we

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:26.830 
have a we have electronics this time we
have<00:01:20.009> a<00:01:20.780> wire<00:01:22.189> here<00:01:23.189> on<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:24.439> right<00:01:25.439> side<00:01:25.710> and

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
have a wire here on the right side and

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.190 
have a wire here on the right side and
we<00:01:27.840> have<00:01:28.020> a<00:01:28.049> test<00:01:28.560> board<00:01:29.240> now<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.329> test<00:01:30.810> board

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
we have a test board now the test board

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.940 
we have a test board now the test board
I'm<00:01:31.470> pretty<00:01:31.890> sure<00:01:32.220> we're<00:01:32.939> going<00:01:33.060> to<00:01:33.119> be<00:01:33.210> using

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
I'm pretty sure we're going to be using

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.640 
I'm pretty sure we're going to be using
in<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.820> future<00:01:36.180> for<00:01:36.210> other<00:01:36.689> parts<00:01:37.079> of<00:01:37.200> Robbie

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
in the future for other parts of Robbie

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:46.310 
in the future for other parts of Robbie
and<00:01:40.100> we<00:01:41.100> have<00:01:41.400> a<00:01:43.369> chest<00:01:44.450> left<00:01:45.450> right<00:01:45.930> right

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
and we have a chest left right right

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.039 
and we have a chest left right right
side<00:01:46.500> of<00:01:46.619> his<00:01:46.740> chest<00:01:46.850> with<00:01:47.850> his<00:01:47.880> right<00:01:48.479> arm<00:01:48.750> a

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
side of his chest with his right arm a

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.340 
side of his chest with his right arm a
few<00:01:49.680> screws<00:01:50.040> and<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:51.060> actual<00:01:51.540> I<00:01:52.110> guess<00:01:52.259> you

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
few screws and the actual I guess you

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.499 
few screws and the actual I guess you
could<00:01:52.409> say<00:01:52.619> a<00:01:52.649> handle<00:01:53.189> to<00:01:53.220> pick<00:01:53.909> Robbie<00:01:54.240> up

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
could say a handle to pick Robbie up

00:01:54.509 --> 00:02:01.310 
could say a handle to pick Robbie up
place<00:01:55.320> them<00:01:55.500> down<00:01:55.680> and<00:01:59.299> from<00:02:00.299> here<00:02:00.509> on<00:02:00.570> I'm

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
place them down and from here on I'm

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.980 
place them down and from here on I'm
gonna<00:02:02.009> be<00:02:02.189> I<00:02:02.430> guess<00:02:03.210> going<00:02:03.509> into<00:02:03.869> the

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
gonna be I guess going into the

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.910 
gonna be I guess going into the
instructions<00:02:04.710> a<00:02:05.610> little<00:02:06.149> bit<00:02:06.270> more<00:02:06.920> alright

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
instructions a little bit more alright

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.260 
instructions a little bit more alright
so<00:02:08.340> here<00:02:08.819> in<00:02:08.940> issue<00:02:09.090> 3<00:02:09.450> is<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:10.200> parts<00:02:11.009> list<00:02:11.270> one

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
so here in issue 3 is the parts list one

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.190 
so here in issue 3 is the parts list one
is<00:02:12.599> the

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
is the

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.900 
is the
handle<00:02:13.410> which<00:02:13.560> you<00:02:13.680> can<00:02:13.800> pick<00:02:14.010> rabia<00:02:14.430> by<00:02:14.700> that

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
handle which you can pick rabia by that

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.080 
handle which you can pick rabia by that
sits<00:02:15.180> under<00:02:15.480> his<00:02:15.660> neck<00:02:16.020> too<00:02:16.920> is<00:02:17.220> his<00:02:17.489> right<00:02:17.790> arm

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
sits under his neck too is his right arm

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.900 
sits under his neck too is his right arm
3<00:02:18.930> is<00:02:19.140> his<00:02:19.379> right<00:02:19.680> chest<00:02:20.099> keep<00:02:20.430> in<00:02:20.580> mind<00:02:20.790> that

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
3 is his right chest keep in mind that

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.290 
3 is his right chest keep in mind that
two<00:02:21.330> and<00:02:21.569> three<00:02:22.140> are<00:02:22.379> not<00:02:22.470> the<00:02:23.340> final<00:02:23.879> product

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
two and three are not the final product

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.699 
two and three are not the final product
versions<00:02:24.930> I<00:02:25.190> guess<00:02:26.190> you<00:02:26.280> could<00:02:26.340> say<00:02:26.610> that<00:02:27.709> what

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
versions I guess you could say that what

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:31.880 
versions I guess you could say that what
you<00:02:28.830> will<00:02:28.980> be<00:02:29.129> building<00:02:29.550> is<00:02:29.700> a<00:02:29.730> headstand<00:02:30.890> to

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
you will be building is a headstand to

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.259 
you will be building is a headstand to
test<00:02:32.370> the<00:02:32.750> joint<00:02:33.750> in<00:02:33.989> Robbie's<00:02:34.500> neck<00:02:34.940> for<00:02:35.940> is

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
test the joint in Robbie's neck for is

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:39.740 
test the joint in Robbie's neck for is
similar<00:02:37.050> to<00:02:37.290> 3m<00:02:37.860> tape<00:02:38.510> basically<00:02:39.510> it's<00:02:39.630> just

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
similar to 3m tape basically it's just

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.949 
similar to 3m tape basically it's just
cushion<00:02:40.440> on<00:02:40.560> one<00:02:40.739> side<00:02:40.980> sticky<00:02:41.430> on<00:02:41.519> the<00:02:41.640> other

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
cushion on one side sticky on the other

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:46.309 
cushion on one side sticky on the other
five<00:02:42.959> is<00:02:43.349> the<00:02:43.799> test<00:02:44.310> board<00:02:44.730> which<00:02:45.450> I<00:02:45.840> believe

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
five is the test board which I believe

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:49.820 
five is the test board which I believe
we<00:02:46.470> will<00:02:46.590> be<00:02:46.650> using<00:02:46.920> in<00:02:47.220> the<00:02:47.690> future<00:02:48.690> of<00:02:49.410> parts

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
we will be using in the future of parts

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:55.150 
we will be using in the future of parts
