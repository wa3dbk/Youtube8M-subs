00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:19.929
 Do you imagine the tower bar then 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:24.929
 This Strut Tower Bar Determines the Forest Point of the Next Forest 

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:28.050
 It is one of the easiest body reinforcement parts to 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:31.779
 Why are you fixing the suspension 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:34.120
 Heart to strut tower bar 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.120
 It is said that this strut tower bar will be installed 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.340
 Because the body of the super luxury car is busy 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.600
 While driving the car 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.720
 Input from the hospital surface 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.130
 In other words, the seasoning of the unevenness of the cornering and the road surface 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:57.610
 The suspension is receiving 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:59.200
 The suspension is 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.290
 Because it is fixed to successor 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.270
 Input from the road surface is also used for the body 

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:07.270
 It is that it is distorted where it can not be seen 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.180
 By the way, what will happen to replace the Phase Permanent Act? 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.690
 In fact 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.420
 To affect the movement of the suspension, etc. 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.170
 Mouth burning performance or 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.100
 Traction performance 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.100
 May adversely affect handling 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.600
 In fact 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.710
 An experiment on how much that happens to me 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:31.160
 Let's try 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:32.630
 I'm cornering 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.710
 It is assumed that the narrative is loaded 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:37.650
 Adopted in closed condition- 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.650
 The pony is more important 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:45.200
 Product cut into strut tower bar on 4th of December 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.200
 Lecture 

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:11.919
 Even though this is something else 

00:02:11.919 --> 00:02:14.919
 The pipe has slipped by this much 

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:20.719
 That means during circuit driving and cornering 

00:02:20.719 --> 00:02:23.719
 Vertical vibration is not large 

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:24.459
 further 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:27.459
 I'm going for the fusion of telecommunication broadcasting 

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:32.099
 This strut tower bar is for Molly reinforcement 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:35.099
 It is effective 

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:53.139
 So what's different from actual driving lanes? Struts 

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:55.439
 Try the power on the tower bar 

00:02:55.439 --> 00:02:58.869
 Test content should be equipped with strut tower bar 

00:02:58.869 --> 00:03:00.029
 In the state 

00:03:00.029 --> 00:03:02.299
 I am using a traveling pylon slalom 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:05.249
 I want to go home 

00:03:05.249 --> 00:03:07.469
 Pan appearance of each damper 

00:03:07.469 --> 00:03:10.379
 In other words, I have strokes, but there are many companions 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:13.930
 It's supposed to get rid of it 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.339
 I would like to 

00:03:15.339 --> 00:03:19.879
 If the slot car is also attached, the twist of the body decreases 

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:22.879
 The amount of bump on the damper increases 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:26.549
 Then presented 

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:31.069
 The third battle of the Japan-US Marine Corps of Konnichiha is Masami 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:34.189
 How effective is it with Estrut balls 

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:37.189
 I'm curious so I was huge but now 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:40.989
 Review the deployment in the industry by removing the slot width 

00:03:44.899 --> 00:03:48.069
 I would like to open the width I had in the first round 

00:04:25.309 --> 00:04:28.309
 61 in the state of talking with the slot 

00:04:37.309 --> 00:04:39.509
 The best is doing with the strut tower bar 

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:42.509
 I would like to 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.400
 It was 66 mm in honorable title abbreviated river sumo wrestling 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:24.449
 As distortion was held down with the body so that 

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:26.460
 Damper team force 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.360
 It means that you were 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:31.710
 That's why the input from the road surface has been lost 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:34.919
 As a result, the performance of the damper is fully demonstrated 

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:36.919
 I think 

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:40.979
 Match the game incompetence control as driving feeling 

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:44.300
 I think other mercury lamps will change in various ways 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:47.309
 The same train was right 

00:05:47.309 --> 00:05:48.580
 You 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:52.340
 Even without much, I can not see 

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:55.340
 A surprise example that the amount of power generation of the Fire Department has changed 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:59.030
 Certainly the response of the steering wheel has improved 

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:01.099
 Revealed that 

00:06:01.099 --> 00:06:04.099
 How far have you been effective? 

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:10.070
 Eliminated in the first round 

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:14.520
 I would like to discover one after another with the correct answer of the medium 

00:06:33.379 --> 00:06:35.319
 I want to think about environmental issues 

00:06:35.319 --> 00:06:39.259
 I was in 1998 but there was something I wanted to do 

00:06:39.259 --> 00:06:41.409
 If you are a fan 

00:06:41.409 --> 00:06:42.480
 In particular 

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:44.830
 Yamazaki scored in the last 4 minutes 

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:47.020
 Cleaning a little compared to before 

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:50.229
 Response is very fast 

00:06:50.229 --> 00:06:53.639
 Owner of the share and brake of the Holy Grail 

00:06:53.639 --> 00:06:56.349
 The justice has already increased 

00:06:56.349 --> 00:06:58.550
 Somewhat worse in the distance 

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:00.449
 Came early 

00:07:00.449 --> 00:07:02.729
 smartpowerseti 

00:07:02.729 --> 00:07:05.650
 So by mounting the strut tower bar 

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:08.710
 It may have a big effect on your feet, 

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:11.619
 It's just this 

00:07:11.619 --> 00:07:12.460
 By the way 

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:13.680
 Body reinforcement 

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:15.580
 Besides Strut Tower Bar 

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:17.779
 Because it is effective for the bogey human body 

00:07:17.779 --> 00:07:20.549
 Please try POSCO's dustproof and reinforced parts.
