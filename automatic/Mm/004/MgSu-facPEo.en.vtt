 among them is what a shock again 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.730
 have a combination 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:29.869
 not just many braided ones 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.570
 Bergama five times 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:40.770
 through the jewelry above 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.740
 that fits 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.740
 his rounds are spinning 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.060
 every now and then a loop 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.370
 the crowd through five times 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.370
 Put on a light coat of march 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.030
 before you put the whole story on site right now 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.420
 do something new now 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.420
 No 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.710
 I will think so 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.710
 and push the 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.930
 we'll be together a little bit 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.100
 Yes 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.630
 to draw followers for a long time 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.620
 behind 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.620
 you think Andy Schleck 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.750
 very important 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.370
 It is not too short now 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:54.600
 to cut off 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.990
 is 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.990
 Denver 8 mm FZ 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.440
 that insanely strong the new one 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.550
 Purpose Climate Trier 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.049
 because if you cut it off too short 

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:14.310
 Farkas be sure that ghouls when throwing change so if something gives them something 

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:15.529
 to stay longer 

00:02:15.529 --> 00:02:17.429
 we are just essential 

00:02:17.429 --> 00:02:20.829
 elastic 

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:23.189
 usually 

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:24.969
 it's enough 

00:02:24.969 --> 00:02:29.769
 a route length buyer 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:34.760
 At this station there was a jump when customers 

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:38.549
 the Ministry of Arts 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:41.999
 ten to twelve inches that will be equally removed 

00:02:43.279 --> 00:02:45.919
 very soft com just tear off 

00:02:45.919 --> 00:02:48.919
 Then you brush the material back to the front 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:57.279
 so now you can see beautiful without points is Jepsen where have the same one 

00:02:57.279 --> 00:02:59.739
 You have to start right in front of it 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:02.739
 with the dining room 19 Auer 

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:11.639
 It is very important that you push the material on the needle, not the needles 

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:13.529
 the material 

00:03:13.529 --> 00:03:16.529
 chat can be that one wonders image 

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:21.919
 for what three inches 

00:03:21.919 --> 00:03:25.509
 while giving out toe Matt will be down to the end then everyone is there 

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:28.829
 a little wider by far push SID 

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:36.099
 in Carinthia something is easier to talk about later 

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:39.089
 It is just as important that you return 

00:03:39.089 --> 00:03:40.269
 around 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:43.900
 That changes the game from the beat, the less brokers you have to go through 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:44.429
 the 

00:03:44.429 --> 00:03:45.569
 with the again 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:47.589
 back compulsions 

00:03:47.589 --> 00:03:48.430
 Commercials 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.089
 relatively small suggested 

00:03:51.089 --> 00:03:53.069
 5 always a bit filigree 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:55.859
 Pander the whole impression 

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:57.200
 so it's optimal 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.200
 is the man for 75 centimeters 

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:05.079
 in the end had 70 to 80 centimeters 

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:06.069
 so 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:08.859
 and 80 to 85 centimeters distance 

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:11.859
 April APA 

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:14.099
 we bring now 

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:18.239
 take in the mouth and conquer the credit cards and percent 

00:04:19.629 --> 00:04:22.629
 but it is just so rich Hines rich waters 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:25.539
 that the 

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:28.539
 sure that Witches has absolute priority 

00:04:29.499 --> 00:04:32.050
 and during the day again 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:35.860
 that the beautiful on the Lech before you can mount everything easily are 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:37.749
 but would be 

00:04:37.749 --> 00:04:40.819
 really lucky 

00:04:40.819 --> 00:04:43.819
 now it's easy to unite a little smart 

00:04:44.779 --> 00:04:47.610
 and to be sold 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.610
 last had vertebrae 

00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:54.259
 Dinkla related 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:59.020
 was the one you can later also that is an extension 

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:04.830
 Later, the whole of it comes from AMEC com 8 and then sense if you can 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.830
 not alone not the spanish yet 

00:05:08.529 --> 00:05:12.079
 Weidmann always sees people let-kommandeure zaki-ur-rehman 

00:05:12.079 --> 00:05:17.099
 not only from what put into the kennel then tight and around that have due 

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:21.319
 Underwater photography has found the center this is the problem 

00:05:21.319 --> 00:05:24.199
 it is just about to start saying 

00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:27.779
 especially hot here, the men only think sense if one 

00:05:27.779 --> 00:05:31.090
 It's reassuring when you put a corpse through it 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:36.659
 English weeks had just one more benefit to rowing around like that 

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:38.660
 whole percent can improve 

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:41.340
 if someone fails a Lyon 9 last one
