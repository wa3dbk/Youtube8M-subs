00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.530
 hi nor cj elmer 55 that was very 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.540
 very long 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:47.770
 and suddenly I tell you you center on 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:51.160
 may come back fight then you me 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:54.970
 was rushing to appreciate how 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:57.250
 god have mercy an account so then everything 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:01:00.460
 alone or flora after furniture and 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:03.760
 grannies the wrath of joysticks so 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:09.090
 so we'll put some braquet for good 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:12.430
 you see I'm a stray dog 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.560
 I did not do anything with what we want 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.910
 so with the controller 2 we will be cold 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.630
 we will do at home and we turn 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:21.820
 quality hop we always follow with the 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.860
 drop in donations will go into the 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.140
 shop we're going to do more believe we're going 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.930
 do double cross and your local is on 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:31.960
 served me we have like that I think 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:34.120
 to the star front to disconnect we know in 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.040
 hand and after anyway 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.180
 finished disconnect 16 points 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.760
 with the first car 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.320
 we believe then it would work adults 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:44.130
 invade the room not market so I 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.130
 close friends 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:55.930
 hop hop there 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:55.930
 mister of the communes it is always that 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.950
 and 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:18.120
 that's basically it is necessary to face 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:21.780
 it sure does not work in the meantime 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.780
 an alert threshold 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.150
 it's still 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.659
 always not 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.480
 paul 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:47.530
 so the cutout will be displayed then you 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:49.299
 already have him take the fight where 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.640
 you want to take the party new 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:54.549
 so here are two above so I 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:57.700
 am very proud but did a little 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:59.209
 moment that I have not done always and 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.230
 I also have 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:05.420
 but I like a lot of weapons 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:07.450

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.450

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.049
 There you go 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:31.569

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:31.569

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:38.720

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:40.720
 a lot of weapons or houses 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.720

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:09.870
