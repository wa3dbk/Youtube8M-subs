00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:02.840 

hey<00:00:01.439> guys<00:00:01.620> so<00:00:01.829> we're<00:00:02.010> troubleshooting<00:00:02.639> the<00:00:02.730> D

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:02.850 
hey guys so we're troubleshooting the D

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.180 
hey guys so we're troubleshooting the D
or<00:00:02.909> Z<00:00:03.149> again<00:00:03.449> this<00:00:04.259> is<00:00:04.410> the<00:00:04.500> last<00:00:04.740> thing<00:00:04.950> that<00:00:05.009> I

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.190 
or Z again this is the last thing that I

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.039 
or Z again this is the last thing that I
think<00:00:05.430> it<00:00:05.520> could<00:00:05.670> be<00:00:05.819> which<00:00:06.180> I'm<00:00:06.450> testing<00:00:06.930> this

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
think it could be which I'm testing this

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:08.780 
think it could be which I'm testing this
data<00:00:07.259> right<00:00:07.470> now<00:00:07.620> we<00:00:08.130> already<00:00:08.280> checked<00:00:08.550> the

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
data right now we already checked the

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.850 
data right now we already checked the
regulator<00:00:09.540> rectifier<00:00:09.719> and<00:00:10.290> that<00:00:10.410> checked<00:00:10.710> out

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
regulator rectifier and that checked out

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.190 
regulator rectifier and that checked out
I<00:00:11.130> also<00:00:11.639> check<00:00:11.940> the<00:00:12.120> battery<00:00:12.570> that<00:00:12.750> I<00:00:12.809> have<00:00:12.929> two

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
I also check the battery that I have two

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.390 
I also check the battery that I have two
other<00:00:13.380> videos<00:00:13.410> that<00:00:13.830> you<00:00:13.860> can<00:00:14.040> check<00:00:14.190> out<00:00:14.340> for

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
other videos that you can check out for

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.919 
other videos that you can check out for
those<00:00:14.759> how<00:00:14.969> to<00:00:15.030> tell<00:00:15.240> a<00:00:15.269> battery<00:00:15.630> and<00:00:15.870> a

those how to tell a battery and a

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.390 
those how to tell a battery and a
regulator<00:00:16.379> rectifier<00:00:16.500> and<00:00:17.039> how<00:00:17.100> to<00:00:17.160> test

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
regulator rectifier and how to test

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.460 
regulator rectifier and how to test
those<00:00:17.640> with<00:00:17.820> a<00:00:17.850> multimeter<00:00:18.300> so<00:00:19.260> what<00:00:19.410> I'm

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
those with a multimeter so what I'm

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.830 
those with a multimeter so what I'm
doing<00:00:19.529> right<00:00:19.740> now<00:00:19.890> is<00:00:20.369> I'm<00:00:20.670> checking<00:00:21.000> to<00:00:21.390> see

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
doing right now is I'm checking to see

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.920 
doing right now is I'm checking to see
how<00:00:22.020> many<00:00:22.170> ohms<00:00:23.060> between<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.449> three<00:00:24.689> phases

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
how many ohms between the three phases

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.189 
how many ohms between the three phases
of<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:25.800> stator<00:00:26.279> wires<00:00:26.609> so<00:00:27.570> I'm<00:00:27.930> going<00:00:28.050> to<00:00:28.109> show

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
of the stator wires so I'm going to show

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.689 
of the stator wires so I'm going to show
you<00:00:28.260> how<00:00:28.349> to<00:00:28.439> do<00:00:28.560> that<00:00:28.740> I'm<00:00:29.160> checking<00:00:29.189> homes

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
you how to do that I'm checking homes

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.609 
you how to do that I'm checking homes
basically<00:00:30.029> on<00:00:30.300> a<00:00:30.359> multimeter<00:00:30.810> right<00:00:31.320> here<00:00:31.529> is

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
basically on a multimeter right here is

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.819 
basically on a multimeter right here is
your<00:00:31.769> little<00:00:31.980> ohm<00:00:32.189> sign<00:00:32.550> and<00:00:33.500> you<00:00:34.500> want<00:00:34.680> to<00:00:34.739> go

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
your little ohm sign and you want to go

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.139 
your little ohm sign and you want to go
to<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:35.040> lowest<00:00:35.190> setting<00:00:35.340> so<00:00:35.670> I<00:00:35.700> set<00:00:35.969> it<00:00:36.000> right

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
to the lowest setting so I set it right

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.299 
to the lowest setting so I set it right
here<00:00:36.210> at<00:00:36.480> 20<00:00:36.840> and<00:00:37.440> when<00:00:37.530> you<00:00:37.620> turn<00:00:37.770> that<00:00:37.890> on<00:00:38.100> and

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
here at 20 and when you turn that on and

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.069 
here at 20 and when you turn that on and
you<00:00:38.460> touch<00:00:38.700> these<00:00:38.969> two<00:00:39.000> together<00:00:39.390> that's<00:00:39.960> the

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
you touch these two together that's the

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.900 
you touch these two together that's the
reading<00:00:40.350> I'm<00:00:40.559> getting<00:00:40.860> off<00:00:40.980> at<00:00:41.219> is<00:00:41.340> point<00:00:41.640> zero

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
reading I'm getting off at is point zero

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.180 
reading I'm getting off at is point zero
one<00:00:42.239> so<00:00:42.899> whatever<00:00:43.410> reading<00:00:43.590> you<00:00:43.800> get<00:00:43.890> if<00:00:44.070> you

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
one so whatever reading you get if you

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.770 
one so whatever reading you get if you
like<00:00:44.460> let's<00:00:44.700> say<00:00:44.820> you<00:00:44.879> get<00:00:45.090> a<00:00:45.120> reading<00:00:45.329> a<00:00:45.510> point

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
like let's say you get a reading a point

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.310 
like let's say you get a reading a point
zero<00:00:46.050> five<00:00:46.820> whatever<00:00:48.020> once<00:00:49.020> you<00:00:49.140> actually

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
zero five whatever once you actually

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.410 
zero five whatever once you actually
test<00:00:49.739> what<00:00:49.950> you're<00:00:50.100> testing<00:00:50.520> you<00:00:51.149> want<00:00:51.329> to

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
test what you're testing you want to

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.150 
test what you're testing you want to
subtract<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:51.809> original<00:00:52.140> reading<00:00:52.890> from

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
subtract the original reading from

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.069 
subtract the original reading from
whatever<00:00:53.399> you're<00:00:53.820> getting<00:00:54.180> because<00:00:54.329> that'll

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
whatever you're getting because that'll

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.549 
whatever you're getting because that'll
give<00:00:55.230> you<00:00:55.320> your<00:00:55.350> actual<00:00:55.800> ohms<00:00:57.230> so<00:00:58.230> yeah<00:00:58.379> we're

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
give you your actual ohms so yeah we're

00:00:58.559 --> 00:00:59.569 
give you your actual ohms so yeah we're
going<00:00:58.649> to<00:00:58.710> do<00:00:58.829> that<00:00:58.949> right<00:00:59.100> now<00:00:59.160> and<00:00:59.280> I'll<00:00:59.550> show

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
going to do that right now and I'll show

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.580 
going to do that right now and I'll show
you<00:00:59.760> the<00:01:00.000> different<00:01:00.329> phases<00:01:00.539> what<00:01:01.260> I<00:01:01.289> mean<00:01:01.500> by

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
you the different phases what I mean by

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.349 
you the different phases what I mean by
phases<00:01:01.980> is<00:01:02.129> see<00:01:02.340> these<00:01:02.460> wires<00:01:02.730> there's<00:01:03.090> three

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
phases is see these wires there's three

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.630 
phases is see these wires there's three
of<00:01:03.390> them<00:01:03.570> you<00:01:04.110> want<00:01:04.229> to<00:01:04.320> touch<00:01:04.530> put<00:01:05.460> one

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
of them you want to touch put one

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.460 
of them you want to touch put one
connector<00:01:06.030> in<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.240> first<00:01:06.659> one<00:01:06.900> one<00:01:07.110> connector

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
connector in the first one one connector

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.469 
connector in the first one one connector
on<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.590> second<00:01:07.920> one<00:01:08.010> that's<00:01:08.189> one<00:01:08.430> phase<00:01:08.700> put

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
on the second one that's one phase put

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.480 
on the second one that's one phase put
another<00:01:09.720> one<00:01:09.960> in<00:01:10.229> this<00:01:10.560> one<00:01:10.860> and<00:01:11.100> then<00:01:11.340> another

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
another one in this one and then another

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:12.530 
another one in this one and then another
one<00:01:11.790> in<00:01:11.909> this<00:01:12.060> side

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
one in this side

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.630 
one in this side
that's<00:01:12.900> another<00:01:13.200> phase<00:01:13.470> and<00:01:13.770> then<00:01:14.100> touch<00:01:14.340> this

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
that's another phase and then touch this

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:15.980 
that's another phase and then touch this
one<00:01:14.850> and<00:01:15.090> this<00:01:15.210> one<00:01:15.270> together<00:01:15.540> and<00:01:15.869> that's

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
one and this one together and that's

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.570 
one and this one together and that's
another<00:01:16.229> phase<00:01:16.500> so<00:01:17.040> that's<00:01:17.220> what<00:01:17.340> I<00:01:17.369> mean<00:01:17.520> by

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
another phase so that's what I mean by

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.039 
another phase so that's what I mean by
three<00:01:17.909> phases<00:01:18.119> so<00:01:18.390> you're<00:01:18.479> going<00:01:18.600> to<00:01:18.659> do<00:01:18.840> like

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
three phases so you're going to do like

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:25.130 
three phases so you're going to do like
a<00:01:19.320> one<00:01:20.130> two<00:01:20.520> a<00:01:21.439> one<00:01:22.439> two<00:01:22.470> and<00:01:23.299> then<00:01:24.299> like<00:01:24.540> a<00:01:24.570> one

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
a one two a one two and then like a one

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.550 
a one two a one two and then like a one
two<00:01:26.900> get<00:01:27.900> what<00:01:28.049> I'm<00:01:28.140> saying

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
two get what I'm saying

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.530 
two get what I'm saying
so<00:01:29.340> yeah<00:01:29.549> just<00:01:29.610> like<00:01:29.880> that<00:01:29.939> and<00:01:30.299> I'll<00:01:30.360> show<00:01:30.509> you

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
from that alright guys so I got I'm

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.760 
from that alright guys so I got I'm
starting<00:01:35.250> with<00:01:35.369> that<00:01:35.490> phase<00:01:35.759> and<00:01:36.119> I<00:01:36.740> got<00:01:37.740> a

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
starting with that phase and I got a

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.710 
starting with that phase and I got a
point<00:01:38.040> zero<00:01:38.280> one<00:01:38.579> which<00:01:38.820> is<00:01:38.970> exactly<00:01:39.150> what<00:01:39.689> it

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
point zero one which is exactly what it

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.749 
point zero one which is exactly what it
was<00:01:40.110> reading<00:01:40.530> at<00:01:40.680> so<00:01:40.920> that<00:01:41.159> means<00:01:41.400> that

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
was reading at so that means that

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.030 
was reading at so that means that
there's<00:01:42.119> zero<00:01:42.840> ohms<00:01:43.110> being<00:01:43.530> put<00:01:43.710> out<00:01:43.740> right

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
there's zero ohms being put out right

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.880 
there's zero ohms being put out right
now<00:01:44.450> so<00:01:45.450> I'm<00:01:45.720> pretty<00:01:45.960> much<00:01:46.079> sure<00:01:46.500> that<00:01:46.740> my

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
now so I'm pretty much sure that my

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.460 
now so I'm pretty much sure that my
stator<00:01:47.189> is<00:01:47.280> shot<00:01:47.759> in<00:01:47.909> this<00:01:48.030> bike<00:01:48.270> but<00:01:48.869> we'll<00:01:49.229> do

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
stator is shot in this bike but we'll do

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:50.990 
stator is shot in this bike but we'll do
all<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:49.680> phases<00:01:50.009> just<00:01:50.460> so<00:01:50.549> I<00:01:50.610> could<00:01:50.670> show<00:01:50.790> you

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
all the phases just so I could show you

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.850 
all the phases just so I could show you
the<00:01:51.390> differences<00:01:51.750> so<00:01:52.020> that's<00:01:52.320> phase<00:01:52.829> one

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
the differences so that's phase one

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.950 
the differences so that's phase one
where<00:01:55.100> Phase<00:01:56.100> two<00:01:56.130> guys<00:01:56.700> as<00:01:57.570> you<00:01:57.719> can<00:01:57.810> see<00:01:57.930> I

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
where Phase two guys as you can see I

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.530 
where Phase two guys as you can see I
switched<00:01:58.320> them<00:01:58.530> I'm<00:01:59.280> getting<00:01:59.640> point<00:02:00.119> zero<00:02:00.360> one

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
switched them I'm getting point zero one

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:01.999 
switched them I'm getting point zero one
which<00:02:00.689> means<00:02:00.960> it's<00:02:01.200> at<00:02:01.439> zero<00:02:01.740> because

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
which means it's at zero because

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.770 
which means it's at zero because
remember<00:02:02.040> you<00:02:02.399> subtract<00:02:02.790> two<00:02:03.000> point<00:02:03.270> zero<00:02:03.479> one

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
remember you subtract two point zero one

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.869 
remember you subtract two point zero one
so<00:02:04.469> that's<00:02:04.590> zero<00:02:05.250> ohm<00:02:06.079> and<00:02:07.079> phase<00:02:07.740> three<00:02:08.190> so<00:02:08.700> as

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
so that's zero ohm and phase three so as

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.180 
so that's zero ohm and phase three so as
you<00:02:09.000> can<00:02:09.119> see<00:02:09.179> I<00:02:09.360> got<00:02:09.629> in<00:02:09.899> the<00:02:10.110> last<00:02:10.560> phase<00:02:10.830> and

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
you can see I got in the last phase and

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.580 
you can see I got in the last phase and
it's<00:02:11.790> also<00:02:12.120> point<00:02:12.360> zero<00:02:12.599> one<00:02:12.780> so<00:02:12.989> right<00:02:13.170> now<00:02:13.379> my

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
it's also point zero one so right now my

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.950 
it's also point zero one so right now my
stay

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960 
stay

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.830 
stay
years<00:02:14.310> between<00:02:15.310> these<00:02:15.460> wires<00:02:15.700> is<00:02:16.000> zero<00:02:16.540> ohms

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
years between these wires is zero ohms

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.020 
years between these wires is zero ohms
which<00:02:17.650> is<00:02:17.770> what<00:02:17.920> you<00:02:18.010> do<00:02:18.160> not<00:02:18.340> want<00:02:18.550> that<00:02:18.880> means

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
which is what you do not want that means

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.750 
which is what you do not want that means
that<00:02:19.240> it's<00:02:19.570> probably<00:02:19.690> bad<00:02:20.080> so<00:02:20.920> you<00:02:21.520> want<00:02:21.700> to

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
that it's probably bad so you want to

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.820 
that it's probably bad so you want to
see<00:02:21.910> at<00:02:22.030> least<00:02:22.210> four<00:02:22.450> or<00:02:22.570> five<00:02:22.600> ohms<00:02:22.960> between

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
see at least four or five ohms between

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.160 
see at least four or five ohms between
those<00:02:24.040> so<00:02:24.790> I'm<00:02:25.270> pretty<00:02:25.480> much<00:02:25.600> sure<00:02:25.900> that<00:02:26.080> my

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
those so I'm pretty much sure that my

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.540 
those so I'm pretty much sure that my
stator<00:02:26.410> is<00:02:26.470> bad<00:02:26.680> so<00:02:26.950> that's<00:02:27.130> what<00:02:27.310> I'm

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
stator is bad so that's what I'm

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:28.710 
stator is bad so that's what I'm
probably<00:02:27.790> going<00:02:28.000> to<00:02:28.060> be<00:02:28.150> changing<00:02:28.540> in<00:02:28.600> this

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
probably going to be changing in this

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.050 
probably going to be changing in this
bike<00:02:29.130> but<00:02:30.130> another<00:02:30.340> thing<00:02:30.580> that<00:02:30.700> you<00:02:30.820> want<00:02:30.910> to

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
bike but another thing that you want to

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:32.610 
bike but another thing that you want to
check<00:02:31.180> too<00:02:31.390> after<00:02:31.630> you<00:02:31.810> do<00:02:31.930> the<00:02:32.050> ohms<00:02:32.230> test

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
check too after you do the ohms test

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.890 
check too after you do the ohms test
right<00:02:32.860> here<00:02:32.890> is<00:02:33.190> switch<00:02:33.910> it<00:02:34.090> to<00:02:34.120> voltage<00:02:34.600> which

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
right here is switch it to voltage which

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.660 
right here is switch it to voltage which
you're<00:02:35.050> going<00:02:35.140> to<00:02:35.200> switch<00:02:35.500> up<00:02:35.740> to<00:02:35.890> here<00:02:36.130> right

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
you're going to switch up to here right

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.130 
you're going to switch up to here right
there<00:02:36.880> and<00:02:37.150> that's<00:02:37.540> how<00:02:37.660> you<00:02:37.720> like<00:02:37.900> check<00:02:38.110> a

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
there and that's how you like check a

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.470 
there and that's how you like check a
battery<00:02:38.530> like<00:02:38.800> in<00:02:38.980> my<00:02:39.280> first<00:02:39.490> video<00:02:39.790> with<00:02:39.940> how

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
battery like in my first video with how

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.060 
battery like in my first video with how
to<00:02:40.540> test<00:02:40.780> a<00:02:40.870> battery<00:02:41.200> it's<00:02:41.470> the<00:02:41.530> same<00:02:41.740> setting

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070 
to test a battery it's the same setting

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:43.590 
to test a battery it's the same setting
we're<00:02:42.190> using<00:02:42.370> and<00:02:42.760> when<00:02:43.120> the<00:02:43.210> bikes<00:02:43.420> are

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
we're using and when the bikes are

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.050 
we're using and when the bikes are
running<00:02:44.280> when<00:02:45.280> the<00:02:45.370> bikes<00:02:45.550> running<00:02:45.880> and<00:02:46.000> you

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
running when the bikes running and you

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.090 
running when the bikes running and you
have<00:02:46.210> them<00:02:46.360> in<00:02:46.480> here<00:02:46.600> like<00:02:46.660> this<00:02:46.960> and<00:02:47.020> you<00:02:47.500> any

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
have them in here like this and you any

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:49.770 
have them in here like this and you any
of<00:02:48.280> the<00:02:48.400> phases<00:02:48.610> you<00:02:48.970> should<00:02:49.180> be<00:02:49.300> getting<00:02:49.600> a

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
of the phases you should be getting a

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.160 
of the phases you should be getting a
voltage<00:02:50.410> so<00:02:51.100> it<00:02:51.430> should<00:02:51.610> be<00:02:51.640> putting<00:02:52.000> out<00:02:52.210> at

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
voltage so it should be putting out at

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.430 
voltage so it should be putting out at
least<00:02:53.650> you<00:02:54.460> know<00:02:54.550> twelve<00:02:55.080> volts<00:02:56.080> or<00:02:56.200> whatever

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
least you know twelve volts or whatever

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.200 
least you know twelve volts or whatever
it<00:02:56.560> puts<00:02:56.770> out<00:02:56.920> while<00:02:57.130> it's<00:02:57.250> at<00:02:57.370> idle<00:02:57.700> and<00:02:57.850> then

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:58.210 
it puts out while it's at idle and then

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:00.060 
it puts out while it's at idle and then
as<00:02:58.360> you<00:02:58.540> increase<00:02:58.810> the<00:02:59.050> RPM<00:02:59.200> you<00:02:59.770> should<00:02:59.950> be

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.070 
as you increase the RPM you should be

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.780 
as you increase the RPM you should be
getting<00:03:00.310> like<00:03:00.990> it<00:03:01.990> should<00:03:02.200> be<00:03:02.790> exponentially

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
getting like it should be exponentially

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.390 
getting like it should be exponentially
growing<00:03:04.270> in<00:03:04.600> voltage<00:03:05.470> I<00:03:05.890> mean<00:03:06.040> you<00:03:06.100> should<00:03:06.280> get

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
growing in voltage I mean you should get

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.120 
growing in voltage I mean you should get
be<00:03:06.580> getting<00:03:06.850> 40<00:03:07.180> 50<00:03:07.570> volts<00:03:07.960> out<00:03:08.140> of<00:03:08.740> a<00:03:08.860> stator

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
be getting 40 50 volts out of a stator

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:10.860

than<00:03:17.220> 15<00:03:18.220> volts<00:03:18.580> to<00:03:18.730> the<00:03:18.760> battery<00:03:19.120> to<00:03:19.270> charge

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:19.300 
than 15 volts to the battery to charge

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.630 
than 15 volts to the battery to charge
and<00:03:19.840> what<00:03:20.380> I'm<00:03:20.470> noticing<00:03:20.740> from<00:03:20.950> this<00:03:21.190> bike<00:03:21.400> is

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
and what I'm noticing from this bike is

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.450 
and what I'm noticing from this bike is
that<00:03:21.670> when<00:03:22.240> the<00:03:22.330> bikes<00:03:22.540> running<00:03:22.870> the<00:03:23.770> battery

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:24.460 
that when the bikes running the battery

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:25.980 
that when the bikes running the battery
is<00:03:24.580> only<00:03:24.760> getting<00:03:25.060> the<00:03:25.450> same<00:03:25.630> amount<00:03:25.960> of

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:25.990 
is only getting the same amount of

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:28.170 
is only getting the same amount of
voltage<00:03:26.710> that<00:03:27.010> it<00:03:27.160> is<00:03:27.280> already<00:03:27.700> charged<00:03:28.000> so

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
voltage that it is already charged so

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.150 
voltage that it is already charged so
it's<00:03:28.570> not<00:03:28.840> getting<00:03:29.260> it's<00:03:29.530> not<00:03:29.740> charging<00:03:30.130> the

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
it's not getting it's not charging the

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.520 
it's not getting it's not charging the
battery<00:03:30.550> so<00:03:31.240> I<00:03:31.270> think<00:03:31.630> I<00:03:31.840> found<00:03:31.990> my<00:03:32.110> problem

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
battery so I think I found my problem

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:33.840 
battery so I think I found my problem
and<00:03:32.680> I'll<00:03:32.920> show<00:03:33.100> you<00:03:33.190> that<00:03:33.310> guys<00:03:33.490> right<00:03:33.730> now

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:33.850 
and I'll show you that guys right now

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:35.070 
and I'll show you that guys right now
I'll<00:03:34.000> turn<00:03:34.120> the<00:03:34.180> bike<00:03:34.420> on<00:03:34.630> and<00:03:34.840> I'll<00:03:34.930> show<00:03:35.050> you

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:35.080 
I'll turn the bike on and I'll show you

00:03:35.080 --> 00:04:05.410 
I'll turn the bike on and I'll show you
what<00:03:35.320> I'm<00:03:35.410> getting<00:03:35.710> in<00:03:35.800> voltage<00:03:36.130> here

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:05.420 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:09.500 

alright<00:04:06.420> guys<00:04:06.569> so<00:04:06.629> as<00:04:06.959> you<00:04:07.140> can<00:04:07.260> see<00:04:07.760> the<00:04:08.760> when

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
alright guys so as you can see the when

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.420 
alright guys so as you can see the when
I<00:04:09.540> hooked<00:04:10.379> it<00:04:10.560> up<00:04:10.709> you<00:04:10.829> can<00:04:10.980> see<00:04:11.099> that<00:04:11.250> there's

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
I hooked it up you can see that there's

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.580 
I hooked it up you can see that there's
like<00:04:12.000> zero<00:04:12.030> voltage<00:04:12.720> coming<00:04:12.989> out<00:04:13.200> of<00:04:13.409> the

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
like zero voltage coming out of the

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.879 
like zero voltage coming out of the
three<00:04:13.799> phases<00:04:14.010> of<00:04:14.489> the<00:04:15.299> stator<00:04:15.720> wires<00:04:16.019> so<00:04:16.769> I'm

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:16.889 
three phases of the stator wires so I'm

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:18.140 
three phases of the stator wires so I'm
pretty<00:04:17.100> sure<00:04:17.220> that's<00:04:17.370> what<00:04:17.489> it<00:04:17.699> is<00:04:17.729> and<00:04:18.060> then

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
pretty sure that's what it is and then

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:19.370 
pretty sure that's what it is and then
when<00:04:18.359> I<00:04:18.389> hooked<00:04:18.630> it<00:04:18.690> up<00:04:18.750> to<00:04:18.810> the<00:04:18.930> battery<00:04:19.139> it

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
when I hooked it up to the battery it

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.140 
when I hooked it up to the battery it
fell<00:04:19.620> out<00:04:19.829> so<00:04:20.100> you<00:04:20.190> only<00:04:20.280> saw<00:04:20.489> it<00:04:20.549> for<00:04:20.729> a<00:04:20.760> second

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
fell out so you only saw it for a second

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.300 
fell out so you only saw it for a second
but<00:04:21.359> it's<00:04:21.959> only<00:04:22.289> getting<00:04:22.500> the<00:04:22.740> same<00:04:22.919> amount<00:04:23.039> of

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
but it's only getting the same amount of

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.010 
but it's only getting the same amount of
voltage<00:04:23.639> that<00:04:23.970> the<00:04:24.419> battery<00:04:24.840> is<00:04:24.900> already

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
voltage that the battery is already

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:26.810 
voltage that the battery is already
putting<00:04:25.380> out<00:04:25.500> so<00:04:25.710> there's<00:04:25.860> like<00:04:26.100> no<00:04:26.520> voltage

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
putting out so there's like no voltage

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.990 
putting out so there's like no voltage
actually<00:04:27.479> getting<00:04:27.840> to<00:04:28.020> the<00:04:28.139> battery<00:04:28.470> so<00:04:28.740> the

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000 
actually getting to the battery so the

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.340 
actually getting to the battery so the
bike<00:04:30.000> is<00:04:30.180> completely<00:04:30.720> running<00:04:31.020> off<00:04:31.139> of<00:04:31.169> the

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.350 
bike is completely running off of the

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:32.689 
bike is completely running off of the
battery's<00:04:31.770> power<00:04:31.979> and<00:04:32.250> as<00:04:32.310> soon<00:04:32.460> as<00:04:32.580> that

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:32.699 
battery's power and as soon as that

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:34.550 
battery's power and as soon as that
battery<00:04:33.030> finally<00:04:33.330> dies<00:04:33.510> that's<00:04:33.810> why<00:04:34.169> my<00:04:34.380> bike

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
battery finally dies that's why my bike

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.409 
battery finally dies that's why my bike
completely<00:04:34.860> shut<00:04:35.250> off<00:04:35.280> because<00:04:36.000> there's<00:04:36.270> not

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:36.419 
completely shut off because there's not

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:38.900 
completely shut off because there's not
enough<00:04:36.919> there's<00:04:37.919> not<00:04:37.979> even<00:04:38.070> enough<00:04:38.370> voltage

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910 
enough there's not even enough voltage

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:40.550 
enough there's not even enough voltage
when<00:04:39.120> that<00:04:39.210> battery<00:04:39.539> gets<00:04:40.110> you<00:04:40.229> know<00:04:40.320> down<00:04:40.530> to

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
when that battery gets you know down to

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.800 
when that battery gets you know down to
eight<00:04:41.039> or<00:04:41.190> nine<00:04:41.340> volts<00:04:41.699> to<00:04:41.850> even<00:04:42.150> spark<00:04:42.479> the

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
eight or nine volts to even spark the

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.860 
eight or nine volts to even spark the
spark<00:04:43.560> plug<00:04:43.770> so<00:04:44.010> I<00:04:44.220> think<00:04:44.940> that's<00:04:45.240> my<00:04:45.330> problem

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
spark plug so I think that's my problem

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.050 
spark plug so I think that's my problem
and<00:04:46.020> I'll<00:04:46.590> be<00:04:46.770> changing<00:04:47.190> the<00:04:47.280> stator<00:04:47.520> soon<00:04:47.820> and

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
and I'll be changing the stator soon and

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:49.850 
and I'll be changing the stator soon and
I'll<00:04:48.240> probably<00:04:48.419> show<00:04:48.630> you<00:04:48.690> guys<00:04:48.900> bits<00:04:49.680> and

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 
I'll probably show you guys bits and

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.529 
I'll probably show you guys bits and
pieces<00:04:50.010> of<00:04:50.160> that<00:04:50.400> while<00:04:50.610> I'm<00:04:50.760> tearing<00:04:51.389> it<00:04:51.510> down

00:04:51.529 --> 00:04:51.539 
pieces of that while I'm tearing it down

00:04:51.539 --> 00:05:00.850 
pieces of that while I'm tearing it down
so<00:04:51.960> talk<00:04:52.740> to<00:04:52.770> you<00:04:53.010> later
