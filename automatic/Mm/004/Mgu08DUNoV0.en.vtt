00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.090
 Here we present some of the 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.330
 best images of beings 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:09.809
 alive extraterrestrials the presentation 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:12.410
 will be in chronological order the first of 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:16.830
 these images correspond to January of 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:20.430
 1990 the case had begun on 7 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:23.160
 May 1989 when a UFO crashed 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:26.570
 in the kalahari desert in south africa 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.570
 let's see these images 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:34.489
 these images correspond to area 51 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:37.370
 in the call s 4 of area 51 is where 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:40.340
 this case happened in the first place 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:43.159
 we would have obtained before 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:46.699
 official documents Air Force 

00:00:43.159 --> 00:00:48.920
 of South Africa where the fall was related 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:51.379
 of an unidentified flying object and 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:54.379
 also the recovery of two beings 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:56.659
 alive inside this ship these 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:59.660
 beings were sent to the us one of 

00:00:56.659 --> 00:01:02.300
 they died practically when the 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:06.890
 another was kept alive since June 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:09.770
 and until January 1990 these are the 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.960
 extraordinary images we can see there 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.869
 a legend that says dni department of 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:17.509
 naval intelligence number 27 also 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:19.550
 we see the time code in front of the being we see 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:21.710
 an apparatus called a pulse oximeter 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:24.490
 which reveals the amount of oxygen and 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.979
 the heartbeat of this being 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.049
 he can move in the dark never 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:32.350
 we will see his hands since he has them 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:35.320
 tied behind his back to a 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:37.030
 small chair in which he was 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.520
 is having serious problems for 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:42.369
 breathe according to the person who 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:45.580
 extracted this video from area 51 on 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:47.229
 safe for called víctor pseudónimo these 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:50.380
 beings do not have the immune system 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:53.439
 It is therefore very easy for them to lodge in their 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.000
 fungus and bacteria virus system this 

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:57.670
 caused an infection in the tracks 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.850
 respiratory because of this this being 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.860
 because it is practically suffering what 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.380
 we could say is a kind of a 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.899
 strong flu a strong cold but that 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.970
 he is not drowning here he can not 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:13.860
 breathe and less when you have your hands 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:16.569
 tied he is making efforts for 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.750
 really try to pull air but not 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:22.799
 you can do it open your mouth we see that from 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:25.030
 the mouth comes a little blood 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:27.549
 Obviously he is drowning 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.799
 we also see that the pulse oximeter 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:30.880
 is very irregular revealing that it is 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:33.240
 suffering 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:36.430
 possibly some heart attacks 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:38.230
 in the people who are in front of him already 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.970
 a glass separates are very 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.550
 restless there we can see also the 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:45.010
 reflection that occurs in the glass being 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:48.010
 practically here he has reclined on 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.990
 a small table finally reaches the 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.780
 paramedics and the only thing they do is 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:55.360
 clean the blood does not help you to extract 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:58.000
 the phlegms do not help him 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:00.060
 way we see that his hands do not appear 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.280
 because this being is literally 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.350
 prisoner cleanses the blood but 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:08.950
 good the being continues in this process of 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:12.070
 death and finally he died that's why 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:15.000
 Victor stole these images he took them 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:17.710
 the audio had audio but it was removed 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.690
 unfortunately for us in this 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:22.690
 research work for this reason 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.340
 Well, I think it's one of the cases 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.980
 most extraordinary of all time 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.870
 is documented with papers it is 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.910
 documented with an extraordinary video 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.069
 all the analyzes that we have done 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:35.640
 are 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:39.659
 authentic what you just saw is 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:41.879
 a real extraterrestrial being and we 

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:43.889
 we continue here in the third millennium 

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:47.340
 we come back with the extraordinary ones 

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:50.700
 images captured in england towards 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:52.799
 end of 1999 where you will see the 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:56.269
 less two extraterrestrial beings with 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:56.269
 all clarity we continue
