and if I turn around you can kind of see

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.150

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
glance this looks like some sort of

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.410

virtual<00:00:21.720> reality<00:00:22.020> unit<00:00:22.920> line<00:00:23.130> maybe<00:00:23.420> google

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
the phone and it makes everything look a

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:11.719 
the phone and it makes everything look a
whole<00:01:10.500> lot<00:01:10.560> bigger<00:01:10.830> so<00:01:11.159> it's<00:01:11.400> kind<00:01:11.580> of<00:01:11.610> like

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
whole lot bigger so it's kind of like

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.109 
whole lot bigger so it's kind of like
looking<00:01:11.939> at<00:01:12.210> a<00:01:12.270> 60-inch<00:01:13.170> TV<00:01:14.040> or<00:01:14.189> so<00:01:14.430> basically

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
looking at a 60-inch TV or so basically

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.330 
looking at a 60-inch TV or so basically
all<00:01:15.150> it<00:01:15.270> does<00:01:15.540> is<00:01:15.750> just<00:01:15.990> makes<00:01:16.350> your<00:01:16.590> phone

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
all it does is just makes your phone

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.370 
all it does is just makes your phone
screen<00:01:17.759> look<00:01:18.150> a<00:01:18.210> whole<00:01:18.330> lot<00:01:18.390> larger<00:01:18.780> so<00:01:19.229> you're

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
screen look a whole lot larger so you're

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.480 
screen look a whole lot larger so you're
not<00:01:19.470> getting<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:19.860> full<00:01:20.009> effect<00:01:20.340> there

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
not getting the full effect there

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.460 
not getting the full effect there
because<00:01:20.700> you<00:01:20.790> would<00:01:20.939> need<00:01:21.060> two<00:01:21.299> eyes<00:01:21.479> focused

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
because you would need two eyes focused

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.399 
because you would need two eyes focused
in<00:01:22.799> on<00:01:23.240> the<00:01:24.240> screen<00:01:24.600> there<00:01:24.810> so<00:01:25.080> it's<00:01:25.200> hard<00:01:25.380> for

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
in on the screen there so it's hard for

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.359 
in on the screen there so it's hard for
me<00:01:25.590> to<00:01:25.680> really<00:01:25.860> show<00:01:26.130> you<00:01:26.450> the<00:01:27.450> difference<00:01:28.369> but

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
me to really show you the difference but

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.219 
me to really show you the difference but
when<00:01:29.490> you<00:01:29.579> do<00:01:29.670> put<00:01:29.820> it<00:01:29.939> on<00:01:30.060> you<00:01:30.329> really<00:01:30.630> do<00:01:30.780> feel

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
when you do put it on you really do feel

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.990 
when you do put it on you really do feel
like<00:01:31.409> you're<00:01:31.619> looking<00:01:31.770> at<00:01:32.070> a<00:01:32.100> much<00:01:32.400> larger

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
like you're looking at a much larger

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.730 
like you're looking at a much larger
screen<00:01:33.509> I<00:01:33.750> really<00:01:33.990> like<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.290> fact<00:01:34.439> that<00:01:34.590> it

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
screen I really like the fact that it

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.520 
screen I really like the fact that it
has<00:01:34.950> these<00:01:35.939> little<00:01:36.180> it<00:01:37.049> has<00:01:37.259> this<00:01:37.439> little

kind of shooting their life in a

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.359 
kind of shooting their life in a
first-person<00:01:59.820> view<00:02:00.240> mode<00:02:00.899> I<00:02:01.770> think<00:02:02.250> that

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
first-person view mode I think that

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:03.679 
first-person view mode I think that
would<00:02:02.430> be<00:02:02.549> kind<00:02:02.759> of<00:02:02.790> ridiculous<00:02:03.060> to<00:02:03.509> walk

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
would be kind of ridiculous to walk

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.330 
would be kind of ridiculous to walk
around<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.079> world<00:02:04.259> with<00:02:04.500> this<00:02:04.710> thing<00:02:04.950> on<00:02:05.130> your

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
around the world with this thing on your

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.999 
around the world with this thing on your
head<00:02:05.540> but<00:02:06.540> that's<00:02:06.689> just<00:02:06.869> me<00:02:07.110> maybe<00:02:07.740> you<00:02:07.920> can

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
head but that's just me maybe you can

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.529 
head but that's just me maybe you can
see<00:02:08.190> yourself<00:02:08.310> doing<00:02:08.670> something<00:02:08.849> like<00:02:09.270> that<00:02:09.509> I

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
see yourself doing something like that I

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.839 
see yourself doing something like that I
think<00:02:09.780> this<00:02:09.869> is<00:02:09.929> more<00:02:10.229> for<00:02:10.560> at-home<00:02:10.890> personal

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
think this is more for at-home personal

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.730 
think this is more for at-home personal
media<00:02:12.569> consumption

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
media consumption

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.700 
media consumption
not<00:02:13.950> really<00:02:14.340> for<00:02:14.580> any<00:02:15.450> activity<00:02:16.140> outside<00:02:16.290> of

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
not really for any activity outside of

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.260 
not really for any activity outside of
the<00:02:16.800> home<00:02:16.980> I<00:02:17.190> would<00:02:17.340> just<00:02:17.490> feel<00:02:17.550> ridiculous

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
the home I would just feel ridiculous

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.860 
the home I would just feel ridiculous
wearing<00:02:18.630> this<00:02:18.810> on<00:02:19.050> a<00:02:20.010> plane<00:02:20.610> or<00:02:21.060> wearing<00:02:21.510> it<00:02:21.660> on

a train or anything like that basically

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.050 
a train or anything like that basically
I<00:02:25.110> would<00:02:25.290> feel<00:02:25.440> most<00:02:25.620> comfortable<00:02:25.980> laying<00:02:26.820> in

something like that that's basically
what<00:02:30.660> i<00:02:30.690> have<00:02:30.930> found<00:02:31.110> this<00:02:31.320> useful<00:02:31.530> for<00:02:31.920> is

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
what i have found this useful for is

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.880 
what i have found this useful for is
media<00:02:32.640> consumption<00:02:33.120> at<00:02:33.480> home<00:02:33.780> in<00:02:34.650> the<00:02:34.770> privacy

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
media consumption at home in the privacy

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.340 
media consumption at home in the privacy
of<00:02:35.250> my<00:02:35.550> own<00:02:35.580> home<00:02:35.700> so<00:02:36.090> basically<00:02:36.570> what<00:02:37.020> comes

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
of my own home so basically what comes

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.460 
of my own home so basically what comes
with<00:02:37.650> this<00:02:37.890> this<00:02:38.430> is<00:02:38.670> actually<00:02:39.180> the<00:02:39.300> beta<00:02:39.600> kit

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
with this this is actually the beta kit

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.660 
with this this is actually the beta kit
and<00:02:40.830> it's<00:02:40.980> not<00:02:41.430> really<00:02:41.700> even<00:02:42.060> ready<00:02:43.220> for<00:02:44.220> mass

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
and it's not really even ready for mass

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.610 
and it's not really even ready for mass
consumption<00:02:45.240> and<00:02:45.630> i'm<00:02:45.960> sure<00:02:46.170> they'll<00:02:46.380> tweak

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
consumption and i'm sure they'll tweak

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.830 
consumption and i'm sure they'll tweak
it<00:02:46.860> and<00:02:47.010> make<00:02:47.070> changes<00:02:47.760> to<00:02:48.000> it<00:02:48.330> but<00:02:48.570> you<00:02:48.690> get<00:02:48.780> a

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
it and make changes to it but you get a

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.020 
it and make changes to it but you get a
little<00:02:49.080> strap<00:02:49.380> that<00:02:49.620> can<00:02:49.800> be<00:02:49.950> snapped<00:02:50.520> in<00:02:50.820> here

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
little strap that can be snapped in here

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.570 
little strap that can be snapped in here
for<00:02:51.210> privacy<00:02:51.450> and<00:02:52.020> also<00:02:52.830> just<00:02:53.040> to<00:02:53.160> make<00:02:53.400> it

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
for privacy and also just to make it

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.280 
for privacy and also just to make it
darker<00:02:54.360> in<00:02:54.480> here<00:02:54.510> so<00:02:54.780> you<00:02:54.870> can<00:02:54.990> see<00:02:55.020> your

magnified there are several different
lenses<00:03:04.380> the<00:03:04.530> one<00:03:04.740> that<00:03:04.920> comes<00:03:05.160> pre<00:03:05.580> inserted

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
lenses the one that comes pre inserted

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.700 
lenses the one that comes pre inserted
here<00:03:06.540> is<00:03:06.660> the<00:03:06.810> one<00:03:06.960> that<00:03:07.080> i<00:03:07.170> found<00:03:07.440> that<00:03:07.530> was

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:07.710 
here is the one that i found that was

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:09.680 
here is the one that i found that was
best<00:03:07.980> for<00:03:08.280> me<00:03:08.430> that's<00:03:08.820> probably<00:03:09.120> the<00:03:09.450> one

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
best for me that's probably the one

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.840 
best for me that's probably the one
that's<00:03:09.870> best<00:03:10.080> for<00:03:10.230> most<00:03:10.560> people<00:03:10.980> but<00:03:11.580> you<00:03:11.730> do

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
that's best for most people but you do

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:15.590 
that's best for most people but you do
have<00:03:12.000> other<00:03:12.600> various<00:03:13.170> lenses<00:03:13.440> data<00:03:14.390> came<00:03:15.390> with

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
have other various lenses data came with

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.290 
have other various lenses data came with
a<00:03:15.630> hat<00:03:15.990> so<00:03:16.770> i<00:03:16.800> found<00:03:17.070> that<00:03:17.310> when<00:03:17.520> you<00:03:17.670> snap<00:03:18.000> the

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 
a hat so i found that when you snap the

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
a hat so i found that when you snap the
hat<00:03:20.150> into<00:03:21.150> it<00:03:21.330> and<00:03:21.570> put<00:03:21.780> that<00:03:21.870> on<00:03:22.020> your<00:03:22.140> head

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
hat into it and put that on your head

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.550 
hat into it and put that on your head
it's<00:03:22.530> a<00:03:22.620> whole<00:03:22.800> lot<00:03:23.040> easier<00:03:23.480> than<00:03:24.480> holding<00:03:25.380> it

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
it's a whole lot easier than holding it

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.320 
it's a whole lot easier than holding it
forever<00:03:26.010> but<00:03:26.460> then<00:03:26.640> one<00:03:26.910> thing<00:03:27.060> that<00:03:27.210> I<00:03:27.270> will

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
forever but then one thing that I will

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.690 
forever but then one thing that I will
say<00:03:27.480> is<00:03:27.750> when<00:03:27.900> I<00:03:27.930> did<00:03:28.140> lay<00:03:28.350> down<00:03:28.560> this<00:03:29.250> kind<00:03:29.580> of

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
say is when I did lay down this kind of

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.610 
say is when I did lay down this kind of
rest<00:03:30.090> on<00:03:30.300> the<00:03:30.390> bridge<00:03:30.600> of<00:03:30.690> your<00:03:30.780> nose<00:03:30.900> and<00:03:31.410> it's

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
rest on the bridge of your nose and it's

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.550 
rest on the bridge of your nose and it's
kind<00:03:31.800> of<00:03:31.830> sharp<00:03:32.190> and<00:03:32.400> jagged<00:03:32.610> here<00:03:33.060> it's

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
kind of sharp and jagged here it's

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.740 
kind of sharp and jagged here it's
pretty<00:03:34.560> uncomfortable<00:03:35.120> but<00:03:36.120> if<00:03:36.330> that<00:03:36.540> becomes

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
pretty uncomfortable but if that becomes

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.060 
pretty uncomfortable but if that becomes
uncomfortable<00:03:37.110> you<00:03:37.440> just<00:03:37.650> take<00:03:37.770> the<00:03:37.890> hat<00:03:38.040> off

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
uncomfortable you just take the hat off

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:40.430 
uncomfortable you just take the hat off
and<00:03:38.220> just<00:03:38.550> hold<00:03:38.790> it<00:03:38.940> and<00:03:39.150> that<00:03:39.990> seems<00:03:40.200> to<00:03:40.290> be

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
and just hold it and that seems to be

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.060 
and just hold it and that seems to be
more<00:03:40.680> comfortable<00:03:42.530> the<00:03:43.530> way<00:03:43.650> you<00:03:43.710> would<00:03:43.920> put

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.070 
more comfortable the way you would put

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:46.010 
more comfortable the way you would put
your<00:03:44.190> phone<00:03:44.370> in<00:03:44.550> here<00:03:44.790> I<00:03:45.000> tried<00:03:45.750> different

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:46.020 
your phone in here I tried different

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:48.650 
your phone in here I tried different
phones<00:03:46.410> this<00:03:46.770> is<00:03:46.980> the<00:03:47.400> view<00:03:47.700> XL<00:03:48.180> so<00:03:48.450> it's

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
phones this is the view XL so it's

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.870 
phones this is the view XL so it's
supposed<00:03:48.720> to<00:03:48.870> be<00:03:49.020> for<00:03:49.170> larger<00:03:49.500> screens<00:03:49.890> I'm

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
supposed to be for larger screens I'm

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.510 
supposed to be for larger screens I'm
using<00:03:51.210> an<00:03:51.450> HTC<00:03:51.900> one<00:03:52.140> in<00:03:52.380> eight<00:03:52.590> specifically

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:53.520 
using an HTC one in eight specifically

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.700 
using an HTC one in eight specifically
because<00:03:53.700> anything<00:03:54.690> bigger<00:03:54.930> than<00:03:55.020> that<00:03:55.200> seems

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:55.710 
because anything bigger than that seems

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:58.220 
because anything bigger than that seems
to<00:03:55.890> not<00:03:56.010> fit<00:03:56.340> well<00:03:56.520> I<00:03:56.760> try<00:03:57.240> to<00:03:57.270> note<00:03:57.540> for<00:03:57.870> in<00:03:58.140> the

to not fit well I try to note for in the

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.710 
to not fit well I try to note for in the
Nexus<00:03:58.590> 6<00:03:58.830> which<00:03:59.130> both<00:03:59.370> have<00:03:59.610> the<00:04:00.330> larger

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
Nexus 6 which both have the larger

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.110 
Nexus 6 which both have the larger
screens<00:04:01.080> and<00:04:01.320> they<00:04:01.410> didn't<00:04:01.620> fit<00:04:01.800> well<00:04:02.010> the<00:04:02.760> LG

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
screens and they didn't fit well the LG

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.090 
screens and they didn't fit well the LG
g3<00:04:03.300> seemed<00:04:03.750> to<00:04:03.870> fit<00:04:04.020> well<00:04:04.140> and<00:04:04.200> I<00:04:04.380> like<00:04:04.590> the<00:04:04.770> LG

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
g3 seemed to fit well and I like the LG

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:06.800 
g3 seemed to fit well and I like the LG
g3<00:04:05.310> because<00:04:05.820> it<00:04:05.940> has<00:04:06.090> the<00:04:06.300> buttons<00:04:06.570> on<00:04:06.720> the

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
g3 because it has the buttons on the

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.710 
g3 because it has the buttons on the
back<00:04:06.980> it's<00:04:07.980> kind<00:04:08.190> of<00:04:08.250> hard<00:04:08.460> to<00:04:08.520> access<00:04:08.760> your

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
back it's kind of hard to access your

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.810 
back it's kind of hard to access your
volume<00:04:10.550> buttons<00:04:11.870> with<00:04:12.870> this<00:04:13.140> particular

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:13.820 
volume buttons with this particular

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:16.190 
volume buttons with this particular
setup<00:04:14.820> but<00:04:15.390> you<00:04:15.510> would<00:04:15.630> just<00:04:15.750> insert<00:04:16.170> the

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
setup but you would just insert the

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.520 
setup but you would just insert the
corners<00:04:16.650> of<00:04:16.680> your<00:04:16.890> phone<00:04:17.160> down<00:04:18.150> bottom<00:04:18.630> and<00:04:18.810> in

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
corners of your phone down bottom and in

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.740 
corners of your phone down bottom and in
the<00:04:19.620> top<00:04:19.830> corners<00:04:20.280> in<00:04:20.489> the<00:04:21.000> top<00:04:21.180> holes<00:04:21.450> and

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
the top corners in the top holes and

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.380 
the top corners in the top holes and
then<00:04:22.140> you<00:04:22.200> would<00:04:22.380> just<00:04:22.410> velcro<00:04:22.800> it<00:04:23.100> in<00:04:23.300> and<00:04:24.300> it

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:24.390 
then you would just velcro it in and it

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:25.730 
then you would just velcro it in and it
holds<00:04:24.570> in<00:04:24.780> pretty<00:04:25.050> tight<00:04:25.290> your<00:04:25.530> phone's

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
holds in pretty tight your phone's

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.650 
holds in pretty tight your phone's
really<00:04:26.100> not<00:04:26.250> coming<00:04:26.550> loose<00:04:26.880> at<00:04:27.090> all

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
really not coming loose at all

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.350 
really not coming loose at all
and<00:04:28.050> then<00:04:28.170> you<00:04:28.260> do<00:04:28.380> have<00:04:28.560> access<00:04:28.770> to<00:04:29.250> like<00:04:30.240> on

for what this is in a nutshell it does a
really<00:04:47.340> good<00:04:47.580> job<00:04:47.640> this<00:04:48.240> is<00:04:48.390> basically<00:04:48.780> for

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
really good job this is basically for

you a larger screen or at least the

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:56.840 
you a larger screen or at least the
feeling<00:04:55.740> of<00:04:55.860> a<00:04:55.950> larger<00:04:56.280> screen<00:04:56.490> just<00:04:56.760> by

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:56.850 
feeling of a larger screen just by

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:58.580 
feeling of a larger screen just by
looking<00:04:57.300> in<00:04:57.390> there<00:04:57.540> all<00:04:57.780> it<00:04:57.990> really<00:04:58.170> does<00:04:58.290> is

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
looking in there all it really does is

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:02.090 
looking in there all it really does is
magnifies<00:04:59.160> your<00:04:59.550> screen<00:05:00.450> it<00:05:00.690> does<00:05:01.530> not<00:05:01.740> do<00:05:01.890> any

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:02.100 
magnifies your screen it does not do any

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:04.490 
magnifies your screen it does not do any
virtual<00:05:02.460> reality<00:05:03.030> whatsoever<00:05:03.210> I<00:05:03.780> found<00:05:04.290> it<00:05:04.410> a

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:04.500 
virtual reality whatsoever I found it a

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.590 
virtual reality whatsoever I found it a
bit<00:05:04.530> cumbersome<00:05:05.250> in<00:05:05.430> the<00:05:05.700> design<00:05:06.030> is<00:05:06.300> a<00:05:06.330> little

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:06.600 
bit cumbersome in the design is a little

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.770 
bit cumbersome in the design is a little
odd<00:05:06.810> but<00:05:07.110> other<00:05:07.710> than<00:05:07.920> that<00:05:08.330> it<00:05:09.330> does<00:05:09.510> what's

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:09.780 
odd but other than that it does what's

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:11.780 
odd but other than that it does what's
advertised<00:05:10.290> so<00:05:10.620> just<00:05:10.920> making<00:05:11.340> your<00:05:11.490> screen

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:11.790 
advertised so just making your screen

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:13.400 
advertised so just making your screen
bigger<00:05:11.970> do<00:05:12.210> not<00:05:12.360> expect<00:05:12.780> any<00:05:12.960> kind<00:05:13.200> of<00:05:13.230> virtual

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:13.410 
bigger do not expect any kind of virtual
