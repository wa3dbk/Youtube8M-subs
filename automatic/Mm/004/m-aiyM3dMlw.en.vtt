00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:15.210
 Service comes to the next party of the pec 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.400
 top left or the peg opening row 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:21.480
 x-mas christmas and so on 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.260
 fort mario today solid 24 december the 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.760
 means the video will be 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.990
 most likely on 25 december 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.539
 come out 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.680
 and yes I think that the first 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.269
 I liked both vehicles 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.790
 they are not high yet 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.140
 it is currently 12 o'clock 8 and 13 o'clock 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.930
 Watch the first video for today 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.540
 then switch to 15 20 17 or so that 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.129
 third the water is one 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.300
 a bit dangerous but that 's me 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.600
 No matter because we are back 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.950
 tuned 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.890
 with the new consequences that still have 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:50.840
 62 83 packs means we open this 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:53.579
 Follow 1 5k pack and eight of the seven 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.260
 airbags and we have the 13 dependent 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.460
 which will open because actually find 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.410
 I the relatively shit 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.030
 because I honestly said so far 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.930
 only nine players left and drawn 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.219
 that's not the meaning of the whole 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.899
 but of course it's one more 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.070
 think of space for new players 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.770
 I think that they are even better here 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.670
 but will see and I would say 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.530
 we can do five kp but that will be now 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:17.130
 so once again a card 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.659
 more so almost 13 cards as much 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.930
 chaos on the front and I hope so too 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:24.330
 falcao is in the back and we have from 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.890
 Okay okay well, according to kabeg work around 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.720
 1,000 coins and the expect children 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.369
 that's what mothers expect me to be 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.049
 not blue yellow that does not mean it 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.340
 be so bad contracts 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.070
 of course taken back and muriel 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.240
 gonalons surround bert or not at all 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.890
 I can not speak 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.750
 french last year an absolute 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.939
 monster this year is actually 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.869
 but not as strong as 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.579
 at least not again last year 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.140
 Teamorder on vacation 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.369
 honestly never played sees 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.229
 but not bad in itself and 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.920
 go 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:51.479
 that was just another one 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.130
 Silver necklace was absolutely not necessary 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.259
 but what the hell are we going to do 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.909
 Continue to the next pack and do it 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:00.780
 Now that is the first and now 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:04.020
 make 8 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.840
 good that the first and falcao we have 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.849
 on top of it just like again 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.110
 yoshida neatly brings her next 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.780
 not a new player that would be 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.370
 sad maybe it has uri or something 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.900
 her show is really new so i would 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.090
 I always look forward to a touri 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:21.090
 it is a dual chip that is for the 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.819
 At least that's ironic 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.860
 that I now reduce that from now 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:28.200
 that also means blue yellow already means 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.489
 said no matter then anyway 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.040
 not a bad start 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:33.330
 it is a rare player too 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.280
 actually that's pretty good for now 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.630
 money and letter course medium law warcraft 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.910
 that's what he's called anyway 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.680
 fast triple strong the shot goes 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.000
 ok if you have me as in 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:46.800
 form pulled back then but I believe 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.330
 Do not sell politics because he is leaving 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:52.650
 Not much anyway, but we do not care 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:54.480
 because he is young and wild and out of principle 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:58.410
 go to the next day with arturo vidal 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:00.930
 on the cover this was the second one 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.920
 pack and of course it would still be the 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.920
 hope that a good team until now 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:08.489
 remains the best samuel eto'o from the 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:12.930
 second part and this time it's ariola 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:15.180
 by athletic bilbao lafita from crete for 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.150
 noble from west ham and a few watts 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.989
 region to mexican trainer 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.250
 Of course, modification card is great 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:21.959
 if you have the old spectral 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.370
 I actually think you should 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:26.790
 always have a rare player that 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:29.220
 I think that would be fair 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.299
 cooler than always such a rare chance 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.280
 cards is worth nothing 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:34.140
 it can be natural that the rare 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.150
 But gold is still worth more 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.410
 as an ugly coach modification 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.209
 even if the mexican equals even 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:42.180
 which is worth to the Saudi Arabian 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:43.859
 riad mexico because they are not up front again 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.170
 needs to skip and we have 

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:49.560
 pulled back serve 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:52.170
 can on the bench we have indeed hype 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:58.680
 it is because of history with him 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:04:05.010
 I even think that it would be different 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:06.450
 stoke no heymann that again me 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.280
 Did not scare him 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.290
 I have no idea of ​​which club 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.540
 That was the recipe for this 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:16.290
 episode I know that this is now the 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:18.419
 fourth this moment yoshida right left 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:19.950
 would be a theory falcao right yoshida 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:22.260
 if parents radio ok when i go during 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:23.820
 vista the 13 objects pack last time 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.370
 Bringing luck to come this time as well 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.270
 it brings rossi that year 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.130
 is okay 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.479
 ranocchia and castle label 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.490
 could also go for a little something 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:33.540
 Rossi is also very strong 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:34.800
 This season is also a very good one 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:36.150
 player actually the information 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.229
 but not so good just 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.790
 because he was too weak 

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:39.750
 there was the new forms how clear 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:41.729
 better because he is a bit more 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.500
 Pushed yes what that was but should 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:46.979
 that just rocks by the way 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:49.950
 with pocher cinema where it is in the trainer 

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:51.060
 Well, what's up, ranocchia buys the 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:52.440
 no one can leave whenever the 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.120
 but really good in career mode 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:58.130
 So he has supposedly neat 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:05:02.280
 potential so now the fifth pack 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:03.930
 this episode and we still hope 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:05.280
 something good we still have nothing 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:06.690
 I think I'm not with you 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:10.550
 get in and every second something 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:14.340
 reasonable has but somehow ralf 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:18.120
 year 272 rarely even objects like that 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:19.410
 love yes that's really solemn then 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.640
 had to pack out the whole principle 

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:22.050
 Completion of all contracts and fitness 

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:23.000
 taker with kevin kuranyi but still 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:26.220
 drawn 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.900
 but that does not help anything that is 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:29.130
 twice as much money from the disq 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:31.410
 aden but I now want my pack with 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:34.710
 messi is open or goes with cars 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:38.450
 I would also have taken yoshida 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:42.030
 but next to that what is it now 66 

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:45.539
 that means here come two more and after 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:46.950
 come on falcao come on ok it 

00:05:45.539 --> 00:05:47.610
 is close to singhammer last episode too 

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:49.500
 already pulled 

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:50.850
 We also already pulled so 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.200
 we only ever play the players we 

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:54.030
 already had that is not good at 3 

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:56.400
 690 away shirt in the last episode 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:57.630
 already pulled one that is annoying always 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.639
 just to draw the same players 

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:01.200
 This time on is something new but the 

00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:04.979
 is with seat and he is honest 

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:05.700
 That's why I'm with it 

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:07.710
 not too 

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:10.410
 peace but alba wants the whole thing now 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:11.730
 set up some coins and we hope 

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:13.170
 we what reasonable goal I will 

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:20.460
 Something to drink by the way when you 're heating 

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:23.190
 interpack will rock well so the 

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:25.170
 penultimate and relate christian fuchs 

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:26.520
 before fax saic age that can not 

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:30.750
 that I really just shit here 

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:32.130
 make a goal next opec because 

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:34.170
 worse, it may not be so 

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:36.080
 I do not even mean a '70s 

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:38.280
 rarely there silva player 

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:43.250
 that is no longer possible yoshida 

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:43.250
 is on it and I turn around 

00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:04.600
 we pull esteban cambiasso and two 

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:09.370
 stadien abertausend coins lay anita and 

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:11.530
 the imtech-arena juhu but at least 

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:12.910
 rare gold player lex still 

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:14.380
 not reasonable and that's from 

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:15.730
 this episode we just shit 

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:17.290
 pulled but used to it 

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:18.760
 I still hope that you have this part 

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:20.280
 liked and that we at 

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:24.930
 see you again next time 

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:24.930
 I say goodbye until then skin
