 "Antioxidants in vegetable versus animal food" 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.506
 Last year they concluded in a review about health and vegetarianism, 

00:00:09.506 --> 00:00:13.506
 that there is sufficient scientific evidence to make policy, 

00:00:13.584 --> 00:00:16.584
 to promote a diet rich in vegetables for health. 

00:00:16.584 --> 00:00:21.375
 That does not have to wait until science has answered all the questions of why and how. 

00:00:21.571 --> 00:00:25.802
 But this is certainly one of the reasons. 

00:00:25.802 --> 00:00:30.938
 On average 64 times more antioxidant values â€‹â€‹in vegetable food than in animal food. 

00:00:30.938 --> 00:00:35.366
 But is this a fair comparison? 

00:00:35.366 --> 00:00:39.866
 There were things in the vegetable group that scored extremely high, 

00:00:40.044 --> 00:00:43.544
 like some exotic wild berries that you can't buy in the store. 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:46.756
 This gave a distorted picture in favor of the plants. 

00:00:46.756 --> 00:00:50.372
 People eat things like corn. 

00:00:50.372 --> 00:00:55.244
 They do not eat anything like dried Northern cornflowers. 

00:00:55.244 --> 00:00:57.680
 Let's look at it realistically. 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:03.880
 The average edible plant indeed has more than 1000 units of antioxidant value. 

00:01:04.034 --> 00:01:08.184
 But to be able to compare, to be honest with regard to animal food, 

00:01:08.346 --> 00:01:15.839
 I take the least healthy plant I can think of: that good, old iceberg lettuce. 

00:01:15.839 --> 00:01:19.269
 I think it's just water. 

00:01:19.269 --> 00:01:24.609
 It does not contain 1,157 units of antioxidant value. 

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:28.004
 It contains 17 units. 

00:01:28.004 --> 00:01:32.767
 Still better than fish, the average of which is 11 units. 

00:01:32.767 --> 00:01:37.211
 Salmon: 7 units. 

00:01:37.211 --> 00:01:41.530
 Chicken: 6 units. 

00:01:41.527 --> 00:01:46.770
 Iceberg contains almost three times as many antioxidants as chicken. 

00:01:46.774 --> 00:01:50.680
 A hard-boiled egg: 2 units. 

00:01:50.675 --> 00:01:56.400
 A protein: 0 units. 

00:01:56.378 --> 00:02:00.490
 Even Coca-Cola has 4 units. 

00:02:00.494 --> 00:02:05.190
 As much as cow's milk and yogurt. 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:10.190
 Although soy milk only has twice as much. 

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:14.230
 Edible plants have an average of 1000 units. 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:17.650
 The best animal product in the meat category, 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.000
 is a portion of beef liver, with 71 units. 

00:02:22.414 --> 00:02:26.980
 It defeated elk meat and reindeer steak. 

00:02:26.984 --> 00:02:32.170
 But just couldn't match the antioxidant value of: 

00:02:32.169 --> 00:02:34.840
 a Snickers. 

00:02:34.845 --> 00:02:39.800
 This is why we must eat a vegetable diet. 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.500
 Because even if you live on cattle livers, 

00:02:43.749 --> 00:02:46.300
 animal kingdom wild blueberry, 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:51.070
 one of the few animal products that could beat lettuce, 

00:02:51.066 --> 00:02:57.080
 then you still didn't get close to your daily need for antioxidants. 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:06.480
 However, there is one animal product that completely preserves the rest, with 200 units. 

00:03:06.664 --> 00:03:11.350
 There are even berries that didn't have that many antioxidants. 

00:03:11.346 --> 00:03:17.740
 An animal product that is so healthy that I encourage everyone to consume it ... 

00:03:17.736 --> 00:03:20.390
 if you are a baby. 

00:03:20.392 --> 00:03:24.340
 That is the antioxidant value of breastfeeding for people. 

00:03:24.335 --> 00:03:27.640
 The breast is best in childhood. 

00:03:27.734 --> 00:03:31.590
 Plants are preferred after childhood.
