00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:07.589
 Well , something beautiful shadow greenish gray 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:10.019
 asphalt shade from mac we are with you 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:13.950
 already watched antique diamond and now 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:16.710
 we start to look at the rouge rouge 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.490
 just shikdos on and so would say 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.710
 shikdos on and blush I bought them 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:25.500
 long ago probably 22 years ago 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.740
 or a half bought thought oh what roses 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.900
 Is the hive's ruddy so full a flower 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.180
 cucumber is really nothing like 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.460
 these blush have absolutely unreal 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.440
 too go too far it's not some know 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.989
 pink pigment is exactly pink 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.120
 rouge from the company overcoat which are not 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.570
 do you know bullshit she does very 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:50.460
 quality things with which 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.840
 difficult to do something carelessly 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.660
 but of course if you face it completely and 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.329
 there to hit them once and then yes but in general 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:00.289
 they are very delicate they 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:04.489
 baked such know solid rudiments 

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:06.780
 they are recruited quite difficult that is 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:09.950
 slowly slowly moving away 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.840
 Now I will try to show on the finger they 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.460
 even if you rub on the hand anyway from 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.100
 the color turns out about them barely barely 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.439
 notable such delicate some but it 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.619
 does not mean that they are not visible 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:25.290
 that they do not give effect do not give very 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:27.750
 beautiful effect I can fluff so 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.009
 a little bit before for that they need to be crushed 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.250
 because they say them again 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:35.310
 recruited long and I put them right here 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:42.000
 i don't mind them up i mean i like them 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:46.490
 here and a little bit here they give 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.860
 cool shade is for make up 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:53.040
 very business very cold not 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:56.130
 radiating from themselves some kind of enthusiasm not 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:59.399
 studying themselves some kind of straight 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:02.009
 fun is exactly such a thing 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.790
 classic something cold something 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.110
 business 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.110
 what is that here 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:13.569
 an adult would call these rouge adults 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:17.500
 them straight seen some severe 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:20.290
 style some kind of know everything is not 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:24.310
 add fan fan fan not fan absolutely 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:27.629
 he immediately we will tune in 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:30.040
 lyric more paws want to wear 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:35.049
 formal suit maybe or even 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:37.390
 dress but more serious is more adult 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:40.329
 a dress I would say so girls 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:42.519
 I probably would not recommend it at all 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:46.120
 young girls are so ruddy 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:49.420
 girls ask for 20 there are three four 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:52.450
 But at this age it is quite possible 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:54.670
 create images say again that these 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.489
 Rouge do not give almost exactly shade 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:00.010
 does not give some kind of internal glow but 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:02.590
 so you know right here that barely on the verge 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.829
 Anatoly is there is no shade 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:07.599
 there will be practically no such 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:10.450
 when there your skin just shines through 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:12.670
 I would say so, but I hope that you 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.799
 understood me and we will now move on to 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:18.760
 following products with my cosmetic bag is

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:25.299
 called perfect rouge

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:29.739
