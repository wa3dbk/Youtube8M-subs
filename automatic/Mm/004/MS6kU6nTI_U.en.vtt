part<00:00:24.539> this<00:00:24.779> is<00:00:24.960> what<00:00:25.109> we're<00:00:25.230> using<00:00:25.380> we<00:00:26.189> put<00:00:26.369> it

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
part this is what we're using we put it

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.279 
part this is what we're using we put it
in<00:00:26.550> a<00:00:26.580> small<00:00:26.820> bottle<00:00:27.210> like<00:00:27.359> this<00:00:27.390> and<00:00:27.930> it's

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
in a small bottle like this and it's

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.980 
in a small bottle like this and it's
much<00:00:28.439> easier<00:00:28.769> to<00:00:28.859> work<00:00:28.980> with<00:00:29.630> now<00:00:30.630> back<00:00:30.810> over

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
much easier to work with now back over

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.250 
much easier to work with now back over
here<00:00:31.260> with<00:00:31.439> our<00:00:31.590> furniture<00:00:33.050> we're<00:00:34.050> going<00:00:34.200> to

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
here with our furniture we're going to

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.910 
here with our furniture we're going to
cut<00:00:34.440> into<00:00:34.680> one<00:00:35.640> of<00:00:35.730> these<00:00:35.790> bubbles<00:00:36.829> with<00:00:37.829> the

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
cut into one of these bubbles with the

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:44.310 
cut into one of these bubbles with the
razor<00:00:38.129> blade

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:44.320 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.370 

making<00:00:45.070> it<00:00:45.160> a<00:00:45.190> little<00:00:45.280> incision<00:00:46.290> then<00:00:47.290> we're

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:47.380 
making it a little incision then we're

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.630 
making it a little incision then we're
gonna<00:00:47.470> go<00:00:47.560> to<00:00:47.620> our<00:00:47.680> glue<00:00:47.890> knife<00:00:50.520> we're<00:00:51.520> going

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:51.640 
gonna go to our glue knife we're going

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.960 
gonna go to our glue knife we're going
to<00:00:51.700> open<00:00:51.850> up<00:00:52.150> that<00:00:52.300> crack<00:00:53.640> squirt<00:00:54.640> some<00:00:54.760> glue

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:54.970 
to open up that crack squirt some glue

00:00:54.970 --> 00:01:01.229 
to open up that crack squirt some glue
in<00:00:55.150> there<00:00:55.980> all<00:00:56.980> along<00:00:57.490> the<00:00:57.640> crack<00:00:59.250> and<00:01:00.250> then

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:01.239 
in there all along the crack and then

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:07.460 
in there all along the crack and then
work<00:01:01.480> it<00:01:01.600> in<00:01:01.720> with<00:01:01.810> a<00:01:01.900> knife

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.830 

push<00:01:08.100> it<00:01:08.250> back<00:01:08.280> as<00:01:08.580> far<00:01:08.610> as<00:01:08.850> you<00:01:09.000> can<00:01:09.240> back<00:01:09.480> into

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
push it back as far as you can back into

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.610 
push it back as far as you can back into
the<00:01:09.960> seems<00:01:11.540> to<00:01:12.540> feel<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:12.960> edge<00:01:13.050> of<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.260> bubble

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:15.620 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.600 

once<00:01:16.620> you<00:01:16.710> think<00:01:16.860> you've<00:01:17.040> got<00:01:17.190> it<00:01:17.310> good<00:01:17.460> enough

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
once you think you've got it good enough

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:18.860 
once you think you've got it good enough
you<00:01:17.850> can<00:01:17.970> see<00:01:18.090> it<00:01:18.180> coming<00:01:18.300> out<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.450> crack<00:01:18.720> on

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:18.870 
you can see it coming out the crack on

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:21.860 
you can see it coming out the crack on
the<00:01:18.960> other<00:01:19.110> side<00:01:20.450> we're<00:01:21.450> going<00:01:21.540> to<00:01:21.660> use<00:01:21.750> our

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:21.870 
the other side we're going to use our

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:31.360 
the other side we're going to use our
wet<00:01:22.290> rag<00:01:22.470> course<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:22.980> clean<00:01:23.460> off<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.730> excess

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:31.370 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:35.600 

we<00:01:32.370> want<00:01:32.550> to<00:01:32.610> even<00:01:32.760> work<00:01:32.940> it<00:01:33.090> out<00:01:33.210> -<00:01:34.460> you<00:01:35.460> don't

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
we want to even work it out - you don't

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.570 
we want to even work it out - you don't
want<00:01:35.880> a<00:01:35.940> big<00:01:36.150> bubble<00:01:36.360> of<00:01:36.570> glue<00:01:36.780> in<00:01:37.020> there<00:01:37.580> so

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:38.580 
want a big bubble of glue in there so

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.370 
want a big bubble of glue in there so
when<00:01:38.700> you<00:01:38.760> clamp<00:01:38.970> it<00:01:39.120> down<00:01:39.150> it<00:01:39.540> won't<00:01:39.690> sit<00:01:40.229> down

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
when you clamp it down it won't sit down

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.580 
when you clamp it down it won't sit down
smooth<00:01:41.390> so<00:01:42.390> get<00:01:42.540> as<00:01:42.630> much<00:01:42.840> as<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.080> excess<00:01:43.410> out

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
smooth so get as much as the excess out

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.920 
smooth so get as much as the excess out
as<00:01:43.770> you<00:01:43.860> can<00:01:44.070> just<00:01:44.369> push<00:01:44.610> it<00:01:44.640> on<00:01:44.820> push<00:01:45.810> it

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
as you can just push it on push it

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:56.180 
as you can just push it on push it
through<00:01:46.050> and<00:01:46.290> push<00:01:46.470> it<00:01:46.619> out
