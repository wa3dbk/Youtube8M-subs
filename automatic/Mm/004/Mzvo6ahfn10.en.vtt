00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.310 
blades basically just take your your
wire<00:02:21.070> your<00:02:21.460> four<00:02:21.700> inch<00:02:21.730> wire<00:02:22.060> form<00:02:22.450> take<00:02:23.290> a

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
wire your four inch wire form take a

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.100 
wire your four inch wire form take a
cleave<00:02:23.710> as'<00:02:23.890> and<00:02:24.220> take<00:02:24.610> the<00:02:24.790> blade<00:02:25.210> with<00:02:25.510> the

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
cleave as' and take the blade with the

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:31.640 
cleave as' and take the blade with the
curbside<00:02:26.290> out<00:02:27.300> slide<00:02:28.300> this<00:02:28.630> onto<00:02:30.030> the<00:02:31.030> shaft

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
curbside out slide this onto the shaft

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.820 
curbside out slide this onto the shaft
and<00:02:33.330> then<00:02:34.330> you<00:02:34.900> just<00:02:35.110> start<00:02:35.290> playing<00:02:35.530> around

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
and then you just start playing around

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.010 
and then you just start playing around
with<00:02:36.070> different<00:02:36.130> beads<00:02:36.700> and<00:02:37.120> and<00:02:37.390> weights<00:02:37.780> and

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020 
with different beads and and weights and

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:39.960 
with different beads and and weights and
stuff<00:02:38.110> like<00:02:38.380> that<00:02:38.590> and<00:02:38.800> I<00:02:39.220> tend<00:02:39.670> to<00:02:39.730> like<00:02:39.910> the

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
stuff like that and I tend to like the

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.050 
stuff like that and I tend to like the
lures<00:02:40.360> a<00:02:40.450> little<00:02:40.750> bit<00:02:40.870> heavier<00:02:41.200> so<00:02:41.730> I'll<00:02:42.730> throw

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
lures a little bit heavier so I'll throw

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:49.610 
lures a little bit heavier so I'll throw
a<00:02:43.090> few<00:02:43.330> beads<00:02:43.600> on<00:02:43.870> here<00:02:44.230> different<00:02:44.590> sizes<00:02:45.780> and

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:55.680 

it's<00:02:50.620> really<00:02:50.860> simple<00:02:51.190> I<00:02:53.610> kind<00:02:54.610> of<00:02:54.700> like<00:02:54.910> two<00:02:55.570> of

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
it's really simple I kind of like two of

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:56.460 
it's really simple I kind of like two of
the<00:02:55.750> bigger<00:02:55.959> beads

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
the bigger beads

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.770 
the bigger beads
I<00:02:56.820> don't<00:02:57.820> know<00:02:57.880> haven't<00:02:58.180> even<00:02:58.240> tried<00:02:58.480> them<00:02:58.660> yet

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
I don't know haven't even tried them yet

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.350 
I don't know haven't even tried them yet
but<00:02:59.050> that<00:02:59.890> seems<00:03:00.400> like<00:03:00.640> it's<00:03:00.850> about<00:03:00.970> the<00:03:01.180> same

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
but that seems like it's about the same

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.040 
but that seems like it's about the same
way<00:03:01.570> as<00:03:01.780> my<00:03:01.930> trusty<00:03:02.350> Panther<00:03:02.709> Martin<00:03:03.070> so<00:03:04.050> at

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.050 
way as my trusty Panther Martin so at

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.140 
way as my trusty Panther Martin so at
the<00:03:05.200> end<00:03:05.350> I'm<00:03:05.680> going<00:03:05.830> to<00:03:05.920> put<00:03:06.130> another<00:03:06.550> beat

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
the end I'm going to put another beat

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.240 
the end I'm going to put another beat
I'm<00:03:07.300> going<00:03:07.420> to<00:03:07.480> try<00:03:07.630> one<00:03:07.810> of<00:03:07.840> these<00:03:08.250> crystal

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
I'm going to try one of these crystal

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:14.550 
I'm going to try one of these crystal
ball<00:03:09.400> jobbies<00:03:10.000> and<00:03:11.160> then<00:03:12.160> all<00:03:12.370> I<00:03:12.400> do<00:03:12.580> is<00:03:13.560> over

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
ball jobbies and then all I do is over

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:20.370 
ball jobbies and then all I do is over
here<00:03:14.920> on<00:03:15.580> my<00:03:15.870> vise<00:03:18.030> I<00:03:19.030> take<00:03:19.780> this<00:03:19.930> little<00:03:20.200> pair

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
here on my vise I take this little pair

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.750 
here on my vise I take this little pair
of<00:03:20.470> pliers<00:03:20.739> and<00:03:21.160> I<00:03:21.459> go<00:03:21.700> about<00:03:21.970> a<00:03:22.330> quarter<00:03:23.170> inch

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
of pliers and I go about a quarter inch

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.840 
of pliers and I go about a quarter inch
down<00:03:25.200> take<00:03:26.200> the<00:03:26.320> virus<00:03:26.590> plier<00:03:27.370> so<00:03:27.580> I<00:03:27.610> can<00:03:27.730> get<00:03:27.820> a

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:27.850 
down take the virus plier so I can get a

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:31.110 
down take the virus plier so I can get a
good<00:03:28.090> grip<00:03:28.270> and<00:03:28.540> with<00:03:29.500> my<00:03:29.820> super<00:03:30.820> expensive

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
good grip and with my super expensive

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.949 
good grip and with my super expensive
wire<00:03:31.690> former<00:03:32.200> I<00:03:32.350> just<00:03:32.650> pull<00:03:32.980> a<00:03:33.010> tight<00:03:33.400> loop

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
wire former I just pull a tight loop

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:36.449 
wire former I just pull a tight loop
pull<00:03:34.959> it<00:03:35.080> over<00:03:35.260> so<00:03:35.769> it's<00:03:35.890> about<00:03:36.040> a<00:03:36.070> ninety

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
pull it over so it's about a ninety

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:39.420 
pull it over so it's about a ninety
degree<00:03:37.230> so<00:03:38.230> that's<00:03:38.440> that's<00:03:38.799> all<00:03:38.980> that<00:03:39.130> I<00:03:39.160> have

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
degree so that's that's all that I have

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.199 
degree so that's that's all that I have
right<00:03:39.640> here<00:03:39.880> I've<00:03:40.480> got<00:03:40.720> a<00:03:40.750> little<00:03:42.000> little<00:03:43.000> loop

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:43.209 
right here I've got a little little loop

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:46.770 
right here I've got a little little loop
that<00:03:43.799> I've<00:03:44.799> pulled<00:03:45.130> over<00:03:45.580> around<00:03:46.390> the<00:03:46.540> nail

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
that I've pulled over around the nail

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.430 
that I've pulled over around the nail
I'm<00:03:47.739> going<00:03:47.890> to<00:03:47.950> take<00:03:48.190> one<00:03:48.580> of<00:03:48.610> my<00:03:49.170> my<00:03:50.170> little

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
I'm going to take one of my my little

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.680 
I'm going to take one of my my little
treble<00:03:50.680> hooks<00:03:51.010> like<00:03:51.400> I<00:03:51.549> said<00:03:51.790> these<00:03:51.940> are<00:03:52.000> VMC

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
treble hooks like I said these are VMC

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:58.039 
treble hooks like I said these are VMC
trouble<00:03:53.049> looks<00:03:55.200> thread<00:03:56.200> it<00:03:56.290> on<00:03:56.440> and<00:03:56.709> around

really put a good grip on it and then

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.600 
really put a good grip on it and then
I'm<00:04:07.090> going<00:04:07.209> to<00:04:07.269> take<00:04:07.540> this<00:04:07.780> and<00:04:08.170> do<00:04:08.650> a<00:04:08.920> loop<00:04:09.430> and

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:09.610 
I'm going to take this and do a loop and

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:12.090 
I'm going to take this and do a loop and
a<00:04:09.700> half<00:04:09.880> and<00:04:10.150> try<00:04:10.269> to<00:04:10.360> do<00:04:10.540> a<00:04:10.570> real<00:04:11.080> super<00:04:11.860> tight

I've got an Indiana blade custom spinner
that<00:04:42.770> took<00:04:43.770> me<00:04:43.889> about<00:04:44.870> 30<00:04:45.870> seconds<00:04:46.410> to<00:04:46.530> make

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 
that took me about 30 seconds to make
