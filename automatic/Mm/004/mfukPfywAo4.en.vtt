storage<00:00:21.359> stick<00:00:21.660> review<00:00:21.810> and<00:00:22.230> wonder<00:00:22.769> why<00:00:22.920> it

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
storage stick review and wonder why it

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.349 
storage stick review and wonder why it
is<00:00:23.359> so<00:00:24.359> it's<00:00:25.080> a<00:00:25.289> measurement<00:00:26.160> transform<00:00:27.119> tool

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
is so it's a measurement transform tool

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.410 
is so it's a measurement transform tool
