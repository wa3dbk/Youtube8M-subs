00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:23.279
 tells crowd beauty and returning to full 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.169
 require you 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.230
 and today we are going to talk about a new game 

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:31.439
 closed beta of net mail games is the 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.239
 district 187 as the game had said 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.280
 is still in cosby beta phase 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.410
 So for you to play it will have to 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.060
 Browse websites that distribute 15 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.160
 free for you to play 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:43.440
 This game will try to make the most of 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.420
 sites that I find in the description of the 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.890
 video and just follow the steps that you 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.760
 made the complaints to make the 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.010
 download 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.170
 but before you start the right video only 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.270
 to make it clear the game left some 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.430
 days I've seen some people videos 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.950
 making people I know 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.530
 so this is not imitation is not stealing 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:03.090
 content is to steal anyone's idea until 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.090
 because each one has its own content 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:09.060
 your way said piu on the right channel 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.729
 so come on now talking about the 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.640
 game as incredible as it seems it has 580 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.720
 megas and has a very good group that does not 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.520
 it's heavy 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.940
 at least in my average psyche to 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:24.720
 games he turned smooth for 100 feet in the 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:26.159
 resolution 1280 by 720 with shadow for 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.680
 who does not really understand how to run a 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.270
 game book without reading the pc it make a 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.130
 video explaining how to leave the chart 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.590
 is not just waiting there for us to 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.460
 next videos go to a video about 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.530
 that 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.240
 continuing the game there are few doctors 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.790
 but it looks like it will be a game 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.710
 after leaving the beta phase and a few months 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.540
 making tests and updates for 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.060
 put what is still missing in the game that 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.770
 you should probably be logged in and 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.140
 company that paid attention to the game is 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.060
 such as the 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.070
 creating a practice room does not work 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.110
 is still another one when you 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.479
 choose the type of water to play not 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.520
 only water of that category appears 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.049
 the pomegranate knife also by 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.369
 example if you choose a riff to 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:10.379
 play will not appear only the rich type 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:11.819
 akm-47 I will not show up just this vai 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:14.219
 appear the others also house 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.980
 than the pistol and the others that 

00:02:14.219 --> 00:02:17.890
 O 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.450
 that the knife renato because you think you have 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.890
 how do you choose a new type of water 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.540
 What do you want to install? 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.690
 so there does not have to be other areas 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.970
 only that kind then I believe that 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.319
 should be tidied up and also now 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.180
 they released the other secondary ones 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:31.780
 so the scheme they set up is 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.099
 wrong 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.650
 one of the coolest points that control 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:37.450
 of the game was to pull the disk that everyone 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.170
 who played palm hearts knows what it is 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.569
 talking right? 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.310
 I remember xix coop so you can do it 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:45.010
 game also get into one of my 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.780
 coming videos making it clear here 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.879
 I did not see anyone talking about what they do. 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.959
 in this game but I'm still 

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:52.390
 leaving the idea 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:54.670
 continuing game playability is well 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.319
 cool looking a bit against the fps that 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:59.260
 we already know, for example, the 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:01.120
 fire bat ayin waring just do not go 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.650
 say that the game has less to 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.840
 gameplay that they 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.760
 it just seems a little but it's not clear 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.709
 as the game is still in the thing 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.930
 beta has a lot to say about 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:12.549
 the game are still released few 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.359
 weapons for you to have fun with 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:15.430
 players 

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:17.470
 little use of clothes but in 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.780
 coming updates may well be 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:22.419
 stages both for the team of 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:25.269
 gangsters with part of their art that are 

00:03:22.419 --> 00:03:27.310
 only two game teams some maps 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:29.889
 to be played and particularly 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.910
 are good and no bugs at least I do not 

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:32.919
 I found none 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:35.019
 the only thing that intrigues me in this game 

00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:36.880
 It's what people do if you do not understand 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:38.859
 I'll still try to explain to you. 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.769
 come on get the process several states 

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:43.599
 united the call of duty black shot these 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:46.000
 three games I believe 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:48.790
 there is a mechanism for them the rite 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.430
 iguatemi jose from where the shot you 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.799
 pings independently ping your opponent 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.780
 normally damages the end of the 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:58.660
 Brazilians with a reasonable internet of 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.639
 two meters for example is up to 70 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:03.549
 When you play outside your Brazilian 

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:06.160
 pib is between 130 and 150 independent of 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:07.510
 your child's person and about 50 or even 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.030
 even 900 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:12.870
 in these games that have 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:15.510
 hit is thanou but district there is not 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.910
 delay a delay for those who do not know the 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:19.109
 issue of character movement 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:20.519
 opponents to better understand 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:22.980
 suppose you see the enemy 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:25.139
 passing a corridor and you shot him 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:27.570
 where he walked slowly to the left 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:29.490
 its probably 300 pce of five 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:30.270
 shots you hit the government 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:33.540
 surface 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:36.360
 one of them you were total this is because 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:38.310
 the law range from the peak because 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.200
 when did you see your name passing by ? 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:42.660
 was well ahead a few meters 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:44.730
 from there on his computer and ping 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:46.620
 showed delay so many call 

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:49.020
 this fake it where you get 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:51.570
 practically a ghost and he not only 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.440
 getting so why did not occur 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:54.900
 stay pace 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:57.090
 I try to play against Brazilians or 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:59.040
 always try to get in the head in the 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:59.820
 Opponent characters move to 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.620
 the sides 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:04.110
 if it comes different you probably 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:06.060
 You kill is easy, so people are going 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:08.580
 staying here maybe he stayed 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:10.710
 I do not know how much he got out here 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:11.790
 wanted to spend some time impressions 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:14.070
 that I played this game 

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:16.200
 in the beginning it was difficult to take but for whom 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:18.479
 played eight years straight fs until I already 

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:20.910
 I used to play it was a comment more 

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:23.580
 Staff here play from 12 in this game is 

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:25.950
 very good although you have to be the 2 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:27.600
 3 x 1 to such face if face and aids 

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:29.460
 You kill yourself and it's easy. 

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:31.440
 I just had to be logical, too. 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:34.260
 12 has a much bigger giving 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:34.979
 usually a shot to a video at home 

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.419
 for silver 

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:38.520
 finally guys the video is staying for 

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:40.200
 here if you liked everything I said 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:42.690
 that if you think this information 

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:44.130
 It was good for you, it was good for you. 

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:46.500
 of that joinha to help in the divulgation 

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:48.510
 My job is not for viruses, it's not 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:49.440
 prolix does not only apply to 

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:50.880
 recognition 

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:53.729
 If you do not like it too you can 

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:55.200
 comment below because one stroke 

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:57.270
 idea to know what I did of 

00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:00.330
 wrong in the video be sure to access the 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:02.520

 video also shows your videos to pay 

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:22.080
 it was the right life for anyone who wants to play 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:24.270
 with me inside the game and only 

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.980
 pentagrams the only one besides the game 

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:27.270
 I usually play a game with 

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:30.030
 the staff was chosen because the 

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:30.600
 mafia the guiga oms everson and some 

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:35.660
 others 

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:35.660
 So that's it , people said even more.
