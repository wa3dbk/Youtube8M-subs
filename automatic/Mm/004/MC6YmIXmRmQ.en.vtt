00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
so now the artisans are living this

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.240 
so now the artisans are living this

now<00:03:41.610> we're<00:03:41.850> just<00:03:42.030> topping<00:03:42.390> out<00:03:42.540> back<00:03:42.780> so<00:03:44.060> the

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
now we're just topping out back so the

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:46.790 
now we're just topping out back so the
chemical<00:03:45.480> process<00:03:45.960> is<00:03:46.170> under<00:03:46.440> waiting

continuous<00:03:48.290> be<00:03:49.290> able<00:03:49.530> to<00:03:49.620> get<00:03:49.830> the<00:03:49.980> mold<00:03:50.160> then

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
continuous be able to get the mold then

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.600 
continuous be able to get the mold then
that's<00:03:51.840> why<00:03:52.050> adjustment<00:03:52.800> of<00:03:52.950> the<00:03:53.040> catalog<00:03:53.460> can

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
that's why adjustment of the catalog can

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.430 
that's why adjustment of the catalog can
be<00:03:53.880> important<00:03:54.420> to<00:03:54.510> give<00:03:54.660> you<00:03:54.780> a<00:03:54.810> round<00:03:55.020> longer

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
be important to give you a round longer

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:10.250 
move so with coordinated efforts one of

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:11.589 
move so with coordinated efforts one of
the<00:05:10.310> most<00:05:10.460> important<00:05:10.939> things<00:05:11.060> in<00:05:11.270> founded

00:05:11.589 --> 00:05:11.599 
the most important things in founded

00:05:11.599 --> 00:05:16.659 
the most important things in founded
work<00:05:11.750> in<00:05:11.930> making<00:05:12.139> moles<00:05:15.490> safety<00:05:16.490> is<00:05:16.550> very

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:16.669 
work in making moles safety is very

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:18.640 
work in making moles safety is very
important<00:05:17.150> especially<00:05:17.629> with<00:05:18.020> chemicals<00:05:18.529> the

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:18.650 
important especially with chemicals the

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:20.740 
important especially with chemicals the
gloves<00:05:18.919> are<00:05:19.339> hazardous<00:05:20.029> and<00:05:20.180> we<00:05:20.300> always<00:05:20.449> make

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:20.750 
gloves are hazardous and we always make

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:24.369 
gloves are hazardous and we always make
sure<00:05:20.900> people<00:05:21.139> are<00:05:21.199> wearing<00:05:21.409> gloves<00:05:23.379> so

00:05:24.369 --> 00:05:24.379 
sure people are wearing gloves so

00:05:24.379 --> 00:05:26.170 
sure people are wearing gloves so
wonderful<00:05:24.800> maybe<00:05:24.979> work<00:05:25.279> with<00:05:25.310> one<00:05:25.759> reason<00:05:26.089> we

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:26.180 
wonderful maybe work with one reason we

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:28.959 
wonderful maybe work with one reason we
like<00:05:26.389> this<00:05:26.599> this<00:05:27.589> mold<00:05:27.919> material<00:05:28.099> has<00:05:28.639> a<00:05:28.669> long

00:05:28.959 --> 00:05:28.969 
like this this mold material has a long

00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:29.890 
like this this mold material has a long
shelf<00:05:29.360> life

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:29.900 
shelf life

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:31.869 
shelf life
the<00:05:30.469> chemicals<00:05:30.949> hold<00:05:31.189> up<00:05:31.370> weld<00:05:31.580> in<00:05:31.789> the

00:05:31.869 --> 00:05:31.879 
the chemicals hold up weld in the

00:05:31.879 --> 00:05:35.439 
the chemicals hold up weld in the
bottles<00:05:32.210> and<00:05:32.479> also<00:05:33.229> we<00:05:34.039> can<00:05:34.219> have<00:05:34.430> once<00:05:35.330> we

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:35.449 
bottles and also we can have once we

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:37.329 
bottles and also we can have once we
make<00:05:35.750> the<00:05:35.960> molds<00:05:36.379> the<00:05:36.500> molds<00:05:36.889> have<00:05:37.039> a<00:05:37.099> long

00:05:37.329 --> 00:05:37.339 
make the molds the molds have a long

00:05:37.339 --> 00:05:43.029 
make the molds the molds have a long
shelf<00:05:37.610> life<00:05:38.199> so<00:05:39.199> one<00:05:39.379> shot<00:05:39.649> system<00:05:41.080> and<00:05:42.080> the

00:05:43.029 --> 00:05:43.039 
shelf life so one shot system and the

00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:45.550 
shelf life so one shot system and the
mold<00:05:43.219> waste<00:05:43.580> is<00:05:43.939> if<00:05:44.360> we've<00:05:44.569> been<00:05:44.599> checked<00:05:45.379> out

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:45.560 
mold waste is if we've been checked out

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:48.730 
mold waste is if we've been checked out
done<00:05:46.509> testing<00:05:47.509> through<00:05:47.810> laboratories<00:05:48.469> and

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:48.740 
done testing through laboratories and

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:52.209 
done testing through laboratories and
it's<00:05:49.039> certified<00:05:49.639> for<00:05:50.060> normal<00:05:50.569> land<00:05:50.810> field<00:05:51.219> the

00:05:52.209 --> 00:05:52.219 
it's certified for normal land field the

00:05:52.219 --> 00:05:53.950 
it's certified for normal land field the
main<00:05:52.430> hazard<00:05:52.969> with<00:05:53.120> the<00:05:53.210> chemicals<00:05:53.689> is<00:05:53.810> in

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:53.960 
main hazard with the chemicals is in

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:57.189 
main hazard with the chemicals is in
their<00:05:54.110> raw<00:05:54.319> pure<00:05:54.620> forms<00:05:55.300> but<00:05:56.300> once<00:05:56.509> these<00:05:56.750> got

00:05:57.189 --> 00:05:57.199 
their raw pure forms but once these got

00:05:57.199 --> 00:05:59.139 
their raw pure forms but once these got
sand<00:05:57.589> between<00:05:57.770> him<00:05:58.099> and<00:05:58.219> the<00:05:58.279> reaction<00:05:58.759> has

00:05:59.139 --> 00:05:59.149 
sand between him and the reaction has

00:05:59.149 --> 00:06:03.339 
sand between him and the reaction has
gone<00:05:59.360> out<00:05:59.599> they're<00:06:00.379> fairly<00:06:00.680> inert<00:06:01.629> so<00:06:02.629> we<00:06:03.139> like

00:06:03.339 --> 00:06:03.349 
gone out they're fairly inert so we like

00:06:03.349 --> 00:06:05.769 
gone out they're fairly inert so we like
new<00:06:03.620> in<00:06:03.740> these<00:06:03.830> presentations<00:06:04.610> and<00:06:04.819> we<00:06:05.569> want

00:06:05.769 --> 00:06:05.779 
new in these presentations and we want

00:06:05.779 --> 00:06:08.050 
new in these presentations and we want
to<00:06:05.870> continue<00:06:06.169> sort<00:06:06.770> short<00:06:07.279> subjects<00:06:07.909> a

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:08.060 
to continue sort short subjects a

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:10.929 
to continue sort short subjects a
foundry<00:06:08.870> work<00:06:09.399> hope<00:06:10.399> you<00:06:10.580> find<00:06:10.759> them

00:06:10.929 --> 00:06:10.939 
foundry work hope you find them

00:06:10.939 --> 00:06:23.820 
foundry work hope you find them
interesting<00:06:12.189> thank<00:06:13.189> you

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:23.830
