 a third position jacques football 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.159
 without all of them on the ground to roll 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.360
 that's what makes success for 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.450
 the moment of this escape 8 seconds 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:30.200

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:37.409
 sfr I pour a little bit and yes john 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.150
 degenkolb can not find a pipeline 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.520

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.780
 getyns and that and look ahead and we 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.950
 the fact of a sick person always rolls 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.850

 jump a relay he is 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.610
 saw that the sanguine and longueuil needed 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.950
 start to look at each other because 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.429
 that there they can lose everything in 300 or 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.860
 400 meters stage and general 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:12.120
 behind and where we are the squad is this 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.790
 that we are getting closer or 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.920
 not at the time google knew that it's going 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.510
