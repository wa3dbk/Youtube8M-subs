00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 hi this is by koito kids 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.089
 today's video unpacking the cros 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.589
 school then explore cros school is a 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.750
 mark that I never have the opportunity to 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.190
 present yourself until today to 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.719
 because it's a brand that relatively 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.429
 little known on the market in any case the 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.170
 hexagonal market that's a certainty 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.520
 so it's a brand that has the 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.680
 feature of making mobiles 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.090
 solid or in any case at least hardened 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.310
 are phones that are supposedly 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.199
 resistant to fall resistant in pro 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.710
 shock resistant to water to dust 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.630
 etc. 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.890
 there we are on a phone that is so 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.439
 actually resistant and that is 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.090
 normed ip54 which means who is 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.739
 water resistant to dust in 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.670
 some extent and we will see this 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.960
 that it is precisely 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.190
 since today we are on the video 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.420
 unpacking george and avoid 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.640
 today to throw phone by 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.350
 earth to see if it holds up I 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.180
 might do it maybe it's maybe yes 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.570
 this may be the case in another 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.719
 video 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.800
 after the test video but that's it for 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.500
 today we are just on a video 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.420
 unpacking then video unpacking the 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.920
 cros cole explore a mobile that I'm 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.690
 am supplying myself since 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.660
 must say I have even released my 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.859
 little blue card to buy it 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.910
 because the roscoe brand is not 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.930
 necessarily a brand that lends its 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.460
 mobile I think besides that the 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.260
 cros press service was not super 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.970
 super develop I have not even tried to 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.590
 truth to say I am directly go through 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.270
 the box the box purchase 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.200
 it's part of the few copies 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.610
 that I buy regularly for 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.860
 precisely you introduce them and well 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.080
 so here is the cros school explored well 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.790
 in a box we will say in the format 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.680
 classic we will come back on this water 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.090
 visuals of phase 2 the box and well 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.710
 necessarily visual two sides of the mobile 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.210
 notice there for once the screens 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.680
 misleading to itself even finally what it is 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.820
 really there the interest of this phone 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.950
 to have a beautiful image 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.200
 we will talk about the model again 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.369
 to explore it is the color cros 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.530
 the model explore is the model the 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.500
 more entry-level at cros coll it 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.299
 is named it is standardized pardon ip54 he 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.049
 is waterproof we'll see exactly what he 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.909
 is 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.340
 the double sim is the particularity it 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.590
 has a radio fm and a good neck ok 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.990
 the choker and was selling as a 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.100
 strong argument ok okay on the side 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.690
 left of the box goes exactly the 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.310
 same elements that are icons 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.200
 who put German in front of his 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.550
 famous strong elements like on the 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.290
 above the box on the side of the 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.720
 drive serial number and is on 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.800
 above and below the box we have this 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.840
 what's in the box 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.760
 and then some quick specs 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.660
 of the phone to know that he has a screen 

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:14.640
 who makes 1 8 inches tft he weighs 77 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.260
 cave so it's light 4 hours 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.170
 of autonomy in calls a battery 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.180
 li-ion of 800 million father afraid who 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.590
 can stand 192 hours in stand by on 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.180
 will see what it is I will do it I will 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.500
 would do just land does not turn is in 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.550
 stand-by in any case I would leave in 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:26.850
 stand by to see about autonomy 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.300
 real 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.740
 it's a 900 michael 900 900 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.590
 that every quine and homeland bandits co2 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:37.500
 big island and two-eyed it is hyper 54 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.790
 So waterproof waterproof bah 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.080
 yeah that's it's just that there is not 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.090
 dustproof but finally good on 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.810
 it's a little bit 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.360
 even to dust 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.590
 so if i unpack the phone that this 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.970
 that I find in the boiboite goes he 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.500
 even ends up the phone so for 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.870
 info there was no productions 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.820
 this good phone so there is no 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.140
 to give in to breaking the phone comes 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.870
 in a box and that's maybe 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.130
 open easily so here's 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.330
 phone a phone that actually 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.620
 is light I confirm it to you 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.170
 more than there the battery is surely 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.400
 not installed in the mobile so we 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.900
 note yes there are a number 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.640
 of elements on the sides that are there 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.110
 to probably protect the phone 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.410
 in case of fall and absorb shock 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:14.850
 ok this is a phone that uses 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.050
 a lot a lot of recycled materials 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.550
 in any case that's what the brand 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:18.420
 prides itself on those phones that 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:20.970
 use a lot of plastics 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.160
 recycled and that is necessarily good 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.090
 also to a certain extent 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.290
 recyclables so that's it's a 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.510
 phone that is really plastic 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.680
 the logo on the back right here bah Lille 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.390
 it's slightly increased it was in the 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.670
 phone is a logo stickers that 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.660
 was glued in ok ok a certain 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.160
 number of elements sees there there 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.269
 present not too bad we really see 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.250
 that it's a phone that does 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:39.900
 to resist is an aesthetic of 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.800
 solid phone ingredients we will see this 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.970
 what it really is is it 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.560
 really a solid phone that 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.650
 this will be the occasion of a test 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.600
 additional good is a small 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:51.989
 little little stickers and numbers 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.220
 ok series ok the foam that allows for 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:54.030
 allowed him to hold the phone 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.590
 in the box 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.690
 so what is found in the 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.340
 box then precisely the press comes back 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:01.080
 a little more galley so we find the 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.610
 pedestal that knew from cradles to 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.590
 inside the phone at the end of the 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.750
 box we find a small card that 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.710
 tell you 20 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:08.600
 it would be nice to register on 

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:09.860
 the lacrosse site sticks to validate 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.030
 your guarantee good know that you do not 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:12.920
 are not obliged in fact all the 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:14.450
 builders or 10 to do but 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:16.310
 finally no constructor holds 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:17.359
 account of this record or not so 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:17.930
 you never had to run 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:19.880
 your guarantee 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.470
 so we have a little cd good I guess 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.850
 precisely that to access the memory 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:26.000
 of the phone is precisely to be able to 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:27.140
 more gay things or other and even ben 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.880
 not at all it's a user guide 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:30.980
 to send it I was going to say that 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.960
 it was to interface the phone 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:36.440
 with his pc for example even by a single 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:38.090
 user guide all this format cd 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.860
 so the guide being these 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:42.500
 French English titles and top 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:46.880
 Spanish Portuguese German Italian 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:49.190
 Dutch and Turkish different languages 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:51.260
 so are that on this famous cds guide 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:52.640
 of use then we find when 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.680
 even a little guide is that which is 

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:57.530
 interesting waterproof mobile phones 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:58.730
 ip54 the builder is proud to say 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:59.960
 on that there is no problem but 

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:00.410
 besides this is the strong point of this 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.120
 phone 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:02.990
 it's his resistance so we see 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:03.740
 actually it's a little guide to 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:04.850
 Quick Start 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.530
 it is surely that it indicates a 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:09.350
 necessarily who tells you how to ensure 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:09.950
 the sim cards etc etc etc which is in 

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:13.070
 multilingual 

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:13.880
 So here is the earth first what is this 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:15.560
 that we find others well we 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:17.120
 found a small bag still lives 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:18.680
 globally for the chosen bull test 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.360
 know now in which one 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.669
 found a usb micro usb cable that 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:25.370
 allows charging and synchronization 

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:27.020
 there is a classic large pedestrian kit 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:28.880
 it's an obligation that is at 38 eur and 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:31.760
 commercial mines in France than 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:33.020
 give a pedestrian and for once with 

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:36.410
 hard plastic earphones 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:38.120
 as it should with the credit ctic and 

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:40.280
 quite special since we will use 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:41.510
 the micro usb and not 25 years older 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:43.820
 old since there is no jack 3.5 

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:45.200
 on this phone a small clip for 

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:47.450
 hang it with your lapel 

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:48.890
 shirts for example and the little button 

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:50.330
 it's off with the microphone because it's 

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:51.650
 of a couple and then have in the box 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:52.850
 people know it and sorry we find 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:54.500
 also and much foam 

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:55.610
 these are mosses that will surround 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:56.900
 headphones to make them maybe a 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:59.090
 little less aggressive when you 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:01.190
 will be good in reality this day of 

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:03.320
 mouth it works very very moderately 

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:04.430
 very very little in the end we expect the wrong 

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:06.350
 to the ears, I give you 

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:09.950
 legs were then all the battery 

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:10.310
 a drop of 0.3 and lions made in 

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:13.460
 China 

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:14.990
 ok big chill ok ok 

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:16.310
 the name makes me strangely think but 

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:18.530
 it's a parenthesis to a battery of 

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:19.550
 nokia but he is we will imagine that he 

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:20.900
 This is actually a battery 

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:22.130
 specific cros glue besides the 

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:22.610
 format is a bit special me 

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:25.190
 apparently it 

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:26.479
 ok okay here's a battery of 800 

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:27.860
 million father you see them all 

00:06:26.479 --> 00:06:29.509
 small necessarily but the phone does 

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:31.160
 must not be very energy intensive I imagine 

00:06:29.509 --> 00:06:33.319
 very small screen and that's it 

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:34.400
 high performance is not a 

00:06:33.319 --> 00:06:36.199
 smartphone I remind you it's a 

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:38.210
 entry -level phone that is 

00:06:36.199 --> 00:06:40.009
 solid inside the phone that 

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:42.169
 do we find in a small bag that 

00:06:40.009 --> 00:06:44.449
 contains the famous choker that is 

00:06:42.169 --> 00:06:46.400
 down among those whose builder is 

00:06:44.449 --> 00:06:48.229
 rightly on the packaging on the 

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.520
 icons that highlight the points 

00:06:48.229 --> 00:06:50.660
 strong, well, there's a choker 

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:52.190
 big cuil 

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:55.880
 it is good to publish it is well indicated 

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:56.840
 here is theo go ok what are we 

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:58.639
 found other seniors we find a 

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:59.810
 AC adapter as long as they are 

00:06:58.639 --> 00:07:02.330
 little bags are there for the shot 

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:05.000
 Thus, between the tear 

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:06.139
 this is classic AC adapter with 

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.659
 usb input 

00:07:06.139 --> 00:07:10.370
 so that's nothing more than amazing nothing 

00:07:08.659 --> 00:07:11.750
 really significant a small led 

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:12.949
 behind killer probably his light 

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:15.020
 red when your phone is in 

00:07:12.949 --> 00:07:17.150
 charge or more simply when 

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:19.460
 the AC adapter is plugged into the 

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:20.889
 plug and you find a 

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:23.870
 potting soil of the box small originality 

00:07:20.889 --> 00:07:25.550
 and well the sim card adapter 

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:27.050
 once you have a sim card format 

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:28.490
 micro and well you have to the adapter 

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:29.180
 to adapt to your formats we will say 

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:31.849
 classical 

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:33.440
 so that's enough provided with the 

00:07:31.849 --> 00:07:34.669
 phone so knowing that and this is the 

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:35.389
 special call as a 

00:07:34.669 --> 00:07:36.800
 double sim 

00:07:35.389 --> 00:07:38.719
 you mean that normally you would have 

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:40.340
 had to have two adapters for the shot 

00:07:38.719 --> 00:07:41.719
 you only have one but that's it 

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:43.009
 already a nice little note since 

00:07:41.719 --> 00:07:44.150
 it normally is not usually 

00:07:43.009 --> 00:07:46.610
 and provided that the phones but the 

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:47.060
 builder does not give gratos this is a 

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:49.190
 good point 

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:51.979
 then the bomb to listen to the cros 

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:54.440
 explores a hardened ip54 phone from 

00:07:51.979 --> 00:07:55.789
 water resistant and angel in a 

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:58.250
 to some extent we will see what is 

00:07:55.789 --> 00:07:59.719
 and then varenne to say other is a 

00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:01.400
 phone of which well you will have the 

00:07:59.719 --> 00:08:02.960
 test in a few days 

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:05.409
 Thank you for watching this video 

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:05.409
