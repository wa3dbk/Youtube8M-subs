00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:04.899
 hello in this tutorial we are going to teach you 

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:07.089
 to make paper hearts like 

00:00:04.899 --> 00:00:09.640
 this one we are going to use a folio 

00:00:07.089 --> 00:00:12.300
 white but you can do them with papers 

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:16.209
 of colors and they are very cute 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:18.039
 to begin with we are going to need a rule 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:22.109
 scissors 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:27.390
 and a pencil we're going to mark on a paper 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.390
 lines of one and a half centimeters 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.079
 first one side then the other 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.079
 we mark the lines 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:58.480
 this is to trim our strips of 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.480
 paper 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.329
 we cut the strips 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.840
 now let's take the strip and we're going to 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.840
 fold in half 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.690
 and now we fold it again by the 

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:31.310
 half 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.310
 let's mark the creases 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:38.670
 we unfolded and cut around the area 

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:38.670
 checked 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:54.880
 now we take one of the strips 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.229
 and we are going to take this tip from here to 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.920
 this side forming a triangle 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:58.920
 tiny 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.750
 when we already have the triangle formed 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.750
 we are going to fold it on itself 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:22.340
 and now again on this side 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.230
 about him 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.560
 we double again always following the 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.560
 line 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.220
 we doubled again 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:38.569
 note that the paper will take you 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.569
 where do you have to go 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:44.460
 when we get here we are going to cut 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.320
 this tip because you have to go into 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:49.050
 this piece that is left here remains as 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:51.630
 a little bag, then let's go 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:54.030
 cut out a piece of paper 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:57.730
 a corner 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:59.650
 we also cut a little bit from the other side 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:02.640
 and we do as one for this single 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.640
 for let's put here 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.540
 we double 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.010
 I'm afraid 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.650
 we push 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.290
 now we have a triangle this is what 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:27.890
 what are we going to do with our fingers 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:30.680
 we take from this part and we support trudy 2 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:33.420
 so with this with the thumb we press 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:36.110
 a little in the center 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:38.240
 to give it the form 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:40.660
 Now let's crush some two 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:40.660
 tips 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:46.170
 with the scissors we will round the 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:49.040
 corners to finish shaping 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:49.040
 our little heart
