the game I know the game is pretty old

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:44.979 
the game I know the game is pretty old
but<00:00:43.339> there<00:00:43.549> still<00:00:43.640> may<00:00:44.089> be<00:00:44.150> people<00:00:44.510> out<00:00:44.780> there

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:44.989 
but there still may be people out there

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:46.149 
but there still may be people out there
who<00:00:45.080> haven't<00:00:45.229> tried<00:00:45.530> it<00:00:45.650> out<00:00:45.769> yet

so<00:00:46.489> just<00:00:46.879> in<00:00:46.970> case<00:00:47.619> the<00:00:48.619> spoilers<00:00:49.070> are<00:00:49.280> pretty

00:00:49.509 --> 00:00:49.519 
so just in case the spoilers are pretty

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:51.700 
so just in case the spoilers are pretty
minor<00:00:49.760> but<00:00:50.479> still<00:00:50.780> show<00:00:51.019> characters<00:00:51.559> and

00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:58.400 
settings I'm using I basically started

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.219 
settings I'm using I basically started
with<00:00:58.580> a<00:00:58.610> high<00:00:58.879> setting<00:00:59.150> preset<00:00:59.750> and<00:00:59.960> dialed

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:00.229 
with a high setting preset and dialed

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:02.410 
with a high setting preset and dialed

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
down a couple things here and there the

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.329 
down a couple things here and there the
game<00:01:02.659> will<00:01:02.900> run<00:01:03.110> in<00:01:03.290> the<00:01:03.379> high<00:01:03.530> preset<00:01:04.040> but<00:01:04.309> I

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
game will run in the high preset but I

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:05.980 
game will run in the high preset but I
found<00:01:04.519> a<00:01:04.640> more<00:01:04.820> smoother<00:01:05.210> experience<00:01:05.780> with

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
found a more smoother experience with

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.420 
found a more smoother experience with
these<00:01:06.110> settings<00:01:08.260> for<00:01:09.260> comparison<00:01:09.980> here<00:01:10.340> are

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 
these settings for comparison here are

this is only against two people so it
isn't<00:03:04.940> too<00:03:04.970> taxing<00:03:05.510> but<00:03:05.660> you<00:03:05.780> can<00:03:05.930> see<00:03:06.110> that

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:06.320 
isn't too taxing but you can see that

00:05:46.799 --> 00:05:46.809 
in this clip you'll see that there are

00:05:46.809 --> 00:05:48.570 
in this clip you'll see that there are
times<00:05:47.139> when<00:05:47.349> a<00:05:47.379> bright<00:05:47.650> light<00:05:47.860> source<00:05:48.129> barely

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:20.680 
on the flip side here's an example when

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:21.900 
on the flip side here's an example when
a<00:06:20.710> light<00:06:20.979> source<00:06:21.220> can<00:06:21.430> affect<00:06:21.790> the

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:21.910 
a light source can affect the

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:24.420 
a light source can affect the
performance<00:06:22.180> big-time<00:06:22.960> this<00:06:23.949> is<00:06:24.100> one<00:06:24.250> of<00:06:24.340> the

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:24.430 
performance big-time this is one of the

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:26.010 
performance big-time this is one of the
few<00:06:24.639> times<00:06:24.880> that<00:06:25.120> I<00:06:25.210> saw<00:06:25.419> the<00:06:25.479> frames<00:06:25.810> per

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:26.020 
few times that I saw the frames per

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:28.530 
few times that I saw the frames per
second<00:06:26.440> bit<00:06:26.680> below<00:06:26.889> 30<00:06:27.340> but<00:06:27.760> even<00:06:28.000> so<00:06:28.240> the

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:28.540 
second bit below 30 but even so the

00:06:28.540 --> 00:07:34.709 
second bit below 30 but even so the
gameplay<00:06:28.750> still<00:06:29.290> remained<00:06:29.680> fairly<00:06:29.949> smooth

00:07:34.709 --> 00:07:34.719 

00:07:34.719 --> 00:07:37.239 

I'll<00:07:35.719> end<00:07:36.019> with<00:07:36.199> an<00:07:36.319> example<00:07:36.830> of<00:07:36.919> one<00:07:37.069> of<00:07:37.099> the

00:07:37.239 --> 00:07:37.249 
I'll end with an example of one of the

00:07:37.249 --> 00:07:39.249 
I'll end with an example of one of the
cutscenes<00:07:37.899> unfortunately<00:07:38.899> all<00:07:39.080> the

00:07:39.249 --> 00:07:39.259 
cutscenes unfortunately all the

00:07:39.259 --> 00:07:41.289 
cutscenes unfortunately all the
cutscenes<00:07:39.679> are<00:07:39.799> pre-rendered<00:07:40.369> I'm<00:07:40.819> guessing

00:07:41.289 --> 00:07:41.299 
cutscenes are pre-rendered I'm guessing

00:07:41.299 --> 00:07:42.519 
cutscenes are pre-rendered I'm guessing
they<00:07:41.389> were<00:07:41.419> pre-rendered<00:07:42.049> on<00:07:42.139> a<00:07:42.169> resolution

00:07:42.519 --> 00:07:42.529 
they were pre-rendered on a resolution

00:07:42.529 --> 00:07:44.919 
they were pre-rendered on a resolution
below<00:07:43.099> 1080p<00:07:43.699> because<00:07:43.999> of<00:07:44.119> the<00:07:44.209> letterboxing

00:07:44.919 --> 00:07:44.929 
below 1080p because of the letterboxing

00:07:44.929 --> 00:07:47.289 
below 1080p because of the letterboxing
in<00:07:45.259> any<00:07:45.649> case<00:07:45.949> all<00:07:46.219> the<00:07:46.369> cutscenes<00:07:46.759> run<00:07:47.059> at<00:07:47.209> a

in any case all the cutscenes run at a

00:07:47.299 --> 00:07:50.019 
in any case all the cutscenes run at a
steady<00:07:47.539> 60<00:07:48.019> frames<00:07:48.289> per<00:07:48.409> second<00:07:48.919> hope<00:07:49.879> this

00:07:50.019 --> 00:07:50.029 
steady 60 frames per second hope this

00:07:50.029 --> 00:07:51.429
