who<00:06:04.330> was<00:06:05.330> collapsing<00:06:05.990> under<00:06:06.800> this<00:06:06.949> weight<00:06:07.250> and

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:07.520 
who was collapsing under this weight and

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:11.529 
who was collapsing under this weight and
I<00:06:08.000> found<00:06:08.659> myself<00:06:09.279> you<00:06:10.279> know<00:06:10.340> as<00:06:10.550> an<00:06:10.699> emerging

00:06:11.529 --> 00:06:11.539 
I found myself you know as an emerging

00:06:11.539 --> 00:06:15.760 
I found myself you know as an emerging
national<00:06:12.050> figure<00:06:12.400> reading<00:06:14.020> the<00:06:15.020> big<00:06:15.229> book<00:06:15.500> and

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:15.770 
national figure reading the big book and

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:17.890 
national figure reading the big book and
trying<00:06:16.039> to<00:06:16.189> understand<00:06:16.669> where<00:06:17.090> I<00:06:17.120> had<00:06:17.599> failed

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:17.900 
trying to understand where I had failed

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:19.899 
trying to understand where I had failed
and<00:06:18.139> why<00:06:18.349> I<00:06:18.379> was<00:06:18.830> empty<00:06:19.189> and<00:06:19.340> why<00:06:19.490> I<00:06:19.520> had<00:06:19.879> to

00:06:19.899 --> 00:06:19.909 
and why I was empty and why I had to

00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:23.019 
and why I was empty and why I had to
turn<00:06:20.180> to<00:06:20.210> God<00:06:20.389> and<00:06:20.900> I<00:06:21.310> think<00:06:22.310> that<00:06:22.550> had<00:06:22.879> I<00:06:22.909> not

00:06:23.019 --> 00:06:23.029 
turn to God and I think that had I not

00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:25.240 
turn to God and I think that had I not
had<00:06:23.270> that<00:06:23.569> experience<00:06:23.840> that<00:06:24.620> I<00:06:24.680> had<00:06:24.800> not<00:06:24.949> had

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:25.250 
had that experience that I had not had

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:27.219 
had that experience that I had not had
that<00:06:25.279> intervention<00:06:25.969> I<00:06:26.120> might<00:06:26.719> literally<00:06:27.020> have

00:06:27.219 --> 00:06:27.229 
that intervention I might literally have

00:06:27.229 --> 00:06:29.679 
that intervention I might literally have
collapsed<00:06:27.589> totally<00:06:28.099> and<00:06:28.279> and<00:06:29.270> that<00:06:29.509> was

00:06:29.679 --> 00:06:29.689 
collapsed totally and and that was

00:06:29.689 --> 00:06:31.239 
collapsed totally and and that was
really<00:06:29.870> the<00:06:30.020> beginning<00:06:30.259> of<00:06:30.740> turning<00:06:31.099> my<00:06:31.219> life

00:06:31.239 --> 00:06:31.249 
really the beginning of turning my life

00:06:31.249 --> 00:06:33.369 
really the beginning of turning my life
