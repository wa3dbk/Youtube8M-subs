00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.850
 It's this group of two duels and we 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.890
 found for a pdp tutorial in 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:18.660
 which I advise tips for you 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.520
 pvp in text mode 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.250
 today this company of Marseille 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:27.360
 who's going to be my guinea hi hi so 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.930
 for we start with the first 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.480
 technical 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.700
 so as I tell you right now 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.440
 for the first technique so the 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.950
 first technique it's dignity the 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.390
 dense block will see in this case 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:41.280
 and they will have time to type you 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.690
 ask who says earlier and they will do 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.879
 moves that we will make a 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.829
 convoy where I will not use the summer 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.089
 of blocks and barÃ§a will use it 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.050
 we will play as I want you go 

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:50.550
 see difference in color when I 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.589
 used in the summer but when I can 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.140
 use it noisy this party so there I 

00:00:52.589 --> 00:00:57.480
 do not use 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.829
 oh well if you're here so you see that 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.100
 I read I had two cars and bets 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.399
 Okay 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.690
 so here we will redo with using 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.300
 the 8th and the 12th and their guests at 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.930
 doctor prester the dentine well this 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:16.259
 year I'm just taking a question for 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:25.890
 resume go ahead am here I am irritated 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:28.039
 to see a difference following the one 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.320
 will start again 

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:32.840
 so that was the break that's the 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.130
 fight lasts longer 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.390
 you saw that there I am super 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.830
 quickly while there if I resume 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.180
 neighbor in a row tender's and landed 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:46.710
 also much longer compared to 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:49.440
 other fronts of combat this is an abuse 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.149
 factory block for more stories 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.740
 right for the money their excuses he 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.929
 confesses to him to try the ads is 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:59.240
 still voice this party desire 

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:59.240
 had ended such 071 chooses the basics 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.979
 the elected then thank you for being there I 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.450
 just lost heart there I'm fine 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:10.069
 fullmetal twitter blogs on the way you 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.930
 go go there have you seen that I 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:13.040
 called golden decline then totally 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.500
 he loves that just now 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.900
 comedian and 15:30 we really saw 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.310
 of importance this technique 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.200
 so now let's go for a 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.250
 second technique and att of the congo so 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.900
 otherwise it's called like that actually 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.980
 that it consists of running and jumping in 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.550
 same time on the lips to make him 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.220
 more damage 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.480
 and there we will propel them back to 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.700
 allows you to make more shine so you 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.380
 combine that you combine that with 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.340
 intel block and you will see that you 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.660
 will do a lot of damage 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.800
 you saw that just now they 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.850
 did not use this technique is 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.100
 now he used made me 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.269
 a lot of damage from one you and with 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.750
 these techniques to make him do 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:46.430
 easily lose duty maybe even 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.200
 maybe four hearts according to goes the 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.670
 treat and you go so we will redo 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.500
 in fight I just think a bail 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.420
 to really show you that 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.410
 companies ends quickly thanks to this 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.290
 technical because I did a lot 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:03:04.760
 good damage it's gone we take the 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:07.310
 potion go for it perfect malaise look on 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.620
 combine that with the hit the block 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.910
 I had a lot more but finally 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.370
 kick and eat four hearts in nice 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:15.410
 while no and mpeg normally the 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.000
 three quarters and there you see you 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.320
 I had four and a half hours left 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.890
 end of the fight so the detectives of 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:24.530
 mixing offers you two very advantages 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.269
 consequent on your opponent then 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.829
 the third technique in pvp if the 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:29.420
 jump technique from the front that 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:30.170
 is not to show the sun to 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.579
 our opponent 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:33.320
 and when he also wants for you 

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:34.820
 type you go running and at 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.739
 moment when he is behind you you 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:39.739
 go back opposite that one like that 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:41.000
 is well in it is not 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:42.650
 also when I'm even if we have it 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.989
 good to pose nature the magnificent 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.820
 present in ten years but me it works 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:50.000
 in fact you explain then in fact 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:51.620
 why does it work when you 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.519
 put alone nine I was fine because 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.170
 that as I am like them you are 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:56.690
 on his point of view when you put 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:59.120
 the only man that already burns so already 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:59.720
 burn and at the same time it slows down see 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.190
 that slows down 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.810
 it's expensive for him we can not move forward 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:04.040
 in the aisles in the match for a 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.769
 star game to say it again 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.269
 wait until picking up in the box does 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:10.459
 not move forward I'm in a hurry to move forward and 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:11.540
 no because I'm green even though 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:12.810
 you are kind 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.489
 after if you 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:17.299
 resistance and protection james 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:19.799
 ellroy do or six years four with 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:22.590
 James is sure you resisted but 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:22.800
 that's even if that's what I have to 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.290
 say 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.700
 but if you have a wandering soul I like 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:29.850
 at normal for sure I went less 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:31.910
 three bases pass me the soldier but 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:34.470
 well show you the example well then 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:37.650
 I missed my 2 0 but who comes is 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:40.410
 not a trick and the soya the opponent knows 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:42.930
 all that from one half with one 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:44.520
 armor so here you put yourself 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.440
 can go straight and you go back to 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.360
 propose the heads go well but with 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.820
 the opponent like that admits to being sure 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.990
 that they take it well the only fit and 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.190
 the moment I could finish with the sword 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:54.660
 same expectations that burn hurt but 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:05:00.900
 the terrain was at least we never know 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:05:04.229
 if they did join on this Friday to say 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:07.250
 that I am you see the legend 

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:11.520
 American and so I have not yet in 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:14.610
 governed in the line up 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:16.380
 it's weakened I hope not a lot of 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:17.910
 heart each load will be a bit of a taff 

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:20.400
 is like that even at the death of a woman 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:23.250
 and the girl wise and tatiana and crisis 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:26.220
 and I typed prevented and if so he goes out 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:27.960
 in worse took two doctors annaba was 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:29.460
 finally to the diamond and I managed to 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.870
 kill even without long sword but as 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:33.300
 it's very important that vicente line 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:35.669
 basic pvp so a prostitute 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:37.919
 learn to practice regularly 

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:41.250
 so we will press it without further ado 

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:43.680
 at the 4th techno we find ourselves for the 

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:45.090
 fourth and last technique and the 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.919
 techniques when playing bow it's 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:49.860
 to say while we are being sued 

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:51.720
 by our enemy advances and turns 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:53.639
 and shoot with the bow to slow it down 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.960
 you move forward you turn around 

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:55.950
 remove with their colors slow down 

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.930
 according to you do some help you 

00:05:55.950 --> 00:06:00.000
 change meaning so we destabilize 

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:01.560
 your opponent throw slap more 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:06.569
 jealous car dycker 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:10.800
 look we do that after 

00:06:06.569 --> 00:06:14.729
 if the sun is down the evil chip you 

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:16.409
 are coming off here too and 

00:06:14.729 --> 00:06:18.119
 rapist a geo that a gerland armor 

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:19.259
 so it's very useful if you have a 

00:06:18.119 --> 00:06:21.149
 guys are you doing for these settings 

00:06:19.259 --> 00:06:23.099
 to the sword do not hesitate to change without this 

00:06:21.149 --> 00:06:24.619
 party diagonally turn around is 

00:06:23.099 --> 00:06:27.990
 always better for your brands 

00:06:24.619 --> 00:06:29.969
 and so that's so thank you for being here from 

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:35.779
