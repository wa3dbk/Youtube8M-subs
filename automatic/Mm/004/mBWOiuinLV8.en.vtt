00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.570
 determining factors when it comes to 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.340
 choose will barcelona is the component 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.750

 titling there is an opportunity 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:48.730
 incredible in my case in particular I was 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:50.750
 proposed the option of going to study

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.580
 it is clear that it is a thing that if not 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:57.620

 work in the media 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.449
 because it means that what they explain to us 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.770
 we have reflected it at all times in their 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:08.600
