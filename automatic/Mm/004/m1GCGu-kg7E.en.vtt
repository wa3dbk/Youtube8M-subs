00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:11.389
 Good morning, I'm the saic 's duck. 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:14.480
 expert 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:17.180
 today I'll give one more tip of what has 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:21.890
 happened a lot with the brake of the formula 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:25.480
 1 the hydraulic brake in general goes 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:31.490
 entering a dirt around the piston 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:35.239
 of the tweezers that are here, you see what 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:38.269
 cool do let's take the brake do 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:41.000
 a good wash in the system put the 

00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:44.840
 pistons a bit out 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.780
 apply the original grease 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:50.870
 in the case of brake formula there is grease 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:54.050
 for mounting brakes that it does not 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.100
 damages internal sorting and external 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.010
 case 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:00.789
 then apply a spread layer 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.789
 right 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:07.300
 Now I'm going to do the process with the other one. 

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:09.410
 plastic tool to return the python 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:12.590
 I already did it 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:18.470
 're looking across a residue of 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:19.939
 grease already returned the piston on that side 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.310
 Now I'm going to return what I'm giving 

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:24.939
 side and the 23 start working well 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.939
 soft 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:31.610
 to return the piston is now very 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:37.700
 simple we'll get a spatula and oh 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:37.700
 down the piston that has to go down 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:54.560
 the frei is running free and soft 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.380
 Let's clean this now. 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.740
 excess grease and the installation of new 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.740
 tablets 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:07.440
 types three brake pad models 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:12.330
 to be installed in brake 1 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:13.410
 we have the semi metallic ones that are the 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:18.000
 stands 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:22.170
 we have the original stander organic and 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:26.040
 the internet to each well specification 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:30.200
 best among resistance rain season 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:33.540
 dry season already comes with new 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.520
 that this is great that usually 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.090
 This sharing when she warns the ball. 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.090
 got me 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:46.280
 I'm going to install here 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:48.650
 semi-metallic inserts and to make 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.630
 insert fit one side 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.610
 and you have to do a little to 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.560
 fit the other 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.150
 by note from here to be 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:01.120
 installed 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:07.190
 We'll get the forceps to dock 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:12.260
 of the brake pads will come with the 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:13.670
 guide pin which is a thumbscrew 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.160
 with the key to 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:19.390
 The good thing here is to put a little bit of 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.390
 locke tatina thread 

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:26.670
 has this tiny little 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:29.489
 fit that little scratch here 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:33.000
 the same way and place back then gives 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:35.670
 To take away, just pull the mayor. 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.829
 we are with brother here and now we 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.829
 Let's do the installation there on the bike. 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:45.990
 when we will do it when people 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:48.569
 for installing the brake formula 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:51.569
 Let's note that it 's the little house in the 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:54.450
 sense that the wheel rotates 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:56.610
 this part is higher than this 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:59.430
 so the need for that in the front 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:01.110
 has a bolt more fulfilled than 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.630
 behind 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:06.900
 ok got that detail both in front 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:09.750
 how much in the rear 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:13.739
 We'll fit in here, now let's go. 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:15.750
 set and align to stay 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:18.950
 aligned between peace I took the 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.950
 perfect disk 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:29.120
 one thing is very important in the brake 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:31.610
 rear is to see if the two pistons are 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:33.259
 moving because otherwise it is necessary 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:37.520
 hold a moving side 

00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:39.320
 and braking so that the other moves there 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.870
 so you play a little bit there a little 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.910
 here and I think the center and hydraulic 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:47.860
 dividing the hydraulic part in there 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:50.389
 the two pistons running together 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:53.949
 optical see that the friar was loudly 

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:53.949
 looking O 

00:04:54.140 --> 00:05:02.450
 now with the aid of a toquilla 

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:06.140
 we're going to put six thousand I took all 

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:06.140
 Here in this case 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:15.390
 It's good to have a little bit because the pieces 

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:18.020
 nowadays are very delicate and with 

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:18.020
 much accuracy 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:28.729
 so we finished that assembly of the 

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:33.039
 33 became very soft knots are 

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:33.039
 working super perfect free sa 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:39.310
 yet top 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:39.310
 to the next
