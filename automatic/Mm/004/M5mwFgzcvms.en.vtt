00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
the black is going to bring them out the

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.209 
the black is going to bring them out the
thing<00:00:34.530> about<00:00:34.739> black<00:00:35.010> is<00:00:35.370> that<00:00:36.559> it<00:00:37.559> frames<00:00:37.950> the

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
thing about black is that it frames the

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.750 
thing about black is that it frames the
eye<00:00:39.170> with<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.290> most<00:00:40.469> intensity<00:00:41.100> and<00:00:41.370> it<00:00:41.610> can

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
eye with the most intensity and it can

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.020 
eye with the most intensity and it can
be<00:00:41.940> quite<00:00:42.480> dramatic<00:00:43.309> so<00:00:44.309> it's<00:00:44.550> up<00:00:44.700> to<00:00:44.730> you

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
be quite dramatic so it's up to you

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.410 
be quite dramatic so it's up to you
whether<00:00:45.270> or<00:00:45.660> not<00:00:45.719> your<00:00:46.020> personality<00:00:46.469> fits<00:00:46.920> a

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.420 
whether or not your personality fits a

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.889 
whether or not your personality fits a
dramatic<00:00:48.420> look<00:00:49.850> now<00:00:50.850> black<00:00:51.120> can<00:00:51.149> also<00:00:51.480> be<00:00:51.780> the

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
dramatic look now black can also be the

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.959 
dramatic look now black can also be the
harshest<00:00:52.289> color<00:00:52.530> because<00:00:52.920> it<00:00:53.070> is<00:00:53.190> so<00:00:53.399> concrete

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
harshest color because it is so concrete

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.330 
harshest color because it is so concrete
and<00:00:54.210> so<00:00:54.870> far<00:00:55.110> away<00:00:55.289> from<00:00:55.350> someone's<00:00:55.860> natural

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
and so far away from someone's natural

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.459 
and so far away from someone's natural
skin<00:00:56.610> color<00:00:59.180> black<00:01:00.180> does<00:01:00.480> blend<00:01:01.020> in<00:01:01.230> with<00:01:01.350> the

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469

skin color black does blend in with the
eyelashes<00:01:02.039> though<00:01:02.190> so<00:01:02.370> it<00:01:02.489> can<00:01:02.609> help<00:01:02.760> give<00:01:03.120> the

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
eyelashes though so it can help give the

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.070 
eyelashes though so it can help give the
appearance<00:01:03.600> that<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:04.019> eyelashes<00:01:04.470> are<00:01:04.559> longer

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080 
appearance that the eyelashes are longer

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:14.640 
appearance that the eyelashes are longer
with<00:01:07.080> gray

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:14.650

anyone can still wear this color it's

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.800 
anyone can still wear this color it's
just<00:01:29.380> not<00:01:29.770> going<00:01:30.040> to<00:01:30.360> complement<00:01:31.360> the<00:01:31.420> eye<00:01:31.510> as

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
just not going to complement the eye as

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.510 
just not going to complement the eye as
well<00:01:34.290> and<00:01:35.290> it's<00:01:35.650> not<00:01:35.830> going<00:01:36.010> to<00:01:36.070> be<00:01:36.160> as<00:01:36.280> harsh

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
well and it's not going to be as harsh

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.700 
well and it's not going to be as harsh
it's<00:01:37.390> a<00:01:37.540> little<00:01:37.960> more<00:01:38.170> subdued<00:01:40.470> but<00:01:41.470> it<00:01:41.590> is

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
it's a little more subdued but it is

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:48.530 
it's a little more subdued but it is
considered<00:01:42.250> more<00:01:42.430> of<00:01:42.490> a<00:01:42.640> daytime<00:01:43.090> eyeliner

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.390 

and<00:01:48.840> as<00:01:49.200> you<00:01:49.350> can<00:01:49.470> see<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.890> gray<00:01:50.100> liner

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:50.400 
and as you can see the gray liner

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.700 
and as you can see the gray liner
doesn't<00:01:50.910> blend<00:01:51.090> into<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.570> eyes<00:01:51.690> as<00:01:51.960> well<00:01:51.990> so

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
doesn't blend into the eyes as well so

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:53.990 
doesn't blend into the eyes as well so
you<00:01:52.800> can<00:01:53.010> definitely<00:01:53.160> see<00:01:53.730> where<00:01:53.880> the

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
you can definitely see where the

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.790 
you can definitely see where the
eyeliner<00:01:54.390> separates<00:01:54.930> from<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.110> lashes<00:01:55.410> as

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:55.800 
eyeliner separates from the lashes as

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.480 
eyeliner separates from the lashes as
