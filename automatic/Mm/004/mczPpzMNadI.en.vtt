00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:47.869 
good I'm not going to bother the
shuffling<00:05:45.599> these<00:05:45.810> up<00:05:45.990> but<00:05:46.529> you<00:05:47.490> can<00:05:47.669> see<00:05:47.819> how

00:05:47.869 --> 00:05:47.879 
shuffling these up but you can see how

00:05:47.879 --> 00:05:52.159 
shuffling these up but you can see how
well<00:05:48.060> they<00:05:48.180> work<00:05:49.729> so<00:05:50.729> once<00:05:51.539> the<00:05:51.689> deck<00:05:51.840> has<00:05:51.990> been

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:52.169 
well they work so once the deck has been

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:54.469 
well they work so once the deck has been
used<00:05:52.439> for<00:05:52.710> a<00:05:52.770> little<00:05:53.009> while<00:05:53.240> you'll<00:05:54.240> get

00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:54.479 
used for a little while you'll get

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:55.749 
used for a little while you'll get
something<00:05:54.689> like<00:05:54.960> we're<00:05:55.229> stuck<00:05:55.379> right<00:05:55.620> here

00:05:55.749 --> 00:05:55.759 
something like we're stuck right here

00:05:55.759 --> 00:05:58.369 
something like we're stuck right here
except<00:05:56.759> for<00:05:56.789> a<00:05:57.029> few<00:05:57.060> years<00:05:57.240> ago<00:05:57.509> a<00:05:57.779> pink<00:05:58.169> duck

00:05:58.369 --> 00:05:58.379 
except for a few years ago a pink duck

00:05:58.379 --> 00:06:01.189 
except for a few years ago a pink duck
it<00:05:58.979> will<00:05:59.099> not<00:05:59.219> destroy<00:05:59.550> my<00:05:59.759> turn<00:05:59.969> green<00:06:00.199> but

00:06:01.189 --> 00:06:01.199 
it will not destroy my turn green but

00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:04.459 
it will not destroy my turn green but
this<00:06:01.289> is<00:06:01.469> where<00:06:01.620> I<00:06:01.650> a<00:06:01.680> used<00:06:02.840> reverse<00:06:03.840> duck<00:06:04.259> is

00:06:04.459 --> 00:06:04.469 
this is where I a used reverse duck is

00:06:04.469 --> 00:06:08.860 
this is where I a used reverse duck is
like<00:06:06.710> it<00:06:07.710> will<00:06:07.889> lose<00:06:08.099> its<00:06:08.129> dribbling<00:06:08.610> ability

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:08.870 
like it will lose its dribbling ability

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:13.240 
like it will lose its dribbling ability
it<00:06:09.870> does<00:06:10.020> it<00:06:10.560> does<00:06:10.740> still<00:06:11.159> dribble<00:06:11.520> well<00:06:11.840> but

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:13.250 
it does it does still dribble well but

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:15.439 
it does it does still dribble well but
tends<00:06:14.250> to<00:06:14.400> get<00:06:14.490> a<00:06:14.550> little<00:06:14.610> clunker<00:06:15.060> sometimes

00:06:15.439 --> 00:06:15.449 
tends to get a little clunker sometimes

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:18.230 
tends to get a little clunker sometimes
but<00:06:16.349> it<00:06:17.009> still<00:06:17.219> fans<00:06:17.460> pretty<00:06:17.729> good<00:06:17.879> as<00:06:18.029> you<00:06:18.120> can
