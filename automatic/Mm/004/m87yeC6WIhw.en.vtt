00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.130
 admit that I am sort of a small sneak 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.320

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.150
 of forgetting what's in it this month 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.199
 so if you do that then stand up 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.789
 we tickled 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.949
 I'm just going to show them what 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.399
 it is oh guys there is the way 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.110
 also something very bad happened to me as one 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.700
 time ago anderson's the green 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.890

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.170
 well then d that it kind of again 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.879
 to knock you're a bit stuck 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.660
 well the harder you go blue better 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.280

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.870

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.570
 macbook air was not yet three years old 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.510
 I then really saved my money there 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.520
 and it really was my everything and 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.020
 I fear that I really don't do that anymore 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.629
 I put it in the rice to 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:07.140
 see if it helps I'm afraid not 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.619
 but I really really really really 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.350
 very 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.420

 with beauty boxes to ask if they are 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.290

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.970

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:14.700
 little rusty color

 this is how it looks on my skin yes my 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.739
 eyes that are green and I think this is it 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.630
 kind of earth tones just incredibly beautiful 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:24.329
 the there and he also looks now 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.950
 packaging is beautiful, so this is it 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:28.260
 a topper 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:31.260
 again the prices you are upstairs 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:35.549
 in the picture so take a look at it 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:37.560
 that was cool the rose first product that 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:40.260
 is there a product that I also have 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.420
 its also to know if its wary 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:45.450
 keeps looking like your and this is one 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:47.579
 instant self-tanner and it works best 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.870
 well through 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:50.959
 look he is colored as long as you like it 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:54.269
 packaging and if you put it on you 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:55.980
 skin lubricates then yes I can not really 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:04:00.890
 a very good one for the room 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:03.230
 quite a nice brown color off 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:05.000
 each side show yes they are on camera 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:08.000
 not really happen but believe me 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.069
 I test it and he works great 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.050
 especially for my legs, this is very bad 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:13.700
 fine I normally use myself 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:15.590
 the parents I now have one on you too 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.670
 can see it i have a line here 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:18.890
 walk 

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:20.540
 so this is my own color in this 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:22.070
 from self tanner so that does to one 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:23.810
 spray or wipes and that builds up 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.250
 really up after a few hours then one 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:26.630
 color gets new you immediately get one 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:30.350
 color of but I also think so 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:32.360
 nice for my legs for example 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:35.450
 then there is again completely in style and 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:37.160
 orange login from here oh it's a best 

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:40.340
 small bait 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:42.530
 see if I see how redder it is 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:44.360
 well not really but it was cute 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:45.740
 light for queensday yes i think 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.120
 I just nice this year but after so 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.860
 where you call it queen's day 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.660
 maybe i'm a nice crown or 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:52.130
 set up such a thing and never would be very loud 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:53.210
 inside where last year when I was at one 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:54.919
 festival 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:58.400
 when i also got a pregnant yes i found too 

00:04:54.919 --> 00:05:00.560
 festival was in its volts according to me and 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.000
 yes if i am not a mega one online either 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:05.060
 filled in I don't think it's the most 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.520
 flattering color then move on to 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:10.310
 doctor hans youth day 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:12.979
 dragged things and German brand 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:15.919
 more subtle for half is the subtitles car 

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:17.450
 treatment cream reduces scars 

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:19.070
 essential nutrients such as soy 

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:20.780
 rice chamomile extract naturally 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:22.460
 vitamin e and natural lactic acid 

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:23.990
 reduce scars and make them less 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:27.080
 visible 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:28.880
 well i think i find interesting 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:31.790
 I do n't know the brands I have to say 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:34.010
 because socially but once car green 

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:37.100
 yes that's interesting I 

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:39.680
 actually no scars but 

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:42.020
 maybe I will get cooler skin there 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:43.400
 from whatever it was, one becomes one 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:46.630
 healthier 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:51.650
 cool off so we will definitely test this 

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:54.140
 if I have a brand like this a product 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:55.820

 I was also very excited about a site on instagram 

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:02.590
 much shorter reviews so you still follow me 

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:05.230
