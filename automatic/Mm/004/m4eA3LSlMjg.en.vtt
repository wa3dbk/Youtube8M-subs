these are where I get my calculations
from<00:00:34.320> four<00:00:35.280> point<00:00:35.670> five<00:00:35.940> eight<00:00:36.450> beers<00:00:36.989> per

from four point five eight beers per
hour<00:00:37.469> which<00:00:38.370> breaks<00:00:38.670> down<00:00:38.910> into

every<00:00:46.020> ten<00:00:46.200> minutes<00:00:47.510> now<00:00:48.510> you<00:00:48.600> got<00:00:48.750> a<00:00:48.780> stay<00:00:48.960> up

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
every ten minutes now you got a stay up

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:49.880 
every ten minutes now you got a stay up
for<00:00:49.200> 24<00:00:49.469> hours<00:00:49.649> straight

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
for 24 hours straight

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.549 
for 24 hours straight
oh<00:00:50.629> you<00:00:51.629> see<00:00:51.870> you're<00:00:52.050> saying<00:00:52.289> you<00:00:52.350> think<00:00:52.379> this

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
oh you see you're saying you think this

00:00:52.559 --> 00:01:02.349 
oh you see you're saying you think this
was<00:00:52.710> rock<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.789> bell<00:00:54.030> not<00:00:54.960> let's<00:00:55.199> keep<00:00:55.350> going<00:01:00.980> I

00:01:02.349 --> 00:01:02.359 
was rock the bell not let's keep going I

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:05.119 
was rock the bell not let's keep going I
think<00:01:03.359> first<00:01:03.660> of<00:01:03.780> all<00:01:03.930> Tommy<00:01:04.320> did<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.799> reason

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
think first of all Tommy did the reason

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.770 
think first of all Tommy did the reason
you<00:01:05.250> haven't<00:01:05.430> succeeded<00:01:05.820> as<00:01:06.119> much<00:01:06.330> as<00:01:06.479> I<00:01:06.570> think

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
you haven't succeeded as much as I think

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.359 
you haven't succeeded as much as I think
you<00:01:06.900> could<00:01:07.200> in<00:01:07.380> life<00:01:07.560> is<00:01:07.740> because<00:01:08.159> you

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
you could in life is because you

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.060 
you could in life is because you
immediately<00:01:09.200> dispel<00:01:10.200> things<00:01:10.619> that<00:01:10.799> you<00:01:10.860> think

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
immediately dispel things that you think

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.700 
immediately dispel things that you think
are<00:01:11.159> impossible<00:01:11.430> instead<00:01:12.030> of<00:01:12.090> imagining<00:01:12.720> the

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
are impossible instead of imagining the

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.740 
are impossible instead of imagining the
possibilities<00:01:14.000> so<00:01:15.000> first<00:01:15.420> of<00:01:15.509> all<00:01:15.570> I'm<00:01:15.659> gonna

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
possibilities so first of all I'm gonna

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.929 
possibilities so first of all I'm gonna
say<00:01:15.930> it's<00:01:16.110> possible<00:01:16.590> he<00:01:17.250> could<00:01:17.460> have<00:01:17.520> decided

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
say it's possible he could have decided

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.460 
say it's possible he could have decided
he's<00:01:18.119> gonna<00:01:18.240> stay<00:01:18.450> up<00:01:18.570> for<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.810> full<00:01:19.049> use<00:01:19.320> the

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
he's gonna stay up for the full use the

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.310 
he's gonna stay up for the full use the
full<00:01:19.650> 24<00:01:20.130> hours<00:01:20.570> if<00:01:21.570> you<00:01:21.750> didn't<00:01:21.960> use<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.110> full

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
full 24 hours if you didn't use the full

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.719 
full 24 hours if you didn't use the full
24<00:01:22.740> hours<00:01:22.770> if<00:01:23.009> I<00:01:23.100> have<00:01:23.220> to<00:01:23.310> adjust<00:01:23.430> my

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
24 hours if I have to adjust my

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.570 
24 hours if I have to adjust my
calculations<00:01:24.600> let's<00:01:25.200> say<00:01:25.439> he<00:01:25.680> slept<00:01:25.950> like<00:01:26.430> the

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
calculations let's say he slept like the

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.910 
calculations let's say he slept like the
average<00:01:26.729> person<00:01:27.240> does<00:01:27.420> for<00:01:27.710> six<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:28.860> a<00:01:28.890> half

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
average person does for six and a half

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.340 
average person does for six and a half
hours<00:01:29.490> seven<00:01:29.970> hours<00:01:30.180> that<00:01:30.390> leaves<00:01:30.600> 17<00:01:31.079> hours

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
hours seven hours that leaves 17 hours

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.109 
hours seven hours that leaves 17 hours
of<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.500> day<00:01:31.680> you<00:01:32.310> know<00:01:32.369> just<00:01:32.610> get<00:01:32.790> out<00:01:32.909> my

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
of the day you know just get out my

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.569 
of the day you know just get out my
handy<00:01:33.689> little<00:01:33.840> calculator<00:01:34.409> what<00:01:35.189> we're<00:01:35.369> doing

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
handy little calculator what we're doing

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.780 
handy little calculator what we're doing
107<00:01:36.119> divided<00:01:36.390> by<00:01:36.450> 17<00:01:36.900> yeah

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:37.790 
107 divided by 17 yeah

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.609 
107 divided by 17 yeah
that's<00:01:38.790> approximately<00:01:39.479> a<00:01:39.930> little<00:01:40.290> over<00:01:40.470> six

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
that's approximately a little over six

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.440 
that's approximately a little over six
beers<00:01:40.860> now<00:01:41.100> or<00:01:41.280> one<00:01:41.549> beer<00:01:41.759> every<00:01:42.030> 10<00:01:42.240> minutes

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
beers now or one beer every 10 minutes

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.889 
beers now or one beer every 10 minutes
which<00:01:43.140> means<00:01:43.439> that<00:01:43.710> he's<00:01:43.920> drinking<00:01:44.600> yeah<00:01:45.600> he

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
which means that he's drinking yeah he

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.569 
which means that he's drinking yeah he
has<00:01:45.990> to<00:01:46.079> drink<00:01:46.229> basically<00:01:46.920> a<00:01:46.979> beer<00:01:47.189> every<00:01:47.310> 10

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
has to drink basically a beer every 10

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.219 
has to drink basically a beer every 10
minutes<00:01:47.790> for<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.210> entire<00:01:48.689> time<00:01:48.899> that<00:01:48.930> he's<00:01:49.140> at

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
minutes for the entire time that he's at

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.520 
minutes for the entire time that he's at
for<00:01:49.380> 17<00:01:49.710> hours<00:01:49.829> how<00:01:50.399> do<00:01:50.460> you<00:01:50.520> do<00:01:50.610> that<00:01:50.759> I

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
for 17 hours how do you do that I

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.410 
for 17 hours how do you do that I
couldn't<00:01:52.530> drink<00:01:52.619> that<00:01:52.770> much<00:01:52.860> water<00:01:53.420> you've

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
couldn't drink that much water you've

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.149
