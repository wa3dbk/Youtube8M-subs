00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:20.090 
400 it's a really nice curl like this
hair<00:02:18.450> because<00:02:18.750> it<00:02:18.900> blends<00:02:19.110> with<00:02:19.260> mine<00:02:19.440> and<00:02:19.800> it

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
hair because it blends with mine and it

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.520 
hair because it blends with mine and it
allows<00:02:20.370> me<00:02:20.400> to<00:02:20.640> do<00:02:21.150> a<00:02:21.450> lot<00:02:21.840> especially<00:02:22.019> because

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
allows me to do a lot especially because

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.199 
allows me to do a lot especially because
I<00:02:22.650> have<00:02:22.769> leave<00:02:23.220> out<00:02:23.400> you<00:02:23.580> can't<00:02:23.820> see<00:02:24.000> right<00:02:24.030> now

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
I have leave out you can't see right now

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.690 
I have leave out you can't see right now
because<00:02:24.360> I'm<00:02:24.570> wearing<00:02:24.720> a<00:02:24.870> head<00:02:25.860> wrap<00:02:26.040> but<00:02:26.670> I

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
because I'm wearing a head wrap but I

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.860 
because I'm wearing a head wrap but I
leave<00:02:27.060> out<00:02:27.239> so<00:02:27.570> it<00:02:27.750> blends<00:02:27.989> really<00:02:28.230> nicely<00:02:28.850> but

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
leave out so it blends really nicely but

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.780 
leave out so it blends really nicely but
here<00:02:30.870> is<00:02:31.050> what<00:02:31.260> I<00:02:31.290> do<00:02:31.440> not<00:02:31.890> like<00:02:31.950> about<00:02:32.430> the

here is what I do not like about the
hair<00:02:33.030> so<00:02:33.510> because<00:02:33.930> the<00:02:34.080> hair<00:02:34.290> is<00:02:34.530> really<00:02:34.950> curly

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
this hair requires so much maintenance

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.449 
this hair requires so much maintenance
like<00:03:15.150> I<00:03:15.360> would<00:03:15.900> comb<00:03:16.140> through<00:03:16.470> it<00:03:16.500> daily<00:03:17.040> and

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
like I would comb through it daily and

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:19.490 
like I would comb through it daily and
then<00:03:17.670> I<00:03:17.940> would<00:03:18.180> wash<00:03:18.450> it<00:03:18.750> and<00:03:18.959> it<00:03:19.170> would<00:03:19.320> get

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
then I would wash it and it would get

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.220 
then I would wash it and it would get
matted<00:03:20.220> up<00:03:20.549> again<00:03:20.910> and<00:03:21.360> so<00:03:21.630> in<00:03:21.780> fact<00:03:21.989> just

matted up again and so in fact just

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.020 
matted up again and so in fact just
really<00:03:22.440> frustrated<00:03:23.040> me<00:03:23.190> and<00:03:23.430> I<00:03:23.519> couldn't<00:03:23.850> deal

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:04.410 
make it not frizzy um because this hair
when<00:03:59.739> it<00:04:00.010> is<00:04:00.040> wet<00:04:00.660> it's<00:04:01.660> like<00:04:02.610> wavy<00:04:03.610> and<00:04:04.180> it

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420 
when it is wet it's like wavy and it

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.860 
when it is wet it's like wavy and it
lays<00:04:04.660> flat<00:04:04.690> and<00:04:05.560> then<00:04:05.860> when<00:04:06.700> it<00:04:06.849> dries<00:04:07.209> it's

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
lays flat and then when it dries it's

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:12.059 
lays flat and then when it dries it's
honestly<00:04:08.769> like<00:04:08.980> this<00:04:09.370> big<00:04:09.700> and<00:04:10.060> it's<00:04:11.069> matted

00:04:12.059 --> 00:04:12.069 
honestly like this big and it's matted

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:13.800 
honestly like this big and it's matted
even<00:04:12.489> if<00:04:12.610> you<00:04:12.730> comb<00:04:12.970> through<00:04:13.269> it<00:04:13.420> while<00:04:13.599> it's

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
even if you comb through it while it's

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.680 
even if you comb through it while it's
wet<00:04:14.079> once<00:04:14.440> it<00:04:14.680> dries<00:04:15.010> it<00:04:15.340> will<00:04:15.730> be<00:04:15.940> tangled<00:04:16.479> so

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
wet once it dries it will be tangled so

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.779 
wet once it dries it will be tangled so
you<00:04:16.750> have<00:04:16.989> to<00:04:17.169> like<00:04:17.350> constantly<00:04:18.310> go<00:04:18.760> through

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:18.789 
you have to like constantly go through

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:20.520 
you have to like constantly go through
and<00:04:19.239> which<00:04:19.389> is<00:04:19.510> another<00:04:19.840> part<00:04:20.139> of<00:04:20.229> the<00:04:20.350> high

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.530 
and which is another part of the high

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:22.590 
and which is another part of the high
