00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:32.529
 Servus and let's go on the Stubaier 

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:34.150
 glacier the weekend of 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:36.280
 All-saints would be with two and a half 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:37.840
 trunk used in advance to the new 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.540
 shoot it to start 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.980
 but this would take a total of 15 hours 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.660
 be spent in the car 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.000
 because we move from the Sauerland 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.950
 We had to and had to be so full 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.520
 even the skibus a whole piece 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:51.730
 use 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:53.530
 but it was definitely worth it 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.050
 friday and saturday it was great weather 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:58.000
 on sunday unfortunately a bit more for it 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.460
 only snow on the slopes and hardly 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.110
 Waiting times of departure to 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.400
 Middle station further was the whole 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.710
 Unfortunately, weekend closed 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.540
 but who seemed careful on old ones 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.790
 you can go down anyway 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.260
 nice departure and waiting times 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.060
 avoid the chairlifts 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.830
 however, it should be said that the 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.960
 last piece of the departure so much 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.580
 borderline was that you last 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.740
 should run better 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:24.240
 since october there is already a lot of snow 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.240
 lost again 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:39.070
 Well, two and a half days are unfortunately 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:40.720
 again quite quickly past the stubaier 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:42.400
 Glacier is for a season beginning 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.200
 absolutely well suited 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.660
 but something is missing here 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:49.690
 I would rather change in spring 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:51.250
 other glacier areas prefer 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.740
 Good weather, however, on 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:56.530
 Stubaier a very nice panorama and 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:04:00.060
 so I end this reportage from the 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.060
 alps servus
