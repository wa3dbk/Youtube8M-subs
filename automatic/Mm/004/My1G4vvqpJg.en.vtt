00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:08.980 
gimmick of this thing is to a whine this
thing<00:02:05.929> up<00:02:06.079> so<00:02:06.590> just<00:02:07.130> wind<00:02:07.399> it<00:02:07.460> up<00:02:07.609> a<00:02:07.990> few

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:08.990 
thing up so just wind it up a few

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:12.910 
thing up so just wind it up a few
jillion<00:02:09.440> times<00:02:09.789> and<00:02:11.050> open<00:02:12.050> it<00:02:12.140> up<00:02:12.260> and<00:02:12.680> let's

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
jillion times and open it up and let's

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.420 
jillion times and open it up and let's
uh<00:02:13.150> you<00:02:14.150> know<00:02:14.240> flap<00:02:14.510> it<00:02:14.660> like<00:02:14.810> penguins<00:02:15.710> open

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
uh you know flap it like penguins open

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.190 
uh you know flap it like penguins open
us<00:02:16.520> all<00:02:16.640> the<00:02:16.700> way<00:02:16.790> up<00:02:16.940> and<00:02:17.150> take<00:02:17.690> your<00:02:17.840> favorite

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
us all the way up and take your favorite

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.750 
us all the way up and take your favorite
switch<00:02:18.440> and

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
switch and

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:27.050 
switch and
in<00:02:20.760> there<00:02:21.170> and<00:02:22.170> it'll<00:02:22.500> spin<00:02:22.709> around<00:02:24.019> and<00:02:26.060> now

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
in there and it'll spin around and now

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.030 
in there and it'll spin around and now
it's<00:02:27.209> far<00:02:27.390> away<00:02:27.540> so<00:02:28.349> once<00:02:28.590> it<00:02:28.680> runs<00:02:28.799> out<00:02:28.980> of

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
it's far away so once it runs out of

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
it's far away so once it runs out of
juice<00:02:30.049> it'll<00:02:31.049> probably<00:02:31.290> fall<00:02:31.590> to<00:02:31.860> its<00:02:32.010> depth

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
juice it'll probably fall to its depth

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.190 
juice it'll probably fall to its depth
so<00:02:33.629> that's<00:02:34.159> stop<00:02:35.159> it<00:02:35.750> so<00:02:36.750> that's<00:02:36.930> pretty<00:02:37.109> much

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
so that's stop it so that's pretty much

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.250 
so that's stop it so that's pretty much
it<00:02:37.470> with<00:02:37.650> the<00:02:38.209> food<00:02:39.209> ready<00:02:39.659> here<00:02:39.840> if<00:02:39.959> you<00:02:40.049> want

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
it with the food ready here if you want

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.929 
it with the food ready here if you want
to<00:02:40.349> take<00:02:40.500> the<00:02:40.650> switch<00:02:40.920> out<00:02:41.129> there's<00:02:41.790> a<00:02:41.849> little

00:02:41.929 --> 00:02:41.939 
to take the switch out there's a little

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:44.360 
to take the switch out there's a little
button<00:02:42.420> right<00:02:42.450> here<00:02:42.840> it's<00:02:42.989> to<00:02:43.170> eject<00:02:43.620> it<00:02:43.799> so

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
button right here it's to eject it so

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.869 
button right here it's to eject it so
there<00:02:45.329> we<00:02:45.420> go<00:02:45.450> so<00:02:46.099> like<00:02:47.099> I<00:02:47.159> said<00:02:47.220> earlier<00:02:47.489> with

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:47.879 
there we go so like I said earlier with

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:49.789 
there we go so like I said earlier with
the<00:02:47.970> universal<00:02:48.510> shape<00:02:48.780> you<00:02:49.260> can<00:02:49.439> put<00:02:49.680> the

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:49.799 
the universal shape you can put the

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:51.740 
the universal shape you can put the
rocket<00:02:50.159> switch<00:02:50.340> in<00:02:50.519> there<00:02:50.670> and<00:02:50.909> eject<00:02:51.480> it<00:02:51.599> and

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
rocket switch in there and eject it and

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.979 
rocket switch in there and eject it and
put<00:02:51.989> it<00:02:52.079> away<00:02:53.180> but<00:02:54.180> keep<00:02:54.329> in<00:02:54.420> mind<00:02:54.629> that<00:02:54.720> some

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
put it away but keep in mind that some

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:57.319 
put it away but keep in mind that some
switches<00:02:55.409> are<00:02:55.590> obscure<00:02:56.129> shaped<00:02:56.489> so<00:02:56.940> putting

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:57.329 
switches are obscure shaped so putting

00:02:57.329 --> 00:02:59.539 
switches are obscure shaped so putting
the<00:02:57.480> power<00:02:57.690> switch<00:02:57.810> is<00:02:58.170> not<00:02:58.500> possible<00:02:59.099> because

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
the power switch is not possible because

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:03.589 
the power switch is not possible because
that<00:03:00.260> you<00:03:01.260> know<00:03:01.349> we've<00:03:01.620> been<00:03:01.799> right<00:03:01.950> here<00:03:02.599> the

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:03.599 
that you know we've been right here the

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:06.500 
that you know we've been right here the
cosmic<00:03:04.470> switch<00:03:04.799> will<00:03:05.280> not<00:03:05.489> fit<00:03:05.849> in<00:03:06.030> there

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
cosmic switch will not fit in there

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.000 
cosmic switch will not fit in there
so<00:03:06.659> let's<00:03:07.500> not<00:03:07.680> try<00:03:07.859> to<00:03:07.950> do<00:03:08.159> that<00:03:09.079> or<00:03:10.079> the<00:03:10.409> NS

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
so let's not try to do that or the NS

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.849 
so let's not try to do that or the NS
Mac<00:03:11.430> bow<00:03:11.700> will<00:03:12.090> not<00:03:12.299> fit<00:03:12.599> in<00:03:12.629> here<00:03:12.989> so<00:03:13.019> our

Mac bow will not fit in here so our
