00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:49.630 
they said if that happens they're gonna

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:51.930

reimplement<00:00:50.230> serpents<00:00:50.649> bread<00:00:50.890> and<00:00:51.070> I<00:00:51.700> really

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:51.940 
reimplement serpents bread and I really

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:53.520 
reimplement serpents bread and I really
like<00:00:52.090> the<00:00:52.239> idea<00:00:52.300> just<00:00:52.600> because<00:00:52.840> I<00:00:53.110> don't<00:00:53.290> like

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:53.530 
like the idea just because I don't like

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.229 
like the idea just because I don't like
the<00:00:53.710> new<00:00:53.829> black<00:00:54.040> arrow<00:00:54.340> the<00:00:54.790> concept<00:00:55.149> behind

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:55.239 
the new black arrow the concept behind

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:58.139 
the new black arrow the concept behind
it<00:00:55.660> the<00:00:56.200> AoE<00:00:56.530> is<00:00:56.860> a<00:00:56.890> really<00:00:57.399> shitty<00:00:57.640> design<00:00:58.000> in

00:00:58.139 --> 00:00:58.149 
it the AoE is a really shitty design in

00:00:58.149 --> 00:00:59.729 
it the AoE is a really shitty design in
my<00:00:58.270> opinion<00:00:58.540> and<00:00:58.899> it's<00:00:59.260> not<00:00:59.410> really<00:00:59.620> always

00:00:59.729 --> 00:00:59.739 
my opinion and it's not really always

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:01.650 
my opinion and it's not really always
going<00:00:59.950> to<00:01:00.010> work<00:01:00.220> because<00:01:00.430> the<00:01:01.030> ads<00:01:01.180> have<00:01:01.390> to<00:01:01.540> be

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:01.660 
going to work because the ads have to be

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.600 
going to work because the ads have to be
in<00:01:01.840> the<00:01:01.960> path<00:01:02.170> of<00:01:02.350> the<00:01:02.410> arrow<00:01:02.649> and<00:01:03.040> you<00:01:03.460> can

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:03.610 
in the path of the arrow and you can

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.240 
in the path of the arrow and you can
break<00:01:03.880> CC<00:01:04.329> if<00:01:04.570> there's<00:01:04.629> a<00:01:04.899> mob<00:01:05.320> in<00:01:05.619> that<00:01:05.860> path

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.250 
break CC if there's a mob in that path

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.340 
break CC if there's a mob in that path
of<00:01:06.549> the<00:01:06.640> boss<00:01:06.820> so<00:01:07.149> there's<00:01:07.869> just<00:01:08.020> a<00:01:08.110> lot<00:01:08.229> of

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 
of the boss so there's just a lot of

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:09.719 
of the boss so there's just a lot of
things<00:01:08.530> that<00:01:08.680> I<00:01:08.710> didn't<00:01:09.009> like<00:01:09.100> about<00:01:09.159> it<00:01:09.549> and

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:09.729 
things that I didn't like about it and

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:10.950 
things that I didn't like about it and
I'm<00:01:09.790> hoping<00:01:09.880> that<00:01:10.119> they<00:01:10.270> do<00:01:10.329> revert<00:01:10.780> it<00:01:10.810> back

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 
I'm hoping that they do revert it back

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.260 
I'm hoping that they do revert it back
to<00:01:11.259> the<00:01:11.380> old<00:01:11.530> way<00:01:11.740> and<00:01:11.920> the<00:01:12.820> next<00:01:13.030> thing<00:01:13.210> is

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270 
to the old way and the next thing is

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:14.929 
to the old way and the next thing is
that<00:01:13.479> they<00:01:13.570> are<00:01:13.600> reimplemented<00:01:14.319> world<00:01:14.679> bosses

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
that they are reimplemented world bosses

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.309 
that they are reimplemented world bosses
the<00:01:15.939> one<00:01:16.149> that<00:01:16.329> they<00:01:16.359> have<00:01:16.659> on<00:01:16.689> the<00:01:16.869> beta<00:01:17.079> right

00:01:17.309 --> 00:01:17.319 
the one that they have on the beta right

00:01:17.319 --> 00:01:19.319 
the one that they have on the beta right
now<00:01:17.469> is<00:01:17.649> called<00:01:17.859> galleon<00:01:18.399> and<00:01:18.579> I<00:01:19.060> think<00:01:19.209> it's

00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:19.329 
now is called galleon and I think it's

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:21.330 
now is called galleon and I think it's
just<00:01:19.359> great<00:01:19.959> overall<00:01:20.439> for<00:01:20.889> the<00:01:20.920> server

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
just great overall for the server

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:22.770 
just great overall for the server
community<00:01:21.939> which<00:01:22.149> is<00:01:22.270> something<00:01:22.450> that<00:01:22.600> has

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 
community which is something that has

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.139 
community which is something that has
been<00:01:22.810> dying<00:01:23.350> off<00:01:23.649> lately<00:01:23.920> in<00:01:24.249> the<00:01:24.700> game<00:01:24.909> and

00:01:25.139 --> 00:01:25.149 
been dying off lately in the game and

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:26.819

people<00:01:25.899> have<00:01:26.020> been<00:01:26.109> wanting<00:01:26.409> world<00:01:26.619> bosses

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:26.829 
people have been wanting world bosses

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:28.679 
people have been wanting world bosses
