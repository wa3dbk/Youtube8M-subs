00:00:04.412 --> 00:00:05.945
 Each business has a story. 

00:00:05.945 --> 00:00:07.807
 AdWords helps you tell your story 

00:00:07.807 --> 00:00:10.135
 The most interested people to hear; 

00:00:10.135 --> 00:00:11.580
 They are your customers. 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.414
 Regardless of the nature of your customers, 

00:00:13.414 --> 00:00:14.723
 Or where they are located, 

00:00:14.723 --> 00:00:16.779
 AdWords allows you to create ads 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:20.512
 Attract your customers to your business. 

00:00:20.512 --> 00:00:22.805
 Here are some tips on how to use AdWords 

00:00:22.805 --> 00:00:24.689
 To connect with your audience. 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.570
 Use different forms of advertising. 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.079
 Make it easy for your customers. 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:32.275
 Conduct experiments! 

00:00:32.275 --> 00:00:35.246
 Tip 1: Use different forms of advertising. 

00:00:35.246 --> 00:00:38.612
 AdWords includes more than text ads alone. 

00:00:38.612 --> 00:00:40.579
 Would you like to review a new product? 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:43.223
 Use image ads to capture people's attention 

00:00:43.223 --> 00:00:45.280
 On the Google Display Network. 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.947
 Are you looking for an attractive way to reach customers? 

00:00:47.947 --> 00:00:51.013
 Use video ads to connect with people on YouTube 

00:00:51.013 --> 00:00:53.712
 And other popular websites. 

00:00:53.712 --> 00:00:58.381
 Tip 2: Make it easier for your customers. 

00:00:58.381 --> 00:01:01.033
 Avoid placing barriers in front of your customers. 

00:01:01.033 --> 00:01:02.849
 When people click on your ad, 

00:01:02.849 --> 00:01:04.390
 They have expectations about 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.079
 What they will see. 

00:01:06.079 --> 00:01:08.562
 Start typing clear ad text 

00:01:08.562 --> 00:01:10.546
 Descriptive match with your landing page. 

00:01:10.546 --> 00:01:13.057
 Thus, if your ad promotes men's shoes 

00:01:13.057 --> 00:01:14.612
 For $ 50 or less, 

00:01:14.612 --> 00:01:17.847
 Make sure that your ad links to a page that's relevant to the topic. 

00:01:17.847 --> 00:01:20.364
 Men's shoes at prices below $ 50. 

00:01:20.364 --> 00:01:22.179
 Better to facilitate 

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:24.278
 Complete the purchase from that page. 

00:01:24.278 --> 00:01:26.746
 Since it is likely to have some customers 

00:01:26.746 --> 00:01:29.195
 If you're navigating, do not forget to write ads 

00:01:29.195 --> 00:01:32.084
 Useful across different devices. 

00:01:32.084 --> 00:01:34.279
 The easier it is for your customers 

00:01:34.279 --> 00:01:35.414
 Find what they are looking for, 

00:01:35.414 --> 00:01:38.390
 These customers are more likely to make a purchase. 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.841
 Tip 3: Conduct Experiments! 

00:01:41.841 --> 00:01:43.140
 You can not list the story of your business 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.412
 Without taking people's attention first. 

00:01:45.412 --> 00:01:47.080
 To differentiate yourself from other advertisers, 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.846
 Be sure to experiment with your messages, 

00:01:48.846 --> 00:01:49.779
 Your offers, 

00:01:49.779 --> 00:01:51.473
 And your ad formats. 

00:01:51.473 --> 00:01:53.723
 If your ad is promoting the product color 

00:01:53.723 --> 00:01:55.013
 Does not bring you the desired result, 

00:01:55.013 --> 00:01:57.586
 Try using another ad promoting the price. 

00:01:57.586 --> 00:01:59.307
 If people do not click 

00:01:59.307 --> 00:02:01.460
 Text ads, try using image ads 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:02.947
 To encourage customers to visit 

00:02:02.947 --> 00:02:04.012
 Your site. 

00:02:04.012 --> 00:02:06.396
 Let the metrics that interest you 

00:02:06.396 --> 00:02:07.806
 Guide you to the elements of good performance 

00:02:07.806 --> 00:02:09.642
 And low-performing elements. 

00:02:09.642 --> 00:02:10.678
 As well as edit your campaigns 

00:02:10.678 --> 00:02:12.446
 As far as you want to keep up 

00:02:12.446 --> 00:02:13.807
 Changes to your business 

00:02:13.807 --> 00:02:16.402
 And your customers as well. 

00:02:16.402 --> 00:02:18.045
 Do not know where exactly experimentation starts? 

00:02:18.045 --> 00:02:22.061
 Start with ads promoting your top-selling products. 

00:02:22.061 --> 00:02:23.514
 There is no doubt that the introduction of creativity 

00:02:23.514 --> 00:02:25.080
 On how to tell your business story 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.972
 Is a great way to prepare yourself for success, 

00:02:27.972 --> 00:02:31.080
 And make the most of your AdWords investment. 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.305

00:02:32.305 --> 00:02:34.348
