00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
really intense competitors yeah a little

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.970 
really intense competitors yeah a little
bit<00:00:17.910> good<00:00:18.390> I<00:00:18.750> mean<00:00:18.990> we're<00:00:19.470> the<00:00:19.619> best<00:00:19.770> team<00:00:19.859> in

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
bit good I mean we're the best team in

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.769 
bit good I mean we're the best team in
the<00:00:20.160> world<00:00:20.189> so<00:00:20.609> I<00:00:20.640> think<00:00:20.699> the<00:00:20.910> girls<00:00:21.150> are<00:00:21.449> used

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
the world so I think the girls are used

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.019 
the world so I think the girls are used
to<00:00:21.930> that<00:00:22.050> and<00:00:22.289> have<00:00:23.130> a<00:00:23.160> little<00:00:23.340> momentum<00:00:23.850> going

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
to that and have a little momentum going

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.700 
to that and have a little momentum going
in<00:00:24.269> because<00:00:24.480> we<00:00:24.600> lost<00:00:24.779> you<00:00:25.260> know<00:00:25.380> we<00:00:25.470> got<00:00:25.500> to

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
in because we lost you know we got to

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:26.960 
in because we lost you know we got to
the<00:00:25.800> final<00:00:26.160> we<00:00:26.250> just<00:00:26.400> didn't<00:00:26.580> finish<00:00:26.670> it<00:00:26.849> off

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
the final we just didn't finish it off

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.820 
the final we just didn't finish it off
so<00:00:27.210> I<00:00:27.269> think<00:00:27.330> in<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.230> back<00:00:28.349> row<00:00:28.500> heads<00:00:28.680> we

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
so I think in the back row heads we

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.919 
so I think in the back row heads we
remember<00:00:29.670> that<00:00:29.820> your<00:00:30.240> eyes<00:00:30.390> just<00:00:30.420> got<00:00:30.779> really

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
remember that your eyes just got really

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.690 
remember that your eyes just got really
big<00:00:31.170> when<00:00:31.349> you<00:00:31.470> talked<00:00:31.710> about<00:00:31.800> losing<00:00:32.309> and<00:00:32.550> how

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
big when you talked about losing and how

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.420 
big when you talked about losing and how
is<00:00:32.730> that<00:00:32.969> loss<00:00:33.390> I<00:00:33.930> can<00:00:33.960> see<00:00:34.410> it<00:00:34.559> that<00:00:35.250> one<00:00:35.399> that

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
is that loss I can see it that one that

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.670 
is that loss I can see it that one that
one<00:00:35.790> hits<00:00:35.969> home<00:00:36.120> for<00:00:36.329> sure<00:00:36.660> when<00:00:37.350> you<00:00:37.440> think

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
one hits home for sure when you think

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.139 
one hits home for sure when you think
about<00:00:37.770> that<00:00:38.100> what<00:00:38.550> are<00:00:38.670> some<00:00:38.700> of<00:00:39.030> the

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149
