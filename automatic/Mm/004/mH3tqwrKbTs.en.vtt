underground underwater we're underwater
for<00:00:24.930> pretty<00:00:25.050> much<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.320> entire<00:00:25.650> time<00:00:26.449> now

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449

water doesn't really affect vector man
too<00:00:29.310> much<00:00:29.340> it<00:00:29.670> does<00:00:29.820> slow<00:00:30.090> him<00:00:30.210> down<00:00:30.269> a<00:00:30.420> little

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
too much it does slow him down a little

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.690 
too much it does slow him down a little
bit<00:00:30.750> and<00:00:30.929> his<00:00:31.199> initial<00:00:31.830> jump<00:00:32.040> isn't<00:00:32.430> as<00:00:32.520> high

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
bit and his initial jump isn't as high

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.170 
bit and his initial jump isn't as high
but<00:00:33.540> once<00:00:33.719> you<00:00:33.840> do<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.079> second<00:00:34.440> jump<00:00:35.180> you're

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
but once you do the second jump you're

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.240 
but once you do the second jump you're
pretty<00:00:36.329> good

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:37.250 
pretty good

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.139 
pretty good
this<00:00:38.250> level<00:00:38.520> does<00:00:38.730> have<00:00:38.969> ice<00:00:39.149> physics<00:00:39.420> though

00:00:41.139 --> 00:00:41.149 
this level does have ice physics though

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:44.150 
this level does have ice physics though
that<00:00:42.149> because<00:00:42.239> you<00:00:42.480> will<00:00:42.600> slide<00:00:43.020> around<00:00:43.160> like

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
that because you will slide around like

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.580 
that because you will slide around like
an<00:00:44.280> idiot<00:00:44.660> fish<00:00:45.660> power<00:00:45.870> is<00:00:46.079> your<00:00:46.200> friend<00:00:46.410> here

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
an idiot fish power is your friend here

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:53.830 
an idiot fish power is your friend here
unfortunately<00:00:47.160> be<00:00:47.280> able<00:00:47.550> to<00:00:47.670> use<00:00:47.940> it<00:00:48.090> too<00:00:48.210> much

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:53.840 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.880 

all<00:00:54.840> right<00:00:54.899> one<00:00:55.170> more<00:00:55.289> mechanic<00:00:55.739> that<00:00:55.770> I

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
all right one more mechanic that I

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.099 
all right one more mechanic that I
failed<00:00:56.190> to<00:00:56.340> point<00:00:56.579> out<00:00:56.789> from<00:00:57.420> dr.<00:00:57.719> Mann<00:00:57.870> is

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
failed to point out from dr. Mann is

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.680 
failed to point out from dr. Mann is
that<00:00:58.680> his<00:00:59.520> double<00:00:59.850> jump<00:01:00.059> is<00:01:00.239> actually<00:01:00.660> a

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
that his double jump is actually a

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.510 
that his double jump is actually a
damaging<00:01:01.199> attack<00:01:01.500> if<00:01:01.739> you<00:01:01.800> do<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.340> double

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
damaging attack if you do the double

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.060 
damaging attack if you do the double
jump<00:01:02.850> above<00:01:03.239> an<00:01:03.449> enemy<00:01:03.719> little<00:01:04.530> Jets<00:01:04.799> will

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
jump above an enemy little Jets will

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.920 
jump above an enemy little Jets will
actually<00:01:05.519> cause<00:01:05.939> damage<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.510> enemies<00:01:06.780> now

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
actually cause damage to the enemies now

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.020 
actually cause damage to the enemies now
most<00:01:07.140> enemies<00:01:07.500> aren't<00:01:08.040> killed<00:01:08.310> in<00:01:08.400> one<00:01:08.549> hit<00:01:08.760> so

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
most enemies aren't killed in one hit so

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.359 
most enemies aren't killed in one hit so
that's<00:01:09.330> not<00:01:09.450> really<00:01:09.630> too<00:01:09.840> much<00:01:09.930> of<00:01:10.080> a<00:01:10.140> help<00:01:10.369> but

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
that's not really too much of a help but

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.100 
that's not really too much of a help but
it<00:01:11.729> will<00:01:11.939> come<00:01:12.150> in<00:01:12.240> handy<00:01:12.390> later<00:01:12.570> on<00:01:12.840> when

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
it will come in handy later on when

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:19.520 
it will come in handy later on when
there's

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.350

this level is a vertical level we're
ascending<00:01:26.370> our<00:01:26.520> way<00:01:26.670> to<00:01:26.730> the<00:01:26.940> very<00:01:27.060> top<00:01:27.150> and

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.110 
mostly these little mines aren't you
know<00:01:31.380> aren't<00:01:31.680> too<00:01:31.740> much<00:01:31.860> trouble<00:01:32.040> but<00:01:32.880> as<00:01:33.000> you

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:33.120 
know aren't too much trouble but as you

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:38.330 
know aren't too much trouble but as you
can<00:01:33.210> see<00:01:33.270> this<00:01:33.540> bubble<00:01:33.930> monsters<00:01:34.820> dicks<00:01:37.340> we

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
can see this bubble monsters dicks we

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.620 
can see this bubble monsters dicks we
have<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.550> rapid-fire<00:01:38.880> gun<00:01:39.210> which<00:01:39.330> is<00:01:39.360> pretty

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
have the rapid-fire gun which is pretty

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.340 
have the rapid-fire gun which is pretty
cool<00:01:40.310> and<00:01:41.310> only<00:01:41.520> two<00:01:41.700> hits<00:01:41.910> which<00:01:42.360> is<00:01:42.510> not<00:01:42.660> not

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
cool and only two hits which is not not

cool and only two hits which is not not
cool

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:43.800

knuckles<00:01:44.160> at<00:01:44.220> all<00:01:45.350> you<00:01:46.350> are<00:01:46.470> given<00:01:46.710> a<00:01:46.770> lot<00:01:46.920> of

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
knuckles at all you are given a lot of

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.730 
knuckles at all you are given a lot of
time<00:01:47.250> to<00:01:47.400> beat<00:01:47.550> this<00:01:47.670> level<00:01:47.729> though<00:01:48.090> which<00:01:48.270> is

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
time to beat this level though which is

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:54.040 
time to beat this level though which is
beginner<00:01:49.740> as<00:01:49.920> far<00:01:50.190> as<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.310> game<00:01:50.490> is<00:01:51.000> concerned

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.050 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:57.290 

I<00:01:55.190> think<00:01:56.190> I<00:01:56.490> should<00:01:56.670> mention<00:01:56.820> also<00:01:57.119> that

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:57.300 
I think I should mention also that

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.090 
I think I should mention also that
people<00:01:57.660> are<00:01:57.780> requesting<00:01:58.050> things<00:01:58.410> like<00:01:58.770> doing

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
people are requesting things like doing

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.300 
people are requesting things like doing
no<00:01:59.250> photon<00:01:59.790> though<00:02:00.240> like<00:02:01.050> a<00:02:01.110> pacifist<00:02:01.619> no<00:02:01.979> TV

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
no photon though like a pacifist no TV

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.100 
no photon though like a pacifist no TV
run<00:02:02.520> I<00:02:02.729> might<00:02:03.540> do<00:02:03.660> that<00:02:05.330> you<00:02:06.330> know<00:02:06.420> some<00:02:06.810> levels

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
run I might do that you know some levels

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
could just basically go straight up this

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.240 
could just basically go straight up this
level<00:03:22.690> and<00:03:22.870> beat<00:03:23.079> it<00:03:23.170> pretty<00:03:23.410> quickly<00:03:23.620> but<00:03:23.980> I'm

on my Sega Genesis I didn't have that

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:05.830 
on my Sega Genesis I didn't have that
kind<00:04:57.830> of<00:04:57.890> help<00:05:02.590> this<00:05:03.590> is<00:05:03.770> just<00:05:04.240> it<00:05:05.240> is<00:05:05.420> a<00:05:05.450> secret

kind of help this is just it is a secret
passageway<00:05:06.200> but<00:05:06.680> it's<00:05:06.830> kind<00:05:07.250> of<00:05:07.310> a<00:05:07.370> way<00:05:07.460> to

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:07.520 
passageway but it's kind of a way to

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.450 
passageway but it's kind of a way to
bypass<00:05:07.760> the<00:05:08.180> last<00:05:08.360> part<00:05:08.600> of<00:05:08.630> level<00:05:08.780> there<00:05:09.460> we

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:10.460 
bypass the last part of level there we

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.310 
bypass the last part of level there we
make<00:05:10.700> it<00:05:10.820> to<00:05:10.940> the<00:05:11.030> top<00:05:11.240> and<00:05:11.510> we<00:05:12.110> get<00:05:12.230> another

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:12.320 
make it to the top and we get another

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:15.910 
make it to the top and we get another
checkpoint<00:05:13.040> and<00:05:13.460> it's<00:05:13.910> lost<00:05:14.120> time<00:05:14.680> this<00:05:15.680> boss

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:15.920 
checkpoint and it's lost time this boss

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:18.480 
checkpoint and it's lost time this boss
has<00:05:15.950> two<00:05:16.340> forms<00:05:16.610> the<00:05:16.850> first<00:05:17.030> form<00:05:17.270> is<00:05:17.390> this<00:05:17.630> I

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:18.490 
has two forms the first form is this I

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:21.630 
has two forms the first form is this I
guess<00:05:19.490> it's<00:05:19.640> like<00:05:19.730> a<00:05:19.820> pelican<00:05:20.120> for<00:05:20.690> the<00:05:20.750> tail

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:21.640 
guess it's like a pelican for the tail

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:26.260 
guess it's like a pelican for the tail
it<00:05:22.640> shoots<00:05:22.880> balls<00:05:23.810> of<00:05:23.990> energy<00:05:24.290> at<00:05:24.440> you<00:05:24.730> and<00:05:25.730> I'm

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:26.270 
it shoots balls of energy at you and I'm

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:27.430 
it shoots balls of energy at you and I'm
totally<00:05:26.540> going<00:05:26.870> about<00:05:27.020> it<00:05:27.140> the<00:05:27.170> wrong<00:05:27.380> way

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:27.440 
totally going about it the wrong way

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:32.050 
totally going about it the wrong way
this<00:05:28.370> is<00:05:29.980> basically<00:05:30.980> just<00:05:31.070> follow<00:05:31.430> underneath

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:32.060 
this is basically just follow underneath

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:33.970 
this is basically just follow underneath
of<00:05:32.180> it<00:05:32.270> and<00:05:32.330> shoot<00:05:32.780> it<00:05:32.930> as<00:05:33.050> it<00:05:33.290> flies<00:05:33.500> by<00:05:33.710> you

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:33.980 
of it and shoot it as it flies by you

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:35.110 
of it and shoot it as it flies by you
want<00:05:34.220> to<00:05:34.280> get<00:05:34.370> all<00:05:34.490> the<00:05:34.610> way<00:05:34.700> to<00:05:34.730> the<00:05:34.940> other<00:05:35.030> end

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:35.120 
want to get all the way to the other end

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.700 
want to get all the way to the other end
of<00:05:35.270> the<00:05:35.390> screen<00:05:35.600> or<00:05:36.020> else<00:05:36.170> you'll<00:05:36.380> end<00:05:36.530> up<00:05:36.590> in

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:36.710 
of the screen or else you'll end up in

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:38.920 
of the screen or else you'll end up in
front<00:05:36.920> of<00:05:36.980> it<00:05:37.130> and<00:05:37.400> that's<00:05:38.300> not<00:05:38.510> good<00:05:38.720> like

good fortunately however we have an

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.510 
good fortunately however we have an
invincibility<00:05:54.380> a<00:05:54.770> few<00:05:55.100> frames<00:05:55.400> of

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:55.520 
invincibility a few frames of

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:59.170 
invincibility a few frames of
invincibility<00:05:55.970> allocated<00:05:56.900> so<00:05:58.180> otherwise

00:05:59.170 --> 00:05:59.180 
invincibility allocated so otherwise

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:05.680 
invincibility allocated so otherwise
that<00:05:59.360> could<00:05:59.450> have<00:05:59.570> been<00:05:59.630> disastrous<00:06:03.850> I<00:06:04.850> wasted

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:05.690 
that could have been disastrous I wasted

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:13.630 
that could have been disastrous I wasted
time<00:06:05.870> doing<00:06:06.080> bonuses<00:06:06.620> oh<00:06:12.190> come<00:06:13.190> on<00:06:13.340> won't<00:06:13.520> you

die<00:06:13.820> I<00:06:16.120> think<00:06:17.120> the<00:06:17.210> problem<00:06:17.570> is<00:06:17.690> that<00:06:17.720> I<00:06:17.960> took

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:18.020 
die I think the problem is that I took

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:20.380 
die I think the problem is that I took
the<00:06:18.320> secret<00:06:18.680> path<00:06:19.340> out<00:06:19.610> which<00:06:19.910> is<00:06:20.060> kind<00:06:20.240> of<00:06:20.330> the

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:20.390 
the secret path out which is kind of the

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:22.930 
the secret path out which is kind of the
cheaters<00:06:20.690> way<00:06:20.840> and<00:06:21.320> you<00:06:21.980> don't<00:06:22.100> get<00:06:22.250> access<00:06:22.670> to

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:22.940 
cheaters way and you don't get access to

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:24.610 
cheaters way and you don't get access to
a<00:06:23.480> special<00:06:23.690> gun<00:06:24.020> I'm<00:06:24.170> pretty<00:06:24.350> sure<00:06:24.470> there's<00:06:24.590> a

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:24.620 
a special gun I'm pretty sure there's a

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:25.860 
a special gun I'm pretty sure there's a
special<00:06:24.950> gun<00:06:25.100> if<00:06:25.250> you<00:06:25.280> take<00:06:25.460> the<00:06:25.580> left<00:06:25.790> path

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:25.870 
special gun if you take the left path

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:27.760 
special gun if you take the left path
anyway<00:06:26.870> the<00:06:26.960> bird<00:06:27.110> is<00:06:27.230> dead<00:06:27.380> we're<00:06:27.590> on<00:06:27.680> the

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:27.770 
anyway the bird is dead we're on the

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:29.590 
anyway the bird is dead we're on the
second<00:06:28.070> form<00:06:28.220> which<00:06:28.310> is<00:06:28.430> a<00:06:28.460> bear<00:06:28.700> slightly

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:29.600 
second form which is a bear slightly

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:31.060 
second form which is a bear slightly
more<00:06:29.750> difficult<00:06:29.840> that<00:06:30.350> like<00:06:30.500> a<00:06:30.590> pelican<00:06:30.770> or

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:31.070 
more difficult that like a pelican or

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:33.760 
more difficult that like a pelican or
anything<00:06:31.250> but<00:06:31.700> not<00:06:31.880> that<00:06:32.030> much<00:06:32.470> he<00:06:33.470> does<00:06:33.620> two

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:33.770 
anything but not that much he does two

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:35.050 
anything but not that much he does two
attacks<00:06:34.070> he'll<00:06:34.310> stand<00:06:34.490> up<00:06:34.670> and<00:06:34.820> throw<00:06:35.030> a

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:35.060 
attacks he'll stand up and throw a

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:36.820 
attacks he'll stand up and throw a
spread<00:06:35.390> fire<00:06:35.690> like<00:06:35.960> that<00:06:35.990> if<00:06:36.440> you<00:06:36.530> just<00:06:36.680> duck

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:36.830 
spread fire like that if you just duck

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:37.709 
spread fire like that if you just duck
underneath<00:06:37.100> myth

00:06:37.709 --> 00:06:37.719 
underneath myth

00:06:37.719 --> 00:06:39.239 
underneath myth
and<00:06:37.959> then<00:06:38.080> while<00:06:38.229> he's<00:06:38.349> crawling<00:06:38.619> he<00:06:38.949> shoots

00:06:39.239 --> 00:06:39.249 
and then while he's crawling he shoots

00:06:39.249 --> 00:06:40.799 
and then while he's crawling he shoots
them<00:06:39.429> along<00:06:39.699> the<00:06:39.819> ground<00:06:40.029> it's<00:06:40.269> easier<00:06:40.569> to<00:06:40.689> get

00:06:40.799 --> 00:06:40.809 
them along the ground it's easier to get

00:06:40.809 --> 00:06:47.959 
them along the ground it's easier to get
behind<00:06:40.929> the<00:06:41.169> thing<00:06:41.379> and<00:06:41.679> shoot<00:06:42.099> it<00:06:42.189> that<00:06:42.339> way

00:06:47.959 --> 00:06:47.969 

00:06:47.969 --> 00:06:50.939 

anyway<00:06:48.969> that's<00:06:49.239> it<00:06:49.389> I<00:06:49.629> have<00:06:50.379> killed<00:06:50.619> both<00:06:50.889> of

00:06:50.939 --> 00:06:50.949 
anyway that's it I have killed both of

00:06:50.949 --> 00:06:53.249
