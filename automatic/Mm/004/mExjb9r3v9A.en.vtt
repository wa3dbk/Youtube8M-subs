00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.390
 on the 12th july the first test game of 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.340
 Hannover 96 in the summer preparation 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:11.250
 take place and the whole in favor of the 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.049
 robert enke foundation in the context of a 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.420
 Press talk in the cafÃ© homesick 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.029
 Teresa Enke informed everyone 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.090
 about the meaning of the game for me 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:24.480
 as chairman of the foundation and for the 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:29.039
 Foundation very very big 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:32.880
 meaning because it is connected to the 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:35.399
 But the foundation of hannover 96 also shows 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.250
 the attachment to my deceased 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:41.160
 man and that's why I'm just Hanover 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.309
 Most of all, mr martin kinder 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.690
 is also in the Foundation Council of the foundation 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:48.600
 I am very thankful that you 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.480
 testify this game for the foundation 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.120
 her first official game of the season 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.120
 Next to Teresa Enke was also our goalkeeper 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.570
 markus miller himself 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.489
 member of the board of the robert-enke 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.000
 foundation is allrounder and defense 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.670
 Christian Schulz is present and school 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.770
 convinced of this special 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.540
 Charity game so first time I think 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.030
 I'm super that the club is ready 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.650
 you have declared all the proceeds 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.189
 the game for the foundation claims to 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.470
 do 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:19.080
 that is really a nice thing for us 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.610
 Of course, the first game comes to me 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.189
 think there's a double thing 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.450
 meaning 

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:26.970
 We will first with our first 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:30.000
 new formations then run aground 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.460
 always interesting for those for 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.890
 the spectators and fans with the good 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.409
 Another side effect is that it is for the 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.980
