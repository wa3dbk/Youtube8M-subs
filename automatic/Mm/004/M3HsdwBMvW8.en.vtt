00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:21.180
 Can you make money with fashion? 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.529
 I got there on Friday that I won. 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.070
 money I do not think this is the 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:28.770
 better career unless you 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.630
 make a good blogger is not 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.850
 joking because it really is a 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.070
 very profitable profession if you do 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.390
 right if you have the lucky dose there 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.730
 also that everyone needs to have 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.040
 thing coming but so I think it has 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.870
 a specific area that people feel 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.910
 few people but these few people 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.190
 are very successful and choose their 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.260
 jobs that are the great teams, right? 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.770
 it is then if you arrive at map level 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.420
 flÃ¡via Lafer at stages today 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.059
 She works a battle but she 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.449
 for a long time it was filan be it 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.969
 today is very successful and I think it did 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.999
 there a considerable sweaty money and 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:09.179
 deserved and the glamor also began 

00:01:05.999 --> 00:01:12.060
 with a very different thing that is you 

00:01:09.179 --> 00:01:15.060
 You can send a message by potes ap plague 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.459
 love is not very strange and explains 18 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.009
 mental is very strong very cool is very 

00:01:17.459 --> 00:01:21.359
 future right so much future in us 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.549
 It's true, I think we have a 

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:24.719
 team today, let's stay a while 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.039
 undefined because we can invent 

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:27.209
 Now, what can we do? 

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:28.349
 No one did what we're going to do. 

00:01:27.209 --> 00:01:30.479
 so this is an obsessive thing 

00:01:28.349 --> 00:01:31.999
 even so from the essay and it's very cool 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.979
 when I see all the girls 

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:38.340
 thus participating in this same objective 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:40.439
 what zap actually has two newspapers 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.200
 started doing it here in Brazil and the 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.179
 glamor was really by the magazine is the 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.880
 to do in Brazil because we have 

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:49.459
 really a tradition and a will of 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.959
 itha closer and closer to the reader 

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:54.539
 find love came to the domestic market already 

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:56.459
 with this purpose of how to create this 

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:57.869
 link to the reader 

00:01:56.459 --> 00:02:00.090
 that I find something missing between 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.849
 the magazines of the magazines were 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.880
 few distance is from the reader in the 

00:02:02.849 --> 00:02:08.960
 level so that you have totally lost 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:11.330
 there it was in that and it is this scenario 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.830
 and I'll tell you, and then you'll do it, then. 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.690
 created a very cold relationship very 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.700
 impersonal you do not know who did 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.770
 magazine and I think that this too is 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.360
 open a space for blogs 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.520
 grow but because this is the blog 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.410
 contrary to this, everything is a text in 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.270
 super first person you need to have is 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:29.270
 interpersonal opinion 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:31.880
 Do you know who you are doing? 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:35.540
 I think the globe was lucky to be born 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:37.550
 at a time when it was very clear 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.190
 so the editorial world asked for this 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:43.790
 proximity to bloggers they started 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:46.070
 to grow 45 years old and glamor her 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.260
 always hugged the bloggers what 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:52.400
 The first is rather a first 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:54.260
 good blogger for you, look, I think 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.630
 people ask a lot of it, right? 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.070
 difference between the work of the 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:01.520
 journalistic work I think the 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:03.020
 she does not necessarily have one 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.370
 blocking a good journalist journalist 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:06.470
 a blogger because I think it's two 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.210
 completely different codes 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.940
 I think making a fool is a 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:13.010
 blogger who have a discipline right 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:16.040
 that is, it has a constancy of 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.900
 she has a posts on a face 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.780
 really that as a job 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:23.480
 important is professional us and have a 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.920
 regularity does not lead to pt is from 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.000
 her from readers 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:30.740
 I think it's a professional who 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.240
 makes it very clear to your reading what 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:34.160
 is an editorial content of content 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:36.410
 with water is what is an audience that your 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.480
 principle not only of journalism 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:40.610
 the world and the life of skeptics and 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.860
 transparent with what you are 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:46.880
 putting it there I think it's fundamental 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:48.950
 and I think you are very curious so 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:51.050
 is this curiosity is something that the 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:52.790
 people should never be surprised 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:55.220
 with the costanza pascolato did not say that 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:57.410
 and I think so is my mantra is you 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.300
 can not lose curiosity is fine 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:01.160
 interesting you have a blog that has 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:02.750
 there it can be a generalist blog 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.850
 you can deal with various subjects but 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:06.740
 you be recognized for one thing is 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:08.570
 very cool or for the love you're wearing 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:11.210
 your texts or your photos 

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:13.400
 wonderful photos or 

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:15.590
 accessories and does every day you have a 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.299
 a registered mark that people 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:19.580
 easily recognize 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:21.770
 It's so cool that it's higher today. 

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:24.390
 blogs the instagram fans 

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:27.020
 I think the instagram undoubtedly 

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:29.250
 none was the media that revolutionized 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:32.100
 drastically the way we see each other 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:35.220
 The way we're formed I think 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:37.230
 It's the ball of the time it's so I was 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.820
 Blog reader with little free time 

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:40.320
 that I have I have to have the edital that 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:42.690
 I'm going to read is the son they chose 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.880
 to see everything so I'm reading now 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.990
 every one caught me reading less and less blogs 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:49.050
 he reported that more and more conquest 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:51.950
 great for me today is a media is 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.950
 greater importance
