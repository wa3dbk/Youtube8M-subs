00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:04.620
 Hello my dear against Juppé friends around not the Kentix for the well-groomed 

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:09.580
 and I would be a little bit the game today before bringing closer 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.479
 in two new little gameplay 

00:00:12.479 --> 00:00:15.599
 as we can see you had one night character slots 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:17.730
 use 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.159
 the lap times are still occupied 

00:00:20.159 --> 00:00:22.210
 around 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.460
 yes the highest level the Manning is what GM 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.200
 of it could be that the music of online role-playing games and 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:33.319
 to play the dignified with many Branson two together so 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.150
 the Owen again 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:40.150
 you can not see the cities outside because 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.850
 There the animals do not see 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.800
 in front of im you can only reach level 20 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.530
 to VideoWeb corner of the much higher 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.510
 Ai is it's that's not so much about life but more about Krafts 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.060
 Do missions and so on and so on blah blah blah 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.280
 Dr you can guest the cities for the customers 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.100
 Ben and so on 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.900
 and there is the extension Specs for the forest so 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.870
 you can buy a scaffold and then learn a rescue chain to every one 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:21.650
 confidently can alone play time out on the ORF because there could be first stage 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:26.960
 ten obstacles nerve extension to Ms. Prof that this is I can 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.610
 of which each city extend 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:30.170
 so from everyone 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:31.850
 Extension Spec 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:33.140
 Kylie off 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.440
 I would just show it for a moment 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:41.150
 What they could do so here a PvP Kate could fixed environment bläk 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.130
 opposite 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.130
 other players are playing fighting and so on 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.450
 and scout role-playing could do 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.480
 there you can 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:52.770
 hehe read 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:53.970
 the face 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.340
 and Scout color could ultimately select also hehe read so completely 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.400
 perhaps 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.670
 thanks to the head 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.220
 could also levitate something on the head 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.850
 for example masks, there is something for MS man 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.679
 and so on 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:10.049
 Here the body size could determine between the red sparks 

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:11.119
 could choose 

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:13.549
 I am not one 

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:16.549
 and all the things could be designed individually here 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:23.439
 a chain of noticeable names will now give them playful optics or something 

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:28.079
 yes, and then you could start by simply starting the campaign 

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:28.690
 Has 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.470
 apa / red but between campaign changes but he would have to because 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:33.769
 the first 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:36.980
 they attested, as it were, from Dr Kompanie 

00:02:37.679 --> 00:02:41.069
 not to do et cetera workers with nem 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:44.609
 Character of mine Kim is just the heli-witch to 20 years 

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:46.549
 they are always here 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:48.070
 and go to the harvest 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:49.779
 and the Helaba races 

00:02:49.779 --> 00:02:52.940
 with the two roofs wheat unanimous with the widest but 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.610
 this suffering not so far a stubborn little bit what is short 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:59.720
 Just to show envy and because the study authored quite open therefore 

00:03:01.219 --> 00:03:04.219
 Macy's focus with this one 

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:08.629
 this animal already a the other player 

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:11.379
 the well-stocked 

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:13.499
 around IZ slightly different player 

00:03:13.499 --> 00:03:14.789
 again we pray 

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:17.329
 can you see 

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:19.419
 and she has heroes so 

00:03:19.419 --> 00:03:20.790
 you can do that later 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.989
 the clique that later makes costs jealous with stuffy first compulsions 

00:03:24.919 --> 00:03:28.120
 With her, he just gets different heroes in the course of the game 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.120
 they could all do it 

00:03:31.719 --> 00:03:34.259
 so 

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:35.150
 not all 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.060
 but he made Stanley of seven more heroes of the 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:39.749
 there are also fellows 

00:03:39.749 --> 00:03:42.939
 he could, for example, make heroes out of my jeopardy 

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:46.909
 around Mannheim I was so tired my helmet ranks 

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:52.540
 Handyman could give her something to the hoped-for classes of cardiac SE 

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:55.989
 the Attribute menu is Wild Card 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:57.339
 or Mr. 

00:03:57.339 --> 00:04:00.169
 for the help of your abilities 

00:04:00.169 --> 00:04:02.829
 differently he sends 

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:05.920
 and so on, how can you get some elite skills? 

00:04:05.919 --> 00:04:07.309
 to rest in the yellow 

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:09.259
 so that you 

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:12.259
 then he could cost them so the criticism of opponents 

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:17.000
 then, here, skills take care of all animals, like me 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.779
 could now 

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:22.309
 give Lexmark again here IT can keep the year countries take Exten 

00:04:22.309 --> 00:04:24.479
 Course could not change that 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:27.800
 Emmi since the dam is a bit pay and that is only one 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.319
 certain body endgame 

00:04:30.319 --> 00:04:33.620
 yes then he has sound 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.069
 there it stands, for example 

00:04:35.069 --> 00:04:38.259
 For example, if you do not want to drink so much, you simply deposit it for a hundred 

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:39.729
 gold 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:43.800
 which players still show the Wars with the other characters 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.979
 To force Minnemann to make a cocktail the man can be anywhere in any city 

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:51.419
 because there is not a list because it can be easily retrieved and 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:54.180
 where you can not go yet 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.390
 there's no need to get that out and then it's him 

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:00.289
 simply for example so weapons b 

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:02.159
 around 

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:04.680
 the open and have mine 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.020
 grade seals top 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:10.919
 to find here with Ari might want to make it yes I have now has none 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:14.629
 Bag but then you can carry more and more things is not always 

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:19.249
 right back to Drewer and the stored in it and if anything good 

00:05:19.249 --> 00:05:23.559
 then you can do quests around the app this is Sissi movies quests 

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:29.199
 yes, I am now standing firm 

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:32.059
 Area gone 

00:05:32.059 --> 00:05:34.539
 the shipowner 

00:05:34.539 --> 00:05:37.539
 I wanted to go back there but then I went 2 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:39.379
 be there 

00:05:39.379 --> 00:05:41.470
 it's pretty much the branch 

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:44.470
 the hardest hangout percent 

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:46.310
 the lead wolf 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:49.129
 so this whole map from far ahead 

00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:52.490
 the guys here and we are class here 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:56.260
 and now Ligety Force and everyone here so there are always a damn lot 

00:05:56.259 --> 00:05:57.330
 player 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:00.319
 there was the skilled factory mechanic which season and water skiing 

00:06:00.319 --> 00:06:01.999
 winter proof here 

00:06:01.999 --> 00:06:02.979
 around 

00:06:02.979 --> 00:06:06.009
 only at Christmas is so cool here 

00:06:06.009 --> 00:06:08.009
 Christmas decorations everywhere 

00:06:08.009 --> 00:06:12.870
 and percent of Easter Easter decorations for Halloween Halloween stuff and so on 

00:06:12.869 --> 00:06:15.879
 then you distributed it so "He came alone made 60 x 

00:06:16.569 --> 00:06:20.409
 but here you are, you see, here are around the box full of relocated a bunch 

00:06:20.409 --> 00:06:22.819
 People 

00:06:22.819 --> 00:06:26.180
 So really should be running 

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:29.180
 so it might make sense if in Frankenau «Mavs» 

00:06:29.839 --> 00:06:31.150
 then yes 

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:34.090
 For example, Katja could take the money back with her 

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:37.160
 Any character editor all around also in other countries 

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:39.409
 campaigns 

00:06:39.409 --> 00:06:42.749
 For example, how she can easily get full if she has the infection around her 

00:06:42.749 --> 00:06:45.919
 the tour pays the same amount of money for the day as it does here 

00:06:45.919 --> 00:06:47.449
 so 

00:06:47.449 --> 00:06:51.389
 it is your true of every day of friendship and Zambia could as well 

00:06:51.389 --> 00:06:52.139
 all 

00:06:52.139 --> 00:06:55.490
 skillfully change weapons at the same time take over good weapon finds the for 

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:57.529
 Nanocat well off you 

00:06:57.529 --> 00:07:00.949
 then you can just around here 

00:07:00.949 --> 00:07:02.169
 collect the 

00:07:02.169 --> 00:07:05.830
 So the lay there in the box and with the AMC he had then record there 

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:07.659
 the weapon 

00:07:07.659 --> 00:07:09.339
 yes make Reken quests 

00:07:09.339 --> 00:07:11.229
 it lures 

00:07:11.229 --> 00:07:14.949
 Beate Merk Weststeirer must do to get ahead 

00:07:14.949 --> 00:07:18.210
 it's all right with me against the destroyers I have to do 

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:20.300
 do war danger us points 

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:22.690
 and gold or other professional points 

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:26.419
 with the then you by the particular peoples a lady court concert 

00:07:26.419 --> 00:07:29.960
 to report conversions Moyes and salt can buy 

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:33.050
 there's the normal quests in different areas 

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:36.149
 Here you see if that is free and if now the compulsory military service 

00:07:36.149 --> 00:07:39.069
 but he has it with him 

00:07:39.069 --> 00:07:40.830
 he himself "Such a star 

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:43.219
 the CD then also here if you come closer 

00:07:43.219 --> 00:07:46.219
 the organist has a look away 

00:07:47.249 --> 00:07:51.249
 then explain a bunch of panda quests here you can get me 

00:07:51.249 --> 00:07:54.379
 they did not do anything because I can go 4 percent 

00:07:54.379 --> 00:07:56.659
 Friedman accepted for the Meppener 

00:07:56.659 --> 00:07:59.979
 the Kita for example new heroes in this quest 10 may 

00:08:00.899 --> 00:08:03.449
 who brought for me no idea why 

00:08:03.449 --> 00:08:05.770
 Michel is going to be Bayer Christine's downfall
