00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:26.260 
a crawler and you want to try it do in

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.050 
a crawler and you want to try it do in

as<00:01:53.470> far<00:01:53.500> as<00:01:53.770> this<00:01:53.890> gun<00:01:54.130> goes<00:01:54.400> the<00:01:54.790> Wunderwaffe

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:55.180 
as far as this gun goes the Wunderwaffe

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.750 
as far as this gun goes the Wunderwaffe
it's<00:01:55.570> good<00:01:56.050> but<00:01:56.590> as<00:01:56.740> far<00:01:56.890> as<00:01:56.950> the<00:01:57.100> practicality

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:57.760 
it's good but as far as the practicality

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.010 
it's good but as far as the practicality
of<00:01:57.790> it<00:01:57.880> goes<00:01:58.030> on<00:01:58.150> this<00:01:58.300> map<00:01:58.480> it's<00:01:58.780> kind<00:01:58.960> of

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
of it goes on this map it's kind of

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.050 
of it goes on this map it's kind of
questionable<00:01:59.440> so<00:01:59.710> this<00:01:59.920> is<00:02:00.040> really<00:02:00.220> just<00:02:00.340> for

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
questionable so this is really just for

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.420 
questionable so this is really just for
the<00:02:01.180> for<00:02:01.540> the<00:02:01.570> fun<00:02:01.980> after<00:02:02.980> you've<00:02:03.100> destroyed

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.430 
the for the fun after you've destroyed

all those four things you're going to go

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:05.550 
all those four things you're going to go
back<00:02:04.630> and<00:02:04.660> knife<00:02:04.900> the<00:02:05.050> door<00:02:05.200> again<00:02:05.410> and

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
back and knife the door again and

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.009 
back and knife the door again and
they're<00:02:05.980> going<00:02:06.130> to<00:02:06.340> tell<00:02:07.210> you<00:02:07.330> another<00:02:07.540> little

they're going to tell you another little
annoying<00:02:08.590> thing<00:02:08.979> to<00:02:09.069> go<00:02:09.190> do<00:02:09.399> and<00:02:09.640> this<00:02:10.239> is<00:02:10.300> a

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
annoying thing to go do and this is a

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:12.000 
annoying thing to go do and this is a
little<00:02:10.660> bit<00:02:10.840> difficult<00:02:11.019> sometimes<00:02:11.500> for<00:02:11.830> some

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
little bit difficult sometimes for some

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.550 
little bit difficult sometimes for some
reason<00:02:12.400> these<00:02:12.550> these<00:02:13.299> controls<00:02:13.840> are<00:02:14.019> a<00:02:14.260> little

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
reason these these controls are a little

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.289 
reason these these controls are a little
bit<00:02:14.739> iffy<00:02:15.040> and<00:02:15.280> for<00:02:15.819> those<00:02:15.879> of<00:02:15.939> you<00:02:16.090> don't<00:02:16.239> know

00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:16.299 
bit iffy and for those of you don't know

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:18.330 
bit iffy and for those of you don't know
you<00:02:16.359> press<00:02:16.629> x<00:02:16.900> 2<00:02:17.200> up<00:02:17.230> to<00:02:17.769> activate<00:02:18.189> them

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
you press x 2 up to activate them

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.930 
you press x 2 up to activate them
there's<00:02:18.579> mine

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
there's mine

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.390 
there's mine
I think<00:02:19.180> out<00:02:19.270> of<00:02:19.300> frustration<00:02:19.770> if<00:02:20.770> you<00:02:21.130> can't

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
I think out of frustration if you can't

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.610 
I think out of frustration if you can't
get<00:02:21.550> it<00:02:21.610> to<00:02:21.820> tick<00:02:22.060> don't<00:02:22.720> worry<00:02:22.900> it'll<00:02:23.140> work<00:02:23.350> so

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
get it to tick don't worry it'll work so

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:24.780 
get it to tick don't worry it'll work so
what<00:02:23.770> you<00:02:23.830> need<00:02:23.950> to<00:02:24.010> do<00:02:24.160> is<00:02:24.280> turn<00:02:24.430> the<00:02:24.580> steering

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
what you need to do is turn the steering

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.250 
what you need to do is turn the steering
wheel<00:02:24.940> to<00:02:25.330> to<00:02:25.510> the<00:02:25.600> right<00:02:25.780> you'll<00:02:26.020> see<00:02:26.080> that

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
wheel to to the right you'll see that

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.040 
wheel to to the right you'll see that
that<00:02:26.410> one<00:02:26.730> prong<00:02:27.730> is<00:02:28.060> red<00:02:28.450> and<00:02:28.690> the<00:02:28.780> other<00:02:28.810> ones

pointing<00:02:30.670> down<00:02:30.970> into<00:02:31.270> the<00:02:31.360> right<00:02:31.540> and<00:02:31.810> just

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
pointing down into the right and just

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.980 
pointing down into the right and just
keep<00:02:32.950> trying<00:02:33.190> it's<00:02:34.150> not<00:02:34.300> really<00:02:34.450> difficult<00:02:34.900> to

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:34.990 
keep trying it's not really difficult to

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:36.300 
keep trying it's not really difficult to
get<00:02:35.110> those<00:02:35.200> things<00:02:35.350> to<00:02:35.500> turn<00:02:35.680> and<00:02:35.920> now<00:02:36.070> you're

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
get those things to turn and now you're

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.400 
get those things to turn and now you're
of<00:02:36.370> these<00:02:36.550> two<00:02:36.850> these<00:02:36.940> levers<00:02:37.240> you<00:02:37.540> turn<00:02:38.380> down

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
of these two these levers you turn down

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.680 
of these two these levers you turn down
this<00:02:38.770> one<00:02:38.950> to<00:02:39.040> the<00:02:39.130> far<00:02:39.370> right<00:02:39.640> three<00:02:40.060> times<00:02:40.330> I

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
this one to the far right three times I

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:41.910 
this one to the far right three times I
made<00:02:41.020> a<00:02:41.050> mistake<00:02:41.200> here<00:02:41.560> and<00:02:41.650> only<00:02:41.710> did<00:02:41.890> it

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
made a mistake here and only did it

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.070 
made a mistake here and only did it
twice<00:02:42.070> so<00:02:42.370> it<00:02:42.460> didn't<00:02:42.700> work<00:02:42.880> and<00:02:43.090> the<00:02:43.840> ones<00:02:43.990> of

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
twice so it didn't work and the ones of

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.930 
twice so it didn't work and the ones of
the<00:02:44.140> far<00:02:44.320> left<00:02:44.500> once<00:02:44.770> and<00:02:45.100> you're<00:02:45.280> I'm<00:02:45.760> gonna

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
the far left once and you're I'm gonna

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.370 
the far left once and you're I'm gonna
begin<00:02:46.120> here<00:02:46.330> right<00:02:46.480> now<00:02:46.660> but<00:02:46.840> if<00:02:46.990> you<00:02:47.140> do<00:02:47.260> it

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
begin here right now but if you do it

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.590 
begin here right now but if you do it
wrong<00:02:47.590> it<00:02:48.430> will<00:02:48.550> actually<00:02:48.700> start<00:02:49.210> doing<00:02:49.360> a

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
wrong it will actually start doing a

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.180 
wrong it will actually start doing a
beeping<00:02:49.990> sound<00:02:50.050> to<00:02:50.470> kind<00:02:50.650> of<00:02:50.710> tell<00:02:50.920> you<00:02:51.070> that

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
beeping sound to kind of tell you that

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:52.740 
beeping sound to kind of tell you that
you're<00:02:51.280> on<00:02:51.370> the<00:02:51.460> right<00:02:51.610> track<00:02:51.640> but<00:02:52.450> you<00:02:52.570> did<00:02:52.720> it

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
you're on the right track but you did it

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.720 
you're on the right track but you did it
wrong<00:02:52.960> and<00:02:53.230> the<00:02:53.740> light<00:02:53.920> is<00:02:53.950> not<00:02:54.100> going<00:02:54.460> to<00:02:54.550> show

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
wrong and the light is not going to show

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.540 
wrong and the light is not going to show
up<00:02:54.910> but<00:02:55.510> in<00:02:56.020> a<00:02:56.140> second<00:02:56.530> I<00:02:56.650> realized<00:02:56.830> that<00:02:57.250> I<00:02:57.280> am

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.550 
up but in a second I realized that I am

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:58.770 
up but in a second I realized that I am
retarded<00:02:57.820> and<00:02:58.150> I<00:02:58.240> need<00:02:58.360> to<00:02:58.450> take<00:02:58.600> this<00:02:58.720> thing

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
retarded and I need to take this thing

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.200 
retarded and I need to take this thing
now<00:02:59.050> one<00:02:59.200> more<00:02:59.290> time<00:02:59.530> and<00:02:59.770> then<00:03:00.670> you<00:03:01.000> walk

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:01.210 
now one more time and then you walk

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:02.910 
now one more time and then you walk
outside<00:03:01.420> and<00:03:01.630> you<00:03:01.870> can<00:03:01.990> see<00:03:02.140> a<00:03:02.170> solid<00:03:02.620> green

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
outside and you can see a solid green

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.490 
outside and you can see a solid green
light<00:03:03.520> once<00:03:04.510> again<00:03:04.660> just<00:03:05.260> wait<00:03:05.410> a<00:03:05.470> couple

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
light once again just wait a couple

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.770 
light once again just wait a couple
seconds<00:03:06.070> it's<00:03:06.250> not<00:03:06.400> immediate<00:03:06.880> don't<00:03:07.480> go<00:03:07.630> back

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
seconds it's not immediate don't go back

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.030 
seconds it's not immediate don't go back
and<00:03:07.960> change<00:03:08.140> anything<00:03:08.320> after<00:03:08.740> you've<00:03:08.890> done

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
and change anything after you've done

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.440 
and change anything after you've done
this<00:03:09.190> just<00:03:09.430> wait<00:03:09.580> for<00:03:09.790> it<00:03:09.850> to<00:03:09.880> activate<00:03:10.330> it

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
this just wait for it to activate it

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.540 
this just wait for it to activate it
will<00:03:10.540> take<00:03:10.690> 10<00:03:11.500> or<00:03:11.620> 15<00:03:11.890> seconds<00:03:12.340> for<00:03:12.370> it<00:03:12.490> to

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.550 
will take 10 or 15 seconds for it to

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:14.640 
will take 10 or 15 seconds for it to
work<00:03:12.700> but<00:03:13.330> you'll<00:03:13.600> see<00:03:13.780> a<00:03:13.810> green<00:03:14.110> light<00:03:14.290> coming

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
work but you'll see a green light coming

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
work but you'll see a green light coming
from<00:03:14.680> somewhere<00:03:14.950> in<00:03:15.070> the<00:03:15.130> distance<00:03:15.220> and<00:03:15.580> then

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
from somewhere in the distance and then

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.340 
from somewhere in the distance and then
shooting<00:03:16.090> straight<00:03:16.390> up<00:03:16.510> to<00:03:16.600> the<00:03:16.720> top<00:03:16.870> of<00:03:16.930> the

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350 
shooting straight up to the top of the

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.790 
shooting straight up to the top of the
lighthouse<00:03:17.620> then<00:03:19.440> hopefully<00:03:20.440> if<00:03:20.530> you've<00:03:20.680> done

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:20.800 
lighthouse then hopefully if you've done

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.140 
lighthouse then hopefully if you've done
this<00:03:20.950> right<00:03:21.160> you<00:03:21.310> should<00:03:21.460> have<00:03:21.580> one<00:03:21.820> crawler

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
this right you should have one crawler

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.120 
this right you should have one crawler
left<00:03:22.510> and<00:03:22.780> so<00:03:23.050> you<00:03:23.110> are<00:03:23.260> going<00:03:23.500> to<00:03:23.709> want<00:03:23.860> to<00:03:23.950> go

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
left and so you are going to want to go

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:25.650 
left and so you are going to want to go
over<00:03:24.310> and<00:03:24.489> shoot<00:03:24.730> the<00:03:24.880> crawler<00:03:25.120> with<00:03:25.330> your<00:03:25.480> V

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
over and shoot the crawler with your V

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.080 
over and shoot the crawler with your V
are<00:03:25.870> 11<00:03:26.500> and<00:03:26.590> it<00:03:27.520> doesn't<00:03:27.760> even<00:03:27.820> have<00:03:27.940> to<00:03:28.000> be

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
are 11 and it doesn't even have to be

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:29.070 
are 11 and it doesn't even have to be
upgraded<00:03:28.510> so<00:03:28.600> don't<00:03:28.750> waste<00:03:28.840> your<00:03:28.989> money

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.080 
upgraded so don't waste your money

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:30.540 
upgraded so don't waste your money
upgrading<00:03:29.320> the<00:03:29.620> VR<00:03:29.830> 11<00:03:30.100> because<00:03:30.250> it's<00:03:30.370> pretty

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:30.550 
upgrading the VR 11 because it's pretty

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:32.550 
upgrading the VR 11 because it's pretty
much<00:03:30.700> useless<00:03:30.910> but<00:03:31.750> then<00:03:32.080> the<00:03:32.200> crawler<00:03:32.440> is

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
much useless but then the crawler is

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.130 
much useless but then the crawler is
going<00:03:32.770> to<00:03:32.830> turn<00:03:32.950> into<00:03:33.130> a<00:03:33.310> nice<00:03:34.270> fully<00:03:34.570> leg<00:03:34.810> man

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
going to turn into a nice fully leg man

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.199 
going to turn into a nice fully leg man
he's<00:03:35.530> going<00:03:35.709> to<00:03:35.800> jump<00:03:36.070> immediately<00:03:36.340> into<00:03:37.060> that

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
he's going to jump immediately into that

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:39.510 
he's going to jump immediately into that
green<00:03:37.600> light<00:03:38.140> and<00:03:38.440> once<00:03:39.100> it's<00:03:39.220> in<00:03:39.280> the<00:03:39.340> green

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:39.520 
green light and once it's in the green

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:40.680 
green light and once it's in the green
light<00:03:39.670> you<00:03:39.700> want<00:03:39.910> to<00:03:39.970> kill<00:03:40.120> him<00:03:40.209> and<00:03:40.390> he<00:03:40.450> floats

light you want to kill him and he floats

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:42.270 
light you want to kill him and he floats
up<00:03:40.900> kind<00:03:41.110> of<00:03:41.140> ear<00:03:41.380> lean<00:03:41.560> a<00:03:41.680> little<00:03:41.709> bit<00:03:41.980> creepy

but<00:03:42.430> um<00:03:43.200> this<00:03:44.200> part<00:03:44.470> can<00:03:44.530> get<00:03:44.650> kind<00:03:44.830> of

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:44.890 
but um this part can get kind of

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:46.080 
but um this part can get kind of
dangerous<00:03:45.190> since<00:03:45.370> it<00:03:45.489> is<00:03:45.610> the<00:03:45.640> end<00:03:45.850> of<00:03:45.910> a<00:03:46.000> round

Wunderwaffe goes a few quick tips for it

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:45.750 
Wunderwaffe goes a few quick tips for it
it's<00:04:42.580> mainly<00:04:43.060> for<00:04:43.420> fun<00:04:43.690> don't<00:04:44.410> expect<00:04:44.770> to<00:04:45.160> to

it's mainly for fun don't expect to to

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.420 
it's mainly for fun don't expect to to
be<00:04:45.880> using<00:04:46.240> it<00:04:46.360> and<00:04:47.170> you'll<00:04:47.560> suddenly<00:04:47.920> the<00:04:48.280> map

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:48.430 
be using it and you'll suddenly the map

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:49.980 
be using it and you'll suddenly the map
will<00:04:48.580> be<00:04:48.700> easy<00:04:48.910> because<00:04:49.240> when<00:04:49.510> you<00:04:49.600> are<00:04:49.810> using

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:49.990 
will be easy because when you are using

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:51.480 
will be easy because when you are using
the<00:04:50.140> Wunderwaffe<00:04:50.500> you<00:04:50.860> actually<00:04:51.250> can't

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:51.490 
the Wunderwaffe you actually can't

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:52.890 
the Wunderwaffe you actually can't
change<00:04:51.760> weapons<00:04:51.970> when<00:04:52.300> you<00:04:52.420> have<00:04:52.660> it<00:04:52.810> that's

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:52.900 
change weapons when you have it that's

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:54.870 
change weapons when you have it that's
the<00:04:53.050> only<00:04:53.290> weapon<00:04:53.530> you<00:04:53.620> can<00:04:53.740> have<00:04:53.920> when<00:04:54.790> you

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:54.880 
the only weapon you can have when you

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.940 
the only weapon you can have when you
run<00:04:55.060> out<00:04:55.240> of<00:04:55.270> ammo<00:04:55.720> with<00:04:55.900> it<00:04:56.050> it's<00:04:56.560> the<00:04:56.710> normal

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:56.950 
run out of ammo with it it's the normal

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:59.100 
run out of ammo with it it's the normal
I<00:04:57.040> think<00:04:57.220> 18<00:04:57.580> shots<00:04:57.820> three<00:04:58.270> in<00:04:58.330> the<00:04:58.420> clip<00:04:58.660> 15

00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.110 
I think 18 shots three in the clip 15

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:02.730 
I think 18 shots three in the clip 15
magazine<00:04:59.850> spare<00:05:00.850> magazines<00:05:01.330> I<00:05:01.390> guess<00:05:01.570> and<00:05:01.810> you

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740 
magazine spare magazines I guess and you

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.920 
magazine spare magazines I guess and you
want<00:05:02.890> to<00:05:02.950> be<00:05:03.010> careful<00:05:03.160> because<00:05:03.610> as<00:05:04.030> I<00:05:04.540> said<00:05:04.600> you

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:04.930 
want to be careful because as I said you

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:06.420 
want to be careful because as I said you
can't<00:05:05.170> switch<00:05:05.410> weapons<00:05:05.620> so<00:05:05.980> if<00:05:06.070> you<00:05:06.160> get<00:05:06.310> in<00:05:06.370> a

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:06.430 
can't switch weapons so if you get in a

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:08.340 
can't switch weapons so if you get in a
tight<00:05:06.640> spot<00:05:06.910> it's<00:05:07.120> really<00:05:07.270> difficult<00:05:07.450> as

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:08.350 
tight spot it's really difficult as

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:09.810 
tight spot it's really difficult as
always<00:05:08.710> make<00:05:08.890> sure<00:05:08.920> you<00:05:09.100> have<00:05:09.190> dr.<00:05:09.460> flopper

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:09.820 
always make sure you have dr. flopper

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:11.280 
always make sure you have dr. flopper
because<00:05:10.090> otherwise<00:05:10.510> you<00:05:10.780> can<00:05:10.900> come<00:05:11.050> back<00:05:11.140> and

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:11.290 
because otherwise you can come back and

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:13.080 
because otherwise you can come back and
track<00:05:11.500> you<00:05:11.680> and<00:05:11.800> be<00:05:12.580> careful<00:05:12.790> when<00:05:13.000> you're

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:13.090 
track you and be careful when you're

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:14.490 
track you and be careful when you're
shooting<00:05:13.270> a<00:05:13.480> large<00:05:13.720> horde<00:05:13.960> of<00:05:14.020> zombies<00:05:14.080> with

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:14.500 
shooting a large horde of zombies with

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:15.960 
shooting a large horde of zombies with
it<00:05:14.650> because<00:05:14.800> as<00:05:15.130> you<00:05:15.400> guys<00:05:15.550> know<00:05:15.580> the

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:15.970 
it because as you guys know the

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:17.010 
it because as you guys know the
Wunderwaffe<00:05:16.330> tends<00:05:16.540> to<00:05:16.660> be<00:05:16.750> a<00:05:16.780> little<00:05:16.870> bit

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:17.020 
Wunderwaffe tends to be a little bit

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:18.960 
Wunderwaffe tends to be a little bit
unpredictable<00:05:17.320> and<00:05:17.800> the<00:05:18.310> little<00:05:18.520> string<00:05:18.850> of

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:18.970 
unpredictable and the little string of

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:21.180 
unpredictable and the little string of
lightning<00:05:19.330> is<00:05:19.530> pretty<00:05:20.530> common<00:05:20.800> for<00:05:20.950> it<00:05:21.130> to

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:21.190 
lightning is pretty common for it to

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:22.740 
lightning is pretty common for it to
shoot<00:05:21.370> out<00:05:21.520> and<00:05:21.700> hit<00:05:21.880> Shore<00:05:22.150> to<00:05:22.300> an<00:05:22.360> accident

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:22.750 
shoot out and hit Shore to an accident

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:24.659 
shoot out and hit Shore to an accident
so<00:05:23.170> really<00:05:23.350> this<00:05:23.530> is<00:05:23.680> more<00:05:23.830> for<00:05:23.950> fun<00:05:24.160> not<00:05:24.490> so

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:24.669 
so really this is more for fun not so

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:27.150 
so really this is more for fun not so
much<00:05:24.820> for<00:05:25.000> practicality<00:05:25.419> but<00:05:26.200> if<00:05:26.680> you<00:05:26.830> want<00:05:27.070> to

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:27.160 
much for practicality but if you want to

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:28.680 
much for practicality but if you want to
use<00:05:27.310> it<00:05:27.430> as<00:05:27.550> long<00:05:27.669> as<00:05:27.820> possible<00:05:28.000> try<00:05:28.480> and<00:05:28.570> pick

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:28.690 
use it as long as possible try and pick

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:30.600 
use it as long as possible try and pick
up<00:05:28.780> some<00:05:28.960> X<00:05:29.140> ammos<00:05:29.500> because<00:05:29.950> if<00:05:30.100> it<00:05:30.280> runs<00:05:30.460> out

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:30.610 
up some X ammos because if it runs out

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:31.830 
up some X ammos because if it runs out
of<00:05:30.640> ammo<00:05:30.820> it's<00:05:31.180> just<00:05:31.390> gonna<00:05:31.480> switch<00:05:31.720> you<00:05:31.750> back

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:31.840 
of ammo it's just gonna switch you back

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.690 
of ammo it's just gonna switch you back
to<00:05:32.050> your<00:05:32.140> regular<00:05:32.410> weapons<00:05:32.710> but<00:05:33.280> that's<00:05:33.610> all

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:33.700 
to your regular weapons but that's all

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:34.860
