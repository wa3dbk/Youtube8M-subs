00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.170
 hi to all his accesses 

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:12.200
 according to the doing 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:18.230
 wen double test 2013 tripoli the galaxy 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:19.730
 30 seconds on the stand samsung you 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.200
 quickly introduce the galaxy grain 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.110
 so sorry for the noise is what we 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:26.600
 done right next we have a screen 5 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:28.490
 inches and he calls the define 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:31.430
 as the terminal that will 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:33.199
 popularize that democratize the big ones 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.239
 game screens it's true that when we had 

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:36.710
 saw the first leaks and announce it 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:38.809
 we had seen it a bit like that 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.430
 actually so we have what android 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:45.920
 what is 1.2 a 5 inch screen 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:48.290
 wsvga dual core 1.2 cr200 giga ram 8 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:51.440
 megapixels at the autofocus level and 2 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:54.350
 high-level megapixels I said we want 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.540
 you can weird 8 megapixels 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.629
 level of the camera by the rear 3 2 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:01.640
 megapixels in the front and 2000 bored 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:04.390
 in peace romanello of the battery one is 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.590
 a terminal that is the subject of a pc 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:09.110
 again it's a terminal that 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.810
 looks like a hope galaxy still 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:14.570
 more than the previous terminals that 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:19.670
 saw a kind of mix between the note the 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:20.539
 net 2 and the galaxy s iii are going then 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.850
 what are we up there 

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:24.920
 then there is a little thing to note it's 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.479
 that duos normally it means dual 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.000
 sim I do not know mentioned in the 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:30.560
 spectrum that I see there but from memory 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.270
 high school students su s is a dual device 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.340
 sim 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:38.240
 here you have the front camera of 2 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:40.100
 megapixels a few sensors if you 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:48.200
 have the classic touch because a menu 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:54.530
 back and welcome button panic not 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:56.450
 big thing and micro usb volume is this 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.370
 that you walk but it's not 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.420
 brushed aluminum as can be seen 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:01.910
 on other terminals 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.430
 it may be a little more cheap kills 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:06.890
 but hey that's how I like it 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:10.069
 to go back to the camera 8 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.870
 megapixel speakers the flash led 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:15.799
 it's pretty much everything we have a light 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.939
 relief by the facts a motive with the 

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:18.590
 fingerprints you have there you have 

00:02:16.939 --> 00:02:22.219
 delivered markets imagine that during 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:26.900
 that you have a slight software to 

00:02:22.219 --> 00:02:28.310
 the back then the galaxy in a 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.040
 device either at all turns under 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:34.930
 android 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:38.930
 when it's simpler scan x 1.224 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:40.849
 4.1.2 with overlay I 'm 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.739
 strong here it is with the overlay touchwiz 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:46.040
 in its latest version 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:51.019
 here it is with page systems 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:53.030
 home is rarely the interface 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:54.590
 that we begin to know by heart and 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.030
 a little too much and I have a great 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.040
 double model is at samsung it's 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.719
 now it's an entire family I 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.670
 present myself with twins from 

00:02:59.719 --> 00:03:04.630
 cousins 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:06.250
 I have uncles it's a bit all born 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.989
 but not after if at the level 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.760
 availability and price is there the problem 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:13.300
 is that for the moment this young 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:15.760
 Angevin is not an example we have here it 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:18.610
 is in screen page homepage mode 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.810
 easy with its big budget there but you 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:24.880
 can of course the switch in mode 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:26.319
 normal is a little better the 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:30.940
 keyboard that is the same and on the nine 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:32.620
 interesting or not bad this keyboard me 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.880
 I like it with the night from there up to 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:36.010
 level of numbers I 'm going with some 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.810
 numbers without fact samsung plays with that 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.600
 it is sure that today it adapts 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:44.350
 function of the screens I saw that we share 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:48.549
 of zhejiang is expected in 2010 is by 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:51.340
 example to the bone 3 min 3 2 and there we 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:52.750
 has really pulled in features with 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.660
 of course the note 2 that has the most 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:04:01.239
 compactness and more the screen is small more 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:05.920
 in the elements and of course cdo on the 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:11.049
 brewing gallery such as dangerous 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:14.980
 with her I was expecting ok did not you 

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:17.310
 the columns on the right an email 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.310
 these cases 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:30.180
 message we also saw that these 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:32.280
 customs after put nimes bathing on the 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.150
 beach respect but we can still 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.190
 in use 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:40.080
 Thursday there is no sn there is no 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:45.990
 the mind use the finger for cause 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:52.880
 it's rather a lot of things close 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:52.880
 with me also look for the video player 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:07.430
 here we got and this gamestop glider 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:12.510
 the calendar 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:14.490
 here is a little lapping note of his more 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:18.570
 relatives after me when the s3 although 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:21.150
 we have noted by Senia this memo 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:23.670
 that there is no pen and his knees 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:25.240
 that after if we only use his 

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:28.039
 brand that goes up 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:31.129
 my opinion not much good thing otherwise 

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:33.259
 pretty nice pay at May 5 5 

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:35.300
 inches for a terminal that normally 

00:05:33.259 --> 00:05:35.810
 and not too expensive I think it's a 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:38.930
 good thing 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:39.830
 so good to have have at the test this 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:44.530
 we think 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:44.530
 make us here soon to be closer
