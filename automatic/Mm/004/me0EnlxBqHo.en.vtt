 My name is shone this is my studio and 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:20.880
 as you see too messy right? 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.950
 I come here sometimes to organize 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.160
 there begins to commit many a lot of mess 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:28.770
 and start doing my crafts and 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.790
 I forget how you had this picture of 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.220
 Claudia 

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:35.640
 There I was getting ink on our I go. 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:38.310
 send it there and I will win because who 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.700
 You know how they organize my atelier and 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:44.239
 I sent it and we will see how it is 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.239
 will stay 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:53.520
 My name is Juliana I would do I am 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.320
 owner of the company organizes it we 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.210
 we work with organization in a way 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.200
 general is not so much residential as 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.750
 business 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:03.870
 So here at the studio it's proposed to do 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.550
 the separation of all brushes can be 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.120
 that we have things that are 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:12.000
 used for a specific purpose, do not 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.979
 then all the material that is used 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.880
 We're going to do this separation for 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.210
 family 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.380
 then in a second stage the people of 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.479
 suddenly need some product 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.580
 organizer then we will insert 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.670
 all this categorization that was made 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.380
 these organizing products and then 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.140
 we pass to another stage that 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.530
 put the label and label 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:37.140
 important because it identifies 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:39.119
 where are my every year? 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.520
 utensils then anyone 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.640
 can find anything without me 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.470
 need snow look there on second door 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.710
 from left to right on the 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.930
 Above is a label that causes this 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.460
 organization is not made especially 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.860
 for a person right? 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:59.760
 the organization will be done in a way that 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.350
 everyone can find what they are looking for 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.780
 we are today with a team of four 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.000
 people that we believe that this 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.640
 be the number of people is 4 wizard 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.209
 do this organization that we go there 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.209
 It's in God's hands 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:39.220
 and there you go tonha medium you fell 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:41.769

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:44.140
 our socks are wonderful 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:45.939
 I already liked staying here now. 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:03:02.379
 I was already up until midnight an hour 

00:02:45.939 --> 00:03:05.459

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:09.010

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:12.159
 waiting to get out of the air with a pendant 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:15.850
 joÃ£o person who sees this was good only 

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:19.240
 The apple that commands me was in person.

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:35.920
 It's some tiles I was telling her. 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:37.960
 that has history is of a like 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:42.660
 In the old days I do not know how they talk. 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:42.660
 Spanish, that kept the walls 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:48.660
 much more beautiful 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:04:01.390
 I recycle a lot of claudia so it's a 

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:04.410

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:07.450

 girls who depend on chemistry 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:32.620
 so it's easy to constant recycling them 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:35.620
