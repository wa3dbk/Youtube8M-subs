00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
you should be able to do no problem in

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.810 
you should be able to do no problem in
general<00:00:58.410> most<00:00:58.890> of<00:00:59.010> these<00:00:59.070> levels<00:00:59.250> very<00:00:59.609> easy

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
number four this one's a little bit more

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.770 
number four this one's a little bit more
complicated<00:01:02.430> probably<00:01:02.850> want<00:01:03.000> to<00:01:03.059> stop<00:01:03.510> right

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
complicated probably want to stop right

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
clear the gap you can kind of do it in

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.109 
clear the gap you can kind of do it in
one<00:01:07.320> fluid<00:01:07.560> motion<00:01:07.830> if<00:01:08.130> you're<00:01:08.310> a<00:01:08.340> skilled

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
one fluid motion if you're a skilled

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.789 
one fluid motion if you're a skilled
rider<00:01:09.360> but<00:01:09.659> if<00:01:09.869> you're<00:01:10.170> not<00:01:10.320> just<00:01:10.500> take<00:01:10.680> your

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
rider but if you're not just take your

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.530 
rider but if you're not just take your
time<00:01:11.010> for<00:01:11.189> number<00:01:11.310> five<00:01:11.580> in<00:01:11.880> my<00:01:12.150> opinion<00:01:12.450> the

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
time for number five in my opinion the

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.870 
time for number five in my opinion the
hardest<00:01:12.869> one<00:01:13.049> in<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.320> entire<00:01:13.409> chain<00:01:13.950> I<00:01:14.220> like

hardest one in the entire chain I like

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.490 
hardest one in the entire chain I like
to<00:01:15.000> stop<00:01:15.210> on<00:01:15.360> that<00:01:15.450> platform<00:01:15.689> get<00:01:16.110> up<00:01:16.200> onto

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
to stop on that platform get up onto

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.249 
to stop on that platform get up onto
here<00:01:16.740> and<00:01:16.860> then<00:01:17.400> bounce<00:01:17.939> or<00:01:18.270> stop<00:01:18.840> depending

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
here and then bounce or stop depending

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.410 
here and then bounce or stop depending
on<00:01:19.619> your<00:01:19.890> momentum<00:01:20.189> and<00:01:20.549> how<00:01:20.729> far<00:01:21.210> you

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
on your momentum and how far you

on your momentum and how far you
actually<00:01:21.780> overshot<00:01:22.259> for<00:01:23.009> number<00:01:23.220> six<00:01:23.490> the

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
actually overshot for number six the

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.130 
actually overshot for number six the
method<00:01:23.909> I<00:01:23.970> like<00:01:24.000> to<00:01:24.240> do<00:01:24.330> is<00:01:24.450> land<00:01:24.600> on<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.930> light

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
method I like to do is land on the light

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.710 
method I like to do is land on the light
and<00:01:25.290> then<00:01:25.890> in<00:01:26.130> one<00:01:26.369> fluid<00:01:26.640> motion<00:01:26.880> bounce<00:01:27.479> up

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
and then in one fluid motion bounce up

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.690 
and then in one fluid motion bounce up
and<00:01:27.930> over<00:01:28.229> if<00:01:28.380> your<00:01:28.860> back<00:01:29.009> wheel<00:01:29.189> gets<00:01:29.430> caught

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
and over if your back wheel gets caught

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.819 
and over if your back wheel gets caught
on<00:01:29.729> that<00:01:30.030> rock<00:01:30.299> behind<00:01:30.540> me<00:01:30.869> you<00:01:31.170> can<00:01:31.439> screw<00:01:31.770> up

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
on that rock behind me you can screw up

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.230 
on that rock behind me you can screw up
a<00:01:32.040> little<00:01:32.189> bit<00:01:32.369> so<00:01:32.579> watch<00:01:32.759> out<00:01:32.970> for<00:01:33.119> that

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
a little bit so watch out for that

number<00:01:33.479> seven<00:01:34.320> one<00:01:34.500> of<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.619> easier<00:01:34.979> ones<00:01:35.130> in

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
number seven one of the easier ones in

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.069 
number seven one of the easier ones in
my<00:01:35.400> opinion<00:01:35.430> don't<00:01:36.090> do<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.390> back<00:01:36.570> wheel<00:01:36.780> tap

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
my opinion don't do the back wheel tap

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.719 
my opinion don't do the back wheel tap
how<00:01:37.229> I<00:01:37.259> did<00:01:37.530> it<00:01:37.650> land<00:01:37.829> on<00:01:37.979> both<00:01:38.009> wheels<00:01:38.460> and

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
how I did it land on both wheels and

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.580 
how I did it land on both wheels and
then<00:01:39.270> make<00:01:39.479> sure<00:01:39.600> you<00:01:39.689> don't<00:01:39.780> overshoot<00:01:40.140> and

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
then make sure you don't overshoot and

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:41.420 
then make sure you don't overshoot and
hit<00:01:40.799> your<00:01:40.920> head<00:01:41.040> on<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.189> wall

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
hit your head on the wall

number eight again very easy you want to
just<00:01:43.950> land<00:01:44.159> on<00:01:44.909> an<00:01:45.060> incline<00:01:45.450> you<00:01:45.659> can<00:01:45.810> let<00:01:45.990> your

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
just land on an incline you can let your

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.960 
just land on an incline you can let your
bike<00:01:46.259> roll<00:01:46.530> backwards<00:01:46.979> if<00:01:47.159> you<00:01:47.369> so<00:01:47.610> desire<00:01:47.939> I
