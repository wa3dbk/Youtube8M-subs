00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:17.340
 hello friends, always better with you 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:21.450
 Today I brought a thought that is 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:27.330
 on my agenda not the agenda of 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:29.820
 daily thoughts and I chose a 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.010
 very interesting thought that I 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.930
 I think they can help you, I'm sure. 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:41.640
 who is going and I wrote the following here 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:46.350
 be your best friend is likely to 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:51.180
 You do not license your best friend. 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:56.010
 heavy stuff that goes like this even 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:01:00.619
 far if words carry in power 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:06.020
 magnetic when we commend ourselves 

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:10.290
 in fact and force the energies 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:15.090
 potential that we are manifesting and 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:18.810
 this frees us from an additional force of 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.400
 expansion of new experiences of 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.450
 success 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:27.660
 so the proposal here is one of 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:32.070
 authorized and you become friends with yourself 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:36.510
 I keep watching many people like 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:40.920
 we are often real friends 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:45.260
 A lot of people do good things through 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:50.010
 others but we do not have the same dedication 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:53.070
 in relationship we are not friends with us 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:56.370
 same when a friend is down 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:59.300
 discouraged because the people failed 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:04.140
 we have for him words of encouragement 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:08.310
 and what words do we say to the 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:11.790
 us when we are those who for 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.689
 hunt down a missed if we are mistaken 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.430
 starting animation 

00:02:13.689 --> 00:02:19.040
 depressive moods 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:22.010
 we often have heavy words 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:26.590
 we often have hard words 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:30.400
 we have words of criticism that end 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:34.849
 worsening our situation 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:37.819
 the proposal is that we formulate here in 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:42.159
 our agenda is to establish a relationship 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:46.909
 of friendship with us because my friends 

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:50.200
 growth and this we will be with us 

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:54.409
 for all eternity 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:56.470
 who is going to accompany me to the whole 

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:56.470
 life 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:03.099
 some people can love us more 

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:08.030
 eventually they were not with us 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:12.170
 all the time and the first occupation they 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:15.189
 have with you is not with us because 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:17.870
 Our first mission is with us. 

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:20.930
 so I'm proposing that I'm doing 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:23.530
 an invitation to you and for you to reformulate 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:27.370
 the way he deals with the English 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:30.379
 father to be so hard to be so cruel 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:32.419
 seem so dependent on others and 

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:35.870
 start taking care of you too 

00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:39.379
 start being today we mentioned here 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:42.739
 that praise when it is the fruit of a 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:43.909
 sincerity and has very magnetic power 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:46.489
 strong 

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:48.169
 When we take refuge, we are in 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:49.959
 strengthening 

00:03:48.169 --> 00:03:51.650
 now when we classify 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:56.079
 mercilessly 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:59.239
 we are weakening and 

00:03:56.079 --> 00:04:01.629
 we have a lot of 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:06.049
 difficulty reversing a situation 

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:07.910
 difficult to get out of a thorny situation is 

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:11.750
 insured person of a particular 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:14.570
 so we need to have this 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:17.959
 conduct of the self-employed I hope this 

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:21.739
 our conversation can spark this in 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:24.800
 you to call yourself to like more 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:27.530
 He is going to do for you 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.120
 everything that you do to your 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:32.630
 best friend 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:36.430
 If you do, I 'm sure that 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:36.430
 you will get much better
