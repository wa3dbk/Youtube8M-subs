it in the corner and tie it on so they

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:32.549

adopted a new dwarf hamster cheerio so I

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:22.380 
adopted a new dwarf hamster cheerio so I

was just borrowing that food dish from
my<00:01:22.510> roommate<00:01:22.810> so<00:01:22.990> I<00:01:23.049> went<00:01:23.170> ahead<00:01:23.229> and<00:01:23.470> got<00:01:23.530> the

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
my roommate so I went ahead and got the

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.170 
my roommate so I went ahead and got the
new<00:01:23.860> food<00:01:24.040> dish

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180 
new food dish

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:26.730 
new food dish
this<00:01:25.450> one's<00:01:25.659> really<00:01:25.900> big<00:01:26.140> which<00:01:26.409> I<00:01:26.530> like

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
this one's really big which I like

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.070 
this one's really big which I like
because<00:01:27.070> dwarf<00:01:27.940> hamsters<00:01:28.390> usually<00:01:28.780> like<00:01:28.960> to

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.080 
because dwarf hamsters usually like to

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.320 
because dwarf hamsters usually like to
sit<00:01:29.320> in<00:01:29.440> their<00:01:29.560> food<00:01:29.770> while<00:01:29.920> they<00:01:30.100> eat<00:01:30.130> so<00:01:30.970> he

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.330 
sit in their food while they eat so he

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:32.700 
sit in their food while they eat so he
should<00:01:31.510> be<00:01:31.570> able<00:01:31.630> to<00:01:31.720> fit<00:01:32.020> in<00:01:32.140> this<00:01:32.260> nice<00:01:32.470> when

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:32.710 
should be able to fit in this nice when

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.219 
should be able to fit in this nice when
he<00:01:32.770> eats<00:01:32.920> I<00:01:33.340> think<00:01:33.790> it<00:01:33.850> was<00:01:33.940> like<00:01:34.030> a<00:01:34.119> dollar<00:01:34.360> 27

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:35.229 
he eats I think it was like a dollar 27

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:40.020 
he eats I think it was like a dollar 27
or<00:01:35.380> so<00:01:36.210> at<00:01:37.210> Walmart<00:01:37.750> and<00:01:38.590> the<00:01:39.460> next<00:01:39.760> thing<00:01:39.909> I

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.030 
or so at Walmart and the next thing I

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.050 
or so at Walmart and the next thing I
got<00:01:40.090> it<00:01:40.479> was<00:01:40.659> just<00:01:41.010> two<00:01:42.010> packs<00:01:42.310> of<00:01:42.610> cheesy

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830 
my recommendation on this but like I

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:52.330 
my recommendation on this but like I
said<00:04:48.889> it<00:04:49.099> was<00:04:49.220> only<00:04:49.449> $13<00:04:50.449> for<00:04:50.810> 50<00:04:51.199> 5.7<00:04:52.009> liters
