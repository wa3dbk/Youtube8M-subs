00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:19.660 
my performance I hope so so this one's a

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:21.840 
my performance I hope so so this one's a
big<00:01:20.050> one<00:01:20.080> to<00:01:20.410> get<00:01:20.590> long<00:01:20.950> notes<00:01:21.280> to<00:01:21.520> really<00:01:21.700> pay

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
big one to get long notes to really pay

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:31.740 
big one to get long notes to really pay
attention

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.389 

the<00:01:32.750> repeat<00:01:33.109> sign<00:01:33.320> so<00:01:33.590> watch<00:01:33.740> your<00:01:33.920> dynamics

00:01:34.389 --> 00:01:34.399 
the repeat sign so watch your dynamics

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:36.429 
the repeat sign so watch your dynamics
on<00:01:34.549> the<00:01:34.579> repeat<00:01:34.939> love<00:01:35.509> the<00:01:35.719> first<00:01:35.899> time<00:01:36.049> p.m.

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:36.439 
on the repeat love the first time p.m.

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:38.260 
on the repeat love the first time p.m.
on<00:01:36.530> the<00:01:36.590> second<00:01:36.859> time<00:01:36.950> and<00:01:37.399> then<00:01:37.759> the<00:01:38.030> next

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
on the second time and then the next

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.810 
on the second time and then the next
line<00:01:38.390> is<00:01:38.860> similar<00:01:39.860> things<00:01:40.100> make<00:01:40.610> sure<00:01:40.759> you

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
line is similar things make sure you

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.929 
line is similar things make sure you
connect<00:01:41.060> the<00:01:41.860> last<00:01:42.860> measure<00:01:43.280> of<00:01:43.429> the<00:01:43.789> first

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:43.939 
connect the last measure of the first

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:45.429 
connect the last measure of the first
line<00:01:44.210> make<00:01:44.509> sure<00:01:44.630> there's<00:01:44.810> all<00:01:44.929> connected

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:45.439 
line make sure there's all connected

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:46.959 
line make sure there's all connected
that's<00:01:45.890> at<00:01:46.039> that<00:01:46.069> way<00:01:46.340> of<00:01:46.460> looking<00:01:46.759> curve

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:46.969 
that's at that way of looking curve

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:50.440 
that's at that way of looking curve
linings<00:01:47.539> so<00:01:48.200> these<00:01:48.759> we<00:01:49.759> see<00:01:49.939> some<00:01:50.090> normal

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
linings so these we see some normal

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:51.789 
linings so these we see some normal
slurs<00:01:50.689> and<00:01:50.929> then<00:01:51.020> we<00:01:51.110> see<00:01:51.289> some<00:01:51.469> curves

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:51.799 
slurs and then we see some curves

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:53.350 
slurs and then we see some curves
between<00:01:51.979> two<00:01:52.310> hands<00:01:52.549> and<00:01:52.819> stuff<00:01:52.969> like<00:01:53.240> the

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 
between two hands and stuff like the

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.199 
between two hands and stuff like the
first<00:01:53.600> two<00:01:53.810> measures<00:01:54.409> that's<00:01:54.619> a<00:01:55.009> so<00:01:55.729> and

00:01:56.199 --> 00:01:56.209 
first two measures that's a so and

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:58.419 
first two measures that's a so and
then<00:01:56.509> the<00:01:56.659> right<00:01:57.049> here<00:01:57.229> at<00:01:57.319> measure<00:01:57.469> 10<00:01:58.069> that's

00:01:58.419 --> 00:01:58.429 
then the right here at measure 10 that's

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:00.850 
then the right here at measure 10 that's
a<00:01:58.549> select<00:01:58.850> it<00:01:59.030> so<00:01:59.659> just<00:01:59.840> be<00:01:59.990> careful<00:02:00.140> make<00:02:00.829> sure

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
a select it so just be careful make sure

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.160 
a select it so just be careful make sure
you<00:02:01.069> know<00:02:01.189> which<00:02:01.340> ones<00:02:01.549> are<00:02:01.670> which<00:02:02.140> okie-dokie

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
you know which ones are which okie-dokie

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.459 
you know which ones are which okie-dokie
you'll<00:02:03.409> get<00:02:03.530> this<00:02:03.709> one<00:02:03.860> great<00:02:04.250> piece
