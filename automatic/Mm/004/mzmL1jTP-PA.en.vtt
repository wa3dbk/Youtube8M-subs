00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.399
 applied a new approach to shaping and 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.730
 the design of their building apparatus which 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.590
 They called me a balance and that says 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.840

 the display has two key 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.970
 technologies that we have already applied 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.729
 individually in our different models 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.770
 This technology is a new rg that removes 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.020
 air gap between the matrix and 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.509
 proper protective glass and technology 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.170
 sensor he lance which says that 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.619
 sensor 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.869
 the sensory layer is applied on itself on itself 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.880
 protective glass as a result of these two 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.220
 technology combining gives you a very 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:42.000

 pales in the bright sun 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:49.870
 he is visible to any state 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.070
 plus on the front of the phone 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:54.460

 light conditions here from above 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.250
 there are two sensors this sensor 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:09.550
 proximity and light sensor and 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:11.380
 bottom here is on with you main 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:15.430

 announced special attention to quality 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:37.780
 performance of small parts 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:40.150
 affects the overall feeling of the device 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.340
 here we are with you 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:45.430

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:48.459
 the card and here is the rocker 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.950
 volume controls that you 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:52.450
 undoubtedly this slot is useful 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.330
 this is the speaker through which will 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.570

 made using the exmor rs matrix this 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.780
 sony company new development 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.060
 created specifically for use in 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.440
 mobile devices and here we have with 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.810
 you are responsible for the LED 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.390
 the camera has a flash 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:22.750
 interesting new features such as these 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:25.180
 such as shooting video in 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.880
 hdr mode i.e. backlit 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:30.790
 for example on the background of a light window or on 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.930
 sunset background you still get 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.269
 very good shots 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:37.420
 I will remind earlier hdr we only had 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:39.040
 photo mode on the left side of the device we 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.870
 see with you two stubs this stub 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:44.610
 plug under 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:46.810
 ford eifel he's responsible 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:51.510
 actually it is a combined port which 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:53.799
 combines micro lesbian and hdmi 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:57.220
 opportunities and next to it is 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:04:01.690
 cap for a desk under the micro card 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:02.980
 sd and if you look carefully you 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:04.989
 note that there are two 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.360
 pads that like us 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:09.629
 guessed serves to charge the machine 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:12.400
 through the docking station but about the docking station 

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:14.230
 Separately in the following review from above 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.660
 is a cap under which hides 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.699
 three and a half millimeters 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:21.300
 this is our traditional port for 

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:24.400
 connect headphones or headset 

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:27.130
 As for the design, well, the phone 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.900
 undoubtedly beautiful and the phone is beautiful for 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:30.970
 bill of materials as i have 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:34.690
 said here we used aluminum 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:36.430
 and the panels themselves on all sides are sad 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:40.650
 frontal and rear side 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:43.150
 It is protected and durable glass which 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:46.740
 gives the device the best premium look 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:49.450
 and very good quality sensations 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:52.090
 as for the internal stuffing apparatus 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:53.770
 here, too, everything is in its place and the company 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:57.669
 I tried to make the device the most 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:05:00.639
 functional for users yuschem 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:02.650
 very nice what i'm talking about first 

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:03.160
 display which have said but 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:06.400
 display 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:08.770
 by itself where not so good if you were 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.690
 nor supplemented by traditional sony narrow 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:13.389
 technologies such as mobile 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:15.340
 second generation bravia engine here 

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:17.590
 worth the engine that handles your 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:20.260
 photo and video image making them still 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:23.760
 sharper yet more contrast more correctly 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:26.530
 exposes the colors and removing the extra noise 

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:28.599
 here it all serves the processor 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:30.610
 this is the processor of one of the last 

00:05:28.599 --> 00:05:32.849
 generations here are qualcomm companies this 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:34.870
 snapdragon s4 pro 

00:05:32.849 --> 00:05:35.710
 quad core on each 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:38.830
 bucket floor 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:40.990
 one and a half gigahertz and at the same time we have the core 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:43.320
 all new cray architecture i.e. 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:45.789
 the device works very very quickly 

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:48.909
 also allows him to work quickly 2 

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:49.690
 gigov of RAM and immediately want 

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:50.729
 note that 

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:52.889
 internal memory 

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:54.330
 there is also here 16 gigabytes 

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:56.879
 onboard memory so how am i 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:58.860
 mentioned here there is a slot for micro sd 

00:05:56.879 --> 00:06:03.050
 all of you can expand the memory of which 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:06.599
 we need the machine will come to us on 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:08.669
 jellybin is on the android version 4.1 and 

00:06:06.599 --> 00:06:12.659
 after some time will receive an update 

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:16.800
 to 4.2 and this is about him 

00:06:12.659 --> 00:06:19.979
 main functions I want to note that 

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:21.419
 this whole very beautiful design is 

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:23.610
 very powerful stuffing 

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:24.839
 all this is packed in dustproof waterproof 

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:27.300
 corps what you could already guess 

00:06:24.839 --> 00:06:29.279
 when looked at the stub that is 

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:31.199
 the device is protected by IP protocol 

00:06:29.279 --> 00:06:34.229
 55 and 57 

00:06:31.199 --> 00:06:37.020
